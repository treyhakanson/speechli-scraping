In this tale occurs\nan instance of the sort, a \"double-barrelled\" instance indeed, that to\nhim seems sufficiently curious to be worthy of telling. The People of\nthe Mist of his adventure story worship a sacred crocodile to which they\nmake sacrifice, but in the original draft of the book this crocodile was\na snake--_monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens_. A friend of the writer,\nan African explorer of great experience who read that draft, suggested\nthat the snake was altogether too unprecedented and impossible.\nAccordingly, also at his suggestion, a crocodile was substituted.\nScarcely was this change effected, however, when Mr. R. T. Coryndon, the\nslayer of almost the last white rhinoceros, published in the _African\nReview_ of February 17, 1894, an account of a huge and terrific serpent\nsaid to exist in the Dichwi district of Mashonaland, that in many\nparticulars resembled the snake of the story, whose prototype, by the\nway, really lives and is adored as a divinity by certain natives in the\nremote province of Chiapas in Mexico. Still, the tale being in type, the\nalteration was suffered to stand. But now, if the _Zoutpansberg Review_\nmay be believed, the author can take credit for his crocodile also,\nsince that paper states that in the course of the recent campaign\nagainst Malaboch, a chief living in the north of the Transvaal, his\nfetish or god was captured, and that god, a crocodile fashioned in wood,\nto which offerings were made. Further, this journal says that among\nthese people (as with the ancient Egyptians), the worship of the\ncrocodile is a recognised cult. Also it congratulates the present writer\non his intimate acquaintance with the more secret manifestations of\nAfrican folklore and beast worship. He must disclaim the compliment in\nthis instance as, when engaged in inventing the 'People of the Mist,'\nhe was totally ignorant that any of the Bantu tribes reverenced either\nsnake or crocodile divinities. But the coincidence is strange, and once\nmore shows, if further examples of the fact are needed, how impotent\nare the efforts of imagination to vie with hidden truths--even with the\nhidden truths of this small and trodden world.\n\n_September_ 20, 1894.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE MIST\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE SINS OF THE FATHER ARE VISITED ON THE CHILDREN\n\nThe January afternoon was passing into night, the air was cold and\nstill, so still that not a single twig of the naked beech-trees stirred;\non the grass of the meadows lay a thin white rime, half frost, half\nsnow; the firs stood out blackly against a steel-hued sky, and over the\ntallest of them hung a single star. Past these bordering firs there ran\na road, on which, in this evening of the opening of our story, a young\nman stood irresolute, glancing now to the right and now to the left.\n\nTo his right were two stately gates of iron fantastically wrought,\nsupported by stone pillars on whose summits stood griffins of black\nmarble embracing coats of arms, and banners inscribed with the device\n_Per ardua ad astra_. Beyond these gates ran a broad carriage drive,\nlined on either side by a double row of such oaks as England alone can\nproduce under the most favourable circumstances of soil, aided by the\nnurturing hand of man and three or four centuries of time.\n\nAt the head of this avenue, perhaps half a mile from the roadway,\nalthough it looked nearer because of the eminence upon which it was\nplaced, stood a mansion of the class that in auctioneers' advertisements\nis usually described as \"noble.\" Its general appearance was Elizabethan,\nfor in those days some forgotten Outram had practically rebuilt it; but\na large part of its fabric was far more ancient than the Tudors,\ndating back, so said tradition, to the time of King John. As we are\nnot auctioneers, however, it will be unnecessary to specify its many\nbeauties; indeed, at this date, some of the tribe had recently employed\ntheir gift of language on these attractions with copious fulness and\naccuracy of detail, since Outram Hall, for the first time during six\ncenturies, was, or had been, for sale.\n\nSuffice it to say that, like the oaks of its avenue, Outram was such\na house as can only be found in England; no mere mass of bricks\nand mortar, but a thing that seemed to have acquired a life and\nindividuality of its own. Or, if this saying be too far-fetched and\npoetical, at the least this venerable home bore some stamp and trace\nof the lives and individualities of many generations of mankind, linked\ntogether in thought and feeling by the common bond of blood.\n\nThe young man who stood in the roadway looked long and earnestly towards\nthe mass of buildings that frowned upon him from the crest of the hill,\nand as he looked an expression came into his face which fell little, if\nat all, short of that of agony, the agony which the young can feel at\nthe shock of an utter and irredeemable loss. The face that wore such\nevidence of trouble was a handsome one enough, though just now all the\ncharm of youth seemed to have faded from it. It was dark and strong, nor\nwas it difficult to guess that in after-life it might become stern. The\nform also was shapely and athletic, though not very tall, giving promise\nof more than common strength, and the bearing that of a gentleman who\nhad not brought himself up to the belief that ancient blood can cover\nmodern deficiencies of mind and manner. Such was the outward appearance\nof Leonard Outram as he was then, in his twenty-third year.\n\n\n\nWhile Leonard watched and hesitated on the roadway, unable, apparently,\nto make up his mind to pass those iron gates, and yet desirous of doing\nso, carts and carriages began to appear hurrying down the avenue towards\nhim.\n\n\"I suppose that the sale is over,\" he muttered to himself. \"Well, like\ndeath, it is a good thing to have done with.\"\n\nThen he turned to go; but hearing the crunch of wheels close at hand,\nstepped back into the shadow of the gateway pillar, fearing lest he\nshould be recognised on the open road. A carriage came up, and, just as\nit reached the gates, something being amiss with the harness, a footman\ndescended from the box to set it right. From where he stood Leonard\ncould see its occupants, the wife and daughter of a neighbouring squire,\nand overhear their conversation. He knew them well; indeed, the younger\nlady had been one of his favourite partners at the county balls.\n\n\"How cheap the things went, Ida! Fancy buying that old oak sideboard for\nten pounds, and with all those Outram quarterings on it too! It is as\ngood as an historical document, and I am sure that it must be worth at\nleast fifty. I shall sell ours and put it into the dining-room. I have\ncoveted that sideboard for years.\"\n\nThe daughter sighed and answered with some asperity.\n\n\"I am so sorry for the Outrams that I should not care about the\nsideboard if you had got it for twopence. What an awful smash! Just\nthink of the old place being bought by a Jew! Tom and Leonard are\nutterly ruined, they say, not a sixpence left. I declare I nearly cried\nwhen I saw that man selling Leonard's guns.\"\n\n\"Very sad indeed,\" answered the mother absently; \"but if he is a Jew,\nwhat does it matter? He has a title, and they say that he is enormously\nrich. I expect there will be plenty going on at Outram soon. By the way,\nmy dear Ida, I do wish you would cure yourself of the habit of calling\nyoung men by their Christian names--not that it matters about these two,\nfor we shall never see any more of them.\"\n\n\"I am sure I hope that we shall,\" said Ida defiantly, \"and when we do\nI shall call them by their Christian names as much as ever. You never\nobjected to it before the smash, and I _love_ both of them, so there!\nWhy did you bring me to that horrid sale? You know I did not want to go.\nI shall be wretched for a week, I----\" and the carriage swept on out of\nhearing.\n\nLeonard emerged from the shadow of the gateway and crossed the road\nswiftly. On the further side of it he paused, and looking after the\nretreating carriage said aloud, \"God bless you for your kind heart, Ida\nHatherley. Good luck go with you! And now for the other business.\"\n\nA hundred yards or so down the road, was a second gate of much less\nimposing appearance than those which led to the Outram Hall. Leonard\npassed through it and presently found himself at the door of a square\nred brick house, built with no other pretensions than to those of\ncomfort. This was the Rectory, now tenanted by the Reverend and\nHonourable James Beach, to whom the living had been presented many years\nbefore by Leonard's father, Mr. Beach's old college friend.\n\nLeonard rang the bell, and as its distant clamour fell upon his ears a\nnew fear struck him. What sort of reception would he meet with in this\nhouse? he wondered. Hitherto his welcome had always been so cordial that\nuntil this moment he had never doubted of it, but now circumstances were\nchanged. He was no longer in the position of second son to Sir Thomas\nOutram of Outram Hall. He was a beggar, an outcast, a wanderer, the son\nof a fraudulent bankrupt and suicide. The careless words of the woman\nin the carriage had let a flood of light into his mind, and by it he saw\nmany things which he had never seen before. Now he remembered a little\nmotto that he had often heard, but the full force of which he did not\nappreciate until to-day. \"Friends follow fortune,\" was the wording of\nthis motto. He remembered also another saying that had frequently been\nread to him in church and elsewhere, and the origin of which precluded\nall doubt as to its truth:--\n\n\"Unto every one that hath shall be given, but from him that hath not\nshall be taken away even that which he hath.\"\n\nNow, as it chanced, Leonard, beggared as he was, had still something\nleft which could be taken away from him, and that something the richest\nfortune which Providence can give to any man in his youth, the love of\na woman whom he also loved. The Reverend and Honourable James Beach\nwas blessed with a daughter, Jane by name, who had the reputation, not\nundeserved, of being the most beautiful and sweetest-natured girl that\nthe country-side could show. Now, being dark and fair respectively and\nhaving lived in close association since childhood, Leonard and Jane, as\nmight be expected from the working of the laws of natural economy, had\ngravitated towards each other with increasing speed ever since they had\ncome to understand the possibilities of the institution of marriage.\nIn the end thus mutual gravitation led to a shock and confusion of\nindividualities which was not without its charm; or, to put the matter\nmore plainly, Leonard proposed to Jane and had been accepted with many\nblushes and some tears and kisses.\n\nIt was a common little romance enough, but, like everything else with\nwhich youth and love are concerned, it had its elements of beauty. Such\naffairs gain much from being the first in the series. Who is there among\nus that does not adore his first love and his first poem? And yet when\nwe see them twenty years after!\n\nPresently the Rectory door was opened and Leonard entered. At this\nmoment it occurred to him that he did not quite know why he had come. To\nbe altogether accurate, he knew why he had come well enough. It was to\nsee Jane, and arrive at an understanding with her father. Perhaps it\nmay be well to explain that his engagement to that young lady was of the\nsuppressed order. Her parents had no wish to suppress it, indeed; for\nthough Leonard was a younger son, it was well known that he was destined\nto inherit his mother's fortune of fifty thousand pounds more or less.\nBesides, Providence had decreed a delicate constitution to his elder and\nonly brother Thomas. But Sir Thomas Outram, their father, was reputed\nto be an ambitious man who looked to see his sons marry well, and this\nmarriage would scarcely have been to Leonard's advantage from the family\nlawyer point of view.\n\nTherefore, when the matter came to the ears of Jane's parents, they\ndetermined to forego the outward expression of their pride and delight\nin the captive whom they owed to the bow and spear of their daughter's\nloveliness, at any rate for a while, say until Leonard had taken his\ndegree. Often and often in the after-years did they have occasion to\nbless themselves for their caution. But not the less on this account was\nLeonard's position as the affianced lover of their daughter recognised\namong them; indeed, the matter was no secret from anybody, except\nperhaps from Sir Thomas himself. For his part, Leonard took no pains\nto conceal it even from him; but the father and son met rarely, and the\nestrangement between them was so complete, that the younger man saw no\nadvantage in speaking of a matter thus near to his heart until there\nappeared to be a practical object in so doing.\n\nThe Rev. James Beach was a stout person of bland and prepossessing\nappearance. Never had he looked stouter, more prepossessing, or blander\nthan on this particular evening when Leonard was ushered into his\npresence. He was standing before the fire in his drawing-room holding a\nhuge and ancient silver loving-cup in both hands, and in such a position\nas to give the observer the idea that he had just drained its entire\ncontents. In reality, it may be explained, he was employed in searching\nfor a hall-mark on the bottom of the goblet, discoursing the while\nto his wife and children--for Jane had a brother--upon its value and\nbeauty. The gleam of the silver caught Leonard's eye as he entered\nthe room, and he recognised the cup as one of the heirlooms of his own\nfamily.\n\nLeonard's sudden and unlooked-for advent brought various emotions into\nactive play. There were four people gathered round that comfortable\nfire--the rector, his wife, his son, and last, but not least, Jane\nherself. Mr. Beach dropped the cup sufficiently to allow himself to\nstare at his visitor along its length, for all the world as though he\nwere covering him with a silver blunderbuss. His wife, an active little\nwoman, turned round as if she moved upon wires, exclaiming, \"Good\ngracious, who'd have thought it?\" while the son, a robust young man\nof about Leonard's own age and his college companion, said \"Hullo! old\nfellow, well, I never expected to see _you_ here to-day!\"--a remark\nwhich, however natural it may have been, scarcely tended to set his\nfriend at ease.\n\nJane herself, a tall and beautiful girl with bright auburn hair, who was\nseated on a footstool nursing her knees before the fire, and paying\nvery little heed to her father's lecture upon ancient plate, did none of\nthese things. On the contrary, she sprang up with the utmost animation,\nher lips apart and her lovely face red with blushes, or the heat of the\nfire, and came towards him exclaiming, \"Oh, Leonard, dear Leonard!\"\n\nMr. Beach turned the silver blunderbuss upon his daughter and fired a\nsingle, but most effective shot.\n\n\"Jane!\" he said in a voice in which fatherly admonition and friendly\nwarning were happily blended.\n\nJane stopped in full career was though in obedience to some lesson which\nmomentarily she had forgotten. Then Mr. Beach, setting down the flagon,\nadvanced upon Leonard with an ample pitying smile and outstretched hand.\n\n\"How are you, my dear boy, how are you?\" he said. \"We did not expect--\"\n\n\"To see me here under the circumstances,\" put in Leonard bitterly. \"Nor\nwould you have done so, but Tom and I understood that it was only to be\na three days' sale.\"\n\n\"Quite right, Leonard. As first advertised the sale was for three days,\nbut the auctioneer found that he could not get through in the time. The\naccumulations of such an ancient house as Outram Hall are necessarily\n_vast_,\" and he waved his hand with a large gesture.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Leonard.\n\n\"Hum!\" went on Mr. Beach, after a pause which was beginning to grow\nawkward. \"Doubtless you will find it a matter for congratulation that on\nthe whole things sold well. It is not always the case, not by any\nmeans, for such collections as those of Outram, however interesting and\nvaluable they may have been to the family itself, do not often fetch\ntheir worth at a country auction. Yes, they sold decidedly well, thanks\nchiefly to the large purchases of the new owner of the estate. This\ntankard, for instance, which I have bought--hem--as a slight memento of\nyour family, cost me ten shillings an ounce.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" answered Leonard coldly; \"I always understood that it was\nworth fifty.\"\n\nThen came another pause, during which all who were present, except Mr.\nBeach and himself, rose one by one and quitted the room. Jane was the\nlast to go, and Leonard noticed, as she passed him, that there were\ntears in her eyes.\n\n\"Jane,\" said her father in a meaning voice when her hand was already on\nthe door, \"you will be careful to be dressed in time for dinner, will\nyou not, love? You remember that young Mr. Cohen is coming, and I should\nlike somebody to be down to receive him.\"\n\nJane's only answer to this remark was to pass through the door and slam\nit behind her. Clearly the prospect of the advent of this guest was not\nagreeable to her.\n\n\"Well, Leonard,\" went on Mr. Beach when they were alone, in a tone that\nwas meant to be sympathetic but which jarred horribly on his listener's\nears, \"this is a sad business, very sad. But why are you not sitting\ndown?\"\n\n\"Because no one asked me to,\" said Leonard as he took a chair.\n\n\"Hem!\" continued Mr. Beach; \"by the way I believe that Mr. Cohen is a\nfriend of yours, is he not?\"\n\n\"An acquaintance, not a friend,\" said Leonard.\n\n\"Indeed, I thought that you were at the same college.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I do not like him.\"\n\n\"Prejudice, my dear boy, prejudice. A minor sin indeed, but one against\nwhich you must struggle. But there, there, it is natural that you should\nnot feel warmly about the man who will one day own Outram. Ah! as I\nsaid, this is all very sad, but it must be a great consolation to you to\nremember that when everything is settled there will be enough, so I am\ntold, to pay your unhappy father's debts. And now, is there anything\nthat I can do for you or your brother?\"\n\nLeonard reflected that whatever may have been his father's misdeeds, and\nthey were many and black, it should scarcely have lain in the mouth of\nthe Rev. James Beach, who owed nearly everything he had in the world to\nhis kindness, to allude to them. But he could not defend his father's\nmemory, it was beyond defence, and just now he must fight for his own\nhand.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Beach,\" he said earnestly, \"you can help me very much. You\nknow the cruel position in which my brother and I are placed through no\nfault of our own: our old home is sold, our fortunes have gone utterly,\nand our honourable name is tarnished. At the present moment I have\nnothing left in the world except the sum of two hundred pounds which\nI had saved for a purpose of my own out of my allowance. I have no\nprofession and cannot even take my degree, because I am unable to afford\nthe expense of remaining at college.\"\n\n\"Black, I must say, very black,\" murmured Mr. Beach, rubbing his chin.\n\"But under these circumstances what can I do to help you? You must trust\nin Providence, my boy; it never fails the deserving.\"\n\n\"This,\" answered Leonard, nervously; \"you can show your confidence in\nme by allowing my engagement to Jane to be proclaimed.\" Here Mr. Beach\nwaved his hand once more as though to repel some invisible force.\n\n\"One moment,\" continued Leonard. \"I know that it seems a great deal to\nask, but listen. Although everything looks so dark, I have reliance on\nmyself. With the stimulus which my affection for your daughter will give\nme, and knowing that in order to win her I must first put myself in a\nposition to support her as she should be supported, I am quite convinced\nthat I shall be able to surmount all difficulties by my own efforts.\"\n\n\"Really, I cannot listen to such nonsense any longer,\" broke in Mr.\nBeach angrily. \"Leonard, this is nothing less than an impertinence. Of\ncourse any understanding that may have existed between you and Jane is\nquite at an end. Engagement! I heard of no engagement. I knew that there\nwas some boy and girl folly between you indeed, but for my part I never\ngave the matter another thought.\"\n\n\"You seem to forget, sir,\" said Leonard, keeping his temper with\ndifficulty, \"that not six months ago you and I had a long conversation\non this very subject, and decided that nothing should be said to my\nfather of the matter until I had taken my degree.\"\n\n\"I repeat that it is an impertinence,\" answered Mr. Beach, but with a\ncareful avoidance of the direct issue. \"What! You, who have nothing in\nthe world except a name which you father has--well--tarnished--to\nuse your own word, you ask me for my dear daughter's hand? You are so\nselfish that you wish not only to ruin her chances in life, but also to\ndrag her into the depths of your poverty. Leonard, I should never have\nthought it of you!\"\n\nThen at last Leonard broke out.\n\n\"You do not speak the truth. I did not ask you for your daughter's hand.\nI asked you for the promise of it when I should have shown myself worthy\nof her. But now there is an end of that. I will go as you bid me but\nbefore I go I will tell you the truth. You wish to use Jane's beauty to\ncatch this Jew with. Of her happiness you think nothing, provided only\nyou can secure his money. She is not a strong character, and it is quite\npossible that you will succeed in your plot, but I tell you it will not\nprosper. You, who owe everything to our family, now when trouble has\novertaken us, turn upon me and rob me of the only good that was left to\nme. By putting an end to a connection of which everybody knew, you stamp\nme still deeper into the mire. So be it, but of this I am sure, that\nsuch conduct will meet with a due reward, and that a time will come\nwhen you will bitterly regret the way in which you have dealt with your\ndaughter and treated me in my misfortunes. Good-bye.\"\n\nAnd Leonard turned and left the room and the Rectory.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE SWEARING OF THE OATH\n\nArthur Beach, Jane's brother, was standing in the hall waiting to speak\nto Leonard, but he passed without a word, closing the hall door behind\nhim. Outside snow was falling, though not fast enough to obscure the\nlight of the moon which shone through the belt of firs.\n\nLeonard walked on down the drive till he neared the gate, when suddenly\nhe heard the muffled sound of feet pursuing him through the snow. He\nturned with an exclamation, believing that the footsteps were those\nof Arthur Beach, for at the moment he was in no mood for further\nconversation with any male member of that family. As it chanced,\nhowever, he found himself face to face not with Arthur, but with Jane\nherself, who perhaps had never looked more beautiful than she did at\nthis moment in the snow and the moonlight. Indeed, whenever Leonard\nthought of her in after-years, and that was often, there arose in\nhis mind a vision of a tall and lovely girl, her auburn hair slightly\npowdered over with the falling flakes, her breast heaving with emotion,\nand her wide grey eyes gazing piteously upon him.\n\n\"Oh! Leonard,\" she said nervously, \"why do you go without saying\ngood-bye to me?\"\n\nHe looked at her awhile before he answered, for something in his heart\ntold him that this was the last sight which he should win of his love\nfor many a year, and therefore his eyes dwelt upon her as we gaze upon\none whom the grave is about to hide from us for ever.\n\nAt last he spoke, and his words were practical enough.\n\n\"You should not have come out in those thin shoes through the snow,\nJane. You will catch cold.\"\n\n\"I wish I could,\" she answered defiantly, \"I wish that I could catch\nsuch a cold as would kill me; then I should be out of my troubles. Let\nus go into the summer-house; they will never think of looking for me\nthere.\"\n\n\"How will you get there?\" asked Leonard; \"it is a hundred yards away,\nand the snow always drifts in that path.\"\n\n\"Oh! never mind the snow,\" she said.\n\nBut Leonard did mind it, and presently he hit upon a solution of the\ndifficulty. Having first glanced up the drive to see that nobody was\ncoming, he bent forward and without explanation or excuse put his arms\naround Jane, and lifting her as though she were a child, he bore her\ndown the path which led to the summer-house. She was heavy, but, sooth\nto say, he could have wished the journey longer. Presently they were\nthere, and very gently he laid her on her feet again, kissing her upon\nthe lips as he did so. Then he took off his overcoat and wrapped it\nround her shoulders.\n\nAll this while Jane had not spoken. Indeed, the poor girl felt so happy\nand so safe in her lover's arms that it seemed to her as though she\nnever wished to speak, or to do anything for herself again. It was\nLeonard who broke the silence.\n\n\"You ask me why I left without saying good-bye to you, Jane. It was\nbecause your father has dismissed me from the house and forbidden me to\nhave any more to do with you.\"\n\n\"Oh, why?\" asked the girl, lifting her hands despairingly.\n\n\"Can't you guess?\" he answered with a bitter laugh.\n\n\"Yes, Leonard,\" she whispered, taking his hand in sympathy.\n\n\"Perhaps I had better put it plainly,\" said Leonard again; \"it may\nprevent misunderstandings. Your father has dismissed me because _my_\nfather embezzled all my money. The sins of the father are visited\nupon the children, you see. Also he has done this with more than usual\ndistinctness and alacrity, because he wishes you to marry young Mr.\nCohen, the bullion-broker and the future owner of Outram.\"\n\nJane shivered.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" she said, \"and oh! Leonard, I hate him!\"\n\n\"Then perhaps it will be as well not to marry him,\" he answered.\n\n\"I would rather die first,\" she said with conviction.\n\n\"Unfortunately one can't always die when it happens to be convenient,\nJane.\"\n\n\"Oh! Leonard, don't be horrid,\" she said, beginning to cry. \"Where are\nyou going, and what shall I do?\"\n\n\"To the bad probably,\" he answered. \"At least it all depends upon you.\nLook here, Jane, if you will stick to me I will stick to you. The luck\nis against me now, but I have it in me to see that through. I love you\nand I would work myself to death for you; but at the best it must be a\nquestion of time, probably of years.\"\n\n\"Oh! Leonard, indeed I will if I can. I am sure that you do not love\nme more than I love you, but I can never make you understand how odious\nthey all are to me about you, especially Papa.\"\n\n\"Confound him!\" said Leonard beneath his breath; and if Jane heard, at\nthat moment her filial affections were not sufficiently strong to induce\nher to remonstrate.\n\n\"Well, Jane,\" he went on, \"the matter lies thus: either you must put\nup with their treatment or you must give me the go-by. Listen: in six\nmonths you will be twenty-one, and in this country all her relations put\ntogether can't force a woman to marry a man if she does not wish to, or\nprevent her from marrying one whom she does wish to marry. Now you know\nmy address at my club in town; letters sent there will always reach me,\nand it is scarcely possible for your father or anybody else to prevent\nyou from writing and posting a letter. If you want my help or to\ncommunicate in any way, I shall expect to hear from you, and if need be,\nI will take you away and marry you the moment you come of age. If, on\nthe other hand, I do not hear from you, I shall know that it is because\nyou do not choose to write, or because that which you have to write\nwould be too painful for me to read. Do you understand, Jane?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, Leonard, but you put things so hardly.\"\n\n\"Things have been put hardly enough to me, love, and I must be\nplain--this is my last chance of speaking to you.\"\n\nAt this moment an ominous sound echoed through the night; it was none\nother than the distant voice of Mr. Beach, calling from his front-door\nstep, \"Jane! Are you out there, Jane?\"\n\n\"Oh! heavens!\" she said, \"there is my father calling me. I came out\nby the back door, but mother must have been up to my room and found me\ngone. She watches me all day now. What _shall_ I do?\"\n\n\"Go back and tell them that you have been saying good-bye to me. It is\nnot a crime; they cannot kill you for it.\"\n\n\"Indeed they can, or just as bad,\" replied Jane. Then suddenly she threw\nher arms about her lover's neck and burying her beautiful face upon\nhis breast, she began to sob bitterly, murmuring, \"Oh my darling, my\ndarling, what shall I do without you?\"\n\nOver the brief and distressing scene which followed it may be well to\ndrop a veil. Leonard's bitterness of mind forsook him now, and he kissed\nher and comforted her as he might best, even going so far as to mingle\nhis tears with hers, tears of which he had no cause to be ashamed. At\nlength she tore herself loose, for the shouts were growing louder and\nmore insistent.\n\n\"I forgot,\" she sobbed, \"here is a farewell present for you; keep it\nin memory of me, Leonard,\" and thrusting her hand into the bosom of her\ndress she drew from it a little packet which she gave to him.\n\nThen once more they kissed and clung together, and in another moment she\nhad vanished back into the snow and darkness, passing out of Leonard's\nsight and out of his life, though from his mind she could never pass.\n\n\"A farewell present. Keep it in memory of me.\" The words yet echoed in\nhis ears, and to Leonard they seemed fateful--a prophecy of utter loss.\nSighing heavily, he opened the packet and examined its contents by the\nfeeble moonlight. They were not large: a prayer-book bound in morocco,\nher own, with her name on the fly-leaf and a short inscription beneath,\nand in the pocket of its cover a lock of auburn hair tied round with\nsilk.\n\n\"An unlucky gift,\" said Leonard to himself; then putting on his coat,\nwhich was yet warm from Jane's shoulders, he also turned and vanished\ninto the snow and the night, shaping his path towards the village inn.\n\nHe reached it in due course, and passed into the little parlour that\nadjoined the bar. It was a comfortable room enough, notwithstanding its\nadornments of badly stuffed birds and fishes, and chiefly remarkable for\nits wide old-fashioned fireplace with wrought-iron dogs. There was no\nlamp in the room when Leonard entered, but the light of the burning wood\nwas bright, and by it he could see his brother seated in a high-backed\nchair gazing into the fire, his hand resting on his knee.\n\nThomas Outram was Leonard's elder by two years and cast in a more\nfragile mould. His face was the face of a dreamer, the brown eyes were\nlarge and reflective, and the mouth sensitive as a child's. He was a\nscholar and a philosopher, a man of much desultory reading, with refined\ntastes and a really intimate knowledge of Greek gems.\n\n\"Is that you, Leonard?\" he said, looking up absently; \"where have you\nbeen?\"\n\n\"To the Rectory,\" answered his brother.\n\n\"What have you been doing there?\"\n\n\"Do you want to know?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. Did you see Jane?\"\n\nThen Leonard told him all the story.\n\n\"What do you think she will do?\" asked Tom when his brother had\nfinished. \"Given the situation and the woman, it is rather a curious\nproblem.\"\n\n\"It may be,\" answered Leonard; \"but as I am not an equation in algebra\nyearning to be worked out, I don't quite see the fun of it. But if you\nask me what I think she will do, I should say that she will follow the\nexample of everybody else and desert me.\"\n\n\"You seem to have a poor idea of women, old fellow. I know little of\nthem myself and don't want to know more. But I have always understood\nthat it is the peculiar glory of their sex to come out strong on these\nexceptional occasions. 'Woman in our hours of ease,' etc.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall see. But it is my opinion that women think a great deal\nmore of their own hours of ease than of those of anybody else. Thank\nheaven, here comes our dinner!\"\n\nThus spoke Leonard, somewhat cynically and perhaps not in the best of\ntaste. But, his rejoicing over its appearance notwithstanding, he did\nnot do much justice to the dinner when it arrived. Indeed, it would be\ncharitable to make allowances for this young man at that period of his\nlife. He had sustained a most terrible reverse, and do what he might he\ncould never quite escape from the shadow of his father's disgrace,\nor put out of his mind the stain with which his father had dimmed the\nhonour of his family. And now a new misfortune hung over him. He had\njust been driven with contumely from a house where hitherto he was the\nmost welcome of guests; he had parted, moreover, from the woman whom he\nloved dearly, and under circumstances which made it doubtful if their\nseparation would not be final.\n\nLeonard possessed the gift of insight into character, and more common\nsense than can often be expected from a young man in love. He knew well\nthat the chief characteristic of Jane's nature was a tendency to yield\nto the circumstances of the hour, and though he hoped against hope,\nhe could find no reason to suppose that she would exhibit greater\ndetermination in the matter of their engagement than her general lack\nof strength might lead him to anticipate. Besides, and here his common\nsense came in, would it be wise that she should do so? After all,\nwhat had he to offer her, and were not his hopes of future advancement\nnothing better than a dream? Roughly as he had put it, perhaps Mr.\nBeach was right when he told him that he, Leonard, was both selfish and\nimpertinent, since was it not a selfish impertinence in him to ask any\nwoman to link her fortune with his in the present state of his affairs?\n\nLet us therefore make excuses for his words and outward behaviour, for\nat heart Leonard had much to trouble him.\n\nWhen the cloth had been cleared away and they were alone again, Tom\nspoke to his brother, who was moodily filling his pipe.\n\n\"What shall we do to-night, Leonard?\" he said.\n\n\"Go to bed, I suppose,\" he answered.\n\n\"See here, Leonard,\" said his brother again, \"what do you say to having\na last look at the old place?\"\n\n\"If you wish, Tom, but it will be painful.\"\n\n\"A little pain more or less can scarcely hurt us, old fellow,\" said Tom,\nlaying his thin hand on his brother's shoulder.\n\nThen they started. A quarter of an hour's walking brought them to the\nHall. The snow had ceased falling now and the night was beautifully\nclear, but before it ceased it had done a welcome office in hiding from\nview all the litter and wreckage of the auction, which make the scene\nof a recent sale one of the most desolate sights in the world. Never had\nthe old house looked grander or more eloquent of the past than it did on\nthat night to the two brothers who were dispossessed of their heritage.\nThey wandered round it in silence, gazing affectionately at each\nwell-known tree and window, till at length they came to the gun-room\nentrance. More from habit than for any other reason Leonard turned the\nhandle of the door. To his surprise it was open; after the confusion of\nthe sale no one had remembered to lock it.\n\n\"Let us go in,\" he said.\n\nThey entered and wandered from room to room till they reached the\ngreater hall, a vast and oak-roofed chamber built after the fashion of\nthe nave of a church, and lighted by a large window of ecclesiastical\ndesign. This window was filled with the armorial bearings of many\ngenerations of the Outram family, wrought in stained glass and placed\nin couples, for next to each coat of arms were the arms of its bearer's\ndame. It was not quite full, however, for in it remained two blank\nshields, which had been destined to receive the escutcheons of Thomas\nOutram and his wife.\n\n\"They will never be filled now, Leonard,\" said Tom, pointing to these;\n\"curious, isn't it, not to say sad?\"\n\n\"Oh! I don't know,\" answered his brother; \"I suppose that the Cohens\nboast some sort of arms, or if not they can buy them.\"\n\n\"I should think that they would have the good taste to begin a new\nwindow for themselves,\" said Tom.\n\nThen he was silent for a while, and they watched the moonlight streaming\nthrough the painted window, the memorial of so much forgotten grandeur,\nand illumining the portraits of many a dead Outram that gazed upon them\nfrom the panelled walls.\n\n\"_Per ardua ad astra_,\" said Tom, absently reading the family motto\nwhich alternated pretty regularly with a second device that some members\nof it had adopted--\"For Heart, Home, and Honour.\"\n\n\"'_Per ardua ad astra_'--through struggle to the stars--and 'For Heart,\nHome, and Honour,'\" repeated Tom; \"well, I think that our family never\nneeded such consolations more, if indeed there are any to be found in\nmottoes. Our Heart is broken, our hearth is desolate, and our honour is\na byword, but there remain the 'struggle and the stars.'\"\n\nAs he spoke his face took the fire of a new enthusiasm: \"Leonard,\"\nhe went on, \"why should not we retrieve the past? Let us take that\nmotto--the more ancient one--for an omen, and let us fulfil it. I\nbelieve it is a good omen, I believe that one of us will fulfil it.\"\n\n\"We can try,\" answered Leonard. \"If we fail in the struggle, at least\nthe stars remain for us as for all human kind.\"\n\n\"Leonard,\" said his brother almost in a whisper, \"will you swear an oath\nwith me? It seems childish, but I think that under some circumstances\nthere is wisdom even in childishness.\"\n\n\"What oath?\" asked Leonard.\n\n\"This; that we will leave England and seek fortune in some foreign\nland--sufficient fortune to enable us to repurchase our lost home; that\nwe will never return here until we have won this fortune; and that death\nalone shall put a stop to our quest.\"\n\nLeonard hesitated a moment, then answered:\n\n\"If Jane fails me, I will swear it.\"\n\nTom glanced round as though in search of some familiar object, and\npresently his eye fell upon what he sought. A great proportion of the\nfurniture of the old house, including the family portraits, had been\npurchased by the in-coming owner. Among the articles which remained was\na very valuable and ancient bible, one of the first ever printed indeed,\nthat stood upon an oaken stand in the centre of the hall, to which it\nwas securely chained. Tom led the way to this bible, followed by his\nbrother. Then they placed their hands upon it, and standing there in the\nshadow, the elder of them spoke aloud in a voice that left no doubt of\nthe earnestness of his purpose, or of his belief in their mission.\n\n\"We swear,\" he said, \"upon this book and before the God who made us that\nwe will leave this home that was ours, and never look upon it again till\nwe can call it ours once more. We swear that we will follow this, the\npurpose of our lives, till death destroys us and it; and may shame and\nutter ruin overtake us if, while we have strength and reason, we turn\nour backs upon this oath! So help us God!\"\n\n\"So help us God!\" repeated Leonard.\n\nThus in the home of their ancestors, in the presence of their Maker, and\nof the pictured dead who had gone before them, did Thomas and Leonard\nOutram devote their lives to this great purpose. Perhaps, as one of them\nhad said, the thing was childish, but if so, at the least it was solemn\nand touching. Their cause seemed hopeless indeed; but if faith can move\nmountains, much more can honest endeavour attain its ends. In that hour\nthey felt this. Yes, they believed that the end would be attained by one\nof them, though they guessed little what struggles lay between them\nand the Star they hoped to gain, or how strangely they should be borne\nthither.\n\nOn the morrow they went to London and waited there a while, but no word\ncame from Jane Beach, and for good or ill the chains of the oath that he\nhad taken riveted themselves around Leonard Outram's neck.\n\nWithin three months of this night the brothers were nearing the shores\nof Africa, the land of the Children of the Mist.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nAFTER SEVEN YEARS\n\n\"What is the time, Leonard?\"\n\n\"Eleven o'clock, Tom.\"\n\n\"Eleven--already? I shall go at dawn, Leonard. You remember Johnston\ndied at dawn, and so did Askew.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake don't speak like that, Tom! If you think you are\ngoing to die, you will die.\"\n\nThe sick man laughed a ghost of a laugh--it was half a death-rattle.\n\n\"It is no use talking, Leonard; I feel my life flaring and sinking like\na dying fire. My mind is quite clear now, but I shall die at dawn for\nall that. The fever has burnt me up! Have I been raving, Leonard?\"\n\n\"A little, old fellow,\" answered Leonard.\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"Home mostly, Tom.\"\n\n\"Home! We have none, Leonard; it is sold. How long have we been away\nnow?\"\n\n\"Seven years.\"\n\n\"Seven years! Yes. Do you remember how we said good-bye to the old place\non that winter night after the auction? And do you remember what we\nresolved?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Repeat it.\"\n\n\"We swore that we would seek wealth enough to buy Outram back till we\nwon it or died, and that we would never return to England till it was\nwon. Then we sailed for Africa. For seven years we have sought and done\nno more than earn a livelihood, much less a couple of hundred thousand\npounds or so.\"\n\n\"Leonard.\"\n\n\"Yes, Tom?\"\n\n\"You are sole heir to our oath now, and to the old name with it, or you\nwill be in a few hours. I have fulfilled my vow. I have sought till I\ndied. You will take up the quest till you succeed or die. The struggle\nhas been mine, may you live to win the Star. You will persevere, will\nyou not, Leonard?\"\n\n\"Yes, Tom, I will.\"\n\n\"Give me your hand on it, old fellow.\"\n\nLeonard Outram knelt down beside his dying brother, and they clasped\neach other's hands.\n\n\"Now let me sleep awhile. I am tired. Do not be afraid, I shall wake\nbefore the--end.\"\n\nHardly had the words passed his lips when his eyes closed and he sank\ninto stupor or sleep.\n\nHis brother Leonard sat down upon a rude seat, improvised out of an\nempty gin-case. Without the tempest shrieked and howled, the great\nwind shook the Kaffir hut of grass and wattle, piercing it in a hundred\nplaces till the light of the lantern wavered within its glass, and\nthe sick man's hair was lifted from his clammy brow. From time to\ntime fierce squalls of rain fell like sheets of spray, and the water,\npenetrating the roof of grass, streamed to the earthen floor. Leonard\ncrept on his hands and knees to the doorway of the hut, or rather to the\nlow arched opening which served as a doorway, and, removing the board\nthat secured it, looked out at the night. Their hut stood upon the ridge\nof a great mountain; below was a sea of bush, and around it rose the\nfantastic shapes of other mountains. Black clouds drove across the dying\nmoon, but occasionally she peeped out and showed the scene in all its\nvast solemnity and appalling solitude.\n\nPresently Leonard closed the opening of the doorway, and going back to\nhis brother's side he gazed upon him earnestly. Many years of toil and\nprivation had not robbed Thomas Outram's face of its singular beauty, or\nfound power to mar its refinement. But death was written on it.\n\nLeonard sighed, then, struck by a sudden thought, sought for and found a\nscrap of looking-glass. Holding it close to the light of the lantern,\nhe examined the reflection of his own features. The glass mirrored a\nhandsome bearded man, dark, keen-eyed like one who is always on the\nwatch for danger, curly-haired and broad-shouldered; not very tall, but\nhaving massive limbs and a form which showed strength in every movement.\nThough he was still young, there was little of youth left about the man;\nclearly toil and struggle had done an evil work with him, ageing his\nmind and hardening it as they had hardened the strength and vigour of\nhis body. The face was a good one, but most men would have preferred\nto see friendship shining in those piercing black eyes rather than the\nlight of enmity. Leonard was a bad enemy, and his long striving with the\nworld sometimes led him to expect foes where they did not exist.\n\nEven now this thought was in his mind: \"He is dying,\" he said to\nhimself, as he laid down the glass with the care of a man who cannot\nafford to hazard a belonging however trivial, \"and yet his face is\nnot so changed as mine is. My God! he is dying! My brother--the only\nman--the only living creature I love in the world, except one perhaps,\nif indeed I love her still. Everything is against us--I should say\nagainst me now, for I cannot count him. Our father was our first enemy;\nhe brought us into the world, neglected us, squandered our patrimony,\ndishonoured our name, and shot himself. And since then what has it been\nbut one continual fight against men and nature? Even the rocks in which\nI dig for gold are foes--victorious foes--\" and he glanced at his hands,\nscarred and made unshapely by labour. \"And the fever, that is a foe.\nDeath is the only friend, but he won't shake hands with me. He takes my\nbrother whom I love as he has taken the others, but me he leaves.\"\n\nThus mused Leonard sitting sullenly on the red box, his elbow on his\nknee, his rough hands held beneath his chin pushing forward the thick\nblack beard till it threw a huge shadow, angular and unnatural, on to\nthe wall of the hut, while without the tempest now raved, now lulled,\nand now raved again. An hour--two--passed and still he sat not moving,\nwatching the face of the fever-stricken man that from time to time\nflushed and was troubled, then grew pale and still. It seemed to him\nas though by some strange harmony of nature the death-smitten blood was\nstriving to keep pace with the beat of the storm, knowing that presently\nlife and storm would pass together into the same domain of silence.\n\nAt length Tom Outram opened his eyes and looked at him, but Leonard knew\nthat he did not see him as he was. The dying eyes studied him indeed and\nwere intelligent, but he could feel that they read something on his\nface that was not known to himself, nor could be visible to any other\nman--read it as though it were a writing.\n\nSo strange was this scrutiny, so meaningless and yet so full of a\nmeaning which he could not grasp, that Leonard shrank beneath it. He\nspoke to his brother, but no answer came,--only the great hollow eyes\nread on in that book which was printed upon his face; that book, sealed\nto him, but to the dying man an open writing.\n\nThe sight of the act of death is always terrible; it is terrible to\nwatch the latest wax and ebb of life, and with the intelligence to\ncomprehend that these flickerings, this coming and this going, these\nsinkings and these last recoveries are the trial flights of the\nanimating and eternal principle--call it soul or what you will--before\nit trusts itself afar. Still more terrible is it under circumstances of\nphysical and mental desolation such as those present to Leonard Outram\nin that hour.\n\nBut he had looked on death before, on death in many dreadful shapes, and\nyet he had never been so much afraid. What was it that his brother,\nor the spirit of his brother, read in his face? What learning had he\ngathered in that sleep of his, the last before the last? He could not\ntell--now he longed to know, now he was glad not to know, and now he\nstrove to overcome his fears.\n\n\"My nerves are shattered,\" he said to himself. \"He is dying. How shall I\nbear to see him die?\"\n\nA gust of wind shook the hut, rending the thatch apart, and through the\nrent a little jet of rain fell upon his brother's forehead and ran down\nhis pallid cheeks like tears. Then the strange understanding look passed\nfrom the wide eyes, and once more they became human, and the lips were\nopened.\n\n\"Water,\" they murmured.\n\nLeonard gave him to drink, with one hand holding the pannikin to his\nbrother's mouth and with the other supporting the dying head. Twice he\ngulped at it, then with a brusque motion of his wasted arm he knocked\nthe cup aside, spilling the water on the earthen floor.\n\n\"Leonard,\" he said, \"you will succeed.\"\n\n\"Succeed in what, Tom?\"\n\n\"You will get the money and Outram--and found the family afresh--but you\nwill not do it alone. _A woman will help you_.\"\n\nThen his mind wandered a little and he muttered, \"How is Jane? Have you\nheard from Jane?\" or some such words.\n\nAt the mention of this name Leonard's face softened, then once more grew\nhard and anxious.\n\n\"I have not heard of Jane for years, old fellow,\" he said; \"probably she\nis dead or married. But I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Don't waste time, Leonard,\" Tom answered, rousing himself from his\nlethargy. \"Listen to me. I am going fast. You know dying men see\nfar--sometimes. I dreamed it, or I read it in your face. I tell\nyou--_you_ will die at Outram. Stay here a while after I am dead. Stay a\nwhile, Leonard!\"\n\nHe sank back exhausted, and at that moment a gust of wind, fiercer than\nany which had gone before, leapt down the mountain gorges, howling with\nall the voices of the storm. It caught the frail hut and shook it. A\ncobra hidden in the thick thatch awoke from its lethargy and fell with\na soft thud to the floor not a foot from the face of the dying man--then\nerected itself and hissed aloud with flickering tongue and head swollen\nby rage. Leonard started back and seized a crowbar which stood near, but\nbefore he could strike, the reptile sank down and, drawing its shining\nshape across his brother's forehead, once more vanished into the thatch.\n\nHis eyes did not so much as close, though Leonard saw a momentary\nreflection of the bright scales in the dilated pupils and shivered at\nthis added terror, shivered as though his own flesh had shrunk beneath\nthe touch of those deadly coils. It was horrible that the snake should\ncreep across his brother's face, it was still more horrible that his\nbrother, yet living, should not understand the horror. It caused him to\nremember our invisible companion, that ancient enemy of mankind of whom\nthe reptile is an accepted type; it made him think of that long sleep\nwhich the touch of such as this has no power to stir.\n\nAh! now he was going--it was impossible to mistake that change, the last\nquick quiver of the blood, followed by an ashen pallor, and the sob\nof the breath slowly lessening into silence. So the day had died last\nnight, with a little purpling of the sky--a little sobbing of the\nwind--then ashen nothingness and silence. But the silence was broken,\nthe night had grown alive indeed--and with a fearful life. Hark! how the\nstorm yelled! those blasts told of torment, that rain beat like tears.\nWhat if his brother----He did not dare to follow the thought home.\n\nHark! how the storm yelled!--the very hut wrenched at its strong\nsupports as though the hands of a hundred savage foes were dragging it.\nIt lifted--by heaven it was gone!--gone, crashing down the rocks on the\nlast hurricane blast of the tempest, and there above them lowered the\nsullen blue of the passing night flecked with scudding clouds, and there\nin front of them, to the east and between the mountains, flared the\nsplendours of the dawn.\n\nSomething had struck Leonard heavily, so heavily that the blood ran down\nhis face; he did not heed it, he scarcely felt it; he only clasped his\nbrother in his arms and, for the first time for many years, he kissed\nhim on the brow, staining it with the blood from his wound.\n\nThe dying man looked up. He saw the glory in the East. Now it ran along\nthe mountain sides, now it burned upon their summits, to each summit a\npillar of flame, a peculiar splendour of its own diversely shaped; and\nnow the shapes of fire leaped from earth to heaven, peopling the sky\nwith light. The dull clouds caught the light, but they could not hold it\nall: back it fell to earth again, and the forests lifted up their arms\nto greet it, and it shone upon the face of the waters.\n\nThomas Outram saw--and staggering to his knees he stretched out his arms\ntowards the rising sun, muttering with his lips.\n\nThen he sank upon Leonard's breast, and presently all his story was\ntold.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE LAST VIGIL\n\nFor a while Leonard sat by the body of his brother. The daylight grew\nand gathered about him, the round ball of the sun appeared above the\nmountains.\n\nThe storm was gone. Were it not for some broken fragments of the\nvanished hut, it would have been difficult to know even that it had\nbeen. Insects began to chirrup, lizards ran from the crevices of the\nrocks, yonder the rain-washed bud of a mountain lily opened before his\neyes. Still Leonard sat on, his face stony with grief, till at length\na shadow fell upon him from above. He looked up--it was cast by a\nvulture's wings, as they hurried to the place of death.\n\nGrasping his loaded rifle Leonard sprang to his feet. Nearer and nearer\ncame the bird, wheeling above him in lessening circles: it forgot the\npresence of the living in its desire for the dead. Leonard lifted the\nrifle, aimed and fired. The report rang out clearly on the silent air,\nand was echoed from krantz and kloof and mountain side, and from above\nanswered the thud of the bullet. For a moment the smitten bird swayed\nupon its wide pinions, then they seemed to crumple beneath its weight,\nand it fell heavily and lay flapping and striking at the stones with its\nstrong beak.\n\n\"I also can kill,\" said Leonard to himself as he watched it die. \"Kill\ntill you are killed--that is the law of life.\" Then he turned to the\nbody of his brother and made it ready for burial as best he might,\nclosing the eyes, tying up the chin with a band of twisted grass, and\nfolding the thin toil-worn hands upon the quiet heart.\n\nWhen all was finished he paused from his dreadful task, and a thought\nstruck him.\n\n\"Where are those Kaffirs?\" he said aloud--the sound of his voice seemed\nto dull the edge of solitude--\"the lazy hounds, they ought to have been\nup an hour ago. Hi! Otter, Otter!\"\n\nThe mountains echoed \"Otter, Otter;\" there was no other reply. Again he\nshouted without result. \"I don't like to leave it,\" he said, \"but I must\ngo and see;\" and, having covered the body with a red blanket to scare\naway the vultures, he started at a run round some projecting rocks that\nbordered the little plateau on which the hut had stood. Beyond them the\nplateau continued, and some fifty paces from the rocks was a hollow in\nthe mountain side, where a softer vein of stone had been eaten away by\ncenturies of weather.\n\nIt was here that the Kaffirs slept--four of them--and in front of this\ncave or grotto it was their custom to make a fire for cooking. But on\nthat morning no fire was burning, and no Kaffirs were to be seen.\n\n\"Still asleep,\" was Leonard's comment as he strode swiftly towards\nthe cave. In another moment he was in it shouting \"Otter, Otter!\" and\nsaluting with a vigorous kick a prostrate form, of which he could just\nsee the outline. The form did not move, which was strange, for such\na kick should have suffered to wake even the laziest Basuto from his\nsoundest sleep. Leonard stopped to examine it, and the next moment\nstarted back violently, exclaiming:\n\n\"Great heavens! it is Cheat, and he is dead.\"\n\nAt this moment a thick voice spoke from the corner of the cave in Dutch,\nthe voice of Otter:\n\n\"I am here, Baas, but I am tied: the Baas must loosen me, I cannot\nstir.\"\n\nLeonard advanced, striking a match as he came. Presently it burned up,\nand he saw the man Otter lying on his back, his legs and arms bound\nfirmly with rimpis of hide, his face and body a mass of contusions.\nDrawing his hunting-knife Leonard cut the rimpis and brought the man\nfrom out the cave, carrying rather than leading him.\n\nOtter was a knob-nosed Kaffir, that is of the Bastard Zulu race.\nThe brothers had found him wandering about the country in a state of\nsemi-starvation, and he had served them faithfully for some years.\nThey had christened him Otter, his native patronymic being quite\nunpronounceable, because of his extraordinary skill in swimming, which\nalmost equalled that of the animal after which he was named.\n\nIn face the man was hideous, though his ugliness was not unpleasant,\nbeing due chiefly to a great development of his tribal feature, the\nnose, and in body he was misshapen to the verge of monstrosity. In fact\nOtter was a dwarf, measuring little more than four feet in height. But\nwhat he lacked in height he made up in breadth; it almost seemed as\nthough, intended by nature to be a man of many inches, he had been\ncompressed to his present dimensions by art. His vast chest and limbs,\nindicating strength nearly superhuman, his long iron arms and massive\nhead, all gave colour to this idea. Otter had one redeeming feature,\nhowever--his eyes, that when visible, which at this moment was not the\ncase, were large, steady, and, like his skin, of a brilliant black.\n\n\"What has happened?\" said Leonard, also speaking in Dutch.\n\n\"This, Baas! Last night those three Basuto villains, your servants, made\nup their minds to desert. They told me nothing, and they were so cunning\nthat, though I watched even their thoughts, I never guessed. They knew\nbetter than to tell me, for I would have beaten them--yes, all! So they\nwaited till I was sound asleep, then came behind me, the three of them,\nand tied me fast that I should not hinder them and that they might take\naway Baas Tom's gun which you lent me, and other things. Soon I found\nout their plans, and though I laughed in their faces, oh! my heart was\nblack with rage.\n\n\"When the Basuto dogs had tied me they mocked me, calling me foul\nnames and saying that I might stop and starve with the white fools,\nmy masters, who always dug for yellow iron and found so little, being\nfools. Then they got together everything of value, yes, down to the\nkettle, and made ready to go, and each of them came and slapped me on\nthe face, and one burnt me here upon the nose with a hot brand.\n\n\"All this I bore as a man must bear trouble which comes from the skies,\nbut when Cheat took up Baas Tom's gun and the others came with a reim\nto tie me to the rock, I could bear it no more. So I shouted aloud and\ndrove at Cheat, who held the gun. Ah! they had forgotten that if my arms\nare strong, my head is stronger! Butting like a bull I caught him fair\nin the middle, and his back was against the side of the cave. He made\none noise, no more; he will never make another noise, for my head\nsmashed him up inside and the rock hurt me through him. Then the other\ntwo hit me with kerries--great blows--and my arms being tied I could not\ndefend myself, though I knew that they would soon kill me; so I groaned\nand dropped down, pretending to be dead--just like a stink-cat.\n\n\"At last, thinking that they had finished me, the Basutos ran away in a\ngreat hurry, for they feared lest you might hear the shouting and should\ncome after them with rifles. They were so much afraid that they left the\ngun and most of the other things. After that I fainted; it was silly,\nbut those kerries of theirs are of rhinoceros horn--I should not have\nminded so much had they been of wood, but the horn bites deep. That is\nall the story. It will please Baas Tom to know that I saved his gun.\nWhen he hears it he will forget his sickness and say 'Well done Otter!\nHa! Otter, your head is hard.'\"\n\n\"Make your heart hard also,\" said Leonard with a sad smile; \"Baas Tom is\ndead. He died at daybreak in my arms. The fever killed him as it killed\nthe other _Inkoosis_ (chiefs).\"\n\nOtter heard, and, letting his bruised head fall upon his mighty chest,\nremained for a while in silence. At length he lifted it, and Leonard saw\ntwo tears wandering down the battered countenance. \"_Wow_,\" he said, \"is\nit so? Oh! my father, are you dead, you who were brave like a lion and\ngentle as a girl? Yes, you are dead, my ears have heard it, and were it\nnot for your brother, the Baas Leonard, I think that I would kill myself\nand follow you. _Wow_, my father, are you indeed dead, who smiled upon\nme yesterday?\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Leonard; \"I dare not leave him long.\"\n\nAnd he went, Otter following him with a reeling gait, for he was weak\nfrom his injuries. Presently they reached the spot, and Otter saw that\nthe hut was gone.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he said, \"our bad spirits were abroad last night. Well,\nnext time it will be the turn of the good ones.\" Then he drew near to\nthe corpse and saluted it with uplifted hand and voice.\n\n\"Chief and Father,\" he said in Zulu, for Otter had wandered long and\nknew many tongues, but he loved the Zulu best of all. \"While you lived\nupon earth, you were a good man and brave, though somewhat quick of\ntemper and quarrelsome like a woman. Now you have wearied of this world\nand flown away like an eagle towards the sun, and there where you live\nin the light of the sun you will be braver and better yet, and become\nmore patient and not quarrel any more with those who are less clever\nthan you. Chief and Father, I salute you! May he whom you named the\nOtter serve you and the _Inkoosi_ your brother once more in the House\nof the Great-Great, if one so ugly and misshapen can enter there. As for\nthe Basuto dog whom I slew and who would have stolen your gun, I see\nnow that I killed him in a fortunate hour, that he might be the slave\nbeneath your feet in the House of the Great-Great. Ah! had I known,\nI would have sent a better man, for there as here Cheat will still be\nCheat. Hail, my father! Hail and farewell! Let your spirit watch over us\nand be gentle towards us, who love you yet.\"\n\nAnd Otter turned away without further ado; and having washed his wounds,\nhe set himself to the task of preparing such coarse food as they had in\nstore.\n\nWhen it was ready Leonard ate of it, and after he had finished eating,\ntogether they bore the body to the little cave for shelter. It was\nLeonard's purpose to bury his brother at sundown; he might not delay\nlonger, but till then he would watch by him, keeping the last of many\nvigils. So all that remained of the Basuto Cheat having been dragged\nforth and thrust unceremoniously into an ant-bear hole by Otter, who\nwhile he disposed of the body did not spare to taunt the spirit of his\nlate treacherous foe, the corpse of Thomas Outram was laid in its place,\nand Leonard sat himself by its side in the gloom of the cave.\n\nAbout midday Otter, who had been sleeping off his sorrows, physical and\nmental, came into the cavern. They were short of meat, he said, and with\nthe leave of the Baas he would take the gun of the dead Baas and try to\nshoot a buck.\n\nLeonard bade him go, but to be back by sundown, as he should require his\nhelp.\n\n\"Where shall we dig a hole, Baas?\" asked the dwarf.\n\n\"One is dug,\" answered Leonard; \"he who is dead dug it himself as the\nothers did. We will bury him in the last pit he made looking for gold,\nto the right of where the hut stood. It is deep and ready.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, a good place--though perhaps Baas Tom would not have worked\nat it so strongly had he known. _Wow!_ Who knows to what end he labours?\nBut perchance it is a little near the donga. Twice that hole has been\nflooded while Baas Tom was digging in it. Then he would jump out, but\nnow----\"\n\n\"I have settled it,\" said Leonard shortly; \"go, and be back half an hour\nbefore sundown at latest. Stop! Bring some of those rock-lilies if you\ncan. The Baas was fond of them.\"\n\nThe dwarf saluted and went. \"Ah!\" he said to himself as he waddled down\nthe hill where he hoped to find game, \"ah! you do not fear men dead or\nliving--overmuch; yet, Otter, it is true that you are better here in\nthe sun, though the sun is hot, than yonder in the cave. Say, Otter, why\ndoes Baas Tom look so awful now that he is dead--he who was so gentle\nwhile yet he lived? Cheat did not look awful, only uglier. But then you\nkilled Cheat, and the Heavens killed Baas Tom and set their own seal\nupon him. And what will Baas Leonard do now that his brother is dead and\nthe Basutos have run away? Go on digging for the yellow iron which is\nso hard to find, and of which, when it is found, no man can even make a\nspear? Nay, what is that to you, Otter? What the Baas does you do--and\nhere be the spoor of an impala buck.\"\n\nOtter was right. The day was fearfully hot. It was summer in East\nAfrica, or rather autumn, the season of fever, thunder and rain, a time\nthat none who valued their lives would care to spend in those latitudes\nsearching for gold with poor food and but little shelter. But men who\nseek their fortunes are not chary of hazarding their own lives of\nthose of others. They become fatalists, not avowedly perhaps, but\nunconsciously. Those who are destined to die must die, they think, the\nothers will live. And, after all, it does not greatly matter which they\ndo, for, as they know well, the world will never miss them.\n\nWhen Leonard Outram, his brother, and two companions in adventure heard\nfrom the natives that at a particular spot on the mountains, nominally\nin the Portuguese territory near the lowest branch of the Zambesi, gold\ncould be dug out like iron ore, and when, at the price of two Tower\nmuskets and a half-bred greyhound, they received a concession from the\nactual chief of that territory to dig up and possess the gold without\nlet or hindrance from any person whatsoever, they did not postpone their\nundertaking because the country was fever-stricken and the unhealthy\nseason drew on. In the first place, their resources were not great at\nthe moment; and in the second, they feared lest some other enterprising\nperson with three Tower muskets and two grey-hounds should persuade the\nchief to rescind their concession in his favour.\n\nSo they journeyed laboriously to the place of hidden wealth, and with\nthe help of such native labour as they could gather began their search.\nAt first they were moderately successful; indeed, wherever they dug\nthey found \"colour,\" and once or twice stumbled upon pockets of\nnuggets. Their hopes ran high, but presently one of the four--Askew by\nname--sickened and died of fever. They buried him and persevered with\nvarying luck. Then a second member of their party, Johnston, was taken\nill. He lingered for a month and died also.\n\nAfter this Leonard was for abandoning the enterprise, but, as fate would\nhave it, on the day following Johnston's death they found gold in very\npromising quantities, and his brother, whose desire to win the wealth\nnecessary was only increased by many disappointments, would not listen\nto such advice.\n\nSo they rebuilt the hut on a higher and healthier spot and stayed. But\non one unfortunate day Thomas Outram went out shooting, and losing his\npath in the bush was forced to spend a night in the fever-fog. A\nweek afterwards he complained of sickness and pains in the back and\nhead--three weeks later he died as we have seen.\n\nAll these events and many others antecedent passed through Leonard's\nmind as he wore out the long hours seated by the side of his dead\nbrother. Never before had he felt so lonely, so utterly desolate, so\nbankrupt of all love and hope. It was a fact that at this moment he had\nno friend in the wide world, unless he could call the knob-nosed native\nOtter a friend. He had been many years away from England, his few\ndistant relations there troubled themselves no more about him or his\nbrother, outcasts, wanderers in strange lands, and his school and\ncollege companions in all probability had forgotten his existence.\n\nThere was one indeed, Jane Beach. But since that night of parting, seven\nyears ago, he had heard nothing of her. Twice he had written, but no\nanswer came to his letters. Then he gave up writing, for Leonard was a\nproud man; moreover he guessed that she did not reply because she could\nnot. As he had said to his brother, Jane might be dead by now, or more\nprobably married to Mr. Cohen. And yet once they had loved each other,\nand to this hour he still loved her, or thought that he did. At least,\nthrough all the weary years of exile, labour, and unceasing search after\nthe unattainable, her image and memory had been with him, a distant\ndream of sweetness, peace, and beauty, and they were with him yet,\nthough nothing of her remained to him except the parting gift of her\nprayer-book and the lock of hair within it. The wilderness is not\na place where men can forget their earliest love. No, he was alone,\nabsolutely and utterly alone, a wanderer in wild lands, a sojourner with\nrough unlettered men and savages.\n\nAnd now, what should he do? This place was played out. There was\nalluvial gold indeed, but Leonard knew to-day that it was not in the\nearth, but in the veins of quartz which permeated the mountains, that\nthe real wealth must be sought for, and how could he extract it from the\nquartz without machinery or capital? Besides, his Kaffir servants had\ndeserted him, worn out with hard work and fever, and there were\nno others to be had at this season. Well, it was only one more\ndisappointment; he must go back to Natal and take his chance. At the\nworst he could always earn his living as a transport-rider, and at the\nbest he wearied of this search for wealth which was to build up their\nfamily afresh.\n\nThen of a sudden Leonard remembered what he had promised--to go on\nseeking till he died. Very good, he would keep the promise--till he\ndied. And he remembered also that curious prophecy to which Thomas had\ngiven utterance on the previous night, that prophecy of wealth which\nshould come to him.\n\nOf course it was nothing but the distraught fancy of a dying man. For\nmany years his brother had brooded over this possibility of gaining\nriches, not for their own sake indeed, but that it might be the means\nof restoring the ancient family, which their father had brought to shame\nand ruin. It was not wonderful in a man of his excitable temperament\nthat at the hour of his death he should have grasped at some vision of\nattainment of the object of his life, though by the hand of another.\nAnd yet how strangely he had looked at him! With what conviction he had\nspoken! But all this was beside the point; he, Leonard, had sworn an\noath many years ago, and only last night he had promised to continue to\nobserve that oath. Therefore, come good or ill, he must pursue it to the\nend.\n\nThus he mused till he grew weary as he sat hour after hour by the side\nof that rigid thing, which had been his playmate, his brother, and his\nfriend. From time to time he rose and walked about the cave. As the\nafternoon waned the air grew hotter and stiller, while a great cloud\ngathered on the horizon.\n\n\"There will be thunder at sundown,\" said Leonard aloud; \"I wish that\nOtter would come back, so that we might get the funeral over; otherwise\nwe shall have to wait till to-morrow.\"\n\nAt length, about half an hour before nightfall, the dwarf appeared at\nthe mouth of the cave, looking more like a gnome than a man against the\nlurid background of the angry sky. A buck was tied across his enormous\nshoulders, and in his hand he held a large bunch of the fragrant\nmountain lilies.\n\nThen the two of them buried Thomas Outram, there in his lonely grave\nwhich he himself had dug by the gully, and the roll of the thunder was\nhis requiem. It seemed a fitting termination to his stormy and laborious\nlife.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nOTTER GIVES COUNSEL\n\nWhen the burial was finished and Thomas Outram slept his last sleep\nbeneath six feet of earth and stones, his brother took out the\nprayer-book that Jane Beach had given him, which in truth formed all his\nlibrary, and read the funeral service over the grave, ending it by the\nglare of the lightning flashes. Then he and Otter went back to the cave\nand ate, speaking no word. After they had done their meal Leonard called\nto the dwarf, who took his food at a little distance.\n\n\"Otter,\" he said, setting the lantern between them, \"you are a faithful\nman and clever in your way. I would tell you a story and ask you\nsomething. At the least,\" he added to himself in English, \"in such a\nmatter your judgment is as good as mine.\"\n\n\"Speak on, Baas,\" said the dwarf; \"my ears are open;\" and he squatted\ndown on the further side of the lantern like some great toad, watching\nhis master's face with his black eyes.\n\n\"Otter, the Baas who is dead and I journeyed to this country about seven\nyears ago. Before we came here we had been rich men, chiefs in our own\nplace, but we lost our kraals and cattle and lands; they were sold,\nothers took them and we became poor. Yes, we who were fat grew lean as\ntrek oxen at the end of winter. Then we said to each other, 'Here we\nhave no longer any home, the shame of poverty has come upon us, we are\nbroken vessels, empty men of no account; also we are chiefs by blood,\nand here we cannot let ourselves out to labour like the common people,\nlest both the common people and the nobles should make a mock of us. Our\ngreat stone kraal that has been ours for many generations is taken from\nus, others dwell in it, strange women order it, and their children shall\nmove about the land. We will go away.'\"\n\n\"The blood is the blood,\" broke in Otter, \"the wealth is nothing; that\ncomes and goes, but the blood is always the blood. Why did you not\ngather an impi, my father, and put these strangers to the spear and take\nyour kraal again?\"\n\n\"In our land this may not be, Otter, for there wealth is more than race.\nSo we should have been brought to still greater shame. Riches alone\ncould give us back our home, and we had none left. Therefore we swore\nan oath together, the dead Baas and I, that we would journey to this\nfar country and seek to win wealth that we might buy back our lands and\nkraal and rule over them as in past years, and our children after us.\"\n\n\"A good oath,\" said Otter, \"but here we should have sworn it otherwise,\nand there would have been a ringing of steel about that kraal, not the\nchink of yellow iron.\"\n\n\"We came, Otter, and for seven years we have laboured harder than the\nlowest of our servants; we have travelled to and fro, mixing with many\npeoples, learning many tongues, and what have we found? The Baas yonder\na grave in the wilderness--I the food that the wilderness gives, no\nmore.\"\n\n\"A poor wage so far,\" said Otter. \"Ah! the ways of my people are more\nsimple and better. A red spear is brighter than the red gold, yes, and\nit is more honest.\"\n\n\"The wealth is unwon, Otter, and I have sworn to win the wealth or die.\nBut last night I swore it again to him who lies dead.\"\n\n\"It is well, Baas; an oath is an oath and true men must keep it. But\nriches cannot be gathered here, for the gold, most of it, is hid in\nthose rocks that are far too heavy to carry, and who may charm gold out\nof the rock? Not all the wizards in Zululand. At the least you and I\ncannot do it alone, even should the fever spare us. We must trek, Baas,\nand look elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Listen, Otter, the tale is yet to tell. The Baas who is dead dreamed\nbefore he died, he dreamed that I should win the gold, that I should win\nit by the help of a woman, and he bade me wait here a while after he was\ndead. Say now, Otter, you who come of a people learned in dreams and\nare the child of a dream-doctor, was this a true dream or a sick man's\nfancy?\"\n\n\"Nay, Baas, who can tell for sure?\" the dwarf answered; then pondered a\nwhile, and set himself to trace lines in the dust of the floor with his\nfinger. \"Yet I say,\" he went on, \"that the words of the dead uttered on\nthe edge of death shall come true. He promised that you should win the\nwealth: you will win it by this way or that, and the great kraal across\nthe water shall be yours again, and the children of strangers shall\nwander there no more. Let us obey the words of the dead and bide here\nawhile as he commanded.\"\n\nSeven days had passed, and on the night of the seventh Leonard Outram\nand Otter sat together once more in the little cave on Grave Mountain,\nfor so they named this fatal spot. They did not speak, though each of\nthem was speaking after his own fashion, and both had cause for thought.\nThey had been hunting all day, but killed nothing except a guinea-fowl,\nmost of which they had just eaten; it was the only food left to them.\nGame seemed to have abandoned the district--at least they could find\nnone.\n\nSince his brother's death Leonard had given up all attempt to dig for\ngold--it was useless. Time hung heavy on his hands, for a man cannot\nsearch all day for buck which are not. Gloom had settled on his mind\nalso; he felt his brother's loss more acutely now than on the day he\nburied him. Moreover, for the first time he suffered from symptoms of\nthe deadly fever which had carried off his three companions. Alas!\nhe knew too well the meaning of this lassitude and nausea, and of the\nracking pain which from time to time shot through his head and limbs.\nThat was how his brother's last sickness had begun.\n\nWould his own days end in the same fashion? He did not greatly care, he\nwas reckless as to his fate, for the hard necessities of life had left\nhim little time or inclination to rack himself with spiritual doubts.\nAnd yet it was awful to think of. He rehearsed the whole scene in his\nmind again and yet again until it became a reality to him. He saw his\nown last struggle for life and Otter watching it. He saw the dwarf\nbearing him in his great arms to a lonely grave, there to cover him with\nearth, and then, with a sigh, to flee the haunted spot for ever. Why\ndid he stop to die of fever? Because his brother had bidden him to do so\nwith his dying breath; because of a superstition, a folly, which would\nmove any civilised man to scorn.\n\nAh! there was the rub, he was no longer a civilised man; he had lived so\nlong with nature and savages that he had come to be as nature makes\nthe savage. His educated reason told him that this was folly, but his\ninstinct--that faculty which had begun to take the place of educated\nreason with him--spoke in another voice. He had gone back in the scale\nof life, he had grown primitive; his mind was as the mind of a Norseman\nor of an Aztec. It did not seem wonderful to him that his brother should\nhave prophesied upon his dying bed; it did not strike him as strange\neven that he should believe in the prophecy and act upon it. And yet\nhe knew that in all probability this obedience would result in his own\ndeath.\n\nThose who have lived much with nature will in some degree be familiar\nwith such sensations, for man and nature are ever at variance, and each\nwould shape the other to its ends. In the issue nature wins. Man boasts\ncontinually of his conquests over her, her instincts, her terrors, and\nher hopes. But let him escape from out his cities and the fellowship\nof his kind, let him be alone with her for a while, and where is his\nsupremacy? He sinks back on to her breast again and is lost there as in\ntime to be all his labours shall be lost. The grass of the field and the\nsand of the desert are more powerful than Babylon; they were before her,\nthey are after her; and so it is with everything physical and moral in\ntheir degrees, for here rules a nurse whom we human children must obey\nat last, however much we may defy her.\n\nThus brooded Leonard as he sat, his hands in his pockets and an empty\npipe between his teeth. Their tobacco was done, and yet he drew at the\npipe, perhaps from habit. And all the while Otter watched him.\n\n\"Baas,\" he said at length, \"you are sick, Baas.\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered, \"that is, perhaps a little.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, a little. You have said nothing, but I know, I who watch.\nThe fever has touched you with his finger, by-and-by he will grip you\nwith his whole hand, and then, Baas----\"\n\n\"And then, Otter, good night.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, for you good night, and for me, what? Baas, you think too\nmuch and you have nothing to do, that is why you grow sick. Better that\nwe should go and dig again.\"\n\n\"What for, Otter? Ant-bear holes make good graves.\"\n\n\"Evil talk, Baas. Rather let us go away and wait no more than that you\nshould talk such talk, which is the beginning of death.\"\n\nThen there was silence for a while.\n\n\"The truth is, Otter,\" said Leonard presently, \"we are both fools. It\nis useless for us to stay here with nothing to eat, nothing to drink,\nnothing to smoke, and only the fever to look forward to, expecting we\nknow not what. But what does it matter? Fools and wise men all come to\none end. Lord! how my head aches and how hot it is! I wish that we had\nsome quinine left. I am going out,\" and he rose impatiently and left the\ncave.\n\nOtter followed him. He knew where he would go--to his brother's grave.\nPresently they were there, standing on the hither edge of a ravine. A\ncloud had hidden the face of the moon, and they could see nothing, so\nthey stood awhile idly waiting for it to pass.\n\nAs they rested thus, suddenly a moaning sound came to their ears, or\nrather a sound which, beginning with a moan, ended in a long low wail.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Leonard, looking towards the shadows on the\nfurther side of the ravine, whence the cry seemed to proceed.\n\n\"I do not know,\" answered Otter, \"unless it be a ghost, or the voice of\none who mourns her dead.\"\n\n\"We are the only mourners here,\" said Leonard, and as he spoke once more\nthe low and piercing wail thrilled upon the air. Just then the cloud\npassed, the moonlight shone out brilliantly, and they saw who it was\nthat cried aloud in this desolate place. For there, not twenty paces\nfrom them, on the other side of the ravine, crouched upon a stone and\nrocking herself to and fro as though in an agony of despair and grief,\nsat a tall and withered woman.\n\nWith an exclamation of surprise Leonard started towards her, followed by\nthe dwarf. So absorbed was the woman in her sorrow that she neither saw\nnor heard them. Even when they stood close to her she did not perceive\nthem, for her face was hidden in her bony hands. Leonard looked at her\ncuriously. She was past middle age, but he could see that once she had\nbeen handsome, and, for a native, very light in colour. Her hair was\ngrizzled and crisp rather than woolly, and her hands and feet were\nslender and finely shaped. At the moment he could discern no more of the\nwoman's personal appearance, for the face was covered, as has been said,\nand her body wrapped in a tattered blanket.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, speaking in the Sisutu dialect, \"what ails you that\nyou weep here alone?\"\n\nThe stranger let drop her hands and sprang up with a cry of fear. As it\nchanced, her gaze fell first upon the dwarf Otter, who was standing in\nfront of her, and at the sight of him the cry died upon her lips, and\nher sunken cheeks, clear-cut features, and sullen black eyes became as\nthose of one who is petrified with terror. So strange was her aspect\nindeed that the dwarf and his master neither spoke nor moved; they stood\nhushed and expectant. It was the woman who broke this silence, speaking\nin a low voice of awe and adoration and, as she spoke, sinking to her\nknees.\n\n\"And hast thou come to claim me at the last,\" she said, addressing\nOtter, \"O thou whose name is Darkness, to whom I was given in marriage,\nand from whom I fled when I was young? Do I see thee in the flesh, Lord\nof the night, King of blood and terror, and is this thy priest? Or do\nI but dream? Nay, I dream not; slay on, thou priest, and let my sin be\npurged.\"\n\n\"Here it seems,\" said Otter, \"that we have to do with one who is mad.\"\n\n\"Nay, Jal,\" the woman answered, \"I am not mad, though madness has been\nnigh to me of late.\"\n\n\"Neither am I named Jal or Darkness,\" answered the dwarf with\nirritation; \"cease to speak folly, and tell the White Lord whence you\ncome, for I weary of this talk.\"\n\n\"If you are not Jal, Black One, the thing is strange, for as Jal is so\nyou are. But perchance it does not please you, having put on the flesh,\nto avow yourself before me. At the least be it as you will. If you are\nnot Jal, then I am safe from your vengeance, and if you are Jal I pray\nyou forget the sins of my youth and spare me.\"\n\n\"Who is Jal?\" asked Leonard curiously.\n\n\"Nay, I know not,\" answered the woman, with a sudden change of manner.\n\"Hunger and weariness have turned my brain, and I spoke wandering words.\nForget them and give me food, White Man,\" she added in a piteous tone,\n\"give me food, for I starve.\"\n\n\"There is scant fare here,\" answered Leonard, \"but you are welcome to\nit. Follow me, mother,\" and he led the way across the donga to the cave,\nthe woman limping after him painfully.\n\nThere Otter gave her meat, and she ate as one eats who has gone hungry\nfor long, greedily and yet with effort. When she had finished she looked\nat Leonard with her keen dark eyes and said:\n\n\"Say, White Lord, are you also a slave-trader?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered grimly, \"I am a slave.\"\n\n\"Who is your master then--this Black One here?\"\n\n\"Nay, he is but the slave of a slave. I have no master, mother; I have a\nmistress, and she is named Fortune.\"\n\n\"The worst of mistresses,\" said the old woman, \"or the best, for she\nlaughs ever behind her frown and mingles stripes with kisses.\"\n\n\"The stripes I know well, but not the kisses,\" answered Leonard\ngloomily; then added in another tone, \"What is your errand, mother? How\nare you named, and what do you seek wandering alone in the mountains?\"\n\n\"I am named Soa, and I seek succour for one whom I love and who is in\nsore distress. Will my lord listen to my tale?\"\n\n\"Speak on,\" said Leonard.\n\nThen the woman crouched down before him and told this story.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE TALE OF SOA\n\n\"My lord, I, Soa, am the servant of a white man, a trader who lives\non the banks of the Zambesi some four days' march from hence, having a\nhouse there which he built many years ago.\"\n\n\"How is the white man named?\" asked Leonard.\n\n\"The black people call him Mavoom, but his white name is Rodd. He is a\ngood master and no common man, but he has this fault, that at times he\nis drunken. Twenty years ago or more Mavoom, my lord, married a white\nwoman, a Portuguese whose father dwelt at Delagoa Bay, and who was\nbeautiful, ah! beautiful. Then he settled on the banks of the Zambesi\nand became a trader, building the house where he is now, or rather where\nits ruins are. Here his wife died in childbirth; yes, she died in my\narms, and it was I who reared her daughter Juanna, tending her from the\ncradle to this day.\n\n\"Now, after the death of his wife Mavoom became more drunken. Still,\nwhen he is not in liquor he is very clever and a good trader, and\nseveral times he has collected ivory and feathers and gold worth much\nmoney, and also has bred cattle by hundreds. Then he would say that he\nmust leave the wilderness and go to another country across the water, I\nknow not where, that country whence the Englishmen come.\n\n\"Twice he has started to go, and I with him and his daughter Juanna, my\nmistress, who is named the Shepherdess of Heaven by the black people,\nbecause they think that she has the gift of foretelling rain. But once\nMavoom stopped in a town, at Durban in Natal, and getting drunk he\ngambled away all his money in a month, and once he lost it in a river,\nthe boat being overset by a river-horse and the ivory and gold sinking\nout of sight. Still, the last time that he started he left his daughter,\nthe Shepherdess, at Durban, and there she stayed for three years\nlearning those things that the white women know, for she is very clever,\nas clever as she is beautiful and good. Now, for nearly two years she\nhas been back at the Settlement, for she came to Delagoa Bay in a ship,\nand I with her, and Mavoom met us.\n\n\"But one month gone my mistress the Shepherdess spoke to her father\nMavoom, telling him that she wearied of their lonely life in the\nwilderness and wished to sail across the waters to the land which is\ncalled Home. He listened to her, for Mavoom loves his daughter, and said\nthat it should be so. But he said this also: that first he would go on\na trading journey up the river to buy a store of ivory of which he knew.\nNow she was against this, saying, 'Let us start at once, we have tempted\nchance too long, and once again we are rich. Let us go to Natal and pass\nover the seas.'\n\n\"Still he would not listen, for he is a headstrong man. So on the morrow\nhe started to search for the store of ivory, and the lady Juanna his\ndaughter wept, for though she is fearless, it was not fitting that she\nshould be left thus alone; also she hated to be apart from her father,\nfor it is when she is not there to watch that he becomes drunken.\n\n\"Mavoom left, and twelve days went by while I and my mistress the\nShepherdess sat at the Settlement waiting till he returned. Now it is\nthe custom of my mistress, when she is dressed, to read each morning\nfrom a certain holy book in which are written the laws of that\nGreat-Great whom she worships. On the thirteenth morning, therefore, she\nsat beneath the verandah of the house, reading in the book according to\nher custom, and I went about my work making food ready. Suddenly I heard\na tumult, and looking over the wall which is round the garden and to the\nleft of the house, I saw a great number of men, some of them white,\nsome Arab, and some half-breeds, one mounted and the others on foot,\nand behind them a long caravan of slaves with the slave-sticks set upon\ntheir necks.\n\n\"As they came these men fired guns at the people of the Settlement,\nwho ran this way and that. Some of the people fell, and more were made\ncaptive, but others of them got away, for they were at work in the\nfields and had seen the slave-traders coming.\n\n\"Now, as I gazed affrighted, I saw my mistress, the Shepherdess, flying\ntowards the wall behind which I stood, the book she was reading being\nstill in her hand. But as she reached it, the man mounted on the mule\novertook her, and she turned about and faced him, setting her back\nagainst the wall. Then I crouched down and hid myself among some\nbanana-trees, and watched what passed through a crack in the wall.\n\n\"The man on the mule was old and fat, his hair was white and his face\nyellow and wrinkled. I knew him at once, for often I have heard of him\nbefore, who has been the terror of this country for many years. He is\nnamed the Yellow Devil by the black people, but his Portuguese name is\nPereira, and he has his place in a secret spot down by one of the mouths\nof the Zambesi. Here he collects the slaves, and here the traders come\ntwice a year with their dhows to carry them to market.\n\n\"Now this man looked at my mistress as she stood terrified with her back\nagainst the wall; then he laughed and cried aloud in Portuguese, 'Here\nwe have a pretty prize. This must be that Juanna of whose beauty I have\nheard. Where is your father, my dove? Gone trading up the river, has he\nnot? Ah! I knew it, or perhaps I should not have ventured here. But it\nwas wrong of him to leave one so pretty all alone. Well, well, he is\nabout his business, and I must be about mine, for I am a merchant also,\nmy dove, a merchant who trades in blackbirds. One with silver feathers\ndoes not often come my way, and I must make the most of her. There\nis many a young man in our part who will bid briskly for such eyes as\nyours. Never fear, my dove, we will soon find you a husband.'\n\n\"Thus the Yellow Devil spoke, White Man, while the Shepherdess my\nmistress crouched against the wall and stared at him with frightened\neyes, and the slave-traders his servants laughed aloud at his evil\nwords. Presently she seemed to understand, and I saw her slowly lift her\nhand towards her head. Then I knew her purpose.\n\n\"Now, there is a certain deadly poison, White Man, of which I have\nthe secret, and that secret I taught long ago to my mistress. It is so\ndeadly that a piece of it no larger than the smallest ant can kill\na man--yes, the instant after it touches his tongue he will be dead.\nLiving alone as she does in the wilds, it is the custom of my mistress\nto carry a portion of this poison hidden in her hair, since a time might\ncome when she must use it to save herself from worse than death. Now it\nseemed to her that this hour was upon her, and I knew that she was about\nto take the poison. Then in my fear I whispered to her through the crack\nin the wall, speaking in an ancient tongue which I have taught her,\nthe tongue of my own people, White Man, and saying: 'Hold your hand,\nShepherdess; while you live you may escape, but from death there is no\nescape. It will be time to use the poison when the worst is with you.'\n\n\"She heard and understood, for I saw her bow her head slightly, and her\nhand fell to her side. Then Pereira spoke again:\n\n\"'And now, if you are ready,' he said, 'we will be moving, for it is\neight days' journey to my little Nest on the coast, and who can tell\nwhen the dhows will come to fetch my blackbirds? Have you anything to\nsay before you go, my dove?'\n\n\"Now my mistress spoke for the first time, answering, 'I am in your\npower, but I do not fear you, for if need be I can escape you. But I\ntell you this: that your wickedness shall bring your own death\nupon you;' and she glanced round at the bodies of those whom the\nslave-traders had murdered, at the captives upon whom they were setting\nchains and forks of wood, and the columns of smoke that were rising from\nher home, for the roof of the Settlement had been fired.\n\n\"For a moment the Portuguese looked frightened, then he laughed aloud\nand said with an oath, crossing himself after the fashion of his people\nas a protection against the curse, 'What! you prophesy, do you, my dove,\nand you can escape me at your will, can you? Well, we shall see. Bring\nthe other mule for this lady, you fellows.'\n\n\"The mule was brought, and Juanna, my mistress, was set upon it. Then\nthe slave-traders shot down such of the captives as they thought to be\nof no value, the drivers flogged the slaves with their three-thonged\n_sjambochs_ of hippopotamus-hide, and the caravan moved on down the\nbanks of the river.\n\n\"When all had gone I crept from my hiding-place and sought out those men\nof the Settlement who had escaped the slaughter, praying them to find\narms and follow on the Yellow Devil's spoor, waiting for an opportunity\nto rescue the Shepherdess whom they loved. But they would not do this,\nfor the heart was out of them, they were cowed by fear, and most of the\nhead-men had been taken captive. No, they would do nothing except weep\nover their dead and the burnt kraals. 'You cowards,' I said, 'if you\nwill not come, then I must go alone. At the least let some of you pass\nup the river and search for Mavoom, to tell him what has chanced here in\nhis house.'\n\n\"The men said that they would do this, and taking a blanket and a little\nfood, I followed upon the track of the slave-drivers. For four days I\nfollowed, sometimes coming in sight of them, till at length the meat was\ndone and my strength left me. On the morning of the fifth day I could\ngo no farther, so I crept to the top of a koppie and watched their long\nline winding across the plain. In its centre were two mules, and on one\nof these mules sat a woman. Then I knew that no harm had befallen my\nmistress as yet, for she still lived.\n\n\"Now from the koppie I saw a little kraal far away to the right, and to\nthis kraal I came that same afternoon with my last strength. I told its\npeople that I had escaped from the slave-drivers, and they treated me\nkindly. Here it was also I learnt that some white men from Natal were\ndigging for gold in these mountains, and next day I travelled on in\nsearch of them, thinking perchance they would help me, for I know well\nthat the English hate the slave-drivers. And here, my lord, I am come\nat last with much toil, and now I pray you deliver my mistress the\nShepherdess from the hands of the Yellow Devil. Oh! my Lord, I seem poor\nand wretched; but I tell you that if you can deliver her you shall win\na great reward. Yes, I will reveal to you that which I have kept hidden\nall my life, ay, even from Mavoom my master; _I will reveal to you the\nsecret treasures of my people, 'The Children of the Mist.'_\"\n\nNow when Leonard, who all the while had been listening attentively and\nin silence to Soa's tale, heard her last words, he raised his head and\nstared at her, thinking that her sorrows had made her mad. There was no\nlook of madness upon the woman's fierce face, however, but only one of\nthe most earnest and indeed passionate entreaty. So, letting this matter\ngo by for the while, he spoke to her:\n\n\"Are you then crazed, mother?\" he said. \"You see that I am alone here\nwith one servant, for my three companions, of whom the people in the\nkraal told you, are dead through fever, and I myself am smitten with it.\nAnd yet you ask me, alone as I am, to travel to this slave-trader's camp\nthat is you know not where, and there, single-handed, to rescue your\nmistress, if indeed you have a mistress, and your tale is true. Are you\nthen mad, mother?\"\n\n\"No, Lord, I am not mad, and that which I tell you is true, every\nword of it. I know that I ask a great thing, but I know also that you\nEnglishmen can do great things when you are well paid. Strive to help\nme and you shall have your reward. Ay, should you fail, and live, I can\nstill give you a reward; not much perhaps, but more than you have ever\nearned.\"\n\n\"Never mind the reward now, mother,\" broke in Leonard testily, for the\nveiled sarcasm of Soa's speech had stung him, \"unless, indeed, you can\ncure me of the fever,\" he added with a laugh.\n\n\"I can do that,\" she answered quietly; \"to-morrow morning I will cure\nyou.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" he said, with an incredulous smile. \"And now of\nyour wisdom tell me how am I to look for your mistress, to say nothing\nof rescuing her, when I do not know whither she has been taken? Probably\nthis Nest of which the Portugee talked is a secret place. How long has\nshe been carried off?\"\n\n\"This will be the twelfth day, Lord. As for the Nest, it is secret; that\nI have discovered. It is to your wisdom that I look to find it.\"\n\nLeonard mused awhile, then a thought struck him. Turning to the dwarf,\nwho had been sitting by listening to all that was said in stolid\nsilence, his great head resting upon his knees, he spoke to him in\nDutch:\n\n\"Otter, were you not once taken as a slave?\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, once, ten years ago.\"\n\n\"How was it?\"\n\n\"Thus Baas. I was hunting on the Zambesi with the soldiers of a tribe\nthere--it was after my own people had driven me out because they said\nthat I was too ugly to become their chief, as I was born to be. Then the\nYellow Devil, that same man of whom the woman speaks, fell upon us with\nArabs, and took us to his place, there to await the slave-dhows. He was\na stout man, horrible to see, and elderly. The day the dhows came in I\nescaped by swimming; and all the others who remained alive were taken\noff in ships to Zanzibar.\"\n\n\"Could you find your way to that place again, Otter?\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas. It is a hard spot to find, for the path runs through\nmorasses; moreover the place is secret and protected by water. All of us\nslaves were blindfolded during the last day's march. But I worked up\nmy bandage with my nose--ah! my big nose served me well that day--and\nwatched the path from beneath it, and Otter never forgets a road over\nwhich his feet have travelled. Also I followed that path back.\"\n\n\"Could you find the spot from here?\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas. I should go along these mountains, ten days' journey or\nmore, till we struck the southernmost mouth of the Zambesi below Luabo.\nThen I should follow the river down a day's journey. Afterwards two\nor more days through the swamps and we come to the place. But it is\na strong place, Baas, and there are many men armed with guns in it;\nmoreover, there is a big cannon, a 'by-and-by'!\"\n\nAgain Leonard thought a moment, then he turned to Soa and asked, \"Do you\nunderstand Dutch? No? Well I have found out something of this Nest\nfrom my servant. Pereira said that it was eight days' journey from your\nmaster's settlement, so your mistress has been there some three or four\ndays if she ever reached it. Now, from what I know of the habits of\nslave-traders on this coast, the dhows will not begin to take in their\ncargoes for another month, because of the monsoon. Therefore, if I am\ncorrect, there is plenty of time. Mind you, Mother, I am not saying\nthat I will have anything to do with this business; I must think it over\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Yes, you will, White Man,\" she answered, \"when you know the reward; but\nof that I will tell you to-morrow, after I have cured you of your fever.\nAnd now I pray, Black One, show me a place where I may sleep, for I am\nvery weary.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nLEONARD SWEARS ON THE BLOOD OF ACA\n\nOn the morrow Leonard woke early from a troubled sleep, for his fever\nwould scarcely let him rest. But, early as it was, the woman Soa had\nbeen up before him, and on coming out of the cave the first thing that\nhe saw was her tall shape bending over a little fire, whereon a gourd\nwas boiling, the contents of which she stirred from time to time.\n\n\"Good morning to you, White Man,\" she said; \"here is that which shall\ncure you of your sickness as I promised to do;\" and she lifted the gourd\nfrom the fire.\n\nLeonard took it and sniffed at the liquor, which smelt abominably.\n\n\"It is more likely to poison me, mother,\" he said.\n\n\"No, no,\" she answered with a smile; \"drink half of it now and half at\nmidday, and the fever shall trouble you no more.\"\n\nSo soon as the stuff was cool enough Leonard obeyed, though with a\ndoubting heart.\n\n\"Well, mother,\" he said, setting the gourd down with a gasp, \"if\nnastiness is any proof of virtue your medicine should be good.\"\n\n\"It is good,\" she answered gravely; \"many have been dragged from the\nedge of death by it.\"\n\nAnd here it may be stated, whether it was owing to Soa's medicine or to\nother causes, that Leonard began to mend from that hour. By nightfall he\nfelt a different man, and before three days were over he was as strong\nas he had ever been in his life. But into the ingredients of the draught\nhe never found the courage to inquire, and perhaps it was as well.\n\nShortly after he had taken his dose Leonard observed Otter walking up\nthe hill, bearing a huge lump of meat upon his shoulders.\n\n\"The old woman has brought us luck,\" said the dwarf as he loosed himself\nfrom his burden. \"Once more the bush is full of game; scarcely had I\nreached it when I killed a young koodoo, fat, ah! fat, and there are\nmany of them about.\"\n\nThen they prepared breakfast, and ate it, and when the meal was done\nonce more they talked.\n\n\"Mother,\" began Leonard, \"last night you asked me to undertake a\ngreat venture, and promised a reward in payment. Now, as you said, we\nEnglishmen will do much for gold, and I am a poor man who seeks wealth.\nYou demand of me that I should risk my life; now tell me of its price.\"\n\nThe woman Soa looked at him awhile, and answered:\n\n\"White Man, have you ever heard of the People of the Mist?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"that is, except in London. I mean that I know nothing of\nsuch a people. What of them?\"\n\n\"This: I, Soa, am one of that people. I was the daughter of their\nhead-priest, and I fled from them many many years ago, because I was\ndoomed to be offered up as a sacrifice to the god Jal, he who is shaped\nlike the Black One yonder,\" and she pointed to Otter.\n\n\"This is rather interesting,\" said Leonard; \"go on.\"\n\n\"White Man, that people is a great people. They live in a region of\nmist, upon high lands beneath the shadow of the tops of snow mountains.\nThey are larger than other men in size, and very cruel, but their women\nare fair. Now of the beginning of my people I know nothing, for it is\nlost in the past. But they worship an ancient stone statue fashioned\nlike a dwarf, and to him they offer the blood of men. Beneath the feet\nof the statue is a pool of water, and beyond the pool is a cave. In that\ncave, White Man, he dwells whom they adore in effigy above, he, Jal,\nwhose name is Terror.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that a dwarf lives in the cave?\" asked Leonard.\n\n\"No, White Man, not a dwarf, but a holy crocodile which they name the\nSnake, the biggest crocodile in the whole world, and the oldest, for he\nhas dwelt there from the beginning. It is this Snake that devours the\nbodies of those who are offered to the Black One.\"\n\n\"As I remarked before,\" said Leonard, \"all this is very romantic and\ninteresting, but I cannot see that there is much profit to be made out\nof it.\"\n\n\"White Man, the lives of men are not the only things which the priests\nof the Children of the Mist offer to their god; they offer also such\ntoys as _this_, White Man,\" and suddenly she unclosed her hand and\nexhibited to Leonard's astonished gaze a ruby, or what appeared to be\na ruby, of such size and so lovely a colour, that his eyes were dazzled\nwhen he looked at it. The gem, though roughly polished, was uncut, but\nits dimensions were those of a small blackbird's egg, it was of the\npurest pigeon-blood colour, without a flaw, and worn almost round,\napparently by the action of water. Now, as it chanced, Leonard knew\nsomething of gems, although unhappily he was less acquainted with the\npeculiarities of the ruby than with those of most other stones. Thus,\nalthough this magnificent specimen might be a true stone, as indeed\nappeared to be the case, it was quite possible that it was only a\nspinel, or a garnet, and alas! he had no means of setting his doubts at\nrest.\n\n\"Do your people find many of these pebbles, Soa?\" he asked, \"and if so,\nwhere do they find them?\"\n\n\"Yes, White Man, they find many, though few of such a size as this.\nThey dig them out of a dry river-bed in some spot that is known to the\npriests only, and with them other beautiful stones of a blue colour.\"\n\n\"Sapphires probably,\" said Leonard to himself: \"they generally go\ntogether.\"\n\n\"Every year they dig them,\" she went on, \"and the biggest of those that\nare found in their digging they bind upon the brow of her who is to be\noffered as a wife to the god Jal. Afterwards, before she dies, they take\nthe gem from her brow and store it in a secret place, and there in that\nsecret place are hidden all those that have been worn by the victims of\ncountless years. Moreover the eyes of Jal are made of such stones, and\nthere are others.\n\n\"This is the legend of my people, White Man, that Jal, God of Death and\nEvil, slew his mother, Aca, in the far past. There where the stones are\nfound he slew her, and the red gems are her blood, and the blue gems are\nher tears which she shed praying to him for mercy. Therefore the blood\nof Aca is offered to Jal, and so it shall be offered till Aca comes\nagain to drive his worship from the land.\"\n\n\"A nice bit of mythology, I am sure,\" said Leonard. \"Our old friends the\nDarkness and the Dawn in an African shape, I suppose. But listen to me,\nmother. This stone, if it is genuine, is worth many ounces of gold, but\nthere are other stones so like it that none who are not learned can tell\nthe difference, and if it be one of these it is of little value. Still\nit may happen that this, and the others of which you speak, are true\nrubies; at any rate I should be willing to take my chance of that. But\nnow, tell me, what is your plan? This is a very pretty story, and the\nrubies may be there, but how am I to get them?\"\n\n\"I have a plan, White Man,\" she answered. \"If you will help me, I offer\nto give you that stone, which I have borne hidden about me for many\nyears, tellings its story to none, no, not even to Mavoom. I offer\nto give it to you now if you will promise to attempt the rescue of my\nmistress, for I know by your eyes that if once you promise you will not\ndesert the quest;\" and she paused, looking at him keenly.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Leonard, \"but considering the risks the price does not\nseem quite good enough. As I told you, this stone may be worth nothing:\nyou must make a better bid, mother.\"\n\n\"Truly, White Man, I have judged you well,\" answered Soa with a sneer;\n\"also you are wise: little work for little wage. Listen now, this is the\npay I proffer you.\n\n\"If you succeed, and the Shepherdess is saved alive from the grip of the\nYellow Devil, I promise this on her behalf and on my own: that I will\nguide you to the land of the People of the Mist, and show you a way\nto win for yourself all those other countless stones that are hidden\nthere.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Leonard, \"but why do you promise on behalf of your mistress\nand yourself? What has she got to do with it?\"\n\n\"Without her nothing can be done, White Man. This people is great and\nstrong, and we have no force with which to conquer them in war. Here\ncraft must be your spear.\"\n\n\"You must speak more clearly, Soa. I cannot waste time in guessing\nriddles. How will you conquer this people by craft, and what has Miss\nRodd, whom you name the Shepherdess, to do with the matter?\"\n\n\"That you shall learn by-and-by, after you have rescued her, White Man;\ntill then my lips are shut. I tell you that I have a plan, and this must\nbe enough, for more I will not say. If you are not content, let me go to\nseek help elsewhere.\"\n\nLeonard thought a moment, and seeing that she was determined not to be\nmore explicit, said:\n\n\"Very well, then. And now how am I to know that your mistress will fall\nin with this scheme?\"\n\n\"I answer for her,\" said Soa, \"she will never go back upon my word. Look\nyou, White Man, it is not for a little thing that I would have told you\nthis tale. If you journey to the land of the People of the Mist, I must\ngo with you, and there, should I be discovered, my death waits me. I\ntell you the tale, or some of it, and I offer you the bribe because\nI see that you need money, and I am sure that without the chance of\nwinning money you will not hazard your life in this desperate search.\nBut I love my mistress so well that I am ready to hazard mine; ay, I\nwould give six lives, if I had them, to save her from the shame of the\nslave. Now, White Man, we have talked enough; is it a bargain?\"\n\n\"What do you say, Otter?\" asked Leonard, thoughtfully pulling at his\nbeard, \"you have heard all this wonderful tale and you are clever.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas,\" said the dwarf, speaking for the first time, \"I have heard\nthe tale, and as for being clever, perhaps I am and perhaps I am not. My\npeople said that I was clever, and that is one of the reasons why they\nwould not have me for a chief. If I had been clever only, they could\nhave borne it, they said, or if I had been ugly only, but being both\nugly and clever I was no chief for them. They feared lest I should rule\nthem too well and make all the people to be born ugly also. Ah! they\nwere fools; they did not understand that it wants someone cleverer than\nI to make people so ugly.\"\n\n\"Never mind all that,\" said Leonard, who understood however that the\ndwarf was talking thus in order to give himself time to think before he\nanswered. \"Show me your mind, Otter.\"\n\n\"Baas, what can I say? I know nothing of the value of that red stone.\nI do not know whether this woman, of whom my heart tells me no good,\nspeaks truth or lies about a distant people who live in a fog and\nworship a god shaped as I am. None have ever worshipped me, yet there\nmay be a land where I should be deemed worthy of worship, and if so\nI should like to travel in that land. But as to the rescue of this\nShepherdess from the Nest of the Yellow Devil, I do not know how it can\nbe brought about. Say, mother, how many of the men of Mavoom were taken\nprisoners with your mistress?\"\n\n\"Fifty of them perchance,\" answered Soa.\n\n\"Well now,\" went on the dwarf, \"if we could loose those men and if they\nare brave we might do something, but there are many _if's_ about it,\nBaas. Still if you think the pay is good enough we can try. It will be\nbetter than sitting here, and it does not matter what happens. Every man\nto his fate, Baas, and fate to every man.\"\n\n\"A good motto,\" said Leonard. \"Soa, I take your offer, though I am a\nfool for my pains. And now, with your leave, we will put the matter\ninto writing so that there may be no mistake about it afterwards. Get a\nlittle blood from the buck's flesh, Otter, and mix gunpo water with it;\nthat will do for ink if we add some hot water.\"\n\nWhile the dwarf was compounding this ominous mixture Leonard sought of\npaper. He could find none; the last had been lost when the hut was blown\naway on the night of his brother's death. Then he bethought him of\nthe prayer-book which Jane Beach had given him. He would not use the\nfly-leaf, because her name was on it, so he must write across the\ntitle-page. And thus he wrote in small, neat letters with his mixture of\nblood and gunpowder straight through the _Order of Common Prayer_:--\n\n\"_Agreement between Leonard Outram and Soa, the native woman._\n\n\"I. The said Leonard Outram agrees to use his best efforts to rescue\nJuanna, the daughter of Mr. Rodd, now reduced to a state of slavery and\nbelieved to be in the power of one Pereira, a slave-dealer.\n\n\"II. In consideration of the services of the said Leonard Outram, the\nsaid Soa delivers to him a certain stone believed to be a ruby, of which\nthe said Leonard Outram hereby acknowledges the receipt.\n\n\"III. Should the rescue be effected, the said Soa hereby agrees, on\nbehalf of herself and the said Juanna Rodd, to conduct the said Leonard\nOutram to a certain spot in central South Eastern Africa, inhabited by\na tribe known as the People of the Mist, there to reveal to him and to\nhelp him to gain possession of the store of rubies used in the religious\nceremonies of the said tribe. Further, the said Soa agrees, on behalf of\nthe said Juanna Rodd, that she, the said Juanna, will accompany her upon\nthe journey, and will play among the said People of the Mist any\npart that may be required of her as necessary to the success of this\nundertaking.\n\n\"IV. It is mutually agreed that these enterprises be prosecuted until\nthe said Leonard Outram is satisfied that they are fruitless.\n\n\"Signed in the Manica Mountains, Eastern Africa, on the ninth day of May\n18--.\"\n\n\nWhen he had finished this document, perhaps one of the most remarkable\nthat were ever written since Pizarro drew up his famous agreement for\nthe division of the prospective spoils of Peru, Leonard read it aloud\nand laughed heartily to himself. It was the first time that he had\nlaughed for some months. Then he translated it to his companions, not\nwithout complaisancy, for it had a truly legal sound, and your layman\nloves to affect the lawyer.\n\n\"What do you think of that, Otter?\" he asked when he had finished.\n\n\"It is fine, Baas, very fine,\" answered the dwarf. \"Wonderful are the\nways of the white man! But, Baas, how can the old woman promise things\non behalf of another?\"\n\nLeonard pulled his beard reflectively. The dwarf had put his finger\nupon the weak spot in the document. But he was saved the necessity of\nanswering by Soa herself, who said quietly, \"Have no fear, White Man;\nthat which I promise in her name, my mistress will certainly perform,\nif so be that you can save her. Give me the pen that I may make my mark\nupon the paper. But first do you swear upon the red stone that you will\nperform what you undertake in this writing.\"\n\nSo Leonard laughed, swore, and signed, and Soa made her mark. Then\nOtter affixed his, as witness to the deed, and the thing was finished.\nLaughing again at the comicality of the transaction, which indeed he had\ncarried out more by way of joke than for any other reason, Leonard put\nthe prayer-book in his pocket and the great ruby into a division of\nhis belt. The old woman watched the stone vanish with an expression of\ntriumph on her face, then she cried exultingly:\n\n\"Ah! White Man, you have taken my pay, and now you are my servant to the\nend. He who swears upon the blood of Aca swears an oath indeed, and woe\nbe to him if he should break it.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" answered Leonard; \"I have taken your pay and I mean to earn\nit, so we need not enter into the matter of the blood of Aca. It seems\nto me more probable that our own blood will be in question before all is\nsaid and done. And now we had better make ready to start.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE START\n\nFood was their first consideration, and to provide it Leonard bade Otter\ncut the lump of raw meat into strips and set them upon the rocks to dry\nin the broiling sun. Then they sorted their goods and selected such of\nthem as they could carry.\n\nAlas! they were but few. A blanket apiece--a spare pair of boots\napiece--some calomel and sundries from the medicine-chest--a shot gun\nand the two best rifles and ammunition--a compass, a water bottle,\nthree knives, a comb, and a small iron cooking-pot made up the total--a\nconsiderable weight for two men and a woman to drag across mountains,\nuntravelled plains, and swamps. This baggage was divided into three\nloads, of which Soa's was the lightest, and that of Otter weighed as\nmuch as the other two put together.\n\n\"It was nothing,\" he said, \"he could carry the three if need were;\" and\nso great was the dwarf's strength that Leonard knew this to be no idle\nboast.\n\nAt length all was prepared, and the articles that remained were buried\nin the cave together with the mining tools. It was not likely that they\nwould ever return to seek them; more probably they will lie there till,\nthousands of years hence, they are dug up and become priceless relics\nof the Anglo-African age. Still they hid them on the chance. Leonard had\nmelted the fruits of their mining into little ingots. In all there were\nabout a hundred ounces of almost pure gold--the price of three men's\nlives! Half of these ingots he placed with the ruby in the belt about\nhis middle, and half he gave to Otter, who hid them in his bundle.\nLeonard's first idea was to leave the bullion, because it entailed the\ncarrying of extra weight; but he remembered in time that gold is\nalways useful, and nowhere more so than among Portuguese and Arab\nslave-drivers.\n\nBy evening everything was ready, and when the edge of the moon showed\nabove the horizon, Leonard rose, and lifting his load, fastened it upon\nhis shoulders with the loops of hide which had been prepared, Otter and\nSoa following his example. It was their plan to travel by night so long\nas the state of the moon served them, for thus they would escape the\nterrible heat and lessen the danger of being observed.\n\n\"Follow me in a few minutes,\" said Leonard to Otter; \"you will find me\nby the donga.\"\n\nThe dwarf nodded. A quarter of an hour later he started also with Soa\nand found his master standing bareheaded by his brother's grave, taking\na mute farewell of that which lay beneath before he left it for ever to\nits long sleep in the untrodden wilderness. It was a melancholy parting,\nbut there have been many such in the African fever belt.\n\nWith one last look Leonard turned and joined his companions. Then,\nhaving taken counsel with them and with the compass, he set his face to\nthe mountain and his heart to the new adventures, hopes, and fears that\nwere beyond it. The past was done with, it lay buried in yonder grave,\nbut by the mercy of God he was still a man, living beneath the sunlight,\nand the future stretched away before him. What would it bring? He cared\nlittle; experience had taught him the futility of anxieties as to\nthe future. Perchance a grave like those which he had left, perchance\nwealth, love, and honour. Whatever the event he would strive to meet\nit with patience, dignity, and resignation. It was not his part to ask\nquestions or to reason why; it was his part to struggle on and take such\nguerdon as it pleased Providence to send him.\n\nThus thought Leonard, and this is the right spirit for an adventurer to\ncultivate. It is the right spirit in which to meet the good and ill of\nlife--that greatest of adventures which every one of us must dare. He\nwho meets them thus and holds his heart pure and his hands clean will\nlay himself down to sleep without a sigh or a regret when mountain,\nswamp, river, and forest all are travelled, and the unknown innumerable\ntreasure, buried from the olden time far out of reach of man's sight and\nknowledge, at last is opened to his gaze.\n\nSo Leonard started, and his hopes were high notwithstanding the\ndesperate nature of their undertaking. For here it must be confessed\nthat the undesirable element of superstition still held fast upon his\nmind, and now with some slight cause. Had not his brother spoken of\nwealth that he should win by the aid of a woman? And had not a woman\ncome to him, bearing in her hand a jewel which, if real, was in itself\nworth a moderate fortune; promising also, with the help of another\nwoman, to lead him to a land where many such might be found? Yes, these\nthings were so, and it may be pardoned to Leonard if, setting aside the\ntheory of coincidence, he began to believe that the end would be as the\nbeginning had been, that the great adventure would be achieved and the\nwealth be won.\n\nWe shall not need to follow the footsteps of Leonard Outram and his\ncompanions day by day. For a week they travelled on, journeying mostly\nby night as they had proposed. They climbed mountains, they struggled\nthrough swamps and forests, they swam rivers. Indeed one of these was in\nflood, and they never could have crossed it had it not been for Otter's\npowers of natation. Six times did the dwarf face the torrent, bearing\ntheir goods and guns held above the water with one hand. On the seventh\njourney he was still more heavily weighted, for, with some assistance\nfrom Leonard, he must carry the woman Soa, who could swim but little.\nBut he did it, and without any great fatigue. It was not until Otter was\nseen stemming a heavy current that his vast strength could be measured.\nHere, indeed, his stunted stature was a positive advantage, for it\noffered the less surface for the water to act upon.\n\nSo they travelled forward, sometimes hungry, sometimes full of meat,\nand even of what were better, of milk and corn. For the country was not\nentirely deserted; occasionally they came to scattered kraals, and were\nable to obtain provisions from their peaceful inhabitants in return for\nsome such trifle as an empty cartridge of brass. At first Leonard was\nafraid lest Soa should tire, but notwithstanding her years and the\nhardships and sufferings which she had undergone, she showed wonderful\nendurance--endurance so wonderful that he came to the conclusion that\nit was her spirit which supported the frailty of her body, and the\never-present desire to rescue one whom she loved as a surly dog\nsometimes loves its master. However this might be, she pushed forward\nwith the rest, rarely speaking except to urge them onwards.\n\nOn the eighth night of their journey they halted upon the crest of a\nhigh mountain. The moon had set, and it was impossible to go further;\nmoreover, they were weary with long marching. Wrapping themselves up\nin their blankets--for here the air was piercingly cold--they lay down\nbeneath the shelter of some bushes to sleep till dawn. It was Otter who\nwoke them. \"Look, Baas,\" he said to Leonard, \"we have marched straight.\nThere below us is the big river, and there far to the right is the sea.\"\n\nThey looked. Some miles from them, across the great plain of bush that\nmerged gradually into swamp, lay that branch of the Zambesi which they\nwould reach. They could not see it, indeed, for its face was hid by a\ndense cloak of soft white mist that covered it like a cloud. But there\nit was, won at last, and there away to the eastward shone the wide\nglitter of the sea, flecked with faint lines of broken billows whence\nthe sun rose in glory.\n\n\"See, Baas,\" said Otter, when they had satisfied themselves with\nthe beautiful sight, \"yonder, some five hours' march from here, the\nmountains curve down to the edge of the river. Thither we must go, for\nit is on the further side of those hills that the great swamp lies where\nthe Yellow Devil has his place. I know the spot well; I have passed it\ntwice.\"\n\nThey rested till noonday; but that night, before the moon rose, they\nstood on the curve of the mountain, close down to the water's edge. At\nlength she came up, and showed them a wonderful scene of desolation.\nBeyond the curve of hills the mountains trended out again to the south,\ngradually growing lower till at last they melted into the skyline.\nIn the vast semicircle thus formed ran the river, spotted with green\nislands, while between it and the high ground, over a space which varied\nfrom one mile at the narrowest to twenty miles in width at the broadest\nof the curve, was spread a huge and dismal swamp, marked by patches of\nstagnant water, clothed with reeds which grew to the height of small\ntrees, and exhaling a stench as of the rottenness of ages.\n\nThe loneliness of the place was dreadful, its waste and desolation were\nappalling. And yet it lived with a life of its own. Wild fowl flew in\nwedges from the sea to feed in its recesses, alligators and hippopotami\nsplashed in the waters, bitterns boomed among the rushes, and from every\npool and quagmire came the croaking of a thousand frogs.\n\n\"Yonder runs the slave road, or yonder it once ran,\" said Otter,\npointing to the foot of a hill.\n\n\"Let us go and see,\" answered Leonard; \"we can follow it for a while and\ncamp.\"\n\nThey climbed down the hill. At its foot Otter cast backwards and\nforwards among the bushes like a hound. Then he held up his hand and\nwhistled.\n\n\"I thought so,\" he said, as the others drew near; \"the path is still the\nsame. Look, Baas.\"\n\nAs he spoke he broke down the branches of a creeping bush with his\nstrong foot. Among them lay the mouldering skeleton of a woman, and by\nher side that of a child.\n\n\"Not long dead,\" said Otter phlegmatically, \"perhaps two weeks. Ah! the\nYellow Devil leaves a spoor that all may follow.\"\n\nSoa bent over the bones and examined them. \"One of Mavoom's people,\" she\nsaid; \"I know the fashion of the anklets.\"\n\nThen they marched on for two hours or more, till at length they came to\na spot where the trail ran to the edge of the water and stopped.\n\n\"What now, Otter?\" said Leonard.\n\n\"Here the slaves are put on boats, Baas,\" the dwarf answered. \"The boats\nshould be hidden yonder,\" and he pointed to some thick reeds. \"There too\nthey 'weed the corn,' killing out the weakly ones, that they may not be\nburdened with them. Let us go and look.\"\n\nThey went, Otter leading the way. Presently he halted. \"The boats are\ngone,\" he said, \"all except one canoe; but the 'weeds' lie in a heap as\nof old.\"\n\nHe was right. Piled in a little open space lay the bodies of some thirty\nmen, women, and children recently dead. In other spaces close by were\nsimilar heaps, but these were of bleached bones on which the moonlight\nshone brightly--mementoes of former sacrifices. Quite close to the first\npile of dead was a mooring-place where at least a dozen flat-bottomed\nboats had been secured, for their impress could yet be seen in the\nsand. Now they were gone with the exception of the canoe, which was kept\nthere, evidently to facilitate the loading and launching of the large\nboats.\n\nNobody made any comment. The sight was beyond comment, but a fierce\ndesire rose in Leonard's heart to come face to face with this \"Yellow\nDevil\" who fattened on the blood and agony of helpless human beings, and\nto avenge them if he might.\n\n\"The light is going, we must camp here till the morning,\" he said after\na while.\n\nAnd there they camped in this Golgotha, this place of bones, every one\nof which cried to heaven for vengeance.\n\nThe night wind swept over them whispering in the giant reeds, fashioning\nthe mists into fantastic shapes that threw strange shadows on the inky\nsurface of the water as it crept slowly to the sea. From time to time\nthe frogs broke into a sudden chorus of croaking, then grew silent\nagain; the heron cried from afar as some alligator or river-horse\ndisturbed its rest, and from high in air came the sound of the wings of\nwild-fowl that travelled to the ocean. But to Leonard's fancy all these\nvarious voices of nature were as one voice that spoke from the piles of\nskeletons gleaming faintly in the uncertain starlight and cried, \"Oh!\nGod, how long shall iniquity have power on the earth? Oh! God, how long\nshall thy Hand be stayed?\"\n\nThe darkness passed, the sun shone out merrily, and the travellers\narose, brushed the night-dew from their hair, and ate a scanty meal, for\nthey must husband such food as they had with them. Then, as though by\ncommon consent, they went to the canoe, bailed her out, and started,\nLeonard and Otter using the paddles.\n\nNow it was that the dwarf's marvellous memory for locality came into\nplay. Without him they could not have gone a mile, for their course ran\nthrough numberless lagoons and canals, cut by nature and the current\nin the dense banks of reeds. There was nothing to enable them to\ndistinguish one of these canals from another; in truth they all formed\na portion of this mouth of the river. There were no landmarks to guide\nthem; everywhere spread a sea of swamp diversified by rush-clothed\nislands, which to the inexperienced eye presented few points of\ndifference. This was the road that Otter led them on unfalteringly; ten\nyears had passed since he had travelled it, but he never even hesitated.\nTime upon time they came to new openings in the reeds leading this way\nand that. Then for a moment the dwarf would consider, and, lifting his\nhand, point out which water-way they should choose, and they followed\nit.\n\nThus they went on for the most part of that day, till towards evening\nthey reached a place where the particular canal that they were following\nsuddenly divided itself into two, one branch running north and one in a\nsoutherly direction.\n\n\"Which way, Otter?\" asked Leonard.\n\n\"Nay, Baas, I know not. The water has changed; there was no land here,\nthe cut went straight on.\"\n\nThis was a serious matter, for one false step in such a labyrinth meant\nthat they would be lost utterly. For long they debated which stream\nto take, and at last decided to try that on the left hand, which Otter\nthought ran more nearly in the true direction. They had already started\nin pursuance of his advice when Soa, who had remained silent hitherto,\nsuggested that they should first go a little way down the right-hand\nstream on the chance of finding a clue. Leonard demurred, but as the\nwoman seemed bent upon it, he yielded, and turning the boat they paddled\nher some three hundred yards in this new direction. As there was nothing\nto be seen, however, Otter began to put her about again.\n\n\"Stay, White Man,\" said Soa, who had been searching the surface of the\nwater with her quick eyes, \"what is that thing yonder?\" and she pointed\nto a clump of reeds about forty yards away, among which some small white\nobject was just discernible.\n\n\"Feathers, I think,\" Leonard answered, \"but we will go and see.\" In\nanother moment they were there.\n\n\"It is paper, Baas,\" said Otter in a low voice, \"paper stuck on a reed.\"\n\n\"Lift it carefully,\" answered Leonard in the same tone, for his anxiety\nwas keen. How came it that they found paper fixed to a reed in such a\nplace as this?\n\nOtter obeyed, laying the sodden sheet on the thwart of the canoe before\nLeonard, who with Soa examined it closely.\n\n\"This is a leaf from that holy book in which my mistress reads,\" said\nthe woman with conviction; \"I know the shape of it well. She has torn\nthe paper out and affixed it on the reed as a sign to any who might come\nafter her.\"\n\n\"It looks like it,\" said Leonard; \"that was a good thought of yours to\nturn up here, old lady.\" Then he bent down and read such verses as were\nstill legible on the page; they ran thus:\n\n\"For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven\ndid the Lord behold the earth;\"\n\n\"To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed\nto death;\"\n\n\"The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be\nestablished before thee.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said Leonard to himself, \"the quotation seems very appropriate.\nIf one had faith in omens now, a man might say that this was a good\none.\" And in his heart he believed it to be so.\n\nAnother hour's journey brought them to the point of the island along\nwhich they had been travelling.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Otter, \"now I know the path again. This is the right stream,\nthat to the left must be a new one. Had we taken it we should have lost\nour way, and perhaps have found it no more for days, or not at all.\"\n\n\"Say, Otter,\" said Leonard, \"you escaped from this slave-camp. How did\nyou do it--in a boat?\"\n\n\"No, Baas. The Baas knows that I am strong, my Spirit who gave me\nugliness gave me strength also to make up for it, and it is well, for\nhad I been beautiful as you are, Baas, and not very strong, I should\nhave been a slave now, or dead. With my chained hands I choked him who\nwas set to watch me, and took his knife. Then by my strength I broke the\nirons--see, Baas, here are the scars of them to this day. When I broke\nthem they cut into my flesh, but they were old irons that had been on\nmany slaves, so I mastered them. Then as others came to kill me I threw\nmyself into the water and dived, and they never saw me more. Afterwards\nI swam all the way, resting from time to time on the islands and from\ntime to time running along the shore where the reeds were not too thick,\ntill at length I escaped into the open country. I travelled four days to\nreach it, and most of that time I was in the water.\"\n\n\"And what did you feed on?\"\n\n\"Roots and the eggs of birds.\"\n\n\"And did not the alligators try to eat you?\"\n\n\"Yes, one, Baas, but I am quick in the water. I got upon the\nwater-snake's back--ah! my Spirit was with me then--and I drove the\nknife through his eye into his brain. Then I smeared myself over with\nhis blood, and after that they did not touch me, for they knew the smell\nand thought that I was their brother.\"\n\n\"Say, Otter, are you not afraid of going back to this place?\"\n\n\"Somewhat, Baas, for there is that hell of which you white people talk.\nBut where the Baas goes there I can go also; Otter will not linger while\nyou run. Also, Baas, I am not brave, no, no, yet I would look upon that\nYellow Devil again, yes, if I myself must die to do it, and kill him\nwith these hands.\"\n\nAnd the dwarf dropped the paddle screaming \"Kill him! kill him! kill\nhim!\" so loudly that the birds rose in affright from the marshes.\n\n\"Be quiet,\" said Leonard angrily; \"do you want to bring the Arabs on\nus?\"\n\nBut to himself he thought that he should be sorry for Pereira, alias the\n\"Yellow Devil,\" if once Otter found a chance to fly at his throat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE YELLOW DEVIL'S NEST\n\nSundown came, and, as on the previous night, the three travellers\ncamped upon an island waiting for the moon to rise. They had caught two\nflapper-ducks in some weeds, and there was a talk of lighting a fire to\ncook them by. Finally Leonard negatived this idea. \"It is dangerous,\"\nhe said, \"for fires can be seen from afar.\" So they made a wretched meal\noff a little dried meat and some raw duck's eggs.\n\nIt was fortunate that his caution prevailed, since, as the twilight\nwas dying into dark, they heard the stroke of paddles and made out the\nshapes of canoes passing them. There were several canoes, each of which\ntowed something behind it, and the men in them shouted to one another\nfrom time to time, now in Portuguese and now in Arabic.\n\n\"Lie still, lie still,\" whispered Otter, \"these are the slave-men taking\nback the big boats.\"\n\nLeonard and Soa followed his advice to the letter, and the slavers,\npaddling furiously up stream, passed within thirty feet of where they\ncrouched in the rushes.\n\n\"Give way, comrades,\" called one man to the captain of the next canoe;\n\"the landing-place is near, and there is rum for those who earn it.\"\n\n\"I hope that they will not stop here,\" said Leonard beneath his breath.\n\n\"Hist!\" answered Otter, \"I hear them landing.\"\n\nHe was right; the party had disembarked about two hundred yards away.\nPresently they heard them collecting reeds for burning, and in ten\nminutes more two bright tongues of flame showed that they had lit their\nfires.\n\n\"We had better get out of this,\" said Leonard; \"if they discover us----\"\n\n\"They will not discover us, Baas, if we lie still,\" answered Otter; \"let\nus wait awhile. I have another plan. Listen, Baas.\" And he whispered in\nhis ear.\n\nSo they waited. From the fires below them came the sound of men eating\nand drinking--especially drinking. An hour passed, and Leonard rose,\nfollowed by Otter, who said:\n\n\"I will come too, Baas; I can move like a cat.\"\n\n\"Where are you going, White Man?\" asked Soa.\n\n\"I am going to spy upon those men. I understand Portuguese, and wish to\nhear what they say. Otter, take your knife and revolver, but no gun.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said the woman, \"but be careful. They are very clever.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" put in Otter, \"but the Baas is clever also, and I, I am\nclever. Do not fear for us, mother.\"\n\nThen they started, creeping cautiously through the reeds. When they were\nwithin twenty yards of the fires, Leonard missed his footing and fell\ninto a pool of water with a splash. Some of the slave-dealers heard\nthe noise and sprang to their feet. Instantly Otter grunted in exact\nimitation of a hippopotamus-calf.\n\n\"A sea-cow,\" said a man in Portuguese. \"She won't hurt us. The fire will\nfrighten her.\"\n\nLeonard and Otter waited awhile, then crept to a clump of reeds whence\nthey could hear every word that was spoken. The men round the fire\nnumbered twenty-two. One, their leader, appeared to be a pure-bred\nPortugee, some of the others were Bastards and the rest Arabs. They were\ndrinking rum and water out of tin pannikins--a great deal of rum and\nvery little water. Many of them seemed half-drunk already, at any rate\ntheir tongues were loosened.\n\n\"May a curse fall upon our father, the Devil!\" said one, a half-breed;\n\"why did he take it into his head to send us back with the boats just\nnow? We shall miss the fun.\"\n\n\"What fun?\" answered the leader of the party. \"They won't cage the birds\nfor another three or four days; the dhows are not ready, and there is\ntalk of an English cruiser--may she sink to hell!--hanging about outside\nthe river mouth.\"\n\n\"No, not that,\" said the man who had spoken first, \"there is not much\nsport in driving a lot of stinking niggers on to a dhow. I mean the\nauction of the white girl, the English trader's daughter, whom we caught\nup the river yonder. There's a beauty for some lucky dog; I never saw\nsuch a one. What eyes she has, and what a spirit! why, most of the\nlittle dears would have cried themselves blind by now.\"\n\n\"You needn't think about her,\" sneered his leader; \"she will go too\ndear for the likes of you; besides it is foolish to spend so much on one\ngirl, white or black. When is the auction?\"\n\n\"It was to have been the night before the dhows sail, but now the Devil\nsays it shall be to-morrow night. I will tell you why--he is afraid of\nher. He thinks that she will bring misfortune to him, and wants to be\nrid of her. Ah! he is a wag, is the old man--he loves a joke, he does.\n'All men are brothers,' he said yesterday, 'white or black; therefore\nall women are sisters.' So he is going to sell her like a nigger girl.\nWhat is good enough for them is good enough for her. Ha! ha! pass the\nrum, brother, pass the rum.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he will put it off and we may be back in time, after all,\" said\nthe captain. \"Anyhow, here is a health to her, the love. By the way,\ndid some of you think to ask the password before we left this morning? I\nforgot to do so, myself.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said a Bastard, \"the old word, 'the Devil.'\"\n\n\"There is none better, comrades, none better,\" hiccoughed the leader.\n\nThen for an hour or more their talk went on--partly about Juanna, partly\nabout other things. As they grew more drunk the conversation became more\nand more revolting, till Leonard could scarcely listen to it and lie\nstill. At length it died away, and one by one the men sank into a sound\nand sodden sleep. They did not set a sentry, for here on the island they\nhad no fear of foes.\n\nThen Otter rose upon his hands and knees, and his face looked fierce in\nthe faint light.\n\n\"Baas,\" he whispered, \"shall we----\" and he drew his hand across his\nthroat.\n\nLeonard thought awhile. His rage was deep, and yet he shrank from the\nslaughter of sleeping men, however wicked. Besides, could it be done\nwithout noise? Some of them would wake--fear would sober them, and they\nwere many.\n\n\"No,\" he whispered back. \"Follow me, we will cut loose the boats.\"\n\n\"Good, good,\" said Otter.\n\nThen, stealthily as snakes, they crept some thirty yards to where the\nboats were tied to a low tree--three canoes and five large flat-bottomed\npunts, containing the arms and provisions of the slave-dealers. Drawing\ntheir knives they cut these loose. A gentle push set them moving, then\nthe current caught them, and slowly they floated away into the night.\n\nThis done they crawled back again. Their path took them within five\npaces of where that half-breed ruffian lay who had begun the talk to\nwhich they had listened. Leonard looked at him and turned to creep away;\nalready Otter was five paces ahead, when suddenly the edge of the moon\nshowed for the first time and its light fell full upon the slaver's\nface. The sleeping man awoke, sat up, and saw them.\n\nNow Leonard dared not hesitate, or they were lost. Like a tiger he\nsprang at the man's throat and had grasped it in his hand before he\ncould even cry aloud. Then came a struggle short and sharp, and a knife\nflashed. Before Otter could get back to his side it was done--so swiftly\nand so silently that none of the band had wakened, though one or two of\nthem stirred and muttered in their heavy sleep.\n\nLeonard sprang up unhurt, and together they ran, rather than walked,\nback to the spot where they had left Soa.\n\nShe was watching for them, and pointing to Leonard's coat, asked \"How\nmany?\"\n\n\"One,\" answered Otter.\n\n\"I would it had been all,\" Soa muttered fiercely, \"but you are only\ntwo.\"\n\n\"Quick,\" said Leonard, \"into the canoe with you. They will be after us\npresently.\"\n\nIn another minute they had pushed off and were clear of the island,\nwhich was not more than a quarter of a mile long. They paddled across\nthe river, which at this spot ran rapidly and had a width of some eight\nhundred yards, so as to hide in the shadow of the opposite bank.\nWhen they reached it Otter rested on his paddles and gave vent to a\nsuppressed chuckle, which was his nearest approach to laughter.\n\n\"Why do you laugh, Black One?\" asked Soa.\n\n\"Look yonder,\" he answered, and he pointed to some specks on the surface\nof the river which were fast vanishing in the distance. \"Yonder go the\nboats of the slave-dealers, and in them are their arms and food. We cut\nthem loose, the Baas and I. There on the island sleep two-and-twenty\nmen--all save one: there they sleep, and when they wake what will they\nfind? They will find themselves on a little isle in the middle of great\nwaters, into which, even if they could, they will not dare to swim\nbecause of the alligators. They can get no food on the island, for\nthey have no guns and ducks do not stop to be caught, but outside the\nalligators will wait in hundreds to catch _them_. By-and-by they will\ngrow hungry--they will shout and yell, but none will hear them--then\nthey will become mad, and, falling on each other, they will eat each\nother and die miserably one by one. Some will take to the water, those\nwill drown or be caught by the alligators, and so it shall go on till\nthey are all dead, every one of them, dead, dead, dead!\" and again Otter\nchuckled.\n\nLeonard did not reprove him; with the talk of these wretches yet echoing\nin his ears he could feel little pity for the horrible fate which would\ncertainly overtake them.\n\nHark! a faint sound stole across the quiet waters, a sound which grew\ninto a clamour of fear and rage. The slavers had awakened, they had\nfound the dead man in their midst mysteriously slain by an invisible\nfoe. And now the clamour gathered to a yell, for they had learned that\ntheir boats were gone and that they were trapped.\n\nFrom their shelter on the other side of the river, as they dropped\nleisurely down the stream, Leonard and Otter could catch distant\nglimpses of the frantic men rushing to and fro in the bright moonlight\nand seeking for their boats. But the boats had departed to return no\nmore. By degrees the clamour lessened behind them, till at last it died\naway, swallowed in the silence of the night.\n\nThen Leonard told Soa what he had heard by the slaver's fire.\n\n\"How far is the road, Black One?\" she asked when he had finished.\n\n\"By sundown to-morrow we shall be at the Yellow Devil's gates!\" answered\nOtter.\n\nTwo hours later they overtook the boats which they had cut adrift. Most\nof them were tied together, and they floated peacefully in a group.\n\n\"We had better scuttle them,\" said Leonard.\n\n\"No, Baas,\" answered Otter, \"if we escape we may want them again. Yonder\nis the place where we must land,\" and he pointed to a distant tongue of\nmarsh. \"Let us go with the boats there and make them fast. Perhaps we\nmay find food in them, and we need food.\"\n\nThe advice was good, and they followed it. Keeping alongside of the\npunts and directing them, when necessary, with a push of the paddles,\nthey reached the point just as the dawn was breaking. Here in a\nsheltered bay they found a mooring-place to which they fastened all the\nboats with ropes that hung ready. Then they searched the lockers and\nto their joy discovered food in plenty, including cooked meat, spirits,\nbiscuits, bread, and some oranges and bananas. Only those who have been\nforced to do without farinaceous food for days or weeks will know what\nthis abundance meant to them. Leonard thought that he had never eaten a\nmore delicious meal, or drunk anything so good as the rum and water with\nwhich they washed it down.\n\nThey found other things also: rifles, cutlasses and ammunition, and,\nbetter than all, a chest of clothes which had evidently belonged to\nthe officer or officers of the party. One suit was a kind of uniform\nplentifully adorned with gold lace, having tall boots and a broad felt\nhat with a white ostrich feather in it to match. Also there were some\nlong Arab gowns and turbans, the gala clothes of the slave-dealers,\nwhich they took with them in order to appear smart on their return.\n\nBut the most valuable find of all was a leather bag in the breeches of\nthe uniform, containing the sum of the honest gains of the leader of\nthe party, which he had preferred to keep in his own company even on\nhis travels. On examination this bag was found to hold something over a\nhundred English sovereigns and a dozen or fifteen pieces of Portuguese\ngold.\n\n\"Now, Baas,\" said Otter, \"this is my word, that we put on these\nclothes.\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked Leonard.\n\n\"For this reason: that should we be seen by the slave-traders they will\nthink us of their brethren.\"\n\nThe advantages of this step were so obvious that they immediately\nadopted it. Thus disguised, with a silk sash round his middle and a\npistol stuck in it, Leonard might well have been mistaken for the most\nferocious of slave-traders.\n\nOtter too looked sufficiently strange, robed as an Arab and wearing a\nturban. Being a dwarf, the difficulty was that all the dresses proved\ntoo long for him. Finally it was found necessary to cut one down by the\nprimitive process of laying it on a block of wood and chopping through\nit with a sabre.\n\nWhen this change of garments had been effected, and their own clothes\nwith the spare arms were hidden away in the rushes on the somewhat\nremote chance that they might be useful hereafter, they prepared for a\nstart on foot across the marshes. By an afterthought Leonard fetched the\nbag of gold and put it in his pocket. He felt few scruples in availing\nhimself of the money of the slave-driver, not for his own use indeed,\nbut because it might help their enterprise.\n\nNow their road ran along marshes and by secret paths that none save\nthose who had travelled them could have found. But Otter had not\nforgotten. On they went through the broiling heat of the day, since\nlinger they dared not. They met no living man on their path, though here\nand there they found the body of some wretched slave, whose corpse had\nbeen cast into the reeds by the roadside. But the road had been trodden,\nand recently, by many feet, among which were the tracks of two mules or\ndonkeys.\n\nAt last, about an hour before sunset, they came to the home of the\nYellow Devil. The Nest was placed thus. It stood upon an island having\nan area of ten or twelve acres. Of this, however, only about four and\na half acres were available for a living space; the rest was a morass\nhidden by a growth of very tall reeds, which morass, starting from\na great lagoon on the northern and eastern sides, ran up to the low\nenclosure of the buildings that, on these faces, were considered to be\nsufficiently defended by the swamp and the wide waters beyond. On the\nsouthern and western aspects of the camp matters were different, for\nhere the place was strongly fortified both by art and nature. Firstly,\na canal ran round these two faces, not very wide or deep indeed, but\nimpassable except in boats, owing to the soft mud at its bottom. On the\nfurther side of this canal an earthwork had been constructed, having\nits crest stoutly palisaded and its steep sides planted with a natural\ndefence of aloes and prickly-pears.\n\nSo much for the exterior of the place. Its interior was divided into\nthree principal enclosures. Of these three the easternmost was the site\nof the Nest itself, a long low thatched building of wood, in front and\nto the west of which there was an open space or courtyard, with a hard\nfloor. Herein were but two buildings, a shed supported on posts and open\nfrom the eaves to the ground, where sales of slaves were carried on,\nand further to the north, almost continuous with the line of the Nest\nitself, but separate from it, a small erection, very strongly built\nof brick and stone, and having a roof made from the tin linings\nof ammunition and other cases. This was a magazine. All round this\nenclosure stood rows of straw huts of a native build, evidently occupied\nas a camp by the Arabs and half-breed slave-traders of the baser sort.\n\nThe second enclosure, which was to the west of the Nest, comprised\nthe slave camp. It may have covered an acre of ground, and the only\nbuildings in it were four low sheds, similar in every respect to that\nwhere the slaves were sold, only much longer. Here the captives lay\npicketed in rows to iron bars which ran the length of the sheds, and\nwere fixed into the ground at either end. This camp was separated from\nthe Nest enclosure by a deep canal, thirty feet in width and spanned\nat one point by a slender and primitive drawbridge that led across the\ncanal to the gate of the camp. Also it was protected on the Nest side by\na low wall, and on the slave-camp side by an earthwork, planted as\nusual with prickly-pears. On this earthwork near the gate and little\nguard-house a six-pounder cannon was mounted, the muzzle of which\nfrowned down upon the slave camp, a visible warning to its occupants of\nthe fate that awaited the froward. Indeed, all the defences of this part\nof the island were devised as safeguards against a possible _emeute_ of\nthe slaves, and also to provide a second line of fortifications should\nthe Nest itself chance to be taken by an enemy.\n\nBeyond the slave camp, lay the garden that could only be approached\nthrough it. This also was fortified by water and earthworks, but not so\nstrongly.\n\nSuch is a brief description of what was in those days the strongest\nslave-hold in Africa.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nLEONARD MAKES A PLAN\n\nThe road which Leonard and his companions were following led them to the\nedge of the main and southernmost canal, debouching exactly opposite the\nwater-gate that gave access to the Nest. But Otter did not venture to\nguide them to this point, for there they should be seen by the sentries,\nand, notwithstanding their masquerade dress, awkward questions might\nbe asked which they could not answer. Therefore when they had arrived\nwithin five hundred yards of the gate, he struck off to the left into\nthe thick bush that clothed the hither side of the canal. Through\nthis they crawled as best they might till finally they halted near the\nwater's edge, almost opposite to the south-west angle of the slave camp,\nand under the shadow of a dense clump of willows.\n\n\"See, Baas,\" said the dwarf in a low voice, \"the journey is accomplished\nand I have brought you straight. Yonder is the house of the Yellow\nDevil--now it remains only to take it, or to rescue the maiden from it.\"\n\nLeonard looked at the place in dismay. How was it possible that\nthey--two men and a woman--could capture this fortified camp, filled as\nit was with scores of the most wicked desperadoes in Africa? How was it\npossible even that they could obtain access to it? Viewed from far off,\nthe thing had seemed small--to be done somehow. But now! And yet they\nmust do something, or all their labour would be in vain, and the poor\ngirl they came to rescue must be handed over to her shameful fate,\nor, if she chose it in preference and could compass the deed, to\nself-murder.\n\n\"How on earth!\" said Leonard aloud, then added, \"Well, Otter, I can tell\nyou one thing. I have come a long way on this business, and I am not\ngoing to turn my back to it now. I have never yet turned my back on a\nventure and I will not begin with this, though I dare say that my death\nlies in it.\"\n\n\"It is all in the hand of to-morrow,\" answered Otter; \"but it is time\nthat we made a plan, for the night draws on. Now, Baas, here is a thick\ntree shaded by other trees. Shall we climb it and look down into the\ncamp?\"\n\nLeonard nodded, and climbing the tree with ease, they peeped down\nthrough the leafiest of its boughs. All the camp lay beneath them like\na map, and Otter, clinging monkey-wise to a branch, pointed out its\ndetails to Leonard. He had been a prisoner there, and the memories of\nprisoners are long.\n\nThe place was peopled by numbers of men in strange costumes, and of\ndifferent nationalities; dealers in \"black ivory\" of various degree.\nPerhaps there may have been more than a hundred of them. Some were\nstrolling about in knots smoking and talking, some were gambling, others\nwere going on their business. One group--captains, to judge from the\nrichness of their attire--were standing round the arms-house and peeping\nthrough a grating in the wall, which they reached by sitting upon each\nother's shoulders. This amusement lasted them for some time, till at\nlength a man, of whom at that distance they could see only that he was\nold and stout, came and drove them away, and they broke up laughing.\n\n\"That is the Yellow Devil,\" said Otter, \"and those men were looking at\nthe maid who is called the Shepherdess. She is locked up there until the\nhour comes for her to be sold. They will be the bidders.\"\n\nLeonard made no reply; he was studying the place. Presently a drum was\nbeaten, and men appeared carrying large tin pails of smoking stuff.\n\n\"Yonder is the food for the slaves,\" said Otter again. \"See, they are\ngoing to feed them.\"\n\nThe men with the pails, accompanied by some of the officers having\n_sjambochs_ or hide whips in their hands, advanced across the open space\ntill they came to the moat which separated the slave camp from the\nNest, whence they called to the sentry on the embankment to let down\nthe drawbridge. He obeyed and they crossed. Each man with a bucket was\nfollowed by another who bore a wooden spoon, while a third behind them\ncarried water in a large gourd. Having come to the first of the open\nsheds, they began their rounds, the man with the wooden spoon ladling\nout portions of the stiff porridge and throwing it down upon the ground\nbefore each slave in turn as food is thrown to a dog. Then the Arab with\nthe gourd poured water into wooden bowls, that the captives might drink.\n\nPresently there was a halt, and the officers gathered together to\ndiscuss something.\n\n\"A slave is sick,\" said Otter.\n\nThe knot separated, but a big white man with a hippopotamus-hide whip\nbegan to strike at a dark thing on the ground which did not seem to\nmove.\n\nThe man ceased beating and called aloud. Then two of the Arabs went to\nthe little guard-house that was by the drawbridge and brought tools\nwith which they loosed the fetters on the limbs of the poor\ncreature--apparently a woman--thus freeing her from the long iron bar.\nThis done, some of the officers sauntering after them, they dragged\nthe body to the high enclosure of earth and up a short ladder having a\nwooden platform at the top of it, that overhung the deep canal below.\n\n\"This is how the Yellow Devil buries his dead and cures his sick,\" said\nOtter.\n\n\"I have seen enough,\" answered Leonard, and began to descend the tree\nhastily, an example which Otter followed with more composure.\n\n\"Ah! Baas,\" he said when they reached the ground, \"you are but a\nchicken. The hearts of those who have dwelt in slave camps are strong,\nand, after all, better the belly of a fish than the hold of a slave\ndhow. _Wow!_ who do these things? Is it not the white men, your\nbrothers, and do they not say many prayers to the Great Man up in the\nsky while they do them?\"\n\n\"Be still,\" said Leonard, \"and give me some brandy.\" He was in no mood\nto discuss the blessings of civilisation as they have often been put\ninto practice in Africa. And to think that this fate might soon be his\nown!\n\nLeonard drank the brandy and sat awhile in silence, pushing up his beard\nwith his hand and gazing into the gathering gloom with his hawk-like\neyes. Thus he had sat beside his dying brother's bed; it was a pose that\nhe adopted unconsciously when lost in thought.\n\n\"Come, Soa,\" he said at length, \"we have travelled here to please you;\nnow give us the benefit of your suggestions. How are we going to get\nyour mistress out of that camp?\"\n\n\"Loose the slaves and let them kill their masters,\" Soa answered\nlaconically.\n\n\"I doubt there is not much pluck in slaves,\" said Leonard.\n\n\"There should be fifty of Mavoom's men there,\" she replied, \"and they\nwill fight well enough if they have arms.\"\n\nThen Leonard looked at Otter, seeking further ideas.\n\n\"My snake puts it into my head,\" said the dwarf, \"that fire is a good\nfriend when men are few and foes are many; also that the reeds yonder\nare dry, and the sea wind rises and will blow hard before midnight.\nMoreover all these houses are thatched, and in a wind fire jumps. But\ncan a regiment have two generals? You are our captain, Baas; speak and\nwe will do your bidding. Here one counsel is as good as another. Let\nfate speak through your mouth.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Leonard. \"This is my plan; it goes a little further\nthan yours, that is all. We must gain entrance to the Nest while it is\nstill dark, before the moon rises. I know the watchword, 'Devil,' and\ndisguised as we are, perhaps the sentry will let us pass unquestioned.\nIf not, we must kill him, and silently.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Otter, \"but how about the woman here?\"\n\n\"We will leave her hidden in the bush; she could be of no help in the\ncamp and might hinder us.\"\n\n\"No, White Man,\" broke in Soa, \"where you go I go also; moreover my\nmistress is yonder and I would seek her.\"\n\n\"As you like,\" answered Leonard, then went on: \"we must get between\nthe hut, there is only one, and the low wall that borders the canal\nseparating the Nest from the slave camp, and, if the drawbridge is up\nand no other means can be found, we must swim the dike, dispose of the\nsentry there also and gain the slave camp. Then we must try to free some\nof the slaves and send them round through the garden into the morass to\nfire the reeds, should the wind blow strong enough. Meanwhile I propose\nto walk boldly into the camp, salute Pereira, pass myself off as a\nslaver with a dhow at the mouth of the river, and say that I have come\nto buy slaves, and above all to bid for the white girl. Luckily we have\na good deal of gold. That is my plan so far as it goes, the rest we must\nleave to chance. If I can buy the Shepherdess I will. If not, I must try\nto get her off in some other way.\"\n\n\"So be it, Baas, and now let us eat, for we shall need all our strength\nto-night. Then we will go down to the landing-place and take our\nchance.\"\n\nThey ate of the food they had with them and drank sparingly of the\nslave-dealers' brandy, saying little the while, for the shadow of what\nwas to come lay upon them. Even the phlegmatic and fatalistic Otter was\ndepressed, perhaps because of the associations of the place, which,\nfor him, were painful, perhaps because of the magnitude of their\nundertaking. Never had he known such a tale, never had he seen such an\nadventure as this--that two men and an old woman should attack an armed\ncamp. Indeed, although he was not acquainted with the saying, Otter's\nfeelings would have been correctly summed up in the well-known phrase,\n\"_C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre_.\"\n\nAs yet the night was intensely dark, and its gloom did not tend to\nimprove their spirits; also, as Otter had predicted, the wind was rising\nand soughed through the reeds and willows in melancholy notes.\n\nSo the time passed till it was nine o'clock.\n\n\"We must move down to the landing-place,\" said Leonard; \"there will soon\nbe some light, enough for us to work by.\"\n\nThen Otter took the lead and slowly, step by step, they crept back\nto the road and followed it down the shore of the canal opposite the\nwater-gate. Here was a place where boats and canoes were tied, both for\nconvenience in crossing the canal to and from the camp and for the use\nof the slave-dealers when they passed to the secret harbour six miles\naway, where the dhows embarked their cargoes.\n\nThey waited awhile. From the Nest came the sound of revelry, and from\nthe slave camp there rose other sounds, the voice of groaning broken by\nan occasional wail wrung out of the misery of some lost creature who lay\nthere in torment. Gradually the sky brightened a little.\n\n\"Perhaps we had better be making a start,\" said Leonard; \"there is a\ncanoe which will serve our turn.\"\n\nBefore the words were out of his mouth they heard the splash of oars,\nand a boat crept past them and made fast to the water-gate twenty yards\naway.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" came the challenge of the sentry in Portuguese. \"Speak\nquick or I fire.\"\n\n\"Don't be in such a hurry with your rifle, fool,\" answered a coarse\nvoice. \"The very best of friends goes here. An honest trader called\nXavier who comes from his plantation on the coast to tell you all good\nnews.\"\n\n\"Pardon, senor,\" said the sentry, \"but how was a man to see in the dark,\nbig as you are? What is the news then? Are the dhows in sight?\"\n\n\"Come down and help us to tie up this cursed boat and I will tell you.\nYou know where the post is, and we can't find it.\"\n\nThe sentry obeyed with alacrity, and the man called Xavier went on:\n\"Yes, the dhows are in sight, but I don't think that they will get in\nto-night because of this wind, so you may look for a busy day to-morrow\nloading up the blackbirds. One _is_ in by the way--a small one from\nMadagascar. The captain is a stranger, a big Frenchman named Pierre, or\nhe may be an Englishman for anything I know. I hailed him and found that\nhe is all right, but I didn't see him. However, I sent him a note to\ntell him that there was fun on here to-night, which was generous of me,\nas he may be a rival bidder.\"\n\n\"Is he coming, senor? I ask because, if so, I must look out for him.\"\n\n\"I don't know: he answered that he would if he could. But how is the\nEnglish girl? She is to be put up to-night, isn't she?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, senor, there will be a great to-do at twelve, when the moon is\nhigh. So soon as she has been bought, the priest Francisco is to marry\nher to the lucky man, there and then. The old fellow insists on it;\nhe has grown superstitious about the girl and says that she shall be\nproperly married.\"\n\nXavier laughed aloud, \"Has he now? He is getting into his dotage. Well,\nwhat does it matter? We have a good law of divorce in these parts,\nfriend. I am going in for that girl; if I give a hundred ounces for her\nI will buy her, and I have brought the gold with me.\"\n\n\"A hundred ounces for one girl! It is a large sum, senor, but you are\nrich. Not like us poor devils who get all the risk and little profit.\"\n\nBy this time the men had finished tying up the boat and taking some\nbaggage or provisions out of her, Leonard could not see which. Then\nXavier and the sentry went up the steps together, followed by the two\nboatmen, and the gates were shut behind them.\n\n\"Well,\" whispered Leonard, \"we have learnt something at any rate.\nNow, Otter, I am Pierre the French slave-trader from Madagascar,\nand, understand, you are my servant; as for Soa, she is the guide, or\ninterpreter, or anyone you like. We must pass the gates, but the real\nPierre must never pass them. There must be no sentry to let him in. Do\nyou think that you can manage it, Otter, or must I?\"\n\n\"It comes into my head, Baas, that we may learn a lesson from this\nXavier. I might forget something in the canoe, and the sentry might help\nme to find it after you have passed the gates. For the rest I am quick\nand strong and silent.\"\n\n\"Quick and strong and silent you must be. A noise, and all is lost.\"\n\nThen they crept to the canoe which they had selected and loosened her.\nThey embarked and Otter took the paddle. First he let her float gently\ndown stream and under cover of the shore for a distance of about fifty\nyards. Then he put about and the play began.\n\n\"Now, you fool, where are you paddling to?\" said Leonard in a loud voice\nto Otter, speaking in the bastard Arabic which passes current for a\nlanguage on this coast. \"You will have us into the bank, I tell you.\nCurse this wind and the darkness! Steady now, you ugly black dog; those\nmust be the gates the letter told of--are they not, woman? Hold on with\nthe boat-hook, can't you?\"\n\nA wicket at the gate above rattled and the voice of the sentry\nchallenged them.\n\n\"A friend--a friend!\" answered Leonard in Portuguese; \"one who is a\nstranger and would pay his respects to your leader, Dom Antonio Pereira,\nwith a view to business.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\" asked the guard suspiciously.\n\n\"Pierre is my name. Dog is the name of the dwarf my servant, and as for\nthe old woman, you can call her anything you like.\"\n\n\"The password,\" said the sentry; \"none come in here without the word.\"\n\n\"The word--Ah! what did the Dom Xavier say it was in his letter?\n'Fiend!' No, I have it, 'Devil' is the word.\"\n\n\"Where do you hail from?\"\n\n\"From Madagascar, where the goods you have to supply are in some demand\njust now. Come, let us in; we don't want to sit here all night and miss\nthe fun.\"\n\nThe man began to unbar the door, and stopped, struck by a fresh doubt.\n\n\"You are not of our people,\" he said; \"you speak Portuguese like a\ncursed Englishman.\"\n\n\"No, I should hope not; I am a 'cursed Englishman,' that is half--son\nof an English lord and a French creole, born in the Mauritius at your\nservice, and let me ask you to be a little more civil, for cross-bred\ndogs are fierce.\"\n\nNow at length the sentry opened one side of the gate, grumbling, and\nLeonard swaggered up the steps followed by the other two. Already they\nwere through it, when suddenly he turned and struck Otter in the face.\n\n\"Why, Dog,\" he said angrily, \"you have forgotten to bring up the keg of\nbrandy, my little present for the Dom. Go and fetch it. Quick, now.\"\n\n\"Pardon, Chief,\" answered Otter, \"but I am a small man and the keg is\nheavy for me alone--if you will deign to help me, for the old woman is\ntoo weak.\"\n\n\"Do you take me for a porter that I should roll kegs of cognac up steps?\nHere, my friend,\" he went on addressing the sentry, \"if you wish to earn\na little present and a drink, perhaps you will give this fellow a hand\nwith the cask. There is a spigot in it, and you can try the quality\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"Right, Senor,\" said the man briskly, and led the way down the steps.\n\nA look of dreadful intelligence passed between the dwarf and his master.\nThen Otter followed, his hand upon the hilt of the Arab sabre which he\nwore, while Leonard and Soa waited above. They heard the man's heavily\nbooted feet going down the steps followed by Otter's naked footfall.\n\n\"Where is your keg? I don't see it,\" said the sentry presently.\n\n\"Lean over, senor, lean over,\" answered Otter; \"it is in the stern of\nthe canoe. Let me help you.\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause, to the listeners it seemed hours. Then came\nthe sound of a blow and a heavy splash. They hearkened on, but nothing\nmore was to be heard except the beating of their hearts and the distant\nnoise of revelry from the camp.\n\nThree seconds passed and Otter stood beside them. In the dim light\nLeonard could see that his eyes stared wide and his nostrils twitched.\n\n\"Quick was the blow, strong was the blow, silent is the man for ever,\"\nwhispered Otter. \"So the Baas commanded, so it is.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHAT HERO OTTER\n\n\"Help me to secure the gate,\" said Leonard presently.\n\nIn another minute the great iron bar had been dropped into its place,\nand Leonard withdrew the key and put it in his pocket.\n\n\"Why do you secure the door, Baas?\" whispered Otter.\n\n\"To keep the real Pierre out, in case he should come this way. Two\nPierres would be one too many at this game. Now we must win or perish.\"\n\nThen they crept along the embankment till they gained the shelter of the\nhut or barrack-shed which stood with its back to the dike that separated\nthe Nest from the slave camp. Happily none saw them, and there were no\ndogs in the place. Dogs make a noise at inconvenient times, therefore\nslave-dealers do not love them.\n\nThe end of the shed behind which they were crouching was situated some\neight or ten paces from the drawbridge, that formed the only path of\nentry to the slave camp.\n\n\"Baas,\" said Otter, \"let me go forward and look. My eyes are the eyes of\na cat; I can see in the dark. Perhaps the bridge is down.\"\n\nWithout waiting for an answer, he crept forward on his hands and knees\nso quietly that they could scarcely hear a movement. Notwithstanding his\nwhite dress, there was little chance of his being seen, for the shadow\nof the shed was dense and a fringe of rushes grew along the edge of the\ndike.\n\nFive minutes passed--ten minutes passed, and Otter did not return.\nLeonard's anxiety grew very keen.\n\n\"Let us go and see what happened, mother,\" he whispered to Soa.\n\nThey crept along to the end of the shed. Within a yard of it they\ndiscovered the arms and clothes of Otter. But Otter! Where was he?\n\n\"The Black One has deserted us,\" said Soa beneath her breath.\n\n\"Never!\" answered Leonard.\n\nBy now the clouds were breaking before the wind, which was rising\nsteadily, and some stars shone out, giving a little light. The dike lay\ndeep between its banks and was not more than twenty feet in width, so\nthat the air did not ruffle it; moreover, as any observer of nature will\nhave noticed, the surface of still water is never quite dark, even on\nmuch blacker nights than this.\n\nWhy had Otter taken off his clothes, Leonard wondered? Evidently that\nhe might go into the water. And what could he want to go into the water\nfor, unless it was that his heart failed him and, as Soa suggested, he\nhad deserted. But this was impossible, for he knew well that the dwarf\nwould die first. In his great perplexity Leonard stared at the dike.\nNow he could see that on its further side rose a flight of wooden steps,\nprotected at the top by gates and that a man was seated on the lowest\nstep, with a rifle beside him, his feet hanging down to within a few\ninches of the surface of the dike. It must be the sentry.\n\nNext instant Leonard saw something else. Beneath the feet of the man a\nripple grew on the face of the deep water, and something gleamed in the\nripple like to the flash of steel. Then a small black object projected\nitself towards the feet of the sentry, who was half asleep and humming\nto himself drowsily. Suddenly he saw the man slide from his seat as\nthough by magic. He said nothing, but making one ineffectual grasp at\nsome rushes, he vanished into the deeps below. For a minute or more\nLeonard could distinguish a slight disturbance on the surface of the\nwater, and that was all.\n\nNow he guessed what had happened. Otter had dived, and rising beneath\nthe feet of the man, he seized him, and with a sudden movement dragged\nhim down to death by drowning. Either this, or an alligator had taken\nhim, and that flash was the flash of his fangs.\n\nAs Leonard thought thus a dark form rose gasping at the foot of the\nsteps; it drew itself out of the water and slipped stealthily up them.\nIt was Otter, and he held a knife in his hand. Now the dwarf vanished\nthrough the gates into the little guard-house at the top of the\nembankment. Another minute, and ropes began to creak. Then the tall\ndrawbridge, standing upright like a scaffold against the sky, was seen\nto bend itself forward. Down it came very softly, and the slave-camp was\nopen to them. Again the black shape appeared, this time on the bridge.\n\n\"Come along,\" whispered Leonard to his companion; \"that hero Otter has\ndrowned the sentry and won the bridge. Stop, pick up his clothes and\narms.\"\n\nAt that moment Otter himself arrived. \"Quick,\" he said, \"come over,\nBaas, before they see that the bridge is down. Give me my clothes and\nthe gun.\"\n\n\"All right, here they are,\" answered Leonard, and in another minute they\nwere over the bridge and standing on the parapet of the slave-camp.\n\n\"Into the guard-house, Baas; the windlass is there, but no man.\"\n\nThey entered: a lamp was burning in the place. Otter seized the handle\nof the windlass and began to wind. He was naked, and it was a wonderful\nsight to see the muscles starting out in knots on his huge but dwarfish\nframe as he strained at the weight of the bridge.\n\nPresently it was up, and, leaning on the handle of the wheel, Otter\nchuckled aloud.\n\n\"Now we are safe for a time,\" he said, \"and I will dress myself. Let the\nBaas forgive me for appearing thus before him--I, who am so ugly.\"\n\n\"Tell us the tale, Otter.\"\n\n\"It is short, Baas,\" the dwarf replied, as he put on his robe and\nturban. \"When I left you I watched, I who can see in the dark, and in a\nlittle while I saw the guard come down the steps and sit by the edge of\nthe water. He was sleepy, for he yawned and lit a roll of paper to smoke\nit. Presently it went out, and he had no more matches. He looked up to\nthe house there, but was too lazy to fetch them; then I guessed that he\nwas alone, for else he would have called to his companion for fire. Now\nhe grew sleepier, and I said to myself, 'Otter, Otter, how can you kill\nthis man silently? You must not shoot, because of the noise; and if you\nthrow a knife or a spear, you may miss, or wound him only.' And my snake\nspoke in my heart and answered, 'Otter, Otter, dive, seize his feet,\nand drag him down swiftly and stamp him into the mud, you who are half a\nfish and can swim as no other man can swim. Do it at once, Otter, before\nthe light comes and men can see the drawbridge move.'\n\n\"Well, and so I did it, Baas. _Wow!_ I trod him deep into the mire, I\ntrampled him as an ox tramples corn upon a threshing-floor. Never\nwill he come up again. After that I rose and ran into the guard-house,\nfearing lest there might be another whom I must silence also, for when I\nwas a slave two always kept watch. But the place was empty, so I let\nthe bridge down. Ah! I remembered how it worked. And that is the tale,\nBaas.\"\n\n\"A great tale, Otter, but it is not finished yet. Now let us to the\nslaves. Come, take the light and lead the way. Here we are safe, is it\nnot so?\"\n\n\"Here, Baas, we are safe, for none can reach us except by storm, and\nyonder is the big gun which turns upon itself. Let us twist the gun\nround first, so that, if need be, we can fire into the camp.\"\n\n\"I don't know much of cannon,\" said Leonard doubtfully.\n\n\"But I know something, White Man,\" said Soa, speaking for the first\ntime. \"Mavoom, my master, has a small one up at the Settlement, and\noften I have helped to fire it for practice and as a signal to boats on\nthe river, and so have many of the men who were carried away, if we can\nfind them yonder.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Leonard.\n\nA path ran along the top of the embankment to the platform on which the\ngun was mounted. It was a six-pounder muzzle-loader. Leonard unhooked\nthe rammer and ran it down the muzzle.\n\n\"She is loaded,\" he said; \"now let us swing her round.\"\n\nThey did so easily enough, bringing the muzzle down upon the Nest camp;\nthen they entered the little hut which stood alongside. Piled up in it,\nin case of emergency, were half-a-dozen rounds of grape-shot and powder.\n\n\"Lots of ammunition, if we should want to use it,\" said Leonard. \"It\nnever occurred to those gentlemen that a gun can shoot two ways. And\nnow, Otter, lead us to the slaves, quick.\"\n\n\"This way, Baas, but first we must find the tools; they are in the\nguard-hut, I suppose.\"\n\nSo they crept back to the hut, holding their heads as low as possible,\nfor the light was increasing, although the moon was not yet up, and they\nfeared lest they should be seen against the sky-line. Here they found\nboxes containing nippers, chisels, and other instruments such as are\nused to undo the irons upon slaves. Also they found the keys of the\npadlocks that locked the iron bars to which the captives were tethered.\nTaking a lantern with them, but leaving another burning as before in the\nhut, lest its absence should excite suspicion, they passed through two\nstrong gates and down the steps on the further side of the embankment. A\nfew paces beyond stood the first slave-shed, a rough erection supported\non posts, but without sides.\n\nThey entered the shed, Otter leading the way with the lantern. In the\nmiddle of it was a path, and on either side of this path ran the long\nbars to which the captives were fastened in a double row. Perhaps there\nmight have been two hundred and fifty of them in this shed. Here the\nsights and scenes were such as need not be described. Of the miserable\ncaptives some lay on the wet ground, men and women together, trying to\nforget their sorrows in sleep; but the most part of them were awake, and\nthe sound of moans ran up and down their lines like the moaning of trees\nin the wind.\n\nWhen they saw the light the slaves ceased moaning, and crouched upon the\nground like dogs that await the whip, for they thought that this was\na visit from their captors. Some of them, indeed, stretched out their\nmanacled hands imploring pity, but these were the exceptions; the most\nof them had abandoned hope and were sunk in dull despair. It was pitiful\nto see the glance of their terror-filled eyes and the answering quiver\nof their wealed frames whenever an arm was lifted or a sudden movement\nmade.\n\nSoa went down the line, rapidly examining the faces of the slaves.\n\n\"Do you see any of Mavoom's people?\" asked Leonard anxiously.\n\n\"Not here, White Man; let us go to the next shed, unless you want to\nloose these.\"\n\n\"No good in that, mother,\" said Otter; \"they would only betray us.\"\n\nSo they went to the next shed--in all there were four--and here at the\nsecond man who was sleeping, his head bowed on his chained hands, Soa\nstopped suddenly like a pointer dog when he scents game.\n\n\"Peter, Peter,\" she said.\n\nThe man awoke--he was a fine fellow about thirty years of age--and\nglared round wildly.\n\n\"Who called me by my old name?\" he said hoarsely. \"Nay, I dream, Peter\nis dead.\"\n\n\"Peter,\" said the woman again, \"awake, child of Mavoom; it is I, Soa,\nwho am come to save you.\"\n\nThe man cried aloud and began to tremble, but the other slaves took no\nnotice, thinking only that he had been smitten with a scourge.\n\n\"Be silent,\" said Soa again, \"or we are lost. Loose the bar, Black One;\nthis is a head-man from the Settlement, a brave man.\"\n\nSoon the bar was undone, then Otter bade Peter hold out his wrists while\nhe twisted off the fetters. Presently they were gone, and in the ecstasy\nof his recovered liberty the man leaped high into the air, then fell at\nOtter's feet as though he would embrace them.\n\n\"Get up, you fool,\" said the dwarf roughly, \"and if there are any more\nof the men of Mavoom here, show them to us: quick, or you will soon be\nfast again.\"\n\n\"There should be forty or more,\" Peter answered, recovering himself,\n\"besides a few women and children. The rest of us are dead, except the\nShepherdess alone, and she is yonder.\"\n\nThen they went down the lines slipping the chains from the Settlement\ncaptives. Soon they had unmanacled ten or more men whom Soa selected,\nand others stood round them with their hands still chained. As they went\nabout the work Soa explained something of the position to Peter, who was\nfortunately a native of intelligence. He grasped the situation at once\nand earnestly seconded Leonard's efforts to preserve silence and to\nprevent confusion.\n\n\"Come,\" said Leonard to Soa, \"we have got enough to begin with. I must\nbe off. You can loose the rest at your leisure; the moon is rising, it\nis a quarter to twelve, and we have not a moment to lose. Now, Otter,\nbefore we go, how can we send men to fire the reeds--through the\ngarden?\"\n\n\"No, Baas, I have thought of a better way, the way by which I escaped\nmyself--that is, if these men can swim.\"\n\n\"They can all swim,\" said Soa; \"they were bred on the banks of a river.\"\n\n\"Good. Then they must swim down the dike where I killed the sentry, four\nof them. At the end are bars of wood, but in my day they were rotten;\nat the worst they can be climbed. Then they will find themselves in the\nmorass among thick reeds. But they must not fire these till they\nhave worked round to the place of the sunrise, whence the wind blows\nstrongly. Then they must go from spot to spot and bend down the driest\nof the reeds, setting fire to them. Afterwards they can get to the back\nof the fire and wait till all is done one way or the other. If we win\nthey will find us, if we are killed they can try to run away. But will\nthe men go?\"\n\nSoa stepped forward and chose four of their number, but Peter she did\nnot choose, for he also knew something of the working of cannon.\n\n\"Listen,\" she said, \"you have heard the words of this Black One. Now,\nobey. And if you depart from them by one jot, may----\" and she poured\nout so fearful a curse upon them that Leonard stared at her astonished.\n\n\"Ay!\" added Otter, \"and if I live through this I will cut your throats.\"\n\n\"No need to threaten,\" said one of the men; \"we will do our best for\nour own sakes, as well as for yours and that of the Shepherdess. We\nunderstand the plan, but to light reeds we must have fire.\"\n\n\"Here are matches,\" said Otter.\n\n\"Wet matches will not light, and we must swim,\" answered the spokesman.\n\n\"Fool, do you then swim with your head under water? Tie them in your\nhair.\"\n\n\"Ah! he is clever,\" said the spokesman. \"Now, if we live to reach them,\nwhen shall we fire the reeds?\"\n\n\"As soon as you are ready,\" answered Otter. \"You will not come easily to\nthe back of them. Farewell, my children, and if you dare to fail, pray\nthat you may die rather than look upon my face again.\"\n\n\"_Ou!_ We have seen it once, is that not enough?\" answered the\nspokesman, looking at Otter's huge nose with wonder not untouched by\nfear.\n\nTwo minutes later the four men were swimming swiftly down the dike,\ntaking their chance of the alligators.\n\n\"Drop the bridge,\" said Leonard; \"we must start.\"\n\nOtter lowered it, at the same time explaining its mechanism, which was\nvery simple, to Soa, Peter, and some of the other Settlement men.\n\n\"Now, mother, good-bye,\" said Leonard. \"Loose all the men you can,\nand keep a keen look-out, so as to be ready to lower the bridge if you\nshould see us or your mistress coming towards it. If we should not\ncome by dawn, be ready also, for then we shall probably be dead, or\nprisoners, and you must act for yourself.\"\n\n\"I hear you, Lord,\" answered Soa, \"and I say that you are a brave man.\nWhether you win or lose, the red stone is well earned already.\"\n\nAnother minute and they were gone.\n\nHaving crossed the bridge, which was instantly hoisted again, Leonard\nand Otter avoided observation by creeping back towards the water-gate\nas they had come--that is, behind the shelter of the shed. Emerging from\nthis, they ran a few yards till they were opposite the gate, then walked\nleisurely across the open space, a distance of fifty paces or more, to\nthe thatched hut where the sale of slaves was carried on.\n\nThere was nobody in this hut, but looking between the posts upon which\nit was supported, they could see by the light of the moon, now growing\nmomentarily clearer, that a great and uproarious concourse of people was\ngathered beyond in front of the verandah of the Nest itself.\n\n\"Come on, Otter,\" whispered Leonard, \"we must go among these gentry.\nWatch me closely, do what I do, keep your weapons ready, and if it comes\nto blows, get behind my back and fight like a fiend. Above all, don't be\ntaken prisoner.\"\n\nLeonard spoke calmly, but his heart was in his mouth, and his sensations\nwere such as must have been known to Daniel when he went into the lions'\nden, for, as in the case of the prophet, he felt that nothing short of\na special Providence could save them. They were round the shed now,\nand immediately in front of them was a mixed gathering of\ndesperadoes--Portuguese, Arabs, Bastards, and black men of various\ntribes--such as Leonard had never seen in all his experience.\n\nVillainy and greed were written on every countenance; it was a crew of\nhuman demons, and an extensive one. These wretches, most of whom had\nalready drunk too freely and were drinking more, stood with their backs\nto them, looking towards the verandah of the Nest. On the steps of\nthis verandah, surrounded by a choice group of companions, all of them\ngaudily dressed, a man was standing whom Leonard would have had no\ndifficulty in identifying as the Dom Pereira, even without Otter's\nwarning whisper of \"See! The Yellow Devil!\"\n\nThis remarkable person demands some description as he stood in glory\nthat night, at the apex and, though he knew it not, the conclusion of\nhis long career of infamy. He was old, perhaps seventy, his hair was\nwhite and venerable-looking, and his person obese. His black eyes\nwere small, cunning, cold, and bright, and they had the peculiarity\nof avoiding the face of any person with whom he chanced to be in\nconversation, at least when that person was looking his way. Their\nglance passed over him, under him, round him, anywhere but at him.\n\nAs his sobriquet suggested, the colouring of Pereira's flesh was yellow,\nand the loose skin hung in huge wrinkles upon his cheeks. His mouth was\nlarge and coarse, and his fat hands twitched and grasped continually, as\nthough with a desire of clutching money. For the rest he was gorgeously\ndressed, and, like his companions, somewhat in liquor.\n\nSuch was the outward appearance of Pereira, the fountain-head of the\nslave-trade on this part of the coast, who was believed in his day to\nbe the very worst man in Africa, a pre-eminence to which few can hope to\nattain. Until his face had been seen, stamped as it was with the traces\nof long and unmentionable wickedness, few honest men could guess to what\ndepths humanity can sink. Some indeed have declared that to see him was\nto understand the Evil One and all his works.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nA CHOICE LOT\n\nAt the moment of Leonard's and Otter's introduction to his society, the\nYellow Devil was about to make a speech, and all eyes were fixed on him\nso intently that none saw or heard the pair approach.\n\n\"Now, my friends, make a path, if you please,\" said Leonard in a loud\nvoice and speaking in Portuguese. \"I wish to pay my respects to your\nchief.\"\n\nA dozen men wheeled round at once.\n\n\"Who are you?\" they cried, seeing a stranger.\n\n\"If you will be so kind as to let me pass, I shall be most happy to\nexplain,\" Leonard answered, pushing his way through the throng.\n\n\"Who is that?\" cried Pereira in coarse, thick tones. \"Bring him here.\"\n\n\"There, you hear him--let us through, friends,\" said Leonard, \"let us\nthrough!\"\n\nThus adjured the throng opened a path, and Leonard and Otter passed down\nit, many suspicious eyes scanning them as they went.\n\n\"A greeting to you, senor,\" said Leonard when they had emerged in front\nof the verandah.\n\n\"Curse your greeting! Who in Satan's name are you?\"\n\n\"A humble member of your honourable profession,\" said Leonard coolly,\n\"come to pay his respects and do a little business.\"\n\n\"Are you? You don't look it. You look like an Englishman. And who is\nthat abortion, pray?\" and he pointed to Otter. \"I believe that you are\nspies, and, by the Saints, if you are, I am the man to deal with you!\"\n\n\"This is a likely story,\" said Leonard laughing, \"that one man and a\nblack dog should venture into the headquarters of gentlemen like you,\nnot being of the cloth. But I think there is a noble gentleman among\nyou--I mean the Senor Xavier--who can vouch for me. Did he not send a\nnote to Captain Pierre, whose dhow lies in the harbour yonder, hailing\nfrom Madagascar? Well, Captain Pierre has the honour of accepting his\ninvitation and arrives here, not without difficulty. Now he begins to\nthink that he would have done better to stick to his ship.\"\n\n\"That is all right, Pereira,\" said Xavier, a huge Portuguese with a dash\nof negro blood and a villainous countenance, the same man whom they had\nfollowed through the gate. \"I sent a note to the Senor. I told you of\nit.\"\n\n\"Then I wish you had left it alone,\" snarled Pereira for an answer. \"I\ndon't like your friend's looks. He might be the captain of an English\nman-of-war rigged up in our dress.\"\n\nAt the words \"English man-of-war\" a murmur of fear and anger went\nthrough the assembly. Some of those present had experience of these\nhated vessels and their bigoted crews, who loved not this honest\ncommerce, and to all they were names of ill-omen. Things looked serious,\nand Leonard saw that he must do something, and quickly. So he lost his\ntemper, or pretended to do so.\n\n\"Curse you all for a pack of suspicious curs!\" he said; \"I tell you that\nmy dhow lies yonder. I am half an Englishman and half a Creole, and as\ngood a man as any of you. Now look here, Dom Pereira, if you, or any\nof your crew, dare to doubt my word, just step out, and I will ram this\ndown your lying throat;\" and placing his hand on the hilt of his sabre,\nhe took a pace forward and scowled.\n\nThe effect was instantaneous. Pereira turned a little pale beneath his\nyellow skin, for like most cruel men he was a great coward.\n\n\"Put up your pig-sticker,\" he said; \"I see you are one of the right\nsort. I only wanted to try you. As you know, we must be careful in our\nbusiness. Come and shake hands, brother, and be welcome. I trust you\nnow, and old Antonio never does things by halves.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you had better try him a little further,\" said a young man who\nwas standing near Pereira, as Leonard prepared to accept the invitation;\n\"send for a slave and let us have the old test--there is none better.\"\n\nPereira hesitated and Leonard's blood turned cold.\n\n\"Look here, young man,\" he said more furiously than before, \"I have cut\nthe throats of more men than you have whipped, but if you want a test,\nI will give you one. Come down, my young cockerel, come down; there is\nplenty of light for comb-snipping.\"\n\nThe man turned white with rage, but stood a moment contemplating\nLeonard's athletic form and keen eyes. Apparently he found that in them\nwhich gave him pause, for instead of springing at him, he burst into a\nvolume of threats and filthy abuse.\n\nHow the matter would have ended it is difficult to say, but at this\njuncture Pereira thought it well to interfere, and vigorously.\n\n\"Peace!\" he thundered in his great voice, his white hair bristling with\nrage. \"I have welcomed this man, and he is welcome. Is my word to be set\naside by a drunken young brawler like you? Shut your ugly mouth or, by\nthe Saints, I will have you clapped in irons.\"\n\nThe slave-driver obeyed; perhaps he was not sorry for an excuse to\nescape the quarrel. At any rate with a scowl at Leonard he dropped back\nand was silent.\n\nHarmony being thus restored, Pereira proceeded with the business of\nthe evening. First, however, he called Leonard to him, shook him by\nthe hand, and bade a slave-girl bring him drink. Then he addressed the\ncompany thus:\n\n\"My lambs, my dear companions, my true and trusted friends, this is\na sad moment for me, your old leader, for I stand here to bid you\ngood-bye. To-morrow the Nest will know the Yellow Devil no more, and you\nmust find another captain. Alas! I grow old, I am no longer up to the\nwork, and trade is not what it was, thanks to those infernal Englishmen\nand their cruisers, which prowl up and down our waters, seeking to rob\nhonest men of the fruits of their enterprise. For nearly fifty years I\nhave been connected with the business, and I think that the natives of\nthese parts will remember me--not angrily, oh! no, but as a benefactor.\nFor have not some twenty thousand of their young people passed through\nmy hands, rescued by me from the curse of barbarism and sent to learn\nthe blessings of civilisation and the arts of peace in the homes of kind\nand indulgent masters?\n\n\"Sometimes, not often, but now and again, there has been bloodshed in\nthe course of our little expeditions. I regret it. But what will you?\nThese people are so obstinate that they cannot see how well it is for\nthem to come under my wing. And if they try to injure us in our good\nwork, why, we must fight. We all know the bitterness of ingratitude,\nbut we have to put up with it. It is a trial sent to us from Heaven,\nmy lambs, always remember that. So I retire with such modest gains as\nI have won by a life of labour--indeed, they have gone before me, lest\nsome of you might be put in the way of temptation--to spend the evening\nof my day in peace and prayer.\n\n\"And now there is one more little thing. As it chanced during our last\njourney, the daughter of an accursed Englishman fell into our hands. I\ntook her and brought her here, and as her guardian I have asked you to\nmeet me to-night, that I may choose her a husband, as it is my duty\nto do. I cannot keep her myself, for among the settled people near\nMozambique, where I am going to live, her presence might lead to awkward\nquestions. So I will be generous and pass her on to another.\n\n\"But to whom shall I give this prize, this pearl, this sweet and lovely\nmaid? Among so many worthy gentlemen how can I set one above the others\nand declare him most deserving of the girl? I cannot, so I must leave it\nto chance, for I know that Heaven will choose better than I. Therefore\nto him who is ready to make the largest present to me I will give this\nmaid, to comfort him with her love; to make a present, mind you, not\nto pay a price. Still, perhaps, it will be best that the amount of the\ndonation should be ascertained in the usual way, by bidding--in ounces\nof gold, if you please!\n\n\"One condition more, there shall be nothing irregular in this matter, my\nfriends. The Church shall have its say in it, and he whom I select must\nwed the maid, here, before us all. Have we not a priest at hand, and\nshall we find no work for him? Now, my children, time draws on. Ho! you,\nbring out the English girl.\"\n\nThis speech was not delivered quite so continuously as it is printed\nhere. On the contrary, it was subject to many interruptions, mostly of\nan ironical nature, the allusions to \"a present\" to be given for the\ngirl and to the proposed marriage ceremony being received with screams\nof ribald laughter.\n\nNow the noise died away, for every eye watched for the appearance of\nJuanna.\n\nIn a few moments a figure clad in white and guarded by several men was\nseen advancing from the direction of the arms-house. This figure came\non through the moonlight with a swift agile step, looking neither to\nthe right nor to the left, till it arrived in front of the verandah and\nhalted. Then it was that Leonard first saw Juanna Rodd. She was very\ntall and slight, her dark hair was twisted into a single knot at the\nback of her shapely head, her features were small, her face fair in\ncolouring and somewhat rounded in form. So much he saw at a glance, but\nit was not until she looked up and round her that Leonard discovered the\ngirl's peculiar glory, the glory of her eyes. Then and in that light he\nwas unable to distinguish their colour, a difficult task at any time,\nfor they varied from grey to blue according to the shadows which fell\nupon them, but he could see that they were wide and splendid, fearless\nand yet soft. For the rest she was clad in an Arab robe richly worked,\nand wore sandals upon her feet.\n\nJuanna stopped in front of the verandah and searched it with her eyes.\nPresently they ceased their searching and she spoke in a clear, sweet\nvoice.\n\n\"What do you want with me now, Dom Antonio Pereira?\" she said.\n\n\"My dove,\" he answered in his coarse, mocking tones, \"do not be angry\nwith your slave. I promised you, my dove, that I would find a husband\nfor you, and now all these gallant gentlemen are gathered for the\nchoice. It is your marriage-hour, my dove.\"\n\n\"Dom Antonio Pereira,\" the girl answered, \"for the last time I plead to\nyou. I am helpless here among you, and I have done you no injury: let me\ngo unharmed, I pray of you.\"\n\n\"Let you go unharmed? Why, who would hurt you, my dove?\" answered the\nsatyr. \"Yes, that is what I mean to do. I will let you go to a husband.\"\n\n\"I shall never go to any husband of your choosing, Dom Antonio,\" Juanna\nsaid again in a low and steady voice. \"Be assured of that, all of you. I\nhave no fear of you, for God will help me in my need. And now, as I have\npleaded to you for the last time, so for the last time I warn you, Dom\nAntonio, and your wicked companions also. Go on with this iniquity if\nyou will, but a judgment awaits you. Death from Heaven above is near to\nyou, you murderer, and after death, vengeance.\"\n\nThus she spoke, not loud indeed, but with conviction, a power, and a\ndignity of mien that carried terror to the hearts of the most hardened\nvillains there. It was at the conclusion of her speech that her eyes\nfirst met those of Leonard Outram. He was bending forward to listen,\nand in his grief and anger he had forgotten to preserve the truculent\nexpression which it was his part to wear. Once more Leonard's face was\nthe face of an English gentleman, noble and open, if somewhat stern.\n\nTheir eyes met, and there was that in his which caused Juanna to pause.\nShe looked at him swiftly as though she would read his very soul, and\nin answer he put all his will and heart's desire into his gaze, the will\nand the desire that she should know him to be her friend. They had\nnever met before, she did not even dream of his existence, and there\nwas little in Leonard's outward appearance to distinguish him from the\nruffians by whom he was surrounded. Yet her quick sense, sharpened by\ndespair, read what was written in his eyes, and read it aright. From\nthat moment Juanna felt that she was not alone among these wolves, that\nthere was one person at least who would save her if he could.\n\nIn an instant she had searched his face and dropped her eyes again,\nfearing lest she should awake suspicion. Then came a pause, for the\nminds of men were disturbed; she had aroused some remnant of conscience\nin them, she had called to life a lively terror of vengeance to come, of\nvengeance very near at hand. All were affected more or less, but chiefly\nwas he affected to whom she had addressed her words. The Yellow Devil\nsank back into the chair from which he had risen to speak, a wonderful\nchair made of ebony inlaid with ivory, and string-seated, with a\nfootstool attached to it. Superstitious dread took hold of him, and he\nshivered visibly.\n\nThe scene was one which Leonard never forgot. Above the bright moon\nshone in the heavens, before him were rank upon rank of evil faces, each\nmarked with some new emotion, and standing alone in their midst was the\nbeautiful girl, proud in the depth of her shame, defiant even in the\npower of foes gathered to destroy her.\n\nFor a while the wind had dropped and the silence was deep, so deep was\nit that Leonard could hear the mew of a kitten which had crept from the\nverandah, and was rubbing itself against Juanna's feet. She heard it\nalso, and, stooping, lifted the little creature and held it to her\nbreast.\n\n\"Let her go!\" said a voice from the crowd. \"She is a witch and will\nbring ill-luck upon us.\"\n\nAt the sound Pereira seemed to awake. With a hideous oath he flung\nhimself from the chair and waddled down the steps towards his victim.\n\n\"Curse you, you slut!\" he said, \"do you think to frighten men with your\nthreats? Let God help you if He can. The Yellow Devil is god here. You\nare as much in my power as this brute,\" and he snatched the kitten from\nher arms and dashed it to the ground. \"You see, God does not help the\nkitten, and He will not help you. Here, let men see what they are going\nto buy,\" and gripping the breast of her white robe he rent it open.\n\nWith one hand Juanna gathered up the torn dress, and with the other\nshe began to do something to her hair. An agony of fear took hold of\nLeonard. He knew the story of the poison which she carried: was she\nabout to use it?\n\nOnce again their eyes met, and there was warning in his glance. Juanna\nloosed her hair indeed, and let it fall about her shoulders, covering\nher rent robe to the waist, but she did no more. Only after this Leonard\nsaw that she kept her right hand closed, and knew that her death was\nhidden within it. Then she spoke once more to Pereira.\n\n\"In your last hour may you remember these two deeds!\" she said, pointing\nto the writhing kitten and to her torn dress.\n\nNow slaves drew near to do their master's bidding, but that audience\nwould not suffer this.\n\n\"Leave her alone,\" they said; \"we can see that the girl is fair and\nperfect.\"\n\nThen the slaves hung back, nor did Pereira repeat his commands.\n\nReturning to the verandah, he stood by the chair, and, taking an empty\nglass in his hand by way of an auctioneer's hammer, he began:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I am going to offer you a very choice lot, so choice that\nit makes up all the sale. The lot is a white girl, half English and half\nPortuguese by blood. She is well educated and devout; as to her docility\nI can say nothing, that will be for her husband to attend to. Of her\nbeauty I need not speak; you can all see it yourselves. Look at that\nfigure, that hair, those eyes; have any of you known their equal?\n\n\"Well, this lot will be sold to him among you who is inclined to make\nme the largest present in compensation; yes, he may take her this very\nhour, and my blessing with her. But there are conditions: he whom I\napprove must be lawfully married to the girl by the priest Francisco\nhere,\" and turning he pointed to a small melancholy-looking man, with a\nwomanish face and dark blue eyes, who stood in the background, clothed\nin a somewhat tattered priest's robe. \"Then I shall have done my duty by\nher. One more thing, gentlemen: we are not going to waste time in little\nbids; the upset price will be thirty ounces.\"\n\n\"Silver?\" said a voice.\n\n\"Silver? No, of course not. Do you think you are bidding for a nigger\ngirl, fool? Gold, man, gold! Thirty ounces of gold, and payment to be\nmade on the nail.\"\n\nThere was a groan of disappointment, and one ruffian cried out:\n\n\"What are we poor fellows to do? Thirty ounces for a beginning! Where is\nour chance?\"\n\n\"What are you to do? Why, work hard at your profession, and grow rich,\nof course! Do you suppose that these prizes are for the poor? Now then,\nthe fair is open. Who bids for the white girl Juanna? Thirty ounces is\noffered. What advance, what advance?\"\n\n\"Thirty-five,\" said a wizened little man with a hectic cough, who looked\nfitter for a burial than a bridal.\n\n\"Forty!\" cried another, a pure-bred Arab of stately appearance and\nsaturnine expression, who wished to add to his harem.\n\n\"Forty-five,\" answered the wizened man.\n\nThen the Arab bid fifty, and for a while it seemed that these two alone\nwere competitors. When the bids had reached seventy ounces the Arab\nmuttered \"Allah!\" and gave up. He preferred to wait for the houris.\n\n\"Knock her down,\" said the wizened man, \"she is mine.\"\n\n\"Hold on a bit, my little friend,\" said the great Portugee, Xavier, who\nhad passed the water-gate before Leonard and his companions. \"I am going\nto begin now. Seventy-five.\"\n\n\"Eighty,\" said the little man.\n\n\"Eighty-five,\" answered Xavier.\n\n\"Ninety,\" screamed the other.\n\n\"Ninety-five,\" said Xavier.\n\n\"A hundred,\" yelled the small man, snapping his fingers.\n\n\"A hundred and five,\" replied Xavier, triumphantly capping his bid.\n\nThen with a curse his antagonist gave up also, and the mob shouted,\nthinking that Xavier had won.\n\n\"Knock her down, Pereira,\" said Xavier in his turn, as he surveyed his\nprize with affected nonchalance.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" put in Leonard, speaking for the first time. \"I am\ngoing to begin now. A hundred and ten.\"\n\nThe multitude shouted again, the contest was growing exciting. Xavier\nglared at Leonard and bit his fingers with rage. He was very near his\nlimit of possible expenditure.\n\n\"Now then,\" cried Pereira, licking his lips for joy, since the price\nhad already run twenty ounces higher than he expected, \"Now then, friend\nXavier, am I to knock down this beauty to the stranger captain Pierre?\nIt sounds a lot, but she is cheap at the price, dirt cheap. Look at her\nand bid up. But mind, it is cash down--no credit, no, not for an ounce.\"\n\n\"A hundred and fifteen,\" said Xavier, with the air of a man making his\nlast throw for fortune.\n\n\"A hundred and twenty,\" replied Leonard quietly.\n\nHe had bid to the last ounce in his possession, and if Xavier went\nfurther he must give in, unless, indeed, he chose to offer Soa's ruby in\npayment. This, needless to say, he was not anxious to do; moreover,\nno one would believe a stone of that size to be genuine. Of all this,\nhowever, Leonard showed nothing in his face, but turning coolly he\ncalled to a slave-girl to bring him spirits and busied himself with\nfilling his glass. His hand never trembled, for he knew well that his\nantagonist was watching for a cue, and if he showed uncertainty all\nmight be lost. But in his heart, Leonard wondered what he should do if\nanother ounce was bid.\n\nMeanwhile the spectators were shouting encouragement, and Pereira was\nurging Xavier to increase his offer. For a while the Portugee hesitated,\nsurveying Juanna, who stood pale and silent, her head bowed upon her\nbreast. At this juncture Leonard turned, the glass still in his hand.\n\n\"Did you make any advance, senor?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, curse you! Take her. I will not put down another ounce for her or\nany woman on the earth.\"\n\nLeonard only smiled and looked at Pereira.\n\n\"Going!\" said that worthy; \"the white girl, Juanna, is going to the\nstranger Pierre for one hundred and twenty ounces of gold. Going! Come,\nXavier, don't lose her. If you do you will only be sorry once, and that\nwill be always. Now, for the last time,\" and he lifted his glass in his\nhand and paused.\n\nXavier made a step forward and opened his lips to speak.\n\nLeonard's heart stood still, but presently the Portugee changed his mind\nand turned away.\n\n\"_Gone!_\" screamed Pereira, bringing the glass down so heavily on the\narm of his chair that it flew into fragments.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nA MIDNIGHT MARRIAGE\n\n\"Gone,\" said Pereira again. \"Now, friend Pierre, before we ratify this\nmatter by the aid of holy Church, perhaps you will table the gold. This\nis a cash transaction, remember.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered Leonard. \"Where is that black dog of mine, the\ndwarf? Ah! there he is. Dog, weigh out the stuff; if you have not\nenough, here is more.\" And he unbuckled his belt, from which he had been\ncareful to extract the ruby, and threw it to Otter.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen and companions,\" he went on, \"for I hope that we may do\nbusiness together by and by, drink my health and my bride's. I have\npaid pretty dear for her, but what of it? A gentleman of our profession\nshould always be ready to back his fancy, for if his is apt to be a\nshort life he may as well make it a merry one.\"\n\n\"She will think the better of you, and you of her for it,\" cried\na voice. \"Here is to Captain Pierre and the girl.\" And they drank,\nshouting aloud in their half-drunken merriment.\n\nMeanwhile Otter, advancing with obsequious steps, was pouring handful\nafter handful of gold coin and ingots into the large scales which\nPereira caused to be held before him. At length all the gold was in, a\nshining heap.\n\n\"The balance does not turn,\" said Xavier; \"I claim the girl.\"\n\n\"Baas,\" said Otter in a low voice, and speaking in Dutch, \"have you more\ngold? The weight is short.\"\n\nLeonard glanced carelessly at the scales: they were trembling on the\nturn.\n\n\"As much as you like,\" he said, \"but here is what will do it.\"\n\nAnd drawing off his signet ring he threw it on the pile. The ruby\nexcepted, it was the last thing of value that he had about him. Then the\nscale vibrated and sank down.\n\n\"Good,\" said Pereira, rubbing his hands at the sight of so much\ntreasure. \"Bring me the acid that I may test the stuff. No offence,\nstranger Pierre, but this is a wicked world, in which brass has passed\nfor gold before to-day.\"\n\nThe acid was brought and the ingots were tested at hazard, Pereira\nholding them up to the light of a lamp.\n\n\"They are good,\" he said. \"Now, Father, do your part.\"\n\nThe priest Francisco stepped forward. He was very pale and seemed\nterrified. Leonard, watching him, wondered what had brought him into\nsuch company, for the man's face was good and even refined.\n\n\"Dom Antonio,\" said the priest in a soft girlish voice, \"I protest\nagainst this. Fate has brought me among you, though not of my own\nwill, and I have been forced to bear the sight of much evil, but I have\nwrought none. I have shriven the dying, I have ministered to the sick, I\nhave comforted the oppressed, but I have taken no share of the price of\nblood. I am a priest of our holy Church, and if I wed these two before\nthe sight of men, they will be husband and wife till death, and I shall\nhave set the seal of the blessing of the Church upon an act of shame. I\nwill not do it.\"\n\n\"You will not do it, you shaveling traitor?\" screamed Pereira in a voice\nhoarse with rage. \"Do you want to follow your brother then? Look here,\nmy friend, either you obey me and marry these two or----\" and he hissed\na horrible threat.\n\n\"NO, no,\" said Leonard, anxious to find an escape from this abominable\nmockery. \"Let him be. What do the cheat's prayers matter? The lady and I\ncan do without them.\"\n\n\"I tell you, stranger, that you shall marry the girl, and this sniveller\nmust marry you. If you don't, I will keep both her and the gold. And as\nfor him, he can choose. Here, slaves, bring the _sjamboch_.\"\n\nFrancisco's delicate face flushed pink. \"I am no hero that I can suffer\nthus,\" he said; \"I will do your bidding, Dom Antonio, and may God\nforgive me the sin! For you, Pierre and Juanna, I am about to make you\nman and wife, to join you in a sacrament that is none the less holy and\nindissoluble because of the dreadful circumstances under which it is\ncelebrated. I say to you, Pierre, abandon your wickedness, and love and\ncherish this woman, lest a curse from heaven fall upon you. I say\nto you, Juanna, put your trust in God, the God of the fatherless and\noppressed, who will avenge your wrongs--and forgive me. Let water be\nbrought, that I may consecrate it--water and a ring.\"\n\n\"Here, take this one,\" said Pereira, lifting Leonard's signet ring from\nthe pile of gold. \"I give it back for a luck-penny.\"\n\nAnd he tossed the ring to the priest.\n\nWater was brought in a basin, and the father consecrated it.\n\nThen he bade Leonard stand by the girl and motioned to the crowd to fall\nback from them. All this while Leonard had been watching Juanna. She\nsaid no word, and her face was calm, but her eyes told him the terror\nand perplexity which tore her heart.\n\nOnce or twice she lifted her clenched right hand towards her lips, then\ndropped it without touching them. Leonard knew but too well what deed\nshe meditated. He knew also the deadly nature of the drug she carried.\nIf once it touched her tongue! The suspense was terrible. He could bear\nit no longer; even at the risk of discovery he must speak with her.\n\nIn obedience to the priest's direction he sauntered to her side\nlaughing. Then, still laughing, with his hand he separated the tresses\nof dark hair, as though to look at the beauty of her side face, and bent\ndown as if to kiss her.\n\nShe stood pale and rigid, but once more her hand was lifted towards her\nmouth.\n\n\"Stop,\" he whispered swiftly into her ear, speaking in English, \"I have\ncome to rescue you. Go through with this farce, it means nothing. Then,\nif I bid you, run for the drawbridge into the slave-camp.\"\n\nShe heard, a light of intelligence shone in her eyes, and her hand fell\nagain.\n\n\"Come, stop that, friend Pierre,\" said Pereira suspiciously. \"What are\nyou whispering about?\"\n\n\"I was telling the bride how beautiful I think her,\" he answered\ncarelessly.\n\nJuanna turned and flashed on him a well-simulated glance of hate and\nscorn. Then the service began.\n\nThe young priest was gifted with a low and beautiful voice, and by the\nlight of the moon he read the ritual of marriage so solemnly that even\nthe villains who stood round ceased their jokes and sneers and were\nsilent. All things were done in order, though Juanna made no reply\nto the usual questions. With much sham courtesy the loathsome Pereira\npresided over the ceremony--their hands were joined, the ring was set\nupon Juanna's finger, the blessing was pronounced, and it was finished.\n\nAll this while Leonard stood like a man in a dream. He felt as though he\nwere really being married; it even came into his mind, as he looked upon\nthe loveliness of the mock bride at his side, that a worse fate might\nbefall him. Then of a sudden he woke from his reverie--the farce was\nplayed, now they must strive to escape.\n\n\"There, that is done with, Dom Antonio,\" he said, \"and I think I heard\nthis lady whisper that with your permission we will bid you good-bye. My\ncanoe----\"\n\n\"Nonsense, you will stop here to-night,\" said Pereira.\n\n\"Thanks, I think not,\" answered Leonard. \"To-morrow I may return to do a\nlittle business of another kind. I have a commission for about fifty, at\na good price for the right sort.\"\n\nAs Leonard spoke thus, glancing to the east, he saw dense masses of\nvapour rising into the air far away. The damp reeds were fired at last.\nThe Settlement men had not failed in their task, and soon the flames\nwould be discovered; he must be gone and swiftly.\n\n\"Well, if you must, you must,\" answered Pereira, and Leonard observed\nthat he looked relieved as he said it. He did not know the reason at the\ntime. It was this: Juanna had told him that the man who bought her\nwould find his death in it. He had a superstitious fear of the girl, and\nbelieved her; therefore he was glad that her purchaser should go, lest\nit might be said that he had murdered him in order to retain both the\nwoman and her price. So he bade him farewell, and Leonard turned to\ndepart, followed by Otter and Juanna, whom he led by the hand.\n\nAll might have gone well for that time had it not been for an unlucky\nchance. Leonard's scheme was to walk towards the water-gate, but, if no\nbetter plan of reaching it should offer, to turn suddenly and run for\nthe drawbridge, where Soa and the others would be waiting, and thence,\nwith or without the people of Mavoom, to escape up the banks of the\nZambesi.\n\nAlready he had started when the great Portuguese, Xavier, who was\nwatching plunged in sullen thought, stepped forward. \"At least I will\nhave a kiss for my trouble,\" he said, and seizing Juanna round the\nwaist, he drew her towards him.\n\nThen it was that Leonard forgot his caution, as under such circumstances\na man, with nerves already strained to breaking point, well might do.\nDoubling his fist, he struck the giant in the face with such force that\nXavier fell headlong to the ground, dragging Juanna after him. Leonard\nwould have done better had he suffered her to be insulted, but just then\nhe remembered only that he was protecting a helpless girl.\n\nJuanna was up in a moment and at his side. Xavier also sprang to his\nfeet, cursing with fury and drawing his sabre as he rose.\n\n\"Follow me,\" said Leonard to Juanna and Otter. Then without more ado he\ntook to his heels.\n\nA shout of laughter went up from the mob.\n\n\"This is the brave man. This is the French fire-eater,\" they cried. \"He\nstrikes unawares and is afraid to fight.\" Nor did they stop at words.\nAll of them were jealous of the stranger, and would have rejoiced to see\nhim dead.\n\n\"Stop him!\" they shouted, and many of the men started, running like dogs\nto turn a hare.\n\nStill Leonard might have won through, for he was swift of foot. But\nneither Juanna nor Otter could run so fast as he, and his pace must\nbe their pace. Before he had gone a hundred yards he found himself\nconfronted by a dozen or more of the slavers, some of whom had knives in\ntheir hands.\n\n\"Stop, coward, stop and fight,\" they yelled in Portuguese and Arabic,\nwaving their weapons in his face.\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered Leonard, wheeling round and glancing about him.\n\nThere, not thirty yards away, was the drawbridge of the slave camp, and\nhe thought that he saw it tremble, as if it was about to fall. At his\nside were Otter and Juanna, and towards him, his hideous face red\nwith blood, rushed the great Portugee, sabre aloft, and screaming\nimprecations.\n\n\"Otter,\" Leonard said quickly, as he drew his sword, \"guard my back, for\nwhen I have killed this one the rest will spring. For you, young lady,\nreach the bridge if you can. Soa and your people are there.\"\n\nNow Xavier was upon him with a rush. He struck furiously, and Leonard\navoided the blow, springing backwards out of his reach. Twice more he\nrushed on thus and twice he smote, but each time Leonard ran backward\ntowards the drawbridge, that now was not more than twenty yards away.\nA fourth time the Portugee came on, and the Englishman could not repeat\nhis tactics, for the mob hemmed him in behind. On sped Xavier and smote\nhis hardest: Leonard saw the steel gleam in the moonlight and lifted his\nsword to guard. The blow fell, fire sprang from it in sparks, and down\nrattled fragments of shattered steel. His sword was broken.\n\n\"Fight on, Baas,\" said the voice of Otter, \"fight on! Both swords have\ngone.\"\n\nLeonard looked up. It was true: the Portugee was casting aside his\nbroken weapon and clutching at his knife. Now Leonard had no knife, and\nat the moment he never thought of his revolver. But he still held the\nhilt of his sword, and with it he sprang straight at Xavier, who rushed\nto meet him.\n\nThey met with a dull shock as bull meets bull. Leonard struck one blow\nwith the broken sword-hilt, then dropped it--it was useless. But the\nstroke did him good service, for, falling on the right hand of the\nPortugee, it paralysed his arm for a second, causing him to let fall the\ndagger. Then they gripped each other, fighting desperately with their\nnaked strength alone. Twice the huge Portugee lifted the Englishman\nfrom the ground, striving to throw him, while the crowd yelled with\nexcitement, but twice he failed. Not for nothing had Leonard learnt\nwrestling as a lad and hardened his iron muscles by years of toil.\nXavier may have weighed sixteen stone and Leonard did not weigh\nthirteen, but his arms were like bars of steel and he was struggling for\ndear life.\n\nHe waited awhile, letting the Portugee exhaust himself in efforts to\nhurl him to the ground. Then suddenly tightening his grip, Leonard put\nout all his strength. He could not hope to lift the man, that he knew,\nbut he might throw him. With a sudden movement he hooked his right leg\nbehind Xavier's left calf. Then he cast his weight forward and pushed\nwith all his strength upon the great man's breast.\n\nXavier tottered, recovered himself, tottered again, and strove to shift\nhis leg. Leonard felt the movement and met it with a supreme effort.\nLosing his balance, his foe swayed slowly backwards like a falling tree,\nthen fell with a thud that shook the ground. It was a gallant throw, and\neven the \"ranks of Tusculum\" as represented by the slave-drivers \"could\nscarce forbear to cheer.\" Now Leonard lay upon the breast of the man,\nfor he was dragged to earth with him.\n\nFor a moment his enemy was still, breathing stertorously, for the shock\nof their fall had been great. Leonard looked round; there, some eight\nfeet away, was the knife, and he who could grasp it must win this deadly\ngame. But how could he grasp it? Xavier, whose strength and powers\nwere coming back, still hugged him in his fearful grip; he also saw the\nknife, and would win it. Rapidly, by instinct almost, Leonard measured\nthe distance with his eye. There was but one plan, to roll to it. The\nfirst roll would leave him undermost, but the dagger would still be out\nof Xavier's reach. Then, could he succeed in turning him upon his back\nonce more, Leonard would be uppermost again, and if he was able to free\nhis hand it might grasp the weapon. It was a terrible risk, but he\nmust take it. He lay motionless awhile, husbanding his force, and the\nPortugee surged and heaved beneath him; he could feel the muscles of his\nmighty frame start up in knots as he struggled. At last Leonard let\nhim have his way, and over they went, the two of them. Now Xavier was\nuppermost, and the mob yelled in triumph, for they thought that the\nstranger's strength was spent.\n\n\"The knife, the knife!\" gasped Xavier, and one of his servants sprang\nforward to give it to him. But Otter was watching and started out of the\npress, naked sabre in hand: his fierce and ugly face was twitching with\nexcitement, his black eyes shone, and his vast shoulders worked to and\nfro. To Juanna, fascinated by the fearful struggle, the dwarf looked\nlike some black gnome, like a thing of supernatural power, half toad,\nhalf human.\n\n\"He who touches the knife dies!\" he said in guttural Arabic, stretching\nhis long arm and sabre over it. \"Let these cocks fight it out, my\nmasters.\"\n\nThe man shrank back: he also was afraid of Otter, deeming him uncanny;\nnor did any other interfere.\n\nNow came the moment of death or victory. As he could not reach the\nweapon, with a sudden movement Xavier freed his right hand and grasped\nthe Englishman's throat; but to do this he must lessen the pressure on\nhis breast. Leonard felt the grip, and the knowledge that his end was\nat hand renewed his powers. Twice he writhed like a snake, gripping the\nground with the muscles of his back and legs; once he swung his frame to\nthe right, then a vast effort, and lo! Xavier turned slowly over like a\nlog of wood, and again Leonard lay upon his breast.\n\nLeonard lay upon his breast, and his right arm was free and within reach\nof the dagger. But the giant's grasp of his throat was cruel; the blood\ndrummed in his ears and his senses began to fail. No, he would not die\nthus and leave the girl helpless. Where was it? He was blind, he could\nsee nothing but her white face. He must get free--ah, he knew now!\n\nThey thought that he was spent: see! his head fell, when suddenly he\nlifted himself and heaved up his arm.\n\nCrash it came full on the forehead of Xavier, that in its turn was\npillowed on the stony earth. The grip slackened. Crash again, a fearful\nand despairing blow! Leonard's throat was free, and the air rushed into\nhis bursting lungs. Now he could see and grasp the knife, but there\nwas no need to use it. The great man beneath him flung his arms wide,\nshivered, and grew still.\n\nThen it was, while men paused wondering at those awful blows, that\nJuanna, mindful of her deliverer's bidding, turned and fled, sick at\nheart but unhindered, to the edge of the ditch opposite the drawbridge.\nOtter also rushed up and dragged Leonard from the ground.\n\n\"_Wow!_\" he cried, \"a good fight and a great blow! Dead, by my mother's\nspirit, and no touch of steel. Awake, my father, awake! for if the boar\nis down the pigs remain!\"\n\nLeonard heard his words dimly and knew their import. With an effort he\nceased to stagger and rested his weight upon the dwarf, much as a man\nmight lean upon some sturdy post. His breath came back to him and his\nmind cleared. He looked round and saw Juanna standing near the bridge\nlike one who hesitates whether to fly or stay.\n\n\"Sirs,\" gasped Leonard, \"I have fought and I have won. Now let me go in\npeace with the girl. Is the man alive?\"\n\nA ring of men had crowded round the body of Xavier, and in their centre\nknelt the priest Francisco. At this moment he rose and said:\n\n\"It is useless to minister to him; he is no more.\"\n\nThe slavers looked at Leonard with awe not unmixed with admiration. Who\nhad ever seen such a thing, that one whose strength had been a byword\nshould be slain with the naked fist? They forgot that it is easy to kill\nthe man whose head rests upon a stone.\n\nPresently, however, their wonder gave way to rage. Xavier had been\na favourite among them, and they were not minded that he should die\nunavenged. So they drew round Leonard scowling and cursing.\n\n\"Stand back,\" he said, \"and let me pass. I fought your friend fairly;\nhad I wished to take advantage of him, should I not have used this?\" And\nfor the first time he remembered and drew his Colt, the sight of which\ncooled their ardour somewhat, for they gave way. \"Perhaps you will give\nme an arm, Father,\" Leonard went on, speaking to the priest, who was\nstanding by. \"I am much shaken.\"\n\nFrancisco complied, and they started towards Juanna, Otter guarding\ntheir rear with his sabre. Before they had gone ten yards, however,\nPereira waddled towards them after a hasty consultation with one of his\ncaptains.\n\n\"Seize that man,\" he shouted; \"he has killed the worthy Dom Xavier:\nhaving first insulted him, he has slain him by violence, and he must\nanswer for it.\"\n\nA dozen ruffians sprang forward at his bidding, only to be met by the\nsabre and pistol of Otter, with neither of which were they anxious\nto make a closer acquaintance. Leonard saw that the position was very\ngrave, and a thought came into his mind. \"You wish to escape from this\nplace, Father?\" he said rapidly to the priest.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Francisco, \"it is a hell.\"\n\n\"Then lead me as swiftly as you may to that bridge; I am hurt and weak,\nbut there is succour beyond.\"\n\nAs he spoke the drawbridge, which was not ten yards away, fell with a\ncrash.\n\n\"Run across, Juanna Rodd,\" cried Leonard in English.\n\nShe hesitated, then obeyed. It seemed to Leonard that the look upon her\nface said, \"How can I leave you?\"\n\n\"Now, Father,\" said Leonard, \"make a rush for it,\" and leaning on the\npriest's shoulder he stumbled towards the bridge. But he would never\nhave reached it had it not been for Otter.\n\n\"Treason!\" roared Pereira; \"stop him! Who let down the bridge?\"\n\nA man came on the attack; it was the same young captain that Leonard\nhad offered to fight before the auction. In his hand was a knife already\nuplifted to fall on Leonard's back when Otter's sabre flashed and the\nman went down.\n\n\"Seize the bridge and hold it,\" roared Pereira again.\n\n\"Wind up! wind up!\" yelled Otter in answer, as with sabre and pistol he\nheld back the mob.\n\nThose on the further side obeyed with such a will that Leonard and the\npriest rolled down the slanting planks.\n\n\"Otter!\" cried Leonard--\"good God! he will be killed!\"\n\nBy way of answer Otter fired the last barrel of his pistol. Then with\na yell, before his foes could close upon him he sprang like a wild cat\nstraight at the iron chains of the bridge, which were used to secure\nit in its place when needful. At the moment they hung four feet or more\nabove his head, but he grasped them and shouted to Soa to hoist away.\n\nA man attempted to seize his legs, but Otter kicked him in the face\nand he fell into the water. Next second he was out of their reach and\nrapidly rising high into the air. Some threw knives and some fired\npistol-shots after him, but none of these touched him.\n\n\"Ah! Yellow Devil,\" the dwarf cried as he swung, \"look behind you: there\nis another devil, yellower and fiercer than you.\"\n\nPereira turned and all his company with him, and at that moment, with\na crackling roar, a vast sheet of flame burst up from the morass. The\nreeds had caught at last in good earnest, and the strengthening wind was\nbringing the fire down upon them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nVENGEANCE\n\n\"Treachery! treachery!\" screamed Pereira. \"The reeds are fired, and that\nwitch has betrayed us.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha! ha!\" cried Otter again from his airy perch. \"Treachery!\ntreachery! And what if the slaves are loosed? And what if the gates be\nbarred?\"\n\nHitherto the mob had been silent in their fear and wonder. There they\nstood closely packed, a hundred or more of them, staring first at Otter,\nthen at the advancing flames. Now they found tongue.\n\n\"He is a fiend! Kill him! Storm the slave camp! To the gates!\" they\nyelled in this language and in that.\n\nFor many it was their last earthly cry, since at that moment a sheet of\nflame burst from the rampart of the camp, followed by the boom of\nthe cannon, and six pounds of canister swept through the crowd. Right\nthrough them it swept, leaving a wide lane of dead and dying; and such a\nshriek went up to heaven as even that place of torment had never heard.\n\nThen they broke and fled this way and that, screaming curses as they\nwent.\n\nWhen Leonard and the priest had rolled down the rising bridge they found\nJuanna standing safely by the guard-house, surrounded by some of the\nSettlement men.\n\n\"To the gun!\" he cried, \"to the gun! Fire into them! I will follow you.\"\n\nThen it was that he saw Otter left to his death and called out in fear.\nBut Otter saved himself as has been told, and clambered down the bridge\nsafe and sound.\n\nLeaning on the dwarf and Francisco, Leonard, followed by Juanna,\nstaggered along the earthwork to the place where the gun was mounted.\nBefore he had gone a step he caught sight of the figure of Soa, outlined\nin bold relief against the background of the fire and surrounded by many\nof the freed Settlement men. At the instant when he saw her she was in\nthe act of springing back from the breech of the gun, the lanyard in her\nhand. Then came the roar of the shot and the shriek of the smitten.\n\n\"_Wow!_\" said Otter, \"the old woman has not been idle. She is clever as\na man, that one.\"\n\nAnother minute and they were helping to reload the piece, that is,\nexcept Soa, who was on her knees kissing Juanna's hands.\n\n\"Come, stop that!\" said Leonard, sinking to the ground, for he was\nutterly exhausted. \"Those devils have gone for their arms. They will try\nto storm us presently. Is the shot home, Peter? Then run her out, sharp;\nand you, Soa, screw her nose down.\" Next he bade the freed slaves arm\nthemselves with stakes or anything that they could find, for of rifles\nthey had but four, two of which they had found in the guard-house.\n\nPresently the slavers came on with a yell, carrying long planks, by the\nhelp of which they hoped to cross the dike.\n\n\"Look out!\" said Leonard, \"they are going to open fire. Under the\nearthwork, every man of you!\" And seizing Juanna who was standing near,\nhe pulled her down into cover.\n\nIt was not too soon, for next instant a storm of bullets swept over\nthem. Most of the men had understood and taken shelter, but some were\ntoo slow or too stupid. Of these one fell dead and two more were hit.\nSoa and Peter alone took no heed, and yet they remained unhurt. There\nstood the woman, while the bullets whistled round her, laying the gun as\ncoolly as though she had served in the Royal Artillery, and with her was\nthe head-man, Peter. Peter was shot through the waist-cloth and a ball\ncut its way through Soa's grizzled hair, but neither of them seemed to\nnotice these trifles.\n\n\"They are mad, Baas,\" cried Otter, who was watching the enemy over the\ntop of the embankment. \"See! they are coming across the open.\"\n\nLeonard looked. The dwarf was right: in their rage and hurry the\nslavers, half hidden in a cloud of smoke caused by their rapid firing,\nwere advancing across the clear space instead of creeping along the edge\nof the dike. What was more, the necessity of carrying the planks caused\nthem to pack in groups. Soa gave a final twist with her lever and\nwaited, her hand on the lanyard. A bullet cut it in two, but without\nfiring the gun, and she grasped the shortened cord.\n\n\"Now for it!\" cried Leonard, as the first party came into the line of\nfire.\n\nSoa sprang backwards with a yell: again the piece thundered out, and the\ncanister screamed through the air. It tore along the advancing files,\nthen, striking the beaten earth, rebounded and caught those who were\nfollowing with the ricochet, and with awful effect. Whole groups were\nmowed down by this one discharge, the destruction being twice as large\nas that caused by the first shot, for at this greater range the canister\nfound room to spread. Also the rebounding missiles flying hither and\nthither among the crowd did no little execution. Down went the men in\nheaps, and with them the planks they carried. They had no more wish\nto storm the slave camp; they had but one thought left, the thought of\nsafety, and the survivors of them fled in all directions, yelling with\nfear and fury.\n\n\"Load up, load up!\" cried Otter, lifting the charge of powder which lay\nat hand. \"They will try to break open the gates and get out, then they\nwill cut us off.\"\n\nAs he spoke they saw many men run from the auction-shed to the\nwater-gate. But it could not be climbed, the key was gone, and the\nmassive bolts and beams were not easy to break. So they brought hammers\nand a tree-trunk which had supported an angle of the shed, and battered\nat the gate. For two minutes or more it held, then it began to give.\n\n\"Swift! swift!\" cried Otter again as he dragged at the cannon to turn\nit, \"or all will yet be lost.\"\n\n\"Hurry no man's ox, Black One,\" said Soa, as she laid the gun with the\nhelp of Peter.\n\nA cry went up from the slavers; the gate was tottering, but it still\nheld by the upper hinges. A few more blows and it must surely fall. But\nthose blows were never struck. Again Soa sprang backwards, and the roar\nof the gun was answered by the screams of the slavers as the shrapnel\nploughed through them.\n\nOf those who were left the most part fled for shelter to the auction-hut\nand to the Nest itself. Some ran across to the magazine, but appeared to\nbe unable to enter it, for soon they were seen flying back again, while\nabout a dozen of the boldest remained at the gate trying to complete its\ndestruction. On these Leonard and Otter opened fire with rifles, but\nit was not until three or four of them had fallen that the rest fled to\njoin their companions beneath the shelter of the sheds.\n\n\"Oh! look, look!\" said Juanna, pointing to the east.\n\nIt was indeed a spectacle never to be forgotten.\n\nThe dense reeds, measuring twelve to fifteen feet in height, had been\nfired far to the east of the Nest, and as the wind gathered to a gale\nand the fire got firmer hold, it rolled down upon the doomed place in\nbillows and sheets--a sea of flame that sometimes spouted high into the\nair and sometimes ran swiftly along the ground.\n\nThe reeds crackled and roared like musketry as the fire ate into them,\ngiving out thick volumes of smoke. At first this smoke had passed above\nthe spectators, now it blew into their faces, half choking them and\nblotting out the sky, and mixed up with it were showers of sparks and\nfragments of burning reeds brought forward on the wind.\n\n\"The house and sheds will soon catch now,\" said Leonard; \"then they must\ntake refuge in the open spaces, where we can deal with them,\" and he\nnodded towards the gun.\n\nAs he spoke tongues of flame darted into the air, first from the thatch\nof the shed, then from the roof of the Nest. They were afire.\n\n\"We must be careful, Baas,\" said Otter, \"or the slave-shelters behind us\nwill burn also, and all those in them.\"\n\n\"Heavens! I never thought of that,\" answered Leonard. \"Here, Father, if\nyou wish to do a good work, take some of these people and the buckets\nthey use to water the slaves. Let three or four men get on to each roof\nand extinguish the sparks as they fall, while others bring them water\nfrom the moat.\"\n\nThe priest sprang up and set to the task, at which he laboured gallantly\nfor two long hours. Had it not been for his efforts, the sheds and the\nslaves in them must have been burnt, for the sparks fell thick upon the\ndry thatch, which caught again and again.\n\nNow the sights and sounds grew more and more fearful. Maddened with\nfear, the remainder of the slave-drivers and their servants rushed from\nthe flaming buildings, striving to escape from the fire. Some flung\nthemselves desperately into the aloes and prickly-pears on the inner\nrampart, and, climbing the palisade beyond, escaped into the marsh,\nwhile some collected on the open space, and at these the gun was fired\nfrom time to time when the smoke lifted. Others again ran to the dike of\nthe slave camp begging for mercy, there to be shot by Otter, who never\nwearied in his task of revenge. From behind them also rose the hideous\ncries of the slaves, who believed that they were about to be burned\nalive, and screamed as they dragged at their manacles.\n\n\"Oh, it is like hell!\" said Juanna to Leonard, as she buried her face\nin the grass that she might see no more, and to escape the suffocating\nsmoke. She was right.\n\nSo the time went on. One by one the roofs of the various buildings fell\nin, and spouts of flame shot high into the air to descend about them\nin a rain of sparks. But at last the cries ceased, for even the slaves\ncould yell no more; the fire grew less and less, and the wind dropped.\nThen the sun rose on the scene of death and desolation. The morass\nwas swept bare to the depth of many hundred yards, and the camp was a\nsmoking ruin strewn with the dead. The walls of the Nest still stood,\nhowever, and here and there a charred post remained. Everything else was\ngone, except the magazine, which had escaped the flames, being built of\nbrick and stone, and roofed with tin.\n\nThe adventurers looked around them in silence, then they looked at\neach other. What a spectacle they presented in the clear light of\nthe morning, as they stood by the gun which had done them such signal\nservice! All were begrimed with smoke and powder, and their clothes were\nburnt by the falling sparks. Leonard's throat was a mass of bruises, his\nhands and face were bleeding, and he was so stiff and hurt that he could\nscarcely move. Soa's hair was singed and cut by the bullet which had\nshaved her head; the priest's robe hung in charred threads, and his\nhands were blistered with fire; Juanna's broidered Arab dress, torn by\nthe brutal hand of Pereira, scarcely retained a trace of white, and her\nlong dark locks were tangled and powdered with bits of blackened reed.\nAll were utterly exhausted--that is, all except Otter, who advanced\nto speak to Leonard, begrimed and stripped to the waist, but fresh and\nfierce as ever.\n\n\"What is it, Otter?\" he asked.\n\n\"Will the Baas let me take these men,\" and he nodded towards the freed\nslaves who had belonged to the Settlement, \"and hunt through the\ncamp yonder? Many of the devils still live, and wounded snakes strike\nhardest.\"\n\n\"As you like,\" answered Leonard. \"Arm them with anything you can find,\nand search the camp thoroughly. But be careful.\"\n\nIn ten minutes Otter was gone with the men. Then Leonard and the others\nfetched water and washed as best they might, the guard-house being\nassigned to Juanna and Soa, who made their toilet with the help of a\ncomb they found in it. There also they discovered food, the rations of\nthe sentry, of which they ate with such appetite as they might, and a\nplentiful supply of meal for the slaves.\n\nAs they were finishing their breakfast Otter returned unharmed, though\nof the men who accompanied him five were missing. With him also were two\nof the four Settlement men who had been sent to fire the reeds on the\nprevious night. They were much exhausted, for their task had been no\neasy one, and fortunately for Leonard it was only after long delay that\nthey succeeded in it. Their two companions were dead: one had been taken\nby an alligator in the water, and the other had fallen into a deep hole\nin the morass, and, striking his head against a log, was drowned there.\n\n\"Is it finished?\" said Leonard to the dwarf.\n\nOtter nodded. \"Some are dead and some are fled,\" he answered; \"but from\nthese last we have little to fear, for they believe that an army has\ncome against them. Still that is not all the tale, Baas. We have taken\none of them alive. Come and look at him, Baas.\"\n\nLeonard clambered up the steps of the embankment, followed by the\nothers. On its further side stood the group of Settlement men who had\nreturned from scouring the camp, thin and haggard fellows, scarred by\nthe slave-irons, but very fierce-looking. In their midst a white man\ncrouched upon the ground, moaning with terror and misery. Just then he\nlifted his face--it was that of the Yellow Devil himself. There lay that\naged Iniquity, that hoary Shame caught at last in his own snares.\n\n\"Where did you find him, Otter?\" asked Leonard as they crossed the\ndrawbridge.\n\n\"In the magazine, Baas, and your gold with him, also many rifles and\nmuch powder. He had locked himself up there, but he had not the heart to\nfire the powder and make an end.\"\n\nPereira did not see them as yet, but raising his head he begged for\nwater.\n\n\"Give him blood,\" said one of the men sullenly. \"He has drunk it all his\ndays, let it be his last drink.\"\n\nLeonard motioned to Francisco the priest to bring water, then Pereira\nsaw them and began to pray for mercy.\n\n\"Antonio Pereira,\" Leonard answered sternly, \"last night I and two\ncompanions, a woman and a black dwarf, set ourselves a task--to take\nthis armed place of yours and rescue a white girl whom you had condemned\nto slavery. It did not seem possible that we should do it, but between\nsunset and sunrise we have done it. Who helped us then?--that we should\nhave carried out this thing which was impossible. I will tell you; God\nhelped us as He helped this lady when she called on Him. Cry to God,\nthen, to do that which is still more impossible--to help you. From me\nyou will have justice and no more.\"\n\nFor a moment Pereira ceased whining, and a flash of the old ferocity\ncame into his eyes.\n\n\"Ah! my friend,\" he muttered, \"if I had but known!\" Then turning to\nJuanna he said: \"My dove, have I not treated you kindly? Will you say no\nword for me, now that my enemies prevail against me?\"\n\nBy way of answer Juanna looked first at the human reptile before her,\nand next at the bosom of her torn dress, now roughly pinned up with the\nspikes of aloe leaves. Then she turned and went.\n\n\"Baas,\" said Otter, \"may I speak?\"\n\n\"Speak on,\" Leonard answered.\n\n\"Hearken, Yellow Devil,\" said the dwarf. \"Ten years ago you took me, and\nI lay in this camp a slave; yes, in yonder shed. Here are the marks of\nthe irons--your own seal. Ah! you have forgotten the black dwarf, or\nperhaps you never noticed him; but he remembers. Who could forget you,\nYellow Devil, that once had slept beneath your roof? I escaped, but as\nI fled I swore that, if I might, I would bring vengeance upon you. The\nyears went by, and the hour came at last. I led Baas to this place. I\nfound you this morning, and we are not parted yet, Yellow Devil. What\ndid you boast last night--that you had sent twenty thousand of us black\npeople to slavery? Yes, and for every one that you have sold you have\nkilled five--old men white with years, women with child, little children\nat the breast, you have murdered them all. Ah! yes, I have seen you\nlaugh and kill them before the eyes of their mothers, as last night you\nkilled the kitten.\n\n\"And now your time has come at last, Yellow Devil, and I, Otter the\ndwarf, will give you to drink of your own medicine. What! you cry for\nmercy, you who never gave it even in a dream? I tell you, did my chief\nyonder bid me loose you, I would disobey him even to force; I, who would\nrather die than put aside his word on any other matter.\n\n\"Look now at these men,\" and he pointed to the Settlement people, who\nglared hungrily at the crouching wretch, much as hounds glare at a fox\nthat is held aloft by the huntsman; \"look at them! Do you see mercy in\ntheir eyes? They, whose fathers and mothers you have murdered, whose\nlittle children you have stamped to death? _Wow!_ Yellow Devil, the\nwhite men tell us of a hell, a place where dead people are tormented. We\nknow nothing of that, it is for the white people, and they may keep\nit all to themselves. Now you are beginning to taste that hell of\nyours--only beginning, Yellow Devil.\n\n\"Baas Leonard, I demand this man to be tried by us and dealt with\naccording to our customs, for it is against us black folk that he has\nsinned most of all, and we ask his blood in payment for our blood.\"\n\n\"What!\" howled Pereira, \"am I to be given over to these black dogs?\nMercy! Mercy! Francisco, plead for me. Shrive me. I know I killed your\nbrother, I had to do it. Plead for me!\" and he rolled in the dust,\ntrying to clasp Leonard's feet.\n\n\"I cannot shrive you,\" answered the priest shuddering, \"but I will pray\nfor you.\"\n\nThen the hungry-eyed natives pounced upon Pereira to drag him thence,\nbut Leonard broke through them saying:\n\n\"I will have none of your savage cruelties here. Let the man be shot if\nyou will, but no more.\"\n\nAs it chanced, however, Pereira was not destined to die by the hand of\nman, for even as Otter gripped him he turned livid, threw up his arms,\ngroaned, and fell to the earth.\n\nLeonard looked at him; he was dead, dead through the fear of death, for\nterror had stopped the beating of his wicked heart.\n\n\"The Shepherdess prophesied truly,\" cried Otter presently, \"for the\nHeavens above have robbed us of our vengeance. _Wow!_ it is hard, but at\nleast this one shall work no more evil.\"\n\n\"Carry it away,\" said Leonard with a shudder, for the dead man's face\nwas ghastly to behold. Then turning to him as if nothing had happened,\nhe added:\n\n\"Otter, take these men and loose the rest of the slaves; then get the\nammunition, rifles, and stores from the arms-house and bring them to the\nwater-gate. We must clear out of this place at once, or we shall have\nthe escaped slavers and the crews of the dhows down upon us.\"\n\nThus then did fate at last find out Antonio Pereira, the Yellow Devil.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nDISILLUSION\n\nOnce more it was morning, and the travellers were encamped by that reedy\npoint where they had left the big boats which they cut loose from the\nisland. From the earliest dawn Leonard had been superintending the\ntransport across the river of the hundreds of slaves whom they had\nreleased. They there were put on shore by the Settlement men, provided\nwith a store of meal, and left to shift for themselves, it being found\nutterly impossible to take them any further.\n\n\"There, they are gone,\" said Otter, as the last boat-load set out under\nthe charge of Peter. \"Well, let them go, the silly sheep. So much the\nless trouble for us, who, although we have a Shepherdess, can scarcely\nlead so large a flock. Well, we have pulled the Missie yonder out of the\nSlave Nest, and the Yellow Devil--ah! we have talked with him and all\nhis crew. And now are we to go on to win the gold--the real Yellow\nDevil, Baas?\"\n\n\"I suppose so, Otter,\" answered Leonard--\"that is, if Soa keeps her\nword. But it isn't gold, it is rubies. At any rate we must make for the\nSettlement below Sena, to take these men back and see if we can hear\nanything of Mavoom.\"\n\n\"So,\" said Otter after a pause. \"Well, the Shepherdess, as these\nSettlement people call her, will want to find her father. Say, Baas, she\nis proud, is she not? She looks over our heads and speaks little.\"\n\n\"Yes, Otter, she is proud.\"\n\n\"And she is beautiful; no woman was ever so beautiful.\"\n\n\"Yes, Otter, she is beautiful.\"\n\n\"And she is cold, Baas; she does not say 'thank you' nicely for all that\nyou have done.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she thinks it the more, Otter.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she thinks it the more. Still, she might say 'thank you' to\nyou, Baas, who are her--husband.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I mean, Baas, that you bought her first, according to our custom, and\nmarried her afterwards according to your own, and if that does not make\nher your wife, nothing can.\"\n\n\"Stop that fool's talk,\" said Leonard angrily, \"and never let me hear\nyou repeat it. It was only a game that we played.\"\n\n\"As the Baas desires, so be it. I do but speak from my heart when I say\nthat she is your wife, and some might think that not so ill, for she is\nfair and clever. Will the Baas rise and come to the river to bathe, that\nhis soreness may leave him?\"\n\nLeonard took the suggestion, and came back from his bath a new man, for\nrest and the cold water had acted on him like magic. He was still stiff,\nindeed, and remained lame in one leg for ten days or more, but, with the\nexception of an aching of the throat where Xavier had gripped him, no\nother ill effects were left. Among the booty of the slave camp was\na good supply of clothing, flannel shirts, corduroy suits, and hats.\nCasting aside the rags of the Portuguese uniform in which he had\ndisguised himself, Leonard put on some of these articles and reappeared\nin the camp dressed like an ordinary English colonist, roughly indeed,\nbut becomingly.\n\nMeanwhile Juanna had also been making her toilet, with the help of\nSoa, who took this opportunity to tell her mistress the history of her\nmeeting with Leonard Outram. But, either from design or because she\nforgot to do so, she did not at this time tell her about the agreement\nwhich had been entered into between them. As yet Soa had never spoken\nfully to her mistress of her early life or of the mysterious People of\nthe Mist from whom she sprang, though she had taught her the language\nthey spoke. Perhaps, for reasons of her own, she did not think this a\nfavourable occasion on which to begin the story.\n\nWhen Soa had finished Juanna fell into a reverie. She remembered that\nshe had expressed no gratitude to Mr. Outram for his heroic rescue of\nher. Yet in her heart she was grateful enough. But for him she must now\nhave been dead, and the world of light and love would have closed its\ngates upon her for ever. Still, mixed up with her gratitude and earnest\nadmiration of the deed of heroism which had been wrought for her sake,\nwas another feeling, a feeling of resentment and alarm. This stranger,\nthis dark, keen-eyed, resolute man had bought her as a slave; more, he\nhad gone through a form of marriage with her that was not all a form,\nfor it had been solemnly celebrated by a priest, and there on her finger\nwas the memorial of it. Of course it meant nothing, but the thought of\nit angered her and offended her pride.\n\nLike other women, Juanna Rodd had not come to twenty years of age\nwithout dreaming of love, and, strange to say, her fancy had always\nchosen some such man as Leonard for the hero of the story. But that the\nhero should present himself in this ultra-heroic fashion, that he should\nbuy her with gold, that he should go through a form of marriage with\nher within an hour of their first meeting--for these things she had\nnot bargained. It was a fact--that marriage was an accomplished fact,\nalthough it might be null and void, and the female mind has a great\nrespect for accomplished facts. To a woman of Juanna's somewhat haughty\nnature this was very galling. Already she felt it to be so, and as\ntime went on the chain of its remembrance irked her more and more, a\ncircumstance which accounts for much of her subsequent conduct.\n\nThinking such thoughts as these, Juanna strolled back towards the camp\nalong a little pathway in the reeds, and suddenly came face to face with\nLeonard. She was clad in a white Arab robe, part of the loot, which she\nhad adapted cleverly to the purposes of a dress, fastening it round her\nslender waist with an embroidered scarf. She wore no hat, and her rich\ndark hair was twisted into a great knot that shone in the sunlight. In\nher hand she held some crimson lilies which she had gathered, that made\na spot of colour on the whiteness of her dress. The look of haunting\nterror was gone from her face, whose beauty had come back during her\nsleep; her changing eyes shone beneath their dark lashes, and she moved\nwith the grace of a fawn.\n\nSeen thus in that pure and pearly light against the green background\nof the feathered reeds, nothing could have seemed more sweet and lovely\nthan did this girl, this child of the forest and the river, who mingled\nin herself the different beauty of the Saxon and the Spaniard, ripened\nby the African sun and dignified by the long companionship of Nature.\nThere was a grace about her movements, a purity in her face, a mystery\nin the wide eyes and curved and smiling lips, such as Leonard had never\nseen before, and which overcame him utterly. Alas for the fickleness of\nthe human heart! from that moment the adoration of his youth, the dream\nof his lonely years of wandering, Jane Beach, began to grow faint\nand fade away. But though this was so, as yet he did not admit it to\nhimself; indeed, he scarcely knew it.\n\nJuanna looked up and saw him standing before her, proud and handsome,\nan air of command upon his thoughtful face, deep-chested, bearded,\nvigorous, a man amongst men. She saw the admiration in his eyes and\nblushed, knowing that, do what she would to prevent it, it was reflected\nin her own. She remembered all that this stranger had done for her, how\nhe had risked his life a hundred times, how she would now have been\ndead and unlovely were it not for his intrepid deeds, and remembering,\nsomething stirred at her heart.\n\nWas it gratitude that moved her thus? She did not know; but whatever it\nwas, she turned her head that he might not read it on her face. Another\nmoment, and she was holding out her hand to him and smiling pleasantly.\n\n\"Good morning,\" she said, \"I hope that you have slept well, and that you\nhave no bad news.\"\n\n\"I spent eight hours in a state of absolute stupor,\" he answered\nlaughing, \"and there is no news at all to speak of, except that I have\ngot rid of those slaves, poor creatures. I fancy that our friends, the\nslave-dealers yonder, have had enough of our company, and are scarcely\nlikely to follow us.\"\n\nJuanna turned a shade paler, and answered:\n\n\"I trust so. At least I have had enough of them. By the way, Mr. Outram,\nI--I--have to thank you for a great deal;\" here her eyes caught the\ngleam of the gold circlet on the third finger of her left hand--\"this\nring belongs to you, I will return it at once.\"\n\n\"Miss Rodd,\" said Leonard gravely, \"we have passed through a very\nstrange adventure together; will you not keep the ring in remembrance of\nit?\"\n\nHer strong impulse was to refuse. While she wore this ring the thought\nof that hateful scene and still more hateful mockery of marriage would\nbe always with her. And yet, as the words of prompt refusal were on\nher lips, a feeling, an instinct, almost a superstition caused them\nto remain unspoken. \"You are very kind,\" she said, \"but this is your\nsignet-ring--is not that what you call it? You cannot wish to give it to\na chance acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is my signet-ring, and if you will look at the crest and motto\nyou will see that they are not inappropriate. And I do wish to give it\neven 'to a chance acquaintance,' Miss Rodd, if you will allow me no more\nintimate term.\"\n\n\"I have looked at them,\" she answered, as she examined the ring\ncuriously. It was of plain and somewhat massive gold, and deeply cut\ninto the shield-faced bezel was the Outram crest, a hand holding a drawn\nsword, beneath which the motto was engraved. \"What is the last word of\nthe motto?\" she went on; \"it is so rubbed that I cannot read it--'For\nHome, Honour----'\"\n\n\"'And Heart,'\" said Leonard.\n\nJuanna blushed, though why the word \"heart\" should make her blush she\nknew not.\n\n\"Well, I will wear the ring, if you wish it, Mr. Outram, in memory\nof our adventure--that is, until you ask it back again,\" she said\nconfusedly; then added with a change of tone: \"There is one detail\nof the adventure that I hope you will not allude to more than you can\navoid, for the recollection of it is most painful to me, probably more\nso even than to you.\"\n\n\"I suppose you mean the ceremony of marriage, Miss Rodd.\"\n\n\"I mean the wicked and abominable farce in which we were made to play\na part,\" she answered passionately. \"Most of the witnesses of that\nshameful scene are dead and cannot speak of it, and if you will keep\nyour servant the dwarf silent I will do the same by Father Francisco.\nLet it be forgotten by both of us.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Miss Rodd,\" said Leonard, \"that is, if anything so strange\ncan be forgotten. And now, will you come to breakfast?\"\n\nShe bowed her head in assent and swept past him, the red lilies in her\nhand.\n\n\"I wonder what hold she has over that priest,\" thought Leonard to\nhimself, \"that she talked of being able to keep him silent. By the way,\nI must find out whether we are to have the pleasure of his company. I\nwould rather be without him myself. A strange girl! One can account for\nher beauty, she inherited that; but it is difficult to understand the\nmanner. By rights she should be a half-wild hoyden, but I never saw an\nEnglish lady with more grace and dignity. Perhaps I have forgotten;\nit is so long since I associated with ladies, or perhaps, like beauty,\nthese are natural to her. After all, her father seems to have been a\ngentleman of birth, and people who live with nature may have every\nfault in the calendar, but they cannot be vulgar. That is the gift of\ncivilisation.\"\n\nWhen he reached the camp, Leonard found the priest talking\nconfidentially to Juanna.\n\n\"By the way, Father,\" he said somewhat brusquely, \"as you see, I have\ngot rid of those slaves. It was impossible to take them with us, and now\nthey must shift for themselves: at any rate, they are better off than\nthey were yonder. What are your plans? You have behaved well to us, but\nI cannot forget that we found you in bad company. Perhaps you wish to\nreturn to it, and in that case your way lies eastward,\" and he nodded\ntowards the Nest.\n\n\"I do not wonder that you distrust me, senor,\" said Francisco, his\npale and girlish face colouring as he spoke, \"for appearances are much\nagainst me. But I assure you that although I came into the company of\nAntonio Pereira by my own will, it was for no evil purpose. To be brief,\nsenor, I had a brother who fled hither from Portugal because of a crime\nthat he had committed, and joined Pereira's band. With much toil I\ntracked him out, and was welcomed at the Nest because I am a priest\nwho can comfort the sick and shrive the dying, for wickedness does not\nconsole men at the last, senor. I persuaded my brother to return with\nme, and we made a plan to escape. But Pereira's ears were long: we were\nbetrayed, and my brother was hanged. They did not hang me, because of\nmy calling. Afterwards I was kept a prisoner and forced to accompany\nthe band in their expeditions. That is all the story. Now, with your\npermission, I will follow you, for I have no money and nowhere else to\ngo in this wilderness, though I fear that I am not strong enough to be\nof much service, and being of another faith you will scarcely need my\nministrations.\"\n\n\"Very well, Father,\" answered Leonard coldly, \"but please understand\nthat we are still surrounded by many dangers, which any treachery\nmight cause to overwhelm us. Therefore I warn you that should I detect\nanything of the sort my answer to it will be a quick one.\"\n\n\"I do not think that you need suspect the Father, Mr. Outram,\" said\nJuanna indignantly. \"I owe him a great deal: had it not been for his\nkindness and counsel, I should not be alive to-day. I am most deeply\ngrateful to him.\"\n\n\"If you vouch for him, Miss Rodd, that is enough. You have had the\nadvantage of a closer acquaintance than I can boast,\" Leonard\nanswered gravely, mentally contrasting the difference of her manner in\nacknowledging the priest's services and his own.\n\nFrom that hour till a certain conversation opened his eyes, struggle\nas he would against it, Leonard disliked Francisco. He had a foolish\nBritish aversion to his class, and Juanna's marked partiality towards\nthis particular individual did not lessen it in this instance. Prejudice\nis a strong thing, and when it is heightened by suspicion and jealousy,\nespecially jealousy of the unacknowledged kind, it becomes formidable,\nboth to him who entertains it and to him against whom it is entertained.\n\nWhen their meal was done they proceeded up the river in the boats which\nthey had captured from the slavers, each boat being rowed by the best\noarsmen among the Settlement men. Including women and children their\nparty numbered some sixty souls. At evening they passed the island where\nthey had left the company of slavers, but could see no sign of life upon\nit, and never learned whether the men perished or escaped.\n\nAn hour later they encamped upon the bank of the river, and it was while\nthey were sitting round the fire at night that Juanna told Leonard of\nthe horrors which she had undergone during her dreadful sojourn with the\nslave caravan. She told him also how she had torn leaves from the\nBible which she chanced to have with her, and fixed them upon the reeds\nwhenever she could find an opportunity of so doing, in the hope that\nthey might guide her father, should he return and attempt her rescue.\n\n\"It is all like a nightmare,\" she said; \"and as for that hideous farce\nof marriage with which it ended, I can scarcely bear to think of it.\"\n\nThen Francisco, who had been sitting silent, spoke for the first time.\n\n\"You speak, senora,\" he said in his subdued voice, \"of that 'hideous\nfarce of marriage,' and I suppose you mean the ceremony which I\nperformed between you and the Senor Outram, being forced to the act by\nPereira. It is my duty to tell you both that, however irregular this\nmarriage may have been, I do not believe it to be a farce. I believe\nthat you are lawfully man and wife until death shall part you, unless\nindeed the Pope should annul the union, as he alone can do.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, nonsense,\" broke in Leonard; \"you forget that there was\nno consent; that we are of another religion, and that the form was\nnecessary to our plot.\"\n\n\"The Church knows nothing of the reasons which lead to the undertaking\nof wedlock,\" Francisco answered mildly. \"They are various, and many of\nthem would not bear investigation. But you were married without any open\nprotest on your part, on Portuguese territory, according to Portuguese\ncustom, and by a duly qualified priest. The fact that you are of the\nProtestant religion, and were united by the Catholic ritual, does\nnot matter at all. For the purposes of the ceremony you accepted that\nritual, as is customary when a Protestant marries a Catholic. It is\ndisagreeable for me to have to tell you this, but the truth remains: I\nbelieve that you are man and wife before Heaven and the world.\"[*]\n\n     [*] The Editor does not hold himself responsible for Father\n     Francisco's views on ecclesiastical marriage law.\n\nHere Juanna jumped to her feet, and even in that light Leonard could see\nthat her breast was heaving and her eyes shone with anger.\n\n\"It is intolerable that I should be forced to listen to such\nfalsehoods,\" she said, \"and if you ever repeat them in my hearing,\nFather Francisco, I will not speak to you again. I utterly repudiate\nthis marriage. Before the ceremony began, Mr. Outram whispered to me to\ngo through with the 'farce,' and it was a farce. Had I thought otherwise\nI should have taken the poison. If there is any foundation for what the\nFather says, I have been deceived and entrapped.\"\n\n\"Pardon, senora,\" replied the priest; \"but you should not speak so\nangrily. The Senor Outram and I only did what we were forced to do.\"\n\n\"Supposing that Father Francisco is right, which I do not believe,\"\nsaid Leonard, with sarcasm, \"do you think, Miss Rodd, that such a sudden\nundertaking would be more to my liking than to yours? Believe me, had\nI wished to 'deceive and entrap' you, I could not have done so without\ninvolving myself, since, if the marriage is binding, it is binding on\nboth parties, and even such a humble individual as I am does not take\na wife on the faith of a five minutes' acquaintance. To be frank, I\nundertook your rescue for purposes far other than those of matrimony.\"\n\n\"Might I ask what they were?\" replied Juanna, in a tone of equal\nacerbity.\n\n\"Certainly, Miss Rodd. But first I must explain that I am no\nknight-errant. I am an almost penniless adventurer, and for urgent\nreasons of my own I seek to win fortune. Therefore, when the woman\nyonder,\" and he pointed to Soa, who was sitting watching them just\nout of range of the firelight, \"came to me with a marvellous tale of a\ncountless treasure of rubies, which she promised to reveal to me if I\nwould undertake the little matter of your rescue, and when she even paid\ndown a specimen stone of considerable value on account, having nothing\nbetter to do and nowhere to go, being in short desperate, I consented.\nIndeed, I did more, I took the precaution of reducing the matter to\nwriting, I being one contracting party, and Soa, acting on her own\nbehalf and as your attorney, being the other.\"\n\n\"I have not the least idea to what you allude, nor did I ever give\nSoa any authority to sign documents on my behalf. But may I see this\nwriting?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Leonard answered; and rising he went to the baggage, whence\nhe returned presently with a lantern and the prayer-book.\n\nJuanna placed the lantern beside her and opened the book. The first\nthing that she saw was a name on the fly-leaf, \"Jane Beach,\" and beneath\nit this inscription, which evidently had been written by some one in a\ngreat hurry: \"To dearest Leonard from Jane. 23 Jan.\"\n\n\"Turn over,\" he said hastily; \"the document is on the other side.\"\n\nShe was not slow to note both the writing and the confusion which her\nperusal of it caused him. Who was Jane Beach, she wondered, and why did\nshe call Mr. Outram \"dearest Leonard\"? In a moment, so strange are the\nhearts of women, Juanna felt herself much prepossessed against her,\nwhoever she might be. But she turned the leaf and read the agreement.\nIt was a pretty sight to see her bending over the cramped writing in\nthe circle of the lantern light, but when at length she had finished\nand looked up, there was a smile upon her lovely face which had more of\nscorn in it than was pleasant.\n\n\"Come hither, Soa,\" she said, \"and tell me what all this nonsense means\nabout rubies and the People of the Mist.\"\n\n\"Shepherdess,\" answered Soa, squatting down on the ground before her,\n\"it is not nonsense. The language which I taught you when you were\nlittle is that of this people. It is a true tale, though hitherto I have\nhid it from you and your father, Mavoom, lest Mavoom should seek to\nwin the precious stones and come to his death through them. Listen,\nShepherdess,\" and she repeated the outlines of the story with which she\nhad already made Leonard acquainted, ending thus:\n\n\"I told this tale to the White Man because I saw that he was greedy,\nafter the fashion of his race, and my strait was desperate. For this\nreason I bribed him with the red stone, and with the promise that I\nwould lead him to the land of the People of the Mist, for had I not done\nso he would never have used his wit or put out his strength to rescue\nyou from the Yellow Devil. Therefore it was also that I marked this\npaper on your behalf and my own, knowing well that I had no right to\nspeak for you, and that by and by you could refuse to abide by it,\nthough I am bound.\"\n\n\"Frank, at any rate,\" said Leonard to himself. \"What an attorney the old\nlady would have made!\"\n\n\"Say, Soa,\" asked Juanna, \"to succeed in the search for these stones is\nit necessary that I should act a part among your people?\"\n\n\"I can see no other way,\" she answered. \"But what of that? You are free,\nand what I promised on your behalf is nothing. Let the White Man go\nwithout his reward, it will save him a long journey.\"\n\n\"Attorney!\" murmured Leonard in admiration; \"she ought to be\nAttorney-General.\"\n\n\"_Wow!_ The wicked old cheat!\" put in Otter. \"If I had my way I would\nbreak her neck, though she is so clever with the big gun.\"\n\nJuanna took no notice of these asides. For the moment she remained in\nthought, then looked up smiling.\n\n\"Really,\" she said, \"this is a capital legal document. But oh! Mr.\nOutram, why did you dispel my illusions? You see, I had been making up\nsuch a romantic story out of this adventure. You were the knight-errant,\nand I was the Christian maiden in the hands of the ogre, and when you\nheard of it you buckled on your armour and started to the rescue. And\nnow you bring me down to the nineteenth century with a run.\n\n\"It is not knight-errantry, but a commercial transaction: I am in\ndifficulty, but by playing a certain undefined part you believe that\nI shall be able to help you to secure treasure; therefore you agree to\nundertake the risk. I am ignorant of what I am to do, for as yet\nnobody has explained it to me, but you need have no fear, I shall not\nrepudiate, as Soa suggests with so much candour. Certainly I shall try\nmy best to help you in this business, if I can, for you have worked hard\nand endangered your life, Mr. Outram, and I am sure that you have\nearned your money, or rather the prospect of it. Really it is all very\namusing,\" and she laughed merrily.\n\nAs for Leonard, he sat before her, mad with secret wrath and burning\nwith shame. What a fool he had been thus to expose himself to the shafts\nof this girl's tongue--this girl, whose beauty was only equalled by\nher malice! He wished that his hand had withered before he wrote that\naccursed document. But now the only thing to do was to face it out.\n\n\"I am glad that you see me in my true light at last, Miss Rodd,\" he\nsaid. \"It simplifies matters. I entered into that agreement because it\nseemed to give me a remote chance of attaining my end, which is money.\nIt does not quite follow, however, that I should not have attempted your\nrescue had there been no agreement; but, of course, I cannot expect you\nto believe that.\"\n\n\"I assure you, Mr. Outram, that I am deeply obliged to you for your\ncaution. It has lifted a great weight from my mind, for if in any way I\ncan help you to obtain possession of the valuables of this People of the\nMist I shall have paid off an obligation which at present crushes me.\"\n\n\"We shall have to start early to-morrow morning, so with your permission\nI think that I will be turning in,\" said Leonard, springing up with\nsingular alacrity.\n\nJuanna watched him go with innocent eyes, and as he passed she saw by\nthe firelight that his face was like a thunderstorm. \"I have made him\nangry this time,\" she thought to herself, \"and I am glad of it. What\nbusiness had he to rescue _me_ for money? But he is a strange man, and\nI don't think that I quite understand him. I wonder who Jane Beach is.\nI suppose that she wants the money. Women generally do, or at least they\ndid in Durban.\"\n\nThen she spoke aloud: \"Soa, come here while I undress, and tell me again\nall about your meeting with Mr. Outram, and what he said, forgetting\nnothing. You have put me to shame, Soa, with your talk, and I will never\nforgive you. Tell me also how I can help to win the treasure of the\nPeople of the Mist!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nMISUNDERSTANDINGS\n\nFor some days after the acrimonious conversation that has been reported,\nthe relations between Leonard and Juanna were not a little strained,\nalthough the necessities of travel brought them into continual contact.\nBoth felt that they had cause of complaint against the other, and\nboth were at heart somewhat ashamed of the part which they had played.\nLeonard regretted ever having made the agreement with Soa, and Juanna,\nnow that she had cooled down a little, regretted having spoken as she\ndid upon the subject. Her pride was offended; but, after all, how could\nhe know? Besides, he was an adventurer, and it was natural that he\nshould make terms. Doubtless also his anxiety to win fortune had to do\nwith the lady whose name was written in the prayer-book.\n\nPerhaps this lady was only a maiden aunt, but a great desire seized\nJuanna to know about her; and when such a wish enters the heart of woman\nit is probable that she will find a means to satisfy it. Having no one\nelse to ask, Juanna sounded Otter, with whom she was on friendly terms,\nonly to find that the subject of Jane Beach did not interest the dwarf.\nHe hazarded a remark, however, that doubtless she was one of the Baas's\nwives when he lived in his big kraal over the water.\n\nThis disgusted Juanna somewhat, but the allusion to a \"big kraal\"\nexcited the curiosity, of which she had a certain share, and very\nadroitly she questioned the dwarf concerning it. He rose to the fly\nwithout hesitation, and told her that his master had been one of the\ngreatest men in the world, and one of the richest, but that he lost\nhis possessions through the wicked arts of foemen, and was come to this\ncountry to seek new ones.\n\nIndeed Otter enlarged upon the theme, and, anxious to extol his beloved\nchief's worth in the eyes of the Shepherdess, it would not be too much\nto say that he drew upon his own imagination. Leonard, he declared, had\nowned country as wide as a horse could gallop across in a day; moreover,\nhe had two hundred tribesmen, heads of families, who fed upon oxen\nkilled for them--twenty oxen a week; and ten principal wives had called\nhim husband. Juanna asked for the titles of the wives, whereon the\nundefeated Otter gave them all Kaffir names, not neglecting to describe\ntheir lineage, personal charms, and the number and sex of their\nchildren. The tale took about two hours to tell, and after hearing it\nJuanna conceived a great respect for Otter, but she saw clearly that\nif she wished for reliable information she must obtain it from Leonard\nhimself.\n\nIt was not till the last day of their journey that Juanna found the\nopportunity she sought. The voyage had been most prosperous, and they\nexpected to reach the ruined Settlement on the morrow, though whether or\nnot they would find Mr. Rodd there was a matter of anxious conjecture,\nespecially to his daughter. Day after day they rowed and sailed up the\ngreat river, camping at night upon its banks, which would have been\npleasant had it not been for the mosquitoes. But all this while Leonard\nand Juanna saw little of each other, though they met often enough. On\nthis particular occasion, however, it chanced that they were journeying\nin the same boat, alone, except for the rowers.\n\nPossibly Juanna had contrived that it should be so, for as a general\nrule, in pursuit of his policy of avoiding a disagreeable young person,\nLeonard travelled with Otter in the first boat, while Juanna was\naccompanied by Francisco and Soa in the second. To the priest, indeed,\nshe made herself very agreeable, perhaps to show Leonard how charming\nshe could be when she chose. She conversed with him by the hour together\nas though he were a woman friend, and his melancholy eyes would lighten\nwith pleasure at her talk. Indeed Francisco had something of the\nfeminine in his nature; his very gentleness was womanly, and his slight\nstature, delicate hands and features heightened this impression. In face\nhe was not unlike Juanna herself, and as time went on the resemblance\nseemed to grow. Had he been arrayed in a woman's loose attire, it would\nhave been easy to mistake one for the other in the dusk, although she\nwas the taller of the two.\n\nThe accident of his profession caused Juanna to admit Francisco to an\nintimacy which she would have withheld from any other man. She forgot,\nor did not understand, that she was playing a dangerous game--that after\nall he was a man, and that the heart of a man beat beneath his cassock.\nNobody could be more charming in her manner or more subtle in her mind\nthan Juanna, yet day by day she did not hesitate to display all her\nstrength before the unfortunate young priest, which, in addition to\nher beauty, made her somewhat irresistible, at any rate on the Zambesi.\nFriendship and ignorance of the world were doubtless at the bottom of\nthis reprehensible conduct, but it is also possible that unconscious\npique had something to do with it. She was determined to show Leonard\nthat she was not always a disagreeable person whom it was well to avoid,\nor at least that others did not think so. That all these airs and graces\nmight have a tragic effect upon Francisco never occurred to her till too\nlate.\n\nWell, for once the order of things was changed; Leonard and Juanna sat\nside by side in the first boat. The evening was lovely, they glided\nslowly by the reed-fringed bank, watching the long lights play upon the\nsurface of the lonely river, listening to the whistling wings of the\ncountless wildfowl overhead, and counting the herds of various game that\nroamed upon the plains beyond.\n\nFor a while neither of them spoke much. Occasionally Juanna would\ncall her companion's attention to some water-flower or to a great fish\ndarting from the oars, and he would answer by a word or nod. His heart\nwas wroth with the girl, as Otter would have said; he wondered why\nshe had come with him--because she was tired of the priest perhaps. He\nwished her away, and yet he would have been sorry enough had she gone.\n\nFor her part Juanna desired to make him speak, and did not know how to\nbreak through his moody silence. Suddenly she leaned back in the boat\nand began to sing in a rich contralto voice that moved him. He had never\nheard her sing before, had never heard any good singing for many years\nindeed, and he was fond of singing. The song she sang was a Portuguese\nlove-song, very tender and passionate, addressed by a bereaved lover to\nhis dead mistress, and she put much expression into it. Presently she\nceased, and he noticed that her beautiful eyes were full of tears. So\nshe could feel!\n\n\"That is too sad,\" she said with a little laugh, and then burst into\na Kaffir boat-song, of which the Settlement natives, joyous in the\nprospect of once more seeing their home, took up the chorus gleefully.\nPresently she wearied of the boat-chant. \"I am tiring you,\" she said; \"I\ndare say that you do not care for singing.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, Miss Rodd, I am very fond of it. Your voice is good,\nif you will allow me to say so, and it has been trained. I do not\nquite understand how you can have had the opportunity to learn so many\nthings--music, for instance.\"\n\n\"I suppose, Mr. Outram, you think that I should be a sort of savage by\nrights; but as a matter of fact, although we have lived on the Zambesi,\nI have had some chances. There is always a certain amount of trade on\nthe river, by means of which we often obtain books and other things, and\nare brought into occasional contact with European merchants, travellers,\nand missionaries. Then my father is a gently born and well-educated man,\nthough circumstances have caused him to spend his life in these wild\nplaces. He was a scholar in his day and he has taught me a good deal,\nand I have picked up more by reading. Also, for nearly three years I was\nat a good school in Durban and did my best to improve myself there. I\ndid not wish to grow up wild because I lived among wild people.\"\n\n\"Indeed, that explains the miracle. And do you like living among\nsavages?\"\n\n\"I have liked it well enough hitherto, but this last adventure has\nsickened me. Oh! it was dreadful. Had I not been very strong I could\nnever have endured it; a nervous woman would have been driven mad.\nYes, I have liked it well enough; I have always looked upon it as a\npreparation for life. I think that the society of nature is the best\neducation for the society of man, since until you understand and are\nin sympathy with the one, you cannot really understand the other. Now I\nshould like to go to Europe and see the world and its civilisations, for\nI know from what stuff they were evolved. But perhaps I never shall; at\nany rate, I have to find my dear father first,\" and she sighed.\n\nLeonard made no answer; he was thinking.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Outram, do _you_ care for this life?\"\n\n\"I!\" he exclaimed bitterly. \"Like yourself, Miss Rodd, I am the victim\nof circumstances and must make the best of them. As I told you I am\na penniless adventurer seeking my fortune in the rough places of the\nearth. Of course I might earn a livelihood in England, but that is of no\nuse to me; I must win wealth, and a great deal of it.\"\n\n\"What is the good?\" she said. \"Is there any object in wearing out one's\nlife by trying to grow rich?\"\n\n\"That depends. I have an object, one which I have sworn to fulfil.\"\n\nShe looked at him inquiringly.\n\n\"Miss Rodd, I will tell you. My brother, who died of fever some weeks\nago, and I were the last male survivors of a very ancient house. We were\nborn to great prospects, or at least he was; but owing to the conduct of\nour father, everything was lost to us, and the old house, which had been\nours for centuries, went to the hammer. That was some seven years ago,\nwhen I was a man of three-and-twenty. We swore that we would try to\nretrieve those fortunes--not for ourselves so much, but for the sake\nof the family--and came to Africa to do it. My brother is dead, but I\ninherit the oath and continue the quest, however hopeless it may be. And\nnow, perhaps, you will understand why I signed a certain document.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I understand now. It is a strange history. But tell\nme, have you no relations left?\"\n\n\"One, I believe, if she still lives--a maiden aunt, my mother's sister.\"\n\n\"Is she Jane Beach?\" she asked quickly. \"Forgive me, but I saw that name\nin the prayer-book.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"she is not Jane Beach.\"\n\nJuanna hesitated; then curiosity and perhaps other feelings overcame\nher, and she asked straight out--\n\n\"Who is Jane Beach?\"\n\nLeonard looked at Juanna and remembered all that he had suffered at her\nhands. It was impertinent of her to ask such a question, but since she\nchose to do so she should have an answer. Doubtless she supposed that\nhe was in love with herself, doubtless her conduct was premeditated and\naimed at the repression of his hopes. He would show her that there\nwere other women in the world, and that one of them at any rate had not\nthought so poorly of him. It was foolish conduct on his part, but then\npeople suffering under unmerited snubs, neglect, and mockery at the\nhands of a lady they admire are apt to lose their judgment and do\nfoolish things. So he answered:\n\n\"Jane Beach is the lady to whom I was engaged.\"\n\n\"I guessed it,\" she replied with a smile and a shiver. \"I guessed it\nwhen I saw that you always carried the prayer-book about with you.\"\n\n\"You forget, Miss Rodd, that the prayer-book contains an agreement which\nmight become valuable.\"\n\nJuanna took no heed of his sarcasm, she was too intent on other\nthoughts.\n\n\"And are you engaged to her now?\"\n\n\"No, I suppose not. Her father broke off the match when we lost our\nfortunes.\"\n\n\"She must have been very sorry?\"\n\n\"Yes, she was very sorry.\"\n\n\"How interesting! You must not think me curious, Mr. Outram, but I have\nnever come across a love affair--that is a _white_ love affair--out of a\nnovel. Of course she often writes to you?\"\n\n\"I have never heard from her since I left England.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Surely she might have written or sent a message?\"\n\n\"I suppose that her father forbade it,\" Leonard answered; but in his\nheart he also thought that Jane might have written or sent a message,\nand could well guess why none had come.\n\n\"Ah! her father. Tell me, was she very beautiful?\"\n\n\"She was the loveliest woman that I ever saw--except one who is sitting\nat my side,\" he added to himself.\n\n\"And do you love her very much?\"\n\n\"Yes, I loved her very much.\"\n\nIf Juanna heard the change of tense she took no note of it; it was\nsuch a little thing, only one letter. And yet what a vast gulf there is\nbetween _love_ and _loved_! It is measureless. Still, most people have\ncrossed it in their lives, some of them more than once. He told her the\nexact truth, but after a woman's fashion she added to the truth. He said\nthat he had loved Jane Beach, and she did not doubt that he still loved\nher more than ever. How was she to know that the image of this faraway\nand hateful Jane was fading from his mind, to be replaced by that of a\ncertain present Juanna? She took it all for granted, and filled in the\ndetails with a liberal hand and in high colours.\n\nJuanna took it all for granted. Again she shivered, and her lips turned\ngrey with pain. She understood now that she had loved him ever since\nthe night when they first met in the slave camp. It was her love, as\nyet unrecognised, which, transforming her, had caused her to behave so\nbadly. It had been dreadful to her to think that she should be thrust\nupon this man in a mock marriage; it was worse to know that he had\nentered on her rescue not for her own sake, but in the hope of winning\nwealth. In the moment of her loss Juanna learned for the first time what\nshe had gained. She had played and lost, and she could never throw those\ndice again; it was begun and finished.\n\nSo Juanna thought and felt. A little more experience of the world might\nhave taught her differently. But she had no experience, and in such\nnovels as she had read the hero seldom varied in the pursuit of his\nfirst love, or turned to look upon _another_. Ah! if all heroes and\nheroines acted up to this golden rule, what an uncommonly dull world it\nwould be!\n\nJuanna gathered her energies, and spoke in a low steady voice. \"Mr.\nOutram,\" she said, \"I am so much obliged to you for telling me all this.\nIt interests me a great deal, and I earnestly hope that Soa's tale of\ntreasure will turn out to be true, and that you may win it by my help.\nIt will be some slight return for all that you have done for me. Yes, I\nhope that you will win it, and buy back your home, and after your years\nof toil and danger live there in honour, and happiness, and--love, as\nyou deserve to do. And now I ask you to forgive me my behaviour, my\nrudeness, and my bitter speeches. It has been shameful, I know; perhaps\nyou will make some excuse for me when you remember all that I have\ngone through. My nerves were shaken, I was not myself--I acted like a\nhalf-wild minx. There, that is all.\"\n\nAs she spoke Juanna began to draw the signet-ring from her left hand.\nBut she never completed the act. It was his gift to her, the only\noutward link between her and the man whom she had lost--why should she\npart with it? It reminded her of so much. She knew now that this\nmock marriage was in a sense a true one; that is, so far as she was\nconcerned, for from that hour she had indeed given her spirit into his\nkeeping--not herself, but her better half and her love; and those solemn\nwords over her in that dreadful place and time had consecrated the\ngift. It was nothing, it meant nothing; yet on her it should be binding,\nthough not on him. Yes, all her life she would remain as true to him in\nmind and act as though she had indeed become his wife on that night of\nfear. To do so would be her only happiness, she thought, though it is\nstrange that in her sorrow she should turn for comfort to this very\nevent, the mere mention of which had moved her to scorn and bitterness.\nBut so it was, and so let it be.\n\nLeonard saw the look upon her face; he had never seen anything quite\nlike it before. With astonishment he heard her gentle words, and\nsomething of the meaning of the look and words came home to him; at any\nrate he understood that she was suffering. She was changed in his sight,\nhe no longer felt bitter towards her. He loved her; might it not be that\nshe also loved him, and that here was the key to her strange conduct?\nOnce and for all he would settle the matter; he would tell her that Jane\nBeach had ceased to be more than a tender memory to him, and that she\nhad become all.\n\n\"Juanna,\" he said, addressing her by her Christian name for the first\ntime.\n\nBut there, as it was fated, the sentence began and ended, for at that\nmoment a canoe shot alongside of them, and Francisco's voice was heard\nhailing them through the fog.\n\n\"Peter says that you have passed the camping place, senora. He did not\nstop you because he thought that you knew it well.\"\n\n\"It was the mist, Father,\" Juanna answered with a little laugh. \"We have\nlost ourselves in a mist.\"\n\nA few minutes and they were on the bank, and Leonard's declaration\nremained unspoken. Nor did he make any attempt to renew it. It seemed to\nhim that Juanna had built a wall between them which he could not climb.\nFrom that evening forward her whole attitude towards him changed. She no\nlonger angered him by bitter words; indeed, she was gentleness itself,\nand nothing could be kindlier or more friendly and open than her manner,\nbut there it began and ended. Once or twice, indeed, he attempted some\nsmall advance, with the result that instantly she seemed to freeze--to\nbecome cold and hard as marble. He could not understand her, he feared\nher somewhat, and his pride took alarm. At the least he could keep his\nfeelings to himself, he need not expose them to be trampled upon by this\nincomprehensible girl.\n\nSo, although they were destined to live side by side for months, rarely\nout of each other's sight or thoughts, he went his way and she went\nhers. But the past and secret trouble left its mark on both. Leonard\nbecame sterner, more silent, watchful, and suspicious. Juanna grew\nsuddenly from a girl into a woman of presence and great natural dignity.\nShe did not often laugh during those months as had been her wont, she\nonly smiled, sadly enough at times. Her thoughts would not let her\nlaugh, for they were of what her life might have been had no such person\nas Jane Beach existed, and of what it must be because of Jane Beach.\nIndeed this unknown Jane took a great hold of her mind--she haunted her.\nJuanna pictured her in a dozen different shapes of beauty, endowed with\nmany varying charms, and hated each phantasm worse than the last.\n\nStill, for a while she would set it up as a rival, and try to outmatch\nits particular fancied grace or loveliness--a strange form of jealousy\nwhich at length led Otter to remark that the Shepherdess was not one\nwoman but twenty women, and, therefore, bewitched and to be avoided. But\nthese fits only took her from time to time. For the most part she moved\namong them a grave and somewhat stately young lady, careful of\nmany things, fresh and lovely to look upon, a mystery to her white\ncompanions, and to the natives little short of a goddess.\n\nBut wherever Juanna moved two shadows went with her--her secret passion\nand the variable image of that far-off English lady who had robbed her\nof its fruit.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE DEATH OF MAVOOM\n\nOne more day's journeying brought the party to the ruined Settlement,\nwhich they found in much the same condition as the Arabs had left it a\nfew weeks before. Fortunately the destruction was not nearly so great\nas it appeared. The inside of the house, indeed, was burnt out, but its\nwalls still remained intact, also many of the huts of the natives were\nstill standing.\n\nMessengers who left the canoes at dawn had spread the news of the rescue\nand return of the Shepherdess among the people of the neighbouring\nkraals, who flocked by scores to the landing-place. With these were at\nleast a hundred of Mr. Rodd's own people, who had escaped the clutches\nof the slaver-traders by hiding, absence, and various other accidents,\nand now returned to greet his daughter and their own relatives as they\nwould have greeted one risen from the grave. Indeed the welcome accorded\nto Juanna was most touching. Men, women, and children ran to her, the\nmen saluting her with guttural voices and uplifted arms, the women and\nchildren gesticulating, chattering, and kissing her dress and hand.\n\nWaving them aside impatiently, Juanna asked the men if anything had been\nseen or heard of her father. They answered, \"No.\" Some of their number\nhad started up the river to search for him on the same day when she was\ncaptured, but they had not returned, and no tidings had come from them\nor him.\n\n\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Leonard, seeing the distress and anxiety\nwritten on her face; \"doubtless he has gone further than he anticipated,\nand the men have not been able to find him.\"\n\n\"I fear that something has happened to him,\" she answered; \"he should\nhave been back by now: he promised to return within the fortnight.\"\n\nBy this time the story of the capture and destruction of the slave\ncamp was spread abroad among the people by the rescued men, and the\nexcitement rose to its height. Otter, seeing a favourable opportunity\nto trumpet his master's fame, swaggered to and fro through the crowd\nshaking a spear and chanting Leonard's praises after the Zulu fashion.\n\n\"_Wow!_\" he said, \"_wow!_ Look at him, ye people, and be astonished.\n\n\"Look at him, the White Elephant, and hear his deeds.\n\n\"In the night he fell upon them.\n\n\"He fell upon them, the armed men in a fenced place.\n\n\"He did it alone: no one helped him but a black monkey and a woman with\na shaking hand.\n\n\"He beguiled them with a tongue of honey, he smote them with a spear of\niron.\n\n\"He won the Shepherdess from the midst of them to be a wife to him.\n\n\"He satisfied the Yellow Devil, he satisfied him with gold.\n\n\"The praying man prayed over them, then strife arose.\n\n\"Their greatest warrior gave him battle, he broke him with his fist.\n\n\"Then the Monkey played his tricks, and the Shaking Hand made a great\nnoise, a noise of thunder.\n\n\"They fell dead, they fell dead in heaps.\n\n\"The fire roared behind them, in front of them the bullets hailed.\n\n\"They cried like women, but the fire stayed not; it licked up their\nstrength.\n\n\"Ashes are all that is left of them; they are dead, the armed men.\n\n\"No more shall they bring desolation; the day of slavery is gone by.\n\n\"Who did it? He did it, the terrible lion, the black-maned lion with the\nwhite face.\n\n\"He gave the slavers to the sword; he doomed their captain to death.\n\n\"He loosened the irons of the captives. Now they shall eat the bread of\nfreedom.\n\n\"Praise him, ye people, who broke the strength of the oppressor.\n\n\"Praise him, the Shepherd of the Shepherdess, who led her from the house\nof the wicked.\n\n\"Praise him, ye Children of Mavoom, in whose hands are death and life.\n\n\"No such deeds have been told of in the land. Praise him, the Deliverer,\nwho gives you back your children!\"\n\n\"Ay, praise him!\" said Juanna, who was standing by. \"Praise him,\nchildren of my father, since but for him none of us would see the light\nto-day.\"\n\nAt this juncture Leonard himself arrived upon the scene, just in time to\nhear Juanna's words. All the people of the Settlement took up the cry,\nand hundreds of other natives collected there joined in it. They rushed\ntowards him shouting: \"Praise to thee, Shepherd of the Shepherdess!\nPraise to thee, Deliverer!\"\n\nThen Leonard, in a fury, caught hold of Otter, vowing that if he dared\nto say another word he would instantly break his neck, and the tumult\nceased. But from that day forward he was known among the natives as \"The\nDeliverer,\" and by no other name.\n\nThat evening, as Leonard, Juanna, and the priest sat at meat within the\nwalls of the Settlement-house, with the plunder of the slave camp piled\nabout them, talking anxiously of the fate of Mr. Rodd and wondering if\nanything could be done to discover his whereabouts, they heard a stir\namong the natives without. At this moment Otter rushed in, crying:\n\"Mavoom has come!\"\n\nInstantly they sprang to their feet and ran outside the house, headed\nby Juanna. There, borne on the shoulders of six travel-worn men, and\nfollowed by a crowd of natives, they saw a litter, upon which lay the\nfigure of a man covered with blankets.\n\n\"Oh! he is dead!\" said Juanna, stopping suddenly, and pressing her hands\nto her heart.\n\nFor a moment Leonard thought that she was right. Before he could speak,\nhowever, they heard a feeble voice calling to the men who carried the\nlitter to be more careful in their movements, and once more Juanna\nsprang forward, crying, \"Father! Father!\"\n\nThen the bearers brought their burden into the house and set it down\nupon the floor. Leonard, looking, saw before him a tall and handsome\nman of about fifty years of age, and saw also by many unmistakable signs\nthat he was at the point of death.\n\n\"Juanna,\" gasped her father, \"is that you? Then you have escaped. Thank\nGod! Now I can die happy.\"\n\nIt would serve little purpose to set out in detail the broken\nconversation which followed, but by degrees Leonard learnt the story. It\nseemed that Mr. Rodd was disappointed in his purpose of purchasing\nthe hoard of ivory which he went out to seek, and, unwilling to return\nempty-handed, pushed on up the river with the hope of obtaining more. In\nthis he failed also, and had just begun his homeward journey when he was\nmet by the party which Soa despatched, and heard the terrible tidings\nof the abduction of his daughter by Pereira. It was nightfall when the\nmessengers arrived, and too dark to travel.\n\nFor a while Mr. Rodd sat brooding over the news of this crushing\ndisaster, perhaps the most fearful that could come to a father's ears;\nthen he did what he was but too prone to do--flew for refuge to the\nbottle.\n\nWhen he had drunk enough to destroy his judgment, he rose, and insisted\nupon continuing their march through the inky darkness of the night. In\nvain did his men remonstrate, saying that the road was rocky and full of\ndanger. He would take no denial; indeed, he vowed that if they refused\nto come he would shoot them. So they started, Mr. Rodd leading the way,\nwhile his people stumbled after him through trees and over rocks as best\nthey might.\n\nThe march was not a long one, however, for presently the men heard an\noath and a crash, and their master vanished; nor could they find him\ntill the dawn came to give them light. Then they discovered that they\nhad halted upon the edge of a small but precipitous cliff, and at the\nbottom of the donga beneath lay Mavoom--not dead, indeed, but senseless,\nand with three ribs and his right ankle broken. For some days they\nnursed him there, till at length he decided upon being carried forward\nin a litter. So notwithstanding his sufferings, which were intense, they\nbore him homewards by short stages, till ultimately they reached the\nSettlement.\n\nThat night Leonard examined Mr. Rodd's injuries, and found that they\nwere fatal; indeed, mortification had already set in about the region of\nthe broken ribs. Still he lived awhile.\n\nOn the following morning the dying man sent for Leonard. Entering\nthe room, he found him lying on the floor, his head supported in\nhis daughter's lap, while the priest Francisco prayed beside him. He\nsuffered no pain now, for when mortification begins pain passes, and his\nmind was quite clear.\n\n\"Mr. Outram,\" he said, \"I have learnt all the story of the taking of the\nslave camp and your rescue of my daughter. It was the pluckiest thing\nthat I ever heard of, and I only wish that I had been there to help in\nit.\"\n\n\"Don't speak of it!\" said Leonard. \"Perhaps you have heard also that I\ndid it for a consideration.\"\n\n\"Yes, they told me that too, and small blame to you. If only that old\nfool Soa had let me into the secret of those rubies, I would have had\na try for them years ago, as of course you will when I am gone. Well,\nI hope that you may get them. But I have no time to talk of rubies, for\ndeath has caught me at last, through my own fault as usual. If you ever\ntake a drop, Outram, be warned by me and give it up; but you don't look\nas if you did; you look as I used to, before I learnt to tackle a bottle\nof rum at a sitting.\n\n\"Now listen, comrade, I am in a hole, not about myself, for that must\nhave come sooner or later, and it does not much matter when the world\nis rid of a useless fellow like me; but about my girl here. What is to\nbecome of her? I have not got a cent; those cursed slavers have cleared\nme out, and she has no friend. How should she have, when I have been\nthirty years away from England?\n\n\"Look here, I am going to do the only thing I can do. I am going to\nleave my daughter in your charge, though it is rough on you, and as you\ndeal with her, so may Heaven deal with you! I understand that there was\nsome ceremony of marriage between you down yonder. I don't know how you\ntake that, either of you, or how far the matter will go when I am dead.\nBut if it goes any way at all, I trust to your honour, as an English\ngentleman, to repeat that ceremony the first time you come to a\ncivilised country. If you do not care for each other, however, then\nJuanna must shift, as other women have to do, poor things. She can look\nafter herself, and I suppose that her face will help her to a husband\nsome time. There is one thing: though she hasn't a pound, she is the\nbest girl that ever stepped, and of as good blood as you can be. There\nis no older family than the Rodds in Lincolnshire, and she is the last\nof them that I know of; also, her mother was well-born, although she was\na Portugee.\n\n\"And now, do you accept the trust?\"\n\n\"I would gladly,\" answered Leonard, \"but how can I? I propose to go\nafter these rubies. Would it not be better that Father Francisco here\nshould take your daughter to the coast? I have a little money which is\nat her disposal.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the dying man with energy, \"I will only trust her to you.\nIf you want to search for these rubies, and you would be a fool not to,\nshe must accompany you--that is all. I know that you will look after\nher, and if the worst comes to the worst, she has a medicine to protect\nherself with, the same that she so nearly used in the slave camp. Now,\nwhat do you say?\"\n\nLeonard thought for a moment, while the dying man watched his face\nanxiously.\n\n\"It is a heavy responsibility,\" he said, \"and the circumstances make it\nan awkward one. But I accept it. I will take care of her as though she\nwere my wife, or--my daughter.\"\n\n\"Thank you for that,\" answered Rodd. \"I believe you, and as to the\nrelationship, you will settle that for yourselves. And now good-bye. I\nlike you. I wish that we had known one another before I got into trouble\nat home, became a Zambesi trader, and--a drunkard.\"\n\nLeonard took the hand which Mr. Rodd lifted with a visible effort, and\nwhen he released it, it fell heavily, like the hand of a dead man. Then,\nas he turned to go, he glanced at Juanna's face, but could make nothing\nof it, for it was as the face of a sphinx.\n\nThere the girl sat, her back resting against the wall, her dying\nfather's head pillowed upon her knee, motionless as if carved in stone.\nShe was staring straight before her with eyes wide open and curved\nlips set apart, as though she were about to speak and suddenly had been\nstricken to silence. So still was she that Leonard could scarcely note\nany movement of her breast. Even her eyelids had ceased to quiver, and\nthe very pallor of her face seemed fixed like that of a waxen image. He\nwondered what she was thinking of; but even had she been willing to bare\nher thoughts to him, it is doubtful whether she could have made them\nintelligible. Her mind was confused, but two things struggled one\nagainst the other within it, the sense of loss and the sense of shame.\n\nThe father whom, notwithstanding his faults, she loved dearly, who\nindeed had been her companion, her teacher, her playmate and her friend,\nthe dearest she had known, lay dying before her eyes, and with his last\nbreath he consigned her to the care of the man whom she loved, and from\nwhom, as she believed, she was for ever separated. Would there, then, be\nno end to the obligations under which she laboured at the hands of this\nstranger, who had suddenly taken possession of her life? And what fate\nwas on her that she should thus be forced into false positions, whence\nthere was no escape?\n\nDid she wish to escape even? Juanna knew not; but as she sat there\nwith a sphinx-like face, trouble and doubt, and many another fear and\nfeeling, took so firm a hold of her that at length her mind, bewildered\nwith its own tumult, lost its grip of present realities, and sought\nrefuge in dreams which he could not disentangle. No wonder, then, that\nLeonard failed to guess her thoughts, as she watched him go from the\ndeath-bed.\n\nMr. Rodd died peacefully that evening, and on the following afternoon\nthey buried him, Francisco performing the service. Three more days\npassed before Leonard had any conversation with Juanna, who moved about\nthe place, pale, self-contained, and silent. Nor would he have spoken to\nher then had she not taken the initiative.\n\n\"Mr. Outram,\" she said, \"when do you propose to start upon this\njourney?\"\n\n\"Really, I do not know. I am not sure that I shall start at all. It\ndepends upon you. You see I am responsible for you now, and I can\nscarcely reconcile it with my conscience to take on you such a\nwild-goose chase.\"\n\n\"Please do not talk like that,\" she answered. \"If it will simplify\nmatters I may as well tell you at once that I have made up my mind to\ngo.\"\n\n\"You cannot unless I go too,\" he answered smiling.\n\n\"You are wrong there,\" Juanna replied defiantly. \"I can, and what is\nmore, I will, and Soa shall guide me. It is you who cannot go without\nme--that is, if Soa tells the truth.\n\n\"For good or evil we are yoked together in this matter, Mr. Outram, so\nit is useless for us to try to pull different ways. Before he died, my\ndear father told you his views plainly, and even if there were no other\nconsiderations involved, such as that of the agreement--for, whatever\nyou may think to the contrary, woman have some sense of honour, Mr.\nOutram--I would not disregard his wishes. Besides, what else are we to\ndo? We are both adventurers now, and both penniless, or pretty\nnearly so. Perhaps if we succeed in finding this treasure, and it is\nsufficiently large, you will be generous and give me a share of it, say\nfive per cent., on which to support my declining years,\" and she turned\nand left him.\n\n\"Beginning to show temper again,\" said Leonard to himself. \"I will ask\nFrancisco what he thinks of it.\"\n\nOf late, things had gone a little better between Leonard and the priest.\nNot that the former had as yet any complete confidence in the latter.\nStill, he understood now that Francisco was a man of honest mind and\ngentle instincts, and naturally in this dilemma he turned to seek for\ncounsel to his only white companion. Francisco listened to the story\nquietly; indeed, for the most part it was already known to him.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, when Leonard had finished, \"I suppose that you must go.\nThe Senora Juanna is not a young lady to change her mind when once she\nhas made it up, and if you were to refuse to start, mark my words, she\nwould make the expedition by herself, or try to do so. As to this story\nof treasure, and the possibility of winning it, I can only say that\nit seems strange enough to be true, and that the undertaking is so\nimpracticable that it will probably be successfully accomplished.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said Leonard, \"sounds a little paradoxical, but after that slave\ncamp business, like you I am inclined to believe in paradoxes. And now,\nFather, what do you propose to do?\"\n\n\"I? to accompany you, of course, if you will allow me. I am a priest and\nwill play the part of chaperon, if I can do nothing else,\" he added with\na smile.\n\nLeonard whistled and asked, \"Why on earth do you mix yourself up in such\na doubtful business? You have all your life before you; you are able,\nand may make a career for yourself in religion; there is nothing for you\nto gain by this journey; on the contrary, it may bring you death--or,\"\nhe added with meaning, \"sorrow which cannot be forgotten.\"\n\n\"My life and death are in the hand of God,\" the priest answered humbly.\n\"He appointed the beginning and He will appoint the end. As for that\nsorrow which cannot be forgotten, what if it is already with me?\" And he\ntouched his breast and looked up.\n\nThe eyes of the two men met, and they understood each other.\n\n\"Why don't you go away and try to forget her?\" said Leonard.\n\nThe speech was blunt, but Francisco did not resent it.\n\n\"I do not go,\" he answered, \"because it would be useless. So far as I am\nconcerned the mischief is done; for her there is none to fear. While I\nstay it is possible that I may be able to do her some service, feeble as\nI am. I have sinned a great sin, but she does not know, and will never\nknow it while I live, for you are a man of honour and will tell her\nnothing, and she has no eyes to see. What am I to her? I am a priest--no\nman. I am like a woman friend, and as such she is fond of me. No, I have\nsinned against Heaven, against myself, and her, and you. Alas! who could\nhelp it? She was like an angel in that Inferno, so kind, so sweet, so\nlovely, and the heart is evil.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that you sinned against me, Francisco? As to the rules\nof your Church, I have my own opinion of them. Still, there they are,\nand perhaps they prick your conscience. But what harm have you done to\nme?\"\n\n\"I told you,\" he answered, \"on the second night after the slave camp\nwas burnt, that I believed you to be man and wife. I believe it yet, and\nhave I not sinned doubly therefore in worshipping a woman who is wedded?\nStill, I pray that as you are one before Heaven and the Church, so you\nmay become one in heart and deed. And when this is so, as I think that\nit will be, cherish her, Outram, for there is no such woman in the\nworld, and for you she will turn the earth to heaven.\"\n\n\"She might turn it to the other place; such things have happened,\" said\nLeonard moodily. Then he stretched out his arm and grasped the priest's\ndelicate hand. \"You are a true gentleman,\" he added, \"and I am a fool.\nI saw something of all this and I suspected you. As for the marriage,\nthere is none, and the lady cares nothing for me; if anything, she\ndislikes me, and I do not wonder at it: most women would under the\ncircumstances. But whatever befalls, I honour you and always shall\nhonour you. I must go this journey, it is laid on me that I should, and\nshe insists upon going also, more from perversity than for any other\nreason, I fancy. So you are coming too: well, we will do our best to\nprotect her, both of us, and the future must look to itself.\"\n\n\"Thank you for your words,\" Francisco answered gently, and turned away,\nunderstanding that Leonard thought himself his companion in misfortune.\n\nWhen the Father had gone, Leonard stood for a while musing upon the\ncuriously tangled web in which he found himself involved. Here he was,\ncommitted to a strange and desperate enterprise. Nor was this all, for\nabout him were other complications, totally different from those\nwhich might be expected in connection with such a mediaeval adventure,\ncomplications which, though they are frequent enough in the civilised\nlife of men, were scarcely to be looked for in the wilds of Africa, and\namidst savages. Among his companions were his ward, who chanced also to\nbe the lady whom he loved and desired to make his wife, but who, as\nhe thought, cared nothing for him; and a priest who was enamoured\nplatonically of the same lady, and yet wished, with rare self-sacrifice,\nto bring about her union with another man. Here were materials enough\nfor a romance, leaving the journey and the fabled treasure out of it;\nonly then the scene should be laid elsewhere.\n\nLeonard laughed aloud as he thought of these things; it was so curious\nthat all this should be heaped upon him at once, so inartistic and yet\nso like life, in which the great events are frequently crowded together\nwithout sense of distance or proportion.\n\nBut even as he laughed, he remembered that this was no joking matter for\nanybody concerned, unless it were Juanna. Alas! already she was more to\nhim than any treasure, and, as he thought, less attainable. Well, there\nit was, he accepted it as it stood. She had entered into his life,\nwhether for good or for evil remained to be seen. He had no desire to\nrepeat the experiment of his youth--to wear out his heart and exhaust\nhimself in efforts to attain happiness, which might after all turn to\nwormwood on his lips. This time things should take their chance. The\nbusiness of life remained to him, and he would follow it, for that is\nthe mission of man. Its happiness must look to itself, for that is the\ngift of Heaven, after which it is useless to seek and to strive.\n\nMeantime he could find time to pity Francisco, the priest with so noble\na heart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nSOA SHOWS HER TEETH\n\nThree months had passed since that day, when Juanna declared her\nunalterable determination to accompany Leonard upon his search for the\ntreasures of the People of the Mist.\n\nIt was evening, and a party of travellers were encamped on the side of\na river that ran through a great and desolate plain. They were a small\nparty, three white people, namely, Leonard, Francisco, and Juanna,\nfifteen of the Settlement men under the leadership of Peter--that same\nheadman who had been rescued from the slave camp--the dwarf, Otter, and\nJuanna's old nurse, Soa.\n\nFor twelve weeks they had travelled almost without intermission with Soa\nfor their guide, steering continually northward and westward. First they\nfollowed the course of the river in canoes for ten days or more; then,\nleaving the main stream, they paddled for three weeks up that of a\ntributary called Mavuae, which ran for many miles along the foot of\na great range of mountains named Mang-anja. Here they made but slow\nprogress because of the frequent rapids, which necessitated the\nporterage of the canoes over broken ground, and for considerable\ndistances. At length they came to a rapid which was so long and so\ncontinuous that regretfully enough they were obliged to abandon the\ncanoes altogether and proceed on foot.\n\nThe dangers of their water journey had been many, but they were nothing\ncompared with those that now environed them, and in addition to bodily\nperils, they must face the daily and terrible fatigue of long marches\nthrough an unknown country, cumbered as they were with arms and other\nabsolutely necessary baggage. The country through which they were now\npassing was named Marengi, a land uninhabited by man, the home of herds\nof countless game.\n\nOn they went northward and upward through a measureless waste; plain\nsucceeded plain in endless monotony, distance gave place to distance,\nand ever there were more beyond.\n\nGradually the climate grew colder: they were traversing a portion of\nthe unexplored plateau that separates southern from central Africa. Its\nloneliness was awful, and the bearers began to murmur, saying that they\nhad reached the end of the world, and were walking over its edge. Indeed\nthey had only two comforts in this part of their undertaking; the land\nlay so high that none of them were stricken by fever, and they could\nnot well miss the road, which, if Soa was to be believed, ran along the\nbanks of the river that had its source in the territories of the People\nof the Mist.\n\nThe adventures that befell them were endless, but it is not proposed to\ndescribe them in detail. Once they starved for three days, being unable\nto find game. On another occasion they fell in with a tribe of bushmen\nwho harassed them with poisoned arrows, killing two of their best\nmen, and were only prevented from annihilating them through the terror\ninspired by their firearms, which they took for magical instruments.\n\nEscaping from the bushmen, they entered a forest country which teemed\nwith antelope and also with lions, that night by night they must keep\nat bay as best they could. Then came several days' march through a plain\nstrewn with sharp stones which lamed most of the party; and after this\neighty or a hundred miles of dreary rolling veldt, clothed with rank\ngrass just now brown with the winter frosts, that caught their feet at\nevery step.\n\nNow at length they halted on the boundary of the land of the People of\nthe Mist. There before them, not more than a mile away, towered a huge\ncliff or wall of rock, stretching across the plain like a giant step,\nfar as the eye could reach, and varying from seven hundred to a thousand\nfeet in height. Down the surface of this cliff the river flowed in a\nseries of beautiful cascades.\n\nBefore they had finished their evening meal of buck's flesh the moon was\nup, and by its light the three white people stared hopelessly at this\nfrowning natural fortification, wondering if they could climb it, and\nwondering also what terrors awaited them upon its further side. They\nwere silent that night, for a great weariness had overcome them, and if\nthe truth must be known, all three of them regretted that they had ever\nundertaken this mad adventure.\n\nLeonard glanced to the right, where, some fifty paces away, the\nSettlement men were crouched round the fire. They also were silent, and\nit was easy to see that the heart was out of them.\n\n\"Won't somebody say something?\" said Juanna at last with a rather\npathetic attempt at playfulness. How could she be cheerful, poor girl,\nwhen her feet were sore and her head was aching, and she wished that she\nwere dead, almost?\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Leonard, \"I will say that I admire your pluck. I should\nnot have thought it possible for any young lady to have gone through the\nlast two months, and 'come out smiling' at the end of them.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am quite happy. Don't trouble about me,\" she said, laughing as\nmerrily as though there were no such things as sore feet and headaches\nin the world.\n\n\"Are you?\" said Leonard, \"then I envy you, that is all. Here comes old\nSoa, and Otter after her. I wonder what is the matter now. Something\ndisagreeable, I suppose.\"\n\nSoa arrived and squatted down in front of them, her tall spare form\nand somewhat sullen face looking more formidable than usual in the\nmoonlight. Otter was beside her, and though he stood and she sat, their\nheads were almost on a level.\n\n\"What is it, Soa?\" said Leonard carelessly.\n\n\"Deliverer,\" she answered, for all the natives knew him now by this\nname, \"some months ago, when you were digging for gold yonder, in the\nPlace of Graves, I made a bargain with you, and we set the bargain down\non paper. In that paper I promised that if you rescued my mistress I\nwould lead you to the land were precious stones were to be won, and I\ngave you one of those stones in earnest. You saved my mistress, Mavoom\nher father died, and the time came when I must fulfil my promise. For my\nown part I would not have fulfilled it, for I only made it that promise\nhoping to deceive you. But my mistress yonder refused to listen to me.\n\n\"'No,' she said, 'that which you have sworn on my behalf and your own\nmust be carried out. If you will not carry it out, go away, Soa, for I\nhave done with you.'\n\n\"Then, Deliverer, rather than part with her whom I loved, and whom I had\nnursed from a babe, I yielded. And now you stand upon the borders of the\ncountry of my people. Say, are you minded to cross them, Deliverer?\"\n\n\"What else did I come for, Soa?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nay, I know not. You came out of the folly of your heart, to satisfy\nthe desire of your heart. Listen, that tale I told you is true, and yet\nI did not tell you all the truth. Beyond that cliff live a people of\ngreat stature, and very fierce; a people whose custom it is to offer up\nstrangers to their gods. Enter there, and they will kill you thus.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, woman?\" asked Leonard.\n\n\"I mean that if you hold your life dear, or her life,\" and she pointed\nto Juanna, \"you will turn with the first light and go back whence you\ncame. It is true that the stones are there, but death shall be the\nreward of him who strives to steal them.\"\n\n\"I must say this is cheerful,\" replied Leonard. \"What did you mean,\nthen, by all that story you told me about a plan that you had to win the\ntreasures of this people? Are you a liar, Soa?\"\n\n\"I have said that all I told you was true,\" she answered sullenly.\n\n\"Very well, then, I have come a good many hundred miles to put it to the\nproof, nor am I going to turn back now. You can leave me one and all if\nyou like, but I shall go on. I will not be made a fool of in this way.\"\n\n\"None of us have any wish to be made fools of, Mr. Outram,\" said Juanna\ngently; \"and, speaking for myself, I would far rather die at once than\nattempt a return journey just at present. So now, Soa, perhaps you will\nstop croaking and tell us definitely what we must do to conciliate\nthese charming countrymen of yours, whom we have come so far to spoil.\nRemember,\" she added with a flash of her grey eyes, \"I am not to be\nplayed with by you, Soa. In this matter the Deliverer's interests are my\ninterests, and his ends my ends. Together we stand or fall, together we\nlive or die, and that shall be an unhappy hour for you, Soa, when you\nattempt to desert or betray us.\"\n\n\"It is well, Shepherdess,\" she answered, \"your will is my will, for I\nlove you alone in the world, and all the rest I hate,\" and she glared at\nLeonard and Otter. \"You are my father, and my mother, and my child, and\nwhere you are, in death or in life, there is my home. Let us go then\namong this people of mine, there to perish miserably, so that the\nDeliverer may seek to glut himself with wealth.\n\n\"Listen; this is the law of my people, or this was their law when I left\nthem forty years ago: That every stranger who passes through their gates\nshould be offered as a sacrifice to Aca the mother if the time of his\ncoming should be in summer, and to Jal the son if the time of his coming\nbe in winter, for the Mist-dwellers do not love strangers. But there is\na prophecy among my people which tells, when many generations have gone\nby, that Aca the mother, and Jal the son, shall return to the land which\nonce they ruled, clothed in the flesh of men. And the shape of Aca shall\nbe such a shape as yours, Shepherdess, and the shape of Jal shall be as\nis the shape of this black dog of a dwarf, whom when first I saw him in\nmy folly I deemed immortal and divine. Then the mother and the son\nshall rule in the land, and its kings shall cease from kingship, and the\npriests of the Snake shall be their servants, and with them shall come\npeace and prosperity that do not pass away.\n\n\"Shepherdess, you know the tongue of the People of the Mist, for\nwhen you were little I taught it to you, because to me it is the\nmost beautiful of tongues. You know the song also, the holy Song of\nRe-arising, that shall be on the lips of Aca when she comes again,\nand which I, being the daughter of the high-priest, learned, with many\nanother secret, before I was doomed to be a bride to the Snake and fled,\nfearing my doom. Now come apart with me, Shepherdess, and you, Black\nOne, come also, that I may teach you your lesson of what you shall do\nwhen we meet the squadrons of the People of the Mist.\"\n\nJuanna rose to obey her, followed by Otter, grumbling, for he hated\nthe old woman as much as she hated him, and, moreover, he did not take\nkindly to this notion of masquerading as a god, or, indeed, to the\nprospect of a lengthened sojourn amongst his adoring, but from all\naccounts somewhat truculent, worshippers. Before they went, however,\nLeonard spoke.\n\n\"I have heard you, Soa,\" he said, \"and I do not like your words, for\nthey show me that your heart is fierce and evil. Yes, though you love\nthe Shepherdess, your heart is evil. Now hear me. Should you dare to\nplay us false, whatever may befall us, be sure of this, that moment you\ndie. Go!\"\n\n\"Spare your threats, Deliverer,\" answered Soa haughtily. \"I shall not\nbetray you, because to do so would be to betray the Shepherdess. But are\nyou then a fool that you think I should fear death at your hands, who\nto-morrow with a word could give you all to torment? Pray, Deliverer,\nthat the hour may not be near when you shall rejoice to die by the\nbullet with which you threaten me, so that you may escape worse things.\"\nAnd she turned and went.\n\n\"I am not nervous,\" said Leonard to Francisco, \"but that she-devil\nfrightens me. If it were not for Juanna, she would cause us to be\nmurdered on the first possible opportunity, and if only she can secure\nher safety, I believe that she will do it yet.\"\n\n\"And I believe that she is a witch, Outram,\" answered the priest with\nfervour, \"a servant of the Evil One, such as are written of in the\nScriptures. Last night I saw her praying to her gods; she did not know\nthat I was near, for the place was lonely, but I saw her and I never\nwish to see anything so horrible again. I will tell you why she hates us\nall so much, Outram. She is jealous, because the senora--does not hate\nus. That woman's heart is wicked, wickedness was born in her, yet, as\nnone are altogether evil, she has one virtue, her love of the senora.\nShe is husbandless and childless, for even among the black people, as I\nhave learnt from the Settlement men, all have feared her and shrunk from\nher notwithstanding her good looks. Therefore, everything that is best\nin her has gone to nourish this love for the woman whom she nursed from\na babe. It was because of her fierceness that the Senor Rodd, who is\ndead, chose her for his daughter's nurse, when he found that her heart\nwas hungry with love for the child, for he knew that she would die\nbefore she suffered harm to come to her.\"\n\n\"He showed good judgment there,\" said Leonard. \"Had it not been for Soa,\nJuanna would have been a slave-girl now, or dead.\"\n\n\"That is so, Outram, but whether we showed good judgment in trusting our\nlives to her tender mercies is quite another matter. Say, friend, do you\nthink it well to go on with this business?\"\n\n\"Oh, confound it all!\" said Leonard with irritation, \"how can we turn\nback now? Just think of the journey and how foolish we should look.\nBesides, we have none of us got anything to live upon; it took most of\nthe gold that I had to bribe Peter and his men to accompany us. I dare\nsay that we shall all be killed, that seems very probable, but for my\npart I really shan't be sorry. I am tired of life, Francisco; it is\nnothing but a struggle and a wretchedness, and I begin to feel that\npeace is all I can hope to win. I have done my best here according to my\nlights, so I don't know why I should be afraid of the future, especially\nas it has been taken out of me pretty well in the present, though of\ncourse I _am_ afraid for all that, every man is. The only thing that\ntroubles me is a doubt whether we ought to take Juanna into such a\nplace. But really I do not know but what it would be as dangerous to go\nback as to proceed: those gentlemen with the poisoned arrows may have\nrecovered from their fear of firearms by now.\"\n\n\"I wish we had nothing worse than the Hereafter to fear,\" said Francisco\nwith a sigh. \"It is the journey thither that is so terrible. As for\nour expedition, having undertaken it, I think on the whole that we had\nbetter persevere, especially as the senora wishes it, and she is very\nhard to turn. After all our lives are in the hands of the Almighty, and\ntherefore we shall be just as safe, or unsafe, among the People of the\nMist as in a European city. Those of us who are destined to live will\nlive, and those whose hour is at hand must die. And now good night, for\nI am going to sleep.\"\n\nNext morning, shortly before dawn, Leonard was awakened by a hubbub\namong the natives, and creeping out of his blankets, he found that\nsome of them, who had been to the river to draw water, had captured two\nbushmen belonging to a nomadic tribe that lived by spearing fish. These\nwretched creatures, who notwithstanding the cold only wore a piece of\nbark tied round their shoulders, were screaming with fright, and it\nwas not until they had been pacified by gifts of beads and empty brass\ncartridges that anything could be got out of them.\n\nWhen confidence had at length been restored, Otter questioned them\nclosely as to the country that lay beyond the wall of rock and the\npeople who dwelt in it, through one of the Settlement men, who spoke a\nlanguage sufficiently like their own to make himself understood. They\nreplied that they had never been in that country themselves, because\nthey dared not go there, but they had heard of it from others.\n\nThe land was very cold and foggy, they said, so foggy that sometimes\npeople could not see each other for whole days, and in it dwelt a race\nof great men covered with hair, who sacrificed strangers to a snake\nwhich they worshipped, and married all their fairest maidens to a god.\nThat was all they knew of the country and of the great men, for few who\nvisited there ever returned to tell tidings. It was certainly a haunted\nland.\n\nFinding that there was no more to be learnt from the bushmen, Leonard\nsuffered them to depart, which they did at considerable speed, and\nordered the Settlement men to make ready to march. But now a fresh\ndifficulty arose. The interpreter had repeated all the bushmen's story\nto his companions, among whom, it is needless to say, it produced no\nsmall effect. Therefore when the bearers received their orders, instead\nof striking the little tent in which Juanna slept, and preparing their\nloads as usual, after a brief consultation they advanced upon Leonard in\na body.\n\n\"What is it, Peter?\" he asked of the headman.\n\n\"This, Deliverer: we have travelled with you and the Shepherdess for\nthree full moons, enduring much hardship and passing many dangers.\nNow we learn that there lies before us a land of cold and darkness,\ninhabited by devils who worship a devil. Deliverer, we have been good\nservants to you, and we are not cowards, as you know, but it is true\nthat we fear to enter this land.\"\n\n\"What do you wish to do then, Peter?\" asked Leonard.\n\n\"We wish to return whence we came, Deliverer. Already we have nearly\nearned the money that you gave to us before we started, and we will take\nno more pay if we must win it by crossing yonder wall.\"\n\n\"The way back is far, Peter,\" answered Leonard, \"and you know its\nperils. How many, think you, will reach their homes alive if I am not\nthere to guide them? For know, Peter, I will not turn back now. Desert\nme, if you wish, all of you, and still I will enter this country alone,\nor with Otter only. Alone we took the slave camp and alone we will visit\nthe People of the Mist.\"\n\n\"Your words are true, Deliverer,\" said Peter, \"the homeward way is far\nand its perils are many; mayhap but very few of us will live to see\ntheir huts again, for this is an ill-fated journey. But if we pass\nyonder,\" and he pointed to the wall of rock, \"then we shall all of us\ncertainly die, and be offered to a devil by devils.\"\n\nLeonard pulled his beard thoughtfully and said: \"It seems there is\nnothing else to say, Peter, except good-bye.\"\n\nThe headman saluted and was turning away with an abashed countenance\nwhen Juanna stopped him. Together with Otter and the others she had been\nlistening to the colloquy in silence, and now spoke for the first time.\n\n\"Peter,\" she said gently, \"when you and your companions were in the\nhands of the Yellow Devil and about to be sold as slaves, who was it\nthat rescued you?\"\n\n\"The Deliverer, Shepherdess.\"\n\n\"Yes. And now do my ears betray me, or do I hear you say that you and\nyour brethren, who with many another were saved from shame and toil by\nthe Deliverer, are about to leave him in his hour of danger?\"\n\n\"You have heard aright, Shepherdess,\" the man answered sadly.\n\n\"It is well, Peter. Go, children of Mavoom, my father, who can desert me\nin my need. For learn, Peter, that where you fear to tread, there I,\na white woman, will pass alone with the Deliverer. Go, children of my\nfather, and may peace go with you. Yet, as you know, I, who foretold\nthe doom of the Yellow Devil, am a true prophetess, and I tell you this,\nthat but a very few of you shall live to see your kraal again, and _you_\nwill not be of their number, Peter. As for those who come home safely,\ntheir names shall be a mockery, the little children shall call them\ncoward, and traitor and jackal, and one by one they shall eat out\ntheir hearts and die, because they deserted him who saved them from the\nslave-ship and the scourge. Farewell, children of my father: may peace\ngo with you, and may his ghost not come to haunt you on your path,\" and\nwith one indignant glance she turned scornfully away.\n\n\"Brethren,\" said Peter after a moment's pause, \"is it to be borne that\nthe Shepherdess should mock us thus and tie such ropes of shame about\nour necks?\"\n\n\"No,\" they answered, \"we cannot bear it.\"\n\nThen for a while they consulted together again, and presently Peter\nstood forward and said: \"Deliverer, we will accompany you and the\nShepherdess into the country of devils, nor need you fear that we shall\ndesert or betray you. We know well that we go to our death, every one\nof us; still it is better to die than to live bearing the burden of such\nbitter words as hide within the Shepherdess's lips.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" answered Leonard. \"Get your loads and let us start.\"\n\n\"Ay! It is well indeed,\" put in Otter with a snort of indignation. \"I\ntell you this, Peter, that before you left this place the words of the\nShepherdess had come true for you and one or two others, for I should\nhave fought you till I was killed, and though I have little wisdom yet I\nknow how to fight.\"\n\nLeonard smiled at the dwarf's rage, but his heart was heavy within him.\nHe knew that these men had reason on their side, and he feared greatly\nlest their evil forebodings should come true and the lives of all of\nthem pay forfeit for his rashness.\n\nBut it was too late to turn back now: things must befall as they were\nfated.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE END OF THE JOURNEY\n\nAn hour later the party began the ascent of the wall of rock, which\nproved to be an even more difficult business than they had anticipated.\nThere was no path, for those who lived beyond this natural barrier never\ncame down it, and few of the dwellers in the plains had ever ventured\nto go up. It was possible, for Soa herself had descended here in bygone\nyears, and this was all that could be said for it.\n\nIn default of a better road they followed the course of the river,\nwhich thundered down the face of the precipice in four great waterfalls,\nconnected by as many sullen pools, whose cavities had been hollowed out\nin the course of centuries from the rock. The second of these ledges\nproved so insurmountable that at one time Leonard thought that they\nwould be obliged to abandon their attempt, and follow the foot of the\ncliff till they found some easier route. But at last Otter, who could\nclimb like a cat, succeeded in passing the most dangerous part at the\nrisk of his life, bearing a rope with him by means of which the rest\nof the party and the loads of goods were hauled up one by one. It was\nevening before the height was scaled, and they proceeded to encamp upon\nits summit, making a scanty meal of some meat which they had brought\nwith them.\n\nThat night they passed in great discomfort, for it was mid-winter and\nhere the climate proved to be very cold. Bitter winds swept across the\nvast plain before them and searched them through, all the clothing and\nblankets they had scarcely sufficing to keep them warm; indeed, the\nSettlement men and Francisco, who had been bred in a southern clime,\nsuffered severely. Nor were matters improved when, on the breaking of\nthe light, they woke from a troubled sleep to find the plain hidden in\na dense mist. However, they rose, made a fire with reeds and dead wood\nwhich they gathered on the banks of the river, and ate, waiting for the\nfog to vanish.\n\nBut it did not vanish, so about nine o'clock they continued their\njourney under Soa's guidance, following the east bank of the river\nnorthwards. The ground proved easy to travel over, for, with the\nexception of isolated water-worn boulders of granite, the plain was\nperfectly smooth and covered with turf as fine as any that grows in\nnorthern lands.\n\nAll that day they marched on, wandering like ghosts through the mist,\nand guided in their path by the murmuring sound of the river. They met\nno man, but once or twice great herds of hairy creatures thundered past\nthem. Leonard fired into one of these herds with an express rifle, for\nthey wanted meat, and a prodigious snorting and bellowing told him that\nhis shot had taken effect. Running to the spot whence the sounds came,\nhe found a huge white bull kicking in its death struggle. The animal\nwas covered with long white hair like that of the British breed of wild\ncattle, and measured at least seventeen hands in height. Round it stood\nothers snorting with fear and wonder, that, when they saw Leonard, put\ndown their heads threateningly, tearing up the turf with their great\nhorns. He shouted aloud and fired another shot, whereon they turned and\ndisappeared into the mist.\n\nThis happened towards nightfall, so they determined to camp upon the\nspot; but while they were engaged in skinning the bull an incident\noccurred that did not tend to raise their spirits. At sunset the sky\ncleared a little--at least the sinking sun showed red through the mist\nas it does in a London fog of the third density. Against this red ball\nof the sun, and some dozen yards away, suddenly there appeared the\ngigantic figure of a man, for, unless the fog deceived them, he must\nhave been between six and seven feet high and broad in proportion. Of\nhis face they could see nothing, but he was clad in goat-skins, and\narmed with a great spear and a bow slung upon his back.\n\nJuanna was the first to see and point him out to Leonard with a start of\nfear, as he stood watching them in solemn silence. Obeying the impulse\nof the moment, Leonard stepped forward towards the vision holding his\nrifle ready, but before he reached the spot where it had stood the\nfigure vanished.\n\nThen he walked back again to Juanna. \"I think we have heard so much of\ngiants that we begin to believe we see them,\" he said laughing.\n\nAs he spoke something clove the air between them and stuck in the earth\nbeyond. They went to it. It was a large arrow having a barbed point and\nflighted with red feathers.\n\n\"This is a very tangible fancy at any rate,\" Juanna answered, drawing\nthe shaft out of the ground. \"We have had a narrow escape.\"\n\nLeonard did not speak, but raising his rifle he fired it at a venture in\nthe direction whence the arrow had sped. Then he ran to put their little\nband in a position of defence, Juanna following him. But, as it chanced,\nhe might have spared himself the trouble, for nothing further happened;\nindeed, the net outward and visible result of this mysterious apparition\nwas that they spent a miserable night, waiting in the fog and wet--for\nit had come on to rain, or rather drizzle--for an enemy who, to their\nintense relief, never appeared.\n\nBut the inward and spiritual consequences were much greater, for now\nthey knew that Soa spoke truth and that the legend of the bushmen as to\n\"great men covered with hair\" was no mere savage invention.\n\nAt length the morning came. It was damp and wretched, and they were\nall half starved with cold and oppressed by fears. Indeed some of\nthe Settlement men were so terrified that they openly lamented\nhaving suffered their sense of shame and loyalty to overcome their\ndetermination to retreat. Now they could not do so, for the malcontents\namong them did not dare to retrace their steps alone; moreover, Leonard\nspoke plainly on the matter, telling them that he would drive away the\nfirst man who attempted any insubordination.\n\nSoaked through, shivering, and miserable, they pursued their march\nacross the unknown plain, Soa, who seemed to grow hourly grimmer now\nthat she was in her own country, stalking ahead of them as guide. It\nwas warmer walking than sitting still, and in one respect their lot was\nbettered, for a little wind stirring the mist from time to time revealed\ngleams of the watery sun. All that day they journeyed on, seeing no\nmore of the man who had shot the arrow, or his fellows, till at length\ndarkness drew near again.\n\nThen they halted, and Leonard and Otter walked to and fro searching\nfor a suitable place to make the camp and pitch their solitary tent.\nPresently Otter shouted aloud. Leonard ran towards him, and found him\nstaring into the mist at something that loomed largely about a hundred\nyards away.\n\n\"Look, Baas,\" he said, \"there is a house, a house of stone with grass\ngrowing on the roof.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Leonard, \"it must be some more boulders. However, we\ncan soon find out.\"\n\nThey crept cautiously towards the object, that, as soon became evident,\nwas a house or a very good apology for one, built of huge undressed\nboulders, bedded in turf by way of mortar, and roofed with the trunks\nof small trees and a thick thatch of sods whereon the grass grew green.\nThis building may have measured forty feet in length by twenty in depth,\nand seventeen from the ground-line to the wall-plate. Also it had\na doorway of remarkable height and two window-places, but all these\nopenings were unclosed, except by curtains of hide which hung before\nthem. Leonard called Soa and asked her what the place was.\n\n\"Doubtless the house of a herdsman,\" she answered, \"who is set here to\nwatch the cattle of the king, or of the priests. It may chance that this\nis the dwelling of that man who shot the arrow yesterday.\"\n\nHaving assured themselves that here was a human habitation, it remained\nto be ascertained whether it was tenanted. After waiting awhile to see\nif anyone passed in or out, Otter undertook this task. Going down on his\nhands and knees he crept up to the wall, then along it to the doorway,\nand after listening there awhile he lifted a corner of the hide curtain\nand peeped into the interior. Presently he rose, saying:\n\n\"All right, Baas, the place is empty.\"\n\nThen they both entered and examined the dwelling with curiosity. It\nwas rude enough. The walls were unplastered, and the damp streamed down\nthem; the floor was of trodden mud, and a hole in the roof served as\na chimney; but, by way of compensation, the internal space was divided\ninto two apartments, one of them a living room, and the other a sleeping\nchamber. It was evident that the place had not been long deserted, for\nfire still smouldered on the hearth, round which stood various earthen\ncooking dishes, and in the sleeping-room was a rough bedstead of wood\nwhereon lay wrappings made from the hides of cattle and goats. When\nthey had seen everything there was to be seen, they hurried back to the\nothers to report their discovery, and just then the rain set in more\nheavily than before.\n\n\"A house!\" said Juanna; \"then for goodness' sake let us get into it. We\nare all half dead with the cold and wet.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Leonard, \"I think we had better take possession, though\nit may be a little awkward if the rightful owners come back.\"\n\nThe best that can be said for the night which they spent in this stone\nshanty, undisturbed by any visit from its lawful tenant, is that it\npassed a shade more comfortably than it would have done outside. They\nwere dry, though the place was damp, and they had a fire. Still, until\nyou are used to it, it is trying to sit in the company of a score of\nblack people and of many thousand fleas, enveloped with a cloud of\npungent smoke, according to the custom of our Norse ancestors.\n\nSoon Juanna gave up the attempt and retired to the great bed in the\ninner chamber, wondering much who had occupied it last. A herdsman,\nshe judged, as Soa had suggested, for in a corner of the room stood an\nox-goad hugely fashioned. But it was a bed, and she slept as soundly in\nit as its numerous insect occupants would allow. The others were not so\nfortunate: they had the insects indeed, but no bed.\n\nAgain the morning came, wet, miserable, and misty, and through the mist\nand rain they pursued their course, whither they knew not. All day they\nwandered on by the banks of the river till night fell and they\ncamped, this time without shelter. Now they had reached the extreme of\nwretchedness, for they had little or no food left, and could not find\nfuel to make a fire. Leonard took Soa aside and questioned her, for he\nsaw clearly that a couple more days of this suffering would put an end\nto all of them.\n\n\"You say these people of yours have a city, Soa?\"\n\n\"They have a city, Deliverer,\" she answered, \"but whether they will\nallow you to enter it, except as a victim for sacrifice, is another\nmatter.\"\n\n\"None of us will enter it unless we find shelter soon,\" he answered.\n\"How far is the place away?\"\n\n\"It should be a day's journey, Deliverer. Were the mist gone you could\nsee it now. The city is built at the foot of great mountains, there are\nnone higher, but the fog hides everything. To-morrow, if it lifts, you\nwill see that I speak truth.\"\n\n\"Are there any houses near where we can shelter?\" he asked again.\n\n\"How can I tell?\" she answered. \"It is forty years since I passed\nthis road, and here, where the land is barren, none dwell except the\nherdsmen. Perhaps there is a house at hand, or perhaps there is none for\nmany miles. Who can say?\"\n\nFinding that Soa could give no further information, Leonard returned to\nthe others, and they huddled themselves together for warmth on the\nwet ground as best they might, and sat out the hours in silence, not\nattempting to sleep. The Settlement men were numb with cold, and Juanna\nalso was overcome for the first time, though she tried hard to be\ncheerful. Francisco and Leonard heaped their own blankets on her,\npretending that they had found spare ones, but the wraps were wringing\nwet, and gave her little comfort. Soa alone did not appear to suffer,\nperhaps because it was her native climate, and Otter kept his spirits,\nwhich neither heat, nor cold, nor hunger seemed to affect.\n\n\"While my heart is warm I am warm,\" he said cheerfully, when Leonard\nasked him how he fared. As for Leonard himself, he sat silent listening\nto the moans of the Settlement men, and reflecting that twenty-four\nhours more of this misery would bring the troubles of most of them to an\nend. Without food or shelter it was very certain that few of those alive\nto-night would live to see a second dawn.\n\nAt last the light came and to their wonder and exceeding joy they found\nthat the rain had ceased and the mist was melting.\n\nOnce more they beheld the face of the sun, and rejoiced in its warmth\nas only those can rejoice who for days and nights have lived in\nsemi-darkness, wet to the skin and frozen to the marrow.\n\nThe worst of the mist was gone indeed, but it was not until they had\nbreakfasted off a buck which Otter shot in the reeds by the river, that\nthe lingering veils of vapour withdrew themselves from the more distant\nlandscape. At last they had vanished, and for the first time the\nwanderers saw the land through which they were travelling. They stood\nupon a vast plain that sloped upwards gradually till it ended at the\nfoot of a mighty range of snow-capped mountains named, as they learned\nin after-days, the Bina Mountains.\n\nThis range was shaped like a half-moon, or a bent bow, and the nearest\npoint of the curve, formed by a soaring snowy peak, was exactly opposite\nto them, and to all appearance not more than five-and-twenty miles away.\nOn either side of this peak the unbroken line of mountains receded with\na vast and majestic sweep till the eye could follow them no more. The\nplain about them was barren and everywhere strewn with granite boulders,\nbetween which wandered herds of wild cattle, mixed with groups of\nantelopes; but the lower slopes of the mountains were clothed with dense\njuniper forests, and among them were clearings, presumably of cultivated\nland. Otter searched the scene with his eyes, that were as those of a\nhawk; then said quietly:\n\n\"Look yonder, Baas; the old hag has not lied to us. There is the city of\nthe People of the Mist.\"\n\nFollowing the line of the dwarf's outstretched hand, Leonard saw what\nhad at first escaped him, that standing back in a wide bend at the foot\nof the great mountain in front of them were a multitude of houses, built\nof grey stone and roofed with green turf. Indeed, had not his attention\nbeen called to it, the town might well have missed observation until\nhe was quite close to its walls, for the materials of which it was\nconstructed resembled those of the boulders that lay about them in\nthousands, and the vivid green of its roofs gave it the appearance of a\ndistant space of grassy land.\n\n\"Yes, there is the kraal of the Great People,\" said Otter again, \"and\nit is a strong kraal. See, Baas, they know how to defend themselves. The\nmountain is behind them that none can climb, and all around their walls\nthe river runs, joining itself together again on the plain beyond. It\nwould go ill with the 'impi' which tried to take that kraal.\"\n\nFor a while they all stood still and stared amazed. It seemed strange\nthat they should have reached this fabled city; and now that they\nwere there, how would they be received within its walls? This was the\nquestion which each one of them was asking of himself. There was but one\nway to find out--they must go and see; no retreat was now possible.\nEven the Settlement people felt this. \"Better to die at the hands of\nthe Great Men,\" said one of them aloud, \"than to perish miserably in the\nmist and cold.\"\n\n\"Be of good cheer,\" Leonard answered; \"you are not yet dead. The sun\nshines once more. It is a happy omen.\"\n\nWhen they had rested and dried their clothes they marched on with\na certain sense of relief. There before them was the goal they had\ntravelled so far to win; soon they would know the worst that could\nbefall, and anything was better than this long suspense.\n\nBy midday they had covered about fifteen miles of ground, and could now\nsee the city clearly. It was a great town, surrounded by a Cyclopean\nwall of boulders, about which the river ran on every side, forming a\nnatural moat. The buildings within the wall seemed to be arranged in\nstreets, and to be build on a plan similar to that of the house in\nwhich they had slept two nights before, the vast conglomeration of\ngrass-covered roofs giving the city the appearance of a broken field of\nturf hillocks supported upon walls of stone.\n\nFor the rest the place was laid out upon a slope, and at its head,\nimmediately beneath the sheer steps of the mountain side stood two\nedifices very much larger in size than any of those below. One of these\nresembled the other houses in construction, and was surrounded by a\nseparate enclosure; but the second, which was placed on higher ground,\nso far as they could judge at that distance, was roofless, and had all\nthe characteristics of a Roman amphitheatre. At the far end of this\namphitheatre stood a huge mass of polished rock, bearing a grotesque\nresemblance to the figure of a man.\n\n\"What are those buildings, Soa?\" asked Leonard.\n\n\"The lower one is the house of the king, White Man, and that above is\nthe Temple of Deep Waters, where the river rises from the bowels of the\nmountain.\"\n\n\"And what is the black stone beyond the temple?\"\n\n\"That, White Man, is the statue of the god who sits there for ever,\nwatching over the city of his people.\"\n\n\"He must be a great god,\" said Leonard, alluding to the size of the\nstatue.\n\n\"He _is_ great,\" she answered, \"and my heart is afraid at the sight of\nhim.\"\n\nAfter resting for two hours they marched on again, and soon it became\napparent that their movements were watched. The roadway which they were\nfollowing--if a track beaten flat by the feet of men and cattle could be\ncalled a road--wound to and fro between boulders of rock, and here and\nthere standing upon the boulders were men clad in goat-skins, each of\nthem carrying a spear, a bow and a horn. So soon as their party came\nwithin five or six hundred yards of one of these men, he would shoot\nan arrow in their direction, which, when picked up, proved to be barbed\nwith iron, and flighted with red feathers like the first that they had\nseen. Then the sentry would blow his horn, either as a signal or in\ntoken of defiance, bound from the rock, and vanish. This did not look\nencouraging, but there was worse to come. Presently, as they drew near\nto the city, they descried large bodies of armed men crossing the river\nthat surrounded it in boats and on rafts, and mustering on the hither\nside. At length all of them were across, and the regiment, which\nappeared to number more than a thousand men, formed up in a hollow\nsquare and advanced upon them at the double.\n\nThe crisis was at hand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE COMING OF ACA\n\nLeonard turned and looked at his companions with something like dismay\nwritten on his face.\n\n\"What is to be done now?\" he said.\n\n\"We must wait for them until they come near,\" answered Juanna, \"then\nOtter and I are to meet them alone, and I will sing the song which\nSoa has taught me. Do not be afraid, I have learned my lesson, and, if\nthings go right, they will think that we are their lost gods; or, at\nleast, so Soa says.\"\n\n\"Yes, _if_ things go right. But if they don't?\"\n\n\"Then good-bye,\" answered Juanna, with a shrug of her shoulders. \"At any\nrate, I must get ready for the experiment. Come, Soa, bring the bundle\nto those rocks over there--quick! Stop a minute--I forgot, Mr. Outram,\nyou must lend me that ruby. I have to make use of it.\"\n\nLeonard handed over the ruby, reflecting that he would probably never\nsee it again, since it seemed almost certain that one of the Great\nPeople would steal it. However, at the moment he was thinking of that\nwhich was far above rubies, namely, of what chance they had of escaping\nwith their lives.\n\nSo soon as she had possession of the stone, Juanna ran to a little ring\nof boulders that were scattered on the plain about fifty paces from\nthem, followed by Soa, who carried a bundle in her hand.\n\nTen minutes passed, and Soa appeared from behind the shelter of the\nstones and beckoned to them. Advancing in obedience to her summons,\nthey saw a curious sight. Standing in the ring of rocks was Juanna,\nbut Juanna transformed. She wore a white robe cut low upon the neck and\nshoulders; indeed, it was the Arab dress in which she had escaped from\nthe slave camp, that Soa had brought with them in preparation for this\nmoment of trial. Nor was this all; for Juanna had loosened her dark\nhair--which was of great length and unusual beauty--so that it hung\nabout her almost to her knees, and upon her forehead, gleaming like a\nred eye, was set the great ruby, ingeniously fastened thereto by Soa in\na band of linen pierced in its centre to the size of the stone.\n\n\"Behold the goddess and do homage,\" said Juanna with mock solemnity,\nalthough Leonard could see that she was trembling with excitement.\n\n\"I do not quite understand what you are going to do, but you look the\npart well,\" he answered shortly. And, indeed, until that moment he had\nnever known how beautiful she was.\n\nJuanna blushed a little at the evident admiration in his eyes; then,\nturning to the dwarf, she said:\n\n\"Now, Otter, you must make ready too. And remember what Soa told you.\nWhatever you see or hear, you are not to open your mouth. Walk side by\nside with me and do as I do, that is all.\"\n\nOtter grunted in assent, and proceeded to \"make ready.\" The process was\nsimple, consisting only in the shedding of his coat and trousers--an old\npair of Leonard's, very much cut down--which left him naked, except for\na _moocha_ that he wore beneath them in accordance with native custom.\n\n\"What does all this mean?\" asked the headman Peter, who, like his\ncompanions, was trembling with fear.\n\n\"It means,\" said Juanna, \"that Otter and I are impersonating the gods of\nthis people, Peter. If they receive us as gods, it is well; if not, we\nare doomed. Be careful, should we be so received, lest any of you betray\nthe trick. Be wise and silent, I say, and do what we shall tell you from\ntime to time, if you would live to look upon the sun.\"\n\nPeter fell back astonished, while Leonard and Francisco turned their\nattention to the approaching soldiers of the People of the Mist.\n\nThey advanced slowly and in silence, but their measured tread shook\nthe earth. At last they halted about a hundred and fifty yards away,\npresenting a truly terrifying spectacle to the little band among the\nrocks. So far as Leonard could see, there was not a man among them\nwho stood less than six feet in height, and they were broad in\nproportion--hugely made. In appearance they were neither handsome nor\nrepulsive, but solemn-looking, large-eyed, thick-haired--between black\nand yellow in hue--and wearing an expression of dreadful calm, like\nthe calm of an archaic statue. For the rest they seemed to be well\ndisciplined, each company being under the command of a captain, who,\nin addition to his arms, carried a trumpet fashioned from a wild bull's\nhorn.\n\nThe regiment stood silent, gazing at the group of strangers, or, rather,\nat the boulders behind which they were concealed. In the centre of their\nhollow square was a knot of men, one of them young, and huge even in\ncomparison with his companions. This man Leonard took to be a chief or\nking. Behind were orderlies and counsellors, and before him three aged\npersons of stately appearance and a cruel cast of countenance. These men\nwere naked to the waist and unarmed, except for a knife or hanger fixed\nat the girdle. On their broad breasts, covering more than half the\nskin-surface, the head of a huge snake was tattooed in vivid blue.\nEvidently they were medicine-men or priests.\n\nWhile the adventurers watched and wondered, the king or chief issued an\norder to his attendants, who ran to the corners of the square and called\nit aloud. Then he raised his great spear, and every captain blew upon\nhis horn, making a deafening sound.\n\nNow the enemy stood still for a while, staring towards the stones,\nand the three medicine-men drew near to the chief in the centre of the\nsquare and talked with him, as though debating what should be done.\n\n\"This is our chance,\" said Juanna excitedly. \"If once they attack us it\nwill be all over; a single volley of arrows would kill every one of us.\nCome, Otter.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said Leonard. \"I am afraid of your venturing yourself among\nthose savages. The danger is too great.\"\n\n\"Danger! Can the danger be more than it is here? In a minute we may all\nbe dead. Nonsense! I _will_ go! I know what to do and have made up my\nmind to it. Do not fear for me. Remember that, if the worst comes to the\nworst, I have the means to protect myself. You are not afraid to come,\nare you, Otter?\"\n\n\"No, Shepherdess,\" said the dwarf. \"Here all roads are alike.\"\n\nLeonard thought awhile. Bitterly did he reproach himself in that he had\nbeen the cause of leading his ward into such a position. But now\nthere was no help for it--she must go. And after all it could make no\ndifference if she were killed or captured five minutes hence or half an\nhour later. But Francisco, who could not take such a philosophical view\nof the situation, implored her not to venture herself alone among those\nhorrible savages.\n\n\"Go if you like, Juanna,\" said Leonard, not heeding the priest's\nimportunities. \"If anything happens I will try to avenge you before I\nfollow. Go, but forgive me.\"\n\n\"What have I to forgive?\" she said, looking at him with shining eyes.\n\"Did you not once dare a greater danger for me?\"\n\n\"Yes, go, Shepherdess,\" said Soa, who till now had been staring with all\nher eyes at the three aged men in the centre of the square; \"there is\nlittle to fear, if this fool of a dwarf will but keep his tongue silent.\nI know my people, and I tell you that if you sing that song, and say\nthe words which I have taught you, you and the black one here shall be\nproclaimed gods of the land. But be swift, for the soldiers are about to\nshoot.\"\n\nAs Soa spoke, Leonard saw that the conference in the square had come to\nan end. The messengers were calling commands to the captains, which the\ncaptains repeated to the soldiers, and then followed a mighty rattling\nof quivers. Another instant and the light shone upon many hundreds of\narrow-heads, every one of which was pointed towards them.\n\nJuanna saw also, and springing forward on to a rock, stood there for a\nmoment in the full glare of the sun. Instantly a murmur went up from the\nhost; a great voice called a command; the barbs of steel flickered like\ninnumerable stars, and sank downwards.\n\nNow Otter, naked except for his _moocha_, sprang on to the rock by\nJuanna's side, and the murmur of the soldiers of the Great People grew\ninto a hoarse roar of astonishment and dismay. Wonder had turned to\nfear, though why this multitude of warriors should fear a lovely white\ngirl and a black dwarf was not apparent.\n\nFor a moment the ill-assorted pair stood together on the rock; then\nJuanna leapt to the plain, Otter following her. For twenty yards or so\nshe walked in silence, holding the dwarf by the hand; then suddenly she\nburst into singing wild and sweet. This was the refrain of the sacred\nsong which she sang in the ancient language of the People of the Mist,\nthe tongue that Soa had taught her as a child:\n\n     \"I do but sleep.\n     Have ye wept for me awhile?\n     Hush! I did but sleep.\n     I shall awake, my people!\n     I am not dead, nor can I ever die.\n     See, I have but slept!\n     See, I come again, made beautiful!\n     Have ye not seen me in the faces of the children?\n     Have ye not heard me in the voices of the children?\n     Look on me now, the sleeper arisen;\n     Look on me, who wandered, whose name is the Dawning!\n     Why have ye mourned me, the sleeper awakened?\"\n\nThus she sang, ever more sweetly and louder, till her voice rang\nthrough the still air like the song of a bird in winter. Hushed were the\ncompanies of the Great Men as she drew towards them with slow gliding\nsteps--hushed with fear and wonder, as though her presence awoke a\nmemory or fulfilled a promise.\n\nNow she was in front of their foremost rank, and, halting there, was\nsilent for a moment. Then she changed her song.\n\n     \"Will ye not greet me, children of my children?\n     Have ye forgotten the promise of the dead?\n     Shall I return to the dream-land whence I wander?\n     Will ye refuse me, the Mother of the Snake?\"\n\nThe soldiers looked upon one another and murmured each to each. Now she\nsaw that they understood her words and were terror-stricken by them.\nFor another moment there was silence, then suddenly the three priests or\nmedicine-men, who had drawn near together, passed through the ranks and\nstood before her, accompanied by the warrior-chief.\n\nThen one of them, the most aged, a man who must have numbered ninety\nyears, spoke in the midst of an intense silence. To Juanna's joy, as\nthey had understood her, so she understood him, for his language was the\nsame that Soa taught her many years before, and in which, for the sake\nof practice, they had always conversed together for the last two months.\n\n\"Art thou woman, or spirit?\" asked the ancient priest.\n\n\"I am both woman and spirit,\" she answered.\n\n\"And he with thee, he whom we know of\"--went on the priest, pointing\ntremblingly to Otter--\"is he god or man?\"\n\n\"He is both god and man,\" she answered.\n\n\"And those yonder; who are they?\"\n\n\"They are our ministers and servants, white for the white, and black for\nthe black, the companions of our wanderings, men and not spirits.\"\n\nThe three priests consulted together, while the chief looked on Juanna's\nbeauty with wondering eyes. Then the oldest of them spoke again:\n\n\"Thou tellest us in our own tongue of things that have long been hidden,\nthough perchance they are remembered. Either, O Beautiful, thou hast\nlearned these things and liest to us, and then food are ye all for the\nSnake against whom thou dost blaspheme, or ye are gods indeed, and\nas gods ye shall be worshipped. Tell us now thy name, and the name of\nyonder dwarf, of whom we know.\"\n\n\"I am named the Shepherdess of Heaven among men. He is named Otter,\nDweller in the Waters, among men. Once we had other names.\"\n\n\"Tell us the other names, O Shepherdess.\"\n\n\"Once in the far past I was named Brightness, I was named Dawn, I was\nnamed Daylight. Once in the far past he was named Silence, he was named\nTerror, he was named Darkness. Yet at the beginning we had other names.\nPerchance ye know them, Ministers of the Snake.\"\n\n\"Perchance we know them, O thou who art named Shepherdess of Heaven, O\nthou who wert named Brightness, and Dawn, and Daylight; O thou who art\nnamed Dweller in the Waters, and wert named Silence, and Terror, and\nDarkness! Perchance we know them, although they be known to few, and are\nnever spoken, save in utter gloom and with hidden head. But do ye\nknow them, those names of the beginning? For if ye know them not, O\nBeautiful, ye lie and ye blaspheme, and ye are food for the Snake.\"\n\n\"Seldom through all the years have those holy names been spoken save in\nutter darkness and with covered heads,\" Juanna answered boldly; \"but now\nis the new hour, the hour of the coming, and now they shall be called\naloud in the light of day from open lips and with uplifted eyes.\nHearken, Children of the Snake, these are the names by which we were\nknown in the beginning: _Aca_ is my name, the Mother of the Snake. _Jal_\nis he named, who is the Snake. Say, do ye know us now?\"\n\nAs these words rang on her lips a groan of terror burst from every man\nwho heard them. Then the aged priest cried aloud: \"Down upon your faces,\nye Children of the Snake; Worship, all ye People of the Spear, Dwellers\nin the Mist! Aca, the Queen immortal, has come home again: Jal, the god,\nhas put on the flesh of men. Olfan, lay down thy kingship, it is his: ye\npriests, throw wide the temples, they are theirs. Worship the Mother, do\nhonour to the god!\"\n\nThe multitude heard and prostrated themselves like a single man, every\none of them crying in a shout of thunder:\n\n\"Aca, the Queen of life, has come; Jal, the doom-god, has put on flesh.\nWorship the Mother, do honour to the god!\"\n\nIt was as though the army had suddenly been smitten with death, and of\nthe hundreds there, Juanna and Otter alone were left standing. There\nwas one exception, however, and that was Olfan, the warrior chief, who\nremained upon his feet, not seeming to relish the command to abdicate\nhis authority thus brusquely in favour of a dwarf, were he god or man.\n\nOtter, who was utterly bewildered, not comprehending a word of what\nhad been said, and being unable to fathom the meaning of these strange\nantics, pointed at the chief with his spear by way of calling Juanna's\nattention to the fact that he was still standing. But the great man\ninterpreted the action otherwise; evidently he thought that the newly\narrived god was invoking destruction on him. His pride yielded to his\nsuperstition, and he sank to his knees also.\n\nWhen the sound of the worshipping had passed away Juanna spoke again,\naddressing the old priest.\n\n\"Rise, my child,\" she said--he might well have been her\ngreat-grandfather--\"and rise all ye, soldiers of the Spear and servants\nof the Snake, and hear my words. Ye know me now, ye know me by the holy\nname, ye know me by the fashion of my face, and by the red stone that\ngleams upon my brow. In the beginning my blood fell yonder and was\nfrozen into such gems as these, which to-day ye offer yearly to him who\nis my child, and slew me. Now the fate is accomplished and his reign is\nfinished. I come with him indeed, and he is still a god, but he loves me\nas a son again, and bows the knee to me in service.\n\n\"Enough, ye know the ancient tale that is fulfilled this day. Now\nwe pass on towards our city, there to sojourn with you awhile and to\nproclaim the law of the Ending, and we pass alone. There, in our city,\nlet a place be made ready for us, a place apart, but nigh to the temple;\nand let food be brought to the place, that my servants may eat. At the\ngates of the city also let men be waiting to bear us to that dwelling.\nLet none spy upon us, lest an evil fate attend you all; and let none be\ndisobedient, lest we pass from you back to the land of Death and Dreams.\nPerchance we shall not tarry here for long, perchance we come to bring a\nblessing and to depart again. Therefore hasten to do our bidding, and do\nit all. For this time farewell, my servants.\"\n\nHaving spoken thus with much dignity, accompanied by Otter, whose hand\nshe held as before, Juanna withdrew herself, stepping backwards very\nslowly towards the circle of rocks, and singing as she went.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE FOLLY OF OTTER\n\nJuanna and Otter gained the circle of rocks where the little band lay\nwatching and wonder-struck; that is, all except Soa, who sat apart\nbrooding, her arms clasped upon her breast. Things had befallen as\nshe expected, as they must befall indeed, provided that Juanna did not\nforget her lesson or show fear, and that the dwarf did nothing foolish.\nBut Soa knew well enough that this was but the beginning of the\nstruggle, and that, though it might be comparatively easy for Juanna\nand Otter to enter the city, and impose themselves upon its\nsuperstition-haunted people as the incarnations of their fabled gods,\nthe maintenance of the imposture was a very different matter. Moreover,\nshe knew, should they be discovered, that escape would be impossible, or\nat the best, that it must be most difficult. Therefore she sat apart and\nbrooded, for, notwithstanding their present triumph, her heart foreboded\nevil.\n\nBut with the others it was different: they had heard the singing, they\nhad seen the regiment of great men prostrate themselves, and the sound\nof worshipping had come to their ears like thunder; but of the why and\nwherefore of it all they could only guess.\n\n\"What has happened?\" said Leonard eagerly; \"your initiation seems to\nhave come off well.\"\n\n\"Bid the men fall back and I will tell you,\" Juanna answered.\n\nLeonard did so, but instead of speaking she broke into hysterical\nlaughter. Her nerves had been over-strained, and now they sought relief\nthus.\n\n\"You must all be very respectful to Otter and myself,\" she said at\nlength, \"for we really are gods--don't look shocked, Francisco, I begin\nto believe in it myself. We have only just found it out, but I assure\nyou it is a fact; they accepted us fully, and that after not more than\nfive minutes' cross-examination. Listen!\" And she told them all that had\npassed.\n\nWhile she was speaking the regiment began to move, no longer in a\nsquare, but in a formation of companies. Company by company it rushed\npast them, shaking the earth with its footsteps, and as each section\nwent by it tossed its spears into the air as a salute, crying: \"Glory to\nthe Mother! glory to the Snake!\" and fled on towards the city.\n\nAt length the story was done and the regiment was gone.\n\n\"Well,\" said Leonard, \"so far so good. Juanna, you are the bravest and\ncleverest girl in the whole world. Most young women would have forgotten\neverything and gone into hysterics at the critical point.\"\n\n\"I kept them till afterwards,\" she answered demurely. \"And as for being\nbrave and clever, I only repeated what Soa taught me like a parrot;\nyou see I knew that I should be killed if I made any mistake, and such\nknowledge sharpens the memory. All I have to say is, if the Snake they\ntalk so much about is anything like those which are tattooed upon the\nold priests' breasts, I have no wish to make a nearer acquaintance with\nit. I hate snakes. There, don't say any more\"--for both Leonard and\nFrancisco were breaking out into fresh protestations of gratitude and\nadmiration; \"if you want to thank anybody, thank Soa!\"\n\n\"And so I do,\" said Leonard heartily, for his spirits had risen in a\nmost wonderful manner. \"Soa, you have told us the truth, and you have\nmanaged well and I thank you.\"\n\n\"Did you then take me for a liar?\" the woman answered, fixing her gloomy\neyes upon Leonard's face. \"I told you the truth, Deliverer, when I said\nthat my people would accept the Shepherdess and this black dog of yours\nas their gods. But did I not tell you also that the death of the rest of\nus lies in the matter? If not, I say so now. _You_ have not been named a\ngod, Deliverer, nor has yonder Bald-pate\"--the natives called Francisco\nthus because of his tonsure--\"and your black dog will betray you by his\nyapping. When you look down the jaws of the Snake, remember then that\nSoa told you the truth, Deliverer. Perchance you shall find the red\nstones you seek hidden in his belly, White Man.\"\n\n\"Be silent,\" said Juanna indignantly, and Soa slunk back like a whipped\nhound.\n\n\"Confound the old woman!\" put in Leonard with a shiver. \"She is a black\nJonah, and if I have to go inside this snake I hope that it will be a\ncase of ladies first, that is all.\"\n\n\"I am sure I don't know what has happened to Soa,\" said Juanna. \"Her\nnative air has a very bad effect upon her temper.\"\n\n\"Well, the future must look after itself,\" answered Leonard, \"snake or\nno snake. At present we must follow our luck. Otter, listen to me. Do\nyou understand that you are a god, the god of this people?\"\n\n\"The god, Baas? What is a god?\"\n\n\"Have I not told you, thickhead? You are not a man any more, you are a\nspirit. Once, so it seems, you ruled this people in the past, and now\nyou will rule them again. You and the Shepherdess are both gods. She is\nyour mother and you are her child.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, no doubt; but once I had another mother, a much uglier one.\"\n\n\"Otter, cease to talk folly, else when you are no more a god I will\nbeat you. Now you are a god, and we are all your servants, except the\nShepherdess. When you speak to us you must speak roughly, like a great\nchief to the lowest of his people, calling us dogs and slaves. If you\nname me 'Baas' in public, I will beat you privately when you are no more\na god. You will do best to speak little or not at all, so that none can\ntake hold of your words, which are always foolish.\"\n\n\"If you say that I am a god, Baas, it is enough, for doubtless you have\nmet the gods and know their ways, though it is strange that none have\ntold me this before. They must be an ugly people, the gods! But how will\nit be with the Settlement men when they hear that I am a great spirit?\nThey will say: 'Does a spirit wait upon a man and call him chief? Does\na spirit clean the guns and cook the food of a man?' They will ask many\nsuch things, and the Great people will hear them. And will they think\nthen that I am a god? No, they will know me for a liar, and will kill me\nand all of us.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Leonard. Then he summoned Peter and the Settlement\nmen and addressed them. He told them that the plot had succeeded, and\nthat Otter and the Shepherdess were accepted as the gods of the People\nof the Mist. Because of this they were left alive and held in honour,\nwho, but for it, would now be dead, riddled through with the arrows of\nthe Great People. He explained to them for the second time that it was\nnecessary to the safety of all that this delusion as to the divinity of\nOtter and the Shepherdess should be maintained, since, if the slightest\nsuspicion of the fraud crossed the minds of the Great People, without\ndoubt they would all be sacrificed as impostors.\n\nThis was the tale that they must tell:--They should say that all of them\nwere hunting game in a far country with himself, Soa, and Francisco,\nwhen one night they heard a singing, and by the light of the moon they\nsaw the Shepherdess and the dwarf Otter coming towards them. Then the\nShepherdess and Otter commanded them to be their servants and travel\nwith them to a new land, and they obeyed them, black and white together,\nfor they saw that they were not mortals.--This was the tale that they\nmust tell; moreover, they must act up to their words if they would\ncontinue to look upon the sun.\n\nBut their first surprise was past, the Settlement men, who were\nquick-witted people, entered into the spirit of the plot readily enough;\nindeed, Peter caused them to repeat the story to him, so that he might\nbe sure that they had its details by heart.\n\nThen they continued their march towards the city on the hill. The two\nwhite men went first, next came Juanna and Otter followed by Soa, and\nlast of all walked the Settlement men. An hour's journey brought them to\nthe bank of the river, which, dividing above it, engirdled the town, to\nreunite near the roadway that they followed. Here canoes were ready to\ntake them across to the island, or rather the peninsula, on which\nthe city was built. On the other side of the river they found priests\nwaiting in the great gateway with two litters that had been prepared for\nJuanna and Otter respectively. This, the further bank, was lined with\nsome thousands of spectators, who, when the divine pair set their feet\nupon its shores, prostrated themselves, men, women, and children, and\nburst into a shout of welcome.\n\nJuanna and Otter took no heed. With such dignity as they could command,\nand in the dwarf's case it was not much, they entered the litters,\ndrew the hide curtains, and were borne forward swiftly. After them came\nLeonard, Francisco, and the others, while the population followed in\nsilence.\n\nNow the sun was sinking, but enough of daylight was left to show how\nstrange were the place and the people among which they found themselves.\nThe city, indeed, was rudely built of like materials and in similar\nfashion to the house in the plain that has been described already. But\nthe streets were roughly paved; each habitation stood apart from the\nother in its own garden, and the gates were of wood, fastened together\nwith primitive iron bolts. There were drinking-shops, or rather booths,\nand a large market-place, which they crossed as they ascended the hill,\nand where, as they afterwards discovered, this people carried on their\ntrade, if trade it could be called, for they had no money, and conducted\nall transactions like other savages, upon a principle of barter.\n\nAs they went Leonard took note of these things, which, to his mind,\nshowed clearly that the inhabitants of this city were the degenerate\ninheritors of some ancient and forgotten civilisation. Their\nfortifications, stone-built houses, drinking-shops, and markets\nindicated this, just as their rude system of theology, with its\ndivinities of Light and Darkness, or of Death and Life, each springing\nfrom the other, engaged in an eternal struggle, and yet one, was\nprobably the survival of some elaborate nature-myth of the early world.\n\nBut nothing struck him so much as the appearance of the people. In size\nthey were almost giants, a peculiarity which was shared by the\nwomen, some of whom measured six feet in height. In common with other\nuncivilised races most of these women were little except a girdle and a\ngoat-skin cloak that hung loosely upon their shoulders, displaying their\nmagnificent proportions somewhat freely. They were much handsomer than\nthe men, having splendid solemn eyes, very white teeth, and a remarkable\ndignity of gait. Their faces, however, wore the same sombre look as\nthose of their husbands and brothers, and they did not chatter after\nthe manner of their sex, but contented themselves with pointing out the\npeculiarities of the strangers in a few brief words to their children or\nto one another.\n\nAfter crossing the market-place the party came to a long and gentle\nascent, which terminated at a wall surrounding the lower of the two\ngreat buildings that they had seen from the plain. Passing its gates\nthey halted at the doors of the first of these edifices. Here priests\nstood with torches--at least, they judged them to be priests from the\nsymbol of the snake's head tattooed upon their naked breasts--ready to\nconduct them to their lodging, for now the night was closing in rapidly.\nSoon they found themselves within the walls of a great house, built in\nthe usual way with rough boulders, but on three sides of a square, and\nenclosing a courtyard in which a fountain bubbled. The furniture of\nthe house was rude but grotesquely carved, and in the courtyard stood\na throne, sheltered by a roof of turf, and fashioned of black wood and\nivory, with feet shaped like those of a human being. Indeed, as they\nafterwards discovered, this was the palace of the king, Olfan, who had\nbeen summarily ejected by the priests to make room for the newcomers.\n\nHere in this strange dwelling the attendant priests assigned them all\nquarters, the Settlement men in one wing, Leonard, Francisco and Soa in\nthe other, and Juanna and Otter in two separate apartments in the body\nof the building. This arrangement involved the separation of the\nparty, but it was difficult to offer objections, so they were forced to\nacquiesce in it. Presently women entered bearing food, boiled corn, milk\nin bowls, and roasted flesh in plenty, of which Leonard and Francisco\nate with thankfulness.\n\nBefore they went to sleep Leonard looked into the courtyard, and was\nsomewhat alarmed to find that guards were stationed at every door, while\nin front of those leading to the apartments of Juanna and Otter stood a\nbody of priests with torches in their hands. He made an effort to pass\nthrough these guards in order to visit Juanna, but without a word\nthey lifted their great spears and stopped him, and for that time he\nabandoned the attempt.\n\n\"Why do the priests stand before the door of the Shepherdess, Soa?\"\nasked Leonard.\n\n\"They guard the place of the gods,\" she answered. \"Unless the gods will\nit, none may enter there.\"\n\n\"Say, Soa,\" Leonard asked again, \"are you not afraid of being here in\nyour own land?\"\n\n\"I am much afraid, Deliverer, for if I am found out then I die. Yet many\nyears have gone by since I fled; few live who knew me, and, perchance,\nnone remember me. Also now I do not wear my hair after the fashion of\nmy people, and therefore I may escape, unless the priests discover me by\ntheir magic. And now I would sleep.\"\n\nOn the following morning at dawn Leonard rose and, accompanied by\nFrancisco, walked into the courtyard. This time the soldiers did not try\nto stop them, but the priests were still standing in front of Juanna's\ndoor, looking like spectres in the grey mist. They went to them and\nsignified by signs that they would worship the Queen, but were sternly\nrefused admission in words which they could not understand, but that\nSoa, who was listening, afterwards translated to them.\n\n\"The Mother had come to her home,\" said the spokesman, \"and might be\nprofaned no more by the eyes of the vulgar. The Snake also was in his\nhome, and none should look upon him.\"\n\nWhen arguments failed Leonard tried to force his way through, and was\nmet by a huge spear pointed at his throat. How things would have ended\nit is difficult to say had not Juanna herself appeared at this juncture,\nstanding between the curtains of the doorway. At the sight of her the\npriests and soldiers fell upon their faces, and Leonard had sufficient\npresence of mind to follow their example, dragging Francisco down beside\nhim.\n\n\"What is this tumult?\" she asked the guards in their own tongue.\n\n\"I tell you what it is, Juanna,\" said Leonard, rubbing his head upon the\nground and speaking in English. \"If you do not come to an understanding\nwith these scoundrels, you will soon be cut of from all communication\nwith us, and what is more, we shall be cut off too in another way. Will\nyou be so good as to issue an order that we are to be admitted when we\nlike?\"\n\nJuanna turned towards the priest and spoke angrily:\n\n\"Who has dared to forbid my servants to come before me and worship me?\nMy will is my own, and I only make it known. It is my will that these\nwhite men and yonder black woman pass in before me at their pleasure.\"\n\n\"Your will is our will, Mother,\" said the priests humbly.\n\nSo they went in, and the curtains were closed behind them.\n\n\"I am so thankful to see you,\" said Juanna. \"You don't know how\ndreadfully lonely it has been in this great room all night, and I am\nafraid of those solemn-eyed priests who stand round the doors. The women\nwho brought me food last evening crawled about the place on all fours\nlike dogs; it was horrible!\"\n\n\"I am sorry that you have been left alone,\" said Leonard, \"but you must\ntry to make better arrangements. Soa might sleep with you, at any rate.\nWhere is Otter? Let us pay him a visit; I want to see how the god is\ngetting on.\"\n\nJuanna went to the door and addressed the priests, saying that she\ndesired to be led before the Snake, and her servants with her. They\ndemurred a little, then gave way, and all four of them were conducted,\nfirst into the courtyard, in which no human being was to be seen, and\nthence to an adjoining chamber, where a curious sight awaited them. In a\nhuge chair set upon a dais sat Otter, looking furious and by no means at\nease; while stretched upon the ground in front of him lay four priests,\nwho muttered prayers unceasingly.\n\n\"Welcome, Baas!\" he cried in rapture at the sight of Leonard. \"Welcome,\nShepherdess!\"\n\n\"You idiot!\" answered Leonard in Dutch, but speaking in the most humble\nvoice, and sinking to his knees. \"If you will not remember that you are\na god, I will pay you out so soon as we are alone. Bid these fellows\nbegone; the Shepherdess will translate for you.\"\n\n\"Go, dogs!\" said Otter, taking the hint; \"go, and bring me food. I would\nspeak with my servant, who is named Baas, and with my mother.\"\n\n\"These are the words of the Snake that he speaks in the holy tongue,\"\nsaid Juanna, and she translated them.\n\nThe four priests rose, and bowing to the earth, crept backwards from the\nroom. So soon as they were gone, Otter leaped from his throne with an\nexclamation of rage that caused the others to burst out laughing.\n\n\"Laugh, Baas, laugh if you will!\" said the dwarf, \"for you have never\nbeen a god, and don't know what it is. What think you, Baas?--all night\nlong I have sat upon that great stool, while those accursed dogs burnt\nstinking stuff beneath my nostrils and muttered nonsense. One hour more\nand I should have fallen on them and killed them, for I have had no\nmeat, and hunger makes me mad.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Leonard, \"I hear footsteps! On to your throne, Otter!\nQuick, Juanna! stand by his side; we will kneel!\"\n\nThey had barely time to obey when the curtains were drawn, and a priest\nentered, holding a vessel of wood covered with a cloth. Slowly he\ncrept towards the throne, with his head bent almost to his knees; then,\nstraightening himself suddenly, he lifted up the wooden vessel and cried\naloud:\n\n\"We bring you food, O Snake. Eat and be satisfied.\"\n\nOtter took the dish, and, lifting the cloth, gazed upon its contents\nhungrily, but with an ever-growing dissatisfaction.\n\n\"Son of a dog!\" he cried in his own tongue, \"is this food to set before\na man?\" And he held the platter downwards, exposing its contents.\n\nThey were simple, consisting of various sorts of vegetables and\nwatercress--poor in quality, for the season was winter, and all of\nthem uncooked. In the centre of this fodder--whether placed there in\nobedience to some religious tradition or by way of ornament, or perhaps\nto assist the digestive process of the god, as a tenpenny nail is said\nto assist that of an ostrich--was a fine ruby stone; not so big, indeed,\nas that which Soa had given to Leonard, but still of considerable\nsize and value. Leonard saw it with delight, but not so the dwarf, the\nselfish promptings of whose stomach caused him to forget that his\nmaster had journeyed far to seek such gems as this. In the fury of his\ndisappointed appetite he stood upon the footstool of the throne, and,\nseizing the ruby, he hurled it at the priest, hitting him fair between\nthe eyes.\n\n\"Am I an eel?\" he roared, \"that I should live on water-grass, and red\ngravel?\"\n\nThen the priest, terrified at the behaviour of this strange divinity,\npicked up the offending gem--to the presence of which he attributed his\nanger--and fled, never looking behind him.\n\nJuanna and Francisco were seized with uncontrollable laughter, while\neven Soa deigned to smile. But Leonard did not smile.\n\n\"Oh, you last descendant of generations of asses!\" he said bitterly.\n\"You ass with four ears and a tenfold bray! What have you done? You have\nhurled the precious stone at the head of him who brought it, and now he\nwill bring no more. Had it not been for you, doubtless with every meal\nsuch stones would have been offered to you, and though you grew thin we\nshould all of us have become rich, and that without trouble, tricks, or\nviolence.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Baas,\" lamented Otter, \"but my rage took away my reason,\nand I forgot. See now what it is to be a god. It is to be fed upon stuff\nsuch as would gripe an ox. Oh, Baas, I would that these wild men had\nmade you a god and left me your servant!\" And again he gazed with\ndisgust upon the watercress and rows of leathery vegetables resembling\nturnips.\n\n\"You had better eat them, Otter,\" said Juanna, who was still choking\nwith laughter. \"If you don't you may get nothing more for days.\nEvidently you are supposed to have a small appetite.\"\n\nThen, driven to it by his ravening hunger, the wretched Otter fell upon\nthe turnips and munched them sullenly, Leonard rating him all the while\nfor his unequalled stupidity.\n\nScarcely had he finished his meal when there was a stir without, and\nonce again priests entered, headed on this occasion by that same aged\nman who had acted as a spokesman when Juanna declared herself on the\nprevious day, and who, as they had discovered, was named Nam. In fact\nhe had many other and much longer names, but as this was the shortest ad\nmost convenient of them, they adopted it.\n\nIt chanced that Leonard was standing by Soa, and when this priest\nentered, whom she now saw face to face for the first time, he noticed\nthat she started, trembled, and then drew back into the shadow of the\nthrone.\n\n\"Some friend of the old lady's youth,\" thought Leonard to himself. \"I\nhope he won't recognise her, that is all.\"\n\nNam bent himself in adoration before the gods, then began an address,\nthe substance of which Juanna translated from time to time. Bitterly did\nhe grieve, he said, that such an insult had been offered to the Snake\nas the presenting to him among his food of the red stone, known as the\nBlood of Aca. That man who had done this folly was doomed to die, if,\nindeed, he were not already dead. Well could they understand that, the\nMother and Snake having become reconciled, the proffering to Jal of that\nwhich reminded him of the sin of long ago was a wickedness that might\nbring a curse upon the land. Let the Snake be appeased. Command had been\ngiven that all such stones should be hidden in a secret place by him who\nhad wrought the crime, and, as he had said, if the man returned alive\nfrom that place he should be slain. But he would not return alive,\nfor to go thither was death, as it should be death henceforth even to\nmention that stone, of which but one should now be seen in the land,\nthat which the Mother wore in memory of the past.\n\n\"O Otter, my friend,\" murmured Leonard to himself, \"if I don't make you\npay for this, my name is not Outram!\"\n\nBut enough of the stones, went on Nam; he had come upon a more important\nmatter. That night an assembly of all the tribe would be held in the\ngreat temple an hour before moonrise, that the Mother and the Snake\nmight take up their royalty in the presence of the people. Thither they\nwould come to lead them and their servants at the appointed time. Was\nthis pleasing to the gods?\n\nJuanna bent her head in assent, and the priest turned to go with many\nobeisances; but before he went he spoke again, asking if all things were\nas the gods desired.\n\n\"Not altogether, my servant,\" answered Juanna. \"It is our will that\nthese, our other servants, should have free access to us at all times\nand without question. Also, it is our will that their food should be\nbrought to them with our food. Moreover, it is the desire of the Snake\nthat no more grass should be given to him to eat; for now, in these\nlatter days, having put on the flesh of men, he needs that which will\nsupport the flesh. One thing more, my servant; the Snake forgives the\naffront that was offered him, and I command that some of the greatest\nof the holy stones should be brought to me, that I may look on the blood\nwhich I shed so long ago.\"\n\n\"Alas! it may not be, Mother,\" answered the priest in tones of sorrow.\n\"All the stones, both red and blue, have been placed in bags of hide and\ncast into that place whence they can be brought no more, together with\nhim who offended. Nor can others be gathered at this season of the year,\nseeing that deep snow covers the place where they lie buried. In the\nsummer, when the sun has melted the snow, more can be found, if your\neyes still desire the sight of them.\"\n\nJuanna made no reply, and the priest went.\n\n\"Here is a pretty business,\" said Leonard. \"That idiot Otter has upset\neverything. We might have become millionaires for the asking, and now\nwe must wait for months before we so much as get sight of a ruby or a\nsapphire.\"\n\nNobody answered. Indeed, the whole party were plunged into consternation\nat the fatal effects of this accident. As for Otter himself, when he\nunderstood fully what he had done, he almost wept for grief.\n\n\"Who could have known, Baas?\" he groaned. \"It was the sight of the green\nfood that bewitched me, who have always hated the taste of grass. And\nnow my folly has undone all, and it seems that I must be a god for many\nmonths, if, indeed, they do not find me out.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Otter,\" said Leonard, moved to pity by the dwarf's genuine\ngrief. \"You have lost the stones and you will have to find them again\nsomehow. By the way, Soa, why did you start so when the old priest came\nin?\"\n\n\"Because he is my father, Deliverer,\" she answered.\n\nLeonard whistled; here was a new complication. What if Nam should\nrecognise her?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE TEMPLE OF JAL\n\nIn considerable agitation of mind Leonard bid good-bye to Juanna,\npromising to return soon, and went to visit the Settlement men, whom he\nhad not seen since the previous evening.\n\nHe found them in good case enough, so far as their material comfort was\nconcerned, for they were well supplied with food and warmly lodged. So\nmuch could not be said, however, of their mental state, for they were\nterrified by the multitude of solemn priests and warriors who watched\nthem as cats watch mice. Crouching round him dejectedly they implored\nLeonard not to leave them, saying that they expected to be murdered\nevery minute. He pacified them as well as he could and left them with\nthe assurance that he would return presently, having first reminded them\nthat the lives of all depended upon the maintenance of the delusion as\nto the divinity of Otter and the Shepherdess.\n\nThe remainder of that day passed heavily enough. After the first\nexcitement of their strange position had gone by a reaction set in, and\neverybody was much depressed. As the hours drew on, the mist, which had\nlifted a little about ten o'clock, closed in very densely, throwing\nthe ill-lighted chamber where they sat into a deep gloom. In such an\natmosphere conversation languished; indeed, at times it died altogether,\nand the only sound to be heard was that of the monotonous voices of the\npriests without the curtains, as they muttered prayers unceasingly. At\nlength Leonard could bear it no longer, but rose, declaring that he\nwas going out to see whatever might be seen. Juanna tried faintly to\ndissuade him, and Otter wished to come too, which was impossible. The\nend of it was that he went alone.\n\nFirst he revisited the Settlement men and tried to cheer them, and sadly\ndid they need cheering. Then he passed to the great gates of the palace\nyard and looked through them. The mist had lifted a little, and about a\nhundred paces away he could perceive the doors of the temple, on either\nside of which rose Cyclopean walls fifty feet or more in height. It was\nobvious that here preparations for some ceremony were in progress, and\non a large scale, for immense crowds of people were gathered about the\ndoors, through which bodies of priests and armed men passed continually.\nMore he could not learn, for the gates of the palace yard were barred\nand guarded, and the soldiers would not let him through. He stood by\nthem watching till sunset, then returning to the others, he told them\nwhat he had seen.\n\nAnother hour passed, and suddenly the curtains were drawn aside and a\nbody of priests entered, twelve in number, bearing large candles of fat\nin their hands, and headed by their chief, Nam. Prostrating themselves\nbefore Juanna and Otter they remained plunged in silence.\n\n\"Speak on,\" said Juanna at length.\n\n\"We come, O Mother, and O Snake,\" said the priest Nam, \"to lead you to\nthe temple that the people may look upon their gods.\"\n\n\"It is well; lead on,\" Juanna answered.\n\n\"First you must be robed, Mother,\" said Nam, \"for without the temple\nnone may look upon your divinity, save your priests alone.\"\n\nRising as he spoke, he produced a black dress from a grass bag, which\nwas carried by an attendant. This dress was very curious. It fastened in\nfront with buttons of horn, and either was, or seemed to be, woven in a\nsingle piece from the softest hair of black-fleeced goats. Moreover, it\nhad sleeves just long enough to leave the hands of the wearer visible,\nand beneath its peaked cap was a sort of mask with three slits, two for\nthe eyes and one for the mouth.\n\nJuanna retired to put on this hideous garment over her white robe, and\nreappeared presently, looking like the black ghost of a mediaeval monk.\nThen the priests gave her two flowers, a red lily and a white, to be\nheld in either hand, and it appeared that her equipment was complete.\nNext they came to Otter and bound a scarlet fringe of hair about his\nforehead in such fashion that the fringe hid his eyes, at the same\ntime placing in his hand a sceptre of ivory, apparently of very ancient\nworkmanship, and fashioned in the shape of a snake standing on its tail.\n\n\"All is prepared,\" said Nam.\n\n\"Lead on,\" answered Juanna again. \"But let our servants come with us,\nboth those here and those without, save the woman only, who stays to\nmake ready for our return.\"\n\nJuanna spoke thus because Soa had announced her wish to be left behind\nwhen they went to the temple. Juanna had consulted Leonard on the\nsubject, who gave it as his opinion that Soa had good reasons of her own\nfor making this request. Also he pointed out that in case of disturbance\nshe could scarcely help them, and might possibly prove an encumbrance.\n\n\"They wait,\" answered Nam; \"all is prepared for _them_ also\": and as he\nspoke a sardonic smile flickered on his withered countenance that made\nLeonard feel very uncomfortable. What was prepared, he wondered?\n\nThey passed through the curtains into the courtyard, where soldiers,\nclad in goat-skin cloaks, waited with two litters. Here also were\nthe Settlement men, armed, but in an extremity of fear, for they were\nguarded by about fifty of the Great People, also armed.\n\nJuanna and Otter entered the litters, behind which Leonard formed up his\nlittle band, going in front of it himself with Francisco, both of them\nhaving rifles in their hands and revolvers at their girdles, of which no\nattempt was made to deprive them, for none knew their use.\n\nThen they started, surrounded by the bare-breasted priests, who chanted\nand waved torches as they walked, and preceded and followed by the\ngrim files of tall soldiers, on whose spears the torch-light flashed\nominously. As they came the gates of the palace yard were opened. They\npassed them and across the space beyond until they reached the doors of\nthe temple, which were thrown wide before them.\n\nHere Otter and Juanna descended from the litters, and all the torches\nwere extinguished, leaving them in darkness.\n\nLeonard felt his hand seized and was led along, he knew not where, for\nthe misty gloom was intense. He could scarcely see the face even of\nthe priest who conducted them, but from the sounds he gathered that all\ntheir party were being guided in a similar fashion. Once or twice also\nhe heard the voice of a Settlement man speaking in accents of fear or\ncomplaint, but such demonstrations were followed quickly by the sound\nof a heavy blow, dealt, no doubt, by the priest or soldier in charge of\nthat individual. Evidently it was expected that all should be silent.\nPresently Leonard became aware that they had left the open space across\nwhich they were walking, for the air grew close and their footsteps rang\nhollow on the rocky floor.\n\n\"I believe that we are in a tunnel,\" whispered Francisco.\n\n\"Silence, dog,\" hissed a priest in his ear. \"Silence, this place is\nholy.\"\n\nThey did not understand the meaning of the words at the moment, but the\ntone in which they were spoken made their purport sufficiently clear.\nLeonard took the hint, and at the same time clutched his rifle more\ntightly. He began to be afraid for their safety. Whither were they being\nled--to a dungeon? Well, they would soon know, and at the worst it was\nnot probable that these barbarians would harm Juanna. They followed\nthe tunnel or passage for about a hundred and fifty paces; at first it\nsloped downwards, then the floor became level till at length they began\nto ascend a stair. There were sixty-one stone steps in this stairway,\nfor Leonard counted them, each about ten inches high, and when all were\nclimbed they advanced eleven paces along a tunnel that echoed strangely\nto their steps, and was so low that they must bend their heads to pass\nit. Emerging from this tunnel through a narrow opening, they stood upon\na platform also of stone, and once more the chill night air fanned their\nbrows.\n\nSo dense was the gloom that Leonard could tell nothing of the place\nwhere they might be, but from far beneath them rose a hissing sound\nas of seething water, and combined with it another sound of faint\nmurmuring, as though thousands of people whispered each to each. Also\nfrom time to time he heard a rustling like that of a forest when\na gentle wind stirs its leaves, or the rustling of the robes of\ninnumerable women.\n\nThis sense of the presence of hidden waters and of an unseen multitude\nwas strange and terrifying in the extreme. It was as though, without\nperceiving them, their human faculties suddenly became aware of the\nspirits of the unnumbered dead, thronging, watching, following--there,\nbut intangible; speaking without words, touching without hands.\n\nLeonard was tempted to cry aloud, so great was the strain upon his\nnerves, which usually were strong enough; nor was he alone in this\ndesire. Presently a sound arose from below him, as of some person in\nhysterics, and he heard a priest command silence in a fierce voice.\nThe sobbing and laughter went on till it culminated in a shrill scream.\nAfter the scream came the thud of a blow, a heavy fall, a groan, and\nonce again the invisible multitudes whispered and rustled.\n\n\"Someone has been killed,\" muttered Francisco in Leonard's ear; \"who is\nit, I wonder?\"\n\nLeonard shuddered, but made no answer, for a great hand was placed upon\nhis mouth in warning.\n\nAt length the portentous silence was broken and a voice spoke, the voice\nof Nam the priest. In the silence all that he uttered could be heard\nplainly, but his words came from far away, and the sound of them was\nstill and small. This was what he said, as Juanna told it to them after\nthe ceremony.\n\n\"Hear me, ye Children of the Snake, ye ancient People of the Mist!\nHearken to me, Nam, the priest of the Snake! Many a generation gone in\nthe beginning of time, so runs the legend, the Mother goddess whom we\nworship from of old, descended from heaven and came hither to us, and\nwith her came the Snake, her child. While she tarried in the land the\ncrime of crimes was wrought, the Darkness slew the Daylight, and she\npassed hence, we know not how, or where; and from that hour the land has\nbeen a land of mist, and its people have wandered in the mist, for he\nwhose name is Darkness has ruled over them, answering their prayers with\ndeath. But this doom was on the Snake, that because of his wickedness he\nmust put off the flesh of men and descend into the holy place of waters,\nwhere, as we and our fathers have known, his symbol dwells eternally,\ntaking tribute of the lives of men.\n\n\"Yet ere that crime was wrought the Mother gave a word of promise to her\npeople. 'Now that I am about to die at the hands of him I bore, for so\nit is fated,' she said. 'But not for ever do I leave you, and not for\never shall the Snake be punished by putting off the flesh of men. Many\ngenerations shall go by and we will return again and rule over you, and\nthe veil of mist shall be lifted from your land, and ye shall be great\nin the earth. Till then, choose you kings and let them govern you;\nmoreover, forget not my worship, and see to it that throughout the ages\nthe altar of the Snake is wet with blood, and that he lacks not the food\nhe loves. And I will give you a sign by which we shall be known when at\nlength the fate is accomplished, and the hour of forgiveness is at hand.\n\n\"'As a fair maid will I come again, a maid lovely and white, but because\nof his sin the Snake shall appear in the shape of that which sits within\nyour temple, and his hue shall be black and his face hideous. Out of the\nearth will we arise, and we will call to you and ye shall know us, and\nwe will tell you our holy names that shall not be spoken aloud from\nthis hour to that hour of our coming. But beware lest ye be deceived\nand false gods set themselves up among you, for then shall the last evil\nfall upon you and the sun shall hide his face.'\n\n\"Thus, Children of the Mist, did the Mother speak to him who was her\nchief priest in the long ago, and he graved her words with iron on the\nstone of that whereon I stand, but none can read that writing, for its\nsecret is lost to us, although the prophecy remains. And now the time is\nfull, and it has been given to me, his successor, in my old age, to see\nthe fulfilment of the saying.\n\n\"The time is full, and this night the promise of the past is\naccomplished, for, People of the Mist, the immortal gods, whose names\nare holy, have appeared to rule their children. Yesterday they came,\nye saw them, and in your ears they called aloud the sacred names. As a\nmaiden fair and white, and as a dwarf black and hideous, have they\ncome, and _Aca_ is the name of the maiden, and _Jal_ is the name of the\ndwarf.\"\n\nHe ceased, and his voice died away in the echoes of the great place.\nOnce again there was silence, broken only by the seething sound of\nwaters and the indefinable murmur of an unseen throng beneath.\n\nLeonard stood awhile, then edged himself gently forward with the design\nof discovering where and upon what they were standing. His curiosity\nsoon met with a violent check, for before he had gone a yard he felt\nthat his right foot was dangling in space, and it was only by a strong\neffort that he prevented himself from falling, whither he knew not.\n\nRecovering his balance, he shuffled himself back again to the side of\nFrancisco, and whispered a warning to him not to move if he valued his\nlife. As Leonard spoke, he noticed that the blackness of the night\nwas turning grey with the light of the unrisen moon. Already her rays,\nstriking upwards, brightened the sky above and the mountains behind,\nand from them fell a pale reflection, which grew gradually stronger and\nclearer.\n\nNow he could discover that close upon him to the left a black mass\ntowered high into the air, and that far beneath him gleamed something\nlike the foam on broken water. For a time he watched this water, or\nwhatever it might be, until a smothered exclamation from Francisco\ncaused him to look up again. As he looked, the edge of the moon rose\nabove the temple wall, and by slow degrees a wonderful sight was\nrevealed to him. Not till the moon was fully visible did he see\neverything, and to describe all as he discovered it, piecemeal, would be\ndifficult. This was what Leonard saw at length.\n\nBefore him and underneath him lay a vast and roofless building, open to\nthe east, covering some two acres of ground, and surrounded by Titanic\nwalls, fifty feet or more in height. This building was shaped like a\nRoman amphitheatre, but, with the exception of the space immediately\nbelow him, its area was filled with stone seats, and round its wide\ncircumference stone seats rose tier on tier. These were all occupied by\nmen and women in hundreds, and, except at the further end, scarcely a\nplace was empty. At the western extremity of the temple a huge statue\ntowered seventy or eighty feet into the air, hewn, to all appearance,\nfrom a mass of living rock. Behind this colossus, and not more than\na hundred paces from it, the sheer mountain rose, precipice upon\nprecipice, to the foot of a white peak clad in eternal snow. It was the\npeak that they had seen from the plain when the mist lifted, and the\nstatue was the dark mass beneath it which had excited their curiosity.\n\nThis fearful colossus was fashioned to the shape of a huge dwarf of\nhideous countenance, seated with bent arms outstretched in a forward\ndirection, and palms turned upwards as though to bear the weight of the\nsky. The statue stood, or rather sat, upon a platform of rock; and not\nmore than four paces from its base, so that the outstretched hands and\nslightly bowed head overhung it indeed, was a circular gulf measuring,\nperhaps, thirty yards across, in which seething waters raged and boiled.\nWhence they came and whither they went it was impossible to see, but\nLeonard discovered afterwards that here was the source of the river\nwhich they had followed for so many days. Escaping from the gulf by\nunderground passages that it had hollowed for itself through the solid\nrock, the two branches of the torrent passed round the walls of the\ntown, to unite again in the plain below. How the pool itself was\nsupplied Leonard was destined to learn in after days.\n\nBetween the steep polished sides of the rock basin and the feet of the\nstatue was placed an altar, or sacrificial stone. Here on this ledge,\nwhich covered an area no greater than that of a small room, and in front\nof the altar, stood a man bound, in whom Leonard recognised Olfan, the\nking, while on either side of him were priests, naked to the waist, and\narmed with knives. Behind them again stood the little band of Settlement\nmen, trembling with terror. Nor were their fears groundless, for there\namong them lay one of their number, dead. This was the man whose nerve\nhad broken down, who shrieked aloud in the darkness, and in reward had\nbeen smitten into everlasting silence.\n\nAll this Leonard saw by degrees, but the first thing that he saw has\nnot yet been told. Long before the brilliant rays of the moon lit the\namphitheatre they struck upon the huge head of the dwarf idol, and\nthere, on this giddy perch, some seventy feet from the ground, and\nnearly a hundred above the level of the pool of seething water, sat\nJuanna herself, enthroned in an ivory chair. She had been divested of\nher black cloak, and was clad in the robe of snowy linen cut low upon\nher breast, and fastened round her waist with a girdle. Her dark hair\nflowed about her shoulders; in either hand she held the lilies, red and\nwhite, and upon her forehead glowed the ruby like a blood-red star. She\nsat quite still, her eyes set wide in horror; and first the moonlight\ngleamed upon the gem bound to her forehead, next it showed the pale and\nlovely face beneath, then her snowy arms and breast, the whiteness of\nher robes, and the hideous demon head whereon her throne was fixed.\n\nNo spirit could have seemed more beautiful than this woman set thus\non high in that dark place of blood and fear. Indeed, in the unearthly\nlight she looked like a spirit, the spirit of beauty triumphing over\nthe hideousness of hell, the angel of light trampling the Devil and his\nworks.\n\nIt was not wonderful that this fierce and barbarous people sighed\nlike reeds before the wind when her loveliness dawned upon them, made\nethereal by the moon, or that thenceforth Leonard could never think of\nher quite as he thought of any other woman. Under such conditions most\nwell-favoured women would have appeared beautiful; Juanna did more, she\nseemed divine.\n\nAs the light grew downward and the shadows thinned before it, Leonard\nfollowed with his eyes, and presently he discovered Otter. The dwarf,\nnaked except for his girdle and the fringe upon his head, was also\nenthroned, holding the ivory sceptre in his hand, but in a seat of ebony\nplaced upon the knees of the colossus, nearly forty feet below Juanna.\n\nThen Leonard turned to consider Francisco's position and his own, and\nfound it terrible enough. Indeed, the moment that he discovered it was\nnigh to being his last. In company with two priests of the Snake, they\nwere standing on the palm of the right hand of the idol, that formed a\nlittle platform some six feet square, which they had won in the darkness\nthrough a tunnel hewn in the arm of stone. There they stood unprotected\nby any railing or support, and before them and on either side of them\nwas a sheer drop of some ninety feet to the water beneath or of fifty to\nthe rock of the platform.\n\nLeonard saw, and for a moment turned faint and dizzy, then, setting the\nbutt of his rifle on to the stone, he leaned upon the barrel till\nhis brain cleared. It was well for him that he had not known what lay\nbeneath when, but now, he thrust his foot into vacancy, for then his\nsenses might have failed him.\n\nSuddenly he remembered Francisco, and opened his eyes, which he had\nclosed to shut out the sight of the yawning gulf beneath. It was not\ntoo soon. The priest had seen also, and consciousness was deserting\nhim; even as Leonard turned his knees gave way, and he sank forward and\ndownward.\n\nQuick as thought Leonard stretched out his right hand and caught\nFrancisco by the robe he wore, then, resting his weight upon the rifle,\nhe strained at the priest's falling body with all his force in such\na manner that its direction was turned, and it fell sideways upon the\nplatform, not downwards into space. Leonard dragged at him again, and\nthrust him into the mouth of the little tunnel through which they had\nreached this dreadful eminence, where he lay quiet and safe, lost in\nblessed insensibility.\n\nAll this took place in a few seconds. The two priests of the Snake, who\nstood by them as calmly as though their feet were still on the solid\nearth, saw, but made no movement. Only Leonard thought that they smiled\ngrimly, and a horrible fear struck his heart like a breath of ice. What\nif they waited a signal to cast him down? It might well be so. Already\nhe had seen enough of their rites to enable him to guess that theirs was\na religion of blood and human sacrifice.\n\nHe shivered, and again turned faint, so faint indeed that he did not\ndare to keep his feet, but sank into a sitting posture, resting his back\nagainst the stone of the idol's thumb.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nHOW JUANNA CONQUERED NAM\n\nStill the silence endured, and still the moonlight grew, creeping lower\nand lower till it shone upon the face of the seething waters, and,\nexcept in the immediate shadow of the walls, all the amphitheatre was\nfull of it.\n\nThen the voice of Nam spoke again from far away, and Leonard looked to\nsee whence he spoke. Now he saw. Nam, attended by three priests, was\nperched like an eagle on the left palm of the colossus, and from this\ndizzy platform he addressed the multitude. Looking across the breast of\nthe statue, Leonard could just see the outstretched arm and the fierce\nface of the high priest as he glared down upon the people.\n\n\"Hearken, ye Dwellers in the Mist, Children of the Snake! Ye have seen\nyour ancient gods, your Father and your Mother, come back to rule you\nand to lead you on through war to peace, to wealth, to power, and to\nglory. Ye see them now by that light and in that place wherein only it\nis lawful that ye should look upon them. Say, do ye believe and do ye\naccept them? Answer, every one of you, answer with your voice!\"\n\nThen a mighty roar of sound went up from the gathered thousands, a roar\nthat shaped itself into the words:\n\n\"We believe and we accept.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" said Nam when the tumult had died away. \"Hearken, ye high\ngods! O Aca! and O Jal! Bend down your ears and deign to hearken to your\npriest and servant, speaking in the name of your children, the People\nof the Mist. Be ye kings to reign over us! Accept the power and the\nsacrifice, and sit in the place of kings. We give you rule through all\nthe land; the life of every dweller in the land is yours; yours are\ntheir cattle and their goats, their city and their armies. For you the\naltars shall run red, the cry of the victim shall be music in your ears.\nYe shall look upon him whom long ago ye set to guard the secret awful\nplace, and he shall crawl beneath your feet. As ye ruled our fathers so\nye shall rule us, according to the customs which ye laid down for ever.\nGlory be to you, O Aca, and to you, O Jal! immortal kings for evermore!\"\n\nAnd in a shout that rent the skies the great audience echoed: \"Glory be\nto you, O Aca, and to you, O Jal, immortal kings for evermore!\"\n\nThen Nam spoke again, saying: \"Bring forth the virgin, that fair maid\nwho is destined to the Snake, that he may look upon her and accept her\nas his wife. Bring her forth also who, twelve months gone, was vowed in\nmarriage to the Shape of stone, that she may bid her lord farewell.\"\n\nAs he spoke there was a stir behind the idol, and presently from each\nside of it a woman was led forward by two priests on to the little space\nof rock between its feet and the edge of the gulf, and placed one to the\nright of the altar, and one to the left. Both these women were tall and\nlovely with the dark and somewhat terrifying beauty of the People of the\nMist, but there the resemblance between them ended. She to the right was\nnaked except for a girdle of snake-skin and the covering of her abundant\nhair, which was crowned with a wreath of red lilies similar to the\nflower that the priests had given to Juanna. She to the left, on the\ncontrary, was clothed in a black robe round which was broidered the\nshape of a blood-red snake, whose head rested upon her breast. Leonard\nnoticed that the appearance of this woman was that of extreme terror,\nfor she shrank and trembled, whereas that of the flower-crowned bride\nwas jubilant and even haughty.\n\nFor a moment the two women stood still while the people gazed upon them.\nThen, at a signal from Nam, she who was crowned with flowers was led\nbefore the altar, and thrice she bowed the knee to the idol, or rather\nto Otter who sat upon it. Now all eyes were fixed on the dwarf, who\nstared at the girl but made no sign, which was not wonderful, seeing\nthat he had no inkling of the meaning of the ceremony. As it chanced,\nhe could not have acted more wisely, at least in the interests of the\nbride, for here, as elsewhere, silence was held to give consent.\n\n\"Behold, the god accepts,\" cried Nam, \"the beauty of the maid is\npleasing in his eyes. Stand aside, Saga, the blessed, that the people\nmay look upon you and know you. Hail to you, wife of the Snake!\"\n\nSmiling triumphantly the girl moved back to her place by the altar, and\nturned her proud face to the people. Then the multitude shouted:\n\n\"Hail to you, bride of the Snake! Hail to you, the blessed, chosen of\nthe god!\"\n\nWhile the tumult still lasted, the woman who was clad in the black robe\nwas led forward, and when it had died away she also made her obeisance\nbefore the idol.\n\n\"Away with her that she may seek her Lord in his own place,\" cried Nam.\n\n\"Away with her, her day is done,\" echoed the multitude. Then, before\nJuanna could interfere, before she could even speak, for, be it\nremembered, she alone understood all that was said, the two priests who\nguarded the doomed woman rent the robe from her and with one swing of\ntheir strong arms hurled her backwards far into the pool of seething\nwaters.\n\nShe fell with a shriek and lay floating on their surface, flung this way\nand that by the eddy of the whirlpool just where the moonlight beat most\nbrightly. All who could of the multitude bent forward to see her end,\nand overcome by a fearful fascination, Leonard threw himself on his\nface, and, craning his head over the stone of the idol's hand, watched\nalso, for the girl's struggling shape was almost immediately beneath\nhim. Another minute and he would have foregone the hope of winning the\ntreasure which he had come so far to seek, not to have yielded to the\nimpulse.\n\nFor as he stared, the waters beneath the feet of the idol were agitated\nas a pond is agitated by the rush of a pike when he dashes at his prey.\nThen for an instant the light gleamed upon a dull enormous shape, and\nsuddenly the head of a crocodile reared itself out of the pool. The head\nof a crocodile, but of such a crocodile as he had never heard or dreamed\nof, for this head alone was broader than the breast of the biggest man,\nits dull eyes were the size of a man's fist, its yellow fangs were like\nthe teeth of a lion, and from its lower jaw hung tentacles or lumps\nof white flesh which at that distance gave it the appearance of being\nbearded like a goat. Also, the skin of this huge reptile, which could\nnot have measured less than fifty feet in length by four feet in depth,\nwas here and there corroded into rusty excrescences, as though some\nfungus or lichen had grown upon it like grey moss on an ancient wall.\nIndeed, its appearance seemed to point to extreme antiquity.[*]\n\n[*] Crocodiles are proverbially long-lived, but Leonard could never\ndiscover the age of this particular reptile. On enquiry he was able to\ntrace it back for three hundred yards, and tradition said that it had\nalways dwelt among the People of the Mist from \"the beginning of time.\"\nAt least it was very old, and under the name of the Snake had been an\nobject of worship for many generations. How it came among the People of\nthe Mist is difficult to say, for no other specimen appeared to exist in\nthe country. Perhaps it was captured in some distant age and placed in\nthe cave by the priests, to figure as an incarnation of the Snake that\nwas the object of their worship.\n\nHearing the disturbance in the water, the reptile had emerged from the\ncave where it dwelt beneath the feet of the idol, to seek its accustomed\nfood, which consisted of the human victims that were cast to it at\ncertain intervals. It reared its hideous head and glared round, then of\na sudden the monster and the victim vanished together into the depths.\n\nSick with horror Leonard drew himself back into a sitting posture, and\nglanced up at Juanna. She was crouched in her ivory chair overcome, and\nher eyes were closed, either through faintness or to shut out the sight\nof dread. Then he looked down at Otter. The dwarf, staring fixedly at\nthe water, sat still as the stone effigy that supported him. Evidently\nin all his varied experience he had seen no such thing as this.\n\n\"The Snake has accepted the sacrifice,\" cried Nam again; \"the Snake has\ntaken her who was his bride to dwell with him in his holy house. Let the\nofferings be completed, for this is but the first-fruit. Take Olfan who\nwas king, and offer him up. Cast down the white servants of the Mother,\nand offer them up. Seize the slaves who stood before her in the plain,\nand offer them up. Lead forth the captives, and offer them up. Let the\nsacrifice of the Crowning of Kings be accomplished according to custom,\nthat the god whose name is Jal may be appeased; that he may listen\nto the pleadings of the Mother, that the sun may shine upon us, that\nfruitfulness may fill the land and peace be within its gates.\"\n\nThus he cried while Leonard felt his blood turn cold and his hair rise\nupon his head, for though he could not understand the words, he guessed\ntheir purport and his instinct told him that a great danger threatened\nthem. He looked at the two priests who stood by, and they glared\nhungrily on him in answer. Then his courage came back to him; at least\nhe had his rifle and would fight for his life. It must go hard if he\ncould not put a bullet through one or both of them before they got a\nhold of him.\n\nMeanwhile the priests below had seized the king Olfan, whose giant form\nthey were dragging towards the stone of sacrifice. But of a sudden, for\nthe first time Juanna spoke, and a deep silence fell upon the temple and\nall within it.\n\n\"Hearken, People of the Mist,\" she said; and her voice falling from that\ngreat height seemed small and far away, although so clear that every\nword was audible in the stillness of the night.\n\n\"Hear me, People of the Mist, and ye, priests of the Snake. Aca is come\nagain and Jal is come again, and ye have given them back their rule\nafter many generations, and in their hands lies the life of every one of\nyou. As the old tradition told of them so they are, the Mother and the\nChild, and the one is clothed with beauty, the symbol of life and of the\nfruitful earth; and the other is black and hideous, the symbol of death\nand the evil that walks upon the earth. And ye would do sacrifice to Jal\nthat he may be appeased according to the ancient law, and listen to the\npleading of the Mother that fruitfulness may fill the land. Not so shall\nJal be appeased, and not because of the sacrifice of men shall Aca plead\nwith him that prosperity may reign in the land.\n\n\"Behold, the old law is done away, and we give you a new law. Now is the\nhour of reconciliation, now Life and Death walk hand in hand, and the\nhearts of Aca and Jal have grown gentle through the ages, and they\nno longer crave the blood of men as an offering to their majesty.\nHenceforth ye shall bring them fruits and flowers, and not the lives of\nmen. See, in my hand I hold winter lilies, red and white, blood-red\nthey are and white as snow. Now the red flower, token of sacrifice and\nslaughter, I crush and cast away, but the white bloom of love and peace\nI set upon my breast. It is done, gone is the old law; see, it falls\ninto the place of the Snake, its home; but the new law blossoms above\nmy heart and in it. Shall it not be so, my children, People of the Mist?\nWill ye not accept my mercy and my love?\"\n\nThe multitude watched the red bloom as, bruised and broken, through the\nlight and through the shadow, they fell slowly to the seething surface\nof the pool; then it looked up like one man and saw the white lily set\nupon Juanna's whiter breast. They saw, and, moved by a common impulse,\nthey rose with a sound like the rush of the wind and shouted:\n\n\"Gone is the day of blood and sacrifice, come is the day of peace! We\nthank you, Mother, and we take your mercy and your love.\"\n\nThen they were silent, and again there was a sound like that of the\nwind, as all their thousands sank back to the seats of stone.\n\nNow Nam spoke again in a voice of fury that rang through the still air\nlike a clarion.\n\n\"What is this that my ears hear?\" he cried. \"Are ye mad, O ye Dwellers\nin the Mist? Or does the Mother speak with a charmed voice? Shall the\nancient worship be changed in an hour? Nay, not the gods themselves can\nalter their own worship. Slay on, ye priests, slay on, or ye yourselves\nshall die the dreadful death.\"\n\nThe priests below heard, and seizing the struggling king they cast him\nwith difficulty down upon the stone.\n\n\"Leonard, Leonard,\" cried Juanna in English, addressing him for the\nfirst time by his Christian name, as even then he noticed, but looking\nstraight before her that none might guess to whom she spoke. \"These\npriests are going to kill you and all of us, except Otter and myself. If\nyou can, when you see me point with my hand, shoot that man who is about\nto sacrifice the king. Make no answer.\"\n\nLeonard heard and understood all. Resting his back firmly against the\nthumb of the statue, he shifted his position a little so that the group\nbelow him came within his line of sight, and waited, watching Juanna,\nwho now was speaking again in the language of the People of the Mist.\n\n\"This I promise you, ministers of blood,\" she said, \"if ye obey me not\nye shall indeed die the dreadful death, the death unknown. Hearken, my\nservant, who are named Deliverer,\" and she looked down upon Leonard,\n\"and do my bidding. If one of these shall dare to lift his hand against\nyonder man, slay him swiftly as you know how.\"\n\n\"Smite on,\" screamed Nam, \"smite on and fear not.\"\n\nMost of the priests drew back affrighted; but one ruffian lifted his\nknife, and at that moment Juanna pointed with her hand. Then Leonard,\nstepping forward, covered the priest's great breast with his rifle as\nsurely as the uncertain light would allow. Unconscious of his danger,\nthe executioner muttered an invocation. Now the knife was about to fall\nupon the throat of Olfan, when fire and smoke sprang out far above him,\nthe rifle rang, and, shot through the heart, the priest leaped high into\nthe air and fell dead. Terror seized the witnesses of this unaccustomed\nand, to them, most awful sight.\n\n\"The gods speak with flame and thunder,\" one cried, \"and death is in the\nflame.\"\n\n\"Silence, dogs!\" screamed Nam, \"ye are bewitched. Ho! you that stand on\nhigh, cast down the wizard who is named Deliverer, and let us see who\nwill deliver him from death upon the stone.\"\n\nThen one of the guards who stood by him made a movement to grasp Leonard\nand throw him down, but the other was terrified and could not stir. The\nfirst man stretched out his arm, but before it so much as touched its\naim he himself was dead, for, seeing his purpose, Leonard had lifted the\nrifle, and once more its report rang through the temple. Suddenly the\npriest threw his arms wide, then fell backwards, and with a mighty rush\ndived into sheer space to crash lifeless on the stone floor below, where\nhe lay, his head and hands hanging over the edge of the pool.\n\nNow for the first time Otter's emotions overcame him. He stood up on the\nknees of the dwarf, and shaking the sceptre in his hand, he pointed\nwith it to the dead men on the paving below, at the same time crying in\nstentorian tones:\n\n\"Well done, Baas, well done! Now tumble the old one yonder off his\nperch, for I weary of his howlings.\"\n\nThis speech of Otter's produced even a greater effect on the spectators,\nif that were possible, than the mysterious death of the priests. That\nhe whose name was Silence should cry aloud in a strange tongue, of\nwhich they understood no single word, was a dread and ominous thing\nthat showed his anger to be deep. But Leonard took no heed, he was too\nengaged in covering the second guard with the barrel of his repeater.\nThis man, however, had no liking for such a dreadful death. Swiftly he\nflung himself on to his knees, imploring Leonard to spare him in humble\naccents, and with gestures that spoke more plainly than his words.\n\nTaking advantage of the pause, again Juanna cried aloud: \"Ye see, People\nof the Mist, I make no idle threats. Where are they now, the disobedient\nones? The tongue of flame has licked them and they are dead, and as they\nhave perished, so shall all perish who dare to gainsay my word, or the\nword of Jal. Ye know us for gods and ye have crowned us kings, and gods\nand kings we are indeed. Yet fear not, for on the rebellious only shall\nour anger fall. Answer you, Nam. Will you do our bidding? Or will you\ndie also as your servants died?\"\n\nNam glanced round desperately. He looked down on the multitude and found\nno help there. Long had they cowered beneath him; now hope was born in\ntheir breasts, and in the presence of a power greater than his, if\nonly for a little while, they broke his yoke and the yoke of their red\nsuperstitions. He looked at the company of priests; their heart was\nout of them, they were huddled together like knots of frightened sheep,\nstaring at the corpses of their two companions. Then he bethought him\nof Otter. Surely there was refuge in the god of blood and evil; and he\ncried to him:\n\n\"The Mother has spoken, but the Mother is not the child. Say, O Jal,\nwhat is your command?\"\n\nOtter made no answer, because he did not understand; but Juanna replied\nswiftly:\n\n\"I am the mouth of Jal, as Jal is my hand. When I speak I speak the\nwords of Jal. Do his bidding and mine, or die, you disobedient servant.\"\n\nThis was the end of it. Nam was beaten; for the first time in his life\nhe must own a master, and that master the gods whom he had himself\ndiscovered and proclaimed.\n\n\"So be it,\" he said suddenly. \"The old order passes, and the new order\ncomes. So be it! Let your will be done, O Aca and O Jal. I have striven\nfor your glory, I have fed your altars, and ye threaten me with death\nand put away my gift. Priests, set free that man who was king. People,\nhave your way, forget your ancient paths, pluck the white flower of\npeace--and perish! I have said.\"\n\nSo he spoke from on high, shaking his clenched fists above his hoary\nhead, and was gone. Then the executioners unbound the limbs of the\nex-king, and he rose from the stone of death.\n\n\"Olfan,\" cried Juanna from on high, \"you that were the king, we, who\nhave taken your kingship, give you life, and liberty, and honour; see\nthat in reward you serve us well, lest again you should lie upon that\nbed of stone. Do you swear fealty to us?\"\n\n\"For ever and for ever. I swear it by your holy heads,\" answered Olfan.\n\n\"It is well. Now under us once more we give you command of the armies of\nthis people, our children. Summon your captains and your soldiers. Bid\nthose that brought us hither lead us back whence we came, and there set\nguards about us, so that none trouble us. For you, our people, for this\ntime fare you well. Go in peace to dwell in peace beneath the shadow of\nour strength.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nOLFAN TELLS OF THE RUBIES\n\nIt was at this juncture that Francisco recovered his senses. \"Oh!\" he\ngasped, opening his eyes and sitting up, \"is it done, and am I dead?\"\n\n\"No, no, you are alive and safe,\" answered Leonard. \"Stay where you are\nand don't look over the edge, or you will faint again. Here, take my\nhand. Now, you brute,\" and he made energetic motions to the surviving\npriest, indicating that he must lead them back along the path by which\nthey had come, at the same time tapping his rifle significantly.\n\nThe man understood and started down the darksome tunnel as though he\nwere glad to go, Leonard holding his robe with one hand, while with the\nother he pressed the muzzle of the loaded rifle against the back of his\nneck. Francisco followed, leaning on Leonard's shoulder, for he could\nnot walk alone.\n\nAs they had come so they returned. They passed down the steps of stone\nwhich were hollowed in the body of the colossus; they traversed the long\nunderground tunnel, and at length, to their intense relief, once more\nthey stood upon the solid ground and in the open air. Now that the moon\nwas up, and the mist which had darkened the night had melted, they could\nsee their whereabouts. They had emerged upon a platform of rock within\na bowshot of the great gates of the palace, from whence the secret\nsubterranean passage used by the priests was gained, its opening being\nhidden cunningly among the stone-work of the temple.\n\n\"I wonder where the others are,\" asked Leonard anxiously of Francisco.\n\nAs he spoke, Juanna, wrapped in her dark cloak, appeared, apparently\nout of the stones of the wall, and with her Otter, the Settlement men\nbearing their dead companion, and a considerable company of priests,\namong whom, however, Nam was not to be seen.\n\n\"Oh, is that you, Leonard?\" said Juanna in English, and in a voice\nbroken with fear. \"Thank Heaven that you are safe!\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven that we are all safe,\" he answered. \"Come, let us get on.\nNo, we can walk, thank you,\" and he waved away the priests, who produced\nthe litters from where they had hidden them under the wall.\n\nThe men fell back and they walked on. At the gate of the palace a\nwelcome sight met their eyes, for here stood Olfan, and with him at\nleast a hundred captains and soldiers, who lifted their spears in salute\nas they advanced.\n\n\"Olfan, hear our bidding,\" said Juanna. \"Suffer no priest of the Snake\nto enter the palace gates. We give you command over them, even to death.\nSet guards at every doorway and come with us.\"\n\nThe ex-king bowed and issued some orders, in obedience to which the\nsullen priests fell back murmuring. Then they all passed the gates,\ncrossed the courtyard, and presently stood in the torch-lit throne-room,\nwhere Juanna had slept on the previous night. Here food had been\nprepared for them by Soa, who looked at them curiously, especially at\nLeonard and Francisco, as though, indeed, she had never expected to see\nthem again.\n\n\"Hearken, Olfan,\" said Juanna, \"we have saved your life to-night and you\nhave sworn fealty to us; is it not so?\"\n\n\"It is so, Queen,\" the warrior answered. \"And I will be faithful to\nmy oath. This heart, that but for you had now been cold, beats for you\nalone. The life you gave back to me is yours, and for you I live and\ndie.\"\n\nAs he spoke he glanced at her with an expression in which, as it\nseemed to Juanna, human feeling was mixed with supernatural awe. Was it\npossible, she wondered with a thrill of fear, that this savage king was\nmingling his worship of the goddess with admiration of the woman? And\ndid he begin to suspect that she was no goddess after all? Time would\nshow, but at least the look in his eyes alarmed her.\n\n\"Fear not,\" he went on; \"a thousand men shall guard you night and day.\nThe power of Nam is broken for a while, and now all this company may\nsleep in peace.\"\n\n\"It is well, Olfan. To-morrow morning, after we have eaten, we will talk\nwith you again, for we have much to say. Till then, watch!\"\n\nThe great man bowed and went, and at last they were alone.\n\n\"Let us eat,\" said Leonard. \"What is this? Spirit, or a very good\nimitation of it. Well, I never wanted a glass of brandy more in my\nlife.\"\n\nWhen they had finished their meal, at the request of Leonard Juanna\ntranslated all that had been said in the temple, and among her listeners\nthere was none more interested than Soa.\n\n\"Say, Soa,\" said Leonard, when she had finished, \"you did not expect to\nsee us come back alive, did you? Is that why you stayed away?\"\n\n\"No, Deliverer,\" she answered. \"I thought that you would be killed,\nevery one of you. And so it must have come about, had it not been for\nthe Shepherdess. Also, I stayed away because those who have looked upon\nthe Snake once do not desire to see him again. Many years ago I was\nbride to the Snake, Deliverer, and, had I not fled, my fate would have\nbeen the fate of her who died this night.\"\n\n\"Well, I do not wonder that you chose to go,\" said Leonard.\n\n\"Oh, Baas,\" broke in Otter, \"why did you not shoot that old medicine-man\nas I told you? It would have been easy when you were about it, Baas, and\nnow he would have been broken like an eggshell thrown from a house-top,\nand not alive and full of the meat of malice. He is mad with rage and\nwickedness, and I say that he will kill us all if he can.\"\n\n\"I rather wish I had,\" said Leonard, pulling his beard. \"I thought of\nit, but could not do everything; and on future occasions, Otter, will\nyou remember that your name is Silence? Luckily, these people do not\nunderstand you: if they did you would ruin us all. What is the matter,\nSoa?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Deliverer,\" she answered; \"only I was thinking that Nam is my\nfather, and I am glad that you did not shoot him, as this black dog, who\nis named a god, suggests.\"\n\n\"Of gods I know nothing, you old cow,\" answered Otter angrily; \"they\nare a far-off people, though it seems that I am one of them, at any rate\namong these fools, your kinsmen. But of dogs I can tell you something,\nand it is that they bite.\"\n\n\"Yes, and cows toss dogs,\" said Soa, showing her teeth.\n\n\"Here is another complication,\" thought Leonard to himself; \"one day\nthis woman will make friends with her venerable parent and betray us,\nand then where shall we be? Well, among so many dangers an extra one\ndoes not matter.\"\n\n\"I must go to bed,\" said Juanna faintly; \"my head is swimming. I cannot\nforget those horrors and that giddy place. When first I saw where I was,\nI nearly fainted and fell, but after a while I grew more used to it.\nIndeed, while I was speaking to the people I quite forgot my fear, and\nthe height seemed to exhilarate me. What a sight it was! When all\nis said and done, it is a grand thing to have lived through such an\nexperience. I wonder if anyone has ever seen its like.\"\n\n\"You are a marvellous woman, Juanna,\" said Leonard, with admiration. \"We\nowe our lives to your wit and courage.\"\n\n\"You see I was right in insisting on coming with you,\" she answered\nsomewhat aggressively.\n\n\"For our sakes, yes; for your own I am not so sure. To tell you the\ntruth, I think that we should have done better never to have started on\nthis mad expedition. However, things look a little more promising now,\nthough Nam and his company have still to be reckoned with, and we don't\nseem much nearer the rubies, which are our main object.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Juanna, \"they are gone, and we shall be lucky if we do not\nfollow them into the home of that hideous snake. Good night.\"\n\n\"Francisco,\" said Leonard, as he rolled himself up in his blanket, \"you\nhad a narrow escape to-night. If I had missed my hold!\"\n\n\"Yes, Outram, it was lucky for me that your arm is strong and your mind\nquick. Ah, I am a dreadful coward, and I can see the place now;\" and he\nshuddered. \"Always from a child I have believed that I shall die by a\nfall from some height, and to-night I thought that my hour had come. At\nfirst I did not understand, for I was watching the Senora's face in the\nmoonlight, and to me she looked like an angel. Then I saw, and my senses\nleft me. It was as though hands were stretched up from the blackness\nto drag me down--yes, I saw the hands. But you saved me, Outram, though\nthat will not help me, for I shall perish in some such way at last. So\nbe it. It is best that I should die, who cannot conquer the evil of my\nheart.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my friend,\" said Leonard; \"don't talk like that about dying.\nWe can none of us afford to die just at present--that is, unless we are\nobliged to do so. Your nerves are upset, and no wonder! As for 'the evil\nof your heart,' I wish that most men had as little--the world would be\nbetter. Come, go to sleep; you will feel very differently to-morrow.\"\n\nFrancisco smiled sadly and shook his head, then he knelt and began to\nsay his prayers. The last thing that Leonard saw before his eyes closed\nin sleep was the rapt girlish face of the priest, round which the light\nof the taper fell like an aureole, as he knelt muttering prayer after\nprayer with his pale lips.\n\nIt was nine o'clock before Leonard awoke next morning--for they had not\nslept till nearly four--to find Francisco already up, dressed, and, as\nusual, praying. When Leonard was ready they adjourned to Juanna's room,\nwhere breakfast was prepared for them. Here they found Otter, looking\nsomewhat disturbed.\n\n\"Baas, Baas,\" he said, \"they have come and will not go away!\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Leonard.\n\n\"The woman, Baas: she who was given to me to wife, and many other\nwomen--her servants--with her. There are more than twenty of them\noutside, Baas, and all of them very big. Now, what shall I do with\nher, Baas? I came here to serve you and to seek the red stones that you\ndesire, and not a woman tall enough to be my grandmother.\"\n\n\"I really don't know and don't care,\" answered Leonard. \"If you will be\na god you must take the consequences. Only beware, Otter: lock up your\ntongue, for this woman will teach you to speak her language, and she may\nbe a spy.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, I will see to that. Is not my name Silence, and shall women\nmake me talk--me, who have always hated them? But--the Baas would not\nlike to marry her himself? I am a god, as you say, though it was you who\nmade me one, Baas, not I, and my heart is large; I will give her to you,\nBaas.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" answered Leonard decidedly. \"See if the breakfast is\nready. No, I forgot, you are a god, so climb up into the throne and look\nthe part, if you can.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Juanna came from her room, looking a little pale, and\nthey sat down to breakfast. Before they had finished their meal, Soa\nannounced that Olfan was waiting without. Juanna ordered him to be\nadmitted, and presently he entered.\n\n\"Is all well, Olfan?\" asked Juanna.\n\n\"All is well, Queen,\" he answered. \"Nam and three hundred of his\nfollowing held council at dawn in the house of the priests yonder. There\nis much stir and talk in the city, but the hearts of the people are\nlight because their ancient gods have come back to us, bringing peace\nwith them.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Juanna. Then she began to question him artfully on many\nthings, and by degrees they learnt more of the People of the Mist.\n\nIt seemed, as Leonard had already guessed, that they were a very ancient\nrace, having existed for countless generations on the same misty upland\nplains. They were not, however, altogether isolated, for occasionally\nthey made war with other savage tribes. But they never intermarried\nwith these tribes, all the captives taken in their wars being offered\nin sacrifice at the religious festivals. The real governing power in the\ncommunity was the Society of the Priests of the Snake, who held their\noffice by hereditary tenure, outsiders being admitted to their body only\nunder very exceptional circumtances. The council of this society chose\nthe kings, and when they were weary of one of them, they sacrificed him\nand chose another, either from among his issue or elsewhere. This being\nthe custom, as may be imagined, the relations between church and state\nwere much strained, but hitherto, as Olfan explained with suppressed\nrage, the church had been supreme.\n\nIndeed, the king for the time being was only its mouthpiece, or\nexecutive officer. He led the armies, but the superstitions of the\npeople, and even of the soldiers themselves, prevented him from wielding\nany real power; and, unless he chanced to die naturally, his end was\nnearly always the same: to be sacrificed when the seasons were bad or\n\"Jal was angry.\"\n\nThe country was large but sparsely populated, the fighting men numbered\nnot more than four thousand, of whom about half lived in the great city,\nthe rest occupying villages here and there on the mountain slopes. As a\nrule the people were monogamous, except the priests. It was the custom\nof sacrifice which kept down the population to its low level, made the\npower of the priests absolute, and their wealth greater than that of all\nthe other inhabitants of the country put together, for they chose the\nvictims that had offended against Jal or against the mother-goddess, and\nconfiscated their possessions to \"the service of the temple.\" Thus the\ngreat herds of half-wild cattle which the travellers had seen on the\nplains belonged to the priests, and the priests took a fourth of the\nproduce of every man's field and garden--that is, when they did not take\nit all, and his life with it.\n\nTwice in every year great festivals were held in the temple of Jal,\nat the beginning of the spring season and in the autumn after the\ningathering of the crops. At each of these festivals many victims were\noffered in sacrifice, some upon the stone and some by being hurled into\nthe boiling pool beneath the statue, there to be consumed by the Snake\nor swept down the secret course of the underground river. The feast\ncelebrated in the spring was sacred to Jal, and that in the autumn to\nthe mother-goddess. But there was this difference between them--that\nat the spring ceremony female victims only were sacrificed to Jal to\npropitiate him and to avert his evil influence, while at the autumn\ncelebration males alone were offered up to the mother-goddess in\ngratitude for her gifts of plenty. Also criminals were occasionally\nthrown to the Snake that his hunger might be satisfied. The priests had\nother rites, Olfan added, and these they would have an opportunity of\nwitnessing if the spring festival, which should be celebrated on the\nsecond day from that date, were held according to custom.\n\n\"It shall not be celebrated,\" said Juanna, almost fiercely.\n\nThen Leonard, who had hitherto listened in silence, asked a question\nthrough Juanna. \"How is it,\" he said, \"that Nam and his fellows, being\nalready in absolute power, were so willing to accept the gods Jal and\nAca when they appeared in person, seeing that henceforth they must obey,\nnot rule?\"\n\n\"For two reasons, lord,\" Olfan answered; \"first, because the gods are\ngods, and their servants know them; and secondly, because Nam has of\nlate stood in danger of losing his authority. Of all the chief priests\nthat have been told of, Nam is the most cruel and the most greedy. For\nthree years he has doubled the tale of sacrifices, and though the people\nlove these sights of death, they murmur, for none know upon whom the\nknife shall fall. Therefore he was glad to greet the gods come back,\nsince he thought that they would confirm his power, and set him higher\nthan he sat before. Now he is astonished because they proclaim peace\nand will have none of the sacrifice of men, for Nam does not love such\ngentle gods.\"\n\n\"Yet he shall obey them,\" said Otter, speaking for the first time by the\nmouth of Juanna, who all this while was acting as interpreter, \"or drink\nhis own medicine, for I myself will sacrifice him to myself.\"\n\nWhen Juanna had translated the dwarf's bloodthirsty threat, Olfan bowed\nhis head meekly and smiled; clearly the prospect of Nam's removal did\nnot cause him unmixed grief. It was curious to see this stately warrior\nchief humbling his pride before the misshapen, knob-nosed Kaffir.\n\n\"Say, Olfan,\" asked Leonard, \"who cut from the rock the great statue on\nwhich we sat last night, and what is that reptile we saw when the woman\nwas thrown into the pool of troubled waters?\"\n\n\"Ask the Water-dweller of the water-dweller, the Snake of the snake, and\nthe Dwarf of his image,\" answered Olfan, nodding towards Otter. \"How\ncan I, who am but a man, tell of such things, lord? I only know that\nthe statue was fashioned in the far past, when we, who are now but a\nremnant, were a great people; and as for the Snake, he has always lived\nthere in his holy place. Our grandfather's grandfathers knew him, and\nsince that day he has not changed.\"\n\n\"Interesting fact in natural history,\" said Leonard; \"I wish I could get\nhim home alive to the Zoological Gardens.\"\n\nThen he asked another question. \"Tell me, Olfan, what became of the red\nstones yesterday, and of him who offended in offering them to the god\nyonder?\"\n\n\"The most of them were cast into the pit of waters, lord, there to be\nhidden for ever. There were three hide sacks full.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\" groaned Leonard when Juanna had translated this. \"Otter,\nyou have something to answer for!\"\n\n\"But the choicest,\" went on Olfan, \"were put in a smaller bag, and tied\nabout the neck of the man who had sinned. There were not many, but among\nthem were the largest stones, that until yesterday shone in the eyes\nof the idol, stones blue and red together. Also, there was that stone,\nshaped like a human heart, which hitherto has been worn by the high\npriest on the days of sacrifice, and with it the image of the Dwarf\nfashioned from a single gem, and that of the Water-dweller cut from the\ngreat blue stone, and other smaller ones chosen because of their beauty\nand also because they have been known for long in the land. For although\nmany of these pebbles are found where the priests dig for them, but few\nare large and perfect, and the art of shaping them is lost.\"\n\n\"And what became of the man?\" Leonard asked, speaking as quietly as he\ncould, for his excitement was great.\n\n\"Nay, I do not know,\" answered Olfan. \"I only know that he was let down\nwith ropes into the home of the Snake, and that he gained that holy\nplace, for it was told to me that he dragged rope after him, perhaps as\nhe fled before the Snake.\n\n\"Now it was promised to the man that when he had laid the bag of stones\nin the place of the Snake, for the Snake to guard for ever, his sins\nwould be purged, and, if it pleased the Water-dweller to spare him, that\nhe should be drawn up again. Thus Nam swore to him, but he did not keep\nhis oath, for when the man had entered the cave he bade those who held\nthe ropes to cast them loose, and I know not what happened to him, but\ndoubtless he is food for the Snake. None who look upon that holy place\nmay live to see the sun again.\"\n\n\"I only hope that the brute did not swallow the rubies as well as their\nbearer,\" said Leonard to Juanna; \"not that there is much chance of our\ngetting them, anyway.\"\n\nThen Olfan went, nor did he return till the afternoon, when he announced\nthat Nam and his two principal priests waited without to speak with\nthem. Juanna ordered that they should be admitted, and presently they\ncame in. Their air was humble, and their heads were bowed; but Leonard\nsaw fury gleaming in their sombre eyes, and was not deceived by this\nmask of humility.\n\n\"We come, O ye gods,\" said Nam, addressing Juanna and Otter, who sat\nside by side on the throne-like chairs: \"we come to ask your will, for\nye have laid down a new law which we do not understand. On the third\nday from now is the feast of Jal, and fifty women are made ready to be\noffered to Jal that his wrath may be appeased with their blood, and that\nhe may number their spirits among his servants, and withhold his anger\nfrom the People of the Mist, giving them a good season. This has been\nthe custom of the land for many a generation, and whenever that custom\nwas broken then the sun has not shone, nor the corn grown, nor have the\ncattle and the goats multiplied after their kind. But now, O ye gods, ye\nhave proclaimed a new law, and I, who am yet your servant, come hither\nto ask your will. How shall the feast go, and what sacrifice shall be\noffered unto you?\"\n\n\"The feast shall go thus,\" answered Juanna. \"Ye shall offer us a\nsacrifice indeed; to each of us shall ye offer an ox and a goat, and\nthe ox and the goat shall be given to the Snake to feed him, but not the\nflesh of men; moreover, the feast shall be held at noon and not in the\nnight-time.\"\n\n\"An ox and a goat--to each an ox and a goat!\" said Nam humbly, but in\na voice of bitterest sarcasm. \"As ye will so let it be, O ye\ngentle-hearted gods. And the festival shall be held at noon, and not in\nthe night season as of old. As ye will, O ye kind gods. Your word is my\nlaw, O Aca, and O Jal;\" and bowing to the ground the aged man withdrew\nhimself, followed by his satellites.\n\n\"That devilish priest makes my flesh creep,\" said Juanna, when she had\ntranslated his words.\n\n\"Oh! Baas, Baas,\" echoed Otter, \"why did you not shoot him while you\nmight? Now he will surely live to throw us to the Snake.\"\n\nAs he spoke Soa advanced from behind the thrones where she had taken\nrefuge when Nam entered.\n\n\"It is not well for a dog who gives himself out as a god to threaten\nthe life of one whom he has tricked,\" said she meaningly. \"Perchance the\nhour shall come when the true god will avenge himself on the false, and\nby the hand of his faithful servant, whom you would do to death, you\nbase-born dwarf.\" And before anyone could answer she left the chamber,\ncasting a malevolent look at Otter as she went.\n\n\"That servant of yours makes _my_ flesh creep, Juanna,\" said Leonard.\n\"One thing is clear enough, we must not allow her to overhear any more\nof our plans; she knows a great deal too much already.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand what has happened to Soa,\" said Juanna; \"she seems\nso changed.\"\n\n\"You made that remark before, Juanna; but for my part I don't think she\nis changed. The sight of her amiable parent has developed her hidden\nvirtues, that is all.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE SACRIFICE AFTER THE NEW ORDER\n\nThe third day came, the day of sacrifice after the new order. Nothing\nparticular had happened in the interval: Leonard and Francisco took some\nwalks through the city, guarded by Peter and the Settlement men; that\nwas all.\n\nThey did not see much there, except the exteriors of the houses built of\nstone and roofed with turves, and the cold stare of curiosity with which\nthey were followed by hundreds of eyes gave them a sense of unrest that\neffectually checked their efforts at closer examination. Once indeed\nthey halted in the market-place, which was thronged; whereon all\nbusiness ceased, and seller, buyer, herdsmen, and presiding priests\nflocked around staring at them, half in fear and half in curiosity, for\nthey had never seen white men before. This they could not bear, so they\nreturned to the palace.\n\nOf course Otter and Juanna, being divine, were not allowed to indulge in\nsuch recreations. They were gods and must live up to their reputation.\nFor one day Otter endured it; on the second, in spite of Leonard's\nwarnings, he sought refuge in the society of the bridge Saga. This\nwas the beginning of evil, for if no man is a hero to his _valet de\nchambre_, much less can he remain a god for long in the eyes of a\ncurious woman. Here, as in other matters, familiarity breeds contempt.\n\nLeonard saw these dangers and spoke seriously to the dwarf on the\nsubject. Still he could not conceal from himself that, putting aside the\nquestion of his _ennui_, which made his conduct natural, at any rate in\na savage, Otter's position was a difficult one. So Leonard shrugged\nhis shoulders and consoled himself as best he could with the reflection\nthat, at least, his wife would teach the dwarf something of her\nlanguage, which, by the way, he himself was practising assiduously under\nthe tuition of Juanna and Soa.\n\nAt noon the party adjourned to the temple, escorted by a bevy of priests\nand soldiers, for in obedience to Juanna's commands the feast was to\nbe celebrated in the daytime and not at night. As before, the vast\namphitheatre was crowded with thousands of human beings, but there was a\ndifference in the arrangements.\n\nJuanna and Otter had declined to occupy their lofty thrones, and sat\nin chairs at the feet of the huge and hideous stone idol, almost on\nthe edge of the pool, Nam alone standing before them, while Leonard,\nFrancisco, and the Settlement men ranged themselves on either side. The\nday was cold and miserable, and snow fell from time to time in large\nflakes from an ashen sky.\n\nPresently Nam addressed the multitude.\n\n\"People of the Mist,\" he cried, \"ye are gathered here to celebrate the\nfeast of Jal, according to ancient custom, but the gods have come\nback to you, as ye know, and the gods in their wisdom have changed the\ncustom. Fifty women were prepared for the sacrifice; this morning they\nrose rejoicing, deeming that they were destined to the Snake, but now\ntheir joy is turned to sorrow, since the gods will not accept them,\nhaving chosen a new offering for themselves. Let it be brought forward.\"\n\nAt his word lads appeared from behind the idol, driving two lean bulls,\nand with them a pair of he-goats.\n\nWhether by accident or design, they drove them so unskilfully that the\nanimals blundered hither and thither over the rocky platform till they\nwere finally despatched with blows from clubs and axes--that is, except\none goat, which, escaping its pursuers, rushed down the amphitheatre and\nscrambled from seat to seat among the audience, uttering a succession of\nterrified \"baa's.\" Indeed the scene was so comic that even that sombre\nand silent people began to laugh, accustomed as they were on these\noccasions to the hideous and impressive ceremonial of the midnight\nsacrifice of so many human beings.\n\nThe ancient feast was a fiasco; this was a fact which could not be\nconcealed.\n\n\"Begone, ye People of the Mist,\" said Nam presently, pointing to the\ndead animals. \"The sacrifice is sacrificed, the festival of Jal is\ndone. May the Mother plead with the Snake that the sun may shine and\nfruitfulness bless the land!\"\n\nNow scarcely ten minutes had elapsed since the beginning of the\nceremony, which in the ordinary course of events lasted through the\ngreater part of the night, for it was the custom to slaughter\neach victim singly and with appropriate solemnities. A murmur of\ndisapprobation arose from the far end of the amphitheatre, that swelled\ngradually to a roar. The people had been thankful to accept Juanna's\nmessage of peace, but, brutalised as they were by the continual sight\nof bloodshed, they were not willing to dispense with their carnivals\nof human sacrifice. A Roman audience gathered to witness a gladiatorial\nshow, to find themselves treated instead to a donkey-race and a\ncock-fight, could scarcely have shown more fury.\n\n\"Bring out the women! Let the victims be offered up to Jal as of old,\"\nthe multitude yelled in their rage, and ten minutes or more elapsed\nbefore they could be quieted.\n\nThen Nam addressed them cunningly.\n\n\"People of the Mist,\" he said, \"the gods have given us a new law, a law\nof the sacrifice of oxen and goats in the place of men and maids, and ye\nyourselves have welcomed that law. No longer shall the blood of victims\nflow to Jal beneath the white rays of the moon while the chant of his\nservants goes up to heaven. Nay, henceforth this holy place must be a\nshambles for the kine. So be it, my children; in my old age I hear the\ngods speaking in an altered voice and I obey them. It is nothing to\nme who am about to die, yet I tell you that rather would I myself be\nstretched upon the ancient stone than see the worship of our forefathers\nthus turned into a mockery. The sacrifice is sacrificed: now may the\nMaid intercede with the Snake that plenty may bless the land.\" And he\nsmiled satirically and turned away.\n\nThose of the audience who were near enough to hear his words cried them\nout to the ranks behind them, and when all understood there followed a\nscene of most indescribable tumult.\n\n\"Blood, give us blood!\" roared the populace, their fierce faces alight\nwith rage. \"Shall we be mocked with the sacrifice of goats? Offer up the\nservants of the false gods. Give us blood! Lead forth the victims!\"\n\nIn the midst of this uproar Juanna, clad in her white robes and with the\nred stone bound upon her brow, rose from her seat to speak.\n\n\"Silence!\" cried Nam, \"hear the voice of Aca;\" and by degrees the\nshouting died away, and she spoke.\n\n\"Do ye dare thus to offer outrages to the gods?\" she cried. \"Be warned\nlest we bring death and famine upon you all. Men shall be offered up to\nus no more. I have spoken.\"\n\nFor a while there was silence, then the clamour broke out with redoubled\nviolence, and a portion of the multitude made a rush round the edge of\nthe pool towards the rock platform, which was repelled by the soldiers\nin a very half-hearted way.\n\n\"Now,\" said Olfan, \"I think that these will do well to be going,\" and\nhe pointed to Leonard, Francisco, and the Settlement men. \"Doubtless the\ngods can defend themselves, but if the others do not fly this is sure,\nthat presently they will be torn to pieces.\"\n\n\"Let us all go,\" said Juanna, whose nerve began to fail her; and suiting\nthe action to the word she led the way towards the rock tunnel, followed\nby the others.\n\nThey were not allowed to reach it unmolested, however, for a number of\nthe crowd, headed, as Leonard noticed, by two priests, forced their way\nthrough the cordon of guards and became mixed with the rear of their\nlittle party, the members of which they threatened and struck at\nsavagely. This happened just as they were entering the mouth of the\ntunnel, behind the statue where the gloom was great.\n\nThis tunnel was protected by a door, which, so soon as they thought that\nall had passed, Olfan and Leonard made haste to close, leaving the mob\nhowling without. Then they pressed on to the palace, which they reached\nin safety, Olfan remaining behind, however, to watch the movements of\nthe mob.\n\n\"Oh! why would not you suffer them to sacrifice according to their\nwicked custom, Shepherdess?\" said Otter. \"What does it matter if they\nkill each other? So shall there be fewer of them. Now the end of it must\nbe that the devils will find us out and murder us.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Francisco, \"the senora was right. Let us trust in\nProvidence and keep ourselves clean from such iniquity.\"\n\nAs he spoke the roars of wrath in the distance changed to a shout of\ntriumph followed by silence.\n\n\"What is that?\" said Juanna faintly. At this moment Olfan pushed the\ncurtains aside and entered, and his face was heavy.\n\n\"Speak, Olfan,\" she said.\n\n\"The people sacrifice as of old, Queen,\" he answered. \"All of us did not\npass the gate; two of your black servants were mixed up with the crowd\nand left, and now they offer them to Jal, and others with them.\"\n\nLeonard ran to the yard and counted the Settlement men, who were huddled\ntogether in their fear, staring towards the temple through the bars of\nthe gate. Two were missing.\n\nAs he returned he met Olfan coming out.\n\n\"Where is he going?\" he asked of Juanna.\n\n\"To guard the gates. He says that he cannot be sure of the soldiers. Is\nit true about the Settlement men?\"\n\n\"Alas! yes. Two are gone.\"\n\nShe hid her face in her hands and shuddered.\n\n\"Poor creatures!\" she said presently in a hoarse voice. \"Why did we\never bring them here? Oh! Leonard, is there no escape from this land of\ndemons?\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" he answered; then added, \"Come, Juanna, do not give way.\nThings look so bad that they are sure to mend.\"\n\n\"There is need of it,\" she sobbed.\n\nAll that evening and night they watched, hourly expecting to be attacked\nand dragged forth to sacrifice, but no attack was made. Indeed, on\nthe morrow they learnt from Olfan that the people had dispersed after\nsacrificing about a score of human beings, and that quiet reigned in the\ncity.\n\nNow began the most dreadful of their trials, and the longest, for it\nendured five whole weeks. As has been said, the climate of these\nvast upland plains, backed by snow-clad mountains, that are the\ndwelling-place of the People of the Mist, is cold during the winter\nmonths to the verge of severity. But at a certain period of a year,\nalmost invariably within a day or two of the celebration of the feast\nof Jal, the mists and frost vanish and warm weather sets in with bright\nsunshine.\n\nThis is the season of the sowing of crops, and upon the climatic\nconditions of the few following weeks depends the yield of the harvest.\nShould the spring be delayed even a week or two, a short crop would\ncertainly result, but if its arrival is postponed for a month, it means\nsomething like a famine during the following winter. For although this\npeople dwell on high lands they cultivate the same sorts of grain which\nare common in these latitudes, namely maize and sundry varieties of\nKaffir corn, having no knowledge of wheat and the other hardy cereals.\nTherefore, it is all important to them that the corn should have a fair\nstart, for if the autumn frosts catch it before it is fit to harvest the\ngreat proportion of the crop turns black and is rendered useless.\n\nThese agricultural details had no small bearing upon the fate of our\nadventurers. The feast of Jal was celebrated in order to secure a\ngood seed-bed and springing time for the grain. Juanna and Otter had\nabolished the hideous ceremonies of that feast, and the People of the\nMist watched for the results with a gloomy and superstitious eye. If the\nseason proved more than ordinarily good, all might go well, but if it\nchanced to be bad----!\n\nAnd, as was to be expected, seeing how much depended upon it, this\nspring proved the very worst which any living man could remember in that\ncountry. Day after day the face of the sun was hidden with mists that\nonly yielded to the bitter winds which blew from the mountains at night,\nso that when the spring should have been a month old, the temperature\nwas still that of mid-winter and the corn would not start at all.\n\nLeonard and Juanna soon discovered what this meant for them, and never\nwas the aspect of weather more anxiously scanned than by these two from\nday to day. In vain; every morning the blanket of cold mist fell like a\ncloud, blotting out the background of the mountains, and every night the\nbiting wind swept down upon them from the fields of snow, chilling them\nto the marrow.\n\nThis state of things--wretched enough it itself--was only one of many\nmiseries which afflicted them. Otter and Juanna were still treated\nas gods indeed, and considerable respect was shown to Leonard and\nFrancisco, that is, within the walls of the palace. But if, wearied with\nthe monotony of their life, they went out, which they did twice only\nduring these five dreadful weeks, matters were different. Then they\nfound themselves followed by a mob of men, women, and children, who\nglared at them ferociously and cursed them aloud, asking what they had\ntheir gods had done with the sunshine.\n\nOn the second occasion indeed they were forced to fly for their lives,\nand after this they gave up making the attempt to walk abroad, and sat\nin the palace with Juanna and Otter, who of course never dared to leave\nit.\n\nIt was a terrible life; there was nothing to do, nothing to read, and\nonly anxieties to think on. The greater part of the day Leonard and\nJuanna occupied in talking, for practice, in the language of the People\nof the Mist. When their conversation was exhausted they told each other\ntales of their adventures in past years, or even invented stories like\nchildren and prisoners; indeed they were prisoners--prisoners, as they\nfeared, under sentence of death.\n\nThey grew to know each other very well during those five weeks, so well\nindeed that each could almost guess the other's thoughts. But no tender\nword ever passed their lips. On this subject, whatever their hearts\nmight feel, their tongues were sealed, and in their curious perversity\nthe chief object of each was to disguise the truth from the other.\nMoreover, Leonard never for one moment forgot that Juanna was his ward,\na fact that in itself would have sufficed to cause him to conceal any\ntender emotions he might have felt towards her.\n\nSo they lived side by side, lovers at heart, yet talking and acting as\nbrother and sister might, and through it all were still happy after a\nfashion because they were together.\n\nBut Soa was not happy. She felt that her mistress no longer trusted her,\nand was at no loss to guess the cause. Day by day she stood behind them\nlike a mummy at an Egyptian feast, and watched Leonard with ever-growing\njealousy.\n\nFrancisco for his part did not attempt to conceal his fears. He was\ncertain that they were about to perish and sought consolation in the\nconstant practice of religion, which was edifying but scarcely improved\nhim as a companion. As for Otter, he also believed that the hour of\ndeath was nigh, but being a fatalist this did not trouble him much. On\nthe contrary, in spite of Leonard's remonstrances he began to live hard,\nbetaking himself freely to the beer-pot. When Leonard remonstrated with\nhim he turned somewhat sulky.\n\n\"To-day I am a god, Baas,\" he answered, \"to-morrow I may be carrion.\nWhile I am a god, let me drink and be merry. All my days also women\nhave cursed me because I am ugly, but now my wife holds me great and\nbeautiful. What is the good of thinking and looking sad? The end will\ncome soon enough. Already Nam sharpens the knife for our hearts. Come\nand be merry with me, Baas, if the Shepherdess will let you.\"\n\n\"Do you take me for a pig like yourself?\" said Leonard angrily. \"Well,\ngo your own way, foolish that you are, but beware of the beer and the\nspirits. Now you are beginning to know this language, and when you are\ndrunk you talk, and do you think that there are no spies here? That\ngirl, Saga, is great-niece to Nam, and you are besotted with her. Be\ncareful lest you bring us all to death.\"\n\n\"Thither we shall come any way, so let us laugh before we weep, Baas,\"\nOtter replied sullenly. \"Must I then sit here and do nothing till I\ndie?\"\n\nLeonard shrugged his shoulders and went. He could not blame the dwarf,\nwho after all was a savage and looked at things as a savage would,\nnotwithstanding Francisco's earnest efforts to convert him. He sometimes\nwished, so deep was his depression, that he also was a savage and could\ndo likewise.\n\nBut the worst of their trials is still to be told. For the first week\nthe Settlement men stayed in the palace, their fears and the rumours\nthat had reached them of the terrible fate of their two lost companions\nkeeping them quiet. By degrees, however, this dread wore off, and one\nafternoon, wearied with the sameness of their life, they yielded to\nthe solicitations of some men who spoke to them through the bars of\nthe great gate, and went out in a body without obtaining Leonard's\npermission. That night they returned drunk--at least ten of them\ndead; the other two were missing. When they were sober again, Leonard\nquestioned them as to the whereabouts of their companions, but they\ncould give him no satisfactory information. They had been into various\nhouses in the city, they said, where the people had plied them with\nbeer, and they remembered nothing more.\n\nThese two men never reappeared, but the rest of them, now thoroughly\nfrightened, obeyed Leonard's orders and stayed in the palace, although\nthe decoy men still came frequently to the gates and called them. They\npassed the days in wandering about and drinking to drown their fears,\nand the nights huddled together for protection from an unseen foe, more\nterrible and craftier than the leopard of their native rocks. But these\nprecautions were all in vain.\n\nOne morning, hearing a tumult among them, Leonard went to see what was\nthe matter. Three more of the Settlement men were missing; they had\nvanished in the night, none could say how, vanished though the doors\nwere barred and guarded. There where they had slept lay their guns and\nlittle possessions, but the men were gone, leaving no trace. When he\nwas consulted Olfan looked very grave, but could throw no light upon the\nmystery beyond suggesting that there were many secret passages in the\npalace, of which the openings were known only to the priests, and that\npossibly the men had been let down them--terrible information enough for\npeople in their position.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SETTLEMENT MEN\n\nOn that day of the vanishing of the three Settlement men, Nam paid his\nweekly visit to \"do honour to the gods,\" and Leonard, who by this time\ncould make himself understood in the tongue of the People of the Mist,\nattacked him as to the whereabouts of their lost servants.\n\nWhen he had finished, the priest answered with a cruel smile that\nhe knew nothing of the matter. \"Doubtless,\" he said, \"the gods had\ninformation as to the fate of their own servants--it was not for him to\nseek those whom the gods had chosen to put away.\"\n\nThen turning the subject, he went on to ask when it would please the\nMother to intercede with the Snake that he might cause the sun to shine\nand the corn to spring, for the people murmured, fearing a famine in the\nland.\n\nOf course Juanna was able to give no satisfactory answer to the priest's\nquestions, and after this the quarters of the Settlement men were\nchanged, and for a few days the survivors slept in safety. On the third\nnight, however, two more of them were taken in the same mysterious\nmanner, and one of those who remained swore that, hearing something\nstir, he woke and saw the floor open and a vision of great arms dragging\nhis sleeping companions through the hole in it, which closed again\ninstantly. Leonard hurried to the spot and made a thorough examination\nof the stone blocks of the pavement, but could find no crack in them.\nAnd yet, if the man had dreamed, how was the mystery to be explained?\n\nAfter this, with the exception of Otter, who, sure of the fate that\nawaited them, took little heed of how or when it might fall, none of\nthe party could even sleep because of their terror of the unseen foe who\nstruck in silence and in darkness, dragging the victim to some unknown\nawful end. Leonard and Francisco took it in turns to watch each other's\nslumbers, laying themselves to rest outside the curtain of Juanna's\nroom. As for the survivors of the Settlement men, their state can\nscarcely be described. They followed Leonard about, upbraiding him\nbitterly for leading them into this evil land and cursing the hour when\nfirst they had seen his face. It would have been better, they said,\nthat he should have left them to their fate in the slave camp than have\nbrought them here to die thus; the Yellow Devil was at least a man, but\nthese people were sorcerers and lost spirits in human shape.\n\nNor did the horror stop here, for at last the headman Peter, a man whom\nthey all liked and respected, went mad with fear and ran to and fro in\nthe palace yard while the guards and women watched him with curious eyes\nas he shrieked out curses upon Juanna and Leonard. This shocking scene\ncontinued for some hours, for his companions would not interfere with\nhim, vowing that he was possessed by a spirit, till at length he put a\nperiod to it by suddenly committing suicide. In vain did Leonard caution\nthe survivors to keep their heads and watch at night. They flew to the\nbeer which was supplied to them in plenty, and drank till they were\ninsensible. And still one by one they vanished mysteriously, till at\nlength all were gone.\n\nNever might Leonard forget his feelings when one day at dawn, in the\nfifth week of their incarceration, he hurried as usual to the chamber\nwhere the last two of the unfortunate men were accustomed to sleep, and\nfound them not. There were their blankets, there was the place where\nthey had been, and on it, laid carefully in the form of a St. Andrew's\ncross by some unknown hand, shone two huge sacrificial knives such as\nthe priests wore at their girdles.\n\nSick and faint with fear he staggered back to the throne-room.\n\n\"Oh! what is it now?\" said Juanna, who, early as it was, had risen\nalready, looking at him with terrified eyes and trembling lips.\n\n\"Only this,\" he answered hoarsely; \"the last two have been taken, and\nhere is what was left in the place of them,\" and he cast down the knives\non to the pavement.\n\nThen at last Juanna gave way. \"Oh! Leonard, Leonard,\" she said, weeping\nbitterly, \"they were my father's servants whom I have known since I was\na child, and I have brought them to this cruel end. Cannot you think of\nany way of getting out of this place? If not, I shall die of fear. I can\nsleep no more. I feel that I am watched at night, though I cannot tell\nby whom. Last night I thought that I heard some one moving near the\ncurtain where you and Francisco lie, though Soa declares that it is\nfancy.\"\n\n\"It is impossible,\" said Leonard; \"Francisco was on guard. Ah! here he\ncomes.\"\n\nAs he spoke Francisco entered the room with consternation written on his\nface.\n\n\"Outram,\" he gasped, \"some one must have been in the throne chamber\nwhere we slept last night. All the rifles have gone, ours and those of\nthe Settlement men also.\"\n\n\"Great heavens!\" said Leonard, \"but you were watching.\"\n\n\"I suppose that I must have dozed for a few moments,\" answered the\npriest; \"it is awful, awful; they are gone and we are weaponless.\"\n\n\"Oh! can we not escape?\" moaned Juanna.\n\n\"There is no hope of it,\" answered Leonard gloomily. \"We are friendless\nhere except for Olfan, and he has little real power, for the priests\nhave tampered with the captains and the soldiers who fear them. How\ncan we get out of this city? And if we got out what would become of us,\nunarmed and alone? All that we can do is to keep heart and hope for the\nbest. Certainly they are right who declare that no good comes of seeking\nafter treasure; though I believe that we shall live to win it yet,\" he\nadded.\n\n\"What! Deliverer,\" said a satirical voice behind him, \"do you still\ndesire the red stones, who whose heart's blood shall soon redden a\ncertain stone yonder? Truly the greed of the white man is great.\"\n\nLeonard looked round. It was Soa who spoke, Soa who had been listening\nto their talk, and she was glaring at him with an expression of intense\nhate in her sullen eyes. A thought came into his mind. \"Was it not\npossible that this woman had something to do with their misfortunes? How\ncame it about that the others were taken while she was left?\"\n\n\"Who gave you leave, Soa,\" he said, looking her fixedly in the face, \"to\nhearken to our words and thrust yourself into our talk?\"\n\n\"You have been glad enough of my counsels hitherto, White Man,\" she\nanswered furiously. \"Who told you the tale of this people? And who led\nyou to their land? Was it I or another?\"\n\n\"You, I regret to say,\" said Leonard coolly.\n\n\"Yes, White Man, I led you here that you might steal the treasure of my\npeople like a thief. I did it because the Shepherdess my mistress forced\nme to the deed, and in those days her will was my law. For her and you\nI came here to my death, and what has been my reward? I am put away from\nher, she has no kind word for me now; you are about her always, you hold\nher counsel, but to me her mind is as a shut door that I can no longer\nopen. Ay! you have poisoned her against me, you and that black swine\nwhom they call a god.\n\n\"Moreover, because she has learned to love you, white thief, wanderer\nwithout a kraal as you are, at your bidding she has also learned to hate\nme. Beware, White Man, I am of this people, and you know their temper,\nit is not gentle; when they hate they find a means to be revenged,\" and\nshe ceased, gasping with rage.\n\nIndeed, at that moment Soa would have made no bad model for a statue of\none of the furies of Greek mythology.\n\nThen Juanna attempted to interfere, but Leonard waved her back.\n\n\"So,\" he said, \"as I thought, you are at the bottom of all this\nbusiness. Perhaps you will not mind telling us what has become of your\nfriends, the Settlement men, or, if you feel a delicacy on that point,\nhow it is that you have escaped while they have vanished.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of the Settlement men,\" answered the Fury, \"except that\nthey have been taken and sacrificed as was their meed, and as yet I have\nlifted no hand and said no word against you, though a breath from me\nwould have swept you all to doom. Hitherto I have been spared for the\nsame reason that you and Bald-pate yonder have been spared--because we\nare the body-servants of the false gods, and are reserved to perish with\nthem when the lie is discovered; or perhaps to live awhile, set in cages\nin the market-place, to be mocked by the passers-by and to serve as a\nwarning to any whose monkey hearts should dare to plot sacrilege against\nthe divinity of Aca and Jal.\n\n\"Now, Shepherdess, take your choice. As you know well, I have loved\nyou from a babe and I love you yet, though you have scorned me for this\nman's sake. Take your choice, I say; cling to me and trust me, giving\nthe Deliverer to the priests, and I will save you. Cling to him, and\nI will bring shame and death upon you all, for my love shall turn to\nhate.\"\n\nAt this juncture Leonard quietly drew his revolver, though at the time\nnobody noticed it except Francisco. Indeed by now Juanna was almost as\nangry as Soa herself.\n\n\"How dare you speak to me thus?\" she said, stamping her foot, \"you whom\nfrom a child I have thought good and have trusted. What do you say? That\nI must give him who saved me from death over to death, in order that I\nmay buy back your love and protect myself. You evil woman, I tell you\nthat first I will die as I would have died yonder in the slave camp,\"\nand she ceased, for her indignation was too great to allow her to say\nmore.\n\n\"So be it, Shepherdess,\" said Soa solemnly, \"I hear you. It was to be\nexpected that you would prefer him whom you love to her who loves you.\nYet, Shepherdess, was it not I after all who saved you yonder in the\nslave camp? Doubtless I dream, but it seems to me that when those men\nwho are dead deserted you, running this way and that in their fear--and,\nShepherdess, it is for this that I am glad they are dead, and lifted\nno hand to save them--I followed you alone. It seems to me that, having\nfollowed you far till I could walk no more for hunger and weariness, I\nused my wit and bribed a certain white man, of the sort who would sell\ntheir sisters and blaspheme their mothers for a reward, to attempt your\nrescue.\n\n\"I bribed him with a gem of great price--had there been ten of them,\nthat gem would have bought them all--and with the gem I told him the\nsecret of the treasure which is here. He took the bribe, and being brave\nand desperate, he drew you out of the clutches of the Yellow Devil,\nthough in that matter also I had some part; and then you loved him.\nAh! could I have foreseen it, Shepherdess, I had left you to die in the\nslave camp, for then you had died loving me who now hate me and cast me\noff for the sake of this white thief.\"\n\nLeonard could bear it no longer, and in the interests of their common\nsafety he came to a desperate resolve. With an exclamation, he lifted\nthe pistol and covered Soa. Both Francisco and Juanna saw the act and\nsprang to him, the latter exclaiming, \"Oh! what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I propose to kill this woman before she kills us, that is all,\" he\nanswered coldly.\n\n\"No! no!\" cried Juanna, \"she has been faithful to me for many years. I\ncannot see her shot.\"\n\n\"Let the butcher do his work,\" mocked Soa; \"it shall avail him little.\nDoubtless he is angry because I have spoken the truth about him,\" and\nshe folded her arms upon her breast, awaiting the bullet.\n\n\"What is to be done?\" said Leonard desperately. \"If I do not shoot her,\nshe will certainly betray us.\"\n\n\"Then let her betray,\" said Francisco; \"it is written that you shall do\nno murder.\"\n\n\"If you fear to shoot a woman, send for your black dog, White Man,\"\nmocked Soa. \"He would have killed my father, and doubtless this task\nalso will be to his liking.\"\n\n\"I can't do it. Get a rope and tie her up, Francisco,\" said Leonard.\n\"We must watch her day and night; it will be a pleasant addition to\nour occupations. After all it is only one more risk, which is no great\nmatter among so many. I fancy the game is about played out, anyhow.\"\n\nFrancisco went for the rope and presently returned accompanied by Otter.\nA month of furious dissipation had left its mark even on the dwarf's\niron frame. His bright black eyes were bloodshot and unsteady, his hand\nshook, and he did not walk altogether straight.\n\n\"You have been drinking again, you sot,\" said Leonard. \"Go back to your\ndrink; we are in sorrow here and want no drunkards in our company. Now\nthen, Francisco, give me that rope.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, I have been drinking,\" answered the dwarf humbly; \"it is\nwell to drink before one dies, since we may not drink afterwards and I\nthink that the hour of death is at hand. Oh! Shepherdess of the\nheavens, they said down yonder at the Settlement that you were a great\nrain-maker: now if you can make the rain to fall, can you not make the\nsun to shine? Wind and water are all very well, but we have too much of\nthem here.\"\n\n\"Hearken,\" said Leonard, \"while you revelled, the last of Mavoom's men\nvanished, and these are left in their place,\" and he pointed to the\nknives.\n\n\"Is it so, Baas?\" answered Otter with a hiccough. \"Well, they were a\npoor lot, and we shall not miss them. And yet I wish I were a man again\nand had my hands on the throat of that wizard Nam. _Wow!_ but I would\nsqueeze it.\"\n\n\"It is your throat that will be squeezed soon, Otter,\" said Leonard.\n\"Look here, god or no god, get you sober or I will beat you.\"\n\n\"I am sober, Baas, I am indeed. Last night I was drunk, to-day nothing\nis left but a pain here,\" and he tapped his great head. \"Why are you\ntying up that old cow Soa, Baas?\"\n\n\"Because she threatens to use her horns, Otter. She says that she will\nbetray us all.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Baas! Well, it is in my mind that she has betrayed us already.\nWhy do you not kill her and have done?\"\n\n\"Because the Shepherdess here will have none of it,\" answered Leonard;\n\"also I do not like the task.\"\n\n\"I will kill her if you wish, Baas,\" said Otter with another hiccough.\n\"She is wicked, let her die.\"\n\n\"I have told you that the Shepherdess will have none of it. Listen: we\nmust watch this woman; we will guard her to-day and you must take your\nturn to-night--it will keep you from your drink.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, I will watch, though it would be better to kill her at once,\nfor thus we should be spared trouble.\"\n\nThen they bound Soa securely and set her in a corner of the throne\nchamber, and all that day Leonard and Francisco mounted guard over her\nalternately. She made no resistance and said nothing; indeed it seemed\nas if a certain lassitude had followed her outbreak of rage, for she\nleaned her head back and slept, or made pretence to sleep.\n\nThe day passed uneventfully. Olfan visited them as usual, and told\nthem that the excitement grew in the city. Indeed the unprecedented\nprolongation of the cold weather was driving the people into a state of\nsuperstitious fury that must soon express itself in violence of one\nform or another, and the priests were doing everything in their power to\nfoment the trouble. No immediate danger was to be apprehended, however.\n\nAfter sundown Leonard and Francisco went out into the courtyard to\ninspect the weather according to their custom. There was no sign of a\nchange; the wind blew as bitterly as ever from the mountains, the sky\nwas ashen, and the stars seemed far off and cold.\n\n\"Will it never break?\" said Leonard with a sigh, and re-entered the\npalace, followed by Francisco.\n\nThen, having solemnly cautioned Otter to keep a strict guard over Soa,\nthey wrapped themselves up in their blankets in order to get some rest,\nwhich both of them needed sadly. Juanna had retired already, laying\nherself to sleep immediately on the other side of the curtain, for\nshe feared to be alone; indeed they could see the tips of her fingers\nappearing beneath the bottom of the curtain.\n\nVery soon they were asleep, for even terror must yield at last to the\nnecessities of rest, and a dense silence reigned over the palace, broken\nonly by the tramp of the sentries without.\n\nOnce Leonard opened his eyes, hearing something move, and instantly\nstretched out his hand to assure himself of Juanna's safety. She was\nthere, for in her sleep her fingers closed instinctively upon his own.\nThen he turned round and saw what had disturbed him. In the doorway of\nthe chamber stood the bride of the Snake, Saga, a lighted torch in one\nhand and a gourd in the other, and very picturesque that handsome\nyoung woman looked with her noble figure illumined by the glare of the\ntorchlight.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said Leonard.\n\n\"It is all right, Baas,\" answered Otter; \"the old woman here is as safe\nas a stone statue yonder and quite as quiet. Saga brings me some water,\nthat is all. I bade her do so because of the fire that rages inside me\nand the pain in my head. Fear not, Baas, I do not drink beer when I am\non guard.\"\n\n\"Beer or water, I wish you would keep your wife at a distance,\" answered\nLeonard; \"come, tell her to be off.\"\n\nThen he looked at his watch, the hands of which he could just\ndistinguish by the distant glare of the torch, and went to sleep again.\nThis took place at ten minutes past eleven. When he awoke again dawn was\nbreaking and Otter was calling to him in a loud, hoarse voice.\n\n\"Baas,\" he said, \"come here, Baas.\"\n\nLeonard jumped up and ran to him, to find the dwarf on his feet and\nstaring vacantly at the wall against which Soa had been sitting. She was\ngone, but there on the floor lay the ropes with which she had been tied.\n\nLeonard sprang at Otter and seized him by the shoulders.\n\n\"Wretched man!\" he cried, \"you have been sleeping, and now she has\nescaped and we are lost.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, I have been sleeping. Kill me if you wish, for I deserve it.\nAnd yet, Baas, never was I more wide-awake in my life until I drank that\nwater. I am not wont to sleep on guard, Baas.\"\n\n\"Otter,\" said Leonard, \"that wife of yours has drugged you.\"\n\n\"It may be so, Baas. At least the woman has gone, and, say, whither has\nshe gone?\"\n\n\"To Nam, her father,\" answered Leonard.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nFATHER AND DAUGHTER\n\nWhile Leonard and Otter spoke thus in their amazement, had they but\nknown it, a still more interesting conversation was being carried on\nsome three hundred yards away. Its scene was a secret chamber hollowed\nin the thickness of the temple wall, and the _dramatis personae_\nconsisted of Nam, the high priest, Soa, Juanna's servant, and Saga, wife\nof the Snake.\n\nNam was an early riser, perhaps because his conscience would not allow\nhim to sleep, or because on this occasion he had business of importance\nto attend to. At any rate, on the morning in question, long before\nthe break of dawn, he was seated in his little room alone, musing; and\nindeed his thoughts gave him much food for reflection. As has been said,\nhe was a very aged man, and whatever may have been his faults, at\nleast he was earnestly desirous of carrying on the worship of the gods\naccording to the strict letter of the customs which had descended to him\nfrom his forefathers, and which he himself had followed all his life.\nIn truth, from long consideration of them, their attributes, and the\ntraditions concerning them, Nam had come to believe in the actual\nexistence of these gods, although the belief was a qualified one and\nsomewhat half-hearted. Or, to put it less strongly, he had never allowed\nhis mind to entertain active doubt of the spiritual beings whose\nearthly worship was so powerful a factor in his own material rule and\nprosperity, and in that of his class. In its issues this half-faith of\nhis had been sufficiently real to induce him to accept Otter and Juanna\nwhen they arrived mysteriously in the land.\n\nIt had been prophesied that they should arrive thus--that was a\nfact; and their outward appearance exactly fitted every detail of the\nprophecy--that was another fact; and these two facts together seemed to\npoint to a conclusion so irresistible that, shrewd and experienced as\nhe was, Nam, was unable to set it down to mere coincidence. Therefore\nin the first rush of his religious enthusiasm he had accorded a hearty\nwelcome to the incarnations of the divinities whom for some eighty years\nhe had worshipped as powers spiritual.\n\nBut though pious zeal had much to do with this action, as Olfan informed\nJuanna, it was not devoid of worldly motives. He desired the glory of\nbeing the discoverer of the gods, he desired also the consolidation of\nthe rule which his cruelties had shaken, that must result from their\nadvent.\n\nAll this was well enough, but he had never even dreamed that the first\nstep of these new-born divinities would be to discard the ancient\nceremonial without which his office would become a sinecure and his\npower a myth, and even to declare an active hostility against himself.\n\nWere they or were they not gods? This was the question that exercised\nhis mind. If there was truth in prophesies they should be gods. On the\nother hand he could discover nothing particularly divine about their\npersons, characters, or attributes--that is to say, nothing sufficiently\ndivine to deceive Nam himself, whatever impression they produced upon\nthe vulgar. Thus Juanna might be no more than a very beautiful woman\nwhite in colour, and Otter only what he knew him to be through his\nspies, a somewhat dissolute dwarf.\n\nThat they had no great power was also evident, seeing that he, Nam,\nwithout incurring the heavenly vengeance, had been able to abstract,\nand afterwards to sacrifice comfortably, the greater number of their\nservants. Another thing which pleaded against their celestial origin\nwas that so far, instead of peace and prosperity blessing the land as\nit should have done immediately on their arrival, the present season\nwas proving itself the worst on record, and the country was face to face\nwith a prospect of famine in the ensuing winter.\n\nAnd yet, if they were not gods, who were they? Would any human beings\nin their senses venture among such people as the Children of the Mist,\nmerely to play off a huge practical joke of which the finale was likely\nto be so serious to themselves? The idea was preposterous, since they\nhad nothing to gain by so doing, for Nam, it may be observed, was\nignorant of the value of rubies, which to him were only emblems employed\nin their symbolical ceremonies. Think as he would, he could come to no\ndefinite conclusion. One thing was clear, however, that it was now very\nmuch to his interest to demonstrate their non-celestial origin, though\nto do so would be to stultify himself and to prove that his judgment was\nnot infallible. Otherwise, did the \"gods\" succeed in establishing their\npower, he and his authority seemed likely to come to a sudden end in\nthe jaws of that monster, which his order had fostered for so many\ngenerations.\n\nThus reflected Nam in perplexity of soul, wishing to himself the while\nthat he had retired from his office before he was called upon to face\nquestions so difficult and so dangerous.\n\n\"I must be patient,\" he muttered to himself at last; \"time will show the\ntruth, or, if the weather does not change, the people will settle the\nmatter for me.\"\n\nAs it chanced he had not long to wait, for just then there was a knock\nupon his door.\n\n\"Enter,\" he said, arranging his goat-skin robe about his broad\nshoulders.\n\nA priest came in bearing a torch, for there was no window to the\nchamber, and after him two women.\n\n\"Who is this?\" said Nam, pointing to the second of the women.\n\n\"This is she who is servant to Aca, Father,\" answered the priest.\n\n\"How comes she here?\" said Nam again. \"I gave no orders that she should\nbe taken.\"\n\n\"She comes of her own free will, Father, having somewhat to say to you.\"\n\n\"Fool, how can she speak to me when she does not know our tongue? But\nof her presently; take her aside and watch her. Now, Saga, your report.\nFirst, what of the weather?\"\n\n\"It is grey and pitiless, father. The mist is dense and no sun can be\nseen.\"\n\n\"I thought it, because of the cold,\" and he drew his robe closer round\nhim. \"A few more days of this----\" and he stopped, then went on. \"Tell\nme of Jal, your lord.\"\n\n\"Jal is as Jal was, merry and somewhat drunken. He speaks our language\nvery ill, yet when he was last in liquor he sang a song which told of\ndeeds that he, and he whom they name the Deliverer, had wrought together\ndown in the south, rescuing the goddess Aca from some who had taken her\ncaptive. At least, so I understood that song.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you understood it wrong,\" answered Nam. \"Say, niece, do you\nstill worship this god?\"\n\n\"I worship the god Jal, but the man, Dweller in the Waters, I hate,\" she\nsaid fiercely.\n\n\"Why, how is this? But two days gone you told me that you loved him, and\nthat there was no such god as this man, and no such man as this god.\"\n\n\"That was so, father, but since then he has thrust me aside, saying that\nI weary him, and courts a handmaid of mine own, and therefore I demand\nthe life of that handmaiden.\"\n\nNam smiled grimly. \"Perchance you demand the life of the god also?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied without hesitation, \"I would see him dead if it can\nbe brought about.\"\n\nAgain Nam smiled. \"Truly, niece, your temper is that of my sister, your\ngrandmother, who brought three men to sacrifice because she grew jealous\nof them. Well, well, these are strange times, and you may live to see\nyour desire satisfied by the death of the god. Now, what of that woman?\nHow comes she to be with you?\"\n\n\"She was bound by the order of Aca, father, and Jal was set to watch\nher; but I drugged Jal, and loosing her bonds I led her down the secret\nway, for she desires to speak to you.\"\n\n\"How can that be, niece? Can I then understand her language?\"\n\n\"Nay, father, but she understands ours. Had she been bred in the land\nshe could not speak it better.\"\n\nNam looked astonished, and going to the door he called to the priest\nwithout to lead in the stranger.\n\n\"You have words to say to me,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, lord, but not before these. That which I have to say is secret.\"\n\nNam hesitated.\n\n\"Have no fear, lord,\" said Soa, reading his thoughts. \"See, I am\nunarmed.\"\n\nThen he commanded the others to go, and when the door had closed behind\nthem, he looked at her inquiringly.\n\n\"Tell me, lord, who am I?\" asked Soa, throwing the wrapping from her\nhead and turning her face to the glare of the torchlight.\n\n\"How can I know who you are, wanderer? Yet, had I met you by chance, I\nshould have said that you were of our blood.\"\n\n\"That is so, lord, I am of your blood. Cast your mind back and think if\nyou can remember a certain daughter whom you loved many years ago, but\nwho through the workings of your foes was chosen to be a bride to the\nSnake,\" and she paused.\n\n\"Speak on,\" said Nam in a low voice.\n\n\"Perchance you can recall, lord, that, moved to it by love and pity, on\nthe night of the sacrifice you helped that daughter to escape the fangs\nof the Snake.\"\n\n\"I remember something of it,\" he replied cautiously; \"but tidings were\nbrought to me that this woman of whom you speak was overtaken by the\nvengeance of the god, and died on her journey.\"\n\n\"That is not so, lord. I am your daughter, and you are none other than\nmy father. I knew you when I first saw your face, though you did not\nknow me.\"\n\n\"Prove it, and beware how you lie,\" he said. \"Show me the secret sign,\nand whisper the hidden word into my ear.\"\n\nThen, glancing suspiciously behind her, Soa came to him, and made\nsome movements with her hands in the shadow of the table. Next bending\nforward, she whispered awhile into his ear. When she had finished, her\nfather looked up, and there were tears in his aged eyes.\n\n\"Welcome, daughter,\" he said. \"I thought that I was alone, and that none\nof my issue lived anywhere upon the earth. Welcome! Your life is forfeit\nto the Snake, but, forgetting my vows, I will protect you, ay, even at\nthe cost of my own.\"\n\nThen the two embraced each other with every sign of tenderness, a\nspectacle that would have struck anyone acquainted with their characters\nas both curious and interesting.\n\nPresently Nam left the chamber, and having dismissed the attendant\npriest and his great-niece, Saga, who were waiting outside, he returned\nand prayed his daughter to explain the reason of her presence in the\ntrain of Aca.\n\n\"First, you shall swear an oath to me, my father,\" said Soa, \"and if you\nswear it not, I will tell you no word of my story. You shall swear by\nthe blood of Aca that you will do nothing against the life of that Queen\nwith whom I journeyed hither. For the others, you may work your will\nupon them, but her you shall not harm.\"\n\n\"Why should I swear this, daughter?\" he asked.\n\n\"You shall swear it because I, whom you love, love her, and also because\nso you shall gain the greater honour.\"\n\n\"Who am I that I should lift my hand against the gods, daughter? I swear\nit by the blood of Aca, and if I break my oath, then may Jal deal with\nme as once he dealt with Aca.\"\n\nThen Soa went on freely, for she knew that this was a vow that could not\nbe broken. Beginning at its commencement, she told him all the story of\nher life since, forty years ago, she had fled from among the People of\nthe Mist, passing on rapidly, however, to that part of it which had to\ndo with the capture and rescue of Juanna from the slave-traders, and\nwith the promise that she had made to Leonard as the price of his\nassistance. This promise, she was careful to explain, she had not\nintended to fulfil until she was forced to do so by Juanna herself.\nThen she gave him a minute history of the object and details of their\nexpedition, down to her final quarrel with Leonard and her mistress on\nthe previous day.\n\nTo say that the old priest was thunderstruck at these extraordinary\nrevelations would be too little; he was overwhelmed--so overwhelmed that\nfor a while he could scarcely speak.\n\n\"It is fortunate for this jade of a mistress of yours, who dares to\nmake a mockery of our goddess that she may steal her wealth, that I have\nsworn to save her from harm, daughter,\" he gasped at length, \"else she\nhad died, and swiftly. At least, the others remain to me,\" and he sprang\nto his feet.\n\n\"Stay awhile, father,\" said Soa, catching his cloak, \"what is your\nplan?\"\n\n\"My plan? To drag them to the temple and denounce them. What else is\nthere to do?\"\n\n\"And thereby denounce yourself also, who proclaimed them gods. I think I\nhave a better.\"\n\n\"Tell it then, daughter.\"\n\n\"It is this. Do you pass in before the gods this day, speak humbly to\nthe gods, praying them to change the face of the heavens that the sun\nmay shine; telling them also that strange talk has come to your ears by\nthe mouth of Saga and the other women, of words that have been spoken\nby the god Jal, which would seem to show that he is no god, but that of\nthis you believe nothing as yet. Then say to them that if the face of\nthe heavens remains grey on the morrow, you will know that this talk is\ntrue, and that they will be brought to the temple, there to be judged\nand dealt with according to the finding of the people, who have heard\nthese things also.\"\n\n\"And what if the weather should change, daughter?\"\n\n\"It will not change yet awhile; but if that should chance, we must make\nanother plan.\"\n\n\"Just now I swore to you that I would not harm her whom you love, and\nyet, daughter, if she is proved to be a false goddess in the face of all\nthe multitude, how shall she escape harm, for then her end must be quick\nand terrible?\"\n\n\"She shall escape because she will not be there, father. You have seen\nthe white man with her--not the Deliverer, the other. Were that man\ndressed in the robes of Aca, and sat on high upon the head of the statue\nwhen the light is low, who should say that he was not Aca?\"\n\n\"Then you would give all the others to death, daughter?\"\n\n\"Nay, I would save the Deliverer alive, for a while at least.\"\n\n\"And wherefore? You are too subtle for me.\"\n\n\"For this reason, father; he loves her who is named Aca, and trusts to\nmarry her, to marry her fully according to the custom of his people:\ntherefore I would that he should see her given to another.\"\n\n\"To another! To whom then?\"\n\n\"To Olfan the king, who also loves her.\"\n\nNow Nam held up his hands in perplexity, saying:\n\n\"Oh! my daughter, be plain, I pray of you, for I cannot understand your\ncounsels. Were it not better to give to these people the red stones\nwhich they desire, and send them secretly from the land, saying that\nthey had vanished into the earth again, for so it seems to me we should\nbe rid of much shame and trouble?\"\n\n\"Listen, my father, and I will tell you. Were she whom I love to leave\nthis land, I should see her face no more, and this madness has come\nupon me that I cannot live without the sight of her. Also, how can these\npeople escape the dangers of the road? But four of them are left alive,\nand even were they without our borders, they must journey for three\nmonths before they come to any place where white men live, passing\nthrough swamps and deserts and tribes of wild men. This they could\nhardly do with arms such as those whereby the Deliverer slew the\npriests, and now their arms are gone, you alone know where, my father.\"\n\n\"The instruments of which you speak lie in the deep waters of the temple\npool, daughter, for there I caused them to be cast.\"\n\n\"Their arms are gone,\" said Soa, \"they are alone, here they must live or\ndie. Three of them I will give to death, and the fourth I would make the\nwife of the King, seeing that nothing better can be done for her. Let\nher be hidden awhile, and then let Olfan take her. As for the tale that\nwe shall tell of the matter to the ears of the people, doubtless time\nwill show it. I say that Olfan loves her and will buy her with a great\nprice, and the price which you must ask shall be that henceforth he\nobeys you in everything.\"\n\n\"The scheme is good, daughter; at the least, bearing my oath in mind, I\nhave none better, though were it not for my oath, either I should kill\nthem all or set them free. Yet who can say that it shall succeed? It is\nin the hands of fate, let it go as fate wills. And now follow me, that I\nmay place you where you shall dwell in comfort, then after we have eaten\nI will speak with these gods whom you have let loose upon us.\"\n\nThat morning passed heavily enough to the four wretched prisoners in\nthe palace. For some hours they sat together in the throne-room almost\nsilent, for they were crushed by misfortune and fear; the toils were\nclosing on them, and they knew it, nor could they lift a finger to save\nthemselves.\n\nFrancisco knelt and prayed, Leonard and Juanna sat hand in hand\nlistening to him, while Otter wandered to and fro like an unquiet\nspirit, cursing Soa, Saga, and all women in many languages and with a\nresource and vigour that struck his hearers as unparalleled. At length\nhe vanished through the curtains, to get drunk probably, Leonard\nreflected.\n\nHowever, the dwarf sought not drink, but vengeance. A few minutes\nlater, hearing screams in the courtyard, Leonard ran out to find himself\nwitness to a curious scene. There on the ground, surrounded by a group\nof other women, her companions, who were laughing at her discomfiture,\nlay the stately Saga, bride of the Snake. Over her stood her lord and\nmaster, the god Jal, his left hand twisted in her long hair, while with\nhis right, in which he grasped a leather thong, despite her screams and\nentreaties, he administered to her one of the soundest and, be it added,\nbest deserved thrashings that ever fell to the lot of erring woman.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" said Leonard.\n\n\"I am teaching this wife of mine that it is not well to drug a god,\nBaas,\" gasped Otter; then added with a final and most ferocious cut,\n\"There, get you gone, witch, and let me see your ugly face no more.\"\n\nThe woman rose and went, cursing and weeping, while the dwarf followed\nLeonard back into the throne-room.\n\n\"You have done it now, Otter,\" said Leonard. \"Well, it does not much\nmatter. I fancy she is gone for good, any way.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, she has gone, and she has gone sore,\" replied Otter with a\nfaint grin.\n\nAt that moment a messenger arrived announcing that Nam was without\nwaiting for an audience.\n\n\"Let him be admitted,\" said Juanna with a sigh, and seated herself on\none of the thrones, Otter clambering into the other.\n\nThey had scarcely taken their places when the curtains were thrown\nback and the ancient priest entered, attended by about a score of his\nfellows. He bowed himself humbly before Juanna and the dwarf and then\nspoke.\n\n\"Oh! ye gods,\" he said, \"I come in the name of the People of the Mist\nto take counsel with you. Why it is we do not know, but things have gone\namiss in the land: the sun does not shine as in past years before you\ncame to bless us, neither does the grain spring. Therefore your people\nare threatened with a famine, and they pray that you may comfort them\nout of the store of your wisdom.\"\n\n\"And if we have no comfort to give, Nam?\"\n\n\"Then, Queen, the people ask that you will be pleased to meet them\nto-morrow in the temple at the moon-rise, when the night is one hour\nold, that they may talk with you there through the mouth of me, your\nservant.\"\n\n\"And if we weary of your temple and will not come, Nam?\" asked Juanna.\n\n\"Then this is the command of the people, O Aca: that we bring you\nthither, and it is a command that may not be disobeyed,\" answered the\nhigh priest slowly.\n\n\"Beware, Nam,\" replied Juanna; \"strange things happen here that call for\nvengeance. Our servants pass away like shadows, and in their place we\nfind such weapons as you carry,\" and she pointed to the priests' knives.\n\"We will come to-morrow night at the rising of the moon, but again I say\nto you, beware, for now our mercy is but as a frayed rope, and it were\nwell for you all that the cord should not break.\"\n\n\"Ye know best whither your servants have wandered, O Aca,\" said the\npriest, stretching out his hands in deprecation, and speaking in a tone\nof which the humility did not veil the insolence, \"for true gods such as\nye are can guard their servants. We thank you for your words, O ye gods,\nand we pray you to be merciful to us, for the threats of true gods are\nvery terrible. And now one little word. I ask justice of you, O ye gods.\nShe who was given to be bride of the Snake, my niece who is named Saga,\nhas been cruelly beaten by some evil-doer here in the palace, as I know,\nfor but now I met her bruised and weeping. I ask of you then that\nye search out this evil-doer and punish him with death or stripes.\nFarewell, O ye high gods.\"\n\nLeonard looked at the priest as he bowed humbly before the thrones, and\na desire to take Otter's advice and kill him entered his heart, for he\nknew that he had come to drag them to their trial and perhaps to doom.\nHe still had his revolver, and it would have been easy to shoot him, for\nNam's broad breast was a target that few could miss. And yet, what could\nit help them to shed his blood? There were many to fill his place if\nhe died, and violence would certainly be answered with violence. No, he\nwould let him be, and they must bide their fate.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nJUANNA PREVARICATES\n\nThe morrow drew towards its evening. Like those that had gone before\nit, this day had been misty and miserable, only distinguished from its\npredecessors by the fall of some sharp showers of sleet. Now, as the\nafternoon waned, the sky began to clear in its accustomed fashion; but\nthe bitter wind sweeping down the mountains, though it drove away the\nfog, gave no promise of any break in the weather. At sunset Leonard went\nto the palace gates and looked towards the temple, about the walls\nof which a number of people were already gathering, as though in\nanticipation of some great event. They caught sight of him, and drew\nas near to the gates of the palace as they dared, howling curses and\nshaking their fists.\n\n\"This is a foretaste of what we must expect to-night, I suppose,\" said\nLeonard to Francisco, who had followed him, as they retreated across the\ncourtyard. \"We are in trouble now, friend. I do not so much care for my\nown sake, but it breaks my heart to think of Juanna. What will be the\nend of it, I wonder?\"\n\n\"For me, Outram, the end will be death, of that I am sure; well, I have\nlong expected it, and I am ready to die. What your fate will be I cannot\nsay; but as to the Senora, comfort yourself; for many weeks I have had a\npresentiment that she will escape safely.\"\n\n\"In that case I am ready enough to go,\" answered Leonard. \"Life is as\ndear to me as to other men; but I tell you, Francisco, that I would pay\nmine down gladly to-night as the price of her deliverance.\"\n\n\"I know it, Outram; we are both of one mind there, and perhaps before\nmany hours are over we shall be called upon to practise what we preach.\"\n\nBy now they had reached the throne-room, where Otter, who for the last\ntwenty hours had been quite sober, was squatted on the floor at the\nfoot of his throne, a picture of repentant misery, while Juanna walked\nswiftly up and down the long room, lost in reflection.\n\n\"Any news, Leonard?\" she said as they came in.\n\n\"None, except that there are great preparations going on yonder,\" and he\nnodded towards the temple; \"also a mob is howling at the gates.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" groaned Otter, addressing Juanna, \"cannot you, who are named\nShepherdess of the Heavens, prophesy to these people that the weather\nwill break, and so save us from the Snake?\"\n\n\"I can prophesy,\" she answered; \"but it will not change to-night, nor, I\nthink, to-morrow. However, I will try.\"\n\nThen came a silence: nobody seemed to have anything to say. It was\nbroken by the entrance of Olfan, whose face showed the disturbance of\nhis mind.\n\n\"What passes, Olfan?\" asked Juanna.\n\n\"Queen,\" he answered sadly, \"there is great trouble at hand. The people\nrave for the blood of you, their gods. Nam told you that ye are summoned\nthis night to confer with the people. Alas! I must tell you otherwise.\nThis night ye will be put upon your trial before the Council of the\nElders.\"\n\n\"That we guessed, Olfan, and if the verdict goes against us, what then?\"\n\n\"Alas that I must say it! Then, Queen, you will be hurled, all of you,\ninto the pool of the Snake, to be food for the Snake.\"\n\n\"Cannot you protect us, Olfan?\"\n\n\"I cannot, O Queen, except with my own life. The soldiers are under\nmy command indeed; but in this matter they will not obey me, for the\npriests have whispered in their ears, and if the sun does not shine they\ntoo must starve next winter. Pardon me, Queen, but if you are gods, how\nis it that you need help from me who am but a man? Cannot the gods then\nprotect themselves and be avenged upon their enemies?\"\n\nJuanna looked despairingly at Leonard, who sat by her side pulling at\nhis beard, as was his fashion when perplexed.\n\n\"I think that you had better tell him,\" he said in English. \"Our\nsituation is desperate. Probably in a few hours he will know us to be\nimpostors; indeed, he guesses it already. It is better that he should\nlearn the truth from our own lips. The man is honest; moreover, he owes\nhis life to us, though it is true that were it not for us he would never\nhave been in danger of his life. Now we must trust him and take our\nchance; if we make a mistake, it does not greatly matter--we have made\nso many already.\"\n\nJuanna bowed her head and thought awhile, then she lifted it and spoke.\n\n\"Olfan,\" she said, \"are we alone? That which I have to say must be\noverheard by none.\"\n\n\"We are alone, Queen,\" he answered, glancing round, \"but these walls\nhave ears.\"\n\n\"Olfan, draw near.\"\n\nHe obeyed, and leaning forward she spoke to him almost in a whisper,\nwhile the others clustered round to hear her words.\n\n\"You must call me Queen no more,\" she said in a voice broken with\nhumiliation. \"I am no goddess, I am but a mortal woman, and this man,\"\nand she pointed to Otter, \"is no god, he is only a black dwarf.\"\n\nShe paused, watching the effect of her words. An expression of\nastonishment swept across the king's face, but it was her boldness\nrather than the purport of her speech that caused it. Then he smiled.\n\n\"Perhaps I have guessed as much,\" he answered. \"And yet I must still\ncall you by that name, seeing that you are the queen of all women, for\nsay, where is there another so lovely, so brave, or so great? Here at\nleast there are none,\" and he bowed before her with a stately courtesy\nthat would have become any European gentleman.\n\nNow it was Leonard's turn to look astonished. There was nothing in the\nking's words to which he could take objection, and yet he did not like\ntheir tone; it was too full of admiration. Moreover it seemed to him\nthat Olfan was not in the least disappointed to discover as a fact that\nJuanna was only a woman--a supposition which was fully established by\nhis next speech.\n\n\"I am glad to learn from your own lips, Queen, that you are no goddess,\nbut a mortal lady, seeing that goddesses are far away and we men must\nworship them from afar, whereas women--we may love,\" and again he bowed.\n\n\"My word!\" said Leonard to himself, \"this king is setting himself up as\nmy rival. I almost wish I had put things on a more satisfactory footing;\nbut of course it is absurd. Poor Juanna!\"\n\nAs for Juanna herself, she started and blushed; here was a new trouble,\nbut however disagreeable it might prove to be, now was no time to show\ndispleasure.\n\n\"Listen, Olfan,\" she said, \"this is not an hour for pretty speeches\nwhich mean nothing, for it seems that before the light dawns again I may\nwell be dead and far beyond all love and worship. This is our tale: we\ncame to your land to seek adventures, and also to win those red stones\nthat you name the blood of Aca, which among the white people are much\nprized as ornaments for their women. That is why I, who am a woman,\nurged the Deliverer to undertake this journey, and it is because of my\nfolly that now we stand in danger of our lives.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, Queen,\" said Olfan bluntly, \"but I would ask you one\nquestion before you tell me the end of your tale. What is this white man\nto you?\"\n\nNow Juanna was \"in a cleft stick\"; if she said that Leonard was nothing\nto her, it might possibly be better for him, though it was doubtful\nwhether Olfan would believe her. If, on the other hand, she said that\nhe was her husband, it might be better for herself, and protect her from\nthe advances of this dignified savage; but against this course her pride\nrevolted. Had she not always indignantly repudiated the validity of that\nhateful marriage, and though she loved him, were not she and Leonard\nin a sense at daggers drawn? Still she must decide, and quickly; her\ncommon-sense told her that under the circumstances it was her pride\nwhich must give way.\n\n\"He is my husband,\" she said boldly.\n\nOlfan's face fell; then a look of doubt came into it, for Juanna's mode\nof life, every detail of which was known to him, seemed to contradict\nher statement.\n\nSeeing that he did not believe her, Juanna plunged still deeper into the\nmire.\n\n\"He is my husband,\" she said again. \"This man,\" and she pointed to\nFrancisco, \"who is a priest among us, married us according to our\ncustoms some six moons since, and Otter yonder was witness to the\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"Is this so?\" asked Olfan.\n\n\"It is so, King,\" replied Francisco. \"I married them, and they are man\nand wife.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, it is so,\" put in Otter, \"for I saw it done, and we\ncelebrated a great sacrifice in honour of that wedding feast. I would\nthat we could have such another here to-night.\"\n\n\"Fear not, Dwarf,\" answered Olfan with a touch of irritation, \"you will\nsee enough of sacrifices before all is ended.\"\n\nThen a new thought struck him, and he added, \"You say that the Deliverer\nis your husband, Queen, and these men bear witness to it, all except\nyour lord himself! Now tell me one thing more: do you love him and would\nyou be sorry if he died?\"\n\nJuanna's brow burnt red as the ruby stone upon it, for with the\nexception of her black robe she was prepared to proceed to the temple.\nBut there was no help for it now; she must speak clearly, however much\nit shamed her to do so, lest Olfan might take her silence as a hint, and\nthe \"husband\" for whom she disavowed affection should be removed from\nher life for ever.\n\n\"You have little right to put such a question to me, King, yet I will\nanswer it. I love him, and if he died I should die also.\"\n\nLeonard suppressed an exclamation with difficulty, for here was Juanna\nappearing in a new light indeed.\n\n\"I am answered, Queen,\" said Olfan in tones of deep depression. \"Now, if\nit pleases you, will you end your tale?\"\n\n\"There is not much to tell,\" replied Juanna, heaving a sigh of relief,\nfor this cross-examination as to her exact relations with Leonard had\nbeen somewhat trying. \"The woman Soa, my servant, is of your people;\nindeed, she is a daughter to Nam the priest, and fled the land forty\nyears ago because she was destined to the Snake.\"\n\n\"Where is she now?\" interrupted Olfan, looking round.\n\n\"We do not know; last night she vanished as our other servants have\nvanished.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Nam knows, and if so you may see her again soon. Proceed,\nQueen.\"\n\n\"After the Deliverer and I were married, Soa, who had been my nurse for\nmany years, told us of the Great People her brethren, among whom she\nwished to die.\"\n\n\"May her desire be gratified!\" put in Otter.\n\n\"And said that if we would escort her thither we could buy many such\nstones as that upon my brow, which she had brought with her from this\ncountry and given to me. Then it was that I, desiring the playthings,\ntormented my husband till he consented to lead me hither, though his\nown heart spoke against it. So we came, and the journey was long and\nterrible, but at last we reached the cliff yonder which borders the Land\nof Mist, and it was then for the first time, when it was too late to go\nback, that Soa told us the tale of the gods of your people, and showed\nus that either we must do sacrilege and feign to be those gods come\nback, as the prophecy promised, or perish miserably. Indeed this was her\nplot, to set up false gods over you, having first told the secret to the\npriests that she might gain honour with them and save herself alive.\n\n\"And now, Olfan, that is all the tale. We have played the game and we\nhave lost, or so it seems--that is, unless you help us;\" and she clasped\nher hands and looked upon him pleadingly.\n\nThe king dropped his eyes as though he were not willing to contemplate\nthe loveliness which, as he now learned, belonged to the white stranger\nat Juanna's side.\n\n\"Have I not said that my power is little, Queen?\" he answered somewhat\nsullenly. \"Also, why should I help those who came to this land to trick\nus, and who have brought the anger of the gods upon its children?\"\n\n\"Because we saved your life, Olfan, and you swore to be loyal to us.\"\n\n\"Had it not been for you, Queen, my life would not have been in danger;\nmoreover, I swore fealty to gods, and now the gods are mortals, upon\nwhom the true gods will be avenged. Why then should I help you?\"\n\n\"Because we have been friends, Olfan. You shall help us for my sake.\"\n\n\"For your sake, Queen,\" he said bitterly, \"for your sake, who tell me\nthat you are this man's wife and that you love him to the death. Nay,\nthis is much to ask. Had it been otherwise, had you been unwed and\nwilling to look upon me, the king of this land, with favour, then\ndoubtless I had died for your sake if there were need. But now--! Have\nyou then no better reasons to show why I should risk my life for you and\nfor these men?\"\n\n\"I have two more reasons, King, and if they are not enough, then leave\nus to our fate, and let us, who must prepare to die, waste no more\nbreath in words. The first is that we are your friends and have trusted\nyou, saving your life at the danger of our own and telling you this tale\nof our own free will. Therefore in the name of friendship, which you\nshould hold sacred, who are no common man but a king, we demand your\nhelp, we who have put our lives in the hollow of your hand, knowing that\nyou are of noble mind and will not betray us.\n\n\"The second is that our interest is your interest: we strive against Nam\nand the priests, and so do you. If Nam conquers us to-day, to-morrow\nit will be your turn, and the Snake, whose fangs we must feel, shall in\ndays to come feed upon you also. Now is the hour of destiny for you and\nyour descendants: cling to us and break the yoke of Nam and the priests,\nor desert us and bind that yoke upon your shoulders to your doom. I have\nspoken--choose.\"\n\nOlfan thought awhile and answered:\n\n\"Truly your mind is great, Queen, and sees far into the darkness of\nthings such as our women have no knowledge of. You should have ruled\nthis country and not I, for then by now Nam, who is my master, would\nhave begged his daily bread at the gates of your palace, and the priests\nhis servants had become the hewers of your wood and the drawers of your\nwater. But I will not talk to you of policy, for time is short. Nay, I\nwill deal with your first reason and that alone.\n\n\"You have conjured me in the name of friendship and of my oath, and by\nthe memory of service done, and not in vain. I am a man different from\nthat race of men of whom you are, a wild chief of a wild tribe, having\nlittle wisdom; yet I have learned these things--never to break a\npromise, never to desert a friend, and never to forget a service.\nTherefore, because I swore fealty to you, because you are my friend, and\nbecause you saved my life, I will protect you to the last, though it\nmay well chance that I can do nothing except die for you. For, Queen,\nalthough you can be nought to me while yonder man lives, still I am\nready to give my life for you. As for the others I will say this only,\nthat I will not harm them or betray them.\n\n\"Now I go to speak with certain of the great men who are friends to me\nand hate the priest, so that when this matter comes on for judgment they\nmay lift up their voices in your favour, for nothing can be done except\nby policy--that is, not now. Shortly I will return to lead you to the\ntemple. Till then, farewell,\" and he bowed and was gone.\n\nWhen the curtain had swung to behind Olfan, Juanna sank back in her\nchair and sighed, but Leonard sprang up and said:\n\n\"Juanna, that savage is right, you should have been a queen. I know what\nit must have cost you to say what you did.\"\n\n\"Pray, to what do you refer, Leonard?\" she said, interrupting him\ncoldly.\n\n\"I mean about our being married and the rest.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes. Well, you see it is sometimes necessary to tell white lies,\nand I think that after to-night I am entitled to a prize for general\nproficiency in this respect. Of course,\" she added, dropping her\nsarcastic tone, \"you will not misinterpret anything that I was forced\nto say to Olfan with reference to yourself, because you know that those\nstatements were the biggest fibs of all. Just then, had it been needful,\nI should have been prepared to swear that I was married to Otter and\ndeeply attached to him, or even to the king himself, who, by the\nway, strikes me as the most satisfactory savage that I have ever come\nacross--in short, as a gentleman.\"\n\nLeonard turned pale with anger.\n\n\"Really, Juanna,\" he said, \"I think that you might wait until I seek to\ntake some advantage of our friendship and accidental relations before\nyou rebuke me as you think fit to do. It is little short of an insult,\nand were we in any civilised country I would never speak to you again.\"\n\n\"Don't get angry, Leonard,\" she said appealingly, for Juanna seemed to\nhave every mood at her command and ready to be assumed at a moment's\nnotice. Perhaps this gift was one of the secrets of her charm, since\nmonotony is a thing to be avoided by women who seek to rule, even the\nmonotony of sweetness. \"It is very unkind of you,\" she went on, \"to\nspeak crossly to me when I am so tired with talking to that savage and\nwe may all be dead and buried in a few hours,\" and she looked as though\nshe were going to cry.\n\nLeonard collapsed instantly, for Juanna's plaintive mood was the one\nthat he could resist the least of any.\n\n\"You would make me angry if I were on my death-bed,\" he said, \"that is,\nwhen you talk like that. But there it is, I cannot change you, so let\nus change the subject. Have you any of that poison to spare? If so, you\nmight serve us out a little; we may want it before the evening is over.\"\n\nJuanna put her hand to her hair and after some manipulation produced a\ntiny skin bag, from which she extracted a brown ball of about the size\nof a rifle bullet.\n\n\"I can afford to be generous,\" she said with a little laugh; \"there is\nenough here to kill twenty of us.\"\n\nThen Leonard took a knife and chipped off three fragments from the ball,\ntaking one himself and presenting the other two to Francisco and Otter.\nThe priest received it doubtfully, but the dwarf would have none of it.\n\n\"Keep it for yourself, Baas,\" he said, \"keep it for yourself. Whatever\nway I die it shall not be thus. I do not love a medicine that causes men\nto tie themselves into knots and then turns them green. No, no; first I\nwill face the jaws of the Snake.\"\n\nSo Leonard took that piece also.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nTHE TRIAL OF THE GODS\n\nJuanna had scarcely restored the remainder of her deadly medicine to its\nhiding-place, when the curtains were drawn and Nam entered. After his\ncustomary salutations, which on this occasion were more copious than\nusual, he remarked blandly that the moon had risen in a clear sky.\n\n\"Which means, I suppose, that it is time for us to start,\" said Leonard\ngruffly.\n\nThen they set out, Juanna in her monk-like robe, and Otter in his red\nfringe and a goat-skin cape which he insisted upon wearing.\n\n\"I may as well die warm as cold, Baas,\" he explained, \"for of cold I\nshall know enough when I am dead.\"\n\nAt the palace gate Olfan and a guard were waiting, but they found no\nopportunity of speaking with him. Here also were gathered a great number\nof priests, who preceded and followed them.\n\nThe procession being formed, they were led solemnly to a different gate\nof the temple from that by which they had entered it on their previous\nvisits. On this occasion the secret passages were avoided, and they\npassed up a broad avenue though the centre of the amphitheatre, to\nseats that had been prepared for them on that side of the pool which was\nfurthest from the colossal idol. As before, the temple was crowded with\nhuman beings, and their advance through it was very impressive, for the\npriests chanted as they walked, while the multitude preserved an ominous\nsilence.\n\nAt first Leonard was at a loss to know why they were placed on the\nhither side of the pool, but presently he saw the reason. In front of\nthe chairs to be occupied by Juanna and Otter, an open space of rock was\nleft, semicircular in shape, on which were set other seats to the number\nof thirty or more. These seats were allotted to elders of the people,\nwho, as Leonard guessed rightly, had been chosen to act as their judges.\nThe position was selected for the convenience of these elders, and in\norder that the words they spoke might be heard by a larger proportion of\ntheir vast audience.\n\nWhen Juanna and Otter were seated, and Leonard and Francisco had taken\ntheir places behind them, Nam came forward to address the Council and\nthe multitude beyond.\n\n\"Elders of the People of the Mist,\" he said, \"I have conveyed your\nwishes to the holy gods, who but lately have deigned to put on the flesh\nof men to visit us their people; namely, that they should meet you here\nand talk with you of the trouble which has come upon the land. And now\nthe gracious gods have assented to your wish, and behold, they are\nface to face with you and with this great company of their children. Be\npleased therefore to make known what you desire to the gods, that they\nmay answer you, either with their own mouths or by the voice of me,\ntheir servant.\"\n\nHe ceased, and after a pause, during which the people murmured angrily,\nan elder rose and said:\n\n\"We would know of you how it is, O Aca and O Jal, that the summer has\ndeserted the land. Now our strait is very sorry, for famine will come\nupon us with the winter snows. A while ago, O Aca and O Jal, you changed\nthe worship of this people, forbidding the victims who had been prepared\nto be offered up at the spring festival, and lo! there has been no\nspring. Therefore we ask a word of you on this matter, for the people\nhave consulted together, and say by our voice that they will have no\ngods who kill the spring. Speak, O ye gods, and you, Nam, speak also,\nfor we would learn the reason of these evils; and from you, O Nam, we\nwould learn how it comes that you have proclaimed gods in the land whose\nbreath has destroyed the sunshine.\"\n\n\"Ye ask me, O People of the Mist,\" answered Juanna, \"why it is that the\nwinter stretches out his hand over the slumber of the spring, forbidding\nher to awake, and I will answer you in few words and short. It is\nbecause of your disobedience and the hardness of your hearts, O ye\nrebellious children. Did ye not do sacrifice when we forbade you to take\nthe blood of men? Ay, and have not our servants been stolen secretly\naway and put to death to satisfy your lust for slaughter? It is for this\nreason, because of your disobedience, that the heavens have grown hard\nas your own hearts and will not bless you with their sunshine and their\ngentle rain. I have answered you.\"\n\nThen again the spokesman of the elders rose and said:\n\n\"We have heard your words, O Aca, and they are words of little comfort,\nfor to sacrifice is the custom of the land, and hitherto no evil has\nbefallen us because of that ancient custom. Yet if there has been\noffence, it is not we who have offended, but rather the priests in whose\nhands these matters lie; and as for your servants, we know nothing of\nthem, or of their fate. Now, Nam, make answer to the charges of the\ngods, and to the questions of the people, for you are the chief of their\nservants and you have proclaimed them to be true gods and set them over\nus to rule us.\"\n\nThus adjured, Nam stood forward, and his mien was humble and anxious,\nfor he saw well that his accusers were not to be trifled with, and that\nhis life, or at least his power, was at stake, together with those of\nthe gods.\n\n\"Children of the Mist,\" he began, \"your words are sharp, yet I do not\ncomplain of them, for, as ye shall learn, my fault has been grievous.\nTruly, I am the chief of the servants of the gods, and I am also the\nservant of the people, and now it would seem that I have betrayed both\ngods and people, though not of my own will.\n\n\"Listen: ye know the legend that has come down to us, that Aca and Jal\nshould reappear in the land, wearing the shapes of a fair white maiden\nand of a black dwarf. Ye know also how they came as had been promised,\nand how I showed them to you here in this temple, and ye accepted them.\nYe remember that then they put away the ancient law and forbade the\nsacrifices, and by the hand of their servant who is named Deliverer,\nthey destroyed two of the priests, my brethren, in a strange and\nterrible fashion.\n\n\"Then I murmured, though they threatened me with death, but ye overruled\nmy words and accepted the new law, and from that hour all things have\ngone ill. Now I took counsel with my heart, for it seemed wonderful to\nme that the gods should discard their ancient worship, and I said to\nmy heart: Can these be true gods, or have I perchance been duped?\nThenceforward I held my peace, and set myself to watch, and now after\nmuch watching--alas! I must say it to my shame--I have discovered that\nthey are no true gods, but wicked liars who have sought to usurp the\nplaces of the gods.\"\n\nHe paused, and a roar of rage and astonishment went up from the\nassembled thousands.\n\n\"It has come at last,\" whispered Leonard into Juanna's ear.\n\n\"Yes, it has come,\" she answered. \"Well, I expected it, and now we must\nface it out.\"\n\nWhen the tumult had subsided, the spokesman of the elders addressed Nam,\nsaying:\n\n\"These are heavy words, O Nam, and having uttered them you must prove\nthem, for until they are proved we will not believe readily that there\nare human beings so wicked that they dare to name themselves as gods.\nWhen you proclaimed these strangers to be Aca and Jal, we accepted them,\nperhaps too easily and after too short a search. Now you denounce them\nas liars, but we will not disclaim them whom we have once received till\nwe are sure that there is no room for error. It may chance, Nam, that it\nwould please you well to cast aside those gods who have threatened you\nwith death and do not love you.\"\n\n\"I should be bold indeed,\" answered Nam, \"if I dared to speak as I have\nspoken lacking testimony to establish a charge so dreadful as that which\nI bring against these wanderers. Nor should I seek to publish my own\nshame and folly were I not forced thereto by knowledge that, did I\nconceal it, would make me a partner of their crime. Listen, this is the\ntale of those whom we have worshipped: the fair woman, as she herself\ntold us, is named Shepherdess of the Heavens, and she is the wife of the\nwhite man who is named Deliverer, and the dwarf Dweller in the Waters is\ntheir servant, together with the second white man and the others.\n\n\"Dwelling in a far country, these men and women chanced to learn the\nstory of our people--how, I shall show you presently--and also that we\nfind in the earth and use in the ceremonies of our temple certain red\nand blue stones which among the white people are of priceless value.\nThese they determined to steal, being adventurers who seek after wealth.\nTo this end the Shepherdess learned our language, also she learned how\nto play the part of Aca, while the dwarf, dog that he is, dared to take\nthe holy name of Jal. I will be short: they accomplished their journey,\nand the rest you know. But, as it happened, none of the stones they\ncovert have come into their hands, except that gem which the Shepherdess\nwears upon her forehead, and this she brought with her.\n\n\"Now, People of the Mist, when doubts of these gods had entered into\nme I made a plan: I set spies to watch them in the palace yonder, those\nspies being the wife who was given to the dwarf and her handmaidens.\nAlso, I caused their black servants to be seized and thrown to the\nSnake, one or two of them at a time, for of this I was sure, that if\nthey had the power they would protect their servants. But, as the Snake\nknows, those men were not protected. Meanwhile reports came to me\nfrom the women, and more especially from Saga, the granddaughter of my\nbrother, who was given as a bride to Jal. And this was their report:\nthat the dwarf behaved himself like a cur of low birth, and that when\nhe was in liquor, which was often, he babbled of his doings with the\nDeliverer in other lands, though all that he said they could not tell me\nbecause even now he has little knowledge of our tongue.\n\n\"When these tales came to my ears, you may guess, O People of the Mist,\nthat if I had doubted before, now my heart was shaken, and yet I had\nno proof. In my darkness I prayed to the gods for light, and lo! light\ncame. Among the followers of these wanderers was a woman, and but\nyesterday this woman visited me and confessed all. Forty years ago she\nhad fled from among our people--I know not why, but she took with her a\nknowledge of our secrets. It was she who told them of the gods and the\nstory of the gods, and she instructed them how they should deceive us\nand win the red stones which they desired. But now her heart repents her\nof the evil, and I will summon her before you, that ye may judge between\nme and these liars who have brought me to this shame. Bring forth the\nwoman.\"\n\nThere was a silence, and so intense was the interest that no sound came\nfrom the audience, which watched for the appearance of the witness.\nPresently Soa advanced from the shadows at the foot of the colossus, and\nescorted by two priests took her stand in the centre of the semicircle\nof judges.\n\n\"Speak, woman,\" said Nam.\n\nThen Soa spoke. \"I am of the People of the Mist,\" she said, \"as ye may\nknow by looking on me and hearing me. I was the daughter of a priest,\nand forty years ago, when I was young and fair, I fled this land for my\nown reasons, and travelled south for three months' journey, till I came\nto a village on a mighty river, where I dwelt for twenty years earning a\nlivelihood as a doctoress of medicine. Then there came into that village\na white man, whose wife gave birth to a daughter and died. I became the\nnurse of that daughter; she is the woman who sits before you, and her\nname is Shepherdess.\n\n\"Twenty years more went by, and I desired to return to my own land\nthat I might die among my people. I told the tale of my land and of its\nwealth to the Shepherdess and to her husband the Deliverer, for I dared\nnot travel alone. Therefore in my wickedness I showed them how they\nmight feign to be the gods of the People of the Mist, come back\naccording to the legend, for I saw that the dwarf, the Deliverer's\nservant, was shaped like to the shape of the statue of Jal, who sits in\nstone above you. Being greedy, they fell into the plan, for above all\nthings they desired to win the precious stones. But when we were come\nhither the true gods visited me in a dream so that my heart was troubled\nbecause of the evil which I had done, and yesterday I escaped to Nam and\ntold him all the tale which you have heard. That is the story, People of\nthe Mist, and now I pray your mercy and your pardon.\"\n\nSoa ceased, and Leonard, who had been watching the multitude, whispered\nto Juanna:\n\n\"Speak quickly if you can think of anything to say. They are silent now\nbecause of their astonishment, but in another minute they will break\nout, and then----\"\n\n\"People of the Mist,\" cried Juanna, taking the hint, \"you have heard the\nwords of Nam and the words of her who was my servant. They dare to tell\nyou that we are no gods. So be it: on this matter we will not reason\nwith you, for can the gods descend to prove their godhead? We will not\nreason, but I will say this in warning: put us away if you wish,--and it\nmay well chance that we shall suffer ourselves to be put away, since the\ngods do not desire to rule over those who reject them, but would choose\nrather to return to their own place.\n\n\"Yet for you it shall be a sad and an unlucky day when ye lift a hand\nagainst our majesty, for in going we will leave you that by which we\nshall be remembered. Ay, we will bequeath to you three things: famine\nand pestilence and civil war, which shall rage among you and destroy\nyou till ye are no more a people. Ye have suffered our servants to be\nmurdered, and disobeyed our commands, and it is for this reason, as I\nhave told you, that the sun shines no more and the summer will not come.\nComplete your wickedness if ye will, and let the gods follow by the path\nthat their servants trod. Then, People of the Mist, ye shall reap as ye\nhave sown, and death and desolation shall be your harvest.\n\n\"Now for that base slave who has borne false witness against us. Among\nthe many things she has told you, one thing she has left untold: that\nshe is daughter to Nam the priest; that she fled the land because she\nwas chosen bride to the Snake, and is therefore an apostate worthy of\ndeath. One word also as to Nam, her father; if his tale be true, then he\nhimself is condemned by it, for doubtless he knew all at the beginning,\nfrom the lips of his daughter Soa.\n\n\"Yes, knowing the truth he dared to set up gods in the land whom he\nbelieved to be false, trusting thereby to increase his own power and\nglory, and when these failed him because of his wickedness, then he did\nnot scruple to cry aloud his shame. I have spoken, People of the Mist.\nNow judge between us and let fate follow judgment, for we renounce you.\"\n\nShe ended, her face alight with anger and her eyes flashing with\nexcitement, and so great was the power of her eloquence and beauty that\nit seemed to throw a spell of silence over the hearts of her fierce and\nturbulent audience, while Soa slunk back into the shadow and Nam cowered\nvisibly.\n\n\"It is false, O people,\" he cried in a voice that trembled with rage and\nfear. \"My daughter told me the tale for the first time at dawn to-day.\"\n\nHis words awoke the audience as it were, and instantly there arose a\nbabel of sounds that rent the very skies. \"His daughter! He says that\nshe is his daughter! Nam owns his crimes!\" yelled some.\n\n\"Away with the false gods!\" shouted others.\n\n\"Touch them not, they are true gods and will bring a curse upon us!\"\nanswered a third party, among whom Leonard recognised the voice of\nOlfan.\n\nAnd so the clamour went on. For full ten minutes it raged, till the\nexhaustion of those that made it brought it to its end, and Juanna, who\nall this while sat silent as some lovely marble statue, became aware\nthat the spokesman of the elders was once more addressing the multitude.\n\n\"People of the Mist,\" he said, \"hold your peace, and hearken to me.\nWe have been chosen judges of this matter, and now, having consulted\ntogether, we will give judgment, and you shall be bound by it. As to\nwhether these strangers who are named Aca and Jal are true gods or\nfalse, we say no word. But if they are false gods, then surely Nam is\nguilty with them.\"\n\nHere a shout of assent burst from the audience, and Leonard watching the\nhigh priest saw him tremble.\n\n\"Yet,\" he went on, \"they have told us by the mouth of her who sits\nbefore you, that it is because of our offences that the sun has ceased\nto shine at their command. Therefore at their command it can be made to\nshine. Then let them give us a sign or let them die, if indeed they are\nmortal, for if they are not mortal we cannot kill them. And this shall\nbe the sign which they must give: If to-morrow at the dawn the mists\nhave vanished and the sun shines red and clear on the snows of yonder\nmountain, then it is well and we will worship them. But if the morning\nis cold and mist-laden, then, true gods or false, we will hurl them from\nthe head of the statue into the pit of the Snake, there to be dealt\nwith by the Snake, or to deal with him as it may chance. That is our\njudgment, People of the Mist, and Nam shall carry it out if need be, for\nhe shall keep his power and his place until all these wonders are made\nclear, and then himself he shall be judged according to their issue.\"\n\nNow the great mass of the people cried aloud that this was a wise and\njust saying, but others were silent, for though they did not agree with\nit they dared not dispute the sentence. Then Juanna rose and said:\n\n\"We have heard your words and we will withdraw to consider them, and by\ndawn ye shall see us seated on the Black One yonder. But whether we will\ncause the sun to shine or choose to pass to our own place by the path\nof boiling waters, we do not know, though it seems to me that the last\nthing is better than the first, for we weary of your company, People of\nthe Mist, and it is not fitting that we should bless you longer with our\npresence. Nevertheless, should we choose that path, those evils which I\nhave foretold shall fall upon you. Olfan, lead us hence.\"\n\nThe king stepped forward with his guards and the procession passed back\ntowards the palace solemnly and in silence, for none attempted to bar\ntheir way. They reached it safely at exactly ten o'clock by Leonard's\nwatch.\n\n\"Now let us eat and drink,\" said Leonard when they stood alone in the\nthrone-room, \"for we shall need all our strength to-night.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Juanna with a sad smile, \"let us eat and drink, for\nto-morrow we die.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nFRANCISCO'S EXPIATION\n\nWhen they had finished their meal, which was about as sad an\nentertainment as can well be conceived, they began to talk.\n\n\"Do you see any hope?\" asked Juanna of the other three.\n\nLeonard shook his head and answered:\n\n\"Unless the sun shines at dawn to-morrow, we are dead men.\"\n\n\"Then there is little chance of that, Baas,\" groaned Otter, \"for the\nnight is as the nights have been for these five weeks. No wonder that\nthis people are fierce and wicked who live in such a climate.\"\n\nJuanna hid her face in her hands for a while, then spoke:\n\n\"They did not say that any harm was to come to you, Leonard, or to\nFrancisco, so perhaps you will escape.\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" he answered; \"besides, to be perfectly frank, if you are\ngoing to die, I would rather die with you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Leonard,\" she said gently, \"but that will not help either of\nus much, will it? What will they do with us? Throw us from the head of\nthe statue?\" and she shuddered.\n\n\"That seems to be their amiable intention, but at any rate we need none\nof us go through with it alive. How long does your medicine take to\nwork, Juanna?\"\n\n\"Half a minute at the outside, I fancy, and sometimes less. Are you sure\nthat you will take none, Otter? Think; the other end is dreadful.\"\n\n\"No, Shepherdess,\" said the dwarf, who now in the presence of imminent\ndanger was as he had been before he sought comfort in the beer-pot,\nbrave, ready, and collected, \"it is not my plan to suffer myself to be\nhurled into the pit. Nay, when the time comes I shall spring there of\nmy own free will, and if I am not killed--and an otter knows how to leap\ninto a pool--then if I cannot avoid him I will make a fight for it with\nthat great dweller in the water. Yes, and I go to make ready that with\nwhich I will fight,\" and he rose and departed to his sleeping-place.\n\nJust then Francisco followed his example, seeking a quiet place in which\nto pursue his devotions, and thus Leonard and Juanna were left alone.\n\nFor some minutes he watched her as she sat beside him in her white\ntemple dress, her beautiful face looking stern and sad against the dusky\nbackground of the torchlight, and a great shame and pity filled his\nheart. The blood of this girl was on his hands, and he could do nothing\nto help her. His selfishness had dragged her into this miserable\nenterprise, and now its inevitable end was at hand and he was her\nmurderer, the murderer of the woman who was all the world to him, and\nwho had been entrusted to his care with her father's dying breath.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" he said at length with something like a sob, and laying\nhis hand upon hers.\n\n\"What have I to forgive, Leonard?\" she replied gently. \"Now that it is\nall finished and I look back upon the past few months, it seems to me\nthat it is you who should forgive, for I have often behaved badly to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Juanna, it was my wicked folly that led you into this, and\nnow you are about to be cut off in the beginning of your youth and in\nthe flower of your beauty. I am your murderer, Juanna,\" and dropping\nhis voice he hesitated, then added: \"It may as well out now, for time is\nshort, though I have often sworn that nothing should make me say it: I\nlove you.\"\n\nShe did not start or even stir at his words, but sat staring as before\ninto the darkness: only a pink flush grew upon the pallor of her neck\nand cheek as she answered:\n\n\"You love me, Leonard? You forget--Jane Beach!\"\n\n\"It is perfectly true, Juanna, that I was once attached to Jane Beach,\nand it is true that I still think of her with affection, but I have not\nseen her for many years, and I am certain that she has thrown me over\nand married another man. Most men pass through several affairs of the\nheart in their early days; I have had but one, and it is done with.\n\n\"When first I saw you in the slave camp I loved you, Juanna, and I have\ngone on loving you ever since, even after I became aware from your words\nand conduct that you did not entertain any such affection for myself. I\nknow that your mind has not changed upon the matter, for had it done so,\nyou would scarcely have spoken to me as you did to-day after Olfan left\nus. Indeed, I do not altogether understand why I have told you this,\nsince it will not interest you very much and may possibly annoy you\nin your last hours. I suppose it was because I wished to make a clean\nbreast of it before I pass to where we lose all our loves and hopes.\"\n\n\"Or find them,\" said Juanna, still looking before her.\n\nThen there was silence for a minute or more, till Leonard, believing\nthat he had got his answer, began to think that he would do well to\nleave her for a while. Just as he was about to rise Juanna made a gentle\nmovement; slowly, very slowly, she turned herself, slowly she stretched\nout her arms towards him, and laid her head upon his breast.\n\nFor a moment Leonard was astounded; he could scarcely believe the\nevidence of his senses. Then recovering himself, he kissed her tenderly.\n\nPresently Juanna slipped from his embrace and said, \"Listen to me,\nLeonard: are men all blind, I wonder, or are you an exception? I don't\nknow and don't want to know, but certainly it does seem strange that\nwhat has been so painfully patent to myself for the last five or six\nmonths, should have been invisible to you. Leonard, you were not the\nonly one who fell in love yonder in the slave camp. But you quickly\nchecked my folly by telling me the story of Jane Beach, and of course\nafter that, whatever my thoughts may have been, I did my utmost to hide\nthem from you, with more success, it seems, than I expected. Indeed I am\nnot sure that I am wise to let you see them now, for though you declare\nthat Jane is dead and buried, she might re-arise at any moment. I do\nnot believe that men forget their first loves, Leonard, though they\nmay persuade themselves to the contrary--when they are a long way from\nthem.\"\n\n\"Don't you think that we might drop Jane, dear?\" he answered with some\nimpatience, for Juanna's words brought back to his mind visions of\nanother love-scene that had taken place amid the English snows more than\nseven years before.\n\n\"I am sure that I am quite ready to drop her now and for ever. But do\nnot let us begin to spar when so little time is left to us. Let us talk\nof other things. Tell me that you love me, love me, love me, for those\nare the words that I would hear ringing in my ears before they become\ndeaf to this world and its echoes, and those are the words with which I\nhope that you will greet me some few hours hence and in a happier land.\nLeonard, tell me that you love me for to-day and for to-morrow, now and\nfor ever.\"\n\nSo he told her that and much more, speaking to her earnestly, hopefully,\nand most tenderly, as a man might speak to the woman whom he worshipped\nand with whom is about to travel to that shore of which we know nothing,\nthough day and night we hear the waves that bear us forward break yonder\non its beach. They talked for long, and ever while they talked Juanna\ngrew gentler and more human, as the barriers of pride melted in the fire\nof her passion and the shadow of death gathered thicker upon her and the\nman she loved. At length her strength gave way utterly and she wept upon\nLeonard's breast like some frightened child, and from weeping sank into\ndeep slumber or swoon, he knew not which. Then he kissed her upon the\nforehead, and, carrying her to her bed, laid her down to rest awhile\nbefore she died, returning himself to the throne-room.\n\nHere he found Francisco and Otter.\n\n\"Look, Baas,\" said the dwarf, producing from beneath his goat-skin cloak\nan article which he had employed the last hour in constructing. It was\na fearful and a wonderful instrument, made out of the two sacrificial\nknives that had been left by the priests on the occasion of the\nkidnapping of the last of the Settlement men. The handles of these\nknives Otter had lashed together immovably with strips of hide, forming\nfrom them a weapon two feet or more in length, of which the curved\npoints projected in opposite directions.\n\n\"What is that for, Otter?\" said Leonard carelessly, for he was thinking\nof other things.\n\n\"This is for the Crocodile to eat, Baas; I have seen his brothers caught\nlike that before in the marshes of the Zambesi,\" replied the dwarf with\na grin. \"Doubtless he thinks to eat me, but I have made another food\nready for him. Ah! of one thing I am sure, that if he comes out there\nwill be a good fight, whoever conquers in the end.\"\n\nThen he proceeded to fix a hide rope to the handles of the knives, and\nhaving made it fast about his body with a running noose, he coiled its\nlength, which may have measured some thirty feet, round and round his\nmiddle, artfully concealing its bulk together with the knives beneath\nhis cloak and _moocha_.\n\n\"Now I am a man again, Baas,\" the dwarf said grimly. \"I have done with\ndrink and such follies to which I took in my hours of idleness, for the\ntime has come to fight. Ay, and I shall win, Baas; the waters are my\nhome, and I do not fear crocodiles however big--no, not one bit; for, as\nI told you, I have killed them before. You will see, you will see.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that I shall do nothing of the sort, Otter,\" answered\nLeonard sadly, \"but I wish you luck, my friend. If you get out of this\nmess, they will think you a god indeed, and should you only find the\nsense to avoid drink, you may rule here till you die of old age.\"\n\n\"There would be no pleasure in that, Baas, if you were dead,\" answered\nthe dwarf with a heavy sigh. \"Alas! my folly has helped to bring you\ninto this trouble, but this I swear, that if I live--and my spirit tells\nme that I shall not die to-night--it will be to avenge you. Fear not,\nBaas; when I am a god again, one by one I will kill them all, and when\nthey are dead, then I will kill myself and come to look for you.\"\n\n\"It is very kind of you, Otter, I am sure,\" said Leonard with something\nlike a laugh, and at that moment the curtains swung aside and Soa stood\nbefore them accompanied by four armed priests.\n\n\"What do you want, woman?\" exclaimed Leonard, springing towards her as\nthough by instinct.\n\n\"Go back, Deliverer!\" she said, holding up her hand and addressing him\nin the Sisutu tongue, which of course those with her did not understand.\n\"I am guarded, and my death would be quickly followed by your own.\nMoreover, it would avail you little to kill me, since I come to bring\nyou hope for the life of her you love and for your own. Listen: the sun\nwill not shine to-morrow at the dawn; already the mist gathers thick\nand it will hold, therefore the Shepherdess and the Dwarf will be\nhurled from the head of the statue, while you and the Bald-pate, having\nwitnessed their end, will be kept alive till the autumn sacrifice, then\nto be offered up with the other victims.\"\n\n\"Why do you come to tell us all this, woman?\" said Leonard, \"seeing that\nwe knew it already--that is, except the news of the postponement of\nour own fate, which I for one do not desire. What hope is there in this\nstory? If you have nothing better to say, get you gone, traitress, and\nlet us see your hateful face no more.\"\n\n\"I have something more to say, Deliverer. I still love the Shepherdess\nas you love her, and,\" she added with emphasis, \"as Bald-pate yonder\nalso loves her. Now this is my plan: two must die at dawn, but of those\ntwo the Shepherdess need not be one. The morning will be misty, the\nstatue of the god is high, and but few of the priests will see the\nvictim shrouded in her black robe. What if a substitute can be found so\nlike to her in shape and height and feature that, in the twilight and\nbeneath the shadow of the hood, none shall know them apart?\"\n\nLeonard started. \"Who can be found?\"\n\nSlowly Soa raised her thin hand and pointed to Francisco.\n\n\"_There stands the man!_\" she said. \"Were he wrapped in the cloak of\nAca, who would know him from the Shepherdess? The pool and the Snake do\nnot give back that which they have swallowed.\"\n\nIf Leonard had started before, now he fairly recoiled, as the full\nmeaning of this terrible proposition possessed his mind. He looked at\nFrancisco, who stood by wondering, for the priest did not understand the\nSisutu dialect.\n\n\"Tell him,\" she said.\n\n\"Wait awhile,\" he answered hoarsely; \"supposing that this were carried\nout, what would happen to the Shepherdess?\"\n\n\"She would be concealed in the dungeons of the temple, in his dress and\nunder his name,\" and again she pointed to Francisco, \"until such time\nas a chance could be found for her to escape, or to return to rule this\npeople unquestioned and with honour. My father alone knows of this plot,\nand because of his love for me he suffers me to try it, desperate as it\nseems. Also, for I will tell you all the truth, he is himself in\ndanger, and he believes that by means of the Shepherdess--who, when she\nreappears having survived the sacrifice, will be held by the people to\nbe immortal--he may save his life when the day of his own trial comes.\"\n\n\"And do you think,\" said Leonard, \"that I will trust her alone to\nyou, wicked and forsworn as you are, and to the tender mercies of your\nfather? No, it is better that she should die and have done with her\nfears and torments.\"\n\n\"I did not ask you to do so, Deliverer,\" said Soa quietly. \"You will be\ntaken with her, and if she lives you will live also. Is that not enough?\nThese men here come to bear you and Bald-pate to the dungeons: they will\nbear you and the Shepherdess, knowing no difference, that is all. Now\ntell him; perchance he may not be willing to accept.\"\n\n\"Francisco, come here,\" said Leonard in a low voice, speaking in\nPortuguese. Then he told him all, while Soa watched them with her\nglittering eyes. As the tale went on the priest turned ashen pale and\ntrembled violently, but before it was finished he ceased to tremble, and\nLeonard, looking at his face, saw that it was alight as with a glory.\n\n\"I accept,\" he said in a clear voice, \"for thus will it be given to me\nto save the life of the Senora, and to atone for my offence. Come, let\nme make ready.\"\n\n\"Francisco,\" muttered Leonard, for his emotion would not suffer him to\nspeak aloud, \"you are a saint and a hero. I wish that I could go\nthrough this in your stead, for most gladly would I do so, but it is not\npossible.\"\n\n\"It seems then that there are two saints and heroes,\" replied the priest\ngently. \"But why talk thus? It is the bounden duty of either or both of\nus to die for her, yet it is far better that I should die leaving you\nalive to love and comfort her.\"\n\nLeonard thought a moment. \"I suppose it must be so,\" he said, \"but\nHeaven knows, it is a terrible alternative. How can I trust that woman\nSoa? And yet if I do not trust her Juanna will be killed at once.\"\n\n\"You must take the chance of it,\" answered Francisco; \"after all she is\nfond of her mistress, and it was because she grew jealous that she fled\nto Nam and betrayed us.\"\n\n\"There is another thing,\" said Leonard; \"how are we to get Juanna away?\nIf once she suspects the plot, there will be an end of it. Soa, come\nthither.\"\n\nShe came, and he put this question to her, telling her at the same time\nthat Francisco consented to the scheme and that Juanna slept behind the\ncurtain and might awake at any moment.\n\n\"I have that with me which shall overcome the difficulty, Deliverer,\"\nanswered Soa, \"for I foresaw it. See here,\" and she drew a small gourd\nfrom her dress, \"this is that same water of which Saga gave your black\ndog to drink when I escaped you. Now mix it with some spirit, go to the\nShepherdess, awake her, and bid her drink this to comfort her. She will\nobey, and immediately deep sleep will take her again that shall hold her\nfast for six hours.\"\n\n\"It is not a poison?\" asked Leonard suspiciously.\n\n\"No, it is not a poison. What need would there be to poison one who must\ndie at dawn?\"\n\nThen Leonard did as she told him. Taking a tin pannikin, one of their\nfew possessions, he emptied the sleeping-draught into it and added\nenough native brandy to colour the water.\n\nNext he went into Juanna's room and found her lying fast asleep upon\nthe great bed. Going up to her he touched her gently on the shoulder,\nsaying, \"Wake, my love.\" She raised herself and opened her eyes.\n\n\"Is that you, Leonard?\" she said. \"I was dreaming that I was a girl\nagain and at school at Durban, and that it was time to get up for early\nservice at the church. Oh! I remember now. Is it dawn yet?\"\n\n\"No, dear, but it soon will be,\" he answered; \"here, drink this, it will\ngive you courage.\"\n\n\"How horrid that spirit tastes!\" she said, then sank back slowly on the\ncushion and in another minute fell sound asleep again. The draught was\nstrong and it worked quickly.\n\nLeonard went to the curtain and beckoned to Soa and the others. They\nall entered except the priests, who remained clustered together near the\ndoorway of the great chamber talking in low tones and apparently taking\nno notice of what passed.\n\n\"Take off that robe, Bald-pate,\" said Soa; \"I must give you another.\"\n\nHe obeyed, and while Soa was engaged in clothing Juanna's senseless form\nin the gown of the priest, Francisco drew his diary from the pocket in\nhis vest where he kept it. Rapidly he wrote a few lines on a blank page,\nthen shutting the book he handed it to Leonard together with his rosary,\nsaying:\n\n\"Let the Senora read what I have written here, after I am dead, not\nbefore, and give her these beads in memory of me. Many is the time that\nI have prayed for her upon them. Perhaps she will wear them after I am\ngone, and, although she is a Protestant, sometimes offer up a prayer for\nme.\"\n\nLeonard took the book and the rosary and placed them in an inner pocket.\nThen he turned to Otter and rapidly explained to him the meaning of all\nthat was being done.\n\n\"Ah, Baas,\" said the dwarf, \"put no faith in that she-devil. And yet\nperhaps she will try to save the Shepherdess, for she loves her as a\nlioness loves her young. But I am afraid for you, Baas, for you she\nhates.\"\n\n\"Never mind about me, Otter,\" answered Leonard. \"Listen: they are going\nto hide us in the dungeons of the temple; if by any chance you escape,\nseek out Olfan and try to rescue us. If not, farewell, and may we meet\nagain in another place.\"\n\n\"Oh! Baas, Baas,\" said Otter with a deep sob, \"for myself I care\nnothing, nor whether I live or die, but it is sad to think that you will\nperish alone, and I not with you. Oh! why did Baas Tom dream that evil\ndream? Had it not been for him, we might have been transport-riding in\nNatal to-day. I would that I had been a better servant to you, Baas, but\nit is too late now.\" And as he spoke Leonard felt a great tear fall upon\nhis hand.\n\n\"Never mind the servant, Otter,\" he answered; \"you are the best friend,\nblack or white, that ever I had, and Heaven reward you for it. If you\ncan help the Baas yonder at the last, do so. At the least see that he\nswallows the medicine in time, for he is weak and gentle and not fitted\nto die such a death,\" and he turned away.\n\nBy this time Soa had arrayed Francisco in the black robe of Aca. The\nwhite dress worn in the temple ceremonies he did not put on, for it\nremained upon Juanna, completely hidden from sight, however, by the\npriest's gown.\n\n\"Who would know them apart now?\" asked Soa triumphantly, then added,\nhanding Leonard the great ruby which she had taken from Juanna's\nforehead, \"Here, Deliverer, this belongs to you; do not lose the stone,\nfor you have gone through much to win it.\"\n\nLeonard took the gem and at first was minded to dash it into the\nold woman's sneering face, but remembering the uselessness of such a\nperformance, he thrust it into his pocket together with the rosary.\n\n\"Come, let us be going,\" said Soa. \"You must carry the Shepherdess,\nDeliverer; I will say that it is Bald-pate who has fainted with fear.\nFarewell, Bald-pate; after all you are a brave man, and I honour you for\nthis deed. Keep the hood well about your face, and if you would preserve\nthe Shepherdess alive, be silent, answering no word whoever addresses\nyou, and uttering no cry however great your fear.\"\n\nFrancisco went to the bed where Juanna lay, and holding out his hand\nabove her as though in blessing, he muttered some words of prayer or\nfarewell. Then turning, he clasped Leonard in his arms, kissed him and\nblessed him also.\n\n\"Good-bye, Francisco,\" said Leonard in a choking voice; \"surely the\nKingdom of Heaven is made up of such as you.\"\n\n\"Do not weep, my friend,\" answered the priest, \"for there in that\nkingdom I hope to greet you and her.\"\n\nAnd so these friends parted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nTHE WHITE DAWN\n\nLifting Juanna in his arms, Leonard hurried from the sleeping apartment\nto the throne-room, where he halted hesitating, for he did not know what\nwas to happen next. Soa, who had preceded him, surrounded by the four\npriests and with a torch in her hand, stood against that wall of the\nchamber where she had lain bound on the night of the drugging of Otter.\n\n\"Bald-pate has fainted with fear, he is a coward,\" she said to the\npriests, pointing to the burden in Leonard's arms; \"open the secret way,\nand let us pass on.\"\n\nThen a priest came forward, and pressed upon a stone in the wall, which\ngave way, leaving a space sufficiently large for him to insert his hand\nand pull upon some hidden mechanism with all his force. Thereon a piece\nof the wall swung outward as though upon a pivot, revealing a flight of\nsteps, beyond which ran a narrow passage. Soa descended first, bearing\nthe light, which she was careful to hold in such a way as to keep the\nfigure of Leonard, and the burden that he bore, in comparative darkness.\nAfter her went two priests, followed by Leonard, carrying Juanna, the\nrear being brought up by the remaining priests, who closed the secret\ndoor behind them.\n\n\"So that is how it is done,\" thought Leonard to himself, turning his\nhead to watch the process, no detail of which escaped him.\n\nOtter, who had followed Leonard from Juanna's chamber, saw them go,\nthough from some little distance, for, like a cat, the dwarf could see\nin the dark. When the rock had closed again, he returned to Francisco,\nwho sat upon the bed lost in prayer or thought.\n\n\"I have seen how they make a hole in the wall,\" he said, \"and pass\nthrough it. Doubtless our comrades, the Settlement men, went that way.\nSay, shall we try it?\"\n\n\"What is the use, Otter?\" answered the priest. \"The road leads only to\nthe dungeons of the temple; if we got so far we should be caught there,\nand everything would be discovered, including this trick,\" and he\npointed to the robes of Aca, which he wore.\n\n\"That is true,\" said Otter. \"Come, then, let us go and sit upon the\nthrones and wait till they fetch us.\"\n\nSo they went to the great chairs and sat themselves down in them,\nlistening to the tramp of the guards outside the doorway. Here Francisco\nresumed his prayers, while Otter sang songs of the deeds that he had\ndone, and more especially a very long one which he had composed upon the\ntaking of the slave camp--\"to keep his heart alive,\" as he explained to\nFrancisco.\n\nA quarter of an hour passed and the curtains were drawn aside, admitting\na band of priests, headed by Nam, and bearing two litters.\n\n\"Now silence, Otter,\" whispered Francisco, drawing his hood over his\nface.\n\n\"Here sit the gods,\" said Nam, waving the torch that he carried towards\nthe two quiet figures on the thrones. \"Descend, ye gods, that we may\nbear you to the temple and seat you in a lofty place, whence ye shall\nwatch the glories of the rising sun.\"\n\nThen, without more ado, Otter and Francisco came down from their seats,\nand took their places in the litters. Presently they felt themselves\nbeing borne forward at a considerable speed. When they were outside the\npalace gates Otter peeped through the curtain in the hope of perceiving\nsome change in the weather. In vain; the mist was denser than usual,\nalthough it grew grey with the light of the coming dawn. Now they were\nat those gates of the temple that were nearest to the colossal idol, and\nhere, at the mouth of one of the numerous underground passages, guards\nassisted them to descend.\n\n\"Farewell, Queen,\" whispered the voice of Olfan into Francisco's ear;\n\"I would have given my life to save you, but I have failed; as it is, I\nlive to avenge you upon Nam and all his servants.\"\n\nFrancisco made no answer, but pressed on down the passage holding his\nhead low. Soon they were at the foot of the idol, and, led by priests,\nbegan to ascend the stairway in the interior of the statue. Up they\ntoiled slowly in the utter darkness; indeed, to Francisco this, the last\njourney of his life, seemed the longest.\n\nAt length they emerged upon the head of the colossus, where neither of\nthem had been before. It formed a flat platform about eight feet square,\nquite unprotected at the edges, beneath which curved the sheer outlines\nof the sculptured head. The ivory throne whereon Juanna had sat when\nfirst she visited the temple was gone, and instead of it, placed at\nthe very verge of the forehead, were two wooden stools upon which the\nvictims must seat themselves. From this horrible elevation could be seen\nthat narrow space of rock between the feet of the colossus and the wall\nof the pool where was the stone altar, although, owing to the slope of\nthe bowed head, he who stood upon it almost overhung the waters of the\nwell.\n\nOtter and Francisco seated themselves on the stools, and behind them Nam\nand three other priests took their stand, Nam placing himself in such\na position that his companions could not see anything of Francisco's\nslight form, which they believed to be that of the Shepherdess.\n\n\"Hold me, Otter,\" whispered Francisco. \"My senses will leave me, and I\nshall fall.\"\n\n\"Shut your eyes and lean back, then you will see nothing,\" answered\nOtter. \"Moreover, make ready your medicine, for the time is at hand.\"\n\n\"It is ready,\" he answered. \"May I be forgiven the sin, for I cannot\nbear to be hurled living to the Snake!\"\n\nOtter made no answer, but set himself to watch the scene beneath him.\nThe temple was filled with mist that from the great height looked like\nsmoke, and through this veil he could just distinguish the black and\nmoving mass of the vast assembly, who had sat the long night through\nwaiting to witness the consummation of the tragedy, while the sound of\ntheir voices as they spoke together in hushed tones reached him like\nthat of the murmuring of distant waters. Behind him stood the four\npriests or executioners in a solemn, silent line, their eyes fixed\nupon the grey mist, while above them, around them, and beneath them was\nnothing but sheer and giddy space.\n\nIt was a hideous position, heightened by every terror that man and\nnature can command, and even the intrepid dwarf, who feared neither\ndeath nor devil, and over whom religious doubts had no power, began to\nfeel its chilling influence grip his heart. As for Francisco, such\nmind as he had left to him was taken up with fervent prayer, so it is\npossible that he did not suffer so much as might have been expected.\n\nFive minutes or more passed thus; then a voice spoke from the mist\nbelow, saying:\n\n\"Are those who are named Aca and Jal on high, O priest?\"\n\n\"They are on high,\" answered Nam.\n\n\"Is it the hour of dawn, O priest?\" said the voice again, and this time\nOtter knew it for that of the spokesman of the elders.\n\n\"Not yet awhile,\" answered Nam, and he glanced at the snow peak that\ntowered thousands of feet into the air behind and above the temple.\n\nIndeed every eye in that assembly was staring at this peak, although its\ngigantic outline could only be seen dimly through the mist, dimly as\nthe shape of a corpse buried in a winding-sheet of snow. Here, upon the\nloftiest precipices of the mountain the full light of morning struck\nfirst and struck always, for their pinnacles soared far above the level\nof the mist wreaths, and by the quality of that light this people judged\nthe weather of the new-born day. If the snow was rosy-red, then they\nknew that ere long the sun would shine upon them. If, on the other hand,\nit gleamed cold and white, or, still worse, grey, it was a sign that the\ncoming day would be misty in the city and on the plains. Therefore in\nthis, the hour of the trial of the gods whom they had set up, all that\ncompany watched the mountain peak as they had never watched before, to\nsee if it should show white or red.\n\nVery gradually the light increased, and it seemed to Otter that the mist\nwas somewhat thinner than was usual at this hour, though as yet it hung\ndensely between them and the mountain snows. Now he could trace the\nwalls of the amphitheatre, now he could see the black shimmer of the\nwater beneath, and distinguish the glitter of many hundreds of upturned\neyeballs as they glared at him and beyond him. The silence grew more and\nmore intense, for none spoke or moved: all were waiting to see the dawn\nbreak upon the slope of snow, and wondering--would it be red or white?\nMust the gods die or live? So intense and fearful was the hush, unbroken\nby a breath of air or the calling of a bird, that Otter could bear it no\nlonger, but suddenly burst into song.\n\nHe had a fine deep voice, and it was a Zulu war-song that he sang, a\ntriumphant paean of the rush of conquering impis interspersed with the\nwails of women and the groans of the dying. Louder and louder he sang,\nstamping his naked feet upon the rock, while the people wondered at the\nmarvel. Surely this was a god, they thought, who chanted thus exultingly\nin a strange tongue while men waited to see him cast into the jaws of\nthe Snake. No mortal about to die so soon and thus terribly could find\nthe heart to sing, and much less could he sing such a song as that they\nheard.\n\n\"He is a god,\" cried a voice far away, and the cry was echoed on every\nside till at length, suddenly, men grew silent, and Otter also ceased\nfrom his singing, for he had turned his head and seen. Lo! the veil of\nmist that hid the mountain's upper heights grew thin:--it was the moment\nof dawn, but would it be a red dawn or a white? As he looked the vapours\ndisappeared from the peak, though they still lay thick upon the slopes\nbelow, and in their place were seen its smooth and shining outlines\nclothed in a cloak of everlasting snows.\n\nThe ordeal was ended. No touch of colour, no golden sunbeam or crimson\nshadow stained the ghastly surface of those snows, they were pallid as\nthe faces of the dead.\n\n\"A white dawn! A white dawn!\" roared the populace. \"Away with the false\ngods! Hurl them to the Snake!\"\n\n\"It is finished,\" whispered Otter again into Francisco's ear; \"now take\nyour medicine, and, friend, farewell!\"\n\nThe priest heard and, clasping his thin hands together, turned his\ntormented face, in which the soft eyes shone, upwards towards the\nheavens. For some seconds he sat thus; then Otter, peering beneath his\nhood, saw his countenance change, and once more a glory seemed to shine\nupon it as it had shone when, some hours since, Francisco promised to do\nthe deed that now he was about to dare.\n\nAgain there was silence below, for the spokesman of the Council of\nElders had risen, and was crying the formal question to the priests\nabove:\n\n\"Is the dawn white or red, ye who stand on high?\"\n\nNam turned and looked upon the snow.\n\n\"The dawn is fully dawned and it is white!\" he answered.\n\n\"Be swift,\" whispered Otter into Francisco's ear.\n\nThen the priest raised his right hand to his lips, as though to partake\nof the sacrament of death.\n\nA moment later and he let it fall with a sigh, whispering back to Otter:\n\"I cannot, it is a deadly sin. They must kill me, for I will not kill\nmyself.\"\n\nBefore the dwarf could answer, Nature, more merciful than his\nconscience, did that for Francisco which he refused to do for himself,\nfor of a sudden he swooned. His face turned ashen and slowly he began to\nsink backwards, so that he would have fallen had not Nam, who saw that\nhe had fainted with fear, caught him by the shoulders and held him\nupright.\n\n\"The dawn is white! We see it with our eyes,\" answered the spokesmen of\nthe elders. \"O ye who stand on high, cast down the false gods according\nto the judgment of the People of the Mist.\"\n\nOtter heard and knew that the moment had come to leap, for now he need\ntrouble himself with Francisco no more.\n\nSwiftly he turned his head, looking at Nam, for he would know if he\nmight carry out a purpose that he had formed. It was to seize the high\npriest and bear him to the depths below.\n\nIt was not possible, he was out of reach; moreover, were he to snatch\nNam away, Francisco would fall backwards, and the others might see that\nthis was not the Shepherdess. Otter stood up upon his feet, and kicking\nthe stool on which he had sat off the platform, he watched its flight.\nIt flew into the water, never touching the rock, and then the dwarf knew\nthat he had planned well.\n\nNow Nam and one priest seized the fainting form of Francisco and the\nother two stepped towards Otter. The dwarf waited till their hands were\noutstretched to grasp him, then suddenly he sprang at the man upon his\nright, and shouting \"Come thou with me,\" he gripped him about the middle\nin his iron grasp, and, putting out all his strength, hurled himself and\nhis burden into sheer space beneath.\n\nThe priest shrieked aloud, and a gasp of wonder went up from the\nwatching thousands as the dwarf and his victim rushed downward like a\nstone. They cleared the edge of the pool by an inch or two--no more, and\nstruck the boiling waters, sinking through them till Otter thought they\nwould never rise again. But at last they did rise. Then Otter loosed the\ndead or senseless priest, and at that moment the body of Francisco, cast\nthither by Nam, struck the water beside him and straightway vanished for\never.\n\nOtter loosed his grip, and diving beneath the surface swam hard for the\nnorth side of the pool, for there he had noticed that the current was\nleast strong, and there also the rock bank overhung a little. He reached\nit safely, and rising once more grasped a knob of rock with one hand,\nand lay still where in the shadow and the swirl of waters he could not\nbe discovered by any watching from above. He breathed deeply and moved\nhis limbs; it was well, he was unhurt. The priest whom he had taken with\nhim, being heaviest, had met the water first, so that though the leap\nwas great the shock had been little.\n\n\"Ha!\" said Otter to himself, \"thus far my Spirit has been with me, and\nhere I could lie for hours and never be seen. But there is still the\nSnake to contend with,\" and hastily he seized the weapon that he had\nconstructed out of the two knives, and unwound a portion of the cord\nthat was fast about his middle. Then again he looked across the surface\nof the waters. Some ten fathoms from him, in the exact centre of the\nwhirlpool, the body of the priest was still visible, for the vortex bore\nit round and round, but of Francisco there was nothing to be seen. Only\nthirty feet above him Otter could see lines of heads bending over the\nrocky edges of the pool and gazing at the priest as he was tossed about\nlike a straw in an eddy.\n\n\"Now, if he is still there and awake,\" thought Otter, \"surely the father\nof crocodiles will take this bait; therefore I shall do best to be still\nawhile and see what happens.\"\n\nAs he reflected thus a louder shout than any he had heard before reached\nhis ears from the multitude in the temple above him, so tumultuous a\nshout indeed, that for a few moments even the turmoil of the waters was\nlost in it.\n\n\"Now what chances up there, I wonder?\" thought Otter again. Then his\nattention was diverted in a somewhat unpleasant fashion.\n\nThis was the cause of that shout: a miracle, or what the People of the\nMist took to be a miracle, had come about; for suddenly, for the first\ntime within the memory of man, the white dawn had changed to red.\nBlood-red was the snow upon the mountain, and lo! its peaks were turned\nto fire.\n\nFor a while all those who witnessed this phenomenon stood aghast, then\nthere arose that babel of voices which had reached the ears of Otter as\nhe lurked under the bank of rock.\n\n\"The gods have been sacrificed unjustly,\" yelled the people. \"They are\ntrue gods; see, the dawn is red!\"\n\nThe situation was curious and most unexpected, but Nam, who had been a\nhigh priest for more than fifty years, proved himself equal to it.\n\n\"This is a marvel indeed!\" he cried, when silence had at length been\nrestored; \"for no such thing is told of in our history as that a white\ndawn upon the mountain should turn to red. Yet, O People of the Mist,\nthose whom we thought gods have not been offered up wrongfully. Nay,\nthis is the meaning of the sign: now are the true gods, Aca and Jal,\nappeased, because those who dared to usurp their power have gone down to\ndoom. Therefore the curse is lifted from the land and the sunlight has\ncome back to bless us.\"\n\nAs he finished speaking, again the tumult broke out, some crying this\nthing and some that. But no action was taken, for Nam's excuse was ready\nand plausible, and the minds of men were confused. So the assembly broke\nup in disorder; only the priests and as many more as could find place,\nOlfan among them, crowded round the edges of the pool to see what\nhappened in its depths.\n\nMeanwhile Otter had seen that which caused him to think no more of the\nshouting above him than of the humming of last year's gnats. Suffering\nhis eyes to travel round the circumference of the rocky wall, he saw\nthe mouth of a circular hole, situated immediately under the base of\nthe idol, which may have measured some eight feet in diameter. The lower\nedge of this hole stood about six inches above the level of the pool,\nand water ran out of it in a thin stream. Passing down this stream,\nhalf swimming and half waddling, appeared that huge and ungainly reptile\nwhich was the real object of the worship of the People of the Mist.\n\nGreat as were its length and bulk, the dwarf saw it but for a few\nmoments, so swift were its movements; then the creature vanished into\nthe deep waters, to reappear presently by the side of the dead priest,\nwho was now beginning to sink. Its horrible head rose upon the waters as\non that night when the woman had been thrown to it; it opened its huge\njaws, and, seizing the body of the man across the middle, it disappeared\nbeneath the foam. Otter watched the mouth of the hole, and not in vain;\nfor before he could have counted ten the monster was crawling through\nit, bearing its prey into the cave.\n\nNow once more the dwarf felt afraid, for the Snake, or rather the\ncrocodile, at close quarters was far more fearful than anything that his\nimagination had portrayed. Keeping his place beneath the ledge, which,\nexcept for the coldness of the water, he found himself able to do with\nlittle fatigue or difficulty, Otter searched the walls of the pool,\nseeking for some possible avenue of escape, since his ardour for\npersonal conflict with this reptile had evaporated. But search as he\nwould he could find nothing; the walls were full thirty feet high, and\nsloped inwards, like the sides of an inverted funnel. Wherever the exits\nfrom the pool might be, they were invisible; also, notwithstanding his\nstrength and skill, Otter did not dare to swim into the furious eddy to\nlook for them.\n\nOne thing he noticed, indeed: immediately above the entrance to the\ncrocodile's den, and some twenty feet from the level of the water, two\nholes were pierced in the rock, six feet or so apart, each measuring\nabout twelve inches square. But these holes were not to be reached, and\neven if reached they were too small to pass, so Otter thought no more of\nthem.\n\nNow the cold was beginning to nip him, and he felt that if he stayed\nwhere he was much longer he would become paralyzed by it, for it was fed\nfrom the ice and snow above. Therefore, it would seem that there was but\none thing to do--to face the Water Dweller in his lair. To this, then,\nOtter made up his mind, albeit with loathing and a doubtful heart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nHOW OTTER FOUGHT THE WATER DWELLER\n\nKeeping himself carefully under the overshadowing edge of the rock-bank,\nand holding his double-bladed knife ready in one hand, Otter swam to the\nmouth of the Snake's den. As he approached it he perceived by the great\nupward force of the water that the real body of the stream entered\nthe pool from below, the hole where the crocodile lived being but a\nsupplementary exit, which doubtless the river followed in times of\nflood.\n\nOtter reached the mouth of the tunnel without any great difficulty, and,\nwatching his chance, he lifted himself on his hands and slipped through\nit quickly, for he did not desire to be seen by those who were gathered\nabove. Nor indeed was he seen, for his red head-dress and the goat-skin\ncloak had been washed away or cast off in the pool, and in that light\nhis black body made little show against the black rock beneath.\n\nNow he was inside the hole, and found himself crouching upon a bed of\nsand, or rather disintegrated rock, brought down by the waters. The\ngloom of the place was great, but the light of the white dawn, which had\nturned to red, was gathering swiftly on the surface of the pool without\nas the mist melted, and thence was reflected into the tunnel. So it\ncame about that very soon Otter, who had the gift, not uncommon among\nsavages, of seeing in anything short of absolute darkness, was able to\nmake out his surroundings with tolerable accuracy. The place in a corner\nof which he squatted was a cave of no great height or width, hollowed in\nthe solid rock by the force of water, as smoothly as though it had been\nhewn by the hand of man: in short, an enormous natural drain-pipe, but\nconstructed of stone instead of earthenware.\n\nIn the bottom of this drain trickled a stream of water nowhere more than\nsix inches in depth, on either side of which, for ten feet or more, lay\na thick bed of debris ground small. How far the cave stretched of course\nhe could not see, nor as yet could he discover the whereabouts of its\nhideous occupant, though traces of its presence were plentiful, for the\nsandy floor was marked with its huge footprints, and the air reeked with\nan abominable stink.\n\n\"Where has this evil spirit gone to?\" thought Otter; \"he must be near,\nand yet I can see nothing of him. Perhaps he lives further up the cave\";\nand he crept a pace or two forward and again peered into the gloom.\n\nNow he perceived what had hitherto escaped him, namely, that some eight\nyards from the mouth of the tunnel a table-shaped fragment of stone rose\nfrom its floor to within six feet of the roof, having on the hither side\na sloping plane that connected its summit with the stream-bed beneath.\nDoubtless this fragment or boulder, being of some harder material than\nthe surrounding rock, had resisted the wear of the rushing river; the\ntop of it, as was shown by the high-water marks on the sides of the\ncave, being above the level of the torrent, which, although it was now\nrepresented only by a rivulet, evidently at certain seasons of the year\npoured down with great force and volume.\n\n\"Here is a bed on which a crocodile might sleep,\" reflected Otter,\ncreeping a little further forward and staring at the mass of rock, and\nmore especially at a triangular-shaped object that was poised on the top\nof the sloping plane, and on something which lay beneath it.\n\n\"Now, if that thing be another stone,\" thought Otter again, \"how comes\nit that it does not slip into the water as it should do, and what is\nthat upon which it rests?\" and he took a step to one side to prevent his\nbody from intercepting any portion of the ray of light that momentarily\nshone clearer and pierced the darkness of the cave to a greater\ndistance.\n\nThen he looked again and almost fell in his horror, for now he could see\nall. The thing that he had taken for a stone set upon the rock-table\nwas the head of the Dweller in the Waters, for there in it, as the light\nstruck on them, two dreadful eyes gleamed with a dull and changing fire.\nMoreover, he discovered what was the object which lay under the throat\nof the reptile. It was the body of that priest whom Otter had taken\nwith him in his leap from the statue, for he could see the dead face\nprojecting on one side.\n\n\"Perhaps if I wait awhile he will begin to eat him,\" reflected the\ndwarf, remembering the habits of crocodiles, \"and then I can attack him\nwhen he rests and sleeps afterwards\"; and, acting on this idea, he stood\nstill, watching the green fire as it throbbed and quivered, waxed and\nwaned in the monster's eyes.\n\nHow long he remained thus Otter never knew; but after a time he became\nconscious that these eyes had taken hold of him and were drawing him\ntowards them, though whether the reptile saw him or not he could not\ntell. For a space he struggled against this unholy fascination; then,\novercome by dread, he strove to fly, back to the pool or anywhere out\nof reach of those devilish orbs. Alas! it was too late: no step could he\nmove backwards, no, not to save his life.\n\nNow he must go on. It was as though the Water Dweller had read his mind,\nand drew its foe towards itself to put the matter to the test. Otter\ntook one step forward--rather would he have sprung again off the head of\nthe colossus--and the eyes glowed more dreadfully than ever, as though\nin triumph.\n\nThen in despair he sank to the ground, hiding his face in his hands and\ngroaning in his heart.\n\n\"This is a devil that I have come to fight, a devil with magic in his\neyes,\" he thought. \"And how can I, who am but a common Knobnose dwarf,\ndo battle against the king of evil spirits, clothed in the shape of a\ncrocodile?\"\n\nEven now, when he could not see them, he felt the eyes drawing him. Yet,\nas they were no longer visible, his courage and power of mind came back\nto him sufficiently to enable him to think again.\n\n\"Otter,\" he said to himself, \"if you stay thus, soon the magic will do\nits work. Your sense will leave you, and that devil will eat you up as a\ncobra devours a meer-cat. Yes, he will swallow you, and his inside will\nbe your grave, and that is no end for one who has been called a god!\nMen, let alone gods, should die fighting, whether it be with other\nmen, with wild beasts, with snakes, or with devils. Think now, if your\nmaster, the Deliverer, saw you crouch thus like a toad before an adder,\nhow he would laugh and say, 'Ho! I thought this man brave. Ho! he talked\nvery loud about fighting the Water Dweller, he who came of a line of\nwarriors; but now I laugh at him, for I see that he is but a cross-bred\ncur and a coward.'\n\n\"Yes, yes, you can hear his words, Otter. Say now, will you bear their\nshame and sit here until you are snapped up and swallowed?\"\n\nThus the dwarf addressed himself, and it seemed to his bewildered brain\nthat the words which he had imagined were true, and that Leonard really\nstood by and mocked him.\n\nAt last he sprang to his feet, and crying, \"Never, Baas!\" so loudly that\nthe cave rang with the echoes of his shout, he rushed straight at the\nfoe, holding the two-bladed knife in his right hand.\n\nThe crocodile, that was waiting for him to fall insensible, as had\never been the custom of the living victims on whom it fixed its baneful\nglare, heard his cry and awoke from its seeming torpor. It lifted its\nhead, fire seemed to flash from its dull eyes, its vast length began to\nstir. Higher and higher it reared its head, then of a sudden it leaped\nfrom the slope of rock, as alligators when disturbed leap from a river\nbank into the water, coming so heavily to the ground that the shock\ncaused the cave to tremble, and stood before the dwarf with its tail\narched upwards over its back.\n\nAgain Otter shouted, half in rage and half in terror, and the sound\nseemed to make the brute more furious.\n\nIt opened its huge mouth as though to seize him and waddled a few paces\nforward, halting within six feet of him. Now the dwarf's chance had\ncome and he knew it, for with the opportunity all his courage and skill\nreturned to him. It was he who sprang and not the crocodile. He sprang,\nhe thrust his arm and the double knife far into the yawning mouth, and\nfor a second held it there, one end pointing upwards to the brain and\none to the tongue beneath. He felt the jaws close, but their rows of\nyellow fangs never touched his arm, for there was that between them\nwhich held them some little space apart. Then he cast himself on one\nside and to the ground, leaving the weapon in the reptile's throat.\n\nFor a few moments it shook its horrible head, while Otter watched\ngasping, for the reek of the brute's breath almost overpowered him.\nTwice it opened its great jaws and spat, and twice it strove to close\nthem. Oh! what if it should rid itself of the knife, or drive it through\nthe soft flesh of the throat? Then he was lost indeed! But this it might\nnot do, for the lower blade caught upon the jawbone, and at each effort\nit drove the sharp point of the upper knife deeper towards its brain.\nMoreover, so good was the steel, and so firm were the hide bindings of\nthe handles, shrunken as they were with the wet, that nothing broke or\ngave.\n\n\"Now he will trample me or dash me to pieces with his tail,\" said Otter;\nbut as yet the Snake had no such mind--indeed, in its agony it seemed to\nhave forgotten the presence of its foe. It writhed upon the floor of the\ncave, lashing the rock with its tail, and gasping horribly the while.\nThen suddenly it started forward past him, and the tough hide rope about\nOtter's middle ran out like the line from the bow of a whale-boat when\nthe harpoon has gone home in the quarry.\n\nThrice the dwarf spun round violently, then he felt himself dragged in\ngreat jerks along the rocky floor, which, happily for him, was smooth.\nA fourth jerk, and once more he was in the waters of the pool, ay, and\nbeing carried to its remotest depths.\n\n\"Now, he is mad,\" thought Otter, \"who ties himself to such a fish as\nthis, for it will drown me ere it dies.\"\n\nHad Otter been any other man, doubtless this would have been so. But\nhe was as nearly amphibious as a human being can be, and could dive and\nswim and hold his breath, yes, and see beneath the surface as well as\nthe animal from which he took his name. Never did such gifts stand their\nowner in better stead than during the minutes of this strange duel.\n\nTwice the tortured reptile sank to the bottom of the pool--and its depth\nwas great--dragging the dwarf after it, though, as it chanced, between\ndives it rose to the surface, giving him time to breathe. A third time\nit dived, and Otter must follow it--on this occasion to the mouth of one\nof the subterranean exits of the water, into which the dwarf was sucked.\nThen the brute turned, heading up the pool with the speed of a hooked\nsalmon, and Otter, who had prayed that the line would break, now prayed\nthat it might hold, for he knew that even he could never hope to swim\nagainst that undertow.\n\nIt held, and once more they rose to the surface, where the reptile\nlay lashing the waters in its pain, blood pouring from its mouth and\nnostrils. Very glad was Otter to be able to breathe again, for during\nthat last rush he had gone near to suffocation. He lifted his head,\ninhaling the air with great gulps, and saw that the banks of the\npool were lined with spectators who shouted and surged in their mad\nexcitement. After that he did not see much more for a while, since just\nthen it seemed to occur to the crocodile for the first time that the man\nalongside of him was the cause of his suffering; at least it wallowed\nround, causing the waters to boil about its horny sides, and charged\nhim. With its fangs it could not bite, therefore it struck at him with\nits tail.\n\nTwice Otter dived, avoiding the blows, but the third time he was not so\nsuccessful, for the reptile followed him into the deep water and dealt\nhim a fearful stroke before he could either sink or rise. He felt the\nrough scales cut into his flesh and a sensation as though every bone in\nhis body was breaking and his eyes were starting from his head. Faintly\nand more faintly he struggled, but in vain, for now life and sense were\nleaving him together, and everything grew black.\n\nBut suddenly there came a change, and Otter knew vaguely that again he\nwas being dragged through the water and over rock. Then darkness took\nhim, and he remembered no more.\n\nWhen the dwarf awoke it was to find himself lying on the floor of the\ncave, but not alone, for by his side, twisted into a last and hideous\ncontortion, lay the Snake god--dead! The upper part of the double knife\nhad worked itself into its brain, and, with a dying effort, it sought\nthe den where it had lived for centuries, dragging Otter with it, and\nthere expired, how or when he knew not. But the dwarf had triumphed.\nBefore him was stretched the ancient terror of the People of the Mist,\nthe symbol and, indeed, the object of their worship, slain by his skill\nand valour.\n\nOtter saw, and, bruised and shaken as he was, his heart swelled with\npride, for had he not done a deed single-handed such as was not told of\nin the stories of his land?\n\n\"Oh! that the Baas were here to see this sight!\" he said, as he crawled\nalong the length of his dead enemy, and seated himself upon its flat\nand loathsome snout. \"Alas! he cannot,\" he added, \"but I pray that my\nwatching spirit may spare my life, that I may live to sing the song of\nthe slaying of the Devil of the People of the Mist. _Wow!_ that was a\nfight. When shall a man see another? And lo! save for many bruises and\nthe cutting of the rope about my middle, I am not greatly hurt, for the\nwater broke the weight of his tail when he smote me with it. After all,\nit is well that the line held, for it served to drag me from the pool as\nit had dragged me into it, otherwise I had surely drowned there.\n\n\"See, though, it is nearly done with,\" and grasping that end of the cord\nwhich hung from the jaws of the crocodile, he broke it with a jerk, for,\nwith the exception of half a strand, it was frayed through by the worn\nfangs.\n\nThen, having rested himself a little, and washed the worst of his hurts\nwith water, Otter set himself to consider the position. First, however,\nhe made an utterly ineffectual effort to extract the great knives.\nTen men could not have moved them, for the upper blade was driven many\ninches deep into the bone and muscles of the reptile's massive head. But\nfor this chance it would have soon shaken itself clear of them; but,\nas it was, every contortion and gnashing of its jaws had only served to\ndrive the steel deeper--up to the hilt, indeed.\n\nAbandoning this attempt, the dwarf crept cautiously to the mouth of the\ncave and peered at the further banks of the pool, whence he could hear\nshouts and see men moving to and fro, apparently in a state of great\nexcitement.\n\n\"Now I am weary of that pool,\" he said to himself, \"and if I am seen\nin it the Great People will surely shoot at me with arrows and kill me.\nWhat shall I do, then? I cannot stay in this place of stinks with the\ndead devil and the bones of those whom he has devoured, until I die of\nhunger. Yet this water must come from somewhere, therefore it seems best\nthat I should follow it awhile, searching for the spot where it enters\nthe cave. It will be dark walking, but the walls and the floor are\nsmooth, so that I shall not hurt myself, and if I find nothing I can\nreturn again and strive to escape from the pool by night.\"\n\nHaving decided upon the adventure, Otter began to carry it out with\ncharacteristic promptness, the more readily, indeed, because his long\nimmersion the water had chilled him, and he felt a weariness creeping\nover him as a result of the terrible struggle and emotions that he had\npassed through.\n\nCoiling the hide ripe about his middle, which was sadly cut by its\nchafing, he started with an uncertain gait, for he was still very weak.\nA few steps brought him to that rock on which he had discovered the\nhead of the reptile, and he paused to examine it. Climbing the sloping\nstone--no easy task, for it was smooth as ice--he came to the table-like\ntop. On its edge lay the body of that priest who had shared his fall\nfrom the head of the colossus.\n\nThen he inspected the surface of the rock, and for the first time\nunderstood how old that monster must have been which he had conquered\nin single combat. For there, where its body had lain from generation to\ngeneration, and perhaps from century to century, the hard material was\nworn away to the depth of two feet or more, while at the top of the\nsloping stone was a still deeper niche, wherein its head reposed as it\nlay keeping its sleepless watch on the waters of the pool.\n\nAround this depression, and strewn about the floor of the cave itself,\nwere the remains of many victims, a considerable number of whom had not\nbeen devoured. In every case, however, the larger bones were broken, and\nfrom this circumstance Otter judged that, although it was the custom of\nthis dreadful reptile to crush the life out of all who were thrown to it\nwith a bite of its fangs, yet, like that of other animals, its appetite\nwas limited, and it was only occasionally that it consumed what it had\nkilled.\n\nThe sight of these remains was so unpleasant and suggestive that even\nOtter, who certainly could not be called squeamish, hastened to descend\nthe rock. As he passed round it his attention was attracted by the\nskeleton of a man who, from various indications, must have been alive\nwithin the last few weeks. The bones were clad in a priest's cloak,\nof which the dwarf, who was trembling with cold, hastened to possess\nhimself. As he picked up the robe he observed beneath it a bag of tanned\nox-hide that doubtless had once been carried by the owner of the cloak.\n\n\"Perhaps he kept food in this,\" thought Otter; \"though what he who came\nto visit the Water Dweller should want with food I cannot guess. At\nthe least it will be bad by now, so I will leave it and be gone. Only a\nvulture would stay for long in this house of the dead.\" Then he started\nforward.\n\nFor a few yards more he had light to guide his steps, but very soon the\ndarkness became complete; still the cave was not difficult to travel,\nfor everywhere the rock was smooth and the water shallow. All that he\nneeded to do was to walk straight on, keeping touch of one side of the\ntunnel with one hand. Indeed he had but two things to fear, that he\nshould fall into some pit and that he might suddenly encounter another\ncrocodile, \"for doubtless,\" thought Otter, \"the devil was married.\"\n\nBut Otter fell into no hole and he saw no crocodile, since, as it\nchanced, the Water Dweller of the People of the Mist was a bachelor.\n\nWhen the dwarf had travelled up a steep slope for rather more than half\nan hour, to his intense joy he saw light before him and hurried towards\nit. Presently he reached the further mouth of the cavern that was almost\nclosed by blocks of ice, among which a little water trickled. Creeping\nthrough an aperture he found himself upon the crest of the impassable\nprecipice at the back of the city, and that before him a vast glacier of\ngreen ice stretched upwards, whereon the sun shone gloriously.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nTRAPPED\n\nIt will be remembered that some hours before Otter found himself in\nthe light of day, after his conquest of the reptile god, Leonard found\nhimself in a very difference place, namely, in a secret passage bearing\nthe senseless form of Juanna in his arms, and being guided by Soa,\nwhither he knew not.\n\nOn they went through various tunnels, of the turnings of which Leonard\ntried to keep count in his mind, till at length Soa ushered him into a\nrock-hewn cell that evidently had been prepared for their reception,\nfor on one side of it stood a bed covered with skin blankets, and on the\nother a table provided with the best food that the country could offer.\nAt a sign from Soa he laid Juanna down upon the bed, whereon the woman\ninstantly threw a blanket over her, so as to hide her face from the\neyes of the curious. Then, of a sudden Leonard felt himself seized from\nbehind, and while his arms were held by two of the priests, a third,\nunder Soa's direction, removed his revolver and hunting knife, which\nweapons were carried away.\n\n\"You treacherous hag!\" said Leonard to Soa, \"be careful lest I kill\nyou.\"\n\n\"To kill me, Deliverer, would be to kill yourself and another. These\nthings are taken from you because it is not safe that you should have\nthem; such toys are not for angry children. Stay,\" she said to a fourth\npriest, \"search his pockets.\"\n\nThe man did as he was ordered, placing everything that Leonard had about\nhim, such as his watch, Francisco's notebook and rosary, and the great\nruby stone, in a little pile upon the table. Presently he came to the\nfragment of poison which was wrapped in a square of kid-skin. Soa took\nit, and after examination said:\n\n\"Why, Deliverer, you have been borrowing medicine that will bring you\nbad luck if you keep it,\" and going to a small aperture in the wall of\nthe cell, she threw the tiny packet out of it, and after it a second\npacket which Leonard recognised as having been taken from Juanna's hair.\n\n\"There, now you cannot hurt yourself,\" she added in Portuguese. \"Let me\ntell you something: so long as you remain quiet all will be well, but\nif you attempt violence or escape, then you shall be bound and placed by\nyourself, also you will bring about the death of the Shepherdess yonder.\nBe warned then by me, White Man, and turn gentle, for remember that my\nday has come at last and you are in my power.\"\n\n\"That is very clear, my estimable friend,\" answered Leonard, controlling\nhis wrath as best he might. \"But for your sake I hope that the hour will\nnever come when you shall be in mine, for then I may remember more than\nyou wish. I do not in the least understand what you are aiming at, nor\ndo I much care so long as a certain person is protected.\"\n\n\"Do not fear, Deliverer, she shall be protected. As you know well, I\nhate you, and yet I keep you alive because without you she might die;\ntherefore, for her sake be careful. Attempt no violence towards me or my\nfather if we visit you alone, for we shall do so in order that she may\nnot be discovered, and the moment that you lift a hand against us will\nbe the beginning of her doom. And now I must leave you for a while,\nfor something passes in the temple which I desire to see. If she awakes\nbefore I return, be careful not to frighten her. Farewell!\"\n\nThen Soa went taking the priests with her, and the massive timber door\nwas closed upon them.\n\nAfter he had restored his various belongings to his pockets, the\nrevolver and the knife which had been removed excepted, Leonard turned\ndown the rug and looked at Juanna, who appeared to be plunged in a deep\nand happy sleep, for there was a smile upon her face. Next he examined\nthe place where they were confined. It had two doors, that by which they\nhad entered and a second of equal solidity. The only other opening was\nthe slit out of which Soa had dropped the poison. It was shaped like an\ninverted loophole, the narrow end facing inward. This aperture attracted\nLeonard's attention, both on account of its unusual form and because\nof the sounds that reached him through it. Of these, the first and\nmost pervading was a noise of rushing water. Then after a while he\ndistinguished a roar as of a multitude shouting, that was repeated again\nand again at intervals. Now he knew where they must be. They were hidden\naway in the rock of the temple, somewhere in the immediate neighbourhood\nof the raging pool that lay in front of the colossus, and these sounds\nwhich he heard were the clamour of the people who watched the fate of\nOtter and Francisco.\n\nThis conviction was terrible enough, but had he known that, as it\nentered his mind, the body of his friend the priest was travelling on\nits last journey within four feet of his eyes, Leonard might have been\neven more prostrated than he was.\n\nFor an hour or more the shouting continued, then followed a silence\nbroken only by the everlasting murmur of the waters without.\n\nWhen Soa departed she had left a fragment of dip made of goat-fat\nburning upon the floor, but very soon this expired, leaving them in\ndarkness. Now, however, light began to flow into the dungeon through the\nslit in the rock, and it seemed to Leonard that the character of this\nlight was clearer than that to which they had been accustomed in this\ngloomy land.\n\nAfter a while Leonard sat down upon a stool, which he placed close to\nJuanna's bed, just where the beam of light pierced the shadows,\nand groaned aloud in the bitterness of his heart. It was over; the\npure-hearted martyr, Francisco, was dead, and with him Otter, his\nfaithful friend and servant. Except Soa, who had become an active\nenemy, at least so far as he was concerned, of all who travelled to this\nhellish country Juanna and he alone were left alive, and sooner or later\nfate must overtake them also. The greatest and last failure of his life\nwas about to be consummated, and he would go down into a nameless\ngrave, there to be lost, having for many years suffered and toiled to no\npurpose, pursuing a chimera.\n\nJuanna still slept heavily under the influence of the drug, and he was\nglad of it, for when she woke it must be to a worse misery than any\nthat had gone before. Partly for something to do, and partly because\nthe cravings of nature made themselves felt even through his sorrows,\nLeonard turned to the table and ate and drank of the viands there,\nthough not without fear that they might be doctored. As the food took\neffect upon him some share of hope and courage entered into his heart,\nfor it is a true saying that a full stomach makes a brave man. After all\nthey two still breathed and were unharmed in body, nor was it absolutely\ncertain that they would be called upon to give up the ghost at present.\nThis was much.\n\nMoreover, he had lived long enough to win the love of the fearless\nand beautiful girl who slept beside him, and though perhaps under such\ncircumstances love, however true and passionate, ceases to occupy a\ncommanding place in a man's heart, even then he felt that this was more,\nand that happier days might dawn when it would be, if not everything, at\nleast most of all.\n\nAs he thought thus, he saw colour creep into Juanna's pale face; then\nshe sighed, opened her eyes, and sat up.\n\n\"Where am I?\" she said, glancing round wildly. \"This is not the bed on\nwhich I lay down. Oh!\" she started, \"is it over?\"\n\n\"Hush, dear, hush! I am with you,\" said Leonard, taking her hand.\n\n\"So I see. But where are the others, and what is this dreadful place?\nAre we buried alive, Leonard? It looks like a tomb.\"\n\n\"No, we are only prisoners. Come, eat and drink something, and then I\nwill tell you the story.\"\n\nShe rose to obey him, and for the first time her eyes fell upon the robe\nshe wore.\n\n\"Why, this is Francisco's! Where is Francisco?\"\n\n\"Eat and drink,\" he repeated.\n\nShe did his bidding mechanically, watching his face the while with\nwondering and frightened eyes.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"tell me. I can bear this no longer. Where are\nFrancisco and Otter?\"\n\n\"Alas! Juanna, they are dead,\" he answered solemnly.\n\n\"Dead,\" she wailed, wringing her hand. \"Francisco dead! Why then are we\nstill live?\"\n\n\"Have courage and listen, Juanna. After you went to sleep in the palace,\nSoa came to us with a plan which we accepted.\"\n\n\"What was the plan?\" she asked hoarsely.\n\nTwice he strove to tell her and twice he failed--the words would not\ncome.\n\n\"Go on. Why do you torment me?\"\n\n\"It was this, Juanna: that Francisco should be dressed in the robe of\nAca, and offered up with Otter in your place, while you were hidden\naway.\"\n\n\"Has it been done?\" she whispered.\n\n\"I believe so,\" Leonard replied, bowing his head to his breast. \"We are\nprisoners in a secret cell beneath the feet of the statue. There has\nbeen great noise and confusion without, and now for some time silence.\"\n\nThen Juanna sprang up and stood over him with flashing eyes.\n\n\"How dared you do this?\" she said. \"Who gave you leave to do it? I\nthought that you were a man, now I see that you are a coward.\"\n\n\"Juanna,\" said Leonard, \"it is useless for you to talk like this.\nWhatever was done was done for your sake, not for that of anybody else.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you say so, but I believe that you made a plot with Soa to\nmurder Francisco in order that you might save your own life. I have done\nwith you. I will never speak to you again.\"\n\n\"You can please yourself about that,\" answered Leonard, who by now was\nthoroughly enraged, \"but I am going to speak to you. Look here, you have\nsaid words to me for which, were you a man, I would do my best to be\navenged upon you. But as you are a woman I can only answer them, and\nthen wash my hands of you. As you must know, or will know when you come\nto your right mind, I would gladly have taken Francisco's place. But it\nwas impossible, for had I attempted to dress myself up in the robe of\nAca, I should instantly have been discovered, and _you_ would have paid\nthe price of my folly. We all knew this, and after we had consulted,\nthings were arranged as I have told you. I only consented to your being\nbrought here on the condition that I was allowed to accompany you for\nyour protection. Now I wish that I had left it alone and gone with\nFrancisco, then perhaps I should have found peace instead of bitter\nwords and reproaches. However, do not be afraid, for I think it probable\nthat I shall soon follow him. I know that you were very fond of this\nman--this hero--and also, either by accident or design, that you had\nsucceeded in making him a great deal too fond of you for his peace of\nmind; therefore I make excuses for your conduct, which, with all such\ndeductions, still remains perfectly intolerable.\"\n\nHe paused and looked at her as she sat on the edge of the couch, biting\nher lip and glancing towards him now and again with a curious expression\non her beautiful face, in which grief, pride, and anger all had their\nshare. Yet at that moment Juanna was thinking not of Francisco and his\nsacrifice, but of the man before her whom she had never loved so well\nas now, when he spoke to her thus bitterly, paying her back in her own\ncoin.\n\n\"I cannot pretend to match you in scolding and violence,\" she said,\n\"therefore I will give up argument. Perhaps, however, when _you_ come\nto your right mind, you will remember that my life is my own, and that I\ngave nobody permission to save it at the cost of another person's.\"\n\n\"What is done, is done,\" answered Leonard moodily, for his anger had\nburnt out. \"Another time I will not interfere without your express wish.\nBy the way, my poor friend asked me to give you these,\" and he handed\nher the rosary and the notebook; \"he has written something for you to\nread on the last sheet of the journal, and he bade me say that, should\nyou live to escape, he hoped that you will wear these in memory of him,\"\nand he touched the beads, \"and also that you would not forget him in\nyour prayers.\"\n\nJuanna took the journal, and holding it to the light, opened it at\nhazard. The first thing that she saw was her own name, for in truth it\ncontained, among many other matters, a record of the priest's unhappy\ninfatuation from the first moment of their meeting, and also of his\npious efforts to overcome it. Turning the pages rapidly she came to the\nlast on which there was any writing. It ran as follows:\n\n\n\"Senora, of the circumstances under which I write these words you will\nlearn in due course. The pages of this journal, should you deign to\nstudy them, will reveal to you my shameful weakness. But if I am a\npriest I am also a man--who soon shall be neither, but, as I hope,\nan immortal spirit--and the man in me, following those desires of the\nspirit that find expression through the flesh, has sinned and loved you.\nForgive me this crime, as I trust it will be forgiven elsewhere, though\nmyself I cannot pardon it. Be happy with that noble gentleman who has\nwon your heart and who himself worships you as you deserve. May you be\nprotected from all the dangers that now surround you, as I think you\nwill, and may the blessing of Heaven be with you and about you for\nmany peaceful years, till at length you come to the peace that passeth\nunderstanding! And when from time to time you think of me, may you in\nyour heart couple my name with certain holy words: 'Greater love hath\nno man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.' Senora,\npardon me and farewell.\"\n\n\nJuanna read this touching and noble-hearted adieu with an ever-growing\nwonder, and when she had finished it, put down the book crying aloud,\n\n\"Oh! what have I done to deserve such devotion as this?\" Then with a\nstrange and bewildering inconsequence she flung herself into Leonard's\narms, and burying her head upon his breast she began to weep.\n\nWhen she was somewhat calmer he also read the letter and closed the\nbook, saying:\n\n\"The world is poorer by a perfect gentleman. He was too good for any of\nus, Juanna.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" she answered.\n\nJust then they heard a sound without the door; it opened, and Nam\nentered accompanied by Soa.\n\n\"Deliverer,\" said the aged priest, whose countenance and troubled eyes\nbore traces of many conflicting emotions, \"and you, Shepherdess, I come\nto speak with you. As you see, I am alone, except for this woman, but\nshould you attempt any violence towards her or me, that will be the\nsignal for your deaths. With much toil and at no little risk to myself\nI have spared the life of the Shepherdess, causing the white man, your\ncompanion, to be offered up in her place.\"\n\n\"Has that offering been accomplished?\" broke in Leonard, who could not\nrestrain his anxiety to learn what had happened.\n\n\"I will be frank with you, Deliverer,\" answered the high-priest, when\nJuanna had translated his question, \"since the truth cannot hurt me, for\nnow we know too much of one another's secrets to waste time in bandying\nlies. I know, for instance, that the Shepherdess and the dwarf are\nno gods, but mortal like ourselves; and you know that I have dared to\naffront the true gods by changing the victim whom they had chosen. The\nsacrifice has been accomplished, but with so many signs and wonders that\nI am bewildered; the People of the Mist are bewildered also, so that\nnone know what to think. The white man, your companion, was hurled\nfainting into the waters when the dawn had broken upon the mountain and\nwas seen to be grey; but the dwarf, your servant, did not wait to have\nthat office done for him, for he sprang thither himself, ay, and took\none with him.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Otter!\" cried Leonard; \"I knew that you would die hard.\"\n\n\"Hard did he die indeed, Deliverer,\" said Nam with a sigh, \"so hard that\neven now many swear that he was a god and not a man. Scarcely had they\nall vanished into the pool when a wonder chanced such as has not\nbeen told of in our records: Deliverer, the white dawn turned to red,\nperchance, as I cried to calm the people, because the false gods had met\ntheir doom.\"\n\n\"Then the true ones must be singularly blind,\" said Juanna, \"seeing that\nI, whom you dare to call a false god, am still alive.\"\n\nThis argument silenced Nam for a moment, but presently he answered.\n\n\"Yes, Shepherdess, you are still alive,\" he said, laying a curious\nemphasis on the \"still.\" \"And, indeed,\" he added hastily, \"if you are\nnot foolish you may long remain so, both of you, for I have no desire to\nshed your blood who only seek to end my last days in peace. But listen\nto the end of the tale: While the people wondered at the omen of the\nchanged dawn, it was seen that the dwarf, your servant, was not dead\nthere in the pool. Yes! this was seen, Deliverer: to and fro in the\ntroubled waters rushed the great Water Dweller, and after him, keeping\npace with him, went that dwarf who was named Otter. Ay, round and round\nand down to the lowest depths, though how it could be that a man might\nswim with the Snake none can say.\"\n\n\"Oh, bravo, Otter!\" said Leonard again, bethinking him of an explanation\nof the mystery which he did not reveal to Nam. \"Well, what was the end\nof it?\"\n\n\"That none know for certain, Deliverer,\" answered the priest\nperplexedly. \"At last the Water Dweller, from whose mouth poured blood,\nwas seen to sink with the dwarf; then he rose again and entered the\ncave, his home. But whether the dwarf entered with him, or no, I cannot\nsay, for some swear one thing and some another, and in the foam and\nshadow it was hard to see; moreover, none will venture there to learn\nthe truth.\"\n\n\"Well, dead or alive, he made a good fight for it,\" said Leonard. \"And\nnow, Nam, what is your business with us?\"\n\nThis question appeared to puzzle the priest a little, for, to speak\ntruth, he did not care to disclose the exact nature of his business,\nwhich was to separate Leonard from Juanna, without force if possible.\n\n\"I came here, Deliverer,\" he answered, \"to tell you what had happened.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Leonard, \"to tell me that you have murdered my best\nfriend, and one who was but lately your god. I thank you for your news,\nNam, and now, if I might make bold to ask it, what are your plans with\nreference to ourselves--I mean until it suits you to send us after our\ncompanions?\"\n\n\"Believe me, Deliverer, my plan is to save your lives. If the others\nhave been sacrificed it was no fault of mine, for there are forces\nbehind me that I cannot control even when I guide them. The land is in\nconfusion and full of strange rumours. I know not what may happen during\nthe next few days, but till they are over you must lie hid. This is a\npoor place in which to dwell, but there is none other safe and secret.\nStill, here is another chamber which you can use; perchance you have\nalready seen it,\" and placing his hand upon what appeared to be a\nlatch, he opened the second door which Leonard had noticed previously,\nrevealing a cell of very similar construction to that in which they\nwere, and of somewhat larger size.\n\n\"See, Deliverer,\" he went on, \"here is the place,\" and he stepped\nforward to enter the cell, then drew back as though in courtesy to allow\nLeonard to pass in before him.\n\nFor once Leonard's caution forsook him, for at the moment he was\nthinking of other things. Almost mechanically he passed the threshold.\nScarcely were his feet over it when he remembered the character of his\nhost and the lodging, and turned quickly to come back.\n\nIt was too late, for even as he turned the heavy timber door closed in\nhis face with a crash, and he was caged.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nNAM'S LAST ARGUMENT\n\nFor a moment Juanna stood stupefied; for the manoeuvre had been so\nsudden that at first she could scarcely realise its results.\n\n\"Now, Shepherdess,\" began Nam blandly, \"we can talk in private, for I\nhave words to say to you which it is not fitting that other ears should\nhear.\"\n\n\"You fiend,\" she answered fiercely; then comprehending that violence or\nremonstrance would be useless, she added, \"Speak on, I hear you.\"\n\n\"Listen, Shepherdess, and for your own sake I implore you, do not give\nway to grief or rage. I swear to you that no harm shall come to yonder\nman if you will but do my bidding. Shepherdess, you are found out; I\nknow, and the people know, that you are no goddess. It had been safer to\nsacrifice you to-day, but partly because of the pleading of my daughter\nwho loves you, and partly for other reasons, I have caused you to be\nsaved alive. Now, Shepherdess, from this country there is no escape; as\nyou have chosen to come hither, here you must remain for life, and in\nthis cell you cannot live and die. Therefore, for my daughter's sake\nI have cast about for a means to deliver you from bonds and to set you\nhigh in the land, ay, almost at its head,\" and he paused.\n\n\"Perhaps you will come to the point,\" said Juanna, who was trembling\nwith fear and anger.\n\n\"It is this, Shepherdess,\" Nam answered bowing; \"although you are\ndethroned as a goddess, you may still shine as a queen and rule over us\nas the wife of our king.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" replied Juanna, turning suddenly cold; \"and how shall I, who\nam held to be dead, appear again as a woman wedded to your king? Surely\nthe people would find that strange, Nam?\"\n\n\"No, Shepherdess, for I have prepared a tale which shall explain the\nwonder, and already its rumour runs from mouth to mouth. It will be said\nthat you were a goddess and therefore immortal, but that for the sake of\nlove you have put off your godhead and put on the flesh, that you might\ndwell for some years with him whom you desire.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Juanna again. \"And what if I refuse to consent to this\nscheme, which, as I think, can have come only from a woman's brain?\" and\nshe pointed to Soa.\n\n\"You are right, Shepherdess,\" answered Soa, \"the plan is mine; I made\nit to save you, and also,\" she added coolly, \"to be revenged upon that\nwhite thief who loves you, for he shall live to see you the wife of\nanother man, a wild man.\"\n\n\"And have you never thought, Soa, that I may have wishes of my own in\nthis matter?\"\n\n\"Doubtless, yet the fairest women cannot always have what they may\nchance to wish. Know, Shepherdess, that this must be both for your own\nsake and for the sake of Nam, my father. Olfan loves you, and in these\ntroubled times it is necessary that Nam and the priests should gain his\nsupport, which has been bought but now by the promise that you will\nbe given to him in marriage on this very day. For you, Shepherdess,\nalthough you might have wished to wed one of your own race, at the least\nyou will rule a queen, and that is better than to perish miserably.\"\n\n\"I think otherwise, Soa,\" Juanna answered calmly, for she saw that\nneither passion nor pleading would help her, \"and of the two I choose to\ndie,\" and she put her hand to her hair, then started, for she found the\npoison gone.\n\n\"You will choose to die, Shepherdess,\" said Soa with a cold smile, \"but\nthis is not always so easy. I have taken your medicine from you while\nyou slept, and here there are no other means to compass death.\"\n\n\"I can starve, Soa,\" replied Juanna with dignity.\n\n\"That takes some time, Shepherdess, and to-day you will become the wife\nof Olfan. Still it is needful that you should yourself consent to marry\nhim, for this chief is so foolish that he declares that he will not wed\nyou till you have accepted him with your own mouth and in the presence\nof witnesses.\"\n\n\"Then I fear that the wedding will not be celebrated,\" said Juanna\nwith a bitter laugh, for she could not refrain from giving some outward\nexpression to all the loathing which she felt for this wicked woman, who\nin her fierce love would save the life of her mistress by selling her to\nshame.\n\n\"I think that it will, Shepherdess,\" answered Soa, \"for it seems that\nwe have a way by which we can win you to speak those words which Olfan\ndesires to hear.\"\n\n\"There is no way, Soa.\"\n\n\"What, none, Shepherdess? Think now: he whom you name Deliverer is a\nprisoner beyond that door. What if his life hangs upon your choice?\nWhat if he were shown to you about to die a fearful death from which you\nalone could save him by speaking a certain word?\"\n\nNow for the first time Juanna fully understood the hideous nature of the\nplot whereby Soa purposed either to force her to become the wife of a\nsavage, or to thrust upon her the guilt of causing the death of the man\nwhom she loved, and she sank back upon the couch, saying:\n\n\"You would have done better to leave me yonder in the slave camp, Soa.\"\n\nThen, abandoning the tone of forced calm in which she had spoken\nhitherto, Soa broke out bitterly:\n\n\"When you were in the slave camp, Shepherdess, you loved me who have\nloved you from a child, for then no white dog had come to sow mischief\nbetween us and to make you hate and distrust me. Then I would have died\nfor you, ay, and this I would do now. But also I would be revenged upon\nthe white dog, for I, who am husbandless and childless, had but this one\nthing, and he has taken it from me. You were to me as mother, and lover,\nand babe are to other women--my all, and now I am left desolate, and\nI will be revenged upon him before I die. But I still love you,\nShepherdess, and could any other plan have been found to help you, I\ncould not have forced this marriage on you. No such plan can be found;\nthus alone can you live and become great and happy; and thus alone can I\ncontinue to feast my eyes upon you, though it be from far.\"\n\nShe ceased, trembling with the strength of the passions that shook her,\nto which indeed her words had given but feeble expression.\n\n\"Go,\" said Juanna, \"I would have time to think.\"\n\nThen Nam spoke again.\n\n\"We go, Shepherdess, in obedience to your wish, but before evening we\nshall return to hear your answer. Do not attempt to work mischief upon\nyourself, for know that you will be watched though you cannot see the\neyes that watch you. If you do but so much as lift a hand against your\nlife, or even strive to cut off the light that flows through yonder\nhole, then at once you will be seized and bound, and my daughter will be\nset to guard you. Shepherdess, farewell.\"\n\nAnd they went, leaving Juanna alone and a prey to such thoughts as can\nscarcely be written.\n\nFor several hours she sat there upon the couch, allowing no hint of what\nshe felt to appear upon her face, for she was too proud to suffer the\neyes which she knew were spying on her, though whence she could not\ntell, to read her secret anguish.\n\nAs she sat thus in her desolation several things grew clear to Juanna,\nand the first of them was that Soa must be mad. The love and hate that\nseethed in her fierce heart had tainted her brain, making her more\nrelentless than a leopard robbed of its young. From the beginning she\nhad detested Leonard and been jealous of him, and incautiously enough he\nhad always shown his dislike and distrust of her. By slow degrees these\nfeelings had hardened into insanity, and to gratify the vile promptings\nof her disordered mind she would hesitate at nothing.\n\nFrom Soa, therefore, she could hope for no relenting. Nor had she\nbetter prospect with Nam, for it was evident that in his case political\nconsiderations operated as strongly as did those of a personal character\nwith his daughter. He was so much involved, he had committed himself so\ndeeply in this matter of the false gods, that, rightly or wrongly, he\nconceived Soa's plan to offer the only feasible chance of escape from\nthe religious complications by which he was surrounded, that threatened\nto bring his life and power to a simultaneous end.\n\nIt was out of the question, therefore, to expect help from the\nhigh-priest, who was in the position of a man on a runaway horse with\nprecipices on either side of him, unless, indeed, she could show him\nsome safer path. Failing this, it would avail her nothing that he hated\nand feared Olfan, and only promoted this marriage in order to bribe the\nking into standing his friend during the expected political convulsions.\nIndeed, as she guessed rightly, Nam would much better like to know her\nsafely over the borders of the Mist-land than to be called upon to greet\nher as its queen. This was obvious, seeing that should she return to\npower, religious or temporal, it was scarcely to be hoped that she would\nforget the wrongs which she had suffered at his hands. The marriage was\nmerely a temporary expedient designed to ward off immediate evil, but\nshould it come about and the crisis be tided over, it was plain that\nthe struggle between the false goddess and the perjured priest must be\ncarried on until it ended in the death of one or both of them. However,\nall these things lay in the future as Nam foretold it, a future which\nJuanna never meant to live to see.\n\nThere remained Leonard and Olfan. The former, of course, was powerless,\nat least for the present, having suffered himself to be entrapped,\nthough his lack of caution mattered little, for doubtless if guile\nhad failed, force would have been employed. It was she who must save\nLeonard, for he could do nothing to save her.\n\nThe more Juanna thought of the matter, the more she became convinced\nthat her only hope lay in Olfan himself, who had sworn friendship to\nher, and who certainly was no traitor. She remembered that in their\nconversation of the day before he had admitted that she could be nothing\nto him while Leonard lived. Probably Nam had told her that the Deliverer\nwas dead, and then it was, actuated by his passion which she knew to\nbe genuine enough, that he had entered into a bargain with the priest.\nThese must be the terms of the compact, that the game of the false gods\nbeing played, Olfan undertook to support Nam and the rest of his party\nto the best of his power, for the consideration to be received of her\nhand in marriage, stipulating, however, that she should give it of her\nown free will.\n\nThis of course she would never do; therefore Olfan's proviso gave her\na loophole of escape, though Juanna was well aware that it would not\nbe wise to rely too implicitly on the generosity of the savage chief in\nmatters upon which savages are apt to be neither generous nor delicate.\nOn this she must fall back as a last resource, or rather as a last\nresource but one. Meanwhile, she would fight Nam and Soa step by step,\nyielding only when she saw that further obstinacy on her part would\ninvolve Leonard's destruction. It was possible, indeed it was probable,\nthat everything might fail her, and in that event she must not fail\nherself; in other words, although the poison had been taken from her,\nshe must find a means of death.\n\nHaving thought these problems out so far as it was in her power to\ndo, Juanna rose and began to walk up and down the cell, noting its\nconstruction and peculiarities. Doubtless Leonard was behind yonder\ndoor, but it was so thick that she could hear nothing of his movements.\nFor the rest, it seemed clear that escape was impossible. Excepting the\ndoors, the shaft in the rock was the only other opening that she was\nable to see, but through this no child could pass, and if he might it\nwould be to fall into the pool of raging water.\n\nHad Otter lived through the fight with the snake god, she wondered?\nThere was small chance of it, but at least he had made an end worthy of\nhis reputation, and she felt proud of him. And the other--Francisco. Of\nhim also she was proud indeed, but for herself she was ashamed, for she\nknew that she had been to blame, though not designedly. Who would have\nguessed that this frail timid man could prove himself such a hero, or\nwho could estimate the power of the unsought and unhappy love which\nenabled him to conquer the fear of death?\n\nShe had been wrong to be angry with Leonard, for she knew well that, if\nit could have been so, he would gladly have given his own life for hers.\nAlas! it seemed that she was always wrong, for her temper was quick and\nthe tongue is an unruly member. They had both of them been ready to die\nfor her, and one of them had done so; well, now it was probable that the\ntables would be turned before many hours were over, and that she would\nbe called upon to offer herself to save her lover. If this came about,\nshe would not forget the example of Francisco, but would rather try to\nequal it in the heroism of her end.\n\nThe day passed slowly, and at length the gloom gathering in the little\ncell told her that night was near. Before it fell, however, Soa and Nam\nentered, bearing candles, which they fixed upon brackets in the walls.\n\n\"We come, Shepherdess, to hear your answer,\" said Nam. \"Will you consent\nto take Olfan for a husband, or will you not?\"\n\n\"I will not consent.\"\n\n\"Think again, Shepherdess.\"\n\n\"I have thought. You have my answer.\"\n\nAt the words Nam seized her arm, saying, \"Come hither, Shepherdess; I\nwould show you something,\" and he led her to that door in passing which\nLeonard had been entrapped. At the same time Soa extinguished one of the\ncandles, and taking the other in her hand she left the cell, bolting the\ndoor behind her, so that Nam and Juanna stood in darkness.\n\n\"Shepherdess,\" said Nam sternly, \"you are about to see him whom you\nname the Deliverer. Now remember this, if you cry out or speak above a\nwhisper--he dies.\"\n\nJuanna made no answer, although she felt her heart grow faint within\nher. Five minutes or more passed, and of a sudden a panel slid back in\nthe upper part of the door which connected the two cells, so that Juanna\ncould see through it, although those who stood on the further side could\nnot see her, for they were in light and she was in darkness.\n\nAnd this was what she saw: Ranged against the wall of the second prison,\nand opposite to her, were three priests holding candles in their hands,\nwhereof the light shone upon their sullen, cruel faces, and the snake's\nhead tattooed on their naked breasts. In front of these men stood two\nother priests, and between them was Leonard bound and gagged.\n\nOn the hither side of the cell, and not more than two feet from the open\npanel, stood Soa, on whom the eyes of the executioners were fixed, as\nthough awaiting a command. Between Soa and these men yawned an open hole\nin the rock floor.\n\nWhen Juanna had gazed upon this scene for some twenty seconds the\nsliding panel was closed, apparently by Soa, and Nam spoke:\n\n\"You have seen, Shepherdess,\" he said, \"that the Deliverer is bound, and\nyou have seen also that before him is a hole in the floor of the prison.\nHe who falls down that hole, Shepherdess, finds himself in the den of\nthe Snake beneath, from the visiting of whom no man has ever returned\nalive, for it is through it that we feed the Water-dweller at certain\nseasons of the year, and when there is no sacrifice. Now, Shepherdess,\nyou must choose between two things; either to wed Olfan of your own free\nwill this night, or to see the Deliverer thrown to the Snake before your\neyes, and afterwards to wed Olfan whether you will it or not. What do\nyou say, Shepherdess?\"\n\nJuanna took counsel with herself, and came to the conclusion that she\nwould resist a little longer, for she thought that this scene might have\nbeen planned merely to try her fortitude.\n\n\"I refuse to marry Olfan,\" she answered.\n\nThen Nam opened the panel and whispered a word into the ear of Soa, who\nuttered a command. Instantly the two executioner priests flung Leonard\non to his back upon the ground, an easy task seeing that his legs were\nfastened with ropes, and dragged him forward until his head hung over\nthe oubliette-like hole. Then they paused as though waiting for some\nfurther order. Nam drew Juanna some few paces away from the door.\n\n\"What is your word now, Shepherdess?\" he said. \"Is the man to die or be\nsaved? Speak swiftly.\"\n\nJuanna glanced through the opening and saw that now Leonard's head and\nshoulders had vanished down the oubliette, while one of the priests held\nhim by the ankles, watching Soa for the sign to let him fall.\n\n\"Loose him,\" said Juanna faintly. \"I will marry Olfan.\"\n\nStepping forward, Nam whispered to Soa, who issued another order.\nThereupon the priests drew Leonard from his perilous position, and,\nunwillingly enough, rolled him to the side of the cell, for they would\nhave preferred to be rid of him. At that moment also the shutter was\nclosed.\n\n\"I said _loose him_,\" repeated Juanna; \"now the man lies unable to move\nlike a fallen tree, on the ground.\"\n\n\"No, Shepherdess,\" replied Nam; \"perchance you may yet change your mind,\nand then it would be troublesome to bind him afresh, for he is very\nstrong and violent. Listen, Shepherdess; when Olfan comes presently to\nask your hand, you must say nothing of that man yonder, for he deems\nhim to be dead, and the moment you speak of him he will be dead. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"I understand,\" answered Juanna, \"but at least the gag might be taken\nfrom his mouth.\"\n\n\"Fear not, Shepherdess, it shall be done--when you have spoken with\nOlfan. And now, at what hour will it be your pleasure to see him?\"\n\n\"When you will. The sooner it is finished the better.\"\n\n\"Good. My daughter,\" he added to Soa, who just then entered the cell,\n\"be pleased to make fire, and then summon the king Olfan, who waits\nwithout.\"\n\nSoa departed upon her errand, and, overcome with terror which she would\nnot show, Juanna sank upon the couch, hiding her face in her hands. For\na while there was silence, then the door opened again and, heralded by\nSoa, Olfan, the king, stood before her.\n\n\"Be careful, Shepherdess,\" whispered Nam as they entered; \"one word--and\nthe Deliverer dies.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nBE NOBLE OR BE BASE\n\nFor a while there was silence, then Juanna looked up, searching Olfan's\nface with her eyes. Nothing was to be read there, for it was impossible\nto pierce the mask of solemn calm beneath which, in common with all\nhis race, the king was accustomed to hide his thoughts. He leant on the\nshaft of his broad spear, his head bowed slightly as though in humility,\nhis dark eyes fixed upon her face, immovable, impassive, a picture of\nsavage dignity.\n\nIndeed, Juanna was fain to confess to herself that she had never seen a\ngrander specimen of the natural man than that presented by the chief of\nthe People of the Mist, as he stood before her in her rock prison. The\nlight of the candles fell full upon him, revealing his great girth and\nstature, beside which those of the finest men of her own race would\nhave seemed insignificant. It shone upon the ivory torques, emblems of\nroyalty, which were about his neck, wrists, and ankles, upon the glossy\ngarments of black goat-skin that hung from his shoulders and middle, and\nthe raven tresses of his hair bound back from his forehead by a narrow\nband of white linen, which showed in striking contrast against the clear\nolive colouring of his face and breast.\n\n\"Speak, Olfan,\" said Juanna at length.\n\n\"It was told to me, Queen,\" he answered in a low, full voice, \"that you\nhad words to say to me. Nevertheless, now as always, I obey you. Queen,\nI learn that your husband, he whom you loved, is dead, and believe me, I\nsorrow for you. In this shameful deed I had no hand; that, together with\nthe end of the other white man and the dwarf, must be set down to the\naccount of this priest, who swears that he was driven to it by the\nclamour of the people. Queen, they have all gone across the mountains\nand through the sky beyond, and you, like some weary dove, far travelled\nfrom a southern clime, are left a prey among the eagles of the People of\nthe Mist.\n\n\"But a few hours since I thought you dead also, for with all the\nthousands in the temple I believed that it was your fair body which Nam\nhurled at dawn from the brow of the statue, and I tell you that when I\nsaw it, I, who am a warrior, wept and cursed myself, because, although\nI was a king, I had no power to save you. Afterwards this man, the high\npriest, came to me, telling me the truth and a plan that he had made for\nhis own ends, whereby you might be saved alive and lifted up among the\npeople, and he also might be saved, and my rule be made sure in the\nland.\" And he ceased.\n\n\"What is this plan, Olfan?\" asked Juanna, after a pause.\n\n\"Queen, it is that you should wed me, and appear before the people no\nlonger as a goddess, but as a woman who has put on the flesh for\nher love's sake. I know well that I am all unworthy of such honour,\nmoreover, that your heart must be sore with the loss of one who was\ndear to you, and little set upon the finding of another husband; also\nI remember certain words that passed between us and a promise which I\nmade. All these things I told to Nam, and he answered me saying that\nthe matter was urgent, that here you could not be hid away for long, and\nthat if I did not take you to wife then you must die. Therefore, because\nmy love towards you is great, I said to him, 'Go now and ask her if she\nwill smile upon me if I come before her with such words.'\n\n\"Nam went, but before he went he made certain agreements with me on\nmatters of policy, under which I must pay a heavy price for you, Lady,\nand forego revenge and forget many an ancient hate, all of which things\nI have promised to do should you smile upon me, so great is my love\ntowards you. The hours went by, and Nam came back to me, saying that,\nhaving weighed the matter in your mind, your answer was favourable. To\nthis I replied that I did not trust him, and would take it from your\nlips alone.\n\n\"And now, Queen, I am here to listen to your word, and to offer myself\nto you, to serve you all my life as your husband and your slave. I have\nlittle to give you who have been bred up in sunnier lands, and among a\nmore gentle people; I who am but the wild chief of men whose hearts are\nrugged as our mountains, and gloomy as a winter's day that is heavy with\nsnow to come,--only myself, the service of my soldiers' spears, and the\nfirst place among the Children of the Mist.\n\n\"Now let me hear your answer, and be it what it may, I will accept it\nwithout a murmur, for least of all things do I desire to force myself\nupon you in marriage. Still I pray you, speak to me plainly once and for\nall, for if I must lose you I would know the worst; nor can I bear, when\nyou have smiled upon me, to see you turn away. Nay, I would sooner die.\"\n\nAnd once more he bowed his head, leaned upon his spear, and was silent.\n\nJuanna considered the position rapidly. It was hopeless and cruel. Nam\nand Soa were on either side of her, the latter standing near the door\nwith the sliding panel beyond which Leonard lay bound, and she knew well\nthat did she speak a single word of the truth to Olfan, it would be the\nsignal for her lover's death. It was possible that the king might be\nable to protect her own person from violence, but if Leonard died it\nmattered little what became of her. There was but one thing that she\ncould do--declare herself willing to become the wife of Olfan. Yet it\nseemed shameless thus to treat this honourable man, the only friend\nthat they had found among the People of the Mist. But of a truth,\nsuch necessities as hers cannot wait while those in their toils weigh\nscruples or the law of honour.\n\n\"Olfan,\" she said, \"I have heard you, and this is my answer: I will take\nyou as my husband. You know my story, you know that he who was my lord\nis but this day dead,\" here Soa smiled approvingly at the lie, \"and that\nI loved him. Therefore of your gentleness, you will accord me some few\nweeks before I pass from him to you, in which I may mourn my widowhood.\nI will say no more, but surely you can guess the sorrow of my heart, and\nall that I have left unsaid.\"\n\n\"It shall be as you wish, Queen,\" replied Olfan, taking her hand and\nkissing it, while his sombre face grew radiant with happiness. \"You\nshall pass into my keeping at that time which best pleases you, yet I\nfear that in one matter you must be troubled now, this very hour.\"\n\n\"What may that be, Olfan?\" asked Juanna anxiously.\n\n\"Only this, Queen, that the rite of marriage as we practise it must be\ncelebrated between us. It is necessary for many reasons which will be\nmade clear to you to-morrow. Moreover, such was my bargain with Nam\nsealed by an oath sworn upon the blood of Aca, an oath that I do not\ndare to break.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" said Juanna in acute distress. \"Think, Olfan, how can I,\nwhose husband is not six hours dead, vow myself to another man upon the\naltar of his grave? Give me some few days, I pray you.\"\n\n\"Most willingly would I do this, Lady, but I may not, it is against my\noath. Also, what can it matter? You shall remain alone for so long as it\nshall please you.\"\n\nThen Nam spoke for the first time, saying:\n\n\"Shepherdess, waste no breath in words, for learn that though this\ngarment of modesty is becoming to one new widowed, yet you must put it\nfrom you. More depends upon this ceremony than you know of, the lives\nof many hang upon it, our own, perchance, among them, and especially the\nlife of one of whom it does not become me to speak,\" and as though by\naccident Nam let his eyes rest upon the door of the adjoining cell.\n\nOf his auditors Olfan thought that he was alluding to his own life,\nbut Juanna and his daughter knew well that he spoke of that of Leonard,\nwhich would be sacrificed did the former persist in her objections to\nthe instant celebration of the marriage.\n\n\"You hear his words, Queen,\" said Olfan, \"and there is weight in them.\nThe times are very dangerous, and if our plot is to be carried through,\nbefore midnight I must make oath to the captains and the Council of the\nElders that you have come back from death to be my wife.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" answered Juanna, catching at a straw in her despair, \"but\nmust I, who shall be set over this people as queen, be married thus in\nsecret? At the least I will have witnesses. Let some of the captains\nwhom you trust, Olfan, be brought here to see us wed, otherwise the time\nmay come when I shall be held to be no true wife, and there are none to\nestablish my honour by their words.\"\n\n\"There is little fear of such a thing, Queen,\" answered Olfan with\na faint smile, \"yet your demands are just. I will bring three of my\ncaptains here, men who will not betray us, and they shall be witness to\nthis rite,\" and he turned as though he would go to seek them.\n\n\"Do not leave me,\" said Juanna, catching him by the wrist. \"I trust you,\nbut these two I do not trust. I fear to be left alone.\"\n\n\"There is no need for witnesses,\" exclaimed Nam in a threatening voice.\n\n\"The Shepherdess has asked for witnesses, and she shall have them,\"\nanswered Olfan fiercely. \"Old man, you have played with me long enough;\nhitherto I have been your servant, now I will be your master. Some hours\nago your life was forfeit to me, for the white dawn had turned to\nred, and I meant to take it, but you bribed me with this bait,\" and\nhe pointed to Juanna. \"Nay, do not lay your hand upon your knife; you\nforget I have my spear. Your priests are without, I know it, but so are\nmy captains, and I have told them where I am; if I vanish as many vanish\nhere, my life will be required at your hands, for, Nam, your power is\nbroken.\n\n\"Now, obey me. Bid that woman summon him who guards without. No, you\ndo not stir,\" and he lifted the spear till its keen blue point quivered\nover the high priest's naked breast. \"Bid her go to the door and summon\nthe guard. I said to the door, but not beyond it, or beware!\"\n\nNam was cowed: his tool had become his master.\n\n\"Obey,\" he said to Soa.\n\n\"Obey, but no more,\" echoed Olfan.\n\nSnarling like a wolf, the woman slipped past them to the door, and\nopening it a little way, she whistled through the crack.\n\n\"Hide yourself, Lady,\" said Olfan.\n\nJuanna retreated into the shadow behind the candle, and at that moment a\nvoice spoke through the open door, saying, \"I am here, father.\"\n\n\"Now, speak,\" said Olfan, advancing the spear an inch nearer Nam's\nheart.\n\n\"My son,\" said the priest, \"go to the entrance by which the king\nentered, where you will find three captains, generals of the king. Lead\nthem hither.\"\n\n\"And see that you speak to no one on the way,\" whispered Olfan in Nam's\near.\n\n\"And see that you speak to no one on the way,\" repeated Nam.\n\n\"I hear you, father,\" replied the priest, and went.\n\nSome ten minutes passed and the door opened again. \"The captains are\nhere,\" whispered a voice.\n\n\"Let them enter,\" said Nam.\n\nThe order was obeyed, and three great men armed with spears stalked into\nthe narrow chamber. One of them was brother to the king, and the two\nothers were his chosen friends. Then the door closed.\n\n\"My brethren,\" said Olfan, \"I have sent for you to acquaint you with a\nmystery and to ask you to witness a rite. The goddess Aca, who this day\nwas hurled into the pool of the Snake, has returned to earth as a woman,\nand is about to become my wife,\"--here the captains started--\"nay,\nbrethren, ask no questions; these things are so, it is enough. Now,\npriest, play your part.\"\n\nAfter that, for a while all seemed a dream to Juanna, a dream of which\nshe was never able to recover any exact memory. She could recollect\nstanding side by side with Olfan, while Nam muttered prayers and\ninvocations over them, administering to them terrible oaths, which they\ntook, calling upon the names of Aca and of Jal, and swearing by the\nsymbol of the Snake. Beyond that everything went blank. Indeed, her mind\nflew back to another marriage ceremony, when she stood beside Leonard in\nthe slave camp, and the priest, Francisco, prayed over them and blessed\nthem. It was that scene which she saw, and not the one enacting\nbefore her eyes, and with its visions were mixed up strange impersonal\nreflections on the irony of fate, which had brought it about that she\nshould figure as the chief actor in two such dramas, the first of which\nLeonard had gone through to save her, and the second of which she must\ngo through to save him.\n\nAt last it was done, and once more Olfan was bowing before her and\nkissing her hand.\n\n\"Greeting, Shepherdess. Hail! Queen of the People of the Mist,\" he said,\nand the captains repeated his words.\n\nJuanna awoke from her stupor. What was to be done now? she wondered.\nWhat could be done? Everything seemed lost. Then of a sudden an\ninspiration took her.\n\n\"It is true that I am a queen, is it not, Olfan?\"\n\n\"It is true, Lady.\"\n\n\"And as Queen of the People of the Mist I have power, have I not,\nOlfan.\"\n\n\"Even to life and death,\" he answered gravely; \"though if you kill, you\nmust answer to the Council of the Elders and to me. All in this land are\nyour servants, Lady, and none dare to disobey you except on matters of\nreligion.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Juanna. Then addressing the captains in a tone of command,\nshe added, \"Seize that priest who is named Nam, and the woman with him.\"\n\nOlfan looked astonished and the captains hesitated. As for Nam, he did\nnot hesitate, but made a bound towards the door.\n\n\"Stay awhile, Nam,\" said the king, making a barrier before him with\nhis spear; \"doubtless the Queen has reasons, and you would wish to hear\nthem. Hold them, my captains, since the Queen commands it.\"\n\nThen the three men sprang upon them. Once Nam tried to draw his knife,\nbut failing in his attempt he submitted without further struggle. With\nSoa it was different. She bit and tore like a wild-cat, and Juanna saw\nthat she was striving to reach the panel and to speak through it.\n\n\"On your lives do not suffer her to come to that door,\" she said;\n\"presently you shall know why.\"\n\nThen the brother of the king dragged Soa to the couch, and throwing her\ndown upon it stood over her, his spear-point at her throat.\n\n\"Now, Queen,\" said Olfan, \"your will is done, and perhaps it may please\nyou to explain.\"\n\n\"Listen, King, and listen, you, captains,\" she answered. \"These liars\ntold you that the Deliverer was dead, was it not so? He is not dead, he\nlies bound in yonder cell, but had I spoken a word to you, then he would\nhave died. Olfan, do you know how my consent was won to be your wife?\nA shutter within that door was opened, and he, my husband, was shown to\nme, gagged and bound, and being held over the mouth of a hideous pit in\nthe floor of his prison, that leads I know not whither.\n\n\"'Consent, or he dies,' they said, and for my love's sake I consented.\nThis was the plot, Olfan: to marry me to you, partly because the woman\nyonder, who was my nurse, did not desire my death, and partly that Nam\nmight use me to save himself from the anger of the people. But do not\nthink that you would have kept me long, Olfan; for this was in the plot\nalso, that when you had served their purpose you should die by secret\nmeans, as one who knew too much.\"\n\n\"It is a lie,\" said Nam.\n\n\"Silence!\" answered Juanna. \"Let that door be opened, and you shall see\nif I have lied.\"\n\n\"Wait awhile, Queen,\" said Olfan, who appeared utterly overcome. \"If I\nunderstand you right, your husband lives, and therefore you say that\nthe words which we have spoken and the oaths that we have sworn mean\nnothing, for you are not my wife.\"\n\n\"That is so, Olfan.\"\n\n\"Then now I am minded to turn wicked and let him die,\" said the king\nslowly, \"for know this, Lady, I cannot give you up.\"\n\nJuanna grew pale as death, understanding that this man's passions, now\nthat once he had given them way, had passed beyond his control.\n\n\"I cannot give you up,\" he repeated. \"Have I not dealt well with you?\nDid I not say to you, 'Consent or refuse, as it shall please you, but\nhaving once consented you must not go back upon your words'? What have\nI to do with the reasons that prompted them? My heart heard them and\nbelieved them. Queen, you are wed to me; those oaths that you have sworn\nmay not be broken. It is too late; now you are mine, nor can I suffer\nyou to pass from me back to another man, even though he was your husband\nbefore me.\"\n\n\"But the Deliverer! must I then become my husband's murderer?\"\n\n\"Nay, I will protect him, and, if it may be, find means to send him from\nthe land.\"\n\nJuanna stood silent and despairing, and at this moment Soa, lying on the\ncouch, broke into a shrill and mocking laugh that stung her like a whip\nand roused her from her lethargy.\n\n\"King,\" she said, \"I am at your mercy, not through any wanton folly of\nmy own, but because fate has made a sport of me. King, you have been\nhardly used, and, as you say, hitherto you have dealt well with me. Now\nI pray you let the end be as the beginning was, so that I may always\nthink of you as the noblest among men, except one who died this day to\nsave me. King, you say you love me; tell me then if my life hung upon a\nword of yours, would that word remain unspoken?\n\n\"Such was my case: I spoke the word and for one short hour I betrayed\nyou. Will you, whose heart is great, bind me by such an oath as this, an\noath wrung from me to save my darling from the power of those dogs? If\nthis is so, then I have erred strangely in my reading of your mind, for\ntill now I have held you to be a man who would perish ere he fell so low\nas to force a helpless woman to be his wife, one whose crime is that she\ndeceived him to save her husband.\"\n\nShe paused, and, clasping her hands as though in prayer, looked up into\nhis troubled face with beseeching eyes; then, as he did not speak, she\nwent on:\n\n\"King, I have one more word to say. You are the strongest and you can\ntake me, but you cannot hold me, for that hour would be my last, and you\nbut the richer by your broken honour and a dead bride.\"\n\nOlfan was about to answer when Soa, fearing lest Juanna's pleading\nshould prevail against his passion, broke in saying, \"Be not fooled,\nKing, by a woman's pretty speeches, or by her idle threats that she will\nkill herself. She will not kill herself, I know her well, she loves her\nlife too much; and soon, when you are wed, she will love you also, for\nit is the nature of us women to worship those who master us. Moreover,\nthat man, the Deliverer, is not her husband, except in name; for months\nI have lived with them and I know it. Take her, King, take her now,\nthis hour, or live to mourn her loss and your own folly all your life's\ndays.\"\n\n\"I will not answer that slave's falsehoods,\" said Juanna, drawing\nherself up and speaking proudly, \"and it were more worthy of you not\nto listen to them, King. I have spoken; now do your will. Be great or\nlittle, be noble or be base, as your nature teaches you.\"\n\nAnd suddenly she sank to the ground and, shaking her long hair about her\nface and arms, she burst into bitter weeping.\n\nTwice the King glanced at her, then he turned his head as though he dare\nlook no more, and spoke keeping his eyes fixed upon the wall.\n\n\"Rise, Queen,\" he said hoarsely, \"and cease your tears, since you are\nsafe from me. Now as always I live to do your will, but I pray you, hide\nyour face from me as much as may be, for, Lady, my heart is broken with\nlove for you and I cannot bear to look on that which I have lost.\"\n\nStill sobbing, but filled with admiration and wonder that a savage could\nbe thus generous, Juanna rose and began to murmur thanks, while the\ncaptains stared, and Soa mocked and cursed them both.\n\n\"Thank me not,\" he said gently. \"It seems that you, who can read all\nhearts, have read mine aright, or perchance you fashioned it as you\nwould have it be. Now, having done with love, let us to war. Woman, what\nis the secret of that door?\"\n\n\"Find it for yourself,\" snarled Soa. \"It is easy to open when once you\nknow the spring--like a woman's heart, Olfan. Or if you cannot find it,\nthen it can be forced--like a woman's love, Olfan. Surely you who are\nso skilled in the winning of a bride need not seek my counsel as to the\nopening of a door, for when I gave it but now upon the first of these\nmatters, you would not hearken, Olfan, but were melted by the sight of\ntears that you should have kissed away.\"\n\nJuanna heard and from that moment made up her mind that whatever\nhappened she had done with Soa. Nor was this wonderful, for few women\ncould have pardoned what she had suffered at her hands.\n\n\"Drive the spear into her till she speaks, comrade,\" said Olfan.\n\nThen at the touch of steel Soa gave up mocking and told the secret of\nthe door.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nHOW OTTER CAME BACK\n\nAfter he had rested awhile at the bottom of the glacier, Otter set to\nwork to explore the cliff on the top of which he found himself, with\nthe view of descending it and hiding at its foot till nightfall, when\nhe hoped to find means of re-entering the city and putting himself in\ncommunication with Olfan. Very soon, however, he discovered that if\nhe was to return at all, he must follow the same route by which he had\ncome.\n\nEvidently the tunnel sloped upwards very sharply, for he was standing on\nthe brow of a precipice cut into three steps, which, taken together, may\nhave measured some three hundred feet in height, and, so far as he could\nsee, it was utterly impossible to descend any of these cliffs without\nthe aid of ropes. Nor could he continue his investigations over a wide\narea, for about four hundred paces to the left of the opening to the\nsubterranean passage--whereof, by the way, he was very careful to note\nthe exact position--the mountain pushed out a snowy shoulder, with\ndeclivities so precipitous that he dared not trust himself on them.\n\nThen he tried the right-hand side, but with no better luck, for here\nhe was stopped by a yawning rift in the rock. Now Otter sat down and\nconsidered the situation.\n\nThe day was still young, and he knew that it would be foolish to attempt\nescape from the pool before dark. In front of him the mountain rose\nsteeply till, so far as he could judge, it reached a pass which lay some\ntwo miles off, at the base of that main peak, on whose snows the priests\nhad watched the breaking of the dawn. Part of this declivity was covered\nwith blocks of green ice, but here and there appeared patches of earth,\non which grew stunted trees, shrubs, and even grass and flowers. Being\nvery hungry, it occurred to Otter that he might find edible roots among\nthis scanty vegetation.\n\nWith this hope he began to climb the slope, to be rewarded in due course\nby the discovery of a vegetable that he recognised, for it was the same\nwhich had been offered to him on the occasion of his unlucky outbreak\nthat had resulted in the casting away of the rubies.\n\nWith this poor food the dwarf filled himself, and having found a bough\nthat made him an excellent staff, he continued his climb, desiring to\nsee what there might be on the other side of the neck.\n\nArriving there without any great difficulty, Otter stood astonished,\nalthough he was not much given to the study of scenery. Below him lay\nthe City of the Mist, with its shining belt of rivers that, fed from the\ninexhaustible mountain snows, meandered across the vast plains--now no\nlonger hidden in mist--which they had trodden on their journey. Above\nhis head the mighty peak towered thousands of feet into the air, till it\nended in a summit shaped like a human finger pointing eternally to the\nheavens. Before him the scene was even stranger, made up as it was of\nsnowy fields broken by ridges of black rock, and laid one beneath the\nother like white sails drying upon the slopes of a sandhill.\n\nGradually, as the eye travelled downward, these snow-fields grew fewer\nand fewer, till at last they vanished altogether, and their place was\ntaken, first by stretches of grass-land, and finally, at the foot of\nthe mountain, by what seemed to be a rich and level country interspersed\nwith clumps of bush and forest trees.\n\nThe first of these patches of snow lay within five furlongs of where the\ndwarf stood, but several hundred feet below him.\n\nBetween the neck of the pass and this snow stretched a mighty rift or\nchasm, with sides so sheer that no goat could have kept a footing on\nthem. Yet this gulf was not without its bridge, for a rock wall rose\nfrom the bottom of the chasm, forming the bed of a glacier which spanned\nit from side to side. In some places the wall was comparatively level\nand in others it showed descents sharp as those of a waterfall. This\nremarkable bridge of ice--that varied from a hundred paces to a\nfew yards in width--was bordered on either side by the most fearful\nprecipices; while, just where its fall was sheerest and its width\nnarrowest, it seemed to spring across a space of nothingness, like the\narch of a bridge thrown from bank to bank of a river. Indeed, at this\npoint its line became so attenuated that in the glittering sunlight\nOtter was doubtful whether it was not broken through for a distance of\nsome yards.\n\nBeing of an inquiring mind, the dwarf decided to satisfy himself upon\nthe matter. All around him lay slabs of rock, some of which were worn\nperfectly smooth and to the thinness of a tombstone, by centuries\nof polishing in the iron jaws of glaciers. Selecting one of these of\nconvenient size, Otter approached the edge of the bridge, pushing the\nstone before him over the frozen snow. Here the ice was perfect, except\nfor a slight hoar-frost that covered it, for the action of the wind\nprevented the snow from gathering on the bridge, and whenever the sun\nwas strong enough to melt its surface, it froze again at night, so that\nno slide upon a parish pond could have been more slippery or free from\ninequalities.\n\nOtter gave his stone a push, and away it went, sometimes swiftly and\nsometimes at a trifling speed, according to the nature of the angle down\nwhich it passed, leaving a bright green ribbon upon the ice in its wake,\nwhence it swept the hoar-frost as it sped. Once or twice he thought that\nit was going to stop, but it never did stop. At length it approached the\nsteepest and narrowest part of the descent, down which the stone rushed\nwith fearful velocity.\n\n\"Now I shall see whether the bridge is broken,\" thought Otter; and just\nthen the rock, travelling like an arrow, came to that portion of\nthe glacier where, for a width difficult to estimate, it stretched\nunsupported over space, and measured only some few feet across. On it\nflew, then seemed to leap into the air, and once more sped forward\ntill it reached the further slope of snow, up which it travelled for a\ndistance, and stopped, appearing, even to Otter's keen sight, no larger\nthan a midge upon a table-cloth.\n\n\"Now, if a man had been seated on that stone he might have passed this\nbridge in safety,\" said Otter to himself; \"yet it is one that few would\ncare to travel, unless sure death were behind them.\"\n\nThen he determined on a second trial, and selecting another and somewhat\nlighter stone, he sent it upon its journey. It followed precisely the\nsame course as its predecessor, but when it came to the knife-blade of\nthe bridge it vanished.\n\n\"I am sorry for that stone,\" thought Otter, \"for doubtless it, that has\nbeen whole for many years, is at this moment only little pieces.\"\n\nA third time he repeated his experiment, choosing the heaviest rock that\nhe could move. This messenger also leaped into the air at the narrowest\nportion of the bridge, then passed on in safety to the slope of snow\nbeyond.\n\n\"A strange place,\" thought Otter; \"and I pray that it may never be my\nlot to ride one of those stone horses.\"\n\nThen he turned down the mountain again, for the afternoon was advancing.\nWhen he reached the entrance to the river-bed sunset was at hand. For a\nwhile he sat watching the fading light and eating some more roots which\nhe had gathered. Now he crawled into the passage and commenced his\ndarksome journey towards the home of the dead Water Dweller, though what\nhe was to do when he got there he did not know. No accident befell him,\nand in due course he arrived safely in the den, his journey being much\nfacilitated by the staff he bore, which enabled him to feel his way like\na blind man.\n\nCreeping to the edge of the pool he listened to its turmoil, for the\nshadows were gathering so fast that, with some ghostlike shapes of foam\nexcepted, he could not even see the surface of the water.\n\n\"If I go in there how can I get out again?\" Otter thought sadly. \"After\nall, perhaps I should have done better to return while it was still\nlight, for then, by the help of my staff and the rope, I might have made\nshift to climb the overhanging ledge of rock, but to try this now were\nmadness. I will go back and sit in the cave with the ghosts of the god\nand his dead till the morning comes again, though I do not crave their\ncompany.\"\n\nSo he retreated a few paces and sat in silence near the tail of the dead\nCrocodile. After a while loneliness took hold of him; he tried to sleep\nand could not, for it seemed to Otter that he saw eyes staring at him\nfrom the depths of the cave, and heard dead men whispering to each other\ntales of their dreadful ends. Moment by moment his fears grew upon\nhim, for Otter was very superstitious. Now he fancied that he could\ndistinguish the head of the reptile limned in fire and resting on the\nedge of the rock as he had seen it that morning.\n\n\"Doubtless,\" he thought, \"this monster is a devil and has come to life\nagain to be revenged upon me. _Wow!_ I liked him better when he was in\nthe flesh than now that he has turned himself to fire.\" Then to comfort\nhimself he began to talk aloud saying:\n\n\"Otter, unlucky that you are, why did you not die at once instead of\nliving on to be tormented by ghosts? Perhaps your master, the Baas, whom\nalone you love, is dead already and waits for you to come to serve him.\nYou are very tired; say now, Otter, would it not be well if you took\nthat rope which is about your middle and hanged yourself? Thus you too\nwould become a ghost and be able to do battle with them in their own\nfashion,\" and he groaned loudly.\n\nThen of a sudden he grew fearful indeed, the short wool stood up upon\nhis head, his teeth chattered, and, as he said afterwards, his very nose\nseemed to grow cold with terror. For as he sat he heard, or seemed to\nhear, a voice speaking to him from the air, and that voice his master's.\n\n\"_Otter_, _Otter_,\" said the voice.\n\nHe made no answer, he was too frightened.\n\n\"Otter, is that you?\" whispered the voice again.\n\nThen he spoke. \"Yes, Baas, it is I. I know that you are dead and call\nme. Give me one minute till I can undo my rope, and I will kill myself\nand come to you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Otter,\" said the voice with a ghastly attempt at a laugh,\n\"but if it is all the same, I would much rather that you came alive.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, and I too would rather stop alive, but being alive how can I\njoin you who are dead?\"\n\n\"You fool, I am not dead,\" said Leonard.\n\n\"Then, Baas, how is it that you speak out of the air? Come near to me\nthat I may touch you and be comforted.\"\n\n\"I cannot, Otter; I am bound and in a prison above you. There is a hole\nin the floor, and if you have a rope, as I heard you say, perhaps you\ncould climb up to me.\"\n\nNow the dwarf began to understand. Rising, he stretched the long staff\nhe had brought with him high above his head, and found to his delight\nthat he could touch the roof of the cave. Presently the point of the\nstaff ceased to press upon the rock.\n\n\"Is the place here, Baas?\" said Otter.\n\n\"It is here, but you must throw the stick up like a spear through the\nhole, for I am tied, and cannot put out my hand to take it.\"\n\n\"Stay awhile, Baas; first I must make the line fast to it.\"\n\n\"Good, but be swift, for I am in danger.\"\n\nHurriedly Otter undid the hide rope from about his middle, knotting it\nsecurely to the centre of the stick. Then some five feet below the stick\nhe made a loop large enough for a man to place his foot in, and having\nascertained the exact situation of the opening in the roof of the cave,\nhe hurled the staff upwards and jerked at the line.\n\n\"It is fixed,\" whispered Leonard from above. \"Now come up if you can.\"\n\nThe dwarf required no second invitation. Seizing the rope as high as\nhe could reach above his head, he began to drag himself up hand over\nhand--no easy task, for the hide cord was thin, and cut his fingers and\nhis right leg, round which he had twisted it to get a better purchase.\nPresently, however, he succeeded in setting his foot in the loop he had\nprepared, when he found that his head and shoulders were in the hole,\nand that by reaching upwards he could grasp the staff which lay across\nit. The rest was easy, and within half a minute he lay gasping at his\nmaster's side.\n\n\"Have you a knife, Otter?\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, my small one, the big ones are down there; I will tell you\nthat story by and by.\"\n\n\"Never mind the story now, Otter. My hands are tied behind my back. Feel\nfor the lashings and cut them, then give me the knife that I may free my\nlegs.\"\n\nOtter obeyed, and presently Leonard rose and stretched himself with a\nsigh of relief.\n\n\"Where is the Shepherdess, Baas?\"\n\n\"There, in the next cell. They separated me from her, and since then I\nhave been dangled by the legs over that hole bound and gagged, I think\nin order to persuade her to consent to something or other by the sight\nof my danger, for doubtless she was placed where she could see all. Then\nthey left me, and I managed to spit out the gag, but I could not undo\nthe cords. I expect that they will soon be back again.\"\n\n\"Then had we not better fly, Baas? I have found a passage that leads to\nthe mountains.\"\n\n\"How can we fly and leave the Shepherdess, Otter? Since I have been held\ndown the hole, only two men have visited me from time to time, for they\nthink me helpless. Let us seize these men when they come in and take\ntheir knives, for we are unarmed. Then we can think; also we shall have\ntheir keys.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, we may do that. You take the staff; it is stout.\"\n\n\"And what will you use?\" asked Leonard.\n\n\"Fear not, Baas. Do these men bear lights?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then in two minutes I will make me a weapon.\"\n\nAnd, untying the hide rope from the stick, he began to fumble with it\nbusily.\n\n\"Now I am ready, Baas,\" he said presently. \"Where shall we stand?\"\n\n\"Here,\" answered Leonard, leading him to the door. \"We will crouch in\nthe shadow, one on either side of this door, and when the priests have\nentered and closed it, and begin to look round for me, then we can\nspring upon them. Only, Otter, there must be no bungling and no noise.\"\n\n\"I think that there will be none, Baas; they will be too frightened to\ncry at first, and after that they will become dumb.\"\n\n\"Otter,\" whispered Leonard, as they stood in the dark, \"did you kill the\nWater-Dweller?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Baas,\" he chuckled in answer. \"I caught him with the hook\nthat I made ready. But he did not die easily, Baas, and if I had not\nbeen able to swim well he would have drowned me.\"\n\n\"I heard something of it from Nam,\" said Leonard. \"You are a wonderful\nfellow, Otter.\"\n\n\"Oh, Baas! it was no valour of mine; when I saw his eyes I was horribly\nafraid, only I thought how gladly you would have attacked him had you\nbeen there, and what a coward you would hold me, could you have seen\nme shivering like a little girl before a big lizard, and these thoughts\ngave me courage.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is all very well!\" replied Leonard, and suddenly added, \"Hush!\nbe ready!\"\n\nAs he spoke the door opened, and two great priests came through it, one\nof them bearing a candle. He who bore the light turned to shut the door,\nfor he suspected nothing. Then, at one and the same instant, Leonard,\nemerging from the shadow, dealt the first priest a blow upon the head\nwith his staff, which stunned if it did not kill him, for he fell\nlike an ox beneath the pole-axe, while Otter, standing where he was,\ndexterously cast his hide rope about the throat of the second man, and\ndrew the noose tight with a jerk that brought him to the earth.\n\nIn twenty seconds it was all over. The men, who were the same that had\nheld Leonard suspended in the oubliette, lay senseless or dead, and\nthe dwarf and his master were engaged in possessing themselves of their\nknives and keys by the light of the candle, which, though it had fallen\nto the ground, fortunately remained burning.\n\n\"That was well done, Otter,\" said Leonard, \"and I am not ashamed to have\ndone it, for these devils kicked me when I was bound. Now we are armed,\nand have the keys. What next?\"\n\nJust then Otter sprang to his feet, crying, \"Look out, Baas; here are\nmore.\"\n\nLeonard glanced up to see, and behold! the second door in the cell was\nopened, and through it came Juanna, Olfan, Nam, Soa, and three other\nmen.\n\nFor a moment there was silence; till one of the captains cried out,\n\"See! Jal the god has come back, and already he claims his victims!\" And\nhe pointed to the two priests.\n\nThen followed a scene of confusion, for even Olfan and Nam were amazed\nat what seemed to them little short of a miracle, while Leonard and\nJuanna had eyes for each other only, and the three captains stared at\nOtter like men who think they see a ghost.\n\nBut one person in that company kept her head, and that person was Soa.\nThe captain who guarded her had loosed his hold; silently she slunk back\ninto the shadows, and, unseen of any, vanished through the doorway by\nwhich she had been led in. A minute passed, and Otter, thinking that he\nheard a noise without that door of the cell whereby the two priests had\nentered, which had been left ajar, went to it and tried to open it. Just\nthen, also, Olfan missed Soa.\n\n\"Where is the woman, Nam's daughter?\" he cried.\n\n\"It seems that she has escaped and shut us in, King,\" answered Otter,\ncalmly.\n\nFollowed by the others, Olfan sprang first to the door of the cell where\nthey were, and then through the connecting passage to that of Juanna's\nprison. It was true, both were closed.\n\n\"It matters nothing, here are the keys,\" said Leonard.\n\n\"They will not avail us, Deliverer,\" answered Olfan, \"for these doors\nare made fast without by bars of stone thicker than my arm. Now this\nwoman has gone to rouse the college of the priests, who will presently\ncome to kill us like caged rats.\"\n\n\"Quick!\" said Leonard, \"waste no time, we must break down the doors.\"\n\n\"Yes, Deliverer,\" said Nam mockingly; \"batter them in with your fists,\ncut through the stone-work with your spears; surely they are as nothing\nto your strength!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\"I AM REPAID, QUEEN\"\n\nTheir position was terrible. Soa had escaped, and Soa knew everything.\nMoreover, she was mad with hatred and longing for revenge on Leonard,\nOtter, and in a less degree on Olfan the king. Had they succeeded in\nrevealing themselves to the people, all might have gone well, for Otter\nand Juanna would certainly have been accepted as true gods, who had\npassed and repassed the gates of death scatheless. But now the affair\nwas different. Soa would tell the truth to the priests, who, even if\nthey were inclined to desert her father in his extremity, must strike\nfor their own sakes and for that of their order, which was the most\npowerful among the People of the Mist, and had no desire to be placed\nunder the yoke of secular authority.\n\nIt was clear to all of them that if they could not escape, they\nmust fall very shortly into the hands of the priests, who, knowing\neverything, would not dare to allow them to appeal to the army, or to\nthe superstition of the outside public. The only good card they held was\nthe possession of the person of Nam, though it remained to be seen how\nfar this would help them.\n\nTo begin with, there are always some ready to step into the shoes of a\nhigh priest, also Nam had blundered so extensively in the matter of\nthe false gods, that the greater part of the fraternity, whom he had\ninvolved in his mistakes, would not sorrow to see the last of him.\n\nThese facts, which were perfectly well known to Olfan and guessed at by\nhis companions, sharpened their sense of the danger in which they had\nbeen placed by Soa's resource and cunning. Indeed, their escape was\na matter of life and death to them and to many hundreds of their\nadherents. If once they could reach the temple and proclaim the\nre-arisen gods to the people, all would go well, for the army would\nsuffice to keep the priests from using violence. But if they failed in\nthis, their death-warrant was already signed, for none of them would\never be heard of again.\n\nNo wonder, then, that they hurled themselves despairingly upon the\nstubborn doors. For an hour or more they laboured, but all in vain. The\nmassive timbers of hard wood, six inches or more in thickness, could\nscarcely be touched by their knives and spears, nor might their united\nstrength serve even to stir the stone bolts and bars that held them\nfast, and they had nothing that could be used as a battering-ram.\n\n\"It is useless,\" said Leonard at last, throwing down his knife in\ndespair; \"this wood is like iron, it would take us a week to cut through\nit.\"\n\n\"Why not try fire, Baas?\" suggested Otter.\n\nAccordingly they attempted to burn down the doors, with the result\nthat they nearly stifled themselves in the smoke and made but little\nimpression upon the woodwork.\n\nAt length they gave up the experiment--it was a failure--and sat looking\nblankly at each other as they listened to certain sounds which reached\nthem from the passages without, telling them that their enemies were\ngathering there.\n\n\"Has anyone a suggestion to make?\" said Leonard at last. \"If not, I\nthink that this game is about played.\"\n\n\"Baas,\" answered Otter, \"I have a word to say. We can all go down\nthrough that hole by which I came up to you. The Water-Dweller is dead,\nI slew him with my own hand, so there is nothing to fear from him.\nBeneath the hole runs a tunnel, and that tunnel leads to the slope of\nthe mountain above. At the top of this slope is an ice-bridge by which\nmen may reach a fair country if they have a mind to.\"\n\n\"Then for heaven's sake let us cross it,\" put in Juanna.\n\n\"I have seen that bridge,\" said Olfan, while the captains stared\nwonderingly at the man whose might had prevailed against the ancient\nSnake, \"but never yet have I heard of the traveller who dared to set his\nfoot upon it.\"\n\n\"It is dangerous, but it can be crossed,\" replied Otter; \"at the\nleast, it is better to try it than to stay here to be murdered by the\nmedicine-men.\"\n\n\"I think that we will go, Leonard,\" said Juanna; \"if I am to die I wish\nto do so in the open air. Only what is to become of Nam? And perhaps\nOlfan and the captains would prefer to stop here?\"\n\n\"Nam will go with us wherever we go,\" answered Leonard grimly; \"we\nhave a long score to settle with that gentleman. As for Olfan and his\ncaptains, they must please themselves.\"\n\n\"What will do you, Olfan?\" asked Juanna, speaking to him for the first\ntime since the scene in the other prison.\n\n\"It seems, Queen,\" he answered, with downcast eyes, \"that I have sworn\nto defend you to the last, and this I will do the more readily because\nnow my life is of little value. As for my brethren here, I think, like\nyou, that they will choose to die in the open, rather than wait to be\nmurdered by the priests.\"\n\nThe three captains nodded an assent to his words. Then they all set to\nwork.\n\nFirst they took food and drink, of which there was an ample supply in\nthe other cell, and hurriedly swallowing some of it, disposed the rest\nabout their persons as best they could, for they foresaw that even if\nthey succeeded in escaping, it was likely that they would go hungry for\nmany days. Then Leonard wrapped Juanna in a goat-skin cloak which he\ntook from one of the fallen priests, placing the second cloak over\nhis own shoulders, for he knew that it would be bitterly cold on the\nmountains. Lastly, they tied Nam's arms behind him and deprived him of\nhis knife, so that the old man might work none of them a sudden injury\nin his rage.\n\nAll being prepared, Otter made his rope fast to the staff and descended\nrapidly to the cave below. As his feet touched the ground, the priests\nbegan to batter upon the doors of the cell with beams of wood, or some\nsuch heavy instruments.\n\n\"Quick, Juanna!\" said Leonard, \"sit in this noose and hold the line, we\nwill let you down. Hurry, those doors cannot stand for long.\"\n\nAnother minute and she was beside Otter, who stood beneath, a candle in\nhis hand. Then Leonard came down.\n\n\"By the way, Otter,\" he said, \"have you seen anything of the jewels that\nare supposed to be here?\"\n\n\"There is a bag yonder by the Water-Dweller's bed, Baas,\" answered the\ndwarf carelessly, \"but I did not trouble to look into it. What is the\nuse of the red stones to us now?\"\n\n\"None, but they may be of use afterwards, if we get away.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, _if_ we get away,\" answered Otter, bethinking himself of the\nice-bridge. \"Well, we can pick it up as we go along.\"\n\nJust then Nam arrived, having been let down by Olfan and the captains,\nand stood glaring round him, not without awe, for neither he nor any of\nhis brethren had ever dared to visit the sacred home of the Snake-god.\nThen the captains descended, and last of all came Olfan.\n\n\"We have little time to spare, Deliverer,\" said the king; \"the door is\nfalling,\" and as he spoke they heard a great crash above. Otter jerked\nfuriously at the rope, till by good luck one end of the stake slid over\nthe edge of the hole and it fell among them.\n\n\"No need to leave this line for them to follow by,\" he said; \"besides\nit may be useful.\" At that moment something appeared looking through\nthe hole. It was the head of one of the pursuing priests. Nam saw it and\ntook his opportunity.\n\n\"The false gods escape by the tunnel to the mountains,\" he screamed,\n\"and with them the false king. Follow and fear not, the Water-Dweller is\ndead. Think not of me, Nam, but slay them.\"\n\nWith an exclamation Otter struck him heavily across the mouth, knocking\nhim backwards, but the mischief was done, for a voice cried in answer:\n\n\"We hear you, father, and will find ropes and follow.\"\n\nThen they started. One moment they paused to look at the huge bulk of\nthe dead crocodile.\n\n\"This dwarf is a god in truth,\" cried one of the captains, \"for no man\ncould have wrought such a deed.\"\n\n\"Forward,\" said Leonard, \"we have no time to lose.\"\n\nNow they were by the crocodile's bed and among the broken bones of his\nvictims.\n\n\"The bag, Otter, where is the bag?\" asked Leonard.\n\n\"Here, Baas,\" answered the dwarf, dragging it from the mouldering\nskeleton of the unlucky priest who, having offended the new-found god,\nhad been let down through the hole to lay it in its hiding-place and to\nperish in the jaws of the Water-Dweller.\n\nLeonard took the bag, and opening its mouth, which was drawn tight with\na running strip of hide, he peeped into it while Otter held down the\ncandle that he might see. From its depths came a glimmer of red and blue\nlight that glowed like the heart of some dull fire.\n\n\"It is the treasure,\" he said, in a low tone of exultation. \"At last the\nluck has turned.\"\n\n\"How much does it weigh?\" said Juanna, as they sped onwards.\n\n\"Some seven or eight pounds, I should say,\" he answered, still\nexultantly. \"Seven or eight solid pounds of gems, the finest in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"Then give it to me,\" she said; \"I have nothing else to carry. You may\nhave to use both your hands presently.\"\n\n\"True,\" he answered, and passed the string of the bag over her head.\n\nNow they went on up the smooth sloping bed of the stream, suffering\nlittle inconvenience, except from the cold of the water that flowed\nabout their ankles.\n\n\"The stream has risen a little, Baas, since I passed it this morning,\"\nsaid Otter. \"Doubtless this day's sun has melted some snow at its\nsource. To-morrow we might not have been able to travel this road.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" answered Leonard. \"I told you that our luck had turned at\nlast.\"\n\nTwenty minutes more and they reached the mouth of the tunnel, and\npassing between the blocks of ice, found themselves upon the mountain\nside. But, as it chanced, the face of the moon was hidden by clouds,\nwhich is often the case in this country at the beginning of the spring\nseason, for whereas in winter the days are almost invariably misty and\nthe nights clear, in spring and summer these atmospheric conditions are\nfrequently reversed. So dark was it indeed, that it proved impossible to\nattempt the ascent of the mountain until the day broke, since to do\nso would be to run the risk of losing themselves, and very possibly of\nbreaking their necks among its numerous clefts and precipices.\n\nAfter a minute's hasty discussion they set to work to fill up the mouth\nof the tunnel, or rather the cracks between the blocks of ice that\nalready encumbered it, with such material as lay to hand, namely lumps\nof frozen snow, gravel, and a few large stones which they were fortunate\nenough to find in the immediate vicinity, for the darkness rendered\nit impossible to search for these at a distance. While they were thus\nengaged they heard the voices of priests speaking on the further side\nof their somewhat inefficient barrier, and worked harder than ever,\nthinking that the moment of attack had come.\n\nTo their astonishment, however, the sound of talking died away.\n\n\"Now where have they gone?\" said Leonard--\"to climb the cliff by another\npath and cut us off?\"\n\n\"I think not, Deliverer,\" answered Olfan, \"for I know of no such path.\nI think that they have gone to bring heavy beams by means of which they\nwill batter down the ice wall.\"\n\n\"Still there is such a path, King,\" said one of the captains, \"for\nI myself have often climbed it when I was young, searching for\nsnow-flowers to bring to her whom I courted in those days.\"\n\n\"Can you find it now, friend?\" asked Olfan eagerly.\n\n\"I do not forget a road that I have trod,\" said the captain, \"but it is\none not easy to follow.\"\n\n\"See now, Shepherdess,\" said Olfan after thinking awhile, \"shall we take\nthis man for a guide and return down the cliff to the city, for there,\nunless fate is against us, we may find friends among the soldiers and\nfight out this battle with the priests.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" answered Juanna almost passionately, \"I would rather die than\ngo back to that dreadful place to be murdered at last. Do you go if you\nwill, Olfan, and leave us to take our chance.\"\n\n\"That I cannot do, Queen, for I am sworn to a certain service,\" he said\nproudly. \"But hearken, my friend; follow this path of which you speak,\nif you can do so in the darkness, and find help. Then return swiftly to\nthis spot where I and your two comrades will hold the priests at bay.\nPerchance you will not find us living, but this I charge you, if we are\ndead give it out that the gods have left the land because they were so\nevilly dealt with, and rouse up the people to fall upon the priests\nand make an end of them once and for ever, for thus only shall they win\npeace and safety.\"\n\nMaking no reply, the man shook Olfan and the other two captains by the\nhand, saluted Juanna, and vanished into the darkness. Then they all sat\ndown in front of the mouth of the tunnel to wait and watch, and very\nglad were they of the goat-skin cloaks which had belonged to the\npriests, for as the night drew towards the dawn, the cold became so\nbitter that they could scarcely bear it, but were obliged to rise and\nstamp to and fro to keep their wet feet from freezing.\n\n\"Leonard,\" said Juanna, \"you do not know what passed after Nam trapped\nyou,\" and she told him all the tale.\n\nWhen she had finished he rose and, taking Olfan by the hand, said:\n\"King, I thank you. May fortune deal as well with you as you have dealt\nby me and mine!\"\n\n\"Say no more, Deliverer,\" answered Olfan hastily; \"I have but done my\nduty and fulfilled my oath, though at times the path of duty is hard for\na man to follow.\" And he looked towards Juanna and sighed.\n\nLeonard sat down and was silent, but many a time both then and in\nafter-days did he wonder at the nobleness of mind of this savage king,\nwhich enabled him, under circumstances so cruel, to conquer his own\npassion and show himself willing to lay down life and throne together,\nthat he might carry out his vow to protect the woman who had brought him\nso much pain and now left him for ever with his successful rival.\n\nAt length, looking at the mountain peak above them, they saw its snows\nbegin to blush red with the coming of the dawn, and just then also they\nheard many voices talking within the tunnel, and caught glimpses of\nlights flashing through the openings in their rude fortifications. The\npriests, who no doubt had been delayed by the procuring of the timbers\nwhich were to serve as battering-rams, and the labour necessary to drag\nthem up the steep incline of the tunnel, had returned, and in force. A\nfew more minutes and a succession of dull thuds on the further side of\nthe ice wall told the little band of defenders that their enemies were\nat work.\n\n\"The light grows quickly, Deliverer,\" said Olfan quietly; \"I think that\nnow you may begin to ascend the mountain and take no harm.\"\n\n\"What shall we do with this man?\" asked Leonard, pointing to Nam.\n\n\"Kill him,\" said Otter.\n\n\"No, not yet awhile,\" answered Olfan. \"Take this,\" and he handed Leonard\nthe spear of the third captain, who had left it when he started down the\nmountain, fearing that it might encumber him, \"and drive him along with\nyou at its point. Should we be overpowered, you may buy your lives as\nthe price of his. But should we hold them back and you escape, then do\nwith him what you will.\"\n\n\"I know well what I would do,\" muttered Otter, glowering at the priest.\n\n\"And now, farewell,\" went on Olfan in the same calm voice. \"Bring more\nice, comrades, or stone if you can see any; the wall cracks.\"\n\nLeonard and Otter wrung the king's hand in silence, but Juanna could\nnot leave him thus, for her heart was melted at the thought of all his\ngoodness.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she murmured, \"that I have brought you grief, and, as I\nfear, death to follow grief.\"\n\n\"The grief you could not help, Queen, and be sure I shall welcome death\nif he should choose me. Go now, and happiness go with you. May you\nescape in safety with the bright pebbles which you desire! May you and\nyour husband, the Deliverer, be blessed for many years in each other's\nlove, and when you grow old together, from time to time think kindly of\nthat wild man, who worshipped you while you were young and laid down his\nlife to save you.\"\n\nJuanna listened, and tears sprang to her eyes; then of a sudden she\nseized the great man's hand and kissed it.\n\n\"I am repaid, Queen,\" he said, \"and perchance your husband will not be\njealous. Now go, and swiftly.\"\n\nAs he spoke a small portion of the wall fell outwards and the fierce\nface of a priest appeared at the opening. With a shout Olfan lifted his\nbroad spear and thrust. The priest fell backwards, and just then the\ncaptains arrived with stones and stopped the hole.\n\nThen the three turned and fled up the mountain side, Otter driving Nam\nbefore him with blows and curses, till at length the old man fell and\nlay on his face groaning. Nor could the dwarf's blows, which were not of\nthe softest, force him to rise.\n\n\"Get up, you treacherous dog,\" said Leonard, threatening him with the\nspear.\n\n\"Then you must loose my arms, Deliverer,\" answered the priest; \"I am\nvery weak, and I cannot travel up this mountain with my hands bound\nbehind me. Surely you have nothing to fear from one aged and unarmed\nman.\"\n\n\"Not much at present, I suppose,\" muttered Leonard, \"though we have had\nenough to fear from you in the past.\" And taking his knife he cut loose\nthe lashings.\n\nWhile he did so, Juanna turned and looked behind her. Far below them\nshe could see the forms of Olfan and his companions standing shoulder\nto shoulder, and even catch the gleams of light reflected from their\nspears, for now the sun was rising. Beneath them again she saw the\ngrass-grown roofs of that earthly hell, the City of the People of the\nMist, and the endless plain beyond through which the river wandered like\na silver serpent. There also was the further portion of the huge wall of\nthe temple built by unknown hands in forgotten years, and rising\nabove the edge of that gap in the cliff through which she was looking,\nappeared a black mass which she knew to be the head and shoulders of the\nhideous colossus, on whose dizzy brow she had sat in that strange hour\nwhen the shouting thousands thundered a welcome to her as their goddess,\nand whence her most beloved friend, Francisco, had been hurled to his\ncruel death.\n\n\"Oh, what I have suffered in that place!\" she thought to herself. \"How\nhave I lived through it, I wonder? And yet I have won something,\" and\nshe glanced at Leonard who was driving Nam towards her, \"and if only\nwe survive and I am the means of enabling him to fulfil his vow and\nbuy back his home with these jewels, I shall not regret all that I have\nendured to win them. Yes, even when he is no longer so very much in\nlove, he must always be grateful to me, for few women will have done as\nmuch for their husbands.\"\n\nThen Nam staggered past her, hissing curses, while the untiring Otter\nrained blows upon his back, and losing sight of Olfan and his companions\nthey went on in safety, till they reached the neck and saw the\nice-bridge glittering before them and the wide fields of snow beyond.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nTHE TRIUMPH OF NAM\n\n\"Which way are we to go now?\" said Juanna; \"must we climb down this\ngreat gulf?\"\n\n\"No, Shepherdess,\" answered Otter; \"see, before you is a bridge,\" and he\npointed to the band of ice and rock which traversed the wide ravine.\n\n\"A bridge?\" gasped Juanna, \"why it is as slippery as a slide and steep\nas the side of a house. A fly could not keep its footing on it.\"\n\n\"Look here, Otter,\" put in Leonard, \"either you are joking or you are\nmad. How can we cross that place? We should be dashed to pieces before\nwe had gone ten yards.\"\n\n\"Thus, Baas: we must sit each of us on one of the flat stones that lie\nround here, then the stone will take us across of itself. I know, for I\nhave tried it.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you have been over there on a rock?\"\n\n\"No, Baas, but I have sent three stones over. Two crossed safely, I\nwatched them go the whole way, and one vanished in the middle. I think\nthat there is a hole there, but we must risk that. If the stone is heavy\nenough it will jump it, if not, then we shall go down the hole and be no\nmore troubled.\"\n\n\"Great heavens!\" said Leonard, wiping his forehead with the back of his\nhand, \"this is practical tobogganing with a vengeance. Is there no other\nway?\"\n\n\"I can see none, Baas, except for the birds, and I think that we had\nbetter stop talking and make ready, for the priests are still behind us.\nIf you will watch on the neck here so that we are not surprised, I will\nseek stones to carry us.\"\n\n\"How about this man?\" said Leonard, pointing to Nam, who lay face\ndownwards on the snow, apparently in a dead faint.\n\n\"Oh! we must keep him a while, Baas; he may be useful if those priests\ncome. If not, I will talk with him before we start. He is asleep and\ncannot run away.\"\n\nThen Leonard went to the top of the neck, which was distant some twenty\nyards, and Otter began to search for stones suitable to his purpose.\n\nAs for Juanna, she turned her back to the ice-bridge, at which she\nscarcely dared to look, and sat herself upon a rock. In doing so the\njewels in the bag struck against her knee and jingled, and the thought\ncame into her mind that she would examine them while she waited, partly\nbecause she desired to distract her thoughts from the vision of this new\nand terrible ordeal which lay before her, and partly to gratify a not\nunnatural curiosity.\n\nOpening the mouth of the bag, she thrust her fingers into it, and one by\none drew out the biggest gems which were jumbled together there, placing\nthem on the rock beside her. In less than a minute she was feasting\nher eyes upon such a collection of priceless jewels as had never before\ngladdened the sight of any white woman, even in her wildest dreams;\nindeed, till now Juanna had not thought it possible that stones so\nsplendid could exist on the hither side of the walls of heaven.\n\nFirst there were great sapphires roughly squared, and two enormous\nround star rubies: these had formed the eyes of the colossus, which were\nremoved on the morrow of their arrival, the star rubies representing the\nblood-red pupils. Then there was a heart-shaped ruby of perfect colour\nand without flaw, almost as large as a jackdaw's egg, which on the days\nof sacrifice had adorned the breasts of the chief priests of the People\nof the Mist for many generations. Next came the greatest wonders of\nthis treasure, two marvellous stones, one a sapphire and one a ruby,\nfashioned respectively into models of the statue of the Dwarf and of the\nhideous shape of the Water-Dweller. Then there were others--dozens\nof them--some rudely cut and polished, and some as they came from the\nearth, but every one of them singled out for its remarkable size and\nflawlessness, or its perfect fire and beauty.\n\nJuanna arranged them in rows and stared at them with ecstasy--where is\nthe woman who would not have done so?--till in contemplating them she\neven forgot the present terrors of her position--forgot everything\nexcept the gorgeous loveliness and infinite value of the wealth of gems,\nwhich she had been the means of winning for Leonard.\n\nAmong other things that passed from her mind at this moment was the\npresence of Nam, who, overcome by rage and exhaustion, lay in a seeming\nfaint upon the snow within twelve paces of her. She never saw him lift\nhis head and look at her with an expression as cold and cruel as that\nwhich Otter had seen in the eyes of the Water-Dweller, when he lifted\n_his_ head from its bed of rock. She never saw him roll slowly over and\nover across the snow towards her, pausing a while between each turn of\nhis body, for now she was occupied in replacing the jewels one by one\ninto their bag of leather.\n\nAt last all were in, and with a sigh--for it was sad to lose sight\nof objects so beautiful--Juanna drew the mouth of the bag tight and\nprepared to place it round her neck.\n\nAt this moment it was that a hand, withered and lean with age, passed\nbeneath her eyes, and, swiftly as the snatch of an eagle's talon, seized\nthe bag and rent it from her grasp. She sprang up with a cry of dismay,\nand well might she be dismayed, for there, running from her with\nincredible speed, was Nam, the jewels in his hand.\n\nOtter and Leonard heard her cry, and, thinking that the priest was\nescaping, sped to cut him off. But he had no idea of escape, at least\nnot of such escape as they expected. Some forty yards from where Juanna\nhad been sitting, a little promontory of rock jutted out over the\nunclimbable gulf below them and towards this spot Nam directed his\nsteps. Running along the ridge he halted at its end: indeed he must do,\nunless he would fall a thousand feet or more to the bottom of the ravine\nbeneath. Then he turned and faced his pursuers, who by now had reached\nthe edge of the cliff.\n\n\"Come one step nearer,\" he cried, \"and I let this bag fall whence you\nshall never recover it, for no foot can tread these walls of rock, and\nthere is water at the bottom of the gulf.\"\n\nLeonard and Otter stopped, trembling for the fate of the jewels.\n\n\"Listen, Deliverer,\" cried Nam; \"you came to this land to seek these\ntrinkets, is it not so? And now you have found them and would be gone\nwith them? But before you go you wish to kill me for vengeance' sake,\nbecause I have shown you to be cheats, and have sought to offer you up\nto those gods whom you have blasphemed. But the red stones you desire\nare in my hands, and if I unclasp my fingers they will be lost to you\nand all the world for ever. Say now, if I bring them back to you in\nsafety, will you swear to give me my life and suffer me to go my ways in\npeace?\"\n\n\"Yes, we will swear it,\" answered Leonard, who could not conceal the\nanguish of his anxiety. \"Come back, Nam, and you shall depart unharmed;\nbut if you let the stones fall, then you shall follow them.\"\n\n\"You swear it,\" said the priest contemptuously: \"you are come to this,\nthat you will sacrifice your revenge to satisfy your greed, O White Man\nwith a noble heart! Now I will outdo you, for I, who am not noble, will\nsacrifice my life to disappoint you of your desires. What! shall the\nancient holy treasure of the People of the Mist be stolen by two white\nthieves and their black hound? Never! I would have killed you all had\ntime been granted to me, but in that I failed, and I am glad that I have\nfailed, for now I will deal you a bitterer blow than any death. May the\ncurse of Jal and Aca cleave to you, you dogs without a kennel! May you\nlive outcasts and die in the dirt, and may your fathers and your mothers\nand your children spit upon your bones as I do! Farewell!\"\n\nAnd shaking his disengaged hand at them he spat towards them; then with\na sudden motion Nam hurled himself backwards off the point of rock and\nvanished into space, bearing the treasure with him.\n\nFor a while the three stood aghast and stared at each other and the\npoint of rock which had been occupied by the venerable form of the late\nhigh priest; then Juanna sank upon the snow sobbing.\n\n\"It is my fault,\" she wailed, \"all my fault. Just now I was boasting to\nmyself that I had won wealth for you, and I have lost everything. And we\nhave suffered for nothing, and, Leonard, you are a beggar. Oh! it is too\nmuch--too much!\"\n\n\"Go out there, Otter,\" said Leonard in a hoarse voice, pointing to the\nplace where Nam had hurled himself, \"and see whether there is any chance\nof our being able to climb down into the gulf.\"\n\nThe dwarf obeyed and presently returned shaking his head.\n\n\"It is impossible, Baas,\" he said; \"the walls of rock are sheer as\nthough they had been cut with a knife; moreover there is water at the\nbottom of them, as the old wizard said, for I can hear the sound of it.\nOh! Baas, Baas, why did you not kill him at first, or let me kill him\nafterwards? Surely I told you that he would bring evil on us. Well, they\nare gone and we can never find them again, so let us save our lives if\nwe may, for after all these are more to us than bright stones. Come now\nand help me, Baas, for I have found two flat rocks that will serve our\nturn, a big one for you and the Shepherdess, since doubtless she will\nfear to make this journey alone, and a smaller one for myself.\"\n\nLeonard followed him without a word; he was too heart-broken to speak,\nwhile Juanna rose and returned to the spot where Nam had robbed her.\nLooking up presently, her eyes still blurred with tears, she saw Leonard\nand the dwarf laboriously pushing two heavy stones across the snow\ntowards her.\n\n\"Come, do not cry, Juanna,\" said Leonard, ceasing from his labours and\nlaying his hand kindly upon her shoulder, \"they are gone and there is an\nend of it. Now we must think of other things.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she answered, \"if only you had seen them, you would never stop\ncrying all your life.\"\n\n\"Then I dare say that the fit will be a short one,\" replied Leonard\ngrimly, glancing at the awful bridge which stretched between them and\nsafety.\n\n\"Listen, Juanna, you and I must lie upon this stone, and it will--so\nsays Otter--carry us across to the other side of the ravine.\"\n\n\"I cannot, I cannot,\" she gasped, \"I shall faint and fall off. I am sure\nthat I shall.\"\n\n\"But you must, Juanna,\" answered Leonard. \"At least you must choose\nbetween this and returning to the City of the Mist.\"\n\n\"I will come,\" she said. \"I know that I shall be killed, but it is\nbetter than going back to those horrible priests; and besides, it does\nnot matter now that I have lost the jewels.\"\n\n\"Jewels are not everything, Juanna.\"\n\n\"Listen, Shepherdess,\" put in Otter, \"the thing is easy, though it looks\ndifficult. All that you have to do is to shut your eyes and lie still,\nthen the stone will carry you over. I am not afraid. I will go first\nto show you the way, and where a black dwarf can pass, there you white\npeople who are so much braver can follow. But before I start, I will\ntie you and the Deliverer together with my cord, for so you will feel\nsafer.\"\n\nThen Otter dragged both stones to the very verge of the incline, and\nhaving passed the rope about the waists of Juanna and Leonard, he\nprepared himself for the journey.\n\n\"Now, Deliverer,\" he said, \"when I am safe across, all that you must do\nit to lie flat upon the stone, both of you, and to push a little with\nthe spear. Then before you know it, you will be by my side.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Leonard doubtfully. \"Well, I suppose that you had\nbetter start; waiting won't make the matter any easier.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, I will go now. Ah! little did I think that I should ever be\nforced to take such a ride as this. Well, it will be something to make\nsongs about afterwards.\"\n\nAnd Otter laid himself face downwards on the stone with a little laugh,\nthough Leonard noticed that, however brave his spirit might be, he\ncould not prevent his flesh from revealing its natural weakness, for it\nquivered pitifully.\n\n\"Now, Baas,\" he said, gripping the edges of the stone with his large\nhands, \"when I give the word do you push gently, and then you will see\nhow a black bird can fly. Put your head lower, Baas.\"\n\nLeonard obeyed, and the dwarf whispered in his ear:\n\n\"I only want to say, Baas, in case we should not meet again, for\naccidents will happen even on the safest roads, that I am sorry that I\nmade such a pig of myself yonder; it was so dull down there in that hole\nof a palace, and the fog made me see all things wrong. Moreover, drink\nand a wife have corrupted many a better man. Don't answer, Baas, but\nstart me, for I am growing afraid.\"\n\nPlacing his hand at the back of the stone, Leonard gave it a slight\npush. It began to move, very slowly at first, then more fast and faster\nyet, till it was rushing over the smooth ice pathway with a whirring\nsound like that produced by the flight of a bird. Presently it had\nreached the bottom of the first long slope and was climbing the gentle\nrise opposite, but so slowly that for a while Leonard thought that it\nwas going to stop. It crossed its brow, however, and vanished for a few\nseconds into a dip where the watchers could not see it, then it appeared\nagain at the head of the second and longest slope, of which the angle\nwas very steep. Down this the stone rushed like an arrow from a bow,\ntill it reached the narrow waist of the bridge, whereof the general\nconformation bore some resemblance to that of a dead wasp lying on its\nback. Indeed, from where Leonard and Juanna stood, the span of ice at\nthis point seemed to be no thicker than a silver thread, while Otter and\nthe stone might have been a fly upon the thread. Now of a sudden Leonard\ndistinctly saw the rock sledge and its living burden, which just then\nwas travelling its swiftest, move upwards as though it had leaped\ninto the air and then continue its course along the rising place which\nrepresented the throat of the wasp, till at length it stopped.\n\nLeonard looked at his watch; the time occupied by the transit was just\nfifty seconds, and the distance could not have been much less than half\na mile.\n\n\"See,\" he cried to Juanna, who all this while had sat with her hand\nbefore her eyes to shut out the vision of the dwarf's dreadful progress,\n\"he has crossed safely!\" and he pointed to a figure that appeared to be\ndancing with glee upon the breast of the snow slope.\n\nAs he spoke a faint sound reached their ears, for in those immense\nsilences sound can travel far. It was Otter shouting, and his words\nseemed to be, \"Come on, Baas; it is easy.\"\n\n\"I am glad he is safe,\" said Juanna faintly, \"but now we must follow\nhim. Take my handkerchief, Leonard, and tie it over my eyes, please, for\nI cannot bear to look. The idol's head was nothing to this.\"\n\nLeonard obeyed her, bidding her not to be afraid.\n\n\"Oh! but I am terribly afraid,\" she said. \"I never was so much\nfrightened in all my life, and I--I have lost the jewels! Leonard, do\nforgive me for behaving so badly to you. I know that I have behaved\nbadly in many ways, though I have been too proud to admit it before. But\nnow, when I am going to die, I want to beg your pardon. I hope you will\nthink kindly of me, Leonard, when I am dead, for I do love you with\nall my heart, indeed I do.\" And tears began to roll down beneath the\nbandage.\n\n\"Dearest,\" he answered, kissing her tenderly, \"as we are tied together,\nit seems that if you die I must die too. Do not break down now after you\nhave borne so much.\"\n\n\"It is the jewels,\" she sobbed, \"the jewels; I feel as though I had\ncommitted a murder.\"\n\n\"Oh! bother the jewels!\" said Leonard. \"We can think about them\nafterwards.\" And he advanced towards the flat stone, Juanna feeling the\nwhile as though they were two of Carrier's victims about to know the\nMarriage of the Loire.\n\nAs they came to the stone Leonard heard a sound behind him, a sound of\nfootsteps muffled by the snow, and glancing round he saw Soa rushing\ntowards them, almost naked, a spear-wound in her side, and the light of\nmadness shining in her eyes.\n\n\"Get back,\" he said sternly, \"or----\" and he lifted the great spear.\n\n\"Oh! Shepherdess,\" she wailed, \"take me with you, Shepherdess, for I\ncannot live without you.\"\n\n\"Tell her to go away,\" said Juanna, recognising the voice; \"I never want\nto see her any more.\"\n\n\"You hear, Soa,\" answered Leonard. \"Stay, how has it gone yonder? Speak\ntruly.\"\n\n\"I know not, Deliverer; when I left, Olfan and his brother still held\nthe mouth of the tunnel and were unhurt, but the captain was dead. I\nslipped past them and got this as I went,\" and she pointed to the gash\nin her side.\n\n\"If he can hold out a little longer, help may reach him,\" muttered\nLeonard. Then without more words, he laid himself and Juanna face\ndownwards on the broad stone.\n\n\"Now, Juanna,\" he said, \"we are going to start. Grip fast with your\nright hand, and see that you do not leave go of the edge of the stone,\nor we shall both slip off it.\"\n\n\"Oh! take me with you, Shepherdess, take me with you, and I will be\nwicked no more, but serve you as of old,\" shrilled the voice of Soa in\nso despairing a cry that the rocks rang.\n\n\"Hold fast,\" said Leonard through his set teeth, as, disengaging his\nright hand from about Juanna's waist, he seized the handle of the spear\nand pressed its broad blade against a knob of rock behind them. Now the\nstone, that was balanced on the very verge of the declivity, trembled\nbeneath them, and now, slowly and majestically as a vessel starting from\nher slips when the launching cord is severed, it began to move down the\nicy way.\n\nFor the first second it scarcely seemed to stir, then the motion grew\npalpable, and at that instant Leonard heard a noise behind him and felt\nhis left foot clasped by a human hand. There was a jerk that nearly\ndragged them off their sledge, but he held fast to the front edge of\nthe stone, and though he could still feel the hand upon his ankle, the\nstrain became almost imperceptible.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nTHE PASSING OF THE BRIDGE\n\nLifting his head very cautiously, Leonard looked over his shoulder and\nthe mystery was explained. In her madness and the fury of her love for\nthe mistress whom she had outraged and betrayed, Soa had striven to\nthrow herself upon the stone with them so soon as she saw it commence\nto move. She was too late, and feeling herself slipping forward, she\ngrasped despairingly at the first thing that came to her hand, which\nchanced to be Leonard's ankle. Now she must accompany them upon their\nawesome journey; only, while they rode upon the stone, she was dragged\nafter them upon her breast.\n\nA flash of pity passed through Leonard's brain as he realised her\nfearful plight. Then for a while he forgot all about her, since his\nattention was amply occupied with his own and Juanna's peril. Now they\nwere rushing down the long slope with an ever-increasing velocity, and\nnow they breasted the first rise, during the last ten yards of which,\nas in the case of Otter, the pace of the stone slowed down so much in\nproportion to the progressive exhaustion of its momentum, that Leonard\nthought they were coming to a standstill. Then it was that he kicked\nout viciously, striving to free himself from the weight of Soa, which\nthreatened to bring them to a common ruin. But she clung to him like\nivy to a tree, and he desisted from his efforts, fearing lest he should\ncause their sledge to alter its course.\n\nOn the very top of the rise the motion of the stone decreased almost to\nnothingness, then little by little increased once more as they traversed\na short sharp dip, the same in which they had lost sight of Otter, to\nbe succeeded by a gentle rise. So far, though exciting and novel, their\njourney had been comparatively safe, for the path was broad and the ice\nperfectly smooth. Its terrors were to come.\n\nLooking forward, Leonard saw that they were at the commencement of a\ndecline measuring four or five hundred yards in length, and so steep\nthat, even had it offered a good foothold, human beings could scarcely\nhave stood upon it. As yet the tongue of ice was fifty paces or more\nin width, but it narrowed rapidly as it fell, till at length near the\nopposite shore of the ravine, it fined away to a point like that of a\ngreat white needle, and then seemed to break off altogether.\n\nNow they were well under way, and now they sped down the steep green ice\nat a pace that can hardly be imagined, though perhaps it is sometimes\nequalled by an eagle rushing on its quarry from some vast height of\nair. Indeed it is possible that the sensations of an eagle making his\nheadlong descent and those of Leonard may have been very similar, with\nthe important exception that the bird feels no fear, whereas absolute\nterror are the only words wherewith to describe the mental state of the\nman. So smooth was the ice and so precipitous its pitch that he felt\nas though he were falling through space, unsupported by anything, for\ntravelling at that speed the friction of the stone was imperceptible.\nOnly the air shrieked as they clove it, and Juanna's long tresses, torn\nby it from their fastenings, streamed out behind her like a veil.\n\nDown they went, still down; half--two-thirds of the distance was done,\nthen he looked again and saw the horror that lay before them. Already\nthe bridge was narrow, barely the width of a small room; sixty yards\nfurther on it tapered to so fine a point that their stone would almost\ncover its breadth, and beneath it on either side yawned that unmeasured\ngulf wherein Nam was lost with the jewels. Nor was this all, for at its\nnarrowest _the ice band was broken away for a space of ten or twelve\nfeet_, to continue on the further side of the gap for a few yards at\na somewhat lower level, and then run upwards at a steep incline to the\nbreast of snow where Otter sat in safety.\n\nOn they whizzed, ice beneath them and before them, and ice in Leonard's\nheart, for he was frozen with fear. His breath had left him because of\nthe rush of their progress, but his senses remained painfully acute.\nInvoluntarily he glanced over the edge of the stone, saw the sheer\ndepths below him, and found himself wondering what was the law that kept\ntheir sledge upon this ribbon of ice, when it seemed so easy for it to\nwhirl off into space.\n\nNow the gap was immediately in front of them. \"God help us!\" he\nmurmured, or rather thought, for there was no time for words, and they\nhad left the road of ice and were flying through the air as though the\nstone which carried them were a living thing, that, seeing the peril,\nhad gathered up its energies and sprung forward for its life.\n\nWhat happened? Leonard never knew for certain, and Otter swore that his\nheart leaped from his bosom and stood in front of his eyes so that he\ncould not see. Before they touched the further point of ice--while\nthey were in the air, indeed--they, or rather Leonard, heard a hideous\nscream, and felt a jerk so violent that his hold of the stone was\nloosened, and it passed from beneath them. Then came a shock, less heavy\nthan might have been expected, and lo! they were spinning onwards down\nthe polished surface of the ice, while the stone which had borne them so\nfar sped on in front like a horse that has thrown its rider.\n\nLeonard felt the rubbing of the ice burn him like hot iron. He felt also\nthat his ankle was freed from the hand that had held it, then for some\nminutes he knew no more, for his senses left him. When they returned, it\nwas to hear the voice of Otter crying, \"Lie still, lie still, Baas, do\nnot stir for your life; I come.\"\n\nInstantly he was wide awake, and, moving his head ever so little, saw\ntheir situation. Then he wished that he had remained asleep, for it was\nthis:\n\nThe impetus of their rush had carried them almost to the line where the\nice stopped and the rock and snow began, within some fifteen feet of it,\nindeed. But those fifteen feet were of the smoothest ice and very sheer,\nso smooth and sheer that no man could hope to climb them. Below them the\nslope continued for about thirteen or fourteen yards, till it met the\ncorresponding incline that led to the gap in the bridge.\n\nOn this surface of ice they were lying spread-eagled. For a moment\nLeonard wondered how it was that they did not slide back to the bottom\nof the slope, there to remain till they perished, for without ropes\nand proper implements no human being could scale it. Then he saw that a\nchance had befallen them, which in after-days he was wont to attribute\nto the direct intervention of Providence.\n\nIt will be remembered that when they started, Leonard had pushed the\nrock off with a spear which Olfan had given them. This spear he drew in\nagain as they began to move, placing it between his chest and the stone,\nfor he thought that it might be of service to him should they succeed\nin crossing the gulf. When they were jerked from the sledge, and left to\nslide along the ice on the further side of the gap, in obedience to\nthe impetus given to them by the frightful speed at which they were\ntravelling, the spear, obeying the same laws of motion, accompanied\nthem, but, being of a less specific gravity, lagged behind in the race,\njust as the stone, which was heaviest, outstripped them.\n\nAs it happened, near the top of the rise there was a fissure in the\nice, and in this fissure the weapon had become fixed, its weighted blade\ncausing it to assume an upright position. When the senseless bodies of\nLeonard and Juanna had slid as far up the slope as the unexpended energy\nof their impetus would allow, naturally enough they began to move back\nagain in accordance with the laws of gravity. Then it was, as luck would\nhave it, that the spear, fixed in the crevice of the ice, saved them\nfrom destruction; for it chanced that the descent of their two forms,\npassing on either side of it, was checked by the handle of the weapon,\nwhich caught the hide rope whereby they were bound together.\n\nAll of this Leonard took in by degrees; also he discovered that Juanna\nwas either dead or senseless, at the time he could not tell which.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" he asked of Otter, who by now was on the\nverge of the ice fifteen feet above them.\n\n\"Cut steps and pull you up, Baas,\" answered the dwarf cheerfully.\n\n\"It will not be easy,\" said Leonard, glancing over his shoulder at the\nlong slope beneath, \"and if we slip or the rope breaks----\"\n\n\"Do not talk of slipping, Baas,\" replied Otter, as he began to hack at\nthe ice with the priest's heavy knife, \"and as for the rope, if it was\nstrong enough for the Water-Dweller to drag me round the pool by, it is\nstrong enough to hold you two, although it has seen some wear. I only\nwish I had such another, for then this matter would be simple.\"\n\nWorking furiously, Otter hacked at the hard surface of the ice. The\nfirst two steps he hollowed from the top of the slope lying on his\nstomach. After this difficulties presented themselves which seemed\ninsuperable, for he could not chip at the ice when he had nothing by\nwhich to support himself.\n\n\"What is to be done now?\" said Leonard.\n\n\"Keep cool, Baas, and give me time to think,\" and for a moment Otter\nsquatted down and was silent.\n\n\"I have it,\" he said presently, and rising he took off his goat-skin\ncloak and cut it into strips, each strip measuring about two inches in\nwidth by two feet six inches in length. These strips he knotted together\nfirmly, making a serviceable rope of them, long enough to reach to where\nLeonard and Juanna were suspended on the stout handle of the spear.\n\nThen he took the stake which had already done him such good service,\nand, sharpening its point, fixed it as deeply as he could into the snow\nand earth on the border of the ice belt, and tied the skin rope to it.\n\n\"Now, Baas,\" he said, \"all is well, for I can begin from the bottom.\"\n\nAnd, without further words, he let himself down till he hung beside\nthem.\n\n\"Is the Shepherdess dead, Baas?\" he asked, glancing at Juanna's pale\nface and closed eyes, \"or does she only sleep?\"\n\n\"I think that she is in a swoon,\" answered Leonard; \"but for heaven's\nsake be quick, Otter, for I am being frozen on this ice. What is your\nplan now?\"\n\n\"This, Baas: to tie about your middle the end of the rope that I have\nmade from the cloak, then to undo the cord that binds you and the\nShepherdess together, and return to the top of the slope. Once there I\ncan pull her up by the hide line, for it is strong, and she will slip\neasily over the ice, and you can follow.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Leonard.\n\nThen hanging by one hand the dwarf managed, with such assistance as\nLeonard could give him, to knot beneath Leonard's arms the end of the\nrope which he had constructed from the skin garment. Next he set to work\nto untie the hide cord, thereby freeing him from Juanna. And now\ncame the most difficult and dangerous part of the task, for Leonard,\nsuspended from the shaft of the spear by one hand, must support Juanna's\nsenseless form with the other, while Otter made shift to drag himself\nto the summit of the ice, holding the hide line in his teeth. The spear\nbent dreadfully, and Leonard did not dare to put any extra strain upon\nthe roughly fastened cord of goat-skin, by which the dwarf was hauling\nhimself up the ice, for if it gave they must all be precipitated to the\ndip below, there to perish miserably. Faint and frozen as he was, it\nseemed hours to him before Otter reached the top and called to him to\nlet go of Juanna.\n\nLeonard obeyed, and seating himself on the snow, his feet supported by\nthe edge of the ice, the dwarf put out his strength and began to pull\nher up. Strong as he was, it proved as much as he was able to do;\nindeed, had Juanna lain on any other material than ice, he could not\nhave done it at all. But in the end he succeeded, and with a gasp of\ngratitude Leonard saw her stretched safe upon the snow.\n\nNow Otter, hastily undoing the cord from Juanna's waist, made it into\na running noose which he threw down to Leonard, who placed it over his\nshoulders. Having lifted the spear from the cleft in which it stood, he\ncommenced his ascent. His first movements cost him a pang of agony,\nand no wonder, for the blood from wounds that had been caused by the\nfriction of his flesh as he was hurled along the surface of the slide,\nhad congealed, freezing his limbs to the ice, whence they could not\neasily be loosened. The pain, sharp as it was, did him good, however,\nfor it aroused his benumbed energies and enabled him to drag on the\ngoat-skin cord with all his strength, while Otter tugged at that which\nwas beneath his arms.\n\nWell for him was it that the dwarf had taken the precaution of throwing\ndown this second line, for presently Otter's stake, which had no firm\nhold in the frozen earth, came out and slid away, striking Leonard as it\npassed and bearing the knotted lengths of the cloak with it. The dwarf\ncried aloud and bent forward as though he were about to fall. By a\nfearful effort he recovered himself and held fast the rope in his hand,\nwhile Leonard, suspended by it, swung to and fro on the surface of the\nice like the pendulum of a clock.\n\nThen followed the most terrible moments of all their struggle against\nthe difficulties of this merciless place. The dwarf held fast above, and\nLeonard, ceasing to swing, lay with hands and legs outstretched on the\nface of the ice.\n\n\"Now, Baas,\" said Otter, \"be brave, and when I pull, do you wriggle\nforward.\"\n\nHe tugged till the thin hide rope stretched, while Leonard clawed and\nkicked at the ice with his toes, knees, and disengaged hand.\n\nAlas! it gave no hold--he might as well have tried to climb a dome of\nplate glass at an angle of sixty degrees.\n\n\"Rest awhile, Baas,\" said the dwarf, whose breath was coming in great\nsobs, \"then make a little nick in the ice with the blade of the spear,\nand when next I pull, try to set some of your weight upon it.\"\n\nLeonard did as he was bid without speaking.\n\n\"Now,\" said the dwarf, and with a push and a struggle Leonard was two\nfeet higher up the incline. Again the process was repeated, and this\ntime he got his left hand into the lowest of the two steps that Otter\nhad hacked with the knife, and once more they paused for breath. A third\neffort, the fiercest of them all, a clasping of hands, and he was lying\ntrembling like a frightened child above the glacier's lip.\n\nThe ordeal was over, that danger was done with, but at what a cost!\nLeonard's nerves were completely shattered, he could not stand, his\nface was bleeding, his nails were broken, and the bone of one knee was\nexposed by the friction of the ice, to say nothing of the shock to the\nsystem and the bruises which he had received when he was hurled from the\nstone. Otter's condition was a little better, but his hands were cut\nby the rope and he was utterly exhausted with toil and the strain of\nsuspense. Indeed, of the three Juanna had come off by far the best, for\nshe swooned at the very beginning of the passage of the bridge, and when\nthey were jerked from the stone, being lighter than Leonard, she had\nfallen upon him. Moreover, the thick goat-skin cloak which was wrapped\nabout her had protected her from all hurt beyond a few trifling cuts and\nbruises. Of their horrible position when they were hanging to the spear,\nand the rest of the adventure, including the death of Soa, she knew\nnothing, and it was well for her reason that this was so.\n\n\"Otter,\" murmured Leonard in a shaking voice, \"have you lost that gourd\nof spirit?\"\n\n\"No, Baas, it is safe.\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven!\" he said; \"hold it to my lips if you can.\"\n\nThe dwarf lifted it with a trembling hand, and Leonard gulped down the\nfiery liquor.\n\n\"That's better,\" he said; \"take some yourself.\"\n\n\"Nay, Baas, I have sworn to touch drink no more,\" Otter answered,\nlooking at the gourd longingly; \"besides you and the Shepherdess will\nwant it all. I have some food here and I will eat.\"\n\n\"What happened to Soa, Otter?\"\n\n\"I could not see rightly, Baas, I was too frightened, much more\nfrightened than I had been when I rode the stone myself; but I think\nthat her legs caught in the ice on this side of the hole, and so she\nfell. It was a good end for her, the vicious old cow!\" he added, with a\ntouch of satisfaction.\n\n\"It was very near being a bad end for us,\" answered Leonard, \"but we\nhave managed to come out of it alive somehow. Not for all the rubies in\nthe world would I cross that place again.\"\n\n\"Nor I, Baas. _Wow!_ it was awful. Now my stomach went through my head,\nand now my head went through my stomach, and the air was red and green\nand blue, and devils shouted at me out of it. Yes, and when I came to\nthe hole, there I saw the Water-Dweller all fashioned in fire waiting\nwith an open mouth to eat me. It was the drink that made me think of\nthese things, Baas, and that is why I have sworn to touch it no\nmore. Yes, I swore it as I flew through the air and saw the flaming\nWater-Dweller beneath me. And now, Baas, I am a little rested, so let us\ntry and wake up the Shepherdess, and get us gone.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Leonard, \"though I am sure I do not know where we are to go\nto. It can't be far, for I am nearly spent.\"\n\nThen crawling to where Juanna lay wrapped in her cloak, Otter poured\nsome of the native spirit down her throat while Leonard rubbed her\nhands. Presently this treatment produced its effect, for she sat up with\na start, and seeing the ice before her, began to shriek, saying, \"Take\nme away; I can't do it, Leonard, I can't indeed.\"\n\n\"All right, dear,\" he answered, \"you have done it. We are over.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she said, \"I _am_ thankful. But where is Soa? I thought that I\nheard her throw herself down behind us.\"\n\n\"Soa is dead,\" he answered. \"She fell down the gulf and nearly pulled\nus with her. I will tell you all about it afterwards; you are not fit to\nhear it now. Come, dear, let us be going out of this accursed place.\"\n\nJuanna staggered to her feet.\n\n\"I am so stiff and sore that I can hardly stand,\" she said, \"but,\nLeonard, what is the matter with you? You are covered with blood.\"\n\n\"I will tell you afterwards,\" he replied again.\n\nThen Otter collected their baggage, which consisted chiefly of the hide\nline and the spear, and they crawled forward up the snow-slope. Some\ntwenty or thirty yards ahead of them, and almost side by side, lay the\ntwo glacier stones on which they had passed the bridge, and near them\nthose which Otter had despatched as pioneers on the previous morning.\nThey looked at them wondering. Who could have believed that these inert\nthings, not an hour before, had been speeding down the icy way quicker\nthan any express train that ever travelled, and they with them?\n\nOne thing was certain: did they remain unbroken for another two or three\nmillion years, and that is a short life for a stone, they would never\nagain make so strange a journey.\n\nThen the three toiled on to the top of the snow-slope, which was about\nfour hundred yards away.\n\n\"Look, Baas,\" said Otter, who had turned to gaze a fond farewell at the\ngulf behind; \"there are people yonder on the further side.\"\n\nHe was right. On the far brink of the crevasse were the forms of men,\nwho seemed to be waving their arms in the air and shouting. But whether\nthese were the priests who, having overcome the resistance of Olfan, had\npursued the fugitives to kill them, or the soldiers of the king who had\nconquered the priests, the distance would not allow them to see. The\nfate of Olfan and the further domestic history of the People of the Mist\nwere now sealed books to them, for they never heard any more of these\nmatters, nor are they likely to do so.\n\nThen the travellers began to descend from field to field of snow, the\ngreat peak above alone remaining to remind them that they were near to\nthe country of the Mist. Once they stopped to eat a little of such food\nas they had with them, and often enough to rest, for their strength was\nsmall. Indeed, as they dragged themselves wearily forward, each of the\nmen holding Juanna by the hand, Leonard found himself wondering how it\ncame about, putting aside the bodily perils from which they had escaped,\nthat they had survived the exhaustion and the horrors, physical and\nmental, of the last forty-eight hours.\n\nBut there they were still alive, though in a sorry plight, and before\nevening they found themselves below the snow line in a warm and genial\nclimate.\n\n\"I must stop,\" said Juanna as the sun began to set; \"I can drag myself\nno further.\"\n\nLeonard looked at Otter in despair.\n\n\"There is a big tree yonder, Baas,\" said the dwarf with an attempt at\ncheerfulness, \"and water by it. It is a good place to camp, and here the\nair is warm, we shall not suffer from cold. Nay, we are lucky indeed;\nthink how we passed last night.\"\n\nThey reached the tree, and Juanna sank down half fainting against its\nbole. With difficulty Leonard persuaded her to swallow a little meat\nand a mouthful of spirit, and then, to his relief, she relapsed into a\ncondition which partook more of the nature of stupor than of sleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nOTTER'S FAREWELL\n\nThe night which followed, Leonard is wont to declare, proved to be the\nvery worst that he ever spent in his life. Notwithstanding his intense\nweariness, he could not sleep, his nerves were too shattered to allow\nof it. Whenever he shut his eyes, he saw himself hanging head downwards\nover the oubliette in the cell beneath the idol, or flying through the\nair across the dreadful gap in the ice-bridge, or in some other position\nof terror, similar to those with which they had made such intimate\nacquaintance of late. Did these visions cease, from time to time he\nseemed to hear the voice of Francisco bidding him farewell, the yell of\nSoa falling to her dreadful death, or Nam raving his last defiance at\nthem. Also his hurts, which were many, gave him great pain, and though\nthe climate here was mild, the breeze from the snow heights chilled him\nthrough, and they had not even a match wherewith to light a fire and\nscare the wild beasts that roared about them.\n\nRarely have three human beings been in a position more desolate\nand desperate than that in which they found themselves this night,\nexhausted, unarmed, almost without food or clothing, and wandering they\nknew not where through the vastness of Central Africa. Unless some help\nfound them, as Leonard was aware, they must perish of starvation, by the\nfangs of lions, or the spears of natives. It was impossible that they\ncould live through another week, and the thought came into his mind that\nit would be well for them if they died that night and had done with it.\n\nIt would be well; yes, and it would have been better if he had been laid\nby the side of his brother Tom before ever he listened to Soa's accursed\ntale of the People of the Mist and their treasure of rubies. Only then\nhe would never have known Juanna, for she must have died in the slave\ncamp.\n\nThis was the fruit of putting faith in the visions of dying men. And\nyet, it was strange, he had _nearly_ got the money and \"by the help of\na woman,\" for those rubies would have sufficed to buy back Outram ten\ntimes over. But, alas! nearly is not quite. That dream was done with,\nand even if they escaped, it would be to find himself more utterly\nbeggared than before, for now he would be a married beggar.\n\nAt last the night wore away and the dawn came, but Juanna did not wake\nuntil the sun was high. Leonard, who had crept to a little distance--for\nnow he was quite unable to walk--saw her sit up and crawled back to her.\nShe stared at him vacantly and said something about Jane Beach. Then he\nknew that she was wandering. There was nothing to be done. What could be\ndone in that wilderness with a woman in delirium, except wait for death?\n\nAccordingly Leonard and Otter waited for some hours. Then the dwarf,\nwho was in far the best condition of the three, took the spear--Olfan's\ngift--and said that he would go and seek for food, since their store was\nexhausted. Leonard nodded, though he knew that there was little chance\nof a man armed with a spear alone being able to kill game, and Otter\nwent.\n\nTowards evening he returned, reporting that he had seen plenty of buck,\nbut could not get near them, which was just what his master expected.\nThat night they passed hungry, by turns watching Juanna, who was still\ndelirious. At dawn Otter started out again, leaving Leonard, who had\nbeen unable to sleep as on the previous night, crouched at Juanna's\nside, his face buried in his hands.\n\nBefore noon Leonard chanced to look up, and saw the dwarf reeling\ntowards him, for he also was faint with want of food. Indeed his great\nhead and almost naked body, through the skin of which the misshapen\nbones seemed to start in every direction, presented so curious a\nspectacle that his master, whose brain was shaken by weakness, began to\nlaugh.\n\n\"Don't laugh, Baas,\" gasped the dwarf; \"either I am mad, or we are\nsaved.\"\n\n\"Then I think that you must be mad, Otter, for we shall take a deal\nof saving,\" he answered wearily, for he had ceased to believe in good\nfortune. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"This, Baas. There is a white man coming this way and more than a\nhundred servants with him; they are marching up the mountain slope.\"\n\n\"You are certainly mad, Otter,\" Leonard replied. \"What in the names of\nJal and Aca is a white man doing here? I am the only one of that species\nwho have been fool enough to penetrate these regions, I and Francisco,\"\nand he shut his eyes and dozed off.\n\nOtter looked at him for a while, then he tapped his forehead\nsignificantly and started down the slope again. An hour later, Leonard,\nstill dozing, was awakened by a sound of many voices, and by a hand that\nshook him not too gently.\n\n\"Awake, Baas,\" said the dwarf, for the hand was his; \"I have caught the\nwhite man and brought him here.\"\n\nLeonard staggered to his feet and saw before him, surrounded by\ngun-bearers and other attendants, an English gentleman, rather under\nthan over middle age, with a round and kindly face tanned by the sun,\nand somewhat deep-set dark eyes having an eyeglass fixed in one of them,\nthrough which its wearer regarded him with much commiseration.\n\n\"How do you do, sir?\" said the stranger in a pleasant voice. \"So far\nas I can make out from your servant you seem to be in a baddish way. By\nGeorge! there is a lady.\"\n\n\"How do you do?\" answered Leonard. \"Capital sun-helmet that of yours.\nI envy it, but you see I have had to go bare-headed lately,\" and he\nran his fingers through his matted hair. \"Who is the maker of that\neight-bore? Looks a good gun!\"\n\n\"Achmet,\" said the stranger, turning to an Arab at his side, \"go to the\nfirst donkey and fetch this lord of the earth a pint of champagne and\nsome oatmeal cakes; he seems to want them. Tell the bearers also to\nbring up my tent and to pitch it there by the water. Quick, now.\"\n\nForty-eight hours had passed, and the benevolent stranger was sitting\non a camp-stool in the door of his tent, looking at two forms that lay\nwrapped in blankets and comfortably asleep within it.\n\n\"I suppose that they will wake some time,\" he murmured, dropping his\neyeglass and taking the pipe from his mouth. \"The quinine and champagne\nhave done them a lot of good: there is nothing like quinine and\nchampagne. But what an unconscionable liar that dwarf must be! There\nis only one thing he can do better, and that is eat. I never saw a chap\nstow away so much grub, though I must say that he looks as though he\nneeded it. Still, allowing for all deductions, it is a precious queer\nstory. Who are they, and what the deuce are they doing here? One thing\nis clear: I never saw a finer-looking man nor a prettier girl.\" And\nhe filled his pipe again, replaced the eyeglass in his eye, and began\nsmoking.\n\nTen minutes later Juanna sat up suddenly, whereupon the stranger\nwithdrew out of sight. She looked round her wildly, then, seeing Leonard\nlying at the further side of the tent, she crept to him and began\nkissing him, saying: \"Leonard! Thank God that you are still alive,\nLeonard! I dreamed that we both were dead. Thank God that you are\nalive!\"\n\nThen the man who had been thus adjured woke up also and returned her\ncaresses.\n\n\"By George! this is quite affecting,\" said the traveller. \"I suppose\nthat they are married; if not, they ought to be. Any way, I had better\nclear out for a while.\"\n\nAn hour later he returned to find that the pair had made themselves as\npresentable as soap and water, and some few spare garments which he had\nsent to Leonard, would allow, and were now sitting in the sun outside\nthe tent. He advanced, lifting his helmet, and they rose to meet him.\n\n\"I suppose that I had better introduce myself,\" he said with some\nhesitation, for he was a shy man. \"I am an English traveller, doing a\nlittle exploring on my own account, for lack of any other occupation,\nand my name is Sydney Wallace.\"\n\n\"Mine is Leonard Outram,\" answered Leonard, \"and this young lady is Miss\nJuanna Rodd.\"\n\nMr. Wallace started and bowed again. So they were _not_ married!\n\n\"We are deeply indebted to you, sir,\" went on Leonard; \"for you have\nrescued us from death.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" answered Mr. Wallace. \"You must thank that servant of\nyours, the dwarf, and not me, for if he had not seen us, I should have\npassed a mile or more to the left of you. The fact is that I am rather\nfond of mountaineering, and seeing this great peak above us--I am told\nthat it is the highest in the Bisa-Mushinga Mountains--I thought that\nI might as well have a try at it before I turn homewards, _via_ Lake\nNyassa, Livingstonia, Blantyre, and Quilimane. But perhaps you will not\nmind telling me how you came to be here. I have heard something from the\ndwarf, but his tale seems a little too steep.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you will think ours rather steeper, Mr. Wallace,\"\nsaid Leonard, and he proceeded to give him a short outline of their\nadventures.\n\nWhen he came to their arrival among the People of the Mist, and\ndescribed the inauguration of Otter and Juanna as gods in the temple of\nthe colossus, he noticed that his auditor had let the eyeglass fall from\nhis round eye, and was regarding him with mild amazement.\n\n\"I am afraid that all this does not interest you,\" said Leonard stiffly.\n\n\"On the contrary, Mr. Outram, it interests me very much. I am\nexceedingly fond of romances, and this is rather a good one.\"\n\n\"As I thought; it is scarcely worth while to go on,\" said Leonard again.\n\"Well, I cannot wonder that you do not believe me.\"\n\n\"Leonard,\" interposed Juanna quietly, \"you still have the star ruby;\nshow it to Mr. Wallace!\"\n\nHe did so, somewhat sulkily, and then, as he seemed disinclined to say\nanything more, Juanna took up the tale, showing in evidence of its truth\nthe spear, the frayed rope, and the tattered white robe which she had\nworn in her character of Aca, and, indeed, still wore beneath poor\nFrancisco's cassock--for she had no other.\n\nMr. Wallace heard her out, then, without making any comment, he rose,\nsaying that he must try to shoot some meat for the camp, and begged that\nthey would make themselves comfortable until his return that evening.\n\nBefore sundown he reappeared, and, coming straight to the tent, asked\ntheir pardon for his incredulity.\n\n\"I have been up yonder,\" he said, \"following your spoor backwards. I\nhave seen the snow-bridge and the stones, and the nicks which the dwarf\ncut in the ice. All is just as you told me, and it only remains for me\nto congratulate you upon having escaped from the strangest series of\ndangers that ever I heard of\"; and he held out his hand, which both\nLeonard and Juanna shook warmly.\n\n\"By the way,\" he added, \"I sent men to examine the gulf for several\nmiles, but they report to me that they found no spot where it would be\npossible to descend it, and I fear, therefore, that the jewels are lost\nfor ever. I confess that I should have liked to try to penetrate\ninto the Mist country, but my nerves are not strong enough for the\nice-bridge, and if they were, stones won't slide uphill. Besides, you\nmust have had about enough of roughing it, and will be anxious to turn\nyour faces towards civilisation. So after you have rested another couple\nof days I think that we had better start for Quilimane, which, barring\naccidents, is about three months' march from here.\"\n\nShortly afterwards they started accordingly, but with the details of\ntheir march we need not concern ourselves. An exception must be\nmade, however, in the case of a single event which happened at the\nmission-station of Blantyre. That event was the wedding of Leonard and\nJuanna in conformance with the ceremonies of their own church.\n\nNo word of marriage had been spoken between them for some weeks, and\nyet the thought of it was never out of the minds of either. Indeed, had\ntheir feelings been much less tender towards each other than was the\ncase, it would still have been desirable, in view of the extraordinary\nintimacy into which they had been thrown during the past months, that\nthey should become man and wife. Leonard felt that alone as she was in\nthe wide world, nothing short of mutual aversion would have justified\nhim in separating from Juanna, and as it was love and not aversion\nthat he entertained towards her, this argument came home to him with\novermastering force.\n\n\"Juanna,\" he said to her on the day of their arrival at Blantyre, \"you\nremember some words that passed between your father and myself when he\nlay upon his death-bed, to the effect that, should we both wish it, he\ntrusted to my honour to remarry you formally as soon as an opportunity\nmight arise.\n\n\"Now the opportunity is here, and I ask you if you desire to take me for\nyour husband, as, above everything in the world, I desire to make you my\nbeloved wife.\"\n\nShe coloured to her beautiful eyes and answered in a voice that was\nalmost a whisper:\n\n\"If you wish it and think me worthy of you, Leonard, you know that\nI wish it also. I have always loved you, dear, yes, even when I was\nbehaving worst to you; but there is--Jane Beach!\"\n\n\"I have told you before, Juanna,\" he answered with some little\nirritation, \"and now I tell you again, that Jane Beach and I have done\nwith each other.\"\n\n\"I am sure that I am very glad to hear it,\" Juanna replied, still\nsomewhat dubiously. The rest of that conversation, being of a private\ncharacter, will scarcely interest the public.\n\nWhen he spoke thus, Leonard little knew after what fashion Jane Beach\nand he had wound up their old love affair.\n\nTwo days later Leonard Outram took Juanna Rodd to wife, \"to have and to\nhold, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and\nin health, to love and to cherish till death did them part,\" and their\nrescuer, Sydney Wallace, who by now had become their fast friend, gave\nher away.\n\nVery curious were the memories that passed through Juanna's mind as\nshe stood by her husband's side in the little grass-roofed chapel of\nBlantyre, for was this not the third time that she had been married, and\nnow only of her own free will? She bethought her of that wild scene in\nthe slave camp; of Francisco who died to save her, and of the blessing\nwhich he had called down upon her and this very man; of that other\nscene in the rock prison, when, to protect Leonard's life, she was\nwed, according to the custom of the Children of the Mist, to that\ntrue-hearted gentleman and savage, Olfan, their king. Then she awoke\nwith a happy sigh to know that the lover at her side could never be\ntaken from her again until death claimed one of them.\n\n\"We shall be dreadfully poor, Leonard,\" she said to him afterwards; \"it\nwould have been much better for you, dear, if I had fallen into the gulf\ninstead of the rubies.\"\n\n\"I am not of your opinion, love,\" he answered with a smile for he was\nvery happy. \"Hang the rubies! Your price is far above rubies, and no man\nmay struggle against fate. I have always been able to make a living for\nmyself heretofore, and I do not doubt that I shall continue to do so for\nboth of us, and we will leave the rest to Providence. You are more to\nme, Juanna, than any wealth--more even than Outram.\"\n\nThat evening Mr. Wallace found Otter gazing disconsolately at the little\nhouse in which Leonard and Juanna were staying.\n\n\"Are you sad because your master is married, Otter?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" answered the dwarf, \"I am glad. For months he has been running\nafter her and dreaming of her, and now at last he has got her.\nHenceforth she must dream of him and run after him, and he will have\ntime to think about other people, who love him quite as well.\"\n\nAnother month or so went by while the party journeyed in easy stages\ntowards the coast, and never had wedded lovers a happier honeymoon, or\none more unconventional, than that passed by Leonard and Juanna, though\nperhaps Mr. Wallace and Otter did not find the contemplation of their\nraptures a very exhilarating occupation.\n\nAt last they reached Quilimane in safety, and pitched their camp on\nsome rising ground outside of the settlement, which is unhealthy. Next\nmorning at daybreak Mr. Wallace started to the post-office, where he\nexpected to find letters. Leonard and Juanna did not accompany him, but\nwent for a walk before the sun grew hot. Then it was, as they walked,\nthat a certain fact came home to them; namely, that they could not avail\nthemselves of their host's kindness any longer, and, further, that they\nwere quite penniless. When one is moving slowly across the vast African\nwilds, and living on the abounding game, love and kisses seem an ample\nprovision for all wants. But the matter strikes the mind in a different\nlight after the trip is done, and civilisation with its necessities\nlooms large in the immediate future.\n\n\"What are we to do, Juanna?\" asked Leonard in dismay. \"We have no money\nto enable us to reach Natal or anywhere, and no credit on which to\ndraw.\"\n\n\"I suppose that we must sell the great ruby,\" she answered, with a sigh,\n\"though I shall be sorry to part with it.\"\n\n\"Nobody will buy such a stone here, Juanna, and it may not be a real\nruby after all. Perhaps Wallace might be willing to advance me a trifle\non it, though I hate having to ask him.\"\n\nThen they went back to breakfast, which they did not find an altogether\ncheerful meal. As they were finishing, Mr. Wallace returned from the\ntown.\n\n\"I have got good news,\" he said; \"the British India mail will be here in\ntwo days, so I shall pay off my men and go up to Aden in her, and thence\nhome. Of course you will come too, for, like me, I expect you have had\nenough of Africa for the present. Here are some copies of the weekly\nedition of the 'Times'; look through them, Mrs. Outram, and see the news\nwhile I read my letters.\"\n\nLeonard turned aside moodily and lit his pipe. How was he to find\nmoney to take even a third-class passage on the British India mail? But\nJuanna, obeying the instinct that prompts a woman to keep up appearances\nat all hazards, took one of the papers and opened it, although the tears\nwhich swam in her eyes would scarcely suffer her to see the print. Thus\nthings went on for ten minutes or more, as she idly turned the pages\nof two or three issues of the weekly \"Times,\" trying to collect her\nthoughts and pick up the thread of current events.\n\nBut it is wonderful how uninteresting and far-away those events appear\nafter the reader has been living a life to herself for a year or so, and\nJuanna, preoccupied as she was with her own thoughts, was about to give\nup the attempt as a failure, when the name of _Outram_ started to her\neyes.\n\nA minute later her two companions heard a sharp exclamation and turned\nround.\n\n\"What is the matter, Mrs. Outram?\" said Wallace. \"Has France declared\nwar against Germany, or is Mr. Gladstone dead?\"\n\n\"Oh! no, something much more important than that. Listen to this\nadvertisement, Leonard:--\n\n\"'If Leonard Outram, second son of Sir Thomas Outram, Bart., late of\nOutram Hall, who was last heard of in the territory to the north of\nDelagoa Bay, Eastern Africa, or, in the event of his death, his lawful\nheirs, will communicate with the undersigned, he or they will hear of\nsomething very greatly to his or their advantage. Thomson & Turner, 2\nAlbert Court, London, E.C.'\"\n\n\n\"Are you joking, Juanna?\" said Leonard after a pause.\n\n\"Look for yourself,\" she answered.\n\nHe took the paper, and read and reread the notice.\n\n\"Well, there is one thing certain,\" he said, \"that no one ever stood\nin greater need of hearing something to his advantage than I do at\nthis moment, for excepting the ruby, which may not be a true stone, we\nhaven't a stiver to bless ourselves with in the world. Indeed, I\ndon't know how I am to avail myself of Messrs. Thomson & Turner's kind\ninvitation, unless I write them a letter and go to live in a Kaffir hut\ntill the answer comes.\"\n\n\"Don't let that trouble you, my dear fellow,\" said Wallace; \"I can get\nplenty of cash here, and it is very much at your service.\"\n\n\"I am ashamed to take further advantage of your kindness,\" answered\nLeonard, flushing. \"This advertisement may mean nothing, or perhaps a\nlegacy of fifty pounds, though I am sure I don't know who would leave me\neven that sum. And then, how should I repay you?\"\n\n\"Stuff!\" said Wallace.\n\n\"Well,\" replied Leonard, \"beggars must put their pride in their pockets.\nIf you will lend me a couple of hundred pounds and take the ruby in\npledge, I shall be even more grateful to you than I am at present, and\nthat is saying a good deal.\"\n\nOn this business basis the matter was ultimately arranged, though within\nhalf an hour Wallace handed back the great stone into Juanna's keeping,\nbidding her \"keep it dark\"; an injunction which she obeyed in every\nsense of the word, for she hid the ruby where once the poison had\nlain--in her hair.\n\nTwo busy days went by, and on the third morning a messenger came running\nfrom the town to announce that the northward mail was in sight. Then it\nwas that Otter, who all this while had said nothing, advanced solemnly\ntowards Leonard and Juanna, holding his hand outstretched.\n\n\"What is the matter, Otter?\" asked Leonard, who was engaged in helping\nWallace to pack his hunting trophies.\n\n\"Nothing, Baas; I have come to say good-bye to you and the Shepherdess,\nthat is all. I wish to go now before I see the Steam-fish carry you\naway.\"\n\n\"Go!\" said Leonard; \"you wish to go?\"\n\nSomehow Otter had become so much a part of their lives, that, even\nin their preparations to leave for England, neither of them had ever\nthought of parting from him.\n\n\"Why do you wish to go?\" he added.\n\n\"Because I am an ugly old black dog, Baas, and can be of no further use\nto you out yonder,\" and he nodded towards the sea.\n\n\"I suppose you mean that you do not want to leave Africa, even for a\nwhile,\" said Leonard, with ill-concealed grief and vexation. \"Well, it\nis hard to part with you like this. Also,\" he added with a little laugh,\n\"it is awkward, for I owe you more than a year's wages, and have not\nthe money to spare to pay you. Moreover, I had taken your passage on the\nship.\"\n\n\"What does the Baas say?\" asked Otter slowly; \"that he has bought me a\nplace in the Steam-fish?\"\n\nLeonard nodded.\n\n\"Then I beg your pardon, Baas. I thought that you had done with me and\nwere going to throw me away like a worn-out spear.\"\n\n\"So you wish to come, Otter?\" said Leonard.\n\n\"Wish to come!\" he answered wonderingly. \"Are you not my father and my\nmother, and is not the place where you may be my place? Do you know what\nI was going to do just now, Baas? I was going to climb to the top of\na tree and watch the Steam-fish till it vanished over the edge of the\nworld; then I would have taken this rope, which already has served me\nwell among the People of the Mist, and set it about my throat and hanged\nmyself there in the tree, for that is the best end for old dogs, Baas.\"\n\nLeonard turned away to hide the tears which started to his eyes, for\nthe dwarf's fidelity touched him more than he cared to show. Seeing his\ntrouble, Juanna took up the talk to cover his confusion.\n\n\"I fear that you will find it cold over yonder, Otter,\" she said. \"It is\na land of fog, they tell me, and there are none of your own people, no\nwives or Kaffir beer. Also, we may be poor and have to live hardly.\"\n\n\"Of fog I have seen something lately, Shepherdess,\" answered the dwarf;\n\"and yet I was happy in the fog, because I was near the Baas. Of hard\nliving I have seen something also, and still I was happy, because I was\nnear the Baas. Once I had a wife and beer in plenty, more than a man\ncould want, and then I was unhappy, because they estranged me from the\nBaas, and he knew that I had ceased to be Otter, his servant whom he\ntrusted, and had become a beast. Therefore, Shepherdess, I would see no\nmore of wives and beer.\"\n\n\"Otter, you idiot,\" broke in Leonard brusquely, \"you had better stop\ntalking and get something to eat, for it will be the last meal that you\nwill wish to see for many a day.\"\n\n\"The Baas is right,\" replied the dwarf; \"moreover, I am hungry, for\nsorrow has kept me from food for these two days. Now I will fill myself\nfull, that I may have something to offer to the Black Water when he\nshakes me in his anger.\"\n\n\n\nENVOI\n\nTHE END OF THE ADVENTURE\n\nSix weeks or so had passed when a four-wheeled cab drew up at the door\nof 2 Albert Court, London, E.C.\n\nThe progress of this vehicle had excited some remark among the more\nyouthful and lighter-minded denizens of the City, for on its box,\narrayed in an ill-fitting suit of dittoes and a brown hat some sizes to\nsmall for him, sat a most strange object, whose coal-black countenance,\ndwarfed frame, and enormous nose and shoulders attracted their ribald\nobservance.\n\n\"Look at him, Bill,\" said one youth to an acquaintance; \"he's escaped\nfrom Madame Tussaud's, he has. Painted hisself over with Day & Martin's\nbest, and bought a secondhand Guy Fawkes nose.\"\n\nJust then his remarks were cut short, for Otter, having been made to\nunderstand by the driver that they had arrived at their destination,\ndescended from the box in a manner so original, that it is probably\npeculiar to the aborigines of Central Africa, and frightened that boy\naway.\n\nFrom the cab emerged Leonard and Juanna, looking very much the better\nfor their sea journey. Indeed, having recovered her health and spirits,\nand being very neatly dressed in a grey frock, with a wide black hat\ntrimmed with ostrich feathers, Juanna looked what she was, a very lovely\nwoman. Entering an outer office Leonard asked if Messrs. Thomson &\nTurner were to be seen.\n\n\"Mr. Turner is within, sir,\" answered a clerk of venerable appearance.\n\"Mr. Thomson\"--here his glance fell upon Otter and suddenly he froze up,\nthen added with a jerk--\"has been dead a hundred years! Thomson, sir,\"\nhe explained, recovering his dignity, but with his eyes still fixed on\nOtter, \"was the founder of this firm; he died in the time of George\nIII. That is his picture over the door--the person with a harelip and a\nsnuffbox.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Leonard. \"As Mr. Thomson is not available, perhaps you\nwill tell Mr. Turner that a gentleman would like to speak to him.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said the old clerk, still staring fixedly at Otter,\nwhose aspect appeared to fascinate him as much as that worthy had been\nfascinated by the eyes of the Water-Dweller. \"Have you an appointment,\nsir?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Leonard. \"Tell him that it is in reference to an\nadvertisement which his firm inserted in the 'Times' some months ago.\"\n\nThe clerk started, wondering if this could be the missing Mr. Outram.\nThat much-sought-for individual was understood to have resided in\nAfrica, which is the home of dwarfs and other oddities. Once more he\nstared at Otter and vanished through a swing door.\n\nPresently he returned. \"Mr. Turner will see you, sir, if you and the\nlady will please to step in. Does this--gentleman--wish to accompany\nyou?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Leonard, \"he can stop here.\"\n\nThereupon the clerk handed Otter a tall stool, on which the dwarf\nperched himself disconsolately. Then he opened the swing door and\nushered Leonard and his wife into Mr. Turner's private room.\n\n\"Whom have I the pleasure of addressing?\" said a bland, stout gentleman,\nrising from before a table strewn with papers. \"Pray be seated, madam.\"\n\nLeonard drew from his pocket a copy of the weekly \"Times\" and handed it\nto him, saying:\n\n\"I understand that you inserted this advertisement.\"\n\n\"Certainly we did,\" answered the lawyer after glancing at it. \"Do you\nbring me any news of Mr. Leonard Outram?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. I am he, and this lady is my wife.\"\n\nThe lawyer bowed politely. \"This is most fortunate,\" he said; \"we had\nalmost given up hope--but, of course, some proofs of identity will be\nrequired.\"\n\n\"I think that they can be furnished to your satisfaction,\" answered\nLeonard briefly. \"Meanwhile, for the sake of argument, perhaps you will\nassume that I am the person whom I state myself to be, and inform me to\nwhat this advertisement refers.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered the lawyer, \"there can be no harm in that. Sir\nThomas Outram, the late baronet, as you are doubtless aware, had two\nsons, Thomas and Leonard. Leonard, the second son, as a young man was\nengaged to, or rather had some love entanglement with, a lady--really I\nforget her maiden name, but perhaps you can inform me of it----\"\n\n\"Do you happen to mean Miss Jane Beach?\" said Leonard quietly.\n\nAt this point Juanna turned in her chair and became extraordinarily,\nindeed almost fiercely, interested in the conversation.\n\n\"Quite so; Beach was the name. You must excuse my forgetfulness. Well,\nSir Thomas's affairs fell into confusion, and after their father's death\nMr. Leonard Outram, with his elder brother Thomas, emigrated to South\nAfrica. In that same year Miss Jane--eh--Beach married a client of ours,\nMr. Cohen, whose father had purchased the estate of Outram from the\ntrustees in bankruptcy.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Leonard.\n\n\"Shortly afterwards,\" went on the lawyer, \"Mr. Cohen, or rather Sir\nJonas Cohen, succeeded to the estate on the death of his father. Two\nyears ago he died leaving all his property, real and personal, to his\nonly child, a daughter named Jane, with reversion to his widow in fee\nsimple. Within a month of his death the child Jane died also, and nine\nmonths later her mother, Lady Cohen, _nee_ Jane Beach, followed her to\nthe grave.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Leonard in a dull voice, and hiding his face in his hand;\n\"go on, sir.\"\n\n\"Lady Cohen made a somewhat peculiar will. Under the terms of that will\nshe bequeaths the mansion house and estates of Outram, together with\nmost of her personal property, amounting in all to something over a\nhundred thousand pounds, to her old friend Leonard Outram and the heirs\nof his body, with reversion to her brother. This will has not been\ndisputed; therefore, if you are Leonard Outram, I may congratulate\nyou upon being once more the owner of your ancestral estate and a\nconsiderable fortune in cash.\"\n\nFor a while Leonard was too agitated to speak.\n\n\"I will prove to you,\" he said at last, \"that I am this person, that is,\nI will prove it _prima facie_; afterwards you can satisfy yourself of\nthe truth of my statements by the usual methods.\" And he proceeded to\nadduce a variety of evidence as to his identity which need not be set\nout here. The lawyer listened in silence, taking a note from time to\ntime.\n\n\"I think,\" he said when Leonard had finished, \"that, subject to those\ninquiries of which you yourself have pointed out the necessity in so\ngrave a matter, I may accept it as proved that you are none other than\nMr. Leonard Outram, or rather,\" he added, correcting himself, \"if, as I\nunderstand, your elder brother Thomas is dead, than Sir Leonard Outram.\nIndeed you have so entirely convinced me that this is the case, that I\nhave no hesitation in placing in your hands a letter addressed to you\nby the late Lady Cohen, and deposited with me together with the executed\nwill; though, when you have read it, I shall request you to leave that\nletter with me for the present.\n\n\"By the way, it may interest you to learn,\" Mr. Turner added, as he went\nto a safe built into the wall and unlocked its iron door, \"that we have\nbeen hunting for you for a year or more. We even sent a man to South\nAfrica, and he tracked you to a spot in some mountains somewhere north\nof Delagoa Bay, where it was reported that you, with your brother Thomas\nand two friends, were digging for gold. He reached the spot on the night\nof the ninth of May last year.\"\n\n\"The very day that I left it,\" broke in Leonard.\n\n\"And found the site of your camp and three graves. At first our\nrepresentative thought that you were all dead, but afterwards he fell\nin with a native who appears to have deserted from your service, and who\ntold him that one of the brothers was dying when he left the camp, but\none was still in good health, though he did not know where he had gone.\"\n\n\"My brother Thomas died on the first of May--this day year,\" said\nLeonard.\n\n\"After that all trace of you was lost, but I still kept on advertising,\nfor missing people have a wonderful way of turning up to claim fortunes,\nand you see the result. Here is the letter, Sir Leonard.\"\n\nLeonard took the document and looked at it, while strange feelings\ncrowded into his mind. This was the first letter that he had ever\nreceived from Jane Beach; also it was the last that he ever could\nreceive.\n\n\"Before I open this, Mr. Turner,\" he said, \"for my own satisfaction\nI may as well ask you to compare the handwriting of the address with\nanother specimen of it that chances to be in my possession\"; and\nproducing the worn prayer-book from his pocket--Jane's parting gift--he\nopened it at the fly-leaf, and pointed out the inscription to the\nlawyer, placing the envelope beside it.\n\nMr. Turner took a reading-glass and examined first one writing and then\nthe other.\n\n\"These words appear to have been written by the same hand,\" he said\npresently. \"Lady Cohen's writing was peculiar, and it is difficult to\nbe mistaken on the point, though I am no expert. To free you from\nresponsibility, with your consent I myself will open this letter,\" and\nhe slit the envelope at the top with an ivory paper-knife, and, drawing\nout its contents, he handed them to Leonard. They ran thus:\n\n\n\"My dearest Leonard,--For so I, who am no longer a wife, may call you\nwithout shame, seeing that you are in truth the dearest to my heart,\nwhether you be still living, or dead like my husband and my child.\n\n\"The will which I am to sign to-morrow will prove to you if you are yet\nalive, as I believe to be the case, how deep is my anxiety that that you\nshould re-enter into possession of the ancestral home of which fortune\nhas deprived you. It is with the greatest pleasure that I make you this\nbequest, and I can do so with a clear conscience, for my late husband\nhas left everything at my absolute disposal--being himself without near\nrelations--in the sad event which has occurred, of the death of his\ndaughter, our only child.\n\n\"May you live long enough to enjoy the lands and fortune which I am\nenabled thus to return to your family, and may your children and their\ndescendants sit at Outram for many a generation to come!\n\n\"And now I will talk no more of this matter, for I have an explanation\nto make and a pardon to ask.\n\n\"It may well be, Leonard, that when your eyes fall upon these lines, you\nwill have forgotten me--most deservedly--and have found some other woman\nto love you. No, as I set this down I feel that it is not true; you will\nnever forget me altogether, Leonard--your first love--and no other woman\nwill ever be quite the same to you as I have been; or, at least, so I\nbelieve in my foolishness and vanity.\n\n\"You will ask what explanation is possible after the way in which I have\ntreated you, and the outrage that I have done to my own love. Such as it\nis, however, I offer it to you.\n\n\"I was driven into this marriage, Leonard, by my late father, who could\nbe very cruel when he chose. To admit this is, as I know, a proof of\nweakness. So be it, I have never concealed from myself that I am weak.\nYet, believe me, I struggled while I could; I wrote to you even, but\nthey intercepted my letter; and I told all the truth to Mr. Cohen,\nbut he was self-willed and passionate, and would take no heed of my\npleading. So I married him, Leonard, and was fairly happy with him, for\nhe was kindness itself to me, but from that hour I began to die.\n\n\"And now more than six years have passed since the night of our parting\nin the snow, and the end is at hand, for I am really dying. It has\npleased God to take my little daughter, and this last shock proved more\nthan I can bear, and so I go to join her and to wait with her till such\ntime as I shall once more see your unforgotten face.\n\n\"That is all that I have to say, dear Leonard.\n\n\"Pardon me, and I am selfish enough to add--do not forget me.\n\n\"JANE.\n\n\"P.S.--Why is it that an affection like ours, which has never borne\nfruit even, should in the end prove stronger than any other earthly tie?\nHeaven knows, and Heaven alone, how passionately I loved and love my\ndead child; and yet, now that my own hour is at hand, it is of _you_\nthat I think the most, you who are neither child nor husband. I suppose\nthat I shall understand ere long, but, O Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, if,\nas I believe, my nature is immortal, I swear that such love as mine\nfor you, however much it be dishonoured and betrayed, is still the most\nimmortal part of it!--J.\"\n\n\nLeonard put down the letter on the table, and again he covered his face\nwith his hand to hide his emotion, for his feelings overcame him as a\nsense of the depth and purity of this dead woman's undying love sank\ninto his heart.\n\n\"May I read that letter, Leonard?\" asked Juanna in a quiet voice.\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so, dear, if you like,\" he answered, feeling dully that\nit was better to make a clean breast of the matter at once, and thus to\nprevent future misunderstandings.\n\nJuanna took the letter and perused it twice, by which time she knew it\nas well as she did the Lord's Prayer, nor did she ever forget a single\nword of it. Then she handed it back to the lawyer, saying nothing.\n\n\"I understand,\" said Mr. Turner, breaking in on a silence which he felt\nto be painful, \"that you will be able to produce the necessary proofs of\nidentity within the next few days, and then we can get the will proved\nin the usual form. Meanwhile, you must want money, which I will take the\nrisk of advancing you,\" and he wrote a cheque for a hundred pounds and\ngave it to Leonard.\n\nHalf an hour later Leonard and Juanna were alone in a room at their\nhotel, but as yet scarcely a word had passed between them since they\nleft the lawyer's office.\n\n\"Don't you see, Leonard,\" his wife said almost fiercely, \"it is most\namusing, you made a mistake. Your brother's dying prophecy was like a\nDelphic oracle--it could be taken two ways, and, of course, you adopted\nthe wrong interpretation. You left Grave Mountain a day too soon. It was\nby _Jane Beach's_ help that you were to recover Outram, not by mine,\"\nand she laughed sadly.\n\n\"Don't talk like that, dear,\" said Leonard in a sad voice; \"it pains\nme.\"\n\n\"How else am I to talk after reading that letter?\" she answered, \"for\nwhat woman can hold her own against a dead rival? Now also I must be\nindebted to her bounty all my days. Oh! if I had not lost the jewels--if\nonly I had not lost the jewels!\"\n\nHistory does not relate how Leonard dealt with this unexpected and yet\nnatural situation.\n\nA week had passed and Leonard, with Juanna at his side, found himself\nonce more in the great hall at Outram, where, on a bygone night, many\nyears ago, he and his dead brother had sworn their oath. All was the\nsame, for in this hall nothing had been changed--Jane had seen to that.\nThere chained to its stand was the Bible, upon which they had registered\ntheir vow; there were the pictures of his ancestors gazing down calmly\nupon him, as though they cared little for the story of his struggles and\nof his strange triumph over fortune \"by the help of a woman.\" There\nwas the painted window, with its blazoned coats of arms and its proud\nmottoes--\"_For Heart, Home, and Honour_,\" and \"_Per ardua ad astra_.\" He\nhad won the heart and home, and he had kept his honour and his oath. He\nhad endured the toils and dangers and the crown of stars was his.\n\nAnd yet, was Leonard altogether happy as he stood looking on these\nfamiliar things? Perhaps not quite, for yonder in the churchyard there\nwas a grave, and within the church a monument in white marble, that was\nwonderfully like one who had loved him and whom he had loved, though\ntime and trouble had written a strange difference on her face. Also, he\nhad failed: he had kept his oath indeed and fought on till the end was\nwon, but himself he had not won it. What now was his had once belonged\nto his successful rival, who doubtless little dreamed of the payment\nthat would be exacted from him by the decree of fate.\n\nAnd was Juanna happy? She knew well that Leonard loved her truly;\nbut oh! it was cruel that she who had shared the struggles should be\ndeprived of her reward--that it should be left to another, who if not\nfalse had at least been weak, to give to her husband that which she had\nstriven so hard to win--that which she had won--and lost. And harder\nstill was it that in this ancient place which would henceforth be her\nhome, by day and by night she must feel the presence of the shadow of a\nwoman, a woman sweet and pale, who, as she believed, stood between her\nand that which she desired above all things--the complete and absolute\npossession of her husband's heart.\n\nDoubtless she overrated the trouble; men and women do not spend their\nlives in brooding upon the memories of their first loves--if they did,\nthis would be a melancholy world. But to Juanna it was real enough,\nand remained so for some years. And if a thing is true to the heart, it\navails little that reason should give it the lie.\n\nIn short, now in the hour of their full property, Leonard and Juanna\nwere making acquaintance with the fact that fortune never gives with\nboth hands, as the French say, but loves to rob with one while she\nbestows with the other. To few is it allowed to be completely miserable,\nto none to be completely happy. Their good luck had been so overwhelming\nin many ways, that it would have partaken of the unnatural, and might\nwell have excited their fears for the future, had its completeness been\nunmarred by these drawbacks which, such as they were, probably they\nlearned to disremember as the years passed over them bringing them new\ntrials and added blessings.\n\nPerhaps a peep into the future will tell us the rest of the story\nof Leonard and Juanna Outram better and more truly than any further\nchronicling of events.\n\nTen years or so have gone by and Sir Leonard, now a member of Parliament\nand the Lord-Lieutenant of his county, comes out of church on the first\nSunday in May accompanied by his wife, the stateliest matron in the\ncountry-side, and some three or four children, boys and girls together,\nas healthy as they are handsome. After a glance at a certain grave that\nlies near to the chancel door, they walk homewards across the budding\npark in the sweet spring afternoon, till, a hundred yards or more from\nthe door of Outram Hall, they pause at the gates of a dwelling known as\n\"The Kraal,\" shaped like a beehive, fashioned of straw and sticks, and\nbuilt by the hands of Otter alone.\n\nBasking in the sunshine in front of this hut sits the dwarf himself,\ncutting broom-sticks with a knife out of the straightest of a bundle of\nash saplings that lie beside him. He is dressed in a queer mixture of\nnative and European costume, but otherwise time has wrought no change in\nhim.\n\n\"Greeting, Baas,\" he says as Leonard comes up. \"Is Baas Wallace here\nyet?\"\n\n\"No, he will be down in time for dinner. Mind that you are there to\nwait, Otter.\"\n\n\"I shall not be late, Baas, on this day of all days.\"\n\n\"Otter,\" cries a little maid, \"you should not make broom-sticks on\nSunday, it is very wrong.\"\n\nThe dwarf grins by way of answer, then speaks to Leonard in a tongue\nthat none but he can understand.\n\n\"What did I tell you many years ago, Baas?\" he says. \"Did I not tell\nyou that by this way or by that you should win the wealth, and that\nthe great kraal across the water should be yours again, and that the\nchildren of strangers should wander there no more? See, it has come\ntrue,\" and he points to the happy group of youngsters. \"_Wow!_ I, otter,\nwho am a fool in most things, have proved to be the best of prophets.\nYet I will rest content and prophesy no more, lest I should lose my name\nfor wisdom.\"\n\nA few hours later and dinner is over in the larger hall. All the\nservants have gone except Otter, who dressed in a white smock stands\nbehind his master's chair. There is no company present save Mr. Wallace,\nwho has just returned from another African expedition, and sits smiling\nand observant, his eyeglass fixed in his eye as of yore. Juanna is\narrayed in full evening dress, however, and a great star ruby blazes\nupon her breast.\n\n\"Why have you got the red stone on to-night, mother?\" asks her eldest\nson Thomas, who with his two sisters has come down to desert.\n\n\"Hush, dear,\" she answers, as Otter advances to that stand on which the\nBible is chained, holding a glass filled with port in his hand.\n\n\"Deliverer and Shepherdess,\" he says, speaking in Sisutu, \"on this day\neleven years gone Baas Tom died out yonder; I, who drink wine but once a\nyear, drink to the memory of Baas Tom, and to our happy meeting with him\nin the gold House of the Great-Great\"; and swallowing the port with\na single gulp Otter throws the glass behind him, shattering it on the\nfloor.\n\n\"Amen,\" says Leonard. \"Now, love, your toast.\"\n\n\"I drink to the memory of Francisco who died to save me,\" says Juanna in\na low voice.\n\n\"Amen,\" repeats her husband.\n\nFor a moment there is silence, for Leonard gives no toast; then the boy\nThomas lifts his glass and cries,\n\n\"And I drink to Olfan, the king of the People of the Mist, and to Otter,\nwho killed the Snake-god, and whom I love the best of all of them.\nMother, may Otter get the spear and the rope and tell us the story of\nhow he dragged you and father up the ice-bridge?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The People Of The Mist, by H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
