They were to\nbe met with every day, round every street corner, these harridans, more\nterrible far than were the men.\n\nThis one was still comparatively young, thirty at most; would have been\ngood-looking too, for the features were really delicate, the nose\nchiselled, the brow straight, the chin round and small. But the mouth!\nHeavens, what a mouth! Hard and cruel and thin-lipped; and those eyes!\nsunken and rimmed with purple; eyes that told tales of sorrow and, yes!\nof degradation. The crowd stood round her, sullen and apathetic; poor,\nmiserable wretches like herself, staring at her antics with lack-lustre\neyes and an ever-recurrent contemptuous shrug of the shoulders.\n\nThe woman was dancing, contorting her body in the small circle of light\nformed by a flickering lanthorn which was hung across the street from\nhouse to house, striking the muddy pavement with her shoeless feet, all\nto the sound of a be-ribboned tambourine which she struck now and again\nwith her small, grimy hand. From time to time she paused, held out the\ntambourine at arm's length, and went the round of the spectators, asking\nfor alms. But at her approach the crowd at once seemed to disintegrate,\nto melt into the humid evening air; it was but rarely that a greasy\ntoken fell into the outstretched tambourine. Then as the woman started\nagain to dance the crowd gradually reassembled, and stood, hands in\npockets, lips still sullen and contemptuous, but eyes watchful of the\nspectacle. There were such few spectacles these days, other than the\nmonotonous processions of tumbrils with their load of aristocrats for\nthe guillotine!\n\nSo the crowd watched, and the woman danced. The lanthorn overhead threw\na weird light on red caps and tricolour cockades, on the sullen faces of\nthe men and the shoulders of the women, on the dancer's weird antics and\nher flying, tattered skirts. She was obviously tired, as a poor,\nperforming cur might be, or a bear prodded along to uncongenial\nbuffoonery. Every time that she paused and solicited alms with her\ntambourine the crowd dispersed, and some of them laughed because she\ninsisted.\n\n\"Voyons,\" she said with a weird attempt at gaiety, \"a couple of sous for\nthe entertainment, citizen! You have stood here half an hour. You can't\nhave it all for nothing, what?\"\n\nThe man--young, square-shouldered, thick-lipped, with the look of a\nbully about his well-clad person--retorted with a coarse insult, which\nthe woman resented. There were high words; the crowd for the most part\nranged itself on the side of the bully. The woman backed against the\nwall nearest to her, held feeble, emaciated hands up to her ears in a\nvain endeavour to shut out the hideous jeers and ribald jokes which were\nthe natural weapons of this untamed crowd.\n\nSoon blows began to rain; not a few fell upon the unfortunate woman. She\nscreamed, and the more she screamed the louder did the crowd jeer, the\nuglier became its temper. Then suddenly it was all over. How it happened\nthe woman could not tell. She had closed her eyes, feeling sick and\ndizzy; but she had heard a loud call, words spoken in English (a\nlanguage which she understood), a pleasant laugh, and a brief but\nviolent scuffle. After that the hurrying retreat of many feet, the click\nof sabots on the uneven pavement and patter of shoeless feet, and then\nsilence.\n\nShe had fallen on her knees and was cowering against the wall, had lost\nconsciousness probably for a minute or two. Then she heard that pleasant\nlaugh again and the soft drawl of the English tongue.\n\n\"I love to see those beggars scuttling off, like so many rats to their\nburrows, don't you, Ffoulkes?\"\n\n\"They didn't put up much fight, the cowards!\" came from another voice,\nalso in English. \"A dozen of them against this wretched woman. What had\nbest be done with her?\"\n\n\"I'll see to her,\" rejoined the first speaker. \"You and Tony had best\nfind the others. Tell them I shall be round directly.\"\n\nIt all seemed like a dream. The woman dared not open her eyes lest\nreality--hideous and brutal--once more confronted her. Then all at once\nshe felt that her poor, weak body, encircled by strong arms, was lifted\noff the ground, and that she was being carried down the street, away\nfrom the light projected by the lanthorn overhead, into the sheltering\ndarkness of a yawning porte cochere. But she was not then fully\nconscious.\n\n\nII\n\nWhen she reopened her eyes she was in what appeared to be the lodge of a\nconcierge. She was lying on a horsehair sofa. There was a sense of\nwarmth and of security around her. No wonder that it still seemed like a\ndream. Before her stood a man, tall and straight, surely a being from\nanother world--or so he appeared to the poor wretch who, since\nuncountable time, had set eyes on none but the most miserable dregs of\nstruggling humanity, who had seen little else but rags, and faces either\ncruel or wretched. This man was clad in a huge caped coat, which made\nhis powerful figure seem preternaturally large. His hair was fair and\nslightly curly above his low, square brow; the eyes beneath their heavy\nlids looked down on her with unmistakable kindness.\n\nThe poor woman struggled to her feet. With a quick and pathetically\nhumble gesture she drew her ragged, muddy skirts over her ankles and her\ntattered kerchief across her breast.\n\n\"I had best go now, Monsieur ... citizen,\" she murmured, while a hot\nflush rose to the roots of her unkempt hair. \"I must not stop here....\nI--\"\n\n\"You are not going, Madame,\" he broke in, speaking now in perfect French\nand with a great air of authority, as one who is accustomed to being\nimplicitly obeyed, \"until you have told me how, a lady of culture and of\nrefinement, comes to be masquerading as a street-dancer. The game is a\ndangerous one, as you have experienced to-night.\"\n\n\"It is no game, Monsieur ... citizen,\" she stammered; \"nor yet a\nmasquerade. I have been a street-dancer all my life, and--\"\n\nBy way of an answer he took her hand, always with that air of authority\nwhich she never thought to resent.\n\n\"This is not a street-dancer's hand; Madame,\" he said quietly. \"Nor is\nyour speech that of the people.\"\n\nShe drew her hand away quickly, and the flush on her haggard face\ndeepened.\n\n\"If you will honour me with your confidence, Madame,\" he insisted.\n\nThe kindly words, the courtesy of the man, went to the poor creature's\nheart. She fell back upon the sofa and with her face buried in her arms\nshe sobbed out her heart for a minute or two. The man waited quite\npatiently. He had seen many women weep these days, and had dried many a\ntear through deeds of valour and of self-sacrifice, which were for ever\nrecorded in the hearts of those whom he had succoured.\n\nWhen this poor woman had succeeded in recovering some semblance of\nself-control, she turned her wan, tear-stained face to him and said\nsimply:\n\n\"My name is Madeleine Lannoy, Monsieur. My husband was killed during the\nemeutes at Versailles, whilst defending the persons of the Queen and of\nthe royal children against the fury of the mob. When I was a girl I had\nthe misfortune to attract the attentions of a young doctor named Jean\nPaul Marat. You have heard of him, Monsieur?\"\n\nThe other nodded.\n\n\"You know him, perhaps,\" she continued, \"for what he is: the most cruel\nand revengeful of men. A few years ago he threw up his lucrative\nappointment as Court physician to Monseigneur le Comte d'Artois, and\ngave up the profession of medicine for that of journalist and\npolitician. Politician! Heaven help him! He belongs to the most\nbloodthirsty section of revolutionary brigands. His creed is pillage,\nmurder, and revenge; and he chooses to declare that it is I who, by\nrejecting his love, drove him to these foul extremities. May God forgive\nhim that abominable lie! The evil we do, Monsieur, is within us; it does\nnot come from circumstance. I, in the meanwhile, was a happy wife. My\nhusband, M. de Lannoy, who was an officer in the army, idolised me. We\nhad one child, a boy--\"\n\nShe paused, with another catch in her throat. Then she resumed, with\ncalmness that, in view of the tale she told, sounded strangely weird:\n\n\"In June last year my child was stolen from me--stolen by Marat in\nhideous revenge for the supposed wrong which I had done him. The details\nof that execrable outrage are of no importance. I was decoyed from home\none day through the agency of a forged message purporting to come from a\nvery dear friend whom I knew to be in grave trouble at the time. Oh! the\nwhole thing was thoroughly well thought out, I can assure you!\" she\ncontinued, with a harsh laugh which ended in a heartrending sob. \"The\nforged message, the suborned servant, the threats of terrible reprisals\nif anyone in the village gave me the slightest warning or clue. When the\nwhole miserable business was accomplished, I was just like a trapped\nanimal inside a cage, held captive by immovable bars of obstinate\nsilence and cruel indifference. No one would help me. No one ostensibly\nknew anything; no one had seen anything, heard anything. The child was\ngone! My servants, the people in the village--some of whom I could have\nsworn were true and sympathetic--only shrugged their shoulders. 'Que\nvoulez-vous, Madame? Children of bourgeois as well as of aristos were\noften taken up by the State to be brought up as true patriots and no\nlonger pampered like so many lap-dogs.'\n\n\"Three days later I received a letter from that inhuman monster, Jean\nPaul Marat. He told me that he had taken my child away from me, not from\nany idea of revenge for my disdain in the past, but from a spirit of\npure patriotism. My boy, he said, should not be brought up with the same\nideas of bourgeois effeteness and love of luxury which had disgraced the\nnation for centuries. No! he should be reared amongst men who had\nrealised the true value of fraternity and equality and the ideal of\ncomplete liberty for the individual to lead his own life, unfettered by\nsenseless prejudices of education and refinement. Which means,\nMonsieur,\" the poor woman went on with passionate misery, \"that my child\nis to be reared up in the company of all that is most vile and most\ndegraded in the disease-haunted slums of indigent Paris; that, with the\nconnivance of that execrable fiend Marat, my only son will, mayhap, come\nback to me one day a potential thief, a criminal probably, a\ndrink-sodden reprobate at best. Such things are done every day in this\nglorious Revolution of ours--done in the sacred name of France and of\nLiberty. And the moral murder of my child is to be my punishment for\ndaring to turn a deaf ear to the indign passion of a brute!\"\n\nOnce more she paused, and when the melancholy echo of her broken voice\nhad died away in the narrow room, not another murmur broke the stillness\nof this far-away corner of the great city.\n\nThe man did not move. He stood looking down upon the poor woman before\nhim, a world of pity expressed in his deep-set eyes. Through the\nabsolute silence around there came the sound as of a gentle flutter, the\ncurrent of cold air, mayhap, sighing through the ill-fitting shutters,\nor the soft, weird soughing made by unseen things. The man's heart was\nfull of pity, and it seemed as if the Angel of Compassion had come at\nhis bidding and enfolded the sorrowing woman with his wings.\n\nA moment or two later she was able to finish her pathetic narrative.\n\n\"Do you marvel, Monsieur,\" she said, \"that I am still sane--still alive?\nBut I only live to find my child. I try and keep my reason in order to\nfight the devilish cunning of a brute on his own ground. Up to now all\nmy inquiries have been in vain. At first I squandered money, tried\njudicial means, set an army of sleuth-hounds on the track. I tried\nbribery, corruption. I went to the wretch himself and abased myself in\nthe dust before him. He only laughed at me and told me that his love for\nme had died long ago; he now was lavishing its treasures upon the\nfaithful friend and companion--that awful woman, Simonne Evrard--who had\nstood by him in the darkest hours of his misfortunes. Then it was that I\ndecided to adopt different tactics. Since my child was to be reared in\nthe midst of murderers and thieves, I, too, would haunt their abodes. I\nbecame a street-singer, dancer, what you will. I wear rags now and\nsolicit alms. I haunt the most disreputable cabarets in the lowest slums\nof Paris. I listen and I spy; I question every man, woman, and child who\nmight afford some clue, give me some indication. There is hardly a house\nin these parts that I have not visited and whence I have not been kicked\nout as an importunate beggar or worse. Gradually I am narrowing the\ncircle of my investigations. Presently I shall get a clue. I shall! I\nknow I shall! God cannot allow this monstrous thing to go on!\"\n\nAgain there was silence. The poor woman had completely broken down.\nShame, humiliation, passionate grief, had made of her a mere miserable\nwreckage of humanity.\n\nThe man waited awhile until she was composed, then he said simply:\n\n\"You have suffered terribly, Madame; but chiefly, I think, because you\nhave been alone in your grief. You have brooded over it until it has\nthreatened your reason. Now, if you will allow me to act as your friend,\nI will pledge you my word that I will find your son for you. Will you\ntrust me sufficiently to give up your present methods and place yourself\nentirely in my hands? There are more than a dozen gallant gentlemen, who\nare my friends, and who will help me in my search. But for this I must\nhave a free hand, and only help from you when I require it. I can find\nyou lodgings where you will be quite safe under the protection of my\nwife, who is as like an angel as any man or woman I have ever met on\nthis earth. When your son is once more in your arms, you will, I hope,\naccompany us to England, where so many of your friends have already\nfound a refuge. If this meets with your approval, Madame, you may\ncommand me, for with your permission I mean to be your most devoted\nservant.\"\n\nDante, in his wild imaginations of hell and of purgatory and fleeting\nglimpses of paradise, never put before us the picture of a soul that was\nlost and found heaven, after a cycle of despair. Nor could Madeleine\nLannoy ever explain her feelings at that moment, even to herself. To\nbegin with, she could not quite grasp the reality of this ray of hope,\nwhich came to her at the darkest hour of her misery. She stared at the\nman before her as she would on an ethereal vision; she fell on her knees\nand buried her face in her hands.\n\nWhat happened afterwards she hardly knew; she was in a state of\nsemi-consciousness. When she once more woke to reality, she was in\ncomfortable lodgings; she moved and talked and ate and lived like a\nhuman being. She was no longer a pariah, an outcast, a poor,\nhalf-demented creature, insentient save for an infinite capacity for\nsuffering. She suffered still, but she no longer despaired. There had\nbeen such marvellous power and confidence in that man's voice when he\nsaid: \"I pledge you my word.\" Madeleine Lannoy lived now in hope and a\nsweet sense of perfect mental and bodily security. Around her there was\nan influence, too, a presence which she did not often see, but always\nfelt to be there: a woman, tall and graceful and sympathetic, who was\nalways ready to cheer, to comfort, and to help. Her name was Marguerite.\nMadame Lannoy never knew her by any other. The man had spoken of her as\nbeing as like an angel as could be met on this earth, and poor Madeleine\nLannoy fully agreed with him.\n\n\nIII\n\nEven that bloodthirsty tiger, Jean Paul Marat, has had his apologists.\nHis friends have called him a martyr, a selfless and incorruptible\nexponent of social and political ideals. We may take it that Simonne\nEvrard loved him, for a more impassioned obituary speech was, mayhap,\nnever spoken than the one which she delivered before the National\nAssembly in honour of that sinister demagogue, whose writings and\nactivities will for ever sully some of the really fine pages of that\nrevolutionary era.\n\nBut with those apologists we have naught to do. History has talked its\nfill of the inhuman monster. With the more intimate biographists alone\nhas this true chronicle any concern. It is one of these who tells us\nthat on or about the eighteenth day of Messidor, in the year I of the\nRepublic (a date which corresponds with the sixth of July, 1793, of our\nown calendar), Jean Paul Marat took an additional man into his service,\nat the instance of Jeannette Marechal, his cook and maid-of-all-work.\nMarat was at this time a martyr to an unpleasant form of skin disease,\nbrought on by the terrible privations which he had endured during the\nfew years preceding his association with Simonne Evrard, the faithful\nfriend and housekeeper, whose small fortune subsequently provided him\nwith some degree of comfort.\n\nThe man whom Jeannette Marechal, the cook, introduced into the household\nof No. 30, Rue des Cordeliers, that worthy woman had literally picked\none day out of the gutter where he was grabbing for scraps of food like\nsome wretched starving cur. He appeared to be known to the police of the\nsection, his identity book proclaiming him to be one Paul Mole, who had\nserved his time in gaol for larceny. He professed himself willing to do\nany work required of him, for the merest pittance and some kind of roof\nover his head. Simonne Evrard allowed Jeannette to take him in, partly\nout of compassion and partly with a view to easing the woman's own\nburden, the only other domestic in the house--a man named Bas--being\nmore interested in politics and the meetings of the Club des Jacobins\nthan he was in his master's ailments. The man Mole, moreover, appeared\nto know something of medicine and of herbs and how to prepare the warm\nbaths which alone eased the unfortunate Marat from pain. He was\npowerfully built, too, and though he muttered and grumbled a great deal,\nand indulged in prolonged fits of sulkiness, when he would not open his\nmouth to anyone, he was, on the whole, helpful and good-tempered.\n\nThere must also have been something about his whole wretched personality\nwhich made a strong appeal to the \"Friend of the People,\" for it is\nquite evident that within a few days Paul Mole had won no small measure\nof his master's confidence.\n\nMarat, sick, fretful, and worried, had taken an unreasoning dislike to\nhis servant Bas. He was thankful to have a stranger about him, a man who\nwas as miserable as he himself had been a very little while ago; who,\nlike himself, had lived in cellars and in underground burrows, and lived\non the scraps of food which even street-curs had disdained.\n\nOn the seventh day following Mole's entry into the household, and while\nthe latter was preparing his employer's bath, Marat said abruptly to\nhim:\n\n\"You'll go as far as the Chemin de Pantin to-day for me, citizen. You\nknow your way?\"\n\n\"I can find it, what?\" muttered Mole, who appeared to be in one of his\nsurly moods.\n\n\"You will have to go very circumspectly,\" Marat went on, in his cracked\nand feeble voice. \"And see to it that no one spies upon your movements.\nI have many enemies, citizen ... one especially ... a woman.... She is\nalways prying and spying on me.... So beware of any woman you see\nlurking about at your heels.\"\n\nMole gave a half-audible grunt in reply.\n\n\"You had best go after dark,\" the other rejoined after awhile. \"Come\nback to me after nine o'clock. It is not far to the Chemin de\nPantin--just where it intersects the Route de Meaux. You can get there\nand back before midnight. The people will admit you. I will give you a\nring--the only thing I possess.... It has little or no value,\" he added\nwith a harsh, grating laugh. \"It will not be worth your while to steal\nit. You will have to see a brat and report to me on his condition--his\nappearance, what?... Talk to him a bit.... See what he says and let me\nknow. It is not difficult.\"\n\n\"No, citizen.\"\n\nMole helped the suffering wretch into his bath. Not a movement, not a\nquiver of the eyelid betrayed one single emotion which he may have\nfelt--neither loathing nor sympathy, only placid indifference. He was\njust a half-starved menial, thankful to accomplish any task for the sake\nof satisfying a craving stomach. Marat stretched out his shrunken limbs\nin the herbal water with a sigh of well-being.\n\n\"And the ring, citizen?\" Mole suggested presently.\n\nThe demagogue held up his left hand--it was emaciated and disfigured by\ndisease. A cheap-looking metal ring, set with a false stone, glistened\nupon the fourth finger.\n\n\"Take it off,\" he said curtly.\n\nThe ring must have all along been too small for the bony hand of the\nonce famous Court physician. Even now it appeared embedded in the flabby\nskin and refused to slide over the knuckle.\n\n\"The water will loosen it,\" remarked Mole quietly.\n\nMarat dipped his hand back into the water, and the other stood beside\nhim, silent and stolid, his broad shoulders bent, his face naught but a\nmask, void and expressionless beneath its coating of grime.\n\nOne or two seconds went by. The air was heavy with steam and a medley of\nevil-smelling fumes, which hung in the close atmosphere of the narrow\nroom. The sick man appeared to be drowsy, his head rolled over to one\nside, his eyes closed. He had evidently forgotten all about the ring.\n\nA woman's voice, shrill and peremptory, broke the silence which had\nbecome oppressive:\n\n\"Here, citizen Mole, I want you! There's not a bit of wood chopped up\nfor my fire, and how am I to make the coffee without firing, I should\nlike to know?\"\n\n\"The ring, citizen,\" Mole urged gruffly.\n\nMarat had been roused by the woman's sharp voice. He cursed her for a\nnoisy harridan; then he said fretfully:\n\n\"It will do presently--when you are ready to start. I said nine o'clock\n... it is only four now. I am tired. Tell citizeness Evrard to bring me\nsome hot coffee in an hour's time.... You can go and fetch me the\nMoniteur now, and take back these proofs to citizen Dufour. You will\nfind him at the 'Cordeliers,' or else at the printing works.... Come\nback at nine o'clock.... I am tired now ... too tired to tell you where\nto find the house which is off the Chemin de Pantin. Presently will\ndo....\"\n\nEven while he spoke he appeared to drop into a fitful sleep. His two\nhands were hidden under the sheet which covered the bath. Mole watched\nhim in silence for a moment or two, then he turned on his heel and\nshuffled off through the ante-room into the kitchen beyond, where\npresently he sat down, squatting in an angle by the stove, and started\nwith his usual stolidness to chop wood for the citizeness' fire.\n\nWhen this task was done, and he had received a chunk of sour bread for\nhis reward from Jeannette Marechal, the cook, he shuffled out of the\nplace and into the street, to do his employer's errands.\n\n\nIV\n\nPaul Mole had been to the offices of the Moniteur and to the printing\nworks of L'Ami du Peuple. He had seen the citizen Dufour at the Club\nand, presumably, had spent the rest of his time wandering idly about the\nstreets of the quartier, for he did not return to the Rue des Cordeliers\nuntil nearly nine o'clock.\n\nAs soon as he came to the top of the street, he fell in with the crowd\nwhich had collected outside No. 30. With his habitual slouchy gait and\nthe steady pressure of his powerful elbows, he pushed his way to the\ndoor, whilst gleaning whisperings and rumours on his way.\n\n\"The citizen Marat has been assassinated.\"\n\n\"By a woman.\"\n\n\"A mere girl.\"\n\n\"A wench from Caen. Her name is Corday.\"\n\n\"The people nearly tore her to pieces awhile ago.\"\n\n\"She is as much as guillotined already.\"\n\nThe latter remark went off with a loud guffaw and many a ribald joke.\n\nMole, despite his great height, succeeded in getting through\nunperceived. He was of no account, and he knew his way inside the house.\nIt was full of people: journalists, gaffers, women and men--the usual\ncrowd that come to gape. The citizen Marat was a great personage. The\nFriend of the People. An Incorruptible, if ever there was one. Just look\nat the simplicity, almost the poverty, in which he lived! Only the\naristos hated him, and the fat bourgeois who battened on the people.\nCitizen Marat had sent hundreds of them to the guillotine with a stroke\nof his pen or a denunciation from his fearless tongue.\n\nMole did not pause to listen to these comments. He pushed his way\nthrough the throng up the stairs, to his late employer's lodgings on the\nfirst floor.\n\nThe anteroom was crowded, so were the other rooms; but the greatest\npressure was around the door immediately facing him, the one which gave\non the bathroom. In the kitchen on his right, where awhile ago he had\nbeen chopping wood under a flood of abuse from Jeannette Marechal, he\ncaught sight of this woman, cowering by the hearth, her filthy apron\nthrown over her head, and crying--yes! crying for the loathsome\ncreature, who had expiated some of his abominable crimes at the hands of\na poor, misguided girl, whom an infuriated mob was even now threatening\nto tear to pieces in its rage.\n\nThe parlour and even Simonne's room were also filled with people: men,\nmost of whom Mole knew by sight; friends or enemies of the ranting\ndemagogue who lay murdered in the very bath which his casual servant had\nprepared for him. Every one was discussing the details of the murder,\nthe punishment of the youthful assassin. Simonne Evrard was being loudly\nblamed for having admitted the girl into citizen Marat's room. But the\nwench had looked so simple, so innocent, and she said she was the bearer\nof a message from Caen. She had called twice during the day, and in the\nevening the citizen himself said that he would see her. Simonne had been\nfor sending her away. But the citizen was peremptory. And he was so\nhelpless ... in his bath ... name of a name, the pitiable affair!\n\nNo one paid much attention to Mole. He listened for a while to Simonne's\nimpassioned voice, giving her version of the affair; then he worked his\nway stolidly into the bathroom.\n\nIt was some time before he succeeded in reaching the side of that awful\nbath wherein lay the dead body of Jean Paul Marat. The small room was\ndensely packed--not with friends, for there was not a man or woman\nliving, except Simonne Evrard and her sisters, whom the bloodthirsty\ndemagogue would have called \"friend\"; but his powerful personality had\nbeen a menace to many, and now they came in crowds to see that he was\nreally dead, that a girl's feeble hand had actually done the deed which\nthey themselves had only contemplated. They stood about whispering,\ntheir heads averted from the ghastly spectacle of this miserable\ncreature, to whom even death had failed to lend his usual attribute of\ntranquil dignity.\n\nThe tiny room was inexpressibly hot and stuffy. Hardly a breath of\noutside air came in through the narrow window, which only gave on the\nbedroom beyond. An evil-smelling oil-lamp swung from the low ceiling and\nshed its feeble light on the upturned face of the murdered man.\n\nMole stood for a moment or two, silent and pensive, beside that hideous\nform. There was the bath, just as he had prepared it: the board spread\nover with a sheet and laid across the bath, above which only the head\nand shoulders emerged, livid and stained. One hand, the left, grasped\nthe edge of the board with the last convulsive clutch of supreme agony.\n\nOn the fourth finger of that hand glistened the shoddy ring which Marat\nhad said was not worth stealing. Yet, apparently, it roused the cupidity\nof the poor wretch who had served him faithfully for these last few\ndays, and who now would once more be thrown, starving and friendless,\nupon the streets of Paris.\n\nMole threw a quick, furtive glance around him. The crowd which had come\nto gloat over the murdered Terrorist stood about whispering, with heads\naverted, engrossed in their own affairs. He slid his hand\nsurreptitiously over that of the dead man. With dexterous manipulation\nhe lifted the finger round which glistened the metal ring. Death\nappeared to have shrivelled the flesh still more upon the bones, to have\ncontracted the knuckles and shrunk the tendons. The ring slid off quite\neasily. Mole had it in his hand, when suddenly a rough blow struck him\non the shoulder.\n\n\"Trying to rob the dead?\" a stern voice shouted in his ear. \"Are you a\ndisguised aristo, or what?\"\n\nAt once the whispering ceased. A wave of excitement went round the room.\nSome people shouted, others pressed forward to gaze on the abandoned\nwretch who had been caught in the act of committing a gruesome deed.\n\n\"Robbing the dead!\"\n\nThey were experts in evil, most of these men here. Their hands were\nindelibly stained with some of the foulest crimes ever recorded in\nhistory. But there was something ghoulish in this attempt to plunder\nthat awful thing lying there, helpless, in the water. There was also a\ngreat relief to nerve-tension in shouting Horror and Anathema with\nself-righteous indignation; and additional excitement in the suggested\n\"aristo in disguise.\"\n\nMole struggled vigorously. He was powerful and his fists were heavy. But\nhe was soon surrounded, held fast by both arms, whilst half a dozen\nhands tore at his tattered clothes, searched him to his very skin, for\nthe booty which he was thought to have taken from the dead.\n\n\"Leave me alone, curse you!\" he shouted, louder than his aggressors. \"My\nname is Paul Mole, I tell you. Ask the citizeness Evrard. I waited on\ncitizen Marat. I prepared his bath. I was the only friend who did not\nturn away from him in his sickness and his poverty. Leave me alone, I\nsay! Why,\" he added, with a hoarse laugh, \"Jean Paul in his bath was as\nnaked as on the day he was born!\"\n\n\"'Tis true,\" said one of those who had been most active in rummaging\nthrough Mole's grimy rags. \"There's nothing to be found on him.\"\n\nBut suspicion once aroused was not easily allayed. Mole's protestations\nbecame more and more vigorous and emphatic. His papers were all in\norder, he vowed. He had them on him: his own identity papers, clear for\nanyone to see. Someone had dragged them out of his pocket; they were\ndank and covered with splashes of mud--hardly legible. They were handed\nover to a man who stood in the immediate circle of light projected by\nthe lamp. He seized them and examined them carefully. This man was short\nand slight, was dressed in well-made cloth clothes; his hair was held in\nat the nape of the next in a modish manner with a black taffeta bow. His\nhands were clean, slender, and claw-like, and he wore the tricolour\nscarf of office round his waist which proclaimed him to be a member of\none of the numerous Committees which tyrannised over the people.\n\nThe papers appeared to be in order, and proclaimed the bearer to be Paul\nMole, a native of Besancon, a carpenter by trade. The identity book had\nrecently been signed by Jean Paul Marat, the man's latest employer, and\nbeen counter-signed by the Commissary of the section.\n\nThe man in the tricolour scarf turned with some acerbity on the crowd\nwho was still pressing round the prisoner.\n\n\"Which of you here,\" he queried roughly, \"levelled an unjust accusation\nagainst an honest citizen?\"\n\nBut, as usual in such cases, no one replied directly to the charge. It\nwas not safe these days to come into conflict with men like Mole. The\nCommittees were all on their side, against the bourgeois as well as\nagainst the aristos. This was the reign of the proletariat, and the\nsans-culotte always emerged triumphant in a conflict against the\nwell-to-do. Nor was it good to rouse the ire of citizen Chauvelin, one\nof the most powerful, as he was the most pitiless members of the\nCommittee of Public Safety. Quiet, sarcastic rather than aggressive,\nsomething of the aristo, too, in his clean linen and well-cut clothes,\nhe had not even yielded to the defunct Marat in cruelty and relentless\npersecution of aristocrats.\n\nEvidently his sympathies now were all with Mole, the out-at-elbows,\nmiserable servant of an equally miserable master. His pale-coloured,\ndeep-set eyes challenged the crowd, which gave way before him, slunk\nback into the corners, away from his coldly threatening glance. Thus he\nfound himself suddenly face to face with Mole, somewhat isolated from\nthe rest, and close to the tin bath with its grim contents. Chauvelin\nhad the papers in his hand.\n\n\"Take these, citizen,\" he said curtly to the other. \"They are all in\norder.\"\n\nHe looked up at Mole as he said this, for the latter, though his\nshoulders were bent, was unusually tall, and Mole took the papers from\nhim. Thus for the space of a few seconds the two men looked into one\nanother's face, eyes to eyes--and suddenly Chauvelin felt an icy sweat\ncoursing down his spine. The eyes into which he gazed had a strange,\nironical twinkle in them, a kind of good-humoured arrogance, whilst\nthrough the firm, clear-cut lips, half hidden by a dirty and ill-kempt\nbeard, there came the sound--oh! a mere echo--of a quaint and inane\nlaugh.\n\nThe whole thing--it seemed like a vision--was over in a second.\nChauvelin, sick and faint with the sudden rush of blood to his head,\nclosed his eyes for one brief instant. The next, the crowd had closed\nround him; anxious inquiries reached his re-awakened senses.\n\nBut he uttered one quick, hoarse cry:\n\n\"Hebert! A moi! Are you there?\"\n\n\"Present, citizen!\" came in immediate response. And a tall figure in the\ntattered uniform affected by the revolutionary guard stepped briskly out\nof the crowd. Chauvelin's claw-like hand was shaking visibly.\n\n\"The man Mole,\" he called in a voice husky with excitement. \"Seize him\nat once! And, name of a dog! do not allow a living soul in or out of the\nhouse!\"\n\nHebert turned on his heel. The next moment his harsh voice was heard\nabove the din and the general hubbub around:\n\n\"Quite safe, citizen!\" he called to his chief. \"We have the rogue right\nenough!\"\n\nThere was much shouting and much cursing, a great deal of bustle and\nconfusion, as the men of the Surete closed the doors of the defunct\ndemagogue's lodgings. Some two score men, a dozen or so women, were\nlocked in, inside the few rooms which reeked of dirt and of disease.\nThey jostled and pushed, screamed and protested. For two or three\nminutes the din was quite deafening. Simonne Evrard pushed her way up to\nthe forefront of the crowd.\n\n\"What is this I hear?\" she queried peremptorily. \"Who is accusing\ncitizen Mole? And of what, I should like to know? I am responsible for\neveryone inside these apartments ... and if citizen Marat were still\nalive--\"\n\nChauvelin appeared unaware of all the confusion and of the woman's\nprotestations. He pushed his way through the crowd to the corner of the\nanteroom where Mole stood, crouching and hunched up, his grimy hands\nidly fingering the papers which Chauvelin had returned to him a moment\nago. Otherwise he did not move.\n\nHe stood, silent and sullen; and when Chauvelin, who had succeeded in\nmastering his emotion, gave the peremptory command: \"Take this man to\nthe depot at once. And do not allow him one instant out of your sight!\"\nhe made no attempt at escape.\n\nHe allowed Hebert and the men to seize him, to lead him away. He\nfollowed without a word, without a struggle. His massive figure was\nhunched up like that of an old man; his hands, which still clung to his\nidentity papers, trembled slightly like those of a man who is very\nfrightened and very helpless. The men of the Surete handled him very\nroughly, but he made no protest. The woman Evrard did all the\nprotesting, vowing that the people would not long tolerate such tyranny.\nShe even forced her way up to Hebert. With a gesture of fury she tried\nto strike him in the face, and continued, with a loud voice, her insults\nand objurgations, until, with a movement of his bayonet, he pushed her\nroughly out of the way.\n\nAfter that Paul Mole, surrounded by the guard, was led without ceremony\nout of the house. Chauvelin gazed after him as if he had been brought\nface to face with a ghoul.\n\n\nV\n\nChauvelin hurried to the depot. After those few seconds wherein he had\nfelt dazed, incredulous, almost under a spell, he had quickly regained\nthe mastery of his nerves, and regained, too, that intense joy which\nanticipated triumph is wont to give.\n\nIn the out-at-elbows, half-starved servant of the murdered Terrorist,\ncitizen Chauvelin, of the Committee of Public Safety, had recognised his\narch enemy, that meddlesome and adventurous Englishman who chose to hide\nhis identity under the pseudonym of the Scarlet Pimpernel. He knew that\nhe could reckon on Hebert; his orders not to allow the prisoner one\nmoment out of sight would of a certainty be strictly obeyed.\n\nHebert, indeed, a few moments later, greeted his chief outside the doors\nof the depot with the welcome news that Paul Mole was safely under lock\nand key.\n\n\"You had no trouble with him?\" Chauvelin queried, with ill-concealed\neagerness.\n\n\"No, no! citizen, no trouble,\" was Hebert's quick reply. \"He seems to be\na well-known rogue in these parts,\" he continued with a complacent\nguffaw; \"and some of his friends tried to hustle us at the corner of the\nRue de Tourraine; no doubt with a view to getting the prisoner away. But\nwe were too strong for them, and Paul Mole is now sulking in his cell\nand still protesting that his arrest is an outrage against the liberty\nof the people.\"\n\nChauvelin made no further remark. He was obviously too excited to speak.\nPushing past Hebert and the men of the Surete who stood about the dark\nand narrow passages of the depot, he sought the Commissary of the\nSection in the latter's office.\n\nIt was now close upon ten o'clock. The citizen Commissary Cuisinier had\nfinished his work for the day and was preparing to go home and to bed.\nHe was a family man, had been a respectable bourgeois in his day, and\nthough he was a rank opportunist and had sacrificed not only his\npolitical convictions but also his conscience to the exigencies of the\ntime, he still nourished in his innermost heart a secret contempt for\nthe revolutionary brigands who ruled over France at this hour.\n\nTo any other man than citizen Chauvelin, the citizen Commissary would,\nno doubt, have given a curt refusal to a request to see a prisoner at\nthis late hour of the evening. But Chauvelin was not a man to be denied,\nand whilst muttering various objections in his ill-kempt beard,\nCuisinier, nevertheless, gave orders that the citizen was to be\nconducted at once to the cells.\n\nPaul Mole had in truth turned sulky. The turnkey vowed that the prisoner\nhad hardly stirred since first he had been locked up in the common cell.\nHe sat in a corner at the end of the bench, with his face turned to the\nwall, and paid no heed either to his fellow-prisoners or to the\nfacetious remarks of the warder.\n\nChauvelin went up to him, made some curt remark. Mole kept an obstinate\nshoulder turned towards him--a grimy shoulder, which showed naked\nthrough a wide rent in his blouse. This portion of the cell was\nwell-nigh in total darkness; the feeble shaft of light which came\nthrough the open door hardly penetrated to this remote angle of the\nsqualid burrow. The same sense of mystery and unreality overcame\nChauvelin again as he looked on the miserable creature in whom, an hour\nago, he had recognised the super-exquisite Sir Percy Blakeney. Now he\ncould only see a vague outline in the gloom: the stooping shoulders, the\nlong limbs, that naked piece of shoulder which caught a feeble reflex\nfrom the distant light. Nor did any amount of none too gentle prodding\non the part of the warder induce him to change his position.\n\n\"Leave him alone,\" said Chauvelin curly at last. \"I have seen all that I\nwished to see.\"\n\nThe cell was insufferably hot and stuffy. Chauvelin, finical and queasy,\nturned away with a shudder of disgust. There was nothing to be got now\nout of a prolonged interview with his captured foe. He had seen him:\nthat was sufficient. He had seen the super-exquisite Sir Percy Blakeney\nlocked up in a common cell with some of the most scrubby and abject\nrogues which the slums of indigent Paris could yield, having apparently\nfailed in some undertaking which had demanded for its fulfilment not\nonly tattered clothes and grimy hands, but menial service with a\nbeggarly and disease-ridden employer, whose very propinquity must have\nbeen positive torture to the fastidious dandy.\n\nOf a truth this was sufficient for the gratification of any revenge.\nChauvelin felt that he could now go contentedly to rest after an\nevening's work excellently done.\n\nHe gave order that Mole should be put in a separate cell, denied all\nintercourse with anyone outside or in the depot, and that he should be\nguarded on sight day and night. After that he went his way.\n\n\nVI\n\nThe following morning citizen Chauvelin, of the Committee of Public\nSafety, gave due notice to citizen Fouquier-Tinville, the Public\nProsecutor, that the dangerous English spy, known to the world as the\nScarlet Pimpernel, was now safely under lock and key, and that he must\nbe transferred to the Abbaye prison forthwith and to the guillotine as\nquickly as might be. No one was to take any risks this time; there must\nbe no question either of discrediting his famous League or of obtaining\nother more valuable information out of him. Such methods had proved\ndisastrous in the past.\n\nThere were no safe Englishmen these days, except the dead ones, and it\nwould not take citizen Fouquier-Tinville much thought or time to frame\nan indictment against the notorious Scarlet Pimpernel, which would do\naway with the necessity of a prolonged trial. The revolutionary\ngovernment was at war with England now, and short work could be made of\nall poisonous spies.\n\nBy order, therefore, of the Committee of Public Safety, the prisoner,\nPaul Mole, was taken out of the cells of the depot and conveyed in a\nclosed carriage to the Abbaye prison. Chauvelin had the pleasure of\nwatching this gratifying spectacle from the windows of the Commissariat.\nWhen he saw the closed carriage drive away, with Hebert and two men\ninside and two others on the box, he turned to citizen Commissary\nCuisinier with a sigh of intense satisfaction.\n\n\"There goes the most dangerous enemy our glorious revolution has had,\"\nhe said, with an accent of triumph which he did not attempt to disguise.\n\nCuisinier shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Possibly,\" he retorted curtly. \"He did not seem to me to be very\ndangerous and his papers were quite in order.\"\n\nTo this assertion Chauvelin made no reply. Indeed, how could he explain\nto this stolid official the subtle workings of an intriguing brain? Had\nhe himself not had many a proof of how little the forging of identity\npapers or of passports troubled the members of that accursed League? Had\nhe not seen the Scarlet Pimpernel, that exquisite Sir Percy Blakeney,\nunder disguises that were so grimy and so loathsome that they would have\nrepelled the most abject, suborned spy?\n\nIndeed, all that was wanted now was the assurance that Hebert--who\nhimself had a deadly and personal grudge against the Scarlet\nPimpernel--would not allow him for one moment out of his sight.\n\nFortunately as to this, there was no fear. One hint to Hebert and the\nman was as keen, as determined, as Chauvelin himself.\n\n\"Set your mind at rest, citizen,\" he said with a rough oath. \"I guessed\nhow matters stood the moment you gave me the order. I knew you would not\ntake all that trouble for a real Paul Mole. But have no fear! That\naccursed Englishman has not been one second out of my sight, from the\nmoment I arrested him in the late citizen Marat's lodgings, and by\nSatan! he shall not be either, until I have seen his impudent head fall\nunder the guillotine.\"\n\nHe himself, he added, had seen to the arrangements for the disposal of\nthe prisoner in the Abbaye: an inner cell, partially partitioned off in\none of the guard-rooms, with no egress of its own, and only a tiny\ngrated air-hole high up in the wall, which gave on an outside corridor,\nand through which not even a cat could manage to slip. Oh! the prisoner\nwas well guarded! The citizen Representative need, of a truth, have no\nfear! Three or four men--of the best and most trustworthy--had not left\nthe guard-room since the morning. He himself (Hebert) had kept the\naccursed Englishman in sight all night, had personally conveyed him to\nthe Abbaye, and had only left the guard-room a moment ago in order to\nspeak with the citizen Representative. He was going back now at once,\nand would not move until the order came for the prisoner to be conveyed\nto the Court of Justice and thence to summary execution.\n\nFor the nonce, Hebert concluded with a complacent chuckle, the\nEnglishman was still crouching dejectedly in a corner of his new cell,\nwith little of him visible save that naked shoulder through his torn\nshirt, which, in the process of transference from one prison to another,\nhad become a shade more grimy than before.\n\nChauvelin nodded, well satisfied. He commended Hebert for his zeal,\nrejoiced with him over the inevitable triumph. It would be well to\navenge that awful humiliation at Calais last September. Nevertheless, he\nfelt anxious and nervy; he could not comprehend the apathy assumed by\nthe factitious Mole. That the apathy was assumed Chauvelin was keen\nenough to guess. What it portended he could not conjecture. But that the\nEnglishman would make a desperate attempt at escape was, of course, a\nforegone conclusion. It rested with Hebert and a guard that could\nneither be bribed nor fooled into treachery, to see that such an attempt\nremained abortive.\n\nWhat, however, had puzzled citizen Chauvelin all along was the motive\nwhich had induced Sir Percy Blakeney to play the role of menial to Jean\nPaul Marat. Behind it there lay, undoubtedly, one of those subtle\nintrigues for which that insolent Scarlet Pimpernel was famous; and with\nit was associated an attempt at theft upon the murdered body of the\ndemagogue ... an attempt which had failed, seeing that the\nsupposititious Paul Mole had been searched and nothing suspicious been\nfound upon his person.\n\nNevertheless, thoughts of that attempted theft disturbed Chauvelin's\nequanimity. The old legend of the crumpled roseleaf was applicable in\nhis case. Something of his intense satisfaction would pale if this final\nenterprise of the audacious adventurer were to be brought to a\ntriumphant close in the end.\n\n\nVII\n\nThat same forenoon, on his return from the Abbaye and the depot,\nChauvelin found that a visitor was waiting for him. A woman, who gave\nher name as Jeannette Marechal, desired to speak with the citizen\nRepresentative. Chauvelin knew the woman as his colleague Marat's\nmaid-of-all-work, and he gave orders that she should be admitted at\nonce.\n\nJeannette Marechal, tearful and not a little frightened, assured the\ncitizen Representative that her errand was urgent. Her late employer had\nso few friends; she did not know to whom to turn until she bethought\nherself of citizen Chauvelin. It took him some little time to\ndisentangle the tangible facts out of the woman's voluble narrative. At\nfirst the words: \"Child ... Chemin de Pantin ... Leridan,\" were only a\nmedley of sounds which conveyed no meaning to his ear. But when occasion\ndemanded, citizen Chauvelin was capable of infinite patience. Gradually\nhe understood what the woman was driving at.\n\n\"The child, citizen!\" she reiterated excitedly. \"What's to be done about\nhim? I know that citizen Marat would have wished--\"\n\n\"Never mind now what citizen Marat would have wished,\" Chauvelin broke\nin quietly. \"Tell me first who this child is.\"\n\n\"I do not know, citizen,\" she replied.\n\n\"How do you mean, you do not know? Then I pray you, citizeness, what is\nall this pother about?\"\n\n\"About the child, citizen,\" reiterated Jeannette obstinately.\n\n\"What child?\"\n\n\"The child whom citizen Marat adopted last year and kept at that awful\nhouse on the Chemin de Pantin.\"\n\n\"I did not know citizen Marat had adopted a child,\" remarked Chauvelin\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"No one knew,\" she rejoined. \"Not even citizeness Evrard. I was the only\none who knew. I had to go and see the child once every month. It was a\nwretched, miserable brat,\" the woman went on, her shrivelled old breast\nvaguely stirred, mayhap, by some atrophied feeling of motherhood. \"More\nthan half-starved ... and the look in its eyes, citizen! It was enough\nto make you cry! I could see by his poor little emaciated body and his\nnice little hands and feet that he ought never to have been put in that\nawful house, where--\"\n\nShe paused, and that quick look of furtive terror, which was so often to\nbe met with in the eyes of the timid these days, crept into her wrinkled\nface.\n\n\"Well, citizeness,\" Chauvelin rejoined quietly, \"why don't you proceed?\nThat awful house, you were saying. Where and what is that awful house of\nwhich you speak?\"\n\n\"The place kept by citizen Leridan, just by Bassin de l'Ourcq,\" the\nwoman murmured. \"You know it, citizen.\"\n\nChauvelin nodded. He was beginning to understand.\n\n\"Well, now, tell me,\" he said, with that bland patience which had so oft\nserved him in good stead in his unavowable profession. \"Tell me. Last\nyear citizen Marat adopted--we'll say adopted--a child, whom he placed\nin the Leridans' house on the Pantin road. Is that correct?\"\n\n\"That is just how it is, citizen. And I--\"\n\n\"One moment,\" he broke in somewhat more sternly, as the woman's\ngarrulity was getting on his nerves. \"As you say, I know the Leridans'\nhouse. I have had cause to send children there myself. Children of\naristos or of fat bourgeois, whom it was our duty to turn into good\ncitizens. They are not pampered there, I imagine,\" he went on drily;\n\"and if citizen Marat sent his--er--adopted son there, it was not with a\nview to having him brought up as an aristo, what?\"\n\n\"The child was not to be brought up at all,\" the woman said gruffly. \"I\nhave often heard citizen Marat say that he hoped the brat would prove a\nthief when he grew up, and would take to alcoholism like a duck takes to\nwater.\"\n\n\"And you know nothing of the child's parents?\"\n\n\"Nothing, citizen. I had to go to Pantin once a month and have a look at\nhim and report to citizen Marat. But I always had the same tale to tell.\nThe child was looking more and more like a young reprobate every time I\nsaw him.\"\n\n\"Did citizen Marat pay the Leridans for keeping the child?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, citizen! The Leridans make a trade of the children by sending\nthem out to beg. But this one was not to be allowed out yet. Citizen\nMarat's orders were very stern, and he was wont to terrify the Leridans\nwith awful threats of the guillotine if they ever allowed the child out\nof their sight.\"\n\nChauvelin sat silent for a while. A ray of light had traversed the dark\nand tortuous ways of his subtle brain. While he mused the woman became\nimpatient. She continued to talk on with the volubility peculiar to her\nkind. He paid no heed to her, until one phrase struck his ear.\n\n\"So now,\" Jeannette Marechal was saying, \"I don't know what to do. The\nring has disappeared, and the Leridans are suspicious.\"\n\n\"The ring?\" queried Chauvelin curtly. \"What ring?\"\n\n\"As I was telling you, citizen,\" she replied querulously, \"when I went\nto see the child, the citizen Marat always gave me this ring to show to\nthe Leridans. Without I brought the ring they would not admit me inside\ntheir door. They were so terrified with all the citizen's threats of the\nguillotine.\"\n\n\"And now you say the ring has disappeared. Since when?\"\n\n\"Well, citizen,\" replied Jeannette blandly, \"since you took poor Paul\nMole into custody.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Chauvelin riposted. \"What had Paul Mole to do with\nthe child and the ring?\"\n\n\"Only this, citizen, that he was to have gone to Pantin last night\ninstead of me. And thankful I was not to have to go. Citizen Marat gave\nthe ring to Mole, I suppose. I know he intended to give it to him. He\nspoke to me about it just before that execrable woman came and murdered\nhim. Anyway, the ring has gone and Mole too. So I imagine that Mole has\nthe ring and--\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Chauvelin broke in roughly. \"You can go!\"\n\n\"But, citizen--\"\n\n\"You can go, I said,\" he reiterated sharply. \"The matter of the child\nand the Leridans and the ring no longer concerns you. You understand?\"\n\n\"Y--y--yes, citizen,\" murmured Jeannette, vaguely terrified.\n\nAnd of a truth the change in citizen Chauvelin's demeanour was enough to\nscare any timid creature. Not that he raved or ranted or screamed. Those\nwere not his ways. He still sat beside his desk as he had done before,\nand his slender hand, so like the talons of a vulture, was clenched upon\nthe arm of his chair. But there was such a look of inward fury and of\ntriumph in his pale, deep-set eyes, such lines of cruelty around his\nthin, closed lips, that Jeannette Marechal, even with the picture before\nher mind of Jean Paul Marat in his maddest moods, fled, with the\nunreasoning terror of her kind, before the sternly controlled, fierce\npassion of this man.\n\nChauvelin never noticed that she went. He sat for a long time, silent\nand immovable. Now he understood. Thank all the Powers of Hate and\nRevenge, no thought of disappointment was destined to embitter the\noverflowing cup of his triumph. He had not only brought his arch-enemy\nto his knees, but had foiled one of his audacious ventures. How clear\nthe whole thing was! The false Paul Mole, the newly acquired menial in\nthe household of Marat, had wormed himself into the confidence of his\nemployer in order to wrest from him the secret of the aristo's child.\nBravo! bravo! my gallant Scarlet Pimpernel! Chauvelin now could see it\nall. Tragedies such as that which had placed an aristo's child in the\npower of a cunning demon like Marat were not rare these days, and\nChauvelin had been fitted by nature and by temperament to understand and\nappreciate an execrable monster of the type of Jean Paul Marat.\n\nAnd Paul Mole, the grimy, degraded servant of the indigent demagogue,\nthe loathsome mask which hid the fastidious personality of Sir Percy\nBlakeney, had made a final and desperate effort to possess himself of\nthe ring which would deliver the child into his power. Now, having\nfailed in his machinations, he was safe under lock and key--guarded on\nsight. The next twenty-four hours would see him unmasked, awaiting his\ntrial and condemnation under the scathing indictment prepared by\nFouquier-Tinville, the unerring Public Prosecutor. The day after that,\nthe tumbril and the guillotine for that execrable English spy, and the\nboundless sense of satisfaction that his last intrigue had aborted in\nsuch a signal and miserable manner.\n\nOf a truth Chauvelin at this hour had every cause to be thankful, and it\nwas with a light heart that he set out to interview the Leridans.\n\n\nVIII\n\nThe Leridans, anxious, obsequious, terrified, were only too ready to\nobey the citizen Representative in all things.\n\nThey explained with much complacency that, even though they were\npersonally acquainted with Jeannette Marechal, when the citizeness\npresented herself this very morning without the ring they had refused\nher permission to see the brat.\n\nChauvelin, who in his own mind had already reconstructed the whole\ntragedy of the stolen child, was satisfied that Marat could not have\nchosen more efficient tools for the execution of his satanic revenge\nthan these two hideous products of revolutionary Paris.\n\nGrasping, cowardly, and avaricious, the Leridans would lend themselves\nto any abomination for a sufficiency of money; but no money on earth\nwould induce them to risk their own necks in the process. Marat had\nobviously held them by threats of the guillotine. They knew the power of\nthe \"Friend of the People,\" and feared him accordingly. Chauvelin's\nscarf of office, his curt, authoritative manner, had an equally\nawe-inspiring effect upon the two miserable creatures. They became\nabsolutely abject, cringing, maudlin in their protestations of good-will\nand loyalty. No one, they vowed, should as much as see the child--ring\nor no ring--save the citizen Representative himself. Chauvelin, however,\nhad no wish to see the child. He was satisfied that its name was\nLannoy--for the child had remembered it when first he had been brought\nto the Leridans. Since then he had apparently forgotten it, even though\nhe often cried after his \"Maman!\"\n\nChauvelin listened to all these explanations with some impatience. The\nchild was nothing to him, but the Scarlet Pimpernel had desired to\nrescue it from out of the clutches of the Leridans; had risked his\nall--and lost it--in order to effect that rescue! That in itself was a\nsufficient inducement for Chauvelin to interest himself in the execution\nof Marat's vengeance, whatever its original mainspring may have been.\n\nAt any rate, now he felt satisfied that the child was safe, and that the\nLeridans were impervious to threats or bribes which might land them on\nthe guillotine.\n\nAll that they would own to was to being afraid.\n\n\"Afraid of what?\" queried Chauvelin sharply.\n\nThat the brat may be kidnapped ... stolen. Oh! he could not be decoyed\n... they were too watchful for that! But apparently there were\nmysterious agencies at work....\n\n\"Mysterious agencies!\" Chauvelin laughed aloud at the suggestion. The\n\"mysterious agency\" was even now rotting in an obscure cell at the\nAbbaye. What other powers could be at work on behalf of the brat?\n\nWell, the Leridans had had a warning!\n\nWhat warning?\n\n\"A letter,\" the man said gruffly. \"But as neither my wife nor I can\nread--\"\n\n\"Why did you not speak of this before?\" broke in Chauvelin roughly. \"Let\nme see the letter.\"\n\nThe woman produced a soiled and dank scrap of paper from beneath her\napron. Of a truth she could not read its contents, for they were writ in\nEnglish in the form of a doggerel rhyme which caused Chauvelin to utter\na savage oath.\n\n\"When did this come?\" he asked. \"And how?\"\n\n\"This morning, citizen,\" the woman mumbled in reply. \"I found it outside\nthe door, with a stone on it to prevent the wind from blowing it away.\nWhat does it mean, citizen?\" she went on, her voice shaking with terror,\nfor of a truth the citizen Representative looked as if he had seen some\nweird and unearthly apparition.\n\nHe gave no reply for a moment or two, and the two catiffs had no\nconception of the tremendous effort at self-control which was hidden\nbehind the pale, rigid mask of the redoubtable man.\n\n\"It probably means nothing that you need fear,\" Chauvelin said quietly\nat last. \"But I will see the Commissary of the Section myself, and tell\nhim to send a dozen men of the Surete along to watch your house and be\nat your beck and call if need be. Then you will feel quite safe, I\nhope.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! quite safe, citizen!\" the woman replied with a sigh of genuine\nrelief. Then only did Chauvelin turn on his heel and go his way.\n\n\nIX\n\nBut that crumpled and soiled scrap of paper given to him by the woman\nLeridan still lay in his clenched hand as he strode back rapidly\ncitywards. It seemed to scorch his palm. Even before he had glanced at\nthe contents he knew what they were. That atrocious English doggerel,\nthe signature--a five-petalled flower traced in crimson! How well he\nknew them!\n\n\"We seek him here, we seek him there!\"\n\nThe most humiliating moments in Chauvelin's career were associated with\nthat silly rhyme, and now here it was, mocking him even when he knew\nthat his bitter enemy lay fettered and helpless, caught in a trap, out\nof which there was no escape possible; even though he knew for a\npositive certainty that the mocking voice which had spoken those rhymes\non that far-off day last September would soon be stilled for ever.\n\nNo doubt one of that army of abominable English spies had placed this\nwarning outside the Leridans' door. No doubt they had done that with a\nview to throwing dust in the eyes of the Public Prosecutor and causing a\nconfusion in his mind with regard to the identity of the prisoner at the\nAbbaye, all to the advantage of their chief.\n\nThe thought that such a confusion might exist, that Fouquier-Tinville\nmight be deluded into doubting the real personality of Paul Mole,\nbrought an icy sweat all down Chauvelin's spine. He hurried along the\ninterminably long Chemin de Pantin, only paused at the Barriere du\nCombat in order to interview the Commissary of the Section on the matter\nof sending men to watch over the Leridans' house. Then, when he felt\nsatisfied that this would be effectively and quickly done, an\nunconquerable feeling of restlessness prompted him to hurry round to the\nlodgings of the Public Prosecutor in the Rue Blanche--just to see him,\nto speak with him, to make quite sure.\n\nOh! he must be sure that no doubts, no pusillanimity on the part of any\nofficial would be allowed to stand in the way of the consummation of all\nhis most cherished dreams. Papers or no papers, testimony or no\ntestimony, the incarcerated Paul Mole was the Scarlet Pimpernel--of this\nChauvelin was as certain as that he was alive. His every sense had\ntestified to it when he stood in the narrow room of the Rue des\nCordeliers, face to face--eyes gazing into eyes--with his sworn enemy.\n\nUnluckily, however, he found the Public Prosecutor in a surly and\nobstinate mood, following on an interview which he had just had with\ncitizen Commissary Cuisinier on the matter of the prisoner Paul Mole.\n\n\"His papers are all in order, I tell you,\" he said impatiently, in\nanswer to Chauvelin's insistence. \"It is as much as my head is worth to\ndemand a summary execution.\"\n\n\"But I tell you that, those papers of his are forged,\" urged Chauvelin\nforcefully.\n\n\"They are not,\" retorted the other. \"The Commissary swears to his own\nsignature on the identity book. The concierge at the Abbaye swears that\nhe knows Mole, so do all the men of the Surete who have seen him. The\nCommissary has known him as an indigent, good-for-nothing lubbard who\nhas begged his way in the streets of Paris ever since he was released\nfrom gaol some months ago, after he had served a term for larceny. Even\nyour own man Hebert admits to feeling doubtful on the point. You have\nhad the nightmare, citizen,\" concluded Fouquier-Tinville with a harsh\nlaugh.\n\n\"But, name of a dog!\" broke in Chauvelin savagely. \"You are not\nproposing to let the man go?\"\n\n\"What else can I do?\" the other rejoined fretfully. \"We shall get into\nterrible trouble if we interfere with a man like Paul Mole. You know\nyourself how it is these days. We should have the whole of the rabble of\nParis clamouring for our blood. If, after we have guillotined him, he is\nproved to be a good patriot, it will be my turn next. No! I thank you!\"\n\n\"I tell you, man,\" retorted Chauvelin desperately, \"that the man is not\nPaul Mole--that he is the English spy whom we all know as the Scarlet\nPimpernel.\"\n\n\"EH BIEN!\" riposted Fouquier-Tinville. \"Bring me more tangible proof\nthat our prisoner is not Paul Mole and I'll deal with him quickly\nenough, never fear. But if by to-morrow morning you do not satisfy me on\nthe point ... I must let him go his way.\"\n\nA savage oath rose to Chauvelin's lips. He felt like a man who has been\nrunning, panting to reach a goal, who sees that goal within easy\ndistance of him, and is then suddenly captured, caught in invisible\nmeshes which hold him tightly, and against which he is powerless to\nstruggle. For the moment he hated Fouquier-Tinville with a deadly\nhatred, would have tortured and threatened him until he wrung a consent,\nan admission, out of him.\n\nName of a name! when that damnable English spy was actually in his\npower, the man was a pusillanimous fool to allow the rich prize to slip\nfrom his grasp! Chauvelin felt as if he were choking; his slender\nfingers worked nervily around his cravat; beads of perspiration trickled\nunheeded down his pallid forehead.\n\nThen suddenly he had an inspiration--nothing less! It almost seemed as\nif Satan, his friend, had whispered insinuating words into his ear. That\nscrap of paper! He had thrust it awhile ago into the breast pocket of\nhis coat. It was still there, and the Public Prosecutor wanted a\ntangible proof.... Then, why not....?\n\nSlowly, his thoughts still in the process of gradual coordination,\nChauvelin drew that soiled scrap of paper out of his pocket.\nFouquier-Tinville, surly and ill-humoured, had his back half-turned\ntowards him, was moodily picking at his teeth. Chauvelin had all the\nleisure which he required. He smoothed out the creases in the paper and\nspread it out carefully upon the desk close to the other man's elbow.\nFouquier-Tinville looked down on it, over his shoulder.\n\n\"What is that?\" he queried.\n\n\"As you see, citizen,\" was Chauvelin's bland reply. \"A message, such as\nyou yourself have oft received, methinks, from our mutual enemy, the\nScarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\nBut already the Public Prosecutor had seized upon the paper, and of a\ntruth Chauvelin had no longer cause to complain of his colleague's\nindifference. That doggerel rhyme, no less than the signature, had the\npower to rouse Fouquier-Tinville's ire, as it had that of disturbing\nChauvelin's well-studied calm.\n\n\"What is it?\" reiterated the Public Prosecutor, white now to the lips.\n\n\"I have told you, citizen,\" rejoined Chauvelin imperturbably. \"A message\nfrom that English spy. It is also the proof which you have demanded of\nme--the tangible proof that the prisoner, Paul Mole, is none other than\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\n\"But,\" ejaculated the other hoarsely, \"where did you get this?\"\n\n\"It was found in the cell which Paul Mole occupied in the depot of the\nRue de Tourraine, where he was first incarcerated. I picked it up there\nafter he was removed ... the ink was scarcely dry upon it.\"\n\nThe lie came quite glibly to Chauvelin's tongue. Was not every method\ngood, every device allowable, which would lead to so glorious an end?\n\n\"Why did you not tell me of this before?\" queried Fouquier-Tinville,\nwith a sudden gleam of suspicion in his deep-set eyes.\n\n\"You had not asked me for a tangible proof before,\" replied Chauvelin\nblandly. \"I myself was so firmly convinced of what I averred that I had\nwell-nigh forgotten the existence of this damning scrap of paper.\"\n\nDamning indeed! Fouquier-Tinville had seen such scraps of paper before.\nHe had learnt the doggerel rhyme by heart, even though the English\ntongue was quite unfamiliar to him. He loathed the English--the entire\nnation--with all that deadly hatred which a divergence of political aims\nwill arouse in times of acute crises. He hated the English government,\nPitt and Burke and even Fox, the happy-go-lucky apologist of the young\nRevolution. But, above all, he hated that League of English spies--as he\nwas pleased to call them--whose courage, resourcefulness, as well as\nreckless daring, had more than once baffled his own hideous schemes of\nmurder, of pillage, and of rape.\n\nThank Beelzebub and his horde of evil spirits, citizen Chauvelin had\nbeen clear-sighted enough to detect that elusive Pimpernel under the\ndisguise of Paul Mole.\n\n\"You have deserved well of your country,\" said Tinville with lusty\nfervour, and gave Chauvelin a vigorous slap on the shoulder. \"But for\nyou I should have allowed that abominable spy to slip through our\nfingers.\"\n\n\"I have succeeded in convincing you, citizen?\" Chauvelin retorted dryly.\n\n\"Absolutely!\" rejoined the other. \"You may now leave the matter to me.\nAnd 'twill be friend Mole who will be surprised to-morrow,\" he added\nwith a harsh guffaw, \"when he finds himself face to face with me, before\na Court of Justice.\"\n\nHe was all eagerness, of course. Such a triumph for him! The indictment\nof the notorious Scarlet Pimpernel on a charge of espionage would be the\ncrowning glory of his career! Let other men look to their laurels! Those\nwho brought that dangerous enemy of revolution to the guillotine would\nfor ever be proclaimed as the saviours of France.\n\n\"A short indictment,\" he said, when Chauvelin, after a lengthy\ndiscussion on various points, finally rose to take his leave, \"but a\nscathing one! I tell you, citizen Chauvelin, that to-morrow you will be\nthe first to congratulate me on an unprecedented triumph.\"\n\nHe had been arguing in favour of a sensational trial and no less\nsensational execution. Chauvelin, with his memory harking back on many\nmysterious abductions at the very foot of the guillotine, would have\nliked to see his elusive enemy quietly put to death amongst a batch of\ntraitors, who would help to mask his personality until after the\nguillotine had fallen, when the whole of Paris should ring with the\ntriumph of this final punishment of the hated spy.\n\nIn the end, the two friends agreed upon a compromise, and parted well\npleased with the turn of events which a kind Fate had ordered for their\nown special benefit.\n\nX\n\nThus satisfied, Chauvelin returned to the Abbaye. Hebert was safe and\ntrustworthy, but Hebert, too, had been assailed with the same doubts\nwhich had well-nigh wrecked Chauvelin's triumph, and with such doubts in\nhis mind he might slacken his vigilance.\n\nName of a name! every man in charge of that damnable Scarlet Pimpernel\nshould have three pairs of eyes wherewith to watch his movements. He\nshould have the alert brain of a Robespierre, the physical strength of a\nDanton, the relentlessness of a Marat. He should be a giant in sheer\nbrute force, a tiger in caution, an elephant in weight, and a mouse in\nstealthiness!\n\nName of a name! but 'twas only hate that could give such powers to any\nman!\n\nHebert, in the guard-room, owned to his doubts. His comrades, too,\nadmitted that after twenty-four hours spent on the watch, their minds\nwere in a whirl. The Citizen Commissary had been so sure--so was the\nchief concierge of the Abbaye even now; and the men of the Surete!...\nthey themselves had seen the real Mole more than once ... and this man\nin the cell.... Well, would the citizen Representative have a final good\nlook at him?\n\n\"You seem to forget Calais, citizen Hebert,\" Chauvelin said sharply,\n\"and the deadly humiliation you suffered then at the hands of this man\nwho is now your prisoner. Surely your eyes should have been, at least,\nas keen as mine own.\"\n\nAnxious, irritable, his nerves well-nigh on the rack, he nevertheless\ncrossed the guard-room with a firm step and entered the cell where the\nprisoner was still lying upon the palliasse, as he had been all along,\nand still presenting that naked piece of shoulder through the hole in\nhis shirt.\n\n\"He has been like this the best part of the day,\" Hebert said with a\nshrug of the shoulders. \"We put his bread and water right under his\nnose. He ate and he drank, and I suppose he slept. But except for a good\ndeal of swearing, he has not spoken to any of us.\"\n\nHe had followed his chief into the cell, and now stood beside the\npalliasse, holding a small dark lantern in his hand. At a sign from\nChauvelin he flashed the light upon the prisoner's averted head.\n\nMole cursed for awhile, and muttered something about \"good patriots\" and\nabout \"retribution.\" Then, worried by the light, he turned slowly round,\nand with fish-like, bleary eyes looked upon his visitor.\n\nThe words of stinging irony and triumphant sarcasm, all fully prepared,\nfroze on Chauvelin's lips. He gazed upon the prisoner, and a weird sense\nof something unfathomable and mysterious came over him as he gazed. He\nhimself could not have defined that feeling: the very next moment he was\nprepared to ridicule his own cowardice--yes, cowardice! because for a\nsecond or two he had felt positively afraid.\n\nAfraid of what, forsooth? The man who crouched here in the cell was his\narch-enemy, the Scarlet Pimpernel--the man whom he hated most bitterly\nin all the world, the man whose death he desired more than that of any\nother living creature. He had been apprehended by the very side of the\nmurdered man whose confidence he had all but gained. He himself\n(Chauvelin) had at that fateful moment looked into the factitious Mole's\neyes, had seen the mockery in them, the lazy insouciance which was the\nchief attribute of Sir Percy Blakeney. He had heard a faint echo of that\ninane laugh which grated upon his nerves. Hebert had then laid hands\nupon this very same man; agents of the Surete had barred every ingress\nand egress to the house, had conducted their prisoner straightway to the\ndepot and thence to the Abbaye, had since that moment guarded him on\nsight, by day and by night. Hebert and the other men as well as the\nchief warder, all swore to that!\n\nNo, no! There could be no doubt! There was no doubt! The days of magic\nwere over! A man could not assume a personality other than his own; he\ncould not fly out of that personality like a bird out of its cage. There\non the palliasse in the miserable cell were the same long limbs, the\nbroad shoulders, the grimy face with the three days' growth of stubbly\nbeard--the whole wretched personality of Paul Mole, in fact, which hid\nthe exquisite one of Sir Percy Blakeney, Bart. And yet!...\n\nA cold sweat ran down Chauvelin's spine as he gazed, mute and immovable,\ninto those fish-like, bleary eyes, which were not--no! they were not\nthose of the real Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nThe whole situation became dreamlike, almost absurd. Chauvelin was not\nthe man for such a mock-heroic, melodramatic situation. Commonsense,\nreason, his own cool powers of deliberation, would soon reassert\nthemselves. But for the moment he was dazed. He had worked too hard, no\ndoubt; had yielded too much to excitement, to triumph, and to hate. He\nturned to Hebert, who was standing stolidly by, gave him a few curt\norders in a clear and well-pitched voice. Then he walked out of the\ncell, without bestowing another look on the prisoner.\n\nMole had once more turned over on his palliasse and, apparently, had\ngone to sleep. Hebert, with a strange and puzzled laugh, followed his\nchief out of the cell.\n\nXI\n\nAt first Chauvelin had the wish to go back and see the Public\nProsecutor--to speak with him--to tell him--what? Yes, what? That he,\nChauvelin, had all of a sudden been assailed with the same doubts which\nalready had worried Hebert and the others?--that he had told a\ndeliberate lie when he stated that the incriminating doggerel rhyme had\nbeen found in Mole's cell? No, no! Such an admission would not only be\nfoolish, it would be dangerous now, whilst he himself was scarce\nprepared to trust to his own senses. After all, Fouquier-Tinville was in\nthe right frame of mind for the moment. Paul Mole, whoever he was, was\nsafely under lock and key.\n\nThe only danger lay in the direction of the house on the Chemin de\nPantin. At the thought Chauvelin felt giddy and faint. But he would\nallow himself no rest. Indeed, he could not have rested until something\napproaching certainty had once more taken possession of his soul. He\ncould not--would not--believe that he had been deceived. He was still\nprepared to stake his very life on the identity of the prisoner at the\nAbbaye. Tricks of light, the flash of the lantern, the perfection of the\ndisguise, had caused a momentary illusion--nothing more.\n\nNevertheless, that awful feeling of restlessness which had possessed him\nduring the last twenty-four hours once more drove him to activity. And\nalthough commonsense and reason both pulled one way, an eerie sense of\nsuperstition whispered in his ear the ominous words, \"If, after all!\"\n\nAt any rate, he would see the Leridans, and once more make sure of them;\nand, late as was the hour, he set out for the lonely house on the Pantin\nRoad.\n\nJust inside the Barriere du Combat was the Poste de Section, where\nCommissary Burban was under orders to provide a dozen men of the Surete,\nwho were to be on the watch round and about the house of the Leridans.\nChauvelin called in on the Commissary, who assured him that the men were\nat their post.\n\nThus satisfied, he crossed the Barriere and started at a brisk walk down\nthe long stretch of the Chemin de Pantin. The night was dark. The\nrolling clouds overhead hid the face of the moon and presaged the storm.\nOn the right, the irregular heights of the Buttes Chaumont loomed out\ndense and dark against the heavy sky, whilst to the left, on ahead, a\nfaintly glimmering, greyish streak of reflected light revealed the\nproximity of the canal.\n\nClose to the spot where the main Route de Meux intersects the Chemin de\nPantin, Chauvelin slackened his pace. The house of the Leridans now lay\nimmediately on his left; from it a small, feeble ray of light, finding\nits way no doubt through an ill-closed shutter, pierced the surrounding\ngloom. Chauvelin, without hesitation, turned up a narrow track which led\nup to the house across a field of stubble. The next moment a peremptory\nchallenge brought him to a halt.\n\n\"Who goes there?\"\n\n\"Public Safety,\" replied Chauvelin. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Of the Surete,\" was the counter reply. \"There are a dozen of us about\nhere.\"\n\n\"When did you arrive?\"\n\n\"Some two hours ago. We marched out directly after you left the orders\nat the Commissariat.\"\n\n\"You are prepared to remain on the watch all night?\"\n\n\"Those are our orders, citizen,\" replied the man.\n\n\"You had best close up round the house, then. And, name of a dog!\" he\nadded, with a threatening ring in his voice. \"Let there be no slackening\nof vigilance this night. No one to go in or out of that house, no one to\napproach it under any circumstances whatever. Is that understood?\"\n\n\"Those were our orders from the first, citizen,\" said the man simply.\n\n\"And all has been well up to now?\"\n\n\"We have seen no one, citizen.\"\n\nThe little party closed in around their chief and together they marched\nup to the house. Chauvelin, on tenterhooks, walked quicker than the\nothers. He was the first to reach the door. Unable to find the bell-pull\nin the dark, he knocked vigorously.\n\nThe house appeared silent and wrapped in sleep. No light showed from\nwithin save that one tiny speck through the cracks of an ill-fitting\nshutter, in a room immediately overhead.\n\nIn response to Chauvelin's repeated summons, there came anon the sound\nof someone moving in one of the upstairs rooms, and presently the light\noverhead disappeared, whilst a door above was heard to open and to close\nand shuffling footsteps to come slowly down the creaking stairs.\n\nA moment or two later the bolts and bars of the front door were\nunfastened, a key grated in the rusty lock, a chain rattled in its\nsocket, and then the door was opened slowly and cautiously.\n\nThe woman Leridan appeared in the doorway. She held a guttering tallow\ncandle high above her head. Its flickering light illumined Chauvelin's\nslender figure.\n\n\"Ah! the citizen Representative!\" the woman ejaculated, as soon as she\nrecognised him. \"We did not expect you again to-day, and at this late\nhour, too. I'll tell my man--\"\n\n\"Never mind your man,\" broke in Chauvelin impatiently, and pushed\nwithout ceremony past the woman inside the house. \"The child? Is it\nsafe?\"\n\nHe could scarcely control his excitement. There was a buzzing, as of an\nangry sea, in his ears. The next second, until the woman spoke, seemed\nlike a cycle of years.\n\n\"Quite safe, citizen,\" she said placidly. \"Everything is quite safe. We\nwere so thankful for those men of the Surete. We had been afraid before,\nas I told the citizen Representative, and my man and I could not rest\nfor anxiety. It was only after they came that we dared go to bed.\"\n\nA deep sigh of intense relief came from the depths of Chauvelin's heart.\nHe had not realised himself until this moment how desperately anxious he\nhad been. The woman's reassuring words appeared to lift a crushing\nweight from his mind. He turned to the man behind him.\n\n\"You did not tell me,\" he said, \"that some of you had been here\nalready.\"\n\n\"We have not been here before,\" the sergeant in charge of the little\nplatoon said in reply. \"I do not know what the woman means.\"\n\n\"Some of your men came about three hours ago,\" the woman retorted; \"less\nthan an hour after the citizen Representative was here. I remember that\nmy man and I marvelled how quickly they did come, but they said that\nthey had been on duty at the Barriere du Combat when the citizen\narrived, and that he had dispatched them off at once. They said they had\nrun all the way. But even so, we thought it was quick work--\"\n\nThe words were smothered in her throat in a cry of pain, for, with an\nalmost brutal gesture, Chauvelin had seized her by the shoulders.\n\n\"Where are those men?\" he queried hoarsely. \"Answer!\"\n\n\"In there, and in there,\" the woman stammered, well-nigh faint with\nterror as she pointed to two doors, one on each side of the passage.\n\"Three in each room. They are asleep now, I should say, as they seem so\nquiet. But they were an immense comfort to us, citizen ... we were so\nthankful to have them in the house....\"\n\nBut Chauvelin had snatched the candle from her hand. Holding it high\nabove his head, he strode to the door on the right of the passage. It\nwas ajar. He pushed it open with a vicious kick. The room beyond was in\ntotal darkness.\n\n\"Is anyone here?\" he queried sharply.\n\nNothing but silence answered him. For a moment he remained there on the\nthreshold, silent and immovable as a figure carved in stone. He had just\na sufficiency of presence of mind and of will power not to drop the\ncandle, to stand there motionless, with his back turned to the woman and\nto the men who had crowded in, in his wake. He would not let them see\nthe despair, the rage and grave superstitious fear, which distorted\nevery line of his pallid face.\n\nHe did not ask about the child. He would not trust himself to speak, for\nhe had realised already how completely he had been baffled. Those\nabominable English spies had watched their opportunity, had worked on\nthe credulity and the fears of the Leridans and, playing the game at\nwhich they and their audacious chief were such unconquerable experts,\nthey had made their way into the house under a clever ruse.\n\nThe men of the Surete, not quite understanding the situation, were\nquestioning the Leridans. The man, too, corroborated his wife's story.\nTheir anxiety had been worked upon at the moment that it was most acute.\nAfter the citizen Representative left them, earlier in the evening, they\nhad received another mysterious message which they had been unable to\nread, but which had greatly increased their alarm. Then, when the men of\nthe Surete came.... Ah! they had no cause to doubt that they were men of\nthe Surete!... their clothes, their speech, their appearance ... figure\nto yourself, even their uniforms! They spoke so nicely, so reassuringly.\nThe Leridans were so thankful to see them! Then they made themselves\nhappy in the two rooms below, and for additional safety the Lannoy child\nwas brought down from its attic and put to sleep in the one room with\nthe men of the Surete.\n\nAfter that the Leridans went to bed. Name of a dog! how were they to\nblame? Those men and the child had disappeared, but they (the Leridans)\nwould go to the guillotine swearing that they were not to blame.\n\nWhether Chauvelin heard all these jeremiads, he could not afterwards\nhave told you. But he did not need to be told how it had all been done.\nIt had all been so simple, so ingenious, so like the methods usually\nadopted by that astute Scarlet Pimpernel! He saw it all so clearly\nbefore him. Nobody was to blame really, save he himself--he, who alone\nknew and understood the adversary with whom he had to deal.\n\nBut these people here should not have the gratuitous spectacle of a man\nenduring the torments of disappointment and of baffled revenge. Whatever\nChauvelin was suffering now would for ever remain the secret of his own\nsoul. Anon, when the Leridans' rasping voices died away in one of the\nmore distant portions of the house and the men of the Surete were busy\naccepting refreshment and gratuity from the two terrified wretches, he\nhad put down the candle with a steady hand and then walked with a firm\nstep out of the house.\n\nSoon the slender figure was swallowed up in the gloom as he strode back\nrapidly towards the city.\n\nXII\n\nCitizen Fouquier-Tinville had returned home from the Palais at a very\nlate hour that same evening. His household in his simple lodgings in the\nPlace Dauphine was already abed: his wife and the twins were asleep. He\nhimself had sat down for a moment in the living-room, in dressing-gown\nand slippers, and with the late edition of the Moniteur in his hand, too\ntired to read.\n\nIt was half-past ten when there came a ring at the front door bell.\nFouquier-Tinville, half expecting citizen Chauvelin to pay him a final\nvisit, shuffled to the door and opened it.\n\nA visitor, tall, well-dressed, exceedingly polite and urbane, requested\na few minutes' conversation with citizen Fouquier-Tinville.\n\nBefore the Public Prosecutor had made up his mind whether to introduce\nsuch a late-comer into his rooms, the latter had pushed his way through\nthe door into the ante-chamber, and with a movement as swift as it was\nunexpected, had thrown a scarf round Fouquier-Tinville's neck and wound\nit round his mouth, so that the unfortunate man's call for help was\nsmothered in his throat.\n\nSo dexterously and so rapidly indeed had the miscreant acted, that his\nvictim had hardly realised the assault before he found himself securely\ngagged and bound to a chair in his own ante-room, whilst that dare-devil\nstood before him, perfectly at his ease, his hands buried in the\ncapacious pockets of his huge caped coat, and murmuring a few casual\nwords of apology.\n\n\"I entreat you to forgive, citizen,\" he was saying in an even and\npleasant voice, \"this necessary violence on my part towards you. But my\nerrand is urgent, and I could not allow your neighbours or your\nhousehold to disturb the few minutes' conversation which I am obliged to\nhave with you. My friend Paul Mole,\" he went on, after a slight pause,\n\"is in grave danger of his life owing to a hallucination on the part of\nour mutual friend citizen Chauvelin; and I feel confident that you\nyourself are too deeply enamoured of your own neck to risk it wilfully\nby sending an innocent and honest patriot to the guillotine.\"\n\nOnce more he paused and looked down upon his unwilling interlocutor,\nwho, with muscles straining against the cords that held him, and with\neyes nearly starting out of their sockets in an access of fear and of\nrage, was indeed presenting a pitiful spectacle.\n\n\"I dare say that by now, citizen,\" the brigand continued imperturbably,\n\"you will have guessed who I am. You and I have oft crossed invisible\nswords before; but this, methinks, is the first time that we have met\nface to face. I pray you, tell my dear friend M. Chauvelin that you have\nseen me. Also that there were two facts which he left entirely out of\nhis calculations, perfect though these were. The one fact was that there\nwere two Paul Moles--one real and one factitious. Tell him that, I pray\nyou. It was the factitious Paul Mole who stole the ring and who stood\nfor one moment gazing into clever citizen Chauvelin's eyes. But that\nsame factitious Paul Mole had disappeared in the crowd even before your\ncolleague had recovered his presence of mind. Tell him, I pray you, that\nthe elusive Pimpernel whom he knows so well never assumes a fanciful\ndisguise. He discovered the real Paul Mole first, studied him, learned\nhis personality, until his own became a perfect replica of the miserable\ncaitiff. It was the false Paul Mole who induced Jeannette Marechal to\nintroduce him originally into the household of citizen Marat. It was he\nwho gained the confidence of his employer; he, for a consideration,\nborrowed the identity papers of his real prototype. He again who for a\nfew francs induced the real Paul Mole to follow him into the house of\nthe murdered demagogue and to mingle there with the throng. He who\nthrust the identity papers back into the hands of their rightful owner\nwhilst he himself was swallowed up by the crowd. But it was the real\nPaul Mole who was finally arrested and who is now lingering in the\nAbbaye prison, whence you, citizen Fouquier-Tinville, must free him on\nthe instant, on pain of suffering yourself for the nightmares of your\nfriend.\"\n\n\"The second fact,\" he went on with the same good-humoured pleasantry,\n\"which our friend citizen Chauvelin had forgotten was that, though I\nhappen to have aroused his unconquerable ire, I am but one man amongst a\nleague of gallant English gentlemen. Their chief, I am proud to say; but\nwithout them, I should be powerless. Without one of them near me, by the\nside of the murdered Marat, I could not have rid myself of the ring in\ntime, before other rough hands searched me to my skin. Without them, I\ncould not have taken Madeleine Lannoy's child from out that terrible\nhell, to which a miscreant's lustful revenge had condemned the poor\ninnocent. But while citizen Chauvelin, racked with triumph as well as\nwith anxiety, was rushing from the Leridans' house to yours, and thence\nto the Abbaye prison, to gloat over his captive enemy, the League of the\nScarlet Pimpernel carefully laid and carried out its plans at leisure.\nDisguised as men of the Surete, we took advantage of the Leridans'\nterror to obtain access into the house. Frightened to death by our\nwarnings, as well as by citizen Chauvelin's threats, they not only\nadmitted us into their house, but actually placed Madeleine Lannoy's\nchild in our charge. Then they went contentedly to bed, and we, before\nthe real men of the Surete arrived upon the scene, were already safely\nout of the way. My gallant English friends are some way out of Paris by\nnow, escorting Madeleine Lannoy and her child into safety. They will\nreturn to Paris, citizen,\" continued the audacious adventurer, with a\nlaugh full of joy and of unconquerable vitality, \"and be my henchmen as\nbefore in many an adventure which will cause you and citizen Chauvelin\nto gnash your teeth with rage. But I myself will remain in Paris,\" he\nconcluded lightly. \"Yes, in Paris; under your very nose, and entirely at\nyour service!\"\n\nThe next second he was gone, and Fouquier-Tinville was left to marvel if\nthe whole apparition had not been a hideous dream. Only there was no\ndoubt that he was gagged and tied to a chair with cords: and here his\nwife found him, an hour later, when she woke from her first sleep,\nanxious because he had not yet come to bed.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nA QUESTION OF PASSPORTS\n\n\nBibot was very sure of himself. There never was, never had been, there\nnever would be again another such patriotic citizen of the Republic as\nwas citizen Bibot of the Town Guard.\n\nAnd because his patriotism was so well known among the members of the\nCommittee of Public Safety, and his uncompromising hatred of the\naristocrats so highly appreciated, citizen Bibot had been given the most\nimportant military post within the city of Paris.\n\nHe was in command of the Porte Montmartre, which goes to prove how\nhighly he was esteemed, for, believe me, more treachery had been going\non inside and out of the Porte Montmartre than in any other quarter of\nParis. The last commandant there, citizen Ferney, was guillotined for\nhaving allowed a whole batch of aristocrats--traitors to the Republic,\nall of them--to slip through the Porte Montmartre and to find safety\noutside the walls of Paris. Ferney pleaded in his defence that these\ntraitors had been spirited away from under his very nose by the devil's\nagency, for surely that meddlesome Englishman who spent his time in\nrescuing aristocrats--traitors, all of them--from the clutches of Madame\nla Guillotine must be either the devil himself, or at any rate one of\nhis most powerful agents.\n\n\"Nom de Dieu! just think of his name! The Scarlet Pimpernel they call\nhim! No one knows him by any other name! and he is preternaturally tall\nand strong and superhumanly cunning! And the power which he has of being\ntransmuted into various personalities--rendering himself quite\nunrecognisable to the eyes of the most sharp-seeing patriot of France,\nmust of a surety be a gift of Satan!\"\n\nBut the Committee of Public Safety refused to listen to Ferney's\nexplanations. The Scarlet Pimpernel was only an ordinary mortal--an\nexceedingly cunning and meddlesome personage it is true, and endowed\nwith a superfluity of wealth which enabled him to break the thin crust\nof patriotism that overlay the natural cupidity of many Captains of the\nTown Guard--but still an ordinary man for all that! and no true lover of\nthe Republic should allow either superstitious terror or greed to\ninterfere with the discharge of his duties which at the Porte Montmartre\nconsisted in detaining any and every person--aristocrat, foreigner, or\notherwise traitor to the Republic--who could not give a satisfactory\nreason for desiring to leave Paris. Having detained such persons, the\npatriot's next duty was to hand them over to the Committee of Public\nSafety, who would then decide whether Madame la Guillotine would have\nthe last word over them or not.\n\nAnd the guillotine did nearly always have the last word to say, unless\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel interfered.\n\nThe trouble was, that that same accursed Englishman interfered at times\nin a manner which was positively terrifying. His impudence, certes,\npassed all belief. Stories of his daring and of his impudence were\nabroad which literally made the lank and greasy hair of every patriot\ncurl with wonder. 'Twas even whispered--not too loudly, forsooth--that\ncertain members of the Committee of Public Safety had measured their\nskill and valour against that of the Englishman and emerged from the\nconflict beaten and humiliated, vowing vengeance which, of a truth, was\nstill slow in coming.\n\nCitizen Chauvelin, one of the most implacable and unyielding members of\nthe Committee, was known to have suffered overwhelming shame at the\nhands of that daring gang, of whom the so-called Scarlet Pimpernel was\nthe accredited chief. Some there were who said that citizen Chauvelin\nhad for ever forfeited his prestige, and even endangered his head by\nmeasuring his well-known astuteness against that mysterious League of\nspies.\n\nBut then Bibot was different!\n\nHe feared neither the devil, nor any Englishman. Had the latter the\nstrength of giants and the protection of every power of evil, Bibot was\nready for him. Nay! he was aching for a tussle, and haunted the purlieus\nof the Committees to obtain some post which would enable him to come to\ngrips with the Scarlet Pimpernel and his League.\n\nBibot's zeal and perseverance were duly rewarded, and anon he was\nappointed to the command of the guard at the Porte Montmartre.\n\nA post of vast importance as aforesaid; so much so, in fact, that no\nless a person than citizen Jean Paul Marat himself came to speak with\nBibot on that third day of Nivose in the year I of the Republic, with a\nview to impressing upon him the necessity of keeping his eyes open, and\nof suspecting every man, woman, and child indiscriminately until they\nhad proved themselves to be true patriots.\n\n\"Let no one slip through your fingers, citizen Bibot,\" Marat admonished\nwith grim earnestness. \"That accursed Englishman is cunning and\nresourceful, and his impudence surpasses that of the devil himself.\"\n\n\"He'd better try some of his impudence on me!\" commented Bibot with a\nsneer, \"he'll soon find out that he no longer has a Ferney to deal with.\nTake it from me, citizen Marat, that if a batch of aristocrats escape\nout of Paris within the next few days, under the guidance of the d--d\nEnglishman, they will have to find some other way than the Porte\nMontmartre.\"\n\n\"Well said, citizen!\" commented Marat. \"But be watchful to-night ...\nto-night especially. The Scarlet Pimpernel is rampant in Paris just\nnow.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"The ci-devant Duc and Duchesse de Montreux and the whole of their\nbrood--sisters, brothers, two or three children, a priest, and several\nservants--a round dozen in all, have been condemned to death. The\nguillotine for them to-morrow at daybreak! Would it could have been\nto-night,\" added Marat, whilst a demoniacal leer contorted his face\nwhich already exuded lust for blood from every pore. \"Would it could\nhave been to-night. But the guillotine has been busy; over four hundred\nexecutions to-day ... and the tumbrils are full--the seats bespoken in\nadvance--and still they come.... But to-morrow morning at daybreak\nMadame la Guillotine will have a word to say to the whole of the\nMontreux crowd!\"\n\n\"But they are in the Conciergerie prison surely, citizen! out of the\nreach of that accursed Englishman?\"\n\n\"They are on their way, an I mistake not, to the prison at this moment.\nI came straight on here after the condemnation, to which I listened with\ntrue joy. Ah, citizen Bibot! the blood of these hated aristocrats is\ngood to behold when it drips from the blade of the guillotine. Have a\ncare, citizen Bibot, do not let the Montreux crowd escape!\"\n\n\"Have no fear, citizen Marat! But surely there is no danger! They have\nbeen tried and condemned! They are, as you say, even now on their\nway--well guarded, I presume--to the Conciergerie prison!--to-morrow at\ndaybreak, the guillotine! What is there to fear?\"\n\n\"Well! well!\" said Marat, with a slight tone of hesitation, \"it is best,\ncitizen Bibot, to be over-careful these times.\"\n\nEven whilst Marat spoke his face, usually so cunning and so vengeful,\nhad suddenly lost its look of devilish cruelty which was almost\nsuperhuman in the excess of its infamy, and a greyish hue--suggestive of\nterror--had spread over the sunken cheeks. He clutched Bibot's arm, and\nleaning over the table he whispered in his ear:\n\n\"The Public Prosecutor had scarce finished his speech to-day, judgment\nwas being pronounced, the spectators were expectant and still, only the\nMontreux woman and some of the females and children were blubbering and\nmoaning, when suddenly, it seemed from nowhere, a small piece of paper\nfluttered from out the assembly and alighted on the desk in front of the\nPublic Prosecutor. He took the paper up and glanced at its contents. I\nsaw that his cheeks had paled, and that his hand trembled as he handed\nthe paper over to me.\"\n\n\"And what did that paper contain, citizen Marat?\" asked Bibot, also\nspeaking in a whisper, for an access of superstitious terror was\ngripping him by the throat.\n\n\"Just the well-known accursed device, citizen, the small scarlet flower,\ndrawn in red ink, and the few words: 'To-night the innocent men and\nwomen now condemned by this infamous tribunal will be beyond your\nreach!'\"\n\n\"And no sign of a messenger?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"And when did----\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Marat peremptorily, \"no more of that now. To your post,\ncitizen, and remember--all are suspect! let none escape!\"\n\nThe two men had been sitting outside a small tavern, opposite the Porte\nMontmartre, with a bottle of wine between them, their elbows resting on\nthe grimy top of a rough wooden table. They had talked in whispers, for\neven the walls of the tumble-down cabaret might have had ears.\n\nOpposite them the city wall--broken here by the great gate of\nMontmartre--loomed threateningly in the fast-gathering dusk of this\nwinter's afternoon. Men in ragged red shirts, their unkempt heads\ncrowned with Phrygian caps adorned with a tricolour cockade, lounged\nagainst the wall, or sat in groups on the top of piles of refuse that\nlittered the street, with a rough deal plank between them and a greasy\npack of cards in their grimy fingers. Guns and bayonets were propped\nagainst the wall. The gate itself had three means of egress; each of\nthese was guarded by two men with fixed bayonets at their shoulders, but\notherwise dressed like the others, in rags--with bare legs that looked\nblue and numb in the cold--the sans-culottes of revolutionary Paris.\n\nBibot rose from his seat, nodding to Marat, and joined his men.\n\nFrom afar, but gradually drawing nearer, came the sound of a ribald\nsong, with chorus accompaniment sung by throats obviously surfeited with\nliquor.\n\nFor a moment--as the sound approached--Bibot turned back once more to\nthe Friend of the People.\n\n\"Am I to understand, citizen,\" he said, \"that my orders are not to let\nanyone pass through these gates to-night?\"\n\n\"No, no, citizen,\" replied Marat, \"we dare not do that. There are a\nnumber of good patriots in the city still. We cannot interfere with\ntheir liberty or--\"\n\nAnd the look of fear of the demagogue--himself afraid of the human\nwhirlpool which he has let loose--stole into Marat's cruel, piercing\neyes.\n\n\"No, no,\" he reiterated more emphatically, \"we cannot disregard the\npassports issued by the Committee of Public Safety. But examine each\npassport carefully, citizen Bibot! If you have any reasonable ground for\nsuspicion, detain the holder, and if you have not----\"\n\nThe sound of singing was quite near now. With another wink and a final\nleer, Marat drew back under the shadow of the cabaret, and Bibot\nswaggered up to the main entrance of the gate.\n\n\"Qui va la?\" he thundered in stentorian tones as a group of some\nhalf-dozen people lurched towards him out of the gloom, still shouting\nhoarsely their ribald drinking song.\n\nThe foremost man in the group paused opposite citizen Bibot, and with\narms akimbo, and legs planted well apart tried to assume a rigidity of\nattitude which apparently was somewhat foreign to him at this moment.\n\n\"Good patriots, citizen,\" he said in a thick voice which he vainly tried\nto render steady.\n\n\"What do you want?\" queried Bibot.\n\n\"To be allowed to go on our way unmolested.\"\n\n\"What is your way?\"\n\n\"Through the Porte Montmartre to the village of Barency.\"\n\n\"What is your business there?\"\n\nThis query delivered in Bibot's most pompous manner seemed vastly to\namuse the rowdy crowd. He who was the spokesman turned to his friends\nand shouted hilariously:\n\n\"Hark at him, citizens! He asks me what is our business. Oh, citizen\nBibot, since when have you become blind? A dolt you've always been, else\nyou had not asked the question.\"\n\nBut Bibot, undeterred by the man's drunken insolence, retorted gruffly:\n\n\"Your business, I want to know.\"\n\n\"Bibot! my little Bibot!\" cooed the bibulous orator now in dulcet tones,\n\"dost not know us, my good Bibot? Yet we all know thee, citizen--Captain\nBibot of the Town Guard, eh, citizens! Three cheers for the citizen\ncaptain!\"\n\nWhen the noisy shouts and cheers from half a dozen hoarse throats had\ndied down, Bibot, without more ado, turned to his own men at the gate.\n\n\"Drive these drunken louts away!\" he commanded; \"no one is allowed to\nloiter here.\"\n\nLoud protest on the part of the hilarious crowd followed, then a slight\nscuffle with the bayonets of the Town Guard. Finally the spokesman,\nsomewhat sobered, once more appealed to Bibot.\n\n\"Citizen Bibot! you must be blind not to know me and my mates! And let\nme tell you that you are doing yourself a deal of harm by interfering\nwith the citizens of the Republic in the proper discharge of their\nduties, and by disregarding their rights of egress through this gate, a\nright confirmed by passports signed by two members of the Committee of\nPublic Safety.\"\n\nHe had spoken now fairly clearly and very pompously. Bibot, somewhat\nimpressed and remembering Marat's admonitions, said very civilly:\n\n\"Tell me your business then, citizen, and show me your passports. If\neverything is in order you may go your way.\"\n\n\"But you know me, citizen Bibot?\" queried the other.\n\n\"Yes, I know you--unofficially, citizen Durand.\"\n\n\"You know that I and the citizens here are the carriers for citizen\nLegrand, the market gardener of Barency?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that,\" said Bibot guardedly, \"unofficially.\"\n\n\"Then, unofficially, let me tell you, citizen, that unless we get to\nBarency this evening, Paris will have to do without cabbages and\npotatoes to-morrow. So now you know that you are acting at your own risk\nand peril, citizen, by detaining us.\"\n\n\"Your passports, all of you,\" commanded Bibot.\n\nHe had just caught sight of Marat still sitting outside the tavern\nopposite, and was glad enough, in this instance, to shelve his\nresponsibility on the shoulders of the popular \"Friend of the People.\"\nThere was general searching in ragged pockets for grimy papers with\nofficial seals thereon, and whilst Bibot ordered one of his men to take\nthe six passports across the road to citizen Marat for his inspection,\nhe himself, by the last rays of the setting winter sun, made close\nexamination of the six men who desired to pass through the Porte\nMontmartre.\n\nAs the spokesman had averred, he--Bibot--knew every one of these men.\nThey were the carriers to citizen Legrand, the Barency market gardener.\nBibot knew every face. They passed with a load of fruit and vegetables\nin and out of Paris every day. There was really and absolutely no cause\nfor suspicion, and when citizen Marat returned the six passports,\npronouncing them to be genuine, and recognising his own signature at the\nbottom of each, Bibot was at last satisfied, and the six bibulous\ncarriers were allowed to pass through the gate, which they did, arm in\narm, singing a wild curmagnole, and vociferously cheering as they\nemerged out into the open.\n\nBut Bibot passed an unsteady hand over his brow. It was cold, yet he was\nin a perspiration. That sort of thing tells on a man's nerves. He\nrejoined Marat, at the table outside the drinking booth, and ordered a\nfresh bottle of wine.\n\nThe sun had set now, and with the gathering dusk a damp mist descended\non Montmartre. From the wall opposite, where the men sat playing cards,\ncame occasional volleys of blasphemous oaths. Bibot was feeling much\nmore like himself. He had half forgotten the incident of the six\ncarriers, which had occurred nearly half an hour ago.\n\nTwo or three other people had, in the meanwhile, tried to pass through\nthe gates, but Bibot had been suspicious and had detained them all.\n\nMarat having commended him for his zeal took final leave of him. Just as\nthe demagogue's slouchy, grimy figure was disappearing down a side\nstreet there was the loud clatter of hoofs from that same direction, and\nthe next moment a detachment of the mounted Town Guard, headed by an\nofficer in uniform, galloped down the ill-paved street.\n\nEven before the troopers had drawn rein the officer had hailed Bibot.\n\n\"Citizen,\" he shouted, and his voice was breathless, for he had\nevidently ridden hard and fast, \"this message to you from the citizen\nChief Commissary of the Section. Six men are wanted by the Committee of\nPublic Safety. They are disguised as carriers in the employ of a market\ngardener, and have passports for Barency!... The passports are stolen:\nthe men are traitors--escaped aristocrats--and their spokesman is that\nd--d Englishman, the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\nBibot tried to speak; he tugged at the collar of his ragged shirt; an\nawful curse escaped him.\n\n\"Ten thousand devils!\" he roared.\n\n\"On no account allow these people to go through,\" continued the officer.\n\"Keep their passports. Detain them!... Understand?\"\n\nBibot was still gasping for breath even whilst the officer, ordering a\nquick \"Turn!\" reeled his horse round, ready to gallop away as far as he\nhad come.\n\n\"I am for the St. Denis Gate--Grosjean is on guard there!\" he shouted.\n\"Same orders all round the city. No one to leave the gates!...\nUnderstand?\"\n\nHis troopers fell in. The next moment he would be gone, and those cursed\naristocrats well in safety's way.\n\n\"Citizen Captain!\"\n\nThe hoarse shout at last contrived to escape Bibot's parched throat. As\nif involuntarily, the officer drew rein once more.\n\n\"What is it? Quick!--I've no time. That confounded Englishman may be at\nthe St. Denis Gate even now!\"\n\n\"Citizen Captain,\" gasped Bibot, his breath coming and going like that\nof a man fighting for his life. \"Here!... at this gate!... not half an\nhour ago ... six men ... carriers ... market gardeners ... I seemed to\nknow their faces....\"\n\n\"Yes! yes! market gardener's carriers,\" exclaimed the officer gleefully,\n\"aristocrats all of them ... and that d--d Scarlet Pimpernel. You've got\nthem? You've detained them?... Where are they?... Speak, man, in the\nname of hell!...\"\n\n\"Gone!\" gasped Bibot. His legs would no longer bear him. He fell\nbackwards on to a heap of street debris and refuse, from which lowly\nvantage ground he contrived to give away the whole miserable tale.\n\n\"Gone! half an hour ago. Their passports were in order!... I seemed to\nknow their faces! Citizen Marat was here.... He, too--\"\n\nIn a moment the officer had once more swung his horse round, so that the\nanimal reared, with wild forefeet pawing the air, with champing of bit,\nand white foam scattered around.\n\n\"A thousand million curses!\" he exclaimed. \"Citizen Bibot, your head\nwill pay for this treachery. Which way did they go?\"\n\nA dozen hands were ready to point in the direction where the merry party\nof carriers had disappeared half an hour ago; a dozen tongues gave\nrapid, confused explanations.\n\n\"Into it, my men!\" shouted the officer; \"they were on foot! They can't\nhave gone far. Remember the Republic has offered ten thousand francs for\nthe capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\nAlready the heavy gates had been swung open, and the officer's voice\nonce more rang out clear through a perfect thunder-clap of fast\ngalloping hoofs:\n\n\"Ventre a terre! Remember!--ten thousand francs to him who first sights\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel!\"\n\nThe thunder-clap died away in the distance, the dust of four score hoofs\nwas merged in the fog and in the darkness; the voice of the captain was\nraised again through the mist-laden air. One shout ... a shout of\ntriumph ... then silence once again.\n\nBibot had fainted on the heap of debris.\n\nHis comrades brought him wine to drink. He gradually revived. Hope came\nback to his heart; his nerves soon steadied themselves as the heavy\nbeverage filtrated through into his blood.\n\n\"Bah!\" he ejaculated as he pulled himself together, \"the troopers were\nwell-mounted ... the officer was enthusiastic; those carriers could not\nhave walked very far. And, in any case, I am free from blame. Citoyen\nMarat himself was here and let them pass!\"\n\nA shudder of superstitious terror ran through him as he recollected the\nwhole scene: for surely he knew all the faces of the six men who had\ngone through the gate. The devil indeed must have given the mysterious\nEnglishman power to transmute himself and his gang wholly into the\nbodies of other people.\n\nMore than an hour went by. Bibot was quite himself again, bullying,\ncommanding, detaining everybody now.\n\nAt that time there appeared to be a slight altercation going on, on the\nfarther side of the gate. Bibot thought it his duty to go and see what\nthe noise was about. Someone wanting to get into Paris instead of out of\nit at this hour of the night was a strange occurrence.\n\nBibot heard his name spoken by a raucous voice. Accompanied by two of\nhis men he crossed the wide gates in order to see what was happening.\nOne of the men held a lanthorn, which he was swinging high above his\nhead. Bibot saw standing there before him, arguing with the guard by the\ngate, the bibulous spokesman of the band of carriers.\n\nHe was explaining to the sentry that he had a message to deliver to the\ncitizen commanding at the Porte Montmartre.\n\n\"It is a note,\" he said, \"which an officer of the mounted guard gave me.\nHe and twenty troopers were galloping down the great North Road not far\nfrom Barency. When they overtook the six of us they drew rein, and the\nofficer gave me this note for citizen Bibot and fifty francs if I would\ndeliver it tonight.\"\n\n\"Give me the note!\" said Bibot calmly.\n\nBut his hand shook as he took the paper; his face was livid with fear\nand rage.\n\nThe paper had no writing on it, only the outline of a small scarlet\nflower done in red--the device of the cursed Englishman, the Scarlet\nPimpernel.\n\n\"Which way did the officer and the twenty troopers go,\" he stammered,\n\"after they gave you this note?\"\n\n\"On the way to Calais,\" replied the other, \"but they had magnificent\nhorses, and didn't spare them either. They are a league and more away by\nnow!\"\n\nAll the blood in Bibot's body seemed to rush up to his head, a wild\nbuzzing was in his ears....\n\nAnd that was how the Duc and Duchesse de Montreux, with their servants\nand family, escaped from Paris on that third day of Nivose in the year I\nof the Republic.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTWO GOOD PATRIOTS\n\n\nBeing the deposition of citizeness Fanny Roussell, who was brought up,\ntogether with her husband, before the Tribunal of the Revolution on a\ncharge of treason--both being subsequently acquitted.\n\nMy name is Fanny Roussell, and I am a respectable married woman, and as\ngood a patriot as any of you sitting there.\n\nAye, and I'll say it with my dying breath, though you may send me to the\nguillotine ... as you probably will, for you are all thieves and\nmurderers, every one of you, and you have already made up your minds\nthat I and my man are guilty of having sheltered that accursed\nEnglishman whom they call the Scarlet Pimpernel ... and of having helped\nhim to escape.\n\nBut I'll tell you how it all happened, because, though you call me a\ntraitor to the people of France, yet am I a true patriot and will prove\nit to you by telling you exactly how everything occurred, so that you\nmay be on your guard against the cleverness of that man, who, I do\nbelieve, is a friend and confederate of the devil ... else how could he\nhave escaped that time?\n\nWell! it was three days ago, and as bitterly cold as anything that my\nman and I can remember. We had no travellers staying in the house, for\nwe are a good three leagues out of Calais, and too far for the folk who\nhave business in or about the harbour. Only at midday the coffee-room\nwould get full sometimes with people on their way to or from the port.\n\nBut in the evenings the place was quite deserted, and so lonely that at\ntimes we fancied that we could hear the wolves howling in the forest of\nSt. Pierre.\n\nIt was close on eight o'clock, and my man was putting up the shutters,\nwhen suddenly we heard the tramp of feet on the road outside, and then\nthe quick word, \"Halt!\"\n\nThe next moment there was a peremptory knock at the door. My man opened\nit, and there stood four men in the uniform of the 9th Regiment of the\nLine ... the same that is quartered at Calais. The uniform, of course, I\nknew well, though I did not know the men by sight.\n\n\"In the name of the People and by the order of the Committee of Public\nSafety!\" said one of the men, who stood in the forefront, and who, I\nnoticed, had a corporal's stripe on his left sleeve.\n\nHe held out a paper, which was covered with seals and with writing, but\nas neither my man nor I can read, it was no use our looking at it.\n\nHercule--that is my husband's name, citizens--asked the corporal what\nthe Committee of Public Safety wanted with us poor hoteliers of a\nwayside inn.\n\n\"Only food and shelter for to-night for me and my men,\" replied the\ncorporal, quite civilly.\n\n\"You can rest here,\" said Hercule, and he pointed to the benches in the\ncoffee-room, \"and if there is any soup left in the stockpot, you are\nwelcome to it.\"\n\nHercule, you see, is a good patriot, and he had been a soldier in his\nday.... No! no ... do not interrupt me, any of you ... you would only be\nsaying that I ought to have known ... but listen to the end.\n\n\"The soup we'll gladly eat,\" said the corporal very pleasantly. \"As for\nshelter ... well! I am afraid that this nice warm coffee-room will not\nexactly serve our purpose. We want a place where we can lie hidden, and\nat the same time keep a watch on the road. I noticed an outhouse as we\ncame. By your leave we will sleep in there.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" said my man curtly.\n\nHe frowned as he said this, and it suddenly seemed as if some vague\nsuspicion had crept into Hercule's mind.\n\nThe corporal, however, appeared unaware of this, for he went on quite\ncheerfully:\n\n\"Ah! that is excellent! Entre nous, citizen, my men and I have a\ndesperate customer to deal with. I'll not mention his name, for I see\nyou have guessed it already. A small red flower, what?... Well, we know\nthat he must be making straight for the port of Calais, for he has been\ntraced through St. Omer and Ardres. But he cannot possibly enter Calais\ncity to-night, for we are on the watch for him. He must seek shelter\nsomewhere for himself and any other aristocrat he may have with him,\nand, bar this house, there is no other place between Ardres and Calais\nwhere he can get it. The night is bitterly cold, with a snow blizzard\nraging round. I and my men have been detailed to watch this road, other\npatrols are guarding those that lead toward Boulogne and to Gravelines;\nbut I have an idea, citizen, that our fox is making for Calais, and that\nto me will fall the honour of handing that tiresome scarlet flower to\nthe Public Prosecutor en route for Madame la Guillotine.\"\n\nNow I could not really tell you, citizens, what suspicions had by this\ntime entered Hercule's head or mine; certainly what suspicions we did\nhave were still very vague.\n\nI prepared the soup for the men and they ate it heartily, after which my\nhusband led the way to the outhouse where we sometimes stabled a\ntraveller's horse when the need arose.\n\nIt is nice and dry, and always filled with warm, fresh straw. The\nentrance into it immediately faces the road; the corporal declared that\nnothing would suit him and his men better.\n\nThey retired to rest apparently, but we noticed that two men remained on\nthe watch just inside the entrance, whilst the two others curled up in\nthe straw.\n\nHercule put out the lights in the coffee-room, and then he and I went\nupstairs--not to bed, mind you--but to have a quiet talk together over\nthe events of the past half-hour.\n\nThe result of our talk was that ten minutes later my man quietly stole\ndownstairs and out of the house. He did not, however, go out by the\nfront door, but through a back way which, leading through a\ncabbage-patch and then across a field, cuts into the main road some two\nhundred metres higher up.\n\nHercule and I had decided that he would walk the three leagues into\nCalais, despite the cold, which was intense, and the blizzard, which was\nnearly blinding, and that he would call at the post of gendarmerie at\nthe city gates, and there see the officer in command and tell him the\nexact state of the case. It would then be for that officer to decide\nwhat was to be done; our responsibility as loyal citizens would be\ncompletely covered.\n\nHercule, you must know, had just emerged from our cabbage-patch on to\nthe field when he was suddenly challenged:\n\n\"Qui va la?\"\n\nHe gave his name. His certificate of citizenship was in his pocket; he\nhad nothing to fear. Through the darkness and the veil of snow he had\ndiscerned a small group of men wearing the uniform of the 9th Regiment\nof the Line.\n\n\"Four men,\" said the foremost of these, speaking quickly and\ncommandingly, \"wearing the same uniform that I and my men are wearing\n... have you seen them?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hercule hurriedly.\n\n\"Where are they?\"\n\n\"In the outhouse close by.\"\n\nThe other suppressed a cry of triumph.\n\n\"At them, my men!\" he said in a whisper, \"and you, citizen, thank your\nstars that we have not come too late.\"\n\n\"These men ...\" whispered Hercule. \"I had my suspicions.\"\n\n\"Aristocrats, citizen,\" rejoined the commander of the little party, \"and\none of them is that cursed Englishman--the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\nAlready the soldiers, closely followed by Hercule, had made their way\nthrough our cabbage-patch back to the house.\n\nThe next moment they had made a bold dash for the barn. There was a\ngreat deal of shouting, a great deal of swearing and some firing, whilst\nHercule and I, not a little frightened, remained in the coffee-room,\nanxiously awaiting events.\n\nPresently the group of soldiers returned, not the ones who had first\ncome, but the others. I noticed their leader, who seemed to be\nexceptionally tall.\n\nHe looked very cheerful, and laughed loudly as he entered the\ncoffee-room. From the moment that I looked at his face I knew, somehow,\nthat Hercule and I had been fooled, and that now, indeed, we stood eye\nto eye with that mysterious personage who is called the Scarlet\nPimpernel.\n\nI screamed, and Hercule made a dash for the door; but what could two\nhumble and peaceful citizens do against this band of desperate men, who\nheld their lives in their own hands? They were four and we were two, and\nI do believe that their leader has supernatural strength and power.\n\nHe treated us quite kindly, even though he ordered his followers to bind\nus down to our bed upstairs, and to tie a cloth round our mouths so that\nour cries could not be distinctly heard.\n\nNeither my man nor I closed an eye all night, of course, but we heard\nthe miscreants moving about in the coffee-room below. But they did no\nmischief, nor did they steal any of the food or wines.\n\nAt daybreak we heard them going out by the front door, and their\nfootsteps disappearing toward Calais. We found their discarded uniforms\nlying in the coffee-room. They must have entered Calais by daylight,\nwhen the gates were opened--just like other peaceable citizens. No doubt\nthey had forged passports, just as they had stolen uniforms.\n\nOur maid-of-all-work released us from our terrible position in the\ncourse of the morning, and we released the soldiers of the 9th Regiment\nof the Line, whom we found bound and gagged, some of them wounded, in\nthe outhouse.\n\nThat same afternoon we were arrested, and here we are, ready to die if\nwe must, but I swear that I have told you the truth, and I ask you, in\nthe name of justice, if we have done anything wrong, and if we did not\nact like loyal and true citizens, even though we were pitted against an\nemissary of the devil?\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE OLD SCARECROW\n\n\nNobody in the quartier could quite recollect when it was that the new\nPublic Letter-Writer first set up in business at the angle formed by the\nQuai des Augustins and the Rue Dauphine, immediately facing the Pont\nNeuf; but there he certainly was on the 28th day of February, 1793, when\nAgnes, with eyes swollen with tears, a market basket on her arm, and a\nlook of dreary despair on her young face, turned that selfsame angle on\nher way to the Pont Neuf, and nearly fell over the rickety construction\nwhich sheltered him and his stock-in-trade.\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu! citizen Lepine, I had no idea you were here,\" she\nexclaimed as soon as she had recovered her balance.\n\n\"Nor I, citizeness, that I should have the pleasure of seeing you this\nmorning,\" he retorted.\n\n\"But you were always at the other corner of the Pont Neuf,\" she argued.\n\n\"So I was,\" he replied, \"so I was. But I thought I would like a change.\nThe Faubourg St. Michel appealed to me; most of my clients came to me\nfrom this side of the river--all those on the other side seem to know\nhow to read and write.\"\n\n\"I was just going over to see you,\" she remarked.\n\n\"You, citizeness,\" he exclaimed in unfeigned surprise, \"what should\nprocure a poor public writer the honour of--\"\n\n\"Hush, in God's name!\" broke in the young girl quickly as she cast a\nrapid, furtive glance up and down the quai and the narrow streets which\nconverged at this angle.\n\nShe was dressed in the humblest and poorest of clothes, her skimpy shawl\nround her shoulders could scarce protect her against the cold of this\ncruel winter's morning; her hair was entirely hidden beneath a frilled\nand starched cap, and her feet were encased in coarse worsted stockings\nand sabots, but her hands were delicate and fine, and her face had that\nnobility of feature and look of patient resignation in the midst of\noverwhelming sorrow which proclaimed a lofty refinement both of soul and\nof mind.\n\nThe old Letter-Writer was surveying the pathetic young figure before him\nthrough his huge horn-rimmed spectacles, and she smiled on him through\nher fast-gathering tears. He used to have his pitch at the angle of the\nPont Neuf, and whenever Agnes had walked past it, she had nodded to him\nand bidden him \"Good morrow!\" He had at times done little commissions\nfor her and gone on errands when she needed a messenger; to-day, in the\nmidst of her despair, she had suddenly thought of him and that rumour\ncredited him with certain knowledge which she would give her all to\npossess.\n\nShe had sallied forth this morning with the express purpose of speaking\nwith him; but now suddenly she felt afraid, and stood looking at him for\na moment or two, hesitating, wondering if she dared tell him--one never\nknew these days into what terrible pitfall an ill-considered word might\nlead one.\n\nA scarecrow he was, that old Public Letter-Writer, more like a great,\ngaunt bird than a human being, with those spectacles of his, and his\nlong, very sparse and very lanky fringe of a beard which fell from his\ncheeks and chin and down his chest for all the world like a crumpled\ngrey bib. He was wrapped from head to foot in a caped coat which had\nonce been green in colour, but was now of many hues not usually seen in\nrainbows. He wore his coat all buttoned down the front, like a\ndressing-gown, and below the hem there peeped out a pair of very large\nfeet encased in boots which had never been a pair. He sat upon a\nrickety, straw-bottomed chair under an improvised awning which was made\nup of four poles and a bit of sacking. He had a table in front of him--a\ntable partially and very insecurely propped up by a bundle of old papers\nand books, since no two of its four legs were completely whole--and on\nthe table there was a neckless bottle half-filled with ink, a few sheets\nof paper and a couple of quill pens.\n\nThe young girl's hesitation had indeed not lasted more than a few\nseconds.\n\nFurtively, like a young creature terrified of lurking enemies, she once\nmore glanced to right and left of her and down the two streets and the\nriver bank, for Paris was full of spies these days--human bloodhounds\nready for a few sous to sell their fellow-creatures' lives. It was\nmiddle morning now, and a few passers-by were hurrying along wrapped to\nthe nose in mufflers, for the weather was bitterly cold.\n\nAgnes waited until there was no one in sight, then she leaned forward\nover the table and whispered under her breath:\n\n\"They say, citizen, that you alone in Paris know the whereabouts of the\nEnglish milor'--of him who is called the Scarlet Pimpernel....\"\n\n\"Hush-sh-sh!\" said the old man quickly, for just at that moment two men\nhad gone by, in ragged coats and torn breeches, who had leered at Agnes\nand her neat cap and skirt as they passed. Now they had turned the angle\nof the street and the old man, too, sank his voice to a whisper.\n\n\"I know nothing of any Englishman,\" he muttered.\n\n\"Yes, you do,\" she rejoined insistently. \"When poor Antoine Carre was\nsomewhere in hiding and threatened with arrest, and his mother dared not\nwrite to him lest her letter be intercepted, she spoke to you about the\nEnglish milor', and the English milor' found Antoine Carre and took him\nand his mother safely out of France. Mme. Carre is my godmother.... I\nsaw her the very night when she went to meet the English milor' at his\ncommands. I know all that happened then.... I know that you were the\nintermediary.\"\n\n\"And if I was,\" he muttered sullenly as he fiddled with his pen and\npaper, \"maybe I've had cause to regret it. For a week after that Carre\nepisode I dared not show my face in the streets of Paris; for nigh on a\nfortnight I dared not ply my trade ... I have only just ventured again\nto set up in business. I am not going to risk my old neck again in a\nhurry....\"\n\n\"It is a matter of life and death,\" urged Agnes, as once more the tears\nrushed to her pleading eyes and the look of misery settled again upon\nher face.\n\n\"Your life, citizeness?\" queried the old man, \"or that of citizen-deputy\nFabrice?\"\n\n\"Hush!\" she broke in again, as a look of real terror now overspread her\nface. Then she added under her breath: \"You know?\"\n\n\"I know that Mademoiselle Agnes de Lucines is fiancee to the\ncitizen-deputy Arnould Fabrice,\" rejoined the old man quietly, \"and that\nit is Mademoiselle Agnes de Lucines who is speaking with me now.\"\n\n\"You have known that all along?\"\n\n\"Ever since mademoiselle first tripped past me at the angle of the Pont\nNeuf dressed in winsey kirtle and wearing sabots on her feet....\"\n\n\"But how?\" she murmured, puzzled, not a little frightened, for his\nknowledge might prove dangerous to her. She was of gentle birth, and as\nsuch an object of suspicion to the Government of the Republic and of the\nTerror; her mother was a hopeless cripple, unable to move: this together\nwith her love for Arnould Fabrice had kept Agnes de Lucines in France\nthese days, even though she was in hourly peril of arrest.\n\n\"Tell me what has happened,\" the old man said, unheeding her last\nanxious query. \"Perhaps I can help ...\"\n\n\"Oh! you cannot--the English milor' can and will if only we could know\nwhere he is. I thought of him the moment I received that awful man's\nletter--and then I thought of you....\"\n\n\"Tell me about the letter--quickly,\" he interrupted her with some\nimpatience. \"I'll be writing something--but talk away, I shall hear\nevery word. But for God's sake be as brief as you can.\"\n\nHe drew some paper nearer to him and dipped his pen in the ink. He\nappeared to be writing under her dictation. Thin, flaky snow had begun\nto fall and settled in a smooth white carpet upon the frozen ground, and\nthe footsteps of the passers-by sounded muffled as they hurried along.\nOnly the lapping of the water of the sluggish river close by broke the\nabsolute stillness of the air.\n\nAgnes de Lucines' pale face looked ethereal in this framework of white\nwhich covered her shoulders and the shawl crossed over her bosom: only\nher eyes, dark, appealing, filled with a glow of immeasurable despair,\nappeared tensely human and alive.\n\n\"I had a letter this morning,\" she whispered, speaking very rapidly,\n\"from citizen Heriot--that awful man--you know him?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\"\n\n\"He used to be valet in the service of deputy Fabrice. Now he, too, is a\nmember of the National Assembly ... he is arrogant and cruel and vile.\nHe hates Arnould Fabrice and he professes himself passionately in love\nwith me.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" murmured the old man, \"but the letter?\"\n\n\"It came this morning. In it he says that he has in his possession a\nnumber of old letters, documents and manuscripts which are quite enough\nto send deputy Fabrice to the guillotine. He threatens to place all\nthose papers before the Committee of Public Safety unless ... unless\nI....\"\n\nShe paused, and a deep blush, partly of shame, partly of wrath, suffused\nher pale cheeks.\n\n\"Unless you accept his grimy hand in marriage,\" concluded the man dryly.\n\nHer eyes gave him answer. With pathetic insistence she tried now to\nglean a ray of hope from the old scarecrow's inscrutable face. But he\nwas bending over his writing: his fingers were blue with cold, his great\nshoulders were stooping to his task.\n\n\"Citizen,\" she pleaded.\n\n\"Hush!\" he muttered, \"no more now. The very snowflakes are made up of\nwhispers that may reach those bloodhounds yet. The English milor' shall\nknow of this. He will send you a message if he thinks fit.\"\n\n\"Citizen--\"\n\n\"Not another word, in God's name! Pay me five sous for this letter and\npray Heaven that you have not been watched.\"\n\nShe shivered and drew her shawl closer round her shoulders, then she\ncounted out five sous with elaborate care and laid them out upon the\ntable. The old man took up the coins. He blew into his fingers, which\nlooked paralysed with the cold. The snow lay over everything now; the\nrough awning had not protected him or his wares.\n\nAgnes turned to go. The last she saw of him, as she went up the Rue\nDauphine, was one broad shoulder still bending over the table, and clad\nin the shabby, caped coat all covered with snow like an old Santa Claus.\n\n\nII\n\nIt was half-an-hour before noon, and citizen-deputy Heriot was preparing\nto go out to the small tavern round the corner where he habitually took\nhis dejeuner. Citizen Rondeau, who for the consideration of ten sous a\nday looked after Heriot's paltry creature-comforts, was busy tidying up\nthe squalid apartment which the latter occupied on the top floor of a\nlodging-house in the Rue Cocatrice. This apartment consisted of three\nrooms leading out of one another; firstly there was a dark and narrow\nantichambre wherein slept the aforesaid citizen-servant; then came a\nsitting-room sparsely furnished with a few chairs, a centre table and an\niron stove, and finally there was the bedroom wherein the most\nconspicuous object was a large oak chest clamped with wide iron hinges\nand a massive writing-desk; the bed and a very primitive washstand were\nin an alcove at the farther end of the room and partially hidden by a\ntapestry curtain.\n\nAt exactly half-past seven that morning there came a peremptory knock at\nthe door of the antichambre, and as Rondeau was busy in the bedroom,\nHeriot went himself to see who his unexpected visitor might be. On the\nlanding outside stood an extraordinary-looking individual--more like a\ntall and animated scarecrow than a man--who in a tremulous voice asked\nif he might speak with the citizen Heriot.\n\n\"That is my name,\" said the deputy gruffly, \"what do you want?\"\n\nHe would have liked to slam the door in the old scarecrow's face, but\nthe latter, with the boldness which sometimes besets the timid, had\nalready stepped into the anti-chambre and was now quietly sauntering\nthrough to the next room into the one beyond. Heriot, being a\nrepresentative of the people and a social democrat of the most advanced\ntype, was supposed to be accessible to every one who desired speech with\nhim. Though muttering sundry curses, he thought it best not to go\nagainst his usual practice, and after a moment's hesitation he followed\nhis unwelcome visitor.\n\nThe latter was in the sitting-room by this time; he had drawn a chair\nclose to the table and sat down with the air of one who has a perfect\nright to be where he is; as soon as Heriot entered he said placidly:\n\n\"I would desire to speak alone with the citizen-deputy.\"\n\nAnd Heriot, after another slight hesitation, ordered Rondeau to close\nthe bedroom door.\n\n\"Keep your ears open in case I call,\" he added significantly.\n\n\"You are cautious, citizen,\" merely remarked the visitor with a smile.\n\nTo this Heriot vouchsafed no reply. He, too, drew a chair forward and\nsat opposite his visitor, then he asked abruptly: \"Your name and\nquality?\"\n\n\"My name is Lepine at your service,\" said the old man, \"and by\nprofession I write letters at the rate of five sous or so, according to\nlength, for those who are not able to do it for themselves.\"\n\n\"Your business with me?\" queried Heriot curtly.\n\n\"To offer you two thousand francs for the letters which you stole from\ndeputy Fabrice when you were his valet,\" replied Lepine with perfect\ncalm.\n\nIn a moment Heriot was on his feet, jumping up as if he had been stung;\nhis pale, short-sighted eyes narrowed till they were mere slits, and\nthrough them he darted a quick, suspicious glance at the extraordinary\nout-at-elbows figure before him. Then he threw back his head and laughed\ntill the tears streamed down his cheeks and his sides began to ache.\n\n\"This is a farce, I presume, citizen,\" he said when he had recovered\nsomething of his composure.\n\n\"No farce, citizen,\" replied Lepine calmly. \"The money is at your\ndisposal whenever you care to bring the letters to my pitch at the angle\nof the Rue Dauphine and the Quai des Augustins, where I carry on my\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Whose money is it? Agnes de Lucines' or did that fool Fabrice send\nyou?\"\n\n\"No one sent me, citizen. The money is mine--a few savings I possess--I\nhonour citizen Fabrice--I would wish to do him service by purchasing\ncertain letters from you.\"\n\nThen as Heriot, moody and sullen, remained silent and began pacing up\nand down the long, bare floor of the room, Lepine added persuasively,\n\"Well! what do you say? Two thousand francs for a packet of letters--not\na bad bargain these hard times.\"\n\n\"Get out of this room,\" was Heriot's fierce and sudden reply.\n\n\"You refuse?\"\n\n\"Get out of this room!\"\n\n\"As you please,\" said Lepine as he, too, rose from his chair. \"But\nbefore I go, citizen Heriot,\" he added, speaking very quietly, \"let me\ntell you one thing. Mademoiselle Agnes de Lucines would far sooner cut\noff her right hand than let yours touch it even for one instant. Neither\nshe nor deputy Fabrice would ever purchase their lives at such a price.\"\n\n\"And who are you--you mangy old scarecrow?\" retorted Heriot, who was\ngetting beside himself with rage, \"that you should assert these things?\nWhat are those people to you, or you to them, that you should interfere\nin their affairs?\"\n\n\"Your question is beside the point, citizen,\" said Lepine blandly; \"I am\nhere to propose a bargain. Had you not better agree to it?\"\n\n\"Never!\" reiterated Heriot emphatically.\n\n\"Two thousand francs,\" reiterated the old man imperturbably.\n\n\"Not if you offered me two hundred thousand,\" retorted the other\nfiercely. \"Go and tell that, to those who sent you. Tell them that\nI--Heriot--would look upon a fortune as mere dross against the delight\nof seeing that man Fabrice, whom I hate beyond everything in earth or\nhell, mount up the steps to the guillotine. Tell them that I know that\nAgnes de Lucines loathes me, that I know that she loves him. I know that\nI cannot win her save by threatening him. But you are wrong, citizen\nLepine,\" he continued, speaking more and more calmly as his passions of\nhatred and of love seemed more and more to hold him in their grip; \"you\nare wrong if you think that she will not strike a bargain with me in\norder to save the life of Fabrice, whom she loves. Agnes de Lucines will\nbe my wife within the month, or Arnould Fabrice's head will fall under\nthe guillotine, and you, my interfering friend, may go to the devil, if\nyou please.\"\n\n\"That would be but a tame proceeding, citizen, after my visit to you,\"\nsaid the old man, with unruffled sang-froid. \"But let me, in my turn,\nassure you of this, citizen Heriot,\" he added, \"that Mlle. de Lucines\nwill never be your wife, that Arnould Fabrice will not end his valuable\nlife under the guillotine--and that you will never be allowed to use\nagainst him the cowardly and stolen weapon which you possess.\"\n\nHeriot laughed--a low, cynical laugh and shrugged his thin shoulders:\n\n\"And who will prevent me, I pray you?\" he asked sarcastically.\n\nThe old man made no immediate reply, but he came just a step or two\ncloser to the citizen-deputy and, suddenly drawing himself up to his\nfull height, he looked for one brief moment down upon the mean and\nsordid figure of the ex-valet. To Heriot it seemed as if the whole man\nhad become transfigured; the shabby old scarecrow looked all of a sudden\nlike a brilliant and powerful personality; from his eyes there flashed\ndown a look of supreme contempt and of supreme pride, and Heriot--unable\nto understand this metamorphosis which was more apparent to his inner\nconsciousness than to his outward sight, felt his knees shake under him\nand all the blood rush back to his heart in an agony of superstitious\nterror.\n\nFrom somewhere there came to his ear the sound of two words: \"I will!\"\nin reply to his own defiant query. Surely those words uttered by a man\nconscious of power and of strength could never have been spoken by the\ndilapidated old scarecrow who earned a precarious living by writing\nletters for ignorant folk.\n\nBut before he could recover some semblance of presence of mind citizen\nLepine had gone, and only a loud and merry laugh seemed to echo through\nthe squalid room.\n\nHeriot shook off the remnant of his own senseless terror; he tore open\nthe door of the bedroom and shouted to Rondeau, who truly was thinking\nthat the citizen-deputy had gone mad:\n\n\"After him!--after him! Quick! curse you!\" he cried.\n\n\"After whom?\" gasped the man.\n\n\"The man who was here just now--an aristo.\"\n\n\"I saw no one--but the Public Letter-Writer, old Lepine--I know him\nwell---\"\n\n\"Curse you for a fool!\" shouted Heriot savagely, \"the man who was here\nwas that cursed Englishman--the one whom they call the Scarlet\nPimpernel. Run after him--stop him, I say!\"\n\n\"Too late, citizen,\" said the other placidly; \"whoever was here before\nis certainly half-way down the street by now.\"\n\n\nIII\n\n\"No use, Ffoulkes,\" said Sir Percy Blakeney to his friend half-an-hour\nlater, \"the man's passions of hatred and desire are greater than his\ngreed.\"\n\nThe two men were sitting together in one of Sir Percy Blakeney's many\nlodgings--the one in the Rue des Petits Peres--and Sir Percy had just\nput Sir Andrew Ffoulkes au fait with the whole sad story of Arnould\nFabrice's danger and Agnes de Lucines' despair.\n\n\"You could do nothing with the brute, then?\" queried Sir Andrew.\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Blakeney. \"He refused all bribes, and violence would\nnot have helped me, for what I wanted was not to knock him down, but to\nget hold of the letters.\"\n\n\"Well, after all, he might have sold you the letters and then denounced\nFabrice just the same.\"\n\n\"No, without actual proofs he could not do that. Arnould Fabrice is not\na man against whom a mere denunciation would suffice. He has the\ngrudging respect of every faction in the National Assembly. Nothing but\nirrefutable proof would prevail against him--and bring him to the\nguillotine.\"\n\n\"Why not get Fabrice and Mlle. de Lucines safely over to England?\"\n\n\"Fabrice would not come. He is not of the stuff that emigres are made\nof. He is not an aristocrat; he is a republican by conviction, and a\ndemmed honest one at that. He would scorn to run away, and Agnes de\nLucines would not go without him.\"\n\n\"Then what can we do?\"\n\n\"Filch those letters from that brute Heriot,\" said Blakeney calmly.\n\n\"House-breaking, you mean!\" commented Sir Andrew Ffoulkes dryly.\n\n\"Petty theft, shall we say?\" retorted Sir Percy. \"I can bribe the lout\nwho has charge of Heriot's rooms to introduce us into his master's\nsanctum this evening when the National Assembly is sitting and the\ncitizen-deputy safely out of the way.\"\n\nAnd the two men--one of whom was the most intimate friend of the Prince\nof Wales and the acknowledged darling of London society--thereupon fell\nto discussing plans for surreptitiously entering a man's room and\ncommitting larceny, which in normal times would entail, if discovered, a\nlong term of imprisonment, but which, in these days, in Paris, and\nperpetrated against a member of the National Assembly, would certainly\nbe punished by death.\n\n\nIV\n\nCitizen Rondeau, whose business it was to look after the creature\ncomforts of deputy Heriot, was standing in the antichambre facing the\ntwo visitors whom he had just introduced into his master's apartments,\nand idly turning a couple of gold coins over and over between his grimy\nfingers.\n\n\"And mind, you are to see nothing and hear nothing of what goes on in\nthe next room,\" said the taller of the two strangers; \"and when we go\nthere'll be another couple of louis for you. Is that understood?\"\n\n\"Yes! it's understood,\" grunted Rondeau sullenly; \"but I am running\ngreat risks. The citizen-deputy sometimes returns at ten o'clock, but\nsometimes at nine.... I never know.\"\n\n\"It is now seven,\" rejoined the other; \"we'll be gone long before nine.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Rondeau surlily, \"I go out now for my supper. I'll return\nin half an hour, but at half-past eight you must clear out.\"\n\nThen he added with a sneer:\n\n\"Citizens Legros and Desgas usually come back with deputy Heriot of\nnights, and citizens Jeanniot and Bompard come in from next door for a\ngame of cards. You wouldn't stand much chance if you were caught here.\"\n\n\"Not with you to back up so formidable a quintette of stalwarts,\"\nassented the tall visitor gaily. \"But we won't trouble about that just\nnow. We have a couple of hours before us in which to do all that we\nwant. So au revoir, friend Rondeau ... two more louis for your\ncomplaisance, remember, when we have accomplished our purpose.\"\n\nRondeau muttered something more, but the two strangers paid no further\nheed to him; they had already walked to the next room, leaving Rondeau\nin the antichambre.\n\nSir Percy Blakeney did not pause in the sitting-room where an oil lamp\nsuspended from the ceiling threw a feeble circle of light above the\ncentre table. He went straight through to the bedroom. Here, too, a\nsmall lamp was burning which only lit up a small portion of the\nroom--the writing-desk and the oak chest--leaving the corners and the\nalcove, with its partially drawn curtains, in complete shadow.\n\nBlakeney pointed to the oak chest and to the desk.\n\n\"You tackle the chest, Ffoulkes, and I will go for the desk,\" he said\nquietly, as soon as he had taken a rapid survey of the room. \"You have\nyour tools?\"\n\nFfoulkes nodded, and anon in this squalid room, ill-lit, ill-ventilated,\nbarely furnished, was presented one of the most curious spectacles of\nthese strange and troublous times: two English gentlemen, the\nacknowledged dandies of London drawing-rooms, busy picking locks and\nfiling hinges like any common house-thieves.\n\nNeither of them spoke, and a strange hush fell over the room--a hush\nonly broken by the click of metal against metal, and the deep breathing\nof the two men bending to their task. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes was working\nwith a file on the padlocks of the oak chest, and Sir Percy Blakeney,\nwith a bunch of skeleton keys, was opening the drawers of the\nwriting-desk. These, when finally opened, revealed nothing of any\nimportance; but when anon Sir Andrew was able to lift the lid of the oak\nchest, he disclosed an innumerable quantity of papers and documents tied\nup in neat bundles, docketed and piled up in rows and tiers to the very\ntop of the chest.\n\n\"Quick to work, Ffoulkes,\" said Blakeney, as in response to his friend's\ncall he drew a chair forward and, seating himself beside the chest,\nstarted on the task of looking through the hundreds of bundles which lay\nbefore him. \"It will take us all our time to look through these.\"\n\nTogether now the two men set to work--methodically and quietly--piling\nup on the floor beside them the bundles of papers which they had already\nexamined, and delving into the oak chest for others. No sound was heard\nsave the crackling of crisp paper and an occasional ejaculation from\neither of them when they came upon some proof or other of Heriot's\npropensity for blackmail.\n\n\"Agnes de Lucines is not the only one whom this brute is terrorising,\"\nmurmured Blakeney once between his teeth; \"I marvel that the man ever\nfeels safe, alone in these lodgings, with no one but that weak-kneed\nRondeau to protect him. He must have scores of enemies in this city who\nwould gladly put a dagger in his heart or a bullet through his back.\"\n\nThey had been at work for close on half an hour when an exclamation of\ntriumph, quickly smothered, escaped Sir Percy's lips.\n\n\"By Gad, Ffoulkes!\" he said, \"I believe I have got what we want!\"\n\nWith quick, capable hands he turned over a bundle which he had just\nextracted from the chest. Rapidly he glanced through them. \"I have them,\nFfoulkes,\" he reiterated more emphatically as he put the bundle into his\npocket; \"now everything back in its place and--\"\n\nSuddenly he paused, his slender hand up to his lips, his head turned\ntoward the door, an expression of tense expectancy in every line of his\nface.\n\n\"Quick, Ffoulkes,\" he whispered, \"everything back into the chest, and\nthe lid down.\"\n\n\"What ears you have,\" murmured Ffoulkes as he obeyed rapidly and without\nquestion. \"I heard nothing.\"\n\nBlakeney went to the door and bent his head to listen.\n\n\"Three men coming up the stairs,\" he said; \"they are on the landing\nnow.\"\n\n\"Have we time to rush them?\"\n\n\"No chance! They are at the door. Two more men have joined them, and I\ncan distinguish Rondeau's voice, too.\"\n\n\"The quintette,\" murmured Sir Andrew. \"We are caught like two rats in a\ntrap.\"\n\nEven as he spoke the opening of the outside door could be distinctly\nheard, then the confused murmur of many voices. Already Blakeney and\nFfoulkes had with perfect presence of mind put the finishing touches to\nthe tidying of the room--put the chairs straight, shut down the lid of\nthe oak chest, closed all the drawers of the desk.\n\n\"Nothing but good luck can save us now,\" whispered Blakeney as he\nlowered the wick of the lamp. \"Quick now,\" he added, \"behind that\ntapestry in the alcove and trust to our stars.\"\n\nSecurely hidden for the moment behind the curtains in the dark recess of\nthe alcove the two men waited. The door leading into the sitting-room\nwas ajar, and they could hear Heriot and his friends making merry\nirruption into the place. From out the confusion of general conversation\nthey soon gathered that the debates in the Chamber had been so dull and\nuninteresting that, at a given signal, the little party had decided to\nadjourn to Heriot's rooms for their habitual game of cards. They could\nalso hear Heriot calling to Rondeau to bring bottles and glasses, and\nvaguely they marvelled what Rondeau's attitude might be like at this\nmoment. Was he brazening out the situation, or was he sick with terror?\n\nSuddenly Heriot's voice came out more distinctly.\n\n\"Make yourselves at home, friends,\" he was saying; \"here are cards,\ndominoes, and wine. I must leave you to yourselves for ten minutes\nwhilst I write an important letter.\"\n\n\"All right, but don't be long,\" came in merry response.\n\n\"Not longer than I can help,\" rejoined Heriot. \"I want my revenge\nagainst Bompard, remember. He did fleece me last night.\"\n\n\"Hurry on, then,\" said one of the men. \"I'll play Desgas that return\ngame of dominoes until then.\"\n\n\"Ten minutes and I'll be back,\" concluded Heriot.\n\nHe pushed open the bedroom door. The light within was very dim. The two\nmen hidden behind the tapestry could hear him moving about the room\nmuttering curses to himself. Presently the light of the lamp was shifted\nfrom one end of the room to the other. Through the opening between the\ntwo curtains Blakeney could just see Heriot's back as he placed the lamp\nat a convenient angle upon his desk, divested himself of his overcoat\nand muffler, then sat down and drew pen and paper closer to him. He was\nleaning forward, his elbow resting upon the table, his fingers fidgeting\nwith his long, lank hair. He had closed the door when he entered, and\nfrom the other room now the voices of his friends sounded confused and\nmuffled. Now and then an exclamation: \"Double!\" \"Je ... tiens!\"\n\"Cinq-deux!\" an oath, a laugh, the click of glasses and bottles came out\nmore clearly; but the rest of the time these sounds were more like a\ndroning accompaniment to the scraping of Heriot's pen upon the paper\nwhen he finally began to write his letter.\n\nTwo minutes went by and then two more. The scratching of Heriot's pen\nbecame more rapid as he appeared to be more completely immersed in his\nwork. Behind the curtain the two men had been waiting: Blakeney ready to\nact, Ffoulkes equally ready to interpret the slightest signal from his\nchief.\n\nThe next minute Blakeney had stolen out of the alcove, and his two\nhands--so slender and elegant looking, and yet with a grip of steel--had\nfastened themselves upon Heriot's mouth, smothering within the space of\na second the cry that had been half-uttered. Ffoulkes was ready to\ncomplete the work of rendering the man helpless: one handkerchief made\nan efficient gag, another tied the ankles securely. Heriot's own\ncoat-sleeves supplied the handcuffs, and the blankets off the bed tied\naround his legs rendered him powerless to move. Then the two men lifted\nthis inert mass on to the bed and Ffoulkes whispered anxiously: \"Now,\nwhat next?\"\n\nHeriot's overcoat, hat, and muffler lay upon a chair. Sir Percy, placing\na warning finger upon his lips, quickly divested himself of his own\ncoat, slipped that of Heriot on, twisted the muffler round his neck,\nhunched up his shoulders, and murmuring: \"Now for a bit of luck!\" once\nmore lowered the light of the lamp and then went to the door.\n\n\"Rondeau!\" he called. \"Hey, Rondeau!\" And Sir Percy himself was\nsurprised at the marvellous way in which he had caught the very\ninflection of Heriot's voice.\n\n\"Hey, Rondeau!\" came from one of the players at the table, \"the\ncitizen-deputy is calling you!\"\n\nThey were all sitting round the table: two men intent upon their game of\ndominoes, the other two watching with equal intentness. Rondeau came\nshuffling out of the antichambre. His face, by the dim light of the oil\nlamp, looked jaundiced with fear.\n\n\"Rondeau, you fool, where are you?\" called Blakeney once again.\n\nThe next moment Rondeau had entered the room. No need for a signal or an\norder this time. Ffoulkes knew by instinct what his chief's bold scheme\nwould mean to them both if it succeeded. He retired into the darkest\ncorner of the room as Rondeau shuffled across to the writing-desk. It\nwas all done in a moment. In less time than it had taken to bind and gag\nHeriot, his henchman was laid out on the floor, his coat had been taken\noff him, and he was tied into a mummy-like bundle with Sir Andrew\nFfoulkes' elegant coat fastened securely round his arms and chest. It\nhad all been done in silence. The men in the next room were noisy and\nintent on their game; the slight scuffle, the quickly smothered cries\nhad remained unheeded.\n\n\"Now, what next?\" queried Sir Andrew Ffoulkes once more.\n\n\"The impudence of the d--- l, my good Ffoulkes,\" replied Blakeney in a\nwhisper, \"and may our stars not play us false. Now let me make you look\nas like Rondeau as possible--there! Slip on his coat--now your hair over\nyour forehead--your coat-collar up--your knees bent--that's better!\" he\nadded as he surveyed the transformation which a few deft strokes had\nmade in Sir Andrew Ffoulkes' appearance. \"Now all you have to do is to\nshuffle across the room--here's your prototype's handkerchief--of\ndubious cleanliness, it is true, but it will serve--blow your nose as\nyou cross the room, it will hide your face. They'll not heed you--keep\nin the shadows and God guard you--I'll follow in a moment or two ... but\ndon't wait for me.\"\n\nHe opened the door, and before Sir Andrew could protest his chief had\npushed him out into the room where the four men were still intent on\ntheir game. Through the open door Sir Percy now watched his friend who,\nkeeping well within the shadows, shuffled quietly across the room. The\nnext moment Sir Andrew was through and in the antichambre. Blakeney's\nacutely sensitive ears caught the sound of the opening of the outer\ndoor. He waited for a while, then he drew out of his pocket the bundle\nof letters which he had risked so much to obtain. There they were neatly\ndocketed and marked: \"The affairs of Arnould Fabrice.\"\n\nWell! if he got away to-night Agnes de Lucines would be happy and free\nfrom the importunities of that brute Heriot; after that he must persuade\nher and Fabrice to go to England and to freedom.\n\nFor the moment his own safety was terribly in jeopardy; one false\nmove--one look from those players round the table.... Bah! even then--!\n\nWith an inward laugh he pushed open the door once more and stepped into\nthe room. For the moment no one noticed him; the game was at its most\npalpitating stage; four shaggy heads met beneath the lamp and four pairs\nof eyes were gazing with rapt attention upon the intricate maze of the\ndominoes.\n\nBlakeney walked quietly across the room; he was just midway and on a\nlevel with the centre table when a voice was suddenly raised from that\ntense group beneath the lamp: \"Is it thou, friend Heriot?\"\n\nThen one of the men looked up and stared, and another did likewise and\nexclaimed: \"It is not Heriot!\"\n\nIn a moment all was confusion, but confusion was the very essence of\nthose hair-breadth escapes and desperate adventures which were as the\nbreath of his nostrils to the Scarlet Pimpernel. Before those four men\nhad had time to jump to their feet, or to realise that something was\nwrong with their friend Heriot, he had run across the room, his hand was\non the knob of the door--the door that led to the antichambre and to\nfreedom.\n\nBompard, Desgas, Jeanniot, Legros were at his heels, but he tore open\nthe door, bounded across the threshold, and slammed it to with such a\nvigorous bang that those on the other side were brought to a momentary\nhalt. That moment meant life and liberty to Blakeney; already he had\ncrossed the antichambre. Quite coolly and quietly now he took out the\nkey from the inner side of the main door and slipped it to the outside.\nThe next second--even as the four men rushed helter-skelter into the\nantichambre he was out on the landing and had turned the key in the\ndoor.\n\nHis prisoners were safely locked in--in Heriot's apartments--and Sir\nPercy Blakeney, calmly and without haste, was descending the stairs of\nthe house in the Rue Cocatrice.\n\nThe next morning Agnes de Lucines received, through an anonymous\nmessenger, the packet of letters which would so gravely have compromised\nArnould Fabrice. Though the weather was more inclement than ever, she\nran out into the streets, determined to seek out the old Public\nLetter-Writer and thank him for his mediation with the English milor,\nwho surely had done this noble action.\n\nBut the old scarecrow had disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nA FINE BIT OF WORK\n\n\nI\n\n\"Sh!... sh!... It's the Englishman. I'd know his footstep anywhere--\"\n\n\"God bless him!\" murmured petite maman fervently.\n\nPere Lenegre went to the door; he stepped cautiously and with that\nstealthy foot-tread which speaks in eloquent silence of daily, hourly\ndanger, of anguish and anxiety for lives that are dear.\n\nThe door was low and narrow--up on the fifth floor of one of the huge\ntenement houses in the Rue Jolivet in the Montmartre quarter of Paris. A\nnarrow stone passage led to it--pitch-dark at all times, but dirty, and\nevil-smelling when the concierge--a free citizen of the new\ndemocracy--took a week's holiday from his work in order to spend whole\nafternoons either at the wineshop round the corner, or on the Place du\nCarrousel to watch the guillotine getting rid of some twenty aristocrats\nan hour for the glorification of the will of the people.\n\nBut inside the small apartment everything was scrupulously neat and\nclean. Petite maman was such an excellent manager, and Rosette was busy\nall the day tidying and cleaning the poor little home, which Pere\nLenegre contrived to keep up for wife and daughter by working fourteen\nhours a day in the government saddlery.\n\nWhen Pere Lenegre opened the narrow door, the entire framework of it was\nfilled by the broad, magnificent figure of a man in heavy caped coat and\nhigh leather boots, with dainty frills of lace at throat and wrist, and\nelegant chapeau-bras held in the hand.\n\nPere Lenegre at sight of him, put a quick finger to his own quivering\nlips.\n\n\"Anything wrong, vieux papa?\" asked the newcomer lightly.\n\nThe other closed the door cautiously before he made reply. But petite\nmaman could not restrain her anxiety.\n\n\"My little Pierre, milor?\" she asked as she clasped her wrinkled hands\ntogether, and turned on the stranger her tear-dimmed restless eyes.\n\n\"Pierre is safe and well, little mother,\" he replied cheerily. \"We got\nhim out of Paris early this morning in a coal cart, carefully hidden\namong the sacks. When he emerged he was black but safe. I drove the cart\nmyself as far as Courbevoie, and there handed over your Pierre and those\nwhom we got out of Paris with him to those of my friends who were going\nstraight to England. There's nothing more to be afraid of, petite\nmaman,\" he added as he took the old woman's wrinkled hands in both his\nown; \"your son is now under the care of men who would die rather than\nsee him captured. So make your mind at ease, Pierre will be in England,\nsafe and well, within a week.\"\n\nPetite maman couldn't say anything just then because tears were choking\nher, but in her turn she clasped those two strong and slender hands--the\nhands of the brave Englishman who had just risked his life in order to\nsave Pierre from the guillotine--and she kissed them as fervently as she\nkissed the feet of the Madonna when she knelt before her shrine in\nprayer.\n\nPierre had been a footman in the household of unhappy Marie Antoinette.\nHis crime had been that he remained loyal to her in words as well as in\nthought. A hot-headed but nobly outspoken harangue on behalf of the\nunfortunate queen, delivered in a public place, had at once marked him\nout to the spies of the Terrorists as suspect of intrigue against the\nsafety of the Republic. He was denounced to the Committee of Public\nSafety, and his arrest and condemnation to the guillotine would have\ninevitably followed had not the gallant band of Englishmen, known as the\nLeague of the Scarlet Pimpernel, succeeded in effecting his escape.\n\nWhat wonder that petite maman could not speak for tears when she clasped\nthe hands of the noble leader of that splendid little band of heroes?\nWhat wonder that Pere Lenegre, when he heard that his son was safe\nmurmured a fervent: \"God bless you, milor, and your friends!\" and that\nRosette surreptitiously raised the fine caped coat to her lips, for\nPierre was her twin-brother, and she loved him very dearly.\n\nBut already Sir Percy Blakeney had, with one of his characteristic\ncheery words, dissipated the atmosphere of tearful emotion which\noppressed these kindly folk.\n\n\"Now, Papa Lenegre,\" he said lightly, \"tell me why you wore such a\nsolemn air when you let me in just now.\"\n\n\"Because, milor,\" replied the old man quietly, \"that d----d concierge,\nJean Baptiste, is a black-hearted traitor.\"\n\nSir Percy laughed, his merry, infectious laugh.\n\n\"You mean that while he has been pocketing bribes from me, he has\ndenounced me to the Committee.\"\n\nPere Lenegre nodded: \"I only heard it this morning,\" he said, \"from one\nor two threatening words the treacherous brute let fall. He knows that\nyou lodge in the Place des Trois Maries, and that you come here\nfrequently. I would have given my life to warn you then and there,\"\ncontinued the old man with touching earnestness, \"but I didn't know\nwhere to find you. All I knew was that you were looking after Pierre.\"\n\nEven while the man spoke there darted from beneath the Englishman's\nheavy lids a quick look like a flash of sudden and brilliant light out\nof the lazy depths of his merry blue eyes; it was one of those glances\nof pure delight and exultation which light up the eyes of the true\nsoldier when there is serious fighting to be done.\n\n\"La, man,\" he said gaily, \"there was no cause to worry. Pierre is safe,\nremember that! As for me,\" he added with that wonderful insouciance\nwhich caused him to risk his life a hundred times a day with a shrug of\nhis broad shoulders and a smile upon his lips; \"as for me, I'll look\nafter myself, never fear.\"\n\nHe paused awhile, then added gravely: \"So long as you are safe, my good\nLenegre, and petite maman, and Rosette.\"\n\nWhereupon the old man was silent, petite maman murmured a short prayer,\nand Rosette began to cry. The hero of a thousand gallant rescues had\nreceived his answer.\n\n\"You, too, are on the black list, Pere Lenegre?\" he asked quietly.\n\nThe old man nodded.\n\n\"How do you know?\" queried the Englishman.\n\n\"Through Jean Baptiste, milor.\"\n\n\"Still that demmed concierge,\" muttered Sir Percy.\n\n\"He frightened petite maman with it all this morning, saying that he\nknew my name was down on the Sectional Committee's list as a 'suspect.'\nThat's when he let fall a word or two about you, milor. He said it is\nknown that Pierre has escaped from justice, and that you helped him to\nit.\n\n\"I am sure that we shall get a domiciliary visit presently,\" continued\nPere Lenegre, after a slight pause. \"The gendarmes have not yet been,\nbut I fancy that already this morning early I saw one or two of the\nCommittee's spies hanging about the house, and when I went to the\nworkshop I was followed all the time.\"\n\nThe Englishman looked grave: \"And tell me,\" he said, \"have you got\nanything in this place that may prove compromising to any of you?\"\n\n\"No, milor. But, as Jean Baptiste said, the Sectional Committee know\nabout Pierre. It is because of my son that I am suspect.\"\n\nThe old man spoke quite quietly, very simply, like a philosopher who has\nlong ago learned to put behind him the fear of death. Nor did petite\nmaman cry or lament. Her thoughts were for the brave milor who had saved\nher boy; but her fears for her old man left her dry-eyed and dumb with\ngrief.\n\nThere was silence in the little room for one moment while the angel of\nsorrow and anguish hovered round these faithful and brave souls, then\nthe Englishman's cheery voice, so full of spirit and merriment, rang out\nonce more--he had risen to his full, towering height, and now placed a\nkindly hand on the old man's shoulder:\n\n\"It seems to me, my good Lenegre,\" he said, \"that you and I haven't many\nmoments to spare if we mean to cheat those devils by saving your neck.\nNow, petite maman,\" he added, turning to the old woman, \"are you going\nto be brave?\"\n\n\"I will do anything, milor,\" she replied quietly, \"to help my old man.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Sir Percy Blakeney in that optimistic, light-hearted\nyet supremely authoritative tone of which he held the secret, \"you and\nRosette remain here and wait for the gendarmes. When they come, say\nnothing; behave with absolute meekness, and let them search your place\nfrom end to end. If they ask you about your husband say that you believe\nhim to be at his workshop. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Quite clear, milor,\" replied petite maman.\n\n\"And you, Pere Lenegre,\" continued the Englishman, speaking now with\nslow and careful deliberation, \"listen very attentively to the\ninstructions I am going to give you, for on your implicit obedience to\nthem depends not only your own life but that of these two dear women. Go\nat once, now, to the Rue Ste. Anne, round the corner, the second house\non your right, which is numbered thirty-seven. The porte cochere stands\nopen, go boldly through, past the concierge's box, and up the stairs to\napartment number twelve, second floor. Here is the key of the\napartment,\" he added, producing one from his coat pocket and handing it\nover to the old man. \"The rooms are nominally occupied by a certain\nMaitre Turandot, maker of violins, and not even the concierge of the\nplace knows that the hunchbacked and snuffy violin-maker and the\nmeddlesome Scarlet Pimpernel, whom the Committee of Public Safety would\nso love to lay by the heels, are one and the same person. The apartment,\nthen, is mine; one of the many which I occupy in Paris at different\ntimes,\" he went on. \"Let yourself in quietly with this key, walk\nstraight across the first room to a wardrobe, which you will see in\nfront of you. Open it. It is hung full of shabby clothes; put these\naside, and you will notice that the panels at the back do not fit very\nclosely, as if the wardrobe was old or had been badly put together.\nInsert your fingers in the tiny aperture between the two middle panels.\nThese slide back easily: there is a recess immediately behind them. Get\nin there; pull the doors of the wardrobe together first, then slide the\nback panels into their place. You will be perfectly safe there, as the\nhouse is not under suspicion at present, and even if the revolutionary\nguard, under some meddle-some sergeant or other, chooses to pay it a\nsurprise visit, your hiding-place will be perfectly secure. Now is all\nthat quite understood?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, milor,\" replied Lenegre, even as he made ready to obey Sir\nPercy's orders, \"but what about you? You cannot get out of this house,\nmilor,\" he urged; \"it is watched, I tell you.\"\n\n\"La!\" broke in Blakeney, in his light-hearted way, \"and do you think I\ndidn't know that? I had to come and tell you about Pierre, and now I\nmust give those worthy gendarmes the slip somehow. I have my rooms\ndownstairs on the ground floor, as you know, and I must make certain\narrangements so that we can all get out of Paris comfortably this\nevening. The demmed place is no longer safe either for you, my good\nLenegre, or for petite maman and Rosette. But wherever I may be,\nmeanwhile, don't worry about me. As soon as the gendarmes have been and\ngone, I'll go over to the Rue Ste. Anne and let you know what\narrangements I've been able to make. So do as I tell you now, and in\nHeaven's name let me look after myself.\"\n\nWhereupon, with scant ceremony, he hustled the old man out of the room.\n\nPere Lenegre had contrived to kiss petite maman and Rosette before he\nwent. It was touching to see the perfect confidence with which these\nsimple-hearted folk obeyed the commands of milor. Had he not saved\nPierre in his wonderful, brave, resourceful way? Of a truth he would\nknow how to save Pere Lenegre also. But, nevertheless, anguish gripped\nthe women's hearts; anguish doubly keen since the saviour of Pierre was\nalso in danger now.\n\nWhen Pere Lenegre's shuffling footsteps had died away along the flagged\ncorridor, the stranger once more turned to the two women.\n\n\"And now, petite maman,\" he said cheerily, as he kissed the old woman on\nboth her furrowed cheeks, \"keep up a good heart, and say your prayers\nwith Rosette. Your old man and I will both have need of them.\"\n\nHe did not wait to say good-bye, and anon it was his firm footstep that\nechoed down the corridor. He went off singing a song, at the top of his\nvoice, for the whole house to hear, and for that traitor, Jean Baptiste,\nto come rushing out of his room marvelling at the impudence of the man,\nand cursing the Committee of Public Safety who were so slow in sending\nthe soldiers of the Republic to lay this impertinent Englishman by the\nheels.\n\n\nII\n\nA quarter of an hour later half dozen men of the Republican Guard, with\ncorporal and sergeant in command, were in the small apartment on the\nfifth floor of the tenement house in the Rue Jolivet. They had demanded\nan entry in the name of the Republic, had roughly hustled petite maman\nand Rosette, questioned them to Lenegre's whereabouts, and not satisfied\nwith the reply which they received, had turned the tidy little home\ntopsy-turvy, ransacked every cupboard, dislocated every bed, table or\nsofa which might presumably have afforded a hiding place for a man.\n\nSatisfied now that the \"suspect\" whom they were searching for was not on\nthe premises, the sergeant stationed four of his men with the corporal\noutside the door, and two within, and himself sitting down in the centre\nof the room ordered the two women to stand before him and to answer his\nquestions clearly on pain of being dragged away forthwith to the St.\nLazare house of detention.\n\nPetite maman smoothed out her apron, crossed her arms before her, and\nlooked the sergeant quite straight in the face. Rosette's eyes were full\nof tears, but she showed no signs of fear either, although her\nshoulder--where one of the gendarmes had seized it so roughly--was\nterribly painful.\n\n\"Your husband, citizeness,\" asked the sergeant peremptorily, \"where is\nhe?\"\n\n\"I am not sure, citizen,\" replied petite maman. \"At this hour he is\ngenerally at the government works in the Quai des Messageries.\"\n\n\"He is not there now,\" asserted the sergeant. \"We have knowledge that he\ndid not go back to his work since dinner-time.\"\n\nPetite maman was silent.\n\n\"Answer,\" ordered the sergeant.\n\n\"I cannot tell you more, citizen sergeant,\" she said firmly. \"I do not\nknow.\"\n\n\"You do yourself no good, woman, by this obstinacy,\" he continued\nroughly. \"My belief is that your husband is inside this house, hidden\naway somewhere. If necessary I can get orders to have every apartment\nsearched until he is found: but in that case it will go much harder with\nyou and with your daughter, and much harder too with your husband than\nif he gave us no trouble and followed us quietly.\"\n\nBut with sublime confidence in the man who had saved Pierre and who had\ngiven her explicit orders as to what she should do, petite maman, backed\nby Rosette, reiterated quietly:\n\n\"I cannot tell you more, citizen sergeant, I do not know.\"\n\n\"And what about the Englishman?\" queried the sergeant more roughly, \"the\nman they call the Scarlet Pimpernel, what do you know of him?\"\n\n\"Nothing, citizen,\" replied petite maman, \"what should we poor folk know\nof an English milor?\"\n\n\"You know at any rate this much, citizeness, that the English milor\nhelped your son Pierre to escape from justice.\"\n\n\"If that is so,\" said petite maman quietly, \"it cannot be wrong for a\nmother to pray to God to bless her son's preserver.\"\n\n\"It behooves every good citizen,\" retorted the sergeant firmly, \"to\ndenounce all traitors to the Republic.\"\n\n\"But since I know nothing about the Englishman, citizen sergeant--?\"\n\nAnd petite maman shrugged her thin shoulders as if the matter had ceased\nto interest her.\n\n\"Think again, citizeness,\" admonished the sergeant, \"it is your\nhusband's neck as well as your daughter's and your own that you are\nrisking by so much obstinacy.\"\n\nHe waited a moment or two as if willing to give the old woman time to\nspeak: then, when he saw that she kept her thin, quivering lips\nresolutely glued together he called his corporal to him.\n\n\"Go to the citizen Commissary of the Section,\" he commanded, \"and ask\nfor a general order to search every apartment in No. 24 Rue Jolivet.\nLeave two of our men posted on the first and third landings of this\nhouse and leave two outside this door. Be as quick as you can. You can\nbe back here with the order in half an hour, or perhaps the committee\nwill send me an extra squad; tell the citizen Commissary that this is a\nbig house, with many corridors. You can go.\"\n\nThe corporal saluted and went.\n\nPetite maman and Rosette the while were still standing quietly in the\nmiddle of the room, their arms folded underneath their aprons, their\nwide-open, anxious eyes fixed into space. Rosette's tears were falling\nslowly, one by one down her cheeks, but petite maman was dry-eyed. She\nwas thinking, and thinking as she had never had occasion to think\nbefore.\n\nShe was thinking of the brave and gallant Englishman who had saved\nPierre's life only yesterday. The sergeant, who sat there before her,\nhad asked for orders from the citizen Commissary to search this big\nhouse from attic to cellar. That is what made petite maman think and\nthink.\n\nThe brave Englishman was in this house at the present moment: the house\nwould be searched from attic to cellar and he would be found, taken, and\nbrought to the guillotine.\n\nThe man who yesterday had risked his life to save her boy was in\nimminent and deadly danger, and she--petite maman--could do nothing to\nsave him.\n\nEvery moment now she thought to hear milor's firm tread resounding on\nstairs or corridor, every moment she thought to hear snatches of an\nEnglish song, sung by a fresh and powerful voice, never after to-day to\nbe heard in gaiety again.\n\nThe old clock upon the shelf ticked away these seconds and minutes while\npetite maman thought and thought, while men set traps to catch a\nfellow-being in a deathly snare, and human carnivorous beasts lay\nlurking for their prey.\n\n\nIII\n\nAnother quarter of an hour went by. Petite maman and Rosette had hardly\nmoved. The shadows of evening were creeping into the narrow room,\nblurring the outlines of the pieces of furniture and wrapping all the\ncorners in gloom.\n\nThe sergeant had ordered Rosette to bring in a lamp. This she had done,\nplacing it upon the table so that the feeble light glinted upon the belt\nand buckles of the sergeant and upon the tricolour cockade which was\npinned to his hat. Petite maman had thought and thought until she could\nthink no more.\n\nAnon there was much commotion on the stairs; heavy footsteps were heard\nascending from below, then crossing the corridors on the various\nlandings. The silence which reigned otherwise in the house, and which\nhad fallen as usual on the squalid little street, void of traffic at\nthis hour, caused those footsteps to echo with ominous power.\n\nPetite maman felt her heart beating so vigorously that she could hardly\nbreathe. She pressed her wrinkled hands tightly against her bosom.\n\nThere were the quick words of command, alas! so familiar in France just\nnow, the cruel, peremptory words that invariably preceded an arrest,\npreliminaries to the dragging of some wretched--often wholly\nharmless--creature before a tribunal that knew neither pardon nor mercy.\n\nThe sergeant, who had become drowsy in the close atmosphere of the tiny\nroom, roused himself at the sound and jumped to his feet. The door was\nthrown open by the men stationed outside even before the authoritative\nwords, \"Open! in the name of the Republic!\" had echoed along the narrow\ncorridor.\n\nThe sergeant stood at attention and quickly lifted his hand to his\nforehead in salute. A fresh squad of some half-dozen men of the\nRepublican Guard stood in the doorway; they were under the command of an\nofficer of high rank, a rough, uncouth, almost bestial-looking creature,\nwith lank hair worn the fashionable length under his greasy\nchapeau-bras, and unkempt beard round an ill-washed and bloated face.\nBut he wore the tricolour sash and badge which proclaimed him one of the\nmilitary members of the Sectional Committee of Public Safety, and the\nsergeant, who had been so overbearing with the women just now, had\nassumed a very humble and even obsequious manner.\n\n\"You sent for a general order to the sectional Committee,\" said the\nnew-comer, turning abruptly to the sergeant after he had cast a quick,\nsearching glance round the room, hardly condescending to look on petite\nmaman and Rosette, whose very souls were now gazing out of their\nanguish-filled eyes.\n\n\"I did, citizen commandant,\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"I am not a commandant,\" said the other curtly. \"My name is Rouget,\nmember of the Convention and of the Committee of Public Safety. The\nsectional Committee to whom you sent for a general order of search\nthought that you had blundered somehow, so they sent me to put things\nright.\"\n\n\"I am not aware that I committed any blunder, citizen,\" stammered the\nsergeant dolefully. \"I could not take the responsibility of making a\ndomiciliary search all through the house. So I begged for fuller\norders.\"\n\n\"And wasted the Committee's time and mine by such nonsense,\" retorted\nRouget harshly. \"Every citizen of the Republic worthy of the name should\nknow how to act on his own initiative when the safety of the nation\ndemands it.\"\n\n\"I did not know--I did not dare--\" murmured the sergeant, obviously\ncowed by this reproof, which had been delivered in the rough,\noverbearing tones peculiar to these men who, one and all, had risen from\nthe gutter to places of importance and responsibility in the\nnewly-modelled State.\n\n\"Silence!\" commanded the other peremptorily. \"Don't waste any more of my\ntime with your lame excuses. You have failed in zeal and initiative.\nThat's enough. What else have you done? Have you got the man Lenegre?\"\n\n\"No, citizen. He is not in hiding here, and his wife and daughter will\nnot give us any information about him.\"\n\n\"That is their look-out,\" retorted Rouget with a harsh laugh. \"If they\ngive up Lenegre of their own free will the law will deal leniently with\nthem, and even perhaps with him. But if we have to search the house for\nhim, then it means the guillotine for the lot of them.\"\n\nHe had spoken these callous words without even looking on the two\nunfortunate women; nor did he ask them any further questions just then,\nbut continued speaking to the sergeant:\n\n\"And what about the Englishman? The sectional Committee sent down some\nspies this morning to be on the look-out for him on or about this house.\nHave you got him?\"\n\n\"Not yet, citizen. But--\"\n\n\"Ah ca, citizen sergeant,\" broke in the other brusquely, \"meseems that\nyour zeal has been even more at fault than I had supposed. Have you done\nanything at all, then, in the matter of Lenegre or the Englishman?\"\n\n\"I have told you, citizen,\" retorted the sergeant sullenly, \"that I\nbelieve Lenegre to be still in this house. At any rate, he had not gone\nout of it an hour ago--that's all I know. And I wanted to search the\nwhole of this house, as I am sure we should have found him in one of the\nother apartments. These people are all friends together, and will always\nhelp each other to evade justice. But the Englishman was no concern of\nmine. The spies of the Committee were ordered to watch for him, and when\nthey reported to me I was to proceed with the arrest. I was not set to\ndo any of the spying work. I am a soldier, and obey my orders when I get\nthem.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, you'd better obey them now, citizen sergeant,\" was\nRouget's dry comment on the other man's surly explanation, \"for you seem\nto have properly blundered from first to last, and will be hard put to\nit to redeem your character. The Republic, remember, has no use for\nfools.\"\n\nThe sergeant, after this covert threat, thought it best, apparently, to\nkeep his tongue, whilst Rouget continued, in the same aggressive,\nperemptory tone:\n\n\"Get on with your domiciliary visits at once. Take your own men with\nyou, and leave me the others. Begin on this floor, and leave your sentry\nat the front door outside. Now let me see your zeal atoning for your\npast slackness. Right turn! Quick march!\"\n\nThen it was that petite maman spoke out. She had thought and thought,\nand now she knew what she ought to do; she knew that that cruel, inhuman\nwretch would presently begin his tramp up and down corridors and stairs,\ndemanding admittance at every door, entering every apartment. She knew\nthat the man who had saved her Pierre's life was in hiding somewhere in\nthe house--that he would be found and dragged to the guillotine, for she\nknew that the whole governing body of this abominable Revolution was\ndetermined not to allow that hated Englishman to escape again.\n\nShe was old and feeble, small and thin--that's why everyone called her\npetite maman--but once she knew what she ought to do, then her spirit\noverpowered the weakness of her wizened body.\n\nNow she knew, and even while that arrogant member of an execrated\nmurdering Committee was giving final instructions to the sergeant,\npetite maman said, in a calm, piping voice:\n\n\"No need, citizen sergeant, to go and disturb all my friends and\nneighbours. I'll tell you where my husband is.\"\n\nIn a moment Rouget had swung round on his heel, a hideous gleam of\nsatisfaction spread over his grimy face, and he said, with an ugly\nsneer:\n\n\"So! you have thought better of it, have you? Well, out with it! You'd\nbetter be quick about it if you want to do yourselves any good.\"\n\n\"I have my daughter to think of,\" said petite maman in a feeble,\nquerulous way, \"and I won't have all my neighbours in this house made\nunhappy because of me. They have all been kind neighbours. Will you\npromise not to molest them and to clear the house of soldiers if I tell\nyou where Lenegre is?\"\n\n\"The Republic makes no promises,\" replied Rouget gruffly. \"Her citizens\nmust do their duty without hope of a reward. If they fail in it, they\nare punished. But privately I will tell you, woman, that if you save us\nthe troublesome and probably unprofitable task of searching this\nrabbit-warren through and through, it shall go very leniently with you\nand with your daughter, and perhaps--I won't promise, remember--perhaps\nwith your husband also.\"\n\n\"Very good, citizen,\" said petite maman calmly. \"I am ready.\"\n\n\"Ready for what?\" he demanded.\n\n\"To take you to where my husband is in hiding.\"\n\n\"Oho! He is not in the house, then?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Where is he, then?\"\n\n\"In the Rue Ste. Anne. I will take you there.\"\n\nRouget cast a quick, suspicious glance on the old woman, and exchanged\none of understanding with the sergeant.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said after a slight pause. \"But your daughter must come\nalong too. Sergeant,\" he added, \"I'll take three of your men with me; I\nhave half a dozen, but it's better to be on the safe side. Post your\nfellows round the outer door, and on my way to the Rue Ste. Anne I will\nleave word at the gendarmerie that a small reinforcement be sent on to\nyou at once. These can be here in five minutes; until then you are quite\nsafe.\"\n\nThen he added under his breath, so that the women should not hear: \"The\nEnglishman may still be in the house. In which case, hearing us depart,\nhe may think us all gone and try to give us the slip. You'll know what\nto do?\" he queried significantly.\n\n\"Of course, citizen,\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"Now, then, citizeness--hurry up.\"\n\nOnce more there was tramping of heavy feet on stone stairs and\ncorridors. A squad of soldiers of the Republican Guard, with two women\nin their midst, and followed by a member of the Committee of Public\nSafety, a sergeant, corporal and two or three more men, excited much\nanxious curiosity as they descended the steep flights of steps from the\nfifth floor.\n\nPale, frightened faces peeped shyly through the doorways at sound of the\nnoisy tramp from above, but quickly disappeared again at sight of the\ngrimy scarlet facings and tricolour cockades.\n\nThe sergeant and three soldiers remained stationed at the foot of the\nstairs inside the house. Then citizen Rouget roughly gave the order to\nproceed. It seemed strange that it should require close on a dozen men\nto guard two women and to apprehend one old man, but as the member of\nthe Committee of Public Safety whispered to the sergeant before he\nfinally went out of the house: \"The whole thing may be a trap, and one\ncan't be too careful. The Englishman is said to be very powerful; I'll\nget the gendarmerie to send you another half-dozen men, and mind you\nguard the house until my return.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nFive minutes later the soldiers, directed by petite maman, had reached\nNo. 37 Rue Ste. Anne. The big outside door stood wide open, and the\nwhole party turned immediately into the house.\n\nThe concierge, terrified and obsequious, rushed--trembling--out of his\nbox.\n\n\"What was the pleasure of the citizen soldiers?\" he asked.\n\n\"Tell him, citizeness,\" commanded Rouget curtly.\n\n\"We are going to apartment No. 12 on the second floor,\" said petite\nmaman to the concierge.\n\n\"Have you a key of the apartment?\" queried Rouget.\n\n\"No, citizen,\" stammered the concierge, \"but--\"\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" queried the other peremptorily.\n\n\"Papa Turandot is a poor, harmless maker of volins,\" said the concierge.\n\"I know him well, though he is not often at home. He lives with a\ndaughter somewhere Passy way, and only uses this place as a workshop. I\nam sure he is no traitor.\"\n\n\"We'll soon see about that,\" remarked Rouget dryly.\n\nPetite maman held her shawl tightly crossed over her bosom: her hands\nfelt clammy and cold as ice. She was looking straight out before her,\nquite dry-eyed and calm, and never once glanced on Rosette, who was not\nallowed to come anywhere near her mother.\n\nAs there was no duplicate key to apartment No. 12, citizen Rouget\nordered his men to break in the door. It did not take very long: the\nhouse was old and ramshackle and the doors rickety. The next moment the\nparty stood in the room which a while ago the Englishman had so\naccurately described to pere Lenegre in petite maman's hearing.\n\nThere was the wardrobe. Petite maman, closely surrounded by the\nsoldiers, went boldly up to it; she opened it just as milor had\ndirected, and pushed aside the row of shabby clothes that hung there.\nThen she pointed to the panels that did not fit quite tightly together\nat the back. Petite maman passed her tongue over her dry lips before she\nspoke.\n\n\"There's a recess behind those panels,\" she said at last. \"They slide\nback quite easily. My old man is there.\"\n\n\"And God bless you for a brave, loyal soul,\" came in merry, ringing\naccent from the other end of the room. \"And God save the Scarlet\nPimpernel!\"\n\nThese last words, spoken in English, completed the blank amazement which\nliterally paralysed the only three genuine Republican soldiers\nthere--those, namely, whom Rouget had borrowed from the sergeant. As for\nthe others, they knew what to do. In less than a minute they had\noverpowered and gagged the three bewildered soldiers.\n\nRosette had screamed, terror-stricken, from sheer astonishment, but\npetite maman stood quite still, her pale, tear-dimmed eyes fixed upon\nthe man whose gay \"God bless you!\" had so suddenly turned her despair\ninto hope.\n\nHow was it that in the hideous, unkempt and grimy Rouget she had not at\nonce recognised the handsome and gallant milor who had saved her\nPierre's life? Well, of a truth he had been unrecognisable, but now that\nhe tore the ugly wig and beard from his face, stretched out his fine\nfigure to its full height, and presently turned his lazy, merry eyes on\nher, she could have screamed for very joy.\n\nThe next moment he had her by the shoulders and had imprinted two\nsounding kisses upon her cheeks.\n\n\"Now, petite maman,\" he said gaily, \"let us liberate the old man.\"\n\nPere Lenegre, from his hiding-place, had heard all that had been going\non in the room for the last few moments. True, he had known exactly what\nto expect, for no sooner had he taken possession of the recess behind\nthe wardrobe than milor also entered the apartment and then and there\ntold him of his plans not only for pere's own safety, but for that of\npetite maman and Rosette who would be in grave danger if the old man\nfollowed in the wake of Pierre.\n\nMilor told him in his usual light-hearted way that he had given the\nCommittee's spies the slip.\n\n\"I do that very easily, you know,\" he explained. \"I just slip into my\nrooms in the Rue Jolivet, change myself into a snuffy and hunchback\nviolin-maker, and walk out of the house under the noses of the spies. In\nthe nearest wine-shop my English friends, in various disguises, are all\nready to my hand: half a dozen of them are never far from where I am in\ncase they may be wanted.\"\n\nThese half-dozen brave Englishmen soon arrived one by one: one looked\nlike a coal-heaver, another like a seedy musician, a third like a\ncoach-driver. But they all walked boldly into the house and were soon\nall congregated in apartment No. 12. Here fresh disguises were assumed,\nand soon a squad of Republican Guards looked as like the real thing as\npossible.\n\nPere Lenegre admitted himself that though he actually saw milor\ntransforming himself into citizen Rouget, he could hardly believe his\neyes, so complete was the change.\n\n\"I am deeply grieved to have frightened and upset you so, petite maman,\"\nnow concluded milor kindly, \"but I saw no other way of getting you and\nRosette out of the house and leaving that stupid sergeant and some of\nhis men behind. I did not want to arouse in him even the faintest breath\nof suspicion, and of course if he had asked me for the written orders\nwhich he was actually waiting for, or if his corporal had returned\nsooner than I anticipated, there might have been trouble. But even\nthen,\" he added with his usual careless insouciance, \"I should have\nthought of some way of baffling those brutes.\"\n\n\"And now,\" he concluded more authoritatively, \"it is a case of getting\nout of Paris before the gates close. Pere Lenegre, take your wife and\ndaughter with you and walk boldly out of this house. The sergeant and\nhis men have not vacated their post in the Rue Jolivet, and no one else\ncan molest you. Go straight to the Porte de Neuilly, and on the other\nside wait quietly in the little cafe at the corner of the Avenue until I\ncome. Your old passes for the barriers still hold good; you were only\nplaced on the 'suspect' list this morning, and there has not been a hue\nand cry yet about you. In any case some of us will be close by to help\nyou if needs be.\"\n\n\"But you, milor,\" stammered pere Lenegre, \"and your friends--?\"\n\n\"La, man,\" retorted Blakeney lightly, \"have I not told you before never\nto worry about me and my friends? We have more ways than one of giving\nthe slip to this demmed government of yours. All you've got to think of\nis your wife and your daughter. I am afraid that petite maman cannot\ntake more with her than she has on, but we'll do all we can for her\ncomfort until we have you all in perfect safety--in England--with\nPierre.\"\n\nNeither pere Lenegre, nor petite maman, nor Rosette could speak just\nthen, for tears were choking them, but anon when milor stood nearer,\npetite maman knelt down, and, imprisoning his slender hand in her brown,\nwrinkled ones, she kissed it reverently.\n\nHe laughed and chided her for this.\n\n\"'Tis I should kneel to you in gratitude, petite maman,\" he said\nearnestly, \"you were ready to sacrifice your old man for me.\"\n\n\"You have saved Pierre, milor,\" said the mother simply.\n\nA minute later pere Lenegre and the two women were ready to go. Already\nmilor and his gallant English friends were busy once more transforming\nthemselves into grimy workmen or seedy middle-class professionals.\n\nAs soon as the door of apartment No. 12 finally closed behind the three\ngood folk, my lord Tony asked of his chief:\n\n\"What about these three wretched soldiers, Blakeney?\"\n\n\"Oh! they'll be all right for twenty-four hours. They can't starve till\nthen, and by that time the concierge will have realised that there's\nsomething wrong with the door of No. 12 and will come in to investigate\nthe matter. Are they securely bound, though?\"\n\n\"And gagged! Rather!\" ejaculated one of the others. \"Odds life,\nBlakeney!\" he added enthusiastically, \"that was a fine bit of work!\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nHOW JEAN PIERRE MET THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL\n\nAs told by Himself\n\n\nI\n\nAh, monsieur! the pity of it, the pity! Surely there are sins which le\nbon Dieu Himself will condone. And if not--well, I had to risk His\ndispleasure anyhow. Could I see them both starve, monsieur? I ask you!\nand M. le Vicomte had become so thin, so thin, his tiny, delicate bones\nwere almost through his skin. And Mme. la Marquise! an angel, monsieur!\nWhy, in the happy olden days, before all these traitors and assassins\nruled in France, M. and Mme. la Marquise lived only for the child, and\nthen to see him dying--yes, dying, there was no shutting one's eyes to\nthat awful fact--M. le Vicomte de Mortain was dying of starvation and of\ndisease.\n\nThere we were all herded together in a couple of attics--one of which\nlittle more than a cupboard--at the top of a dilapidated half-ruined\nhouse in the Rue des Pipots--Mme. la Marquise, M. le Vicomte and I--just\nthink of that, monsieur! M. le Marquis had his chateau, as no doubt you\nknow, on the outskirts of Lyons. A loyal high-born gentleman; was it\nlikely, I ask you, that he would submit passively to the rule of those\nexecrable revolutionaries who had murdered their King, outraged their\nQueen and Royal family, and, God help them! had already perpetrated\nevery crime and every abomination for which of a truth there could be no\npardon either on earth or in Heaven? He joined that plucky but, alas!\nsmall and ill-equipped army of royalists who, unable to save their King,\nwere at least determined to avenge him.\n\nWell, you know well enough what happened. The counter-revolution failed;\nthe revolutionary army brought Lyons down to her knees after a siege of\ntwo months. She was then marked down as a rebel city, and after the\nabominable decree of October 9th had deprived her of her very name, and\nCouthon had exacted bloody reprisals from the entire population for its\nloyalty to the King, the infamous Laporte was sent down in order finally\nto stamp out the lingering remnants of the rebellion. By that time,\nmonsieur, half the city had been burned down, and one-tenth and more of\nthe inhabitants--men, women, and children--had been massacred in cold\nblood, whilst most of the others had fled in terror from the appalling\nscene of ruin and desolation. Laporte completed the execrable work so\nably begun by Couthon. He was a very celebrated and skilful doctor at\nthe Faculty of Medicine, now turned into a human hyena in the name of\nLiberty and Fraternity.\n\nM. le Marquis contrived to escape with the scattered remnant of the\nRoyalist army into Switzerland. But Mme la Marquise throughout all these\nstrenuous times had stuck to her post at the chateau like the valiant\ncreature that she was. When Couthon entered Lyons at the head of the\nrevolutionary army, the whole of her household fled, and I was left\nalone to look after her and M. le Vicomte.\n\nThen one day when I had gone into Lyons for provisions, I suddenly\nchanced to hear outside an eating-house that which nearly froze the\nmarrow in my old bones. A captain belonging to the Revolutionary Guard\nwas transmitting to his sergeant certain orders, which he had apparently\njust received.\n\nThe orders were to make a perquisition at ten o'clock this same evening\nin the chateau of Mortaine as the Marquis was supposed to be in hiding\nthere, and in any event to arrest every man, woman, and child who was\nfound within its walls.\n\n\"Citizen Laporte,\" the captain concluded, \"knows for a certainty that\nthe ci-devant Marquise and her brat are still there, even if the Marquis\nhas fled like the traitor that he is. Those cursed English spies who\ncall themselves the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel have been very\nactive in Lyons of late, and citizen Laporte is afraid that they might\ncheat the guillotine of the carcase of those aristos, as they have\nalready succeeded in doing in the case of a large number of traitors.\"\n\nI did not, of course, wait to hear any more of that abominable talk. I\nsped home as fast as my old legs would carry me. That self-same evening,\nas soon as it was dark, Mme. la Marquise, carrying M. le Vicomte in her\narms and I carrying a pack with a few necessaries on my back, left the\nancestral home of the Mortaines never to return to it again: for within\nan hour of our flight a detachment of the revolutionary army made a\ndescent upon the chateau; they ransacked it from attic to cellar, and\nfinding nothing there to satisfy their lust of hate, they burned the\nstately mansion down to the ground.\n\nWe were obliged to take refuge in Lyons, at any rate for a time. Great\nas was the danger inside the city, it was infinitely greater on the high\nroads, unless we could arrange for some vehicle to take us a\nconsiderable part of the way to the frontier, and above all for some\nsort of passports--forged or otherwise--to enable us to pass the various\ntoll-gates on the road, where vigilance was very strict. So we wandered\nthrough the ruined and deserted streets of the city in search of\nshelter, but found every charred and derelict house full of miserable\ntramps and destitutes like ourselves. Half dead with fatigue, Mme. la\nMarquise was at last obliged to take refuge in one of these houses which\nwas situated in the Rue des Pipots. Every room was full to overflowing\nwith a miserable wreckage of humanity thrown hither by the tide of\nanarchy and of bloodshed. But at the top of the house we found an attic.\nIt was empty save for a couple of chairs, a table and a broken-down\nbedstead on which were a ragged mattress and pillow.\n\nHere, monsieur, we spent over three weeks, at the end of which time M.\nle Vicomte fell ill, and then there followed days, monsieur, through\nwhich I would not like my worst enemy to pass.\n\nMme. la Marquise had only been able to carry away in her flight what\nready money she happened to have in the house at the time. Securities,\nproperty, money belonging to aristocrats had been ruthlessly confiscated\nby the revolutionary government in Lyons. Our scanty resources rapidly\nbecame exhausted, and what was left had to be kept for milk and\ndelicacies for M. le Vicomte. I tramped through the streets in search of\na doctor, but most of them had been arrested on some paltry charge or\nother of rebellion, whilst others had fled from the city. There was only\nthat infamous Laporte--a vastly clever doctor, I knew--but as soon take\na lamb to a hungry lion as the Vicomte de Mortaine to that bloodthirsty\ncut-throat.\n\nThen one day our last franc went and we had nothing left. Mme. la\nMarquise had not touched food for two days. I had stood at the corner of\nthe street, begging all the day until I was driven off by the gendarmes.\nI had only obtained three sous from the passers-by. I bought some milk\nand took it home for M. le Vicomte. The following morning when I entered\nthe larger attic I found that Mme. la Marquise had fainted from\ninanition.\n\nI spent the whole of the day begging in the streets and dodging the\nguard, and even so I only collected four sous. I could have got more\nperhaps, only that at about midday the smell of food from an\neating-house turned me sick and faint, and when I regained consciousness\nI found myself huddled up under a doorway and evening gathering in fast\naround me. If Mme. la Marquise could go two days without food I ought to\ngo four. I struggled to my feet; fortunately I had retained possession\nof my four sous, else of a truth I would not have had the courage to go\nback to the miserable attic which was the only home I knew.\n\nI was wending my way along as fast as I could--for I knew that Mme. la\nMarquise would be getting terribly anxious--when, just as I turned into\nthe Rue Blanche, I spied two gentlemen--obviously strangers, for they\nwere dressed with a luxury and care with which we had long ceased to be\nfamiliar in Lyons--walking rapidly towards me. A moment or two later\nthey came to a halt, not far from where I was standing, and I heard the\ntaller one of the two say to the other in English--a language with which\nI am vaguely conversant: \"All right again this time, what, Tony?\"\n\nBoth laughed merrily like a couple of schoolboys playing truant, and\nthen they disappeared under the doorway of a dilapidated house, whilst I\nwas left wondering how two such elegant gentlemen dared be abroad in\nLyons these days, seeing that every man, woman and child who was dressed\nin anything but threadbare clothes was sure to be insulted in the\nstreets for an aristocrat, and as often as not summarily arrested as a\ntraitor.\n\nHowever, I had other things to think about, and had already dismissed\nthe little incident from my mind, when at the bottom of the Rue Blanche\nI came upon a knot of gaffers, men and women, who were talking and\ngesticulating very excitedly outside the door of a cook-shop. At first I\ndid not take much notice of what was said: my eyes were glued to the\nfront of the shop, on which were displayed sundry delicacies of the kind\nwhich makes a wretched, starved beggar's mouth water as he goes by; a\nroast capon especially attracted my attention, together with a bottle of\nred wine; these looked just the sort of luscious food which Mme. la\nMarquise would relish.\n\nWell, sir, the law of God says: \"Thou shalt not covet!\" and no doubt\nthat I committed a grievous sin when my hungry eyes fastened upon that\nroast capon and that bottle of Burgundy. We also know the stories of\nJudas Iscariot and of Jacob's children who sold their own brother Joseph\ninto slavery--such a crime, monsieur, I took upon my conscience then;\nfor just as the vision of Mme. la Marquise eating that roast capon and\ndrinking that Burgundy rose before my eyes, my ears caught some\nfragments of the excited conversation which was going on all around me.\n\n\"He went this way!\" someone said.\n\n\"No; that!\" protested another.\n\n\"There's no sign of him now, anyway.\"\n\nThe owner of the shop was standing on his own doorstep, his legs wide\napart, one arm on his wide hip, the other still brandishing the knife\nwherewith he had been carving for his customers.\n\n\"He can't have gone far,\" he said, as he smacked his thick lips.\n\n\"The impudent rascal, flaunting such fine clothes--like the aristo that\nhe is.\"\n\n\"Bah! these cursed English! They are aristos all of them! And this one\nwith his followers is no better than a spy!\"\n\n\"Paid by that damned English Government to murder all our patriots and\nto rob the guillotine of her just dues.\"\n\n\"They say he had a hand in the escape of the ci-devant Duc de Sermeuse\nand all his brats from the very tumbril which was taking them to\nexecution.\"\n\nA cry of loathing and execration followed this statement. There was\nvigorous shaking of clenched fists and then a groan of baffled rage.\n\n\"We almost had him this time. If it had not been for these confounded,\nill-lighted streets--\"\n\n\"I would give something,\" concluded the shopkeeper, \"if we could lay him\nby the heels.\"\n\n\"What would you give, citizen Dompierre?\" queried a woman in the crowd,\nwith a ribald laugh, \"one of your roast capons?\"\n\n\"Aye, little mother,\" he replied jovially, \"and a bottle of my best\nBurgundy to boot, to drink confusion to that meddlesome Englishman and\nhis crowd and a speedy promenade up the steps of the guillotine.\"\n\nMonsieur, I assure you that at that moment my heart absolutely stood\nstill. The tempter stood at my elbow and whispered, and I deliberately\nsmothered the call of my conscience. I did what Joseph's brethren did,\nwhat brought Judas Iscariot to hopeless remorse. There was no doubt that\nthe hue and cry was after the two elegantly dressed gentlemen whom I had\nseen enter the dilapidated house in the Rue Blanche. For a second or two\nI closed my eyes and deliberately conjured up the vision of Mme. la\nMarquise fainting for lack of food, and of M. le Vicomte dying for want\nof sustenance; then I worked my way to the door of the shop and accosted\nthe burly proprietor with as much boldness as I could muster.\n\n\"The two Englishmen passed by me at the top of the Rue Blanche,\" I said\nto him. \"They went into a house ... I can show you which it is---\"\n\nIn a moment I was surrounded by a screeching, gesticulating crowd. I\ntold my story as best I could; there was no turning back now from the\npath of cowardice and of crime. I saw that brute Dompierre pick up the\nlargest roast capon from the front of his shop, together with a bottle\nof that wine which I had coveted; then he thrust both these treasures\ninto my trembling hands and said:\n\n\"En avant!\"\n\nAnd we all started to run up the street, shouting: \"Death to the English\nspies!\" I was the hero of the expedition. Dompierre and another man\ncarried me, for I was too weak to go as fast as they wished. I was\nhugging the capon and the bottle of wine to my heart; I had need to do\nthat, so as to still the insistent call of my conscience, for I felt a\ncoward--a mean, treacherous, abominable coward!\n\nWhen we reached the house and I pointed it out to Dompierre, the crowd\nbehind us gave a cry of triumph. In the topmost storey a window was\nthrown open, two heads appeared silhouetted against the light within,\nand the cry of triumph below was answered by a merry, prolonged laugh\nfrom above.\n\nI was too dazed to realise very clearly what happened after that.\nDompierre, I know, kicked open the door of the house, and the crowd\nrushed in, in his wake. I managed to keep my feet and to work my way\ngradually out of the crowd. I must have gone on mechanically, almost\nunconsciously, for the next thing that I remember with any distinctness\nwas that I found myself once more speeding down the Rue Blanche, with\nall the yelling and shouting some little way behind me.\n\nWith blind instinct, too, I had clung to the capon and the wine, the\nprice of my infamy. I was terribly weak and felt sick and faint, but I\nstruggled on for a while, until my knees refused me service and I came\ndown on my two hands, whilst the capon rolled away into the gutter, and\nthe bottle of Burgundy fell with a crash against the pavement,\nscattering its precious contents in every direction.\n\nThere I lay, wretched, despairing, hardly able to move, when suddenly I\nheard rapid and firm footsteps immediately behind me, and the next\nmoment two firm hands had me under the arms, and I heard a voice saying:\n\n\"Steady, old friend. Can you get up? There! Is that better?\"\n\nThe same firm hands raised me to my feet. At first I was too dazed to\nsee anything, but after a moment or two I was able to look around me,\nand, by the light of a street lanthorn immediately overhead, I\nrecognised the tall, elegantly dressed Englishman and his friend, whom I\nhad just betrayed to the fury of Dompierre and a savage mob.\n\nI thought that I was dreaming, and I suppose that my eyes betrayed the\nhorror which I felt, for the stranger looked at me scrutinisingly for a\nmoment or two, then he gave the quaintest laugh I had ever heard in all\nmy life, and said something to his friend in English, which this time I\nfailed to understand.\n\nThen he turned to me:\n\n\"By my faith,\" he said in perfect French--so that I began to doubt if he\nwas an English spy after all--\"I verily believe that you are the clever\nrogue, eh? who obtained a roast capon and a bottle of wine from that\nfool Dompierre. He and his boon companions are venting their wrath on\nyou, old compeer; they are calling you liar and traitor and cheat, in\nthe intervals of wrecking what is left of the house, out of which my\nfriend and I have long since escaped by climbing up the neighbouring\ngutter-pipes and scrambling over the adjoining roofs.\"\n\nMonsieur, will you believe me when I say that he was actually saying all\nthis in order to comfort me? I could have sworn to that because of the\nwonderful kindliness which shone out of his eyes, even through the\ngood-humoured mockery wherewith he obviously regarded me. Do you know\nwhat I did then, monsieur? I just fell on my knees and loudly thanked\nGod that he was safe; at which both he and his friend once again began\nto laugh, for all the world like two schoolboys who had escaped a\nwhipping, rather than two men who were still threatened with death.\n\n\"Then it WAS you!\" said the taller stranger, who was still laughing so\nheartily that he had to wipe his eyes with his exquisite lace\nhandkerchief.\n\n\"May God forgive me,\" I replied.\n\nThe next moment his arm was again round me. I clung to him as to a rock,\nfor of a truth I had never felt a grasp so steady and withal so gentle\nand kindly, as was his around my shoulders. I tried to murmur words of\nthanks, but again that wretched feeling of sickness and faintness\novercame me, and for a second or two it seemed to me as if I were\nslipping into another world. The stranger's voice came to my ear, as it\nwere through cotton-wool.\n\n\"The man is starving,\" he said. \"Shall we take him over to your\nlodgings, Tony? They are safer than mine. He may be able to walk in a\nminute or two, if not I can carry him.\"\n\nMy senses at this partly returned to me, and I was able to protest\nfeebly:\n\n\"No, no! I must go back--I must--kind sirs,\" I murmured. \"Mme. la\nMarquise will be getting so anxious.\"\n\nNo sooner were these foolish words out of my mouth than I could have\nbitten my tongue out for having uttered them; and yet, somehow, it\nseemed as if it was the stranger's magnetic personality, his magic voice\nand kindly act towards me, who had so basely sold him to his enemies,\nwhich had drawn them out of me. He gave a low, prolonged whistle.\n\n\"Mme. la Marquise?\" he queried, dropping his voice to a whisper.\n\nNow to have uttered Mme. la Marquise de Mortaine's name here in Lyons,\nwhere every aristocrat was termed a traitor and sent without trial to\nthe guillotine, was in itself an act of criminal folly, and yet--you may\nbelieve me, monsieur, or not--there was something within me just at that\nmoment that literally compelled me to open my heart out to this\nstranger, whom I had so basely betrayed, and who requited my abominable\ncrime with such gentleness and mercy. Before I fully realised what I was\ndoing, monsieur, I had blurted out the whole history of Mme. la\nMarquise's flight and of M. le Vicomte's sickness to him. He drew me\nunder the cover of an open doorway, and he and his friend listened to me\nwithout speaking a word until I had told them my pitiable tale to the\nend.\n\nWhen I had finished he said quietly:\n\n\"Take me to see Mme. la Marquise, old friend. Who knows? perhaps I may\nbe able to help.\"\n\nThen he turned to his friend.\n\n\"Will you wait for me at my lodgings, Tony,\" he said, \"and let Ffoulkes\nand Hastings know that I may wish to speak with them on my return?\"\n\nHe spoke like one who had been accustomed all his life to give command,\nand I marvelled how his friend immediately obeyed him. Then when the\nlatter had disappeared down the dark street, the stranger once more\nturned to me.\n\n\"Lean on my arm, good old friend,\" he said, \"and we must try and walk as\nquickly as we can. The sooner we allay the anxieties of Mme. la Marquise\nthe better.\"\n\nI was still hugging the roast capon with one arm, with the other I clung\nto him as together we walked in the direction of the Rue des Pipots. On\nthe way we halted at a respectable eating-house, where my protector gave\nme some money wherewith to buy a bottle of good wine and sundry\nprovisions and delicacies which we carried home with us.\n\n\nII\n\nNever shall I forget the look of horror which came in Mme. la Marquise's\neyes when she saw me entering our miserable attic in the company of a\nstranger. The last of the little bit of tallow candle flickered in its\nsocket. Madame threw her emaciated arms over her child, just like some\npoor hunted animal defending its young. I could almost hear the cry of\nterror which died down in her throat ere it reached her lips. But then,\nmonsieur, to see the light of hope gradually illuminating her pale, wan\nface as the stranger took her hand and spoke to her--oh! so gently and\nso kindly--was a sight which filled my poor, half-broken heart with joy.\n\n\"The little invalid must be seen by a doctor at once,\" he said, \"after\nthat only can we think of your ultimate safety.\"\n\nMme. la Marquise, who herself was terribly weak and ill, burst out\ncrying. \"Would I not have taken him to a doctor ere now?\" she murmured\nthrough her tears. \"But there is no doctor in Lyons. Those who have not\nbeen arrested as traitors have fled from this stricken city. And my\nlittle Jose is dying for want of medical care.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, madame,\" he rejoined gently, \"one of the ablest doctors in\nFrance is at present in Lyons---\"\n\n\"That infamous Laporte,\" she broke in, horrified. \"He would snatch my\nsick child from my arms and throw him to the guillotine.\"\n\n\"He would save your boy from disease,\" said the stranger earnestly, \"his\nown professional pride or professional honour, whatever he might choose\nto call it, would compel him to do that. But the moment the doctor's\nwork was done, that of the executioner would commence.\"\n\n\"You see, milor,\" moaned Madame in pitiable agony, \"that there is no\nhope for us.\"\n\n\"Indeed there is,\" he replied. \"We must get M. le Vicomte well\nfirst--after that we shall see.\"\n\n\"But you are not proposing to bring that infamous Laporte to my child's\nbedside!\" she cried in horror.\n\n\"Would you have your child die here before your eyes,\" retorted the\nstranger, \"as he undoubtedly will this night?\"\n\nThis sounded horribly cruel, and the tone in which it was said was\ncommanding. There was no denying its truth. M. le Vicomte was dying. I\ncould see that. For a moment or two madame remained quite still, with\nher great eyes, circled with pain and sorrow, fixed upon the stranger.\nHe returned her gaze steadily and kindly, and gradually that frozen look\nof horror in her pale face gave place to one of deep puzzlement, and\nthrough her bloodless lips there came the words, faintly murmured: \"Who\nare you?\"\n\nHe gave no direct reply, but from his little finger he detached a ring\nand held it out for her to see. I saw it too, for I was standing close\nby Mme. la Marquise, and the flickering light of the tallow candle fell\nfull upon the ring. It was of gold, and upon it there was an exquisitely\nmodelled, five-petalled little flower in vivid red enamel.\n\nMadame la Marquise looked at the ring, then once again up into his face.\nHe nodded assent, and my heart seemed even then to stop its beating as I\ngazed upon his face. Had we not--all of us--heard of the gallant Scarlet\nPimpernel? And did I not know--far better than Mme. la Marquise\nherself--the full extent of his gallantry and his self-sacrifice? The\nhue and cry was after him. Human bloodhounds were even now on his track,\nand he spoke calmly of walking out again in the streets of Lyons and of\naffronting that infamous Laporte, who would find glory in sending him to\ndeath. I think he guessed what was passing in my mind, for he put a\nfinger up to his lip and pointed significantly to M. le Vicomte.\n\nBut it was beautiful to see how completely Mme. la Marquise now trusted\nhim. At his bidding she even ate a little of the food and drank some\nwine--and I was forced to do likewise. And even when anon he declared\nhis intention of fetching Laporte immediately, she did not flinch. She\nkissed M. le Vicomte with passionate fervour, and then gave the stranger\nher solemn promise that the moment he returned she would take refuge in\nthe next room and never move out of it until after Laporte had departed.\n\nWhen he went I followed him to the top of the stairs. I was speechless\nwith gratitude and also with fears for him. But he took my hand and\nsaid, with that same quaint, somewhat inane laugh which was so\ncharacteristic of him:\n\n\"Be of good cheer, old fellow! Those confounded murderers will not get\nme this time.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nLess than half an hour later, monsieur, citizen Laporte, one of the most\nskilful doctors in France and one of the most bloodthirsty tyrants this\nexecrable Revolution has known, was sitting at the bedside of M. le\nVicomte de Mortaine, using all the skill, all the knowledge he possessed\nin order to combat the dread disease of which the child was dying, ere\nhe came to save him--as he cynically remarked in my hearing--for the\nguillotine.\n\nI heard afterwards how it all came about.\n\nLaporte, it seems, was in the habit of seeing patients in his own house\nevery evening after he had settled all his business for the day. What a\nstrange contradiction in the human heart, eh, monsieur? The tiger turned\nlamb for the space of one hour in every twenty-four--the butcher turned\nhealer. How well the English milor had gauged the strange personality of\nthat redoubtable man! Professional pride--interest in intricate\ncases--call it what you will--was the only redeeming feature in\nLaporte's abominable character. Everything else in him, every thought,\nevery action was ignoble, cruel and vengeful.\n\nMilor that night mingled with the crowd who waited on the human hyena to\nbe cured of their hurts. It was a motley crowd that filled the dreaded\npro-consul's ante-chamber--men, women and children--all of them too much\npreoccupied with their own troubles to bestow more than a cursory glance\non the stranger who, wrapped in a dark mantle, quietly awaited his turn.\nOne or two muttered curses were flung at the aristo, one or two spat in\nhis direction to express hatred and contempt, then the door which gave\non the inner chamber would be flung open--a number called--one patient\nwould walk out, another walk in--and in the ever-recurring incident the\nstranger for the nonce was forgotten.\n\nHis turn came--his number being called--it was the last on the list, and\nthe ante-chamber was now quite empty save for him. He walked into the\npresence of the pro-consul. Claude Lemoine, who was on guard in the room\nat the time, told me that just for the space of two seconds the two men\nlooked at one another. Then the stranger threw back his head and said\nquietly:\n\n\"There's a child dying of pleurisy, or worse, in an attic in the Rue des\nPipots. There's not a doctor left in Lyons to attend on him, and the\nchild will die for want of medical skill. Will you come to him, citizen\ndoctor?\"\n\nIt seems that for a moment or two Laporte hesitated.\n\n\"You look to me uncommonly like an aristo, and therefore a traitor,\" he\nsaid, \"and I've half a mind--\"\n\n\"To call your guard and order my immediate arrest,\" broke in milor with\na whimsical smile, \"but in that case a citizen of France will die for\nwant of a doctor's care. Let me take you to the child's bedside, citizen\ndoctor, you can always have me arrested afterwards.\"\n\nBut Laporte still hesitated.\n\n\"How do I know that you are not one of those English spies?\" he began.\n\n\"Take it that I am,\" rejoined milor imperturbably, \"and come and see the\npatient.\"\n\nNever had a situation been carried off with so bold a hand. Claude\nLemoine declared that Laporte's mouth literally opened for the call\nwhich would have summoned the sergeant of the guard into the room and\nordered the summary arrest of this impudent stranger. During the veriest\nfraction of a second life and death hung in the balance for the gallant\nEnglish milor. In the heart of Laporte every evil passion fought the one\nnoble fibre within him. But the instinct of the skilful healer won the\nbattle, and the next moment he had hastily collected what medicaments\nand appliances he might require, and the two men were soon speeding\nalong the streets in the direction of the Rue des Pipots.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the whole of that night, milor and Laporte sat together by the\nbedside of M. le Vicomte. Laporte only went out once in order to fetch\nwhat further medicaments he required. Mme. la Marquise took the\nopportunity of running out of her hiding-place in order to catch a\nglimpse of her child. I saw her take milor's hand and press it against\nher heart in silent gratitude. On her knees she begged him to go away\nand leave her and the boy to their fate. Was it likely that he would go?\nBut she was so insistent that at last he said:\n\n\"Madame, let me assure you that even if I were prepared to play the\ncoward's part which you would assign to me, it is not in my power to do\nso at this moment. Citizen Laporte came to this house under the escort\nof six picked men of his guard. He has left these men stationed on the\nlanding outside this door.\"\n\nMadame la Marquise gave a cry of terror, and once more that pathetic\nlook of horror came into her face. Milor took her hand and then pointed\nto the sick child.\n\n\"Madame,\" he said, \"M. le Vicomte is already slightly better. Thanks to\nmedical skill and a child's vigorous hold on life, he will live. The\nrest is in the hands of God.\"\n\nAlready the heavy footsteps of Laporte were heard upon the creaking\nstairs. Mme. la Marquise was forced to return to her hiding-place.\n\nSoon after dawn he went. M. le Vicomte was then visibly easier. Laporte\nhad all along paid no heed to me, but I noticed that once or twice\nduring his long vigil by the sick-bed his dark eyes beneath their\noverhanging brows shot a quick suspicious look at the door behind which\ncowered Mme. la Marquise. I had absolutely no doubt in my mind then that\nhe knew quite well who his patient was.\n\nHe gave certain directions to milor--there were certain fresh\nmedicaments to be got during the day. While he spoke there was a\nsinister glint in his eyes--half cynical, wholly menacing--as he looked\nup into the calm, impassive face of milor.\n\n\"It is essential for the welfare of the patient that these medicaments\nbe got for him during the day,\" he said dryly, \"and the guard have\norders to allow you to pass in and out. But you need have no fear,\" he\nadded significantly, \"I will leave an escort outside the house to\naccompany you on your way.\"\n\nHe gave a mocking, cruel laugh, the meaning of which was unmistakable.\nHis well-drilled human bloodhounds would be on the track of the English\nspy, whenever the latter dared to venture out into the streets.\n\nMme. la Marquise and I were prisoners for the day. We spent it in\nwatching alternately beside M. le Vicomte. But milor came and went as\nfreely as if he had not been carrying his precious life in his hands\nevery time that he ventured outside the house.\n\nIn the evening Laporte returned to see his patient, and again the\nfollowing morning, and the next evening. M. le Vicomte was making rapid\nprogress towards recovery.\n\nThe third day in the morning Laporte pronounced his patient to be out of\ndanger, but said that he would nevertheless come again to see him at the\nusual hour in the evening. Directly he had gone, milor went out in order\nto bring in certain delicacies of which the invalid was now allowed to\npartake. I persuaded Madame to lie down and have a couple of hours' good\nsleep in the inner attic, while I stayed to watch over the child.\n\nTo my horror, hardly had I taken up my stand at the foot of the bed when\nLaporte returned; he muttered something as he entered about having left\nsome important appliance behind, but I was quite convinced that he had\nbeen on the watch until milor was out of sight, and then slipped back in\norder to find me and Madame here alone.\n\nHe gave a glance at the child and another at the door of the inner\nattic, then he said in a loud voice:\n\n\"Yes, another twenty-four hours and my duties as doctor will cease and\nthose of patriot will re-commence. But Mme. la Marquise de Mortaine need\nno longer be in any anxiety about her son's health, nor will Mme. la\nGuillotine be cheated of a pack of rebels.\"\n\nHe laughed, and was on the point of turning on his heel when the door\nwhich gave on the smaller attic was opened and Mme. la Marquise appeared\nupon the threshold.\n\nMonsieur, I had never seen her look more beautiful than she did now in\nher overwhelming grief. Her face was as pale as death, her eyes, large\nand dilated, were fixed upon the human monster who had found it in his\nheart to speak such cruel words. Clad in a miserable, threadbare gown,\nher rich brown hair brought to the top of her head like a crown, she\nlooked more regal than any queen.\n\nBut proud as she was, monsieur, she yet knelt at the feet of that\nwretch. Yes, knelt, and embraced his knees and pleaded in such pitiable\naccents as would have melted the heart of a stone. She pleaded,\nmonsieur--ah, not for herself. She pleaded for her child and for me, her\nfaithful servant, and she pleaded for the gallant gentleman who had\nrisked his life for the sake of the child, who was nothing to him.\n\n\"Take me!\" she said. \"I come of a race that have always known how to\ndie! But what harm has that innocent child done in this world? What harm\nhas poor old Jean-Pierre done, and, oh ... is the world so full of brave\nand noble men that the bravest of them all be so unjustly sent to\ndeath?\"\n\nAh, monsieur, any man, save one of those abject products of that hideous\nRevolution, would have listened to such heartrending accents. But this\nman only laughed and turned on his heel without a word.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShall I ever forget the day that went by? Mme. la Marquise was well-nigh\nprostrate with terror, and it was heartrending to watch the noble\nefforts which she made to amuse M. le Vicomte. The only gleams of\nsunshine which came to us out of our darkness were the brief appearances\nof milor. Outside we could hear the measured tramp of the guard that had\nbeen set there to keep us close prisoners. They were relieved every six\nhours, and, in fact, we were as much under arrest as if we were already\nincarcerated in one of the prisons of Lyons.\n\nAt about four o'clock in the afternoon milor came back to us after a\nbrief absence. He stayed for a little while playing with M. le Vicomte.\nJust before leaving he took Madame's hand in his and said very\nearnestly, and sinking his voice to the merest whisper:\n\n\"To-night! Fear nothing! Be ready for anything! Remember that the League\nof the Scarlet Pimpernel have never failed to succour, and that I hereby\npledge you mine honour that you and those you care for will be out of\nLyons this night.\"\n\nHe was gone, leaving us to marvel at his strange words. Mme. la Marquise\nafter that was just like a person in a dream. She hardly spoke to me,\nand the only sound that passed her lips was a quaint little lullaby\nwhich she sang to M. le Vicomte ere he dropped off to sleep.\n\nThe hours went by leaden-footed. At every sound on the stairs Madame\nstarted like a frightened bird. That infamous Laporte usually paid his\nvisits at about eight o'clock in the evening, and after it became quite\ndark, Madame sat at the tiny window, and I felt that she was counting\nthe minutes which still lay between her and the dreaded presence of that\nawful man.\n\nAt a quarter before eight o'clock we heard the usual heavy footfall on\nthe stairs. Madame started up as if she had been struck. She ran to the\nbed--almost like one demented, and wrapping the one poor blanket round\nM. le Vicomte, she seized him in her arms. Outside we could hear\nLaporte's raucous voice speaking to the guard. His usual query: \"Is all\nwell?\" was answered by the brief: \"All well, citizen.\" Then he asked if\nthe English spy were within, and the sentinel replied: \"No, citizen, he\nwent out at about five o'clock and has not come back since.\"\n\n\"Not come back since five o'clock?\" said Laporte with a loud curse.\n\"Pardi! I trust that that fool Caudy has not allowed him to escape.\"\n\n\"I saw Caudy about an hour ago, citizen,\" said the man.\n\n\"Did he say anything about the Englishman then?\"\n\nIt seemed to us, who were listening to this conversation with bated\nbreath, that the man hesitated a moment ere he replied; then he spoke\nwith obvious nervousness.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, citizen,\" he said, \"Caudy thought then that the\nEnglishman was inside the house, whilst I was equally sure that I had\nseen him go downstairs an hour before.\"\n\n\"A thousand devils!\" cried Laporte with a savage oath, \"if I find that\nyou, citizen sergeant, or Caudy have blundered there will be trouble for\nyou.\"\n\nTo the accompaniment of a great deal more swearing he suddenly kicked\nopen the door of our attic with his boot, and then came to a standstill\non the threshold with his hands in the pockets of his breeches and his\nlegs planted wide apart, face to face with Mme. la Marquise, who\nconfronted him now, herself like a veritable tigress who is defending\nher young.\n\nHe gave a loud, mocking laugh.\n\n\"Ah, the aristos!\" he cried, \"waiting for that cursed Englishman, what?\nto drag you and your brat out of the claws of the human tiger.... Not\nso, my fine ci-devant Marquise. The brat is no longer sick--he is well\nenough, anyhow, to breathe the air of the prisons of Lyons for a few\ndays pending a final rest in the arms of Mme. la Guillotine. Citizen\nsergeant,\" he called over his shoulder, \"escort these aristos to my\ncarriage downstairs. When the Englishman returns, tell him he will find\nhis friends under the tender care of Doctor Laporte. En avant, little\nmother,\" he added, as he gripped Mme. la Marquise tightly by the arm,\n\"and you, old scarecrow,\" he concluded, speaking to me over his\nshoulder, \"follow the citizen sergeant, or----\"\n\nMme. la Marquise made no resistance. As I told you, she had been, since\ndusk, like a person in a dream; so what could I do but follow her noble\nexample? Indeed, I was too dazed to do otherwise.\n\nWe all went stumbling down the dark, rickety staircase, Laporte leading\nthe way with Mme. la Marquise, who had M. le Vicomte tightly clasped in\nher arms. I followed with the sergeant, whose hand was on my shoulder; I\nbelieve that two soldiers walked behind, but of that I cannot be sure.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs through the open door of the house I caught\nsight of the vague outline of a large barouche, the lanthorns of which\nthrew a feeble light upon the cruppers of two horses and of a couple of\nmen sitting on the box.\n\nMme. la Marquise stepped quietly into the carriage. Laporte followed\nher, and I was bundled in in his wake by the rough hands of the\nsoldiery. Just before the order was given to start, Laporte put his head\nout of the window and shouted to the sergeant:\n\n\"When you see Caudy tell him to report himself to me at once. I will be\nback here in half an hour; keep strict guard as before until then,\ncitizen sergeant.\"\n\nThe next moment the coachman cracked his whip, Laporte called loudly,\n\"En avant!\" and the heavy barouche went rattling along the ill-paved\nstreets.\n\nInside the carriage all was silence. I could hear Mme. la Marquise\nsoftly whispering to M. le Vicomte, and I marvelled how wondrously\ncalm--nay, cheerful, she could be. Then suddenly I heard a sound which\nof a truth did make my heart stop its beating. It was a quaint and\nprolonged laugh which I once thought I would never hear again on this\nearth. It came from the corner of the barouche next to where Mme. la\nMarquise was so tenderly and gaily crooning to her child. And a kindly\nvoice said merrily:\n\n\"In half an hour we shall be outside Lyons. To-morrow we'll be across\nthe Swiss frontier. We've cheated that old tiger after all. What say\nyou, Mme. la Marquise?\"\n\nIt was milor's voice, and he was as merry as a school-boy.\n\n\"I told you, old Jean-Pierre,\" he added, as he placed that firm hand\nwhich I loved so well upon my knee, \"I told you that those confounded\nmurderers would not get me this time.\"\n\nAnd to think that I did not know him, as he stood less than a quarter of\nan hour ago upon the threshold of our attic in the hideous guise of that\nabominable Laporte. He had spent two days in collecting old clothes that\nresembled those of that infamous wretch, and in taking possession of one\nof the derelict rooms in the house in the Rue des Pipots. Then while we\nwere expecting every moment that Laporte would order our arrest, milor\nassumed the personality of the monster, hoodwinked the sergeant on the\ndark staircase, and by that wonderfully audacious coup saved Mme. la\nMarquise, M. le Vicomte and my humble self from the guillotine.\n\nMoney, of which he had plenty, secured us immunity on the way, and we\nwere in safety over the Swiss frontier, leaving Laporte to eat out his\ntigerish heart with baffled rage.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nOUT OF THE JAWS OF DEATH\n\n\nBeing a fragment from the diary of Valentine Lemercier, in the\npossession of her great-granddaughter.\n\nWe were such a happy family before this terrible Revolution broke out;\nwe lived rather simply, but very comfortably, in our dear old home just\non the borders of the forest of Compiegne. Jean and Andre were the\ntwins; just fifteen years old they were when King Louis was deposed from\nthe throne of France which God had given him, and sent to prison like a\ncommon criminal, with our beautiful Queen Marie Antoinette and the Royal\nchildren, and Madame Elizabeth, who was so beloved by the poor!\n\nAh! that seems very, very long ago now. No doubt you know better than I\ndo all that happened in our beautiful land of France and in lovely Paris\nabout that time: goods and property confiscated, innocent men, women,\nand children condemned to death for acts of treason which they had never\ncommitted.\n\nIt was in August last year that they came to \"Mon Repos\" and arrested\npapa, and maman, and us four young ones and dragged us to Paris, where\nwe were imprisoned in a narrow and horribly dank vault in the Abbaye,\nwhere all day and night through the humid stone walls we heard cries and\nsobs and moans from poor people, who no doubt were suffering the same\nsorrows and the same indignities as we were.\n\nI had just passed my nineteenth birthday, and Marguerite was only\nthirteen. Maman was a perfect angel during that terrible time; she kept\nup our courage and our faith in God in a way that no one else could have\ndone. Every night and morning we knelt round her knee and papa sat close\nbeside her, and we prayed to God for deliverance from our own\nafflictions, and for the poor people who were crying and moaning all the\nday.\n\nBut of what went on outside our prison walls we had not an idea, though\nsometimes poor papa would brave the warder's brutalities and ask him\nquestions of what was happening in Paris every day.\n\n\"They are hanging all the aristos to the street-lamps of the city,\" the\nman would reply with a cruel laugh, \"and it will be your turn next.\"\n\nWe had been in prison for about a fortnight, when one day--oh! shall I\never forget it?--we heard in the distance a noise like the rumbling of\nthunder; nearer and nearer it came, and soon the sound became less\nconfused, cries and shrieks could be heard above that rumbling din; but\nso weird and menacing did those cries seem that instinctively--though\nnone of us knew what they meant--we all felt a nameless terror grip our\nhearts.\n\nOh! I am not going to attempt the awful task of describing to you all\nthe horrors of that never-to-be-forgotten day. People, who to-day cannot\nspeak without a shudder of the September massacres, have not the\nremotest conception of what really happened on that awful second day of\nthat month.\n\nWe are all at peace and happy now, but whenever my thoughts fly back to\nthat morning, whenever the ears of memory recall those hideous yells of\nfury and of hate, coupled with the equally horrible cries for pity,\nwhich pierced through the walls behind which the six of us were\ncrouching, trembling, and praying, whenever I think of it all my heart\nstill beats violently with that same nameless dread which held it in its\ndeathly grip then.\n\nHundreds of men, women, and children were massacred in the prisons of\nthat day--it was a St. Bartholomew even more hideous than the last.\n\nMaman was trying in vain to keep our thoughts fixed upon God--papa sat\non the stone bench, his elbows resting on his knees, his head buried in\nhis hands; but maman was kneeling on the floor, with her dear arms\nencircling us all and her trembling lips moving in continuous prayer.\n\nWe felt that we were facing death--and what a death, O my God!\n\nSuddenly the small grated window--high up in the dank wall--became\nobscured. I was the first to look up, but the cry of terror which rose\nfrom my heart was choked ere it reached my throat.\n\nJean and Andre looked up, too, and they shrieked, and so did Marguerite,\nand papa jumped up and ran to us and stood suddenly between us and the\nwindow like a tiger defending its young.\n\nBut we were all of us quite silent now. The children did not even cry;\nthey stared, wide-eyed, paralysed with fear.\n\nOnly maman continued to pray, and we could hear papa's rapid and\nstertorous breathing as he watched what was going on at that window\nabove.\n\nHeavy blows were falling against the masonry round the grating, and we\ncould hear the nerve-racking sound of a file working on the iron bars;\nand farther away, below the window, those awful yells of human beings\ntransformed by hate and fury into savage beasts.\n\nHow long this horrible suspense lasted I cannot now tell you; the next\nthing I remember clearly is a number of men in horrible ragged clothing\npouring into our vault-like prison from the window above; the next\nmoment they rushed at us simultaneously--or so it seemed to me, for I\nwas just then recommending my soul to God, so certain was I that in that\nsame second I would cease to live.\n\nIt was all like a dream, for instead of the horrible shriek of satisfied\nhate which we were all expecting to hear, a whispering voice, commanding\nand low, struck our ears and dragged us, as it were, from out the abyss\nof despair into the sudden light of hope.\n\n\"If you will trust us,\" the voice whispered, \"and not be afraid, you\nwill be safely out of Paris within an hour.\"\n\nPapa was the first to realise what was happening; he had never lost his\npresence of mind even during the darkest moment of this terrible time,\nand he said quite calmly and steadily now:\n\n\"What must we do?\"\n\n\"Persuade the little ones not to be afraid, not to cry, to be as still\nand silent as may be,\" continued the voice, which I felt must be that of\none of God's own angels, so exquisitely kind did it sound to my ear.\n\n\"They will be quiet and still without persuasion,\" said papa; \"eh,\nchildren?\"\n\nAnd Jean, Andre, and Marguerite murmured: \"Yes!\" whilst maman and I drew\nthem closer to us and said everything we could think of to make them\nstill more brave.\n\nAnd the whispering, commanding voice went on after awhile:\n\n\"Now will you allow yourselves to be muffled and bound, and, after that,\nwill you swear that whatever happens, whatever you may see or hear, you\nwill neither move nor speak? Not only your own lives, but those of many\nbrave men will depend upon your fulfilment of this oath.\"\n\nPapa made no reply save to raise his hand and eyes up to where God\nsurely was watching over us all. Maman said in her gentle, even voice:\n\n\"For myself and my children, I swear to do all that you tell us.\"\n\nA great feeling of confidence had entered into her heart, just as it had\ndone into mine. We looked at one another and knew that we were both\nthinking of the same thing: we were thinking of the brave Englishman and\nhis gallant little band of heroes, about whom we had heard many\nwonderful tales--how they had rescued a number of innocent people who\nwere unjustly threatened with the guillotine; and we all knew that the\ntall figure, disguised in horrible rags, who spoke to us with such a\ngentle yet commanding voice, was the man whom rumour credited with\nsupernatural powers, and who was known by the mysterious name of \"The\nScarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\nHardly had we sworn to do his bidding than his friends most\nunceremoniously threw great pieces of sacking over our heads, and then\nproceeded to tie ropes round our bodies. At least, I know that that is\nwhat one of them was doing to me, and from one or two whispered words of\ncommand which reached my ear I concluded that papa and maman and the\nchildren were being dealt with in the same summary way.\n\nI felt hot and stifled under that rough bit of sacking, but I would not\nhave moved or even sighed for worlds. Strangely enough, as soon as my\neyes and ears were shut off from the sounds and sights immediately round\nme, I once more became conscious of the horrible and awful din which was\ngoing on, not only on the other side of our prison walls, but inside the\nwhole of the Abbaye building and in the street beyond.\n\nOnce more I heard those terrible howls of rage and of satisfied hatred,\nuttered by the assassins who were being paid by the government of our\nbeautiful country to butcher helpless prisoners in their hundreds.\n\nSuddenly I felt myself hoisted up off my feet and slung up on to a pair\nof shoulders that must have been very powerful indeed, for I am no light\nweight, and once more I heard the voice, the very sound of which was\ndelight, quite close to my ear this time, giving a brief and\ncomprehensive command:\n\n\"All ready!--remember your part--en avant!\"\n\nThen it added in English. \"Here, Tony, you start kicking against the\ndoor whilst we begin to shout!\"\n\nI loved those few words of English, and hoped that maman had heard them\ntoo, for it would confirm her--as it did me--in the happy knowledge that\nGod and a brave man had taken our rescue in hand.\n\nBut from that moment we might have all been in the very ante-chamber of\nhell. I could hear the violent kicks against the heavy door of our\nprison, and our brave rescuers seemed suddenly to be transformed into a\ncageful of wild beasts. Their shouts and yells were as horrible as any\nthat came to us from the outside, and I must say that the gentle, firm\nvoice which I had learnt to love was as execrable as any I could hear.\n\nApparently the door would not yield, as the blows against it became more\nand more violent, and presently from somewhere above my head--the window\npresumably--there came a rough call, and a raucous laugh:\n\n\"Why? what in the name of---- is happening here?\"\n\nAnd the voice near me answered back equally roughly: \"A quarry of\nsix--but we are caught in this confounded trap--get the door open for\nus, citizen--we want to get rid of this booty and go in search for\nmore.\"\n\nA horrible laugh was the reply from above, and the next instant I heard\na terrific crash; the door had at last been burst open, either from\nwithin or without, I could not tell which, and suddenly all the din, the\ncries, the groans, the hideous laughter and bibulous songs which had\nsounded muffled up to now burst upon us with all their hideousness.\n\nThat was, I think, the most awful moment of that truly fearful hour. I\ncould not have moved then, even had I wished or been able to do so; but\nI knew that between us all and a horrible, yelling, murdering mob there\nwas now nothing--except the hand of God and the heroism of a band of\nEnglish gentlemen.\n\nTogether they gave a cry--as loud, as terrifying as any that were\nuttered by the butchering crowd in the building, and with a wild rush\nthey seemed to plunge with us right into the thick of the awful melee.\n\nAt least, that is what it all felt like to me, and afterwards I heard\nfrom our gallant rescuer himself that that is exactly what he and his\nfriends did. There were eight of them altogether, and we four young ones\nhad each been hoisted on a pair of devoted shoulders, whilst maman and\npapa were each carried by two men.\n\nI was lying across the finest pair of shoulders in the world, and close\nto me was beating the bravest heart on God's earth.\n\nThus burdened, these eight noble English gentlemen charged right through\nan army of butchering, howling brutes, they themselves howling with the\nfiercest of them.\n\nAll around me I heard weird and terrific cries: \"What ho! citizens--what\nhave you there?\"\n\n\"Six aristos!\" shouted my hero boldly as he rushed on, forging his way\nthrough the crowd.\n\n\"What are you doing with them?\" yelled a raucous voice.\n\n\"Food for the starving fish in the river,\" was the ready response.\n\"Stand aside, citizen,\" he added, with a round curse; \"I have my orders\nfrom citizen Danton himself about these six aristos. You hinder me at\nyour peril.\"\n\nHe was challenged over and over again in the same way, and so were his\nfriends who were carrying papa and maman and the children; but they were\nalways ready with a reply, ready with an invective or a curse; with eyes\nthat could not see, one could imagine them as hideous, as vengeful, as\ncruel as the rest of the crowd.\n\nI think that soon I must have fainted from sheer excitement and terror,\nfor I remember nothing more till I felt myself deposited on a hard\nfloor, propped against the wall, and the stifling piece of sacking taken\noff my head and face.\n\nI looked around me, dazed and bewildered; gradually the horrors of the\npast hour came back to me, and I had to close my eyes again, for I felt\nsick and giddy with the sheer memory of it all.\n\nBut presently I felt stronger and looked around me again. Jean and Andre\nwere squatting in a corner close by, gazing wide-eyed at the group of\nmen in filthy, ragged clothing, who sat round a deal table in the centre\nof a small, ill-furnished room.\n\nMaman was lying on a horsehair sofa at the other end of the room, with\nMarguerite beside her, and papa sat in a low chair by her side, holding\nher hand.\n\nThe voice I loved was speaking in its quaint, somewhat drawly cadence:\n\n\"You are quite safe now, my dear Monsieur Lemercier,\" it said; \"after\nMadame and the young people have had a rest, some of my friends will\nfind you suitable disguises, and they will escort you out of Paris, as\nthey have some really genuine passports in their possessions, which we\nobtain from time to time through the agency of a personage highly placed\nin this murdering government, and with the help of English banknotes.\nThose passports are not always unchallenged, I must confess,\" added my\nhero with a quaint laugh; \"but to-night everyone is busy murdering in\none part of Paris, so the other parts are comparatively safe.\"\n\nThen he turned to one of his friends and spoke to him in English:\n\n\"You had better see this through, Tony,\" he said, \"with Hastings and\nMackenzie. Three of you will be enough; I shall have need of the\nothers.\"\n\nNo one seemed to question his orders. He had spoken, and the others made\nready to obey. Just then papa spoke up:\n\n\"How are we going to thank you, sir?\" he asked, speaking broken English,\nbut with his habitual dignity of manner.\n\n\"By leaving your welfare in our hands, Monsieur,\" replied our gallant\nrescuer quietly.\n\nPapa tried to speak again, but the Englishman put up his hand to stop\nany further talk.\n\n\"There is no time now, Monsieur,\" he said with gentle courtesy. \"I must\nleave you, as I have much work yet to do.\"\n\n\"Where are you going, Blakeney?\" asked one of the others.\n\n\"Back to the Abbaye prison,\" he said; \"there are other women and\nchildren to be rescued there!\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nTHE TRAITOR\n\n\nNot one of them had really trusted him for some time now. Heaven and his\nconscience alone knew what had changed my Lord Kulmsted from a loyal\nfriend and keen sportsman into a surly and dissatisfied\nadherent--adherent only in name.\n\nSome say that lack of money had embittered him. He was a confirmed\ngambler, and had been losing over-heavily of late; and the League of the\nScarlet Pimpernel demanded sacrifices of money at times from its\nmembers, as well as of life if the need arose. Others averred that\njealousy against the chief had outweighed Kulmsted's honesty. Certain it\nis that his oath of fealty to the League had long ago been broken in the\nspirit. Treachery hovered in the air.\n\nBut the Scarlet Pimpernel himself, with that indomitable optimism of\nhis, and almost maddening insouciance, either did not believe in\nKulmsted's disloyalty or chose not to heed it.\n\nHe even asked him to join the present expedition--one of the most\ndangerous undertaken by the League for some time, and which had for its\nobject the rescue of some women of the late unfortunate Marie\nAntoinette's household: maids and faithful servants, ruthlessly\ncondemned to die for their tender adherence to a martyred queen. And yet\neighteen pairs of faithful lips had murmured words of warning.\n\nIt was towards the end of November, 1793. The rain was beating down in a\nmonotonous drip, drip, drip on to the roof of a derelict house in the\nRue Berthier. The wan light of a cold winter's morning peeped in through\nthe curtainless window and touched with its weird grey brush the pallid\nface of a young girl--a mere child--who sat in a dejected attitude on a\nrickety chair, with elbows leaning on the rough deal table before her,\nand thin, grimy fingers wandering with pathetic futility to her tearful\neyes.\n\nIn the farther angle of the room a tall figure in dark clothes was made\none, by the still lingering gloom, with the dense shadows beyond.\n\n\"We have starved,\" said the girl, with rebellious tears. \"Father and I\nand the boys are miserable enough, God knows; but we have always been\nhonest.\"\n\nFrom out the shadows in that dark corner of the room there came the\nsound of an oath quickly suppressed.\n\n\"Honest!\" exclaimed the man, with a harsh, mocking laugh, which made the\ngirl wince as if with physical pain. \"Is it honest to harbour the\nenemies of your country? Is it honest---\"\n\nBut quickly he checked himself, biting his lips with vexation, feeling\nthat his present tactics were not like to gain the day.\n\nHe came out of the gloom and approached the girl with every outward sign\nof eagerness. He knelt on the dusty floor beside her, his arms stole\nround her meagre shoulders, and his harsh voice was subdued to tones of\ngentleness.\n\n\"I was only thinking of your happiness, Yvonne,\" he said tenderly; \"of\npoor blind papa and the two boys to whom you have been such a devoted\nlittle mother. My only desire is that you should earn the gratitude of\nyour country by denouncing her most bitter enemy--an act of patriotism\nwhich will place you and those for whom you care for ever beyond the\nreach of sorrow or of want.\"\n\nThe voice, the appeal, the look of love, was more than the poor, simple\ngirl could resist. Milor was so handsome, so kind, so good.\n\nIt had all been so strange: these English aristocrats coming here, she\nknew not whence, and who seemed fugitives even though they had plenty of\nmoney to spend. Two days ago they had sought shelter like malefactors\nescaped from justice--in this same tumbledown, derelict house where she,\nYvonne, with her blind father and two little brothers, crept in of\nnights, or when the weather was too rough for them all to stand and beg\nin the streets of Paris.\n\nThere were five of them altogether, and one seemed to be the chief. He\nwas very tall, and had deep blue eyes, and a merry voice that went\nechoing along the worm-eaten old rafters. But milor--the one whose arms\nwere encircling her even now--was the handsomest among them all. He had\nsought Yvonne out on the very first night when she had crawled shivering\nto that corner of the room where she usually slept.\n\nThe English aristocrats had frightened her at first, and she was for\nflying from the derelict house with her family and seeking shelter\nelsewhere; but he who appeared to be the chief had quickly reassured\nher. He seemed so kind and good, and talked so gently to blind papa, and\nmade such merry jests with Francois and Clovis that she herself could\nscarce refrain from laughing through her tears.\n\nBut later on in the night, milor--her milor, as she soon got to call\nhim--came and talked so beautifully that she, poor girl, felt as if no\nmusic could ever sound quite so sweetly in her ear.\n\nThat was two days ago, and since then milor had often talked to her in\nthe lonely, abandoned house, and Yvonne had felt as if she dwelt in\nHeaven. She still took blind papa and the boys out to beg in the\nstreets, but in the morning she prepared some hot coffee for the English\naristocrats, and in the evening she cooked them some broth. Oh! they\ngave her money lavishly; but she quite understood that they were in\nhiding, though what they had to fear, being English, she could not\nunderstand.\n\nAnd now milor--her milor--was telling her that these Englishmen, her\nfriends, were spies and traitors, and that it was her duty to tell\ncitizen Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety all about them\nand their mysterious doings. And poor Yvonne was greatly puzzled and\ndeeply distressed, because, of course, whatever milor said, that was the\ntruth; and yet her conscience cried out within her poor little bosom,\nand the thought of betraying those kind Englishmen was horrible to her.\n\n\"Yvonne,\" whispered milor in that endearing voice of his, which was like\nthe loveliest music in her ear, \"my little Yvonne, you do trust me, do\nyou not?\"\n\n\"With all my heart, milor,\" she murmured fervently.\n\n\"Then, would you believe it of me that I would betray a real friend?\"\n\n\"I believe, milor, that whatever you do is right and good.\"\n\nA sigh of infinite relief escaped his lips.\n\n\"Come, that's better!\" he said, patting her cheek kindly with his hand.\n\"Now, listen to me, little one. He who is the chief among us here is the\nmost unscrupulous and daring rascal whom the world has ever known. He it\nis who is called the 'Scarlet Pimpernel!'\"\n\n\"The Scarlet Pimpernel!\" murmured Yvonne, her eyes dilated with\nsuperstitious awe, for she too had heard of the mysterious Englishman\nand of his followers, who rescued aristocrats and traitors from the\ndeath to which the tribunal of the people had justly condemned them, and\non whom the mighty hand of the Committee of Public Safety had never yet\nbeen able to fall.\n\n\"This Scarlet Pimpernel,\" said milor earnestly after a while, \"is also\nmine own most relentless enemy. With lies and promises he induced me to\njoin him in his work of spying and of treachery, forcing me to do this\nwork against which my whole soul rebels. You can save me from this hated\nbondage, little one. You can make me free to live again, make me free to\nlove and place my love at your feet.\"\n\nHis voice had become exquisitely tender, and his lips, as he whispered\nthe heavenly words, were quite close to her ear. He, a great gentleman,\nloved the miserable little waif whose kindred consisted of a blind\nfather and two half-starved little brothers, and whose only home was\nthis miserable hovel, whence milor's graciousness and bounty would soon\ntake her.\n\nDo you think that Yvonne's sense of right and wrong, of honesty and\ntreachery, should have been keener than that primeval instinct of a\nsimple-hearted woman to throw herself trustingly into the arms of the\nman who has succeeded in winning her love?\n\nYvonne, subdued, enchanted, murmured still through her tears:\n\n\"What would milor have me do?\"\n\nLord Kulmsted rose from his knees satisfied.\n\n\"Listen to me, Yvonne,\" he said. \"You are acquainted with the\nEnglishman's plans, are you not?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied simply. \"He has had to trust me.\"\n\n\"Then you know that at sundown this afternoon I and the three others are\nto leave for Courbevoie on foot, where we are to obtain what horses we\ncan whilst awaiting the chief.\"\n\n\"I did not know whither you and the other three gentlemen were going,\nmilor,\" she replied; \"but I did know that some of you were to make a\nstart at four o'clock, whilst I was to wait here for your leader and\nprepare some supper against his coming.\"\n\n\"At what time did he tell you that he would come?\"\n\n\"He did not say; but he did tell me that when he returns he will have\nfriends with him--a lady and two little children. They will be hungry\nand cold. I believe that they are in great danger now, and that the\nbrave English gentleman means to take them away from this awful Paris to\na place of safety.\"\n\n\"The brave English gentleman, my dear,\" retorted milor, with a sneer,\n\"is bent on some horrible work of spying. The lady and the two children\nare, no doubt, innocent tools in his hands, just as I am, and when he no\nlonger needs them he will deliver them over to the Committee of Public\nSafety, who will, of a surety, condemn them to death. That will also be\nmy fate, Yvonne, unless you help me now.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" she exclaimed fervently. \"Tell me what to do, milor, and I\nwill do it.\"\n\n\"At sundown,\" he said, sinking his voice so low that even she could\nscarcely hear, \"when I and the three others have started on our way, go\nstraight to the house I spoke to you about in the Rue Dauphine--you know\nwhere it is?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, milor.\"\n\n\"You will know the house by its tumbledown portico and the tattered red\nflag that surmounts it. Once there, push the door open and walk in\nboldly. Then ask to speak with citizen Robespierre.\"\n\n\"Robespierre?\" exclaimed the child in terror.\n\n\"You must not be afraid, Yvonne,\" he said earnestly; \"you must think of\nme and of what you are doing for me. My word on it--Robespierre will\nlisten to you most kindly.\"\n\n\"What shall I tell him?\" she murmured.\n\n\"That a mysterious party of Englishmen are in hiding in this house--that\ntheir chief is known among them as the Scarlet Pimpernel. The rest leave\nto Robespierre's discretion. You see how simple it is?\"\n\nIt was indeed very simple! Nor did the child recoil any longer from the\nugly task which milor, with suave speech and tender voice, was so\nardently seeking to impose on her.\n\nA few more words of love, which cost him nothing, a few kisses which\ncost him still less, since the wench loved him, and since she was young\nand pretty, and Yvonne was as wax in the hands of the traitor.\n\n\nII\n\nSilence reigned in the low-raftered room on the ground floor of the\nhouse in the Rue Dauphine.\n\nCitizen Robespierre, chairman of the Cordeliers Club, the most\nbloodthirsty, most Evolutionary club of France, had just re-entered the\nroom.\n\nHe walked up to the centre table, and through the close atmosphere,\nthick with tobacco smoke, he looked round on his assembled friends.\n\n\"We have got him,\" he said at last curtly.\n\n\"Got him! Whom?\" came in hoarse cries from every corner of the room.\n\n\"That Englishman,\" replied the demagogue, \"the Scarlet Pimpernel!\"\n\nA prolonged shout rose in response--a shout not unlike that of a caged\nherd of hungry wild beasts to whom a succulent morsel of flesh has\nunexpectedly been thrown.\n\n\"Where is he?\" \"Where did you get him?\" \"Alive or dead?\" And many more\nquestions such as these were hurled at the speaker from every side.\n\nRobespierre, calm, impassive, immaculately neat in his tightly fitting\ncoat, his smart breeches, and his lace cravat, waited awhile until the\ndin had somewhat subsided. Then he said calmly:\n\n\"The Scarlet Pimpernel is in hiding in one of the derelict houses in the\nRue Berthier.\"\n\nSnarls of derision as vigorous as the former shouts of triumph drowned\nthe rest of his speech.\n\n\"Bah! How often has that cursed Scarlet Pimpernel been said to be alone\nin a lonely house? Citizen Chauvelin has had him at his mercy several\ntimes in lonely houses.\"\n\nAnd the speaker, a short, thick-set man with sparse black hair plastered\nover a greasy forehead, his shirt open at the neck, revealing a powerful\nchest and rough, hairy skin, spat in ostentatious contempt upon the\nfloor.\n\n\"Therefore will we not boast of his capture yet, citizen Roger,\" resumed\nRobespierre imperturbably. \"I tell you where the Englishman is. Do you\nlook to it that he does not escape.\"\n\nThe heat in the room had become intolerable. From the grimy ceiling an\noil-lamp, flickering low, threw lurid, ruddy lights on tricolour\ncockades, on hands that seemed red with the blood of innocent victims of\nlust and hate, and on faces glowing with desire and with anticipated\nsavage triumph.\n\n\"Who is the informer?\" asked Roger at last.\n\n\"A girl,\" replied Robespierre curtly. \"Yvonne Lebeau, by name; she and\nher family live by begging. There are a blind father and two boys; they\nherd together at night in the derelict house in the Rue Berthier. Five\nEnglishmen have been in hiding there these past few days. One of them is\ntheir leader. The girl believes him to be the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\n\"Why has she not spoken of this before?\" muttered one of the crowd, with\nsome scepticism.\n\n\"Frightened, I suppose. Or the Englishman paid her to hold her tongue.\"\n\n\"Where is the girl now?\"\n\n\"I am sending her straight home, a little ahead of us. Her presence\nshould reassure the Englishman whilst we make ready to surround the\nhouse. In the meanwhile, I have sent special messengers to every gate of\nParis with strict orders to the guard not to allow anyone out of the\ncity until further orders from the Committee of Public Safety. And now,\"\nhe added, throwing back his head with a gesture of proud challenge,\n\"citizens, which of you will go man-hunting to-night?\"\n\nThis time the strident roar of savage exultation was loud and deep\nenough to shake the flickering lamp upon its chain.\n\nA brief discussion of plans followed, and Roger--he with the broad,\nhairy chest and that gleam of hatred for ever lurking in his deep-set,\nshifty eyes--was chosen the leader of the party.\n\nThirty determined and well-armed patriots set out against one man, who\nmayhap had supernatural powers. There would, no doubt, be some\naristocrats, too, in hiding in the derelict house--the girl Lebeau, it\nseems, had spoken of a woman and two children. Bah! These would not\ncount. It would be thirty to one, so let the Scarlet Pimpernel look to\nhimself.\n\nFrom the towers of Notre Dame the big bell struck the hour of six, as\nthirty men in ragged shirts and torn breeches, shivering beneath a cold\nNovember drizzle, began slowly to wend their way towards the Rue\nBerthier.\n\nThey walked on in silence, not heeding the cold or the rain, but with\neyes fixed in the direction of their goal, and nostrils quivering in the\nevening air with the distant scent of blood.\n\n\nIII\n\nAt the top of the Rue Berthier the party halted. On ahead--some two\nhundred metres farther--Yvonne Lebeau's little figure, with her ragged\nskirt pulled over her head and her bare feet pattering in the mud, was\nseen crossing one of those intermittent patches of light formed by\noccasional flickering street lamps, and then was swallowed up once more\nby the inky blackness beyond.\n\nThe Rue Berthier is a long, narrow, ill-paved and ill-lighted street,\ncomposed of low and irregular houses, which abut on the line of\nfortifications at the back, and are therefore absolutely inaccessible\nsave from the front.\n\nMidway down the street a derelict house rears ghostly debris of roofs\nand chimney-stacks upward to the sky. A tiny square of yellow light,\nblinking like a giant eye through a curtainless window, pierced the wall\nof the house. Roger pointed to that light.\n\n\"That,\" he said, \"is the quarry where our fox has run to earth.\"\n\nNo one said anything; but the dank night air seemed suddenly alive with\nall the passions of hate let loose by thirty beating hearts.\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel, who had tricked them, mocked them, fooled them so\noften, was there, not two hundred metres away; and they were thirty to\none, and all determined and desperate.\n\nThe darkness was intense.\n\nSilently now the party approached the house, then again they halted,\nwithin sixty metres of it.\n\n\"Hist!\"\n\nThe whisper could scarce be heard, so low was it, like the sighing of\nthe wind through a misty veil.\n\n\"Who is it?\" came in quick challenge from Roger.\n\n\"I--Yvonne Lebeau!\"\n\n\"Is he there?\" was the eager whispered query.\n\n\"Not yet. But he may come at any moment. If he saw a crowd round the\nhouse, mayhap he would not come.\"\n\n\"He cannot see a crowd. The night is as dark as pitch.\"\n\n\"He can see in the darkest night,\" and the girl's voice sank to an awed\nwhisper, \"and he can hear through a stone wall.\"\n\nInstinctively, Roger shuddered. The superstitious fear which the\nmysterious personality of the Scarlet Pimpernel evoked in the heart of\nevery Terrorist had suddenly seized this man in its grip.\n\nTry as he would, he did not feel as valiant as he had done when first he\nemerged at the head of his party from under the portico of the\nCordeliers Club, and it was with none too steady a voice that he ordered\nthe girl roughly back to the house. Then he turned once more to his men.\n\nThe plan of action had been decided on in the Club, under the presidency\nof Robespierre; it only remained to carry the plans through with\nsuccess.\n\nFrom the side of the fortifications there was, of course, nothing to\nfear. In accordance with military regulations, the walls of the houses\nthere rose sheer from the ground without doors or windows, whilst the\nbroken-down parapets and dilapidated roofs towered forty feet above the\nground.\n\nThe derelict itself was one of a row of houses, some inhabited, others\nquite abandoned. It was the front of that row of houses, therefore, that\nhad to be kept in view. Marshalled by Roger, the men flattened their\nmeagre bodies against the walls of the houses opposite, and after that\nthere was nothing to do but wait.\n\nTo wait in the darkness of the night, with a thin, icy rain soaking\nthrough ragged shirts and tattered breeches, with bare feet frozen by\nthe mud of the road--to wait in silence while turbulent hearts beat\nwell-nigh to bursting--to wait for food whilst hunger gnaws the\nbowels--to wait for drink whilst the parched tongue cleaves to the roof\nof the mouth--to wait for revenge whilst the hours roll slowly by and\nthe cries of the darkened city are stilled one by one!\n\nOnce--when a distant bell tolled the hour of ten--a loud prolonged\nlaugh, almost impudent in its suggestion of merry insouciance, echoed\nthrough the weird silence of the night.\n\nRoger felt that the man nearest to him shivered at that sound, and he\nheard a volley or two of muttered oaths.\n\n\"The fox seems somewhere near,\" he whispered. \"Come within. We'll wait\nfor him inside his hole.\"\n\nHe led the way across the street, some of the men following him.\n\nThe door of the derelict house had been left on the latch. Roger pushed\nit open.\n\nSilence and gloom here reigned supreme; utter darkness, too, save for a\nnarrow streak of light which edged the framework of a door on the right.\nNot a sound stirred the quietude of this miserable hovel, only the\ncreaking of boards beneath the men's feet as they entered.\n\nRoger crossed the passage and opened the door on the right. His friends\npressed closely round to him and peeped over his shoulder into the room\nbeyond.\n\nA guttering piece of tallow candle, fixed to an old tin pot, stood in\nthe middle of the floor, and its feeble, flickering light only served to\naccentuate the darkness that lay beyond its range. One or two rickety\nchairs and a rough deal table showed vaguely in the gloom, and in the\nfar corner of the room there lay a bundle of what looked like heaped-up\nrags, but from which there now emerged the sound of heavy breathing and\nalso a little cry of fear.\n\n\"Yvonne,\" came in feeble, querulous accents from that same bundle of\nwretchedness, \"are these the English milors come back at last?\"\n\n\"No, no, father,\" was the quick whispered reply.\n\nRoger swore a loud oath, and two puny voices began to whimper piteously.\n\n\"It strikes me the wench has been fooling us,\" muttered one of the men\nsavagely.\n\nThe girl had struggled to her feet. She crouched in the darkness, and\ntwo little boys, half-naked and shivering, were clinging to her skirts.\nThe rest of the human bundle seemed to consist of an oldish man, with\nlong, gaunt legs and arms blue with the cold. He turned vague, wide-open\neyes in the direction whence had come the harsh voices.\n\n\"Are they friends, Yvonne?\" he asked anxiously.\n\nThe girl did her best to reassure him.\n\n\"Yes, yes, father,\" she whispered close to his ear, her voice scarce\nabove her breath; \"they are good citizens who hoped to find the English\nmilor here. They are disappointed that he has not yet come.\"\n\n\"Ah! but he will come, of a surety,\" said the old man in that querulous\nvoice of his. \"He left his beautiful clothes here this morning, and\nsurely he will come to fetch them.\" And his long, thin hand pointed\ntowards a distant corner of the room.\n\nRoger and his friends, looking to where he was pointing, saw a parcel of\nclothes, neatly folded, lying on one of the chairs. Like so many wild\ncats snarling at sight of prey, they threw themselves upon those\nclothes, tearing them out from one another's hands, turning them over\nand over as if to force the cloth and satin to yield up the secret that\nlay within their folds.\n\nIn the skirmish a scrap of paper fluttered to the ground. Roger seized\nit with avidity, and, crouching on the floor, smoothed the paper out\nagainst his knee.\n\nIt contained a few hastily scrawled words, and by the feeble light of\nthe fast-dying candle Roger spelt them out laboriously:\n\n\"If the finder of these clothes will take them to the cross-roads\nopposite the foot-bridge which leads straight to Courbevoie, and will do\nso before the clock of Courbevoie Church has struck the hour of\nmidnight, he will be rewarded with the sum of five hundred francs.\"\n\n\"There is something more, citizen Roger,\" said a raucous voice close to\nhis ear.\n\n\"Look! Look, citizen--in the bottom corner of the paper!\"\n\n\"The signature.\"\n\n\"A scrawl done in red,\" said Roger, trying to decipher it.\n\n\"It looks like a small flower.\"\n\n\"That accursed Scarlet Pimpernel!\"\n\nAnd even as he spoke the guttering tallow candle, swaying in its socket,\nsuddenly went out with a loud splutter and a sizzle that echoed through\nthe desolate room like the mocking laugh of ghouls.\n\n\nIV\n\nOnce more the tramp through the dark and deserted streets, with the\ndrizzle--turned now to sleet--beating on thinly clad shoulders. Fifteen\nmen only on this tramp. The others remained behind to watch the house.\nFifteen men, led by Roger, and with a blind old man, a young girl\ncarrying a bundle of clothes, and two half-naked children dragged as\ncamp-followers in the rear.\n\nTheir destination now was the sign-post which stands at the cross-roads,\npast the footbridge that leads to Courbevoie.\n\nThe guard at the Maillot Gate would have stopped the party, but Roger,\nmember of the Committee of Public Safety, armed with his papers and his\ntricolour scarf, overruled Robespierre's former orders, and the party\nmached out of the gate.\n\nThey pressed on in silence, instinctively walking shoulder to shoulder,\nvaguely longing for the touch of another human hand, the sound of a\nvoice that would not ring weirdly in the mysterious night.\n\nThere was something terrifying in this absolute silence, in such intense\ndarkness, in this constant wandering towards a goal that seemed for ever\ndistant, and in all this weary, weary fruitless waiting; and these men,\nwho lived their life through, drunken with blood, deafened by the cries\nof their victims, satiated with the moans of the helpless and the\ninnocent, hardly dared to look around them, lest they should see\nghoulish forms flitting through the gloom.\n\nSoon they reached the cross-roads, and in the dense blackness of the\nnight the gaunt arms of the sign-post pointed ghostlike towards the\nnorth.\n\nThe men hung back, wrapped in the darkness as in a pall, while Roger\nadvanced alone.\n\n\"Hola! Is anyone there?\" he called softly.\n\nThen, as no reply came, he added more loudly:\n\n\"Hola! A friend--with some clothes found in the Rue Berthier. Is anyone\nhere? Hola! A friend!\"\n\nBut only from the gently murmuring river far away the melancholy call of\na waterfowl seemed to echo mockingly:\n\n\"A friend!\"\n\nJust then the clock of Courbevoie Church struck the midnight hour.\n\n\"It is too late,\" whispered the men.\n\nThey did not swear, nor did they curse their leader. Somehow it seemed\nas if they had expected all along that the Englishman would evade their\nvengeance yet again, that he would lure them out into the cold and into\nthe darkness, and then that he would mock them, fool them, and finally\ndisappear into the night.\n\nIt seemed futile to wait any longer. They were so sure that they had\nfailed again.\n\n\"Who goes there?\"\n\nThe sound of naked feet and of wooden sabots pattering on the distant\nfootbridge had caused Roger to utter the quick challenge.\n\n\"Hola! Hola! Are you there?\" was the loud, breathless response.\n\nThe next moment the darkness became alive with men moving quickly\nforward, and raucous shouts of \"Where are they?\" \"Have you got them?\"\n\"Don't let them go!\" filled the air.\n\n\"Got whom?\" \"Who are they?\" \"What is it?\" were the wild counter-cries.\n\n\"The man! The girl! The children! Where are they?\"\n\n\"What? Which? The Lebeau family? They are here with us.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nWhere, indeed? To a call to them from Roger there came no answer, nor\ndid a hasty search result in finding them--the old man, the two boys,\nand the girl carrying the bundle of clothes had vanished into the night.\n\n\"In the name of---, what does this mean?\" cried hoarse voices in the\ncrowd.\n\nThe new-comers, breathless, terrified, shaking with superstitious fear,\ntried to explain.\n\n\"The Lebeau family--the old man, the girl, the two boys--we discovered\nafter your departure, locked up in the cellar of the house--prisoners.\"\n\n\"But, then--the others?\" they gasped.\n\n\"The girl and the children whom you saw must have been some aristocrats\nin disguise. The old man who spoke to you was that cursed\nEnglishman--the Scarlet Pimpernel!\"\n\nAnd as if in mocking confirmation of these words there suddenly rang,\nechoing from afar, a long and merry laugh.\n\n\"The Scarlet Pimpernel!\" cried Roger. \"In rags and barefooted! At him,\ncitizens; he cannot have got far!\"\n\n\"Hush! Listen!\" whispered one of the men, suddenly gripping him by the\narm.\n\nAnd from the distance--though Heaven only knew from what direction--came\nthe sound of horses' hoofs pawing the soft ground; the next moment they\nwere heard galloping away at breakneck speed.\n\nThe men turned to run in every direction, blindly, aimlessly, in the\ndark, like bloodhounds that have lost the trail.\n\nOne man, as he ran, stumbled against a dark mass prone upon the ground.\nWith a curse on his lips, he recovered his balance.\n\n\"Hold! What is this?\" he cried.\n\nSome of his comrades gathered round him. No one could see anything, but\nthe dark mass appeared to have human shape, and it was bound round and\nround with cords. And now feeble moans escaped from obviously human\nlips.\n\n\"What is it? Who is it?\" asked the men.\n\n\"An Englishman,\" came in weak accents from the ground.\n\n\"Your name?\"\n\n\"I am called Kulmsted.\"\n\n\"Bah! An aristocrat!\"\n\n\"No! An enemy of the Scarlet Pimpernel, like yourselves. I would have\ndelivered him into your hands. But you let him escape you. As for me, he\nwould have been wiser if he had killed me.\"\n\nThey picked him up and undid the cords from round his body, and later on\ntook him with them back into Paris.\n\nBut there, in the darkness of the night, in the mud of the road, and\nbeneath the icy rain, knees were shaking that had long ago forgotten how\nto bend, and hasty prayers were muttered by lips that were far more\naccustomed to blaspheme.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE CABARET DE LA LIBERTE\n\n\nI\n\n\"Eight!\"\n\n\"Twelve!\"\n\n\"Four!\"\n\nA loud curse accompanied this last throw, and shouts of ribald laughter\ngreeted it.\n\n\"No luck, Guidal!\"\n\n\"Always at the tail end of the cart, eh, citizen?\"\n\n\"Do not despair yet, good old Guidal! Bad beginnings oft make splendid\nends!\"\n\nThen once again the dice rattled in the boxes; those who stood around\npressed closer round the gamesters; hot, avid faces, covered with sweat\nand grime, peered eagerly down upon the table.\n\n\"Eight and eleven--nineteen!\"\n\n\"Twelve and zero! By Satan! Curse him! Just my luck!\"\n\n\"Four and nine--thirteen! Unlucky number!\"\n\n\"Now then--once more! I'll back Merri! Ten assignats of the most\nworthless kind! Who'll take me that Merri gets the wench in the end?\"\n\nThis from one of the lookers-on, a tall, cadaverous-looking creature,\nwith sunken eyes and broad, hunched-up shoulders, which were perpetually\nshaken by a dry, rasping cough that proclaimed the ravages of some\nmortal disease, left him trembling as with ague and brought beads of\nperspiration to the roots of his lank hair. A recrudescence of\nexcitement went the round of the spectators. The gamblers sitting round\na narrow deal table, on which past libations had left marks of sticky\nrings, had scarce room to move their elbows.\n\n\"Nineteen and four--twenty-three!\"\n\n\"You are out of it, Desmonts!\"\n\n\"Not yet!\"\n\n\"Twelve and twelve!\"\n\n\"There! What did I tell you?\"\n\n\"Wait! wait! Now, Merri! Now! Remember I have backed you for ten\nassignats, which I propose to steal from the nearest Jew this very\nnight.\"\n\n\"Thirteen and twelve! Twenty-five, by all the demons and the ghouls!\"\ncame with a triumphant shout from the last thrower.\n\n\"Merri has it! Vive Merri!\" was the unanimous and clamorous response.\n\nMerri was evidently the most popular amongst the three gamblers. Now he\nsprawled upon the bench, leaning his back against the table, and\nsurveyed the assembled company with the air of an Achilles having\nvanquished his Hector.\n\n\"Good luck to you and to your aristo!\" began his backer lustily--would,\nno doubt, have continued his song of praise had not a violent fit of\ncoughing smothered the words in his throat. The hand which he had raised\nin order to slap his friend genially on the back now went with a\nconvulsive clutch to his own chest.\n\nBut his obvious distress did not apparently disturb the equanimity of\nMerri, or arouse even passing interest in the lookers-on.\n\n\"May she have as much money as rumour avers,\" said one of the men\nsententiously.\n\nMerri gave a careless wave of his grubby hand.\n\n\"More, citizen; more!\" he said loftily.\n\nOnly the two losers appeared inclined to scepticism.\n\n\"Bah!\" one of them said--it was Desmonts. \"The whole matter of the\nwoman's money may be a tissue of lies!\"\n\n\"And England is a far cry!\" added Guidal.\n\nBut Merri was not likely to be depressed by these dismal croakings.\n\n\"'Tis simple enough,\" he said philosophically, \"to disparage the goods\nif you are not able to buy.\"\n\nThen a lusty voice broke in from the far corner of the room:\n\n\"And now, citizen Merri, 'tis time you remembered that the evening is\nhot and your friends thirsty!\"\n\nThe man who spoke was a short, broad-shouldered creature, with crimson\nface surrounded by a shock of white hair, like a ripe tomato wrapped in\ncotton wool.\n\n\"And let me tell you,\" he added complacently, \"that I have a cask of rum\ndown below, which came straight from that accursed country, England, and\nis said to be the nectar whereon feeds that confounded Scarlet\nPimpernel. It gives him the strength, so 'tis said, to intrigue\nsuccessfully against the representatives of the people.\"\n\n\"Then by all means, citizen,\" concluded Merri's backer, still hoarse and\nspent after his fit of coughing, \"let us have some of your nectar. My\nfriend, citizen Merri, will need strength and wits too, I'll warrant,\nfor, after he has married the aristo, he will have to journey to England\nto pluck the rich dowry which is said to lie hidden there.\"\n\n\"Cast no doubt upon that dowry, citizen Rateau, curse you!\" broke in\nMerri, with a spiteful glance directed against his former rivals, \"or\nGuidal and Desmonts will cease to look glum, and half my joy in the\naristo will have gone.\"\n\nAfter which, the conversation drifted to general subjects, became\nhilarious and ribald, while the celebrated rum from England filled the\nclose atmosphere of the narrow room with its heady fumes.\n\n\nII\n\nOpen to the street in front, the locality known under the pretentious\ntitle of \"Cabaret de la Liberte\" was a favoured one among the flotsam\nand jetsam of the population of this corner of old Paris; men and\nsometimes women, with nothing particular to do, no special means of\nlivelihood save the battening on the countless miseries and sorrows\nwhich this Revolution, which was to have been so glorious, was bringing\nin its train; idlers and loafers, who would crawl desultorily down the\nfew worn and grimy steps which led into the cabaret from the level of\nthe street. There was always good brandy or eau de vie to be had there,\nand no questions asked, no scares from the revolutionary guards or the\nsecret agents of the Committee of Public Safety, who knew better than to\ninterfere with the citizen host and his dubious clientele. There was\nalso good Rhine wine or rum to be had, smuggled across from England or\nGermany, and no interference from the spies of some of those countless\nCommittees, more autocratic than any ci-devant despot. It was, in fact,\nan ideal place wherein to conduct those shady transactions which are\nunavoidable corollaries of an unfettered democracy. Projects of\nburglary, pillage, rapine, even murder, were hatched within this\nunderground burrow, where, as soon as evening drew in, a solitary, smoky\noil-lamp alone cast a dim light upon faces that liked to court the\ndarkness, and whence no sound that was not meant for prying ears found\nits way to the street above. The walls were thick with grime and smoke,\nthe floor mildewed and cracked; dirt vied with squalor to make the place\na fitting abode for thieves and cut-throats, for some of those sinister\nnight-birds, more vile even than those who shrieked with satisfied lust\nat sight of the tumbril, with its daily load of unfortunates for the\nguillotine.\n\nOn this occasion the project that was being hatched was one of the most\nabject. A young girl, known by some to be possessed of a fortune, was\nthe stake for which these workers of iniquity gambled across one of mine\nhost's greasy tables. The latest decree of the Convention, encouraging,\nnay, commanding, the union of aristocrats with so-called patriots, had\nfired the imagination of this nest of jail-birds with thoughts of\nglorious possibilities. Some of them had collected the necessary\ninformation; and the report had been encouraging.\n\nThat self-indulgent aristo, the ci-devant banker Amede Vincent, who had\nexpiated his villainies upon the guillotine, was known to have been\nsuccessful in abstracting the bulk of his ill-gotten wealth and\nconcealing it somewhere--it was not exactly known where, but thought to\nbe in England--out of the reach, at any rate, of deserving patriots.\n\nSome three or four years ago, before the glorious principles of Liberty,\nEquality, and Fraternity had made short shrift of all such pestilential\naristocrats, the ci-devant banker, then a widower with an only daughter,\nEsther, had journeyed to England. He soon returned to Paris, however,\nand went on living there with his little girl in comparative retirement,\nuntil his many crimes found him out at last and he was made to suffer\nthe punishment which he so justly deserved. Those crimes consisted for\nthe most part in humiliating the aforesaid deserving patriots with his\nbenevolence, shaming them with many kindnesses, and the simplicity of\nhis home-life, and, above all, in flouting the decrees of the\nRevolutionary Government, which made every connection with ci-devant\nchurches and priests a penal offence against the security of the State.\n\nAmede Vincent was sent to the guillotine, and the representatives of the\npeople confiscated his house and all his property on which they could\nlay their hands; but they never found the millions which he was supposed\nto have concealed. Certainly his daughter Esther--a young girl, not yet\nnineteen--had not found them either, for after her father's death she\nwent to live in one of the poorer quarters of Paris, alone with an old\nand faithful servant named Lucienne. And while the Committee of Public\nSafety was deliberating whether it would be worth while to send Esther\nto the guillotine, to follow in her father's footsteps, a certain number\nof astute jail-birds plotted to obtain possession of her wealth.\n\nThe wealth existed, over in England; of that they were ready to take\ntheir oath, and the project which they had formed was as ingenious as it\nwas diabolic: to feign a denunciation, to enact a pretended arrest, to\nplace before the unfortunate girl the alternative of death or marriage\nwith one of the gang, were the chief incidents of this inquitous\nproject, and it was in the Cabaret de la Liberte that lots were thrown\nas to which among the herd of miscreants should be the favoured one to\nplay the chief role in the sinister drama.\n\nThe lot fell to Merri; but the whole gang was to have a share in the\nputative fortune--even Rateau, the wretched creature with the hacking\ncough, who looked as if he had one foot in the grave, and shivered as if\nhe were stricken with ague, put in a word now and again to remind his\ngood friend Merri that he, too, was looking forward to his share of the\nspoils. Merri, however, was inclined to repudiate him altogether.\n\n\"Why should I share with you?\" he said roughly, when, a few hours later,\nhe and Rateau parted in the street outside the Cabaret de la Liberte.\n\"Who are you, I would like to know, to try and poke your ugly nose into\nmy affairs? How do I know where you come from, and whether you are not\nsome crapulent spy of one of those pestilential committees?\"\n\nFrom which eloquent flow of language we may infer that the friendship\nbetween these two worthies was not of very old duration. Rateau would,\nno doubt, have protested loudly, but the fresh outer air had evidently\ncaught his wheezy lungs, and for a minute or two he could do nothing but\ncough and splutter and groan, and cling to his unresponsive comrade for\nsupport. Then at last, when he had succeeded in recovering his breath,\nhe said dolefully and with a ludicrous attempt at dignified reproach:\n\n\"Do not force me to remind you, citizen Merri, that if it had not been\nfor my suggestion that we should all draw lots, and then play hazard\nas to who shall be the chosen one to woo the ci-devant millionairess,\nthere would soon have been a free fight inside the cabaret, a number of\nbroken heads, and no decision whatever arrived at; whilst you, who were\nnever much of a fighter, would probably be lying now helpless, with a\nbroken nose, and deprived of some of your teeth, and with no chance of\nentering the lists for the heiress. Instead of which, here you are, the\nvictor by a stroke of good fortune, which you should at least have the\ngood grace to ascribe to me.\"\n\nWhether the poor wretch's argument had any weight with citizen Merri, or\nwhether that worthy patriot merely thought that procrastination would,\nfor the nonce, prove the best policy, it were impossible to say. Certain\nit is that in response to his companion's tirade he contented himself\nwith a dubious grunt, and without another word turned on his heel and\nwent slouching down the street.\n\n\nIII\n\nFor the persistent and optimistic romanticist, there were still one or\ntwo idylls to be discovered flourishing under the shadow of the grim and\nrelentless Revolution. One such was that which had Esther Vincent and\nJack Kennard for hero and heroine. Esther, the orphaned daughter of one\nof the richest bankers of pre-Revolution days, now a daily governess and\nhousehold drudge at ten francs a week in the house of a retired butcher\nin the Rue Richelieu, and Jack Kennard, formerly the representative of a\nbig English firm of woollen manufacturers, who had thrown up his\nemployment and prospects in England in order to watch over the girl whom\nhe loved. He, himself an alien enemy, an Englishman, in deadly danger of\nhis life every hour that he remained in France; and she, unwilling at\nthe time to leave the horrors of revolutionary Paris while her father\nwas lingering at the Conciergerie awaiting condemnation, as such\nforbidden to leave the city. So Kennard stayed on, unable to tear\nhimself away from her, and obtained an unlucrative post as accountant in\na small wine shop over by Montmartre. His life, like hers, was hanging\nby a thread; any day, any hour now, some malevolent denunciation might,\nin the sight of the Committee of Public Safety, turn the eighteen years\nold \"suspect\" into a living peril to the State, or the alien enemy into\na dangerous spy.\n\nSome of the happiest hours these two spent in one another's company were\nembittered by that ever-present dread of the peremptory knock at the\ndoor, the portentous: \"Open, in the name of the Law!\" the perquisition,\nthe arrest, to which the only issue, these days, was the guillotine.\n\nBut the girl was only just eighteen, and he not many years older, and at\nthat age, in spite of misery, sorrow, and dread, life always has its\ncompensations. Youth cries out to happiness so insistently that\nhappiness is forced to hear, and for a few moments, at the least, drives\ncare and even the bitterest anxiety away.\n\nFor Esther Vincent and her English lover there were moments when they\nbelieved themselves to be almost happy. It was in the evenings mostly,\nwhen she came home from her work and he was free to spend an hour or two\nwith her. Then old Lucienne, who had been Esther's nurse in the happy,\nolden days, and was an unpaid maid-of-all-work and a loved and trusted\nfriend now, would bring in the lamp and pull the well-darned curtains\nover the windows. She would spread a clean cloth upon the table and\nbring in a meagre supper of coffee and black bread, perhaps a little\nbutter or a tiny square of cheese. And the two young people would talk\nof the future, of the time when they would settle down in Kennard's old\nhome, over in England, where his mother and sister even now were eating\nout their hearts with anxiety for him.\n\n\"Tell me all about the South Downs,\" Esther was very fond of saying;\n\"and your village, and your house, and the rambler roses and the\nclematis arbour.\"\n\nShe never tired of hearing, or he of telling. The old Manor House,\nbought with his father's savings; the garden which was his mother's\nhobby; the cricket pitch on the village green. Oh, the cricket! She\nthought that so funny--the men in high, sugar-loaf hats, grown-up men,\nspending hours and hours, day after day, in banging at a ball with a\nwooden bat!\n\n\"Oh, Jack! The English are a funny, nice, dear, kind lot of people. I\nremember--\"\n\nShe remembered so well that happy summer which she had spent with her\nfather in England four years ago. It was after the Bastille had been\nstormed and taken, and the banker had journeyed to England with his\ndaughter in something of a hurry. Then her father had talked of\nreturning to France and leaving her behind with friends in England. But\nEsther would not be left. Oh, no! Even now she glowed with pride at the\nthought of her firmness in the matter. If she had remained in England\nshe would never have seen her dear father again. Here remembrances grew\nbitter and sad, until Jack's hand reached soothingly, consolingly out to\nher, and she brushed away her tears, so as not to sadden him still more.\n\nThen she would ask more questions about his home and his garden, about\nhis mother and the dogs and the flowers; and once more they would forget\nthat hatred and envy and death were already stalking their door.\n\n\nIV\n\n\"Open, in the name of the Law!\"\n\nIt had come at last. A bolt from out the serene blue of their happiness.\nA rough, dirty, angry, cursing crowd, who burst through the heavy door\neven before they had time to open it. Lucienne collapsed into a chair,\nweeping and lamenting, with her apron thrown over her head. But Esther\nand Kennard stood quite still and calm, holding one another by the hand,\njust to give one another courage.\n\nSome half dozen men stalked into the little room. Men? They looked like\nravenous beasts, and were unspeakably dirty, wore soiled tricolour\nscarves above their tattered breeches in token of their official status.\nTwo of them fell on the remnants of the meagre supper and devoured\neverything that remained on the table--bread, cheese, a piece of\nhome-made sausage. The others ransacked the two attic-rooms which had\nbeen home for Esther and Lucienne: the little living-room under the\nsloping roof, with the small hearth on which very scanty meals were wont\nto be cooked, and the bare, narrow room beyond, with the iron bedstead,\nand the palliasse on the floor for Lucienne.\n\nThe men poked about everywhere, struck great, spiked sticks through the\npoor bits of bedding, and ripped up the palliasse. They tore open the\ndrawers of the rickety chest and of the broken-down wardrobe, and did\nnot spare the unfortunate young girl a single humiliation or a single\nindignity.\n\nKennard, burning with wrath, tried to protest.\n\n\"Hold that cub!\" commanded the leader of the party, almost as soon as\nthe young Englishman's hot, indignant words had resounded above the din\nof overturned furniture. \"And if he opens his mouth again throw him into\nthe street!\" And Kennard, terrified lest he should be parted from\nEsther, thought it wiser to hold his peace.\n\nThey looked at one another, like two young trapped beasts--not\ndespairing, but trying to infuse courage one into the other by a look of\nconfidence and of love. Esther, in fact, kept her eyes fixed on her\ngood-looking English lover, firmly keeping down the shudder of loathing\nwhich went right through her when she saw those awful men coming nigh\nher. There was one especially whom she abominated worse than the others,\na bandy-legged ruffian, who regarded her with a leer that caused her an\nalmost physical nausea. He did not take part in the perquisition, but\nsat down in the centre of the room and sprawled over the table with the\nair of one who was in authority. The others addressed him as \"citizen\nMerri,\" and alternately ridiculed and deferred to him. And there was\nanother, equally hateful, a horrible, cadaverous creature, with huge\nbare feet thrust into sabots, and lank hair, thick with grime. He did\nmost of the talking, even though his loquacity occasionally broke down\nin a racking cough, which literally seemed to tear at his chest, and\nleft him panting, hoarse, and with beads of moisture upon his low,\npallid forehead.\n\nOf course, the men found nothing that could even remotely be termed\ncompromising. Esther had been very prudent in deference to Kennard's\nadvice; she also had very few possessions. Nevertheless, when the\nwretches had turned every article of furniture inside out, one of them\nasked curtly:\n\n\"What do we do next, citizen Merri?\"\n\n\"Do?\" broke in the cadaverous creature, even before Merri had time to\nreply. \"Do? Why, take the wench to--to--\"\n\nHe got no further, became helpless with coughing. Esther, quite\ninstinctively, pushed the carafe of water towards him.\n\n\"Nothing of the sort!\" riposted Merri sententiously. \"The wench stays\nhere!\"\n\nBoth Esther and Jack had much ado to suppress an involuntary cry of\nrelief, which at this unexpected pronouncement had risen to their lips.\n\nThe man with the cough tried to protest.\n\n\"But--\" he began hoarsely.\n\n\"I said, the wench stays here!\" broke in Merri peremptorily. \"Ah ca!\" he\nadded, with a savage imprecation. \"Do you command here, citizen Rateau,\nor do I?\"\n\nThe other at once became humble, even cringing.\n\n\"You, of course, citizen,\" he rejoined in his hollow voice. \"I would\nonly remark--\"\n\n\"Remark nothing,\" retorted the other curtly. \"See to it that the cub is\nout of the house. And after that put a sentry outside the wench's door.\nNo one to go in and out of here under any pretext whatever. Understand?\"\n\nKennard this time uttered a cry of protest. The helplessness of his\nposition exasperated him almost to madness. Two men were holding him\ntightly by his sinewy arms. With an Englishman's instinct for a fight,\nhe would not only have tried, but also succeeded in knocking these two\ndown, and taken the other four on after that, with quite a reasonable\nchance of success. That tuberculous creature, now! And that bandy-legged\nruffian! Jack Kennard had been an amateur middle-weight champion in his\nday, and these brutes had no more science than an enraged bull! But even\nas he fought against that instinct he realised the futility of a\nstruggle. The danger of it, too--not for himself, but for her. After\nall, they were not going to take her away to one of those awful places\nfrom which the only egress was the way to the guillotine; and if there\nwas that amount of freedom there was bound to be some hope. At twenty\nthere is always hope!\n\nSo when, in obedience to Merri's orders, the two ruffians began to drag\nhim towards the door, he said firmly:\n\n\"Leave me alone. I'll go without this unnecessary struggling.\"\n\nThen, before the wretches realised his intention, he had jerked himself\nfree from them and run to Esther.\n\n\"Have no fear,\" he said to her in English, and in a rapid whisper. \"I'll\nwatch over you. The house opposite. I know the people. I'll manage it\nsomehow. Be on the look-out.\"\n\nThey would not let him say more, and she only had the chance of\nresponding firmly: \"I am not afraid, and I'll be on the look-out.\" The\nnext moment Merri's compeers seized him from behind--four of them this\ntime.\n\nThen, of course, prudence went to the winds. He hit out to the right and\nleft. Knocked two of those recreants down, and already was prepared to\nseize Esther in his arms, make a wild dash for the door, and run with\nher, whither only God knew, when Rateau, that awful consumptive\nreprobate, crept slyly up behind him and dealt him a swift and heavy\nblow on the skull with his weighted stick. Kennard staggered, and the\nbandits closed upon him. Those on the floor had time to regain their\nfeet. To make assurance doubly sure, one of them emulated Rateau's\ntactics, and hit the Englishman once more on the head from behind. After\nthat, Kennard became inert; he had partly lost consciousness. His head\nached furiously. Esther, numb with horror, saw him bundled out of the\nroom. Rateau, coughing and spluttering, finally closed the door upon the\nunfortunate and the four brigands who had hold of him.\n\nOnly Merri and that awful Rateau had remained in the room. The latter,\ngasping for breath now, poured himself out a mugful of water and drank\nit down at one draught. Then he swore, because he wanted rum, or brandy,\nor even wine. Esther watched him and Merri, fascinated. Poor old\nLucienne was quietly weeping behind her apron.\n\n\"Now then, my wench,\" Merri began abruptly, \"suppose you sit down here\nand listen to what I have to say.\"\n\nHe pulled a chair close to him and, with one of those hideous leers\nwhich had already caused her to shudder, he beckoned her to sit. Esther\nobeyed as if in a dream. Her eyes were dilated like those of one in a\nwaking trance. She moved mechanically, like a bird attracted by a\nserpent, terrified, yet unresisting. She felt utterly helpless between\nthese two villainous brutes, and anxiety for her English lover seemed\nfurther to numb her senses. When she was sitting she turned her gaze,\nwith an involuntary appeal for pity, upon the bandy-legged ruffian\nbeside her. He laughed.\n\n\"No! I am not going to hurt you,\" he said with smooth condescension,\nwhich was far more loathsome to Esther's ears than his comrades' savage\noaths had been. \"You are pretty and you have pleased me. 'Tis no small\nmatter, forsooth!\" he added, with loud-voiced bombast, \"to have earned\nthe good-will of citizen Merri. You, my wench, are in luck's way. You\nrealise what has occurred just now. You are amenable to the law which\nhas decreed you to be suspect. I hold an order for your arrest. I can\nhave you seized at once by my men, dragged to the Conciergerie, and from\nthence nothing can save you--neither your good looks nor the protection\nof citizen Merri. It means the guillotine. You understand that, don't\nyou?\"\n\nShe sat quite still; only her hands were clutched convulsively together.\nBut she contrived to say quite firmly:\n\n\"I do, and I am not afraid.\"\n\nMerri waved a huge and very dirty hand with a careless gesture.\n\n\"I know,\" he said with a harsh laugh. \"They all say that, don't they,\ncitizen Rateau?\"\n\n\"Until the time comes,\" assented that worthy dryly.\n\n\"Until the time comes,\" reiterated the other. \"Now, my wench,\" he added,\nonce more turning to Esther, \"I don't want that time to come. I don't\nwant your pretty head to go rolling down into the basket, and to receive\nthe slap on the face which the citizen executioner has of late taken to\nbestowing on those aristocratic cheeks which Mme. la Guillotine has\nfinally blanched for ever. Like this, you see.\"\n\nAnd the inhuman wretch took up one of the round cushions from the\nnearest chair, held it up at arm's length, as if it were a head which he\nheld by the hair, and then slapped it twice with the palm of his left\nhand. The gesture was so horrible and withal so grotesque, that Esther\nclosed her eyes with a shudder, and her pale cheeks took on a leaden\nhue. Merri laughed aloud and threw the cushion down again.\n\n\"Unpleasant, what? my pretty wench! Well, you know what to expect ...\nunless,\" he added significantly, \"you are reasonable and will listen to\nwhat I am about to tell you.\"\n\nEsther was no fool, nor was she unsophisticated. These were not times\nwhen it was possible for any girl, however carefully nurtured and\ntenderly brought up, to remain ignorant of the realities and the\nbrutalities of life. Even before Merri had put his abominable\nproposition before her, she knew what he was driving at.\nMarriage--marriage to him! that ignoble wretch, more vile than any dumb\ncreature! In exchange for her life!\n\nIt was her turn now to laugh. The very thought of it was farcical in its\nvery odiousness. Merri, who had embarked on his proposal with\ngrandiloquent phraseology, suddenly paused, almost awed by that strange,\nhysterical laughter.\n\n\"By Satan and all his ghouls!\" he cried, and jumped to his feet, his\ncheeks paling beneath the grime.\n\nThen rage seized him at his own cowardice. His egregious vanity, wounded\nby that laughter, egged him on. He tried to seize Esther by the waist.\nBut she, quick as some panther on the defence, had jumped up, too, and\npounced upon a knife--the very one she had been using for that happy\nlittle supper with her lover a brief half hour ago. Unguarded,\nunthinking, acting just with a blind instinct, she raised it and cried\nhoarsely:\n\n\"If you dare touch me, I'll kill you!\"\n\nIt was ludicrous, of course. A mouse threatening a tiger. The very next\nmoment Rateau had seized her hand and quietly taken away the knife.\nMerri shook himself like a frowsy dog.\n\n\"Whew!\" he ejaculated. \"What a vixen! But,\" he added lightly, \"I like\nher all the better for that--eh, Rateau? Give me a wench with a\ntemperament, I say!\"\n\nBut Esther, too, had recovered herself. She realised her helplessness,\nand gathered courage from the consciousness of it! Now she faced the\ninfamous villain more calmly.\n\n\"I will never marry you,\" she said loudly and firmly. \"Never! I am not\nafraid to die. I am not afraid of the guillotine. There is no shame\nattached to death. So now you may do as you please--denounce me, and\nsend me to follow in the footsteps of my dear father, if you wish. But\nwhilst I am alive you will never come nigh me. If you ever do but lay a\nfinger upon me, it will be because I am dead and beyond the reach of\nyour polluting touch. And now I have said all that I will ever say to\nyou in this life. If you have a spark of humanity left in you, you will,\nat least, let me prepare for death in peace.\"\n\nShe went round to where poor old Lucienne still sat, like an insentient\nlog, panic-stricken. She knelt down on the floor and rested her arm on\nthe old woman's knees. The light of the lamp fell full upon her, her\npale face, and mass of chestnut-brown hair. There was nothing about her\nat this moment to inflame a man's desire. She looked pathetic in her\nhelplessness, and nearly lifeless through the intensity of her pallor,\nwhilst the look in her eyes was almost maniacal.\n\nMerri cursed and swore, tried to hearten himself by turning on his\nfriend. But Rateau had collapsed--whether with excitement or the ravages\nof disease, it were impossible to say. He sat upon a low chair, his long\nlegs, his violet-circled eyes staring out with a look of hebetude and\noverwhelming fatigue. Merri looked around him and shuddered. The\natmosphere of the place had become strangely weird and uncanny; even the\ntablecloth, dragged half across the table, looked somehow like a shroud.\n\n\"What shall we do, Rateau?\" he asked tremulously at last.\n\n\"Get out of this infernal place,\" replied the other huskily. \"I feel as\nif I were in my grave-clothes already.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you miserable coward! You'll make the aristo think\nthat we are afraid.\"\n\n\"Well?\" queried Rateau blandly. \"Aren't you?\"\n\n\"No!\" replied Merri fiercely. \"I'll go now because ... because ... well!\nbecause I have had enough to-day. And the wench sickens me. I wish to\nserve the Republic by marrying her, but just now I feel as if I should\nnever really want her. So I'll go! But, understand!\" he added, and\nturned once more to Esther, even though he could not bring himself to go\nnigh her again. \"Understand that to-morrow I'll come again for my\nanswer. In the meanwhile, you may think matters over, and, maybe, you'll\narrive at a more reasonable frame of mind. You will not leave these\nrooms until I set you free. My men will remain as sentinels at your\ndoor.\"\n\nHe beckoned to Rateau, and the two men went out of the room without\nanother word.\n\n\nV\n\nThe whole of that night Esther remained shut up in her apartment in the\nPetite Rue Taranne. All night she heard the measured tramp, the\nmovements, the laughter and loud talking of men outside her door. Once\nor twice she tried to listen to what they said. But the doors and walls\nin these houses of old Paris were too stout to allow voices to filter\nthrough, save in the guise of a confused murmur. She would have felt\nhorribly lonely and frightened but for the fact that in one window on\nthe third floor in the house opposite the light of a lamp appeared like\na glimmer of hope. Jack Kennard was there, on the watch. He had the\nwindow open and sat beside it until a very late hour; and after that he\nkept the light in, as a beacon, to bid her be of good cheer.\n\nIn the middle of the night he made an attempt to see her, hoping to\ncatch the sentinels asleep or absent. But, having climbed the five\nstories of the house wherein she dwelt, he arrived on the landing\noutside her door and found there half a dozen ruffians squatting on the\nstone floor and engaged in playing hazard with a pack of greasy cards.\nThat wretched consumptive, Rateau, was with them, and made a facetious\nremark as Kennard, pale and haggard, almost ghostlike, with a white\nbandage round his head, appeared upon the landing.\n\n\"Go back to bed, citizen,\" the odious creature said, with a raucous\nlaugh. \"We are taking care of your sweetheart for you.\"\n\nNever in all his life had Jack Kennard felt so abjectly wretched as he\ndid then, so miserably helpless. There was nothing that he could do,\nsave to return to the lodging, which a kind friend had lent him for the\noccasion, and from whence he could, at any rate, see the windows behind\nwhich his beloved was watching and suffering.\n\nWhen he went a few moments ago, he had left the porte cochere ajar. Now\nhe pushed it open and stepped into the dark passage beyond. A tiny\nstreak of light filtrated through a small curtained window in the\nconcierge's lodge; it served to guide Kennard to the foot of the narrow\nstone staircase which led to the floors above. Just at the foot of the\nstairs, on the mat, a white paper glimmered in the dim shaft of light.\nHe paused, puzzled, quite certain that the paper was not there five\nminutes ago when he went out. Oh! it may have fluttered in from the\ncourtyard beyond, or from anywhere, driven by the draught. But, even so,\nwith that mechanical action peculiar to most people under like\ncircumstances, he stooped and picked up the paper, turned it over\nbetween his fingers, and saw that a few words were scribbled on it in\npencil. The light was too dim to read by, so Kennard, still quite\nmechanically, kept the paper in his hand and went up to his room. There,\nby the light of the lamp, he read the few words scribbled in pencil:\n\n\"Wait in the street outside.\"\n\nNothing more. The message was obviously not intended for him, and yet....\nA strange excitement possessed him. If it should be! If...! He had\nheard--everyone had--of the mysterious agencies that were at work, under\ncover of darkness, to aid the unfortunate, the innocent, the helpless.\nHe had heard of that legendary English gentleman who had before now\ndefied the closest vigilance of the Committees, and snatched their\nintended victims out of their murderous clutches, at times under their\nvery eyes.\n\nIf this should be...! He scarce dared put his hope into words. He could\nnot bring himself really to believe. But he went. He ran downstairs and\nout into the street, took his stand under a projecting doorway nearly\nopposite the house which held the woman he loved, and leaning against\nthe wall, he waited.\n\nAfter many hours--it was then past three o'clock in the morning, and the\nsky of an inky blackness--he felt so numb that despite his will a kind\nof trance-like drowsiness overcame him. He could no longer stand on his\nfeet; his knees were shaking; his head felt so heavy that he could not\nkeep it up. It rolled round from shoulder to shoulder, as if his will no\nlonger controlled it. And it ached furiously. Everything around him was\nvery still. Even \"Paris-by-Night,\" that grim and lurid giant, was for\nthe moment at rest. A warm summer rain was falling; its gentle,\npattering murmur into the gutter helped to lull Kennard's senses into\nsomnolence. He was on the point of dropping off to sleep when something\nsuddenly roused him. A noise of men shouting and laughing--familiar\nsounds enough in these squalid Paris streets.\n\nBut Kennard was wide awake now; numbness had given place to intense\nquivering of all his muscles, and super-keenness of his every sense. He\npeered into the darkness and strained his ears to hear. The sound\ncertainly appeared to come from the house opposite, and there, too, it\nseemed as if something or things were moving. Men! More than one or two,\nsurely! Kennard thought that he could distinguish at least three\ndistinct voices; and there was that weird, racking cough which\nproclaimed the presence of Rateau.\n\nNow the men were quite close to where he--Kennard--still stood cowering.\nA minute or two later they had passed down the street. Their hoarse\nvoices soon died away in the distance. Kennard crept cautiously out of\nhis hiding-place. Message or mere coincidence, he now blessed that\nmysterious scrap of paper. Had he remained in his room, he might really\nhave dropped off to sleep and not heard these men going away. There were\nthree of them at least--Kennard thought four. But, anyway, the number of\nwatch-dogs outside the door of his beloved had considerably diminished.\nHe felt that he had the strength to grapple with them, even if there\nwere still three of them left. He, an athlete, English, and master of\nthe art of self-defence; and they, a mere pack of drink-sodden brutes!\nYes! He was quite sure he could do it. Quite sure that he could force\nhis way into Esther's rooms and carry her off in his arms--whither? God\nalone knew. And God alone would provide.\n\nJust for a moment he wondered if, while he was in that state of\nsomnolence, other bandits had come to take the place of those that were\ngoing. But this thought he quickly dismissed. In any case, he felt a\ngiant's strength in himself, and could not rest now till he had tried\nonce more to see her. He crept very cautiously along; was satisfied that\nthe street was deserted.\n\nAlready he had reached the house opposite, had pushed open the porte\ncochere, which was on the latch--when, without the slightest warning, he\nwas suddenly attacked from behind, his arms seized and held behind his\nback with a vice-like grip, whilst a vigorous kick against the calves of\nhis legs caused him to lose his footing and suddenly brought him down,\nsprawling and helpless, in the gutter, while in his ear there rang the\nhideous sound of the consumptive ruffian's racking cough.\n\n\"What shall we do with the cub now?\" a raucous voice came out of the\ndarkness.\n\n\"Let him lie there,\" was the quick response. \"It'll teach him to\ninterfere with the work of honest patriots.\"\n\nKennard, lying somewhat bruised and stunned, heard this decree with\nthankfulness. The bandits obviously thought him more hurt than he was,\nand if only they would leave him lying here, he would soon pick himself\nup and renew his attempt to go to Esther. He did not move, feigning\nunconsciousness, even though he felt rather than saw that hideous Rateau\nstooping over him, heard his stertorous breathing, the wheezing in his\nthroat.\n\n\"Run and fetch a bit of cord, citizen Desmonts,\" the wretch said\npresently. \"A trussed cub is safer than a loose one.\"\n\nThis dashed Kennard's hopes to a great extent. He felt that he must act\nquickly, before those brigands returned and rendered him completely\nhelpless. He made a movement to rise--a movement so swift and sudden as\nonly a trained athlete can make. But, quick as he was, that odious,\nwheezing creature was quicker still, and now, when Kennard had turned on\nhis back, Rateau promptly sat on his chest, a dead weight, with long\nlegs stretched out before him, coughing and spluttering, yet wholly at\nhis ease.\n\nOh! the humiliating position for an amateur middle-weight champion to\nfind himself in, with that drink-sodden--Kennard was sure that he was\ndrink-sodden--consumptive sprawling on the top of him!\n\n\"Don't trouble, citizen Desmonts,\" the wretch cried out after his\nretreating companions. \"I have what I want by me.\"\n\nVery leisurely he pulled a coil of rope out of the capacious pocket of\nhis tattered coat. Kennard could not see what he was doing, but felt it\nwith supersensitive instinct all the time. He lay quite still beneath\nthe weight of that miscreant, feigning unconsciousness, yet hardly able\nto breathe. That tuberculous caitiff was such a towering weight. But he\ntried to keep his faculties on the alert, ready for that surprise spring\nwhich would turn the tables, at the slightest false move on the part of\nRateau.\n\nBut, as luck would have it, Rateau did not make a single false move. It\nwas amazing with what dexterity he kept Kennard down, even while he\ncontrived to pinion him with cords. An old sailor, probably, he seemed\nso dexterous with knots.\n\nMy God! the humiliation of it all. And Esther a helpless prisoner,\ninside that house not five paces away! Kennard's heavy, wearied eyes\ncould perceive the light in her window, five stories above where he lay,\nin the gutter, a helpless log. Even now he gave a last desperate shriek:\n\n\"Esther!\"\n\nBut in a second the abominable brigand's hand came down heavily upon his\nmouth, whilst a raucous voice spluttered rather than said, right through\nan awful fit of coughing:\n\n\"Another sound, and I'll gag as well as bind you, you young fool!\"\n\nAfter which, Kennard remained quite still.\n\n\nVI\n\nEsther, up in her little attic, knew nothing of what her English lover\nwas even then suffering for her sake. She herself had passed, during the\nnight, through every stage of horror and of fear. Soon after midnight\nthat execrable brigand Rateau had poked his ugly, cadaverous face in at\nthe door and peremptorily called for Lucienne. The woman, more dead than\nalive now with terror, had answered with mechanical obedience.\n\n\"I and my friends are thirsty,\" the man had commanded. \"Go and fetch us\na litre of eau-de-vie.\"\n\nPoor Lucienne stammered a pitiable: \"Where shall I go?\"\n\n\"To the house at the sign of 'Le fort Samson,' in the Rue de Seine,\"\nreplied Rateau curtly. \"They'll serve you well if you mention my name.\"\n\nOf course Lucienne protested. She was a decent woman, who had never been\ninside a cabaret in her life.\n\n\"Then it's time you began,\" was Rateau's dry comment, which was greeted\nwith much laughter from his abominable companions.\n\nLucienne was forced to go. It would, of course, have been futile and\nmadness to resist. This had occurred three hours since. The Rue de Seine\nwas not far, but the poor woman had not returned. Esther was left with\nthis additional horror weighing upon her soul. What had happened to her\nunfortunate servant? Visions of outrage and murder floated before the\npoor girl's tortured brain. At best, Lucienne was being kept out of the\nway in order to make her--Esther--feel more lonely and desperate! She\nremained at the window after that, watching that light in the house\nopposite and fingering her prayer-book, the only solace which she had.\nHer attic was so high up and the street so narrow, that she could not\nsee what went on in the street below. At one time she heard a great\nto-do outside her door. It seemed as if some of the bloodhounds who were\nset to watch her had gone, or that others came. She really hardly cared\nwhich it was. Then she heard a great commotion coming from the street\nimmediately beneath her: men shouting and laughing, and that awful\ncreature's rasping cough.\n\nAt one moment she felt sure that Kennard had called to her by name. She\nheard his voice distinctly, raised as if in a despairing cry.\n\nAfter that, all was still.\n\nSo still that she could hear her heart beating furiously, and then a\ntear falling from her eyes upon her open book. So still that the gentle\npatter of the rain sounded like a soothing lullaby. She was very young,\nand was very tired. Out, above the line of sloping roofs and chimney\npots, the darkness of the sky was yielding to the first touch of dawn.\nThe rain ceased. Everything became deathly still. Esther's head fell,\nwearied, upon her folded arms.\n\nThen, suddenly, she was wide awake. Something had roused her. A noise.\nAt first she could not tell what it was, but now she knew. It was the\nopening and shutting of the door behind her, and then a quick, stealthy\nfootstep across the room. The horror of it all was unspeakable. Esther\nremained as she had been, on her knees, mechanically fingering her\nprayer-book, unable to move, unable to utter a sound, as if paralysed.\nShe knew that one of those abominable creatures had entered her room,\nwas coming near her even now. She did not know who it was, only guessed\nit was Rateau, for she heard a raucous, stertorous wheeze. Yet she could\nnot have then turned to look if her life had depended upon her doing so.\n\nThe whole thing had occurred in less than half a dozen heart-beats. The\nnext moment the wretch was close to her. Mercifully she felt that her\nsenses were leaving her. Even so, she felt that a handkerchief was being\nbound over her mouth to prevent her screaming. Wholly unnecessary this,\nfor she could not have uttered a sound. Then she was lifted off the\nground and carried across the room, then over the threshold. A vague,\nsubconscious effort of will helped her to keep her head averted from\nthat wheezing wretch who was carrying her. Thus she could see the\nlanding, and two of those abominable watchdogs who had been set to guard\nher.\n\nThe ghostly grey light of dawn came peeping in through the narrow dormer\nwindow in the sloping roof, and faintly illumined their sprawling forms,\nstretched out at full length, with their heads buried in their folded\narms and their naked legs looking pallid and weird in the dim light.\nTheir stertorous breathing woke the echoes of the bare, stone walls.\nEsther shuddered and closed her eyes. She was now like an insentient\nlog, without power, or thought, or will--almost without feeling.\n\nThen, all at once, the coolness of the morning air caught her full in\nthe face. She opened her eyes and tried to move, but those powerful arms\nheld her more closely than before. Now she could have shrieked with\nhorror. With returning consciousness the sense of her desperate position\ncame on her with its full and ghastly significance, its awe-inspiring\ndetails. The grey dawn, the abandoned wretch who held her, and the\nstillness of this early morning hour, when not one pitying soul would be\nastir to lend her a helping hand or give her the solace of mute\nsympathy. So great, indeed, was this stillness that the click of the\nman's sabots upon the uneven pavement reverberated, ghoul-like and\nweird.\n\nAnd it was through that awesome stillness that a sound suddenly struck\nher ear, which, in the instant, made her feel that she was not really\nalive, or, if alive, was sleeping and dreaming strange and impossible\ndreams. It was the sound of a voice, clear and firm, and with a\nwonderful ring of merriment in its tones, calling out just above a\nwhisper, and in English, if you please:\n\n\"Look out, Ffoulkes! That young cub is as strong as a horse. He will\ngive us all away if you are not careful.\"\n\nA dream? Of course it was a dream, for the voice had sounded very close\nto her ear; so close, in fact, that ... well! Esther was quite sure that\nher face still rested against the hideous, tattered, and grimy coat\nwhich that repulsive Rateau had been wearing all along. And there was\nthe click of his sabots upon the pavement all the time. So, then, the\nvoice and the merry, suppressed laughter which accompanied it, must all\nhave been a part of her dream. How long this lasted she could not have\ntold you. An hour and more, she thought, while the grey dawn yielded to\nthe roseate hue of morning. Somehow, she no longer suffered either\nterror or foreboding. A subtle atmosphere of strength and of security\nseemed to encompass her. At one time she felt as if she were driven\nalong in a car that jolted horribly, and when she moved her face and\nhands they came in contact with things that were fresh and green and\nsmelt of the country. She was in darkness then, and more than three\nparts unconscious, but the handkerchief had been removed from her mouth.\nIt seemed to her as if she could hear the voice of her Jack, but far\naway and indistinct; also the tramp of horses' hoofs and the creaking of\ncart-wheels, and at times that awful, rasping cough, which reminded her\nof the presence of a loathsome wretch, who should not have had a part in\nher soothing dream.\n\nThus many hours must have gone by.\n\nThen, all at once, she was inside a house--a room, and she felt that she\nwas being lowered very gently to the ground. She was on her feet, but\nshe could not see where she was. There was furniture; a carpet; a\nceiling; the man Rateau with the sabots and the dirty coat, and the\nmerry English voice, and a pair of deep-set blue eyes, thoughtful and\nlazy and infinitely kind.\n\nBut before she could properly focus what she saw, everything began to\nwhirl and to spin around her, to dance a wild and idiotic saraband,\nwhich caused her to laugh, and to laugh, until her throat felt choked\nand her eyes hot; after which she remembered nothing more.\n\n\nVII\n\nThe first thing of which Esther Vincent was conscious, when she returned\nto her senses, was of her English lover kneeling beside her. She was\nlying on some kind of couch, and she could see his face in profile, for\nhe had turned and was speaking to someone at the far end of the room.\n\n\"And was it you who knocked me down?\" he was saying, \"and sat on my\nchest, and trussed me like a fowl?\"\n\n\"La! my dear sir,\" a lazy, pleasant voice riposted, \"what else could I\ndo? There was no time for explanations. You were half-crazed, and would\nnot have understood. And you were ready to bring all the nightwatchmen\nabout our ears.\"\n\n\"I am sorry!\" Kennard said simply. \"But how could I guess?\"\n\n\"You couldn't,\" rejoined the other. \"That is why I had to deal so\nsummarily with you and with Mademoiselle Esther, not to speak of good\nold Lucienne, who had never, in her life, been inside a cabaret. You\nmust all forgive me ere you start upon your journey. You are not out of\nthe wood yet, remember. Though Paris is a long way behind, France itself\nis no longer a healthy place for any of you.\"\n\n\"But how did we ever get out of Paris? I was smothered under a pile of\ncabbages, with Lucienne on one side of me and Esther, unconscious, on\nthe other. I could see nothing. I know we halted at the barrier. I\nthought we would be recognised, turned back! My God! how I trembled!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" broke in the other, with a careless laugh. \"It is not so\ndifficult as it seems. We have done it before--eh, Ffoulkes? A\nmarket-gardener's cart, a villainous wretch like myself to drive it,\nanother hideous object like Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, Bart., to lead the\nscraggy nag, a couple of forged or stolen passports, plenty of English\ngold, and the deed is done!\"\n\nEsther's eyes were fixed upon the speaker. She marvelled now how she\ncould have been so blind. The cadaverous face was nothing but a splendid\nuse of grease paint! The rags! the dirt! the whole assumption of a\nhideous character was masterly! But there were the eyes, deep-set, and\nthoughtful and kind. How did she fail to guess?\n\n\"You are known as the Scarlet Pimpernel,\" she said suddenly. \"Suzanne de\nTournai was my friend. She told me. You saved her and her family, and\nnow ... oh, my God!\" she exclaimed, \"how shall we ever repay you?\"\n\n\"By placing yourselves unreservedly in my friend Ffoulkes' hands,\" he\nreplied gently. \"He will lead you to safety and, if you wish it, to\nEngland.\"\n\n\"If we wish it!\" Kennard sighed fervently.\n\n\"You are not coming with us, Blakeney?\" queried Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, and\nit seemed to Esther's sensitive ears as if a tone of real anxiety and\nalso of entreaty rang in the young man's voice.\n\n\"No, not this time,\" replied Sir Percy lightly. \"I like my character of\nRateau, and I don't want to give it up just yet. I have done nothing to\narouse suspicion in the minds of my savoury compeers up at the Cabaret\nde la Liberte. I can easily keep this up for some time to come, and\nfrankly I admire myself as citizen Rateau. I don't know when I have\nenjoyed a character so much!\"\n\n\"You mean to return to the Cabaret de la Liberte!\" exclaimed Sir Andrew.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You will be recognised!\"\n\n\"Not before I have been of service to a good many unfortunates, I hope.\"\n\n\"But that awful cough of yours! Percy, you'll do yourself an injury with\nit one day.\"\n\n\"Not I! I like that cough. I practised it for a long time before I did\nit to perfection. Such a splendid wheeze! I must teach Tony to do it\nsome day. Would you like to hear it now?\"\n\nHe laughed, that perfect, delightful, lazy laugh of his, which carried\nevery hearer with it along the path of light-hearted merriment. Then he\nbroke into the awful cough of the consumptive Rateau. And Esther Vincent\ninstinctively closed her eyes and shuddered.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\"NEEDS MUST--\"\n\n\nI\n\nThe children were all huddled up together in one corner of the room.\nEtienne and Valentine, the two eldest, had their arms round the little\none. As for Lucile, she would have told you herself that she felt just\nlike a bird between two snakes--terrified and fascinated--oh! especially\nby that little man with the pale face and the light grey eyes and the\nslender white hands unstained by toil, one of which rested lightly upon\nthe desk, and was only clenched now and then at a word or a look from\nthe other man or from Lucile herself.\n\nBut Commissary Lebel just tried to browbeat her. It was not difficult,\nfor in truth she felt frightened enough already, with all this talk of\n\"traitors\" and that awful threat of the guillotine.\n\nLucile Clamette, however, would have remained splendidly loyal in spite\nof all these threats, if it had not been for the children. She was\nlittle mother to them; for father was a cripple, with speech and mind\nalready impaired by creeping paralysis, and maman had died when little\nJosephine was born. And now those fiends threatened not only her, but\nEtienne who was not fourteen, and Valentine who was not much more than\nten, with death, unless she--Lucile--broke the solemn word which she had\ngiven to M. le Marquis. At first she had tried to deny all knowledge of\nM. le Marquis' whereabouts.\n\n\"I can assure M. le Commissaire that I do not know,\" she had persisted\nquietly, even though her heart was beating so rapidly in her bosom that\nshe felt as if she must choke.\n\n\"Call me citizen Commissary,\" Lebel had riposted curtly. \"I should take\nit as a proof that your aristocratic sentiments are not so deep-rooted\nas they appear to be.\"\n\n\"Yes, citizen!\" murmured Lucile, under her breath.\n\nThen the other one, he with the pale eyes and the slender white hands,\nleaned forward over the desk, and the poor girl felt as if a mighty and\nunseen force was holding her tight, so tight that she could neither\nmove, nor breathe, nor turn her gaze away from those pale, compelling\neyes. In the remote corner little Josephine was whimpering, and\nEtienne's big, dark eyes were fixed bravely upon his eldest sister.\n\n\"There, there! little citizeness,\" the awful man said, in a voice that\nsounded low and almost caressing, \"there is nothing to be frightened of.\nNo one is going to hurt you or your little family. We only want you to\nbe reasonable. You have promised to your former employer that you would\nnever tell anyone of his whereabouts. Well! we don't ask you to tell us\nanything.\n\n\"All that we want you to do is to write a letter to M. le Marquis--one\nthat I myself will dictate to you. You have written to M. le Marquis\nbefore now, on business matters, have you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur--yes, citizen,\" stammered Lucile through her tears.\n\"Father was bailiff to M. le Marquis until he became a cripple and now\nI---\"\n\n\"Do not write any letter, Lucile,\" Etienne suddenly broke in with\nforceful vehemence. \"It is a trap set by these miscreants to entrap M.\nle Marquis.\"\n\nThere was a second's silence in the room after this sudden outburst on\nthe part of the lad. Then the man with the pale face said quietly:\n\n\"Citizen Lebel, order the removal of that boy. Let him be kept in\ncustody till he has learned to hold his tongue.\"\n\nBut before Lebel could speak to the two soldiers who were standing on\nguard at the door, Lucile had uttered a loud cry of agonised protest.\n\n\"No! no! monsieur!--that is citizen!\" she implored. \"Do not take Etienne\naway. He will be silent.... I promise you that he will be silent ...\nonly do not take him away! Etienne, my little one!\" she added, turning\nher tear-filled eyes to her brother, \"I entreat thee to hold thy\ntongue!\"\n\nThe others, too, clung to Etienne, and the lad, awed and subdued,\nrelapsed into silence.\n\n\"Now then,\" resumed Lebel roughly, after a while, \"let us get on with\nthis business. I am sick to death of it. It has lasted far too long\nalready.\"\n\nHe fixed his blood-shot eyes upon Lucile and continued gruffly:\n\n\"Now listen to me, my wench, for this is going to be my last word.\nCitizen Chauvelin here has already been very lenient with you by\nallowing this letter business. If I had my way I'd make you speak here\nand now. As it is, you either sit down and write the letter at citizen\nChauvelin's dictation at once, or I send you with that impudent brother\nof yours and your imbecile father to jail, on a charge of treason\nagainst the State, for aiding and abetting the enemies of the Republic;\nand you know what the consequences of such a charge usually are. The\nother two brats will go to a House of Correction, there to be detained\nduring the pleasure of the Committee of Public Safety. That is my last\nword,\" he reiterated fiercely. \"Now, which is it to be?\"\n\nHe paused, the girl's wan cheeks turned the colour of lead. She\nmoistened her lips once or twice with her tongue; beads of perspiration\nappeared at the roots of her hair. She gazed helplessly at her\ntormentors, not daring to look on those three huddled-up little figures\nthere in the corner. A few seconds sped away in silence. The man with\nthe pale eyes rose and pushed his chair away. He went to the window,\nstood there with his back to the room, those slender white hands of his\nclasped behind him. Neither the commissary nor the girl appeared to\ninterest him further. He was just gazing out of the window.\n\nThe other was still sprawling beside the desk, his large, coarse\nhand--how different his hands were!--was beating a devil's tatoo upon\nthe arm of his chair.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Lucile made a violent effort to compose herself,\nwiped the moisture from her pallid forehead and dried the tears which\nstill hung upon her lashes. Then she rose from her chair and walked\nresolutely up to the desk.\n\n\"I will write the letter,\" she said simply.\n\nLebel gave a snort of satisfaction; but the other did not move from his\nposition near the window. The boy, Etienne, had uttered a cry of\npassionate protest.\n\n\"Do not give M. le Marquis away, Lucile!\" he said hotly. \"I am not\nafraid to die.\"\n\nBut Lucile had made up her mind. How could she do otherwise, with these\nawful threats hanging over them all? She and Etienne and poor father\ngone, and the two young ones in one of those awful Houses of Correction,\nwhere children were taught to hate the Church, to shun the Sacraments,\nand to blaspheme God!\n\n\"What am I to write?\" she asked dully, resolutely closing her ears\nagainst her brother's protest.\n\nLebel pushed pen, ink and paper towards her and she sat down, ready to\nbegin.\n\n\"Write!\" now came in a curt command from the man at the window. And\nLucile wrote at his dictation:\n\n     \"MONSIEUR LE MARQUIS,--We are in grave trouble. My brother Etienne\n     and I have been arrested on a charge of treason. This means the\n     guillotine for us and for poor father, who can no longer speak; and\n     the two little ones are to be sent to one of those dreadful Houses\n     of Correction, where children are taught to deny God and to\n     blaspheme. You alone can save us, M. le Marquis; and I beg you on\n     my knees to do it. The citizen Commissary here says that you have\n     in your possession certain papers which are of great value to the\n     State, and that if I can persuade you to give these up, Etienne,\n     father and I and the little ones will be left unmolested. M. le\n     Marquis, you once said that you could never adequately repay my\n     poor father for all his devotion in your service. You can do it\n     now, M. le Marquis, by saving us all. I will be at the chateau a\n     week from to-day. I entreat you, M. le Marquis, to come to me then\n     and to bring the papers with you; or if you can devise some other\n     means of sending the papers to me, I will obey your behests.--I am,\n     M. le Marquis' faithful and devoted servant,\n\n     LUCILE CLAMETTE.\"\n\nThe pen dropped from the unfortunate girl's fingers. She buried her face\nin her hands and sobbed convulsively. The children were silent, awed and\nsubdued--tired out, too. Only Etienne's dark eyes were fixed upon his\nsister with a look of mute reproach.\n\nLebel had made no attempt to interrupt the flow of his colleague's\ndictation. Only once or twice did a hastily smothered \"What the---!\" of\nastonishment escape his lips. Now, when the letter was finished and duly\nsigned, he drew it to him and strewed the sand over it. Chauvelin, more\nimpassive than ever, was once more gazing out of the window.\n\n\"How are the ci-devant aristos to get this letter?\" the commissary\nasked.\n\n\"It must be put in the hollow tree which stands by the side of the\nstable gate at Montorgueil,\" whispered Lucile.\n\n\"And the aristos will find it there?\"\n\n\"Yes. M. le Vicomte goes there once or twice a week to see if there is\nanything there from one of us.\"\n\n\"They are in hiding somewhere close by, then?\"\n\nBut to this the girl gave no reply. Indeed, she felt as if any word now\nmight choke her.\n\n\"Well, no matter where they are!\" the inhuman wretch resumed, with\nbrutal cynicism. \"We've got them now--both of them. Marquis! Vicomte!\"\nhe added, and spat on the ground to express his contempt of such titles.\n\"Citizens Montorgueil, father and son--that's all they are! And as such\nthey'll walk up in state to make their bow to Mme. la Guillotine!\"\n\n\"May we go now?\" stammered Lucile through her tears.\n\nLebel nodded in assent, and the girl rose and turned to walk towards the\ndoor. She called to the children, and the little ones clustered round\nher skirts like chicks around the mother-hen. Only Etienne remained\naloof, wrathful against his sister for what he deemed her treachery.\n\"Women have no sense of honour!\" he muttered to himself, with all the\npride of conscious manhood. But Lucile felt more than ever like a bird\nwho is vainly trying to evade the clutches of a fowler. She gathered the\ntwo little ones around her. Then, with a cry like a wounded doe she ran\nquickly out of the room.\n\n\nII\n\nAs soon as the sound of the children's footsteps had died away down the\ncorridor, Lebel turned with a grunt to his still silent companion.\n\n\"And now, citizen Chauvelin,\" he said roughly, \"perhaps you will be good\nenough to explain what is the meaning of all this tomfoolery.\"\n\n\"Tomfoolery, citizen?\" queried the other blandly. \"What tomfoolery,\npray?\"\n\n\"Why, about those papers!\" growled Lebel savagely. \"Curse you for an\ninterfering busybody! It was I who got information that those\npestilential aristos, the Montorgueils, far from having fled the country\nare in hiding somewhere in my district. I could have made the girl give\nup their hiding-place pretty soon, without any help from you. What right\nhad you to interfere, I should like to know?\"\n\n\"You know quite well what right I had, citizen Lebel,\" replied Chauvelin\nwith perfect composure. \"The right conferred upon me by the Committee of\nPublic Safety, of whom I am still an unworthy member. They sent me down\nhere to lend you a hand in an investigation which is of grave importance\nto them.\"\n\n\"I know that!\" retorted Lebel sulkily. \"But why have invented the story\nof the papers?\"\n\n\"It is no invention, citizen,\" rejoined Chauvelin with slow emphasis.\n\"The papers do exist. They are actually in the possession of the\nMontorgueils, father and son. To capture the two aristos would be not\nonly a blunder, but criminal folly, unless we can lay hands on the\npapers at the same time.\"\n\n\"But what in Satan's name are those papers?\" ejaculated Lebel with a\nfierce oath.\n\n\"Think, citizen Lebel! Think!\" was Chauvelin's cool rejoinder. \"Methinks\nyou might arrive at a pretty shrewd guess.\" Then, as the other's bluster\nand bounce suddenly collapsed upon his colleague's calm, accusing gaze,\nthe latter continued with impressive deliberation:\n\n\"The papers which the two aristos have in their possession, citizen, are\nreceipts for money, for bribes paid to various members of the Committee\nof Public Safety by Royalist agents for the overthrow of our glorious\nRepublic. You know all about them, do you not?\"\n\nWhile Chauvelin spoke, a look of furtive terror had crept into Lebel's\neyes; his cheeks became the colour of lead. But even so, he tried to\nkeep up an air of incredulity and of amazement.\n\n\"I?\" he exclaimed. \"What do you mean, citizen Chauvelin? What should I\nknow about it?\"\n\n\"Some of those receipts are signed with your name, citizen Lebel,\"\nretorted Chauvelin forcefully. \"Bah!\" he added, and a tone of savage\ncontempt crept into his even, calm voice now. \"Heriot, Foucquier, Ducros\nand the whole gang of you are in it up to the neck: trafficking with our\nenemies, trading with England, taking bribes from every quarter for\nworking against the safety of the Republic. Ah! if I had my way, I would\nlet the hatred of those aristos take its course. I would let the\nMontorgueils and the whole pack of Royalist agents publish those\ninfamous proofs of your treachery and of your baseness to the entire\nworld, and send the whole lot of you to the guillotine!\"\n\nHe had spoken with so much concentrated fury, and the hatred and\ncontempt expressed in his pale eyes were so fierce that an involuntary\nice-cold shiver ran down the length of Lebel's spine. But, even so, he\nwould not give in; he tried to sneer and to keep up something of his\nformer surly defiance.\n\n\"Bah!\" he exclaimed, and with a lowering glance gave hatred for hatred,\nand contempt for contempt. \"What can you do? An I am not mistaken, there\nis no more discredited man in France to-day than the unsuccessful\ntracker of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\nThe taunt went home. It was Chauvelin's turn now to lose countenance, to\npale to the lips. The glow of virtuous indignation died out of his eyes,\nhis look became furtive and shamed.\n\n\"You are right, citizen Lebel,\" he said calmly after a while.\n\"Recriminations between us are out of place. I am a discredited man, as\nyou say. Perhaps it would have been better if the Committee had sent me\nlong ago to expiate my failures on the guillotine. I should at least not\nhave suffered, as I am suffering now, daily, hourly humiliation at\nthought of the triumph of an enemy, whom I hate with a passion which\nconsumes my very soul. But do not let us speak of me,\" he went on\nquietly. \"There are graver affairs at stake just now than mine own.\"\n\nLebel said nothing more for the moment. Perhaps he was satisfied at the\nsuccess of his taunt, even though the terror within his craven soul\nstill caused the cold shiver to course up and down his spine. Chauvelin\nhad once more turned to the window; his gaze was fixed upon the distance\nfar away. The window gave on the North. That way, in a straight line,\nlay Calais, Boulogne, England--where he had been made to suffer such\nbitter humiliation at the hands of his elusive enemy. And immediately\nbefore him was Paris, where the very walls seemed to echo that mocking\nlaugh of the daring Englishman which would haunt him even to his grave.\n\nLebel, unnerved by his colleague's silence, broke in gruffly at last:\n\n\"Well then, citizen,\" he said, with a feeble attempt at another sneer,\n\"if you are not thinking of sending us all to the guillotine just yet,\nperhaps you will be good enough to explain just how the matter stands?\"\n\n\"Fairly simply, alas!\" replied Chauvelin dryly. \"The two Montorgueils,\nfather and son, under assumed names, were the Royalist agents who\nsucceeded in suborning men such as you, citizen--the whole gang of you.\nWe have tracked them down, to this district, have confiscated their\nlands and ransacked the old chateau for valuables and so on. Two days\nlater, the first of a series of pestilential anonymous letters reached\nthe Committee of Public Safety, threatening the publication of a whole\nseries of compromising documents if the Marquis and the Vicomte de\nMontorgueil were in any way molested, and if all the Montorgueil\nproperty is not immediately restored.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is quite certain that those receipts and documents do\nexist?\" suggested Lebel.\n\n\"Perfectly certain. One of the receipts, signed by Heriot, was sent as a\nspecimen.\"\n\n\"My God!\" ejaculated Lebel, and wiped the cold sweat from his brow.\n\n\"Yes, you'll all want help from somewhere,\" retorted Chauvelin coolly.\n\"From above or from below, what? if the people get to know what\nmiscreants you are. I do believe,\" he added, with a vicious snap of his\nthin lips, \"that they would cheat the guillotine of you and, in the end,\ndrag you out of the tumbrils and tear you to pieces limb from limb!\"\n\nOnce more that look of furtive terror crept into the commissary's\nbloodshot eyes.\n\n\"Thank the Lord,\" he muttered, \"that we were able to get hold of the\nwench Clamette!\"\n\n\"At my suggestion,\" retorted Chauvelin curtly. \"I always believe in\nthreatening the weak if you want to coerce the strong. The Montorgueils\ncannot resist the wench's appeal. Even if they do at first, we can apply\nthe screw by clapping one of the young ones in gaol. Within a week we\nshall have those papers, citizen Lebel; and if, in the meanwhile, no one\ncommits a further blunder, we can close the trap on the Montorgueils\nwithout further trouble.\"\n\nLebel said nothing more, and after a while Chauvelin went back to the\ndesk, picked up the letter which poor Lucile had written and watered\nwith her tears, folded it deliberately and slipped it into the inner\npocket of his coat.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" queried Lebel anxiously.\n\n\"Drop this letter into the hollow tree by the side of the stable gate at\nMontorgueil,\" replied Chauvelin simply.\n\n\"What?\" exclaimed the other. \"Yourself?\"\n\n\"Why, of course! Think you I would entrust such an errand to another\nliving soul?\"\n\n\nIII\n\nA couple of hours later, when the two children had had their dinner and\nhad settled down to play in the garden, and father been cosily tucked up\nfor his afternoon sleep, Lucile called her brother Etienne to her. The\nboy had not spoken to her since that terrible time spent in the presence\nof those two awful men. He had eaten no dinner, only sat glowering,\nstaring straight out before him, from time to time throwing a look of\nburning reproach upon his sister. Now, when she called to him, he tried\nto run away, was halfway up the stairs before she could seize hold of\nhim.\n\n\"Etienne, mon petit!\" she implored, as her arms closed around his\nshrinking figure.\n\n\"Let me go, Lucile!\" the boy pleaded obstinately.\n\n\"Mon petit, listen to me!\" she pleaded. \"All is not lost, if you will\nstand by me.\"\n\n\"All is lost, Lucile!\" Etienne cried, striving to keep back a flood of\npassionate tears. \"Honour is lost. Your treachery has disgraced us all.\nIf M. le Marquis and M. le Vicomte are brought to the guillotine, their\nblood will be upon our heads.\"\n\n\"Upon mine alone, my little Etienne,\" she said sadly. \"But God alone can\njudge me. It was a terrible alternative: M. le Marquis, or you and\nValentine and little Josephine and poor father, who is so helpless! But\ndon't let us talk of it. All is not lost, I am sure. The last time that\nI spoke with M. le Marquis--it was in February, do you remember?--he was\nfull of hope, and oh! so kind. Well, he told me then that if ever I or\nany of us here were in such grave trouble that we did not know where to\nturn, one of us was to put on our very oldest clothes, look as like a\nbare-footed beggar as we could, and then go to Paris to a place called\nthe Cabaret de la Liberte in the Rue Christine. There we were to ask for\nthe citizen Rateau, and we were to tell him all our troubles, whatever\nthey might be. Well! we are in such trouble now, mon petit, that we\ndon't know where to turn. Put on thy very oldest clothes, little one,\nand run bare-footed into Paris, find the citizen Rateau and tell him\njust what has happened: the letter which they have forced me to write,\nthe threats which they held over me if I did not write it--everything.\nDost hear?\"\n\nAlready the boy's eyes were glowing. The thought that he individually\ncould do something to retrieve the awful shame of his sister's treachery\nspurred him to activity. It needed no persuasion on Lucile's part to\ninduce him to go. She made him put on some old clothes and stuffed a\npiece of bread and cheese into his breeches pocket.\n\nIt was close upon a couple of leagues to Paris, but that run was one of\nthe happiest which Etienne had ever made. And he did it bare-footed,\ntoo, feeling neither fatigue nor soreness, despite the hardness of the\nroad after a two weeks' drought, which had turned mud into hard cakes\nand ruts into fissures which tore the lad's feet till they bled.\n\nHe did not reach the Cabaret de la Liberte till nightfall, and when he\ngot there he hardly dared to enter. The filth, the squalor, the hoarse\nvoices which rose from that cellar-like place below the level of the\nstreet, repelled the country-bred lad. Were it not for the desperate\nurgency of his errand he never would have dared to enter. As it was, the\nfumes of alcohol and steaming, dirty clothes nearly choked him, and he\ncould scarce stammer the name of \"citizen Rateau\" when a gruff voice\npresently demanded his purpose.\n\nHe realised now how tired he was and how hungry. He had not thought to\npause in order to consume the small provision of bread and cheese\nwherewith thoughtful Lucile had provided him. Now he was ready to faint\nwhen a loud guffaw, which echoed from one end of the horrible place to\nthe other, greeted his timid request.\n\n\"Citizen Rateau!\" the same gruff voice called out hilariously. \"Why,\nthere he is! Here, citizen! there's a blooming aristo to see you.\"\n\nEtienne turned his weary eyes to the corner which was being indicated to\nhim. There he saw a huge creature sprawling across a bench, with long,\npowerful limbs stretched out before him. Citizen Rateau was clothed,\nrather than dressed, in a soiled shirt, ragged breeches and tattered\nstockings, with shoes down at heel and faded crimson cap. His face\nlooked congested and sunken about the eyes; he appeared to be asleep,\nfor stertorous breathing came at intervals from between his parted lips,\nwhilst every now and then a racking cough seemed to tear at his broad\nchest.\n\nEtienne gave him one look, shuddering with horror, despite himself, at\nthe aspect of this bloated wretch from whom salvation was to come. The\nwhole place seemed to him hideous and loathsome in the extreme. What it\nall meant he could not understand; all that he knew was that this seemed\nlike another hideous trap into which he and Lucile had fallen, and that\nhe must fly from it--fly at all costs, before he betrayed M. le Marquis\nstill further to these drink-sodden brutes. Another moment, and he\nfeared that he might faint. The din of a bibulous song rang in his ears,\nthe reek of alcohol turned him giddy and sick. He had only just enough\nstrength to turn and totter back into the open. There his senses reeled,\nthe lights in the houses opposite began to dance wildly before his eyes,\nafter which he remembered nothing more.\n\n\nIV\n\nThere is nothing now in the whole countryside quite so desolate and\nforlorn as the chateau of Montorgueil, with its once magnificent park,\nnow overgrown with weeds, its encircling walls broken down, its terraces\ndevastated, and its stately gates rusty and torn.\n\nJust by the side of what was known in happier times as the stable gate\nthere stands a hollow tree. It is not inside the park, but just outside,\nand shelters the narrow lane, which skirts the park walls, against the\nblaze of the afternoon sun.\n\nIts beneficent shade is a favourite spot for an afternoon siesta, for\nthere is a bit of green sward under the tree, and all along the side of\nthe road. But as the shades of evening gather in, the lane is usually\ndeserted, shunned by the neighbouring peasantry on account of its eerie\nloneliness, so different to the former bustle which used to reign around\nthe park gates when M. le Marquis and his family were still in\nresidence. Nor does the lane lead anywhere, for it is a mere loop which\ngives on the main road at either end.\n\nHenri de Montorgueil chose a peculiarly dark night in mid-September for\none of his periodical visits to the hollow-tree. It was close on nine\no'clock when he passed stealthily down the lane, keeping close to the\npark wall. A soft rain was falling, the first since the prolonged\ndrought, and though it made the road heavy and slippery in places, it\nhelped to deaden the sound of the young man's furtive footsteps. The\nair, except for the patter of the rain, was absolutely still. Henri de\nMontorgueil paused from time to time, with neck craned forward, every\nsense on the alert, listening, like any poor, hunted beast, for the\nslightest sound which might betray the approach of danger.\n\nAs many a time before, he reached the hollow tree in safety, felt for\nand found in the usual place the letter which the unfortunate girl\nLucile had written to him. Then, with it in his hand, he turned to the\nstable gate. It had long since ceased to be kept locked and barred.\nPillaged and ransacked by order of the Committee of Public Safety, there\nwas nothing left inside the park walls worth keeping under lock and key.\n\nHenri slipped stealthily through the gates and made his way along the\ndrive. Every stone, every nook and cranny of his former home was\nfamiliar to him, and anon he turned into a shed where in former times\nwheelbarrows and garden tools were wont to be kept. Now it was full of\ndebris, lumber of every sort. A more safe or secluded spot could not be\nimagined. Henri crouched in the furthermost corner of the shed. Then\nfrom his belt he detached a small dark lanthorn, opened its shutter, and\nwith the aid of the tiny, dim light read the contents of the letter. For\na long while after that he remained quite still, as still as a man who\nhas received a stunning blow on the head and has partly lost\nconsciousness. The blow was indeed a staggering one. Lucile Clamette,\nwith the invincible power of her own helplessness, was demanding the\nsurrender of a weapon which had been a safeguard for the Montorgueils\nall this while. The papers which compromised a number of influential\nmembers of the Committee of Public Safety had been the most perfect arms\nof defence against persecution and spoliation.\n\nAnd now these were to be given up: Oh! there could be no question of\nthat. Even before consulting with his father, Henri knew that the papers\nwould have to be given up. They were clever, those revolutionaries. The\nthought of holding innocent children as hostages could only have\noriginated in minds attuned to the villainies of devils. But it was\nunthinkable that the children should suffer.\n\nAfter a while the young man roused himself from the torpor into which\nthe suddenness of this awful blow had plunged him. By the light of the\nlanthorn he began to write upon a sheet of paper which he had torn from\nhis pocket-book.\n\n\"MY DEAR LUCILE,\" he wrote, \"As you say, our debt to your father and to\nyou all never could be adequately repaid. You and the children shall\nnever suffer whilst we have the power to save you. You will find the\npapers in the receptacle you know of inside the chimney of what used to\nbe my mother's boudoir. You will find the receptacle unlocked. One day\nbefore the term you name I myself will place the papers there for you.\nWith them, my father and I do give up our lives to save you and the\nlittle ones from the persecution of those fiends. May the good God guard\nyou all.\"\n\nHe signed the letter with his initials, H. de M. Then he crept back to\nthe gate and dropped the message into the hollow of the tree.\n\nA quarter of an hour later Henri de Montorgueil was wending his way back\nto the hiding place which had sheltered him and his father for so long.\nSilence and darkness then held undisputed sway once more around the\nhollow tree. Even the rain had ceased its gentle pattering. Anon from\nfar away came the sound of a church bell striking the hour of ten. Then\nnothing more.\n\nA few more minutes of absolute silence, then something dark and furtive\nbegan to move out of the long grass which bordered the\nroadside--something that in movement was almost like a snake. It dragged\nitself along close to the ground, making no sound as it moved. Soon it\nreached the hollow tree, rose to the height of a man and flattened\nitself against the tree-trunk. Then it put out a hand, felt for the\nhollow receptacle and groped for the missive which Henri de Montorgueil\nhad dropped in there a while ago.\n\nThe next moment a tiny ray of light gleamed through the darkness like a\nstar. A small, almost fragile, figure of a man, dressed in the\nmud-stained clothes of a country yokel, had turned up the shutter of a\nsmall lanthorn. By its flickering light he deciphered the letter which\nHenri de Montorgueil had written to Lucile Clamette.\n\n\"One day before the term you name I myself will place the papers there\nfor you.\"\n\nA sigh of satisfaction, quickly suppressed, came through his thin,\ncolourless lips, and the light of the lanthorn caught the flash of\ntriumph in his pale, inscrutable eyes.\n\nThen the light was extinguished. Impenetrable darkness swallowed up that\nslender, mysterious figure again.\n\n\nV\n\nSix days had gone by since Chauvelin had delivered his cruel\n\"either--or\" to poor little Lucile Clamette; three since he had found\nHenri de Montorgueil's reply to the girl's appeal in the hollow of the\ntree. Since then he had made a careful investigation of the chateau, and\nsoon was able to settle it in his own mind as to which room had been\nMadame la Marquise's boudoir in the past. It was a small apartment,\nhaving direct access on the first landing of the staircase, and the one\nwindow gave on the rose garden at the back of the house. Inside the\nmonumental hearth, at an arm's length up the wide chimney, a receptacle\nhad been contrived in the brickwork, with a small iron door which opened\nand closed with a secret spring. Chauvelin, whom his nefarious calling\nhad rendered proficient in such matters, had soon mastered the workings\nof that spring. He could now open and close the iron door at will.\n\nUp to a late hour on the sixth night of this weary waiting, the\nreceptacle inside the chimney was still empty. That night Chauvelin had\ndetermined to spend at the chateau. He could not have rested elsewhere.\n\nEven his colleague Lebel could not know what the possession of those\npapers would mean to the discredited agent of the Committee of Public\nSafety. With them in his hands, he could demand rehabilitation, and\ncould purchase immunity from those sneers which had been so galling to\nhis arrogant soul--sneers which had become more and more marked, more\nand more unendurable, and more and more menacing, as he piled up failure\non failure with every encounter with the Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nImmunity and rehabilitation! This would mean that he could once more\nmeasure his wits and his power with that audacious enemy who had brought\nabout his downfall.\n\n\"In the name of Satan, bring us those papers!\" Robespierre himself had\ncried with unwonted passion, ere he sent him out on this important\nmission. \"We none of us could stand the scandal of such disclosures. It\nwould mean absolute ruin for us all.\"\n\nAnd Chauvelin that night, as soon as the shades of evening had drawn in,\ntook up his stand in the chateau, in the small inner room which was\ncontiguous to the boudoir.\n\nHere he sat, beside the open window, for hour upon hour, his every sense\non the alert, listening for the first footfall upon the gravel path\nbelow. Though the hours went by leaden-footed, he was neither excited\nnor anxious. The Clamette family was such a precious hostage that the\nMontorgueils were bound to comply with Lucile's demand for the papers by\nevery dictate of honour and of humanity.\n\n\"While we have those people in our power,\" Chauvelin had reiterated to\nhimself more than once during the course of his long vigil, \"even that\nmeddlesome Scarlet Pimpernel can do nothing to save those cursed\nMontorgueils.\"\n\nThe night was dark and still. Not a breath of air stirred the branches\nof the trees or the shrubberies in the park; any footsteps, however\nwary, must echo through that perfect and absolute silence. Chauvelin's\nkeen, pale eyes tried to pierce the gloom in the direction whence in all\nprobability the aristo would come. Vaguely he wondered if it would be\nHenri de Montorgueil or the old Marquis himself who would bring the\npapers.\n\n\"Bah! whichever one it is,\" he muttered, \"we can easily get the other,\nonce those abominable papers are in our hands. And even if both the\naristos escape,\" he added mentally, \"'tis no matter, once we have the\npapers.\"\n\nAnon, far away a distant church bell struck the midnight hour. The\nstillness of the air had become oppressive. A kind of torpor born of\nintense fatigue lulled the Terrorist's senses to somnolence. His head\nfell forward on his breast....\n\n\nVI\n\nThen suddenly a shiver of excitement went right through him. He was\nfully awake now, with glowing eyes wide open and the icy calm of perfect\nconfidence ruling every nerve. The sound of stealthy footsteps had\nreached his ear.\n\nHe could see nothing, either outside or in; but his fingers felt for the\npistol which he carried in his belt. The aristo was evidently alone;\nonly one solitary footstep was approaching the chateau.\n\nChauvelin had left the door ajar which gave on the boudoir. The\nstaircase was on the other side of that fateful room, and the door\nleading to that was closed. A few minutes of tense expectancy went by.\nThen through the silence there came the sound of furtive foot-steps on\nthe stairs, the creaking of a loose board and finally the stealthy\nopening of the door.\n\nIn all his adventurous career Chauvelin had never felt so calm. His\nheart beat quite evenly, his senses were undisturbed by the slightest\ntingling of his nerves. The stealthy sounds in the next room brought the\nmovements of the aristo perfectly clear before his mental vision. The\nlatter was carrying a small dark lanthorn. As soon as he entered he\nflashed its light about the room. Then he deposited the lanthorn on the\nfloor, close beside the hearth, and started to feel up the chimney for\nthe hidden receptacle.\n\nChauvelin watched him now like a cat watches a mouse, savouring these\nfew moments of anticipated triumph. He pushed open the door noiselessly\nwhich gave on the boudoir. By the feeble light of the lanthorn on the\nground he could only see the vague outline of the aristo's back, bending\nforward to his task; but a thrill went through him as he saw a bundle of\npapers lying on the ground close by.\n\nEverything was ready; the trap was set. Here was a complete victory at\nlast. It was obviously the young Vicomte de Montorgueil who had come to\ndo the deed. His head was up the chimney even now. The old Marquis's\nback would have looked narrower and more fragile. Chauvelin held his\nbreath; then he gave a sharp little cough, and took the pistol from his\nbelt.\n\nThe sound caused the aristo to turn, and the next moment a loud and\nmerry laugh roused the dormant echoes of the old chateau, whilst a\npleasant, drawly voice said in English:\n\n\"I am demmed if this is not my dear old friend M. Chambertin! Zounds,\nsir! who'd have thought of meeting you here?\"\n\nHad a cannon suddenly exploded at Chauvelin's feet he would, I think,\nhave felt less unnerved. For the space of two heart-beats he stood\nthere, rooted to the spot, his eyes glued on his arch-enemy, that\nexecrated Scarlet Pimpernel, whose mocking glance, even through the\nintervening gloom, seemed to have deprived him of consciousness. But\nthat phase of helplessness only lasted for a moment; the next, all the\nmarvellous possibilities of this encounter flashed through the\nTerrorist's keen mind.\n\nEverything was ready; the trap was set! The unfortunate Clamettes were\nstill the bait which now would bring a far more noble quarry into the\nmesh than even he--Chauvelin--had dared to hope.\n\nHe raised his pistol, ready to fire. But already Sir Percy Blakeney was\non him, and with a swift movement, which the other was too weak to\nresist, he wrenched the weapon from his enemy's grasp.\n\n\"Why, how hasty you are, my dear M. Chambertin,\" he said lightly.\n\"Surely you are not in such a hurry to put a demmed bullet into me!\"\n\nThe position now was one which would have made even a braver man than\nChauvelin quake. He stood alone and unarmed in face of an enemy from\nwhom he could expect no mercy. But, even so, his first thought was not\nof escape. He had not only apprised his own danger, but also the immense\npower which he held whilst the Clamettes remained as hostages in the\nhands of his colleague Lebel.\n\n\"You have me at a disadvantage, Sir Percy,\" he said, speaking every whit\nas coolly as his foe. \"But only momentarily. You can kill me, of course;\nbut if I do not return from this expedition not only safe and sound, but\nwith a certain packet of papers in my hands, my colleague Lebel has\ninstructions to proceed at once against the girl Clamette and the whole\nfamily.\"\n\n\"I know that well enough,\" rejoined Sir Percy with a quaint laugh. \"I\nknow what venomous reptiles you and those of your kidney are. You\ncertainly do owe your life at the present moment to the unfortunate girl\nwhom you are persecuting with such infamous callousness.\"\n\nChauvelin drew a sigh of relief. The situation was shaping itself more\nto his satisfaction already. Through the gloom he could vaguely discern\nthe Englishman's massive form standing a few paces away, one hand buried\nin his breeches pockets, the other still holding the pistol. On the\nground close by the hearth was the small lanthorn, and in its dim light\nthe packet of papers gleamed white and tempting in the darkness.\nChauvelin's keen eyes had fastened on it, saw the form of receipt for\nmoney with Heriot's signature, which he recognised, on the top.\n\nHe himself had never felt so calm. The only thing he could regret was\nthat he was alone. Half a dozen men now, and this impudent foe could\nindeed be brought to his knees. And this time there would be no risks\ntaken, no chances for escape. Somehow it seemed to Chauvelin as if\nsomething of the Scarlet Pimpernel's audacity and foresight had gone\nfrom him. As he stood there, looking broad and physically powerful,\nthere was something wavering and undecided in his attitude, as if the\nedge had been taken off his former recklessness and enthusiasm. He had\nbrought the compromising papers here, had no doubt helped the\nMontorgueils to escape; but while Lucile Clamette and her family were\nunder the eye of Lebel no amount of impudence could force a successful\nbargaining.\n\nIt was Chauvelin now who appeared the more keen and the more alert; the\nEnglishman seemed undecided what to do next, remained silent, toying\nwith the pistol. He even smothered a yawn. Chauvelin saw his\nopportunity. With the quick movement of a cat pouncing upon a mouse he\nstooped and seized that packet of papers, would then and there have made\na dash for the door with them, only that, as he seized the packet, the\nstring which held it together gave way and the papers were scattered all\nover the floor.\n\nReceipts for money? Compromising letters? No! Blank sheets of paper, all\nof them--all except the one which had lain tantalisingly on the top: the\none receipt signed by citizen Heriot. Sir Percy laughed lightly:\n\n\"Did you really think, my good friend,\" he said, \"that I would be such a\ndemmed fool as to place my best weapon so readily to your hand?\"\n\n\"Your best weapon, Sir Percy!\" retorted Chauvelin, with a sneer. \"What\nuse is it to you while we hold Lucile Clamette?\"\n\n\"While I hold Lucile Clamette, you mean, my dear Monsieur Chambertin,\"\nriposted Blakeney with elaborate blandness.\n\n\"You hold Lucile Clamette? Bah! I defy you to drag a whole family like\nthat out of our clutches. The man a cripple, the children helpless! And\nyou think they can escape our vigilance when all our men are warned! How\ndo you think they are going to get across the river, Sir Percy, when\nevery bridge is closely watched? How will they get across Paris, when at\nevery gate our men are on the look-out for them?\"\n\n\"They can't do it, my dear Monsieur Chambertin,\" rejoined Sir Percy\nblandly, \"else I were not here.\"\n\nThen, as Chauvelin, fuming, irritated despite himself, as he always was\nwhen he encountered that impudent Englishman, shrugged his shoulders in\ntoken of contempt, Blakeney's powerful grasp suddenly clutched his arm.\n\n\"Let us understand one another, my good M. Chambertin,\" he said coolly.\n\"Those unfortunate Clamettes, as you say, are too helpless and too\nnumerous to smuggle across Paris with any chance of success. Therefore I\nlook to you to take them under your protection. They are all stowed away\ncomfortably at this moment in a conveyance which I have provided for\nthem. That conveyance is waiting at the bridgehead now. We could not\ncross without your help; we could not get across Paris without your\naugust presence and your tricolour scarf of office. So you are coming\nwith us, my dear M. Chambertin,\" he continued, and, with force which was\nquite irresistible, he began to drag his enemy after him towards the\ndoor. \"You are going to sit in that conveyance with the Clamettes, and I\nmyself will have the honour to drive you. And at every bridgehead you\nwill show your pleasing countenance and your scarf of office to the\nguard and demand free passage for yourself and your family, as a\nrepresentative member of the Committee of Public Safety. And then we'll\nenter Paris by the Porte d'Ivry and leave it by the Batignolles; and\neverywhere your charming presence will lull the guards' suspicions to\nrest. I pray you, come! There is no time to consider! At noon to-morrow,\nwithout a moment's grace, my friend Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, who has the\npapers in his possession, will dispose of them as he thinks best unless\nI myself do claim them from him.\"\n\nWhile he spoke he continued to drag his enemy along with him, with an\nassurance and an impudence which were past belief. Chauvelin was trying\nto collect his thoughts; a whirl of conflicting plans were running riot\nin his mind. The Scarlet Pimpernel in his power! At any point on the\nroad he could deliver him up to the nearest guard ... then still hold\nthe Clamettes and demand the papers....\n\n\"Too late, my dear Monsieur Chambertin!\" Sir Percy's mocking voice broke\nin, as if divining his thoughts. \"You do not know where to find my\nfriend Ffoulkes, and at noon to-morrow, if I do not arrive to claim\nthose papers, there will not be a single ragamuffin in Paris who will\nnot be crying your shame and that of your precious colleagues upon the\nhousetops.\"\n\nChauvelin's whole nervous system was writhing with the feeling of\nimpotence. Mechanically, unresisting now, he followed his enemy down the\nmain staircase of the chateau and out through the wide open gates. He\ncould not bring himself to believe that he had been so completely\nfoiled, that this impudent adventurer had him once more in the hollow of\nhis hand.\n\n\"In the name of Satan, bring us back those papers!\" Robespierre had\ncommanded. And now he--Chauvelin--was left in a maze of doubt; and the\nvital alternative was hammering in his brain: \"The Scarlet Pimpernel--or\nthose papers---\" Which, in Satan's name, was the more important? Passion\nwhispered \"The Scarlet Pimpernel!\" but common sense and the future of\nhis party, the whole future of the Revolution mayhap, demanded those\ncompromising papers. And all the while he followed that relentless enemy\nthrough the avenues of the park and down the lonely lane. Overhead the\ntrees of the forest of Sucy, nodding in a gentle breeze, seemed to mock\nhis perplexity.\n\nHe had not arrived at a definite decision when the river came in sight,\nand when anon a carriage lanthorn threw a shaft of dim light through the\nmist-laden air. Now he felt as if he were in a dream. He was thrust\nunresisting into a closed chaise, wherein he felt the presence of\nseveral other people--children, an old man who was muttering\nceaselessly. As in a dream he answered questions at the bridge to a\nguard whom he knew well.\n\n\"You know me--Armand Chauvelin, of the Committee of Public Safety!\"\n\nAs in a dream, he heard the curt words of command:\n\n\"Pass on, in the name of the Republic!\"\n\nAnd all the while the thought hammered in his brain: \"Something must be\ndone! This is impossible! This cannot be! It is not I--Chauvelin--who am\nsitting here, helpless, unresisting. It is not that impudent Scarlet\nPimpernel who is sitting there before me on the box, driving me to utter\nhumiliation!\"\n\nAnd yet it was all true. All real. The Clamette children were sitting in\nfront of him, clinging to Lucile, terrified of him even now. The old man\nwas beside him--imbecile and not understanding. The boy Etienne was up\non the box next to that audacious adventurer, whose broad back appeared\nto Chauvelin like a rock on which all his hopes and dreams must for ever\nbe shattered.\n\nThe chaise rattled triumphantly through the Batignolles. It was then\nbroad daylight. A brilliant early autumn day after the rains. The sun,\nthe keen air, all mocked Chauvelin's helplessness, his humiliation. Long\nbefore noon they passed St. Denis. Here the barouche turned off the main\nroad, halted at a small wayside house--nothing more than a cottage.\nAfter which everything seemed more dreamlike than ever. All that\nChauvelin remembered of it afterwards was that he was once more alone in\na room with his enemy, who had demanded his signature to a number of\nsafe-conducts, ere he finally handed over the packet of papers to him.\n\n\"How do I know that they are all here?\" he heard himself vaguely\nmuttering, while his trembling fingers handled that precious packet.\n\n\"That's just it!\" his tormentor retorted airily. \"You don't know. I\ndon't know myself,\" he added, with a light laugh. \"And, personally, I\ndon't see how either of us can possibly ascertain. In the meanwhile, I\nmust bid you au revoir, my dear M. Chambertin. I am sorry that I cannot\nprovide you with a conveyance, and you will have to walk a league or\nmore ere you meet one, I fear me. We, in the meanwhile, will be well on\nour way to Dieppe, where my yacht, the Day Dream, lies at anchor, and I\ndo not think that it will be worth your while to try and overtake us. I\nthank you for the safe-conducts. They will make our journey exceedingly\npleasant. Shall I give your regards to M. le Marquis de Montorgueil or\nto M. le Vicomte? They are on board the Day Dream, you know. Oh! and I\nwas forgetting! Lady Blakeney desired to be remembered to you.\"\n\nThe next moment he was gone. Chauvelin, standing at the window of the\nwayside house, saw Sir Percy Blakeney once more mount the box of the\nchaise. This time he had Sir Andrew Ffoulkes beside him. The Clamette\nfamily were huddled together--happy and free--inside the vehicle. After\nwhich there was the usual clatter of horses' hoofs, the creaking of\nwheels, the rattle of chains. Chauvelin saw and heard nothing of that.\nAll that he saw at the last was Sir Percy's slender hand, waving him a\nlast adieu.\n\nAfter which he was left alone with his thoughts. The packet of papers\nwas in his hand. He fingered it, felt its crispness, clutched it with a\nfierce gesture, which was followed by a long-drawn-out sigh of intense\nbitterness.\n\nNo one would ever know what it had cost him to obtain these papers. No\none would ever know how much he had sacrificed of pride, revenge and\nhate in order to save a few shreds of his own party's honour.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nA BATTLE OF WITS\n\n\nWhat had happened was this:\n\nTournefort, one of the ablest of the many sleuth-hounds employed by the\nCommittee of Public Safety, was out during that awful storm on the night\nof the twenty-fifth. The rain came down as if it had been poured out of\nbuckets, and Tournefort took shelter under the portico of a tall,\ndilapidated-looking house somewhere at the back of St. Lazare. The night\nwas, of course, pitch dark, and the howling of the wind and beating of\nthe rain effectually drowned every other sound.\n\nTournefort, chilled to the marrow, had at first cowered in the angle of\nthe door, as far away from the draught as he could. But presently he\nspied the glimmer of a tiny light some little way up on his left, and\ntaking this to come from the concierge's lodge, he went cautiously along\nthe passage intending to ask for better shelter against the fury of the\nelements than the rickety front door afforded.\n\nTournefort, you must remember, was always on the best terms with every\nconcierge in Paris. They were, as it were, his subordinates; without\ntheir help he never could have carried on his unavowable profession\nquite so successfully. And they, in their turn, found it to their\nadvantage to earn the good-will of that army of spies, which the\nRevolutionary Government kept in its service, for the tracking down of\nall those unfortunates who had not given complete adhesion to their\ntyrannical and murderous policy.\n\nTherefore, in this instance, Tournefort felt no hesitation in claiming\nthe hospitality of the concierge of the squalid house wherein he found\nhimself. He went boldly up to the lodge. His hand was already on the\nlatch, when certain sounds which proceeded from the interior of the\nlodge caused him to pause and to bend his ear in order to listen. It was\nTournefort's metier to listen. What had arrested his attention was the\nsound of a man's voice, saying in a tone of deep respect:\n\n\"Bien, Madame la Comtesse, we'll do our best.\"\n\nNo wonder that the servant of the Committee of Public Safety remained at\nattention, no longer thought of the storm or felt the cold blast\nchilling him to the marrow. Here was a wholly unexpected piece of good\nluck. \"Madame la Comtesse!\" Peste! There were not many such left in\nParis these days. Unfortunately, the tempest of the wind and the rain\nmade such a din that it was difficult to catch every sound which came\nfrom the interior of the lodge. All that Tournefort caught definitely\nwere a few fragments of conversation.\n\n\"My good M. Bertin ...\" came at one time from a woman's voice. \"Truly I\ndo not know why you should do all this for me.\"\n\nAnd then again: \"All I possess in the world now are my diamonds. They\nalone stand between my children and utter destitution.\"\n\nThe man's voice seemed all the time to be saying something that sounded\ncheerful and encouraging. But his voice came only as a vague murmur to\nthe listener's ears. Presently, however, there came a word which set his\npulses tingling. Madame said something about \"Gentilly,\" and directly\nafterwards: \"You will have to be very careful, my dear M. Bertin. The\nchateau, I feel sure, is being watched.\"\n\nTournefort could scarce repress a cry of joy. \"Gentilly? Madame la\nComtesse? The chateau?\" Why, of course, he held all the necessary\nthreads already. The ci-devant Comte de Sucy--a pestilential aristo if\never there was one!--had been sent to the guillotine less than a\nfortnight ago. His chateau, situated just outside Gentilly, stood empty,\nit having been given out that the widow Sucy and her two children had\nescaped to England. Well! she had not gone apparently, for here she was,\nin the lodge of the concierge of a mean house in one of the desolate\nquarters of Paris, begging some traitor to find her diamonds for her,\nwhich she had obviously left concealed inside the chateau. What a haul\nfor Tournefort! What commendation from his superiors! The chances of a\nspeedy promotion were indeed glorious now! He blessed the storm and the\nrain which had driven him for shelter to this house, where a poisonous\nplot was being hatched to rob the people of valuable property, and to\naid a few more of those abominable aristos in cheating the guillotine of\ntheir traitorous heads.\n\nHe listened for a while longer, in order to get all the information that\nhe could on the subject of the diamonds, because he knew by experience\nthat those perfidious aristos, once they were under arrest, would sooner\nbite out their tongues than reveal anything that might be of service to\nthe Government of the people. But he learned little else. Nothing was\nrevealed of where Madame la Comtesse was in hiding, or how the diamonds\nwere to be disposed of once they were found. Tournefort would have given\nmuch to have at least one of his colleagues with him. As it was, he\nwould be forced to act single-handed and on his own initiative. In his\nown mind he had already decided that he would wait until Madame la\nComtesse came out of the concierge's lodge, and that he would follow her\nand apprehend her somewhere out in the open streets, rather than here\nwhere her friend Bertin might prove to be a stalwart as well as a\ndesperate man, ready with a pistol, whilst he--Tournefort--was unarmed.\nBertin, who had, it seemed, been entrusted with the task of finding the\ndiamonds, could then be shadowed and arrested in the very act of\nfilching property which by decree of the State belonged to the people.\n\nSo he waited patiently for a while. No doubt the aristo would remain\nhere under shelter until the storm had abated. Soon the sound of voices\ndied down, and an extraordinary silence descended on this miserable,\nabandoned corner of old Paris. The silence became all the more marked\nafter a while, because the rain ceased its monotonous pattering and the\nsoughing of the wind was stilled. It was, in fact, this amazing\nstillness which set citizen Tournefort thinking. Evidently the aristo\ndid not intend to come out of the lodge to-night. Well! Tournefort had\nnot meant to make himself unpleasant inside the house, or to have a\nquarrel just yet with the traitor Bertin, whoever he was; but his hand\nwas forced and he had no option.\n\nThe door of the lodge was locked. He tugged vigorously at the bell again\nand again, for at first he got no answer. A few minutes later he heard\nthe sound of shuffling footsteps upon creaking boards. The door was\nopened, and a man in night attire, with bare, thin legs and tattered\ncarpet slippers on his feet, confronted an exceedingly astonished\nservant of the Committee of Public Safety. Indeed, Tournefort thought\nthat he must have been dreaming, or that he was dreaming now. For the\nman who opened the door to him was well known to every agent of the\nCommittee. He was an ex-soldier who had been crippled years ago by the\nloss of one arm, and had held the post of concierge in a house in the\nRuelle du Paradis ever since. His name was Grosjean. He was very old,\nand nearly doubled up with rheumatism, had scarcely any hair on his head\nor flesh on his bones. At this moment he appeared to be suffering from a\ncold in the head, for his eyes were streaming and his narrow, hooked\nnose was adorned by a drop of moisture at its tip. In fact, poor old\nGrosjean looked more like a dilapidated scarecrow than a dangerous\nconspirator. Tournefort literally gasped at sight of him, and Grosjean\nuttered a kind of croak, intended, no doubt, for complete surprise.\n\n\"Citizen Tournefort!\" he exclaimed. \"Name of a dog! What are you doing\nhere at this hour and in this abominable weather? Come in! Come in!\" he\nadded, and, turning on his heel, he shuffled back into the inner room,\nand then returned carrying a lighted lamp, which he set upon the table.\n\"Amelie left a sup of hot coffee on the hob in the kitchen before she\nwent to bed. You must have a drop of that.\"\n\nHe was about to shuffle off again when Tournefort broke in roughly:\n\n\"None of that nonsense, Grosjean! Where are the aristos?\"\n\n\"The aristos, citizen?\" queried Grosjean, and nothing could have looked\nmore utterly, more ludicrously bewildered than did the old concierge at\nthis moment. \"What aristos?\"\n\n\"Bertin and Madame la Comtesse,\" retorted Tournefort gruffly. \"I heard\nthem talking.\"\n\n\"You have been dreaming, citizen Tournefort,\" the old man said, with a\nhusky little laugh. \"Sit down, and let me get you some coffee--\"\n\n\"Don't try and hoodwink me, Grosjean!\" Tournefort cried now in a sudden\naccess of rage. \"I tell you that I saw the light. I heard the aristos\ntalking. There was a man named Bertin, and a woman he called 'Madame la\nComtesse,' and I say that some devilish royalist plot is being hatched\nhere, and that you, Grosjean, will suffer for it if you try and shield\nthose aristos.\"\n\n\"But, citizen Tournefort,\" replied the concierge meekly, \"I assure you\nthat I have seen no aristos. The door of my bedroom was open, and the\nlamp was by my bedside. Amelie, too, has only been in bed a few minutes.\nYou ask her! There has been no one, I tell you--no one! I should have\nseen and heard them--the door was open,\" he reiterated pathetically.\n\n\"We'll soon see about that!\" was Tournefort's curt comment.\n\nBut it was his turn indeed to be utterly bewildered. He searched--none\ntoo gently--the squalid little lodge through and through, turned the\npaltry sticks of furniture over, hauled little Amelie, Grosjean's\ngranddaughter, out of bed, searched under the mattresses, and even poked\nhis head up the chimney.\n\nGrosjean watched him wholly unperturbed. These were strange times, and\nfriend Tournefort had obviously gone a little off his head. The worthy\nold concierge calmly went on getting the coffee ready. Only when\npresently Tournefort, worn out with anger and futile exertion, threw\nhimself, with many an oath, into the one armchair, Grosjean remarked\ncoolly:\n\n\"I tell you what I think it is, citizen. If you were standing just by\nthe door of the lodge you had the back staircase of the house\nimmediately behind you. The partition wall is very thin, and there is a\ndisused door just there also. No doubt the voices came from there. You\nsee, if there had been any aristos here,\" he added naively, \"they could\nnot have flown up the chimney, could they?\"\n\nThat argument was certainly unanswerable. But Tournefort was out of\ntemper. He roughly ordered Grosjean to bring the lamp and show him the\nback staircase and the disused door. The concierge obeyed without a\nmurmur. He was not in the least disturbed or frightened by all this\nblustering. He was only afraid that getting out of bed had made his cold\nworse. But he knew Tournefort of old. A good fellow, but inclined to be\nnoisy and arrogant since he was in the employ of the Government.\nGrosjean took the precaution of putting on his trousers and wrapping an\nold shawl round his shoulders. Then he had a final sip of hot coffee;\nafter which he picked up the lamp and guided Tournefort out of the\nlodge.\n\nThe wind had quite gone down by now. The lamp scarcely flickered as\nGrosjean held it above his head.\n\n\"Just here, citizen Tournefort,\" he said, and turned sharply to his\nleft. But the next sound which he uttered was a loud croak of\nastonishment.\n\n\"That door has been out of use ever since I've been here,\" he muttered.\n\n\"And it certainly was closed when I stood up against it,\" rejoined\nTournefort, with a savage oath, \"or, of course, I should have noticed\nit.\"\n\nClose to the lodge, at right angles to it, a door stood partially open.\nTournefort went through it, closely followed by Grosjean. He found\nhimself in a passage which ended in a cul de sac on his right; on the\nleft was the foot of the stairs. The whole place was pitch dark save for\nthe feeble light of the lamp. The cul de sac itself reeked of dirt and\nfustiness, as if it had not been cleaned or ventilated for years.\n\n\"When did you last notice that this door was closed?\" queried\nTournefort, furious with the sense of discomfiture, which he would have\nliked to vent on the unfortunate concierge.\n\n\"I have not noticed it for some days, citizen,\" replied Grosjean meekly.\n\"I have had a severe cold, and have not been outside my lodge since\nMonday last. But we'll ask Amelie!\" he added more hopefully.\n\nAmelie, however, could throw no light upon the subject. She certainly\nkept the back stairs cleaned and swept, but it was not part of her\nduties to extend her sweeping operations as far as the cul de sac. She\nhad quite enough to do as it was, with grandfather now practically\nhelpless. This morning, when she went out to do her shopping, she had\nnot noticed whether the disused door did or did not look the same as\nusual.\n\nGrosjean was very sorry for his friend Tournefort, who appeared vastly\nupset, but still more sorry for himself, for he knew what endless\ntrouble this would entail upon him.\n\nNor was the trouble slow in coming, not only on Grosjean, but on every\nlodger inside the house; for before half an hour had gone by Tournefort\nhad gone and come back, this time with the local commissary of police\nand a couple of agents, who had every man, woman and child in that house\nout of bed and examined at great length, their identity books\nsearchingly overhauled, their rooms turned topsy-turvy and their\nfurniture knocked about.\n\nIt was past midnight before all these perquisitions were completed. No\none dared to complain at these indignities put upon peaceable citizens\non the mere denunciation of an obscure police agent. These were times\nwhen every regulation, every command, had to be accepted without a\nmurmur. At one o'clock in the morning, Grosjean himself was thankful to\nget back to bed, having satisfied the commissary that he was not a\ndangerous conspirator.\n\nBut of anyone even remotely approaching the description of the ci-devant\nComtesse de Sucy, or of any man called Bertin, there was not the\nfaintest trace.\n\n\nII\n\nBut no feeling of discomfort ever lasted very long with citizen\nTournefort. He was a person of vast resource and great buoyancy of\ntemperament.\n\nTrue, he had not apprehended two exceedingly noxious aristos, as he had\nhoped to do; but he held the threads of an abominable conspiracy in his\nhands, and the question of catching both Bertin and Madame la Comtesse\nred-handed was only a question of time. But little time had been lost.\nThere was always someone to be found at the offices of the Committee of\nPublic Safety, which were open all night. It was possible that citizen\nChauvelin would be still there, for he often took on the night shift, or\nelse citizen Gourdon.\n\nIt was Gourdon who greeted his subordinate, somewhat ill-humouredly, for\nhe was indulging in a little sleep, with his toes turned to the fire, as\nthe night was so damp and cold. But when he heard Tournefort's story, he\nwas all eagerness and zeal.\n\n\"It is, of course, too late to do anything now,\" he said finally, after\nhe had mastered every detail of the man's adventures in the Ruelle du\nParadis; \"but get together half a dozen men upon whom you can rely, and\nby six o'clock in the morning, or even five, we'll be on our way to\nGentilly. Citizen Chauvelin was only saying to-day that he strongly\nsuspected the ci-devant Comtesse de Sucy of having left the bulk of her\nvaluable jewellery at the chateau, and that she would make some effort\nto get possession of it. It would be rather fine, citizen Tournefort,\"\nhe added with a chuckle, \"if you and I could steal a march on citizen\nChauvelin over this affair, what? He has been extraordinarily arrogant\nof late and marvellously in favour, not only with the Committee, but\nwith citizen Robespierre himself.\"\n\n\"They say,\" commented Tournefort, \"that he succeeded in getting hold of\nsome papers which were of great value to the members of the Committee.\"\n\n\"He never succeeded in getting hold of that meddlesome Englishman whom\nthey call the Scarlet Pimpernel,\" was Gourdon's final dry comment.\n\nThus was the matter decided on. And the following morning at daybreak,\nGourdon, who was only a subordinate officer on the Committee of Public\nSafety, took it upon himself to institute a perquisition in the chateau\nof Gentilly, which is situated close to the commune of that name. He was\naccompanied by his friend Tournefort and a gang of half a dozen ruffians\nrecruited from the most disreputable cabarets of Paris.\n\nThe intention had been to steal a march on citizen Chauvelin, who had\nbeen over arrogant of late; but the result did not come up to\nexpectations. By midday the chateau had been ransacked from attic to\ncellar; every kind of valuable property had been destroyed, priceless\nworks of art irretrievably damaged. But priceless works of art had no\nmarket in Paris these days; and the property of real value--the Sucy\ndiamonds namely--which had excited the cupidity or the patriotic wrath\nof citizens Gourdon and Tournefort could nowhere be found.\n\nTo make the situation more deplorable still, the Committee of Public\nSafety had in some unexplainable way got wind of the affair, and the two\nworthies had the mortification of seeing citizen Chauvelin presently\nappear upon the scene.\n\nIt was then two o'clock in the afternoon. Gourdon, after he had snatched\na hasty dinner at a neighbouring cabaret, had returned to the task of\npulling the chateau of Gentilly about his own ears if need be, with a\nview to finding the concealed treasure.\n\nFor the nonce he was standing in the centre of the finely proportioned\nhall. The rich ormolu and crystal chandelier lay in a tangled, broken\nheap of scraps at his feet, and all around there was a confused medley\nof pictures, statuettes, silver ornaments, tapestry and brocade\nhangings, all piled up in disorder, smashed, tattered, kicked at now and\nagain by Gourdon, to the accompaniment of a savage oath.\n\nThe house itself was full of noises; heavy footsteps tramping up and\ndown the stairs, furniture turned over, curtains torn from their poles,\ndoors and windows battered in. And through it all the ceaseless\nhammering of pick and axe, attacking these stately walls which had\nwithstood the wars and sieges of centuries.\n\nEvery now and then Tournefort, his face perspiring and crimson with\nexertion, would present himself at the door of the hall. Gourdon would\nquery gruffly: \"Well?\"\n\nAnd the answer was invariably the same: \"Nothing!\"\n\nThen Gourdon would swear again and send curt orders to continue the\nsearch, relentlessly, ceaselessly.\n\n\"Leave no stone upon stone,\" he commanded. \"Those diamonds must be\nfound. We know they are here, and, name of a dog! I mean to have them.\"\n\nWhen Chauvelin arrived at the chateau he made no attempt at first to\ninterfere with Gourdon's commands. Only on one occasion he remarked\ncurtly:\n\n\"I suppose, citizen Gourdon, that you can trust your search party?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" retorted Gourdon. \"A finer patriot than Tournefort does\nnot exist.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" rejoined the other dryly. \"But what about the men?\"\n\n\"Oh! they are only a set of barefooted, ignorant louts. They do as they\nare told, and Tournefort has his eye on them. I dare say they'll\ncontrive to steal a few things, but they would never dare lay hands on\nvaluable jewellery. To begin with, they could never dispose of it.\nImagine a va-nu-pieds peddling a diamond tiara!\"\n\n\"There are always receivers prepared to take risks.\"\n\n\"Very few,\" Gourdon assured him, \"since we decreed that trafficking with\naristo property was a crime punishable by death.\"\n\nChauvelin said nothing for the moment. He appeared wrapped in his own\nthoughts, listened for a while to the confused hubbub about the house,\nthen he resumed abruptly:\n\n\"Who are these men whom you are employing, citizen Gourdon?\"\n\n\"A well-known gang,\" replied the other. \"I can give you their names.\"\n\n\"If you please.\"\n\nGourdon searched his pockets for a paper which he found presently and\nhanded to his colleague. The latter perused it thoughtfully.\n\n\"Where did Tournefort find these men?\" he asked.\n\n\"For the most part at the Cabaret de la Liberte--a place of very evil\nrepute down in the Rue Christine.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" rejoined the other. He was still studying the list of names\nwhich Gourdon had given him. \"And,\" he added, \"I know most of these men.\nAs thorough a set of ruffians as we need for some of our work. Merri,\nGuidal, Rateau, Desmonds. TIENS!\" he exclaimed. \"Rateau! Is Rateau here\nnow?\"\n\n\"Why, of course! He was recruited, like the rest of them, for the day.\nHe won't leave till he has been paid, you may be sure of that. Why do\nyou ask?\"\n\n\"I will tell you presently. But I would wish to speak with citizen\nRateau first.\"\n\nJust at this moment Tournefort paid his periodical visit to the hall.\nThe usual words, \"Still nothing,\" were on his lips, when Gourdon curtly\nordered him to go and fetch the citizen Rateau.\n\nA minute or two later Tournefort returned with the news that Rateau\ncould nowhere be found. Chauvelin received the news without any comment;\nhe only ordered Tournefort, somewhat roughly, back to his work. Then, as\nsoon as the latter had gone, Gourdon turned upon his colleague.\n\n\"Will you explain--\" he began with a show of bluster.\n\n\"With pleasure,\" replied Chauvelin blandly. \"On my way hither, less than\nan hour ago, I met your man Rateau, a league or so from here.\"\n\n\"You met Rateau!\" exclaimed Gourdon impatiently. \"Impossible! He was\nhere then, I feel sure. You must have been mistaken.\"\n\n\"I think not. I have only seen the man once, when I, too, went to\nrecruit a band of ruffians at the Cabaret de la Liberte, in connection\nwith some work I wanted doing. I did not employ him then, for he\nappeared to me both drink-sodden and nothing but a miserable,\nconsumptive creature, with a churchyard cough you can hear half a league\naway. But I would know him anywhere. Besides which, he stopped and\nwished me good morning. Now I come to think of it,\" added Chauvelin\nthoughtfully, \"he was carrying what looked like a heavy bundle under his\narm.\"\n\n\"A heavy bundle!\" cried Gourdon, with a forceful oath. \"And you did not\nstop him!\"\n\n\"I had no reason for suspecting him. I did not know until I arrived here\nwhat the whole affair was about, or whom you were employing. All that\nthe Committee knew for certain was that you and Tournefort and a number\nof men had arrived at Gentilly before daybreak, and I was then\ninstructed to follow you hither to see what mischief you were up to. You\nacted in complete secrecy, remember, citizen Gourdon, and without first\nascertaining the wishes of the Committee of Public Safety, whose servant\nyou are. If the Sucy diamonds are not found, you alone will be held\nresponsible for their loss to the Government of the People.\"\n\nChauvelin's voice had now assumed a threatening tone, and Gourdon felt\nall his audacity and self-assurance fall away from him, leaving him a\nprey to nameless terror.\n\n\"We must round up Rateau,\" he murmured hastily. \"He cannot have gone\nfar.\"\n\n\"No, he cannot,\" rejoined Chauvelin dryly. \"Though I was not specially\nthinking of Rateau or of diamonds when I started to come hither. I did\nsend a general order forbidding any person on foot or horseback to enter\nor leave Paris by any of the southern gates. That order will serve us\nwell now. Are you riding?\"\n\n\"Yes. I left my horse at the tavern just outside Gentilly. I can get to\nhorse within ten minutes.\"\n\n\"To horse, then, as quickly as you can. Pay off your men and dismiss\nthem--all but Tournefort, who had best accompany us. Do not lose a\nsingle moment. I'll be ahead of you and may come up with Rateau before\nyou overtake me. And if I were you, citizen Gourdon,\" he concluded, with\nominous emphasis, \"I would burn one or two candles to your compeer the\ndevil. You'll have need of his help if Rateau gives us the slip.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nThe first part of the road from Gentilly to Paris runs through the\nvalley of the Biere, and is densely wooded on either side. It winds in\nand out for the most part, ribbon-like, through thick coppice of\nchestnut and birch. Thus it was impossible for Chauvelin to spy his\nquarry from afar; nor did he expect to do so this side of the Hopital de\nla Sante. Once past that point, he would find the road quite open and\nrunning almost straight, in the midst of arid and only partially\ncultivated land.\n\nHe rode at a sharp trot, with his caped coat wrapped tightly round his\nshoulders, for it was raining fast. At intervals, when he met an\noccasional wayfarer, he would ask questions about a tall man who had a\nconsumptive cough, and who was carrying a cumbersome burden under his\narm.\n\nAlmost everyone whom he thus asked remembered seeing a personage who\nvaguely answered to the description: tall and with a decided stoop--yes,\nand carrying a cumbersome-looking bundle under his arm. Chauvelin was\nundoubtedly on the track of the thief.\n\nJust beyond Meuves he was overtaken by Gourdon and Tournefort. Here,\ntoo, the man Rateau's track became more and more certain. At one place\nhe had stopped and had a glass of wine and a rest, at another he had\nasked how close he was to the gates of Paris.\n\nThe road was now quite open and level; the irregular buildings of the\nhospital appeared vague in the rain-sodden distance. Twenty minutes\nlater Tournefort, who was riding ahead of his companions, spied a tall,\nstooping figure at the spot where the Chemin de Gentilly forks, and\nwhere stands a group of isolated houses and bits of garden, which belong\nto la Sante. Here, before the days when the glorious Revolution swept\naside all such outward signs of superstition, there had stood a Calvary.\nIt was now used as a signpost. The man stood before it, scanning the\nhalf-obliterated indications.\n\nAt the moment that Tournefort first caught sight of him he appeared\nuncertain of his way. Then for a while he watched Tournefort, who was\ncoming at a sharp trot towards him. Finally, he seemed to make up his\nmind very suddenly and, giving a last, quick look round, he walked\nrapidly along the upper road. Tournefort drew rein, waited for his\ncolleagues to come up with him. Then he told them what he had seen.\n\n\"It is Rateau, sure enough,\" he said. \"I saw his face quite distinctly\nand heard his abominable cough. He is trying to get into Paris. That\nroad leads nowhere but to the barrier. There, of course, he will be\nstopped, and--\"\n\nThe other two had also brought their horses to a halt. The situation had\nbecome tense, and a plan for future action had at once to be decided on.\nAlready Chauvelin, masterful and sure of himself, had assumed command of\nthe little party. Now he broke in abruptly on Tournefort's vapid\nreflections.\n\n\"We don't want him stopped at the barrier,\" he said in his usual curt,\nauthoritative manner. \"You, citizen Tournefort,\" he continued, \"will\nride as fast as you can to the gate, making a detour by the lower road.\nYou will immediately demand to speak with the sergeant who is in\ncommand, and you will give him a detailed description of the man Rateau.\nThen you will tell him in my name that, should such a man present\nhimself at the gate, he must be allowed to enter the city unmolested.\"\n\nGourdon gave a quick cry of protest.\n\n\"Let the man go unmolested? Citizen Chauvelin, think what you are\ndoing!\"\n\n\"I always think of what I am doing,\" retorted Chauvelin curtly, \"and\nhave no need of outside guidance in the process.\" Then he turned once\nmore to Tournefort. \"You yourself, citizen,\" he continued, in sharp,\ndecisive tones which admitted of no argument, \"will dismount as soon as\nyou are inside the city. You will keep the gate under observation. The\nmoment you see the man Rateau, you will shadow him, and on no account\nlose sight of him. Understand?\"\n\n\"You may trust me, citizen Chauvelin,\" Tournefort replied, elated at the\nprospect of work which was so entirely congenial to him. \"But will you\ntell me--\"\n\n\"I will tell you this much, citizen Tournefort,\" broke in Chauvelin with\nsome acerbity, \"that though we have traced the diamonds and the thief so\nfar, we have, through your folly last night, lost complete track of the\nci-devant Comtesse de Sucy and of the man Bertin. We want Rateau to show\nus where they are.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" murmured the other meekly.\n\n\"That's a mercy!\" riposted Chauvelin dryly. \"Then quickly man. Lose no\ntime! Try to get a few minutes' advance on Rateau; then slip in to the\nguard-room to change into less conspicuous clothes. Citizen Gourdon and\nI will continue on the upper road and keep the man in sight in case he\nshould think of altering his course. In any event, we'll meet you just\ninside the barrier. But if, in the meanwhile, you have to get on\nRateau's track before we have arrived on the scene, leave the usual\nindications as to the direction which you have taken.\"\n\nHaving given his orders and satisfied himself that they were fully\nunderstood, he gave a curt command, \"En avant,\" and once more the three\nof them rode at a sharp trot down the road towards the city.\n\n\nIV\n\nCitizen Rateau, if he thought about the matter at all, must indeed have\nbeen vastly surprised at the unwonted amiability or indifference of\nsergeant Ribot, who was in command at the gate of Gentilly. Ribot only\nthrew a very perfunctory glance at the greasy permit which Rateau\npresented to him, and when he put the usual query, \"What's in that\nparcel?\" and Rateau gave the reply: \"Two heads of cabbage and a bunch of\ncarrots,\" Ribot merely poked one of his fingers into the bundle, felt\nthat a cabbage leaf did effectually lie on the top, and thereupon gave\nthe formal order: \"Pass on, citizen, in the name of the Republic!\"\nwithout any hesitation.\n\nTournefort, who had watched the brief little incident from behind the\nwindow of a neighbouring cabaret, could not help but chuckle to himself.\nNever had he seen game walk more readily into a trap. Rateau, after he\nhad passed the barrier, appeared undecided which way he would go. He\nlooked with obvious longing towards the cabaret, behind which the\nkeenest agent on the staff of the Committee of Public Safety was even\nnow ensconced. But seemingly a halt within those hospitable doors did\nnot form part of his programme, and a moment or two later he turned\nsharply on his heel and strode rapidly down the Rue de l'Oursine.\n\nTournefort allowed him a fair start, and then made ready to follow.\n\nJust as he was stepping out of the cabaret he spied Chauvelin and\nGourdon coming through the gates. They, too, had apparently made a brief\nhalt inside the guard-room, where--as at most of the gates--a store of\nvarious disguises was always kept ready for the use of the numerous\nsleuth-hounds employed by the Committee of Public Safety. Here the two\nmen had exchanged their official garments for suits of sombre cloth,\nwhich gave them the appearance of a couple of humble bourgeois going\nquietly about their business. Tournefort had donned an old blouse,\ntattered stockings, and shoes down at heel. With his hands buried in his\nbreeches' pockets, he, too, turned into the long narrow Rue de\nl'Oursine, which, after a sharp curve, abuts on the Rue Mouffetard.\n\nRateau was walking rapidly, taking big strides with his long legs.\nTournefort, now sauntering in the gutter in the middle of the road, now\ndarting in and out of open doorways, kept his quarry well in sight.\nChauvelin and Gourdon lagged some little way behind. It was still\nraining, but not heavily--a thin drizzle, which penetrated almost to the\nmarrow. Not many passers-by haunted this forlorn quarter of old Paris.\nTo right and left tall houses almost obscured the last, quickly-fading\nlight of the grey September day.\n\nAt the bottom of the Rue Mouffetard, Rateau came once more to a halt. A\nnetwork of narrow streets radiated from this centre. He looked all round\nhim and also behind. It was difficult to know whether he had a sudden\nsuspicion that he was being followed; certain it is that, after a very\nbrief moment of hesitation, he plunged suddenly into the narrow Rue\nContrescarpe and disappeared from view.\n\nTournefort was after him in a trice. When he reached the corner of the\nstreet he saw Rateau, at the further end of it, take a sudden sharp turn\nto the right. But not before he had very obviously spied his pursuer,\nfor at that moment his entire demeanour changed. An air of furtive\nanxiety was expressed in his whole attitude. Even at that distance\nTournefort could see him clutching his bulky parcel close to his chest.\n\nAfter that the pursuit became closer and hotter. Rateau was in and out\nof that tight network of streets which cluster around the Place de\nFourci, intent, apparently, on throwing his pursuers off the scent, for\nafter a while he was running round and round in a circle. Now up the Rue\ndes Poules, then to the right and to the right again; back in the Place\nde Fourci. Then straight across it once more to the Rue Contrescarpe,\nwhere he presently disappeared so completely from view that Tournefort\nthought that the earth must have swallowed him up.\n\nTournefort was a man capable of great physical exertion. His calling\noften made heavy demands upon his powers of endurance; but never before\nhad he grappled with so strenuous a task. Puffing and panting, now\nrunning at top speed, anon brought to a halt by the doubling-up tactics\nof his quarry, his great difficulty was the fact that citizen Chauvelin\ndid not wish the man Rateau to be apprehended; did not wish him to know\nthat he was being pursued. And Tournefort had need of all his wits to\nkeep well under the shadow of any projecting wall or under cover of open\ndoorways which were conveniently in the way, and all the while not to\nlose sight of that consumptive giant, who seemed to be playing some\nintricate game which well-nigh exhausted the strength of citizen\nTournefort.\n\nWhat he could not make out was what had happened to Chauvelin and to\nGourdon. They had been less than three hundred metres behind him when\nfirst this wild chase in and out of the Rue Contrescarpe had begun. Now,\nwhen their presence was most needed, they seemed to have lost track both\nof him--Tournefort--and of the very elusive quarry. To make matters more\ncomplicated, the shades of evening were drawing in very fast, and these\nnarrow streets of the Faubourg were very sparsely lighted.\n\nJust at this moment Tournefort had once more caught sight of Rateau,\nstriding leisurely this time up the street. The worthy agent quickly\ntook refuge under a doorway and was mopping his streaming forehead, glad\nof this brief respite in the mad chase, when that awful churchyard cough\nsuddenly sounded so close to him that he gave a great jump and well-nigh\nbetrayed his presence then and there. He had only just time to withdraw\nfurther still into the angle of the doorway, when Rateau passed by.\n\nTournefort peeped out of his hiding-place, and for the space of a dozen\nheart beats or so, remained there quite still, watching that broad back\nand those long limbs slowly moving through the gathering gloom. The next\ninstant he perceived Chauvelin standing at the end of the street.\n\nRateau saw him too--came face to face with him, in fact, and must have\nknown who he was for, without an instant's hesitation and just like a\nhunted creature at bay, he turned sharply on his heel and then ran back\ndown the street as hard as he could tear. He passed close to within half\na metre of Tournefort, and as he flew past he hit out with his left fist\nso vigorously that the worthy agent of the Committee of Public Safety,\ncaught on the nose by the blow, staggered and measured his length upon\nthe flagged floor below.\n\nThe next moment Chauvelin had come by. Tournefort, struggling to his\nfeet, called to him, panting:\n\n\"Did you see him? Which way did he go?\"\n\n\"Up the Rue Bordet. After him, citizen!\" replied Chauvelin grimly,\nbetween his teeth.\n\nTogether the two men continued the chase, guided through the intricate\nmazes of the streets by their fleeing quarry. They had Rateau well in\nsight, and the latter could no longer continue his former tactics with\nsuccess now that two experienced sleuth-hounds were on his track.\n\nAt a given moment he was caught between the two of them. Tournefort was\nadvancing cautiously up the Rue Bordet; Chauvelin, equally stealthily,\nwas coming down the same street, and Rateau, once more walking quite\nleisurely, was at equal distance between the two.\n\n\nV\n\nThere are no side turnings out of the Rue Bordet, the total length of\nwhich is less than fifty metres; so Tournefort, feeling more at his\nease, ensconced himself at one end of the street, behind a doorway,\nwhilst Chauvelin did the same at the other. Rateau, standing in the\ngutter, appeared once more in a state of hesitation. Immediately in\nfront of him the door of a small cabaret stood invitingly open; its\nsignboard, \"Le Bon Copain,\" promised rest and refreshment. He peered up\nand down the road, satisfied himself presumably that, for the moment,\nhis pursuers were out of sight, hugged his parcel to his chest, and then\nsuddenly made a dart for the cabaret and disappeared within its doors.\n\nNothing could have been better. The quarry, for the moment, was safe,\nand if the sleuth-hounds could not get refreshment, they could at least\nget a rest. Tournefort and Chauvelin crept out of their hiding-places.\nThey met in the middle of the road, at the spot where Rateau had stood a\nwhile ago. It was then growing dark and the street was innocent of\nlanterns, but the lights inside the cabaret gave a full view of the\ninterior. The lower half of the wide shop-window was curtained off, but\nabove the curtain the heads of the customers of \"Le Bon Copain,\" and the\ngeneral comings and goings, could very clearly be seen.\n\nTournefort, never at a loss, had already climbed upon a low projection\nin the wall of one of the houses opposite. From this point of vantage he\ncould more easily observe what went on inside the cabaret, and in short,\njerky sentences he gave a description of what he saw to his chief.\n\n\"Rateau is sitting down ... he has his back to the window ... he has put\nhis bundle down close beside him on the bench ... he can't speak for a\nminute, for he is coughing and spluttering like an old walrus.... A\nwench is bringing him a bottle of wine and a hunk of bread and\ncheese.... He has started talking ... is talking volubly ... the people\nare laughing ... some are applauding.... And here comes Jean Victor, the\nlandlord ... you know him, citizen ... a big, hulking fellow, and as\ngood a patriot as I ever wish to see.... He, too, is laughing and\ntalking to Rateau, who is doubled up with another fit of coughing--\"\n\nChauvelin uttered an exclamation of impatience:\n\n\"Enough of this, citizen Tournefort. Keep your eye on the man and hold\nyour tongue. I am spent with fatigue.\"\n\n\"No wonder,\" murmured Tournefort. Then he added insinuatingly: \"Why not\nlet me go in there and apprehend Rateau now? We should have the diamonds\nand--\"\n\n\"And lose the ci-devant Comtesse de Sucy and the man Bertin,\" retorted\nChauvelin with sudden fierceness. \"Bertin, who can be none other than\nthat cursed Englishman, the--\"\n\nHe checked himself, seeing Tournefort was gazing down on him, with awe\nand bewilderment expressed in his lean, hatchet face.\n\n\"You are losing sight of Rateau, citizen,\" Chauvelin continued calmly.\n\"What is he doing now?\"\n\nBut Tournefort felt that this calmness was only on the surface;\nsomething strange had stirred the depths of his chief's keen, masterful\nmind. He would have liked to ask a question or two, but knew from\nexperience that it was neither wise nor profitable to try and probe\ncitizen Chauvelin's thoughts. So after a moment or two he turned back\nobediently to his task.\n\n\"I can't see Rateau for the moment,\" he said, \"but there is much talking\nand merriment in there. Ah! there he is, I think. Yes, I see him!... He\nis behind the counter, talking to Jean Victor ... and he has just thrown\nsome money down upon the counter.... gold too! name of a dog....\"\n\nThen suddenly, without any warning, Tournefort jumped down from his post\nof observation. Chauvelin uttered a brief:\n\n\"What the----- are you doing, citizen?\"\n\n\"Rateau is going,\" replied Tournefort excitedly. \"He drank a mug of wine\nat a draught and has picked up his bundle, ready to go.\"\n\nOnce more cowering in the dark angle of a doorway, the two men waited,\ntheir nerves on edge, for the reappearance of their quarry.\n\n\"I wish citizen Gourdon were here,\" whispered Tournefort. \"In the\ndarkness it is better to be three than two.\"\n\n\"I sent him back to the Station in the Rue Mouffetard,\" was Chauvelin's\ncurt retort; \"there to give notice that I might require a few armed men\npresently. But he should be somewhere about here by now, looking for us.\nAnyway, I have my whistle, and if--\"\n\nHe said no more, for at that moment the door of the cabaret was opened\nfrom within and Rateau stepped out into the street, to the accompaniment\nof loud laughter and clapping of hands which came from the customers of\nthe \"Bon Copain.\"\n\nThis time he appeared neither in a hurry nor yet anxious. He did not\npause in order to glance to right or left, but started to walk quite\nleisurely up the street. The two sleuth-hounds quietly followed him.\nThrough the darkness they could only vaguely see his silhouette, with\nthe great bundle under his arm. Whatever may have been Rateau's fears of\nbeing shadowed awhile ago, he certainly seemed free of them now. He\nsauntered along, whistling a tune, down the Montagne Ste. Genevieve to\nthe Place Maubert, and thence straight towards the river.\n\nHaving reached the bank, he turned off to his left, sauntered past the\nEcole de Medecine and went across the Petit Pont, then through the New\nMarket, along the Quai des Orfevres. Here he made a halt, and for awhile\nlooked over the embankment at the river and then round about him, as if\nin search of something. But presently he appeared to make up his mind,\nand continued his leisurely walk as far as the Pont Neuf, where he\nturned sharply off to his right, still whistling, Tournefort and\nChauvelin hard upon his heels.\n\n\"That whistling is getting on my nerves,\" muttered Tournefort irritably;\n\"and I haven't heard the ruffian's churchyard cough since he walked out\nof the 'Bon Copain.'\"\n\nStrangely enough, it was this remark of Tournefort's which gave\nChauvelin the first inkling of something strange and, to him, positively\nawesome. Tournefort, who walked close beside him, heard him suddenly\nmutter a fierce exclamation.\n\n\"Name of a dog!\"\n\n\"What is it, citizen?\" queried Tournefort, awed by this sudden outburst\non the part of a man whose icy calmness had become proverbial throughout\nthe Committee.\n\n\"Sound the alarm, citizen!\" cried Chauvelin in response. \"Or, by Satan,\nhe'll escape us again!\"\n\n\"But--\" stammered Tournefort in utter bewilderment, while, with fingers\nthat trembled somewhat, he fumbled for his whistle.\n\n\"We shall want all the help we can,\" retorted Chauvelin roughly. \"For,\nunless I am much mistaken, there's more noble quarry here than even I\ncould dare to hope!\"\n\nRateau in the meanwhile had quietly lolled up to the parapet on the\nright-hand side of the bridge, and Tournefort, who was watching him with\nintense keenness, still marvelled why citizen Chauvelin had suddenly\nbecome so strangely excited. Rateau was merely lolling against the\nparapet, like a man who has not a care in the world. He had placed his\nbundle on the stone ledge beside him. Here he waited a moment or two,\nuntil one of the small craft upon the river loomed out of the darkness\nimmediately below the bridge. Then he picked up the bundle and threw it\nstraight into the boat. At that same moment Tournefort had the whistle\nto his lips. A shrill, sharp sound rang out through the gloom.\n\n\"The boat, citizen Tournefort, the boat!\" cried Chauvelin. \"There are\nplenty of us here to deal with the man.\"\n\nImmediately, from the quays, the streets, the bridges, dark figures\nemerged out of the darkness and hurried to the spot. Some reached the\nbridgehead even as Rateau made a dart forward, and two men were upon him\nbefore he succeeded in running very far. Others had scrambled down the\nembankment and were shouting to some unseen boatman to \"halt, in the\nname of the people!\"\n\nBut Rateau gave in without a struggle. He appeared more dazed than\nfrightened, and quietly allowed the agents of the Committee to lead him\nback to the bridge, where Chauvelin had paused, waiting for him.\n\n\nVI\n\nA minute or two later Tournefort was once more beside his chief. He was\ncarrying the precious bundle, which, he explained, the boatman had given\nup without question.\n\n\"The man knew nothing about it,\" the agent said. \"No one, he says, could\nhave been more surprised than he was when this bundle was suddenly flung\nat him over the parapet of the bridge.\"\n\nJust then the small group, composed of two or three agents of the\nCommittee, holding their prisoner by the arms, came into view. One man\nwas walking ahead and was the first to approach Chauvelin. He had a\nsmall screw of paper in his hand, which he gave to his chief.\n\n\"Found inside the lining of the prisoner's hat, citizen,\" he reported\ncurtly, and opened the shutter of a small, dark lantern which he wore at\nhis belt.\n\nChauvelin took the paper from his subordinate. A weird, unexplainable\nforeknowledge of what was to come caused his hand to shake and beads of\nperspiration to moisten his forehead. He looked up and saw the prisoner\nstanding before him. Crushing the paper in his hand he snatched the\nlantern from the agent's belt and flashed it in the face of the quarry\nwho, at the last, had been so easily captured.\n\nImmediately a hoarse cry of disappointment and of rage escaped his\nthroat.\n\n\"Who is this man?\" he cried.\n\nOne of the agents gave reply:\n\n\"It is old Victor, the landlord of the 'Bon Copain.' He is just a fool,\nwho has been playing a practical joke.\"\n\nTournefort, too, at sight of the prisoner had uttered a cry of dismay\nand of astonishment.\n\n\"Victor!\" he exclaimed. \"Name of a dog, citizen, what are you doing\nhere?\"\n\nBut Chauvelin had gripped the man by the arm so fiercely that the latter\nswore with the pain.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" he queried roughly.\n\n\"Only a bet, citizen,\" retorted Victor reproachfully. \"No reason to fall\non an honest patriot for a bet, just as if he were a mad dog.\"\n\n\"A joke? A bet?\" murmured Chauvelin hoarsely, for his throat now felt\nhot and parched. \"What do you mean? Who are you, man? Speak, or I'll--\"\n\n\"My name is Jean Victor,\" replied the other. \"I am the landlord of the\n'Bon Copain.' An hour ago a man came into my cabaret. He was a queer,\nconsumptive creature, with a churchyard cough that made you shiver. Some\nof my customers knew him by sight, told me that the man's name was\nRateau, and that he was an habitue of the 'Liberte,' in the Rue\nChristine. Well; he soon fell into conversation, first with me, then\nwith some of my customers--talked all sorts of silly nonsense, made\nabsurd bets with everybody. Some of these he won, and others he lost;\nbut I must say that when he lost he always paid up most liberally. Then\nwe all got excited, and soon bets flew all over the place. I don't\nrightly know how it happened at the last, but all at once he bet me that\nI would not dare to walk out then and there in the dark, as far as the\nPont Neuf, wearing his blouse and hat and carrying a bundle the same as\nhis under my arm. I not dare?... I, Jean Victor, who was a fine fighter\nin my day! I bet him a gold piece that I would and he said that he would\nmake it five if I came back without my bundle, having thrown it over the\nparapet into any passing boat. Well, citizen!\" continued Jean Victor\nwith a laugh, \"I ask you, what would you have done? Five gold pieces\nmeans a fortune these hard times, and I tell you the man was quite\nhonest and always paid liberally when he lost. He slipped behind the\ncounter and took off his blouse and hat, which I put on. Then we made up\na bundle with some cabbage heads and a few carrots, and out I came. I\ndidn't think there could be anything wrong in the whole affair--just the\ntomfoolery of a man who has got the betting mania and in whose pocket\nmoney is just burning a hole. And I have won my bet,\" concluded Jean\nVictor, still unabashed, \"and I want to go back and get my money. If you\ndon't believe me, come with me to my CABARET. You will find the citizen\nRateau there, for sure; and I know that I shall find my five gold\npieces.\"\n\nChauvelin had listened to the man as he would to some weird dream-story,\nwherein ghouls and devils had played a part. Tournefort, who was\nwatching him, was awed by the look of fierce rage and grim hopelessness\nwhich shone from his chief's pale eyes. The other agents laughed. They\nwere highly amused at the tale, but they would not let the prisoner go.\n\n\"If Jean Victor's story is true, citizen,\" their sergeant said, speaking\nto Chauvelin, \"there will be witnesses to it over at 'Le Bon Copain.'\nShall we take the prisoner straightway there and await further orders?\"\n\nChauvelin gave a curt acquiescence, nodding his head like some\ninsentient wooden automaton. The screw of paper was still in his hand;\nit seemed to sear his palm. Tournefort even now broke into a grim laugh.\nHe had just undone the bundle which Jean Victor had thrown over the\nparapet of the bridge. It contained two heads of cabbage and a bunch of\ncarrots. Then he ordered the agents to march on with their prisoner, and\nthey, laughing and joking with Jean Victor, gave a quick turn, and soon\ntheir heavy footsteps were echoing down the flagstones of the bridge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChauvelin waited, motionless and silent, the dark lantern still held in\nhis shaking hand, until he was quite sure that he was alone. Then only\ndid he unfold the screw of paper.\n\nIt contained a few lines scribbled in pencil--just that foolish rhyme\nwhich to his fevered nerves was like a strong irritant, a poison which\ngave him an unendurable sensation of humiliation and impotence:\n\n    \"We seek him here, we seek him there!\n     Chauvelin seeks him everywhere!\n     Is he in heaven? Is he in hell?\n     That demmed, elusive Pimpernel!\"\n\nHe crushed the paper in his hand and, with a loud groan, of misery, fled\nover the bridge like one possessed.\n\n\nVII\n\nMadame la Comtesse de Sucy never went to England. She was one of those\nFrench women who would sooner endure misery in their own beloved country\nthan comfort anywhere else. She outlived the horrors of the Revolution\nand speaks in her memoirs of the man Bertin. She never knew who he was\nnor whence he came. All that she knew was that he came to her like some\nmysterious agent of God, bringing help, counsel, a semblance of\nhappiness, at the moment when she was at the end of all her resources\nand saw grim starvation staring her and her children in the face. He\nappointed all sorts of strange places in out-of-the-way Paris where she\nwas wont to meet him, and one night she confided to him the history of\nher diamonds, and hardly dared to trust his promise that he would get\nthem for her.\n\nLess than twenty-four hours later he brought them to her, at the poor\nlodgings in the Rue Blanche which she occupied with her children under\nan assumed name. That same night she begged him to dispose of them. This\nalso he did, bringing her the money the next day.\n\nShe never saw him again after that.\n\nBut citizen Tournefort never quite got over his disappointment of that\nnight. Had he dared, he would have blamed citizen Chauvelin for the\ndiscomfiture. It would have been better to have apprehended the man\nRateau while there was a chance of doing so with success.\n\nAs it was, the impudent ruffian slipped clean away, and was never heard\nof again either at the \"Bon Copain\" or at the \"Liberte.\" The customers\nat the cabaret certainly corroborated the story of Jean Victor. The man\nRateau, they said, had been honest to the last. When time went on and\nJean Victor did not return, he said that he could no longer wait, had\nwork to do for the Government over the other side of the water and was\nafraid he would get punished if he dallied. But, before leaving, he laid\nthe five gold pieces on the table. Every one wondered that so humble a\nworkman had so much money in his pocket, and was withal so lavish with\nit. But these were not the times when one inquired too closely into the\npresence of money in the pocket of a good patriot.\n\nAnd citizen Rateau was a good patriot, for sure.\n\nAnd a good fellow to boot!\n\nThey all drank his health in Jean Victor's sour wine; then each went his\nway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, by\nBaroness Orczy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LEAGUE OF THE SCARLET ***\n\n***** This file should be named 5805.txt or 5805.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/8/0/5805/\n\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, Charles Franks and the\nOnline Distributed Proofreading Team\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
