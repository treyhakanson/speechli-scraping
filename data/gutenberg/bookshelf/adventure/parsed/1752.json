He it was, so they say, who egged the\nJacobins on against the Mountain, Robespierre against Danton, Hebert\nagainst Robespierre. He it was who instigated the massacres of\nSeptember, the atrocities of Nantes, the horrors of Thermidor, the\nsacrileges, the noyades: all with the view of causing every section of\nthe National Assembly to vie with the other in excesses and in cruelty,\nuntil the makers of the Revolution, satiated with their own lust, turned\non one another, and Sardanapalus-like buried themselves and their orgies\nin the vast hecatomb of a self-consumed anarchy.\n\nWhether the power thus ascribed to Baron de Batz by his historians is\nreal or imaginary it is not the purpose of this preface to investigate.\nIts sole object is to point out the difference between the career of\nthis plotter and that of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nThe Baron de Batz himself was an adventurer without substance, save that\nwhich he derived from abroad. He was one of those men who have nothing\nto lose and everything to gain by throwing themselves headlong in the\nseething cauldron of internal politics.\n\nThough he made several attempts at rescuing King Louis first, and\nthen the Queen and Royal Family from prison and from death, he never\nsucceeded, as we know, in any of these undertakings, and he never once\nso much as attempted the rescue of other equally innocent, if not quite\nso distinguished, victims of the most bloodthirsty revolution that has\never shaken the foundations of the civilised world.\n\nNay more; when on the 29th Prairial those unfortunate men and women were\ncondemned and executed for alleged complicity in the so-called \"Foreign\nConspiracy,\" de Batz, who is universally admitted to have been the\nhead and prime-mover of that conspiracy--if, indeed, conspiracy there\nwas--never made either the slightest attempt to rescue his confederates\nfrom the guillotine, or at least the offer to perish by their side if he\ncould not succeed in saving them.\n\nAnd when we remember that the martyrs of the 29th Prairial included\nwomen like Grandmaison, the devoted friend of de Batz, the beautiful\nEmilie de St. Amaranthe, little Cecile Renault--a mere child not sixteen\nyears of age--also men like Michonis and Roussell, faithful servants\nof de Batz, the Baron de Lezardiere, and the Comte de St. Maurice,\nhis friends, we no longer can have the slightest doubt that the Gascon\nplotter and the English gentleman are indeed two very different persons.\n\nThe latter's aims were absolutely non-political. He never intrigued\nfor the restoration of the monarchy, or even for the overthrow of that\nRepublic which he loathed.\n\nHis only concern was the rescue of the innocent, the stretching out of a\nsaving hand to those unfortunate creatures who had fallen into the nets\nspread out for them by their fellow-men; by those who--godless, lawless,\npenniless themselves--had sworn to exterminate all those who clung to\ntheir belongings, to their religion, and to their beliefs.\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel did not take it upon himself to punish the guilty;\nhis care was solely of the helpless and of the innocent.\n\nFor this aim he risked his life every time that he set foot on French\nsoil, for it he sacrificed his fortune, and even his personal happiness,\nand to it he devoted his entire existence.\n\nMoreover, whereas the French plotter is said to have had confederates\neven in the Assembly of the Convention, confederates who were\nsufficiently influential and powerful to secure his own immunity, the\nEnglishman when he was bent on his errands of mercy had the whole of\nFrance against him.\n\nThe Baron de Batz was a man who never justified either his own ambitions\nor even his existence; the Scarlet Pimpernel was a personality of whom\nan entire nation might justly be proud.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n     PART I\n     I    IN THE THEATRE NATIONAL\n     II    WIDELY DIVERGENT AIMS\n     III    THE DEMON CHANCE\n     IV    MADEMOISELLE LANGE\n     V    THE TEMPLE PRISON\n     VI    THE COMMITTEE'S AGENT\n     VII    THE MOST PRECIOUS LIFE IN EUROPE\n     VIII    ARCADES AMBO\n     IX    WHAT LOVE CAN DO\n     X    SHADOWS\n     XI    THE LEAGUE OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL\n     XII    WHAT LOVE IS\n     XIII    THEN EVERYTHING WAS DARK\n     XIV    THE CHIEF\n     XV    THE GATE OF LA VILLETTE\n     XVI    THE WEARY SEARCH\n     XVII    CHAUVELIN\n     XVIII    THE REMOVAL\n     XIX    IT IS ABOUT THE DAUPHIN\n     XX    THE CERTIFICATE OF SAFETY\n     XXI    BACK TO PARIS\n     XXII    OF THAT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION\n     XXIII    THE OVERWHELMING ODDS\n\n     PART II\n     XXIV    THE NEWS\n     XXV    PARIS ONCE MORE\n     XXVI    THE BITTEREST FOE\n     XXVI   IN THE CONCIERGERIE\n     XXVIII    THE CAGED LION\n     XXIX    FOR THE SAKE OF THAT HELPLESS INNOCENT\n     XXX    AFTERWARDS\n     XXXI    AN INTERLUDE\n     XXXII    SISTERS\n     XXXIII    LITTLE MOTHER\n     XXXIV    THE LETTER\n\n     PART III\n     XXXV    THE LAST PHASE\n     XXXVI    SUBMISSION\n     XXXVII    CHAUVELIN'S ADVICE\n     XXXVIII    CAPITULATION\n     XXXIX    KILL HIM!\n     XL    GOD HELP US ALL\n     XLI    WHEN HOPE WAS DEAD\n     XLII    THE GUARD-HOUSE OF THE RUE STE.

IN THE THEATRE NATIONAL\n\nAnd yet people found the opportunity to amuse themselves, to dance and\nto go to the theatre, to enjoy music and open-air cafes and promenades\nin the Palais Royal.\n\nNew fashions in dress made their appearance, milliners produced fresh\n\"creations,\" and jewellers were not idle. A grim sense of humour, born\nof the very intensity of ever-present danger, had dubbed the cut of\ncertain tunics \"tete tranche,\" or a favourite ragout was called \"a la\nguillotine.\"\n\nOn three evenings only during the past memorable four and a half years\ndid the theatres close their doors, and these evenings were the ones\nimmediately following that terrible 2nd of September the day of the\nbutchery outside the Abbaye prison, when Paris herself was aghast with\nhorror, and the cries of the massacred might have drowned the calls of\nthe audience whose hands upraised for plaudits would still be dripping\nwith blood.\n\nOn all other evenings of these same four and a half years the theatres\nin the Rue de Richelieu, in the Palais Royal, the Luxembourg, and\nothers, had raised their curtains and taken money at their doors.\nThe same audience that earlier in the day had whiled away the time\nby witnessing the ever-recurrent dramas of the Place de la Revolution\nassembled here in the evenings and filled stalls, boxes, and tiers,\nlaughing over the satires of Voltaire or weeping over the sentimental\ntragedies of persecuted Romeos and innocent Juliets.\n\nDeath knocked at so many doors these days! He was so constant a guest in\nthe houses of relatives and friends that those who had merely shaken him\nby the hand, those on whom he had smiled, and whom he, still smiling,\nhad passed indulgently by, looked on him with that subtle contempt born\nof familiarity, shrugged their shoulders at his passage, and envisaged\nhis probable visit on the morrow with lighthearted indifference.\n\nParis--despite the horrors that had stained her walls had remained a\ncity of pleasure, and the knife of the guillotine did scarce descend\nmore often than did the drop-scenes on the stage.\n\nOn this bitterly cold evening of the 27th Nivose, in the second year of\nthe Republic--or, as we of the old style still persist in calling it,\nthe 16th of January, 1794--the auditorium of the Theatre National was\nfilled with a very brilliant company.\n\nThe appearance of a favourite actress in the part of one of Moliere's\nvolatile heroines had brought pleasure-loving Paris to witness this\nrevival of \"Le Misanthrope,\" with new scenery, dresses, and the\naforesaid charming actress to add piquancy to the master's mordant wit.\n\nThe Moniteur, which so impartially chronicles the events of those times,\ntells us under that date that the Assembly of the Convention voted on\nthat same day a new law giving fuller power to its spies, enabling them\nto effect domiciliary searches at their discretion without previous\nreference to the Committee of General Security, authorising them to\nproceed against all enemies of public happiness, to send them to prison\nat their own discretion, and assuring them the sum of thirty-five livres\n\"for every piece of game thus beaten up for the guillotine.\" Under that\nsame date the Moniteur also puts it on record that the Theatre National\nwas filled to its utmost capacity for the revival of the late citoyen\nMoliere's comedy.\n\nThe Assembly of the Convention having voted the new law which placed the\nlives of thousands at the mercy of a few human bloodhounds, adjourned\nits sitting and proceeded to the Rue de Richelieu.\n\nAlready the house was full when the fathers of the people made their way\nto the seats which had been reserved for them. An awed hush descended\non the throng as one by one the men whose very names inspired horror and\ndread filed in through the narrow gangways of the stalls or took their\nplaces in the tiny boxes around.\n\nCitizen Robespierre's neatly bewigged head soon appeared in one of\nthese; his bosom friend St. Just was with him, and also his sister\nCharlotte. Danton, like a big, shaggy-coated lion, elbowed his way into\nthe stalls, whilst Sauterre, the handsome butcher and idol of the people\nof Paris, was loudly acclaimed as his huge frame, gorgeously clad in the\nuniform of the National Guard, was sighted on one of the tiers above.\n\nThe public in the parterre and in the galleries whispered excitedly; the\nawe-inspiring names flew about hither and thither on the wings of the\noverheated air. Women craned their necks to catch sight of heads which\nmayhap on the morrow would roll into the gruesome basket at the foot of\nthe guillotine.\n\nIn one of the tiny avant-scene boxes two men had taken their seats long\nbefore the bulk of the audience had begun to assemble in the house. The\ninside of the box was in complete darkness, and the narrow opening which\nallowed but a sorry view of one side of the stage helped to conceal\nrather than display the occupants.\n\nThe younger one of these two men appeared to be something of a stranger\nin Paris, for as the public men and the well-known members of the\nGovernment began to arrive he often turned to his companion for\ninformation regarding these notorious personalities.\n\n\"Tell me, de Batz,\" he said, calling the other's attention to a group\nof men who had just entered the house, \"that creature there in the green\ncoat--with his hand up to his face now--who is he?\"\n\n\"Where? Which do you mean?\"\n\n\"There! He looks this way now, and he has a playbill in his hand. The\nman with the protruding chin and the convex forehead, a face like a\nmarmoset, and eyes like a jackal. What?\"\n\nThe other leaned over the edge of the box, and his small, restless eyes\nwandered over the now closely-packed auditorium.\n\n\"Oh!\" he said as soon as he recognised the face which his friend had\npointed out to him, \"that is citizen Foucquier-Tinville.\"\n\n\"The Public Prosecutor?\"\n\n\"Himself. And Heron is the man next to him.\"\n\n\"Heron?\" said the younger man interrogatively.\n\n\"Yes. He is chief agent to the Committee of General Security now.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\nBoth leaned back in their chairs, and their sombrely-clad figures were\nonce more merged in the gloom of the narrow box. Instinctively, since\nthe name of the Public Prosecutor had been mentioned between them, they\nhad allowed their voices to sink to a whisper.\n\nThe older man--a stoutish, florid-looking individual, with small, keen\neyes, and skin pitted with small-pox--shrugged his shoulders at\nhis friend's question, and then said with an air of contemptuous\nindifference:\n\n\"It means, my good St. Just, that these two men whom you see down\nthere, calmly conning the programme of this evening's entertainment, and\npreparing to enjoy themselves to-night in the company of the late M. de\nMoliere, are two hell-hounds as powerful as they are cunning.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said St. Just, and much against his will a slight shudder\nran through his slim figure as he spoke. \"Foucquier-Tinville I know; I\nknow his cunning, and I know his power--but the other?\"\n\n\"The other?\" retorted de Batz lightly. \"Heron? Let me tell you, my\nfriend, that even the might and lust of that damned Public Prosecutor\npale before the power of Heron!\"\n\n\"But how? I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Ah! you have been in England so long, you lucky dog, and though no\ndoubt the main plot of our hideous tragedy has reached your ken, you\nhave no cognisance of the actors who play the principal parts on this\narena flooded with blood and carpeted with hate. They come and go, these\nactors, my good St. Just--they come and go. Marat is already the man\nof yesterday, Robespierre is the man of to-morrow. To-day we still have\nDanton and Foucquier-Tinville; we still have Pere Duchesne, and your\nown good cousin Antoine St. Just, but Heron and his like are with us\nalways.\"\n\n\"Spies, of course?\"\n\n\"Spies,\" assented the other. \"And what spies! Were you present at the\nsitting of the Assembly to-day?\"\n\n\"I was. I heard the new decree which already has passed into law. Ah! I\ntell you, friend, that we do not let the grass grow under our feet these\ndays. Robespierre wakes up one morning with a whim; by the afternoon\nthat whim has become law, passed by a servile body of men too terrified\nto run counter to his will, fearful lest they be accused of moderation\nor of humanity--the greatest crimes that can be committed nowadays.\"\n\n\"But Danton?\"\n\n\"Ah! Danton? He would wish to stem the tide that his own passions\nhave let loose; to muzzle the raging beasts whose fangs he himself has\nsharpened. I told you that Danton is still the man of to-day; to-morrow\nhe will be accused of moderation. Danton and moderation!--ye gods!\nEh? Danton, who thought the guillotine too slow in its work, and armed\nthirty soldiers with swords, so that thirty heads might fall at one\nand the same time. Danton, friend, will perish to-morrow accused of\ntreachery against the Revolution, of moderation towards her enemies;\nand curs like Heron will feast on the blood of lions like Danton and his\ncrowd.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, for he dared not raise his voice, and his whispers\nwere being drowned by the noise in the auditorium. The curtain, timed\nto be raised at eight o'clock, was still down, though it was close on\nhalf-past, and the public was growing impatient. There was loud stamping\nof feet, and a few shrill whistles of disapproval proceeded from the\ngallery.\n\n\"If Heron gets impatient,\" said de Batz lightly, when the noise had\nmomentarily subsided, \"the manager of this theatre and mayhap his leading\nactor and actress will spend an unpleasant day to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Always Heron!\" said St. Just, with a contemptuous smile.\n\n\"Yes, my friend,\" rejoined the other imperturbably, \"always Heron. And\nhe has even obtained a longer lease of existence this afternoon.\"\n\n\"By the new decree?\"\n\n\"Yes. The new decree. The agents of the Committee of General Security,\nof whom Heron is the chief, have from to-day powers of domiciliary\nsearch; they have full powers to proceed against all enemies of\npublic welfare. Isn't that beautifully vague? And they have absolute\ndiscretion; every one may become an enemy of public welfare, either by\nspending too much money or by spending too little, by laughing to-day\nor crying to-morrow, by mourning for one dead relative or rejoicing over\nthe execution of another. He may be a bad example to the public by\nthe cleanliness of his person or by the filth upon his clothes, he may\noffend by walking to-day and by riding in a carriage next week; the\nagents of the Committee of General Security shall alone decide what\nconstitutes enmity against public welfare. All prisons are to be opened\nat their bidding to receive those whom they choose to denounce; they\nhave henceforth the right to examine prisoners privately and without\nwitnesses, and to send them to trial without further warrants; their\nduty is clear--they must 'beat up game for the guillotine.' Thus is the\ndecree worded; they must furnish the Public Prosecutor with work to do,\nthe tribunals with victims to condemn, the Place de la Revolution\nwith death-scenes to amuse the people, and for their work they will\nbe rewarded thirty-five livres for every head that falls under the\nguillotine Ah! if Heron and his like and his myrmidons work hard and\nwell they can make a comfortable income of four or five thousand livres\na week. We are getting on, friend St. Just--we are getting on.\"\n\nHe had not raised his voice while he spoke, nor in the recounting of\nsuch inhuman monstrosity, such vile and bloodthirsty conspiracy against\nthe liberty, the dignity, the very life of an entire nation, did he\nappear to feel the slightest indignation; rather did a tone of amusement\nand even of triumph strike through his speech; and now he laughed\ngood-humouredly like an indulgent parent who is watching the naturally\ncruel antics of a spoilt boy.\n\n\"Then from this hell let loose upon earth,\" exclaimed St. Just hotly,\n\"must we rescue those who refuse to ride upon this tide of blood.\"\n\nHis cheeks were glowing, his eyes sparkled with enthusiasm. He looked\nvery young and very eager. Armand St. Just, the brother of Lady\nBlakeney, had something of the refined beauty of his lovely sister, but\nthe features though manly--had not the latent strength expressed in\nthem which characterised every line of Marguerite's exquisite face. The\nforehead suggested a dreamer rather than a thinker, the blue-grey eyes\nwere those of an idealist rather than of a man of action.\n\nDe Batz's keen piercing eyes had no doubt noted this, even whilst\nhe gazed at his young friend with that same look of good-humoured\nindulgence which seemed habitual to him.\n\n\"We have to think of the future, my good St. Just,\" he said after a\nslight pause, and speaking slowly and decisively, like a father rebuking\na hot-headed child, \"not of the present. What are a few lives worth\nbeside the great principles which we have at stake?\"\n\n\"The restoration of the monarchy--I know,\" retorted St. Just, still\nunsobered, \"but, in the meanwhile--\"\n\n\"In the meanwhile,\" rejoined de Batz earnestly, \"every victim to\nthe lust of these men is a step towards the restoration of law and\norder--that is to say, of the monarchy. It is only through these violent\nexcesses perpetrated in its name that the nation will realise how it is\nbeing fooled by a set of men who have only their own power and their own\nadvancement in view, and who imagine that the only way to that power is\nover the dead bodies of those who stand in their way. Once the nation is\nsickened by these orgies of ambition and of hate, it will turn against\nthese savage brutes, and gladly acclaim the restoration of all that\nthey are striving to destroy. This is our only hope for the future, and,\nbelieve me, friend, that every head snatched from the guillotine by\nyour romantic hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel, is a stone laid for the\nconsolidation of this infamous Republic.\"\n\n\"I'll not believe it,\" protested St. Just emphatically.\n\nDe Batz, with a gesture of contempt indicative also of complete\nself-satisfaction and unalterable self-belief, shrugged his broad\nshoulders. His short fat fingers, covered with rings, beat a tattoo upon\nthe ledge of the box.\n\nObviously, he was ready with a retort. His young friend's attitude\nirritated even more than it amused him. But he said nothing for the\nmoment, waiting while the traditional three knocks on the floor of the\nstage proclaimed the rise of the curtain. The growing impatience of the\naudience subsided as if by magic at the welcome call; everybody settled\ndown again comfortably in their seats, they gave up the contemplation of\nthe fathers of the people, and turned their full attention to the actors\non the boards.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. WIDELY DIVERGENT AIMS\n\nThis was Armand S. Just's first visit to Paris since that memorable day\nwhen first he decided to sever his connection from the Republican party,\nof which he and his beautiful sister Marguerite had at one time been\namongst the most noble, most enthusiastic followers. Already a year and\na half ago the excesses of the party had horrified him, and that was\nlong before they had degenerated into the sickening orgies which were\nculminating to-day in wholesale massacres and bloody hecatombs of\ninnocent victims.\n\nWith the death of Mirabeau the moderate Republicans, whose sole and\nentirely pure aim had been to free the people of France from the\nautocratic tyranny of the Bourbons, saw the power go from their clean\nhands to the grimy ones of lustful demagogues, who knew no law save\ntheir own passions of bitter hatred against all classes that were not as\nself-seeking, as ferocious as themselves.\n\nIt was no longer a question of a fight for political and religious\nliberty only, but one of class against class, man against man, and\nlet the weaker look to himself. The weaker had proved himself to\nbe, firstly, the man of property and substance, then the law-abiding\ncitizen, lastly the man of action who had obtained for the people that\nvery same liberty of thought and of belief which soon became so terribly\nmisused.\n\nArmand St. Just, one of the apostles of liberty, fraternity, and\nequality, soon found that the most savage excesses of tyranny were being\nperpetrated in the name of those same ideals which he had worshipped.\n\nHis sister Marguerite, happily married in England, was the final\ntemptation which caused him to quit the country the destinies of which\nhe no longer could help to control. The spark of enthusiasm which he\nand the followers of Mirabeau had tried to kindle in the hearts of an\noppressed people had turned to raging tongues of unquenchable flames.\nThe taking of the Bastille had been the prelude to the massacres of\nSeptember, and even the horror of these had since paled beside the\nholocausts of to-day.\n\nArmand, saved from the swift vengeance of the revolutionaries by the\ndevotion of the Scarlet Pimpernel, crossed over to England and enrolled\nhimself under the banner of the heroic chief. But he had been unable\nhitherto to be an active member of the League. The chief was loath to\nallow him to run foolhardy risks. The St. Justs--both Marguerite and\nArmand--were still very well-known in Paris. Marguerite was not a woman\neasily forgotten, and her marriage with an English \"aristo\" did not\nplease those republican circles who had looked upon her as their queen.\nArmand's secession from his party into the ranks of the emigres had\nsingled him out for special reprisals, if and whenever he could be got\nhold of, and both brother and sister had an unusually bitter enemy in\ntheir cousin Antoine St. Just--once an aspirant to Marguerite's hand,\nand now a servile adherent and imitator of Robespierre, whose ferocious\ncruelty he tried to emulate with a view to ingratiating himself with the\nmost powerful man of the day.\n\nNothing would have pleased Antoine St. Just more than the opportunity of\nshowing his zeal and his patriotism by denouncing his own kith and kin\nto the Tribunal of the Terror, and the Scarlet Pimpernel, whose own\nslender fingers were held on the pulse of that reckless revolution, had\nno wish to sacrifice Armand's life deliberately, or even to expose it to\nunnecessary dangers.\n\nThus it was that more than a year had gone by before Armand St. Just--an\nenthusiastic member of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel--was able\nto do aught for its service. He had chafed under the enforced restraint\nplaced upon him by the prudence of his chief, when, indeed, he was\nlonging to risk his life with the comrades whom he loved and beside the\nleader whom he revered.\n\nAt last, in the beginning of '94 he persuaded Blakeney to allow him\nto join the next expedition to France. What the principal aim of that\nexpedition was the members of the League did not know as yet, but what\nthey did know was that perils--graver even than hitherto--would attend\nthem on their way.\n\nThe circumstances had become very different of late. At first the\nimpenetrable mystery which had surrounded the personality of the chief\nhad been a full measure of safety, but now one tiny corner of that\nveil of mystery had been lifted by two rough pairs of hands at least;\nChauvelin, ex-ambassador at the English Court, was no longer in any\ndoubt as to the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel, whilst Collot\nd'Herbois had seen him at Boulogne, and had there been effectually\nfoiled by him.\n\nFour months had gone by since that day, and the Scarlet Pimpernel\nwas hardly ever out of France now; the massacres in Paris and in the\nprovinces had multiplied with appalling rapidity, the necessity for the\nselfless devotion of that small band of heroes had become daily, hourly\nmore pressing. They rallied round their chief with unbounded enthusiasm,\nand let it be admitted at once that the sporting instinct--inherent in\nthese English gentlemen--made them all the more keen, all the more\neager now that the dangers which beset their expeditions were increased\ntenfold.\n\nAt a word from the beloved leader, these young men--the spoilt darlings\nof society--would leave the gaieties, the pleasures, the luxuries of\nLondon or of Bath, and, taking their lives in their hands, they placed\nthem, together with their fortunes, and even their good names, at the\nservice of the innocent and helpless victims of merciless tyranny. The\nmarried men--Ffoulkes, my Lord Hastings, Sir Jeremiah Wallescourt--left\nwife and children at a call from the chief, at the cry of the wretched.\nArmand--unattached and enthusiastic--had the right to demand that he\nshould no longer be left behind.\n\nHe had only been away a little over fifteen months, and yet he found\nParis a different city from the one he had left immediately after the\nterrible massacres of September. An air of grim loneliness seemed to\nhang over her despite the crowds that thronged her streets; the men whom\nhe was wont to meet in public places fifteen months ago--friends and\npolitical allies--were no longer to be seen; strange faces surrounded\nhim on every side--sullen, glowering faces, all wearing a certain air of\nhorrified surprise and of vague, terrified wonder, as if life had\nbecome one awful puzzle, the answer to which must be found in the brief\ninterval between the swift passages of death.\n\nArmand St. Just, having settled his few simple belongings in the squalid\nlodgings which had been assigned to him, had started out after dark to\nwander somewhat aimlessly through the streets. Instinctively he seemed\nto be searching for a familiar face, some one who would come to him out\nof that merry past which he had spent with Marguerite in their pretty\napartment in the Rue St. Honore.\n\nFor an hour he wandered thus and met no one whom he knew. At times it\nappeared to him as if he did recognise a face or figure that passed him\nswiftly by in the gloom, but even before he could fully make up his mind\nto that, the face or figure had already disappeared, gliding furtively\ndown some narrow unlighted by-street, without turning to look to right\nor left, as if dreading fuller recognition. Armand felt a total stranger\nin his own native city.\n\nThe terrible hours of the execution on the Place de la Revolution\nwere fortunately over, the tumbrils no longer rattled along the uneven\npavements, nor did the death-cry of the unfortunate victims resound\nthrough the deserted streets. Armand was, on this first day of his\narrival, spared the sight of this degradation of the once lovely city;\nbut her desolation, her general appearance of shamefaced indigence and\nof cruel aloofness struck a chill in the young man's heart.\n\nIt was no wonder, therefore, when anon he was wending his way slowly\nback to his lodging he was accosted by a pleasant, cheerful voice, that\nhe responded to it with alacrity. The voice, of a smooth, oily timbre,\nas if the owner kept it well greased for purposes of amiable speech,\nwas like an echo of the past, when jolly, irresponsible Baron de Batz,\nerst-while officer of the Guard in the service of the late King,\nand since then known to be the most inveterate conspirator for the\nrestoration of the monarchy, used to amuse Marguerite by his vapid,\nsenseless plans for the overthrow of the newly-risen power of the\npeople.\n\nArmand was quite glad to meet him, and when de Batz suggested that a\ngood talk over old times would be vastly agreeable, the younger man\ngladly acceded. The two men, though certainly not mistrustful of one\nanother, did not seem to care to reveal to each other the place where\nthey lodged. De Batz at once proposed the avant-scene box of one of the\ntheatres as being the safest place where old friends could talk without\nfear of spying eyes or ears.\n\n\"There is no place so safe or so private nowadays, believe me, my young\nfriend,\" he said \"I have tried every sort of nook and cranny in this\naccursed town, now riddled with spies, and I have come to the conclusion\nthat a small avant-scene box is the most perfect den of privacy there\nis in the entire city. The voices of the actors on the stage and the hum\namong the audience in the house will effectually drown all individual\nconversation to every ear save the one for whom it is intended.\"\n\nIt is not difficult to persuade a young man who feels lonely and\nsomewhat forlorn in a large city to while away an evening in the\ncompanionship of a cheerful talker, and de Batz was essentially good\ncompany. His vapourings had always been amusing, but Armand now gave him\ncredit for more seriousness of purpose; and though the chief had warned\nhim against picking up acquaintances in Paris, the young man felt that\nthat restriction would certainly not apply to a man like de Batz, whose\nhot partisanship of the Royalist cause and hare-brained schemes for\nits restoration must make him at one with the League of the Scarlet\nPimpernel.\n\nArmand accepted the other's cordial invitation. He, too, felt that he\nwould indeed be safer from observation in a crowded theatre than in\nthe streets. Among a closely packed throng bent on amusement the\nsombrely-clad figure of a young man, with the appearance of a student or\nof a journalist, would easily pass unperceived.\n\nBut somehow, after the first ten minutes spent in de Batz' company\nwithin the gloomy shelter of the small avant-scene box, Armand already\nrepented of the impulse which had prompted him to come to the theatre\nto-night, and to renew acquaintanceship with the ex-officer of the late\nKing's Guard. Though he knew de Batz to be an ardent Royalist, and even\nan active adherent of the monarchy, he was soon conscious of a vague\nsense of mistrust of this pompous, self-complacent individual, whose\nevery utterance breathed selfish aims rather than devotion to a forlorn\ncause.\n\nTherefore, when the curtain rose at last on the first act of Moliere's\nwitty comedy, St. Just turned deliberately towards the stage and tried\nto interest himself in the wordy quarrel between Philinte and Alceste.\n\nBut this attitude on the part of the younger man did not seem to suit\nhis newly-found friend. It was clear that de Batz did not consider the\ntopic of conversation by any means exhausted, and that it had been more\nwith a view to a discussion like the present interrupted one that he had\ninvited St. Just to come to the theatre with him to-night, rather\nthan for the purpose of witnessing Mlle. Lange's debut in the part of\nCelimene.\n\nThe presence of St. Just in Paris had as a matter of fact astonished de\nBatz not a little, and had set his intriguing brain busy on conjectures.\nIt was in order to turn these conjectures into certainties that he had\ndesired private talk with the young man.\n\nHe waited silently now for a moment or two, his keen, small eyes resting\nwith evident anxiety on Armand's averted head, his fingers still beating\nthe impatient tattoo upon the velvet-covered cushion of the box. Then at\nthe first movement of St. Just towards him he was ready in an instant to\nre-open the subject under discussion.\n\nWith a quick nod of his head he called his young friend's attention back\nto the men in the auditorium.\n\n\"Your good cousin Antoine St. Just is hand and glove with Robespierre\nnow,\" he said. \"When you left Paris more than a year ago you could\nafford to despise him as an empty-headed windbag; now, if you desire to\nremain in France, you will have to fear him as a power and a menace.\"\n\n\"Yes, I knew that he had taken to herding with the wolves,\" rejoined\nArmand lightly. \"At one time he was in love with my sister. I thank God\nthat she never cared for him.\"\n\n\"They say that he herds with the wolves because of this disappointment,\"\nsaid de Batz. \"The whole pack is made up of men who have been\ndisappointed, and who have nothing more to lose. When all these wolves\nwill have devoured one another, then and then only can we hope for the\nrestoration of the monarchy in France. And they will not turn on one\nanother whilst prey for their greed lies ready to their jaws. Your\nfriend the Scarlet Pimpernel should feed this bloody revolution of ours\nrather than starve it, if indeed he hates it as he seems to do.\"\n\nHis restless eyes peered with eager interrogation into those of the\nyounger man. He paused as if waiting for a reply; then, as St. Just\nremained silent, he reiterated slowly, almost in the tones of a\nchallenge:\n\n\"If indeed he hates this bloodthirsty revolution of ours as he seems to\ndo.\"\n\nThe reiteration implied a doubt. In a moment St. Just's loyalty was up\nin arms.\n\n\"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" he said, \"cares naught for your political aims.\nThe work of mercy that he does, he does for justice and for humanity.\"\n\n\"And for sport,\" said de Batz with a sneer, \"so I've been told.\"\n\n\"He is English,\" assented St. Just, \"and as such will never own to\nsentiment. Whatever be the motive, look at the result!\n\n\"Yes! a few lives stolen from the guillotine.\"\n\n\"Women and children--innocent victims--would have perished but for his\ndevotion.\"\n\n\"The more innocent they were, the more helpless, the more pitiable,\nthe louder would their blood have cried for reprisals against the wild\nbeasts who sent them to their death.\"\n\nSt. Just made no reply. It was obviously useless to attempt to argue\nwith this man, whose political aims were as far apart from those of the\nScarlet Pimpernel as was the North Pole from the South.\n\n\"If any of you have influence over that hot-headed leader of yours,\"\ncontinued de Batz, unabashed by the silence of his friend, \"I wish to\nGod you would exert it now.\"\n\n\"In what way?\" queried St. Just, smiling in spite of himself at the\nthought of his or any one else's control over Blakeney and his plans.\n\nIt was de Batz' turn to be silent. He paused for a moment or two, then\nhe asked abruptly:\n\n\"Your Scarlet Pimpernel is in Paris now, is he not?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you,\" replied Armand.\n\n\"Bah! there is no necessity to fence with me, my friend. The moment I\nset eyes on you this afternoon I knew that you had not come to Paris\nalone.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, my good de Batz,\" rejoined the young man earnestly;\n\"I came to Paris alone.\"\n\n\"Clever parrying, on my word--but wholly wasted on my unbelieving ears.\nDid I not note at once that you did not seem overpleased to-day when I\naccosted you?\"\n\n\"Again you are mistaken. I was very pleased to meet you, for I had felt\nsingularly lonely all day, and was glad to shake a friend by the hand.\nWhat you took for displeasure was only surprise.\"\n\n\"Surprise? Ah, yes! I don't wonder that you were surprised to see me\nwalking unmolested and openly in the streets of Paris--whereas you had\nheard of me as a dangerous conspirator, eh?--and as a man who has the\nentire police of his country at his heels--on whose head there is a\nprice--what?\"\n\n\"I knew that you had made several noble efforts to rescue the\nunfortunate King and Queen from the hands of these brutes.\"\n\n\"All of which efforts were unsuccessful,\" assented de Batz\nimperturbably, \"every one of them having been either betrayed by some\nd----d confederate or ferreted out by some astute spy eager for gain. Yes,\nmy friend, I made several efforts to rescue King Louis and Queen Marie\nAntoinette from the scaffold, and every time I was foiled, and yet here\nI am, you see, unscathed and free. I walk about the streets boldly, and\ntalk to my friends as I meet them.\"\n\n\"You are lucky,\" said St. Just, not without a tinge of sarcasm.\n\n\"I have been prudent,\" retorted de Batz. \"I have taken the trouble to\nmake friends there where I thought I needed them most--the mammon of\nunrighteousness, you know-what?\"\n\nAnd he laughed a broad, thick laugh of perfect self-satisfaction.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" rejoined St. Just, with the tone of sarcasm still more\napparent in his voice now. \"You have Austrian money at your disposal.\"\n\n\"Any amount,\" said the other complacently, \"and a great deal of it\nsticks to the grimy fingers of these patriotic makers of revolutions.\nThus do I ensure my own safety. I buy it with the Emperor's money, and\nthus am I able to work for the restoration of the monarchy in France.\"\n\nAgain St. Just was silent. What could he say? Instinctively now, as the\nfleshy personality of the Gascon Royalist seemed to spread itself out\nand to fill the tiny box with his ambitious schemes and his far-reaching\nplans, Armand's thoughts flew back to that other plotter, the man\nwith the pure and simple aims, the man whose slender fingers had never\nhandled alien gold, but were ever there ready stretched out to the\nhelpless and the weak, whilst his thoughts were only of the help that he\nmight give them, but never of his own safety.\n\nDe Batz, however, seemed blandly unconscious of any such disparaging\nthoughts in the mind of his young friend, for he continued quite\namiably, even though a note of anxiety seemed to make itself felt now in\nhis smooth voice:\n\n\"We advance slowly, but step by step, my good St. Just,\" he said. \"I\nhave not been able to save the monarchy in the person of the King or the\nQueen, but I may yet do it in the person of the Dauphin.\"\n\n\"The Dauphin,\" murmured St. Just involuntarily.\n\nThat involuntary murmur, scarcely audible, so soft was it, seemed in\nsome way to satisfy de Batz, for the keenness of his gaze relaxed, and\nhis fat fingers ceased their nervous, intermittent tattoo on the ledge\nof the box.\n\n\"Yes! the Dauphin,\" he said, nodding his head as if in answer to his\nown thoughts, \"or rather, let me say, the reigning King of France--Louis\nXVII, by the grace of God--the most precious life at present upon the\nwhole of this earth.\"\n\n\"You are right there, friend de Batz,\" assented Armand fervently,\n\"the most precious life, as you say, and one that must be saved at all\ncosts.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said de Batz calmly, \"but not by your friend the Scarlet\nPimpernel.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nScarce were those two little words out of St. Just's mouth than he\nrepented of them. He bit his lip, and with a dark frown upon his face he\nturned almost defiantly towards his friend.\n\nBut de Batz smiled with easy bonhomie.\n\n\"Ah, friend Armand,\" he said, \"you were not cut out for diplomacy, nor\nyet for intrigue. So then,\" he added more seriously, \"that gallant hero,\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel, has hopes of rescuing our young King from the\nclutches of Simon the cobbler and of the herd of hyenas on the watch for\nhis attenuated little corpse, eh?\"\n\n\"I did not say that,\" retorted St. Just sullenly.\n\n\"No. But I say it. Nay! nay! do not blame yourself, my over-loyal young\nfriend. Could I, or any one else, doubt for a moment that sooner or\nlater your romantic hero would turn his attention to the most pathetic\nsight in the whole of Europe--the child-martyr in the Temple prison?\nThe wonder were to me if the Scarlet Pimpernel ignored our little King\naltogether for the sake of his subjects. No, no; do not think for a\nmoment that you have betrayed your friend's secret to me. When I met you\nso luckily today I guessed at once that you were here under the banner\nof the enigmatical little red flower, and, thus guessing, I even went a\nstep further in my conjecture. The Scarlet Pimpernel is in Paris now in\nthe hope of rescuing Louis XVII from the Temple prison.\"\n\n\"If that is so, you must not only rejoice but should be able to help.\"\n\n\"And yet, my friend, I do neither the one now nor mean to do the other\nin the future,\" said de Batz placidly. \"I happen to be a Frenchman, you\nsee.\"\n\n\"What has that to do with such a question?\"\n\n\"Everything; though you, Armand, despite that you are a Frenchman too,\ndo not look through my spectacles. Louis XVII is King of France, my good\nSt. Just; he must owe his freedom and his life to us Frenchmen, and to\nno one else.\"\n\n\"That is sheer madness, man,\" retorted Armand. \"Would you have the child\nperish for the sake of your own selfish ideas?\"\n\n\"You may call them selfish if you will; all patriotism is in a measure\nselfish. What does the rest of the world care if we are a republic or a\nmonarchy, an oligarchy or hopeless anarchy? We work for ourselves and to\nplease ourselves, and I for one will not brook foreign interference.\"\n\n\"Yet you work with foreign money!\"\n\n\"That is another matter. I cannot get money in France, so I get it where\nI can; but I can arrange for the escape of Louis XVII is King of France,\nmy good St. Just; he must of France should belong the honour and glory\nof having saved our King.\"\n\nFor the third time now St. Just allowed the conversation to drop; he was\ngazing wide-eyed, almost appalled at this impudent display of well-nigh\nferocious selfishness and vanity. De Batz, smiling and complacent, was\nleaning back in his chair, looking at his young friend with perfect\ncontentment expressed in every line of his pock-marked face and in the\nvery attitude of his well-fed body. It was easy enough now to understand\nthe remarkable immunity which this man was enjoying, despite the many\nfoolhardy plots which he hatched, and which had up to now invariably\ncome to naught.\n\nA regular braggart and empty windbag, he had taken but one good care,\nand that was of his own skin. Unlike other less fortunate Royalists of\nFrance, he neither fought in the country nor braved dangers in town. He\nplayed a safer game--crossed the frontier and constituted himself agent\nof Austria; he succeeded in gaining the Emperor's money for the good of\nthe Royalist cause, and for his own most especial benefit.\n\nEven a less astute man of the world than was Armand St. Just would\neasily have guessed that de Batz' desire to be the only instrument in\nthe rescue of the poor little Dauphin from the Temple was not actuated\nby patriotism, but solely by greed. Obviously there was a rich reward\nwaiting for him in Vienna the day that he brought Louis XVII safely into\nAustrian territory; that reward he would miss if a meddlesome Englishman\ninterfered in this affair. Whether in this wrangle he risked the life of\nthe child-King or not mattered to him not at all. It was de Batz who was\nto get the reward, and whose welfare and prosperity mattered more than\nthe most precious life in Europe.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE DEMON CHANCE\n\nSt. Just would have given much to be back in his lonely squalid lodgings\nnow. Too late did he realise how wise had been the dictum which had\nwarned him against making or renewing friendships in France.\n\nMen had changed with the times. How terribly they had changed! Personal\nsafety had become a fetish with most--a goal so difficult to attain that\nit had to be fought for and striven for, even at the expense of humanity\nand of self-respect.\n\nSelfishness--the mere, cold-blooded insistence for\nself-advancement--ruled supreme. De Batz, surfeited with foreign money,\nused it firstly to ensure his own immunity, scattering it to right and\nleft to still the ambition of the Public Prosecutor or to satisfy the\ngreed of innumerable spies.\n\nWhat was left over he used for the purpose of pitting the bloodthirsty\ndemagogues one against the other, making of the National Assembly a\ngigantic bear-den, wherein wild beasts could rend one another limb from\nlimb.\n\nIn the meanwhile, what cared he--he said it himself--whether hundreds\nof innocent martyrs perished miserably and uselessly? They were the\nnecessary food whereby the Revolution was to be satiated and de Batz'\nschemes enabled to mature. The most precious life in Europe even was\nonly to be saved if its price went to swell the pockets of de Batz, or\nto further his future ambitions.\n\nTimes had indeed changed an entire nation. St. Just felt as sickened\nwith this self-seeking Royalist as he did with the savage brutes who\nstruck to right or left for their own delectation. He was meditating\nimmediate flight back to his lodgings, with a hope of finding there\na word for him from the chief--a word to remind him that men did live\nnowadays who had other aims besides their own advancement--other ideals\nbesides the deification of self.\n\nThe curtain had descended on the first act, and traditionally, as the\nworks of M. de Moliere demanded it, the three knocks were heard again\nwithout any interval. St. Just rose ready with a pretext for parting\nwith his friend. The curtain was being slowly drawn up on the second\nact, and disclosed Alceste in wrathful conversation with Celimene.\n\nAlceste's opening speech is short. Whilst the actor spoke it Armand had\nhis back to the stage; with hand outstretched, he was murmuring what\nhe hoped would prove a polite excuse for thus leaving his amiable host\nwhile the entertainment had only just begun.\n\nDe Batz--vexed and impatient--had not by any means finished with his\nfriend yet. He thought that his specious arguments--delivered with\nboundless conviction--had made some impression on the mind of the young\nman. That impression, however, he desired to deepen, and whilst Armand\nwas worrying his brain to find a plausible excuse for going away, de\nBatz was racking his to find one for keeping him here.\n\nThen it was that the wayward demon Chance intervened. Had St. Just\nrisen but two minutes earlier, had his active mind suggested the\ndesired excuse more readily, who knows what unspeakable sorrow, what\nheartrending misery, what terrible shame might have been spared both\nhim and those for whom he cared? Those two minutes--did he but know\nit--decided the whole course of his future life. The excuse hovered on\nhis lips, de Batz reluctantly was preparing to bid him good-bye,\nwhen Celimene, speaking common-place words enough in answer to her\nquarrelsome lover, caused him to drop the hand which he was holding out\nto his friend and to turn back towards the stage.\n\nIt was an exquisite voice that had spoken--a voice mellow and tender,\nwith deep tones in it that betrayed latent power. The voice had caused\nArmand to look, the lips that spoke forged the first tiny link of that\nchain which riveted him forever after to the speaker.\n\nIt is difficult to say if such a thing really exists as love at first\nsight. Poets and romancists will have us believe that it does; idealists\nswear by it as being the only true love worthy of the name.\n\nI do not know if I am prepared to admit their theory with regard to\nArmand St. Just. Mlle. Lange's exquisite voice certainly had charmed\nhim to the extent of making him forget his mistrust of de Batz and his\ndesire to get away. Mechanically almost he sat down again, and leaning\nboth elbows on the edge of the box, he rested his chin in his hand, and\nlistened. The words which the late M. de Moliere puts into the mouth\nof Celimene are trite and flippant enough, yet every time that Mlle.\nLange's lips moved Armand watched her, entranced.\n\nThere, no doubt, the matter would have ended: a young man fascinated\nby a pretty woman on the stage--'tis a small matter, and one from which\nthere doth not often spring a weary trail of tragic circumstances.\nArmand, who had a passion for music, would have worshipped at the shrine\nof Mlle. Lange's perfect voice until the curtain came down on the last\nact, had not his friend de Batz seen the keen enchantment which the\nactress had produced on the young enthusiast.\n\nNow de Batz was a man who never allowed an opportunity to slip by, if\nthat opportunity led towards the furtherance of his own desires. He\ndid not want to lose sight of Armand just yet, and here the good demon\nChance had given him an opportunity for obtaining what he wanted.\n\nHe waited quietly until the fall of the curtain at the end of Act II.;\nthen, as Armand, with a sigh of delight, leaned back in his chair,\nand closing his eyes appeared to be living the last half-hour all over\nagain, de Batz remarked with well-assumed indifference:\n\n\"Mlle. Lange is a promising young actress. Do you not think so, my\nfriend?\"\n\n\"She has a perfect voice--it was exquisite melody to the ear,\" replied\nArmand. \"I was conscious of little else.\"\n\n\"She is a beautiful woman, nevertheless,\" continued de Batz with a\nsmile. \"During the next act, my good St. Just, I would suggest that you\nopen your eyes as well as your ears.\"\n\nArmand did as he was bidden. The whole appearance of Mlle. Lange\nseemed in harmony with her voice. She was not very tall, but eminently\ngraceful, with a small, oval face and slender, almost childlike figure,\nwhich appeared still more so above the wide hoops and draped panniers of\nthe fashions of Moliere's time.\n\nWhether she was beautiful or not the young man hardly knew. Measured\nby certain standards, she certainly was not so, for her mouth was not\nsmall, and her nose anything but classical in outline. But the eyes\nwere brown, and they had that half-veiled look in them--shaded with long\nlashes that seemed to make a perpetual tender appeal to the masculine\nheart: the lips, too, were full and moist, and the teeth dazzling white.\nYes!--on the whole we might easily say that she was exquisite, even\nthough we did not admit that she was beautiful.\n\nPainter David has made a sketch of her; we have all seen it at the Musee\nCarnavalet, and all wondered why that charming, if irregular, little\nface made such an impression of sadness.\n\nThere are five acts in \"Le Misanthrope,\" during which Celimene is almost\nconstantly on the stage. At the end of the fourth act de Batz said\ncasually to his friend:\n\n\"I have the honour of personal acquaintanceship with Mlle. Lange. An you\ncare for an introduction to her, we can go round to the green room after\nthe play.\"\n\nDid prudence then whisper, \"Desist\"? Did loyalty to the leader murmur,\n\"Obey\"? It were indeed difficult to say. Armand St. Just was not\nfive-and-twenty, and Mlle. Lange's melodious voice spoke louder than the\nwhisperings of prudence or even than the call of duty.\n\nHe thanked de Batz warmly, and during the last half-hour, while the\nmisanthropical lover spurned repentant Celimene, he was conscious of a\ncurious sensation of impatience, a tingling of his nerves, a wild, mad\nlonging to hear those full moist lips pronounce his name, and have those\nlarge brown eyes throw their half-veiled look into his own.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. MADEMOISELLE LANGE\n\nThe green-room was crowded when de Batz and St. Just arrived there after\nthe performance. The older man cast a hasty glance through the open\ndoor. The crowd did not suit his purpose, and he dragged his companion\nhurriedly away from the contemplation of Mlle. Lange, sitting in a far\ncorner of the room, surrounded by an admiring throng, and by innumerable\nfloral tributes offered to her beauty and to her success.\n\nDe Batz without a word led the way back towards the stage. Here, by the\ndim light of tallow candles fixed in sconces against the surrounding\nwalls, the scene-shifters were busy moving drop-scenes, back cloths and\nwings, and paid no heed to the two men who strolled slowly up and down\nsilently, each wrapped in his own thoughts.\n\nArmand walked with his hands buried in his breeches pockets, his head\nbent forward on his chest; but every now and again he threw quick,\napprehensive glances round him whenever a firm step echoed along the\nempty stage or a voice rang clearly through the now deserted theatre.\n\n\"Are we wise to wait here?\" he asked, speaking to himself rather than to\nhis companion.\n\nHe was not anxious about his own safety; but the words of de Batz had\nimpressed themselves upon his mind: \"Heron and his spies we have always\nwith us.\"\n\nFrom the green-room a separate foyer and exit led directly out into\nthe street. Gradually the sound of many voices, the loud laughter and\noccasional snatches of song which for the past half-hour had proceeded\nfrom that part of the house, became more subdued and more rare. One by\none the friends of the artists were leaving the theatre, after having\npaid the usual banal compliments to those whom they favoured, or\npresented the accustomed offering of flowers to the brightest star of\nthe night.\n\nThe actors were the first to retire, then the older actresses, the ones\nwho could no longer command a court of admirers round them. They all\nfiled out of the greenroom and crossed the stage to where, at the\nback, a narrow, rickety wooden stairs led to their so-called\ndressing-rooms--tiny, dark cubicles, ill-lighted, unventilated, where\nsome half-dozen of the lesser stars tumbled over one another while\nremoving wigs and grease-paint.\n\nArmand and de Batz watched this exodus, both with equal impatience.\nMlle. Lange was the last to leave the green-room. For some time, since\nthe crowd had become thinner round her, Armand had contrived to catch\nglimpses of her slight, elegant figure. A short passage led from the\nstage to the green-room door, which was wide open, and at the corner\nof this passage the young man had paused from time to time in his walk,\ngazing with earnest admiration at the dainty outline of the young girl's\nhead, with its wig of powdered curls that seemed scarcely whiter than\nthe creamy brilliance of her skin.\n\nDe Batz did not watch Mlle. Lange beyond casting impatient looks in the\ndirection of the crowd that prevented her leaving the green-room. He\ndid watch Armand, however--noted his eager look, his brisk and alert\nmovements, the obvious glances of admiration which he cast in the\ndirection of the young actress, and this seemed to afford him a\nconsiderable amount of contentment.\n\nThe best part of an hour had gone by since the fall of the curtain\nbefore Mlle. Lange finally dismissed her many admirers, and de Batz had\nthe satisfaction of seeing her running down the passage, turning back\noccasionally in order to bid gay \"good-nights\" to the loiterers who\nwere loath to part from her. She was a child in all her movements, quite\nunconscious of self or of her own charms, but frankly delighted with\nher success. She was still dressed in the ridiculous hoops and panniers\npertaining to her part, and the powdered peruke hid the charm of her\nown hair; the costume gave a certain stilted air to her unaffected\npersonality, which, by this very sense of contrast, was essentially\nfascinating.\n\nIn her arms she held a huge sheaf of sweet-scented narcissi, the spoils\nof some favoured spot far away in the South. Armand thought that never\nin his life had he seen anything so winsome or so charming.\n\nHaving at last said the positively final adieu, Mlle. Lange with a happy\nlittle sigh turned to run down the passage.\n\nShe came face to face with Armand, and gave a sudden little gasp of\nterror. It was not good these days to come on any loiterer unawares.\n\nBut already de Batz had quickly joined his friend, and his smooth,\npleasant voice, and podgy, beringed hand extended towards Mlle. Lange,\nwere sufficient to reassure her.\n\n\"You were so surrounded in the green-room, mademoiselle,\" he said\ncourteously, \"I did not venture to press in among the crowd of\nyour admirers. Yet I had the great wish to present my respectful\ncongratulations in person.\"\n\n\"Ah! c'est ce cher de Batz!\" exclaimed mademoiselle gaily, in that\nexquisitely rippling voice of hers. \"And where in the world do you\nspring from, my friend?\n\n\"Hush-sh-sh!\" he whispered, holding her small bemittened hand in\nhis, and putting one finger to his lips with an urgent entreaty for\ndiscretion; \"not my name, I beg of you, fair one.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" she retorted lightly, even though her full lips trembled now as\nshe spoke and belied her very words. \"You need have no fear whilst\nyou are in this part of the house. It is an understood thing that the\nCommittee of General Security does not send its spies behind the curtain\nof a theatre. Why, if all of us actors and actresses were sent to\nthe guillotine there would be no play on the morrow. Artistes are not\nreplaceable in a few hours; those that are in existence must perforce be\nspared, or the citizens who govern us now would not know where to spend\ntheir evenings.\"\n\nBut though she spoke so airily and with her accustomed gaiety, it was\neasily perceived that even on this childish mind the dangers which beset\nevery one these days had already imprinted their mark of suspicion and\nof caution.\n\n\"Come into my dressing-room,\" she said. \"I must not tarry here any\nlonger, for they will be putting out the lights. But I have a room to\nmyself, and we can talk there quite agreeably.\"\n\nShe led the way across the stage towards the wooden stairs. Armand, who\nduring this brief colloquy between his friend and the young girl had\nkept discreetly in the background, felt undecided what to do. But at\na peremptory sign from de Batz he, too, turned in the wake of the gay\nlittle lady, who ran swiftly up the rickety steps, humming snatches of\npopular songs the while, and not turning to see if indeed the two men\nwere following her.\n\nShe had the sheaf of narcissi still in her arms, and the door of her\ntiny dressing-room being open, she ran straight in and threw the flowers\ndown in a confused, sweet-scented mass upon the small table that\nstood at one end of the room, littered with pots and bottles, letters,\nmirrors, powder-puffs, silk stockings, and cambric handkerchiefs.\n\nThen she turned and faced the two men, a merry look of unalterable\ngaiety dancing in her eyes.\n\n\"Shut the door, mon ami,\" she said to de Batz, \"and after that sit down\nwhere you can, so long as it is not on my most precious pot of unguent\nor a box of costliest powder.\"\n\nWhile de Batz did as he was told, she turned to Armand and said with a\npretty tone of interrogation in her melodious voice:\n\n\"Monsieur?\"\n\n\"St. Just, at your service, mademoiselle,\" said Armand, bowing very low\nin the most approved style obtaining at the English Court.\n\n\"St. Just?\" she repeated, a look of puzzlement in her brown eyes.\n\"Surely--\"\n\n\"A kinsman of citizen St. Just, whom no doubt you know, mademoiselle,\"\nhe exclaimed.\n\n\"My friend Armand St. Just,\" interposed de Batz, \"is practically a\nnew-comer in Paris. He lives in England habitually.\"\n\n\"In England?\" she exclaimed. \"Oh! do tell me all about England. I would\nlove to go there. Perhaps I may have to go some day. Oh! do sit down, de\nBatz,\" she continued, talking rather volubly, even as a delicate blush\nheightened the colour in her cheeks under the look of obvious admiration\nfrom Armand St. Just's expressive eyes.\n\nShe swept a handful of delicate cambric and silk from off a chair,\nmaking room for de Batz' portly figure. Then she sat upon the sofa, and\nwith an inviting gesture and a call from the eyes she bade Armand sit\ndown next to her. She leaned back against the cushions, and the table\nbeing close by, she stretched out a hand and once more took up the bunch\nof narcissi, and while she talked to Armand she held the snow-white\nblooms quite close to her face--so close, in fact, that he could not\nsee her mouth and chin, only her dark eyes shone across at him over the\nheads of the blossoms.\n\n\"Tell me all about England,\" she reiterated, settling herself down among\nthe cushions like a spoilt child who is about to listen to an oft-told\nfavourite story.\n\nArmand was vexed that de Batz was sitting there. He felt he could have\ntold this dainty little lady quite a good deal about England if only his\npompous, fat friend would have had the good sense to go away.\n\nAs it was, he felt unusually timid and gauche, not quite knowing what to\nsay, a fact which seemed to amuse Mlle. Lange not a little.\n\n\"I am very fond of England,\" he said lamely; \"my sister is married to an\nEnglishman, and I myself have taken up my permanent residence there.\"\n\n\"Among the society of emigres?\" she queried.\n\nThen, as Armand made no reply, de Batz interposed quickly:\n\n\"Oh! you need not fear to admit it, my good Armand; Mademoiselle Lange,\nhas many friends among the emigres--have you not, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" she replied lightly; \"I have friends everywhere. Their\npolitical views have nothing to do with me. Artistes, I think, should\nhave naught to do with politics. You see, citizen St. Just, I never\ninquired of you what were your views. Your name and kinship would\nproclaim you a partisan of citizen Robespierre, yet I find you in the\ncompany of M. de Batz; and you tell me that you live in England.\"\n\n\"He is no partisan of citizen Robespierre,\" again interposed de Batz;\n\"in fact, mademoiselle, I may safely tell you, I think, that my friend\nhas but one ideal on this earth, whom he has set up in a shrine, and\nwhom he worships with all the ardour of a Christian for his God.\"\n\n\"How romantic!\" she said, and she looked straight at Armand. \"Tell me,\nmonsieur, is your ideal a woman or a man?\"\n\nHis look answered her, even before he boldly spoke the two words:\n\n\"A woman.\"\n\nShe took a deep draught of sweet, intoxicating scent from the narcissi,\nand his gaze once more brought blushes to her cheeks. De Batz'\ngood-humoured laugh helped her to hide this unwonted access of\nconfusion.\n\n\"That was well turned, friend Armand,\" he said lightly; \"but I assure\nyou, mademoiselle, that before I brought him here to-night his ideal was\na man.\"\n\n\"A man!\" she exclaimed, with a contemptuous little pout. \"Who was it?\"\n\n\"I know no other name for him but that of a small, insignificant\nflower--the Scarlet Pimpernel,\" replied de Batz.\n\n\"The Scarlet Pimpernel!\" she ejaculated, dropping the flowers suddenly,\nand gazing on Armand with wide, wondering eyes. \"And do you know him,\nmonsieur?\"\n\nHe was frowning despite himself, despite the delight which he felt at\nsitting so close to this charming little lady, and feeling that in a\nmeasure his presence and his personality interested her. But he felt\nirritated with de Batz, and angered at what he considered the latter's\nindiscretion. To him the very name of his leader was almost a sacred\none; he was one of those enthusiastic devotees who only care to name the\nidol of their dreams with bated breath, and only in the ears of those\nwho would understand and sympathise.\n\nAgain he felt that if only he could have been alone with mademoiselle he\ncould have told her all about the Scarlet Pimpernel, knowing that in her\nhe would find a ready listener, a helping and a loving heart; but as it\nwas he merely replied tamely enough:\n\n\"Yes, mademoiselle, I do know him.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\" she queried eagerly; \"spoken to him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh! do tell me all about him. You know quite a number of us in France\nhave the greatest possible admiration for your national hero. We know,\nof course, that he is an enemy of our Government--but, oh! we feel that\nhe is not an enemy of France because of that. We are a nation of heroes,\ntoo, monsieur,\" she added with a pretty, proud toss of the head; \"we can\nappreciate bravery and resource, and we love the mystery that surrounds\nthe personality of your Scarlet Pimpernel. But since you know him,\nmonsieur, tell me what is he like?\"\n\nArmand was smiling again. He was yielding himself up wholly to the charm\nwhich emanated from this young girl's entire being, from her gaiety\nand her unaffectedness, her enthusiasm, and that obvious artistic\ntemperament which caused her to feel every sensation with superlative\nkeenness and thoroughness.\n\n\"What is he like?\" she insisted.\n\n\"That, mademoiselle,\" he replied, \"I am not at liberty to tell you.\"\n\n\"Not at liberty to tell me!\" she exclaimed; \"but monsieur, if I command\nyou--\"\n\n\"At risk of falling forever under the ban of your displeasure,\nmademoiselle, I would still remain silent on that subject.\"\n\nShe gazed on him with obvious astonishment. It was quite an unusual\nthing for this spoilt darling of an admiring public to be thus openly\nthwarted in her whims.\n\n\"How tiresome and pedantic!\" she said, with a shrug of her pretty\nshoulders and a moue of discontent. \"And, oh! how ungallant! You have\nlearnt ugly, English ways, monsieur; for there, I am told, men hold\ntheir womenkind in very scant esteem. There!\" she added, turning with\na mock air of hopelessness towards de Batz, \"am I not a most unlucky\nwoman? For the past two years I have used my best endeavours to catch\nsight of that interesting Scarlet Pimpernel; here do I meet monsieur,\nwho actually knows him (so he says), and he is so ungallant that he even\nrefuses to satisfy the first cravings of my just curiosity.\"\n\n\"Citizen St. Just will tell you nothing now, mademoiselle,\" rejoined\nde Batz with his good-humoured laugh; \"it is my presence, I assure you,\nwhich is setting a seal upon his lips. He is, believe me, aching to\nconfide in you, to share in your enthusiasm, and to see your beautiful\neyes glowing in response to his ardour when he describes to you the\nexploits of that prince of heroes. En tete-a-tete one day, you will, I\nknow, worm every secret out of my discreet friend Armand.\"\n\nMademoiselle made no comment on this--that is to say, no audible\ncomment--but she buried the whole of her face for a few seconds among\nthe flowers, and Armand from amongst those flowers caught sight of a\npair of very bright brown eyes which shone on him with a puzzled look.\n\nShe said nothing more about the Scarlet Pimpernel or about England just\nthen, but after awhile she began talking of more indifferent subjects:\nthe state of the weather, the price of food, the discomforts of her own\nhouse, now that the servants had been put on perfect equality with their\nmasters.\n\nArmand soon gathered that the burning questions of the day, the horrors\nof massacres, the raging turmoil of politics, had not affected her very\ndeeply as yet. She had not troubled her pretty head very much about the\nsocial and humanitarian aspect of the present seething revolution.\nShe did not really wish to think about it at all. An artiste to her\nfinger-tips, she was spending her young life in earnest work, striving\nto attain perfection in her art, absorbed in study during the day, and\nin the expression of what she had learnt in the evenings.\n\nThe terrors of the guillotine affected her a little, but somewhat\nvaguely still. She had not realised that any dangers could assail her\nwhilst she worked for the artistic delectation of the public.\n\nIt was not that she did not understand what went on around her, but that\nher artistic temperament and her environment had kept her aloof from\nit all. The horrors of the Place de la Revolution made her shudder, but\nonly in the same way as the tragedies of M. Racine or of Sophocles which\nshe had studied caused her to shudder, and she had exactly the same\nsympathy for poor Queen Marie Antoinette as she had for Mary Stuart, and\nshed as many tears for King Louis as she did for Polyeucte.\n\nOnce de Batz mentioned the Dauphin, but mademoiselle put up her hand\nquickly and said in a trembling voice, whilst the tears gathered in her\neyes:\n\n\"Do not speak of the child to me, de Batz. What can I, a lonely,\nhard-working woman, do to help him? I try not to think of him, for if\nI did, knowing my own helplessness, I feel that I could hate my\ncountrymen, and speak my bitter hatred of them across the footlights;\nwhich would be more than foolish,\" she added naively, \"for it would not\nhelp the child, and I should be sent to the guillotine. But oh sometimes\nI feel that I would gladly die if only that poor little child-martyr\nwere restored to those who love him and given back once more to joy and\nhappiness. But they would not take my life for his, I am afraid,\"\nshe concluded, smiling through her tears. \"My life is of no value in\ncomparison with his.\"\n\nSoon after this she dismissed her two visitors. De Batz, well content\nwith the result of this evening's entertainment, wore an urbane, bland\nsmile on his rubicund face. Armand, somewhat serious and not a little in\nlove, made the hand-kiss with which he took his leave last as long as he\ncould.\n\n\"You will come and see me again, citizen St. Just?\" she asked after that\npreliminary leave-taking.\n\n\"At your service, mademoiselle,\" he replied with alacrity.\n\n\"How long do you stay in Paris?\"\n\n\"I may be called away at any time.\"\n\n\"Well, then, come to-morrow. I shall be free towards four o'clock.\nSquare du Roule. You cannot miss the house. Any one there will tell you\nwhere lives citizeness Lange.\"\n\n\"At your service, mademoiselle,\" he replied.\n\nThe words sounded empty and meaningless, but his eyes, as they took\nfinal leave of her, spoke the gratitude and the joy which he felt.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE TEMPLE PRISON\n\nIt was close on midnight when the two friends finally parted company\noutside the doors of the theatre. The night air struck with biting\nkeenness against them when they emerged from the stuffy, overheated\nbuilding, and both wrapped their caped cloaks tightly round their\nshoulders. Armand--more than ever now--was anxious to rid himself of\nde Batz. The Gascon's platitudes irritated him beyond the bounds of\nforbearance, and he wanted to be alone, so that he might think over\nthe events of this night, the chief event being a little lady with an\nenchanting voice and the most fascinating brown eyes he had ever seen.\n\nSelf-reproach, too, was fighting a fairly even fight with the excitement\nthat had been called up by that same pair of brown eyes. Armand for the\npast four or five hours had acted in direct opposition to the earnest\nadvice given to him by his chief; he had renewed one friendship which\nhad been far better left in oblivion, and he had made an acquaintance\nwhich already was leading him along a path that he felt sure his comrade\nwould disapprove. But the path was so profusely strewn with scented\nnarcissi that Armand's sensitive conscience was quickly lulled to rest\nby the intoxicating fragrance.\n\nLooking neither to right nor left, he made his way very quickly up the\nRue Richelieu towards the Montmartre quarter, where he lodged.\n\nDe Batz stood and watched him for as long as the dim lights of the\nstreet lamps illumined his slim, soberly-clad figure; then he turned on\nhis heel and walked off in the opposite direction.\n\nHis florid, pock-marked face wore an air of contentment not altogether\nunmixed with a kind of spiteful triumph.\n\n\"So, my pretty Scarlet Pimpernel,\" he muttered between his closed lips,\n\"you wish to meddle in my affairs, to have for yourself and your friends\nthe credit and glory of snatching the golden prize from the clutches of\nthese murderous brutes. Well, we shall see! We shall see which is the\nwiliest--the French ferret or the English fox.\"\n\nHe walked deliberately away from the busy part of the town, turning\nhis back on the river, stepping out briskly straight before him, and\nswinging his gold-beaded cane as he walked.\n\nThe streets which he had to traverse were silent and deserted, save\noccasionally where a drinking or an eating house had its swing-doors\nstill invitingly open. From these places, as de Batz strode rapidly by,\ncame sounds of loud voices, rendered raucous by outdoor oratory; volleys\nof oaths hurled irreverently in the midst of impassioned speeches;\ninterruptions from rowdy audiences that vied with the speaker in\ninvectives and blasphemies; wordy war-fares that ended in noisy\nvituperations; accusations hurled through the air heavy with tobacco\nsmoke and the fumes of cheap wines and of raw spirits.\n\nDe Batz took no heed of these as he passed, anxious only that the crowd\nof eating-house politicians did not, as often was its wont, turn out\npele-mele into the street, and settle its quarrel by the weight\nof fists. He did not wish to be embroiled in a street fight, which\ninvariably ended in denunciations and arrests, and was glad when\npresently he had left the purlieus of the Palais Royal behind him, and\ncould strike on his left toward the lonely Faubourg du Temple.\n\nFrom the dim distance far away came at intervals the mournful sound of a\nroll of muffled drums, half veiled by the intervening hubbub of the\nbusy night life of the great city. It proceeded from the Place de la\nRevolution, where a company of the National Guard were on night watch\nround the guillotine. The dull, intermittent notes of the drum came as\na reminder to the free people of France that the watchdog of a vengeful\nrevolution was alert night and day, never sleeping, ever wakeful,\n\"beating up game for the guillotine,\" as the new decree framed to-day by\nthe Government of the people had ordered that it should do.\n\nFrom time to time now the silence of this lonely street was broken by\na sudden cry of terror, followed by the clash of arms, the inevitable\nvolley of oaths, the call for help, the final moan of anguish. They\nwere the ever-recurring brief tragedies which told of denunciations, of\ndomiciliary search, of sudden arrests, of an agonising desire for\nlife and for freedom--for life under these same horrible conditions of\nbrutality and of servitude, for freedom to breathe, if only a day or two\nlonger, this air, polluted by filth and by blood.\n\nDe Batz, hardened to these scenes, paid no heed to them. He had heard it\nso often, that cry in the night, followed by death-like silence; it\ncame from comfortable bourgeois houses, from squalid lodgings, or\nlonely cul-de-sac, wherever some hunted quarry was run to earth by the\nnewly-organised spies of the Committee of General Security.\n\nFive and thirty livres for every head that falls trunkless into the\nbasket at the foot of the guillotine! Five and thirty pieces of silver,\nnow as then, the price of innocent blood. Every cry in the night, every\ncall for help, meant game for the guillotine, and five and thirty livres\nin the hands of a Judas.\n\nAnd de Batz walked on unmoved by what he saw and heard, swinging his\ncane and looking satisfied. Now he struck into the Place de la\nVictoire, and looked on one of the open-air camps that had recently been\nestablished where men, women, and children were working to provide arms\nand accoutrements for the Republican army that was fighting the whole of\nEurope.\n\nThe people of France were up in arms against tyranny; and on the open\nplaces of their mighty city they were encamped day and night forging\nthose arms which were destined to make them free, and in the meantime\nwere bending under a yoke of tyranny more complete, more grinding\nand absolute than any that the most despotic kings had ever dared to\ninflict.\n\nHere by the light of resin torches, at this late hour of the night,\nraw lads were being drilled into soldiers, half-naked under the cutting\nblast of the north wind, their knees shaking under them, their arms and\nlegs blue with cold, their stomachs empty, and their teeth chattering\nwith fear; women were sewing shirts for the great improvised army,\nwith eyes straining to see the stitches by the flickering light of\nthe torches, their throats parched with the continual inhaling of\nsmoke-laden air; even children, with weak, clumsy little fingers, were\npicking rags to be woven into cloth again all, all these slaves were\nworking far into the night, tired, hungry, and cold, but working\nunceasingly, as the country had demanded it: \"the people of France in\narms against tyranny!\" The people of France had to set to work to make\narms, to clothe the soldiers, the defenders of the people's liberty.\n\nAnd from this crowd of people--men, women, and children--there came\nscarcely a sound, save raucous whispers, a moan or a sigh quickly\nsuppressed. A grim silence reigned in this thickly-peopled camp; only\nthe crackling of the torches broke that silence now and then, or the\nflapping of canvas in the wintry gale. They worked on sullen, desperate,\nand starving, with no hope of payment save the miserable rations wrung\nfrom poor tradespeople or miserable farmers, as wretched, as oppressed\nas themselves; no hope of payment, only fear of punishment, for that was\never present.\n\nThe people of France in arms against tyranny were not allowed to forget\nthat grim taskmaster with the two great hands stretched upwards, holding\nthe knife which descended mercilessly, indiscriminately on necks that\ndid not bend willingly to the task.\n\nA grim look of gratified desire had spread over de Batz' face as he\nskirted the open-air camp. Let them toil, let them groan, let them\nstarve! The more these clouts suffer, the more brutal the heel that\ngrinds them down, the sooner will the Emperor's money accomplish its\nwork, the sooner will these wretches be clamoring for the monarchy,\nwhich would mean a rich reward in de Batz' pockets.\n\nTo him everything now was for the best: the tyranny, the brutality, the\nmassacres. He gloated in the holocausts with as much satisfaction as did\nthe most bloodthirsty Jacobin in the Convention. He would with his own\nhands have wielded the guillotine that worked too slowly for his ends.\nLet that end justify the means, was his motto. What matter if the future\nKing of France walked up to his throne over steps made of headless\ncorpses and rendered slippery with the blood of martyrs?\n\nThe ground beneath de Batz' feet was hard and white with the frost.\nOverhead the pale, wintry moon looked down serene and placid on this\ngiant city wallowing in an ocean of misery.\n\nThere, had been but little snow as yet this year, and the cold was\nintense. On his right now the Cimetiere des SS. Innocents lay peaceful\nand still beneath the wan light of the moon. A thin covering of snow lay\nevenly alike on grass mounds and smooth stones. Here and there a broken\ncross with chipped arms still held pathetically outstretched, as if in\na final appeal for human love, bore mute testimony to senseless excesses\nand spiteful desire for destruction.\n\nBut here within the precincts of the dwelling of the eternal Master a\nsolemn silence reigned; only the cold north wind shook the branches of\nthe yew, causing them to send forth a melancholy sigh into the night,\nand to shed a shower of tiny crystals of snow like the frozen tears of\nthe dead.\n\nAnd round the precincts of the lonely graveyard, and down narrow streets\nor open places, the night watchmen went their rounds, lanthorn in hand,\nand every five minutes their monotonous call rang clearly out in the\nnight:\n\n\"Sleep, citizens! everything is quiet and at peace!\"\n\n\n\nWe may take it that de Batz did not philosophise over-much on what went\non around him. He had walked swiftly up the Rue St. Martin, then turning\nsharply to his right he found himself beneath the tall, frowning\nwalls of the Temple prison, the grim guardian of so many secrets, such\nterrible despair, such unspeakable tragedies.\n\nHere, too, as in the Place de la Revolution, an intermittent roll of\nmuffled drums proclaimed the ever-watchful presence of the National\nGuard. But with that exception not a sound stirred round the grim and\nstately edifice; there were no cries, no calls, no appeals around its\nwalls. All the crying and wailing was shut in by the massive stone that\ntold no tales.\n\nDim and flickering lights shone behind several of the small windows in\nthe facade of the huge labyrinthine building. Without any hesitation de\nBatz turned down the Rue du Temple, and soon found himself in front\nof the main gates which gave on the courtyard beyond. The sentinel\nchallenged him, but he had the pass-word, and explained that he desired\nto have speech with citizen Heron.\n\nWith a surly gesture the guard pointed to the heavy bell-pull up against\nthe gate, and de Batz pulled it with all his might. The long clang of\nthe brazen bell echoed and re-echoed round the solid stone walls. Anon\na tiny judas in the gate was cautiously pushed open, and a peremptory\nvoice once again challenged the midnight intruder.\n\nDe Batz, more peremptorily this time, asked for citizen Heron, with whom\nhe had immediate and important business, and a glimmer of a piece of\nsilver which he held up close to the judas secured him the necessary\nadmittance.\n\nThe massive gates slowly swung open on their creaking hinges, and as de\nBatz passed beneath the archway they closed again behind him.\n\nThe concierge's lodge was immediately on his left. Again he was\nchallenged, and again gave the pass-word. But his face was apparently\nknown here, for no serious hindrance to proceed was put in his way.\n\nA man, whose wide, lean frame was but ill-covered by a threadbare coat\nand ragged breeches, and with soleless shoes on his feet, was told off\nto direct the citoyen to citizen Heron's rooms. The man walked slowly\nalong with bent knees and arched spine, and shuffled his feet as he\nwalked; the bunch of keys which he carried rattled ominously in his\nlong, grimy hands; the passages were badly lighted, and he also carried\na lanthorn to guide himself on the way.\n\nClosely followed by de Batz, he soon turned into the central corridor,\nwhich is open to the sky above, and was spectrally alight now with\nflag-stones and walls gleaming beneath the silvery sheen of the moon,\nand throwing back the fantastic elongated shadows of the two men as they\nwalked.\n\nOn the left, heavily barred windows gave on the corridor, as did here\nand there the massive oaken doors, with their gigantic hinges and bolts,\non the steps of which squatted groups of soldiers wrapped in their\ncloaks, with wild, suspicious eyes beneath their capotes, peering at the\nmidnight visitor as he passed.\n\nThere was no thought of silence here. The very walls seemed alive with\nsounds, groans and tears, loud wails and murmured prayers; they exuded\nfrom the stones and trembled on the frost-laden air.\n\nOccasionally at one of the windows a pair of white hands would appear,\ngrasping the heavy iron bar, trying to shake it in its socket, and\nmayhap, above the hands, the dim vision of a haggard face, a man's or a\nwoman's, trying to get a glimpse of the outside world, a final look at\nthe sky, before the last journey to the place of death to-morrow. Then\none of the soldiers, with a loud, angry oath, would struggle to his\nfeet, and with the butt-end of his gun strike at the thin, wan fingers\ntill their hold on the iron bar relaxed, and the pallid face beyond\nwould sink back into the darkness with a desperate cry of pain.\n\nA quick, impatient sigh escaped de Batz' lips. He had skirted the wide\ncourtyard in the wake of his guide, and from where he was he could see\nthe great central tower, with its tiny windows lighted from within, the\ngrim walls behind which the descendant of the world's conquerors, the\nbearer of the proudest name in Europe, and wearer of its most ancient\ncrown, had spent the last days of his brilliant life in abject shame,\nsorrow, and degradation. The memory had swiftly surged up before him of\nthat night when he all but rescued King Louis and his family from this\nsame miserable prison: the guard had been bribed, the keeper corrupted,\neverything had been prepared, save the reckoning with the one\nirresponsible factor--chance!\n\nHe had failed then and had tried again, and again had failed; a fortune\nhad been his reward if he had succeeded. He had failed, but even now,\nwhen his footsteps echoed along the flagged courtyard, over which\nan unfortunate King and Queen had walked on their way to their last\nignominious Calvary, he hugged himself with the satisfying thought that\nwhere he had failed at least no one else had succeeded.\n\nWhether that meddlesome English adventurer, who called himself the\nScarlet Pimpernel, had planned the rescue of King Louis or of Queen\nMarie Antoinette at any time or not--that he did not know; but on one\npoint at least he was more than ever determined, and that was that\nno power on earth should snatch from him the golden prize offered by\nAustria for the rescue of the little Dauphin.\n\n\"I would sooner see the child perish, if I cannot save him myself,\" was\nthe burning thought in this man's tortuous brain. \"And let that accursed\nEnglishman look to himself and to his d----d confederates,\" he added,\nmuttering a fierce oath beneath his breath.\n\nA winding, narrow stone stair, another length or two of corridor, and\nhis guide's shuffling footsteps paused beside a low iron-studded door\nlet into the solid stone. De Batz dismissed his ill-clothed guide and\npulled the iron bell-handle which hung beside the door.\n\nThe bell gave forth a dull and broken clang, which seemed like an echo\nof the wails of sorrow that peopled the huge building with their weird\nand monotonous sounds.\n\nDe Batz--a thoroughly unimaginative person--waited patiently beside the\ndoor until it was opened from within, and he was confronted by a tall\nstooping figure, wearing a greasy coat of snuff-brown cloth, and holding\nhigh above his head a lanthorn that threw its feeble light on de Batz'\njovial face and form.\n\n\"It is even I, citizen Heron,\" he said, breaking in swiftly on the\nother's ejaculation of astonishment, which threatened to send his name\nechoing the whole length of corridors and passages, until round every\ncorner of the labyrinthine house of sorrow the murmur would be borne\non the wings of the cold night breeze: \"Citizen Heron is in parley with\nci-devant Baron de Batz!\"\n\nA fact which would have been equally unpleasant for both these worthies.\n\n\"Enter!\" said Heron curtly.\n\nHe banged the heavy door to behind his visitor; and de Batz, who seemed\nto know his way about the place, walked straight across the narrow\nlanding to where a smaller door stood invitingly open.\n\nHe stepped boldly in, the while citizen Heron put the lanthorn down on\nthe floor of the couloir, and then followed his nocturnal visitor into\nthe room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE COMMITTEE'S AGENT\n\nIt was a narrow, ill-ventilated place, with but one barred window that\ngave on the courtyard. An evil-smelling lamp hung by a chain from the\ngrimy ceiling, and in a corner of the room a tiny iron stove shed more\nunpleasant vapour than warm glow around.\n\nThere was but little furniture: two or three chairs, a table which was\nlittered with papers, and a corner-cupboard--the open doors of which\nrevealed a miscellaneous collection--bundles of papers, a tin saucepan,\na piece of cold sausage, and a couple of pistols. The fumes of stale\ntobacco-smoke hovered in the air, and mingled most unpleasantly with\nthose of the lamp above, and of the mildew that penetrated through the\nwalls just below the roof.\n\nHeron pointed to one of the chairs, and then sat down on the other,\nclose to the table, on which he rested his elbow. He picked up a\nshort-stemmed pipe, which he had evidently laid aside at the sound of\nthe bell, and having taken several deliberate long-drawn puffs from it,\nhe said abruptly:\n\n\"Well, what is it now?\"\n\nIn the meanwhile de Batz had made himself as much at home in this\nuncomfortable room as he possibly could. He had deposited his hat and\ncloak on one rickety rush-bottomed chair, and drawn another close to\nthe fire. He sat down with one leg crossed over the other, his podgy\nbe-ringed hand wandering with loving gentleness down the length of his\nshapely calf.\n\nHe was nothing if not complacent, and his complacency seemed highly to\nirritate his friend Heron.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" reiterated the latter, drawing his visitor's\nattention roughly to himself by banging his fist on the table. \"Out with\nit! What do you want? Why have you come at this hour of the night to\ncompromise me, I suppose--bring your own d--d neck and mine into the\nsame noose--what?\"\n\n\"Easy, easy, my friend,\" responded de Batz imperturbably; \"waste not\nso much time in idle talk. Why do I usually come to see you? Surely you\nhave had no cause to complain hitherto of the unprofitableness of my\nvisits to you?\"\n\n\"They will have to be still more profitable to me in the future,\"\ngrowled the other across the table. \"I have more power now.\"\n\n\"I know you have,\" said de Batz suavely. \"The new decree? What? You\nmay denounce whom you please, search whom you please, arrest whom you\nplease, and send whom you please to the Supreme Tribunal without giving\nthem the slightest chance of escape.\"\n\n\"Is it in order to tell me all this that you have come to see me at this\nhour of the night?\" queried Heron with a sneer.\n\n\"No; I came at this hour of the night because I surmised that in the\nfuture you and your hell-hounds would be so busy all day 'beating\nup game for the guillotine' that the only time you would have at the\ndisposal of your friends would be the late hours of the night. I saw you\nat the theatre a couple of hours ago, friend Heron; I didn't think to\nfind you yet abed.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you want?\"\n\n\"Rather,\" retorted de Batz blandly, \"shall we say, what do YOU want,\ncitizen Heron?\"\n\n\"For what?\n\n\"For my continued immunity at the hands of yourself and your pack?\"\n\nHeron pushed his chair brusquely aside and strode across the narrow room\ndeliberately facing the portly figure of de Batz, who with head slightly\ninclined on one side, his small eyes narrowed till they appeared\nmere slits in his pockmarked face, was steadily and quite placidly\ncontemplating this inhuman monster who had this very day been given\nuncontrolled power over hundreds of thousands of human lives.\n\nHeron was one of those tall men who look mean in spite of their height.\nHis head was small and narrow, and his hair, which was sparse and lank,\nfell in untidy strands across his forehead. He stooped slightly from the\nneck, and his chest, though wide, was hollow between the shoulders. But\nhis legs were big and bony, slightly bent at the knees, like those of an\nill-conditioned horse.\n\nThe face was thin and the cheeks sunken; the eyes, very large and\nprominent, had a look in them of cold and ferocious cruelty, a look\nwhich contrasted strangely with the weakness and petty greed apparent\nin the mouth, which was flabby, with full, very red lips, and chin that\nsloped away to the long thin neck.\n\nEven at this moment as he gazed on de Batz the greed and the cruelty\nin him were fighting one of those battles the issue of which is always\nuncertain in men of his stamp.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said slowly, \"that I am prepared to treat with you\nany longer. You are an intolerable bit of vermin that has annoyed\nthe Committee of General Security for over two years now. It would\nbe excessively pleasant to crush you once and for all, as one would a\nbuzzing fly.\"\n\n\"Pleasant, perhaps, but immeasurably foolish,\" rejoined de Batz coolly;\n\"you would only get thirty-five livres for my head, and I offer you ten\ntimes that amount for the self-same commodity.\"\n\n\"I know, I know; but the whole thing has become too dangerous.\"\n\n\"Why? I am very modest. I don't ask a great deal. Let your hounds keep\noff my scent.\"\n\n\"You have too many d--d confederates.\"\n\n\"Oh! Never mind about the others. I am not bargaining about them. Let\nthem look after themselves.\"\n\n\"Every time we get a batch of them, one or the other denounces you.\"\n\n\"Under torture, I know,\" rejoined de Batz placidly, holding his podgy\nhands to the warm glow of the fire. \"For you have started torture in\nyour house of Justice now, eh, friend Heron? You and your friend the\nPublic Prosecutor have gone the whole gamut of devilry--eh?\"\n\n\"What's that to you?\" retorted the other gruffly.\n\n\"Oh, nothing, nothing! I was even proposing to pay you three thousand\nfive hundred livres for the privilege of taking no further interest in\nwhat goes on inside this prison!\"\n\n\"Three thousand five hundred!\" ejaculated Heron involuntarily, and this\ntime even his eyes lost their cruelty; they joined issue with the mouth\nin an expression of hungering avarice.\n\n\"Two little zeros added to the thirty-five, which is all you would get\nfor handing me over to your accursed Tribunal,\" said de Batz, and, as if\nthoughtlessly, his hand wandered to the inner pocket of his coat, and\na slight rustle as of thin crisp paper brought drops of moisture to the\nlips of Heron.\n\n\"Leave me alone for three weeks and the money is yours,\" concluded de\nBatz pleasantly.\n\nThere was silence in the room now. Through the narrow barred window\nthe steely rays of the moon fought with the dim yellow light of the oil\nlamp, and lit up the pale face of the Committee's agent with its lines\nof cruelty in sharp conflict with those of greed.\n\n\"Well! is it a bargain?\" asked de Batz at last in his usual smooth, oily\nvoice, as he half drew from out his pocket that tempting little bundle\nof crisp printed paper. \"You have only to give me the usual receipt for\nthe money and it is yours.\"\n\nHeron gave a vicious snarl.\n\n\"It is dangerous, I tell you. That receipt, if it falls into some cursed\nmeddler's hands, would send me straight to the guillotine.\"\n\n\"The receipt could only fall into alien hands,\" rejoined de Batz\nblandly, \"if I happened to be arrested, and even in that case they\ncould but fall into those of the chief agent of the Committee of General\nSecurity, and he hath name Heron. You must take some risks, my friend.\nI take them too. We are each in the other's hands. The bargain is quite\nfair.\"\n\nFor a moment or two longer Heron appeared to be hesitating whilst de\nBatz watched him with keen intentness. He had no doubt himself as to the\nissue. He had tried most of these patriots in his own golden crucible,\nand had weighed their patriotism against Austrian money, and had never\nfound the latter wanting.\n\nHe had not been here to-night if he were not quite sure. This inveterate\nconspirator in the Royalist cause never took personal risks. He looked\non Heron now, smiling to himself the while with perfect satisfaction.\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Committee's agent with sudden decision, \"I'll take\nthe money. But on one condition.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That you leave little Capet alone.\"\n\n\"The Dauphin!\"\n\n\"Call him what you like,\" said Heron, taking a step nearer to de Batz,\nand from his great height glowering down in fierce hatred and rage upon\nhis accomplice; \"call the young devil what you like, but leave us to\ndeal with him.\"\n\n\"To kill him, you mean? Well, how can I prevent it, my friend?\"\n\n\"You and your like are always plotting to get him out of here. I won't\nhave it. I tell you I won't have it. If the brat disappears I am a dead\nman. Robespierre and his gang have told me as much. So you leave him\nalone, or I'll not raise a finger to help you, but will lay my own hands\non your accursed neck.\"\n\nHe looked so ferocious and so merciless then, that despite himself, the\nselfish adventurer, the careless self-seeking intriguer, shuddered with\na quick wave of unreasoning terror. He turned away from Heron's piercing\ngaze, the gaze of a hyena whose prey is being snatched from beneath its\nnails. For a moment he stared thoughtfully into the fire.\n\nHe heard the other man's heavy footsteps cross and re-cross the narrow\nroom, and was conscious of the long curved shadow creeping up the\nmildewed wall or retreating down upon the carpetless floor.\n\nSuddenly, without any warning he felt a grip upon his shoulder. He gave\na start and almost uttered a cry of alarm which caused Heron to laugh.\nThe Committee's agent was vastly amused at his friend's obvious access\nof fear. There was nothing that he liked better than that he should\ninspire dread in the hearts of all those with whom he came in contact.\n\n\"I am just going on my usual nocturnal round,\" he said abruptly. \"Come\nwith me, citizen de Batz.\"\n\nA certain grim humour was apparent in his face as he proffered this\ninvitation, which sounded like a rough command. As de Batz seemed to\nhesitate he nodded peremptorily to him to follow. Already he had gone\ninto the hall and picked up his lanthorn. From beneath his waistcoat he\ndrew forth a bunch of keys, which he rattled impatiently, calling to his\nfriend to come.\n\n\"Come, citizen,\" he said roughly. \"I wish to show you the one treasure\nin this house which your d--d fingers must not touch.\"\n\nMechanically de Batz rose at last. He tried to be master of the terror\nwhich was invading his very bones. He would not own to himself even that\nhe was afraid, and almost audibly he kept murmuring to himself that he\nhad no cause for fear.\n\nHeron would never touch him. The spy's avarice, his greed of money were\na perfect safeguard for any man who had the control of millions, and\nHeron knew, of course, that he could make of this inveterate plotter\na comfortable source of revenue for himself. Three weeks would soon be\nover, and fresh bargains could be made time and again, while de Batz was\nalive and free.\n\nHeron was still waiting at the door, even whilst de Batz wondered\nwhat this nocturnal visitation would reveal to him of atrocity and of\noutrage. He made a final effort to master his nervousness, wrapped his\ncloak tightly around him, and followed his host out of the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE MOST PRECIOUS LIFE IN EUROPE\n\nOnce more he was being led through the interminable corridors of the\ngigantic building. Once more from the narrow, barred windows close by\nhim he heard the heart-breaking sighs, the moans, the curses which spoke\nof tragedies that he could only guess.\n\nHeron was walking on ahead of him, preceding him by some fifty metres or\nso, his long legs covering the distances more rapidly than de Batz could\nfollow them. The latter knew his way well about the old prison. Few men\nin Paris possessed that accurate knowledge of its intricate passages and\nits network of cells and halls which de Batz had acquired after close\nand persevering study.\n\nHe himself could have led Heron to the doors of the tower where the\nlittle Dauphin was being kept imprisoned, but unfortunately he did not\npossess the keys that would open all the doors which led to it. There\nwere sentinels at every gate, groups of soldiers at each end of every\ncorridor, the great--now empty--courtyards, thronged with prisoners in\nthe daytime, were alive with soldiery even now. Some walked up and\ndown with fixed bayonet on shoulder, others sat in groups on the stone\ncopings or squatted on the ground, smoking or playing cards, but all of\nthem were alert and watchful.\n\nHeron was recognised everywhere the moment he appeared, and though in\nthese days of equality no one presented arms, nevertheless every guard\nstood aside to let him pass, or when necessary opened a gate for the\npowerful chief agent of the Committee of General Security.\n\nIndeed, de Batz had no keys such as these to open the way for him to the\npresence of the martyred little King.\n\nThus the two men wended their way on in silence, one preceding the\nother. De Batz walked leisurely, thought-fully, taking stock of\neverything he saw--the gates, the barriers, the positions of sentinels\nand warders, of everything in fact that might prove a help or a\nhindrance presently, when the great enterprise would be hazarded. At\nlast--still in the wake of Heron--he found himself once more behind the\nmain entrance gate, underneath the archway on which gave the guichet of\nthe concierge.\n\nHere, too, there seemed to be an unnecessary number of soldiers: two\nwere doing sentinel outside the guichet, but there were others in a file\nagainst the wall.\n\nHeron rapped with his keys against the door of the concierge's lodge,\nthen, as it was not immediately opened from within, he pushed it open\nwith his foot.\n\n\"The concierge?\" he queried peremptorily.\n\nFrom a corner of the small panelled room there came a grunt and a reply:\n\n\"Gone to bed, quoi!\"\n\nThe man who previously had guided de Batz to Heron's door slowly\nstruggled to his feet. He had been squatting somewhere in the gloom, and\nhad been roused by Heron's rough command. He slouched forward now still\ncarrying a boot in one hand and a blacking brush in the other.\n\n\"Take this lanthorn, then,\" said the chief agent with a snarl directed\nat the sleeping concierge, \"and come along. Why are you still here?\" he\nadded, as if in after-thought.\n\n\"The citizen concierge was not satisfied with the way I had done his\nboots,\" muttered the man, with an evil leer as he spat contemptuously on\nthe floor; \"an aristo, quoi? A hell of a place this... twenty cells\nto sweep out every day... and boots to clean for every aristo of a\nconcierge or warder who demands it.... Is that work for a free born\npatriot, I ask?\"\n\n\"Well, if you are not satisfied, citoyen Dupont,\" retorted Heron dryly,\n\"you may go when you like, you know there are plenty of others ready to\ndo your work...\"\n\n\"Nineteen hours a day, and nineteen sous by way of payment.... I have\nhad fourteen days of this convict work...\"\n\nHe continued to mutter under his breath, whilst Heron, paying no further\nheed to him, turned abruptly towards a group of soldiers stationed\noutside.\n\n\"En avant, corporal!\" he said; \"bring four men with you... we go up to\nthe tower.\"\n\nThe small procession was formed. On ahead the lanthorn-bearer, with\narched spine and shaking knees, dragging shuffling footsteps along the\ncorridor, then the corporal with two of his soldiers, then Heron closely\nfollowed by de Batz, and finally two more soldiers bringing up the rear.\n\nHeron had given the bunch of keys to the man Dupont. The latter, on\nahead, holding the lanthorn aloft, opened one gate after another. At\neach gate he waited for the little procession to file through, then he\nre-locked the gate and passed on.\n\nUp two or three flights of winding stairs set in the solid stone, and\nthe final heavy door was reached.\n\nDe Batz was meditating. Heron's precautions for the safe-guarding of the\nmost precious life in Europe were more complete than he had anticipated.\nWhat lavish liberality would be required! what superhuman ingenuity and\nboundless courage in order to break down all the barriers that had been\nset up round that young life that flickered inside this grim tower!\n\nOf these three requisites the corpulent, complacent intriguer possessed\nonly the first in a considerable degree. He could be exceedingly liberal\nwith the foreign money which he had at his disposal. As for courage and\ningenuity, he believed that he possessed both, but these qualities had\nnot served him in very good stead in the attempts which he had made at\ndifferent times to rescue the unfortunate members of the Royal Family\nfrom prison. His overwhelming egotism would not admit for a moment that\nin ingenuity and pluck the Scarlet Pimpernel and his English followers\ncould outdo him, but he did wish to make quite sure that they would\nnot interfere with him in the highly remunerative work of saving the\nDauphin.\n\nHeron's impatient call roused him from these meditations. The little\nparty had come to a halt outside a massive iron-studded door.\n\nAt a sign from the chief agent the soldiers stood at attention. He then\ncalled de Batz and the lanthorn-bearer to him.\n\nHe took a key from his breeches pocket, and with his own hand unlocked\nthe massive door. He curtly ordered the lanthorn-bearer and de Batz to\ngo through, then he himself went in, and finally once more re-locked the\ndoor behind him, the soldiers remaining on guard on the landing outside.\n\nNow the three men were standing in a square antechamber, dank and dark,\ndevoid of furniture save for a large cupboard that filled the whole of\none wall; the others, mildewed and stained, were covered with a greyish\npaper, which here and there hung away in strips.\n\nHeron crossed this ante-chamber, and with his knuckles rapped against a\nsmall door opposite.\n\n\"Hola!\" he shouted, \"Simon, mon vieux, tu es la?\"\n\nFrom the inner room came the sound of voices, a man's and a woman's,\nand now, as if in response to Heron's call, the shrill tones of a child.\nThere was some shuffling, too, of footsteps, and some pushing about\nof furniture, then the door was opened, and a gruff voice invited the\nbelated visitors to enter.\n\nThe atmosphere in this further room was so thick that at first de Batz\nwas only conscious of the evil smells that pervaded it; smells which\nwere made up of the fumes of tobacco, of burning coke, of a smoky lamp,\nand of stale food, and mingling through it all the pungent odour of raw\nspirits.\n\nHeron had stepped briskly in, closely followed by de Batz. The man\nDupont with a mutter of satisfaction put down his lanthorn and curled\nhimself up in a corner of the antechamber. His interest in the spectacle\nso favoured by citizen Heron had apparently been exhausted by constant\nrepetition.\n\nDe Batz looked round him with keen curiosity with which disgust was\nready enough to mingle.\n\nThe room itself might have been a large one; it was almost impossible to\njudge of its size, so crammed was it with heavy and light furniture of\nevery conceivable shape and type. There was a monumental wooden bedstead\nin one corner, a huge sofa covered in black horsehair in another. A\nlarge table stood in the centre of the room, and there were at least\nfour capacious armchairs round it. There were wardrobes and cabinets, a\ndiminutive washstand and a huge pier-glass, there were innumerable boxes\nand packing-cases, cane-bottomed chairs and what-nots every-where. The\nplace looked like a depot for second-hand furniture.\n\nIn the midst of all the litter de Batz at last became conscious of two\npeople who stood staring at him and at Heron. He saw a man before him,\nsomewhat fleshy of build, with smooth, mouse-coloured hair brushed away\nfrom a central parting, and ending in a heavy curl above each ear; the\neyes were wide open and pale in colour, the lips unusually thick and\nwith a marked downward droop. Close beside him stood a youngish-looking\nwoman, whose unwieldy bulk, however, and pallid skin revealed the\nsedentary life and the ravages of ill-health.\n\nBoth appeared to regard Heron with a certain amount of awe, and de Batz\nwith a vast measure of curiosity.\n\nSuddenly the woman stood aside, and in the far corner of the room\nthere was displayed to the Gascon Royalist's cold, calculating gaze the\npathetic figure of the uncrowned King of France.\n\n\"How is it Capet is not yet in bed?\" queried Heron as soon as he caught\nsight of the child.\n\n\"He wouldn't say his prayers this evening,\" replied Simon with a coarse\nlaugh, \"and wouldn't drink his medicine. Bah!\" he added with a snarl,\n\"this is a place for dogs and not for human folk.\"\n\n\"If you are not satisfied, mon vieux,\" retorted Heron curtly, \"you can\nsend in your resignation when you like. There are plenty who will be\nglad of the place.\"\n\nThe ex-cobbler gave another surly growl and expectorated on the floor in\nthe direction where stood the child.\n\n\"Little vermin,\" he said, \"he is more trouble than man or woman can\nbear.\"\n\nThe boy in the meanwhile seemed to take but little notice of the vulgar\ninsults put upon him by his guardian. He stood, a quaint, impassive\nlittle figure, more interested apparently in de Batz, who was a stranger\nto him, than in the three others whom he knew. De Batz noted that the\nchild looked well nourished, and that he was warmly clad in a rough\nwoollen shirt and cloth breeches, with coarse grey stockings and thick\nshoes; but he also saw that the clothes were indescribably filthy, as\nwere the child's hands and face. The golden curls, among which a young\nand queenly mother had once loved to pass her slender perfumed fingers,\nnow hung bedraggled, greasy, and lank round the little face, from the\nlines of which every trace of dignity and of simplicity had long since\nbeen erased.\n\nThere was no look of the martyr about this child now, even though,\nmayhap, his small back had often smarted under his vulgar tutor's\nrough blows; rather did the pale young face wear the air of sullen\nindifference, and an abject desire to please, which would have appeared\nheart-breaking to any spectator less self-seeking and egotistic than was\nthis Gascon conspirator.\n\nMadame Simon had called him to her while her man and the citizen Heron\nwere talking, and the child went readily enough, without any sign of\nfear. She took the corner of her coarse dirty apron in her hand, and\nwiped the boy's mouth and face with it.\n\n\"I can't keep him clean,\" she said with an apologetic shrug of the\nshoulders and a look at de Batz. \"There now,\" she added, speaking once\nmore to the child, \"drink like a good boy, and say your lesson to please\nmaman, and then you shall go to bed.\"\n\nShe took a glass from the table, which was filled with a clear liquid\nthat de Batz at first took to be water, and held it to the boy's lips.\nHe turned his head away and began to whimper.\n\n\"Is the medicine very nasty?\" queried de Batz.\n\n\"Mon Dieu! but no, citizen,\" exclaimed the woman, \"it is good strong eau\nde vie, the best that can be procured. Capet likes it really--don't you,\nCapet? It makes you happy and cheerful, and sleep well of nights. Why,\nyou had a glassful yesterday and enjoyed it. Take it now,\" she added in\na quick whisper, seeing that Simon and Heron were in close conversation\ntogether; \"you know it makes papa angry if you don't have at least half\na glass now and then.\"\n\nThe child wavered for a moment longer, making a quaint little grimace of\ndistaste. But at last he seemed to make up his mind that it was wisest\nto yield over so small a matter, and he took the glass from Madame\nSimon.\n\nAnd thus did de Batz see the descendant of St. Louis quaffing a glass of\nraw spirit at the bidding of a rough cobbler's wife, whom he called by\nthe fond and foolish name sacred to childhood, maman!\n\nSelfish egoist though he was, de Batz turned away in loathing.\n\nSimon had watched the little scene with obvious satisfaction. He\nchuckled audibly when the child drank the spirit, and called Heron's\nattention to him, whilst a look of triumph lit up his wide, pale eyes.\n\n\"And now, mon petit,\" he said jovially, \"let the citizen hear you say\nyour prayers!\"\n\nHe winked toward de Batz, evidently anticipating a good deal of\nenjoyment for the visitor from what was coming. From a heap of litter in\na corner of the room he fetched out a greasy red bonnet adorned with a\ntricolour cockade, and a soiled and tattered flag, which had once been\nwhite, and had golden fleur-de-lys embroidered upon it.\n\nThe cap he set on the child's head, and the flag he threw upon the\nfloor.\n\n\"Now, Capet--your prayers!\" he said with another chuckle of amusement.\n\nAll his movements were rough, and his speech almost ostentatiously\ncoarse. He banged against the furniture as he moved about the room,\nkicking a footstool out of the way or knocking over a chair. De\nBatz instinctively thought of the perfumed stillness of the rooms at\nVersailles, of the army of elegant high-born ladies who had ministered\nto the wants of this child, who stood there now before him, a cap on his\nyellow hair, and his shoulder held up to his ear with that gesture\nof careless indifference peculiar to children when they are sullen or\nuncared for.\n\nObediently, quite mechanically it seemed, the boy trod on the flag which\nHenri IV had borne before him at Ivry, and le Roi Soleil had flaunted in\nthe face of the armies of Europe. The son of the Bourbons was spitting\non their flag, and wiping his shoes upon its tattered folds. With shrill\ncracked voice he sang the Carmagnole, \"Ca ira! ca ira! les aristos a la\nlanterne!\" until de Batz himself felt inclined to stop his ears and to\nrush from the place in horror.\n\nLouis XVII, whom the hearts of many had proclaimed King of France by the\ngrace of God, the child of the Bourbons, the eldest son of the Church,\nwas stepping a vulgar dance over the flag of St. Louis, which he had\nbeen taught to defile. His pale cheeks glowed as he danced, his eyes\nshone with the unnatural light kindled in them by the intoxicating\nliquor; with one slender hand he waved the red cap with the tricolour\ncockade, and shouted \"Vive la Republique!\"\n\nMadame Simon was clapping her hands, looking on the child with obvious\npride, and a kind of rough maternal affection. Simon was gazing on\nHeron for approval, and the latter nodded his head, murmuring words of\nencouragement and of praise.\n\n\"Thy catechism now, Capet--thy catechism,\" shouted Simon in a hoarse\nvoice.\n\nThe boy stood at attention, cap on head, hands on his hips, legs wide\napart, and feet firmly planted on the fleur-de-lys, the glory of his\nforefathers.\n\n\"Thy name?\" queried Simon.\n\n\"Louis Capet,\" replied the child in a clear, high-pitched voice.\n\n\"What art thou?\"\n\n\"A citizen of the Republic of France.\"\n\n\"What was thy father?\"\n\n\"Louis Capet, ci-devant king, a tyrant who perished by the will of the\npeople!\"\n\n\"What was thy mother?\"\n\n\"A ----\"\n\nDe Batz involuntarily uttered a cry of horror. Whatever the man's\nprivate character was, he had been born a gentleman, and his every\ninstinct revolted against what he saw and heard. The scene had\npositively sickened him. He turned precipitately towards the door.\n\n\"How now, citizen?\" queried the Committee's agent with a sneer. \"Are you\nnot satisfied with what you see?\"\n\n\"Mayhap the citizen would like to see Capet sitting in a golden chair,\"\ninterposed Simon the cobbler with a sneer, \"and me and my wife kneeling\nand kissing his hand--what?\"\n\n\"'Tis the heat of the room,\" stammered de Batz, who was fumbling with\nthe lock of the door; \"my head began to swim.\"\n\n\"Spit on their accursed flag, then, like a good patriot, like Capet,\"\nretorted Simon gruffly. \"Here, Capet, my son,\" he added, pulling the boy\nby the arm with a rough gesture, \"get thee to bed; thou art quite drunk\nenough to satisfy any good Republican.\"\n\nBy way of a caress he tweaked the boy's ear and gave him a prod in the\nback with his bent knee. He was not wilfully unkind, for just now he\nwas not angry with the lad; rather was he vastly amused with the effect\nCapet's prayer and Capet's recital of his catechism had had on the\nvisitor.\n\nAs to the lad, the intensity of excitement in him was immediately\nfollowed by an overwhelming desire for sleep. Without any preliminary\nof undressing or of washing, he tumbled, just as he was, on to the sofa.\nMadame Simon, with quite pleasing solicitude, arranged a pillow under\nhis head, and the very next moment the child was fast asleep.\n\n\"'Tis well, citoyen Simon,\" said Heron in his turn, going towards\nthe door. \"I'll report favourably on you to the Committee of Public\nSecurity. As for the citoyenne, she had best be more careful,\" he added,\nturning to the woman Simon with a snarl on his evil face. \"There was no\ncause to arrange a pillow under the head of that vermin's spawn. Many\ngood patriots have no pillows to put under their heads. Take that pillow\naway; and I don't like the shoes on the brat's feet; sabots are quite\ngood enough.\"\n\nCitoyenne Simon made no reply. Some sort of retort had apparently\nhovered on her lips, but had been checked, even before it was uttered,\nby a peremptory look from her husband. Simon the cobbler, snarling in\nspeech but obsequious in manner, prepared to accompany the citizen agent\nto the door.\n\nDe Batz was taking a last look at the sleeping child; the uncrowned King\nof France was wrapped in a drunken sleep, with the last spoken insult\nupon his dead mother still hovering on his childish lips.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. ARCADES AMBO\n\n\"That is the way we conduct our affairs, citizen,\" said Heron gruffly,\nas he once more led his guest back into his office.\n\nIt was his turn to be complacent now. De Batz, for once in his life\ncowed by what he had seen, still wore a look of horror and disgust upon\nhis florid face.\n\n\"What devils you all are!\" he said at last.\n\n\"We are good patriots,\" retorted Heron, \"and the tyrant's spawn leads\nbut the life that hundreds of thousands of children led whilst his\nfather oppressed the people. Nay! what am I saying? He leads a far\nbetter, far happier life. He gets plenty to eat and plenty of warm\nclothes. Thousands of innocent children, who have not the crimes of\na despot father upon their conscience, have to starve whilst he grows\nfat.\"\n\nThe leer in his face was so evil that once more de Batz felt that\neerie feeling of terror creeping into his bones. Here were cruelty and\nbloodthirsty ferocity personified to their utmost extent. At thought of\nthe Bourbons, or of all those whom he considered had been in the past\nthe oppressors of the people, Heron was nothing but a wild and ravenous\nbeast, hungering for revenge, longing to bury his talons and his fangs\ninto the body of those whose heels had once pressed on his own neck.\n\nAnd de Batz knew that even with millions or countless money at his\ncommand he could not purchase from this carnivorous brute the life and\nliberty of the son of King Louis. No amount of bribery would accomplish\nthat; it would have to be ingenuity pitted against animal force, the\nwiliness of the fox against the power of the wolf.\n\nEven now Heron was darting savagely suspicious looks upon him.\n\n\"I shall get rid of the Simons,\" he said; \"there's something in that\nwoman's face which I don't trust. They shall go within the next few\nhours, or as soon as I can lay my hands upon a better patriot than that\nmealy-mouthed cobbler. And it will be better not to have a woman about\nthe place. Let me see--to-day is Thursday, or else Friday morning.\nBy Sunday I'll get those Simons out of the place. Methought I saw you\nogling that woman,\" he added, bringing his bony fist crashing down on\nthe table so that papers, pen, and inkhorn rattled loudly; \"and if I\nthought that you--\"\n\nDe Batz thought it well at this point to finger once more nonchalantly\nthe bundle of crisp paper in the pocket of his coat.\n\n\"Only on that one condition,\" reiterated Heron in a hoarse voice; \"if\nyou try to get at Capet, I'll drag you to the Tribunal with my own\nhands.\"\n\n\"Always presuming that you can get me, my friend,\" murmured de Batz, who\nwas gradually regaining his accustomed composure.\n\nAlready his active mind was busily at work. One or two things which\nhe had noted in connection with his visit to the Dauphin's prison had\nstruck him as possibly useful in his schemes. But he was disappointed\nthat Heron was getting rid of the Simons. The woman might have been\nvery useful and more easily got at than a man. The avarice of the French\nbourgeoise would have proved a promising factor. But this, of course,\nwould now be out of the question. At the same time it was not because\nHeron raved and stormed and uttered cries like a hyena that he, de\nBatz, meant to give up an enterprise which, if successful, would place\nmillions into his own pocket.\n\nAs for that meddling Englishman, the Scarlet Pimpernel, and his\ncrack-brained followers, they must be effectually swept out of the way\nfirst of all. De Batz felt that they were the real, the most likely\nhindrance to his schemes. He himself would have to go very cautiously\nto work, since apparently Heron would not allow him to purchase immunity\nfor himself in that one matter, and whilst he was laying his plans with\nnecessary deliberation so as to ensure his own safety, that accursed\nScarlet Pimpernel would mayhap snatch the golden prize from the Temple\nprison right under his very nose.\n\nWhen he thought of that the Gascon Royalist felt just as vindictive as\ndid the chief agent of the Committee of General Security.\n\nWhile these thoughts were coursing through de Batz' head, Heron had been\nindulging in a volley of vituperation.\n\n\"If that little vermin escapes,\" he said, \"my life will not be worth\nan hour's purchase. In twenty-four hours I am a dead man, thrown to the\nguillotine like those dogs of aristocrats! You say I am a night-bird,\ncitizen. I tell you that I do not sleep night or day thinking of that\nbrat and the means to keep him safely under my hand. I have never\ntrusted those Simons--\"\n\n\"Not trusted them!\" exclaimed de Batz; \"surely you could not find\nanywhere more inhuman monsters!\"\n\n\"Inhuman monsters?\" snarled Heron. \"Bah! they don't do their business\nthoroughly; we want the tyrant's spawn to become a true Republican and\na patriot--aye! to make of him such a one that even if you and your\ncursed confederates got him by some hellish chance, he would be no use\nto you as a king, a tyrant to set above the people, to set up in\nyour Versailles, your Louvre, to eat off golden plates and wear satin\nclothes. You have seen the brat! By the time he is a man he should\nforget how to eat save with his fingers, and get roaring drunk every\nnight. That's what we want!--to make him so that he shall be no use to\nyou, even if you did get him away; but you shall not! You shall not, not\nif I have to strangle him with my own hands.\"\n\nHe picked up his short-stemmed pipe and pulled savagely at it for\nawhile. De Batz was meditating.\n\n\"My friend,\" he said after a little while, \"you are agitating yourself\nquite unnecessarily, and gravely jeopardising your prospects of getting\na comfortable little income through keeping your fingers off my person.\nWho said I wanted to meddle with the child?\"\n\n\"You had best not,\" growled Heron.\n\n\"Exactly. You have said that before. But do you not think that you\nwould be far wiser, instead of directing your undivided attention to my\nunworthy self, to turn your thoughts a little to one whom, believe me,\nyou have far greater cause to fear?\"\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"The Englishman.\"\n\n\"You mean the man they call the Scarlet Pimpernel?\"\n\n\"Himself. Have you not suffered from his activity, friend Heron? I fancy\nthat citizen Chauvelin and citizen Collot would have quite a tale to\ntell about him.\"\n\n\"They ought both to have been guillotined for that blunder last autumn\nat Boulogne.\"\n\n\"Take care that the same accusation be not laid at your door this year,\nmy friend,\" commented de Batz placidly.\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"The Scarlet Pimpernel is in Paris even now.\"\n\n\"The devil he is!\"\n\n\"And on what errand, think you?\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence, and then de Batz continued with slow and\ndramatic emphasis:\n\n\"That of rescuing your most precious prisoner from the Temple.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" Heron queried savagely.\n\n\"I guessed.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I saw a man in the Theatre National to-day...\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Who is a member of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\n\"D---- him! Where can I find him?\"\n\n\"Will you sign a receipt for the three thousand five hundred livres,\nwhich I am pining to hand over to you, my friend, and I will tell you?\"\n\n\"Where's the money?\"\n\n\"In my pocket.\"\n\nWithout further words Heron dragged the inkhorn and a sheet of paper\ntowards him, took up a pen, and wrote a few words rapidly in a loose,\nscrawly hand. He strewed sand over the writing, then handed it across\nthe table to de Batz.\n\n\"Will that do?\" he asked briefly.\n\nThe other was reading the note through carefully.\n\n\"I see you only grant me a fortnight,\" he remarked casually.\n\n\"For that amount of money it is sufficient. If you want an extension you\nmust pay more.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" assented de Batz coolly, as he folded the paper across.\n\"On the whole a fortnight's immunity in France these days is quite a\npleasant respite. And I prefer to keep in touch with you, friend Heron.\nI'll call on you again this day fortnight.\"\n\nHe took out a letter-case from his pocket. Out of this he drew a packet\nof bank-notes, which he laid on the table in front of Heron, then he\nplaced the receipt carefully into the letter-case, and this back into\nhis pocket.\n\nHeron in the meanwhile was counting over the banknotes. The light\nof ferocity had entirely gone from his eyes; momentarily the whole\nexpression of the face was one of satisfied greed.\n\n\"Well!\" he said at last when he had assured himself that the number\nof notes was quite correct, and he had transferred the bundle of crisp\npapers into an inner pocket of his coat--\"well, what about your friend?\"\n\n\"I knew him years ago,\" rejoined de Batz coolly; \"he is a kinsman of\ncitizen St. Just. I know that he is one of the confederates of the\nScarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\n\"Where does he lodge?\"\n\n\"That is for you to find out. I saw him at the theatre, and afterwards\nin the green-room; he was making himself agreeable to the citizeness\nLange. I heard him ask for leave to call on her to-morrow at four\no'clock. You know where she lodges, of course!\"\n\nHe watched Heron while the latter scribbled a few words on a scrap of\npaper, then he quietly rose to go. He took up his cloak and once again\nwrapped it round his shoulders. There was nothing more to be said, and\nhe was anxious to go.\n\nThe leave-taking between the two men was neither cordial nor more than\nbarely courteous. De Batz nodded to Heron, who escorted him to the\noutside door of his lodging, and there called loudly to a soldier who\nwas doing sentinel at the further end of the corridor.\n\n\"Show this citizen the way to the guichet,\" he said curtly. \"Good-night,\ncitizen,\" he added finally, nodding to de Batz.\n\nTen minutes later the Gascon once more found himself in the Rue du\nTemple between the great outer walls of the prison and the silent\nlittle church and convent of St. Elizabeth. He looked up to where in the\ncentral tower a small grated window lighted from within showed the\nplace where the last of the Bourbons was being taught to desecrate the\ntraditions of his race, at the bidding of a mender of shoes--a naval\nofficer cashiered for misconduct and fraud.\n\nSuch is human nature in its self-satisfied complacency that de Batz,\ncalmly ignoring the vile part which he himself had played in the last\nquarter of an hour of his interview with the Committee's agent, found\nit in him to think of Heron with loathing, and even of the cobbler Simon\nwith disgust.\n\nThen with a self-righteous sense of duty performed, and an indifferent\nshrug of the shoulders, he dismissed Heron from his mind.\n\n\"That meddlesome Scarlet Pimpernel will find his hands over-full\nto-morrow, and mayhap will not interfere in my affairs for some time to\ncome,\" he mused; \"meseems that that will be the first time that a member\nof his precious League has come within the clutches of such unpleasant\npeople as the sleuth-hounds of my friend Heron!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. WHAT LOVE CAN DO\n\n\"Yesterday you were unkind and ungallant. How could I smile when you\nseemed so stern?\"\n\n\"Yesterday I was not alone with you. How could I say what lay next my\nheart, when indifferent ears could catch the words that were meant only\nfor you?\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur, do they teach you in England how to make pretty\nspeeches?\"\n\n\"No, mademoiselle, that is an instinct that comes into birth by the fire\nof a woman's eyes.\"\n\nMademoiselle Lange was sitting upon a small sofa of antique design, with\ncushions covered in faded silks heaped round her pretty head. Armand\nthought that she looked like that carved cameo which his sister\nMarguerite possessed.\n\nHe himself sat on a low chair at some distance from her. He had brought\nher a large bunch of early violets, for he knew that she was fond of\nflowers, and these lay upon her lap, against the opalescent grey of her\ngown.\n\nShe seemed a little nervous and agitated, his obvious admiration\nbringing a ready blush to her cheeks.\n\nThe room itself appeared to Armand to be a perfect frame for the\ncharming picture which she presented. The furniture in it was small and\nold; tiny tables of antique Vernis-Martin, softly faded tapestries, a\npale-toned Aubusson carpet. Everything mellow and in a measure pathetic.\nMademoiselle Lange, who was an orphan, lived alone under the duennaship\nof a middle-aged relative, a penniless hanger-on of the successful young\nactress, who acted as her chaperone, housekeeper, and maid, and kept\nunseemly or over-bold gallants at bay.\n\nShe told Armand all about her early life, her childhood in the backshop\nof Maitre Meziere, the jeweller, who was a relative of her mother's; of\nher desire for an artistic career, her struggles with the middle-class\nprejudices of her relations, her bold defiance of them, and final\nindependence.\n\nShe made no secret of her humble origin, her want of education in those\ndays; on the contrary, she was proud of what she had accomplished for\nherself. She was only twenty years of age, and already held a leading\nplace in the artistic world of Paris.\n\nArmand listened to her chatter, interested in everything she said,\nquestioning her with sympathy and discretion. She asked him a good\ndeal about himself, and about his beautiful sister Marguerite, who,\nof course, had been the most brilliant star in that most brilliant\nconstellation, the Comedie Francaise. She had never seen Marguerite St.\nJust act, but, of course, Paris still rang with her praises, and all\nart-lovers regretted that she should have married and left them to mourn\nfor her.\n\nThus the conversation drifted naturally back to England. Mademoiselle\nprofessed a vast interest in the citizen's country of adoption.\n\n\"I had always,\" she said, \"thought it an ugly country, with the noise\nand bustle of industrial life going on everywhere, and smoke and fog to\ncover the landscape and to stunt the trees.\"\n\n\"Then, in future, mademoiselle,\" he replied, \"must you think of it as\none carpeted with verdure, where in the spring the orchard trees covered\nwith delicate blossom would speak to you of fairyland, where the dewy\ngrass stretches its velvety surface in the shadow of ancient monumental\noaks, and ivy-covered towers rear their stately crowns to the sky.\"\n\n\"And the Scarlet Pimpernel? Tell me about him, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Ah, mademoiselle, what can I tell you that you do not already know? The\nScarlet Pimpernel is a man who has devoted his entire existence to the\nbenefit of suffering mankind. He has but one thought, and that is for\nthose who need him; he hears but one sound the cry of the oppressed.\"\n\n\"But they do say, monsieur, that philanthropy plays but a sorry part in\nyour hero's schemes. They aver that he looks on his own efforts and the\nadventures through which he goes only in the light of sport.\"\n\n\"Like all Englishmen, mademoiselle, the Scarlet Pimpernel is a little\nashamed of sentiment. He would deny its very existence with his lips,\neven whilst his noble heart brimmed over with it. Sport? Well! mayhap\nthe sporting instinct is as keen as that of charity--the race for lives,\nthe tussle for the rescue of human creatures, the throwing of a life on\nthe hazard of a die.\"\n\n\"They fear him in France, monsieur. He has saved so many whose death had\nbeen decreed by the Committee of Public Safety.\"\n\n\"Please God, he will save many yet.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur, the poor little boy in the Temple prison!\"\n\n\"He has your sympathy, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Of every right-minded woman in France, monsieur. Oh!\" she added with a\npretty gesture of enthusiasm, clasping her hands together, and looking\nat Armand with large eyes filled with tears, \"if your noble Scarlet\nPimpernel will do aught to save that poor innocent lamb, I would indeed\nbless him in my heart, and help him with all my humble might if I\ncould.\"\n\n\"May God's saints bless you for those words, mademoiselle,\" he said,\nwhilst, carried away by her beauty, her charm, her perfect femininity,\nhe stooped towards her until his knee touched the carpet at her feet. \"I\nhad begun to lose my belief in my poor misguided country, to think all\nmen in France vile, and all women base. I could thank you on my\nknees for your sweet words of sympathy, for the expression of tender\nmotherliness that came into your eyes when you spoke of the poor\nforsaken Dauphin in the Temple.\"\n\nShe did not restrain her tears; with her they came very easily, just as\nwith a child, and as they gathered in her eyes and rolled down her fresh\ncheeks they in no way marred the charm of her face. One hand lay in her\nlap fingering a diminutive bit of cambric, which from time to time she\npressed to her eyes. The other she had almost unconsciously yielded to\nArmand.\n\nThe scent of the violets filled the room. It seemed to emanate from her,\na fitting attribute of her young, wholly unsophisticated girlhood. The\ncitizen was goodly to look at; he was kneeling at her feet, and his lips\nwere pressed against her hand.\n\nArmand was young and he was an idealist. I do not for a moment imagine\nthat just at this moment he was deeply in love. The stronger feeling had\nnot yet risen up in him; it came later when tragedy encompassed him\nand brought passion to sudden maturity. Just now he was merely yielding\nhimself up to the intoxicating moment, with all the abandonment, all the\nenthusiasm of the Latin race. There was no reason why he should not bend\nthe knee before this exquisite little cameo, that by its very presence\nwas giving him an hour of perfect pleasure and of aesthetic joy.\n\nOutside the world continued its hideous, relentless way; men butchered\none another, fought and hated. Here in this small old-world salon, with\nits faded satins and bits of ivory-tinted lace, the outer universe had\nnever really penetrated. It was a tiny world--quite apart from the rest\nof mankind, perfectly peaceful and absolutely beautiful.\n\nIf Armand had been allowed to depart from here now, without having been\nthe cause as well as the chief actor in the events that followed, no\ndoubt that Mademoiselle Lange would always have remained a charming\nmemory with him, an exquisite bouquet of violets pressed reverently\nbetween the leaves of a favourite book of poems, and the scent of spring\nflowers would in after years have ever brought her dainty picture to his\nmind.\n\nHe was murmuring pretty words of endearment; carried away by emotion,\nhis arm stole round her waist; he felt that if another tear came like a\ndewdrop rolling down her cheek he must kiss it away at its very source.\nPassion was not sweeping them off their feet--not yet, for they\nwere very young, and life had not as yet presented to them its most\nunsolvable problem.\n\nBut they yielded to one another, to the springtime of their life,\ncalling for Love, which would come presently hand in hand with his grim\nattendant, Sorrow.\n\nEven as Armand's glowing face was at last lifted up to hers asking with\nmute lips for that first kiss which she already was prepared to give,\nthere came the loud noise of men's heavy footsteps tramping up the\nold oak stairs, then some shouting, a woman's cry, and the next moment\nMadame Belhomme, trembling, wide-eyed, and in obvious terror, came\nrushing into the room.\n\n\"Jeanne! Jeanne! My child! It is awful! It is awful! Mon Dieu--mon Dieu!\nWhat is to become of us?\"\n\nShe was moaning and lamenting even as she ran in, and now she threw her\napron over her face and sank into a chair, continuing her moaning and\nher lamentations.\n\nNeither Mademoiselle nor Armand had stirred. They remained like graven\nimages, he on one knee, she with large eyes fixed upon his face. They\nhad neither of them looked on the old woman; they seemed even now\nunconscious of her presence. But their ears had caught the sound of that\nmeasured tramp of feet up the stairs of the old house, and the halt upon\nthe landing; they had heard the brief words of command:\n\n\"Open, in the name of the people!\"\n\nThey knew quite well what it all meant; they had not wandered so far in\nthe realms of romance that reality--the grim, horrible reality of the\nmoment--had not the power to bring them back to earth.\n\nThat peremptory call to open in the name of the people was the prologue\nthese days to a drama which had but two concluding acts: arrest, which\nwas a certainty; the guillotine, which was more than probable. Jeanne\nand Armand, these two young people who but a moment ago had tentatively\nlifted the veil of life, looked straight into each other's eyes and saw\nthe hand of death interposed between them: they looked straight into\neach other's eyes and knew that nothing but the hand of death would part\nthem now. Love had come with its attendant, Sorrow; but he had come with\nno uncertain footsteps. Jeanne looked on the man before her, and he bent\nhis head to imprint a glowing kiss upon her hand.\n\n\"Aunt Marie!\"\n\nIt was Jeanne Lange who spoke, but her voice was no longer that of an\nirresponsible child; it was firm, steady and hard. Though she spoke to\nthe old woman, she did not look at her; her luminous brown eyes rested\non the bowed head of Armand St. Just.\n\n\"Aunt Marie!\" she repeated more peremptorily, for the old woman, with\nher apron over her head, was still moaning, and unconscious of all save\nan overmastering fear.\n\n\"Open, in the name of the people!\" came in a loud harsh voice once more\nfrom the other side of the front door.\n\n\"Aunt Marie, as you value your life and mine, pull yourself together,\"\nsaid Jeanne firmly.\n\n\"What shall we do? Oh! what shall we do?\" moaned Madame Belhomme. But\nshe had dragged the apron away from her face, and was looking with some\npuzzlement at meek, gentle little Jeanne, who had suddenly become so\nstrange, so dictatorial, all unlike her habitual somewhat diffident\nself.\n\n\"You need not have the slightest fear, Aunt Marie, if you will only do\nas I tell you,\" resumed Jeanne quietly; \"if you give way to fear, we\nare all of us undone. As you value your life and mine,\" she now repeated\nauthoritatively, \"pull yourself together, and do as I tell you.\"\n\nThe girl's firmness, her perfect quietude had the desired effect. Madame\nBelhomme, though still shaken up with sobs of terror, made a great\neffort to master herself; she stood up, smoothed down her apron, passed\nher hand over her ruffled hair, and said in a quaking voice:\n\n\"What do you think we had better do?\"\n\n\"Go quietly to the door and open it.\"\n\n\"But--the soldiers--\"\n\n\"If you do not open quietly they will force the door open within the\nnext two minutes,\" interposed Jeanne calmly. \"Go quietly and open the\ndoor. Try and hide your fears, grumble in an audible voice at being\ninterrupted in your cooking, and tell the soldiers at once that they\nwill find mademoiselle in the boudoir. Go, for God's sake!\" she added,\nwhilst suppressed emotion suddenly made her young voice vibrate; \"go,\nbefore they break open that door!\"\n\nMadame Belhomme, impressed and cowed, obeyed like an automaton. She\nturned and marched fairly straight out of the room. It was not a minute\ntoo soon. From outside had already come the third and final summons:\n\n\"Open, in the name of the people!\"\n\nAfter that a crowbar would break open the door.\n\nMadame Belhomme's heavy footsteps were heard crossing the ante-chamber.\nArmand still knelt at Jeanne's feet, holding her trembling little hand\nin his.\n\n\"A love-scene,\" she whispered rapidly, \"a love-scene--quick--do you know\none?\"\n\nAnd even as he had tried to rise she held him back, down on his knees.\n\nHe thought that fear was making her distracted.\n\n\"Mademoiselle--\" he murmured, trying to soothe her.\n\n\"Try and understand,\" she said with wonderful calm, \"and do as I tell\nyou. Aunt Marie has obeyed. Will you do likewise?\"\n\n\"To the death!\" he whispered eagerly.\n\n\"Then a love-scene,\" she entreated. \"Surely you know one. Rodrigue and\nChimene! Surely--surely,\" she urged, even as tears of anguish rose into\nher eyes, \"you must--you must, or, if not that, something else. Quick!\nThe very seconds are precious!\"\n\nThey were indeed! Madame Belhomme, obedient as a frightened dog, had\ngone to the door and opened it; even her well-feigned grumblings could\nnow be heard and the rough interrogations from the soldiery.\n\n\"Citizeness Lange!\" said a gruff voice.\n\n\"In her boudoir, quoi!\"\n\nMadame Belhomme, braced up apparently by fear, was playing her part\nremarkably well.\n\n\"Bothering good citizens! On baking day, too!\" she went on grumbling and\nmuttering.\n\n\"Oh, think--think!\" murmured Jeanne now in an agonised whisper, her hot\nlittle hand grasping his so tightly that her nails were driven into his\nflesh. \"You must know something, that will do--anything--for dear life's\nsake.... Armand!\"\n\nHis name--in the tense excitement of this terrible moment--had escaped\nher lips.\n\nAll in a flash of sudden intuition he understood what she wanted, and\neven as the door of the boudoir was thrown violently open Armand--still\non his knees, but with one hand pressed to his heart, the other\nstretched upwards to the ceiling in the most approved dramatic style,\nwas loudly declaiming:\n\n     \"Pour venger son honneur il perdit son amour,\n      Pour venger sa maitresse il a quitte le jour!\"\n\nWhereupon Mademoiselle Lange feigned the most perfect impatience.\n\n\"No, no, my good cousin,\" she said with a pretty moue of disdain, \"that\nwill never do! You must not thus emphasise the end of every line; the\nverses should flow more evenly, as thus....\"\n\nHeron had paused at the door. It was he who had thrown it open--he who,\nfollowed by a couple of his sleuth-hounds, had thought to find here\nthe man denounced by de Batz as being one of the followers of that\nirrepressible Scarlet Pimpernel. The obviously Parisian intonation of\nthe man kneeling in front of citizeness Lange in an attitude no ways\nsuggestive of personal admiration, and coolly reciting verses out of a\nplay, had somewhat taken him aback.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" he asked gruffly, striding forward into the room\nand glaring first at mademoiselle, then at Armand.\n\nMademoiselle gave a little cry of surprise.\n\n\"Why, if it isn't citizen Heron!\" she cried, jumping up with a dainty\nmovement of coquetry and embarrassment. \"Why did not Aunt Marie announce\nyou?... It is indeed remiss of her, but she is so ill-tempered on baking\ndays I dare not even rebuke her. Won't you sit down, citizen Heron?\nAnd you, cousin,\" she added, looking down airily on Armand, \"I pray you\nmaintain no longer that foolish attitude.\"\n\nThe febrileness of her manner, the glow in her cheeks were easily\nattributable to natural shyness in face of this unexpected visit. Heron,\ncompletely bewildered by this little scene, which was so unlike what he\nexpected, and so unlike those to which he was accustomed in the exercise\nof his horrible duties, was practically speechless before the little\nlady who continued to prattle along in a simple, unaffected manner.\n\n\"Cousin,\" she said to Armand, who in the meanwhile had risen to his\nknees, \"this is citizen Heron, of whom you have heard me speak. My\ncousin Belhomme,\" she continued, once more turning to Heron, \"is fresh\nfrom the country, citizen. He hails from Orleans, where he has played\nleading parts in the tragedies of the late citizen Corneille. But, ah\nme! I fear that he will find Paris audiences vastly more critical\nthan the good Orleanese. Did you hear him, citizen, declaiming those\nbeautiful verses just now? He was murdering them, say I--yes, murdering\nthem--the gaby!\"\n\nThen only did it seem as if she realised that there was something amiss,\nthat citizen Heron had come to visit her, not as an admirer of her\ntalent who would wish to pay his respects to a successful actress, but\nas a person to be looked on with dread.\n\nShe gave a quaint, nervous little laugh, and murmured in the tones of a\nfrightened child:\n\n\"La, citizen, how glum you look! I thought you had come to compliment\nme on my latest success. I saw you at the theatre last night, though\nyou did not afterwards come to see me in the green-room. Why! I had a\nregular ovation! Look at my flowers!\" she added more gaily, pointing to\nseveral bouquets in vases about the room. \"Citizen Danton brought me\nthe violets himself, and citizen Santerre the narcissi, and that laurel\nwreath--is it not charming?--that was a tribute from citizen Robespierre\nhimself.\"\n\nShe was so artless, so simple, and so natural that Heron was completely\ntaken off his usual mental balance. He had expected to find the usual\nsetting to the dramatic episodes which he was wont to conduct--screaming\nwomen, a man either at bay, sword in hand, or hiding in a linen cupboard\nor up a chimney.\n\nNow everything puzzled him. De Batz--he was quite sure--had spoken of an\nEnglishman, a follower of the Scarlet Pimpernel; every thinking French\npatriot knew that all the followers of the Scarlet Pimpernel were\nEnglishmen with red hair and prominent teeth, whereas this man....\n\nArmand--who deadly danger had primed in his improvised role--was\nstriding up and down the room declaiming with ever-varying intonations:\n\n     \"Joignez tous vos efforts contre un espoir si doux\n      Pour en venir a bout, c'est trop peu que de vous.\"\n\n\"No! no!\" said mademoiselle impatiently; \"you must not make that ugly\npause midway in the last line: 'pour en venir a bout, c'est trop peu que\nde vous!'\"\n\nShe mimicked Armand's diction so quaintly, imitating his stride, his\nawkward gesture, and his faulty phraseology with such funny exaggeration\nthat Heron laughed in spite of himself.\n\n\"So that is a cousin from Orleans, is it?\" he asked, throwing his lanky\nbody into an armchair, which creaked dismally under his weight.\n\n\"Yes! a regular gaby--what?\" she said archly. \"Now, citizen Heron, you\nmust stay and take coffee with me. Aunt Marie will be bringing it in\ndirectly. Hector,\" she added, turning to Armand, \"come down from the\nclouds and ask Aunt Marie to be quick.\"\n\nThis certainly was the first time in the whole of his experience that\nHeron had been asked to stay and drink coffee with the quarry he was\nhunting down. Mademoiselle's innocent little ways, her desire for\nthe prolongation of his visit, further addled his brain. De Batz had\nundoubtedly spoken of an Englishman, and the cousin from Orleans was\ncertainly a Frenchman every inch of him.\n\nPerhaps had the denunciation come from any one else but de Batz, Heron\nmight have acted and thought more circumspectly; but, of course, the\nchief agent of the Committee of General Security was more suspicious of\nthe man from whom he took a heavy bribe than of any one else in France.\nThe thought had suddenly crossed his mind that mayhap de Batz had sent\nhim on a fool's errand in order to get him safely out of the way of the\nTemple prison at a given hour of the day.\n\nThe thought took shape, crystallised, caused him to see a rapid vision\nof de Batz sneaking into his lodgings and stealing his keys, the guard\nbeing slack, careless, inattentive, allowing the adventurer to pass\nbarriers that should have been closed against all comers.\n\nNow Heron was sure of it; it was all a conspiracy invented by de Batz.\nHe had forgotten all about his theories that a man under arrest is\nalways safer than a man that is free. Had his brain been quite normal,\nand not obsessed, as it always was now by thoughts of the Dauphin's\nescape from prison, no doubt he would have been more suspicious of\nArmand, but all his worst suspicions were directed against de Batz.\nArmand seemed to him just a fool, an actor quoi? and so obviously not an\nEnglishman.\n\nHe jumped to his feet, curtly declining mademoiselle's offers of\nhospitality. He wanted to get away at once. Actors and actresses were\nalways, by tacit consent of the authorities, more immune than the rest\nof the community. They provided the only amusement in the intervals\nof the horrible scenes around the scaffolds; they were irresponsible,\nharmless creatures who did not meddle in politics.\n\nJeanne the while was gaily prattling on, her luminous eyes fixed upon\nthe all-powerful enemy, striving to read his thoughts, to understand\nwhat went on behind those cruel, prominent eyes, the chances that Armand\nhad of safety and of life.\n\nShe knew, of course, that the visit was directed against Armand--some\none had betrayed him, that odious de Batz mayhap--and she was fighting\nfor Armand's safety, for his life. Her armoury consisted of her presence\nof mind, her cool courage, her self-control; she used all these weapons\nfor his sake, though at times she felt as if the strain on her nerves\nwould snap the thread of life in her. The effort seemed more than she\ncould bear.\n\nBut she kept up her part, rallying Heron for the shortness of his\nvisit, begging him to tarry for another five minutes at least, throwing\nout--with subtle feminine intuition--just those very hints anent little\nCapet's safety that were most calculated to send him flying back towards\nthe Temple.\n\n\"I felt so honoured last night, citizen,\" she said coquettishly, \"that\nyou even forgot little Capet in order to come and watch my debut as\nCelimene.\"\n\n\"Forget him!\" retorted Heron, smothering a curse, \"I never forget the\nvermin. I must go back to him; there are too many cats nosing round my\nmouse. Good day to you, citizeness. I ought to have brought flowers, I\nknow; but I am a busy man--a harassed man.\"\n\n\"Je te crois,\" she said with a grave nod of the head; \"but do come to\nthe theatre to-night. I am playing Camille--such a fine part! one of my\ngreatest successes.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I'll come--mayhap, mayhap--but I'll go now--glad to have seen\nyou, citizeness. Where does your cousin lodge?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"Here,\" she replied boldly, on the spur of the moment.\n\n\"Good. Let him report himself to-morrow morning at the Conciergerie, and\nget his certificate of safety. It is a new decree, and you should have\none, too.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. Hector and I will come together, and perhaps Aunt\nMarie will come too. Don't send us to maman guillotine yet awhile,\ncitizen,\" she said lightly; \"you will never get such another Camille,\nnor yet so good a Celimene.\"\n\nShe was gay, artless to the last. She accompanied Heron to the door\nherself, chaffing him about his escort.\n\n\"You are an aristo, citizen,\" she said, gazing with well-feigned\nadmiration on the two sleuth-hounds who stood in wait in the anteroom;\n\"it makes me proud to see so many citizens at my door. Come and see me\nplay Camille--come to-night, and don't forget the green-room door--it\nwill always be kept invitingly open for you.\"\n\nShe bobbed him a curtsey, and he walked out, closely followed by his two\nmen; then at last she closed the door behind them. She stood there for\na while, her ear glued against the massive panels, listening for their\nmeasured tread down the oak staircase. At last it rang more sharply\nagainst the flagstones of the courtyard below; then she was satisfied\nthat they had gone, and went slowly back to the boudoir.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. SHADOWS\n\nThe tension on her nerves relaxed; there was the inevitable reaction.\nHer knees were shaking under her, and she literally staggered into the\nroom.\n\nBut Armand was already near her, down on both his knees this time, his\narms clasping the delicate form that swayed like the slender stems of\nnarcissi in the breeze.\n\n\"Oh! you must go out of Paris at once--at once,\" she said through sobs\nwhich no longer would be kept back.\n\n\"He'll return--I know that he will return--and you will not be safe\nuntil you are back in England.\"\n\nBut he could not think of himself or of anything in the future. He had\nforgotten Heron, Paris, the world; he could only think of her.\n\n\"I owe my life to you!\" he murmured. \"Oh, how beautiful you are--how\nbrave! How I love you!\"\n\nIt seemed that he had always loved her, from the moment that first\nin his boyish heart he had set up an ideal to worship, and then, last\nnight, in the box of the theatre--he had his back turned toward the\nstage, and was ready to go--her voice had called him back; it had held\nhim spellbound; her voice, and also her eyes.... He did not know then\nthat it was Love which then and there had enchained him. Oh, how foolish\nhe had been! for now he knew that he had loved her with all his might,\nwith all his soul, from the very instant that his eyes had rested upon\nher.\n\nHe babbled along--incoherently--in the intervals of covering her hands\nand the hem of her gown with kisses. He stooped right down to the ground\nand kissed the arch of her instep; he had become a devotee worshipping\nat the shrine of his saint, who had performed a great and a wonderful\nmiracle.\n\nArmand the idealist had found his ideal in a woman. That was the great\nmiracle which the woman herself had performed for him. He found in her\nall that he had admired most, all that he had admired in the leader\nwho hitherto had been the only personification of his ideal. But Jeanne\npossessed all those qualities which had roused his enthusiasm in the\nnoble hero whom he revered. Her pluck, her ingenuity, her calm devotion\nwhich had averted the threatened danger from him!\n\nWhat had he done that she should have risked her own sweet life for his\nsake?\n\nBut Jeanne did not know. She could not tell. Her nerves now were\nsomewhat unstrung, and the tears that always came so readily to her eyes\nflowed quite unchecked. She could not very well move, for he held her\nknees imprisoned in his arms, but she was quite content to remain like\nthis, and to yield her hands to him so that he might cover them with\nkisses.\n\nIndeed, she did not know at what precise moment love for him had been\nborn in her heart. Last night, perhaps... she could not say ... but when\nthey parted she felt that she must see him again... and then today...\nperhaps it was the scent of the violets... they were so exquisitely\nsweet... perhaps it was his enthusiasm and his talk about England... but\nwhen Heron came she knew that she must save Armand's life at all cost...\nthat she would die if they dragged him away to prison.\n\nThus these two children philosophised, trying to understand the mystery\nof the birth of Love. But they were only children; they did not really\nunderstand. Passion was sweeping them off their feet, because a common\ndanger had bound them irrevocably to one another. The womanly instinct\nto save and to protect had given the young girl strength to bear a\ndifficult part, and now she loved him for the dangers from which she had\nrescued him, and he loved her because she had risked her life for him.\n\nThe hours sped on; there was so much to say, so much that was exquisite\nto listen to. The shades of evening were gathering fast; the room, with\nits pale-toned hangings and faded tapestries, was sinking into the\narms of gloom. Aunt Marie was no doubt too terrified to stir out of her\nkitchen; she did not bring the lamps, but the darkness suited Armand's\nmood, and Jeanne was glad that the gloaming effectually hid the\nperpetual blush in her cheeks.\n\nIn the evening air the dying flowers sent their heady fragrance around.\nArmand was intoxicated with the perfume of violets that clung to\nJeanne's fingers, with the touch of her satin gown that brushed his\ncheek, with the murmur of her voice that quivered through her tears.\n\nNo noise from the ugly outer world reached this secluded spot. In the\ntiny square outside a street lamp had been lighted, and its feeble rays\ncame peeping in through the lace curtains at the window. They caught the\ndainty silhouette of the young girl, playing with the loose tendrils of\nher hair around her forehead, and outlining with a thin band of light\nthe contour of neck and shoulder, making the satin of her gown shimmer\nwith an opalescent glow.\n\nArmand rose from his knees. Her eyes were calling to him, her lips were\nready to yield.\n\n\"Tu m'aimes?\" he whispered.\n\nAnd like a tired child she sank upon his breast.\n\nHe kissed her hair, her eyes, her lips; her skin was fragrant as the\nflowers of spring, the tears on her cheeks glistened like morning dew.\n\n\n\nAunt Marie came in at last, carrying the lamp. She found them sitting\nside by side, like two children, hand in hand, mute with the eloquence\nwhich comes from boundless love. They were under a spell, forgetting\neven that they lived, knowing nothing except that they loved.\n\nThe lamp broke the spell, and Aunt Marie's still trembling voice:\n\n\"Oh, my dear! how did you manage to rid yourself of those brutes?\"\n\nBut she asked no other question, even when the lamp showed up quite\nclearly the glowing cheeks of Jeanne and the ardent eyes of Armand. In\nher heart, long since atrophied, there were a few memories, carefully\nput away in a secret cell, and those memories caused the old woman to\nunderstand.\n\nNeither Jeanne nor Armand noticed what she did; the spell had been\nbroken, but the dream lingered on; they did not see Aunt Marie putting\nthe room tidy, and then quietly tiptoeing out by the door.\n\nBut through the dream, reality was struggling for recognition. After\nArmand had asked for the hundredth time: \"Tu m'aimes?\" and Jeanne for\nthe hundredth time had replied mutely with her eyes, her fears for him\nsuddenly returned.\n\nSomething had awakened her from her trance--a heavy footstep, mayhap, in\nthe street below, the distant roll of a drum, or only the clash of steel\nsaucepans in Aunt Marie's kitchen. But suddenly Jeanne was alert, and\nwith her alertness came terror for the beloved.\n\n\"Your life,\" she said--for he had called her his life just then, \"your\nlife--and I was forgetting that it is still in danger... your dear, your\nprecious life!\"\n\n\"Doubly dear now,\" he replied, \"since I owe it to you.\"\n\n\"Then I pray you, I entreat you, guard it well for my sake--make all\nhaste to leave Paris... oh, this I beg of you!\" she continued more\nearnestly, seeing the look of demur in his eyes; \"every hour you spend\nin it brings danger nearer to your door.\"\n\n\"I could not leave Paris while you are here.\"\n\n\"But I am safe here,\" she urged; \"quite, quite safe, I assure you. I am\nonly a poor actress, and the Government takes no heed of us mimes.\nMen must be amused, even between the intervals of killing one another.\nIndeed, indeed, I should be far safer here now, waiting quietly for\nawhile, while you make preparations to go... My hasty departure at this\nmoment would bring disaster on us both.\"\n\nThere was logic in what she said. And yet how could he leave her? now\nthat he had found this perfect woman--this realisation of his highest\nideals, how could he go and leave her in this awful Paris, with brutes\nlike Heron forcing their hideous personality into her sacred presence,\nthreatening that very life he would gladly give his own to keep\ninviolate?\n\n\"Listen, sweetheart,\" he said after awhile, when presently reason\nstruggled back for first place in his mind. \"Will you allow me to\nconsult with my chief, with the Scarlet Pimpernel, who is in Paris at\nthe present moment? I am under his orders; I could not leave France just\nnow. My life, my entire person are at his disposal. I and my comrades\nare here under his orders, for a great undertaking which he has not yet\nunfolded to us, but which I firmly believe is framed for the rescue of\nthe Dauphin from the Temple.\"\n\nShe gave an involuntary exclamation of horror.\n\n\"No, no!\" she said quickly and earnestly; \"as far as you are concerned,\nArmand, that has now become an impossibility. Some one has betrayed you,\nand you are henceforth a marked man. I think that odious de Batz had a\nhand in Heron's visit of this afternoon. We succeeded in putting these\nspies off the scent, but only for a moment... within a few hours--less\nperhaps--Heron will repent him of his carelessness; he'll come back--I\nknow that he will come back. He may leave me, personally, alone; but\nhe will be on your track; he'll drag you to the Conciergerie to report\nyourself, and there your true name and history are bound to come to\nlight. If you succeed in evading him, he will still be on your track. If\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel keeps you in Paris now, your death will be at his\ndoor.\"\n\nHer voice had become quite hard and trenchant as she said these last\nwords; womanlike, she was already prepared to hate the man whose\nmysterious personality she had hitherto admired, now that the life and\nsafety of Armand appeared to depend on the will of that elusive hero.\n\n\"You must not be afraid for me, Jeanne,\" he urged. \"The Scarlet\nPimpernel cares for all his followers; he would never allow me to run\nunnecessary risks.\"\n\nShe was unconvinced, almost jealous now of his enthusiasm for that\nunknown man. Already she had taken full possession of Armand; she had\npurchased his life, and he had given her his love. She would share\nneither treasure with that nameless leader who held Armand's allegiance.\n\n\"It is only for a little while, sweetheart,\" he reiterated again and\nagain. \"I could not, anyhow, leave Paris whilst I feel that you are\nhere, maybe in danger. The thought would be horrible. I should go mad if\nI had to leave you.\"\n\nThen he talked again of England, of his life there, of the happiness and\npeace that were in store for them both.\n\n\"We will go to England together,\" he whispered, \"and there we will be\nhappy together, you and I. We will have a tiny house among the Kentish\nhills, and its walls will be covered with honeysuckle and roses. At\nthe back of the house there will be an orchard, and in May, when the\nfruit-blossom is fading and soft spring breezes blow among the trees,\nshowers of sweet-scented petals will envelop us as we walk along,\nfalling on us like fragrant snow. You will come, sweetheart, will you\nnot?\"\n\n\"If you still wish it, Armand,\" she murmured.\n\nStill wish it! He would gladly go to-morrow if she would come with him.\nBut, of course, that could not be arranged. She had her contract to\nfulfil at the theatre, then there would be her house and furniture to\ndispose of, and there was Aunt Marie.... But, of course, Aunt Marie\nwould come too.... She thought that she could get away some time before\nthe spring; and he swore that he could not leave Paris until she came\nwith him.\n\nIt seemed a terrible deadlock, for she could not bear to think of him\nalone in those awful Paris streets, where she knew that spies would\nalways be tracking him. She had no illusions as to the impression which\nshe had made on Heron; she knew that it could only be a momentary one,\nand that Armand would henceforth be in daily, hourly danger.\n\nAt last she promised him that she would take the advice of his chief;\nthey would both be guided by what he said. Armand would confide in\nhim to-night, and if it could be arranged she would hurry on her\npreparations and, mayhap, be ready to join him in a week.\n\n\"In the meanwhile, that cruel man must not risk your dear life,\" she\nsaid. \"Remember, Armand, your life belongs to me. Oh, I could hate him\nfor the love you bear him!\"\n\n\"Sh--sh--sh!\" he said earnestly. \"Dear heart, you must not speak like\nthat of the man whom, next to your perfect self, I love most upon\nearth.\"\n\n\"You think of him more than of me. I shall scarce live until I know that\nyou are safely out of Paris.\"\n\nThough it was horrible to part, yet it was best, perhaps, that he should\ngo back to his lodgings now, in case Heron sent his spies back to her\ndoor, and since he meant to consult with his chief. She had a vague hope\nthat if the mysterious hero was indeed the noble-hearted man whom Armand\nrepresented him to be, surely he would take compassion on the anxiety of\na sorrowing woman, and release the man she loved from bondage.\n\nThis thought pleased her and gave her hope. She even urged Armand now to\ngo.\n\n\"When may I see you to-morrow?\" he asked.\n\n\"But it will be so dangerous to meet,\" she argued.\n\n\"I must see you. I could not live through the day without seeing you.\"\n\n\"The theatre is the safest place.\"\n\n\"I could not wait till the evening. May I not come here?\"\n\n\"No, no. Heron's spies may be about.\"\n\n\"Where then?\"\n\nShe thought it over for a moment.\n\n\"At the stage-door of the theatre at one o'clock,\" she said at last. \"We\nshall have finished rehearsal. Slip into the guichet of the concierge.\nI will tell him to admit you, and send my dresser to meet you there; she\nwill bring you along to my room, where we shall be undisturbed for at\nleast half an hour.\"\n\nHe had perforce to be content with that, though he would so much rather\nhave seen her here again, where the faded tapestries and soft-toned\nhangings made such a perfect background for her delicate charm. He had\nevery intention of confiding in Blakeney, and of asking his help for\ngetting Jeanne out of Paris as quickly as may be.\n\nThus this perfect hour was past; the most pure, the fullest of joy that\nthese two young people were ever destined to know. Perhaps they felt\nwithin themselves the consciousness that their great love would rise\nanon to yet greater, fuller perfection when Fate had crowned it with\nhis halo of sorrow. Perhaps, too, it was that consciousness that gave to\ntheir kisses now the solemnity of a last farewell.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. THE LEAGUE OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL\n\nArmand never could say definitely afterwards whither he went when he\nleft the Square du Roule that evening. No doubt he wandered about the\nstreets for some time in an absent, mechanical way, paying no heed to\nthe passers-by, none to the direction in which he was going.\n\nHis mind was full of Jeanne, her beauty, her courage, her attitude in\nface of the hideous bloodhound who had come to pollute that charming\nold-world boudoir by his loathsome presence. He recalled every word she\nuttered, every gesture she made.\n\nHe was a man in love for the first time--wholly, irremediably in love.\n\nI suppose that it was the pangs of hunger that first recalled him\nto himself. It was close on eight o'clock now, and he had fed on his\nimaginings--first on anticipation, then on realisation, and lastly on\nmemory--during the best part of the day. Now he awoke from his day-dream\nto find himself tired and hungry, but fortunately not very far from that\nquarter of Paris where food is easily obtainable.\n\nHe was somewhere near the Madeleine--a quarter he knew well. Soon he\nsaw in front of him a small eating-house which looked fairly clean and\norderly. He pushed open its swing-door, and seeing an empty table in a\nsecluded part of the room, he sat down and ordered some supper.\n\nThe place made no impression upon his memory. He could not have told\nyou an hour later where it was situated, who had served him, what he had\neaten, or what other persons were present in the dining-room at the time\nthat he himself entered it.\n\nHaving eaten, however, he felt more like his normal self--more conscious\nof his actions. When he finally left the eating-house, he realised, for\ninstance, that it was very cold--a fact of which he had for the past few\nhours been totally unaware. The snow was falling in thin close flakes,\nand a biting north-easterly wind was blowing those flakes into his face\nand down his collar. He wrapped his cloak tightly around him. It was\na good step yet to Blakeney's lodgings, where he knew that he was\nexpected.\n\nHe struck quickly into the Rue St. Honore, avoiding the great open\nplaces where the grim horrors of this magnificent city in revolt against\ncivilisation were displayed in all their grim nakedness--on the Place\nde la Revolution the guillotine, on the Carrousel the open-air camps of\nworkers under the lash of slave-drivers more cruel than the uncivilised\nbrutes of the Far West.\n\nAnd Armand had to think of Jeanne in the midst of all these horrors. She\nwas still a petted actress to-day, but who could tell if on the morrow\nthe terrible law of the \"suspect\" would not reach her in order to drag\nher before a tribunal that knew no mercy, and whose sole justice was a\ncondemnation?\n\nThe young man hurried on; he was anxious to be among his own comrades,\nto hear his chief's pleasant voice, to feel assured that by all the\nsacred laws of friendship Jeanne henceforth would become the special\ncare of the Scarlet Pimpernel and his league.\n\nBlakeney lodged in a small house situated on the Quai de l'Ecole, at\nthe back of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, from whence he had a clear and\nuninterrupted view across the river, as far as the irregular block of\nbuildings of the Chatelet prison and the house of Justice.\n\nThe same tower-clock that two centuries ago had tolled the signal for\nthe massacre of the Huguenots was even now striking nine. Armand slipped\nthrough the half-open porte cochere, crossed the narrow dark courtyard,\nand ran up two flights of winding stone stairs. At the top of these, a\ndoor on his right allowed a thin streak of light to filtrate between its\ntwo folds. An iron bell handle hung beside it; Armand gave it a pull.\n\nTwo minutes later he was amongst his friends. He heaved a great sigh of\ncontent and relief. The very atmosphere here seemed to be different. As\nfar as the lodging itself was concerned, it was as bare, as devoid of\ncomfort as those sort of places--so-called chambres garnies--usually\nwere in these days. The chairs looked rickety and uninviting, the sofa\nwas of black horsehair, the carpet was threadbare, and in places\nin actual holes; but there was a certain something in the air which\nrevealed, in the midst of all this squalor, the presence of a man of\nfastidious taste.\n\nTo begin with, the place was spotlessly clean; the stove, highly\npolished, gave forth a pleasing warm glow, even whilst the window,\nslightly open, allowed a modicum of fresh air to enter the room. In\na rough earthenware jug on the table stood a large bunch of Christmas\nroses, and to the educated nostril the slight scent of perfumes that\nhovered in the air was doubly pleasing after the fetid air of the narrow\nstreets.\n\nSir Andrew Ffoulkes was there, also my Lord Tony, and Lord Hastings.\nThey greeted Armand with whole-hearted cheeriness.\n\n\"Where is Blakeney?\" asked the young man as soon as he had shaken his\nfriends by the hand.\n\n\"Present!\" came in loud, pleasant accents from the door of an inner room\non the right.\n\nAnd there he stood under the lintel of the door, the man against whom\nwas raised the giant hand of an entire nation--the man for whose head\nthe revolutionary government of France would gladly pay out all the\nsavings of its Treasury--the man whom human bloodhounds were tracking,\nhot on the scent--for whom the nets of a bitter revenge and relentless\nreprisals were constantly being spread.\n\nWas he unconscious of it, or merely careless? His closest friend, Sir\nAndrew Ffoulkes, could not say. Certain it is that, as he now appeared\nbefore Armand, picturesque as ever in perfectly tailored clothes, with\npriceless lace at throat and wrists, his slender fingers holding an\nenamelled snuff-box and a handkerchief of delicate cambric, his whole\npersonality that of a dandy rather than a man of action, it seemed\nimpossible to connect him with the foolhardy escapades which had set one\nnation glowing with enthusiasm and another clamouring for revenge.\n\nBut it was the magnetism that emanated from him that could not be\ndenied; the light that now and then, swift as summer lightning, flashed\nout from the depths of the blue eyes usually veiled by heavy, lazy lids,\nthe sudden tightening of firm lips, the setting of the square jaw, which\nin a moment--but only for the space of a second--transformed the entire\nface, and revealed the born leader of men.\n\nJust now there was none of that in the debonnair, easy-going man of the\nworld who advanced to meet his friend. Armand went quickly up to him,\nglad to grasp his hand, slightly troubled with remorse, no doubt, at the\nrecollection of his adventure of to-day. It almost seemed to him that\nfrom beneath his half-closed lids Blakeney had shot a quick inquiring\nglance upon him. The quick flash seemed to light up the young man's soul\nfrom within, and to reveal it, naked, to his friend.\n\nIt was all over in a moment, and Armand thought that mayhap his\nconscience had played him a trick: there was nothing apparent in him--of\nthis he was sure--that could possibly divulge his secret just yet.\n\n\"I am rather late, I fear,\" he said. \"I wandered about the streets in\nthe late afternoon and lost my way in the dark. I hope I have not kept\nyou all waiting.\"\n\nThey all pulled chairs closely round the fire, except Blakeney, who\npreferred to stand. He waited awhile until they were all comfortably\nsettled, and all ready to listen, then:\n\n\"It is about the Dauphin,\" he said abruptly without further preamble.\n\nThey understood. All of them had guessed it, almost before the summons\ncame that had brought them to Paris two days ago. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes\nhad left his young wife because of that, and Armand had demanded it as a\nright to join hands in this noble work. Blakeney had not left France for\nover three months now. Backwards and forwards between Paris, or Nantes,\nor Orleans to the coast, where his friends would meet him to receive\nthose unfortunates whom one man's whole-hearted devotion had rescued\nfrom death; backwards and forwards into the very hearts of those cities\nwherein an army of sleuth-hounds were on his track, and the guillotine\nwas stretching out her arms to catch the foolhardy adventurer.\n\nNow it was about the Dauphin. They all waited, breathless and eager,\nthe fire of a noble enthusiasm burning in their hearts. They waited in\nsilence, their eyes fixed on the leader, lest one single word from him\nshould fail to reach their ears.\n\nThe full magnetism of the man was apparent now. As he held these\nfour men at this moment, he could have held a crowd. The man of the\nworld--the fastidious dandy--had shed his mask; there stood the leader,\ncalm, serene in the very face of the most deadly danger that had ever\nencompassed any man, looking that danger fully in the face, not striving\nto belittle it or to exaggerate it, but weighing it in the balance with\nwhat there was to accomplish: the rescue of a martyred, innocent child\nfrom the hands of fiends who were destroying his very soul even more\ncompletely than his body.\n\n\"Everything, I think, is prepared,\" resumed Sir Percy after a slight\npause. \"The Simons have been summarily dismissed; I learned that to-day.\nThey remove from the Temple on Sunday next, the nineteenth. Obviously\nthat is the one day most likely to help us in our operations. As far\nas I am concerned, I cannot make any hard-and-fast plans. Chance at the\nlast moment will have to dictate. But from every one of you I must\nhave co-operation, and it can only be by your following my directions\nimplicitly that we can even remotely hope to succeed.\"\n\nHe crossed and recrossed the room once or twice before he spoke again,\npausing now and again in his walk in front of a large map of Paris and\nits environs that hung upon the wall, his tall figure erect, his hands\nbehind his back, his eyes fixed before him as if he saw right through\nthe walls of this squalid room, and across the darkness that overhung\nthe city, through the grim bastions of the mighty building far away,\nwhere the descendant of an hundred kings lived at the mercy of human\nfiends who worked for his abasement.\n\nThe man's face now was that of a seer and a visionary; the firm lines\nwere set and rigid as those of an image carved in stone--the statue of\nheart-whole devotion, with the self-imposed task beckoning sternly to\nfollow, there where lurked danger and death.\n\n\"The way, I think, in which we could best succeed would be this,\" he\nresumed after a while, sitting now on the edge of the table and directly\nfacing his four friends. The light from the lamp which stood upon the\ntable behind him fell full upon those four glowing faces fixed eagerly\nupon him, but he himself was in shadow, a massive silhouette broadly cut\nout against the light-coloured map on the wall beyond.\n\n\"I remain here, of course, until Sunday,\" he said, \"and will closely\nwatch my opportunity, when I can with the greatest amount of safety\nenter the Temple building and take possession of the child. I shall, of\ncourse choose the moment when the Simons are actually on the move, with\ntheir successors probably coming in at about the same time. God alone\nknows,\" he added earnestly, \"how I shall contrive to get possession of\nthe child; at the moment I am just as much in the dark about that as you\nare.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and suddenly his grave face seemed flooded with\nsunshine, a kind of lazy merriment danced in his eyes, effacing all\ntrace of solemnity within them.\n\n\"La!\" he said lightly, \"on one point I am not at all in the dark, and\nthat is that His Majesty King Louis XVII will come out of that ugly\nhouse in my company next Sunday, the nineteenth day of January in this\nyear of grace seventeen hundred and ninety-four; and this, too, do I\nknow--that those murderous blackguards shall not lay hands on me whilst\nthat precious burden is in my keeping. So I pray you, my good Armand, do\nnot look so glum,\" he added with his pleasant, merry laugh; \"you'll need\nall your wits about you to help us in our undertaking.\"\n\n\"What do you wish me to do, Percy?\" said the young man simply.\n\n\"In one moment I will tell you. I want you all to understand the\nsituation first. The child will be out of the Temple on Sunday, but at\nwhat hour I know not. The later it will be the better would it suit\nmy purpose, for I cannot get him out of Paris before evening with any\nchance of safety. Here we must risk nothing; the child is far better off\nas he is now than he would be if he were dragged back after an abortive\nattempt at rescue. But at this hour of the night, between nine and ten\no'clock, I can arrange to get him out of Paris by the Villette gate, and\nthat is where I want you, Ffoulkes, and you, Tony, to be, with some kind\nof covered cart, yourselves in any disguise your ingenuity will suggest.\nHere are a few certificates of safety; I have been making a collection\nof them for some time, as they are always useful.\"\n\nHe dived into the wide pocket of his coat and drew forth a number of\ncards, greasy, much-fingered documents of the usual pattern which the\nCommittee of General Security delivered to the free citizens of the\nnew republic, and without which no one could enter or leave any town or\ncountry commune without being detained as \"suspect.\" He glanced at them\nand handed them over to Ffoulkes.\n\n\"Choose your own identity for the occasion, my good friend,\" he said\nlightly; \"and you too, Tony. You may be stonemasons or coal-carriers,\nchimney-sweeps or farm-labourers, I care not which so long as you look\nsufficiently grimy and wretched to be unrecognisable, and so long as\nyou can procure a cart without arousing suspicions, and can wait for me\npunctually at the appointed spot.\"\n\nFfoulkes turned over the cards, and with a laugh handed them over\nto Lord Tony. The two fastidious gentlemen discussed for awhile the\nrespective merits of a chimney-sweep's uniform as against that of a\ncoal-carrier.\n\n\"You can carry more grime if you are a sweep,\" suggested Blakeney; \"and\nif the soot gets into your eyes it does not make them smart like coal\ndoes.\"\n\n\"But soot adheres more closely,\" argued Tony solemnly, \"and I know that\nwe shan't get a bath for at least a week afterwards.\"\n\n\"Certainly you won't, you sybarite!\" asserted Sir Percy with a laugh.\n\n\"After a week soot might become permanent,\" mused Sir Andrew, wondering\nwhat, under the circumstance, my lady would say to him.\n\n\"If you are both so fastidious,\" retorted Blakeney, shrugging his broad\nshoulders, \"I'll turn one of you into a reddleman, and the other into a\ndyer. Then one of you will be bright scarlet to the end of his days, as\nthe reddle never comes off the skin at all, and the other will have to\nsoak in turpentine before the dye will consent to move.... In either\ncase... oh, my dear Tony!... the smell....\"\n\nHe laughed like a schoolboy in anticipation of a prank, and held his\nscented handkerchief to his nose. My Lord Hastings chuckled audibly, and\nTony punched him for this unseemly display of mirth.\n\nArmand watched the little scene in utter amazement. He had been in\nEngland over a year, and yet he could not understand these Englishmen.\nSurely they were the queerest, most inconsequent people in the world.\nHere were these men, who were engaged at this very moment in an\nenterprise which for cool-headed courage and foolhardy daring had\nprobably no parallel in history. They were literally taking their lives\nin their hands, in all probability facing certain death; and yet they\nnow sat chaffing and fighting like a crowd of third-form schoolboys,\ntalking utter, silly nonsense, and making foolish jokes that would have\nshamed a Frenchman in his teens. Vaguely he wondered what fat, pompous\nde Batz would think of this discussion if he could overhear it. His\ncontempt, no doubt, for the Scarlet Pimpernel and his followers would be\nincreased tenfold.\n\nThen at last the question of the disguise was effectually dismissed. Sir\nAndrew Ffoulkes and Lord Anthony Dewhurst had settled their differences\nof opinion by solemnly agreeing to represent two over-grimy and\noverheated coal-heavers. They chose two certificates of safety that were\nmade out in the names of Jean Lepetit and Achille Grospierre, labourers.\n\n\"Though you don't look at all like an Achille, Tony,\" was Blakeney's\nparting shot to his friend.\n\nThen without any transition from this schoolboy nonsense to the serious\nbusiness of the moment, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes said abruptly:\n\n\"Tell us exactly, Blakeney, where you will want the cart to stand on\nSunday.\"\n\nBlakeney rose and turned to the map against the wall, Ffoulkes and Tony\nfollowing him. They stood close to his elbow whilst his slender, nervy\nhand wandered along the shiny surface of the varnished paper. At last he\nplaced his finger on one spot.\n\n\"Here you see,\" he said, \"is the Villette gate. Just outside it a narrow\nstreet on the right leads down in the direction of the canal. It is just\nat the bottom of that narrow street at its junction with the tow-path\nthere that I want you two and the cart to be. It had better be a\ncoal-car by the way; they will be unloading coal close by there\nto-morrow,\" he added with one of his sudden irrepressible outbursts of\nmerriment. \"You and Tony can exercise your muscles coal-heaving, and\nincidentally make yourselves known in the neighbourhood as good if\nsomewhat grimy patriots.\"\n\n\"We had better take up our parts at once then,\" said Tony. \"I'll take a\nfond farewell of my clean shirt to-night.\"\n\n\"Yes, you will not see one again for some time, my good Tony. After\nyour hard day's work to-morrow you will have to sleep either inside your\ncart, if you have already secured one, or under the arches of the canal\nbridge, if you have not.\"\n\n\"I hope you have an equally pleasant prospect for Hastings,\" was my Lord\nTony's grim comment.\n\nIt was easy to see that he was as happy as a schoolboy about to start\nfor a holiday. Lord Tony was a true sportsman. Perhaps there was in him\nless sentiment for the heroic work which he did under the guidance of\nhis chief than an inherent passion for dangerous adventures. Sir Andrew\nFfoulkes, on the other hand, thought perhaps a little less of the\nadventure, but a great deal of the martyred child in the Temple. He was\njust as buoyant, just as keen as his friend, but the leaven of\nsentiment raised his sporting instincts to perhaps a higher plane of\nself-devotion.\n\n\"Well, now, to recapitulate,\" he said, in turn following with his finger\nthe indicated route on the map. \"Tony and I and the coal-cart will await\nyou on this spot, at the corner of the towpath on Sunday evening at nine\no'clock.\"\n\n\"And your signal, Blakeney?\" asked Tony.\n\n\"The usual one,\" replied Sir Percy, \"the seamew's cry thrice repeated at\nbrief intervals. But now,\" he continued, turning to Armand and Hastings,\nwho had taken no part in the discussion hitherto, \"I want your help a\nlittle further afield.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" nodded Hastings.\n\n\"The coal-cart, with its usual miserable nag, will carry us a distance\nof fifteen or sixteen kilometres, but no more. My purpose is to cut\nalong the north of the city, and to reach St. Germain, the nearest point\nwhere we can secure good mounts. There is a farmer just outside the\ncommune; his name is Achard. He has excellent horses, which I have\nborrowed before now; we shall want five, of course, and he has one\npowerful beast that will do for me, as I shall have, in addition to\nmy own weight, which is considerable, to take the child with me on\nthe pillion. Now you, Hastings and Armand, will have to start early\nto-morrow morning, leave Paris by the Neuilly gate, and from there make\nyour way to St. Germain by any conveyance you can contrive to obtain. At\nSt. Germain you must at once find Achard's farm; disguised as labourers\nyou will not arouse suspicion by so doing. You will find the farmer\nquite amenable to money, and you must secure the best horses you can get\nfor our own use, and, if possible, the powerful mount I spoke of just\nnow. You are both excellent horse-men, therefore I selected you amongst\nthe others for this special errand, for you two, with the five horses,\nwill have to come and meet our coal-cart some seventeen kilometres\nout of St. Germain, to where the first sign-post indicates the road to\nCourbevoie. Some two hundred metres down this road on the right there is\na small spinney, which will afford splendid shelter for yourselves and\nyour horses. We hope to be there at about one o'clock after midnight\nof Monday morning. Now, is all that quite clear, and are you both\nsatisfied?\"\n\n\"It is quite clear,\" exclaimed Hastings placidly; \"but I, for one, am\nnot at all satisfied.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"Because it is all too easy. We get none of the danger.\"\n\n\"Oho! I thought that you would bring that argument forward, you\nincorrigible grumbler,\" laughed Sir Percy good-humouredly. \"Let me tell\nyou that if you start to-morrow from Paris in that spirit you will run\nyour head and Armand's into a noose long before you reach the gate of\nNeuilly. I cannot allow either of you to cover your faces with too much\ngrime; an honest farm labourer should not look over-dirty, and your\nchances of being discovered and detained are, at the outset, far greater\nthan those which Ffoulkes and Tony will run--\"\n\nArmand had said nothing during this time. While Blakeney was unfolding\nhis plan for him and for Lord Hastings--a plan which practically was a\ncommand--he had sat with his arms folded across his chest, his head sunk\nupon his breast. When Blakeney had asked if they were satisfied, he\nhad taken no part in Hastings' protest nor responded to his leader's\ngood-humoured banter.\n\nThough he did not look up even now, yet he felt that Percy's eyes were\nfixed upon him, and they seemed to scorch into his soul. He made a great\neffort to appear eager like the others, and yet from the first a chill\nhad struck at his heart. He could not leave Paris before he had seen\nJeanne.\n\nHe looked up suddenly, trying to seem unconcerned; he even looked his\nchief fully in the face.\n\n\"When ought we to leave Paris?\" he asked calmly.\n\n\"You MUST leave at daybreak,\" replied Blakeney with a slight, almost\nimperceptible emphasis on the word of command. \"When the gates are first\nopened, and the work-people go to and fro at their work, that is the\nsafest hour. And you must be at St. Germain as soon as may be, or the\nfarmer may not have a sufficiency of horses available at a moment's\nnotice. I want you to be spokesman with Achard, so that Hastings'\nBritish accent should not betray you both. Also you might not get\na conveyance for St. Germain immediately. We must think of every\neventuality, Armand. There is so much at stake.\"\n\nArmand made no further comment just then. But the others looked\nastonished. Armand had but asked a simple question, and Blakeney's reply\nseemed almost like a rebuke--so circumstantial too, and so explanatory.\nHe was so used to being obeyed at a word, so accustomed that the merest\nwish, the slightest hint from him was understood by his band of devoted\nfollowers, that the long explanation of his orders which he gave to\nArmand struck them all with a strange sense of unpleasant surprise.\n\nHastings was the first to break the spell that seemed to have fallen\nover the party.\n\n\"We leave at daybreak, of course,\" he said, \"as soon as the gates are\nopen. We can, I know, get one of the carriers to give us a lift as far\nas St. Germain. There, how do we find Achard?\"\n\n\"He is a well-known farmer,\" replied Blakeney. \"You have but to ask.\"\n\n\"Good. Then we bespeak five horses for the next day, find lodgings in\nthe village that night, and make a fresh start back towards Paris in the\nevening of Sunday. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Yes. One of you will have two horses on the lead, the other one. Pack\nsome fodder on the empty saddles and start at about ten o'clock. Ride\nstraight along the main road, as if you were making back for Paris,\nuntil you come to four cross-roads with a sign-post pointing to\nCourbevoie. Turn down there and go along the road until you meet a close\nspinney of fir-trees on your right. Make for the interior of that. It\ngives splendid shelter, and you can dismount there and give the horses a\nfeed. We'll join you one hour after midnight. The night will be dark, I\nhope, and the moon anyhow will be on the wane.\"\n\n\"I think I understand. Anyhow, it's not difficult, and we'll be as\ncareful as may be.\"\n\n\"You will have to keep your heads clear, both of you,\" concluded\nBlakeney.\n\nHe was looking at Armand as he said this; but the young man had not made\na movement during this brief colloquy between Hastings and the chief. He\nstill sat with arms folded, his head falling on his breast.\n\nSilence had fallen on them all. They all sat round the fire buried in\nthought. Through the open window there came from the quay beyond the hum\nof life in the open-air camp; the tramp of the sentinels around it, the\nwords of command from the drill-sergeant, and through it all the moaning\nof the wind and the beating of the sleet against the window-panes.\n\nA whole world of wretchedness was expressed by those sounds! Blakeney\ngave a quick, impatient sigh, and going to the window he pushed it\nfurther open, and just then there came from afar the muffled roll of\ndrums, and from below the watchman's cry that seemed such dire mockery:\n\n\"Sleep, citizens! Everything is safe and peaceful.\"\n\n\"Sound advice,\" said Blakeney lightly. \"Shall we also go to sleep? What\nsay you all--eh?\"\n\nHe had with that sudden rapidity characteristic of his every action,\nalready thrown off the serious air which he had worn a moment ago when\ngiving instructions to Hastings. His usual debonnair manner was on him\nonce again, his laziness, his careless insouciance. He was even at\nthis moment deeply engaged in flicking off a grain of dust from the\nimmaculate Mechlin ruff at his wrist. The heavy lids had fallen over the\ntell-tale eyes as if weighted with fatigue, the mouth appeared ready for\nthe laugh which never was absent from it very long.\n\nIt was only Ffoulkes's devoted eyes that were sharp enough to pierce the\nmask of light-hearted gaiety which enveloped the soul of his leader at\nthe present moment. He saw--for the first time in all the years that\nhe had known Blakeney--a frown across the habitually smooth brow, and\nthough the lips were parted for a laugh, the lines round mouth and chin\nwere hard and set.\n\nWith that intuition born of whole-hearted friendship Sir Andrew guessed\nwhat troubled Percy. He had caught the look which the latter had thrown\non Armand, and knew that some explanation would have to pass between the\ntwo men before they parted to-night. Therefore he gave the signal for\nthe breaking up of the meeting.\n\n\"There is nothing more to say, is there, Blakeney?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, my good fellow, nothing,\" replied Sir Percy. \"I do not know how you\nall feel, but I am demmed fatigued.\"\n\n\"What about the rags for to-morrow?\" queried Hastings.\n\n\"You know where to find them. In the room below. Ffoulkes has the key.\nWigs and all are there. But don't use false hair if you can help it--it\nis apt to shift in a scrimmage.\"\n\nHe spoke jerkily, more curtly than was his wont. Hastings and Tony\nthought that he was tired. They rose to say good night. Then the three\nmen went away together, Armand remaining behind.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. WHAT LOVE IS\n\n\"Well, now, Armand, what is it?\" asked Blakeney, the moment the\nfootsteps of his friends had died away down the stone stairs, and their\nvoices had ceased to echo in the distance.\n\n\"You guessed, then, that there was... something?\" said the younger man,\nafter a slight hesitation.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nArmand rose, pushing the chair away from him with an impatient nervy\ngesture. Burying his hands in the pockets of his breeches, he began\nstriding up and down the room, a dark, troubled expression in his face,\na deep frown between his eyes.\n\nBlakeney had once more taken up his favourite position, sitting on the\ncorner of the table, his broad shoulders interposed between the lamp and\nthe rest of the room. He was apparently taking no notice of Armand, but\nonly intent on the delicate operation of polishing his nails.\n\nSuddenly the young man paused in his restless walk and stood in front of\nhis friend--an earnest, solemn, determined figure.\n\n\"Blakeney,\" he said, \"I cannot leave Paris to-morrow.\"\n\nSir Percy made no reply. He was contemplating the polish which he had\njust succeeded in producing on his thumbnail.\n\n\"I must stay here for a while longer,\" continued Armand firmly. \"I may\nnot be able to return to England for some weeks. You have the three\nothers here to help you in your enterprise outside Paris. I am entirely\nat your service within the compass of its walls.\"\n\nStill no comment from Blakeney, not a look from beneath the fallen\nlids. Armand continued, with a slight tone of impatience apparent in his\nvoice:\n\n\"You must want some one to help you here on Sunday. I am entirely at\nyour service... here or anywhere in Paris... but I cannot leave this\ncity... at any rate, not just yet....\"\n\nBlakeney was apparently satisfied at last with the result of his\npolishing operations. He rose, gave a slight yawn, and turned toward the\ndoor.\n\n\"Good night, my dear fellow,\" he said pleasantly; \"it is time we were\nall abed. I am so demmed fatigued.\"\n\n\"Percy!\" exclaimed the young man hotly.\n\n\"Eh? What is it?\" queried the other lazily.\n\n\"You are not going to leave me like this--without a word?\"\n\n\"I have said a great many words, my good fellow. I have said 'good\nnight,' and remarked that I was demmed fatigued.\"\n\nHe was standing beside the door which led to his bedroom, and now he\npushed it open with his hand.\n\n\"Percy, you cannot go and leave me like this!\" reiterated Armand with\nrapidly growing irritation.\n\n\"Like what, my dear fellow?\" queried Sir Percy with good-humoured\nimpatience.\n\n\"Without a word--without a sign. What have I done that you should treat\nme like a child, unworthy even of attention?\"\n\nBlakeney had turned back and was now facing him, towering above the\nslight figure of the younger man. His face had lost none of its gracious\nair, and beneath their heavy lids his eyes looked down not unkindly on\nhis friend.\n\n\"Would you have preferred it, Armand,\" he said quietly, \"if I had said\nthe word that your ears have heard even though my lips have not uttered\nit?\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" murmured Armand defiantly.\n\n\"What sign would you have had me make?\" continued Sir Percy,\nhis pleasant voice falling calm and mellow on the younger man's\nsupersensitive consciousness: \"That of branding you, Marguerite's\nbrother, as a liar and a cheat?\"\n\n\"Blakeney!\" retorted the other, as with flaming cheeks and wrathful eyes\nhe took a menacing step toward his friend; \"had any man but you dared to\nspeak such words to me--\"\n\n\"I pray to God, Armand, that no man but I has the right to speak them.\"\n\n\"You have no right.\"\n\n\"Every right, my friend. Do I not hold your oath?... Are you not\nprepared to break it?\"\n\n\"I'll not break my oath to you. I'll serve and help you in every way\nyou can command... my life I'll give to the cause... give me the most\ndangerous--the most difficult task to perform.... I'll do it--I'll do it\ngladly.\"\n\n\"I have given you an over-difficult and dangerous task.\"\n\n\"Bah! To leave Paris in order to engage horses, while you and the others\ndo all the work. That is neither difficult nor dangerous.\"\n\n\"It will be difficult for you, Armand, because your head is not\nsufficiently cool to foresee serious eventualities and to prepare\nagainst them. It is dangerous, because you are a man in love, and a man\nin love is apt to run his head--and that of his friends--blindly into a\nnoose.\"\n\n\"Who told you that I was in love?\"\n\n\"You yourself, my good fellow. Had you not told me so at the outset,\"\nhe continued, still speaking very quietly and deliberately and never\nraising his voice, \"I would even now be standing over you, dog-whip in\nhand, to thrash you as a defaulting coward and a perjurer .... Bah!\"\nhe added with a return to his habitual bonhomie, \"I would no doubt even\nhave lost my temper with you. Which would have been purposeless and\nexcessively bad form. Eh?\"\n\nA violent retort had sprung to Armand's lips. But fortunately at that\nvery moment his eyes, glowing with anger, caught those of Blakeney fixed\nwith lazy good-nature upon his. Something of that irresistible dignity\nwhich pervaded the whole personality of the man checked Armand's\nhotheaded words on his lips.\n\n\"I cannot leave Paris to-morrow,\" he reiterated more calmly.\n\n\"Because you have arranged to see her again?\"\n\n\"Because she saved my life to-day, and is herself in danger.\"\n\n\"She is in no danger,\" said Blakeney simply, \"since she saved the life\nof my friend.\"\n\n\"Percy!\"\n\nThe cry was wrung from Armand St. Just's very soul. Despite the tumult\nof passion which was raging in his heart, he was conscious again of the\nmagnetic power which bound so many to this man's service. The words he\nhad said--simple though they were--had sent a thrill through Armand's\nveins. He felt himself disarmed. His resistance fell before the subtle\nstrength of an unbendable will; nothing remained in his heart but an\noverwhelming sense of shame and of impotence.\n\nHe sank into a chair and rested his elbows on the table, burying his\nface in his hands. Blakeney went up to him and placed a kindly hand upon\nhis shoulder.\n\n\"The difficult task, Armand,\" he said gently.\n\n\"Percy, cannot you release me? She saved my life. I have not thanked her\nyet.\"\n\n\"There will be time for thanks later, Armand. Just now over yonder the\nson of kings is being done to death by savage brutes.\"\n\n\"I would not hinder you if I stayed.\"\n\n\"God knows you have hindered us enough already.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"You say she saved your life... then you were in danger... Heron and his\nspies have been on your track; your track leads to mine, and I have sworn\nto save the Dauphin from the hands of thieves.... A man in love, Armand,\nis a deadly danger among us.... Therefore at daybreak you must leave\nParis with Hastings on your difficult and dangerous task.\"\n\n\"And if I refuse?\" retorted Armand.\n\n\"My good fellow,\" said Blakeney earnestly, \"in that admirable lexicon\nwhich the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel has compiled for itself there\nis no such word as refuse.\"\n\n\"But if I do refuse?\" persisted the other.\n\n\"You would be offering a tainted name and tarnished honour to the woman\nyou pretend to love.\"\n\n\"And you insist upon my obedience?\"\n\n\"By the oath which I hold from you.\"\n\n\"But this is cruel--inhuman!\"\n\n\"Honour, my good Armand, is often cruel and seldom human. He is a\ngodlike taskmaster, and we who call ourselves men are all of us his\nslaves.\"\n\n\"The tyranny comes from you alone. You could release me an you would.\"\n\n\"And to gratify the selfish desire of immature passion, you would wish\nto see me jeopardise the life of those who place infinite trust in me.\"\n\n\"God knows how you have gained their allegiance, Blakeney. To me now you\nare selfish and callous.\"\n\n\"There is the difficult task you craved for, Armand,\" was all the answer\nthat Blakeney made to the taunt--\"to obey a leader whom you no longer\ntrust.\"\n\nBut this Armand could not brook. He had spoken hotly, impetuously,\nsmarting under the discipline which thwarted his desire, but his heart\nwas loyal to the chief whom he had reverenced for so long.\n\n\"Forgive me, Percy,\" he said humbly; \"I am distracted. I don't think\nI quite realised what I was saying. I trust you, of course ...\nimplicitly... and you need not even fear... I shall not break my oath,\nthough your orders now seem to me needlessly callous and selfish.... I\nwill obey... you need not be afraid.\"\n\n\"I was not afraid of that, my good fellow.\"\n\n\"Of course, you do not understand... you cannot. To you, your honour,\nthe task which you have set yourself, has been your only fetish.... Love\nin its true sense does not exist for you.... I see it now... you do not\nknow what it is to love.\"\n\nBlakeney made no reply for the moment. He stood in the centre of the\nroom, with the yellow light of the lamp falling full now upon his tall\npowerful frame, immaculately dressed in perfectly-tailored clothes, upon\nhis long, slender hands half hidden by filmy lace, and upon his face,\nacross which at this moment a heavy strand of curly hair threw a curious\nshadow. At Armand's words his lips had imperceptibly tightened, his eyes\nhad narrowed as if they tried to see something that was beyond the range\nof their focus.\n\nAcross the smooth brow the strange shadow made by the hair seemed to\nfind a reflex from within. Perhaps the reckless adventurer, the careless\ngambler with life and liberty, saw through the walls of this squalid\nroom, across the wide, ice-bound river, and beyond even the gloomy pile\nof buildings opposite, a cool, shady garden at Richmond, a velvety lawn\nsweeping down to the river's edge, a bower of clematis and roses, with\na carved stone seat half covered with moss. There sat an exquisitely\nbeautiful woman with great sad eyes fixed on the far-distant horizon.\nThe setting sun was throwing a halo of gold all round her hair, her\nwhite hands were clasped idly on her lap.\n\nShe gazed out beyond the river, beyond the sunset, toward an unseen\nbourne of peace and happiness, and her lovely face had in it a look of\nutter hopelessness and of sublime self-abnegation. The air was still.\nIt was late autumn, and all around her the russet leaves of beech and\nchestnut fell with a melancholy hush-sh-sh about her feet.\n\nShe was alone, and from time to time heavy tears gathered in her eyes\nand rolled slowly down her cheeks.\n\nSuddenly a sigh escaped the man's tightly-pressed lips. With a strange\ngesture, wholly unusual to him, he passed his hand right across his\neyes.\n\n\"Mayhap you are right, Armand,\" he said quietly; \"mayhap I do not know\nwhat it is to love.\"\n\nArmand turned to go. There was nothing more to be said. He knew Percy\nwell enough by now to realise the finality of his pronouncements. His\nheart felt sore, but he was too proud to show his hurt again to a\nman who did not understand. All thoughts of disobedience he had put\nresolutely aside; he had never meant to break his oath. All that he had\nhoped to do was to persuade Percy to release him from it for awhile.\n\nThat by leaving Paris he risked to lose Jeanne he was quite convinced,\nbut it is nevertheless a true fact that in spite of this he did not\nwithdraw his love and trust from his chief. He was under the influence\nof that same magnetism which enchained all his comrades to the will of\nthis man; and though his enthusiasm for the great cause had somewhat\nwaned, his allegiance to its leader was no longer tottering.\n\nBut he would not trust himself to speak again on the subject.\n\n\"I will find the others downstairs,\" was all he said, \"and will arrange\nwith Hastings for to-morrow. Good night, Percy.\"\n\n\"Good night, my dear fellow. By the way, you have not told me yet who\nshe is.\"\n\n\"Her name is Jeanne Lange,\" said St. Just half reluctantly. He had not\nmeant to divulge his secret quite so fully as yet.\n\n\"The young actress at the Theatre National?\"\n\n\"Yes. Do you know her?\"\n\n\"Only by name.\"\n\n\"She is beautiful, Percy, and she is an angel.... Think of my sister\nMarguerite... she, too, was an actress.... Good night, Percy.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\nThe two men grasped one another by the hand. Armand's eyes proffered\na last desperate appeal. But Blakeney's eyes were impassive and\nunrelenting, and Armand with a quick sigh finally took his leave.\n\nFor a long while after he had gone Blakeney stood silent and motionless\nin the middle of the room. Armand's last words lingered in his ear:\n\n\"Think of Marguerite!\"\n\nThe walls had fallen away from around him--the window, the river\nbelow, the Temple prison had all faded away, merged in the chaos of his\nthoughts.\n\nNow he was no longer in Paris; he heard nothing of the horrors that even\nat this hour of the night were raging around him; he did not hear the\ncall of murdered victims, of innocent women and children crying for\nhelp; he did not see the descendant of St. Louis, with a red cap on\nhis baby head, stamping on the fleur-de-lys, and heaping insults on the\nmemory of his mother. All that had faded into nothingness.\n\nHe was in the garden at Richmond, and Marguerite was sitting on the\nstone seat, with branches of the rambler roses twining themselves in her\nhair.\n\nHe was sitting on the ground at her feet, his head pillowed in her lap,\nlazily dreaming whilst at his feet the river wound its graceful curves\nbeneath overhanging willows and tall stately elms.\n\nA swan came sailing majestically down the stream, and Marguerite, with\nidle, delicate hands, threw some crumbs of bread into the water. Then\nshe laughed, for she was quite happy, and anon she stooped, and he felt\nthe fragrance of her lips as she bent over him and savoured the perfect\nsweetness of her caress. She was happy because her husband was by her\nside. He had done with adventures, with risking his life for others'\nsake. He was living only for her.\n\nThe man, the dreamer, the idealist that lurked behind the adventurous\nsoul, lived an exquisite dream as he gazed upon that vision. He closed\nhis eyes so that it might last all the longer, so that through the\nopen window opposite he should not see the great gloomy walls of the\nlabyrinthine building packed to overflowing with innocent men, women,\nand children waiting patiently and with a smile on their lips for a\ncruel and unmerited death; so that he should not see even through the\nvista of houses and of streets that grim Temple prison far away, and the\nlight in one of the tower windows, which illumined the final martyrdom\nof a boy-king.\n\nThus he stood for fully five minutes, with eyes deliberately closed\nand lips tightly set. Then the neighbouring tower-clock of St. Germain\nl'Auxerrois slowly tolled the hour of midnight. Blakeney woke from his\ndream. The walls of his lodging were once more around him, and through\nthe window the ruddy light of some torch in the street below fought with\nthat of the lamp.\n\nHe went deliberately up to the window and looked out into the night. On\nthe quay, a little to the left, the outdoor camp was just breaking up\nfor the night. The people of France in arms against tyranny were allowed\nto put away their work for the day and to go to their miserable homes\nto gather rest in sleep for the morrow. A band of soldiers, rough and\nbrutal in their movements, were hustling the women and children. The\nlittle ones, weary, sleepy, and cold, seemed too dazed to move. One\nwoman had two little children clinging to her skirts; a soldier suddenly\nseized one of them by the shoulders and pushed it along roughly in front\nof him to get it out of the way. The woman struck at the soldier in a\nstupid, senseless, useless way, and then gathered her trembling chicks\nunder her wing, trying to look defiant.\n\nIn a moment she was surrounded. Two soldiers seized her, and two more\ndragged the children away from her. She screamed and the children cried,\nthe soldiers swore and struck out right and left with their bayonets.\nThere was a general melee, calls of agony rent the air, rough oaths\ndrowned the shouts of the helpless. Some women, panic-stricken, started\nto run.\n\nAnd Blakeney from his window looked down upon the scene. He no longer\nsaw the garden at Richmond, the lazily-flowing river, the bowers of\nroses; even the sweet face of Marguerite, sad and lonely, appeared dim\nand far away.\n\nHe looked across the ice-bound river, past the quay where rough soldiers\nwere brutalising a number of wretched defenceless women, to that grim\nChatelet prison, where tiny lights shining here and there behind barred\nwindows told the sad tale of weary vigils, of watches through the night,\nwhen dawn would bring martyrdom and death.\n\nAnd it was not Marguerite's blue eyes that beckoned to him now, it was\nnot her lips that called, but the wan face of a child with matted curls\nhanging above a greasy forehead, and small hands covered in grime that\nhad once been fondled by a Queen.\n\nThe adventurer in him had chased away the dream.\n\n\"While there is life in me I'll cheat those brutes of prey,\" he\nmurmured.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. THEN EVERYTHING WAS DARK\n\nThe night that Armand St. Just spent tossing about on a hard, narrow bed\nwas the most miserable, agonising one he had ever passed in his life.\nA kind of fever ran through him, causing his teeth to chatter and the\nveins in his temples to throb until he thought that they must burst.\n\nPhysically he certainly was ill; the mental strain caused by two great\nconflicting passions had attacked his bodily strength, and whilst his\nbrain and heart fought their battles together, his aching limbs found no\nrepose.\n\nHis love for Jeanne! His loyalty to the man to whom he owed his life,\nand to whom he had sworn allegiance and implicit obedience!\n\nThese superacute feelings seemed to be tearing at his very heartstrings,\nuntil he felt that he could no longer lie on the miserable palliasse\nwhich in these squalid lodgings did duty for a bed.\n\nHe rose long before daybreak, with tired back and burning eyes, but\nunconscious of any pain save that which tore at his heart.\n\nThe weather, fortunately, was not quite so cold--a sudden and very rapid\nthaw had set in; and when after a hurried toilet Armand, carrying a\nbundle under his arm, emerged into the street, the mild south wind\nstruck pleasantly on his face.\n\nIt was then pitch dark. The street lamps had been extinguished long ago,\nand the feeble January sun had not yet tinged with pale colour the heavy\nclouds that hung over the sky.\n\nThe streets of the great city were absolutely deserted at this hour. It\nlay, peaceful and still, wrapped in its mantle of gloom. A thin rain\nwas falling, and Armand's feet, as he began to descend the heights of\nMontmartre, sank ankle deep in the mud of the road. There was but scanty\nattempt at pavements in this outlying quarter of the town, and Armand\nhad much ado to keep his footing on the uneven and intermittent stones\nthat did duty for roads in these parts. But this discomfort did not\ntrouble him just now. One thought--and one alone--was clear in his mind:\nhe must see Jeanne before he left Paris.\n\nHe did not pause to think how he could accomplish that at this hour of\nthe day. All he knew was that he must obey his chief, and that he must\nsee Jeanne. He would see her, explain to her that he must leave Paris\nimmediately, and beg her to make her preparations quickly, so that she\nmight meet him as soon as maybe, and accompany him to England straight\naway.\n\nHe did not feel that he was being disloyal by trying to see Jeanne.\nHe had thrown prudence to the winds, not realising that his imprudence\nwould and did jeopardise, not only the success of his chief's plans,\nbut also his life and that of his friends. He had before parting from\nHastings last night arranged to meet him in the neighbourhood of the\nNeuilly Gate at seven o'clock; it was only six now. There was plenty of\ntime for him to rouse the concierge at the house of the Square du Roule,\nto see Jeanne for a few moments, to slip into Madame Belhomme's kitchen,\nand there into the labourer's clothes which he was carrying in the\nbundle under his arm, and to be at the gate at the appointed hour.\n\nThe Square du Roule is shut off from the Rue St. Honore, on which it\nabuts, by tall iron gates, which a few years ago, when the secluded\nlittle square was a fashionable quarter of the city, used to be kept\nclosed at night, with a watchman in uniform to intercept midnight\nprowlers. Now these gates had been rudely torn away from their sockets,\nthe iron had been sold for the benefit of the ever-empty Treasury,\nand no one cared if the homeless, the starving, or the evil-doer found\nshelter under the porticoes of the houses, from whence wealthy or\naristocratic owners had long since thought it wise to flee.\n\nNo one challenged Armand when he turned into the square, and though\nthe darkness was intense, he made his way fairly straight for the house\nwhere lodged Mademoiselle Lange.\n\nSo far he had been wonderfully lucky. The foolhardiness with which he\nhad exposed his life and that of his friends by wandering about the\nstreets of Paris at this hour without any attempt at disguise, though\ncarrying one under his arm, had not met with the untoward fate which it\nundoubtedly deserved. The darkness of the night and the thin sheet of\nrain as it fell had effectually wrapped his progress through the lonely\nstreets in their beneficent mantle of gloom; the soft mud below had\ndrowned the echo of his footsteps. If spies were on his track, as\nJeanne had feared and Blakeney prophesied, he had certainly succeeded in\nevading them.\n\nHe pulled the concierge's bell, and the latch of the outer door,\nmanipulated from within, duly sprang open in response. He entered, and\nfrom the lodge the concierge's voice emerging, muffled from the depths\nof pillows and blankets, challenged him with an oath directed at the\nunseemliness of the hour.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Lange,\" said Armand boldly, as without hesitation he\nwalked quickly past the lodge making straight for the stairs.\n\nIt seemed to him that from the concierge's room loud vituperations\nfollowed him, but he took no notice of these; only a short flight of\nstairs and one more door separated him from Jeanne.\n\nHe did not pause to think that she would in all probability be still in\nbed, that he might have some difficulty in rousing Madame Belhomme, that\nthe latter might not even care to admit him; nor did he reflect on the\nglaring imprudence of his actions. He wanted to see Jeanne, and she was\nthe other side of that wall.\n\n\"He, citizen! Hola! Here! Curse you! Where are you?\" came in a gruff\nvoice to him from below.\n\nHe had mounted the stairs, and was now on the landing just outside\nJeanne's door. He pulled the bell-handle, and heard the pleasing echo of\nthe bell that would presently wake Madame Belhomme and bring her to the\ndoor.\n\n\"Citizen! Hola! Curse you for an aristo! What are you doing there?\"\n\nThe concierge, a stout, elderly man, wrapped in a blanket, his feet\nthrust in slippers, and carrying a guttering tallow candle, had appeared\nupon the landing.\n\nHe held the candle up so that its feeble flickering rays fell on\nArmand's pale face, and on the damp cloak which fell away from his\nshoulders.\n\n\"What are you doing there?\" reiterated the concierge with another oath\nfrom his prolific vocabulary.\n\n\"As you see, citizen,\" replied Armand politely, \"I am ringing\nMademoiselle Lange's front door bell.\"\n\n\"At this hour of the morning?\" queried the man with a sneer.\n\n\"I desire to see her.\"\n\n\"Then you have come to the wrong house, citizen,\" said the concierge\nwith a rude laugh.\n\n\"The wrong house? What do you mean?\" stammered Armand, a little\nbewildered.\n\n\"She is not here--quoi!\" retorted the concierge, who now turned\ndeliberately on his heel. \"Go and look for her, citizen; it'll take you\nsome time to find her.\"\n\nHe shuffled off in the direction of the stairs. Armand was vainly trying\nto shake himself free from a sudden, an awful sense of horror.\n\nHe gave another vigorous pull at the hell, then with one bound he\novertook the concierge, who was preparing to descend the stairs, and\ngripped him peremptorily by the arm.\n\n\"Where is Mademoiselle Lange?\" he asked.\n\nHis voice sounded quite strange in his own ear; his throat felt parched,\nand he had to moisten his lips with his tongue before he was able to\nspeak.\n\n\"Arrested,\" replied the man.\n\n\"Arrested? When? Where? How?\"\n\n\"When--late yesterday evening. Where?--here in her room. How?--by the\nagents of the Committee of General Security. She and the old woman!\nBasta! that's all I know. Now I am going back to bed, and you clear out\nof the house. You are making a disturbance, and I shall be reprimanded.\nI ask you, is this a decent time for rousing honest patriots out of\ntheir morning sleep?\"\n\nHe shook his arm free from Armand's grasp and once more began to\ndescend.\n\nArmand stood on the landing like a man who has been stunned by a blow\non the head. His limbs were paralysed. He could not for the moment have\nmoved or spoken if his life had depended on a sign or on a word. His\nbrain was reeling, and he had to steady himself with his hand against\nthe wall or he would have fallen headlong on the floor. He had lived in\na whirl of excitement for the past twenty-four hours; his nerves during\nthat time had been kept at straining point. Passion, joy, happiness,\ndeadly danger, and moral fights had worn his mental endurance\nthreadbare; want of proper food and a sleepless night had almost thrown\nhis physical balance out of gear. This blow came at a moment when he was\nleast able to bear it.\n\nJeanne had been arrested! Jeanne was in the hands of those brutes, whom\nhe, Armand, had regarded yesterday with insurmountable loathing! Jeanne\nwas in prison--she was arrested--she would be tried, condemned, and all\nbecause of him!\n\nThe thought was so awful that it brought him to the verge of mania. He\nwatched as in a dream the form of the concierge shuffling his way down\nthe oak staircase; his portly figure assumed Gargantuan proportions, the\ncandle which he carried looked like the dancing flames of hell, through\nwhich grinning faces, hideous and contortioned, mocked at him and\nleered.\n\nThen suddenly everything was dark. The light had disappeared round the\nbend of the stairs; grinning faces and ghoulish visions vanished; he\nonly saw Jeanne, his dainty, exquisite Jeanne, in the hands of those\nbrutes. He saw her as he had seen a year and a half ago the victims of\nthose bloodthirsty wretches being dragged before a tribunal that was\nbut a mockery of justice; he heard the quick interrogatory, and the\nresponses from her perfect lips, that exquisite voice of hers veiled by\ntones of anguish. He heard the condemnation, the rattle of the tumbril\non the ill-paved streets--saw her there with hands clasped together, her\neyes--\n\nGreat God! he was really going mad!\n\nLike a wild creature driven forth he started to run down the stairs,\npast the concierge, who was just entering his lodge, and who now turned\nin surly anger to watch this man running away like a lunatic or a fool,\nout by the front door and into the street. In a moment he was out of\nthe little square; then like a hunted hare he still ran down the Rue St.\nHonore, along its narrow, interminable length. His hat had fallen from\nhis head, his hair was wild all round his face, the rain weighted the\ncloak upon his shoulders; but still he ran.\n\nHis feet made no noise on the muddy pavement. He ran on and on, his\nelbows pressed to his sides, panting, quivering, intent but upon one\nthing--the goal which he had set himself to reach.\n\nJeanne was arrested. He did not know where to look for her, but he did\nknow whither he wanted to go now as swiftly as his legs would carry him.\n\nIt was still dark, but Armand St. Just was a born Parisian, and he knew\nevery inch of this quarter, where he and Marguerite had years ago lived.\nDown the Rue St. Honore, he had reached the bottom of the interminably\nlong street at last. He had kept just a sufficiency of reason--or was it\nmerely blind instinct?--to avoid the places where the night patrols\nof the National Guard might be on the watch. He avoided the Place du\nCarrousel, also the quay, and struck sharply to his right until he\nreached the facade of St. Germain l'Auxerrois.\n\nAnother effort; round the corner, and there was the house at last.\nHe was like the hunted creature now that has run to earth. Up the two\nflights of stone stairs, and then the pull at the bell; a moment of\ntense anxiety, whilst panting, gasping, almost choked with the sustained\neffort and the strain of the past half-hour, he leaned against the wall,\nstriving not to fall.\n\nThen the well-known firm step across the rooms beyond, the open door,\nthe hand upon his shoulder.\n\nAfter that he remembered nothing more.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. THE CHIEF\n\nHe had not actually fainted, but the exertion of that long run had\nrendered him partially unconscious. He knew now that he was safe, that he\nwas sitting in Blakeney's room, and that something hot and vivifying was\nbeing poured down his throat.\n\n\"Percy, they have arrested her!\" he said, panting, as soon as speech\nreturned to his paralysed tongue.\n\n\"All right. Don't talk now. Wait till you are better.\"\n\nWith infinite care and gentleness Blakeney arranged some cushions under\nArmand's head, turned the sofa towards the fire, and anon brought his\nfriend a cup of hot coffee, which the latter drank with avidity.\n\nHe was really too exhausted to speak. He had contrived to tell Blakeney,\nand now Blakeney knew, so everything would be all right. The inevitable\nreaction was asserting itself; the muscles had relaxed, the nerves were\nnumbed, and Armand lay back on the sofa with eyes half closed, unable to\nmove, yet feeling his strength gradually returning to him, his vitality\nasserting itself, all the feverish excitement of the past twenty-four\nhours yielding at last to a calmer mood.\n\nThrough his half-closed eyes he could see his brother-in-law moving\nabout the room. Blakeney was fully dressed. In a sleepy kind of way\nArmand wondered if he had been to bed at all; certainly his clothes\nset on him with their usual well-tailored perfection, and there was no\nsuggestion in his brisk step and alert movements that he had passed a\nsleepless night.\n\nNow he was standing by the open window. Armand, from where he lay, could\nsee his broad shoulders sharply outlined against the grey background\nof the hazy winter dawn. A wan light was just creeping up from the\neast over the city; the noises of the streets below came distinctly to\nArmand's ear.\n\nHe roused himself with one vigorous effort from his lethargy, feeling\nquite ashamed of himself and of this breakdown of his nervous system.\nHe looked with frank admiration on Sir Percy, who stood immovable and\nsilent by the window--a perfect tower of strength, serene and impassive,\nyet kindly in distress.\n\n\"Percy,\" said the young man, \"I ran all the way from the top of the Rue\nSt. Honore. I was only breathless. I am quite all right. May I tell you\nall about it?\"\n\nWithout a word Blakeney closed the window and came across to the sofa;\nhe sat down beside Armand, and to all outward appearances he was nothing\nnow but a kind and sympathetic listener to a friend's tale of woe. Not\na line in his face or a look in his eyes betrayed the thoughts of the\nleader who had been thwarted at the outset of a dangerous enterprise, or\nof the man, accustomed to command, who had been so flagrantly disobeyed.\n\nArmand, unconscious of all save of Jeanne and of her immediate need, put\nan eager hand on Percy's arm.\n\n\"Heron and his hell-hounds went back to her lodgings last night,\" he\nsaid, speaking as if he were still a little out of breath. \"They hoped\nto get me, no doubt; not finding me there, they took her. Oh, my God!\"\n\nIt was the first time that he had put the whole terrible circumstance\ninto words, and it seemed to gain in reality by the recounting. The\nagony of mind which he endured was almost unbearable; he hid his face in\nhis hands lest Percy should see how terribly he suffered.\n\n\"I knew that,\" said Blakeney quietly. Armand looked up in surprise.\n\n\"How? When did you know it?\" he stammered.\n\n\"Last night when you left me. I went down to the Square du Roule. I\narrived there just too late.\"\n\n\"Percy!\" exclaimed Armand, whose pale face had suddenly flushed scarlet,\n\"you did that?--last night you--\"\n\n\"Of course,\" interposed the other calmly; \"had I not promised you to\nkeep watch over her? When I heard the news it was already too late to\nmake further inquiries, but when you arrived just now I was on the point\nof starting out, in order to find out in what prison Mademoiselle Lange\nis being detained. I shall have to go soon, Armand, before the guard is\nchanged at the Temple and the Tuileries. This is the safest time, and\nGod knows we are all of us sufficiently compromised already.\"\n\nThe flush of shame deepened in St. Just's cheek. There had not been a\nhint of reproach in the voice of his chief, and the eyes which regarded\nhim now from beneath the half-closed lids showed nothing but lazy\nbonhomie.\n\nIn a moment now Armand realised all the harm which his recklessness\nhad done, was still doing to the work of the League. Every one of his\nactions since his arrival in Paris two days ago had jeopardised a plan\nor endangered a life: his friendship with de Batz, his connection with\nMademoiselle Lange, his visit to her yesterday afternoon, the repetition\nof it this morning, culminating in that wild run through the streets of\nParis, when at any moment a spy lurking round a corner might either have\nbarred his way, or, worse still, have followed him to Blakeney's door.\nArmand, without a thought of any one save of his beloved, might easily\nthis morning have brought an agent of the Committee of General Security\nface to face with his chief.\n\n\"Percy,\" he murmured, \"can you ever forgive me?\"\n\n\"Pshaw, man!\" retorted Blakeney lightly; \"there is naught to forgive,\nonly a great deal that should no longer be forgotten; your duty to the\nothers, for instance, your obedience, and your honour.\"\n\n\"I was mad, Percy. Oh! if you only could understand what she means to\nme!\"\n\nBlakeney laughed, his own light-hearted careless laugh, which so often\nbefore now had helped to hide what he really felt from the eyes of the\nindifferent, and even from those of his friends.\n\n\"No! no!\" he said lightly, \"we agreed last night, did we not? that in\nmatters of sentiment I am a cold-blooded fish. But will you at any rate\nconcede that I am a man of my word? Did I not pledge it last night that\nMademoiselle Lange would be safe? I foresaw her arrest the moment I\nheard your story. I hoped that I might reach her before that brute\nHeron's return; unfortunately he forestalled me by less than half an\nhour. Mademoiselle Lange has been arrested, Armand; but why should you\nnot trust me on that account? Have we not succeeded, I and the others,\nin worse cases than this one? They mean no harm to Jeanne Lange,\" he\nadded emphatically; \"I give you my word on that. They only want her as\na decoy. It is you they want. You through her, and me through you. I\npledge you my honour that she will be safe. You must try and trust me,\nArmand. It is much to ask, I know, for you will have to trust me with\nwhat is most precious in the world to you; and you will have to obey me\nblindly, or I shall not be able to keep my word.\"\n\n\"What do you wish me to do?\"\n\n\"Firstly, you must be outside Paris within the hour. Every minute that\nyou spend inside the city now is full of danger--oh, no! not for you,\"\nadded Blakeney, checking with a good-humoured gesture Armand's words of\nprotestation, \"danger for the others--and for our scheme tomorrow.\"\n\n\"How can I go to St. Germain, Percy, knowing that she--\"\n\n\"Is under my charge?\" interposed the other calmly. \"That should not be\nso very difficult. Come,\" he added, placing a kindly hand on the other's\nshoulder, \"you shall not find me such an inhuman monster after all. But\nI must think of the others, you see, and of the child whom I have sworn\nto save. But I won't send you as far as St. Germain. Go down to the room\nbelow and find a good bundle of rough clothes that will serve you as a\ndisguise, for I imagine that you have lost those which you had on the\nlanding or the stairs of the house in the Square du Roule. In a tin box\nwith the clothes downstairs you will find the packet of miscellaneous\ncertificates of safety. Take an appropriate one, and then start out\nimmediately for Villette. You understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" said Armand eagerly. \"You want me to join Ffoulkes and\nTony.\"\n\n\"Yes! You'll find them probably unloading coal by the canal. Try and get\nprivate speech with them as early as may be, and tell Tony to set out at\nonce for St. Germain, and to join Hastings there, instead of you, whilst\nyou take his place with Ffoulkes.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand; but how will Tony reach St. Germain?\"\n\n\"La, my good fellow,\" said Blakeney gaily, \"you may safely trust Tony to\ngo where I send him. Do you but do as I tell you, and leave him to look\nafter himself. And now,\" he added, speaking more earnestly, \"the sooner\nyou get out of Paris the better it will be for us all. As you see, I am\nonly sending you to La Villette, because it is not so far, but that I\ncan keep in personal touch with you. Remain close to the gates for an\nhour after nightfall. I will contrive before they close to bring you\nnews of Mademoiselle Lange.\"\n\nArmand said no more. The sense of shame in him deepened with every\nword spoken by his chief. He felt how untrustworthy he had been, how\nundeserving of the selfless devotion which Percy was showing him even\nnow. The words of gratitude died on his lips; he knew that they would be\nunwelcome. These Englishmen were so devoid of sentiment, he thought,\nand his brother-in-law, with all his unselfish and heroic deeds, was, he\nfelt, absolutely callous in matters of the heart.\n\nBut Armand was a noble-minded man, and with the true sporting instinct\nin him, despite the fact that he was a creature of nerves, highly strung\nand imaginative. He could give ungrudging admiration to his chief, even\nwhilst giving himself up entirely to the sentiment for Jeanne.\n\nHe tried to imbue himself with the same spirit that actuated my Lord\nTony and the other members of the League. How gladly would he have\nchaffed and made senseless schoolboy jokes like those which--in face\nof their hazardous enterprise and the dangers which they all ran--had\nhorrified him so much last night.\n\nBut somehow he knew that jokes from him would not ring true. How could\nhe smile when his heart was brimming over with his love for Jeanne, and\nwith solicitude on her account? He felt that Percy was regarding him\nwith a kind of indulgent amusement; there was a look of suppressed\nmerriment in the depths of those lazy blue eyes.\n\nSo he braced up his nerves, trying his best to look cool and\nunconcerned, but he could not altogether hide from his friend the\nburning anxiety which was threatening to break his heart.\n\n\"I have given you my word, Armand,\" said Blakeney in answer to the\nunspoken prayer; \"cannot you try and trust me--as the others do? Then\nwith sudden transition he pointed to the map behind him.\n\n\"Remember the gate of Villette, and the corner by the towpath. Join\nFfoulkes as soon as may be and send Tony on his way, and wait for news\nof Mademoiselle Lange some time to-night.\"\n\n\"God bless you, Percy!\" said Armand involuntarily. \"Good-bye!\"\n\n\"Good-bye, my dear fellow. Slip on your disguise as quickly as you can,\nand be out of the house in a quarter of an hour.\"\n\nHe accompanied Armand through the ante-room, and finally closed the door\non him. Then he went back to his room and walked up to the window, which\nhe threw open to the humid morning air. Now that he was alone the look\nof trouble on his face deepened to a dark, anxious frown, and as\nhe looked out across the river a sigh of bitter impatience and\ndisappointment escaped his lips.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. THE GATE OF LA VILLETTE\n\nAnd now the shades of evening had long since yielded to those of night.\nThe gate of La Villette, at the northeast corner of the city, was about\nto close. Armand, dressed in the rough clothes of a labouring man, was\nleaning against a low wall at the angle of the narrow street which abuts\non the canal at its further end; from this point of vantage he could\ncommand a view of the gate and of the life and bustle around it.\n\nHe was dog-tired. After the emotions of the past twenty-four hours, a\nday's hard manual toil to which he was unaccustomed had caused him to\nache in every limb. As soon as he had arrived at the canal wharf in the\nearly morning he had obtained the kind of casual work that ruled about\nhere, and soon was told off to unload a cargo of coal which had arrived\nby barge overnight. He had set-to with a will, half hoping to kill\nhis anxiety by dint of heavy bodily exertion. During the course of the\nmorning he had suddenly become aware of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and of Lord\nAnthony Dewhurst working not far away from him, and as fine a pair of\ncoalheavers as any shipper could desire.\n\nIt was not very difficult in the midst of the noise and activity that\nreigned all about the wharf for the three men to exchange a few words\ntogether, and Armand soon communicated the chief's new instructions\nto my Lord Tony, who effectually slipped away from his work some time\nduring the day. Armand did not even see him go, it had all been so\nneatly done.\n\nJust before five o'clock in the afternoon the labourers were paid off.\nIt was then too dark to continue work. Armand would have liked to talk\nto Sir Andrew, if only for a moment. He felt lonely and desperately\nanxious. He had hoped to tire out his nerves as well as his body, but\nin this he had not succeeded. As soon as he had given up his tools, his\nbrain began to work again more busily than ever. It followed Percy in\nhis peregrinations through the city, trying to discover where those\nbrutes were keeping Jeanne.\n\nThat task had suddenly loomed up before Armand's mind with all its\nterrible difficulties. How could Percy--a marked man if ever there was\none--go from prison to prison to inquire about Jeanne? The very idea\nseemed preposterous. Armand ought never to have consented to such an\ninsensate plan. The more he thought of it, the more impossible did it\nseem that Blakeney could find anything out.\n\nSir Andrew Ffoulkes was nowhere to be seen. St. Just wandered about in\nthe dark, lonely streets of this outlying quarter vainly trying to find\nthe friend in whom he could confide, who, no doubt, would reassure\nhim as to Blakeney's probable movements in Paris. Then as the hour\napproached for the closing of the city gates Armand took up his stand\nat an angle of the street from whence he could see both the gate on one\nside of him and the thin line of the canal intersecting the street at\nits further end.\n\nUnless Percy came within the next five minutes the gates would be\nclosed and the difficulties of crossing the barrier would be increased a\nhundredfold. The market gardeners with their covered carts filed out\nof the gate one by one; the labourers on foot were returning to their\nhomes; there was a group of stonemasons, a few road-makers, also a\nnumber of beggars, ragged and filthy, who herded somewhere in the\nneighbourhood of the canal.\n\nIn every form, under every disguise, Armand hoped to discover Percy.\nHe could not stand still for very long, but strode up and down the road\nthat skirts the fortifications at this point.\n\nThere were a good many idlers about at this hour; some men who had\nfinished their work, and meant to spend an hour or so in one of the\ndrinking shops that abounded in the neighbourhood of the wharf; others\nwho liked to gather a small knot of listeners around them, whilst they\ndiscoursed on the politics of the day, or rather raged against the\nConvention, which was all made up of traitors to the people's welfare.\n\nArmand, trying manfully to play his part, joined one of the groups that\nstood gaping round a street orator. He shouted with the best of them,\nwaved his cap in the air, and applauded or hissed in unison with the\nmajority. But his eyes never wandered for long away from the gate whence\nPercy must come now at any moment--now or not at all.\n\nAt what precise moment the awful doubt took birth in his mind the young\nman could not afterwards have said. Perhaps it was when he heard the\nroll of drums proclaiming the closing of the gates, and witnessed the\nchanging of the guard.\n\nPercy had not come. He could not come now, and he (Armand) would have\nthe night to face without news of Jeanne. Something, of course, had\ndetained Percy; perhaps he had been unable to get definite information\nabout Jeanne; perhaps the information which he had obtained was too\nterrible to communicate.\n\nIf only Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had been there, and Armand had had some one\nto talk to, perhaps then he would have found sufficient strength of mind\nto wait with outward patience, even though his nerves were on the rack.\n\nDarkness closed in around him, and with the darkness came the full\nreturn of the phantoms that had assailed him in the house of the Square\ndu Roule when first he had heard of Jeanne's arrest. The open place\nfacing the gate had transformed itself into the Place de la Revolution,\nthe tall rough post that held a flickering oil lamp had become the gaunt\narm of the guillotine, the feeble light of the lamp was the knife that\ngleamed with the reflection of a crimson light.\n\nAnd Armand saw himself, as in a vision, one of a vast and noisy\nthrong--they were all pressing round him so that he could not move; they\nwere brandishing caps and tricolour flags, also pitchforks and scythes.\nHe had seen such a crowd four years ago rushing towards the Bastille.\nNow they were all assembled here around him and around the guillotine.\n\nSuddenly a distant rattle caught his subconscious ear: the rattle of\nwheels on rough cobble-stones. Immediately the crowd began to cheer and\nto shout; some sang the \"Ca ira!\" and others screamed:\n\n\"Les aristos! a la lanterne! a mort! a mort! les aristos!\"\n\nHe saw it all quite plainly, for the darkness had vanished, and the\nvision was more vivid than even reality could have been. The rattle of\nwheels grew louder, and presently the cart debouched on the open place.\n\nMen and women sat huddled up in the cart; but in the midst of them a\nwoman stood, and her eyes were fixed upon Armand. She wore her pale-grey\nsatin gown, and a white kerchief was folded across her bosom. Her brown\nhair fell in loose soft curls all round her head. She looked exactly\nlike the exquisite cameo which Marguerite used to wear. Her hands were\ntied with cords behind her back, but between her fingers she held a\nsmall bunch of violets.\n\nArmand saw it all. It was, of course, a vision, and he knew that it was\none, but he believed that the vision was prophetic. No thought of the\nchief whom he had sworn to trust and to obey came to chase away these\nimaginings of his fevered fancy. He saw Jeanne, and only Jeanne,\nstanding on the tumbril and being led to the guillotine. Sir Andrew was\nnot there, and Percy had not come. Armand believed that a direct message\nhad come to him from heaven to save his beloved.\n\nTherefore he forgot his promise--his oath; he forgot those very things\nwhich the leader had entreated him to remember--his duty to the others,\nhis loyalty, his obedience. Jeanne had first claim on him. It were\nthe act of a coward to remain in safety whilst she was in such deadly\ndanger.\n\nNow he blamed himself severely for having quitted Paris. Even Percy\nmust have thought him a coward for obeying quite so readily. Maybe the\ncommand had been but a test of his courage, of the strength of his love\nfor Jeanne.\n\nA hundred conjectures flashed through his brain; a hundred plans\npresented themselves to his mind. It was not for Percy, who did not\nknow her, to save Jeanne or to guard her. That task was Armand's, who\nworshipped her, and who would gladly die beside her if he failed to\nrescue her from threatened death.\n\nResolution was not slow in coming. A tower clock inside the city struck\nthe hour of six, and still no sign of Percy.\n\nArmand, his certificate of safety in his hand, walked boldly up to the\ngate.\n\nThe guard challenged him, but he presented the certificate. There was an\nagonising moment when the card was taken from him, and he was detained\nin the guard-room while it was being examined by the sergeant in\ncommand.\n\nBut the certificate was in good order, and Armand, covered in coal-dust,\nwith the perspiration streaming down his face, did certainly not look\nlike an aristocrat in disguise. It was never very difficult to enter the\ngreat city; if one wished to put one's head in the lion's mouth, one was\nwelcome to do so; the difficulty came when the lion thought fit to close\nhis jaws.\n\nArmand, after five minutes of tense anxiety, was allowed to cross the\nbarrier, but his certificate of safety was detained. He would have to\nget another from the Committee of General Security before he would be\nallowed to leave Paris again.\n\nThe lion had thought fit to close his jaws.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. THE WEARY SEARCH\n\nBlakeney was not at his lodgings when Armand arrived there that evening,\nnor did he return, whilst the young man haunted the precincts of St.\nGermain l'Auxerrois and wandered along the quays hours and hours at\na stretch, until he nearly dropped under the portico of a house,\nand realised that if he loitered longer he might lose consciousness\ncompletely, and be unable on the morrow to be of service to Jeanne.\n\nHe dragged his weary footsteps back to his own lodgings on the heights\nof Montmartre. He had not found Percy, he had no news of Jeanne;\nit seemed as if hell itself could hold no worse tortures than this\nintolerable suspense.\n\nHe threw himself down on the narrow palliasse and, tired nature\nasserting herself, at last fell into a heavy, dreamless torpor, like the\nsleep of a drunkard, deep but without the beneficent aid of rest.\n\nIt was broad daylight when he awoke. The pale light of a damp, wintry\nmorning filtered through the grimy panes of the window. Armand jumped\nout of bed, aching of limb but resolute of mind. There was no doubt that\nPercy had failed in discovering Jeanne's whereabouts; but where a mere\nfriend had failed a lover was more likely to succeed.\n\nThe rough clothes which he had worn yesterday were the only ones he had.\nThey would, of course, serve his purpose better than his own, which\nhe had left at Blakeney's lodgings yesterday. In half an hour he was\ndressed, looking a fairly good imitation of a labourer out of work.\n\nHe went to a humble eating house of which he knew, and there, having\nordered some hot coffee with a hunk of bread, he set himself to think.\n\nIt was quite a usual thing these days for relatives and friends of\nprisoners to go wandering about from prison to prison to find out where\nthe loved ones happened to be detained. The prisons were over full\njust now; convents, monasteries, and public institutions had all been\nrequisitioned by the Government for the housing of the hundreds of\nso-called traitors who had been arrested on the barest suspicion, or at\nthe mere denunciation of an evil-wisher.\n\nThere were the Abbaye and the Luxembourg, the erstwhile convents of\nthe Visitation and the Sacre-Coeur, the cloister of the Oratorians, the\nSalpetriere, and the St. Lazare hospitals, and there was, of course,\nthe Temple, and, lastly, the Conciergerie, to which those prisoners were\nbrought whose trial would take place within the next few days, and whose\ncondemnation was practically assured.\n\nPersons under arrest at some of the other prisons did sometimes come\nout of them alive, but the Conciergerie was only the ante-chamber of the\nguillotine.\n\nTherefore Armand's idea was to visit the Conciergerie first. The sooner\nhe could reassure himself that Jeanne was not in immediate danger the\nbetter would he be able to endure the agony of that heart-breaking\nsearch, that knocking at every door in the hope of finding his beloved.\n\nIf Jeanne was not in the Conciergerie, then there might be some hope\nthat she was only being temporarily detained, and through Armand's\nexcited brain there had already flashed the thought that mayhap the\nCommittee of General Security would release her if he gave himself up.\n\nThese thoughts, and the making of plans, fortified him mentally and\nphysically; he even made a great effort to eat and drink, knowing that\nhis bodily strength must endure if it was going to be of service to\nJeanne.\n\nHe reached the Quai de l'Horloge soon after nine. The grim, irregular\nwalls of the Chatelet and the house of Justice loomed from out the\nmantle of mist that lay on the river banks. Armand skirted the square\nclock-tower, and passed through the monumental gateways of the house of\nJustice.\n\nHe knew that his best way to the prison would be through the halls and\ncorridors of the Tribunal, to which the public had access whenever the\ncourt was sitting. The sittings began at ten, and already the usual\ncrowd of idlers were assembling--men and women who apparently had no\nother occupation save to come day after day to this theatre of horrors\nand watch the different acts of the heartrending dramas that were\nenacted here with a kind of awful monotony.\n\nArmand mingled with the crowd that stood about the courtyard, and anon\nmoved slowly up the gigantic flight of stone steps, talking lightly on\nindifferent subjects. There was quite a goodly sprinkling of workingmen\namongst this crowd, and Armand in his toil-stained clothes attracted no\nattention.\n\nSuddenly a word reached his ear--just a name flippantly spoken by\nspiteful lips--and it changed the whole trend of his thoughts. Since he\nhad risen that morning he had thought of nothing but of Jeanne, and--in\nconnection with her--of Percy and his vain quest of her. Now that\nname spoken by some one unknown brought his mind back to more definite\nthoughts of his chief.\n\n\"Capet!\" the name--intended as an insult, but actually merely\nirrelevant--whereby the uncrowned little King of France was designated\nby the revolutionary party.\n\nArmand suddenly recollected that to-day was Sunday, the 19th of January.\nHe had lost count of days and of dates lately, but the name, \"Capet,\"\nhad brought everything back: the child in the Temple; the conference in\nBlakeney's lodgings; the plans for the rescue of the boy. That was to\ntake place to-day--Sunday, the 19th. The Simons would be moving from the\nTemple, at what hour Blakeney did not know, but it would be today, and\nhe would be watching his opportunity.\n\nNow Armand understood everything; a great wave of bitterness swept over\nhis soul. Percy had forgotten Jeanne! He was busy thinking of the child\nin the Temple, and whilst Armand had been eating out his heart with\nanxiety, the Scarlet Pimpernel, true only to his mission, and impatient\nof all sentiment that interfered with his schemes, had left Jeanne to\npay with her life for the safety of the uncrowned King.\n\nBut the bitterness did not last long; on the contrary, a kind of wild\nexultation took its place. If Percy had forgotten, then Armand could\nstand by Jeanne alone. It was better so! He would save the loved one; it\nwas his duty and his right to work for her sake. Never for a moment did\nhe doubt that he could save her, that his life would be readily accepted\nin exchange for hers.\n\nThe crowd around him was moving up the monumental steps, and Armand went\nwith the crowd. It lacked but a few minutes to ten now; soon the court\nwould begin to sit. In the olden days, when he was studying for the law,\nArmand had often wandered about at will along the corridors of the house\nof Justice. He knew exactly where the different prisons were situated\nabout the buildings, and how to reach the courtyards where the prisoners\ntook their daily exercise.\n\nTo watch those aristos who were awaiting trial and death taking their\nrecreation in these courtyards had become one of the sights of\nParis. Country cousins on a visit to the city were brought hither\nfor entertainment. Tall iron gates stood between the public and the\nprisoners, and a row of sentinels guarded these gates; but if one was\nenterprising and eager to see, one could glue one's nose against the\nironwork and watch the ci-devant aristocrats in threadbare\nclothes trying to cheat their horror of death by acting a farce of\nlight-heartedness which their wan faces and tear-dimmed eyes effectually\nbelied.\n\nAll this Armand knew, and on this he counted. For a little while he\njoined the crowd in the Salle des Pas Perdus, and wandered idly up and\ndown the majestic colonnaded hall. He even at one time formed part of\nthe throng that watched one of those quick tragedies that were enacted\nwithin the great chamber of the court. A number of prisoners brought\nin, in a batch; hurried interrogations, interrupted answers, a\nquick indictment, monstrous in its flaring injustice, spoken by\nFoucquier-Tinville, the public prosecutor, and listened to in all\nseriousness by men who dared to call themselves judges of their fellows.\n\nThe accused had walked down the Champs Elysees without wearing a\ntricolour cockade; the other had invested some savings in an English\nindustrial enterprise; yet another had sold public funds, causing them\nto depreciate rather suddenly in the market!\n\nSometimes from one of these unfortunates led thus wantonly to butchery\nthere would come an excited protest, or from a woman screams of agonised\nentreaty. But these were quickly silenced by rough blows from the\nbutt-ends of muskets, and condemnations--wholesale sentences of\ndeath--were quickly passed amidst the cheers of the spectators and the\nhowls of derision from infamous jury and judge.\n\nOh! the mockery of it all--the awful, the hideous ignominy, the blot\nof shame that would forever sully the historic name of France. Armand,\nsickened with horror, could not bear more than a few minutes of this\nmonstrous spectacle. The same fate might even now be awaiting Jeanne.\nAmong the next batch of victims to this sacrilegious butchery he might\nsuddenly spy his beloved with her pale face and cheeks stained with her\ntears.\n\nHe fled from the great chamber, keeping just a sufficiency of presence\nof mind to join a knot of idlers who were drifting leisurely towards the\ncorridors. He followed in their wake and soon found himself in the long\nGalerie des Prisonniers, along the flagstones of which two days ago de\nBatz had followed his guide towards the lodgings of Heron.\n\nOn his left now were the arcades shut off from the courtyard beyond by\nheavy iron gates. Through the ironwork Armand caught sight of a number\nof women walking or sitting in the courtyard. He heard a man next to him\nexplaining to his friend that these were the female prisoners who would\nbe brought to trial that day, and he felt that his heart must burst at\nthe thought that mayhap Jeanne would be among them.\n\nHe elbowed his way cautiously to the front rank. Soon he found himself\nbeside a sentinel who, with a good-humoured jest, made way for him that\nhe might watch the aristos. Armand leaned against the grating, and his\nevery sense was concentrated in that of sight.\n\nAt first he could scarcely distinguish one woman from another amongst\nthe crowd that thronged the courtyard, and the close ironwork hindered\nhis view considerably. The women looked almost like phantoms in the grey\nmisty air, gliding slowly along with noiseless tread on the flag-stones.\n\nPresently, however, his eyes, which mayhap were somewhat dim with tears,\nbecame more accustomed to the hazy grey light and the moving figures\nthat looked so like shadows. He could distinguish isolated groups now,\nwomen and girls sitting together under the colonnaded arcades, some\nreading, others busy, with trembling fingers, patching and darning a\npoor, torn gown. Then there were others who were actually chatting and\nlaughing together, and--oh, the pity of it! the pity and the shame!--a\nfew children, shrieking with delight, were playing hide and seek in and\nout amongst the columns.\n\nAnd, between them all, in and out like the children at play, unseen, yet\nfamiliar to all, the spectre of Death, scythe and hour-glass in hand,\nwandered, majestic and sure.\n\nArmand's very soul was in his eyes. So far he had not yet caught sight\nof his beloved, and slowly--very slowly--a ray of hope was filtering\nthrough the darkness of his despair.\n\nThe sentinel, who had stood aside for him, chaffed him for his\nintentness.\n\n\"Have you a sweetheart among these aristos, citizen?\" he asked. \"You\nseem to be devouring them with your eyes.\"\n\nArmand, with his rough clothes soiled with coal-dust, his face grimy and\nstreaked with sweat, certainly looked to have but little in common\nwith the ci-devant aristos who formed the hulk of the groups in the\ncourtyard. He looked up; the soldier was regarding him with obvious\namusement, and at sight of Armand's wild, anxious eyes he gave vent to a\ncoarse jest.\n\n\"Have I made a shrewd guess, citizen?\" he said. \"Is she among that lot?\"\n\n\"I do not know where she is,\" said Armand almost involuntarily.\n\n\"Then why don't you find out?\" queried the soldier.\n\nThe man was not speaking altogether unkindly. Armand, devoured with the\nmaddening desire to know, threw the last fragment of prudence to the\nwind. He assumed a more careless air, trying to look as like a country\nbumpkin in love as he could.\n\n\"I would like to find out,\" he said, \"but I don't know where to inquire.\nMy sweetheart has certainly left her home,\" he added lightly; \"some say\nthat she has been false to me, but I think that, mayhap, she has been\narrested.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you gaby,\" said the soldier good-humouredly, \"go straight\nto La Tournelle; you know where it is?\"\n\nArmand knew well enough, but thought it more prudent to keep up the air\nof the ignorant lout.\n\n\"Straight down that first corridor on your right,\" explained the other,\npointing in the direction which he had indicated, \"you will find the\nguichet of La Tournelle exactly opposite to you. Ask the concierge for\nthe register of female prisoners--every freeborn citizen of the Republic\nhas the right to inspect prison registers. It is a new decree framed for\nsafeguarding the liberty of the people. But if you do not press half a\nlivre in the hand of the concierge,\" he added, speaking confidentially,\n\"you will find that the register will not be quite ready for your\ninspection.\"\n\n\"Half a livre!\" exclaimed Armand, striving to play his part to the end.\n\"How can a poor devil of a labourer have half a livre to give away?\"\n\n\"Well! a few sous will do in that case; a few sous are always welcome\nthese hard times.\"\n\nArmand took the hint, and as the crowd had drifted away momentarily to\na further portion of the corridor, he contrived to press a few copper\ncoins into the hand of the obliging soldier.\n\nOf course, he knew his way to La Tournelle, and he would have covered\nthe distance that separated him from the guichet there with steps flying\nlike the wind, but, commending himself for his own prudence, he walked\nas slowly as he could along the interminable corridor, past the several\nminor courts of justice, and skirting the courtyard where the male\nprisoners took their exercise.\n\nAt last, having struck sharply to his left and ascended a short flight\nof stairs, he found himself in front of the guichet--a narrow wooden\nbox, wherein the clerk in charge of the prison registers sat nominally\nat the disposal of the citizens of this free republic.\n\nBut to Armand's almost overwhelming chagrin he found the place entirely\ndeserted. The guichet was closed down; there was not a soul in sight.\nThe disappointment was doubly keen, coming as it did in the wake of\nhope that had refused to be gainsaid. Armand himself did not realise\nhow sanguine he had been until he discovered that he must wait and wait\nagain--wait for hours, all day mayhap, before he could get definite news\nof Jeanne.\n\nHe wandered aimlessly in the vicinity of that silent, deserted, cruel\nspot, where a closed trapdoor seemed to shut off all his hopes of a\nspeedy sight of Jeanne. He inquired of the first sentinels whom he came\nacross at what hour the clerk of the registers would be back at\nhis post; the soldiers shrugged their shoulders and could give no\ninformation. Then began Armand's aimless wanderings round La Tournelle,\nhis fruitless inquiries, his wild, excited search for the hide-bound\nofficial who was keeping from him the knowledge of Jeanne.\n\nHe went back to his sentinel well-wisher by the women's courtyard, but\nfound neither consolation nor encouragement there.\n\n\"It is not the hour--quoi?\" the soldier remarked with laconic\nphilosophy.\n\nIt apparently was not the hour when the prison registers were placed at\nthe disposal of the public. After much fruitless inquiry, Armand at last\nwas informed by a bon bourgeois, who was wandering about the house of\nJustice and who seemed to know its multifarious rules, that the prison\nregisters all over Paris could only be consulted by the public between\nthe hours of six and seven in the evening.\n\nThere was nothing for it but to wait. Armand, whose temples were\nthrobbing, who was footsore, hungry, and wretched, could gain nothing by\ncontinuing his aimless wanderings through the labyrinthine building.\nFor close upon another hour he stood with his face glued against the\nironwork which separated him from the female prisoners' courtyard. Once\nit seemed to him as if from its further end he caught the sound of that\nexquisitely melodious voice which had rung forever in his ear since that\nmemorable evening when Jeanne's dainty footsteps had first crossed\nthe path of his destiny. He strained his eyes to look in the direction\nwhence the voice had come, but the centre of the courtyard was planted\nwith a small garden of shrubs, and Armand could not see across it. At\nlast, driven forth like a wandering and lost soul, he turned back and\nout into the streets. The air was mild and damp. The sharp thaw had\npersisted through the day, and a thin, misty rain was falling and\nconverting the ill-paved roads into seas of mud.\n\nBut of this Armand was wholly unconscious. He walked along the quay\nholding his cap in his hand, so that the mild south wind should cool his\nburning forehead.\n\nHow he contrived to kill those long, weary hours he could not afterwards\nhave said. Once he felt very hungry, and turned almost mechanically\ninto an eating-house, and tried to eat and drink. But most of the day he\nwandered through the streets, restlessly, unceasingly, feeling neither\nchill nor fatigue. The hour before six o'clock found him on the Quai\nde l'Horloge in the shadow of the great towers of the Hall of Justice,\nlistening for the clang of the clock that would sound the hour of his\ndeliverance from this agonising torture of suspense.\n\nHe found his way to La Tournelle without any hesitation. There before\nhim was the wooden box, with its guichet open at last, and two stands\nupon its ledge, on which were placed two huge leather-bound books.\n\nThough Armand was nearly an hour before the appointed time, he saw when\nhe arrived a number of people standing round the guichet. Two soldiers\nwere there keeping guard and forcing the patient, long-suffering\ninquirers to stand in a queue, each waiting his or her turn at the\nbooks.\n\nIt was a curious crowd that stood there, in single file, as if waiting\nat the door of the cheaper part of a theatre; men in substantial cloth\nclothes, and others in ragged blouse and breeches; there were a few\nwomen, too, with black shawls on their shoulders and kerchiefs round\ntheir wan, tear-stained faces.\n\nThey were all silent and absorbed, submissive under the rough handling\nof the soldiery, humble and deferential when anon the clerk of the\nregisters entered his box, and prepared to place those fateful books at\nthe disposal of those who had lost a loved one--father, brother, mother,\nor wife--and had come to search through those cruel pages.\n\nFrom inside his box the clerk disputed every inquirer's right to consult\nthe books; he made as many difficulties as he could, demanding the\nproduction of certificates of safety, or permits from the section. He\nwas as insolent as he dared, and Armand from where he stood could see\nthat a continuous if somewhat thin stream of coppers flowed from the\nhands of the inquirers into those of the official.\n\nIt was quite dark in the passage where the long queue continued to swell\nwith amazing rapidity. Only on the ledge in front of the guichet there\nwas a guttering tallow candle at the disposal of the inquirers.\n\nNow it was Armand's turn at last. By this time his heart was beating so\nstrongly and so rapidly that he could not have trusted himself to speak.\nHe fumbled in his pocket, and without unnecessary preliminaries he\nproduced a small piece of silver, and pushed it towards the clerk, then\nhe seized on the register marked \"Femmes\" with voracious avidity.\n\nThe clerk had with stolid indifference pocketed the half-livre; he\nlooked on Armand over a pair of large bone-rimmed spectacles, with the\nair of an old hawk that sees a helpless bird and yet is too satiated to\neat. He was apparently vastly amused at Armand's trembling hands, and\nthe clumsy, aimless way with which he fingered the book and held up the\ntallow candle.\n\n\"What date?\" he asked curtly in a piping voice.\n\n\"What date?\" reiterated Armand vaguely.\n\n\"What day and hour was she arrested?\" said the man, thrusting his\nbeak-like nose closer to Armand's face. Evidently the piece of silver\nhad done its work well; he meant to be helpful to this country lout.\n\n\"On Friday evening,\" murmured the young man.\n\nThe clerk's hands did not in character gainsay the rest of his\nappearance; they were long and thin, with nails that resembled the\ntalons of a hawk. Armand watched them fascinated as from above they\nturned over rapidly the pages of the book; then one long, grimy finger\npointed to a row of names down a column.\n\n\"If she is here,\" said the man curtly, \"her name should be amongst\nthese.\"\n\nArmand's vision was blurred. He could scarcely see. The row of names was\ndancing a wild dance in front of his eyes; perspiration stood out on his\nforehead, and his breath came in quick, stertorous gasps.\n\nHe never knew afterwards whether he actually saw Jeanne's name there in\nthe book, or whether his fevered brain was playing his aching senses a\ncruel and mocking trick. Certain it is that suddenly amongst a row of\nindifferent names hers suddenly stood clearly on the page, and to him it\nseemed as if the letters were writ out in blood.\n\n     582.  Belhomme, Louise, aged sixty.  Discharged.\n\nAnd just below, the other entry:\n\n     583. Lange, Jeanne, aged twenty, actress. Square du Roule\n     No.5.  Suspected of harbouring traitors and ci-devants.\n     Transferred 29th Nivose to the Temple, cell 29.\n\nHe saw nothing more, for suddenly it seemed to him as if some one held\na vivid scarlet veil in front of his eyes, whilst a hundred claw-like\nhands were tearing at his heart and at his throat.\n\n\"Clear out now! it is my turn--what? Are you going to stand there all\nnight?\"\n\nA rough voice seemed to be speaking these words; rough hands apparently\nwere pushing him out of the way, and some one snatched the candle out\nof his hand; but nothing was real. He stumbled over a corner of a loose\nflagstone, and would have fallen, but something seemed to catch bold of\nhim and to lead him away for a little distance, until a breath of cold\nair blew upon his face.\n\nThis brought him back to his senses.\n\nJeanne was a prisoner in the Temple; then his place was in the prison of\nthe Temple, too. It could not be very difficult to run one's head into\nthe noose that caught so many necks these days. A few cries of \"Vive le\nroi!\" or \"A bas la republique!\" and more than one prison door would gape\ninvitingly to receive another guest.\n\nThe hot blood had rushed into Armand's head. He did not see clearly\nbefore him, nor did he hear distinctly. There was a buzzing in his ears\nas of myriads of mocking birds' wings, and there was a veil in front\nof his eyes--a veil through which he saw faces and forms flitting\nghost-like in the gloom, men and women jostling or being jostled,\nsoldiers, sentinels; then long, interminable corridors, more crowd and\nmore soldiers, winding stairs, courtyards and gates; finally the open\nstreet, the quay, and the river beyond.\n\nAn incessant hammering went on in his temples, and that veil never\nlifted from before his eyes. Now it was lurid and red, as if stained\nwith blood; anon it was white like a shroud but it was always there.\n\nThrough it he saw the Pont-au-Change, which he crossed, then far down\non the Quai de l'Ecole to the left the corner house behind St. Germain\nl'Auxerrois, where Blakeney lodged--Blakeney, who for the sake of a\nstranger had forgotten all about his comrade and Jeanne.\n\nThrough it he saw the network of streets which separated him from the\nneighbourhood of the Temple, the gardens of ruined habitations, the\nclosely-shuttered and barred windows of ducal houses, then the mean\nstreets, the crowded drinking bars, the tumble-down shops with their\ndilapidated awnings.\n\nHe saw with eyes that did not see, heard the tumult of daily life round\nhim with ears that did not hear. Jeanne was in the Temple prison,\nand when its grim gates closed finally for the night, he--Armand, her\nchevalier, her lover, her defender--would be within its walls as near to\ncell No. 29 as bribery, entreaty, promises would help him to attain.\n\nAh! there at last loomed the great building, the pointed bastions cut\nthrough the surrounding gloom as with a sable knife.\n\nArmand reached the gate; the sentinels challenged him; he replied:\n\n\"Vive le roi!\" shouting wildly like one who is drunk.\n\nHe was hatless, and his clothes were saturated with moisture. He tried\nto pass, but crossed bayonets barred the way. Still he shouted:\n\n\"Vive le roi!\" and \"A bas la republique!\"\n\n\"Allons! the fellow is drunk!\" said one of the soldiers.\n\nArmand fought like a madman; he wanted to reach that gate. He shouted,\nhe laughed, and he cried, until one of the soldiers in a fit of rage\nstruck him heavily on the head.\n\nArmand fell backwards, stunned by the blow; his foot slipped on the wet\npavement. Was he indeed drunk, or was he dreaming? He put his hand up to\nhis forehead; it was wet, but whether with the rain or with blood he\ndid not know; but for the space of one second he tried to collect his\nscattered wits.\n\n\"Citizen St. Just!\" said a quiet voice at his elbow.\n\nThen, as he looked round dazed, feeling a firm, pleasant grip on his\narm, the same quiet voice continued calmly:\n\n\"Perhaps you do not remember me, citizen St. Just. I had not the honour\nof the same close friendship with you as I had with your charming\nsister. My name is Chauvelin. Can I be of any service to you?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. CHAUVELIN\n\nChauvelin! The presence of this man here at this moment made the events\nof the past few days seem more absolutely like a dream. Chauvelin!--the\nmost deadly enemy he, Armand, and his sister Marguerite had in the\nworld. Chauvelin!--the evil genius that presided over the Secret Service\nof the Republic. Chauvelin--the aristocrat turned revolutionary, the\ndiplomat turned spy, the baffled enemy of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nHe stood there vaguely outlined in the gloom by the feeble rays of\nan oil lamp fixed into the wall just above. The moisture on his sable\nclothes glistened in the flickering light like a thin veil of crystal;\nit clung to the rim of his hat, to the folds of his cloak; the ruffles\nat his throat and wrist hung limp and soiled.\n\nHe had released Armand's arm, and held his hands now underneath his\ncloak; his pale, deep-set eyes rested gravely on the younger man's face.\n\n\"I had an idea, somehow,\" continued Chauvelin calmly, \"that you and I\nwould meet during your sojourn in Paris. I heard from my friend Heron\nthat you had been in the city; he, unfortunately, lost your track almost\nas soon as he had found it, and I, too, had begun to fear that our\nmutual and ever enigmatical friend, the Scarlet Pimpernel, had spirited\nyou away, which would have been a great disappointment to me.\"\n\nNow he once more took hold of Armand by the elbow, but quite gently,\nmore like a comrade who is glad to have met another, and is preparing\nto enjoy a pleasant conversation for a while. He led the way back to the\ngate, the sentinel saluting at sight of the tricolour scarf which was\nvisible underneath his cloak. Under the stone rampart Chauvelin paused.\n\nIt was quiet and private here. The group of soldiers stood at the\nfurther end of the archway, but they were out of hearing, and their\nforms were only vaguely discernible in the surrounding darkness.\n\nArmand had followed his enemy mechanically like one bewitched and\nirresponsible for his actions. When Chauvelin paused he too stood still,\nnot because of the grip on his arm, but because of that curious numbing\nof his will.\n\nVague, confused thoughts were floating through his brain, the most\ndominant one among them being that Fate had effectually ordained\neverything for the best. Here was Chauvelin, a man who hated him, who,\nof course, would wish to see him dead. Well, surely it must be an easier\nmatter now to barter his own life for that of Jeanne; she had only been\narrested on suspicion of harbouring him, who was a known traitor to the\nRepublic; then, with his capture and speedy death, her supposed guilt\nwould, he hoped, be forgiven. These people could have no ill-will\nagainst her, and actors and actresses were always leniently dealt with\nwhen possible. Then surely, surely, he could serve Jeanne best by his\nown arrest and condemnation, than by working to rescue her from prison.\n\nIn the meanwhile Chauvelin shook the damp from off his cloak, talking\nall the time in his own peculiar, gently ironical manner.\n\n\"Lady Blakeney?\" he was saying--\"I hope that she is well!\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir,\" murmured Armand mechanically.\n\n\"And my dear friend, Sir Percy Blakeney? I had hoped to meet him in\nParis. Ah! but no doubt he has been busy very busy; but I live in\nhopes--I live in hopes. See how kindly Chance has treated me,\" he\ncontinued in the same bland and mocking tones. \"I was taking a stroll\nin these parts, scarce hoping to meet a friend, when, passing the\npostern-gate of this charming hostelry, whom should I see but my amiable\nfriend St. Just striving to gain admission. But, la! here am I talking\nof myself, and I am not re-assured as to your state of health. You felt\nfaint just now, did you not? The air about this building is very dank\nand close. I hope you feel better now. Command me, pray, if I can be of\nservice to you in any way.\"\n\nWhilst Chauvelin talked he had drawn Armand after him into the lodge\nof the concierge. The young man now made a great effort to pull himself\nvigorously together and to steady his nerves.\n\nHe had his wish. He was inside the Temple prison now, not far from\nJeanne, and though his enemy was older and less vigorous than himself,\nand the door of the concierge's lodge stood wide open, he knew that he\nwas in-deed as effectually a prisoner already as if the door of one of\nthe numerous cells in this gigantic building had been bolted and barred\nupon him.\n\nThis knowledge helped him to recover his complete presence of mind. No\nthought of fighting or trying to escape his fate entered his head for a\nmoment. It had been useless probably, and undoubtedly it was better so.\nIf he only could see Jeanne, and assure himself that she would be safe\nin consequence of his own arrest, then, indeed, life could hold no\ngreater happiness for him.\n\nAbove all now he wanted to be cool and calculating, to curb the\nexcitement which the Latin blood in him called forth at every mention of\nthe loved one's name. He tried to think of Percy, of his calmness, his\neasy banter with an enemy; he resolved to act as Percy would act under\nthese circumstances.\n\nFirstly, he steadied his voice, and drew his well-knit, slim figure\nupright. He called to mind all his friends in England, with their rigid\nmanners, their impassiveness in the face of trying situations. There was\nLord Tony, for instance, always ready with some boyish joke, with boyish\nimpertinence always hovering on his tongue. Armand tried to emulate Lord\nTony's manner, and to borrow something of Percy's calm impudence.\n\n\"Citizen Chauvelin,\" he said, as soon as he felt quite sure of the\nsteadiness of his voice and the calmness of his manner, \"I wonder if\nyou are quite certain that that light grip which you have on my arm\nis sufficient to keep me here walking quietly by your side instead\nof knocking you down, as I certainly feel inclined to do, for I am a\nyounger, more vigorous man than you.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said Chauvelin, who made pretence to ponder over this difficult\nproblem; \"like you, citizen St. Just, I wonder--\"\n\n\"It could easily be done, you know.\"\n\n\"Fairly easily,\" rejoined the other; \"but there is the guard; it is\nnumerous and strong in this building, and--\"\n\n\"The gloom would help me; it is dark in the corridors, and a desperate\nman takes risks, remember--\"\n\n\"Quite so! And you, citizen St. Just, are a desperate man just now.\"\n\n\"My sister Marguerite is not here, citizen Chauvelin. You cannot barter\nmy life for that of your enemy.\"\n\n\"No! no! no!\" rejoined Chauvelin blandly; \"not for that of my enemy, I\nknow, but--\"\n\nArmand caught at his words like a drowning man at a reed.\n\n\"For hers!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"For hers?\" queried the other with obvious puzzlement.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Lange,\" continued Armand with all the egoistic ardour\nof the lover who believes that the attention of the entire world is\nconcentrated upon his beloved.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Lange! You will set her free now that I am in your power.\"\n\nChauvelin smiled, his usual suave, enigmatical smile.\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" he said. \"Mademoiselle Lange. I had forgotten.\"\n\n\"Forgotten, man?--forgotten that those murderous dogs have arrested\nher?--the best, the purest, this vile, degraded country has ever\nproduced. She sheltered me one day just for an hour. I am a traitor to\nthe Republic--I own it. I'll make full confession; but she knew nothing\nof this. I deceived her; she is quite innocent, you understand? I'll\nmake full confession, but you must set her free.\"\n\nHe had gradually worked himself up again to a state of feverish\nexcitement. Through the darkness which hung about in this small room he\ntried to peer in Chauvelin's impassive face.\n\n\"Easy, easy, my young friend,\" said the other placidly; \"you seem to\nimagine that I have something to do with the arrest of the lady in whom\nyou take so deep an interest. You forget that now I am but a discredited\nservant of the Republic whom I failed to serve in her need. My life is\nonly granted me out of pity for my efforts, which were genuine if not\nsuccessful. I have no power to set any one free.\"\n\n\"Nor to arrest me now, in that case!\" retorted Armand.\n\nChauvelin paused a moment before he replied with a deprecating smile:\n\n\"Only to denounce you, perhaps. I am still an agent of the Committee of\nGeneral Security.\"\n\n\"Then all is for the best!\" exclaimed St. Just eagerly. \"You shall\ndenounce me to the Committee. They will be glad of my arrest, I assure\nyou. I have been a marked man for some time. I had intended to evade\narrest and to work for the rescue of Mademoiselle Lange; but I will\ngive up all thought of that--I will deliver myself into your hands\nabsolutely; nay, more, I will give you my most solemn word of honour\nthat not only will I make no attempt at escape, but that I will not\nallow any one to help me to do so. I will be a passive and willing\nprisoner if you, on the other hand, will effect Mademoiselle Lange's\nrelease.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" mused Chauvelin again, \"it sounds feasible.\"\n\n\"It does! it does!\" rejoined Armand, whose excitement was at\nfever-pitch. \"My arrest, my condemnation, my death, will be of vast deal\nmore importance to you than that of a young and innocent girl against\nwhom unlikely charges would have to be tricked up, and whose acquittal\nmayhap public feeling might demand. As for me, I shall be an easy prey;\nmy known counter-revolutionary principles, my sister's marriage with a\nforeigner--\"\n\n\"Your connection with the Scarlet Pimpernel,\" suggested Chauvelin\nblandly.\n\n\"Quite so. I should not defend myself--\"\n\n\"And your enigmatical friend would not attempt your rescue. C'est\nentendu,\" said Chauvelin with his wonted blandness. \"Then, my dear,\nenthusiastic young friend, shall we adjourn to the office of my\ncolleague, citizen Heron, who is chief agent of the Committee of General\nSecurity, and will receive your--did you say confession?--and note the\nconditions under which you place yourself absolutely in the hands of the\nPublic Prosecutor and subsequently of the executioner. Is that it?\"\n\nArmand was too full of schemes, too full of thoughts of Jeanne to note\nthe tone of quiet irony with which Chauvelin had been speaking all\nalong. With the unreasoning egoism of youth he was quite convinced that\nhis own arrest, his own affairs were as important to this entire nation\nin revolution as they were to himself. At moments like these it is\ndifficult to envisage a desperate situation clearly, and to a young man\nin love the fate of the beloved never seems desperate whilst he himself\nis alive and ready for every sacrifice for her sake. \"My life for hers\"\nis the sublime if often foolish battle-cry that has so often resulted in\nwhole-sale destruction. Armand at this moment, when he fondly believed\nthat he was making a bargain with the most astute, most unscrupulous\nspy this revolutionary Government had in its pay--Armand just then had\nabsolutely forgotten his chief, his friends, the league of mercy and\nhelp to which he belonged.\n\nEnthusiasm and the spirit of self-sacrifice were carrying him away. He\nwatched his enemy with glowing eyes as one who looks on the arbiter of\nhis fate.\n\nChauvelin, without another word, beckoned to him to follow. He led the\nway out of the lodge, then, turning sharply to his left, he reached the\nwide quadrangle with the covered passage running right round it, the\nsame which de Batz had traversed two evenings ago when he went to visit\nHeron.\n\nArmand, with a light heart and springy step, followed him as if he were\ngoing to a feast where he would meet Jeanne, where he would kneel at\nher feet, kiss her hands, and lead her triumphantly to freedom and to\nhappiness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE REMOVAL\n\nChauvelin no longer made any pretence to hold Armand by the arm. By\ntemperament as well as by profession a spy, there was one subject at\nleast which he had mastered thoroughly: that was the study of human\nnature. Though occasionally an exceptionally complex mental organisation\nbaffled him--as in the case of Sir Percy Blakeney--he prided himself,\nand justly, too, on reading natures like that of Armand St. Just as he\nwould an open book.\n\nThe excitable disposition of the Latin races he knew out and out;\nhe knew exactly how far a sentimental situation would lead a young\nFrenchman like Armand, who was by disposition chivalrous, and by\ntemperament essentially passionate. Above all things, he knew when\nand how far he could trust a man to do either a sublime action or an\nessentially foolish one.\n\nTherefore he walked along contentedly now, not even looking back to see\nwhether St. Just was following him. He knew that he did.\n\nHis thoughts only dwelt on the young enthusiast--in his mind he\ncalled him the young fool--in order to weigh in the balance the mighty\npossibilities that would accrue from the present sequence of events.\nThe fixed idea ever working in the man's scheming brain had already\ntransformed a vague belief into a certainty. That the Scarlet Pimpernel\nwas in Paris at the present moment Chauvelin had now become convinced.\nHow far he could turn the capture of Armand St. Just to the triumph of\nhis own ends remained to be seen.\n\nBut this he did know: the Scarlet Pimpernel--the man whom he had learned\nto know, to dread, and even in a grudging manner to admire--was not like\nto leave one of his followers in the lurch. Marguerite's brother in the\nTemple would be the surest decoy for the elusive meddler who still, and\nin spite of all care and precaution, continued to baffle the army of\nspies set upon his track.\n\nChauvelin could hear Armand's light, elastic footsteps resounding behind\nhim on the flagstones. A world of intoxicating possibilities surged up\nbefore him. Ambition, which two successive dire failures had atrophied\nin his breast, once more rose up buoyant and hopeful. Once he had sworn\nto lay the Scarlet Pimpernel by the heels, and that oath was not yet\nwholly forgotten; it had lain dormant after the catastrophe of Boulogne,\nbut with the sight of Armand St. Just it had re-awakened and confronted\nhim again with the strength of a likely fulfilment.\n\nThe courtyard looked gloomy and deserted. The thin drizzle which still\nfell from a persistently leaden sky effectually held every outline of\nmasonry, of column, or of gate hidden as beneath a shroud. The corridor\nwhich skirted it all round was ill-lighted save by an occasional\noil-lamp fixed in the wall.\n\nBut Chauvelin knew his way well. Heron's lodgings gave on the second\ncourtyard, the Square du Nazaret, and the way thither led past the main\nsquare tower, in the top floor of which the uncrowned King of France\neked out his miserable existence as the plaything of a rough cobbler and\nhis wife.\n\nJust beneath its frowning bastions Chauvelin turned back towards Armand.\nHe pointed with a careless hand up-wards to the central tower.\n\n\"We have got little Capet in there,\" he said dryly. \"Your chivalrous\nScarlet Pimpernel has not ventured in these precincts yet, you see.\"\n\nArmand was silent. He had no difficulty in looking unconcerned; his\nthoughts were so full of Jeanne that he cared but little at this moment\nfor any Bourbon king or for the destinies of France.\n\nNow the two men reached the postern gate. A couple of sentinels were\nstanding by, but the gate itself was open, and from within there came\nthe sound of bustle and of noise, of a good deal of swearing, and also\nof loud laughter.\n\nThe guard-room gave on the left of the gate, and the laughter came from\nthere. It was brilliantly lighted, and Armand, peering in, in the wake\nof Chauvelin, could see groups of soldiers sitting and standing about.\nThere was a table in the centre of the room, and on it a number of jugs\nand pewter mugs, packets of cards, and overturned boxes of dice.\n\nBut the bustle did not come from the guard-room; it came from the\nlanding and the stone stairs beyond.\n\nChauvelin, apparently curious, had passed through the gate, and Armand\nfollowed him. The light from the open door of the guard-room cut sharply\nacross the landing, making the gloom beyond appear more dense and\nalmost solid. From out the darkness, fitfully intersected by a lanthorn\napparently carried to and fro, moving figures loomed out ghost-like and\nweirdly gigantic. Soon Armand distinguished a number of large objects\nthat encumbered the landing, and as he and Chauvelin left the sharp\nlight of the guard-room 'behind them, he could see that the large\nobjects were pieces of furniture of every shape and size; a wooden\nbedstead--dismantled--leaned against the wall, a black horsehair sofa\nblocked the way to the tower stairs, and there were numberless chairs\nand several tables piled one on the top of the other.\n\nIn the midst of this litter a stout, flabby-cheeked man stood,\napparently giving directions as to its removal to persons at present\nunseen.\n\n\"Hola, Papa Simon!\" exclaimed Chauvelin jovially; \"moving out to-day?\nWhat?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank the Lord!--if there be a Lord!\" retorted the other curtly.\n\"Is that you, citizen Chauvelin?\"\n\n\"In person, citizen. I did not know you were leaving quite so soon. Is\ncitizen Heron anywhere about?\"\n\n\"Just left,\" replied Simon. \"He had a last look at Capet just before\nmy wife locked the brat up in the inner room. Now he's gone back to his\nlodgings.\"\n\nA man carrying a chest, empty of its drawers, on his back now came\nstumbling down the tower staircase. Madame Simon followed close on his\nheels, steadying the chest with one hand.\n\n\"We had better begin to load up the cart,\" she called to her husband\nin a high-pitched querulous voice; \"the corridor is getting too much\nencumbered.\"\n\nShe looked suspiciously at Chauvelin and at Armand, and when she\nencountered the former's bland, unconcerned gaze she suddenly shivered\nand drew her black shawl closer round her shoulders.\n\n\"Bah!\" she said, \"I shall be glad to get out of this God-forsaken hole.\nI hate the very sight of these walls.\"\n\n\"Indeed, the citizeness does not look over robust in health,\" said\nChauvelin with studied politeness. \"The stay in the tower did not,\nmayhap, bring forth all the fruits of prosperity which she had\nanticipated.\"\n\nThe woman eyed him with dark suspicion lurking in her hollow eyes.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean, citizen,\" she said with a shrug of her wide\nshoulders.\n\n\"Oh! I meant nothing,\" rejoined Chauvelin, smiling. \"I am so interested\nin your removal; busy man as I am, it has amused me to watch you. Whom\nhave you got to help you with the furniture?\"\n\n\"Dupont, the man-of-all-work, from the concierge,\" said Simon curtly.\n\"Citizen Heron would not allow any one to come in from the outside.\"\n\n\"Rightly too. Have the new commissaries come yet?\n\n\"Only citizen Cochefer. He is waiting upstairs for the others.\"\n\n\"And Capet?\"\n\n\"He is all safe. Citizen Heron came to see him, and then he told me to\nlock the little vermin up in the inner room. Citizen Cochefer had just\narrived by that time, and he has remained in charge.\"\n\nDuring all this while the man with the chest on his back was waiting\nfor orders. Bent nearly double, he was grumbling audibly at his\nuncomfortable position.\n\n\"Does the citizen want to break my back?\" he muttered.\n\n\"We had best get along--quoi?\"\n\nHe asked if he should begin to carry the furniture out into the street.\n\n\"Two sous have I got to pay every ten minutes to the lad who holds my\nnag,\" he said, muttering under his breath; \"we shall be all night at\nthis rate.\"\n\n\"Begin to load then,\" commanded Simon gruffly. \"Here!--begin with this\nsofa.\"\n\n\"You'll have to give me a hand with that,\" said the man. \"Wait a bit;\nI'll just see that everything is all right in the cart. I'll be back\ndirectly.\"\n\n\"Take something with you then as you are going down,\" said Madame Simon\nin her querulous voice.\n\nThe man picked up a basket of linen that stood in the angle by the door.\nHe hoisted it on his back and shuffled away with it across the landing\nand out through the gate.\n\n\"How did Capet like parting from his papa and maman?\" asked Chauvelin\nwith a laugh.\n\n\"H'm!\" growled Simon laconically. \"He will find out soon enough how well\noff he was under our care.\"\n\n\"Have the other commissaries come yet?\"\n\n\"No. But they will be here directly. Citizen Cochefer is upstairs\nmounting guard over Capet.\"\n\n\"Well, good-bye, Papa Simon,\" concluded Chauvelin jovially. \"Citizeness,\nyour servant!\"\n\nHe bowed with unconcealed irony to the cobbler's wife, and nodded to\nSimon, who expressed by a volley of motley oaths his exact feelings with\nregard to all the agents of the Committee of General Security.\n\n\"Six months of this penal servitude have we had,\" he said roughly, \"and\nno thanks or pension. I would as soon serve a ci-devant aristo as your\naccursed Committee.\"\n\nThe man Dupont had returned. Stolidly, after the fashion of his kind,\nhe commenced the removal of citizen Simon's goods. He seemed a clumsy\nenough creature, and Simon and his wife had to do most of the work\nthemselves.\n\nChauvelin watched the moving forms for a while, then he shrugged his\nshoulders with a laugh of indifference, and turned on his heel.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. IT IS ABOUT THE DAUPHIN\n\nHeron was not at his lodgings when, at last, after vigorous pulls at\nthe bell, a great deal of waiting and much cursing, Chauvelin, closely\nfollowed by Armand, was introduced in the chief agent's office.\n\nThe soldier who acted as servant said that citizen Heron had gone out\nto sup, but would surely be home again by eight o'clock. Armand by this\ntime was so dazed with fatigue that he sank on a chair like a log, and\nremained there staring into the fire, unconscious of the flight of time.\n\nAnon Heron came home. He nodded to Chauvelin, and threw but a cursory\nglance on Armand.\n\n\"Five minutes, citizen,\" he said, with a rough attempt at an apology. \"I\nam sorry to keep you waiting, but the new commissaries have arrived who\nare to take charge of Capet. The Simons have just gone, and I want to\nassure myself that everything is all right in the Tower. Cochefer\nhas been in charge, but I like to cast an eye over the brat every day\nmyself.\"\n\nHe went out again, slamming the door behind him. His heavy footsteps\nwere heard treading the flagstones of the corridor, and gradually dying\naway in the distance. Armand had paid no heed either to his entrance or\nto his exit. He was only conscious of an intense weariness, and would at\nthis moment gladly have laid his head on the scaffold if on it he could\nfind rest.\n\nA white-faced clock on the wall ticked off the seconds one by one. From\nthe street below came the muffled sounds of wheeled traffic on the soft\nmud of the road; it was raining more heavily now, and from time to time\na gust of wind rattled the small windows in their dilapidated frames, or\nhurled a shower of heavy drops against the panes.\n\nThe heat from the stove had made Armand drowsy; his head fell forward\non his chest. Chauvelin, with his hands held behind his back, paced\nceaselessly up and down the narrow room.\n\nSuddenly Armand started--wide awake now. Hurried footsteps on the\nflagstones outside, a hoarse shout, a banging of heavy doors, and the\nnext moment Heron stood once more on the threshold of the room. Armand,\nwith wide-opened eyes, gazed on him in wonder. The whole appearance of\nthe man had changed. He looked ten years older, with lank, dishevelled\nhair hanging matted over a moist forehead, the cheeks ashen-white, the\nfull lips bloodless and hanging, flabby and parted, displaying both rows\nof yellow teeth that shook against each other. The whole figure looked\nbowed, as if shrunk within itself.\n\nChauvelin had paused in his restless walk. He gazed on his colleague, a\nfrown of puzzlement on his pale, set face.\n\n\"Capet!\" he exclaimed, as soon as he had taken in every detail of\nHeron's altered appearance, and seen the look of wild terror that\nliterally distorted his face.\n\nHeron could not speak; his teeth were chattering in his mouth, and his\ntongue seemed paralysed. Chauvelin went up to him. He was several inches\nshorter than his colleague, but at this moment he seemed to be towering\nover him like an avenging spirit. He placed a firm hand on the other's\nbowed shoulders.\n\n\"Capet has gone--is that it?\" he queried peremptorily.\n\nThe look of terror increased in Heron's eyes, giving its mute reply.\n\n\"How? When?\"\n\nBut for the moment the man was speechless. An almost maniacal fear\nseemed to hold him in its grip. With an impatient oath Chauvelin turned\naway from him.\n\n\"Brandy!\" he said curtly, speaking to Armand.\n\nA bottle and glass were found in the cupboard. It was St. Just who\npoured out the brandy and held it to Heron's lips. Chauvelin was once\nmore pacing up and down the room in angry impatience.\n\n\"Pull yourself together, man,\" he said roughly after a while, \"and try\nand tell me what has occurred.\"\n\nHeron had sunk into a chair. He passed a trembling hand once or twice\nover his forehead.\n\n\"Capet has disappeared,\" he murmured; \"he must have been spirited away\nwhile the Simons were moving their furniture. That accursed Cochefer was\ncompletely taken in.\"\n\nHeron spoke in a toneless voice, hardly above a whisper, and like one\nwhose throat is dry and mouth parched. But the brandy had revived him\nsomewhat, and his eyes lost their former glassy look.\n\n\"How?\" asked Chauvelin curtly.\n\n\"I was just leaving the Tower when he arrived. I spoke to him at the\ndoor. I had seen Capet safely installed in the room, and gave orders\nto the woman Simon to let citizen Cochefer have a look at him, too, and\nthen to lock up the brat in the inner room and install Cochefer in the\nantechamber on guard. I stood talking to Cochefer for a few moments in\nthe antechamber. The woman Simon and the man-of-all-work, Dupont--whom\nI know well--were busy with the furniture. There could not have been any\none else concealed about the place--that I'll swear. Cochefer, after he\ntook leave of me, went straight into the room; he found the woman Simon\nin the act of turning the key in the door of the inner chamber. I have\nlocked Capet in there,' she said, giving the key to Cochefer; 'he will\nbe quite safe until to-night; when the other commissaries come.'\n\n\"Didn't Cochefer go into the room and ascertain whether the woman was\nlying?\"\n\n\"Yes, he did! He made the woman re-open the door and peeped in over her\nshoulder. She said the child was asleep. He vows that he saw the child\nlying fully dressed on a rug in the further corner of the room. The\nroom, of course, was quite empty of furniture and only lighted by one\ncandle, but there was the rug and the child asleep on it. Cochefer\nswears he saw him, and now--when I went up--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"The commissaries were all there--Cochefer and Lasniere, Lorinet and\nLegrand. We went into the inner room, and I had a candle in my hand. We\nsaw the child lying on the rug, just as Cochefer had seen him, and for\na while we took no notice of it. Then some one--I think it was\nLorinet--went to have a closer look at the brat. He took up the candle\nand went up to the rug. Then he gave a cry, and we all gathered round\nhim. The sleeping child was only a bundle of hair and of clothes, a\ndummy--what?\"\n\nThere was silence now in the narrow room, while the white-faced clock\ncontinued to tick off each succeeding second of time. Heron had once\nmore buried his head in his hands; a trembling--like an attack of\nague--shook his wide, bony shoulders. Armand had listened to the\nnarrative with glowing eyes and a beating heart. The details which the\ntwo Terrorists here could not probably understand he had already added\nto the picture which his mind had conjured up.\n\nHe was back in thought now in the small lodging in the rear of St.\nGermain l'Auxerrois; Sir Andrew Ffoulkes was there, and my Lord Tony and\nHastings, and a man was striding up and down the room, looking out into\nthe great space beyond the river with the eyes of a seer, and a firm\nvoice said abruptly:\n\n\"It is about the Dauphin!\"\n\n\"Have you any suspicions?\" asked Chauvelin now, pausing in his walk\nbeside Heron, and once more placing a firm, peremptory hand on his\ncolleague's shoulder.\n\n\"Suspicions!\" exclaimed the chief agent with a loud oath. \"Suspicions!\nCertainties, you mean. The man sat here but two days ago, in that very\nchair, and bragged of what he would do. I told him then that if he\ninterfered with Capet I would wring his neck with my own hands.\"\n\nAnd his long, talon-like fingers, with their sharp, grimy nails, closed\nand unclosed like those of feline creatures when they hold the coveted\nprey.\n\n\"Of whom do you speak?\" queried Chauvelin curtly.\n\n\"Of whom? Of whom but that accursed de Batz? His pockets are bulging\nwith Austrian money, with which, no doubt, he has bribed the Simons and\nCochefer and the sentinels--\"\n\n\"And Lorinet and Lasniere and you,\" interposed Chauvelin dryly.\n\n\"It is false!\" roared Heron, who already at the suggestion was foaming\nat the mouth, and had jumped up from his chair, standing at bay as if\nprepared to fight for his life.\n\n\"False, is it?\" retorted Chauvelin calmly; \"then be not so quick, friend\nHeron, in slashing out with senseless denunciations right and left.\nYou'll gain nothing by denouncing any one just now. This is too\nintricate a matter to be dealt with a sledge-hammer. Is any one up in\nthe Tower at this moment?\" he asked in quiet, business-like tones.\n\n\"Yes. Cochefer and the others are still there. They are making wild\nschemes to cover their treachery. Cochefer is aware of his own danger,\nand Lasniere and the others know that they arrived at the Tower several\nhours too late. They are all at fault, and they know it. As for that de\nBatz,\" he continued with a voice rendered raucous with bitter passion,\n\"I swore to him two days ago that he should not escape me if he meddled\nwith Capet. I'm on his track already. I'll have him before the hour\nof midnight, and I'll torture him--yes! I'll torture him--the Tribunal\nshall give me leave. We have a dark cell down below here where my men\nknow how to apply tortures worse than the rack--where they know just how\nto prolong life long enough to make it unendurable. I'll torture him!\nI'll torture him!\"\n\nBut Chauvelin abruptly silenced the wretch with a curt command; then,\nwithout another word, he walked straight out of the room.\n\nIn thought Armand followed him. The wild desire was suddenly born in him\nto run away at this moment, while Heron, wrapped in his own meditations,\nwas paying no heed to him. Chauvelin's footsteps had long ago died away\nin the distance; it was a long way to the upper floor of the Tower, and\nsome time would be spent, too, in interrogating the commissaries. This\nwas Armand's opportunity. After all, if he were free himself he might\nmore effectually help to rescue Jeanne. He knew, too, now where to join\nhis leader. The corner of the street by the canal, where Sir Andrew\nFfoulkes would be waiting with the coal-cart; then there was the spinney\non the road to St. Germain. Armand hoped that, with good luck, he might\nyet overtake his comrades, tell them of Jeanne's plight, and entreat\nthem to work for her rescue.\n\nHe had forgotten that now he had no certificate of safety, that\nundoubtedly he would be stopped at the gates at this hour of the\nnight; that his conduct proving suspect he would in all probability he\ndetained, and, mayhap, be brought back to this self-same place within an\nhour. He had forgotten all that, for the primeval instinct for freedom\nhad suddenly been aroused. He rose softly from his chair and crossed\nthe room. Heron paid no attention to him. Now he had traversed the\nantechamber and unlatched the outer door.\n\nImmediately a couple of bayonets were crossed in front of him, two more\nfurther on ahead scintillated feebly in the flickering light. Chauvelin\nhad taken his precautions. There was no doubt that Armand St. Just was\neffectually a prisoner now.\n\nWith a sigh of disappointment he went back to his place beside the\nfire. Heron had not even moved whilst he had made this futile attempt at\nescape. Five minutes later Chauvelin re-entered the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. THE CERTIFICATE OF SAFETY\n\n\"You can leave de Batz and his gang alone, citizen Heron,\" said\nChauvelin, as soon as he had closed the door behind him; \"he had nothing\nto do with the escape of the Dauphin.\"\n\nHeron growled out a few words of incredulity. But Chauvelin shrugged his\nshoulders and looked with unutterable contempt on his colleague. Armand,\nwho was watching him closely, saw that in his hand he held a small piece\nof paper, which he had crushed into a shapeless mass.\n\n\"Do not waste your time, citizen,\" he said, \"in raging against an\nempty wind-bag. Arrest de Batz if you like, or leave him alone an you\nplease--we have nothing to fear from that braggart.\"\n\nWith nervous, slightly shaking fingers he set to work to smooth out the\nscrap of paper which he held. His hot hands had soiled it and pounded it\nuntil it was a mere rag and the writing on it illegible. But, such as\nit was, he threw it down with a blasphemous oath on the desk in front of\nHeron's eyes.\n\n\"It is that accursed Englishman who has been at work again,\" he said\nmore calmly; \"I guessed it the moment I heard your story. Set your whole\narmy of sleuth-hounds on his track, citizen; you'll need them all.\"\n\nHeron picked up the scrap of torn paper and tried to decipher the\nwriting on it by the light from the lamp. He seemed almost dazed now\nwith the awful catastrophe that had befallen him, and the fear that his\nown wretched life would have to pay the penalty for the disappearance of\nthe child.\n\nAs for Armand--even in the midst of his own troubles, and of his own\nanxiety for Jeanne, he felt a proud exultation in his heart. The Scarlet\nPimpernel had succeeded; Percy had not failed in his self-imposed\nundertaking. Chauvelin, whose piercing eyes were fixed on him at that\nmoment, smiled with contemptuous irony.\n\n\"As you will find your hands overfull for the next few hours, citizen\nHeron,\" he said, speaking to his colleague and nodding in the direction\nof Armand, \"I'll not trouble you with the voluntary confession this\nyoung citizen desired to make to you. All I need tell you is that he\nis an adherent of the Scarlet Pimpernel--I believe one of his most\nfaithful, most trusted officers.\"\n\nHeron roused himself from the maze of gloomy thoughts that were again\nparalysing his tongue. He turned bleary, wild eyes on Armand.\n\n\"We have got one of them, then?\" he murmured incoherently, babbling like\na drunken man.\n\n\"M'yes!\" replied Chauvelin lightly; \"but it is too late now for a formal\ndenunciation and arrest. He cannot leave Paris anyhow, and all that your\nmen need to do is to keep a close look-out on him. But I should send him\nhome to-night if I were you.\"\n\nHeron muttered something more, which, however, Armand did not\nunderstand. Chauvelin's words were still ringing in his ear. Was he,\nthen, to be set free to-night? Free in a measure, of course, since\nspies were to be set to watch him--but free, nevertheless? He could not\nunderstand Chauvelin's attitude, and his own self-love was not a little\nwounded at the thought that he was of such little account that these men\ncould afford to give him even this provisional freedom. And, of course,\nthere was still Jeanne.\n\n\"I must, therefore, bid you good-night, citizen,\" Chauvelin was saying\nin his bland, gently ironical manner. \"You will be glad to return to\nyour lodgings. As you see, the chief agent of the Committee of General\nSecurity is too much occupied just now to accept the sacrifice of your\nlife which you were prepared so generously to offer him.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, citizen,\" retorted Armand coldly, \"nor do I\ndesire indulgence at your hands. You have arrested an innocent woman on\nthe trumped-up charge that she was harbouring me. I came here to-night\nto give myself up to justice so that she might be set free.\"\n\n\"But the hour is somewhat late, citizen,\" rejoined Chauvelin urbanely.\n\"The lady in whom you take so fervent an interest is no doubt asleep in\nher cell at this hour. It would not be fitting to disturb her now.\nShe might not find shelter before morning, and the weather is quite\nexceptionally unpropitious.\"\n\n\"Then, sir,\" said Armand, a little bewildered, \"am I to understand that\nif I hold myself at your disposition Mademoiselle Lange will be set free\nas early to-morrow morning as may be?\"\n\n\"No doubt, sir--no doubt,\" replied Chauvelin with more than his\naccustomed blandness; \"if you will hold yourself entirely at our\ndisposition, Mademoiselle Lange will be set free to-morrow. I think\nthat we can safely promise that, citizen Heron, can we not?\" he added,\nturning to his colleague.\n\nBut Heron, overcome with the stress of emotions, could only murmur\nvague, unintelligible words.\n\n\"Your word on that, citizen Chauvelin?\" asked Armand.\n\n\"My word on it an you will accept it.\"\n\n\"No, I will not do that. Give me an unconditional certificate of safety\nand I will believe you.\"\n\n\"Of what use were that to you?\" asked Chauvelin.\n\n\"I believe my capture to be of more importance to you than that of\nMademoiselle Lange,\" said Armand quietly.\n\n\"I will use the certificate of safety for myself or one of my friends if\nyou break your word to me anent Mademoiselle Lange.\"\n\n\"H'm! the reasoning is not illogical, citizen,\" said Chauvelin, whilst a\ncurious smile played round the corners of his thin lips. \"You are quite\nright. You are a more valuable asset to us than the charming lady who, I\nhope, will for many a day and year to come delight pleasure-loving Paris\nwith her talent and her grace.\"\n\n\"Amen to that, citizen,\" said Armand fervently.\n\n\"Well, it will all depend on you, sir! Here,\" he added, coolly running\nover some papers on Heron's desk until he found what he wanted, \"is an\nabsolutely unconditional certificate of safety. The Committee of General\nSecurity issue very few of these. It is worth the cost of a human life.\nAt no barrier or gate of any city can such a certificate be disregarded,\nnor even can it be detained. Allow me to hand it to you, citizen, as a\npledge of my own good faith.\"\n\nSmiling, urbane, with a curious look that almost expressed amusement\nlurking in his shrewd, pale eyes, Chauvelin handed the momentous\ndocument to Armand.\n\nThe young man studied it very carefully before he slipped it into the\ninner pocket of his coat.\n\n\"How soon shall I have news of Mademoiselle Lange?\" he asked finally.\n\n\"In the course of to-morrow. I myself will call on you and redeem that\nprecious document in person. You, on the other hand, will hold yourself\nat my disposition. That's understood, is it not?\"\n\n\"I shall not fail you. My lodgings are--\"\n\n\"Oh! do not trouble,\" interposed Chauvelin, with a polite bow; \"we can\nfind that out for ourselves.\"\n\nHeron had taken no part in this colloquy. Now that Armand prepared to\ngo he made no attempt to detain him, or to question his colleague's\nactions. He sat by the table like a log; his mind was obviously a blank\nto all else save to his own terrors engendered by the events of this\nnight.\n\nWith bleary, half-veiled eyes he followed Armand's progress through\nthe room, and seemed unaware of the loud slamming of the outside door.\nChauvelin had escorted the young man past the first line of sentry, then\nhe took cordial leave of him.\n\n\"Your certificate will, you will find, open every gate to you.\nGood-night, citizen. A demain.\"\n\n\"Good-night.\"\n\nArmand's slim figure disappeared in the gloom. Chauvelin watched him for\na few moments until even his footsteps had died away in the distance;\nthen he turned back towards Heron's lodgings.\n\n\"A nous deux,\" he muttered between tightly clenched teeth; \"a nous deux\nonce more, my enigmatical Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. BACK TO PARIS\n\nIt was an exceptionally dark night, and the rain was falling in\ntorrents. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, wrapped in a piece of sacking, had taken\nshelter right underneath the coal-cart; even then he was getting wet\nthrough to the skin.\n\nHe had worked hard for two days coal-heaving, and the night before he\nhad found a cheap, squalid lodging where at any rate he was protected\nfrom the inclemencies of the weather; but to-night he was expecting\nBlakeney at the appointed hour and place. He had secured a cart of the\nordinary ramshackle pattern used for carrying coal. Unfortunately there\nwere no covered ones to be obtained in the neighbourhood, and equally\nunfortunately the thaw had set in with a blustering wind and diving\nrain, which made waiting in the open air for hours at a stretch and in\ncomplete darkness excessively unpleasant.\n\nBut for all these discomforts Sir Andrew Ffoulkes cared not one jot. In\nEngland, in his magnificent Suffolk home, he was a confirmed sybarite,\nin whose service every description of comfort and luxury had to\nbe enrolled. Here tonight in the rough and tattered clothes of a\ncoal-heaver, drenched to the skin, and crouching under the body of\na cart that hardly sheltered him from the rain, he was as happy as a\nschoolboy out for a holiday.\n\nHappy, but vaguely anxious.\n\nHe had no means of ascertaining the time. So many of the church-bells\nand clock towers had been silenced recently that not one of those\nwelcome sounds penetrated to the dreary desolation of this canal wharf,\nwith its abandoned carts standing ghostlike in a row. Darkness had set\nin very early in the afternoon, and the heavers had given up work soon\nafter four o'clock.\n\nFor about an hour after that a certain animation had still reigned round\nthe wharf, men crossing and going, one or two of the barges moving in or\nout alongside the quay. But for some time now darkness and silence had\nbeen the masters in this desolate spot, and that time had seemed to Sir\nAndrew an eternity. He had hobbled and tethered his horse, and stretched\nhimself out at full length under the cart. Now and again he had crawled\nout from under this uncomfortable shelter and walked up and down in\nankle-deep mud, trying to restore circulation in his stiffened limbs;\nnow and again a kind of torpor had come over him, and he had fallen into\na brief and restless sleep. He would at this moment have given half his\nfortune for knowledge of the exact time.\n\nBut through all this weary waiting he was never for a moment in doubt.\nUnlike Armand St. Just, he had the simplest, most perfect faith in his\nchief. He had been Blakeney's constant companion in all these adventures\nfor close upon four years now; the thought of failure, however vague,\nnever once entered his mind.\n\nHe was only anxious for his chief's welfare. He knew that he would\nsucceed, but he would have liked to have spared him much of the physical\nfatigue and the nerve-racking strain of these hours that lay between\nthe daring deed and the hope of safety. Therefore he was conscious of\nan acute tingling of his nerves, which went on even during the brief\npatches of fitful sleep, and through the numbness that invaded his whole\nbody while the hours dragged wearily and slowly along.\n\nThen, quite suddenly, he felt wakeful and alert; quite a while--even\nbefore he heard the welcome signal--he knew, with a curious, subtle\nsense of magnetism, that the hour had come, and that his chief was\nsomewhere near by, not very far.\n\nThen he heard the cry--a seamew's call--repeated thrice at intervals,\nand five minutes later something loomed out of the darkness quite close\nto the hind wheels of the cart.\n\n\"Hist! Ffoulkes!\" came in a soft whisper, scarce louder than the wind.\n\n\"Present!\" came in quick response.\n\n\"Here, help me to lift the child into the cart. He is asleep, and has\nbeen a dead weight on my arm for close on an hour now. Have you a dry\nbit of sacking or something to lay him on?\"\n\n\"Not very dry, I am afraid.\"\n\nWith tender care the two men lifted the sleeping little King of France\ninto the rickety cart. Blakeney laid his cloak over him, and listened\nfor awhile to the slow regular breathing of the child.\n\n\"St. Just is not here--you know that?\" said Sir Andrew after a while.\n\n\"Yes, I knew it,\" replied Blakeney curtly.\n\nIt was characteristic of these two men that not a word about the\nadventure itself, about the terrible risks and dangers of the past few\nhours, was exchanged between them. The child was here and was safe,\nand Blakeney knew the whereabouts of St. Just--that was enough for Sir\nAndrew Ffoulkes, the most devoted follower, the most perfect friend the\nScarlet Pimpernel would ever know.\n\nFfoulkes now went to the horse, detached the nose-bag, and undid the\nnooses of the hobble and of the tether.\n\n\"Will you get in now, Blakeney?\" he said; \"we are ready.\"\n\nAnd in unbroken silence they both got into the cart; Blakeney sitting\non its floor beside the child, and Ffoulkes gathering the reins in his\nhands.\n\nThe wheels of the cart and the slow jog-trot of the horse made scarcely\nany noise in the mud of the roads, what noise they did make was\neffectually drowned by the soughing of the wind in the bare branches of\nthe stunted acacia trees that edged the towpath along the line of the\ncanal.\n\nSir Andrew had studied the topography of this desolate neighbourhood\nwell during the past twenty-four hours; he knew of a detour that would\nenable him to avoid the La Villette gate and the neighbourhood of the\nfortifications, and yet bring him out soon on the road leading to St.\nGermain.\n\nOnce he turned to ask Blakeney the time.\n\n\"It must be close on ten now,\" replied Sir Percy. \"Push your nag along,\nold man. Tony and Hastings will be waiting for us.\"\n\nIt was very difficult to see clearly even a metre or two ahead, but the\nroad was a straight one, and the old nag seemed to know it almost as\nwell and better than her driver. She shambled along at her own pace,\ncovering the ground very slowly for Ffoulkes's burning impatience. Once\nor twice he had to get down and lead her over a rough piece of ground.\nThey passed several groups of dismal, squalid houses, in some of which\na dim light still burned, and as they skirted St. Ouen the church clock\nslowly tolled the hour of midnight.\n\nBut for the greater part of the way derelict, uncultivated spaces of\nterrains vagues, and a few isolated houses lay between the road and the\nfortifications of the city. The darkness of the night, the late hour,\nthe soughing of the wind, were all in favour of the adventurers; and\na coal-cart slowly trudging along in this neighbourhood, with two\nlabourers sitting in it, was the least likely of any vehicle to attract\nattention.\n\nPast Clichy, they had to cross the river by the rickety wooden bridge\nthat was unsafe even in broad daylight. They were not far from their\ndestination now. Half a dozen kilometres further on they would be\nleaving Courbevoie on their left, and then the sign-post would come\nin sight. After that the spinney just off the road, and the welcome\npresence of Tony, Hastings, and the horses. Ffoulkes got down in order\nto make sure of the way. He walked at the horse's head now, fearful lest\nhe missed the cross-roads and the sign-post.\n\nThe horse was getting over-tired; it had covered fifteen kilometres, and\nit was close on three o'clock of Monday morning.\n\nAnother hour went by in absolute silence. Ffoulkes and Blakeney took\nturns at the horse's head. Then at last they reached the cross-roads;\neven through the darkness the sign-post showed white against the\nsurrounding gloom.\n\n\"This looks like it,\" murmured Sir Andrew. He turned the horse's\nhead sharply towards the left, down a narrower road, and leaving the\nsign-post behind him. He walked slowly along for another quarter of an\nhour, then Blakeney called a halt.\n\n\"The spinney must be sharp on our right now,\" he said.\n\nHe got down from the cart, and while Ffoulkes remained beside the horse,\nhe plunged into the gloom. A moment later the cry of the seamew rang out\nthree times into the air. It was answered almost immediately.\n\nThe spinney lay on the right of the road. Soon the soft sounds that to a\ntrained ear invariably betray the presence of a number of horses reached\nFfoulkes' straining senses. He took his old nag out of the shafts, and\nthe shabby harness from off her, then he turned her out on the piece\nof waste land that faced the spinney. Some one would find her in the\nmorning, her and the cart with the shabby harness laid in it, and,\nhaving wondered if all these things had perchance dropped down from\nheaven, would quietly appropriate them, and mayhap thank much-maligned\nheaven for its gift.\n\nBlakeney in the meanwhile had lifted the sleeping child out of the cart.\nThen he called to Sir Andrew and led the way across the road and into\nthe spinney.\n\nFive minutes later Hastings received the uncrowned King of France in his\narms.\n\nUnlike Ffoulkes, my Lord Tony wanted to hear all about the adventure\nof this afternoon. A thorough sportsman, he loved a good story of\nhairbreadth escapes, of dangers cleverly avoided, risks taken and\nconquered.\n\n\"Just in ten words, Blakeney,\" he urged entreatingly; \"how did you\nactually get the boy away?\"\n\nSir Percy laughed--despite himself--at the young man's eagerness.\n\n\"Next time we meet, Tony,\" he begged; \"I am so demmed fatigued, and\nthere's this beastly rain--\"\n\n\"No, no--now! while Hastings sees to the horses. I could not exist long\nwithout knowing, and we are well sheltered from the rain under this\ntree.\"\n\n\"Well, then, since you will have it,\" he began with a laugh, which\ndespite the weariness and anxiety of the past twenty-four hours had\nforced itself to his lips, \"I have been sweeper and man-of-all-work at\nthe Temple for the past few weeks, you must know--\"\n\n\"No!\" ejaculated my Lord Tony lustily. \"By gum!\"\n\n\"Indeed, you old sybarite, whilst you were enjoying yourself heaving\ncoal on the canal wharf, I was scrubbing floors, lighting fires, and\ndoing a number of odd jobs for a lot of demmed murdering villains,\nand\"--he added under his breath--\"incidentally, too, for our league.\nWhenever I had an hour or two off duty I spent them in my lodgings, and\nasked you all to come and meet me there.\"\n\n\"By Gad, Blakeney! Then the day before yesterday?--when we all met--\"\n\n\"I had just had a bath--sorely needed, I can tell you. I had been\ncleaning boots half the day, but I had heard that the Simons were\nremoving from the Temple on the Sunday, and had obtained an order from\nthem to help them shift their furniture.\"\n\n\"Cleaning boots!\" murmured my Lord Tony with a chuckle. \"Well! and\nthen?\"\n\n\"Well, then everything worked out splendidly. You see by that time I was\na well-known figure in the Temple. Heron knew me well. I used to be his\nlanthorn-bearer when at nights he visited that poor mite in his prison.\nIt was 'Dupont, here! Dupont there!' all day long. 'Light the fire in\nthe office, Dupont! Dupont, brush my coat! Dupont, fetch me a light!'\nWhen the Simons wanted to move their household goods they called loudly\nfor Dupont. I got a covered laundry cart, and I brought a dummy with\nme to substitute for the child. Simon himself knew nothing of this, but\nMadame was in my pay. The dummy was just splendid, with real hair on its\nhead; Madame helped me to substitute it for the child; we laid it on the\nsofa and covered it over with a rug, even while those brutes Heron and\nCochefer were on the landing outside, and we stuffed His Majesty the\nKing of France into a linen basket. The room was badly lighted, and\nany one would have been deceived. No one was suspicious of that type of\ntrickery, so it went off splendidly. I moved the furniture of the Simons\nout of the Tower. His Majesty King Louis XVII was still concealed in the\nlinen basket. I drove the Simons to their new lodgings--the man still\nsuspects nothing--and there I helped them to unload the furniture--with\nthe exception of the linen basket, of course. After that I drove my\nlaundry cart to a house I knew of and collected a number of linen\nbaskets, which I had arranged should be in readiness for me. Thus loaded\nup I left Paris by the Vincennes gate, and drove as far as Bagnolet,\nwhere there is no road except past the octroi, where the officials might\nhave proved unpleasant. So I lifted His Majesty out of the basket and\nwe walked on hand in hand in the darkness and the rain until the poor\nlittle feet gave out. Then the little fellow--who has been wonderfully\nplucky throughout, indeed, more a Capet than a Bourbon--snuggled up in\nmy arms and went fast asleep, and--and--well, I think that's all, for\nhere we are, you see.\"\n\n\"But if Madame Simon had not been amenable to bribery?\" suggested Lord\nTony after a moment's silence.\n\n\"Then I should have had to think of something else.\"\n\n\"If during the removal of the furniture Heron had remained resolutely in\nthe room?\"\n\n\"Then, again, I should have had to think of something else; but remember\nthat in life there is always one supreme moment when Chance--who is\ncredited to have but one hair on her head--stands by you for a brief\nspace of time; sometimes that space is infinitesimal--one minute, a few\nseconds--just the time to seize Chance by that one hair. So I pray you\nall give me no credit in this or any other matter in which we all work\ntogether, but the quickness of seizing Chance by the hair during the\nbrief moment when she stands by my side. If Madame Simon had been\nun-amenable, if Heron had remained in the room all the time, if Cochefer\nhad had two looks at the dummy instead of one--well, then, something\nelse would have helped me, something would have occurred; something--I\nknow not what--but surely something which Chance meant to be on our\nside, if only we were quick enough to seize it--and so you see how\nsimple it all is.\"\n\nSo simple, in fact, that it was sublime. The daring, the pluck, the\ningenuity and, above all, the super-human heroism and endurance which\nrendered the hearers of this simple narrative, simply told, dumb with\nadmiration.\n\nTheir thoughts now were beyond verbal expression.\n\n\"How soon was the hue and cry for the child about the streets?\" asked\nTony, after a moment's silence.\n\n\"It was not out when I left the gates of Paris,\" said Blakeney\nmeditatively; \"so quietly has the news of the escape been kept, that I\nam wondering what devilry that brute Heron can be after. And now no more\nchattering,\" he continued lightly; \"all to horse, and you, Hastings,\nhave a care. The destinies of France, mayhap, will be lying asleep in\nyour arms.\"\n\n\"But you, Blakeney?\" exclaimed the three men almost simultaneously.\n\n\"I am not going with you. I entrust the child to you. For God's sake\nguard him well! Ride with him to Mantes. You should arrive there at\nabout ten o'clock. One of you then go straight to No.9 Rue la Tour. Ring\nthe bell; an old man will answer it. Say the one word to him, 'Enfant';\nhe will reply, 'De roi!' Give him the child, and may Heaven bless you\nall for the help you have given me this night!\"\n\n\"But you, Blakeney?\" reiterated Tony with a note of deep anxiety in his\nfresh young voice.\n\n\"I am straight for Paris,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Therefore feasible.\"\n\n\"But why? Percy, in the name of Heaven, do you realise what you are\ndoing?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"They'll not leave a stone unturned to find you--they know by now,\nbelieve me, that your hand did this trick.\"\n\n\"I know that.\"\n\n\"And yet you mean to go back?\"\n\n\"And yet I am going back.\"\n\n\"Blakeney!\"\n\n\"It's no use, Tony. Armand is in Paris. I saw him in the corridor of the\nTemple prison in the company of Chauvelin.\"\n\n\"Great God!\" exclaimed Lord Hastings.\n\nThe others were silent. What was the use of arguing? One of themselves\nwas in danger. Armand St. Just, the brother of Marguerite Blakeney! Was\nit likely that Percy would leave him in the lurch.\n\n\"One of us will stay with you, of course?\" asked Sir Andrew after\nawhile.\n\n\"Yes! I want Hastings and Tony to take the child to Mantes, then to make\nall possible haste for Calais, and there to keep in close touch with the\nDay-Dream; the skipper will contrive to open communication. Tell him to\nremain in Calais waters. I hope I may have need of him soon.\n\n\"And now to horse, both of you,\" he added gaily. \"Hastings, when you\nare ready, I will hand up the child to you. He will be quite safe on the\npillion with a strap round him and you.\"\n\nNothing more was said after that. The orders were given, there was\nnothing to do but to obey; and the uncrowned King of France was not\nyet out of danger. Hastings and Tony led two of the horses out of the\nspinney; at the roadside they mounted, and then the little lad for whose\nsake so much heroism, such selfless devotion had been expended, was\nhoisted up, still half asleep, on the pillion in front of my Lord\nHastings.\n\n\"Keep your arm round him,\" admonished Blakeney; \"your horse looks quiet\nenough. But put on speed as far as Mantes, and may Heaven guard you\nboth!\"\n\nThe two men pressed their heels to their horses' flanks, the beasts\nsnorted and pawed the ground anxious to start. There were a few\nwhispered farewells, two loyal hands were stretched out at the last,\neager to grasp the leader's hand.\n\nThen horses and riders disappeared in the utter darkness which comes\nbefore the dawn.\n\nBlakeney and Ffoulkes stood side by side in silence for as long as the\npawing of hoofs in the mud could reach their ears, then Ffoulkes asked\nabruptly:\n\n\"What do you want me to do, Blakeney?\"\n\n\"Well, for the present, my dear fellow, I want you to take one of the\nthree horses we have left in the spinney, and put him into the shafts of\nour old friend the coal-cart; then I am afraid that you must go back the\nway we came.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Continue to heave coal on the canal wharf by La Villette; it is the\nbest way to avoid attention. After your day's work keep your cart and\nhorse in readiness against my arrival, at the same spot where you\nwere last night. If after having waited for me like this for three\nconsecutive nights you neither see nor hear anything from me, go back\nto England and tell Marguerite that in giving my life for her brother I\ngave it for her!\"\n\n\"Blakeney--!\"\n\n\"I spoke differently to what I usually do, is that it?\" he interposed,\nplacing his firm hand on his friend's shoulder. \"I am degenerating,\nFfoulkes--that's what it is. Pay no heed to it. I suppose that carrying\nthat sleeping child in my arms last night softened some nerves in my\nbody. I was so infinitely sorry for the poor mite, and vaguely wondered\nif I had not saved it from one misery only to plunge it in another.\nThere was such a fateful look on that wan little face, as if destiny had\nalready writ its veto there against happiness. It came on me then how\nfutile were our actions, if God chooses to interpose His will between us\nand our desires.\"\n\nAlmost as he left off speaking the rain ceased to patter down against\nthe puddles in the road. Overhead the clouds flew by at terrific speed,\ndriven along by the blustering wind. It was less dark now, and Sir\nAndrew, peering through the gloom, could see his leader's face. It was\nsingularly pale and hard, and the deep-set lazy eyes had in them just\nthat fateful look which he himself had spoken of just now.\n\n\"You are anxious about Armand, Percy?\" asked Ffoulkes softly.\n\n\"Yes. He should have trusted me, as I had trusted him. He missed me at\nthe Villette gate on Friday, and without a thought left me--left us all\nin the lurch; he threw himself into the lion's jaws, thinking that he\ncould help the girl he loved. I knew that I could save her. She is in\ncomparative safety even now. The old woman, Madame Belhomme, had been\nfreely released the day after her arrest, but Jeanne Lange is still in\nthe house in the Rue de Charonne. You know it, Ffoulkes. I got her there\nearly this morning. It was easy for me, of course: 'Hola, Dupont!\nmy boots, Dupont!' 'One moment, citizen, my daughter--' 'Curse thy\ndaughter, bring me my boots!' and Jeanne Lange walked out of the Temple\nprison her hand in that of that lout Dupont.\"\n\n\"But Armand does not know that she is in the Rue de Charonne?\"\n\n\"No. I have not seen him since that early morning on Saturday when he\ncame to tell me that she had been arrested. Having sworn that he would\nobey me, he went to meet you and Tony at La Villette, but returned to\nParis a few hours later, and drew the undivided attention of all the\ncommittees on Jeanne Lange by his senseless, foolish inquiries. But\nfor his action throughout the whole of yesterday I could have smuggled\nJeanne out of Paris, got her to join you at Villette, or Hastings in St.\nGermain. But the barriers were being closely watched for her, and I had\nthe Dauphin to think of. She is in comparative safety; the people in\nthe Rue de Charonne are friendly for the moment; but for how long? Who\nknows? I must look after her of course. And Armand! Poor old Armand! The\nlion's jaws have snapped over him, and they hold him tight. Chauvelin\nand his gang are using him as a decoy to trap me, of course. All that\nhad not happened if Armand had trusted me.\"\n\nHe sighed a quick sigh of impatience, almost of regret. Ffoulkes was the\none man who could guess the bitter disappointment that this had meant.\nPercy had longed to be back in England soon, back to Marguerite, to a\nfew days of unalloyed happiness and a few days of peace.\n\nNow Armand's actions had retarded all that; they were a deliberate bar\nto the future as it had been mapped out by a man who foresaw everything,\nwho was prepared for every eventuality.\n\nIn this case, too, he had been prepared, but not for the want of trust\nwhich had brought on disobedience akin to disloyalty. That absolutely\nunforeseen eventuality had changed Blakeney's usual irresponsible gaiety\ninto a consciousness of the inevitable, of the inexorable decrees of\nFate.\n\nWith an anxious sigh, Sir Andrew turned away from his chief and went\nback to the spinney to select for his own purpose one of the three\nhorses which Hastings and Tony had unavoidably left behind.\n\n\"And you, Blakeney--how will you go back to that awful Paris?\" he said,\nwhen he had made his choice and was once more back beside Percy.\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" replied Blakeney, \"but it would not be safe to ride.\nI'll reach one of the gates on this side of the city and contrive to\nslip in somehow. I have a certificate of safety in my pocket in case I\nneed it.\n\n\"We'll leave the horses here,\" he said presently, whilst he was helping\nSir Andrew to put the horse in the shafts of the coal-cart; \"they cannot\ncome to much harm. Some poor devil might steal them, in order to escape\nfrom those vile brutes in the city. If so, God speed him, say I. I'll\ncompensate my friend the farmer of St. Germain for their loss at\nan early opportunity. And now, good-bye, my dear fellow! Some time\nto-night, if possible, you shall hear direct news of me--if not, then\nto-morrow or the day after that. Good-bye, and Heaven guard you!\"\n\n\"God guard you, Blakeney!\" said Sir Andrew fervently.\n\nHe jumped into the cart and gathered up the reins. His heart was heavy\nas lead, and a strange mist had gathered in his eyes, blurring the last\ndim vision which he had of his chief standing all alone in the gloom,\nhis broad, magnificent figure looking almost weirdly erect and defiant,\nhis head thrown back, and his kind, lazy eyes watching the final\ndeparture of his most faithful comrade and friend.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. OF THAT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION\n\nBlakeney had more than one pied-a-terre in Paris, and never stayed\nlonger than two or three days in any of these. It was not difficult for\na single man, be he labourer or bourgeois, to obtain a night's lodging,\neven in these most troublous times, and in any quarter of Paris,\nprovided the rent--out of all proportion to the comfort and\naccommodation given--was paid ungrudgingly and in advance.\n\nEmigration and, above all, the enormous death-roll of the past eighteen\nmonths, had emptied the apartment houses of the great city, and those\nwho had rooms to let were only too glad of a lodger, always providing\nthey were not in danger of being worried by the committees of their\nsection.\n\nThe laws framed by these same committees now demanded that all keepers\nof lodging or apartment houses should within twenty-four hours give\nnotice at the bureau of their individual sections of the advent of new\nlodgers, together with a description of the personal appearance of\nsuch lodgers, and an indication of their presumed civil status and\noccupation. But there was a margin of twenty-four hours, which could\non pressure be extended to forty-eight, and, therefore, any one could\nobtain shelter for forty-eight hours, and have no questions asked,\nprovided he or she was willing to pay the exorbitant sum usually asked\nunder the circumstances.\n\nThus Blakeney had no difficulty in securing what lodgings he wanted when\nhe once more found himself inside Paris at somewhere about noon of that\nsame Monday.\n\nThe thought of Hastings and Tony speeding on towards Mantes with the\nroyal child safely held in Hastings' arms had kept his spirits buoyant\nand caused him for a while to forget the terrible peril in which Armand\nSt. Just's thoughtless egoism had placed them both.\n\nBlakeney was a man of abnormal physique and iron nerve, else he could\nnever have endured the fatigues of the past twenty-four hours, from\nthe moment when on the Sunday afternoon he began to play his part of\nfurniture-remover at the Temple, to that when at last on Monday at noon\nhe succeeded in persuading the sergeant at the Maillot gate that he\nwas an honest stonemason residing at Neuilly, who was come to Paris in\nsearch of work.\n\nAfter that matters became more simple. Terribly foot-sore, though\nhe would never have admitted it, hungry and weary, he turned into an\nunpretentious eating-house and ordered some dinner. The place when he\nentered was occupied mostly by labourers and workmen, dressed very much\nas he was himself, and quite as grimy as he had become after having\ndriven about for hours in a laundry-cart and in a coal-cart, and having\nwalked twelve kilometres, some of which he had covered whilst carrying a\nsleeping child in his arms.\n\nThus, Sir Percy Blakeney, Bart., the friend and companion of the Prince\nof Wales, the most fastidious fop the salons of London and Bath had\never seen, was in no way distinguishable outwardly from the tattered,\nhalf-starved, dirty, and out-at-elbows products of this fraternising and\nequalising Republic.\n\nHe was so hungry that the ill-cooked, badly-served meal tempted him to\neat; and he ate on in silence, seemingly more interested in boiled beef\nthan in the conversation that went on around him. But he would not have\nbeen the keen and daring adventurer that he was if he did not all the\nwhile keep his ears open for any fragment of news that the desultory\ntalk of his fellow-diners was likely to yield to him.\n\nPolitics were, of course, discussed; the tyranny of the sections, the\nslavery that this free Republic had brought on its citizens. The\nnames of the chief personages of the day were all mentioned in turns\nFocquier-Tinville, Santerre, Danton, Robespierre. Heron and his\nsleuth-hounds were spoken of with execrations quickly suppressed, but of\nlittle Capet not one word.\n\nBlakeney could not help but infer that Chauvelin, Heron and the\ncommissaries in charge were keeping the escape of the child a secret for\nas long as they could.\n\nHe could hear nothing of Armand's fate, of course. The arrest--if arrest\nthere had been--was not like to be bruited abroad just now. Blakeney\nhaving last seen Armand in Chauvelin's company, whilst he himself was\nmoving the Simons' furniture, could not for a moment doubt that the\nyoung man was imprisoned,--unless, indeed, he was being allowed a\ncertain measure of freedom, whilst his every step was being spied on, so\nthat he might act as a decoy for his chief.\n\nAt thought of that all weariness seemed to vanish from Blakeney's\npowerful frame. He set his lips firmly together, and once again the\nlight of irresponsible gaiety danced in his eyes.\n\nHe had been in as tight a corner as this before now; at Boulogne his\nbeautiful Marguerite had been used as a decoy, and twenty-four hours\nlater he had held her in his arms on board his yacht the Day-Dream. As\nhe would have put it in his own forcible language:\n\n\"Those d--d murderers have not got me yet.\"\n\nThe battle mayhap would this time be against greater odds than before,\nbut Blakeney had no fear that they would prove overwhelming.\n\nThere was in life but one odd that was overwhelming, and that was\ntreachery.\n\nBut of that there could be no question.\n\nIn the afternoon Blakeney started off in search of lodgings for the\nnight. He found what would suit him in the Rue de l'Arcade, which\nwas equally far from the House of Justice as it was from his former\nlodgings. Here he would be safe for at least twenty-four hours, after\nwhich he might have to shift again. But for the moment the landlord\nof the miserable apartment was over-willing to make no fuss and ask\nno questions, for the sake of the money which this aristo in disguise\ndispensed with a lavish hand.\n\nHaving taken possession of his new quarters and snatched a few hours of\nsound, well-deserved rest, until the time when the shades of evening\nand the darkness of the streets would make progress through the city\nsomewhat more safe, Blakeney sallied forth at about six o'clock having a\nthreefold object in view.\n\nPrimarily, of course, the threefold object was concentrated on Armand.\nThere was the possibility of finding out at the young man's lodgings in\nMontmartre what had become of him; then there were the usual inquiries\nthat could be made from the registers of the various prisons; and,\nthirdly, there was the chance that Armand had succeeded in sending some\nkind of message to Blakeney's former lodgings in the Rue St. Germain\nl'Auxerrois.\n\nOn the whole, Sir Percy decided to leave the prison registers alone\nfor the present. If Armand had been actually arrested, he would almost\ncertainly be confined in the Chatelet prison, where he would be closer\nto hand for all the interrogatories to which, no doubt, he would be\nsubjected.\n\nBlakeney set his teeth and murmured a good, sound, British oath when\nhe thought of those interrogatories. Armand St. Just, highly strung,\na dreamer and a bundle of nerves--how he would suffer under the mental\nrack of questions and cross-questions, cleverly-laid traps to catch\ninformation from him unawares!\n\nHis next objective, then, was Armand's former lodging, and from\nsix o'clock until close upon eight Sir Percy haunted the slopes of\nMontmartre, and more especially the neighbourhood of the Rue de la Croix\nBlanche, where Armand had lodged these former days. At the house itself\nhe could not inquire as yet; obviously it would not have been safe;\ntomorrow, perhaps, when he knew more, but not tonight. His keen eyes had\nalready spied at least two figures clothed in the rags of out-of-work\nlabourers like himself, who had hung with suspicious persistence in this\nsame neighbourhood, and who during the two hours that he had been in\nobservation had never strayed out of sight of the house in the Rue de la\nCroix Blanche.\n\nThat these were two spies on the watch was, of course, obvious;\nbut whether they were on the watch for St. Just or for some other\nunfortunate wretch it was at this stage impossible to conjecture.\n\nThen, as from the Tour des Dames close by the clock solemnly struck the\nhour of eight, and Blakeney prepared to wend his way back to another\npart of the city, he suddenly saw Armand walking slowly up the street.\n\nThe young man did not look either to right or left; he held his head\nforward on his chest, and his hands were hidden underneath his cloak.\nWhen he passed immediately under one of the street lamps Blakeney caught\nsight of his face; it was pale and drawn. Then he turned his head,\nand for the space of two seconds his eyes across the narrow street\nencountered those of his chief. He had the presence of mind not to make\na sign or to utter a sound; he was obviously being followed, but in\nthat brief moment Sir Percy had seen in the young man's eyes a look that\nreminded him of a hunted creature.\n\n\"What have those brutes been up to with him, I wonder?\" he muttered\nbetween clenched teeth.\n\nArmand soon disappeared under the doorway of the same house where he\nhad been lodging all along. Even as he did so Blakeney saw the two spies\ngather together like a pair of slimy lizards, and whisper excitedly\none to another. A third man, who obviously had been dogging Armand's\nfootsteps, came up and joined them after a while.\n\nBlakeney could have sworn loudly and lustily, had it been possible to\ndo so without attracting attention. The whole of Armand's history in\nthe past twenty-four hours was perfectly clear to him. The young man had\nbeen made free that he might prove a decoy for more important game.\n\nHis every step was being watched, and he still thought Jeanne Lange in\nimmediate danger of death. The look of despair in his face proclaimed\nthese two facts, and Blakeney's heart ached for the mental torture which\nhis friend was enduring. He longed to let Armand know that the woman he\nloved was in comparative safety.\n\nJeanne Lange first, and then Armand himself; and the odds would be very\nheavy against the Scarlet Pimpernel! But that Marguerite should not have\nto mourn an only brother, of that Sir Percy made oath.\n\nHe now turned his steps towards his own former lodgings by St. Germain\nl'Auxerrois. It was just possible that Armand had succeeded in leaving a\nmessage there for him. It was, of course, equally possible that when he\ndid so Heron's men had watched his movements, and that spies would be\nstationed there, too, on the watch.\n\nBut that risk must, of course, be run. Blakeney's former lodging was the\none place that Armand would know of to which he could send a message to\nhis chief, if he wanted to do so. Of course, the unfortunate young man\ncould not have known until just now that Percy would come back to Paris,\nbut he might guess it, or wish it, or only vaguely hope for it; he\nmight want to send a message, he might long to communicate with his\nbrother-in-law, and, perhaps, feel sure that the latter would not leave\nhim in the lurch.\n\nWith that thought in his mind, Sir Percy was not likely to give up the\nattempt to ascertain for himself whether Armand had tried to communicate\nwith him or not. As for spies--well, he had dodged some of them often\nenough in his time--the risks that he ran to-night were no worse than\nthe ones to which he had so successfully run counter in the Temple\nyesterday.\n\nStill keeping up the slouchy gait peculiar to the out-at-elbows working\nman of the day, hugging the houses as he walked along the streets,\nBlakeney made slow progress across the city. But at last he reached the\nfacade of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, and turning sharply to his right he\nsoon came in sight of the house which he had only quitted twenty-four\nhours ago.\n\nWe all know that house--all of us who are familiar with the Paris of\nthose terrible days. It stands quite detached--a vast quadrangle,\nfacing the Quai de l'Ecole and the river, backing on the Rue St.\nGermain l'Auxerrois, and shouldering the Carrefour des Trois Manes.\nThe porte-cochere, so-called, is but a narrow doorway, and is actually\nsituated in the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois.\n\nBlakeney made his way cautiously right round the house; he peered up and\ndown the quay, and his keen eyes tried to pierce the dense gloom that\nhung at the corners of the Pont Neuf immediately opposite. Soon he\nassured himself that for the present, at any rate, the house was not\nbeing watched.\n\nArmand presumably had not yet left a message for him here; but he might\ndo so at any time now that he knew that his chief was in Paris and on\nthe look-out for him.\n\nBlakeney made up his mind to keep this house in sight. This art of\nwatching he had acquired to a masterly extent, and could have taught\nHeron's watch-dogs a remarkable lesson in it. At night, of course, it\nwas a comparatively easy task. There were a good many unlighted doorways\nalong the quay, whilst a street lamp was fixed on a bracket in the wall\nof the very house which he kept in observation.\n\nFinding temporary shelter under various doorways, or against the dank\nwalls of the houses, Blakeney set himself resolutely to a few hours'\nweary waiting. A thin, drizzly rain fell with unpleasant persistence,\nlike a damp mist, and the thin blouse which he wore soon became wet\nthrough and clung hard and chilly to his shoulders.\n\nIt was close on midnight when at last he thought it best to give up\nhis watch and to go back to his lodgings for a few hours' sleep; but at\nseven o'clock the next morning he was back again at his post.\n\nThe porte-cochere of his former lodging-house was not yet open; he\ntook up his stand close beside it. His woollen cap pulled well over his\nforehead, the grime cleverly plastered on his hair and face, his lower\njaw thrust forward, his eyes looking lifeless and bleary, all gave him\nan expression of sly villainy, whilst the short clay pipe struck at\na sharp angle in his mouth, his hands thrust into the pockets of his\nragged breeches, and his bare feet in the mud of the road, gave the\nfinal touch to his representation of an out-of-work, ill-conditioned,\nand supremely discontented loafer.\n\nHe had not very long to wait. Soon the porte-cochere of the house was\nopened, and the concierge came out with his broom, making a show of\ncleaning the pavement in front of the door. Five minutes later a lad,\nwhose clothes consisted entirely of rags, and whose feet and head were\nbare, came rapidly up the street from the quay, and walked along looking\nat the houses as he went, as if trying to decipher their number. The\ncold grey dawn was just breaking, dreary and damp, as all the past days\nhad been. Blakeney watched the lad as he approached, the small, naked\nfeet falling noiselessly on the cobblestones of the road. When the boy\nwas quite close to him and to the house, Blakeney shifted his position\nand took the pipe out of his mouth.\n\n\"Up early, my son!\" he said gruffly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the pale-faced little creature; \"I have a message to deliver\nat No. 9 Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois. It must be somewhere near here.\"\n\n\"It is. You can give me the message.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, citizen!\" said the lad, into whose pale, circled eyes a look of\nterror had quickly appeared. \"It is for one of the lodgers in No. 9. I\nmust give it to him.\"\n\nWith an instinct which he somehow felt could not err at this moment,\nBlakeney knew that the message was one from Armand to himself; a written\nmessage, too, since--instinctively when he spoke--the boy clutched at\nhis thin shirt, as if trying to guard something precious that had been\nentrusted to him.\n\n\"I will deliver the message myself, sonny,\" said Blakeney gruffly.\n\"I know the citizen for whom it is intended. He would not like the\nconcierge to see it.\"\n\n\"Oh! I would not give it to the concierge,\" said the boy. \"I would take\nit upstairs myself.\"\n\n\"My son,\" retorted Blakeney, \"let me tell you this. You are going to\ngive that message up to me and I will put five whole livres into your\nhand.\"\n\nBlakeney, with all his sympathy aroused for this poor pale-faced lad,\nput on the airs of a ruffianly bully. He did not wish that message to\nbe taken indoors by the lad, for the concierge might get hold of it,\ndespite the boy's protests and tears, and after that Blakeney would\nperforce have to disclose himself before it would be given up to him.\nDuring the past week the concierge had been very amenable to bribery.\nWhatever suspicions he had had about his lodger he had kept to himself\nfor the sake of the money which he received; but it was impossible to\ngauge any man's trend of thought these days from one hour to the next.\nSomething--for aught Blakeney knew--might have occurred in the past\ntwenty-four hours to change an amiable and accommodating lodging-house\nkeeper into a surly or dangerous spy.\n\nFortunately, the concierge had once more gone within; there was no one\nabroad, and if there were, no one probably would take any notice of a\nburly ruffian brow-beating a child.\n\n\"Allons!\" he said gruffly, \"give me the letter, or that five livres goes\nback into my pocket.\"\n\n\"Five livres!\" exclaimed the child with pathetic eagerness. \"Oh,\ncitizen!\"\n\nThe thin little hand fumbled under the rags, but it reappeared again\nempty, whilst a faint blush spread over the hollow cheeks.\n\n\"The other citizen also gave me five livres,\" he said humbly. \"He lodges\nin the house where my mother is concierge. It is in the Rue de la Croix\nBlanche. He has been very kind to my mother. I would rather do as he\nbade me.\"\n\n\"Bless the lad,\" murmured Blakeney under his breath; \"his loyalty\nredeems many a crime of this God-forsaken city. Now I suppose I shall\nhave to bully him, after all.\"\n\nHe took his hand out of his breeches pocket; between two very dirty\nfingers he held a piece of gold. The other hand he placed quite roughly\non the lad's chest.\n\n\"Give me the letter,\" he said harshly, \"or--\"\n\nHe pulled at the ragged blouse, and a scrap of soiled paper soon fell\ninto his hand. The lad began to cry.\n\n\"Here,\" said Blakeney, thrusting the piece of gold into the thin small\npalm, \"take this home to your mother, and tell your lodger that a big,\nrough man took the letter away from you by force. Now run, before I kick\nyou out of the way.\"\n\nThe lad, terrified out of his poor wits, did not wait for further\ncommands; he took to his heels and ran, his small hand clutching the\npiece of gold. Soon he had disappeared round the corner of the street.\n\nBlakeney did not at once read the paper; he thrust it quickly into his\nbreeches pocket and slouched away slowly down the street, and thence\nacross the Place du Carrousel, in the direction of his new lodgings in\nthe Rue de l'Arcade.\n\nIt was only when he found himself alone in the narrow, squalid room\nwhich he was occupying that he took the scrap of paper from his pocket\nand read it slowly through. It said:\n\n\n\nPercy, you cannot forgive me, nor can I ever forgive myself, but if you\nonly knew what I have suffered for the past two days you would, I think,\ntry and forgive. I am free and yet a prisoner; my every footstep is\ndogged. What they ultimately mean to do with me I do not know. And\nwhen I think of Jeanne I long for the power to end mine own miserable\nexistence. Percy! she is still in the hands of those fiends.... I saw\nthe prison register; her name written there has been like a burning\nbrand on my heart ever since. She was still in prison the day that you\nleft Paris; to-morrow, to-night mayhap, they will try her, condemn her,\ntorture her, and I dare not go to see you, for I would only be bringing\nspies to your door. But will you come to me, Percy? It should be safe in\nthe hours of the night, and the concierge is devoted to me. To-night at\nten o'clock she will leave the porte-cochere unlatched. If you find it\nso, and if on the ledge of the window immediately on your left as you\nenter you find a candle alight, and beside it a scrap of paper with your\ninitials S. P. traced on it, then it will be quite safe for you to come\nup to my room. It is on the second landing--a door on your right--that\ntoo I will leave on the latch. But in the name of the woman you love\nbest in all the world come at once to me then, and bear in mind, Percy,\nthat the woman I love is threatened with immediate death, and that I am\npowerless to save her. Indeed, believe me, I would gladly die even now\nbut for the thought of Jeanne, whom I should be leaving in the hands\nof those fiends. For God's sake, Percy, remember that Jeanne is all the\nworld to me.\n\n\n\n\"Poor old Armand,\" murmured Blakeney with a kindly smile directed at the\nabsent friend, \"he won't trust me even now. He won't trust his Jeanne in\nmy hands. Well,\" he added after a while, \"after all, I would not entrust\nMarguerite to anybody else either.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. THE OVERWHELMING ODDS\n\nAt half-past ten that same evening, Blakeney, still clad in a workman's\ntattered clothes, his feet bare so that he could tread the streets\nunheard, turned into the Rue de la Croix Blanche.\n\nThe porte-cochere of the house where Armand lodged had been left on the\nlatch; not a soul was in sight. Peering cautiously round, he slipped\ninto the house. On the ledge of the window, immediately on his left when\nhe entered, a candle was left burning, and beside it there was a scrap\nof paper with the initials S. P. roughly traced in pencil. No one\nchallenged him as he noiselessly glided past it, and up the narrow\nstairs that led to the upper floor. Here, too, on the second landing\nthe door on the right had been left on the latch. He pushed it open and\nentered.\n\nAs is usual even in the meanest lodgings in Paris houses, a small\nantechamber gave between the front door and the main room. When Percy\nentered the antechamber was unlighted, but the door into the inner room\nbeyond was ajar. Blakeney approached it with noiseless tread, and gently\npushed it open.\n\nThat very instant he knew that the game was up; he heard the footsteps\nclosing up behind him, saw Armand, deathly pale, leaning against the\nwall in the room in front of him, and Chauvelin and Heron standing guard\nover him.\n\nThe next moment the room and the antechamber were literally alive with\nsoldiers--twenty of them to arrest one man.\n\nIt was characteristic of that man that when hands were laid on him\nfrom every side he threw back his head and laughed--laughed mirthfully,\nlight-heartedly, and the first words that escaped his lips were:\n\n\"Well, I am d--d!\"\n\n\"The odds are against you, Sir Percy,\" said Chauvelin to him in\nEnglish, whilst Heron at the further end of the room was growling like a\ncontented beast.\n\n\"By the Lord, sir,\" said Percy with perfect sang-froid, \"I do believe\nthat for the moment they are.\"\n\n\"Have done, my men--have done!\" he added, turning good-humouredly to the\nsoldiers round him. \"I never fight against overwhelming odds. Twenty to\none, eh? I could lay four of you out easily enough, perhaps even six,\nbut what then?\"\n\nBut a kind of savage lust seemed to have rendered these men temporarily\nmad, and they were being egged on by Heron. The mysterious Englishman,\nabout whom so many eerie tales were told! Well, he had supernatural\npowers, and twenty to one might be nothing to him if the devil was on\nhis side. Therefore a blow on his forearm with the butt-end of a bayonet\nwas useful for disabling his right hand, and soon the left arm with a\ndislocated shoulder hung limp by his side. Then he was bound with cords.\n\nThe vein of luck had given out. The gambler had staked more than usual\nand had lost; but he knew how to lose, just as he had always known how\nto win.\n\n\"Those d--d brutes are trussing me like a fowl,\" he murmured with\nirrepressible gaiety at the last.\n\nThen the wrench on his bruised arms as they were pulled roughly back by\nthe cords caused the veil of unconsciousness to gather over his eyes.\n\n\"And Jeanne was safe, Armand,\" he shouted with a last desperate effort;\n\"those devils have lied to you and tricked you into this ... Since\nyesterday she is out of prison... in the house... you know....\"\n\nAfter that he lost consciousness.\n\n\n\nAnd this occurred on Tuesday, January 21st, in the year 1794, or, in\naccordance with the new calendar, on the 2nd Pluviose, year II of the\nRepublic.\n\nIt is chronicled in the Moniteur of the 3rd Pluviose that, \"on the\nprevious evening, at half-past ten of the clock, the Englishman known\nas the Scarlet Pimpernel, who for three years has conspired against the\nsafety of the Republic, was arrested through the patriotic exertions\nof citizen Chauvelin, and conveyed to the Conciergerie, where he now\nlies--sick, but closely guarded. Long live the Republic!\"\n\n\n\n\nPART II.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. THE NEWS\n\nThe grey January day was falling, drowsy, and dull into the arms of\nnight.\n\nMarguerite, sitting in the dusk beside the fire in her small boudoir,\nshivered a little as she drew her scarf closer round her shoulders.\n\nEdwards, the butler, entered with the lamp. The room looked peculiarly\ncheery now, with the delicate white panelling of the wall glowing under\nthe soft kiss of the flickering firelight and the steadier glow of the\nrose-shaded lamp.\n\n\"Has the courier not arrived yet, Edwards?\" asked Marguerite, fixing the\nimpassive face of the well-drilled servant with her large purple-rimmed\neyes.\n\n\"Not yet, m'lady,\" he replied placidly.\n\n\"It is his day, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, m'lady. And the forenoon is his time. But there have been heavy\nrains, and the roads must be rare muddy. He must have been delayed,\nm'lady.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so,\" she said listlessly. \"That will do, Edwards. No,\ndon't close the shutters. I'll ring presently.\"\n\nThe man went out of the room as automatically as he had come. He closed\nthe door behind him, and Marguerite was once more alone.\n\nShe picked up the book which she had fingered idly before the light gave\nout. She tried once more to fix her attention on this tale of love and\nadventure written by Mr. Fielding; but she had lost the thread of the\nstory, and there was a mist between her eyes and the printed pages.\n\nWith an impatient gesture she threw down the book and passed her hand\nacross her eyes, then seemed astonished to find that her hand was wet.\n\nShe rose and went to the window. The air outside had been singularly\nmild all day; the thaw was persisting, and a south wind came across the\nChannel--from France.\n\nMarguerite threw open the casement and sat down on the wide sill,\nleaning her head against the window-frame, and gazing out into the fast\ngathering gloom. From far away, at the foot of the gently sloping lawns,\nthe river murmured softly in the night; in the borders to the right and\nleft a few snowdrops still showed like tiny white specks through the\nsurrounding darkness. Winter had begun the process of slowly shedding\nits mantle, coquetting with Spring, who still lingered in the land of\nInfinity. Gradually the shadows drew closer and closer; the reeds and\nrushes on the river bank were the first to sink into their embrace, then\nthe big cedars on the lawn, majestic and defiant, but yielding still\nunconquered to the power of night.\n\nThe tiny stars of snowdrop blossoms vanished one by one, and at last the\ncool, grey ribbon of the river surface was wrapped under the mantle of\nevening.\n\nOnly the south wind lingered on, soughing gently in the drowsy reeds,\nwhispering among the branches of the cedars, and gently stirring the\ntender corollas of the sleeping snowdrops.\n\nMarguerite seemed to open out her lungs to its breath. It had come all\nthe way from France, and on its wings had brought something of Percy--a\nmurmur as if he had spoken--a memory that was as intangible as a dream.\n\nShe shivered again, though of a truth it was not cold. The courier's\ndelay had completely unsettled her nerves. Twice a week he came\nespecially from Dover, and always he brought some message, some token\nwhich Percy had contrived to send from Paris. They were like tiny scraps\nof dry bread thrown to a starving woman, but they did just help to keep\nher heart alive--that poor, aching, disappointed heart that so longed\nfor enduring happiness which it could never get.\n\nThe man whom she loved with all her soul, her mind and her body, did\nnot belong to her; he belonged to suffering humanity over there in\nterror-stricken France, where the cries of the innocent, the persecuted,\nthe wretched called louder to him than she in her love could do.\n\nHe had been away three months now, during which time her starving heart\nhad fed on its memories, and the happiness of a brief visit from him six\nweeks ago, when--quite unexpectedly--he had appeared before her... home\nbetween two desperate adventures that had given life and freedom to a\nnumber of innocent people, and nearly cost him his--and she had lain in\nhis arms in a swoon of perfect happiness.\n\nBut he had gone away again as suddenly as he had come, and for six weeks\nnow she had lived partly in anticipation of the courier with messages\nfrom him, and partly on the fitful joy engendered by these messages.\nTo-day she had not even that, and the disappointment seemed just now\nmore than she could bear.\n\nShe felt unaccountably restless, and could she but have analysed her\nfeelings--had she dared so to do--she would have realised that the\nweight which oppressed her heart so that she could hardly breathe, was\none of vague yet dark foreboding.\n\nShe closed the window and returned to her seat by the fire, taking up\nher hook with the strong resolution not to allow her nerves to get the\nbetter of her. But it was difficult to pin one's attention down to the\nadventures of Master Tom Jones when one's mind was fully engrossed with\nthose of Sir Percy Blakeney.\n\nThe sound of carriage wheels on the gravelled forecourt in the front of\nthe house suddenly awakened her drowsy senses. She threw down the book,\nand with trembling hands clutched the arms of her chair, straining\nher ears to listen. A carriage at this hour--and on this damp winter's\nevening! She racked her mind wondering who it could be.\n\nLady Ffoulkes was in London, she knew. Sir Andrew, of course, was in\nParis. His Royal Highness, ever a faithful visitor, would surely not\nventure out to Richmond in this inclement weather--and the courier\nalways came on horseback.\n\nThere was a murmur of voices; that of Edwards, mechanical and placid,\ncould be heard quite distinctly saying:\n\n\"I'm sure that her ladyship will be at home for you, m'lady. But I'll go\nand ascertain.\"\n\nMarguerite ran to the door and with joyful eagerness tore it open.\n\n\"Suzanne!\" she called \"my little Suzanne! I thought you were in London.\nCome up quickly! In the boudoir--yes. Oh! what good fortune hath brought\nyou?\"\n\nSuzanne flew into her arms, holding the friend whom she loved so well\nclose and closer to her heart, trying to hide her face, which was wet\nwith tears, in the folds of Marguerite's kerchief.\n\n\"Come inside, my darling,\" said Marguerite. \"Why, how cold your little\nhands are!\"\n\nShe was on the point of turning back to her boudoir, drawing Lady\nFfoulkes by the hand, when suddenly she caught sight of Sir Andrew, who\nstood at a little distance from her, at the top of the stairs.\n\n\"Sir Andrew!\" she exclaimed with unstinted gladness.\n\nThen she paused. The cry of welcome died on her lips, leaving them dry\nand parted. She suddenly felt as if some fearful talons had gripped her\nheart and were tearing at it with sharp, long nails; the blood flew from\nher cheeks and from her limbs, leaving her with a sense of icy numbness.\n\nShe backed into the room, still holding Suzanne's hand, and drawing her\nin with her. Sir Andrew followed them, then closed the door behind him.\nAt last the word escaped Marguerite's parched lips:\n\n\"Percy! Something has happened to him! He is dead?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" exclaimed Sir Andrew quickly.\n\nSuzanne put her loving arms round her friend and drew her down into the\nchair by the fire. She knelt at her feet on the hearthrug, and pressed\nher own burning lips on Marguerite's icy-cold hands. Sir Andrew stood\nsilently by, a world of loving friendship, of heart-broken sorrow, in\nhis eyes.\n\nThere was silence in the pretty white-panelled room for a while.\nMarguerite sat with her eyes closed, bringing the whole armoury of her\nwill power to bear her up outwardly now.\n\n\"Tell me!\" she said at last, and her voice was toneless and dull, like\none that came from the depths of a grave--\"tell me--exactly--everything.\nDon't be afraid. I can bear it. Don't be afraid.\"\n\nSir Andrew remained standing, with bowed head and one hand resting on\nthe table. In a firm, clear voice he told her the events of the past few\ndays as they were known to him. All that he tried to hide was Armand's\ndisobedience, which, in his heart, he felt was the primary cause of the\ncatastrophe. He told of the rescue of the Dauphin from the Temple, the\nmidnight drive in the coal-cart, the meeting with Hastings and Tony in\nthe spinney. He only gave vague explanations of Armand's stay in Paris\nwhich caused Percy to go back to the city, even at the moment when his\nmost daring plan had been so successfully carried through.\n\n\"Armand, I understand, has fallen in love with a beautiful woman in\nParis, Lady Blakeney,\" he said, seeing that a strange, puzzled look had\nappeared in Marguerite's pale face. \"She was arrested the day before the\nrescue of the Dauphin from the Temple. Armand could not join us. He felt\nthat he could not leave her. I am sure that you will understand.\"\n\nThen as she made no comment, he resumed his narrative:\n\n\"I had been ordered to go back to La Villette, and there to resume my\nduties as a labourer in the day-time, and to wait for Percy during the\nnight. The fact that I had received no message from him for two days had\nmade me somewhat worried, but I have such faith in him, such belief in\nhis good luck and his ingenuity, that I would not allow myself to be\nreally anxious. Then on the third day I heard the news.\"\n\n\"What news?\" asked Marguerite mechanically.\n\n\"That the Englishman who was known as the Scarlet Pimpernel had been\ncaptured in a house in the Rue de la Croix Blanche, and had been\nimprisoned in the Conciergerie.\"\n\n\"The Rue de la Croix Blanche? Where is that?\"\n\n\"In the Montmartre quarter. Armand lodged there. Percy, I imagine, was\nworking to get him away; and those brutes captured him.\"\n\n\"Having heard the news, Sir Andrew, what did you do?\"\n\n\"I went into Paris and ascertained its truth.\"\n\n\"And there is no doubt of it?\"\n\n\"Alas, none! I went to the house in the Rue de la Croix Blanche. Armand\nhad disappeared. I succeeded in inducing the concierge to talk. She\nseems to have been devoted to her lodger. Amidst tears she told me\nsome of the details of the capture. Can you bear to hear them, Lady\nBlakeney?\"\n\n\"Yes--tell me everything--don't be afraid,\" she reiterated with the same\ndull monotony.\n\n\"It appears that early on the Tuesday morning the son of the\nconcierge--a lad about fifteen--was sent off by her lodger with a\nmessage to No. 9 Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois. That was the house where\nPercy was staying all last week, where he kept disguises and so on\nfor us all, and where some of our meetings were held. Percy evidently\nexpected that Armand would try and communicate with him at that address,\nfor when the lad arrived in front of the house he was accosted--so\nhe says--by a big, rough workman, who browbeat him into giving up the\nlodger's letter, and finally pressed a piece of gold into his hand. The\nworkman was Blakeney, of course. I imagine that Armand, at the time that\nhe wrote the letter, must have been under the belief that Mademoiselle\nLange was still in prison; he could not know then that Blakeney had\nalready got her into comparative safety. In the letter he must have\nspoken of the terrible plight in which he stood, and also of his fears\nfor the woman whom he loved. Percy was not the man to leave a comrade\nin the lurch! He would not be the man whom we all love and admire, whose\nword we all obey, for whose sake we would gladly all of us give our\nlife--he would not be that man if he did not brave even certain dangers\nin order to be of help to those who call on him. Armand called and Percy\nwent to him. He must have known that Armand was being spied upon, for\nArmand, alas! was already a marked man, and the watch-dogs of\nthose infernal committees were already on his heels. Whether these\nsleuth-hounds had followed the son of the concierge and seen him give\nthe letter to the workman in the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois, or whether\nthe concierge in the Rue de la Croix Blanche was nothing but a spy of\nHeron's, or, again whether the Committee of General Security kept\na company of soldiers in constant alert in that house, we shall, of\ncourse, never know. All that I do know is that Percy entered that\nfatal house at half-past ten, and that a quarter of an hour later the\nconcierge saw some of the soldiers descending the stairs, carrying\na heavy burden. She peeped out of her lodge, and by the light in the\ncorridor she saw that the heavy burden was the body of a man bound\nclosely with ropes: his eyes were closed, his clothes were stained with\nblood. He was seemingly unconscious. The next day the official organ\nof the Government proclaimed the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and\nthere was a public holiday in honour of the event.\"\n\nMarguerite had listened to this terrible narrative dry-eyed and silent.\nNow she still sat there, hardly conscious of what went on around her--of\nSuzanne's tears, that fell unceasingly upon her fingers--of Sir Andrew,\nwho had sunk into a chair, and buried his head in his hands. She was\nhardly conscious that she lived; the universe seemed to have stood still\nbefore this awful, monstrous cataclysm.\n\nBut, nevertheless, she was the first to return to the active realities\nof the present.\n\n\"Sir Andrew,\" she said after a while, \"tell me, where are my Lords Tony\nand Hastings?\"\n\n\"At Calais, madam,\" he replied. \"I saw them there on my way hither.\nThey had delivered the Dauphin safely into the hands of his adherents at\nMantes, and were awaiting Blakeney's further orders, as he had commanded\nthem to do.\"\n\n\"Will they wait for us there, think you?\"\n\n\"For us, Lady Blakeney?\" he exclaimed in puzzlement.\n\n\"Yes, for us, Sir Andrew,\" she replied, whilst the ghost of a smile\nflitted across her drawn face; \"you had thought of accompanying me to\nParis, had you not?\"\n\n\"But Lady Blakeney--\"\n\n\"Ah! I know what you would say, Sir Andrew. You will speak of dangers,\nof risks, of death, mayhap; you will tell me that I as a woman can do\nnothing to help my husband--that I could be but a hindrance to him, just\nas I was in Boulogne. But everything is so different now. Whilst those\nbrutes planned his capture he was clever enough to outwit them, but now\nthey have actually got him, think you they'll let him escape? They'll\nwatch him night and day, my friend, just as they watched the unfortunate\nQueen; but they'll not keep him months, weeks, or even days in\nprison--even Chauvelin now will no longer attempt to play with the\nScarlet Pimpernel. They have him, and they will hold him until such time\nas they take him to the guillotine.\"\n\nHer voice broke in a sob; her self-control was threatening to leave her.\nShe was but a woman, young and passionately in love with the man who\nwas about to die an ignominious death, far away from his country, his\nkindred, his friends.\n\n\"I cannot let him die alone, Sir Andrew; he will be longing for me,\nand--and, after all, there is you, and my Lord Tony, and Lord Hastings\nand the others; surely--surely we are not going to let him die, not like\nthat, and not alone.\"\n\n\"You are right, Lady Blakeney,\" said Sir Andrew earnestly; \"we are not\ngoing to let him die, if human agency can do aught to save him. Already\nTony, Hastings and I have agreed to return to Paris. There are one or\ntwo hidden places in and around the city known only to Percy and to\nthe members of the League where he must find one or more of us if he\nsucceeds in getting away. All the way between Paris and Calais we have\nplaces of refuge, places where any of us can hide at a given moment;\nwhere we can find disguises when we want them, or horses in an\nemergency. No! no! we are not going to despair, Lady Blakeney; there are\nnineteen of us prepared to lay down our lives for the Scarlet Pimpernel.\nAlready I, as his lieutenant, have been selected as the leader of as\ndetermined a gang as has ever entered on a work of rescue before. We\nleave for Paris to-morrow, and if human pluck and devotion can destroy\nmountains then we'll destroy them. Our watchword is: 'God save the\nScarlet Pimpernel.'\"\n\nHe knelt beside her chair and kissed the cold fingers which, with a sad\nlittle smile, she held out to him.\n\n\"And God bless you all!\" she murmured.\n\nSuzanne had risen to her feet when her husband knelt; now he stood up\nbeside her. The dainty young woman hardly more than a child--was doing\nher best to restrain her tears.\n\n\"See how selfish I am,\" said Marguerite. \"I talk calmly of taking your\nhusband from you, when I myself know the bitterness of such partings.\"\n\n\"My husband will go where his duty calls him,\" said Suzanne with\ncharming and simple dignity. \"I love him with all my heart, because\nhe is brave and good. He could not leave his comrade, who is also his\nchief, in the lurch. God will protect him, I know. I would not ask him\nto play the part of a coward.\"\n\nHer brown eyes glowed with pride. She was the true wife of a soldier,\nand with all her dainty ways and childlike manners she was a splendid\nwoman and a staunch friend. Sir Percy Blakeney bad saved her entire\nfamily from death, the Comte and Comtesse de Tournai, the Vicomte, her\nbrother, and she herself all owed their lives to the Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nThis she was not like to forget.\n\n\"There is but little danger for us, I fear me,\" said Sir Andrew lightly;\n\"the revolutionary Government only wants to strike at a head, it cares\nnothing for the limbs. Perhaps it feels that without our leader we are\nenemies not worthy of persecution. If there are any dangers, so much\nthe better,\" he added; \"but I don't anticipate any, unless we succeed in\nfreeing our chief; and having freed him, we fear nothing more.\"\n\n\"The same applies to me, Sir Andrew,\" rejoined Marguerite earnestly.\n\"Now that they have captured Percy, those human fiends will care naught\nfor me. If you succeed in freeing Percy I, like you, will have nothing\nmore to fear, and if you fail--\"\n\nShe paused and put her small, white hand on Sir Andrew's arm.\n\n\"Take me with you, Sir Andrew,\" she entreated; \"do not condemn me to\nthe awful torture of weary waiting, day after day, wondering, guessing,\nnever daring to hope, lest hope deferred be more hard to bear than\ndreary hopelessness.\"\n\nThen as Sir Andrew, very undecided, yet half inclined to yield,\nstood silent and irresolute, she pressed her point, gently but firmly\ninsistent.\n\n\"I would not be in the way, Sir Andrew; I would know how to efface\nmyself so as not to interfere with your plans. But, oh!\" she added,\nwhile a quivering note of passion trembled in her voice, \"can't you\nsee that I must breathe the air that he breathes else I shall stifle or\nmayhap go mad?\"\n\nSir Andrew turned to his wife, a mute query in his eyes.\n\n\"You would do an inhuman and a cruel act,\" said Suzanne with seriousness\nthat sat quaintly on her baby face, \"if you did not afford your\nprotection to Marguerite, for I do believe that if you did not take her\nwith you to-morrow she would go to Paris alone.\"\n\nMarguerite thanked her friend with her eyes. Suzanne was a child\nin nature, but she had a woman's heart. She loved her husband, and,\ntherefore, knew and understood what Marguerite must be suffering now.\n\nSir Andrew no longer could resist the unfortunate woman's earnest\npleading. Frankly, he thought that if she remained in England while\nPercy was in such deadly peril she ran the grave risk of losing her\nreason before the terrible strain of suspense. He knew her to be a woman\nof courage, and one capable of great physical endurance; and really he\nwas quite honest when he said that he did not believe there would be\nmuch danger for the headless League of the Scarlet Pimpernel unless they\nsucceeded in freeing their chief. And if they did succeed, then indeed\nthere would be nothing to fear, for the brave and loving wife who, like\nevery true woman does, and has done in like circumstances since the\nbeginning of time, was only demanding with passionate insistence the\nright to share the fate, good or ill, of the man whom she loved.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. PARIS ONCE MORE\n\nSir Andrew had just come in. He was trying to get a little warmth into\nhis half-frozen limbs, for the cold had set in again, and this time with\nrenewed vigour, and Marguerite was pouring out a cup of hot coffee which\nshe had been brewing for him. She had not asked for news. She knew that\nhe had none to give her, else he had not worn that wearied, despondent\nlook in his kind face.\n\n\"I'll just try one more place this evening,\" he said as soon as he had\nswallowed some of the hot coffee--\"a restaurant in the Rue de la Harpe;\nthe members of the Cordeliers' Club often go there for supper, and they\nare usually well informed. I might glean something definite there.\"\n\n\"It seems very strange that they are so slow in bringing him to trial,\"\nsaid Marguerite in that dull, toneless voice which had become habitual\nto her. \"When you first brought me the awful news that... I made sure\nthat they would bring him to trial at once, and was in terror lest we\narrived here too late to--to see him.\"\n\nShe checked herself quickly, bravely trying to still the quiver of her\nvoice.\n\n\"And of Armand?\" she asked.\n\nHe shook his head sadly.\n\n\"With regard to him I am at a still greater loss,\" he said: \"I cannot\nfind his name on any of the prison registers, and I know that he is not\nin the Conciergerie. They have cleared out all the prisoners from there;\nthere is only Percy--\"\n\n\"Poor Armand!\" she sighed; \"it must be almost worse for him than for\nany of us; it was his first act of thoughtless disobedience that brought\nall this misery upon our heads.\"\n\nShe spoke sadly but quietly. Sir Andrew noted that there was no\nbitterness in her tone. But her very quietude was heart-breaking; there\nwas such an infinity of despair in the calm of her eyes.\n\n\"Well! though we cannot understand it all, Lady Blakeney,\" he said with\nforced cheerfulness, \"we must remember one thing--that whilst there is\nlife there is hope.\"\n\n\"Hope!\" she exclaimed with a world of pathos in her sigh, her large eyes\ndry and circled, fixed with indescribable sorrow on her friend's face.\n\nFfoulkes turned his head away, pretending to busy himself with\nthe coffee-making utensils. He could not bear to see that look of\nhopelessness in her face, for in his heart he could not find the\nwherewithal to cheer her. Despair was beginning to seize on him too, and\nthis he would not let her see.\n\nThey had been in Paris three days now, and it was six days since\nBlakeney had been arrested. Sir Andrew and Marguerite had found\ntemporary lodgings inside Paris, Tony and Hastings were just outside the\ngates, and all along the route between Paris and Calais, at St. Germain,\nat Mantes, in the villages between Beauvais and Amiens, wherever money\ncould obtain friendly help, members of the devoted League of the Scarlet\nPimpernel lay in hiding, waiting to aid their chief.\n\nFfoulkes had ascertained that Percy was kept a close prisoner in the\nConciergerie, in the very rooms occupied by Marie Antoinette during the\nlast months of her life. He left poor Marguerite to guess how closely\nthat elusive Scarlet Pimpernel was being guarded, the precautions\nsurrounding him being even more minute than those which bad made the\nunfortunate Queen's closing days a martyrdom for her.\n\nBut of Armand he could glean no satisfactory news, only the negative\nprobability that he was not detained in any of the larger prisons of\nParis, as no register which he, Ffoulkes, so laboriously consulted bore\nrecord of the name of St. Just.\n\nHaunting the restaurants and drinking booths where the most advanced\nJacobins and Terrorists were wont to meet, he had learned one or two\ndetails of Blakeney's incarceration which he could not possibly impart\nto Marguerite. The capture of the mysterious Englishman known as the\nScarlet Pimpernel had created a great deal of popular satisfaction;\nbut it was obvious that not only was the public mind not allowed to\nassociate that capture with the escape of little Capet from the Temple,\nbut it soon became clear to Ffoulkes that the news of that escape was\nstill being kept a profound secret.\n\nOn one occasion he had succeeded in spying on the Chief Agent of the\nCommittee of General Security, whom he knew by sight, while the latter\nwas sitting at dinner in the company of a stout, florid man with\npock-marked face and podgy hands covered with rings.\n\nSir Andrew marvelled who this man might be. Heron spoke to him in\nambiguous phrases that would have been unintelligible to any one who did\nnot know the circumstances of the Dauphin's escape and the part that\nthe League of the Scarlet Pimpernel had played in it. But to Sir Andrew\nFfoulkes, who--cleverly disguised as a farrier, grimy after his day's\nwork--was straining his ears to listen whilst apparently consuming huge\nslabs of boiled beef, it soon became clear that the chief agent and his\nfat friend were talking of the Dauphin and of Blakeney.\n\n\"He won't hold out much longer, citizen,\" the chief agent was saying in\na confident voice; \"our men are absolutely unremitting in their task.\nTwo of them watch him night and day; they look after him well, and\npractically never lose sight of him, but the moment he tries to get any\nsleep one of them rushes into the cell with a loud banging of bayonet\nand sabre, and noisy tread on the flagstones, and shouts at the top of\nhis voice: 'Now then, aristo, where's the brat? Tell us now, and you\nshall be down and go to sleep.' I have done it myself all through one\nday just for the pleasure of it. It's a little tiring for you to have to\nshout a good deal now, and sometimes give the cursed Englishman a good\nshake-up. He has had five days of it, and not one wink of sleep during\nthat time--not one single minute of rest--and he only gets enough food\nto keep him alive. I tell you he can't last. Citizen Chauvelin had a\nsplendid idea there. It will all come right in a day or two.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" grunted the other sulkily; \"those Englishmen are tough.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" retorted Heron with a grim laugh and a leer of savagery that made\nhis gaunt face look positively hideous--\"you would have given out after\nthree days, friend de Batz, would you not? And I warned you, didn't I? I\ntold you if you tampered with the brat I would make you cry in mercy to\nme for death.\"\n\n\"And I warned you,\" said the other imperturbably, \"not to worry so much\nabout me, but to keep your eyes open for those cursed Englishmen.\"\n\n\"I am keeping my eyes open for you, nevertheless, my friend. If I\nthought you knew where the vermin's spawn was at this moment I would--\"\n\n\"You would put me on the same rack that you or your precious friend,\nChauvelin, have devised for the Englishman. But I don't know where the\nlad is. If I did I would not be in Paris.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" assented Heron with a sneer; \"you would soon be after the\nreward--over in Austria, what?--but I have your movements tracked day\nand night, my friend. I dare say you are as anxious as we are as to the\nwhereabouts of the child. Had he been taken over the frontier you would\nhave been the first to hear of it, eh? No,\" he added confidently, and\nas if anxious to reassure himself, \"my firm belief is that the original\nidea of these confounded Englishmen was to try and get the child over\nto England, and that they alone know where he is. I tell you it won't\nbe many days before that very withered Scarlet Pimpernel will order\nhis followers to give little Capet up to us. Oh! they are hanging about\nParis some of them, I know that; citizen Chauvelin is convinced that the\nwife isn't very far away. Give her a sight of her husband now, say I,\nand she'll make the others give the child up soon enough.\"\n\nThe man laughed like some hyena gloating over its prey. Sir Andrew\nnearly betrayed himself then. He had to dig his nails into his own flesh\nto prevent himself from springing then and there at the throat of that\nwretch whose monstrous ingenuity had invented torture for the fallen\nenemy far worse than any that the cruelties of medieval Inquisitions had\ndevised.\n\nSo they would not let him sleep! A simple idea born in the brain of a\nfiend. Heron had spoken of Chauvelin as the originator of the devilry;\na man weakened deliberately day by day by insufficient food, and the\nhorrible process of denying him rest. It seemed inconceivable that\nhuman, sentient beings should have thought of such a thing. Perspiration\nstood up in beads on Sir Andrew's brow when he thought of his friend,\nbrought down by want of sleep to--what? His physique was splendidly\npowerful, but could it stand against such racking torment for long? And\nthe clear, the alert mind, the scheming brain, the reckless daring--how\nsoon would these become enfeebled by the slow, steady torture of an\nutter want of rest?\n\nFfoulkes had to smother a cry of horror, which surely must have drawn\nthe attention of that fiend on himself had he not been so engrossed in\nthe enjoyment of his own devilry. As it is, he ran out of the stuffy\neating-house, for he felt as if its fetid air must choke him.\n\nFor an hour after that he wandered about the streets, not daring to face\nMarguerite, lest his eyes betrayed some of the horror which was shaking\nhis very soul.\n\nThat was twenty-four hours ago. To-day he had learnt little else. It was\ngenerally known that the Englishman was in the Conciergerie prison, that\nhe was being closely watched, and that his trial would come on within\nthe next few days; but no one seemed to know exactly when. The public\nwas getting restive, demanding that trial and execution to which every\none seemed to look forward as to a holiday. In the meanwhile the escape\nof the Dauphin had been kept from the knowledge of the public; Heron and\nhis gang, fearing for their lives, had still hopes of extracting from\nthe Englishman the secret of the lad's hiding-place, and the means they\nemployed for arriving at this end was worthy of Lucifer and his host of\ndevils in hell.\n\nFrom other fragments of conversation which Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had\ngleaned that same evening, it seemed to him that in order to hide their\ndefalcations Heron and the four commissaries in charge of little Capet\nhad substituted a deaf and dumb child for the escaped little prisoner.\nThis miserable small wreck of humanity was reputed to be sick and kept\nin a darkened room, in bed, and was in that condition exhibited to any\nmember of the Convention who had the right to see him. A partition had\nbeen very hastily erected in the inner room once occupied by the Simons,\nand the child was kept behind that partition, and no one was allowed to\ncome too near to him. Thus the fraud was succeeding fairly well. Heron\nand his accomplices only cared to save their skins, and the wretched\nlittle substitute being really ill, they firmly hoped that he would\nsoon die, when no doubt they would bruit abroad the news of the death of\nCapet, which would relieve them of further responsibility.\n\nThat such ideas, such thoughts, such schemes should have engendered in\nhuman minds it is almost impossible to conceive, and yet we know from\nno less important a witness than Madame Simon herself that the child who\ndied in the Temple a few weeks later was a poor little imbecile, a deaf\nand dumb child brought hither from one of the asylums and left to die in\npeace. There was nobody but kindly Death to take him out of his misery,\nfor the giant intellect that had planned and carried out the rescue of\nthe uncrowned King of France, and which alone might have had the power\nto save him too, was being broken on the rack of enforced sleeplessness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. THE BITTEREST FOE\n\nThat same evening Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, having announced his intention\nof gleaning further news of Armand, if possible, went out shortly after\nseven o'clock, promising to be home again about nine.\n\nMarguerite, on the other hand, had to make her friend a solemn promise\nthat she would try and eat some supper which the landlady of these\nmiserable apartments had agreed to prepare for her. So far they had been\nleft in peaceful occupation of these squalid lodgings in a tumble-down\nhouse on the Quai de la Ferraille, facing the house of Justice, the grim\nwalls of which Marguerite would watch with wide-open dry eyes for as\nlong as the grey wintry light lingered over them.\n\nEven now, though the darkness had set in, and snow, falling in close,\nsmall flakes, threw a thick white veil over the landscape, she sat at\nthe open window long after Sir Andrew had gone out, watching the few\nsmall flicks of light that blinked across from the other side of the\nriver, and which came from the windows of the Chatelet towers. The\nwindows of the Conciergerie she could not see, for these gave on one of\nthe inner courtyards; but there was a melancholy consolation even in the\ngazing on those walls that held in their cruel, grim embrace all that\nshe loved in the world.\n\nIt seemed so impossible to think of Percy--the laughter-loving,\nirresponsible, light-hearted adventurer--as the prey of those fiends who\nwould revel in their triumph, who would crush him, humiliate him, insult\nhim--ye gods alive! even torture him, perhaps--that they might break the\nindomitable spirit that would mock them even on the threshold of death.\n\nSurely, surely God would never allow such monstrous infamy as the\ndeliverance of the noble soaring eagle into the hands of those preying\njackals! Marguerite--though her heart ached beyond what human nature\ncould endure, though her anguish on her husband's account was doubled by\nthat which she felt for her brother--could not bring herself to give\nup all hope. Sir Andrew said it rightly; while there was life there\nwas hope. While there was life in those vigorous limbs, spirit in that\ndaring mind, how could puny, rampant beasts gain the better of the\nimmortal soul? As for Armand--why, if Percy were free she would have no\ncause to fear for Armand.\n\nShe sighed a sigh of deep, of passionate regret and longing. If she\ncould only see her husband; if she could only look for one second into\nthose laughing, lazy eyes, wherein she alone knew how to fathom the\ninfinity of passion that lay within their depths; if she could but once\nfeel his--ardent kiss on her lips, she could more easily endure this\nagonising suspense, and wait confidently and courageously for the issue.\n\nShe turned away from the window, for the night was getting bitterly\ncold. From the tower of St. Germain l'Auxerrois the clock slowly struck\neight. Even as the last sound of the historic bell died away in the\ndistance she heard a timid knocking at the door.\n\n\"Enter!\" she called unthinkingly.\n\nShe thought it was her landlady, come up with more wood, mayhap, for\nthe fire, so she did not turn to the door when she heard it being slowly\nopened, then closed again, and presently a soft tread on the threadbare\ncarpet.\n\n\"May I crave your kind attention, Lady Blakeney?\" said a harsh voice,\nsubdued to tones of ordinary courtesy.\n\nShe quickly repressed a cry of terror. How well she knew that voice!\nWhen last she heard it it was at Boulogne, dictating that infamous\nletter--the weapon wherewith Percy had so effectually foiled his enemy.\nShe turned and faced the man who was her bitterest foe--hers in the\nperson of the man she loved.\n\n\"Chauvelin!\" she gasped.\n\n\"Himself at your service, dear lady,\" he said simply.\n\nHe stood in the full light of the lamp, his trim, small figure boldly\ncut out against the dark wall beyond. He wore the usual sable-coloured\nclothes which he affected, with the primly-folded jabot and cuffs edged\nwith narrow lace.\n\nWithout waiting for permission from her he quietly and deliberately\nplaced his hat and cloak on a chair. Then he turned once more\ntoward her, and made a movement as if to advance into the room; but\ninstinctively she put up a hand as if to ward off the calamity of his\napproach.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and the shadow of a smile, that had neither\nmirth nor kindliness in it, hovered round the corners of his thin lips.\n\n\"Have I your permission to sit?\" he asked.\n\n\"As you will,\" she replied slowly, keeping her wide-open eyes fixed\nupon him as does a frightened bird upon the serpent whom it loathes and\nfears.\n\n\"And may I crave a few moments of your undivided attention, Lady\nBlakeney?\" he continued, taking a chair, and so placing it beside the\ntable that the light of the lamp when he sat remained behind him and his\nface was left in shadow.\n\n\"Is it necessary?\" asked Marguerite.\n\n\"It is,\" he replied curtly, \"if you desire to see and speak with your\nhusband--to be of use to him before it is too late.\"\n\n\"Then, I pray you, speak, citizen, and I will listen.\"\n\nShe sank into a chair, not heeding whether the light of the lamp fell\non her face or not, whether the lines in her haggard cheeks, or her\ntear-dimmed eyes showed plainly the sorrow and despair that had traced\nthem. She had nothing to hide from this man, the cause of all the\ntortures which she endured. She knew that neither courage nor sorrow\nwould move him, and that hatred for Percy--personal deadly hatred for\nthe man who had twice foiled him--had long crushed the last spark of\nhumanity in his heart.\n\n\"Perhaps, Lady Blakeney,\" he began after a slight pause and in his\nsmooth, even voice, \"it would interest you to hear how I succeeded in\nprocuring for myself this pleasure of an interview with you?\"\n\n\"Your spies did their usual work, I suppose,\" she said coldly.\n\n\"Exactly. We have been on your track for three days, and yesterday\nevening an unguarded movement on the part of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes gave us\nthe final clue to your whereabouts.\"\n\n\"Of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes?\" she asked, greatly puzzled.\n\n\"He was in an eating-house, cleverly disguised, I own, trying to glean\ninformation, no doubt as to the probable fate of Sir Percy Blakeney.\nAs chance would have it, my friend Heron, of the Committee of\nGeneral Security, chanced to be discussing with reprehensible\nopenness--er--certain--what shall I say?--certain measures which, at my\nadvice, the Committee of Public Safety have been forced to adopt with a\nview to--\"\n\n\"A truce on your smooth-tongued speeches, citizen Chauvelin,\" she\ninterposed firmly. \"Sir Andrew Ffoulkes has told me naught of this--so I\npray you speak plainly and to the point, if you can.\"\n\nHe bowed with marked irony.\n\n\"As you please,\" he said. \"Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, hearing certain matters\nof which I will tell you anon, made a movement which betrayed him to\none of our spies. At a word from citizen Heron this man followed on\nthe heels of the young farrier who had shown such interest in the\nconversation of the Chief Agent. Sir Andrew, I imagine, burning with\nindignation at what he had heard, was perhaps not quite so cautious as\nhe usually is. Anyway, the man on his track followed him to this door.\nIt was quite simple, as you see. As for me, I had guessed a week ago\nthat we would see the beautiful Lady Blakeney in Paris before long. When\nI knew where Sir Andrew Ffoulkes lodged, I had no difficulty in guessing\nthat Lady Blakeney would not be far off.\"\n\n\"And what was there in citizen Heron's conversation last night,\" she\nasked quietly, \"that so aroused Sir Andrew's indignation?\"\n\n\"He has not told you?\" \"Oh! it is very simple. Let me tell you, Lady\nBlakeney, exactly how matters stand. Sir Percy Blakeney--before lucky\nchance at last delivered him into our hands--thought fit, as no doubt\nyou know, to meddle with our most important prisoner of State.\"\n\n\"A child. I know it, sir--the son of a murdered father whom you and your\nfriends were slowly doing to death.\"\n\n\"That is as it may be, Lady Blakeney,\" rejoined Chauvelin calmly; \"but\nit was none of Sir Percy Blakeney's business. This, however, he chose\nto disregard. He succeeded in carrying little Capet from the Temple, and\ntwo days later we had him under lock, and key.\"\n\n\"Through some infamous and treacherous trick, sir,\" she retorted.\n\nChauvelin made no immediate reply; his pale, inscrutable eyes were fixed\nupon her face, and the smile of irony round his mouth appeared more\nstrongly marked than before.\n\n\"That, again, is as it may be,\" he said suavely; \"but anyhow for the\nmoment we have the upper hand. Sir Percy is in the Conciergerie, guarded\nday and night, more closely than Marie Antoinette even was guarded.\"\n\n\"And he laughs at your bolts and bars, sir,\" she rejoined proudly.\n\"Remember Calais, remember Boulogne. His laugh at your discomfiture,\nthen, must resound in your ear even to-day.\"\n\n\"Yes; but for the moment laughter is on our side. Still we are willing\nto forego even that pleasure, if Sir Percy will but move a finger\ntowards his own freedom.\"\n\n\"Again some infamous letter?\" she asked with bitter contempt; \"some\nattempt against his honour?\"\n\n\"No, no, Lady Blakeney,\" he interposed with perfect blandness. \"Matters\nare so much simpler now, you see. We hold Sir Percy at our mercy.\nWe could send him to the guillotine to-morrow, but we might be\nwilling--remember, I only say we might--to exercise our prerogative of\nmercy if Sir Percy Blakeney will on his side accede to a request from\nus.\"\n\n\"And that request?\"\n\n\"Is a very natural one. He took Capet away from us, and it is but\ncredible that he knows at the present moment exactly where the child is.\nLet him instruct his followers--and I mistake not, Lady Blakeney, there\nare several of them not very far from Paris just now--let him, I say,\ninstruct these followers of his to return the person of young Capet to\nus, and not only will we undertake to give these same gentlemen a safe\nconduct back to England, but we even might be inclined to deal somewhat\nless harshly with the gallant Scarlet Pimpernel himself.\"\n\nShe laughed a harsh, mirthless, contemptuous laugh.\n\n\"I don't think that I quite understand,\" she said after a moment or\ntwo, whilst he waited calmly until her out-break of hysterical mirth\nhad subsided. \"You want my husband--the Scarlet Pimpernel, citizen--to\ndeliver the little King of France to you after he has risked his life\nto save the child out of your clutches? Is that what you are trying to\nsay?\"\n\n\"It is,\" rejoined Chauvelin complacently, \"just what we have been saying\nto Sir Percy Blakeney for the past six days, madame.\"\n\n\"Well! then you have had your answer, have you not?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied slowly; \"but the answer has become weaker day by day.\"\n\n\"Weaker? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Let me explain, Lady Blakeney,\" said Chauvelin, now with measured\nemphasis. He put both elbows on the table and leaned well forward,\npeering into her face, lest one of its varied expressions escaped\nhim. \"Just now you taunted me with my failure in Calais, and again\nat Boulogne, with a proud toss of the head, which I own is excessive\nbecoming; you threw the name of the Scarlet Pimpernel in my face like a\nchallenge which I no longer dare to accept. 'The Scarlet Pimpernel,' you\nwould say to me, 'stands for loyalty, for honour, and for indomitable\ncourage. Think you he would sacrifice his honour to obtain your mercy?\nRemember Boulogne and your discomfiture!' All of which, dear lady, is\nperfectly charming and womanly and enthusiastic, and I, bowing my humble\nhead, must own that I was fooled in Calais and baffled in Boulogne.\nBut in Boulogne I made a grave mistake, and one from which I learned a\nlesson, which I am putting into practice now.\"\n\nHe paused a while as if waiting for her reply. His pale, keen eyes\nhad already noted that with every phrase he uttered the lines in her\nbeautiful face became more hard and set. A look of horror was gradually\nspreading over it, as if the icy-cold hand of death had passed over her\neyes and cheeks, leaving them rigid like stone.\n\n\"In Boulogne,\" resumed Chauvelin quietly, satisfied that his words were\nhitting steadily at her heart--\"in Boulogne Sir Percy and I did\nnot fight an equal fight. Fresh from a pleasant sojourn in his own\nmagnificent home, full of the spirit of adventure which puts the essence\nof life into a man's veins, Sir Percy Blakeney's splendid physique was\npitted against my feeble powers. Of course I lost the battle. I made the\nmistake of trying to subdue a man who was in the zenith of his strength,\nwhereas now--\"\n\n\"Yes, citizen Chauvelin,\" she said, \"whereas now--\"\n\n\"Sir Percy Blakeney has been in the prison of the Conciergerie for\nexactly one week, Lady Blakeney,\" he replied, speaking very slowly, and\nletting every one of his words sink individually into her mind. \"Even\nbefore he had time to take the bearings of his cell or to plan on his\nown behalf one of those remarkable escapes for which he is so justly\nfamous, our men began to work on a scheme which I am proud to say\noriginated with myself. A week has gone by since then, Lady Blakeney,\nand during that time a special company of prison guard, acting under the\norders of the Committee of General Security and of Public Safety, have\nquestioned the prisoner unremittingly--unremittingly, remember--day and\nnight. Two by two these men take it in turns to enter the prisoner's\ncell every quarter of an hour--lately it has had to be more often--and\nask him the one question, 'Where is little Capet?' Up to now we have\nreceived no satisfactory reply, although we have explained to Sir Percy\nthat many of his followers are honouring the neighbourhood of Paris with\ntheir visit, and that all we ask for from him are instructions to\nthose gallant gentlemen to bring young Capet back to us. It is all very\nsimple, unfortunately the prisoner is somewhat obstinate. At first,\neven, the idea seemed to amuse him; he used to laugh and say that he\nalways had the faculty of sleeping with his eyes open. But our soldiers\nare untiring in their efforts, and the want of sleep as well as of a\nsufficiency of food and of fresh air is certainly beginning to tell on\nSir Percy Blakeney's magnificent physique. I don't think that it will be\nvery long before he gives way to our gentle persuasions; and in any case\nnow, I assure you, dear lady, that we need not fear any attempt on\nhis part to escape. I doubt if he could walk very steadily across this\nroom--\"\n\nMarguerite had sat quite silent and apparently impassive all the while\nthat Chauvelin had been speaking; even now she scarcely stirred. Her\nface expressed absolutely nothing but deep puzzlement. There was a frown\nbetween her brows, and her eyes, which were always of such liquid\nblue, now looked almost black. She was trying to visualise that which\nChauvelin had put before her: a man harassed day and night, unceasingly,\nunremittingly, with one question allowed neither respite nor sleep--his\nbrain, soul, and body fagged out at every hour, every moment of the day\nand night, until mind and body and soul must inevitably give way under\nanguish ten thousand times more unendurable than any physical torment\ninvented by monsters in barbaric times.\n\nThat man thus harassed, thus fagged out, thus martyrised at all hours of\nthe day and night, was her husband, whom she loved with every fibre of\nher being, with every throb of her heart.\n\nTorture? Oh, no! these were advanced and civilised times that could\nafford to look with horror on the excesses of medieval days. This was\na revolution that made for progress, and challenged the opinion of the\nworld. The cells of the Temple of La Force or the Conciergerie held no\nsecret inquisition with iron maidens and racks and thumbscrews; but\na few men had put their tortuous brains together, and had said one to\nanother: \"We want to find out from that man where we can lay our hands\non little Capet, so we won't let him sleep until he has told us. It\nis not torture--oh, no! Who would dare to say that we torture our\nprisoners? It is only a little horseplay, worrying to the prisoner, no\ndoubt; but, after all, he can end the unpleasantness at any moment. He\nneed but to answer our question, and he can go to sleep as comfortably\nas a little child. The want of sleep is very trying, the want of proper\nfood and of fresh air is very weakening; the prisoner must give way\nsooner or later--\"\n\nSo these fiends had decided it between them, and they had put their idea\ninto execution for one whole week. Marguerite looked at Chauvelin as she\nwould on some monstrous, inscrutable Sphinx, marveling if God--even in\nHis anger--could really have created such a fiendish brain, or, having\ncreated it, could allow it to wreak such devilry unpunished.\n\nEven now she felt that he was enjoying the mental anguish which he had\nput upon her, and she saw his thin, evil lips curled into a smile.\n\n\"So you came to-night to tell me all this?\" she asked as soon as\nshe could trust herself to speak. Her impulse was to shriek out her\nindignation, her horror of him, into his face. She longed to call down\nGod's eternal curse upon this fiend; but instinctively she held herself\nin check. Her indignation, her words of loathing would only have added\nto his delight.\n\n\"You have had your wish,\" she added coldly; \"now, I pray you, go.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, Lady Blakeney,\" he said with all his habitual blandness;\n\"my object in coming to see you tonight was twofold. Methought that I\nwas acting as your friend in giving you authentic news of Sir Percy, and\nin suggesting the possibility of your adding your persuasion to ours.\"\n\n\"My persuasion? You mean that I--\"\n\n\"You would wish to see your husband, would you not, Lady Blakeney?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I pray you command me. I will grant you the permission whenever\nyou wish to go.\"\n\n\"You are in the hope, citizen,\" she said, \"that I will do my best to\nbreak my husband's spirit by my tears or my prayers--is that it?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" he replied pleasantly. \"I assure you that we can\nmanage to do that ourselves, in time.\"\n\n\"You devil!\" The cry of pain and of horror was involuntarily wrung from\nthe depths of her soul. \"Are you not afraid that God's hand will strike\nyou where you stand?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said lightly; \"I am not afraid, Lady Blakeney. You see, I do\nnot happen to believe in God. Come!\" he added more seriously, \"have I\nnot proved to you that my offer is disinterested? Yet I repeat it even\nnow. If you desire to see Sir Percy in prison, command me, and the doors\nshall be open to you.\"\n\nShe waited a moment, looking him straight and quite dispassionately in\nthe face; then she said coldly:\n\n\"Very well! I will go.\"\n\n\"When?\" he asked.\n\n\"This evening.\"\n\n\"Just as you wish. I would have to go and see my friend Heron first, and\narrange with him for your visit.\"\n\n\"Then go. I will follow in half an hour.\"\n\n\"C'est entendu. Will you be at the main entrance of the Conciergerie\nat half-past nine? You know it, perhaps--no? It is in the Rue de la\nBarillerie, immediately on the right at the foot of the great staircase\nof the house of Justice.\"\n\n\"Of the house of Justice!\" she exclaimed involuntarily, a world of\nbitter contempt in her cry. Then she added in her former matter-of-fact\ntones:\n\n\"Very good, citizen. At half-past nine I will be at the entrance you\nname.\"\n\n\"And I will be at the door prepared to escort you.\"\n\nHe took up his hat and coat and bowed ceremoniously to her. Then he\nturned to go. At the door a cry from her--involuntarily enough, God\nknows!--made him pause.\n\n\"My interview with the prisoner,\" she said, vainly trying, poor soul! to\nrepress that quiver of anxiety in her voice, \"it will be private?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! Of course,\" he replied with a reassuring smile. \"Au revoir,\nLady Blakeney! Half-past nine, remember--\"\n\nShe could no longer trust herself to look on him as he finally took his\ndeparture. She was afraid--yes, absolutely afraid that her fortitude\nwould give way--meanly, despicably, uselessly give way; that she would\nsuddenly fling herself at the feet of that sneering, inhuman wretch,\nthat she would pray, implore--Heaven above! what might she not do in\nthe face of this awful reality, if the last lingering shred of vanishing\nreason, of pride, and of courage did not hold her in check?\n\nTherefore she forced herself not to look on that departing, sable-clad\nfigure, on that evil face, and those hands that held Percy's fate\nin their cruel grip; but her ears caught the welcome sound of his\ndeparture--the opening and shutting of the door, his light footstep\nechoing down the stone stairs.\n\nWhen at last she felt that she was really alone she uttered a loud cry\nlike a wounded doe, and falling on her knees she buried her face in\nher hands in a passionate fit of weeping. Violent sobs shook her entire\nframe; it seemed as if an overwhelming anguish was tearing at her\nheart--the physical pain of it was almost unendurable. And yet even\nthrough this paroxysm of tears her mind clung to one root idea: when she\nsaw Percy she must be brave and calm, be able to help him if he wanted\nher, to do his bidding if there was anything that she could do, or any\nmessage that she could take to the others. Of hope she had none. The\nlast lingering ray of it had been extinguished by that fiend when he\nsaid, \"We need not fear that he will escape. I doubt if he could walk\nvery steadily across this room now.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. IN THE CONCIERGERIE\n\nMarguerite, accompanied by Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, walked rapidly along\nthe quay. It lacked ten minutes to the half hour; the night was dark and\nbitterly cold. Snow was still falling in sparse, thin flakes, and lay\nlike a crisp and glittering mantle over the parapets of the bridges and\nthe grim towers of the Chatelet prison.\n\nThey walked on silently now. All that they had wanted to say to one\nanother had been said inside the squalid room of their lodgings when Sir\nAndrew Ffoulkes had come home and learned that Chauvelin had been.\n\n\"They are killing him by inches, Sir Andrew,\" had been the heartrending\ncry which burst from Marguerite's oppressed heart as soon as her hands\nrested in the kindly ones of her best friend. \"Is there aught that we\ncan do?\"\n\nThere was, of course, very little that could be done. One or two fine\nsteel files which Sir Andrew gave her to conceal beneath the folds of\nher kerchief; also a tiny dagger with sharp, poisoned blade, which for a\nmoment she held in her hand hesitating, her eyes filling with tears, her\nheart throbbing with unspeakable sorrow.\n\nThen slowly--very slowly--she raised the small, death-dealing instrument\nto her lips, and reverently kissed the narrow blade.\n\n\"If it must be!\" she murmured, \"God in His mercy will forgive!\"\n\nShe sheathed the dagger, and this, too, she hid in the folds of her\ngown.\n\n\"Can you think of anything else, Sir Andrew, that he might want?\" she\nasked. \"I have money in plenty, in case those soldiers--\"\n\nSir Andrew sighed, and turned away from her so as to hide the\nhopelessness which he felt. Since three days now he had been exhausting\nevery conceivable means of getting at the prison guard with bribery\nand corruption. But Chauvelin and his friends had taken excellent\nprecautions. The prison of the Conciergerie, situated as it was in the\nvery heart of the labyrinthine and complicated structure of the Chatelet\nand the house of Justice, and isolated from every other group of cells\nin the building, was inaccessible save from one narrow doorway which\ngave on the guard-room first, and thence on the inner cell beyond. Just\nas all attempts to rescue the late unfortunate Queen from that prison\nhad failed, so now every attempt to reach the imprisoned Scarlet\nPimpernel was equally doomed to bitter disappointment.\n\nThe guard-room was filled with soldiers day and night; the windows of\nthe inner cell, heavily barred, were too small to admit of the passage\nof a human body, and they were raised twenty feet from the corridor\nbelow. Sir Andrew had stood in the corridor two days ago, he had looked\non the window behind which he knew that his friend must be eating out\nhis noble heart in a longing for liberty, and he had realised then that\nevery effort at help from the outside was foredoomed to failure.\n\n\"Courage, Lady Blakeney,\" he said to Marguerite, when anon they had\ncrossed the Pont au Change, and were wending their way slowly along the\nRue de la Barillerie; \"remember our proud dictum: the Scarlet Pimpernel\nnever fails! and also this, that whatever messages Blakeney gives you\nfor us, whatever he wishes us to do, we are to a man ready to do it, and\nto give our lives for our chief. Courage! Something tells me that a man\nlike Percy is not going to die at the hands of such vermin as Chauvelin\nand his friends.\"\n\nThey had reached the great iron gates of the house of Justice.\nMarguerite, trying to smile, extended her trembling hand to this\nfaithful, loyal comrade.\n\n\"I'll not be far,\" he said. \"When you come out do not look to the right\nor left, but make straight for home; I'll not lose sight of you for a\nmoment, and as soon as possible will overtake you. God bless you both.\"\n\nHe pressed his lips on her cold little hand, and watched her tall,\nelegant figure as she passed through the great gates until the veil\nof falling snow hid her from his gaze. Then with a deep sigh of bitter\nanguish and sorrow he turned away and was soon lost in the gloom.\n\nMarguerite found the gate at the bottom of the monumental stairs open\nwhen she arrived. Chauvelin was standing immediately inside the building\nwaiting for her.\n\n\"We are prepared for your visit, Lady Blakeney,\" he said, \"and the\nprisoner knows that you are coming.\"\n\nHe led the way down one of the numerous and interminable corridors of\nthe building, and she followed briskly, pressing her hand against her\nbosom there where the folds of her kerchief hid the steel files and the\nprecious dagger.\n\nEven in the gloom of these ill-lighted passages she realised that she\nwas surrounded by guards. There were soldiers everywhere; two had stood\nbehind the door when first she entered, and had immediately closed\nit with a loud clang behind her; and all the way down the corridors,\nthrough the half-light engendered by feebly flickering lamps, she caught\nglimpses of the white facings on the uniforms of the town guard, or\noccasionally the glint of steel of a bayonet. Presently Chauvelin paused\nbeside a door, which he had just reached. His hand was on the latch, for\nit did not appear to be locked, and he turned toward Marguerite.\n\n\"I am very sorry, Lady Blakeney,\" he said in simple, deferential tones,\n\"that the prison authorities, who at my request are granting you this\ninterview at such an unusual hour, have made a slight condition to your\nvisit.\"\n\n\"A condition?\" she asked. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"You must forgive me,\" he said, as if purposely evading her question,\n\"for I give you my word that I had nothing to do with a regulation that\nyou might justly feel was derogatory to your dignity. If you will kindly\nstep in here a wardress in charge will explain to you what is required.\"\n\nHe pushed open the door, and stood aside ceremoniously in order to allow\nher to pass in. She looked on him with deep puzzlement and a look of\ndark suspicion in her eyes. But her mind was too much engrossed with\nthe thought of her meeting with Percy to worry over any trifle that\nmight--as her enemy had inferred--offend her womanly dignity.\n\nShe walked into the room, past Chauvelin, who whispered as she went by:\n\n\"I will wait for you here. And, I pray you, if you have aught to\ncomplain of summon me at once.\"\n\nThen he closed the door behind her. The room in which Marguerite now\nfound herself was a small unventilated quadrangle, dimly lighted by a\nhanging lamp. A woman in a soiled cotton gown and lank grey hair brushed\naway from a parchment-like forehead rose from the chair in which she\nhad been sitting when Marguerite entered, and put away some knitting on\nwhich she had apparently been engaged.\n\n\"I was to tell you, citizeness,\" she said the moment the door had been\nclosed and she was alone with Marguerite, \"that the prison authorities\nhave given orders that I should search you before you visit the\nprisoner.\"\n\nShe repeated this phrase mechanically like a child who has been taught\nto say a lesson by heart. She was a stoutish middle-aged woman, with\nthat pasty, flabby skin peculiar to those who live in want of fresh\nair; but her small, dark eyes were not unkindly, although they shifted\nrestlessly from one object to another as if she were trying to avoid\nlooking the other woman straight in the face.\n\n\"That you should search me!\" reiterated Marguerite slowly, trying to\nunderstand.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the woman. \"I was to tell you to take off your clothes,\nso that I might look them through and through. I have often had to do\nthis before when visitors have been allowed inside the prison, so it is\nno use your trying to deceive me in any way. I am very sharp at\nfinding out if any one has papers, or files or ropes concealed in an\nunderpetticoat. Come,\" she added more roughly, seeing that Marguerite\nhad remained motionless in the middle of the room; \"the quicker you are\nabout it the sooner you will be taken to see the prisoner.\"\n\nThese words had their desired effect. The proud Lady Blakeney, inwardly\nrevolting at the outrage, knew that resistance would be worse than\nuseless. Chauvelin was the other side of the door. A call from the woman\nwould bring him to her assistance, and Marguerite was only longing to\nhasten the moment when she could be with her husband.\n\nShe took off her kerchief and her gown and calmly submitted to the\nwoman's rough hands as they wandered with sureness and accuracy to the\nvarious pockets and folds that might conceal prohibited articles. The\nwoman did her work with peculiar stolidity; she did not utter a word\nwhen she found the tiny steel files and placed them on a table beside\nher. In equal silence she laid the little dagger beside them, and the\npurse which contained twenty gold pieces. These she counted in front\nof Marguerite and then replaced them in the purse. Her face expressed\nneither surprise, nor greed nor pity. She was obviously beyond the reach\nof bribery--just a machine paid by the prison authorities to do this\nunpleasant work, and no doubt terrorised into doing it conscientiously.\n\nWhen she had satisfied herself that Marguerite had nothing further\nconcealed about her person, she allowed her to put her dress on once\nmore. She even offered to help her on with it. When Marguerite was\nfully dressed she opened the door for her. Chauvelin was standing in the\npassage waiting patiently. At sight of Marguerite, whose pale, set face\nbetrayed nothing of the indignation which she felt, he turned quick,\ninquiring eyes on the woman.\n\n\"Two files, a dagger and a purse with twenty louis,\" said the latter\ncurtly.\n\nChauvelin made no comment. He received the information quite placidly,\nas if it had no special interest for him. Then he said quietly:\n\n\"This way, citizeness!\"\n\nMarguerite followed him, and two minutes later he stood beside a heavy\nnail-studded door that had a small square grating let into one of the\npanels, and said simply:\n\n\"This is it.\"\n\nTwo soldiers of the National Guard were on sentry at the door, two\nmore were pacing up and down outside it, and had halted when citizen\nChauvelin gave his name and showed his tricolour scarf of office.\nFrom behind the small grating in the door a pair of eyes peered at the\nnewcomers.\n\n\"Qui va la?\" came the quick challenge from the guard-room within.\n\n\"Citizen Chauvelin of the Committee of Public Safety,\" was the prompt\nreply.\n\nThere was the sound of grounding of arms, of the drawing of bolts and\nthe turning of a key in a complicated lock. The prison was kept locked\nfrom within, and very heavy bars had to be moved ere the ponderous door\nslowly swung open on its hinges.\n\nTwo steps led up into the guard-room. Marguerite mounted them with the\nsame feeling of awe and almost of reverence as she would have mounted\nthe steps of a sacrificial altar.\n\nThe guard-room itself was more brilliantly lighted than the corridor\noutside. The sudden glare of two or three lamps placed about the room\ncaused her momentarily to close her eyes that were aching with many shed\nand unshed tears. The air was rank and heavy with the fumes of tobacco,\nof wine and stale food. A large barred window gave on the corridor\nimmediately above the door.\n\nWhen Marguerite felt strong enough to look around her, she saw that\nthe room was filled with soldiers. Some were sitting, others standing,\nothers lay on rugs against the wall, apparently asleep. There was one\nwho appeared to be in command, for with a word he checked the noise that\nwas going on in the room when she entered, and then he said curtly:\n\n\"This way, citizeness!\"\n\nHe turned to an opening in the wall on the left, the stone-lintel of\na door, from which the door itself had been removed; an iron bar\nran across the opening, and this the sergeant now lifted, nodding to\nMarguerite to go within.\n\nInstinctively she looked round for Chauvelin.\n\nBut he was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. THE CAGED LION\n\nWas there some instinct of humanity left in the soldier who allowed\nMarguerite through the barrier into the prisoner's cell? Had the wan\nface of this beautiful woman stirred within his heart the last chord of\ngentleness that was not wholly atrophied by the constant cruelties, the\nexcesses, the mercilessness which his service under this fraternising\nrepublic constantly demanded of him?\n\nPerhaps some recollection of former years, when first he served his King\nand country, recollection of wife or sister or mother pleaded within\nhim in favour of this sorely-stricken woman with the look of unspeakable\nsorrow in her large blue eyes.\n\nCertain it is that as soon as Marguerite passed the barrier he put\nhimself on guard against it with his back to the interior of the cell\nand to her.\n\nMarguerite had paused on the threshold.\n\nAfter the glaring light of the guard-room the cell seemed dark, and at\nfirst she could hardly see. The whole length of the long, narrow cubicle\nlay to her left, with a slight recess at its further end, so that from\nthe threshold of the doorway she could not see into the distant corner.\nSwift as a lightning flash the remembrance came back to her of proud\nMarie Antoinette narrowing her life to that dark corner where the\ninsolent eyes of the rabble soldiery could not spy her every movement.\n\nMarguerite stepped further into the room. Gradually by the dim light of\nan oil lamp placed upon a table in the recess she began to distinguish\nvarious objects: one or two chairs, another table, and a small but very\ncomfortable-looking camp bedstead.\n\nJust for a few seconds she only saw these inanimate things, then she\nbecame conscious of Percy's presence.\n\nHe sat on a chair, with his left arm half-stretched out upon the table,\nhis head hidden in the bend of the elbow.\n\nMarguerite did not utter a cry; she did not even tremble. Just for one\nbrief instant she closed her eyes, so as to gather up all her courage\nbefore she dared to look again. Then with a steady and noiseless step\nshe came quite close to him. She knelt on the flagstones at his feet and\nraised reverently to her lips the hand that hung nerveless and limp by\nhis side.\n\nHe gave a start; a shiver seemed to go right through him; he half raised\nhis head and murmured in a hoarse whisper:\n\n\"I tell you that I do not know, and if I did--\"\n\nShe put her arms round him and pillowed her head upon his breast. He\nturned his head slowly toward her, and now his eyes--hollowed and rimmed\nwith purple--looked straight into hers.\n\n\"My beloved,\" he said, \"I knew that you would come.\" His arms closed\nround her. There was nothing of lifelessness or of weariness in the\npassion of that embrace; and when she looked up again it seemed to her\nas if that first vision which she had had of him with weary head bent,\nand wan, haggard face was not reality, only a dream born of her own\nanxiety for him, for now the hot, ardent blood coursed just as swiftly\nas ever through his veins, as if life--strong, tenacious, pulsating\nlife--throbbed with unabated vigour in those massive limbs, and behind\nthat square, clear brow as though the body, but half subdued, had\ntransferred its vanishing strength to the kind and noble heart that was\nbeating with the fervour of self-sacrifice.\n\n\"Percy,\" she said gently, \"they will only give us a few moments\ntogether. They thought that my tears would break your spirit where their\ndevilry had failed.\"\n\nHe held her glance with his own, with that close, intent look which\nbinds soul to soul, and in his deep blue eyes there danced the restless\nflames of his own undying mirth:\n\n\"La! little woman,\" he said with enforced lightness, even whilst his\nvoice quivered with the intensity of passion engendered by her presence,\nher nearness, the perfume of her hair, \"how little they know you, eh?\nYour brave, beautiful, exquisite soul, shining now through your glorious\neyes, would defy the machinations of Satan himself and his horde. Close\nyour dear eyes, my love. I shall go mad with joy if I drink their beauty\nin any longer.\"\n\nHe held her face between his two hands, and indeed it seemed as if he\ncould not satiate his soul with looking into her eyes. In the midst of\nso much sorrow, such misery and such deadly fear, never had Marguerite\nfelt quite so happy, never had she felt him so completely her own. The\ninevitable bodily weakness, which of necessity had invaded even his\nsplendid physique after a whole week's privations, had made a severe\nbreach in the invincible barrier of self-control with which the soul of\nthe inner man was kept perpetually hidden behind a mask of indifference\nand of irresponsibility.\n\nAnd yet the agony of seeing the lines of sorrow so plainly writ on the\nbeautiful face of the woman he worshipped must have been the keenest\nthat the bold adventurer had ever experienced in the whole course of his\nreckless life. It was he--and he alone--who was making her suffer;\nher for whose sake he would gladly have shed every drop of his blood,\nendured every torment, every misery and every humiliation; her whom he\nworshipped only one degree less than he worshipped his honour and the\ncause which he had made his own.\n\nYet, in spite of that agony, in spite of the heartrending pathos of her\npale wan face, and through the anguish of seeing her tears, the ruling\npassion--strong in death--the spirit of adventure, the mad, wild,\ndevil-may-care irresponsibility was never wholly absent.\n\n\"Dear heart,\" he said with a quaint sigh, whilst he buried his face in\nthe soft masses of her hair, \"until you came I was so d--d fatigued.\"\n\nHe was laughing, and the old look of boyish love of mischief illumined\nhis haggard face.\n\n\"Is it not lucky, dear heart,\" he said a moment or two later, \"that\nthose brutes do not leave me unshaved? I could not have faced you with a\nweek's growth of beard round my chin. By dint of promises and bribery\nI have persuaded one of that rabble to come and shave me every morning.\nThey will not allow me to handle a razor my-self. They are afraid I\nshould cut my throat--or one of theirs. But mostly I am too d--d sleepy\nto think of such a thing.\"\n\n\"Percy!\" she exclaimed with tender and passionate reproach.\n\n\"I know--I know, dear,\" he murmured, \"what a brute I am! Ah, God did\na cruel thing the day that He threw me in your path. To think that\nonce--not so very long ago--we were drifting apart, you and I. You would\nhave suffered less, dear heart, if we had continued to drift.\"\n\nThen as he saw that his bantering tone pained her, he covered her hands\nwith kisses, entreating her forgiveness.\n\n\"Dear heart,\" he said merrily, \"I deserve that you should leave me to\nrot in this abominable cage. They haven't got me yet, little woman, you\nknow; I am not yet dead--only d--d sleepy at times. But I'll cheat them\neven now, never fear.\"\n\n\"How, Percy--how?\" she moaned, for her heart was aching with intolerable\npain; she knew better than he did the precautions which were being taken\nagainst his escape, and she saw more clearly than he realised it himself\nthe terrible barrier set up against that escape by ever encroaching\nphysical weakness.\n\n\"Well, dear,\" he said simply, \"to tell you the truth I have not yet\nthought of that all-important 'how.' I had to wait, you see, until you\ncame. I was so sure that you would come! I have succeeded in putting on\npaper all my instructions for Ffoulkes and the others. I will give them\nto you anon. I knew that you would come, and that I could give them to\nyou; until then I had but to think of one thing, and that was of keeping\nbody and soul together. My chance of seeing you was to let them have\ntheir will with me. Those brutes were sure, sooner or later, to bring\nyou to me, that you might see the caged fox worn down to imbecility,\neh? That you might add your tears to their persuasion, and succeed where\nthey have failed.\"\n\nHe laughed lightly with an unstrained note of gaiety, only Marguerite's\nsensitive ears caught the faint tone of bitterness which rang through\nthe laugh.\n\n\"Once I know that the little King of France is safe,\" he said, \"I can\nthink of how best to rob those d--d murderers of my skin.\"\n\nThen suddenly his manner changed. He still held her with one arm closely\nto, him, but the other now lay across the table, and the slender,\nemaciated hand was tightly clutched. He did not look at her, but\nstraight ahead; the eyes, unnaturally large now, with their deep purple\nrims, looked far ahead beyond the stone walls of this grim, cruel\nprison.\n\nThe passionate lover, hungering for his beloved, had vanished; there\nsat the man with a purpose, the man whose firm hand had snatched men and\nwomen and children from death, the reckless enthusiast who tossed his\nlife against an ideal.\n\nFor a while he sat thus, while in his drawn and haggard face she could\ntrace every line formed by his thoughts--the frown of anxiety, the\nresolute setting of the lips, the obstinate look of will around the firm\njaw. Then he turned again to her.\n\n\"My beautiful one,\" he said softly, \"the moments are very precious. God\nknows I could spend eternity thus with your dear form nestling against\nmy heart. But those d--d murderers will only give us half an hour, and I\nwant your help, my beloved, now that I am a helpless cur caught in their\ntrap. Will you listen attentively, dear heart, to what I am going to\nsay?\n\n\"Yes, Percy, I will listen,\" she replied.\n\n\"And have you the courage to do just what I tell you, dear?\"\n\n\"I would not have courage to do aught else,\" she said simply.\n\n\"It means going from hence to-day, dear heart, and perhaps not meeting\nagain. Hush-sh-sh, my beloved,\" he said, tenderly placing his thin hand\nover her mouth, from which a sharp cry of pain had well-nigh escaped;\n\"your exquisite soul will be with me always. Try--try not to give way to\ndespair. Why! your love alone, which I see shining from your dear eyes,\nis enough to make a man cling to life with all his might. Tell me! will\nyou do as I ask you?\"\n\nAnd she replied firmly and courageously:\n\n\"I will do just what you ask, Percy.\"\n\n\"God bless you for your courage, dear. You will have need of it.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. FOR THE SAKE OF THAT HELPLESS INNOCENT\n\nThe next instant he was kneeling on the floor and his hands were\nwandering over the small, irregular flagstones immediately underneath\nthe table. Marguerite had risen to her feet; she watched her husband\nwith intent and puzzled eyes; she saw him suddenly pass his slender\nfingers along a crevice between two flagstones, then raise one of these\nslightly and from beneath it extract a small bundle of papers, each\ncarefully folded and sealed. Then he replaced the stone and once more\nrose to his knees.\n\nHe gave a quick glance toward the doorway. That corner of his cell, the\nrecess wherein stood the table, was invisible to any one who had not\nactually crossed the threshold. Reassured that his movements could not\nhave been and were not watched, he drew Marguerite closer to him.\n\n\"Dear heart,\" he whispered, \"I want to place these papers in your care.\nLook upon them as my last will and testament. I succeeded in fooling\nthose brutes one day by pretending to be willing to accede to their\nwill. They gave me pen and ink and paper and wax, and I was to write out\nan order to my followers to bring the Dauphin hither. They left me in\npeace for one quarter of an hour, which gave me time to write three\nletters--one for Armand and the other two for Ffoulkes, and to hide them\nunder the flooring of my cell. You see, dear, I knew that you would come\nand that I could give them to you then.\"\n\nHe paused, and that, ghost of a smile once more hovered round his lips.\nHe was thinking of that day when he had fooled Heron and Chauvelin into\nthe belief that their devilry had succeeded, and that they had brought\nthe reckless adventurer to his knees. He smiled at the recollection\nof their wrath when they knew that they had been tricked, and after\na quarter of an hour's anxious waiting found a few sheets of paper\nscribbled over with incoherent words or satirical verse, and the\nprisoner having apparently snatched ten minutes' sleep, which seemingly\nhad restored to him quite a modicum of his strength.\n\nBut of this he told Marguerite nothing, nor of the insults and the\nhumiliation which he had had to bear in consequence of that trick. He\ndid not tell her that directly afterwards the order went forth that\nthe prisoner was to be kept on bread and water in the future, nor that\nChauvelin had stood by laughing and jeering while...\n\nNo! he did not tell her all that; the recollection of it all had still\nthe power to make him laugh; was it not all a part and parcel of that\ngreat gamble for human lives wherein he had held the winning cards\nhimself for so long?\n\n\"It is your turn now,\" he had said even then to his bitter enemy.\n\n\"Yes!\" Chauvelin had replied, \"our turn at last. And you will not bend\nmy fine English gentleman, we'll break you yet, never fear.\"\n\nIt was the thought of it all, of that hand to hand, will to will, spirit\nto spirit struggle that lighted up his haggard face even now, gave him a\nfresh zest for life, a desire to combat and to conquer in spite of all,\nin spite of the odds that had martyred his body but left the mind, the\nwill, the power still unconquered.\n\nHe was pressing one of the papers into her hand, holding her fingers\ntightly in his, and compelling her gaze with the ardent excitement of\nhis own.\n\n\"This first letter is for Ffoulkes,\" he said. \"It relates to the final\nmeasures for the safety of the Dauphin. They are my instructions to\nthose members of the League who are in or near Paris at the present\nmoment. Ffoulkes, I know, must be with you--he was not likely, God bless\nhis loyalty, to let you come to Paris alone. Then give this letter to\nhim, dear heart, at once, to-night, and tell him that it is my express\ncommand that he and the others shall act in minute accordance with my\ninstructions.\"\n\n\"But the Dauphin surely is safe now,\" she urged. \"Ffoulkes and the\nothers are here in order to help you.\"\n\n\"To help me, dear heart?\" he interposed earnestly. \"God alone can do\nthat now, and such of my poor wits as these devils do not succeed in\ncrushing out of me within the next ten days.\"\n\nTen days!\n\n\"I have waited a week, until this hour when I could place this packet in\nyour hands; another ten days should see the Dauphin out of France--after\nthat, we shall see.\"\n\n\"Percy,\" she exclaimed in an agony of horror, \"you cannot endure this\nanother day--and live!\"\n\n\"Nay!\" he said in a tone that was almost insolent in its proud defiance,\n\"there is but little that a man cannot do an he sets his mind to it. For\nthe rest, 'tis in God's hands!\" he added more gently. \"Dear heart! you\nswore that you would be brave. The Dauphin is still in France, and until\nhe is out of it he will not really be safe; his friends wanted to keep\nhim inside the country. God only knows what they still hope; had I been\nfree I should not have allowed him to remain so long; now those good\npeople at Mantes will yield to my letter and to Ffoulkes' earnest\nappeal--they will allow one of our League to convey the child safely out\nof France, and I'll wait here until I know that he is safe. If I tried\nto get away now, and succeeded--why, Heaven help us! the hue and cry\nmight turn against the child, and he might be captured before I could\nget to him. Dear heart! dear, dear heart! try to understand. The safety\nof that child is bound with mine honour, but I swear to you, my sweet\nlove, that the day on which I feel that that safety is assured I will\nsave mine own skin--what there is left of it--if I can!\"\n\n\"Percy!\" she cried with a sudden outburst of passionate revolt, \"you\nspeak as if the safety of that child were of more moment than your own.\nTen days!--but, God in Heaven! have you thought how I shall live these\nten days, whilst slowly, inch by inch, you give your dear, your precious\nlife for a forlorn cause?\n\n\"I am very tough, m'dear,\" he said lightly; \"'tis not a question of\nlife. I shall only be spending a few more very uncomfortable days in\nthis d--d hole; but what of that?\"\n\nHer eyes spoke the reply; her eyes veiled with tears, that wandered\nwith heart-breaking anxiety from the hollow circles round his own to\nthe lines of weariness about the firm lips and jaw. He laughed at her\nsolicitude.\n\n\"I can last out longer than these brutes have any idea of,\" he said\ngaily.\n\n\"You cheat yourself, Percy,\" she rejoined with quiet earnestness. \"Every\nday that you spend immured between these walls, with that ceaseless\nnerve-racking torment of sleeplessness which these devils have devised\nfor the breaking of your will--every day thus spent diminishes\nyour power of ultimately saving yourself. You see, I speak\ncalmly--dispassionately--I do not even urge my claims upon your life.\nBut what you must weigh in the balance is the claim of all those for\nwhom in the past you have already staked your life, whose lives you have\npurchased by risking your own. What, in comparison with your noble life,\nis that of the puny descendant of a line of decadent kings? Why should\nit be sacrificed--ruthlessly, hopelessly sacrificed that a boy might\nlive who is as nothing to the world, to his country--even to his own\npeople?\"\n\nShe had tried to speak calmly, never raising her voice beyond a whisper.\nHer hands still clutched that paper, which seemed to sear her fingers,\nthe paper which she felt held writ upon its smooth surface the\ndeath-sentence of the man she loved.\n\nBut his look did not answer her firm appeal; it was fixed far away\nbeyond the prison walls, on a lonely country road outside Paris, with\nthe rain falling in a thin drizzle, and leaden clouds overhead chasing\none another, driven by the gale.\n\n\"Poor mite,\" he murmured softly; \"he walked so bravely by my side, until\nthe little feet grew weary; then he nestled in my arms and slept until\nwe met Ffoulkes waiting with the cart. He was no King of France just\nthen, only a helpless innocent whom Heaven aided me to save.\"\n\nMarguerite bowed her head in silence. There was nothing more that she\ncould say, no plea that she could urge. Indeed, she had understood, as\nhe had begged her to understand. She understood that long ago he had\nmapped out the course of his life, and now that that course happened to\nlead up a Calvary of humiliation and of suffering he was not likely to\nturn back, even though, on the summit, death already was waiting and\nbeckoning with no uncertain hand; not until he could murmur, in the wake\nof the great and divine sacrifice itself, the sublime words:\n\n\"It is accomplished.\"\n\n\"But the Dauphin is safe enough now,\" was all that she said, after that\none moment's silence when her heart, too, had offered up to God the\nsupreme abnegation of self, and calmly faced a sorrow which threatened\nto break it at last.\n\n\"Yes!\" he rejoined quietly, \"safe enough for the moment. But he would\nbe safer still if he were out of France. I had hoped to take him one day\nwith me to England. But in this plan damnable Fate has interfered.\nHis adherents wanted to get him to Vienna, and their wish had best be\nfulfilled now. In my instructions to Ffoulkes I have mapped out a simple\nway for accomplishing the journey. Tony will be the one best suited to\nlead the expedition, and I want him to make straight for Holland; the\nNorthern frontiers are not so closely watched as are the Austrian ones.\nThere is a faithful adherent of the Bourbon cause who lives at Delft,\nand who will give the shelter of his name and home to the fugitive King\nof France until he can be conveyed to Vienna. He is named Nauudorff.\nOnce I feel that the child is safe in his hands I will look after\nmyself, never fear.\"\n\nHe paused, for his strength, which was only factitious, born of the\nexcitement that Marguerite's presence had called forth, was threatening\nto give way. His voice, though he had spoken in a whisper all along, was\nvery hoarse, and his temples were throbbing with the sustained effort to\nspeak.\n\n\"If those friends had only thought of denying me food instead of sleep,\"\nhe murmured involuntarily, \"I could have held out until--\"\n\nThen with characteristic swiftness his mood changed in a moment. His\narms closed round Marguerite once more with a passion of self-reproach.\n\n\"Heaven forgive me for a selfish brute,\" he said, whilst the ghost of\na smile once more lit up the whole of his face. \"Dear soul, I must\nhave forgotten your sweet presence, thus brooding over my own troubles,\nwhilst your loving heart has a graver burden--God help me!--than it can\npossibly bear. Listen, my beloved, for I don't know how many minutes\nlonger they intend to give us, and I have not yet spoken to you about\nArmand--\"\n\n\"Armand!\" she cried.\n\nA twinge of remorse had gripped her. For fully ten minutes now she had\nrelegated all thoughts of her brother to a distant cell of her memory.\n\n\"We have no news of Armand,\" she said. \"Sir Andrew has searched all the\nprison registers. Oh! were not my heart atrophied by all that it has\nendured this past sennight it would feel a final throb of agonising pain\nat every thought of Armand.\"\n\nA curious look, which even her loving eyes failed to interpret, passed\nlike a shadow over her husband's face. But the shadow lifted in a\nmoment, and it was with a reassuring smile that he said to her:\n\n\"Dear heart! Armand is comparatively safe for the moment. Tell\nFfoulkes not to search the prison registers for him, rather to seek out\nMademoiselle Lange. She will know where to find Armand.\"\n\n\"Jeanne Lange!\" she exclaimed with a world of bitterness in the tone of\nher voice, \"the girl whom Armand loved, it seems, with a passion greater\nthan his loyalty. Oh! Sir Andrew tried to disguise my brother's\nfolly, but I guessed what he did not choose to tell me. It was his\ndisobedience, his want of trust, that brought this unspeakable misery on\nus all.\"\n\n\"Do not blame him overmuch, dear heart. Armand was in love, and love\nexcuses every sin committed in its name. Jeanne Lange was arrested and\nArmand lost his reason temporarily. The very day on which I rescued the\nDauphin from the Temple I had the good fortune to drag the little lady\nout of prison. I had given my promise to Armand that she should be safe,\nand I kept my word. But this Armand did not know--or else--\"\n\nHe checked himself abruptly, and once more that strange, enigmatical\nlook crept into his eyes.\n\n\"I took Jeanne Lange to a place of comparative safety,\" he said after a\nslight pause, \"but since then she has been set entirely free.\"\n\n\"Free?\"\n\n\"Yes. Chauvelin himself brought me the news,\" he replied with a quick,\nmirthless laugh, wholly unlike his usual light-hearted gaiety. \"He had\nto ask me where to find Jeanne, for I alone knew where she was. As for\nArmand, they'll not worry about him whilst I am here. Another reason why\nI must bide a while longer. But in the meanwhile, dear, I pray you find\nMademoiselle Lange; she lives at No. 5 Square du Roule. Through her\nI know that you can get to see Armand. This second letter,\" he added,\npressing a smaller packet into her hand, \"is for him. Give it to him,\ndear heart; it will, I hope, tend to cheer him. I fear me the poor lad\nfrets; yet he only sinned because he loved, and to me he will always be\nyour brother--the man who held your affection for all the years before\nI came into your life. Give him this letter, dear; they are my\ninstructions to him, as the others are for Ffoulkes; but tell him to\nread them when he is all alone. You will do that, dear heart, will you\nnot?\"\n\n\"Yes, Percy,\" she said simply. \"I promise.\"\n\nGreat joy, and the expression of intense relief, lit up his face, whilst\nhis eyes spoke the gratitude which he felt.\n\n\"Then there is one thing more,\" he said. \"There are others in this cruel\ncity, dear heart, who have trusted me, and whom I must not fail--Marie\nde Marmontel and her brother, faithful servants of the late queen; they\nwere on the eve of arrest when I succeeded in getting them to a place\nof comparative safety; and there are others there, too all of these\npoor victims have trusted me implicitly. They are waiting for me there,\ntrusting in my promise to convey them safely to England. Sweetheart, you\nmust redeem my promise to them. You will?--you will? Promise me that you\nwill--\"\n\n\"I promise, Percy,\" she said once more.\n\n\"Then go, dear, to-morrow, in the late afternoon, to No. 98, Rue de\nCharonne. It is a narrow house at the extreme end of that long street\nwhich abuts on the fortifications. The lower part of the house is\noccupied by a dealer in rags and old clothes. He and his wife and\nfamily are wretchedly poor, but they are kind, good souls, and for\na consideration and a minimum of risk to themselves they will always\nrender service to the English milors, whom they believe to be a band of\ninveterate smugglers. Ffoulkes and all the others know these people\nand know the house; Armand by the same token knows it too. Marie de\nMarmontel and her brother are there, and several others; the old\nComte de Lezardiere, the Abbe de Firmont; their names spell suffering,\nloyalty, and hopelessness. I was lucky enough to convey them safely\nto that hidden shelter. They trust me implicitly, dear heart. They are\nwaiting for me there, trusting in my promise to them. Dear heart, you\nwill go, will you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, Percy,\" she replied. \"I will go; I have promised.\"\n\n\"Ffoulkes has some certificates of safety by him, and the old clothes\ndealer will supply the necessary disguises; he has a covered cart which\nhe uses for his business, and which you can borrow from him. Ffoulkes\nwill drive the little party to Achard's farm in St. Germain, where other\nmembers of the League should be in waiting for the final journey to\nEngland. Ffoulkes will know how to arrange for everything; he was always\nmy most able lieutenant. Once everything is organised he can appoint\nHastings to lead the party. But you, dear heart, must do as you wish.\nAchard's farm would be a safe retreat for you and for Ffoulkes: if...\nI know--I know, dear,\" he added with infinite tenderness. \"See I do not\neven suggest that you should leave me. Ffoulkes will be with you, and\nI know that neither he nor you would go even if I commanded. Either\nAchard's farm, or even the house in the Rue de Charonne, would be quite\nsafe for you, dear, under Ffoulkes's protection, until the time when I\nmyself can carry you back--you, my precious burden--to England in mine\nown arms, or until... Hush-sh-sh, dear heart,\" he entreated, smothering\nwith a passionate kiss the low moan of pain which had escaped her lips;\n\"it is all in God's hands now; I am in a tight corner--tighter than ever\nI have been before; but I am not dead yet, and those brutes have not\nyet paid the full price for my life. Tell me, dear heart, that you have\nunderstood--that you will do all that I asked. Tell me again, my dear,\ndear love; it is the very essence of life to hear your sweet lips murmur\nthis promise now.\"\n\nAnd for the third time she reiterated firmly:\n\n\"I have understood every word that you said to me, Percy, and I promise\non your precious life to do what you ask.\"\n\nHe sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction, and even at that moment there\ncame from the guard-room beyond the sound of a harsh voice, saying\nperemptorily:\n\n\"That half-hour is nearly over, sergeant; 'tis time you interfered.\"\n\n\"Three minutes more, citizen,\" was the curt reply.\n\n\"Three minutes, you devils,\" murmured Blakeney between set teeth, whilst\na sudden light which even Marguerite's keen gaze failed to interpret\nleapt into his eyes. Then he pressed the third letter into her hand.\n\nOnce more his close, intent gaze compelled hers; their faces were close\none to the other, so near to him did he draw her, so tightly did he\nhold her to him. The paper was in her hand and his fingers were pressed\nfirmly on hers.\n\n\"Put this in your kerchief, my beloved,\" he whispered. \"Let it rest on\nyour exquisite bosom where I so love to pillow my head. Keep it there\nuntil the last hour when it seems to you that nothing more can come\nbetween me and shame.... Hush-sh-sh, dear,\" he added with passionate\ntenderness, checking the hot protest that at the word \"shame\" had sprung\nto her lips, \"I cannot explain more fully now. I do not know what may\nhappen. I am only a man, and who knows what subtle devilry those brutes\nmight not devise for bringing the untamed adventurer to his knees. For\nthe next ten days the Dauphin will be on the high roads of France, on\nhis way to safety. Every stage of his journey will be known to me. I can\nfrom between these four walls follow him and his escort step by step.\nWell, dear, I am but a man, already brought to shameful weakness by mere\nphysical discomfort--the want of sleep--such a trifle after all; but\nin case my reason tottered--God knows what I might do--then give this\npacket to Ffoulkes--it contains my final instructions--and he will know\nhow to act. Promise me, dear heart, that you will not open the packet\nunless--unless mine own dishonour seems to you imminent--unless I have\nyielded to these brutes in this prison, and sent Ffoulkes or one of the\nothers orders to exchange the Dauphin's life for mine; then, when mine\nown handwriting hath proclaimed me a coward, then and then only, give\nthis packet to Ffoulkes. Promise me that, and also that when you and\nhe have mastered its contents you will act exactly as I have commanded.\nPromise me that, dear, in your own sweet name, which may God bless, and\nin that of Ffoulkes, our loyal friend.\"\n\nThrough the sobs that well-nigh choked her she murmured the promise he\ndesired.\n\nHis voice had grown hoarser and more spent with the inevitable reaction\nafter the long and sustained effort, but the vigour of the spirit was\nuntouched, the fervour, the enthusiasm.\n\n\"Dear heart,\" he murmured, \"do not look on me with those dear, scared\neyes of yours. If there is aught that puzzles you in what I said, try\nand trust me a while longer. Remember, I must save the Dauphin at all\ncosts; mine honour is bound with his safety. What happens to me after\nthat matters but little, yet I wish to live for your dear sake.\"\n\nHe drew a long breath which had naught of weariness in it. The haggard\nlook had completely vanished from his face, the eyes were lighted\nup from within, the very soul of reckless daring and immortal gaiety\nillumined his whole personality.\n\n\"Do not look so sad, little woman,\" he said with a strange and sudden\nrecrudescence of power; \"those d--d murderers have not got me yet--even\nnow.\"\n\nThen he went down like a log.\n\nThe effort had been too prolonged--weakened nature reasserted her rights\nand he lost consciousness. Marguerite, helpless and almost distraught\nwith grief, had yet the strength of mind not to call for assistance.\nShe pillowed the loved one's head upon her breast, she kissed the dear,\ntired eyes, the poor throbbing temples. The unutterable pathos of\nseeing this man, who was always the personification of extreme vitality,\nenergy, and boundless endurance and pluck, lying thus helpless, like a\ntired child, in her arms, was perhaps the saddest moment of this day of\nsorrow. But in her trust she never wavered for one instant. Much that he\nhad said had puzzled her; but the word \"shame\" coming from his own lips\nas a comment on himself never caused her the slightest pang of fear. She\nhad quickly hidden the tiny packet in her kerchief. She would act point\nby point exactly as he had ordered her to do, and she knew that Ffoulkes\nwould never waver either.\n\nHer heart ached well-nigh to breaking point. That which she could not\nunderstand had increased her anguish tenfold. If she could only have\ngiven way to tears she could have borne this final agony more easily.\nBut the solace of tears was not for her; when those loved eyes once more\nopened to consciousness they should see hers glowing with courage and\ndetermination.\n\nThere had been silence for a few minutes in the little cell. The\nsoldiery outside, inured to their hideous duty, thought no doubt that\nthe time had come for them to interfere. The iron bar was raised and\nthrown back with a loud crash, the butt-ends of muskets were grounded\nagainst the floor, and two soldiers made noisy irruption into the cell.\n\n\"Hola, citizen! Wake up,\" shouted one of the men; \"you have not told us\nyet what you have done with Capet!\"\n\nMarguerite uttered a cry of horror. Instinctively her arms were\ninterposed between the unconscious man and these inhuman creatures, with\na beautiful gesture of protecting motherhood.\n\n\"He has fainted,\" she said, her voice quivering with indignation. \"My\nGod! are you devils that you have not one spark of manhood in you?\"\n\nThe men shrugged their shoulders, and both laughed brutally. They had\nseen worse sights than these, since they served a Republic that ruled\nby bloodshed and by terror. They were own brothers in callousness and\ncruelty to those men who on this self-same spot a few months ago had\nwatched the daily agony of a martyred Queen, or to those who had rushed\ninto the Abbaye prison on that awful day in September, and at a word\nfrom their infamous leaders had put eighty defenceless prisoners--men,\nwomen, and children--to the sword.\n\n\"Tell him to say what he has done with Capet,\" said one of the soldiers\nnow, and this rough command was accompanied with a coarse jest that sent\nthe blood flaring up into Marguerite's pale cheeks.\n\nThe brutal laugh, the coarse words which accompanied it, the insult\nflung at Marguerite, had penetrated to Blakeney's slowly returning\nconsciousness. With sudden strength, that appeared almost supernatural,\nhe jumped to his feet, and before any of the others could interfere he\nhad with clenched fist struck the soldier a full blow on the mouth.\n\nThe man staggered back with a curse, the other shouted for help; in a\nmoment the narrow place swarmed with soldiers; Marguerite was roughly\ntorn away from the prisoner's side, and thrust into the far corner of\nthe cell, from where she only saw a confused mass of blue coats and\nwhite belts, and--towering for one brief moment above what seemed to\nher fevered fancy like a veritable sea of heads--the pale face of her\nhusband, with wide dilated eyes searching the gloom for hers.\n\n\"Remember!\" he shouted, and his voice for that brief moment rang out\nclear and sharp above the din.\n\nThen he disappeared behind the wall of glistening bayonets, of blue\ncoats and uplifted arms; mercifully for her she remembered nothing more\nvery clearly. She felt herself being dragged out of the cell, the iron\nbar being thrust down behind her with a loud clang. Then in a vague,\ndreamy state of semi-unconsciousness she saw the heavy bolts being drawn\nback from the outer door, heard the grating of the key in the monumental\nlock, and the next moment a breath of fresh air brought the sensation of\nrenewed life into her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. AFTERWARDS\n\n\"I am sorry, Lady Blakeney,\" said a harsh, dry voice close to her; \"the\nincident at the end of your visit was none of our making, remember.\"\n\nShe turned away, sickened with horror at thought of contact with this\nwretch. She had heard the heavy oaken door swing to behind her on its\nponderous hinges, and the key once again turn in the lock. She felt as\nif she had suddenly been thrust into a coffin, and that clods of earth\nwere being thrown upon her breast, oppressing her heart so that she\ncould not breathe.\n\nHad she looked for the last time on the man whom she loved beyond\neverything else on earth, whom she worshipped more ardently day by day?\nWas she even now carrying within the folds of her kerchief a message\nfrom a dying man to his comrades?\n\nMechanically she followed Chauvelin down the corridor and along the\npassages which she had traversed a brief half-hour ago. From some\ndistant church tower a clock tolled the hour of ten. It had then really\nonly been little more than thirty brief minutes since first she had\nentered this grim building, which seemed less stony than the monsters\nwho held authority within it; to her it seemed that centuries had gone\nover her head during that time. She felt like an old woman, unable to\nstraighten her back or to steady her limbs; she could only dimly see\nsome few paces ahead the trim figure of Chauvelin walking with measured\nsteps, his hands held behind his back, his head thrown up with what\nlooked like triumphant defiance.\n\nAt the door of the cubicle where she had been forced to submit to the\nindignity of being searched by a wardress, the latter was now standing,\nwaiting with characteristic stolidity. In her hand she held the steel\nfiles, the dagger and the purse which, as Marguerite passed, she held\nout to her.\n\n\"Your property, citizeness,\" she said placidly.\n\nShe emptied the purse into her own hand, and solemnly counted out the\ntwenty pieces of gold. She was about to replace them all into the purse,\nwhen Marguerite pressed one of them back into her wrinkled hand.\n\n\"Nineteen will be enough, citizeness,\" she said; \"keep one for yourself,\nnot only for me, but for all the poor women who come here with their\nheart full of hope, and go hence with it full of despair.\"\n\nThe woman turned calm, lack-lustre eyes on her, and silently pocketed\nthe gold piece with a grudgingly muttered word of thanks.\n\nChauvelin during this brief interlude, had walked thoughtlessly on\nahead. Marguerite, peering down the length of the narrow corridor, spied\nhis sable-clad figure some hundred metres further on as it crossed the\ndim circle of light thrown by one of the lamps.\n\nShe was about to follow, when it seemed to her as if some one was moving\nin the darkness close beside her. The wardress was even now in the act\nof closing the door of her cubicle, and there were a couple of soldiers\nwho were disappearing from view round one end of the passage, whilst\nChauvelin's retreating form was lost in the gloom at the other.\n\nThere was no light close to where she herself was standing, and the\nblackness around her was as impenetrable as a veil; the sound of a human\ncreature moving and breathing close to her in this intense darkness\nacted weirdly on her overwrought nerves.\n\n\"Qui va la?\" she called.\n\nThere was a more distinct movement among the shadows this time, as of\na swift tread on the flagstones of the corridor. All else was silent\nround, and now she could plainly hear those footsteps running rapidly\ndown the passage away from her. She strained her eyes to see more\nclearly, and anon in one of the dim circles of light on ahead she spied\na man's figure--slender and darkly clad--walking quickly yet furtively\nlike one pursued. As he crossed the light the man turned to look back.\nIt was her brother Armand.\n\nHer first instinct was to call to him; the second checked that call upon\nher lips.\n\nPercy had said that Armand was in no danger; then why should he be\nsneaking along the dark corridors of this awful house of Justice if he\nwas free and safe?\n\nCertainly, even at a distance, her brother's movements suggested to\nMarguerite that he was in danger of being seen. He cowered in the\ndarkness, tried to avoid the circles of light thrown by the lamps in the\npassage. At all costs Marguerite felt that she must warn him that the\nway he was going now would lead him straight into Chauvelin's arms, and\nshe longed to let him know that she was close by.\n\nFeeling sure that he would recognise her voice, she made pretence to\nturn back to the cubicle through the door of which the wardress had\nalready disappeared, and called out as loudly as she dared:\n\n\"Good-night, citizeness!\"\n\nBut Armand--who surely must have heard--did not pause at the sound.\nRather was he walking on now more rapidly than before. In less than a\nminute he would be reaching the spot where Chauvelin stood waiting for\nMarguerite. That end of the corridor, however, received no light from\nany of the lamps; strive how she might, Marguerite could see nothing now\neither of Chauvelin or of Armand.\n\nBlindly, instinctively, she ran forward, thinking only to reach Armand,\nand to warn him to turn back before it was too late; before he found\nhimself face to face with the most bitter enemy he and his nearest and\ndearest had ever had. But as she at last came to a halt at the end of\nthe corridor, panting with the exertion of running and the fear for\nArmand, she almost fell up against Chauvelin, who was standing there\nalone and imperturbable, seemingly having waited patiently for her. She\ncould only dimly distinguish his face, the sharp features and thin cruel\nmouth, but she felt--more than she actually saw--his cold steely eyes\nfixed with a strange expression of mockery upon her.\n\nBut of Armand there was no sign, and she--poor soul!--had difficulty\nin not betraying the anxiety which she felt for her brother. Had the\nflagstones swallowed him up? A door on the right was the only one that\ngave on the corridor at this point; it led to the concierge's lodge,\nand thence out into the courtyard. Had Chauvelin been dreaming, sleeping\nwith his eyes open, whilst he stood waiting for her, and had Armand\nsucceeded in slipping past him under cover of the darkness and through\nthat door to safety that lay beyond these prison walls?\n\nMarguerite, miserably agitated, not knowing what to think, looked\nsomewhat wild-eyed on Chauvelin; he smiled, that inscrutable, mirthless\nsmile of his, and said blandly:\n\n\"Is there aught else that I can do for you, citizeness? This is your\nnearest way out. No doubt Sir Andrew will be waiting to escort you\nhome.\"\n\nThen as she--not daring either to reply or to question--walked straight\nup to the door, he hurried forward, prepared to open it for her. But\nbefore he did so he turned to her once again:\n\n\"I trust that your visit has pleased you, Lady Blakeney,\" he said\nsuavely. \"At what hour do you desire to repeat it to-morrow?\"\n\n\"To-morrow?\" she reiterated in a vague, absent manner, for she was still\ndazed with the strange incident of Armand's appearance and his flight.\n\n\"Yes. You would like to see Sir Percy again to-morrow, would you not? I\nmyself would gladly pay him a visit from time to time, but he does not\ncare for my company. My colleague, citizen Heron, on the other hand,\ncalls on him four times in every twenty-four hours; he does so a few\nmoments before the changing of the guard, and stays chatting with Sir\nPercy until after the guard is changed, when he inspects the men and\nsatisfies himself that no traitor has crept in among them. All the men\nare personally known to him, you see. These hours are at five in the\nmorning and again at eleven, and then again at five and eleven in the\nevening. My friend Heron, as you see, is zealous and assiduous, and,\nstrangely enough, Sir Percy does not seem to view his visit with any\ndispleasure. Now at any other hour of the day, Lady Blakeney, I pray\nyou command me and I will arrange that citizen Heron grant you a second\ninterview with the prisoner.\"\n\nMarguerite had only listened to Chauvelin's lengthy speech with half an\near; her thoughts still dwelt on the past half-hour with its bitter joy\nand its agonising pain; and fighting through her thoughts of Percy there\nwas the recollection of Armand which so disquieted her. But though she\nhad only vaguely listened to what Chauvelin was saying, she caught the\ndrift of it.\n\nMadly she longed to accept his suggestion. The very thought of seeing\nPercy on the morrow was solace to her aching heart; it could feed on\nhope to-night instead of on its own bitter pain. But even during this\nbrief moment of hesitancy, and while her whole being cried out for this\njoy that her enemy was holding out to her, even then in the gloom ahead\nof her she seemed to see a vision of a pale face raised above a crowd\nof swaying heads, and of the eyes of the dreamer searching for her own,\nwhilst the last sublime cry of perfect self-devotion once more echoed in\nher ear:\n\n\"Remember!\"\n\nThe promise which she had given him, that would she fulfil. The burden\nwhich he had laid on her shoulders she would try to bear as heroically\nas he was bearing his own. Aye, even at the cost of the supreme sorrow\nof never resting again in the haven of his arms.\n\nBut in spite of sorrow, in spite of anguish so terrible that she could\nnot imagine Death itself to have a more cruel sting, she wished above\nall to safeguard that final, attenuated thread of hope which was wound\nround the packet that lay hidden on her breast.\n\nShe wanted, above all, not to arouse Chauvelin's suspicions by markedly\nrefusing to visit the prisoner again--suspicions that might lead to\nher being searched once more and the precious packet filched from her.\nTherefore she said to him earnestly now:\n\n\"I thank you, citizen, for your solicitude on my behalf, but you will\nunderstand, I think, that my visit to the prisoner has been almost more\nthan I could bear. I cannot tell you at this moment whether to-morrow I\nshould be in a fit state to repeat it.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" he replied urbanely. \"But I pray you to remember one\nthing, and that is--\"\n\nHe paused a moment while his restless eyes wandered rapidly over her\nface, trying, as it were, to get at the soul of this woman, at her\ninnermost thoughts, which he felt were hidden from him.\n\n\"Yes, citizen,\" she said quietly; \"what is it that I am to remember?\"\n\n\"That it rests with you, Lady Blakeney, to put an end to the present\nsituation.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Surely you can persuade Sir Percy's friends not to leave their chief\nin durance vile. They themselves could put an end to his troubles\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"By giving up the Dauphin to you, you mean?\" she retorted coldly.\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"And you hoped--you still hope that by placing before me the picture of\nyour own fiendish cruelty against my husband you will induce me to act\nthe part of a traitor towards him and a coward before his followers?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he said deprecatingly, \"the cruelty now is no longer mine.\nSir Percy's release is in your hands, Lady Blakeney--in that of his\nfollowers. I should only be too willing to end the present intolerable\nsituation. You and your friends are applying the last turn of the\nthumbscrew, not I--\"\n\nShe smothered the cry of horror that had risen to her lips. The man's\ncold-blooded sophistry was threatening to make a breach in her armour of\nself-control.\n\nShe would no longer trust herself to speak, but made a quick movement\ntowards the door.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders as if the matter were now entirely out of his\ncontrol. Then he opened the door for her to pass out, and as her skirts\nbrushed against him he bowed with studied deference, murmuring a cordial\n\"Good-night!\"\n\n\"And remember, Lady Blakeney,\" he added politely, \"that should you at\nany time desire to communicate with me at my rooms, 19, Rue Dupuy, I\nhold myself entirely at your service.\"\n\nThen as her tall, graceful figure disappeared in the outside gloom\nhe passed his thin hand over his mouth as if to wipe away the last\nlingering signs of triumphant irony:\n\n\"The second visit will work wonders, I think, my fine lady,\" he murmured\nunder his breath.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. AN INTERLUDE\n\nIt was close on midnight now, and still they sat opposite one another,\nhe the friend and she the wife, talking over that brief half-hour that\nhad meant an eternity to her.\n\nMarguerite had tried to tell Sir Andrew everything; bitter as it was to\nput into actual words the pathos and misery which she had witnessed,\nyet she would hide nothing from the devoted comrade whom she knew Percy\nwould trust absolutely. To him she repeated every word that Percy had\nuttered, described every inflection of his voice, those enigmatical\nphrases which she had not understood, and together they cheated one\nanother into the belief that hope lingered somewhere hidden in those\nwords.\n\n\"I am not going to despair, Lady Blakeney,\" said Sir Andrew firmly;\n\"and, moreover, we are not going to disobey. I would stake my life that\neven now Blakeney has some scheme in his mind which is embodied in the\nvarious letters which he has given you, and which--Heaven help us\nin that case!--we might thwart by disobedience. Tomorrow in the late\nafternoon I will escort you to the Rue de Charonne. It is a house that\nwe all know well, and which Armand, of course, knows too. I had already\ninquired there two days ago to ascertain whether by chance St. Just was\nnot in hiding there, but Lucas, the landlord and old-clothes dealer,\nknew nothing about him.\"\n\nMarguerite told him about her swift vision of Armand in the dark\ncorridor of the house of Justice.\n\n\"Can you understand it, Sir Andrew?\" she asked, fixing her deep,\nluminous eyes inquiringly upon him.\n\n\"No, I cannot,\" he said, after an almost imperceptible moment of\nhesitancy; \"but we shall see him to-morrow. I have no doubt that\nMademoiselle Lange will know where to find him; and now that we know\nwhere she is, all our anxiety about him, at any rate, should soon be at\nan end.\"\n\nHe rose and made some allusion to the lateness of the hour. Somehow it\nseemed to her that her devoted friend was trying to hide his innermost\nthoughts from her. She watched him with an anxious, intent gaze.\n\n\"Can you understand it all, Sir Andrew?\" she reiterated with a pathetic\nnote of appeal.\n\n\"No, no!\" he said firmly. \"On my soul, Lady Blakeney, I know no more of\nArmand than you do yourself. But I am sure that Percy is right. The boy\nfrets because remorse must have assailed him by now. Had he but obeyed\nimplicitly that day, as we all did--\"\n\nBut he could not frame the whole terrible proposition in words. Bitterly\nas he himself felt on the subject of Armand, he would not add yet\nanother burden to this devoted woman's heavy load of misery.\n\n\"It was Fate, Lady Blakeney,\" he said after a while. \"Fate! a damnable\nfate which did it all. Great God! to think of Blakeney in the hands\nof those brutes seems so horrible that at times I feel as if the whole\nthing were a nightmare, and that the next moment we shall both wake\nhearing his merry voice echoing through this room.\"\n\nHe tried to cheer her with words of hope that he knew were but chimeras.\nA heavy weight of despondency lay on his heart. The letter from his\nchief was hidden against his breast; he would study it anon in the\nprivacy of his own apartment so as to commit every word to memory that\nrelated to the measures for the ultimate safety of the child-King. After\nthat it would have to be destroyed, lest it fell into inimical hands.\n\nSoon he bade Marguerite good-night. She was tired out, body and soul,\nand he--her faithful friend--vaguely wondered how long she would be able\nto withstand the strain of so much sorrow, such unspeakable misery.\n\nWhen at last she was alone Marguerite made brave efforts to compose\nher nerves so as to obtain a certain modicum of sleep this night. But,\nstrive how she might, sleep would not come. How could it, when before\nher wearied brain there rose constantly that awful vision of Percy in\nthe long, narrow cell, with weary head bent over his arm, and those\nfriends shouting persistently in his ear:\n\n\"Wake up, citizen! Tell us, where is Capet?\"\n\nThe fear obsessed her that his mind might give way; for the mental agony\nof such intense weariness must be well-nigh impossible to bear. In the\ndark, as she sat hour after hour at the open window, looking out in the\ndirection where through the veil of snow the grey walls of the Chatelet\nprison towered silent and grim, she seemed to see his pale, drawn face\nwith almost appalling reality; she could see every line of it, and could\nstudy it with the intensity born of a terrible fear.\n\nHow long would the ghostly glimmer of merriment still linger in the\neyes? When would the hoarse, mirthless laugh rise to the lips, that\nawful laugh that proclaims madness? Oh! she could have screamed now with\nthe awfulness of this haunting terror. Ghouls seemed to be mocking\nher out of the darkness, every flake of snow that fell silently on the\nwindow-sill became a grinning face that taunted and derided; every cry\nin the silence of the night, every footstep on the quay below turned to\nhideous jeers hurled at her by tormenting fiends.\n\nShe closed the window quickly, for she feared that she would go mad.\nFor an hour after that she walked up and down the room making violent\nefforts to control her nerves, to find a glimmer of that courage which\nshe promised Percy that she would have.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII. SISTERS\n\nThe morning found her fagged out, but more calm. Later on she managed\nto drink some coffee, and having washed and dressed, she prepared to go\nout.\n\nSir Andrew appeared in time to ascertain her wishes.\n\n\"I promised Percy to go to the Rue de Charonne in the late afternoon,\"\nshe said. \"I have some hours to spare, and mean to employ them in trying\nto find speech with Mademoiselle Lange.\"\n\n\"Blakeney has told you where she lives?\"\n\n\"Yes. In the Square du Roule. I know it well. I can be there in half an\nhour.\"\n\nHe, of course, begged to be allowed to accompany her, and anon they were\nwalking together quickly up toward the Faubourg St. Honore. The snow had\nceased falling, but it was still very cold, but neither Marguerite nor\nSir Andrew were conscious of the temperature or of any outward signs\naround them. They walked on silently until they reached the torn-down\ngates of the Square du Roule; there Sir Andrew parted from Marguerite\nafter having appointed to meet her an hour later at a small eating-house\nhe knew of where they could have some food together, before starting on\ntheir long expedition to the Rue de Charonne.\n\nFive minutes later Marguerite Blakeney was shown in by worthy Madame\nBelhomme, into the quaint and pretty drawing-room with its soft-toned\nhangings and old-world air of faded grace. Mademoiselle Lange was\nsitting there, in a capacious armchair, which encircled her delicate\nfigure with its frame-work of dull old gold.\n\nShe was ostensibly reading when Marguerite was announced, for an open\nbook lay on a table beside her; but it seemed to the visitor that mayhap\nthe young girl's thoughts had played truant from her work, for her pose\nwas listless and apathetic, and there was a look of grave trouble upon\nthe childlike face.\n\nShe rose when Marguerite entered, obviously puzzled at the unexpected\nvisit, and somewhat awed at the appearance of this beautiful woman with\nthe sad look in her eyes.\n\n\"I must crave your pardon, mademoiselle,\" said Lady Blakeney as soon as\nthe door had once more closed on Madame Belhomme, and she found herself\nalone with the young girl. \"This visit at such an early hour must seem\nto you an intrusion. But I am Marguerite St. Just, and--\"\n\nHer smile and outstretched hand completed the sentence.\n\n\"St. Just!\" exclaimed Jeanne.\n\n\"Yes. Armand's sister!\"\n\nA swift blush rushed to the girl's pale cheeks; her brown eyes expressed\nunadulterated joy. Marguerite, who was studying her closely, was\nconscious that her poor aching heart went out to this exquisite child,\nthe far-off innocent cause of so much misery.\n\nJeanne, a little shy, a little confused and nervous in her movements,\nwas pulling a chair close to the fire, begging Marguerite to sit. Her\nwords came out all the while in short jerky sentences, and from time to\ntime she stole swift shy glances at Armand's sister.\n\n\"You will forgive me, mademoiselle,\" said Marguerite, whose simple and\ncalm manner quickly tended to soothe Jeanne Lange's confusion; \"but I\nwas so anxious about my brother--I do not know where to find him.\"\n\n\"And so you came to me, madame?\"\n\n\"Was I wrong?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! But what made you think that--that I would know?\"\n\n\"I guessed,\" said Marguerite with a smile. \"You had heard about me\nthen?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\"\n\n\"Through whom? Did Armand tell you about me?\"\n\n\"No, alas! I have not seen him this past fortnight, since you,\nmademoiselle, came into his life; but many of Armand's friends are in\nParis just now; one of them knew, and he told me.\"\n\nThe soft blush had now overspread the whole of the girl's face, even\ndown to her graceful neck. She waited to see Marguerite comfortably\ninstalled in an armchair, then she resumed shyly:\n\n\"And it was Armand who told me all about you. He loves you so dearly.\"\n\n\"Armand and I were very young children when we lost our parents,\" said\nMarguerite softly, \"and we were all in all to each other then. And until\nI married he was the man I loved best in all the world.\"\n\n\"He told me you were married--to an Englishman.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"He loves England too. At first he always talked of my going there with\nhim as his wife, and of the happiness we should find there together.\"\n\n\"Why do you say 'at first'?\"\n\n\"He talks less about England now.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he feels that now you know all about it, and that you\nunderstand each other with regard to the future.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nJeanne sat opposite to Marguerite on a low stool by the fire. Her elbows\nwere resting on her knees, and her face just now was half-hidden by the\nwealth of her brown curls. She looked exquisitely pretty sitting\nlike this, with just the suggestion of sadness in the listless pose.\nMarguerite had come here to-day prepared to hate this young girl, who in\na few brief days had stolen not only Armand's heart, but his allegiance\nto his chief, and his trust in him. Since last night, when she had seen\nher brother sneak silently past her like a thief in the night, she had\nnurtured thoughts of ill-will and anger against Jeanne.\n\nBut hatred and anger had melted at the sight of this child. Marguerite,\nwith the perfect understanding born of love itself, had soon realised\nthe charm which a woman like Mademoiselle Lange must of necessity\nexercise over a chivalrous, enthusiastic nature like Armand's. The\nsense of protection--the strongest perhaps that exists in a good man's\nheart--would draw him irresistibly to this beautiful child, with the\ngreat, appealing eyes, and the look of pathos that pervaded the entire\nface. Marguerite, looking in silence on the--dainty picture before her,\nfound it in her heart to forgive Armand for disobeying his chief when\nthose eyes beckoned to him in a contrary direction.\n\nHow could he, how could any chivalrous man endure the thought of this\ndelicate, fresh flower lying crushed and drooping in the hands of\nmonsters who respected neither courage nor purity? And Armand had been\nmore than human, or mayhap less, if he had indeed consented to leave the\nfate of the girl whom he had sworn to love and protect in other hands\nthan his own.\n\nIt seemed almost as if Jeanne was conscious of the fixity of\nMarguerite's gaze, for though she did not turn to look at her, the flush\ngradually deepened in her cheeks.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Lange,\" said Marguerite gently, \"do you not feel that you\ncan trust me?\"\n\nShe held out her two hands to the girl, and Jeanne slowly turned to her.\nThe next moment she was kneeling at Marguerite's feet, and kissing\nthe beautiful kind hands that had been stretched out to her with such\nsisterly love.\n\n\"Indeed, indeed, I do trust you,\" she said, and looked with tear-dimmed\neyes in the pale face above her. \"I have longed for some one in whom I\ncould confide. I have been so lonely lately, and Armand--\"\n\nWith an impatient little gesture she brushed away the tears which had\ngathered in her eyes.\n\n\"What has Armand been doing?\" asked Marguerite with an encouraging\nsmile.\n\n\"Oh, nothing to grieve me!\" replied the young girl eagerly, \"for he\nis kind and good, and chivalrous and noble. Oh, I love him with all my\nheart! I loved him from the moment that I set eyes on him, and then\nhe came to see me--perhaps you know! And he talked so beautiful about\nEngland, and so nobly about his leader the Scarlet Pimpernel--have you\nheard of him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Marguerite, smiling. \"I have heard of him.\"\n\n\"It was that day that citizen Heron came with his soldiers! Oh! you do\nnot know citizen Heron. He is the most cruel man in France. In Paris\nhe is hated by every one, and no one is safe from his spies. He came to\narrest Armand, but I was able to fool him and to save Armand. And after\nthat,\" she added with charming naivete, \"I felt as if, having saved\nArmand's life, he belonged to me--and his love for me had made me his.\"\n\n\"Then I was arrested,\" she continued after a slight pause, and at the\nrecollection of what she had endured then her fresh voice still trembled\nwith horror.\n\n\"They dragged me to prison, and I spent two days in a dark cell,\nwhere--\"\n\nShe hid her face in her hands, whilst a few sobs shook her whole frame;\nthen she resumed more calmly:\n\n\"I had seen nothing of Armand. I wondered where he was, and I knew\nthat he would be eating out his heart with anxiety for me. But God was\nwatching over me. At first I was transferred to the Temple prison, and\nthere a kind creature--a sort of man-of-all work in the prison took\ncompassion on me. I do not know how he contrived it, but one morning\nvery early he brought me some filthy old rags which he told me to put\non quickly, and when I had done that he bade me follow him. Oh! he was a\nvery dirty, wretched man himself, but he must have had a kind heart. He\ntook me by the hand and made me carry his broom and brushes. Nobody took\nmuch notice of us, the dawn was only just breaking, and the passages\nwere very dark and deserted; only once some soldiers began to chaff him\nabout me: 'C'est ma fille--quoi?' he said roughly. I very nearly laughed\nthen, only I had the good sense to restrain myself, for I knew that my\nfreedom, and perhaps my life, depended on my not betraying myself. My\ngrimy, tattered guide took me with him right through the interminable\ncorridors of that awful building, whilst I prayed fervently to God for\nhim and for myself. We got out by one of the service stairs and exit,\nand then he dragged me through some narrow streets until we came to a\ncorner where a covered cart stood waiting. My kind friend told me to get\ninto the cart, and then he bade the driver on the box take me straight\nto a house in the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois. Oh! I was infinitely\ngrateful to the poor creature who had helped me to get out of that awful\nprison, and I would gladly have given him some money, for I am sure he\nwas very poor; but I had none by me. He told me that I should be quite\nsafe in the house in the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois, and begged me to\nwait there patiently for a few days until I heard from one who had my\nwelfare at heart, and who would further arrange for my safety.\"\n\nMarguerite had listened silently to this narrative so naively told by\nthis child, who obviously had no idea to whom she owed her freedom and\nher life. While the girl talked, her mind could follow with unspeakable\npride and happiness every phase of that scene in the early dawn, when\nthat mysterious, ragged man-of-all-work, unbeknown even to the woman\nwhom he was saving, risked his own noble life for the sake of her whom\nhis friend and comrade loved.\n\n\"And did you never see again the kind man to whom you owe your life?\"\nshe asked.\n\n\"No!\" replied Jeanne. \"I never saw him since; but when I arrived at\nthe Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois I was told by the good people who took\ncharge of me that the ragged man-of-all-work had been none other than\nthe mysterious Englishman whom Armand reveres, he whom they call the\nScarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\n\"But you did not stay very long in the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois, did\nyou?\"\n\n\"No. Only three days. The third day I received a communique from\nthe Committee of General Security, together with an unconditional\ncertificate of safety. It meant that I was free--quite free. Oh! I could\nscarcely believe it. I laughed and I cried until the people in the house\nthought that I had gone mad. The past few days had been such a horrible\nnightmare.\"\n\n\"And then you saw Armand again?\"\n\n\"Yes. They told him that I was free. And he came here to see me. He\noften comes; he will be here anon.\"\n\n\"But are you not afraid on his account and your own? He is--he must be\nstill--'suspect'; a well-known adherent of the Scarlet Pimpernel, he\nwould be safer out of Paris.\"\n\n\"No! oh, no! Armand is in no danger. He, too, has an unconditional\ncertificate of safety.\"\n\n\"An unconditional certificate of safety?\" asked Marguerite, whilst a\ndeep frown of grave puzzlement appeared between her brows. \"What does\nthat mean?\n\n\"It means that he is free to come and go as he likes; that neither he\nnor I have anything to fear from Heron and his awful spies. Oh! but for\nthat sad and careworn look on Armand's face we could be so happy; but\nhe is so unlike himself. He is Armand and yet another; his look at times\nquite frightens me.\"\n\n\"Yet you know why he is so sad,\" said Marguerite in a strange, toneless\nvoice which she seemed quite unable to control, for that tonelessness\ncame from a terrible sense of suffocation, of a feeling as if her\nheart-strings were being gripped by huge, hard hands.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Jeanne half hesitatingly, as if knowing, she was\nstill unconvinced.\n\n\"His chief, his comrade, the friend of whom you speak, the Scarlet\nPimpernel, who risked his life in order to save yours, mademoiselle, is\na prisoner in the hands of those that hate him.\"\n\nMarguerite had spoken with sudden vehemence. There was almost an appeal\nin her voice now, as if she were trying not to convince Jeanne only, but\nalso herself, of something that was quite simple, quite straightforward,\nand yet which appeared to be receding from her, an intangible something,\na spirit that was gradually yielding to a force as yet unborn, to a\nphantom that had not yet emerged from out chaos.\n\nBut Jeanne seemed unconscious of all this. Her mind was absorbed in\nArmand, the man whom she loved in her simple, whole-hearted way, and who\nhad seemed so different of late.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" she said with a deep, sad sigh, whilst the ever-ready tears\nonce more gathered in her eyes, \"Armand is very unhappy because of him.\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel was his friend; Armand loved and revered him.\nDid you know,\" added the girl, turning large, horror-filled eyes on\nMarguerite, \"that they want some information from him about the Dauphin,\nand to force him to give it they--they--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Marguerite.\n\n\"Can you wonder, then, that Armand is unhappy. Oh! last night, after he\nwent from me, I cried for hours, just because he had looked so sad. He\nno longer talks of happy England, of the cottage we were to have, and of\nthe Kentish orchards in May. He has not ceased to love me, for at times\nhis love seems so great that I tremble with a delicious sense of fear.\nBut oh! his love for me no longer makes him happy.\"\n\nHer head had gradually sunk lower and lower on her breast, her voice\ndied down in a murmur broken by heartrending sighs. Every generous\nimpulse in Marguerite's noble nature prompted her to take that sorrowing\nchild in her arms, to comfort her if she could, to reassure her if\nshe had the power. But a strange icy feeling had gradually invaded her\nheart, even whilst she listened to the simple unsophisticated talk of\nJeanne Lange. Her hands felt numb and clammy, and instinctively she\nwithdrew away from the near vicinity of the girl. She felt as if the\nroom, the furniture in it, even the window before her were dancing\na wild and curious dance, and that from everywhere around strange\nwhistling sounds reached her ears, which caused her head to whirl and\nher brain to reel.\n\nJeanne had buried her head in her hands. She was crying--softly, almost\nhumbly at first, as if half ashamed of her grief; then, suddenly it\nseemed, as if she could not contain herself any longer, a heavy sob\nescaped her throat and shook her whole delicate frame with its\nviolence. Sorrow no longer would be gainsaid, it insisted on physical\nexpression--that awful tearing of the heart-strings which leaves the\nbody numb and panting with pain.\n\nIn a moment Marguerite had forgotten; the dark and shapeless phantom\nthat had knocked at the gate of her soul was relegated back into\nchaos. It ceased to be, it was made to shrivel and to burn in the great\nseething cauldron of womanly sympathy. What part this child had played\nin the vast cataclysm of misery which had dragged a noble-hearted\nenthusiast into the dark torture-chamber, whence the only outlet led\nto the guillotine, she--Marguerite Blakeney--did not know; what part\nArmand, her brother, had played in it, that she would not dare to guess;\nall that she knew was that here was a loving heart that was filled with\npain--a young, inexperienced soul that was having its first tussle with\nthe grim realities of life--and every motherly instinct in Marguerite\nwas aroused.\n\nShe rose and gently drew the young girl up from her knees, and then\ncloser to her; she pillowed the grief-stricken head against her\nshoulder, and murmured gentle, comforting words into the tiny ear.\n\n\"I have news for Armand,\" she whispered, \"that will comfort him, a\nmessage--a letter from his friend. You will see, dear, that when Armand\nreads it he will become a changed man; you see, Armand acted a little\nfoolishly a few days ago. His chief had given him orders which he\ndisregarded--he was so anxious about you--he should have obeyed; and\nnow, mayhap, he feels that his disobedience may have been the--the\ninnocent cause of much misery to others; that is, no doubt, the reason\nwhy he is so sad. The letter from his friend will cheer him, you will\nsee.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so, madame?\" murmured Jeanne, in whose tear-stained\neyes the indomitable hopefulness of youth was already striving to shine.\n\n\"I am sure of it,\" assented Marguerite.\n\nAnd for the moment she was absolutely sincere. The phantom had entirely\nvanished. She would even, had he dared to re-appear, have mocked and\nderided him for his futile attempt at turning the sorrow in her heart to\na veritable hell of bitterness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII. LITTLE MOTHER\n\nThe two women, both so young still, but each of them with a mark of\nsorrow already indelibly graven in her heart, were clinging to one\nanother, bound together by the strong bond of sympathy. And but for\nthe sadness of it all it were difficult to conjure up a more beautiful\npicture than that which they presented as they stood side by side;\nMarguerite, tall and stately as an exquisite lily, with the crown of\nher ardent hair and the glory of her deep blue eyes, and Jeanne Lange,\ndainty and delicate, with the brown curls and the child-like droop of\nthe soft, moist lips.\n\nThus Armand saw them when, a moment or two later, entered unannounced.\nHe had pushed open the door and looked on the two women silently for a\nsecond or two; on the girl whom he loved so dearly, for whose sake\nhe had committed the great, the unpardonable sin which would send him\nforever henceforth, Cain-like, a wanderer on the face of the earth;\nand the other, his sister, her whom a Judas act would condemn to lonely\nsorrow and widowhood.\n\nHe could have cried out in an agony of remorse, and it was the groan\nof acute soul anguish which escaped his lips that drew Marguerite's\nattention to his presence.\n\nEven though many things that Jeanne Lange had said had prepared her for\na change in her brother, she was immeasurably shocked by his appearance.\nHe had always been slim and rather below the average in height, but\nnow his usually upright and trim figure seemed to have shrunken within\nitself; his clothes hung baggy on his shoulders, his hands appeared\nwaxen and emaciated, but the greatest change was in his face, in the\nwide circles round the eyes, that spoke of wakeful nights, in the hollow\ncheeks, and the mouth that had wholly forgotten how to smile.\n\nPercy after a week's misery immured in a dark and miserable prison,\ndeprived of food and rest, did not look such a physical wreck as did\nArmand St. Just, who was free.\n\nMarguerite's heart reproached her for what she felt had been neglect,\ncallousness on her part. Mutely, within herself, she craved his\nforgiveness for the appearance of that phantom which should never have\ncome forth from out that chaotic hell which had engendered it.\n\n\"Armand!\" she cried.\n\nAnd the loving arms that had guided his baby footsteps long ago, the\ntender hands that had wiped his boyish tears, were stretched out with\nunalterable love toward him.\n\n\"I have a message for you, dear,\" she said gently--\"a letter from him.\nMademoiselle Jeanne allowed me to wait here for you until you came.\"\n\nSilently, like a little shy mouse, Jeanne had slipped out of the room.\nHer pure love for Armand had ennobled every one of her thoughts, and her\ninnate kindliness and refinement had already suggested that brother\nand sister would wish to be alone. At the door she had turned and met\nArmand's look. That look had satisfied her; she felt that in it she\nhad read the expression of his love, and to it she had responded with a\nglance that spoke of hope for a future meeting.\n\nAs soon as the door had closed on Jeanne Lange, Armand, with an impulse\nthat refused to be checked, threw himself into his sister's arms. The\npresent, with all its sorrows, its remorse and its shame, had sunk away;\nonly the past remained--the unforgettable past, when Marguerite\nwas \"little mother\"--the soother, the comforter, the healer, the\never-willing receptacle wherein he had been wont to pour the burden of\nhis childish griefs, of his boyish escapades.\n\nConscious that she could not know everything--not yet, at any rate--he\ngave himself over to the rapture of this pure embrace, the last\ntime, mayhap, that those fond arms would close round him in unmixed\ntenderness, the last time that those fond lips would murmur words of\naffection and of comfort.\n\nTo-morrow those same lips would, perhaps, curse the traitor, and the\nsmall hand be raised in wrath, pointing an avenging finger on the Judas.\n\n\"Little mother,\" he whispered, babbling like a child, \"it is good to see\nyou again.\"\n\n\"And I have brought you a message from Percy,\" she said, \"a letter which\nhe begged me to give you as soon as may be.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\" he asked.\n\nShe nodded silently, unable to speak. Not now, not when her nerves were\nstrung to breaking pitch, would she trust herself to speak of that awful\nyesterday. She groped in the folds of her gown and took the packet which\nPercy had given her for Armand. It felt quite bulky in her hand.\n\n\"There is quite a good deal there for you to read, dear,\" she said.\n\"Percy begged me to give you this, and then to let you read it when you\nwere alone.\"\n\nShe pressed the packet into his hand. Armand's face was ashen pale. He\nclung to her with strange, nervous tenacity; the paper which he held in\none hand seemed to sear his fingers as with a branding-iron.\n\n\"I will slip away now,\" she said, for strangely enough since Percy's\nmessage had been in Armand's hands she was once again conscious of\nthat awful feeling of iciness round her heart, a sense of numbness that\nparalysed her very thoughts.\n\n\"You will make my excuses to Mademoiselle Lange,\" she said, trying to\nsmile. \"When you have read, you will wish to see her alone.\"\n\nGently she disengaged herself from Armand's grasp and made for the door.\nHe appeared dazed, staring down at that paper which was scorching his\nfingers. Only when her hand was on the latch did he seem to realise that\nshe was going.\n\n\"Little mother,\" came involuntarily to his lips.\n\nShe came straight back to him and took both his wrists in her small\nhands. She was taller than he, and his head was slightly bent forward.\nThus she towered over him, loving but strong, her great, earnest eyes\nsearching his soul.\n\n\"When shall I see you again, little mother?\" he asked.\n\n\"Read your letter, dear,\" she replied, \"and when you have read it, if\nyou care to impart its contents to me, come to-night to my lodgings,\nQuai de la Ferraille, above the saddler's shop. But if there is aught\nin it that you do not wish me to know, then do not come; I shall\nunderstand. Good-bye, dear.\"\n\nShe took his head between her two cold hands, and as it was still bowed\nshe placed a tender kiss, as of a long farewell, upon his hair.\n\nThen she went out of the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV. THE LETTER\n\nArmand sat in the armchair in front of the fire. His head rested against\none hand; in the other he held the letter written by the friend whom he\nhad betrayed.\n\nTwice he had read it now, and already was every word of that minute,\nclear writing graven upon the innermost fibres of his body, upon the\nmost secret cells of his brain.\n\n\n\nArmand, I know. I knew even before Chauvelin came to me, and stood there\nhoping to gloat over the soul-agony a man who finds that he has been\nbetrayed by his dearest friend. But that d--d reprobate did not get\nthat satisfaction, for I was prepared. Not only do I know, Armand, but\nI UNDERSTAND. I, who do not know what love is, have realised how small a\nthing is honour, loyalty, or friendship when weighed in the balance of a\nloved one's need.\n\nTo save Jeanne you sold me to Heron and his crowd. We are men, Armand,\nand the word forgiveness has only been spoken once these past two\nthousand years, and then it was spoken by Divine lips. But Marguerite\nloves you, and mayhap soon you will be all that is left her to love\non this earth. Because of this she must never know.... As for you,\nArmand--well, God help you! But meseems that the hell which you are\nenduring now is ten thousand times worse than mine. I have heard your\nfurtive footsteps in the corridor outside the grated window of this\ncell, and would not then have exchanged my hell for yours. Therefore,\nArmand, and because Marguerite loves you, I would wish to turn to you in\nthe hour that I need help. I am in a tight corner, but the hour may\ncome when a comrade's hand might mean life to me. I have thought of you,\nArmand partly because having taken more than my life, your own belongs\nto me, and partly because the plan which I have in my mind will carry\nwith it grave risks for the man who stands by me.\n\nI swore once that never would I risk a comrade's life to save mine own;\nbut matters are so different now... we are both in hell, Armand, and I\nin striving to get out of mine will be showing you a way out of yours.\n\nWill you retake possession of your lodgings in the Rue de la Croix\nBlanche? I should always know then where to find you in an emergency.\nBut if at any time you receive another letter from me, be its contents\nwhat they may, act in accordance with the letter, and send a copy of\nit at once to Ffoulkes or to Marguerite. Keep in close touch with them\nboth. Tell her I so far forgave your disobedience (there was nothing\nmore) that I may yet trust my life and mine honour in your hands.\n\nI shall have no means of ascertaining definitely whether you will do all\nthat I ask; but somehow, Armand, I know that you will.\n\n\n\nFor the third time Armand read the letter through.\n\n\"But, Armand,\" he repeated, murmuring the words softly under his\nbreath, \"I know that you will.\"\n\nPrompted by some indefinable instinct, moved by a force that compelled,\nhe allowed himself to glide from the chair on to the floor, on to his\nknees.\n\nAll the pent-up bitterness, the humiliation, the shame of the past few\ndays, surged up from his heart to his lips in one great cry of pain.\n\n\"My God!\" he whispered, \"give me the chance of giving my life for him.\"\n\nAlone and unwatched, he gave himself over for a few moments to the\nalmost voluptuous delight of giving free rein to his grief. The hot\nLatin blood in him, tempestuous in all its passions, was firing his\nheart and brain now with the glow of devotion and of self-sacrifice.\n\nThe calm, self-centred Anglo-Saxon temperament--the almost fatalistic\nacceptance of failure without reproach yet without despair, which\nPercy's letter to him had evidenced in so marked a manner--was, mayhap,\nsomewhat beyond the comprehension of this young enthusiast, with pure\nGallic blood in his veins, who was ever wont to allow his most\nelemental passions to sway his actions. But though he did not altogether\nunderstand, Armand St. Just could fully appreciate. All that was noble\nand loyal in him rose triumphant from beneath the devastating ashes of\nhis own shame.\n\nSoon his mood calmed down, his look grew less wan and haggard. Hearing\nJeanne's discreet and mouselike steps in the next room, he rose quickly\nand hid the letter in the pocket of his coat.\n\nShe came in and inquired anxiously about Marguerite; a hurriedly\nexpressed excuse from him, however, satisfied her easily enough. She\nwanted to be alone with Armand, happy to see that he held his head more\nerect to-day, and that the look as of a hunted creature had entirely\ngone from his eyes.\n\nShe ascribed this happy change to Marguerite, finding it in her heart to\nbe grateful to the sister for having accomplished what the fiancee had\nfailed to do.\n\nFor awhile they remained together, sitting side by side, speaking\nat times, but mostly silent, seeming to savour the return of truant\nhappiness. Armand felt like a sick man who has obtained a sudden\nsurcease from pain. He looked round him with a kind of melancholy\ndelight on this room which he had entered for the first time less than a\nfortnight ago, and which already was so full of memories.\n\nThose first hours spent at the feet of Jeanne Lange, how exquisite they\nhad been, how fleeting in the perfection of their happiness! Now they\nseemed to belong to a far distant past, evanescent like the perfume\nof violets, swift in their flight like the winged steps of youth.\nBlakeney's letter had effectually taken the bitter sting from out\nhis remorse, but it had increased his already over-heavy load of\ninconsolable sorrow.\n\nLater in the day he turned his footsteps in the direction of the river,\nto the house in the Quai de la Ferraille above the saddler's shop.\nMarguerite had returned alone from the expedition to the Rue de\nCharonne. Whilst Sir Andrew took charge of the little party of fugitives\nand escorted them out of Paris, she came back to her lodgings in order\nto collect her belongings, preparatory to taking up her quarters in the\nhouse of Lucas, the old-clothes dealer. She returned also because she\nhoped to see Armand.\n\n\"If you care to impart the contents of the letter to me, come to my\nlodgings to-night,\" she had said.\n\nAll day a phantom had haunted her, the phantom of an agonising\nsuspicion.\n\nBut now the phantom had vanished never to return. Armand was sitting\nclose beside her, and he told her that the chief had selected him\namongst all the others to stand by him inside the walls of Paris until\nthe last.\n\n\"I shall mayhap,\" thus closed that precious document, \"have no means\nof ascertaining definitely whether you will act in accordance with this\nletter. But somehow, Armand, I know that you will.\"\n\n\"I know that you will, Armand,\" reiterated Marguerite fervently.\n\nShe had only been too eager to be convinced; the dread and dark\nsuspicion which had been like a hideous poisoned sting had only vaguely\ntouched her soul; it had not gone in very deeply. How could it, when in\nits death-dealing passage it encountered the rampart of tender, almost\nmotherly love?\n\nArmand, trying to read his sister's thoughts in the depths of her blue\neyes, found the look in them limpid and clear. Percy's message to Armand\nhad reassured her just as he had intended that it should do. Fate had\ndealt over harshly with her as it was, and Blakeney's remorse for the\nsorrow which he had already caused her, was scarcely less keen than\nArmand's. He did not wish her to bear the intolerable burden of hatred\nagainst her brother; and by binding St. Just close to him at the\nsupreme hour of danger he hoped to prove to the woman whom he loved so\npassionately that Armand was worthy of trust.\n\n\n\nPART III.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV. THE LAST PHASE\n\n\"Well? How is it now?\"\n\n\"The last phase, I think.\"\n\n\"He will yield?\"\n\n\"He must.\"\n\n\"Bah! you have said it yourself often enough; those English are tough.\"\n\n\"It takes time to hack them to pieces, perhaps. In this case even you,\ncitizen Chauvelin, said that it would take time. Well, it has taken just\nseventeen days, and now the end is in sight.\"\n\nIt was close on midnight in the guard-room which gave on the innermost\ncell of the Conciergerie. Heron had just visited the prisoner as was\nhis wont at this hour of the night. He had watched the changing of the\nguard, inspected the night-watch, questioned the sergeant in charge, and\nfinally he had been on the point of retiring to his own new quarters\nin the house of Justice, in the near vicinity of the Conciergerie, when\ncitizen Chauvelin entered the guard-room unexpectedly and detained his\ncolleague with the peremptory question:\n\n\"How is it now?\"\n\n\"If you are so near the end, citizen Heron,\" he now said, sinking his\nvoice to a whisper, \"why not make a final effort and end it to-night?\"\n\n\"I wish I could; the anxiety is wearing me out more'n him,\" added with a\njerky movement of the head in direction of the inner cell.\n\n\"Shall I try?\" rejoined Chauvelin grimly.\n\n\"Yes, an you wish.\"\n\nCitizen Heron's long limbs were sprawling on a guard-room chair. In this\nlow narrow room he looked like some giant whose body had been carelessly\nand loosely put together by a 'prentice hand in the art of manufacture.\nHis broad shoulders were bent, probably under the weight of anxiety\nto which he had referred, and his head, with the lank, shaggy hair\novershadowing the brow, was sunk deep down on his chest.\n\nChauvelin looked on his friend and associate with no small measure\nof contempt. He would no doubt have preferred to conclude the present\ndifficult transaction entirely in his own way and alone; but equally\nthere was no doubt that the Committee of Public Safety did not trust\nhim quite so fully as it used to do before the fiasco at Calais and the\nblunders of Boulogne. Heron, on the other hand, enjoyed to its outermost\nthe confidence of his colleagues; his ferocious cruelty and his\ncallousness were well known, whilst physically, owing to his great\nheight and bulky if loosely knit frame, he had a decided advantage over\nhis trim and slender friend.\n\nAs far as the bringing of prisoners to trial was concerned, the chief\nagent of the Committee of General Security had been given a perfectly\nfree hand by the decree of the 27th Nivose. At first, therefore, he\nhad experienced no difficulty when he desired to keep the Englishman in\nclose confinement for a time without hurrying on that summary trial and\ncondemnation which the populace had loudly demanded, and to which they\nfelt that they were entitled to as a public holiday. The death of the\nScarlet Pimpernel on the guillotine had been a spectacle promised by\nevery demagogue who desired to purchase a few votes by holding out\nvisions of pleasant doings to come; and during the first few days the\nmob of Paris was content to enjoy the delights of expectation.\n\nBut now seventeen days had gone by and still the Englishman was not\nbeing brought to trial. The pleasure-loving public was waxing impatient,\nand earlier this evening, when citizen Heron had shown himself in the\nstalls of the national theatre, he was greeted by a crowded audience\nwith decided expressions of disapproval and open mutterings of:\n\n\"What of the Scarlet Pimpernel?\"\n\nIt almost looked as if he would have to bring that accursed Englishman\nto the guillotine without having wrested from him the secret which he\nwould have given a fortune to possess. Chauvelin, who had also been\npresent at the theatre, had heard the expressions of discontent; hence\nhis visit to his colleague at this late hour of the night.\n\n\"Shall I try?\" he had queried with some impatience, and a deep sigh of\nsatisfaction escaped his thin lips when the chief agent, wearied and\ndiscouraged, had reluctantly agreed.\n\n\"Let the men make as much noise as they like,\" he added with an\nenigmatical smile. \"The Englishman and I will want an accompaniment to\nour pleasant conversation.\"\n\nHeron growled a surly assent, and without another word Chauvelin turned\ntowards the inner cell. As he stepped in he allowed the iron bar to fall\ninto its socket behind him. Then he went farther into the room until the\ndistant recess was fully revealed to him. His tread had been furtive and\nalmost noiseless. Now he paused, for he had caught sight the prisoner.\nFor a moment he stood quite still, with hands clasped behind his back in\nhis wonted attitude--still save for a strange, involuntary twitching\nof his mouth, and the nervous clasping and interlocking of his fingers\nbehind his back. He was savouring to its utmost fulsomeness the\nsupremest joy which animal man can ever know--the joy of looking on a\nfallen enemy.\n\nBlakeney sat at the table with one arm resting on it, the emaciated\nhand tightly clutched, the body leaning forward, the eyes looking into\nnothingness.\n\nFor the moment he was unconscious of Chauvelin's presence, and the\nlatter could gaze on him to the full content of his heart.\n\nIndeed, to all outward appearances there sat a man whom privations of\nevery sort and kind, the want of fresh air, of proper food, above all,\nof rest, had worn down physically to a shadow. There was not a particle\nof colour in cheeks or lips, the skin was grey in hue, the eyes looked\nlike deep caverns, wherein the glow of fever was all that was left of\nlife.\n\nChauvelin looked on in silence, vaguely stirred by something that\nhe could not define, something that right through his triumphant\nsatisfaction, his hatred and final certainty of revenge, had roused in\nhim a sense almost of admiration.\n\nHe gazed on the noiseless figure of the man who had endured so much for\nan ideal, and as he gazed it seemed to him as if the spirit no longer\ndwelt in the body, but hovered round in the dank, stuffy air of the\nnarrow cell above the head of the lonely prisoner, crowning it with\nglory that was no longer of this earth.\n\nOf this the looker-on was conscious despite himself, of that and of the\nfact that stare as he might, and with perception rendered doubly keen\nby hate, he could not, in spite of all, find the least trace of mental\nweakness in that far-seeing gaze which seemed to pierce the prison\nwalls, nor could he see that bodily weakness had tended to subdue the\nruling passions.\n\nSir Percy Blakeney--a prisoner since seventeen days in close, solitary\nconfinement, half-starved, deprived of rest, and of that mental and\nphysical activity which had been the very essence of life to him\nhitherto--might be outwardly but a shadow of his former brilliant self,\nbut nevertheless he was still that same elegant English gentleman, that\nprince of dandies whom Chauvelin had first met eighteen months ago at\nthe most courtly Court in Europe. His clothes, despite constant wear\nand the want of attention from a scrupulous valet, still betrayed the\nperfection of London tailoring; he had put them on with meticulous care,\nthey were free from the slightest particle of dust, and the filmy folds\nof priceless Mechlin still half-veiled the delicate whiteness of his\nshapely hands.\n\nAnd in the pale, haggard face, in the whole pose of body and of arm,\nthere was still the expression of that indomitable strength of will,\nthat reckless daring, that almost insolent challenge to Fate; it was\nthere untamed, uncrushed. Chauvelin himself could not deny to himself\nits presence or its force. He felt that behind that smooth brow, which\nlooked waxlike now, the mind was still alert, scheming, plotting,\nstriving for freedom, for conquest and for power, and rendered even\ndoubly keen and virile by the ardour of supreme self-sacrifice.\n\nChauvelin now made a slight movement and suddenly Blakeney became\nconscious of his presence, and swift as a flash a smile lit up his wan\nface.\n\n\"Why! if it is not my engaging friend Monsieur Chambertin,\" he said\ngaily.\n\nHe rose and stepped forward in the most approved fashion prescribed by\nthe elaborate etiquette of the time. But Chauvelin smiled grimly and a\nlook of almost animal lust gleamed in his pale eyes, for he had noted\nthat as he rose Sir Percy had to seek the support of the table, even\nwhilst a dull film appeared to gather over his eyes.\n\nThe gesture had been quick and cleverly disguised, but it had been there\nnevertheless--that and the livid hue that overspread the face as if\nconsciousness was threatening to go. All of which was sufficient still\nfurther to assure the looker-on that that mighty physical strength was\ngiving way at last, that strength which he had hated in his enemy almost\nas much as he had hated the thinly veiled insolence of his manner.\n\n\"And what procures me, sir, the honour of your visit?\" continued\nBlakeney, who had--at any rate, outwardly soon recovered himself, and\nwhose voice, though distinctly hoarse and spent, rang quite cheerfully\nacross the dank narrow cell.\n\n\"My desire for your welfare, Sir Percy,\" replied Chauvelin with equal\npleasantry.\n\n\"La, sir; but have you not gratified that desire already, to an extent\nwhich leaves no room for further solicitude? But I pray you, will you\nnot sit down?\" he continued, turning back toward the table. \"I was about\nto partake of the lavish supper which your friends have provided for me.\nWill you not share it, sir? You are most royally welcome, and it will\nmayhap remind you of that supper we shared together in Calais, eh? when\nyou, Monsieur Chambertin, were temporarily in holy orders.\"\n\nHe laughed, offering his enemy a chair, and pointed with inviting\ngesture to the hunk of brown bread and the mug of water which stood on\nthe table.\n\n\"Such as it is, sir,\" he said with a pleasant smile, \"it is yours to\ncommand.\"\n\nChauvelin sat down. He held his lower lip tightly between his teeth, so\ntightly that a few drops of blood appeared upon its narrow surface. He\nwas making vigorous efforts to keep his temper under control, for he\nwould not give his enemy the satisfaction of seeing him resent his\ninsolence. He could afford to keep calm now that victory was at last\nin sight, now that he knew that he had but to raise a finger, and those\nsmiling, impudent lips would be closed forever at last.\n\n\"Sir Percy,\" he resumed quietly, \"no doubt it affords you a certain\namount of pleasure to aim your sarcastic shafts at me. I will not\nbegrudge you that pleasure; in your present position, sir, your shafts\nhave little or no sting.\"\n\n\"And I shall have but few chances left to aim them at your charming\nself,\" interposed Blakeney, who had drawn another chair close to the\ntable and was now sitting opposite his enemy, with the light of the lamp\nfalling full on his own face, as if he wished his enemy to know that he\nhad nothing to hide, no thought, no hope, no fear.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Chauvelin dryly. \"That being the case, Sir Percy, what\nsay you to no longer wasting the few chances which are left to you for\nsafety? The time is getting on. You are not, I imagine, quite as hopeful\nas you were even a week ago,... you have never been over-comfortable in\nthis cell, why not end this unpleasant state of affairs now--once and\nfor all? You'll not have cause to regret it. My word on it.\"\n\nSir Percy leaned back in his chair. He yawned loudly and ostentatiously.\n\n\"I pray you, sir, forgive me,\" he said. \"Never have I been so d--d\nfatigued. I have not slept for more than a fortnight.\"\n\n\"Exactly, Sir Percy. A night's rest would do you a world of good.\"\n\n\"A night, sir?\" exclaimed Blakeney with what seemed like an echo of his\nformer inimitable laugh. \"La! I should want a week.\"\n\n\"I am afraid we could not arrange for that, but one night would greatly\nrefresh you.\"\n\n\"You are right, sir, you are right; but those d--d fellows in the next\nroom make so much noise.\"\n\n\"I would give strict orders that perfect quietude reigned in the\nguard-room this night,\" said Chauvelin, murmuring softly, and there\nwas a gentle purr in his voice, \"and that you were left undisturbed for\nseveral hours. I would give orders that a comforting supper be served to\nyou at once, and that everything be done to minister to your wants.\"\n\n\"That sounds d--d alluring, sir. Why did you not suggest this before?\"\n\n\"You were so--what shall I say--so obstinate, Sir Percy?\"\n\n\"Call it pig-headed, my dear Monsieur Chambertin,\" retorted Blakeney\ngaily, \"truly you would oblige me.\"\n\n\"In any case you, sir, were acting in direct opposition to your own\ninterests.\"\n\n\"Therefore you came,\" concluded Blakeney airily, \"like the good\nSamaritan to take compassion on me and my troubles, and to lead me\nstraight away to comfort, a good supper and a downy bed.\"\n\n\"Admirably put, Sir Percy,\" said Chauvelin blandly; \"that is exactly my\nmission.\"\n\n\"How will you set to work, Monsieur Chambertin?\"\n\n\"Quite easily, if you, Sir Percy, will yield to the persuasion of my\nfriend citizen Heron.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Why, yes! He is anxious to know where little Capet is. A reasonable\nwhim, you will own, considering that the disappearance of the child is\ncausing him grave anxiety.\"\n\n\"And you, Monsieur Chambertin?\" queried Sir Percy with that suspicion of\ninsolence in his manner which had the power to irritate his enemy even\nnow. \"And yourself, sir; what are your wishes in the matter?\"\n\n\"Mine, Sir Percy?\" retorted Chauvelin. \"Mine? Why, to tell you the\ntruth, the fate of little Capet interests me but little. Let him rot in\nAustria or in our prisons, I care not which. He'll never trouble France\novermuch, I imagine. The teachings of old Simon will not tend to make a\nleader or a king out of the puny brat whom you chose to drag out of our\nkeeping. My wishes, sir, are the annihilation of your accursed League,\nand the lasting disgrace, if not the death, of its chief.\"\n\nHe had spoken more hotly than he had intended, but all the pent-up\nrage of the past eighteen months, the recollections of Calais and of\nBoulogne, had all surged up again in his mind, because despite the\ncloseness of these prison walls, despite the grim shadow of starvation\nand of death that beckoned so close at hand, he still encountered a pair\nof mocking eyes, fixed with relentless insolence upon him.\n\nWhilst he spoke Blakeney had once more leaned forward, resting his\nelbows upon the table. Now he drew nearer to him the wooden platter\non which reposed that very uninviting piece of dry bread. With solemn\nintentness he proceeded to break the bread into pieces; then he offered\nthe platter to Chauvelin.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he said pleasantly, \"that I cannot offer you more dainty fare,\nsir, but this is all that your friends have supplied me with to-day.\"\n\nHe crumbled some of the dry bread in his slender fingers, then started\nmunching the crumbs with apparent relish. He poured out some water into\nthe mug and drank it. Then he said with a light laugh:\n\n\"Even the vinegar which that ruffian Brogard served us at Calais was\npreferable to this, do you not imagine so, my good Monsieur Chambertin?\"\n\nChauvelin made no reply. Like a feline creature on the prowl, he was\nwatching the prey that had so nearly succumbed to his talons. Blakeney's\nface now was positively ghastly. The effort to speak, to laugh, to\nappear unconcerned, was apparently beyond his strength. His cheeks and\nlips were livid in hue, the skin clung like a thin layer of wax to the\nbones of cheek and jaw, and the heavy lids that fell over the eyes had\npurple patches on them like lead.\n\nTo a system in such an advanced state of exhaustion the stale water and\ndusty bread must have been terribly nauseating, and Chauvelin himself\ncallous and thirsting for vengeance though he was, could hardly bear to\nlook calmly on the martyrdom of this man whom he and his colleagues were\ntorturing in order to gain their own ends.\n\nAn ashen hue, which seemed like the shadow of the hand of death, passed\nover the prisoner's face. Chauvelin felt compelled to avert his gaze. A\nfeeling that was almost akin to remorse had stirred a hidden chord in his\nheart. The feeling did not last--the heart had been too long atrophied\nby the constantly recurring spectacles of cruelties, massacres, and\nwholesale hecatombs perpetrated in the past eighteen months in the name\nof liberty and fraternity to be capable of a sustained effort in\nthe direction of gentleness or of pity. Any noble instinct in these\nrevolutionaries had long ago been drowned in a whirlpool of exploits\nthat would forever sully the records of humanity; and this keeping of\na fellow-creature on the rack in order to wring from him a Judas-like\nbetrayal was but a complement to a record of infamy that had ceased by\nits very magnitude to weigh upon their souls.\n\nChauvelin was in no way different from his colleagues; the crimes in\nwhich he had had no hand he had condoned by continuing to serve the\nGovernment that had committed them, and his ferocity in the present case\nwas increased a thousandfold by his personal hatred for the man who had\nso often fooled and baffled him.\n\nWhen he looked round a second or two later that ephemeral fit of remorse\ndid its final vanishing; he had once more encountered the pleasant\nsmile, the laughing if ashen-pale face of his unconquered foe.\n\n\"Only a passing giddiness, my dear sir,\" said Sir Percy lightly. \"As you\nwere saying--\"\n\nAt the airily-spoken words, at the smile that accompanied them,\nChauvelin had jumped to his feet. There was something almost\nsupernatural, weird, and impish about the present situation, about this\ndying man who, like an impudent schoolboy, seemed to be mocking Death\nwith his tongue in his cheek, about his laugh that appeared to find its\necho in a widely yawning grave.\n\n\"In the name of God, Sir Percy,\" he said roughly, as he brought\nhis clenched fist crashing down upon the table, \"this situation is\nintolerable. Bring it to an end to-night!\"\n\n\"Why, sir?\" retorted Blakeney, \"methought you and your kind did not\nbelieve in God.\"\n\n\"No. But you English do.\"\n\n\"We do. But we do not care to hear His name on your lips.\"\n\n\"Then in the name of the wife whom you love--\"\n\nBut even before the words had died upon his lips, Sir Percy, too, had\nrisen to his feet.\n\n\"Have done, man--have done,\" he broke in hoarsely, and despite weakness,\ndespite exhaustion and weariness, there was such a dangerous look in\nhis hollow eyes as he leaned across the table that Chauvelin drew back a\nstep or two, and--vaguely fearful--looked furtively towards the opening\ninto the guard-room. \"Have done,\" he reiterated for the third time; \"do\nnot name her, or by the living God whom you dared to invoke I'll find\nstrength yet to smite you in the face.\"\n\nBut Chauvelin, after that first moment of almost superstitious fear, had\nquickly recovered his sang-froid.\n\n\"Little Capet, Sir Percy,\" he said, meeting the other's threatening\nglance with an imperturbable smile, \"tell me where to find him, and\nyou may yet live to savour the caresses of the most beautiful woman in\nEngland.\"\n\nHe had meant it as a taunt, the final turn of the thumb-screw applied to\na dying man, and he had in that watchful, keen mind of his well weighed\nthe full consequences of the taunt.\n\nThe next moment he had paid to the full the anticipated price. Sir Percy\nhad picked up the pewter mug from the table--it was half-filled with\nbrackish water--and with a hand that trembled but slightly he hurled it\nstraight at his opponent's face.\n\nThe heavy mug did not hit citizen Chauvelin; it went crashing against\nthe stone wall opposite. But the water was trickling from the top of his\nhead all down his eyes and cheeks. He shrugged his shoulders with a look\nof benign indulgence directed at his enemy, who had fallen back into his\nchair exhausted with the effort.\n\nThen he took out his handkerchief and calmly wiped the water from his\nface.\n\n\"Not quite so straight a shot as you used to be, Sir Percy,\" he said\nmockingly.\n\n\"No, sir--apparently--not.\"\n\nThe words came out in gasps. He was like a man only partly conscious.\nThe lips were parted, the eyes closed, the head leaning against the high\nback of the chair. For the space of one second Chauvelin feared that his\nzeal had outrun his prudence, that he had dealt a death-blow to a man\nin the last stage of exhaustion, where he had only wished to fan the\nflickering flame of life. Hastily--for the seconds seemed precious--he\nran to the opening that led into the guard-room.\n\n\"Brandy--quick!\" he cried.\n\nHeron looked up, roused from the semi-somnolence in which he had lain\nfor the past half-hour. He disentangled his long limbs from out the\nguard-room chair.\n\n\"Eh?\" he queried. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Brandy,\" reiterated Chauvelin impatiently; \"the prisoner has fainted.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" retorted the other with a callous shrug of the shoulders, \"you\nare not going to revive him with brandy, I imagine.\"\n\n\"No. But you will, citizen Heron,\" rejoined the other dryly, \"for if you\ndo not he'll be dead in an hour!\"\n\n\"Devils in hell!\" exclaimed Heron, \"you have not killed him? You--you\nd--d fool!\"\n\nHe was wide awake enough now; wide awake and shaking with fury. Almost\nfoaming at the mouth and uttering volleys of the choicest oaths, he\nelbowed his way roughly through the groups of soldiers who were crowding\nround the centre table of the guard-room, smoking and throwing dice or\nplaying cards. They made way for him as hurriedly as they could, for it\nwas not safe to thwart the citizen agent when he was in a rage.\n\nHeron walked across to the opening and lifted the iron bar. With scant\nceremony he pushed his colleague aside and strode into the cell, whilst\nChauvelin, seemingly not resenting the other's ruffianly manners and\nviolent language, followed close upon his heel.\n\nIn the centre of the room both men paused, and Heron turned with a surly\ngrowl to his friend.\n\n\"You vowed he would be dead in an hour,\" he said reproachfully.\n\nThe other shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"It does not look like it now certainly,\" he said dryly.\n\nBlakeney was sitting--as was his wont--close to the table, with one arm\nleaning on it, the other, tightly clenched, resting upon his knee. A\nghost of a smile hovered round his lips.\n\n\"Not in an hour, citizen Heron,\" he said, and his voice flow was scarce\nabove a whisper, \"nor yet in two.\"\n\n\"You are a fool, man,\" said Heron roughly. \"You have had seventeen days\nof this. Are you not sick of it?\"\n\n\"Heartily, my dear friend,\" replied Blakeney a little more firmly.\n\n\"Seventeen days,\" reiterated the other, nodding his shaggy head; \"you\ncame here on the 2nd of Pluviose, today is the 19th.\"\n\n\"The 19th Pluviose?\" interposed Sir Percy, and a strange gleam suddenly\nflashed in his eyes. \"Demn it, sir, and in Christian parlance what may\nthat day be?\"\n\n\"The 7th of February at your service, Sir Percy,\" replied Chauvelin\nquietly.\n\n\"I thank you, sir. In this d--d hole I had lost count of time.\"\n\nChauvelin, unlike his rough and blundering colleague, had been watching\nthe prisoner very closely for the last moment or two, conscious of a\nsubtle, undefinable change that had come over the man during those\nfew seconds while he, Chauvelin, had thought him dying. The pose was\ncertainly the old familiar one, the head erect, the hand clenched, the\neyes looking through and beyond the stone walls; but there was an air\nof listlessness in the stoop of the shoulders, and--except for that one\nbrief gleam just now--a look of more complete weariness round the hollow\neyes! To the keen watcher it appeared as if that sense of living power,\nof unconquered will and defiant mind was no longer there, and as if he\nhimself need no longer fear that almost supersensual thrill which had a\nwhile ago kindled in him a vague sense of admiration--almost of remorse.\n\nEven as he gazed, Blakeney slowly turned his eyes full upon him.\nChauvelin's heart gave a triumphant bound.\n\nWith a mocking smile he met the wearied look, the pitiable appeal. His\nturn had come at last--his turn to mock and to exult. He knew that what\nhe was watching now was no longer the last phase of a long and noble\nmartyrdom; it was the end--the inevitable end--that for which he had\nschemed and striven, for which he had schooled his heart to ferocity\nand callousness that were devilish in their intensity. It was the end\nindeed, the slow descent of a soul from the giddy heights of attempted\nself-sacrifice, where it had striven to soar for a time, until the body\nand the will both succumbed together and dragged it down with them into\nthe abyss of submission and of irreparable shame.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI. SUBMISSION\n\nSilence reigned in the narrow cell for a few moments, whilst two human\njackals stood motionless over their captured prey.\n\nA savage triumph gleamed in Chauvelin's eyes, and even Heron, dull and\nbrutal though he was, had become vaguely conscious of the great change\nthat had come over the prisoner.\n\nBlakeney, with a gesture and a sigh of hopeless exhaustion had once\nmore rested both his elbows on the table; his head fell heavy and almost\nlifeless downward in his arms.\n\n\"Curse you, man!\" cried Heron almost involuntarily. \"Why in the name of\nhell did you wait so long?\"\n\nThen, as the prisoner made no reply, but only raised his head slightly,\nand looked on the other two men with dulled, wearied eyes, Chauvelin\ninterposed calmly:\n\n\"More than a fortnight has been wasted in useless obstinacy, Sir Percy.\nFortunately it is not too late.\"\n\n\"Capet?\" said Heron hoarsely, \"tell us, where is Capet?\"\n\nHe leaned across the table, his eyes were bloodshot with the keenness\nof his excitement, his voice shook with the passionate desire for the\ncrowning triumph.\n\n\"If you'll only not worry me,\" murmured the prisoner; and the whisper\ncame so laboriously and so low that both men were forced to bend their\nears close to the scarcely moving lips; \"if you will let me sleep and\nrest, and leave me in peace--\"\n\n\"The peace of the grave, man,\" retorted Chauvelin roughly; \"if you will\nonly speak. Where is Capet?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you; the way is long, the road--intricate.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"I'll lead you to him, if you will give me rest.\"\n\n\"We don't want you to lead us anywhere,\" growled Heron with a smothered\ncurse; \"tell us where Capet is; we'll find him right enough.\"\n\n\"I cannot explain; the way is intricate; the place off the beaten track,\nunknown except to me and my friends.\"\n\nOnce more that shadow, which was so like the passing of the hand of\nDeath, overspread the prisoner's face; his head rolled back against the\nchair.\n\n\"He'll die before he can speak,\" muttered Chauvelin under his breath.\n\"You usually are well provided with brandy, citizen Heron.\"\n\nThe latter no longer demurred. He saw the danger as clearly as did his\ncolleague. It had been hell's own luck if the prisoner were to die now\nwhen he seemed ready to give in. He produced a flask from the pocket of\nhis coat, and this he held to Blakeney's lips.\n\n\"Beastly stuff,\" murmured the latter feebly. \"I think I'd sooner\nfaint--than drink.\"\n\n\"Capet? where is Capet?\" reiterated Heron impatiently.\n\n\"One--two--three hundred leagues from here. I must let one of my friends\nknow; he'll communicate with the others; they must be prepared,\" replied\nthe prisoner slowly.\n\nHeron uttered a blasphemous oath.\n\n\"Where is Capet? Tell us where Capet is, or--\"\n\nHe was like a raging tiger that had thought to hold its prey and\nsuddenly realised that it was being snatched from him. He raised his\nfist, and without doubt the next moment he would have silenced forever\nthe lips that held the precious secret, but Chauvelin fortunately was\nquick enough to seize his wrist.\n\n\"Have a care, citizen,\" he said peremptorily; \"have a care! You called\nme a fool just now when you thought I had killed the prisoner. It is his\nsecret we want first; his death can follow afterwards.\"\n\n\"Yes, but not in this d--d hole,\" murmured Blakeney.\n\n\"On the guillotine if you'll speak,\" cried Heron, whose exasperation was\ngetting the better of his self-interest, \"but if you'll not speak then\nit shall be starvation in this hole--yes, starvation,\" he growled,\nshowing a row of large and uneven teeth like those of some mongrel cur,\n\"for I'll have that door walled in to-night, and not another living soul\nshall cross this threshold again until your flesh has rotted on your\nbones and the rats have had their fill of you.\"\n\nThe prisoner raised his head slowly, a shiver shook him as if caused by\nague, and his eyes, that appeared almost sightless, now looked with a\nstrange glance of horror on his enemy.\n\n\"I'll die in the open,\" he whispered, \"not in this d--d hole.\"\n\n\"Then tell us where Capet is.\"\n\n\"I cannot; I wish to God I could. But I'll take you to him, I swear I\nwill. I'll make my friends give him up to you. Do you think that I would\nnot tell you now, if I could.\"\n\nHeron, whose every instinct of tyranny revolted against this thwarting\nof his will, would have continued to heckle the prisoner even now, had\nnot Chauvelin suddenly interposed with an authoritative gesture.\n\n\"You'll gain nothing this way, citizen,\" he said quietly; \"the man's\nmind is wandering; he is probably quite unable to give you clear\ndirections at this moment.\"\n\n\"What am I to do, then?\" muttered the other roughly.\n\n\"He cannot live another twenty-four hours now, and would only grow more\nand more helpless as time went on.\"\n\n\"Unless you relax your strict regime with him.\"\n\n\"And if I do we'll only prolong this situation indefinitely; and in the\nmeanwhile how do we know that the brat is not being spirited away out of\nthe country?\"\n\nThe prisoner, with his head once more buried in his arms, had fallen\ninto a kind of torpor, the only kind of sleep that the exhausted system\nwould allow. With a brutal gesture Heron shook him by the shoulder.\n\n\"He,\" he shouted, \"none of that, you know. We have not settled the\nmatter of young Capet yet.\"\n\nThen, as the prisoner made no movement, and the chief agent indulged\nin one of his favourite volleys of oaths, Chauvelin placed a peremptory\nhand on his colleague's shoulder.\n\n\"I tell you, citizen, that this is no use,\" he said firmly. \"Unless you\nare prepared to give up all thoughts of finding Capet, you must try and\ncurb your temper, and try diplomacy where force is sure to fail.\"\n\n\"Diplomacy?\" retorted the other with a sneer. \"Bah! it served you well\nat Boulogne last autumn, did it not, citizen Chauvelin?\"\n\n\"It has served me better now,\" rejoined the other imperturbably. \"You\nwill own, citizen, that it is my diplomacy which has placed within your\nreach the ultimate hope of finding Capet.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" muttered the other, \"you advised us to starve the prisoner. Are\nwe any nearer to knowing his secret?\"\n\n\"Yes. By a fortnight of weariness, of exhaustion and of starvation, you\nare nearer to it by the weakness of the man whom in his full strength\nyou could never hope to conquer.\"\n\n\"But if the cursed Englishman won't speak, and in the meanwhile dies on\nmy hands--\"\n\n\"He won't do that if you will accede to his wish. Give him some good\nfood now, and let him sleep till dawn.\"\n\n\"And at dawn he'll defy me again. I believe now that he has some scheme\nin his mind, and means to play us a trick.\"\n\n\"That, I imagine, is more than likely,\" retorted Chauvelin dryly;\n\"though,\" he added with a contemptuous nod of the head directed at the\nhuddled-up figure of his once brilliant enemy, \"neither mind nor body\nseem to me to be in a sufficiently active state just now for hatching\nplot or intrigue; but even if--vaguely floating through his clouded\nmind--there has sprung some little scheme for evasion, I give you my\nword, citizen Heron, that you can thwart him completely, and gain all\nthat you desire, if you will only follow my advice.\"\n\nThere had always been a great amount of persuasive power in citizen\nChauvelin, ex-envoy of the revolutionary Government of France at the\nCourt of St. James, and that same persuasive eloquence did not fail now\nin its effect on the chief agent of the Committee of General Security.\nThe latter was made of coarser stuff than his more brilliant colleague.\nChauvelin was like a wily and sleek panther that is furtive in its\nmovements, that will lure its prey, watch it, follow it with stealthy\nfootsteps, and only pounce on it when it is least wary, whilst Heron was\nmore like a raging bull that tosses its head in a blind, irresponsible\nfashion, rushes at an obstacle without gauging its resisting powers,\nand allows its victim to slip from beneath its weight through the very\nclumsiness and brutality of its assault.\n\nStill Chauvelin had two heavy black marks against him--those of his\nfailures at Calais and Boulogne. Heron, rendered cautious both by the\ndeadly danger in which he stood and the sense of his own incompetence to\ndeal with the present situation, tried to resist the other's authority\nas well as his persuasion.\n\n\"Your advice was not of great use to citizen Collot last autumn at\nBoulogne,\" he said, and spat on the ground by way of expressing both his\nindependence and his contempt.\n\n\"Still, citizen Heron,\" retorted Chauvelin with unruffled patience, \"it\nis the best advice that you are likely to get in the present emergency.\nYou have eyes to see, have you not? Look on your prisoner at this\nmoment. Unless something is done, and at once, too, he will be past\nnegotiating with in the next twenty-four hours; then what will follow?\"\n\nHe put his thin hand once more on his colleague's grubby coat-sleeve,\nhe drew him closer to himself away from the vicinity of that huddled\nfigure, that captive lion, wrapped in a torpid somnolence that looked\nalready so like the last long sleep.\n\n\"What will follow, citizen Heron?\" he reiterated, sinking his voice to\na whisper; \"sooner or later some meddlesome busybody who sits in the\nAssembly of the Convention will get wind that little Capet is no longer\nin the Temple prison, that a pauper child was substituted for him, and\nthat you, citizen Heron, together with the commissaries in charge,\nhave thus been fooling the nation and its representatives for over a\nfortnight. What will follow then, think you?\"\n\nAnd he made an expressive gesture with his outstretched fingers across\nhis throat.\n\nHeron found no other answer but blasphemy.\n\n\"I'll make that cursed Englishman speak yet,\" he said with a fierce\noath.\n\n\"You cannot,\" retorted Chauvelin decisively. \"In his present state he is\nincapable of it, even if he would, which also is doubtful.\"\n\n\"Ah! then you do think that he still means to cheat us?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. But I also know that he is no longer in a physical state\nto do it. No doubt he thinks that he is. A man of that type is sure to\novervalue his own strength; but look at him, citizen Heron. Surely you\nmust see that we have nothing to fear from him now.\"\n\nHeron now was like a voracious creature that has two victims lying ready\nfor his gluttonous jaws. He was loath to let either of them go. He hated\nthe very thought of seeing the Englishman being led out of this narrow\ncell, where he had kept a watchful eye over him night and day for a\nfortnight, satisfied that with every day, every hour, the chances of\nescape became more improbable and more rare; at the same time there was\nthe possibility of the recapture of little Capet, a possibility which\nmade Heron's brain reel with the delightful vista of it, and which might\nnever come about if the prisoner remained silent to the end.\n\n\"I wish I were quite sure,\" he said sullenly, \"that you were body and\nsoul in accord with me.\"\n\n\"I am in accord with you, citizen Heron,\" rejoined the other\nearnestly--\"body and soul in accord with you. Do you not believe that\nI hate this man--aye! hate him with a hatred ten thousand times more\nstrong than yours? I want his death--Heaven or hell alone know how I\nlong for that--but what I long for most is his lasting disgrace. For\nthat I have worked, citizen Heron--for that I advised and helped you.\nWhen first you captured this man you wanted summarily to try him, to\nsend him to the guillotine amidst the joy of the populace of Paris,\nand crowned with a splendid halo of martyrdom. That man, citizen Heron,\nwould have baffled you, mocked you, and fooled you even on the steps of\nthe scaffold. In the zenith of his strength and of insurmountable good\nluck you and all your myrmidons and all the assembled guard of Paris\nwould have had no power over him. The day that you led him out of this\ncell in order to take him to trial or to the guillotine would have been\nthat of your hopeless discomfiture. Having once walked out of this cell\nhale, hearty and alert, be the escort round him ever so strong, he never\nwould have re-entered it again. Of that I am as convinced as that I am\nalive. I know the man; you don't. Mine are not the only fingers through\nwhich he has slipped. Ask citizen Collot d'Herbois, ask Sergeant Bibot\nat the barrier of Menilmontant, ask General Santerre and his guards.\nThey all have a tale to tell. Did I believe in God or the devil, I\nshould also believe that this man has supernatural powers and a host of\ndemons at his beck and call.\"\n\n\"Yet you talk now of letting him walk out of this cell to-morrow?\"\n\n\"He is a different man now, citizen Heron. On my advice you placed\nhim on a regime that has counteracted the supernatural power by simple\nphysical exhaustion, and driven to the four winds the host of demons who\nno doubt fled in the face of starvation.\"\n\n\"If only I thought that the recapture of Capet was as vital to you as it\nis to me,\" said Heron, still unconvinced.\n\n\"The capture of Capet is just as vital to me as it is to you,\" rejoined\nChauvelin earnestly, \"if it is brought about through the instrumentality\nof the Englishman.\"\n\nHe paused, looking intently on his colleague, whose shifty eyes\nencountered his own. Thus eye to eye the two men at last understood one\nanother.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Heron with a snort, \"I think I understand.\"\n\n\"I am sure that you do,\" responded Chauvelin dryly. \"The disgrace of\nthis cursed Scarlet Pimpernel and his League is as vital to me, and\nmore, as the capture of Capet is to you. That is why I showed you the\nway how to bring that meddlesome adventurer to his knees; that is why I\nwill help you now both to find Capet and with his aid and to wreak what\nreprisals you like on him in the end.\"\n\nHeron before he spoke again cast one more look on the prisoner. The\nlatter had not stirred; his face was hidden, but the hands, emaciated,\nnerveless and waxen, like those of the dead, told a more eloquent tale,\nmayhap, then than the eyes could do. The chief agent of the Committee of\nGeneral Security walked deliberately round the table until he stood once\nmore close beside the man from whom he longed with passionate ardour\nto wrest an all-important secret. With brutal, grimy hand he raised the\nhead that lay, sunken and inert, against the table; with callous eyes he\ngazed attentively on the face that was then revealed to him, he looked\non the waxen flesh, the hollow eyes, the bloodless lips; then he\nshrugged his wide shoulders, and with a laugh that surely must have\ncaused joy in hell, he allowed the wearied head to fall back against the\noutstretched arms, and turned once again to his colleague.\n\n\"I think you are right, citizen Chauvelin,\" he said; \"there is not much\nsupernatural power here. Let me hear your advice.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII. CHAUVELIN'S ADVICE\n\nCitizen Chauvelin had drawn his colleague with him to the end of the\ncell that was farthest away from the recess, and the table at which the\nprisoner was sitting.\n\nHere the noise and hubbub that went on constantly in the guard room\nwould effectually drown a whispered conversation. Chauvelin called to\nthe sergeant to hand him a couple of chairs over the barrier. These he\nplaced against the wall opposite the opening, and beckoning Heron to sit\ndown, he did likewise, placing himself close to his colleague.\n\nFrom where the two men now sat they could see both into the guard-room\nopposite them and into the recess at the furthermost end of the cell.\n\n\"First of all,\" began Chauvelin after a while, and sinking his voice to\na whisper, \"let me understand you thoroughly, citizen Heron. Do you want\nthe death of the Englishman, either to-day or to-morrow, either in this\nprison or on the guillotine? For that now is easy of accomplishment; or\ndo you want, above all, to get hold of little Capet?\"\n\n\"It is Capet I want,\" growled Heron savagely under his breath. \"Capet!\nCapet! My own neck is dependent on my finding Capet. Curse you, have I\nnot told you that clearly enough?\"\n\n\"You have told it me very clearly, citizen Heron; but I wished to make\nassurance doubly sure, and also make you understand that I, too, want\nthe Englishman to betray little Capet into your hands. I want that more\neven than I do his death.\"\n\n\"Then in the name of hell, citizen, give me your advice.\"\n\n\"My advice to you, citizen Heron, is this: Give your prisoner now just\na sufficiency of food to revive him--he will have had a few moments'\nsleep--and when he has eaten, and, mayhap, drunk a glass of wine, he\nwill, no doubt, feel a recrudescence of strength, then give him pen and\nink and paper. He must, as he says, write to one of his followers, who,\nin his turn, I suppose, will communicate with the others, bidding them\nto be prepared to deliver up little Capet to us; the letter must make\nit clear to that crowd of English gentlemen that their beloved chief\nis giving up the uncrowned King of France to us in exchange for his own\nsafety. But I think you will agree with me, citizen Heron, that it would\nnot be over-prudent on our part to allow that same gallant crowd to be\nforewarned too soon of the pro-posed doings of their chief. Therefore,\nI think, we'll explain to the prisoner that his follower, whom he will\nfirst apprise of his intentions, shall start with us to-morrow on our\nexpedition, and accompany us until its last stage, when, if it is found\nnecessary, he may be sent on ahead, strongly escorted of course, and\nwith personal messages from the gallant Scarlet Pimpernel to the members\nof his League.\"\n\n\"What will be the good of that?\" broke in Heron viciously. \"Do you want\none of his accursed followers to be ready to give him a helping hand on\nthe way if he tries to slip through our fingers?\n\n\"Patience, patience, my good Heron!\" rejoined Chauvelin with a placid\nsmile. \"Hear me out to the end. Time is precious. You shall offer what\ncriticism you will when I have finished, but not before.\"\n\n\"Go on, then. I listen.\"\n\n\"I am not only proposing that one member of the Scarlet Pimpernel League\nshall accompany us to-morrow,\" continued Chauvelin, \"but I would also\nforce the prisoner's wife--Marguerite Blakeney--to follow in our train.\"\n\n\"A woman? Bah! What for?\"\n\n\"I will tell you the reason of this presently. In her case I should not\nlet the prisoner know beforehand that she too will form a part of our\nexpedition. Let this come as a pleasing surprise for him. She could join\nus on our way out of Paris.\"\n\n\"How will you get hold of her?\"\n\n\"Easily enough. I know where to find her. I traced her myself a few days\nago to a house in the Rue de Charonne, and she is not likely to have\ngone away from Paris while her husband was at the Conciergerie. But this\nis a digression, let me proceed more consecutively. The letter, as\nI have said, being written to-night by the prisoner to one of his\nfollowers, I will myself see that it is delivered into the right hands.\nYou, citizen Heron, will in the meanwhile make all arrangements for\nthe journey. We ought to start at dawn, and we ought to be prepared,\nespecially during the first fifty leagues of the way, against organised\nattack in case the Englishman leads us into an ambush.\"\n\n\"Yes. He might even do that, curse him!\" muttered Heron.\n\n\"He might, but it is unlikely. Still it is best to be prepared. Take\na strong escort, citizen, say twenty or thirty men, picked and trained\nsoldiers who would make short work of civilians, however well-armed they\nmight be. There are twenty members--including the chief--in that Scarlet\nPimpernel League, and I do not quite see how from this cell the prisoner\ncould organise an ambuscade against us at a given time. Anyhow, that is\na matter for you to decide. I have still to place before you a scheme\nwhich is a measure of safety for ourselves and our men against ambush as\nwell as against trickery, and which I feel sure you will pronounce quite\nadequate.\"\n\n\"Let me hear it, then!\"\n\n\"The prisoner will have to travel by coach, of course. You can travel\nwith him, if you like, and put him in irons, and thus avert all chances\nof his escaping on the road. But\"--and here Chauvelin made a long pause,\nwhich had the effect of holding his colleague's attention still more\nclosely--\"remember that we shall have his wife and one of his friends\nwith us. Before we finally leave Paris tomorrow we will explain to\nthe prisoner that at the first attempt to escape on his part, at the\nslightest suspicion that he has tricked us for his own ends or is\nleading us into an ambush--at the slightest suspicion, I say--you,\ncitizen Heron, will order his friend first, and then Marguerite Blakeney\nherself, to be summarily shot before his eyes.\"\n\nHeron gave a long, low whistle. Instinctively he threw a furtive,\nbackward glance at the prisoner, then he raised his shifty eyes to his\ncolleague.\n\nThere was unbounded admiration expressed in them. One blackguard had met\nanother--a greater one than himself--and was proud to acknowledge him as\nhis master.\n\n\"By Lucifer, citizen Chauvelin,\" he said at last, \"I should never have\nthought of such a thing myself.\"\n\nChauvelin put up his hand with a gesture of self-deprecation.\n\n\"I certainly think that measure ought to be adequate,\" he said with a\ngentle air of assumed modesty, \"unless you would prefer to arrest the\nwoman and lodge her here, keeping her here as an hostage.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said Heron with a gruff laugh; \"that idea does not appeal\nto me nearly so much as the other. I should not feel so secure on the\nway.... I should always be thinking that that cursed woman had been\nallowed to escape.... No! no! I would rather keep her under my own\neye--just as you suggest, citizen Chauvelin... and under the prisoner's,\ntoo,\" he added with a coarse jest. \"If he did not actually see her,\nhe might be more ready to try and save himself at her expense. But, of\ncourse, he could not see her shot before his eyes. It is a perfect plan,\ncitizen, and does you infinite credit; and if the Englishman tricked\nus,\" he concluded with a fierce and savage oath, \"and we did not find\nCapet at the end of the journey, I would gladly strangle his wife and\nhis friend with my own hands.\"\n\n\"A satisfaction which I would not begrudge you, citizen,\" said Chauvelin\ndryly. \"Perhaps you are right... the woman had best be kept under your\nown eye... the prisoner will never risk her safety on that, I would\nstake my life. We'll deliver our final 'either--or' the moment that\nshe has joined our party, and before we start further on our way. Now,\ncitizen Heron, you have heard my advice; are you prepared to follow it?\"\n\n\"To the last letter,\" replied the other.\n\nAnd their two hands met in a grasp of mutual understanding--two hands\nalready indelibly stained with much innocent blood, more deeply stained\nnow with seventeen past days of inhumanity and miserable treachery to\ncome.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. CAPITULATION\n\nWhat occurred within the inner cell of the Conciergerie prison within\nthe next half-hour of that 16th day of Pluviose in the year II of the\nRepublic is, perhaps, too well known to history to need or bear overfull\nrepetition.\n\nChroniclers intimate with the inner history of those infamous days have\ntold us how the chief agent of the Committee of General Security gave\norders one hour after midnight that hot soup, white bread and wine be\nserved to the prisoner, who for close on fourteen days previously had\nbeen kept on short rations of black bread and water; the sergeant in\ncharge of the guard-room watch for the night also received strict orders\nthat that same prisoner was on no account to be disturbed until the hour\nof six in the morning, when he was to be served with anything in the way\nof breakfast that he might fancy.\n\nAll this we know, and also that citizen Heron, having given all\nnecessary orders for the morning's expedition, returned to the\nConciergerie, and found his colleague Chauvelin waiting for him in the\nguard-room.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked with febrile impatience--\"the prisoner?\"\n\n\"He seems better and stronger,\" replied Chauvelin.\n\n\"Not too well, I hope?\"\n\n\"No, no, only just well enough.\"\n\n\"You have seen him--since his supper?\"\n\n\"Only from the doorway. It seems he ate and drank hardly at all, and the\nsergeant had some difficulty in keeping him awake until you came.\"\n\n\"Well, now for the letter,\" concluded Heron with the same marked\nfeverishness of manner which sat so curiously on his uncouth\npersonality. \"Pen, ink and paper, sergeant!\" he commanded.\n\n\"On the table, in the prisoner's cell, citizen,\" replied the sergeant.\n\nHe preceded the two citizens across the guard-room to the doorway, and\nraised for them the iron bar, lowering it back after them.\n\nThe next moment Heron and Chauvelin were once more face to face with\ntheir prisoner.\n\nWhether by accident or design the lamp had been so placed that as the\ntwo men approached its light fell full upon their faces, while that of\nthe prisoner remained in shadow. He was leaning forward with both\nelbows on the table, his thin, tapering fingers toying with the pen and\nink-horn which had been placed close to his hand.\n\n\"I trust that everything has been arranged for your comfort, Sir Percy?\"\nChauvelin asked with a sarcastic little smile.\n\n\"I thank you, sir,\" replied Blakeney politely.\n\n\"You feel refreshed, I hope?\"\n\n\"Greatly so, I assure you. But I am still demmed sleepy; and if you\nwould kindly be brief--\"\n\n\"You have not changed your mind, sir?\" queried Chauvelin, and a note of\nanxiety, which he vainly tried to conceal, quivered in his voice.\n\n\"No, my good M. Chambertin,\" replied Blakeney with the same urbane\ncourtesy, \"I have not changed my mind.\"\n\nA sigh of relief escaped the lips of both the men. The prisoner\ncertainly had spoken in a clearer and firmer voice; but whatever renewed\nstrength wine and food had imparted to him he apparently did not mean to\nemploy in renewed obstinacy. Chauvelin, after a moment's pause, resumed\nmore calmly:\n\n\"You are prepared to direct us to the place where little Capet lies\nhidden?\"\n\n\"I am prepared to do anything, sir, to get out of this d--d hole.\"\n\n\"Very well. My colleague, citizen Heron, has arranged for an escort\nof twenty men picked from the best regiment of the Garde de Paris to\naccompany us--yourself, him and me--to wherever you will direct us. Is\nthat clear?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, sir.\"\n\n\"You must not imagine for a moment that we, on the other hand, guarantee\nto give you your life and freedom even if this expedition prove\nunsuccessful.\"\n\n\"I would not venture on suggesting such a wild proposition, sir,\" said\nBlakeney placidly.\n\nChauvelin looked keenly on him. There was something in the tone of that\nvoice that he did not altogether like--something that reminded him of an\nevening at Calais, and yet again of a day at Boulogne. He could not read\nthe expression in the eyes, so with a quick gesture he pulled the lamp\nforward so that its light now fell full on the face of the prisoner.\n\n\"Ah! that is certainly better, is it not, my dear M. Chambertin?\" said\nSir Percy, beaming on his adversary with a pleasant smile.\n\nHis face, though still of the same ashen hue, looked serene if\nhopelessly wearied; the eyes seemed to mock. But this Chauvelin decided\nin himself must have been a trick of his own overwrought fancy. After a\nbrief moment's pause he resumed dryly:\n\n\"If, however, the expedition turns out successful in every way--if\nlittle Capet, without much trouble to our escort, falls safe and sound\ninto our hands--if certain contingencies which I am about to tell\nyou all fall out as we wish--then, Sir Percy, I see no reason why the\nGovernment of this country should not exercise its prerogative of mercy\ntowards you after all.\"\n\n\"An exercise, my dear M. Chambertin, which must have wearied through\nfrequent repetition,\" retorted Blakeney with the same imperturbable\nsmile.\n\n\"The contingency at present is somewhat remote; when the time comes\nwe'll talk this matter over.... I will make no promise... and, anyhow,\nwe can discuss it later.\"\n\n\"At present we are but wasting our valuable time over so trifling a\nmatter.... If you'll excuse me, sir... I am so demmed fatigued--\"\n\n\"Then you will be glad to have everything settled quickly, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir.\"\n\nHeron was taking no part in the present conversation. He knew that his\ntemper was not likely to remain within bounds, and though he had nothing\nbut contempt for his colleague's courtly manners, yet vaguely in his\nstupid, blundering way he grudgingly admitted that mayhap it was better\nto allow citizen Chauvelin to deal with the Englishman. There was always\nthe danger that if his own violent temper got the better of him, he\nmight even at this eleventh hour order this insolent prisoner to summary\ntrial and the guillotine, and thus lose the final chance of the more\nimportant capture.\n\nHe was sprawling on a chair in his usual slouching manner with his\nbig head sunk between his broad shoulders, his shifty, prominent eyes\nwandering restlessly from the face of his colleague to that of the other\nman.\n\nBut now he gave a grunt of impatience.\n\n\"We are wasting time, citizen Chauvelin,\" he muttered. \"I have still\na great deal to see to if we are to start at dawn. Get the d--d letter\nwritten, and--\"\n\nThe rest of the phrase was lost in an indistinct and surly murmur.\nChauvelin, after a shrug of the shoulders, paid no further heed to him;\nhe turned, bland and urbane, once more to the prisoner.\n\n\"I see with pleasure, Sir Percy,\" he said, \"that we thoroughly\nunderstand one another. Having had a few hours' rest you will, I know,\nfeel quite ready for the expedition. Will you kindly indicate to me the\ndirection in which we will have to travel?\"\n\n\"Northwards all the way.\"\n\n\"Towards the coast?\"\n\n\"The place to which we must go is about seven leagues from the sea.\"\n\n\"Our first objective then will be Beauvais, Amiens, Abbeville, Crecy,\nand so on?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"As far as the forest of Boulogne, shall we say?\"\n\n\"Where we shall come off the beaten track, and you will have to trust to\nmy guidance.\"\n\n\"We might go there now, Sir Percy, and leave you here.\"\n\n\"You might. But you would not then find the child. Seven leagues is not\nfar from the coast. He might slip through your fingers.\"\n\n\"And my colleague Heron, being disappointed, would inevitably send you\nto the guillotine.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" rejoined the prisoner placidly. \"Methought, sir, that we\nhad decided that I should lead this little expedition? Surely,\" he\nadded, \"it is not so much the Dauphin whom you want as my share in this\nbetrayal.\"\n\n\"You are right as usual, Sir Percy. Therefore let us take that as\nsettled. We go as far as Crecy, and thence place ourselves entirely in\nyour hands.\"\n\n\"The journey should not take more than three days, sir.\"\n\n\"During which you will travel in a coach in the company of my friend\nHeron.\"\n\n\"I could have chosen pleasanter company, sir; still, it will serve.\"\n\n\"This being settled, Sir Percy. I understand that you desire to\ncommunicate with one of your followers.\"\n\n\"Some one must let the others know... those who have the Dauphin in\ntheir charge.\"\n\n\"Quite so. Therefore I pray you write to one of your friends that you\nhave decided to deliver the Dauphin into our hands in exchange for your\nown safety.\"\n\n\"You said just now that this you would not guarantee,\" interposed\nBlakeney quietly.\n\n\"If all turns out well,\" retorted Chauvelin with a show of contempt,\n\"and if you will write the exact letter which I shall dictate, we might\neven give you that guarantee.\"\n\n\"The quality of your mercy, sir, passes belief.\"\n\n\"Then I pray you write. Which of your followers will have the honour of\nthe communication?\"\n\n\"My brother-in-law, Armand St. Just; he is still in Paris, I believe. He\ncan let the others know.\"\n\nChauvelin made no immediate reply. He paused awhile, hesitating. Would\nSir Percy Blakeney be ready--if his own safety demanded it--to sacrifice\nthe man who had betrayed him? In the momentous \"either--or\" that was to\nbe put to him, by-and-by, would he choose his own life and leave\nArmand St. Just to perish? It was not for Chauvelin--or any man of his\nstamp--to judge of what Blakeney would do under such circumstances, and\nhad it been a question of St. Just alone, mayhap Chauvelin would have\nhesitated still more at the present juncture.\n\nBut the friend as hostage was only destined to be a minor leverage for\nthe final breaking-up of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel through the\ndisgrace of its chief. There was the wife--Marguerite Blakeney--sister\nof St. Just, joint and far more important hostage, whose very close\naffection for her brother might prove an additional trump card in that\nhandful which Chauvelin already held.\n\nBlakeney paid no heed seemingly to the other's hesitation. He did not\neven look up at him, but quietly drew pen and paper towards him, and\nmade ready to write.\n\n\"What do you wish me to say?\" he asked simply.\n\n\"Will that young blackguard answer your purpose, citizen Chauvelin?\"\nqueried Heron roughly.\n\nObviously the same doubt had crossed his mind. Chauvelin quickly\nre-assured him.\n\n\"Better than any one else,\" he said firmly. \"Will you write at my\ndictation, Sir Percy?\n\n\"I am waiting to do so, my dear sir.\"\n\n\"Begin your letter as you wish, then; now continue.\"\n\nAnd he began to dictate slowly, watching every word as it left\nBlakeney's pen.\n\n\"'I cannot stand my present position any longer. Citizen Heron, and also\nM. Chauvelin--' Yes, Sir Percy, Chauvelin, not Chambertin ... C, H,\nA, U, V, E, L, I, N.... That is quite right-- 'have made this prison a\nperfect hell for me.'\"\n\nSir Percy looked up from his writing, smiling.\n\n\"You wrong yourself, my dear M. Chambertin!\" he said; \"I have really\nbeen most comfortable.\"\n\n\"I wish to place the matter before your friends in as indulgent a manner\nas I can,\" retorted Chauvelin dryly.\n\n\"I thank you, sir. Pray proceed.\"\n\n\"... a perfect hell for me,'\" resumed the other. \"Have you that? ...\n'and I have been forced to give way. To-morrow we start from here at\ndawn; and I will guide citizen Heron to the place where he can find the\nDauphin. But the authorities demand that one of my followers, one who\nhas once been a member of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, shall\naccompany me on this expedition. I therefore ask you'--or 'desire you'\nor 'beg you'--whichever you prefer, Sir Percy...\"\n\n\"'Ask you' will do quite nicely. This is really very interesting, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"... 'to be prepared to join the expedition. We start at dawn, and you\nwould be required to be at the main gate of the house of Justice at six\no'clock precisely. I have an assurance from the authorities that your\nlife should be in-violate, but if you refuse to accompany me, the\nguillotine will await me on the morrow.'\"\n\n\"'The guillotine will await me on the morrow.' That sounds quite\ncheerful, does it not, M. Chambertin?\" said the prisoner, who had not\nevinced the slightest surprise at the wording of the letter whilst he\nwrote at the other's dictation. \"Do you know, I quite enjoyed writing\nthis letter; it so reminded me of happy days in Boulogne.\"\n\nChauvelin pressed his lips together. Truly now he felt that a retort\nfrom him would have been undignified, more especially as just at this\nmoment there came from the guard room the sound of men's voices talking\nand laughing, the occasional clang of steel, or of a heavy boot\nagainst the tiled floor, the rattling of dice, or a sudden burst of\nlaughter--sounds, in fact, that betokened the presence of a number of\nsoldiers close by.\n\nChauvelin contented himself with a nod in the direction of the\nguard-room.\n\n\"The conditions are somewhat different now,\" he said placidly, \"from\nthose that reigned in Boulogne. But will you not sign your letter, Sir\nPercy?\"\n\n\"With pleasure, sir,\" responded Blakeney, as with an elaborate flourish\nof the pen he appended his name to the missive.\n\nChauvelin was watching him with eyes that would have shamed a lynx by\ntheir keenness. He took up the completed letter, read it through very\ncarefully, as if to find some hidden meaning behind the very words which\nhe himself had dictated; he studied the signature, and looked vainly for\na mark or a sign that might convey a different sense to that which he\nhad intended. Finally, finding none, he folded the letter up with his\nown hand, and at once slipped it in the pocket of his coat.\n\n\"Take care, M. Chambertin,\" said Blakeney lightly; \"it will burn a hole\nin that elegant vest of yours.\"\n\n\"It will have no time to do that, Sir Percy,\" retorted Chauvelin\nblandly; \"an you will furnish me with citizen St. Just's present\naddress, I will myself convey the letter to him at once.\"\n\n\"At this hour of the night? Poor old Armand, he'll be abed. But his\naddress, sir, is No. 32, Rue de la Croix Blanche, on the first floor,\nthe door on your right as you mount the stairs; you know the room well,\ncitizen Chauvelin; you have been in it before. And now,\" he added with a\nloud and ostentatious yawn, \"shall we all to bed? We start at dawn, you\nsaid, and I am so d--d fatigued.\"\n\nFrankly, he did not look it now. Chauvelin himself, despite his matured\nplans, despite all the precautions that he meant to take for the success\nof this gigantic scheme, felt a sudden strange sense of fear creeping\ninto his bones. Half an hour ago he had seen a man in what looked\nlike the last stage of utter physical exhaustion, a hunched up figure,\nlistless and limp, hands that twitched nervously, the face as of a dying\nman. Now those outward symptoms were still there certainly; the face by\nthe light of the lamp still looked livid, the lips bloodless, the hands\nemaciated and waxen, but the eyes!--they were still hollow, with heavy\nlids still purple, but in their depths there was a curious, mysterious\nlight, a look that seemed to see something that was hidden to natural\nsight.\n\nCitizen Chauvelin thought that Heron, too, must be conscious of\nthis, but the Committee's agent was sprawling on a chair, sucking a\nshort-stemmed pipe, and gazing with entire animal satisfaction on the\nprisoner.\n\n\"The most perfect piece of work we have ever accomplished, you and I,\ncitizen Chauvelin,\" he said complacently.\n\n\"You think that everything is quite satisfactory?\" asked the other with\nanxious stress on his words.\n\n\"Everything, of course. Now you see to the letter. I will give final\norders for to-morrow, but I shall sleep in the guard-room.\"\n\n\"And I on that inviting bed,\" interposed the prisoner lightly, as he\nrose to his feet. \"Your servant, citizens!\"\n\nHe bowed his head slightly, and stood by the table whilst the two men\nprepared to go. Chauvelin took a final long look at the man whom he\nfirmly believed he had at last brought down to abject disgrace.\n\nBlakeney was standing erect, watching the two retreating figures--one\nslender hand was on the table. Chauvelin saw that it was leaning rather\nheavily, as if for support, and that even whilst a final mocking\nlaugh sped him and his colleague on their way, the tall figure of the\nconquered lion swayed like a stalwart oak that is forced to bend to the\nmighty fury of an all-compelling wind.\n\nWith a sigh of content Chauvelin took his colleague by the arm, and\ntogether the two men walked out of the cell.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX. KILL HIM!\n\nTwo hours after midnight Armand St. Just was wakened from sleep by a\nperemptory pull at his bell. In these days in Paris but one meaning\ncould as a rule be attached to such a summons at this hour of the night,\nand Armand, though possessed of an unconditional certificate of\nsafety, sat up in bed, quite convinced that for some reason which would\npresently be explained to him he had once more been placed on the list\nof the \"suspect,\" and that his trial and condemnation on a trumped-up\ncharge would follow in due course.\n\nTruth to tell, he felt no fear at the prospect, and only a very little\nsorrow. The sorrow was not for himself; he regretted neither life nor\nhappiness. Life had become hateful to him since happiness had fled with\nit on the dark wings of dishonour; sorrow such as he felt was only for\nJeanne! She was very young, and would weep bitter tears. She would be\nunhappy, because she truly loved him, and because this would be the\nfirst cup of bitterness which life was holding out to her. But she\nwas very young, and sorrow would not be eternal. It was better so. He,\nArmand St. Just, though he loved her with an intensity of passion that\nhad been magnified and strengthened by his own overwhelming shame,\nhad never really brought his beloved one single moment of unalloyed\nhappiness.\n\nFrom the very first day when he sat beside her in the tiny boudoir\nof the Square du Roule, and the heavy foot fall of Heron and his\nbloodhounds broke in on their first kiss, down to this hour which he\nbelieved struck his own death-knell, his love for her had brought more\ntears to her dear eyes than smiles to her exquisite mouth.\n\nHer he had loved so dearly, that for her sweet sake he had sacrificed\nhonour, friendship and truth; to free her, as he believed, from the\nhands of impious brutes he had done a deed that cried Cain-like for\nvengeance to the very throne of God. For her he had sinned, and because\nof that sin, even before it was committed, their love had been blighted,\nand happiness had never been theirs.\n\nNow it was all over. He would pass out of her life, up the steps of the\nscaffold, tasting as he mounted them the most entire happiness that he\nhad known since that awful day when he became a Judas.\n\nThe peremptory summons, once more repeated, roused him from his\nmeditations. He lit a candle, and without troubling to slip any of his\nclothes on, he crossed the narrow ante-chamber, and opened the door that\ngave on the landing.\n\n\"In the name of the people!\"\n\nHe had expected to hear not only those words, but also the grounding of\narms and the brief command to halt. He had expected to see before him\nthe white facings of the uniform of the Garde de Paris, and to feel\nhimself roughly pushed back into his lodging preparatory to the search\nbeing made of all his effects and the placing of irons on his wrists.\n\nInstead of this, it was a quiet, dry voice that said without undue\nharshness:\n\n\"In the name of the people!\"\n\nAnd instead of the uniforms, the bayonets and the scarlet caps with\ntricolour cockades, he was confronted by a slight, sable-clad figure,\nwhose face, lit by the flickering light of the tallow candle, looked\nstrangely pale and earnest.\n\n\"Citizen Chauvelin!\" gasped Armand, more surprised than frightened at\nthis unexpected apparition.\n\n\"Himself, citizen, at your service,\" replied Chauvelin with his quiet,\nironical manner. \"I am the bearer of a letter for you from Sir Percy\nBlakeney. Have I your permission to enter?\"\n\nMechanically Armand stood aside, allowing the other man to pass in. He\nclosed the door behind his nocturnal visitor, then, taper in hand, he\npreceded him into the inner room.\n\nIt was the same one in which a fortnight ago a fighting lion had been\nbrought to his knees. Now it lay wrapped in gloom, the feeble light of\nthe candle only lighting Armand's face and the white frill of his shirt.\nThe young man put the taper down on the table and turned to his visitor.\n\n\"Shall I light the lamp?\" he asked.\n\n\"Quite unnecessary,\" replied Chauvelin curtly. \"I have only a letter to\ndeliver, and after that to ask you one brief question.\"\n\nFrom the pocket of his coat he drew the letter which Blakeney had\nwritten an hour ago.\n\n\"The prisoner wrote this in my presence,\" he said as he handed the\nletter over to Armand. \"Will you read it?\"\n\nArmand took it from him, and sat down close to the table; leaning\nforward he held the paper near the light, and began to read. He read\nthe letter through very slowly to the end, then once again from the\nbeginning. He was trying to do that which Chauvelin had wished to do\nan hour ago; he was trying to find the inner meaning which he felt must\ninevitably lie behind these words which Percy had written with his own\nhand.\n\nThat these bare words were but a blind to deceive the enemy Armand never\ndoubted for a moment. In this he was as loyal as Marguerite would have\nbeen herself. Never for a moment did the suspicion cross his mind that\nBlakeney was about to play the part of a coward, but he, Armand, felt\nthat as a faithful friend and follower he ought by instinct to know\nexactly what his chief intended, what he meant him to do.\n\nSwiftly his thoughts flew back to that other letter, the one which\nMarguerite had given him--the letter full of pity and of friendship\nwhich had brought him hope and a joy and peace which he had thought at\none time that he would never know again. And suddenly one sentence in\nthat letter stood out so clearly before his eyes that it blurred the\nactual, tangible ones on the paper which even now rustled in his hand.\n\n\n\nBut if at any time you receive another letter from me--be its contents\nwhat they may--act in accordance with the letter, but send a copy of it\nat once to Ffoulkes or to Marguerite.\n\n\n\nNow everything seemed at once quite clear; his duty, his next actions,\nevery word that he would speak to Chauvelin. Those that Percy had\nwritten to him were already indelibly graven on his memory.\n\nChauvelin had waited with his usual patience, silent and imperturbable,\nwhile the young man read. Now when he saw that Armand had finished, he\nsaid quietly:\n\n\"Just one question, citizen, and I need not detain you longer. But first\nwill you kindly give me back that letter? It is a precious document\nwhich will for ever remain in the archives of the nation.\"\n\nBut even while he spoke Armand, with one of those quick intuitions\nthat come in moments of acute crisis, had done just that which he felt\nBlakeney would wish him to do. He had held the letter close to the\ncandle. A corner of the thin crisp paper immediately caught fire, and\nbefore Chauvelin could utter a word of anger, or make a movement to\nprevent the conflagration, the flames had licked up fully one half of\nthe letter, and Armand had only just time to throw the remainder on the\nfloor and to stamp out the blaze with his foot.\n\n\"I am sorry, citizen,\" he said calmly; \"an accident.\"\n\n\"A useless act of devotion,\" interposed Chauvelin, who already had\nsmothered the oath that had risen to his lips. \"The Scarlet Pimpernel's\nactions in the present matter will not lose their merited publicity\nthrough the foolish destruction of this document.\"\n\n\"I had no thought, citizen,\" retorted the young man, \"of commenting on\nthe actions of my chief, or of trying to deny them that publicity which\nyou seem to desire for them almost as much as I do.\"\n\n\"More, citizen, a great deal more! The impeccable Scarlet Pimpernel,\nthe noble and gallant English gentleman, has agreed to deliver into our\nhands the uncrowned King of France--in exchange for his own life and\nfreedom. Methinks that even his worst enemy would not wish for a better\nending to a career of adventure, and a reputation for bravery unequalled\nin Europe. But no more of this, time is pressing, I must help citizen\nHeron with his final preparations for his journey. You, of course,\ncitizen St. Just, will act in accordance with Sir Percy Blakeney's\nwishes?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Armand.\n\n\"You will present yourself at the main entrance of the house of Justice\nat six o'clock this morning.\"\n\n\"I will not fail you.\"\n\n\"A coach will be provided for you. You will follow the expedition as\nhostage for the good faith of your chief.\"\n\n\"I quite understand.\"\n\n\"H'm! That's brave! You have no fear, citizen St. Just?\"\n\n\"Fear of what, sir?\n\n\"You will be a hostage in our hands, citizen; your life a guarantee that\nyour chief has no thought of playing us false. Now I was thinking of--of\ncertain events--which led to the arrest of Sir Percy Blakeney.\"\n\n\"Of my treachery, you mean,\" rejoined the young man calmly, even\nthough his face had suddenly become pale as death. \"Of the damnable\nlie wherewith you cheated me into selling my honour, and made me what I\nam--a creature scarce fit to walk upon this earth.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" protested Chauvelin blandly.\n\n\"The damnable lie,\" continued Armand more vehemently, \"that hath made me\none with Cain and the Iscariot. When you goaded me into the hellish act,\nJeanne Lange was already free.\"\n\n\"Free--but not safe.\"\n\n\"A lie, man! A lie! For which you are thrice accursed. Great God, is it\nnot you that should have cause for fear? Methinks were I to strangle you\nnow I should suffer less of remorse.\"\n\n\"And would be rendering your ex-chief but a sorry service,\" interposed\nChauvelin with quiet irony. \"Sir Percy Blakeney is a dying man, citizen\nSt. Just; he'll be a dead man at dawn if I do not put in an appearance\nby six o'clock this morning. This is a private understanding between\ncitizen Heron and myself. We agreed to it before I came to see you.\"\n\n\"Oh, you take care of your own miserable skin well enough! But you need\nnot be afraid of me--I take my orders from my chief, and he has not\nordered me to kill you.\"\n\n\"That was kind of him. Then we may count on you? You are not afraid?\"\n\n\"Afraid that the Scarlet Pimpernel would leave me in the lurch because\nof the immeasurable wrong I have done to him?\" retorted Armand, proud\nand defiant in the name of his chief. \"No, sir, I am not afraid of that;\nI have spent the last fortnight in praying to God that my life might yet\nbe given for his.\"\n\n\"H'm! I think it most unlikely that your prayers will be granted,\ncitizen; prayers, I imagine, so very seldom are; but I don't know, I\nnever pray myself. In your case, now, I should say that you have not the\nslightest chance of the Deity interfering in so pleasant a manner. Even\nwere Sir Percy Blakeney prepared to wreak personal revenge on you, he\nwould scarcely be so foolish as to risk the other life which we shall\nalso hold as hostage for his good faith.\"\n\n\"The other life?\"\n\n\"Yes. Your sister, Lady Blakeney, will also join the expedition\nto-morrow. This Sir Percy does not yet know; but it will come as a\npleasant surprise for him. At the slightest suspicion of false play on\nSir Percy's part, at his slightest attempt at escape, your life and that\nof your sister are forfeit; you will both be summarily shot before his\neyes. I do not think that I need be more precise, eh, citizen St. Just?\"\n\nThe young man was quivering with passion. A terrible loathing for\nhimself, for his crime which had been the precursor of this terrible\nsituation, filled his soul to the verge of sheer physical nausea. A red\nfilm gathered before his eyes, and through it he saw the grinning face\nof the inhuman monster who had planned this hideous, abominable thing.\nIt seemed to him as if in the silence and the hush of the night, above\nthe feeble, flickering flame that threw weird shadows around, a group of\ndevils were surrounding him, and were shouting, \"Kill him! Kill him now!\nRid the earth of this hellish brute!\"\n\nNo doubt if Chauvelin had exhibited the slightest sign of fear, if he\nhad moved an inch towards the door, Armand, blind with passion, driven\nto madness by agonising remorse more even than by rage, would have\nsprung at his enemy's throat and crushed the life out of him as he would\nout of a venomous beast. But the man's calm, his immobility, recalled\nSt. Just to himself. Reason, that had almost yielded to passion again,\nfound strength to drive the enemy back this time, to whisper a warning,\nan admonition, even a reminder. Enough harm, God knows, had been done\nby tempestuous passion already. And God alone knew what terrible\nconsequences its triumph now might bring in its trial, and striking on\nArmand's buzzing ears Chauvelin's words came back as a triumphant and\nmocking echo:\n\n\"He'll be a dead man at dawn if I do not put in an appearance by six\no'clock.\"\n\nThe red film lifted, the candle flickered low, the devils vanished, only\nthe pale face of the Terrorist gazed with gentle irony out of the gloom.\n\n\"I think that I need not detain you any longer, citizen, St. Just,\" he\nsaid quietly; \"you can get three or four hours' rest yet before you need\nmake a start, and I still have a great many things to see to. I wish you\ngood-night, citizen.\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" murmured Armand mechanically.\n\nHe took the candle and escorted his visitor back to the door. He waited\non the landing, taper in hand, while Chauvelin descended the narrow,\nwinding stairs.\n\nThere was a light in the concierge's lodge. No doubt the woman had\nstruck it when the nocturnal visitor had first demanded admittance. His\nname and tricolour scarf of office had ensured him the full measure of\nher attention, and now she was evidently sitting up waiting to let him\nout.\n\nSt. Just, satisfied that Chauvelin had finally gone, now turned back to\nhis own rooms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL. GOD HELP US ALL\n\nHe carefully locked the outer door. Then he lit the lamp, for the candle\ngave but a flickering light, and he had some important work to do.\n\nFirstly, he picked up the charred fragment of the letter, and smoothed\nit out carefully and reverently as he would a relic. Tears had gathered\nin his eyes, but he was not ashamed of them, for no one saw them; but\nthey eased his heart, and helped to strengthen his resolve. It was a\nmere fragment that had been spared by the flame, but Armand knew every\nword of the letter by heart.\n\nHe had pen, ink and paper ready to his hand, and from memory wrote out\na copy of it. To this he added a covering letter from himself to\nMarguerite:\n\n\n\nThis--which I had from Percy through the hands of Chauvelin--I neither\nquestion nor understand.... He wrote the letter, and I have no thought\nbut to obey. In his previous letter to me he enjoined me, if ever he\nwrote to me again, to obey him implicitly, and to communicate with you.\nTo both these commands do I submit with a glad heart. But of this must I\ngive you warning, little mother--Chauvelin desires you also to accompany\nus to-morrow.... Percy does not know this yet, else he would never\nstart. But those fiends fear that his readiness is a blind... and that\nhe has some plan in his head for his own escape and the continued safety\nof the Dauphin.... This plan they hope to frustrate through holding you\nand me as hostages for his good faith. God only knows how gladly I would\ngive my life for my chief... but your life, dear little mother... is\nsacred above all.... I think that I do right in warning you. God help us\nall.\n\n\n\nHaving written the letter, he sealed it, together with the copy of\nPercy's letter which he had made. Then he took up the candle and went\ndownstairs.\n\nThere was no longer any light in the concierge's lodge, and Armand had\nsome difficulty in making himself heard. At last the woman came to the\ndoor. She was tired and cross after two interruptions of her night's\nrest, but she had a partiality for her young lodger, whose pleasant ways\nand easy liberality had been like a pale ray of sunshine through the\nsqualor of every-day misery.\n\n\"It is a letter, citoyenne,\" said Armand, with earnest entreaty, \"for my\nsister. She lives in the Rue de Charonne, near the fortifications, and\nmust have it within an hour; it is a matter of life and death to her, to\nme, and to another who is very dear to us both.\"\n\nThe concierge threw up her hands in horror.\n\n\"Rue de Charonne, near the fortifications,\" she exclaimed, \"and within\nan hour! By the Holy Virgin, citizen, that is impossible. Who will take\nit? There is no way.\"\n\n\"A way must be found, citoyenne,\" said Armand firmly, \"and at once; it\nis not far, and there are five golden louis waiting for the messenger!\"\n\nFive golden louis! The poor, hardworking woman's eyes gleamed at the\nthought. Five louis meant food for at least two months if one was\ncareful, and--\n\n\"Give me the letter, citizen,\" she said, \"time to slip on a warm\npetticoat and a shawl, and I'll go myself. It's not fit for the boy to\ngo at this hour.\"\n\n\"You will bring me back a line from my sister in reply to this,\" said\nArmand, whom circumstances had at last rendered cautious. \"Bring it up\nto my rooms that I may give you the five louis in exchange.\"\n\nHe waited while the woman slipped back into her room. She heard him\nspeaking to her boy; the same lad who a fortnight ago had taken the\ntreacherous letter which had lured Blakeney to the house into the fatal\nambuscade that had been prepared for him. Everything reminded Armand of\nthat awful night, every hour that he had since spent in the house had\nbeen racking torture to him. Now at last he was to leave it, and on an\nerrand which might help to ease the load of remorse from his heart.\n\nThe woman was soon ready. Armand gave her final directions as to how to\nfind the house; then she took the letter and promised to be very quick,\nand to bring back a reply from the lady.\n\nArmand accompanied her to the door. The night was dark, a thin drizzle\nwas falling; he stood and watched until the woman's rapidly walking\nfigure was lost in the misty gloom.\n\nThen with a heavy sigh he once more went within.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI. WHEN HOPE WAS DEAD\n\nIn a small upstairs room in the Rue de Charonne, above the shop of\nLucas the old-clothes dealer, Marguerite sat with Sir Andrew Ffoulkes.\nArmand's letter, with its message and its warning, lay open on the table\nbetween them, and she had in her hand the sealed packet which Percy had\ngiven her just ten days ago, and which she was only to open if all hope\nseemed to be dead, if nothing appeared to stand any longer between that\none dear life and irretrievable shame.\n\nA small lamp placed on the table threw a feeble yellow light on the\nsqualid, ill-furnished room, for it lacked still an hour or so before\ndawn. Armand's concierge had brought her lodger's letter, and Marguerite\nhad quickly despatched a brief reply to him, a reply that held love and\nalso encouragement.\n\nThen she had summoned Sir Andrew. He never had a thought of leaving her\nduring these days of dire trouble, and he had lodged all this while in a\ntiny room on the top-most floor of this house in the Rue de Charonne.\n\nAt her call he had come down very quickly, and now they sat together at\nthe table, with the oil-lamp illumining their pale, anxious faces; she\nthe wife and he the friend holding a consultation together in this most\nmiserable hour that preceded the cold wintry dawn.\n\nOutside a thin, persistent rain mixed with snow pattered against the\nsmall window panes, and an icy wind found out all the crevices in\nthe worm-eaten woodwork that would afford it ingress to the room. But\nneither Marguerite nor Ffoulkes was conscious of the cold. They had\nwrapped their cloaks round their shoulders, and did not feel the chill\ncurrents of air that caused the lamp to flicker and to smoke.\n\n\"I can see now,\" said Marguerite in that calm voice which comes so\nnaturally in moments of infinite despair--\"I can see now exactly what\nPercy meant when he made me promise not to open this packet until it\nseemed to me--to me and to you, Sir Andrew--that he was about to play\nthe part of a coward. A coward! Great God!\" She checked the sob that had\nrisen to her throat, and continued in the same calm manner and quiet,\neven voice:\n\n\"You do think with me, do you not, that the time has come, and that we\nmust open this packet?\"\n\n\"Without a doubt, Lady Blakeney,\" replied Ffoulkes with equal\nearnestness. \"I would stake my life that already a fortnight ago\nBlakeney had that same plan in his mind which he has now matured.\nEscape from that awful Conciergerie prison with all the precautions so\ncarefully taken against it was impossible. I knew that alas! from the\nfirst. But in the open all might yet be different. I'll not believe it\nthat a man like Blakeney is destined to perish at the hands of those\ncurs.\"\n\nShe looked on her loyal friend with tear-dimmed eyes through which shone\nboundless gratitude and heart-broken sorrow.\n\nHe had spoken of a fortnight! It was ten days since she had seen Percy.\nIt had then seemed as if death had already marked him with its grim\nsign. Since then she had tried to shut away from her mind the terrible\nvisions which her anguish constantly conjured up before her of his\ngrowing weakness, of the gradual impairing of that brilliant intellect,\nthe gradual exhaustion of that mighty physical strength.\n\n\"God bless you, Sir Andrew, for your enthusiasm and for your trust,\" she\nsaid with a sad little smile; \"but for you I should long ago have\nlost all courage, and these last ten days--what a cycle of misery they\nrepresent--would have been maddening but for your help and your loyalty.\nGod knows I would have courage for everything in life, for everything\nsave one, but just that, his death; that would be beyond my\nstrength--neither reason nor body could stand it. Therefore, I am so\nafraid, Sir Andrew,\" she added piteously.\n\n\"Of what, Lady Blakeney?\"\n\n\"That when he knows that I too am to go as hostage, as Armand says in\nhis letter, that my life is to be guarantee his, I am afraid that he\nwill draw back--that he will--my God!\" she cried with sudden fervour,\n\"tell me what to do!\"\n\n\"Shall we open the packet?\" asked Ffoulkes gently, \"and then just make\nup our minds to act exactly as Blakeney has enjoined us to do, neither\nmore nor less, but just word for word, deed for deed, and I believe that\nthat will be right--whatever may betide--in the end.\"\n\nOnce more his quiet strength, his earnestness and his faith comforted\nher. She dried her eyes and broke open the seal. There were two separate\nletters in the packet, one unaddressed, obviously intended for her and\nFfoulkes, the other was addressed to M. le baron Jean de Batz, 15, Rue\nSt. Jean de Latran a Paris.\n\n\"A letter addressed to that awful Baron de Batz,\" said Marguerite,\nlooking with puzzled eyes on the paper as she turned it over and over in\nher hand, \"to that bombastic windbag! I know him and his ways well! What\ncan Percy have to say to him?\"\n\nSir Andrew too looked puzzled. But neither of them had the mind to waste\ntime in useless speculations. Marguerite unfolded the letter which was\nintended for her, and after a final look on her friend, whose kind face\nwas quivering with excitement, she began slowly to read aloud:\n\n\n\nI need not ask either of you two to trust me, knowing that you will. But\nI could not die inside this hole like a rat in a trap--I had to try and\nfree myself, at the worst to die in the open beneath God's sky. You two\nwill understand, and understanding you will trust me to the end. Send\nthe enclosed letter at once to its address. And you, Ffoulkes, my most\nsincere and most loyal friend, I beg with all my soul to see to the\nsafety of Marguerite. Armand will stay by me--but you, Ffoulkes, do not\nleave her, stand by her. As soon as you read this letter--and you will\nnot read it until both she and you have felt that hope has fled and I\nmyself am about to throw up the sponge--try and persuade her to make\nfor the coast as quickly as may be.... At Calais you can open up\ncommunications with the Day-Dream in the usual way, and embark on her at\nonce. Let no member of the League remain on French soil one hour longer\nafter that. Then tell the skipper to make for Le Portel--the place which\nhe knows--and there to keep a sharp outlook for another three nights.\nAfter that make straight for home, for it will be no use waiting any\nlonger. I shall not come. These measures are for Marguerite's safety,\nand for you all who are in France at this moment. Comrade, I entreat you\nto look on these measures as on my dying wish. To de Batz I have given\nrendezvous at the Chapelle of the Holy Sepulchre, just outside the park\nof the Chateau d'Ourde. He will help me to save the Dauphin, and if\nby good luck he also helps me to save myself I shall be within seven\nleagues of Le Portel, and with the Liane frozen as she is I could reach\nthe coast.\n\nBut Marguerite's safety I leave in your hands, Ffoulkes. Would that I\ncould look more clearly into the future, and know that those devils\nwill not drag her into danger. Beg her to start at once for Calais\nimmediately you have both read this. I only beg, I do not command. I\nknow that you, Ffoulkes, will stand by her whatever she may wish to do.\nGod's blessing be for ever on you both.\n\n\n\nMarguerite's voice died away in the silence that still lay over this\ndeserted part of the great city and in this squalid house where she and\nSir Andrew Ffoulkes had found shelter these last ten days. The agony\nof mind which they had here endured, never doubting, but scarcely ever\nhoping, had found its culmination at last in this final message, which\nalmost seemed to come to them from the grave.\n\nIt had been written ten days ago. A plan had then apparently formed in\nPercy's mind which he had set forth during the brief half-hour's respite\nwhich those fiends had once given him. Since then they had never given\nhim ten consecutive minutes' peace; since then ten days had gone by how\nmuch power, how much vitality had gone by too on the leaden wings of all\nthose terrible hours spent in solitude and in misery?\n\n\"We can but hope, Lady Blakeney,\" said Sir Andrew Ffoulkes after a\nwhile, \"that you will be allowed out of Paris; but from what Armand\nsays--\"\n\n\"And Percy does not actually send me away,\" she rejoined with a pathetic\nlittle smile.\n\n\"No. He cannot compel you, Lady Blakeney. You are not a member of the\nLeague.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I am!\" she retorted firmly; \"and I have sworn obedience, just\nas all of you have done. I will go, just as he bids me, and you, Sir\nAndrew, you will obey him too?\"\n\n\"My orders are to stand by you. That is an easy task.\"\n\n\"You know where this place is?\" she asked--\"the Chateau d'Ourde?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, we all know it! It is empty, and the park is a wreck; the\nowner fled from it at the very outbreak of the revolution; he left some\nkind of steward nominally in charge, a curious creature, half imbecile;\nthe chateau and the chapel in the forest just outside the grounds have\noft served Blakeney and all of us as a place of refuge on our way to the\ncoast.\"\n\n\"But the Dauphin is not there?\" she said.\n\n\"No. According to the first letter which you brought me from Blakeney\nten days ago, and on which I acted, Tony, who has charge of the Dauphin,\nmust have crossed into Holland with his little Majesty to-day.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" she said simply. \"But then--this letter to de Batz?\"\n\n\"Ah, there I am completely at sea! But I'll deliver it, and at once too,\nonly I don't like to leave you. Will you let me get you out of Paris\nfirst? I think just before dawn it could be done. We can get the cart\nfrom Lucas, and if we could reach St. Germain before noon, I could come\nstraight back then and deliver the letter to de Batz. This, I feel, I\nought to do myself; but at Achard's farm I would know that you were safe\nfor a few hours.\"\n\n\"I will do whatever you think right, Sir Andrew,\" she said simply;\n\"my will is bound up with Percy's dying wish. God knows I would rather\nfollow him now, step by step,--as hostage, as prisoner--any way so long\nas I can see him, but--\"\n\nShe rose and turned to go, almost impassive now in that great calm born\nof despair.\n\nA stranger seeing her now had thought her indifferent. She was very\npale, and deep circles round her eyes told of sleepless nights and\ndays of mental misery, but otherwise there was not the faintest outward\nsymptom of that terrible anguish which was rending her heartstrings. Her\nlips did not quiver, and the source of her tears had been dried up ten\ndays ago.\n\n\"Ten minutes and I'll be ready, Sir Andrew,\" she said. \"I have but few\nbelongings. Will you the while see Lucas about the cart?\"\n\nHe did as she desired. Her calm in no way deceived him; he knew that she\nmust be suffering keenly, and would suffer more keenly still while she\nwould be trying to efface her own personal feelings all through that\ncoming dreary journey to Calais.\n\nHe went to see the landlord about the horse and cart, and a quarter of\nan hour later Marguerite came downstairs ready to start. She found Sir\nAndrew in close converse with an officer of the Garde de Paris, whilst\ntwo soldiers of the same regiment were standing at the horse's head.\n\nWhen she appeared in the doorway Sir Andrew came at once up to her.\n\n\"It is just as I feared, Lady Blakeney,\" he said; \"this man has been\nsent here to take charge of you. Of course, he knows nothing beyond the\nfact that his orders are to convey you at once to the guard-house of the\nRue Ste. Anne, where he is to hand you over to citizen Chauvelin of the\nCommittee of Public Safety.\"\n\nSir Andrew could not fail to see the look of intense relief which, in\nthe midst of all her sorrow, seemed suddenly to have lighted up the\nwhole of Marguerite's wan face. The thought of wending her own way to\nsafety whilst Percy, mayhap, was fighting an uneven fight with death\nhad been well-nigh intolerable; but she had been ready to obey without\na murmur. Now Fate and the enemy himself had decided otherwise. She felt\nas if a load had been lifted from her heart.\n\n\"I will at once go and find de Batz,\" Sir Andrew contrived to whisper\nhurriedly. \"As soon as Percy's letter is safely in his hands I will make\nmy way northwards and communicate with all the members of the League, on\nwhom the chief has so strictly enjoined to quit French soil immediately.\nWe will proceed to Calais first and open up communication with the\nDay-Dream in the usual way. The others had best embark on board her, and\nthe skipper shall then make for the known spot of Le Portel, of which\nPercy speaks in his letter. I myself will go by land to Le Portel, and\nthence, if I have no news of you or of the expedition, I will slowly\nwork southwards in the direction of the Chateau d'Ourde. That is all\nthat I can do. If you can contrive to let Percy or even Armand know my\nmovements, do so by all means. I know that I shall be doing right, for,\nin a way, I shall be watching over you and arranging for your safety, as\nBlakeney begged me to do. God bless you, Lady Blakeney, and God save the\nScarlet Pimpernel!\"\n\nHe stooped and kissed her hand, and she intimated to the officer that\nshe was ready. He had a hackney coach waiting for her lower down the\nstreet. To it she walked with a firm step, and as she entered it she\nwaved a last farewell to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII. THE GUARD-HOUSE OF THE RUE STE. ANNE\n\nThe little cortege was turning out of the great gates of the house of\nJustice. It was intensely cold; a bitter north-easterly gale was blowing\nfrom across the heights of Montmartre, driving sleet and snow and\nhalf-frozen rain into the faces of the men, and finding its way up their\nsleeves, down their collars and round the knees of their threadbare\nbreeches.\n\nArmand, whose fingers were numb with the cold, could scarcely feel the\nreins in his hands. Chauvelin was riding close beside him, but the two\nmen had not exchanged one word since the moment when the small troop\nof some twenty mounted soldiers had filed up inside the courtyard, and\nChauvelin, with a curt word of command, had ordered one of the troopers\nto take Armand's horse on the lead.\n\nA hackney coach brought up the rear of the cortege, with a man riding\nat either door and two more following at a distance of twenty paces.\nHeron's gaunt, ugly face, crowned with a battered, sugar-loaf hat,\nappeared from time to time at the window of the coach. He was no\nhorseman, and, moreover, preferred to keep the prisoner closely under\nhis own eye. The corporal had told Armand that the prisoner was with\ncitizen Heron inside the coach--in irons. Beyond that the soldiers could\ntell him nothing; they knew nothing of the object of this expedition.\nVaguely they might have wondered in their dull minds why this particular\nprisoner was thus being escorted out of the Conciergerie prison with so\nmuch paraphernalia and such an air of mystery, when there were thousands\nof prisoners in the city and the provinces at the present moment who\nanon would be bundled up wholesale into carts to be dragged to the\nguillotine like a flock of sheep to the butchers.\n\nBut even if they wondered they made no remarks among themselves.\nTheir faces, blue with the cold, were the perfect mirrors of their own\nunconquerable stolidity.\n\nThe tower clock of Notre Dame struck seven when the small cavalcade\nfinally moved slowly out of the monumental gates. In the east the wan\nlight of a February morning slowly struggled out of the surrounding\ngloom. Now the towers of many churches loomed ghostlike against the dull\ngrey sky, and down below, on the right, the frozen river, like a smooth\nsheet of steel, wound its graceful curves round the islands and past the\nfacade of the Louvres palace, whose walls looked grim and silent, like\nthe mausoleum of the dead giants of the past.\n\nAll around the great city gave signs of awakening; the business of the\nday renewed its course every twenty-four hours, despite the tragedies of\ndeath and of dishonour that walked with it hand in hand. From the Place\nde La Revolution the intermittent roll of drums came from time to time\nwith its muffled sound striking the ear of the passer-by. Along the quay\nopposite an open-air camp was already astir; men, women, and children\nengaged in the great task of clothing and feeding the people of France,\narmed against tyranny, were bending to their task, even before the\nwintry dawn had spread its pale grey tints over the narrower streets of\nthe city.\n\nArmand shivered under his cloak. This silent ride beneath the laden sky,\nthrough the veil of half-frozen rain and snow, seemed like a dream to\nhim. And now, as the outriders of the little cavalcade turned to cross\nthe Pont au Change, he saw spread out on his left what appeared like the\nliving panorama of these three weeks that had just gone by. He could\nsee the house of the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois where Percy had lodged\nbefore he carried through the rescue of the little Dauphin. Armand could\neven see the window at which the dreamer had stood, weaving noble dreams\nthat his brilliant daring had turned into realities, until the hand of a\ntraitor had brought him down to--to what? Armand would not have dared at\nthis moment to look back at that hideous, vulgar hackney coach wherein\nthat proud, reckless adventurer, who had defied Fate and mocked Death,\nsat, in chains, beside a loathsome creature whose very propinquity was\nan outrage.\n\nNow they were passing under the very house on the Quai de La Ferraille,\nabove the saddler's shop, the house where Marguerite had lodged ten days\nago, whither Armand had come, trying to fool himself into the belief\nthat the love of \"little mother\" could be deceived into blindness\nagainst his own crime. He had tried to draw a veil before those eyes\nwhich he had scarcely dared encounter, but he knew that that veil\nmust lift one day, and then a curse would send him forth, outlawed and\nhomeless, a wanderer on the face of the earth.\n\nSoon as the little cortege wended its way northwards it filed out\nbeneath the walls of the Temple prison; there was the main gate with its\nsentry standing at attention, there the archway with the guichet of the\nconcierge, and beyond it the paved courtyard. Armand closed his eyes\ndeliberately; he could not bear to look.\n\nNo wonder that he shivered and tried to draw his cloak closer around\nhim. Every stone, every street corner was full of memories. The chill\nthat struck to the very marrow of his bones came from no outward cause;\nit was the very hand of remorse that, as it passed over him, froze the\nblood in his veins and made the rattle of those wheels behind him sound\nlike a hellish knell.\n\nAt last the more closely populated quarters of the city were left\nbehind. On ahead the first section of the guard had turned into the Rue\nSt. Anne. The houses became more sparse, intersected by narrow pieces of\nterrains vagues, or small weed-covered bits of kitchen garden.\n\nThen a halt was called.\n\nIt was quite light now. As light as it would ever be beneath this leaden\nsky. Rain and snow still fell in gusts, driven by the blast.\n\nSome one ordered Armand to dismount. It was probably Chauvelin. He did\nas he was told, and a trooper led him to the door of an irregular brick\nbuilding that stood isolated on the right, extended on either side by\na low wall, and surrounded by a patch of uncultivated land, which now\nlooked like a sea of mud.\n\nOn ahead was the line of fortifications dimly outlined against the grey\nof the sky, and in between brown, sodden earth, with here and there\na detached house, a cabbage patch, a couple of windmills deserted and\ndesolate.\n\nThe loneliness of an unpopulated outlying quarter of the great mother\ncity, a useless limb of her active body, an ostracised member of her\nvast family.\n\nMechanically Armand had followed the soldier to the door of the\nbuilding. Here Chauvelin was standing, and bade him follow. A smell of\nhot coffee hung in the dark narrow passage in front. Chauvelin led the\nway to a room on the left.\n\nStill that smell of hot coffee. Ever after it was associated in Armand's\nmind with this awful morning in the guard-house of the Rue Ste. Anne,\nwhen the rain and snow beat against the windows, and he stood there in\nthe low guard-room shivering and half-numbed with cold.\n\nThere was a table in the middle of the room, and on it stood cups of\nhot coffee. Chauvelin bade him drink, suggesting, not unkindly, that the\nwarm beverage would do him good. Armand advanced further into the room,\nand saw that there were wooden benches all round against the wall. On\none of these sat his sister Marguerite.\n\nWhen she saw him she made a sudden, instinctive movement to go to him,\nbut Chauvelin interposed in his usual bland, quiet manner.\n\n\"Not just now, citizeness,\" he said.\n\nShe sat down again, and Armand noted how cold and stony seemed her eyes,\nas if life within her was at a stand-still, and a shadow that was almost\nlike death had atrophied every emotion in her.\n\n\"I trust you have not suffered too much from the cold, Lady Blakeney,\"\nresumed Chauvelin politely; \"we ought not to have kept you waiting here\nfor so long, but delay at departure is sometimes inevitable.\"\n\nShe made no reply, only acknowledging his reiterated inquiry as to her\ncomfort with an inclination of the head.\n\nArmand had forced himself to swallow some coffee, and for the moment he\nfelt less chilled. He held the cup between his two hands, and gradually\nsome warmth crept into his bones.\n\n\"Little mother,\" he said in English, \"try and drink some of this, it\nwill do you good.\"\n\n\"Thank you, dear,\" she replied. \"I have had some. I am not cold.\"\n\nThen a door at the end of the room was pushed open, and Heron stalked\nin.\n\n\"Are we going to be all day in this confounded hole?\" he queried\nroughly.\n\nArmand, who was watching his sister very closely, saw that she started\nat the sight of the wretch, and seemed immediately to shrink still\nfurther within herself, whilst her eyes, suddenly luminous and dilated,\nrested on him like those of a captive bird upon an approaching cobra.\n\nBut Chauvelin was not to be shaken out of his suave manner.\n\n\"One moment, citizen Heron,\" he said; \"this coffee is very comforting.\nIs the prisoner with you?\" he added lightly.\n\nHeron nodded in the direction of the other room.\n\n\"In there,\" he said curtly.\n\n\"Then, perhaps, if you will be so good, citizen, to invite him thither,\nI could explain to him his future position and our own.\"\n\nHeron muttered something between his fleshy lips, then he turned back\ntowards the open door, solemnly spat twice on the threshold, and nodded\nhis gaunt head once or twice in a manner which apparently was understood\nfrom within.\n\n\"No, sergeant, I don't want you,\" he said gruffly; \"only the prisoner.\"\n\nA second or two later Sir Percy Blakeney stood in the doorway; his hands\nwere behind his back, obviously hand-cuffed, but he held himself very\nerect, though it was clear that this caused him a mighty effort. As soon\nas he had crossed the threshold his quick glance had swept right round\nthe room.\n\nHe saw Armand, and his eyes lit up almost imperceptibly.\n\nThen he caught sight of Marguerite, and his pale face took on suddenly a\nmore ashen hue.\n\nChauvelin was watching him with those keen, light-coloured eyes of his.\nBlakeney, conscious of this, made no movement, only his lips tightened,\nand the heavy lids fell over the hollow eyes, completely hiding their\nglance.\n\nBut what even the most astute, most deadly enemy could not see was that\nsubtle message of understanding that passed at once between Marguerite\nand the man she loved; it was a magnetic current, intangible, invisible\nto all save to her and to him. She was prepared to see him, prepared to\nsee in him all that she had feared; the weakness, the mental exhaustion,\nthe submission to the inevitable. Therefore she had also schooled her\nglance to express to him all that she knew she would not be allowed to\nsay--the reassurance that she had read his last letter, that she had\nobeyed it to the last word, save where Fate and her enemy had interfered\nwith regard to herself.\n\nWith a slight, imperceptible movement--imperceptible to every one save\nto him, she had seemed to handle a piece of paper in her kerchief, then\nshe had nodded slowly, with her eyes--steadfast, reassuring--fixed upon\nhim, and his glance gave answer that he had understood.\n\nBut Chauvelin and Heron had seen nothing of this. They were satisfied\nthat there had been no communication between the prisoner and his wife\nand friend.\n\n\"You are no doubt surprised, Sir Percy,\" said Chauvelin after a while,\n\"to see Lady Blakeney here. She, as well as citizen St. Just, will\naccompany our expedition to the place where you will lead us. We none\nof us know where that place is--citizen Heron and myself are entirely in\nyour hands--you might be leading us to certain death, or again to a spot\nwhere your own escape would be an easy matter to yourself. You will\nnot be surprised, therefore, that we have thought fit to take certain\nprecautions both against any little ambuscade which you may have\nprepared for us, or against your making one of those daring attempts at\nescape for which the noted Scarlet Pimpernel is so justly famous.\"\n\nHe paused, and only Heron's low chuckle of satisfaction broke the\nmomentary silence that followed. Blakeney made no reply. Obviously he\nknew exactly what was coming. He knew Chauvelin and his ways, knew the\nkind of tortuous conception that would find origin in his brain; the\nmoment that he saw Marguerite sitting there he must have guessed that\nChauvelin once more desired to put her precious life in the balance of\nhis intrigues.\n\n\"Citizen Heron is impatient, Sir Percy,\" resumed Chauvelin after a\nwhile, \"so I must be brief. Lady Blakeney, as well as citizen St. Just,\nwill accompany us on this expedition to whithersoever you may lead\nus. They will be the hostages which we will hold against your own good\nfaith. At the slightest suspicion--a mere suspicion perhaps--that you\nhave played us false, at a hint that you have led us into an ambush, or\nthat the whole of this expedition has been but a trick on your part to\neffect your own escape, or if merely our hope of finding Capet at the\nend of our journey is frustrated, the lives of our two hostages belong\nto us, and your friend and your wife will be summarily shot before your\neyes.\"\n\nOutside the rain pattered against the window-panes, the gale whistled\nmournfully among the stunted trees, but within this room not a sound\nstirred the deadly stillness of the air, and yet at this moment hatred\nand love, savage lust and sublime self-abnegation--the most power full\npassions the heart of man can know--held three men here enchained; each\na slave to his dominant passion, each ready to stake his all for the\nsatisfaction of his master. Heron was the first to speak.\n\n\"Well!\" he said with a fierce oath, \"what are we waiting for? The\nprisoner knows how he stands. Now we can go.\"\n\n\"One moment, citizen,\" interposed Chauvelin, his quiet manner\ncontrasting strangely with his colleague's savage mood. \"You have quite\nunderstood, Sir Percy,\" he continued, directly addressing the prisoner,\n\"the conditions under which we are all of us about to proceed on this\njourney?\"\n\n\"All of us?\" said Blakeney slowly. \"Are you taking it for granted then\nthat I accept your conditions and that I am prepared to proceed on the\njourney?\"\n\n\"If you do not proceed on the journey,\" cried Heron with savage fury,\n\"I'll strangle that woman with my own hands--now!\"\n\nBlakeney looked at him for a moment or two through half-closed lids, and\nit seemed then to those who knew him well, to those who loved him and\nto the man who hated him, that the mighty sinews almost cracked with\nthe passionate desire to kill. Then the sunken eyes turned slowly to\nMarguerite, and she alone caught the look--it was a mere flash, of a\nhumble appeal for pardon.\n\nIt was all over in a second; almost immediately the tension on the\npale face relaxed, and into the eyes there came that look of\nacceptance--nearly akin to fatalism--an acceptance of which the strong\nalone are capable, for with them it only comes in the face of the\ninevitable.\n\nNow he shrugged his broad shoulders, and once more turning to Heron he\nsaid quietly:\n\n\"You leave me no option in that case. As you have remarked before,\ncitizen Heron, why should we wait any longer? Surely we can now go.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII. THE DREARY JOURNEY\n\nRain! Rain! Rain! Incessant, monotonous and dreary! The wind had changed\nround to the southwest. It blew now in great gusts that sent weird,\nsighing sounds through the trees, and drove the heavy showers into the\nfaces of the men as they rode on, with heads bent forward against the\ngale.\n\nThe rain-sodden bridles slipped through their hands, bringing out sores\nand blisters on their palms; the horses were fidgety, tossing their\nheads with wearying persistence as the wet trickled into their ears, or\nthe sharp, intermittent hailstones struck their sensitive noses.\n\nThree days of this awful monotony, varied only by the halts at wayside\ninns, the changing of troops at one of the guard-houses on the way, the\nreiterated commands given to the fresh squad before starting on the next\nlap of this strange, momentous way; and all the while, audible above\nthe clatter of horses' hoofs, the rumbling of coach-wheels--two closed\ncarriages, each drawn by a pair of sturdy horses; which were changed at\nevery halt. A soldier on each box urged them to a good pace to keep up\nwith the troopers, who were allowed to go at an easy canter or light\njog-trot, whatever might prove easiest and least fatiguing. And from\ntime to time Heron's shaggy, gaunt head would appear at the window of\none of the coaches, asking the way, the distance to the next city or\nto the nearest wayside inn; cursing the troopers, the coachman, his\ncolleague and every one concerned, blaspheming against the interminable\nlength of the road, against the cold and against the wet.\n\nEarly in the evening on the second day of the journey he had met with an\naccident. The prisoner, who presumably was weak and weary, and not over\nsteady on his feet, had fallen up against him as they were both about to\nre-enter the coach after a halt just outside Amiens, and citizen Heron\nhad lost his footing in the slippery mud of the road. His head came in\nviolent contact with the step, and his right temple was severely cut.\nSince then he had been forced to wear a bandage across the top of his\nface, under his sugar-loaf hat, which had added nothing to his beauty,\nbut a great deal to the violence of his temper. He wanted to push the\nmen on, to force the pace, to shorten the halts; but Chauvelin knew\nbetter than to allow slackness and discontent to follow in the wake of\nover-fatigue.\n\nThe soldiers were always well rested and well fed, and though the delay\ncaused by long and frequent halts must have been just as irksome to him\nas it was to Heron, yet he bore it imperturbably, for he would have had\nno use on this momentous journey for a handful of men whose enthusiasm\nand spirit had been blown away by the roughness of the gale, or drowned\nin the fury of the constant downpour of rain.\n\nOf all this Marguerite had been conscious in a vague, dreamy kind of\nway. She seemed to herself like the spectator in a moving panoramic\ndrama, unable to raise a finger or to do aught to stop that final,\ninevitable ending, the cataclysm of sorrow and misery that awaited her,\nwhen the dreary curtain would fall on the last act, and she and all the\nother spectators--Armand, Chauvelin, Heron, the soldiers--would slowly\nwend their way home, leaving the principal actor behind the fallen\ncurtain, which never would be lifted again.\n\nAfter that first halt in the guard-room of the Rue Ste. Anne she had\nbeen bidden to enter a second hackney coach, which, followed the other\nat a distance of fifty metres or so, and was, like that other, closely\nsurrounded by a squad of mounted men.\n\nArmand and Chauvelin rode in this carriage with her; all day she sat\nlooking out on the endless monotony of the road, on the drops of rain\nthat pattered against the window-glass, and ran down from it like a\nperpetual stream of tears.\n\nThere were two halts called during the day--one for dinner and one\nmidway through the afternoon--when she and Armand would step out of\nthe coach and be led--always with soldiers close around them--to some\nwayside inn, where some sort of a meal was served, where the atmosphere\nwas close and stuffy and smelt of onion soup and of stale cheese.\n\nArmand and Marguerite would in most cases have a room to themselves,\nwith sentinels posted outside the door, and they would try and eat\nenough to keep body and soul together, for they would not allow their\nstrength to fall away before the end of the journey was reached.\n\nFor the night halt--once at Beauvais and the second night at\nAbbeville--they were escorted to a house in the interior of the city,\nwhere they were accommodated with moderately clean lodgings. Sentinels,\nhowever, were always at their doors; they were prisoners in all but\nname, and had little or no privacy; for at night they were both so tired\nthat they were glad to retire immediately, and to lie down on the hard\nbeds that had been provided for them, even if sleep fled from their\neyes, and their hearts and souls were flying through the city in search\nof him who filled their every thought.\n\nOf Percy they saw little or nothing. In the daytime food was evidently\nbrought to him in the carriage, for they did not see him get down, and\non those two nights at Beauvais and Abbeville, when they caught sight of\nhim stepping out of the coach outside the gates of the barracks, he was\nso surrounded by soldiers that they only saw the top of his head and his\nbroad shoulders towering above those of the men.\n\nOnce Marguerite had put all her pride, all her dignity by, and asked\ncitizen Chauvelin for news of her husband.\n\n\"He is well and cheerful, Lady Blakeney,\" he had replied with his\nsarcastic smile. \"Ah!\" he added pleasantly, \"those English are\nremarkable people. We, of Gallic breed, will never really understand\nthem. Their fatalism is quite Oriental in its quiet resignation to the\ndecree of Fate. Did you know, Lady Blakeney, that when Sir Percy was\narrested he did not raise a hand. I thought, and so did my colleague,\nthat he would have fought like a lion. And now, that he has no doubt\nrealised that quiet submission will serve him best in the end, he is\nas calm on this journey as I am myself. In fact,\" he concluded\ncomplacently, \"whenever I have succeeded in peeping into the coach I\nhave invariably found Sir Percy Blakeney fast asleep.\"\n\n\"He--\" she murmured, for it was so difficult to speak to this callous\nwretch, who was obviously mocking her in her misery--\"he--you--you are\nnot keeping him in irons?\"\n\n\"No! Oh no!\" replied Chauvelin with perfect urbanity. \"You see, now\nthat we have you, Lady Blakeney, and citizen St. Just with us we have no\nreason to fear that that elusive Pimpernel will spirit himself away.\"\n\nA hot retort had risen to Armand's lips. The warm Latin blood in him\nrebelled against this intolerable situation, the man's sneers in the\nface of Marguerite's anguish. But her restraining, gentle hand had\nalready pressed his. What was the use of protesting, of insulting this\nbrute, who cared nothing for the misery which he had caused so long as\nhe gained his own ends?\n\nAnd Armand held his tongue and tried to curb his temper, tried to\ncultivate a little of that fatalism which Chauvelin had said was\ncharacteristic of the English. He sat beside his sister, longing to\ncomfort her, yet feeling that his very presence near her was an outrage\nand a sacrilege. She spoke so seldom to him, even when they were alone,\nthat at times the awful thought which had more than once found birth in\nhis weary brain became crystallised and more real. Did Marguerite guess?\nHad she the slightest suspicion that the awful cataclysm to which they\nwere tending with every revolution of the creaking coach-wheels had been\nbrought about by her brother's treacherous hand?\n\nAnd when that thought had lodged itself quite snugly in his mind he\nbegan to wonder whether it would not be far more simple, far more easy,\nto end his miserable life in some manner that might suggest itself on\nthe way. When the coach crossed one of those dilapidated, parapetless\nbridges, over abysses fifty metres deep, it might be so easy to throw\nopen the carriage door and to take one final jump into eternity.\n\nSo easy--but so damnably cowardly.\n\nMarguerite's near presence quickly brought him back to himself. His life\nwas no longer his own to do with as he pleased; it belonged to the chief\nwhom he had betrayed, to the sister whom he must endeavour to protect.\n\nOf Jeanne now he thought but little. He had put even the memory of her\nby--tenderly, like a sprig of lavender pressed between the faded leaves\nof his own happiness. His hand was no longer fit to hold that of any\npure woman--his hand had on it a deep stain, immutable, like the brand\nof Cain.\n\nYet Marguerite beside him held his hand and together they looked out on\nthat dreary, dreary road and listened to of the patter of the rain and\nthe rumbling of the wheels of that other coach on ahead--and it was all\nso dismal and so horrible, the rain, the soughing of the wind in the\nstunted trees, this landscape of mud and desolation, this eternally grey\nsky.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV. THE HALT AT CRECY\n\n\"Now, then, citizen, don't go to sleep; this is Crecy, our last halt!\"\n\nArmand woke up from his last dream. They had been moving steadily on\nsince they left Abbeville soon after dawn; the rumble of the wheels, the\nswaying and rocking of the carriage, the interminable patter of the rain\nhad lulled him into a kind of wakeful sleep.\n\nChauvelin had already alighted from the coach. He was helping Marguerite\nto descend. Armand shook the stiffness from his limbs and followed in\nthe wake of his sister. Always those miserable soldiers round them, with\ntheir dank coats of rough blue cloth, and the red caps on their heads!\nArmand pulled Marguerite's hand through his arm, and dragged her with\nhim into the house.\n\nThe small city lay damp and grey before them; the rough pavement of the\nnarrow street glistened with the wet, reflecting the dull, leaden sky\noverhead; the rain beat into the puddles; the slate-roofs shone in the\ncold wintry light.\n\nThis was Crecy! The last halt of the journey, so Chauvelin had said. The\nparty had drawn rein in front of a small one-storied building that had a\nwooden verandah running the whole length of its front.\n\nThe usual low narrow room greeted Armand and Marguerite as they entered;\nthe usual mildewed walls, with the colour wash flowing away in streaks\nfrom the unsympathetic beam above; the same device, \"Liberte, Egalite,\nFraternite!\" scribbled in charcoal above the black iron stove; the usual\nmusty, close atmosphere, the usual smell of onion and stale cheese,\nthe usual hard straight benches and central table with its soiled and\ntattered cloth.\n\nMarguerite seemed dazed and giddy; she had been five hours in\nthat stuffy coach with nothing to distract her thoughts except the\nrain-sodden landscape, on which she had ceaselessly gazed since the\nearly dawn.\n\nArmand led her to the bench, and she sank down on it, numb and inert,\nresting her elbows on the table and her head in her hands.\n\n\"If it were only all over!\" she sighed involuntarily. \"Armand, at times\nnow I feel as if I were not really sane--as if my reason had already\ngiven way! Tell me, do I seem mad to you at times?\"\n\nHe sat down beside her and tried to chafe her little cold hands.\n\nThere was a knock at the door, and without waiting for permission\nChauvelin entered the room.\n\n\"My humble apologies to you, Lady Blakeney,\" he said in his usual suave\nmanner, \"but our worthy host informs me that this is the only room in\nwhich he can serve a meal. Therefore I am forced to intrude my presence\nupon you.\"\n\nThough he spoke with outward politeness, his tone had become more\nperemptory, less bland, and he did not await Marguerite's reply before\nhe sat down opposite to her and continued to talk airily.\n\n\"An ill-conditioned fellow, our host,\" he said--\"quite reminds me of\nour friend Brogard at the Chat Gris in Calais. You remember him, Lady\nBlakeney?\"\n\n\"My sister is giddy and over-tired,\" interposed Armand firmly. \"I pray\nyou, citizen, to have some regard for her.\"\n\n\"All regard in the world, citizen St. Just,\" protested Chauvelin\njovially. \"Methought that those pleasant reminiscences would cheer\nher. Ah! here comes the soup,\" he added, as a man in blue blouse and\nbreeches, with sabots on his feet, slouched into the room, carrying a\ntureen which he incontinently placed upon the table. \"I feel sure that\nin England Lady Blakeney misses our excellent croutes-au-pot, the glory\nof our bourgeois cookery--Lady Blakeney, a little soup?\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Do try and eat something, little mother,\" Armand whispered in her ear;\n\"try and keep up your strength for his sake, if not for mine.\"\n\nShe turned a wan, pale face to him, and tried to smile.\n\n\"I'll try, dear,\" she said.\n\n\"You have taken bread and meat to the citizens in the coach?\" Chauvelin\ncalled out to the retreating figure of mine host.\n\n\"H'm!\" grunted the latter in assent.\n\n\"And see that the citizen soldiers are well fed, or there will be\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" grunted the man again. After which he banged the door to behind\nhim.\n\n\"Citizen Heron is loath to let the prisoner out of his sight,\" explained\nChauvelin lightly, \"now that we have reached the last, most important\nstage of our journey, so he is sharing Sir Percy's mid-day meal in the\ninterior of the coach.\"\n\nHe ate his soup with a relish, ostentatiously paying many small\nattentions to Marguerite all the time. He ordered meat for her--bread,\nbutter--asked if any dainties could be got. He was apparently in the\nbest of tempers.\n\nAfter he had eaten and drunk he rose and bowed ceremoniously to her.\n\n\"Your pardon, Lady Blakeney,\" he said, \"but I must confer with the\nprisoner now, and take from him full directions for the continuance of\nour journey. After that I go to the guard-house, which is some distance\nfrom here, right at the other end of the city. We pick up a fresh squad\nhere, twenty hardened troopers from a cavalry regiment usually stationed\nat Abbeville. They have had work to do in this town, which is a hot-bed\nof treachery. I must go inspect the men and the sergeant who will be in\ncommand. Citizen Heron leaves all these inspections to me; he likes to\nstay by his prisoner. In the meanwhile you will be escorted back to your\ncoach, where I pray you to await my arrival, when we change guard first,\nthen proceed on our way.\"\n\nMarguerite was longing to ask him many questions; once again she\nwould have smothered her pride and begged for news of her husband,\nbut Chauvelin did not wait. He hurried out of the room, and Armand and\nMarguerite could hear him ordering the soldiers to take them forthwith\nback to the coach.\n\nAs they came out of the inn they saw the other coach some fifty metres\nfurther up the street. The horses that had done duty since leaving\nAbbeville had been taken out, and two soldiers in ragged shirts, and\nwith crimson caps set jauntily over their left ear, were leading the two\nfresh horses along. The troopers were still mounting guard round both\nthe coaches; they would be relieved presently.\n\nMarguerite would have given ten years of her life at this moment for the\nprivilege of speaking to her husband, or even of seeing him--of seeing\nthat he was well. A quick, wild plan sprang up in her mind that she\nwould bribe the sergeant in command to grant her wish while citizen\nChauvelin was absent. The man had not an unkind face, and he must be\nvery poor--people in France were very poor these days, though the rich\nhad been robbed and luxurious homes devastated ostensibly to help the\npoor.\n\nShe was about to put this sudden thought into execution when Heron's\nhideous face, doubly hideous now with that bandage of doubtful\ncleanliness cutting across his brow, appeared at the carriage window.\n\nHe cursed violently and at the top of his voice.\n\n\"What are those d--d aristos doing out there?\" he shouted.\n\n\"Just getting into the coach, citizen,\" replied the sergeant promptly.\n\nAnd Armand and Marguerite were immediately ordered back into the coach.\n\nHeron remained at the window for a few moments longer; he had a\ntoothpick in his hand which he was using very freely.\n\n\"How much longer are we going to wait in this cursed hole?\" he called\nout to the sergeant.\n\n\"Only a few moments longer, citizen. Citizen Chauvelin will be back soon\nwith the guard.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour later the clatter of cavalry horses on the rough,\nuneven pavement drew Marguerite's attention. She lowered the carriage\nwindow and looked out. Chauvelin had just returned with the new escort.\nHe was on horseback; his horse's bridle, since he was but an indifferent\nhorseman, was held by one of the troopers.\n\nOutside the inn he dismounted; evidently he had taken full command of\nthe expedition, and scarcely referred to Heron, who spent most of his\ntime cursing at the men or the weather when he was not lying half-asleep\nand partially drunk in the inside of the carriage.\n\nThe changing of the guard was now accomplished quietly and in perfect\norder. The new escort consisted of twenty mounted men, including a\nsergeant and a corporal, and of two drivers, one for each coach. The\ncortege now was filed up in marching order; ahead a small party of\nscouts, then the coach with Marguerite and Armand closely surrounded by\nmounted men, and at a short distance the second coach with citizen Heron\nand the prisoner equally well guarded.\n\nChauvelin superintended all the arrangements himself. He spoke for some\nfew moments with the sergeant, also with the driver of his own coach. He\nwent to the window of the other carriage, probably in order to consult\nwith citizen Heron, or to take final directions from the prisoner,\nfor Marguerite, who was watching him, saw him standing on the step and\nleaning well forward into the interior, whilst apparently he was taking\nnotes on a small tablet which he had in his hand.\n\nA small knot of idlers had congregated in the narrow street; men in\nblouses and boys in ragged breeches lounged against the verandah of\nthe inn and gazed with inexpressive, stolid eyes on the soldiers, the\ncoaches, the citizen who wore the tricolour scarf. They had seen this\nsort of thing before now--aristos being conveyed to Paris under arrest,\nprisoners on their way to or from Amiens. They saw Marguerite's pale\nface at the carriage window. It was not the first woman's face they had\nseen under like circumstances, and there was no special interest about\nthis aristo. They were smoking or spitting, or just lounging idly\nagainst the balustrade. Marguerite wondered if none of them had wife,\nsister, or mother, or child; if every sympathy, every kind of feeling in\nthese poor wretches had been atrophied by misery or by fear.\n\nAt last everything was in order and the small party ready to start.\n\n\"Does any one here know the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, close by the\npark of the Chateau d'Ourde?\" asked Chauvelin, vaguely addressing the\nknot of gaffers that stood closest to him.\n\nThe men shook their heads. Some had dimly heard of the Chateau d'Ourde;\nit was some way in the interior of the forest of Boulogne, but no one\nknew about a chapel; people did not trouble about chapels nowadays. With\nthe indifference so peculiar to local peasantry, these men knew no more\nof the surrounding country than the twelve or fifteen league circle that\nwas within a walk of their sleepy little town.\n\nOne of the scouts on ahead turned in his saddle and spoke to citizen\nChauvelin:\n\n\"I think I know the way pretty well; citizen Chauvelin,\" he said; \"at\nany rate, I know it as far as the forest of Boulogne.\"\n\nChauvelin referred to his tablets.\n\n\"That's good,\" he said; \"then when you reach the mile-stone that stands\non this road at the confine of the forest, bear sharply to your\nright and skirt the wood until you see the hamlet of--Le--something.\nLe--Le--yes--Le Crocq--that's it in the valley below.\"\n\n\"I know Le Crocq, I think,\" said the trooper.\n\n\"Very well, then; at that point it seems that a wide road strikes at\nright angles into the interior of the forest; you follow that until a\nstone chapel with a colonnaded porch stands before you on your left, and\nthe walls and gates of a park on your right. That is so, is it not, Sir\nPercy?\" he added, once more turning towards the interior of the coach.\n\nApparently the answer satisfied him, for he gave the quick word of\ncommand, \"En avant!\" then turned back towards his own coach and finally\nentered it.\n\n\"Do you know the Chateau d'Ourde, citizen St. Just?\" he asked abruptly\nas soon as the carriage began to move.\n\nArmand woke--as was habitual with him these days--from some gloomy\nreverie.\n\n\"Yes, citizen,\" he replied. \"I know it.\"\n\n\"And the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre?\"\n\n\"Yes. I know it too.\"\n\nIndeed, he knew the chateau well, and the little chapel in the forest,\nwhither the fisher-folk from Portel and Boulogne came on a pilgrimage\nonce a year to lay their nets on the miracle-working relic. The chapel\nwas disused now. Since the owner of the chateau had fled no one had\ntended it, and the fisher-folk were afraid to wander out, lest their\nsuperstitious faith be counted against them by the authorities, who had\nabolished le bon Dieu.\n\nBut Armand had found refuge there eighteen months ago, on his way to\nCalais, when Percy had risked his life in order to save him--Armand--from\ndeath. He could have groaned aloud with the anguish of this\nrecollection. But Marguerite's aching nerves had thrilled at the name.\n\nThe Chateau d'Ourde! The Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre! That was the\nplace which Percy had mentioned in his letter, the place where he had\ngiven rendezvous to de Batz. Sir Andrew had said that the Dauphin could\nnot possibly be there, yet Percy was leading his enemies thither,\nand had given the rendezvous there to de Batz. And this despite that\nwhatever plans, whatever hopes, had been born in his mind when he was\nstill immured in the Conciergerie prison must have been set at naught by\nthe clever counter plot of Chauvelin and Heron.\n\n\"At the merest suspicion that you have played us false, at a hint that\nyou have led us into an ambush, or if merely our hopes of finding Capet\nat the end of the journey are frustrated, the lives of your wife and of\nyour friend are forfeit to us, and they will both be shot before your\neyes.\"\n\nWith these words, with this precaution, those cunning fiends had\neffectually not only tied the schemer's hands, but forced him either to\ndeliver the child to them or to sacrifice his wife and his friend.\n\nThe impasse was so horrible that she could not face it even in her\nthoughts. A strange, fever-like heat coursed through her veins, yet\nleft her hands icy-cold; she longed for, yet dreaded, the end of the\njourney--that awful grappling with the certainty of coming death.\nPerhaps, after all, Percy, too, had given up all hope. Long ago he had\nconsecrated his life to the attainment of his own ideals; and there\nwas a vein of fatalism in him; perhaps he had resigned himself to the\ninevitable, and his only desire now was to give up his life, as he had\nsaid, in the open, beneath God's sky, to draw his last breath with the\nstorm-clouds tossed through infinity above him, and the murmur of the\nwind in the trees to sing him to rest.\n\nCrecy was gradually fading into the distance, wrapped in a mantle of\ndamp and mist. For a long while Marguerite could see the sloping slate\nroofs glimmering like steel in the grey afternoon light, and the quaint\nchurch tower with its beautiful lantern, through the pierced stonework\nof which shone patches of the leaden sky.\n\nThen a sudden twist of the road hid the city from view; only the\noutlying churchyard remained in sight, with its white monuments and\ngranite crosses, over which the dark yews, wet with the rain and shaken\nby the gale, sent showers of diamond-like sprays.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV. THE FOREST OF BOULOGNE\n\nProgress was not easy, and very slow along the muddy road; the two\ncoaches moved along laboriously, with wheels creaking and sinking deeply\nfrom time to time in the quagmire.\n\nWhen the small party finally reached the edge of the wood the greyish\nlight of this dismal day had changed in the west to a dull reddish\nglow--a glow that had neither brilliance nor incandescence in it; only a\nweird tint that hung over the horizon and turned the distance into lines\nof purple.\n\nThe nearness of the sea made itself already felt; there was a briny\ntaste in the damp atmosphere, and the trees all turned their branches\naway in the same direction against the onslaught of the prevailing\nwinds.\n\nThe road at this point formed a sharp fork, skirting the wood on either\nside, the forest lying like a black close mass of spruce and firs on the\nleft, while the open expanse of country stretched out on the right. The\nsouth-westerly gale struck with full violence against the barrier of\nforest trees, bending the tall crests of the pines and causing their\nsmall dead branches to break and fall with a sharp, crisp sound like a\ncry of pain.\n\nThe squad had been fresh at starting; now the men had been four hours\nin the saddle under persistent rain and gusty wind; they were tired, and\nthe atmosphere of the close, black forest so near the road was weighing\nupon their spirits.\n\nStrange sounds came to them from out the dense network of trees--the\nscreeching of night-birds, the weird call of the owls, the swift and\nfurtive tread of wild beasts on the prowl. The cold winter and lack of\nfood had lured the wolves from their fastnesses--hunger had emboldened\nthem, and now, as gradually the grey light fled from the sky, dismal\nhowls could be heard in the distance, and now and then a pair of eyes,\nbright with the reflection of the lurid western glow, would shine\nmomentarily out of the darkness like tiny glow-worms, and as quickly\nvanish away.\n\nThe men shivered--more with vague superstitious fear than with cold.\nThey would have urged their horses on, but the wheels of the coaches\nstuck persistently in the mud, and now and again a halt had to be called\nso that the spokes and axles might be cleared.\n\nThey rode on in silence. No one had a mind to speak, and the mournful\nsoughing of the wind in the pine-trees seemed to check the words on\nevery lip. The dull thud of hoofs in the soft road, the clang of steel\nbits and buckles, the snorting of the horses alone answered the wind,\nand also the monotonous creaking of the wheels ploughing through the\nruts.\n\nSoon the ruddy glow in the west faded into soft-toned purple and then\ninto grey; finally that too vanished. Darkness was drawing in on\nevery side like a wide, black mantle pulled together closer and closer\noverhead by invisible giant hands.\n\nThe rain still fell in a thin drizzle that soaked through caps and\ncoats, made the bridles slimy and the saddles slippery and damp. A veil\nof vapour hung over the horses' cruppers, and was rendered fuller and\nthicker every moment with the breath that came from their nostrils. The\nwind no longer blew with gusty fury--its strength seemed to have been\nspent with the grey light of day--but now and then it would still come\nsweeping across the open country, and dash itself upon the wall of\nforest trees, lashing against the horses' ears, catching the corner of\na mantle here, an ill-adjusted cap there, and wreaking its mischievous\nfreak for a while, then with a sigh of satisfaction die, murmuring among\nthe pines.\n\nSuddenly there was a halt, much shouting, a volley of oaths from the\ndrivers, and citizen Chauvelin thrust his head out of the carriage\nwindow.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"The scouts, citizen,\" replied the sergeant, who had been riding close\nto the coach door all this while; \"they have returned.\"\n\n\"Tell one man to come straight to me and report.\"\n\nMarguerite sat quite still. Indeed, she had almost ceased to live\nmomentarily, for her spirit was absent from her body, which felt neither\nfatigue, nor cold, nor pain. But she heard the snorting of the horse\nclose by as its rider pulled him up sharply beside the carriage door.\n\n\"Well?\" said Chauvelin curtly.\n\n\"This is the cross-road, citizen,\" replied the man; \"it strikes straight\ninto the wood, and the hamlet of Le Crocq lies down in the valley on the\nright.\"\n\n\"Did you follow the road in the wood?\"\n\n\"Yes, citizen. About two leagues from here there is a clearing with a\nsmall stone chapel, more like a large shrine, nestling among the trees.\nOpposite to it the angle of a high wall with large wrought-iron gates at\nthe corner, and from these a wide drive leads through a park.\"\n\n\"Did you turn into the drive?\"\n\n\"Only a little way, citizen. We thought we had best report first that\nall is safe.\"\n\n\"You saw no one?\"\n\n\"No one.\"\n\n\"The chateau, then, lies some distance from the gates?\"\n\n\"A league or more, citizen. Close to the gates there are outhouses and\nstabling, the disused buildings of the home farm, I should say.\"\n\n\"Good! We are on the right road, that is clear. Keep ahead with your men\nnow, but only some two hundred metres or so. Stay!\" he added, as if on\nsecond thoughts. \"Ride down to the other coach and ask the prisoner if\nwe are on the right track.\"\n\nThe rider turned his horse sharply round. Marguerite heard-the clang of\nmetal and the sound of retreating hoofs.\n\nA few moments later the man returned.\n\n\"Yes, citizen,\" he reported, \"the prisoner says it is quite right. The\nChateau d'Ourde lies a full league from its gates. This is the nearest\nroad to the chapel and the chateau. He says we should reach the former\nin half an hour. It will be very dark in there,\" he added with a\nsignificant nod in the direction of the wood.\n\nChauvelin made no reply, but quietly stepped out of the coach.\nMarguerite watched him, leaning out of the window, following his\nsmall trim figure as he pushed his way past the groups of mounted men,\ncatching at a horse's bit now and then, or at a bridle, making a way for\nhimself amongst the restless, champing animals, without the slightest\nhesitation or fear.\n\nSoon his retreating figure lost its sharp outline silhouetted against\nthe evening sky. It was enfolded in the veil of vapour which was blown\nout of the horses' nostrils or rising from their damp cruppers;\nit became more vague, almost ghost-like, through the mist and the\nfast-gathering gloom.\n\nPresently a group of troopers hid him entirely from her view, but she\ncould hear his thin, smooth voice quite clearly as he called to citizen\nHeron.\n\n\"We are close to the end of our journey now, citizen,\" she heard him\nsay. \"If the prisoner has not played us false little Capet should be in\nour charge within the hour.\"\n\nA growl not unlike those that came from out the mysterious depths of the\nforest answered him.\n\n\"If he is not,\" and Marguerite recognised the harsh tones of citizen\nHeron--\"if he is not, then two corpses will be rotting in this wood\ntomorrow for the wolves to feed on, and the prisoner will be on his way\nback to Paris with me.\"\n\nSome one laughed. It might have been one of the troopers, more callous\nthan his comrades, but to Marguerite the laugh had a strange, familiar\nring in it, the echo of something long since past and gone.\n\nThen Chauvelin's voice once more came clearly to her ear:\n\n\"My suggestion, citizen,\" he was saying, \"is that the prisoner shall now\ngive me an order--couched in whatever terms he may think necessary--but\na distinct order to his friends to give up Capet to me without any\nresistance. I could then take some of the men with me, and ride as\nquickly as the light will allow up to the chateau, and take possession\nof it, of Capet, and of those who are with him. We could get along\nfaster thus. One man can give up his horse to me and continue the\njourney on the box of your coach. The two carriages could then follow at\nfoot pace. But I fear that if we stick together complete darkness\nwill overtake us and we might find ourselves obliged to pass a very\nuncomfortable night in this wood.\"\n\n\"I won't spend another night in this suspense--it would kill me,\"\ngrowled Heron to the accompaniment of one of his choicest oaths. \"You\nmust do as you think right--you planned the whole of this affair--see to\nit that it works out well in the end.\"\n\n\"How many men shall I take with me? Our advance guard is here, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"I couldn't spare you more than four more men--I shall want the others\nto guard the prisoners.\"\n\n\"Four men will be quite sufficient, with the four of the advance guard.\nThat will leave you twelve men for guarding your prisoners, and you\nreally only need to guard the woman--her life will answer for the\nothers.\"\n\nHe had raised his voice when he said this, obviously intending that\nMarguerite and Armand should hear.\n\n\"Then I'll ahead,\" he continued, apparently in answer to an assent\nfrom his colleague. \"Sir Percy, will you be so kind as to scribble the\nnecessary words on these tablets?\"\n\nThere was a long pause, during which Marguerite heard plainly the long\nand dismal cry of a night bird that, mayhap, was seeking its mate. Then\nChauvelin's voice was raised again.\n\n\"I thank you,\" he said; \"this certainly should be quite effectual. And\nnow, citizen Heron, I do not think that under the circumstances we need\nfear an ambuscade or any kind of trickery--you hold the hostages. And\nif by any chance I and my men are attacked, or if we encounter armed\nresistance at the chateau, I will despatch a rider back straightway to\nyou, and--well, you will know what to do.\"\n\nHis voice died away, merged in the soughing of the wind, drowned by\nthe clang of metal, of horses snorting, of men living and breathing.\nMarguerite felt that beside her Armand had shuddered, and that in the\ndarkness his trembling hand had sought and found hers.\n\nShe leaned well out of the window, trying to see. The gloom had gathered\nmore closely in, and round her the veil of vapour from the horses'\nsteaming cruppers hung heavily in the misty air. In front of her the\nstraight lines of a few fir trees stood out dense and black against the\ngreyness beyond, and between these lines purple tints of various tones\nand shades mingled one with the other, merging the horizon line with the\nsky. Here and there a more solid black patch indicated the tiny houses\nof the hamlet of Le Crocq far down in the valley below; from some of\nthese houses small lights began to glimmer like blinking yellow eyes.\nMarguerite's gaze, however, did not rest on the distant landscape--it\ntried to pierce the gloom that hid her immediate surroundings; the\nmounted men were all round the coach--more closely round her than the\ntrees in the forest. But the horses were restless, moving all the\ntime, and as they moved she caught glimpses of that other coach and of\nChauvelin's ghostlike figure, walking rapidly through the mist. Just for\none brief moment she saw the other coach, and Heron's head and shoulders\nleaning out of the window. If his sugar-loaf hat was on his head, and the\nbandage across his brow looked like a sharp, pale streak below it.\n\n\"Do not doubt it, citizen Chauvelin,\" he called out loudly in his harsh,\nraucous voice, \"I shall know what to do; the wolves will have their meal\nto-night, and the guillotine will not be cheated either.\"\n\nArmand put his arm round his sister's shoulders and gently drew her back\ninto the carriage.\n\n\"Little mother,\" he said, \"if you can think of a way whereby my life\nwould redeem Percy's and yours, show me that way now.\"\n\nBut she replied quietly and firmly:\n\n\"There is no way, Armand. If there is, it is in the hands of God.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI. OTHERS IN THE PARK\n\nChauvelin and his picked escort had in the meanwhile detached themselves\nfrom the main body of the squad. Soon the dull thud of their horses'\nhoofs treading the soft ground came more softly--then more softly still\nas they turned into the wood, and the purple shadows seemed to enfold\nevery sound and finally to swallow them completely.\n\nArmand and Marguerite from the depth of the carriage heard Heron's voice\nordering his own driver now to take the lead. They sat quite still and\nwatched, and presently the other coach passed them slowly on the road,\nits silhouette standing out ghostly and grim for a moment against the\nindigo tones of the distant country.\n\nHeron's head, with its battered sugar-loaf hat, and the soiled bandage\nround the brow, was as usual out of the carriage window. He leered\nacross at Marguerite when he saw the outline of her face framed by the\nwindow of the carriage.\n\n\"Say all the prayers you have ever known, citizeness,\" he said with a\nloud laugh, \"that my friend Chauvelin may find Capet at the chateau, or\nelse you may take a last look at the open country, for you will not see\nthe sun rise on it to-morrow. It is one or the other, you know.\"\n\nShe tried not to look at him; the very sight of him filled her with\nhorror--that blotched, gaunt face of his, the fleshy lips, that hideous\nbandage across his face that hid one of his eyes! She tried not to see\nhim and not to hear him laugh.\n\nObviously he too laboured under the stress of great excitement. So far\neverything had gone well; the prisoner had made no attempt at escape,\nand apparently did not mean to play a double game. But the crucial hour\nhad come, and with it darkness and the mysterious depths of the forest\nwith their weird sounds and sudden flashes of ghostly lights. They\nnaturally wrought on the nerves of men like Heron, whose conscience\nmight have been dormant, but whose ears were nevertheless filled with\nthe cries of innocent victims sacrificed to their own lustful ambitions\nand their blind, unreasoning hates.\n\nHe gave sharp orders to the men to close up round the carriages, and\nthen gave the curt word of command:\n\n\"En avant!\"\n\nMarguerite could but strain her ears to listen. All her senses, all her\nfaculties had merged into that of hearing, rendering it doubly keen. It\nseemed to her that she could distinguish the faint sound--that even as\nshe listened grew fainter and fainter yet--of Chauvelin and his squad\nmoving away rapidly into the thickness of the wood some distance already\nahead.\n\nClose to her there was the snorting of horses, the clanging and noise of\nmoving mounted men. Heron's coach had taken the lead; she could hear the\ncreaking of its wheels, the calls of the driver urging his beasts.\n\nThe diminished party was moving at foot-pace in the darkness that seemed\nto grow denser at every step, and through that silence which was so full\nof mysterious sounds.\n\nThe carriage rolled and rocked on its springs; Marguerite, giddy and\novertired, lay back with closed eyes, her hand resting in that of\nArmand. Time, space and distance had ceased to be; only Death, the\ngreat Lord of all, had remained; he walked on ahead, scythe on skeleton\nshoulder, and beckoned patiently, but with a sure, grim hand.\n\nThere was another halt, the coach-wheels groaned and creaked on their\naxles, one or two horses reared with the sudden drawing up of the curb.\n\n\"What is it now?\" came Heron's hoarse voice through the darkness.\n\n\"It is pitch-dark, citizen,\" was the response from ahead. \"The drivers\ncannot see their horses' ears. They wait to know if they may light their\nlanthorns and then lead their horses.\"\n\n\"They can lead their horses,\" replied Heron roughly, \"but I'll have no\nlanthorns lighted. We don't know what fools may be lurking behind trees,\nhoping to put a bullet through my head--or yours, sergeant--we don't\nwant to make a lighted target of ourselves--what? But let the drivers\nlead their horses, and one or two of you who are riding greys might\ndismount too and lead the way--the greys would show up perhaps in this\ncursed blackness.\"\n\nWhile his orders were being carried out, he called out once more:\n\n\"Are we far now from that confounded chapel?\"\n\n\"We can't be far, citizen; the whole forest is not more than six leagues\nwide at any point, and we have gone two since we turned into it.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" Heron's voice suddenly broke in hoarsely. \"What was that?\nSilence, I say. Damn you--can't you hear?\"\n\nThere was a hush--every ear straining to listen; but the horses were\nnot still--they continued to champ their bits, to paw the ground, and\nto toss their heads, impatient to get on. Only now and again there\nwould come a lull even through these sounds--a second or two, mayhap,\nof perfect, unbroken silence--and then it seemed as if right through the\ndarkness a mysterious echo sent back those same sounds--the champing of\nbits, the pawing of soft ground, the tossing and snorting of animals,\nhuman life that breathed far out there among the trees.\n\n\"It is citizen Chauvelin and his men,\" said the sergeant after a while,\nand speaking in a whisper.\n\n\"Silence--I want to hear,\" came the curt, hoarsely-whispered command.\n\nOnce more every one listened, the men hardly daring to breathe, clinging\nto their bridles and pulling on their horses' mouths, trying to keep\nthem still, and again through the night there came like a faint echo\nwhich seemed to throw back those sounds that indicated the presence of\nmen and of horses not very far away.\n\n\"Yes, it must be citizen Chauvelin,\" said Heron at last; but the tone of\nhis voice sounded as if he were anxious and only half convinced; \"but I\nthought he would be at the chateau by now.\"\n\n\"He may have had to go at foot-pace; it is very dark, citizen Heron,\"\nremarked the sergeant.\n\n\"En avant, then,\" quoth the other; \"the sooner we come up with him the\nbetter.\"\n\nAnd the squad of mounted men, the two coaches, the drivers and the\nadvance section who were leading their horses slowly restarted on the\nway. The horses snorted, the bits and stirrups clanged, and the springs\nand wheels of the coaches creaked and groaned dismally as the ramshackle\nvehicles began once more to plough the carpet of pine-needles that lay\nthick upon the road.\n\nBut inside the carriage Armand and Marguerite held one another tightly\nby the hand.\n\n\"It is de Batz--with his friends,\" she whispered scarce above her\nbreath.\n\n\"De Batz?\" he asked vaguely and fearfully, for in the dark he could not\nsee her face, and as he did not understand why she should suddenly be\ntalking of de Batz he thought with horror that mayhap her prophecy anent\nherself had come true, and that her mind wearied and over-wrought--had\nbecome suddenly unhinged.\n\n\"Yes, de Batz,\" she replied. \"Percy sent him a message, through me,\nto meet him--here. I am not mad, Armand,\" she added more calmly. \"Sir\nAndrew took Percy's letter to de Batz the day that we started from\nParis.\"\n\n\"Great God!\" exclaimed Armand, and instinctively, with a sense of\nprotection, he put his arms round his sister. \"Then, if Chauvelin or the\nsquad is attacked--if--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said calmly; \"if de Batz makes an attack on Chauvelin, or\nif he reaches the chateau first and tries to defend it, they will shoot\nus... Armand, and Percy.\"\n\n\"But is the Dauphin at the Chateau d'Ourde?\"\n\n\"No, no! I think not.\"\n\n\"Then why should Percy have invoked the aid of de Batz? Now, when--\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she murmured helplessly. \"Of course, when he wrote the\nletter he could not guess that they would hold us as hostages. He may\nhave thought that under cover of darkness and of an unexpected attack he\nmight have saved himself had he been alone; but now--now that you and I\nare here--Oh! it is all so horrible, and I cannot understand it all.\"\n\n\"Hark!\" broke in Armand, suddenly gripping her arm more tightly.\n\n\"Halt!\" rang the sergeant's voice through the night.\n\nThis time there was no mistaking the sound; already it came from no far\ndistance. It was the sound of a man running and panting, and now and\nagain calling out as he ran.\n\nFor a moment there was stillness in the very air, the wind itself\nwas hushed between two gusts, even the rain had ceased its incessant\npattering. Heron's harsh voice was raised in the stillness.\n\n\"What is it now?\" he demanded.\n\n\"A runner, citizen,\" replied the sergeant, \"coming through the wood from\nthe right.\"\n\n\"From the right?\" and the exclamation was accompanied by a volley of\noaths; \"the direction of the chateau? Chauvelin has been attacked; he is\nsending a messenger back to me. Sergeant--sergeant, close up round that\ncoach; guard your prisoners as you value your life, and--\"\n\nThe rest of his words were drowned in a yell of such violent fury that\nthe horses, already over-nervous and fidgety, reared in mad terror,\nand the men had the greatest difficulty in holding them in. For a few\nminutes noisy confusion prevailed, until the men could quieten their\nquivering animals with soft words and gentle pattings.\n\nThen the troopers obeyed, closing up round the coach wherein brother and\nsister sat huddled against one another.\n\nOne of the men said under his breath:\n\n\"Ah! but the citizen agent knows how to curse! One day he will break his\ngullet with the fury of his oaths.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile the runner had come nearer, always at the same\nbreathless speed.\n\nThe next moment he was challenged:\n\n\"Qui va la?\"\n\n\"A friend!\" he replied, panting and exhausted. \"Where is citizen Heron?\"\n\n\"Here!\" came the reply in a voice hoarse with passionate excitement.\n\"Come up, damn you. Be quick!\"\n\n\"A lanthorn, citizen,\" suggested one of the drivers.\n\n\"No--no--not now. Here! Where the devil are we?\"\n\n\"We are close to the chapel on our left, citizen,\" said the sergeant.\n\nThe runner, whose eyes were no doubt accustomed to the gloom, had drawn\nnearer to the carriage.\n\n\"The gates of the chateau,\" he said, still somewhat breathlessly, \"are\njust opposite here on the right, citizen. I have just come through\nthem.\"\n\n\"Speak up, man!\" and Heron's voice now sounded as if choked with\npassion. \"Citizen Chauvelin sent you?\"\n\n\"Yes. He bade me tell you that he has gained access to the chateau, and\nthat Capet is not there.\"\n\nA series of citizen Heron's choicest oaths interrupted the man's speech.\nThen he was curtly ordered to proceed, and he resumed his report.\n\n\"Citizen Chauvelin rang at the door of the chateau; after a while he was\nadmitted by an old servant, who appeared to be in charge, but the place\nseemed otherwise absolutely deserted--only--\"\n\n\"Only what? Go on; what is it?\"\n\n\"As we rode through the park it seemed to us as if we were being\nwatched, and followed. We heard distinctly the sound of horses behind\nand around us, but we could see nothing; and now, when I ran back, again\nI heard. There are others in the park to-night besides us, citizen.\"\n\nThere was silence after that. It seemed as if the flood of Heron's\nblasphemous eloquence had spent itself at last.\n\n\"Others in the park!\" And now his voice was scarcely above a whisper,\nhoarse and trembling. \"How many? Could you see?\"\n\n\"No, citizen, we could not see; but there are horsemen lurking round the\nchateau now. Citizen Chauvelin took four men into the house with him and\nleft the others on guard outside. He bade me tell you that it might be\nsafer to send him a few more men if you could spare them. There are\na number of disused farm buildings quite close to the gates, and he\nsuggested that all the horses be put up there for the night, and that\nthe men come up to the chateau on foot; it would be quicker and safer,\nfor the darkness is intense.\"\n\nEven while the man spoke the forest in the distance seemed to wake from\nits solemn silence, the wind on its wings brought sounds of life and\nmovement different from the prowling of beasts or the screeching of\nnight-birds. It was the furtive advance of men, the quick whispers of\ncommand, of encouragement, of the human animal preparing to attack his\nkind. But all in the distance still, all muffled, all furtive as yet.\n\n\"Sergeant!\" It was Heron's voice, but it too was subdued, and almost\ncalm now; \"can you see the chapel?\"\n\n\"More clearly, citizen,\" replied the sergeant. \"It is on our left; quite\na small building, I think.\"\n\n\"Then dismount, and walk all round it. See that there are no windows or\ndoor in the rear.\"\n\nThere was a prolonged silence, during which those distant sounds of men\nmoving, of furtive preparations for attack, struck distinctly through\nthe night.\n\nMarguerite and Armand, clinging to one another, not knowing what to\nthink, nor yet what to fear, heard the sounds mingling with those\nimmediately round them, and Marguerite murmured under her breath:\n\n\"It is de Batz and some of his friends; but what can they do? What can\nPercy hope for now?\"\n\nBut of Percy she could hear and see nothing. The darkness and the\nsilence had drawn their impenetrable veil between his unseen presence\nand her own consciousness. She could see the coach in which he was, but\nHeron's hideous personality, his head with its battered hat and soiled\nbandage, had seemed to obtrude itself always before her gaze, blotting\nout from her mind even the knowledge that Percy was there not fifty\nyards away from her.\n\nSo strong did this feeling grow in her that presently the awful dread\nseized upon her that he was no longer there; that he was dead, worn out\nwith fatigue and illness brought on by terrible privations, or if not\ndead that he had swooned, that he was unconscious--his spirit absent\nfrom his body. She remembered that frightful yell of rage and hate which\nHeron had uttered a few minutes ago. Had the brute vented his fury on\nhis helpless, weakened prisoner, and stilled forever those lips that,\nmayhap, had mocked him to the last?\n\nMarguerite could not guess. She hardly knew what to hope. Vaguely, when\nthe thought of Percy lying dead beside his enemy floated through her\naching brain, she was almost conscious of a sense of relief at the\nthought that at least he would be spared the pain of the final,\ninevitable cataclysm.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII. THE CHAPEL OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE\n\nThe sergeant's voice broke in upon her misery.\n\nThe man had apparently done as the citizen agent had ordered, and had\nclosely examined the little building that stood on the left--a vague,\nblack mass more dense than the surrounding gloom.\n\n\"It is all solid stone, citizen,\" he said; \"iron gates in front, closed\nbut not locked, rusty key in the lock, which turns quite easily; no\nwindows or door in the rear.\"\n\n\"You are quite sure?\"\n\n\"Quite certain, citizen; it is plain, solid stone at the back, and the\nonly possible access to the interior is through the iron gate in front.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nMarguerite could only just hear Heron speaking to the sergeant. Darkness\nenveloped every form and deadened every sound. Even the harsh voice\nwhich she had learned to loathe and to dread sounded curiously subdued\nand unfamiliar. Heron no longer seemed inclined to storm, to rage, or\nto curse. The momentary danger, the thought of failure, the hope\nof revenge, had apparently cooled his temper, strengthened his\ndetermination, and forced his voice down to a little above a whisper. He\ngave his orders clearly and firmly, and the words came to Marguerite on\nthe wings of the wind with strange distinctness, borne to her ears by\nthe darkness itself, and the hush that lay over the wood.\n\n\"Take half a dozen men with you, sergeant,\" she beard him say, \"and join\ncitizen Chauvelin at the chateau. You can stable your horses in the farm\nbuildings close by, as he suggests and run to him on foot. You and your\nmen should quickly get the best of a handful of midnight prowlers; you\nare well armed and they only civilians. Tell citizen Chauvelin that I\nin the meanwhile will take care of our prisoners. The Englishman I shall\nput in irons and lock up inside the chapel, with five men under the\ncommand of your corporal to guard him, the other two I will drive myself\nstraight to Crecy with what is left of the escort. You understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, citizen.\"\n\n\"We may not reach Crecy until two hours after midnight, but directly\nI arrive I will send citizen Chauvelin further reinforcements, which,\nhowever, I hope may not necessary, but which will reach him in the early\nmorning. Even if he is seriously attacked, he can, with fourteen men he\nwill have with him, hold out inside the castle through the night. Tell\nhim also that at dawn two prisoners who will be with me will be shot in\nthe courtyard of the guard-house at Crecy, but that whether he has got\nhold of Capet or not he had best pick up the Englishman in the chapel in\nthe morning and bring him straight to Crecy, where I shall be awaiting\nhim ready to return to Paris. You understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, citizen.\"\n\n\"Then repeat what I said.\"\n\n\"I am to take six men with me to reinforce citizen Chauvelin now.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you, citizen, will drive straight back to Crecy, and will send\nus further reinforcements from there, which will reach us in the early\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"We are to hold the chateau against those unknown marauders if necessary\nuntil the reinforcements come from Crecy. Having routed them, we return\nhere, pick up the Englishman whom you will have locked up in the\nchapel under a strong guard commanded by Corporal Cassard, and join you\nforthwith at Crecy.\"\n\n\"This, whether citizen Chauvelin has got hold of Capet or not.\"\n\n\"Yes, citizen, I understand,\" concluded the sergeant imperturbably; \"and\nI am also to tell citizen Chauvelin that the two prisoners will be shot\nat dawn in the courtyard of the guard-house at Crecy.\"\n\n\"Yes. That is all. Try to find the leader of the attacking party, and\nbring him along to Crecy with the Englishman; but unless they are\nin very small numbers do not trouble about the others. Now en avant;\ncitizen Chauvelin might be glad of your help. And--stay--order all the\nmen to dismount, and take the horses out of one of the coaches, then\nlet the men you are taking with you each lead a horse, or even two, and\nstable them all in the farm buildings. I shall not need them, and could\nnot spare any of my men for the work later on. Remember that, above\nall, silence is the order. When you are ready to start, come back to me\nhere.\"\n\nThe sergeant moved away, and Marguerite heard him transmitting the\ncitizen agent's orders to the soldiers. The dismounting was carried\non in wonderful silence--for silence had been one of the principal\ncommands--only one or two words reached her ears.\n\n\"First section and first half of second section fall in, right wheel.\nFirst section each take two horses on the lead. Quietly now there; don't\ntug at his bridle--let him go.\"\n\nAnd after that a simple report:\n\n\"All ready, citizen!\"\n\n\"Good!\" was the response. \"Now detail your corporal and two men to come\nhere to me, so that we may put the Englishman in irons, and take him\nat once to the chapel, and four men to stand guard at the doors of the\nother coach.\"\n\nThe necessary orders were given, and after that there came the curt\ncommand:\n\n\"En avant!\"\n\nThe sergeant, with his squad and all the horses, was slowly moving away\nin the night. The horses' hoofs hardly made a noise on the soft carpet\nof pine-needles and of dead fallen leaves, but the champing of the bits\nwas of course audible, and now and then the snorting of some poor, tired\nhorse longing for its stable.\n\nSomehow in Marguerite's fevered mind this departure of a squad of men\nseemed like the final flitting of her last hope; the slow agony of the\nfamiliar sounds, the retreating horses and soldiers moving away amongst\nthe shadows, took on a weird significance. Heron had given his last\norders. Percy, helpless and probably unconscious, would spend the night\nin that dank chapel, while she and Armand would be taken back to Crecy,\ndriven to death like some insentient animals to the slaughter.\n\nWhen the grey dawn would first begin to peep through the branches of the\npines Percy would be led back to Paris and the guillotine, and she and\nArmand will have been sacrificed to the hatred and revenge of brutes.\n\nThe end had come, and there was nothing more to be done. Struggling,\nfighting, scheming, could be of no avail now; but she wanted to get to\nher husband; she wanted to be near him now that death was so imminent\nboth for him and for her.\n\nShe tried to envisage it all, quite calmly, just as she knew that Percy\nwould wish her to do. The inevitable end was there, and she would\nnot give to these callous wretches here the gratuitous spectacle of a\ndespairing woman fighting blindly against adverse Fate.\n\nBut she wanted to go to her husband. She felt that she could face death\nmore easily on the morrow if she could but see him once, if she could\nbut look once more into the eyes that had mirrored so much enthusiasm,\nsuch absolute vitality and whole-hearted self-sacrifice, and such an\nintensity of love and passion; if she could but kiss once more those\nlips that had smiled through life, and would smile, she knew, even in\nthe face of death.\n\nShe tried to open the carriage door, but it was held from without, and a\nharsh voice cursed her, ordering her to sit still.\n\nBut she could lean out of the window and strain her eyes to see. They\nwere by now accustomed to the gloom, the dilated pupils taking in\npictures of vague forms moving like ghouls in the shadows. The other\ncoach was not far, and she could hear Heron's voice, still subdued and\ncalm, and the curses of the men. But not a sound from Percy.\n\n\"I think the prisoner is unconscious,\" she heard one of the men say.\n\n\"Lift him out of the carriage, then,\" was Heron's curt command; \"and you\ngo and throw open the chapel gates.\"\n\nMarguerite saw it all. The movement, the crowd of men, two vague, black\nforms lifting another one, which appeared heavy and inert, out of the\ncoach, and carrying it staggering up towards the chapel.\n\nThen the forms disappeared, swallowed up by the more dense mass of the\nlittle building, merged in with it, immovable as the stone itself.\n\nOnly a few words reached her now.\n\n\"He is unconscious.\"\n\n\"Leave him there, then; he'll not move!\"\n\n\"Now close the gates!\"\n\nThere was a loud clang, and Marguerite gave a piercing scream. She tore\nat the handle of the carriage door.\n\n\"Armand, Armand, go to him!\" she cried; and all her self-control, all\nher enforced calm, vanished in an outburst of wild, agonising passion.\n\"Let me get to him, Armand! This is the end; get me to him, in the name\nof God!\"\n\n\"Stop that woman screaming,\" came Heron's voice clearly through the\nnight. \"Put her and the other prisoner in irons--quick!\"\n\nBut while Marguerite expended her feeble strength in a mad, pathetic\neffort to reach her husband, even now at this last hour, when all hope\nwas dead and Death was so nigh, Armand had already wrenched the carriage\ndoor from the grasp of the soldier who was guarding it. He was of the\nSouth, and knew the trick of charging an unsuspecting adversary with\nhead thrust forward like a bull inside a ring. Thus he knocked one of\nthe soldiers down and made a quick rush for the chapel gates.\n\nThe men, attacked so suddenly and in such complete darkness, did not\nwait for orders. They closed in round Armand; one man drew his sabre and\nhacked away with it in aimless rage.\n\nBut for the moment he evaded them all, pushing his way through them,\nnot heeding the blows that came on him from out the darkness. At last he\nreached the chapel. With one bound he was at the gate, his numb fingers\nfumbling for the lock, which he could not see.\n\nIt was a vigorous blow from Heron's fist that brought him at last to his\nknees, and even then his hands did not relax their hold; they gripped\nthe ornamental scroll of the gate, shook the gate itself in its rusty\nhinges, pushed and pulled with the unreasoning strength of despair.\nHe had a sabre cut across his brow, and the blood flowed in a warm,\ntrickling stream down his face. But of this he was unconscious; all that\nhe wanted, all that he was striving for with agonising heart-beats\nand cracking sinews, was to get to his friend, who was lying in there\nunconscious, abandoned--dead, perhaps.\n\n\"Curse you,\" struck Heron's voice close to his ear. \"Cannot some of you\nstop this raving maniac?\"\n\nThen it was that the heavy blow on his head caused him a sensation of\nsickness, and he fell on his knees, still gripping the ironwork.\n\nStronger hands than his were forcing him to loosen his hold; blows that\nhurt terribly rained on his numbed fingers; he felt himself dragged\naway, carried like an inert mass further and further from that gate\nwhich he would have given his lifeblood to force open.\n\nAnd Marguerite heard all this from the inside of the coach where she was\nimprisoned as effectually as was Percy's unconscious body inside that\ndark chapel. She could hear the noise and scramble, and Heron's hoarse\ncommands, the swift sabre strokes as they cut through the air.\n\nAlready a trooper had clapped irons on her wrists, two others held the\ncarriage doors. Now Armand was lifted back into the coach, and she could\nnot even help to make him comfortable, though as he was lifted in she\nheard him feebly moaning. Then the carriage doors were banged to again.\n\n\"Do not allow either of the prisoners out again, on peril of your\nlives!\" came with a vigorous curse from Heron.\n\nAfter which there was a moment's silence; whispered commands came\nspasmodically in deadened sound to her ear.\n\n\"Will the key turn?\"\n\n\"Yes, citizen.\"\n\n\"All secure?\"\n\n\"Yes, citizen. The prisoner is groaning.\"\n\n\"Let him groan.\"\n\n\"The empty coach, citizen? The horses have been taken out.\"\n\n\"Leave it standing where it is, then; citizen Chauvelin will need it in\nthe morning.\"\n\n\"Armand,\" whispered Marguerite inside the coach, \"did you see Percy?\"\n\n\"It was so dark,\" murmured Armand feebly; \"but I saw him, just inside\nthe gates, where they had laid him down. I heard him groaning. Oh, my\nGod!\"\n\n\"Hush, dear!\" she said. \"We can do nothing more, only die, as he lived,\nbravely and with a smile on our lips, in memory of him.\"\n\n\"Number 35 is wounded, citizen,\" said one of the men.\n\n\"Curse the fool who did the mischief,\" was the placid response. \"Leave\nhim here with the guard.\"\n\n\"How many of you are there left, then?\" asked the same voice a moment\nlater.\n\n\"Only two, citizen; if one whole section remains with me at the chapel\ndoor, and also the wounded man.\"\n\n\"Two are enough for me, and five are not too many at the chapel door.\"\nAnd Heron's coarse, cruel laugh echoed against the stone walls of the\nlittle chapel. \"Now then, one of you get into the coach, and the other\ngo to the horses' heads; and remember, Corporal Cassard, that you and\nyour men who stay here to guard that chapel door are answerable to the\nwhole nation with your lives for the safety of the Englishman.\"\n\nThe carriage door was thrown open, and a soldier stepped in and sat down\nopposite Marguerite and Armand. Heron in the meanwhile was apparently\nscrambling up the box. Marguerite could hear him muttering curses as he\ngroped for the reins, and finally gathered them into his hand.\n\nThe springs of the coach creaked and groaned as the vehicle slowly\nswung round; the wheels ploughed deeply through the soft carpet of dead\nleaves.\n\nMarguerite felt Armand's inert body leaning heavily against her\nshoulder.\n\n\"Are you in pain, dear?\" she asked softly.\n\nHe made no reply, and she thought that he had fainted. It was better\nso; at least the next dreary hours would flit by for him in the blissful\nstate of unconsciousness. Now at last the heavy carriage began to move\nmore evenly. The soldier at the horses' heads was stepping along at a\nrapid pace.\n\nMarguerite would have given much even now to look back once more at\nthe dense black mass, blacker and denser than any shadow that had ever\ndescended before on God's earth, which held between its cold, cruel\nwalls all that she loved in the world.\n\nBut her wrists were fettered by the irons, which cut into her flesh when\nshe moved. She could no longer lean out of the window, and she could\nnot even hear. The whole forest was hushed, the wind was lulled to rest;\nwild beasts and night-birds were silent and still. And the wheels of the\ncoach creaked in the ruts, bearing Marguerite with every turn further\nand further away from the man who lay helpless in the chapel of the Holy\nSepulchre.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII. THE WANING MOON\n\nArmand had wakened from his attack of faintness, and brother and sister\nsat close to one another, shoulder touching shoulder. That sense of\nnearness was the one tiny spark of comfort to both of them on this\ndreary, dreary way.\n\nThe coach had lumbered on unceasingly since all eternity--so it seemed\nto them both. Once there had been a brief halt, when Heron's rough voice\nhad ordered the soldier at the horses' heads to climb on the box beside\nhim, and once--it had been a very little while ago--a terrible cry of\npain and terror had rung through the stillness of the night. Immediately\nafter that the horses had been put at a more rapid pace, but it had\nseemed to Marguerite as if that one cry of pain had been repeated by\nseveral others which sounded more feeble and soon appeared to be dying\naway in the distance behind.\n\nThe soldier who sat opposite to them must have heard the cry too, for he\njumped up, as if wakened from sleep, and put his head out of the window.\n\n\"Did you hear that cry, citizen?\" he asked.\n\nBut only a curse answered him, and a peremptory command not to lose\nsight of the prisoners by poking his head out of the window.\n\n\"Did you hear the cry?\" asked the soldier of Marguerite as he made haste\nto obey.\n\n\"Yes! What could it be?\" she murmured.\n\n\"It seems dangerous to drive so fast in this darkness,\" muttered the\nsoldier.\n\nAfter which remark he, with the stolidity peculiar to his kind,\nfiguratively shrugged his shoulders, detaching himself, as it were, of\nthe whole affair.\n\n\"We should be out of the forest by now,\" he remarked in an undertone a\nlittle while later; \"the way seemed shorter before.\"\n\nJust then the coach gave an unexpected lurch to one side, and after much\ngroaning and creaking of axles and springs it came to a standstill, and\nthe citizen agent was heard cursing loudly and then scrambling down from\nthe box.\n\nThe next moment the carriage-door was pulled open from without, and the\nharsh voice called out peremptorily:\n\n\"Citizen soldier, here--quick!--quick!--curse you!--we'll have one of\nthe horses down if you don't hurry!\"\n\nThe soldier struggled to his feet; it was never good to be slow in\nobeying the citizen agent's commands. He was half-asleep and no doubt\nnumb with cold and long sitting still; to accelerate his movements he\nwas suddenly gripped by the arm and dragged incontinently out of the\ncoach.\n\nThen the door was slammed to again, either by a rough hand or a sudden\ngust of wind, Marguerite could not tell; she heard a cry of rage and one\nof terror, and Heron's raucous curses. She cowered in the corner of the\ncarriage with Armand's head against her shoulder, and tried to close her\nears to all those hideous sounds.\n\nThen suddenly all the sounds were hushed and all around everything\nbecame perfectly calm and still--so still that at first the silence\noppressed her with a vague, nameless dread. It was as if Nature herself\nhad paused, that she might listen; and the silence became more and more\nabsolute, until Marguerite could hear Armand's soft, regular breathing\nclose to her ear.\n\nThe window nearest to her was open, and as she leaned forward with that\nparalysing sense of oppression a breath of pure air struck full upon her\nnostrils and brought with it a briny taste as if from the sea.\n\nIt was not quite so dark; and there was a sense as of open country\nstretching out to the limits of the horizon. Overhead a vague greyish\nlight suffused the sky, and the wind swept the clouds in great rolling\nbanks right across that light.\n\nMarguerite gazed upward with a more calm feeling that was akin to\ngratitude. That pale light, though so wan and feeble, was thrice welcome\nafter that inky blackness wherein shadows were less dark than the\nlights. She watched eagerly the bank of clouds driven by the dying gale.\n\nThe light grew brighter and faintly golden, now the banks of\nclouds--storm-tossed and fleecy--raced past one another, parted\nand reunited like veils of unseen giant dancers waved by hands that\ncontrolled infinite space--advanced and rushed and slackened speed\nagain--united and finally torn asunder to reveal the waning moon,\nhoney-coloured and mysterious, rising as if from an invisible ocean far\naway.\n\nThe wan pale light spread over the wide stretch of country, throwing\nover it as it spread dull tones of indigo and of blue. Here and there\nsparse, stunted trees with fringed gaunt arms bending to prevailing\nwinds proclaimed the neighbourhood of the sea.\n\nMarguerite gazed on the picture which the waning moon had so suddenly\nrevealed; but she gazed with eyes that knew not what they saw. The moon\nhad risen on her right--there lay the east--and the coach must have been\ntravelling due north, whereas Crecy...\n\nIn the absolute silence that reigned she could perceive from far, very\nfar away, the sound of a church clock striking the midnight hour; and\nnow it seemed to her supersensitive senses that a firm footstep was\ntreading the soft earth, a footstep that drew nearer--and then nearer\nstill.\n\nNature did pause to listen. The wind was hushed, the night-birds in\nthe forest had gone to rest. Marguerite's heart beat so fast that its\nthrobbings choked her, and a dizziness clouded her consciousness.\n\nBut through this state of torpor she heard the opening of the carriage\ndoor, she felt the onrush of that pure, briny air, and she felt a long,\nburning kiss upon her hands.\n\nShe thought then that she was really dead, and that God in His infinite\nlove had opened to her the outer gates of Paradise.\n\n\"My love!\" she murmured.\n\nShe was leaning back in the carriage and her eyes were closed, but she\nfelt that firm fingers removed the irons from her wrists, and that a\npair of warm lips were pressed there in their stead.\n\n\"There, little woman, that's better so--is it not? Now let me get hold\nof poor old Armand!\"\n\nIt was Heaven, of course, else how could earth hold such heavenly joy?\n\n\"Percy!\" exclaimed Armand in an awed voice.\n\n\"Hush, dear!\" murmured Marguerite feebly; \"we are in Heaven you and I--\"\n\nWhereupon a ringing laugh woke the echoes of the silent night.\n\n\"In Heaven, dear heart!\" And the voice had a delicious earthly ring in\nits whole-hearted merriment. \"Please God, you'll both be at Portel with\nme before dawn.\"\n\nThen she was indeed forced to believe. She put out her hands and groped\nfor him, for it was dark inside the carriage; she groped, and felt\nhis massive shoulders leaning across the body of the coach, while his\nfingers busied themselves with the irons on Armand's wrist.\n\n\"Don't touch that brute's filthy coat with your dainty fingers, dear\nheart,\" he said gaily. \"Great Lord! I have worn that wretch's clothes\nfor over two hours; I feel as if the dirt had penetrated to my bones.\"\n\nThen with that gesture so habitual to him he took her head between his\ntwo hands, and drawing her to him until the wan light from without lit\nup the face that he worshipped, he gazed his fill into her eyes.\n\nShe could only see the outline of his head silhouetted against the\nwind-tossed sky; she could not see his eyes, nor his lips, but she felt\nhis nearness, and the happiness of that almost caused her to swoon.\n\n\"Come out into the open, my lady fair,\" he murmured, and though she\ncould not see, she could feel that he smiled; \"let God's pure air blow\nthrough your hair and round your dear head. Then, if you can walk so\nfar, there's a small half-way house close by here. I have knocked up\nthe none too amiable host. You and Armand could have half an hour's rest\nthere before we go further on our way.\"\n\n\"But you, Percy?--are you safe?\"\n\n\"Yes, m'dear, we are all of us safe until morning-time enough to reach\nLe Portel, and to be aboard the Day-Dream before mine amiable friend M.\nChambertin has discovered his worthy colleague lying gagged and bound\ninside the chapel of the Holy Sepulchre. By Gad! how old Heron will\ncurse--the moment he can open his mouth!\"\n\nHe half helped, half lifted her out of the carriage. The strong pure air\nsuddenly rushing right through to her lungs made her feel faint, and she\nalmost fell. But it was good to feel herself falling, when one pair of\narms amongst the millions on the earth were there to receive her.\n\n\"Can you walk, dear heart?\" he asked. \"Lean well on me--it is not far,\nand the rest will do you good.\"\n\n\"But you, Percy--\"\n\nHe laughed, and the most complete joy of living seemed to resound\nthrough that laugh. Her arm was in his, and for one moment he stood\nstill while his eyes swept the far reaches of the country, the mellow\ndistance still wrapped in its mantle of indigo, still untouched by the\nmysterious light of the waning moon.\n\nHe pressed her arm against his heart, but his right hand was stretched\nout towards the black wall of the forest behind him, towards the dark\ncrests of the pines in which the dying wind sent its last mournful\nsighs.\n\n\"Dear heart,\" he said, and his voice quivered with the intensity of his\nexcitement, \"beyond the stretch of that wood, from far away over there,\nthere are cries and moans of anguish that come to my ear even now.\nBut for you, dear, I would cross that wood to-night and re-enter Paris\nto-morrow. But for you, dear--but for you,\" he reiterated earnestly as\nhe pressed her closer to him, for a bitter cry had risen to her lips.\n\nShe went on in silence. Her happiness was great--as great as was her\npain. She had found him again, the man whom she worshipped, the husband\nwhom she thought never to see again on earth. She had found him, and\nnot even now--not after those terrible weeks of misery and suffering\nunspeakable--could she feel that love had triumphed over the\nwild, adventurous spirit, the reckless enthusiasm, the ardour of\nself-sacrifice.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX. THE LAND OF ELDORADO\n\nIt seems that in the pocket of Heron's coat there was a letter-case with\nsome few hundred francs. It was amusing to think that the brute's money\nhelped to bribe the ill-tempered keeper of the half-way house to receive\nguests at midnight, and to ply them well with food, drink, and the\nshelter of a stuffy coffee-room.\n\nMarguerite sat silently beside her husband, her hand in his. Armand,\nopposite to them, had both elbows on the table. He looked pale and wan,\nwith a bandage across his forehead, and his glowing eyes were resting on\nhis chief.\n\n\"Yes! you demmed young idiot,\" said Blakeney merrily, \"you nearly upset\nmy plan in the end, with your yelling and screaming outside the chapel\ngates.\"\n\n\"I wanted to get to you, Percy. I thought those brutes had got you there\ninside that building.\"\n\n\"Not they!\" he exclaimed. \"It was my friend Heron whom they had trussed\nand gagged, and whom my amiable friend M. Chambertin will find in there\nto-morrow morning. By Gad! I would go back if only for the pleasure of\nhearing Heron curse when first the gag is taken from his mouth.\"\n\n\"But how was it all done, Percy? And there was de Batz--\"\n\n\"De Batz was part of the scheme I had planned for mine own escape before\nI knew that those brutes meant to take Marguerite and you as hostages\nfor my good behaviour. What I hoped then was that under cover of a\ntussle or a fight I could somehow or other contrive to slip through\ntheir fingers. It was a chance, and you know my belief in bald-headed\nFortune, with the one solitary hair. Well, I meant to grab that hair;\nand at the worst I could but die in the open and not caged in that awful\nhole like some noxious vermin. I knew that de Batz would rise to the\nbait. I told him in my letter that the Dauphin would be at the Chateau\nd'Ourde this night, but that I feared the revolutionary Government had\ngot wind of this fact, and were sending an armed escort to bring the\nlad away. This letter Ffoulkes took to him; I knew that he would make a\nvigorous effort to get the Dauphin into his hands, and that during\nthe scuffle that one hair on Fortune's head would for one second only,\nmayhap, come within my reach. I had so planned the expedition that we\nwere bound to arrive at the forest of Boulogne by nightfall, and night\nis always a useful ally. But at the guard-house of the Rue Ste. Anne\nI realised for the first time that those brutes had pressed me into a\ntighter corner than I had pre-conceived.\"\n\nHe paused, and once again that look of recklessness swept over his face,\nand his eyes--still hollow and circled--shone with the excitement of\npast memories.\n\n\"I was such a weak, miserable wretch, then,\" he said, in answer\nto Marguerite's appeal. \"I had to try and build up some strength,\nwhen--Heaven forgive me for the sacrilege--I had unwittingly risked your\nprecious life, dear heart, in that blind endeavour to save mine own.\nBy Gad! it was no easy task in that jolting vehicle with that noisome\nwretch beside me for sole company; yet I ate and I drank and I slept for\nthree days and two nights, until the hour when in the darkness I struck\nHeron from behind, half-strangled him first, then gagged him, and\nfinally slipped into his filthy coat and put that loathsome bandage\nacross my head, and his battered hat above it all. The yell he gave when\nfirst I attacked him made every horse rear--you must remember it--the\nnoise effectually drowned our last scuffle in the coach. Chauvelin was\nthe only man who might have suspected what had occurred, but he had gone\non ahead, and bald-headed Fortune had passed by me, and I had managed\nto grab its one hair. After that it was all quite easy. The sergeant and\nthe soldiers had seen very little of Heron and nothing of me; it did not\ntake a great effort to deceive them, and the darkness of the night was\nmy most faithful friend. His raucous voice was not difficult to imitate,\nand darkness always muffles and changes every tone. Anyway, it was not\nlikely that those loutish soldiers would even remotely suspect the trick\nthat was being played on them. The citizen agent's orders were promptly\nand implicitly obeyed. The men never even thought to wonder that after\ninsisting on an escort of twenty he should drive off with two prisoners\nand only two men to guard them. If they did wonder, it was not theirs\nto question. Those two troopers are spending an uncomfortable night\nsomewhere in the forest of Boulogne, each tied to a tree, and some two\nleagues apart one from the other. And now,\" he added gaily, \"en voiture,\nmy fair lady; and you, too, Armand. 'Tis seven leagues to Le Portel, and\nwe must be there before dawn.\"\n\n\"Sir Andrew's intention was to make for Calais first, there to\nopen communication with the Day-Dream and then for Le Portel,\" said\nMarguerite; \"after that he meant to strike back for the Chateau d'Ourde\nin search of me.\"\n\n\"Then we'll still find him at Le Portel--I shall know how to lay hands\non him; but you two must get aboard the Day-Dream at once, for Ffoulkes\nand I can always look after ourselves.\"\n\nIt was one hour after midnight when--refreshed with food and\nrest--Marguerite, Armand and Sir Percy left the half-way house.\nMarguerite was standing in the doorway ready to go. Percy and Armand had\ngone ahead to bring the coach along.\n\n\"Percy,\" whispered Armand, \"Marguerite does not know?\"\n\n\"Of course she does not, you young fool,\" retorted Percy lightly. \"If\nyou try and tell her I think I would smash your head.\"\n\n\"But you--\" said the young man with sudden vehemence; \"can you bear the\nsight of me? My God! when I think--\"\n\n\"Don't think, my good Armand--not of that anyway. Only think of the\nwoman for whose sake you committed a crime--if she is pure and good, woo\nher and win her--not just now, for it were foolish to go back to Paris\nafter her, but anon, when she comes to England and all these past days\nare forgotten--then love her as much as you can, Armand. Learn your\nlesson of love better than I have learnt mine; do not cause Jeanne Lange\nthose tears of anguish which my mad spirit brings to your sister's eyes.\nYou were right, Armand, when you said that I do not know how to love!\"\n\nBut on board the Day-Dream, when all danger was past, Marguerite felt\nthat he did.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of El Dorado, by Baroness Orczy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EL DORADO ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1752.txt or 1752.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/7/5/1752/\n\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
