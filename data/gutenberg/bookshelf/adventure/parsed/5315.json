A dozen dried-out false-acacia-trees shivered as the\nfaintest puff in all the world of stifling wind moved through them; and\na hundred thousand tiny squirrels kept up their aimless scampering in\nsearch of food that was not there.\n\nA coppersmith was about the only living thing that seemed to care\nwhether the sun went down or not. He seemed in a hurry to get a job\ndone, and his reiterated \"Bong-bong-bong!\"--that had never ceased since\nsunrise, and had driven nearly mad the few humans who were there to hear\nit--quickened and grew louder. At last Brown came out of a square mud\nhouse, to see about the sunset.\n\nHe was nobody but plain Bill Brown--or Sergeant William Brown, to give\nhim his full name and entitlements--and the price of him was two rupees\nper day.\n\nHe stared straight at the dull red disk of the sun, and spat with\neloquence. Then he wiped the sweat from his forehead, and scratched a\nplace where the prickly heat was bothering him. Next, he buttoned up\nhis tunic, and brushed it down neatly and precisely. There was official\nbusiness to be done, and a man did that with due formality, heat or no\nheat.\n\n\"Guard, turn out!\" he ordered.\n\nTwelve men filed out, one behind the other, from the hut that he had\nleft. They seemed to feel the heat more than Brown did, as they fell in\nline before Brown's sword. There was no flag, and no flag-pole in that\nnameless health-resort, so the sword, without its scabbard, was doing\nduty, point downward in the ground, as a totem-pole of Empire. Brown had\nstuck it there, like Boanerges' boots, and there it stayed from sunrise\nuntil sunset, to be displaced by whoever dared to do it, at his peril.\n\nThey had no clock. They had nothing, except the uniforms and arms of\nthe Honorable East India Company, as issued in this year of Our\nLord, 1857--a cooking-pot or two, a kettle, a little money and a\nbutcher-knife. Their supper bleated miserably some twenty yards away,\ntied to a tree, and a lean. Punjabi squatted near it in readiness to buy\nthe skin. It was a big goat, but it was mangy, so he held only two annas\nin his hand. The other anna (in case that Brown should prove adamant)\nwas twisted in the folds of his pugree, but he was prepared to perjure\nhimself a dozen times, and take the names of all his female ancestors in\nvain, before he produced it.\n\nThe sun flattened a little more at the bottom, and began to move\nquickly, as it does in India--anxious apparently to get away from the\nday's ill deeds.\n\n\"Shoulder umms!\" commanded Brown. \"General salute! Present-umms!\"\n\nThe red sun slid below the sky-line, and the night was on them, as\nthough somebody had shut the lid. Brown stepped to the sword, jerked it\nout of the ground and returned it to his scabbard in three motions.\n\n\"Shoulder-umms! Order-umms! Dismiss!\" The men filed back into the hut\nagain, disconsolately, without swearing and without mirth. They had\nput the sun to bed with proper military decency. They would have seen\nhumor--perhaps--or an excuse for blasphemy in the omission of such a\ndetail, but it was much too hot to swear at the execution of it.\n\nBesides, Brown was a strange individual who detested swearing, and it\nwas a very useful thing, and wise, to humor him. He had a way of his\nown, and usually got it.\n\nBrown posted a sentry at the hut-door, and another at the crossroads\nwhich he was to guard, then went round behind the but to bargain with\nthe goatskin-merchant. But he stopped before he reached the tree.\n\n\"Boy!\" he called, and a low-caste native servant came toward him at a\nrun.\n\n\"Is that fakir there still?\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib!\"\n\n\"Ha? Can't you learn to say 'yes,' like a human being?\"\n\n\"Yes, sahib!\"\n\n\"All right. I'm going to have a talk with him. Kill the goat, and tell\nthe Punjabi to wait, if he wants to buy the skin.\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib!\"\n\nBrown spun round on his heel, and the servant wilted.\n\n\"Yes, sahib!\" he corrected.\n\nBrown left him then, with a nod that conveyed remission of cardinal sin,\nand a warning not to repeat the offence. As the native ran off to get\nthe butcher-knife and sharpen it, it was noticeable that he wore a\nchastened look.\n\n\"Send Sidiki after me!\" Brown shouted after him, and a minute later a\nnearly naked Beluchi struck a match and emerged from the darkness, with\nthe light of a lantern gleaming on his skin. He followed like a snake,\nand only Brown's sharp, authority-conveying footfalls could be heard as\nhe trudged sturdily--straight-backed, eyes straight in front of him--to\nwhere an age-old baobab loomed like a phantom in the night. He marched\nlike a man in armor. Not even the terrific heat of a Central-Indian\nnight could take the stiffening out of him.\n\nThe Beluchi ran ahead, just before they reached the tree. He stopped and\nheld the lantern up to let its light fall on some object that was close\nagainst the tree-trunk. At a good ten-pace distance from the object\nBrown stopped and stared. The lamplight fell on two little dots that\ngleamed. Brown stepped two paces nearer. Two deadly, malicious human\neyes blinked once, and then stared back at him.\n\n\"Does he never sleep?\" asked Brown.\n\nThe Beluchi said something or other in a language that was full of harsh\nhard gutturals, and the owner of the eyes chuckled. His voice seemed\nto be coming from the tree itself, and there was nothing of him visible\nexcept the cruel keen eyes that had not blinked once since Brown drew\nnearer.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Sahib, he does not answer.\"\n\n\"Tell him I'm tired of his not answering. Tell him that if he can't\nlearn to give a civil answer to a civilly put question I'll exercise my\nauthority on him!\"\n\nThe Beluchi translated, or pretended to. Brown was not sure which, for\nhe was rewarded with nothing but another chuckle, which sounded like\nwater gurgling down a drain.\n\n\"Does he still say nothing?\"\n\n\"Absolutely nothing, sahib.\"\n\nBrown stepped up closer yet, and peered into the blackness, looking\nstraight into the eyes that glared at him, and from them down at the\nbody of the owner of them. The Beluchi shrank away.\n\n\"Have a care, sahib! It is dangerous! This very holy--most holy--most\nreligious man!\"\n\n\"Bring that lantern back.\"\n\n\"He will curse you, sahib!\"\n\n\"Do you hear me?\"\n\nThe Beluchi came nearer again, trembling with fright. Brown snatched the\nlamp away from him, and pushed it forward toward the fakir, moving it\nup and down to get a view of the whole of him. There was nothing that\nhe saw that would reassure or comfort or please a devil even. It was\nultradevilish; both by design and accident--conceived and calculated\nghastliness, peculiar to India. Brown shuddered as he looked, and it\ntook more than the merely horrible to make him betray emotion.\n\n\"What god do you say he worships?\"\n\n\"Sahib, I know not. I am a Mussulman. These Hindus worship many gods.\"\n\nThe fakir chuckled again, and Brown held the lantern yet nearer to him\nto get a better view. The fakir's skin was not oily, and for all the\nblanket-heat it did not glisten, so his form was barely outlined against\nthe blackness that was all but tangible behind him.\n\nBrown spat again, as he drew away a step. He could contrive to express\nmore disgust and more grim determination in that one rudimentary act\nthan even a Stamboul Softa can.\n\n\"So he's holy, is he?\"\n\n\"Very, very holy, sahib!\"\n\nAgain the fakir chuckled, and again Brown held his breath and pushed the\nlantern closer to him.\n\n\"I believe the brute understands the Queen's English!\"\n\n\"He understanding all things, sahib! He knowing all things what will\nhappen! Mind, sahib! He may curse you!\"\n\nBut Brown appeared indifferent to the danger that he ran. To the fakir's\nunconcealed discomfort, he proceeded to examine him minutely, going over\nhim with the aid of the lantern inch by inch, from the toe-nails upward.\n\n\"Well,\" he commented aloud, \"if the army's got an opposite, here's it!\nI'd give a month's pay for the privilege of washing this brute, just as\na beginning!\"\n\nThe man's toe-nails--for he really was a man!--were at least two inches\nlong. They were twisted spirally, and some of them were curled back on\nthemselves into disgusting-looking knots. What walking he had ever done\nhad been on his heels. His feet were bent upward, and fixed upward, by a\ndeliberately cultivated cramp.\n\nHis legs, twisted one above the other in a squatting attitude, were lean\nand hairy, and covered with open sores which were kept open by the swarm\nof insects that infested him. His loin-cloth was rotting from him. His\nemaciated body--powdered and smeared with ashes and dust and worse--was\nperched bolt-up-right on a flat earth dais that had once on a time been\nthe throne of a crossroads idol. One arm, his right one, hung by\nhis side in an almost normal attitude, and his right fingers moved\nincessantly like a man's who is kneading clay. But his other arm was\nrigid--straight up in the air above his head; set, fixed, cramped,\nparalyzed in that position, with the fist clenched. And through the back\nof the closed fist the fakir's nails were growing.\n\nBut, worse than the horror of the arm was the creature's face, with\nthe evidence of torture on it, and fiendish delight in torture for the\ntorture's sake. His eyes were his only organs that really lived still,\nand they expressed the steely hate and cruelty, the mad fanaticism,\nthe greedy self-love--self-immolating for the sake of self--that is the\nthoroughgoing fakir's stock in trade. And his lips were like the\ngraven lips of a Hindu temple god, self-satisfied, self-worshiping,\ncontemptuous and cruel. He chuckled again, as Brown finished his\ninspection.\n\n\"So that crittur's holy, is he? Well, tell him that I'm set here to\nwatch these crossroads. Tell him I'm supposed to question every one who\ncomes, and find out what his business is, and arrest him if he can't\ngive a proper account of himself. Say he's been here three days now, and\nthat that's long enough for any one to find his tongue in. Tell him if I\ndon't get an answer from him here and now I'll put him in the clink!\"\n\n\"But, sahib--\"\n\n\"You tell him what I say, d'you hear?\"\n\nThe Beluchi made haste to translate, trembling as he spoke, and wilting\nvisibly when the baleful eyes of the fakir rested on him for a second.\nThe fakir answered something in a guttural undertone.\n\n\"What does he say?\"\n\n\"That he will curse you, sahib!\"\n\n\"Sentry!\" shouted Brown.\n\n\"Sir!\" came the ready answer, and the sling-swivels of a rifle clicked\nas the man on guard at the crossroads shouldered it. There are some men\nwho are called \"sir\" without any title to it, just as there are some\nsergeants who receive a colonel's share of deference when out on a\nnon-commissioned officer's command. Bill Brown was one of them.\n\n\"Come here, will you!\"\n\nThere came the sound of heavy footfalls, and a thud as a rifle-butt\ndescended to the earth again. Brown moved the lamp, and its beams fell\non a rifleman who stood close beside him at attention--like a jinnee\nformed suddenly from empty blackness.\n\n\"Arrest this fakir. Cram him in the clink.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir!\"\n\nThe sentry took one step forward, with his fixed bayonet at the\n\"charge,\" and the fakir sat still and eyed him.\n\n\"Oh, have a care, sahib!\" wailed the Beluchi. \"This is very holy man!\"\n\n\"Silence!\" ordered Brown. \"Here. Hold the lamp.\"\n\nThe bayonet-point pressed against the fakir's ribs, and he drew back an\ninch or two to get away from it. He was evidently able to feel pain when\nit was inflicted by any other than himself.\n\n\"Come on,\" growled the sentry. \"Forward. Quick march. If you don't want\ntwo inches in you!\"\n\n\"Don't use the point!\" commanded Brown. \"You might do him an injury.\nTreat him to a sample of the butt!\"\n\nThe sentry swung his rifle round with an under-handed motion that all\nriflemen used to practise in the short-range-rifle days. The fakir\nwinced, and gabbled something in a hurry to the man who held the lamp.\n\n\"He says that he will speak, sahib!\"\n\n\"Halt, then,\" commanded Brown. \"Order arms. Tell him to hurry up!\"\n\nThe Beluchi translated, and the fakir answered him, in a voice that\nsounded hard and distant and emotionless.\n\n\"He says that he, too, is here to watch the crossroads, sahib! He says\nthat he will curse you if you touch him!\"\n\n\"Tell him to curse away!\"\n\n\"He says not unless you touch him, sahib.\"\n\n\"Prog him off his perch!\" commanded Brown.\n\nThe rifle leaped up at the word, and its butt landed neatly on the\nfakir's ribs, sending him reeling backward off his balance, but not\nupsetting him completely. He recovered his poise with quite astonishing\nactivity, and shuffled himself back again to the center of the dais. His\neyes blazed with hate and indignation, and his breath came now in sharp\ngasps that sounded like escaping steam. He needed no further invitation\nto commence his cursing. It burst out with a rush, and paused for better\neffect, and burst out again in a torrent. The Beluchi hid his face\nbetween his hands.\n\n\"Now translate that!\" commanded Brown, when the fakir stopped for lack\nof breath.\n\n\"Sahib, I dare not! Sahib--\"\n\nBrown took a threatening step toward him, and the Beluchi changed his\nmind. Brown's disciplining methods were a too recently encountered fact\nto be outdone by a fakir's promise of any kind of not-yet-met damnation.\n\n\"Sahib, he says that because your man has touched him, both you and\nyour man shall lie within a week helpless upon an anthill, still living,\nwhile the ants run in and out among your wounds. He says that the ants\nshall eat your eyes, sahib, and that you shall cry for water, and there\nshall be no water within reach--only the sound of water just beyond you.\nHe says that first you shall be beaten, both of you, until your backs\nand the soles of your feet run blood, in order that the ants may have an\nentrance!\"\n\n\"Is he going to do all this?\"\n\nThe Beluchi passed the question on, and the fakir tossed him an answer\nto it.\n\n\"He says, sahib, that the gods will see to it.\"\n\n\"So the gods obey his orders, do they. Well, they've a queer sense of\nduty! What else does he prophesy?\"\n\n\"About your soul, sahib, and the sentry's soul.\"\n\n\"That's interesting! Translate!\"\n\n\"He says, sahib, that for countless centuries you and your man shall\ninhabit the carcasses of snakes, to eat dirt and be trodden on and\ncrushed, until you learn to have respect for very holy persons!\"\n\n\"Is he going to have the ordering of that?\"\n\n\"He says that the gods have already ordered it.\"\n\n\"It won't make much difference, then, what I do now. If that's in store\nfor me in any case, I may as well get my money's worth before the fun\nbegins! Tell him that unless he can give me a satisfactory reason for\nbeing here I shall treat him to a little more rifle-butt, and something\nelse afterward that he will like even less!\"\n\n\"He says,\" explained the Beluchi, after a moment's conversation with the\nfakir, \"that he is here to see what the gods have prophesied. He says\nthat India will presently be whelmed in blood!\"\n\n\"Whose blood?\"\n\n\"Yours and that of others. He says, did you not see the sunset?\"\n\n\"What of the sunset?\"\n\nBrown looked about him and, save where the lantern cast a fitful light\non the fakir and the sentry and the native servant, and threw into faint\nrelief the shadowy, snake-like tendrils of the baobab, his eyes\nfailed to pierce the gloom. The sunset was a memory. In that heavy,\ndeath-darkness silence it seemed almost as though there had never been a\nsun.\n\n\"'A blot of blood,' he says. He says the order has been given. He says\nthat half of India shall run blood within a day, and the whole of it\nwithin a week!\"\n\n\"Who gave the order?\"\n\n\"He answers 'Hookum hai!'--which means 'It is an order!' Nothing more\ndoes the holy fakir say.\"\n\n\"To the clink with him!\" commanded Brown. \"I'm tired of these Old Mother\nShipton babblings. That's the third useless Hindu fanatic within a week\nwho has talked about India being drenched in blood. Let him go in to the\ndepot under guard, and do his prophesying there! Bring him along.\"\n\nThe sentry's rifle-butt rose again and threatened business. The Beluchi\ngave a warning cry, and the fakir tumbled off his dais. Then, with the\ntrembling Beluchi walking on ahead with the lantern, and Brown and the\nsentry urging from behind, the fakir jumped and squirmed and wabbled\non his all but useless feet toward the guardroom. When they reached the\ntree where the goat had bleated, the Punjabi skin-buyer rose up, took\none long look at the fakir and ran.\n\n\"Well, I'll be!\" exclaimed the sentry.\n\n\"You'll be worse than that,\" said Brown, \"if you use that language\nanywhere where I'm about! I'll not have it, d'you hear? Get on ahead,\nand open the door of the clink!\"\n\nThe sentry obeyed him, and a moment later the fakir was thrust into a\nfour-square mud-walled room, and the door was locked on him.\n\n\"Back to your post,\" commanded Brown. \"And next time I hear you\nswearing, I'll treat you to a double-trick, my man! About turn. Quick\nmarch.\"\n\nThe sentry trudged off without daring to answer him, and Brown took a\ngood look at the fakir through the iron bars that protected the top\nhalf of the door. Then he went off to see about his supper, of newly\nslaughtered goat-chops and chupatties baked in ghee. His soul revolted\nat the thought of it, but it was his duty to eat it and set an example\nto the men; and duty was the only thing that mattered in Bill Brown's\nscheme of things.\n\n\"Maybe it's true,\" he muttered, \"and maybe it's all lies; there's no\nknowing. Maybe India's going to run blood, as these fakirs seem to\nthink, and maybe it isn't. There'll be more blood shed than mine in that\ncase! 'Hookum hai'--'It is orders,' heh? Well--there's more than one\nsort of 'Hookum hai!' I've got my orders too!\"\n\nHe doubled the guard, when supper bad been eaten and the guardroom had\nbeen swept and the pots and kettle had been burnished until they shone.\nThen he tossed a chupatty to the imprisoned fakir, spat again from sheer\ndisgust, lit his pipe and went and sat where he could hear the footbeats\nof the sentries.\n\n\"They can't help their religion,\" he muttered. \"The poor infidels don't\nknow no better. And they've got a right to think what they please 'about\nme or the Company. But I've no patience with uncleanliness! That's wrong\nany way you look at it. That critter can't see straight for the dirt on\nhim, nor think straight for that matter. He's a disgrace to humanity.\nPriest or fakir or whatever he is, if I live to see tomorrow's sun I'll\nhand him over to the guard and have him washed!\"\n\nHaving formed that resolution, Brown dismissed all thoughts of the\nfakir. His memory went back to home--the clean white cottage on the\nSussex Downs, and the clean white girl who once on a time had waited for\nhim there. For the next few hours, until the guard was changed, the only\nsigns or sounds of life were the glowing of Brown's pipe, the steady\nfootfalls of the sentries and occasional creakings from the hell-hot\nguard-room, where sleepless soldiers tossed in prickly discomfort.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nBill Brown, with his twelve, had not been set to watch a lonely\ncrossroad for the fun of it. One road was a well-made highway, and led\nfrom a walled city, where three thousand men sweated and thought\nof England, to another city, where five thousand armed natives drew\nEngland's pay, and wore English uniforms.\n\nThe other road was a snake-like trail, nearly as wide but not nearly\nso well kept. It twisted here and there amid countless swarming native\nvillages, and was used almost exclusively by natives, whose rightful\nbusiness was neither war nor peace nor the contriving of either of them.\nIt had been a trade-road when history was being born, and the laden\nox-carts creaked along it still, as they had always done and always will\ndo until India awakes.\n\nBut there are few men in the world who attend to nothing but their\nrightful business, and there are even more in India than elsewhere\nwho are prone to neglect their own affairs and stir up sedition among\nothers. There are few fighting-men among that host. They are priests\nfor the most part or fakirs or make-believe pedlers or confessed and\nshameless mendicants; and they have no liking for the trunk roads,\nwhere the tangible evidence of Might and Majesty may be seen marching in\neight-hundred-man battalions. They prefer to dream along the byways, and\nset other people dreaming. They lead, when the crash comes, from behind.\n\nThough the men who made the policies of the Honorable East India Company\nwere mostly blind to the moving finger on the wall, and chose to imagine\nthemselves secure against a rising of the millions they controlled; and\nthough most of their military officers were blinder yet, and failed to\nread the temper of the native troops in their immediate command, still,\nthere were other men who found themselves groping, at least two years\nbefore the Mutiny of '57. They were groping for something intangible and\nnoiseless and threatening which they felt was there in a darkness, but\nwhich one could not see.\n\nBaines was one of them--Lieutenant-General Baines, commanding at\nBholat. His troops were in the center of a spider's web of roads that\ncriss-crossed and drained a province. There were big trunk arteries,\nwhich took the flow of life from city to walled city, and a mass of\nwinding veins in the shape of grass-grown country tracks. He could feel,\nif any man could, the first faint signs of fever rising, and he was\nplaced where he could move swiftly, and cut deep in the right spot,\nshould the knife be needed.\n\nHe was like a surgeon, though, who holds a lancet and can use it, but\nwho lacks permission. The poison in India's system lay deep, and the\nfever was slow in showing itself. And meanwhile the men who had the\nordering of things could see neither necessity nor excuse for so much as\na parade of strength. They refused, point-blank and absolutely, to admit\nthat there was, or, could be, any symptom of unrest.\n\nHe dared not make new posts for officers, for officers would grumble at\nenforced exile in the country districts, and the Government would get to\nhear of it, and countermand. But there were non-commissioned officers\nin plenty, and it was not difficult to choose the best of them--three\nmen--and send them, with minute detachments, to three different points\nof vantage. Non-commissioned officers don't grumble, or if they do no\none gets to hear of it, or minds. And they are just as good as officers\nat watching crossroads and reporting what they see and hear.\n\nSo where a little cluster of mud huts ached in the heat of a right\nangle where the trunk road crossed a native road some seventy miles from\nBholat, Bill Brown--swordsman and sergeant and strictest of martinets,\nas well as sentimentalist--had been set to watch and listen and report.\n\nThere were many cleverer men in the non-commissioned ranks of Baine's\ncommand, many who knew more of the native languages, and who had\nmore imagination. But there was none who knew better how to win the\nunqualified respect and the obedience of British and native alike,\nor who could be better counted on to obey an order, when it came,\nliterally, promptly and in the teeth of anything.\n\nBrown's theories on religion were a thing to marvel at, and walk\nsingularly wide of, for he was a preacher with a pair of fists when\nthoroughly aroused. And his devotion to a girl in England whom no one\nin his regiment had ever seen, and of whom he did not even possess a\nlikeness, was next door to being pitiable. His voice was like a raven's,\nwith something rather less than a raven's sense of melody; he was very\nprone to sing, and his songs were mournful ones. He was not a social\nacquisition in any generally accepted sense, although his language was\ncompletely free from blasphemy or coarseness. His ideas were too cut\nand dried to make conversation even interesting. But his loyalty and his\nsense of duty were as adamant.\n\nHe had changed the double guard at the crossroads; and had posted two\nfresh men by the mud-walled guardroom door. He had lit his pipe for the\ndozenth time, and had let it go out again while he hummed a verse of a\nCovenanters' hymn. And he had just started up to wall over to the cell\nand make a cursory inspection of his prisoner, when his ears caught a\ndistant sound that was different from any of the night sounds, though\nscarcely louder.\n\nPrompt as a rifle in answer to the trigger, he threw himself down on\nall fours, and laid his ear to the ground. A second later, he was on his\nfeet again.\n\n\"Guard!\" he yelled. \"Turn out!\"\n\nCots squeaked and jumped, and there came a rush of hurrying feet. The\neight men not on watch ran out in single file, still buttoning their\nuniforms, and lined up beside the two who watched the guardroom door.\n\n\"Stand easy!\" commanded Brown. Then he marched off to the crossroads,\nfinding his way in the blackness more by instinct and sense of direction\nthan from any landmark, for even the road beneath his feet was barely\nvisible.\n\n\"D'you mean to tell me that neither of you men can hear that sound?\" he\nasked the sentries.\n\nBoth men listened intently, and presently one of them made out a very\nfaint and distant noise, that did not seem to blend in with the other\nnight-sounds.\n\n\"Might be a native drum?\" he hazarded.\n\n\"No, 'tain't!\" said the other. \"I got it now. It's a horse galloping.\nTired horse, by the sound of him, and coming this way. All right,\nSergeant.\"\n\n\"One of you go two hundred yards along the road, and form an\nadvance-post, so to speak. Challenge him the minute he's within\near-shot, and shoot him if he won't halt. If he halts, pass him along to\nNumber Two. Number Two, pass him along to the guardroom, where\nI'll deal with him! Which of you's Number One? Number One,\nthen--forward--quick--march!\"\n\nThe sentry trudged off in one direction, and Bill Brown in another. The\nsentry concealed itself behind a rock that flanked the road, and\nBrown spent the next few minutes in making the guard \"port arms,\" and\ncarefully inspecting their weapons with the aid of a lantern. He had\nalready inspected there once since supper, but he knew the effect that\nanother inspection would be likely to produce. Nothing goes further\ntoward making men careful and ready at the word than incessant and\nunexpected but quite quietly performed inspection of minutest details.\n\nHe produced the effect of setting the men on the qui vive without\nalarming them.\n\nSuddenly, the farthest advanced sentry's challenge rang out.\n\n\"Frie-e-e-e-nd!\" came the answer, in nasal, high-pitched wail, but the\ngalloping continued.\n\n\"Halt, I tell you!\" A breech-bolt clicked, and then another one. They\nwere little sounds, but they were different, and the guard could hear\nthem plainly. The galloping horse came on.\n\n\"Cra-a-a-a-ack!\" went the sentry's rifle, and the flash of it spurted\nfor an instant across the road, like a sheet of lightning. And, just\nas lightning might, it showed an instantaneous vision of a tired\ngray horse, foam-flecked and furiously ridden, pounding down the road\nhead-on. The vision was blotted by the night again before any one could\nsee who rode the horse, or what his weapons were--if any--or form a\ntheory as to why he rode.\n\nBut the winging bullet did what the sentry's voice had failed to do.\nThere came a clatter of spasmodic hoof-beats, an erratic shower of\nsparks, a curse in clean-lipped decent Urdu; a grunt, a struggle, more\nsparks again, and then a thud, followed by a devoutly worded prayer\nthat Allah, the all-wise provider of just penalties, might blast the\nuniverse.\n\n\"Stop talkin'!\" said the sentry, and a black-bearded Rajput rolled free,\nand looked up to find a bayonet-point within three inches of his eye.\n\n\"Poggul!\" snarled the Mohammedan.\n\n\"Poggul's no password!\" said the sentry. \"Neither to my good-nature nor\nto nothing else. Put up your 'ands, and get on your feet, and march!\nLook alive, now! Call me a fool, would yer? Wait till the sergeant's\nthrough with yer, and see!\"\n\nThe Rajput chose to consider a retort beneath his dignity. He rose, and\ntook one quick look at the horse, which was still breathing.\n\n\"Your bayonet just there,\" he said, \"and press. So he will die quickly.\"\n\nThe sentry placed his bayonet-point exactly where directed, and leaned\nhis weight above it. The horse gave a little shudder, and lay still.\n\n\"Poggul!\" said the Rajput once again. And this time the sentry looked\nand saw cold steel within three inches of his eye!\n\n\"Your rifle!\" said the Rajput. \"Hand it here!\"\n\nAnd, to save his eyesight, the sentry complied, while the Rajput's\nivory-white teeth grinned at him pleasantly.\n\n\"Now, hands to your sides! Attention! March!\" the Rajput ordered, and\nwith his own bayonet at his back the sentry had to march, whether\nhe wanted to or not, by the route that the other chose, toward the\nguardroom. The Rajput seemed to know by instinct where the second sentry\nstood although the man's shape was quite invisible against the night. He\ncalled out, \"Friend!\" again as he passed him, and the sentry hearing the\nfirst sentry's footsteps, imagined that the real situation was reversed.\n\nSo, out of a pall of blackness, to the accompanying sound of rifles\nbeing brought up to the shoulder, a British sentry--feeling and looking\nprecisely like a fool--marched up to his own guardroom, with a man who\nshould have been his prisoner in charge of him.\n\n\"Halt!\" commanded Brown. \"Who or what have you got there, Stanley?\"\n\n\"Stanley is my prisoner at present!\" said a voice that Brown vaguely\nrecognized.\n\nHe stepped up closer, to make sure.\n\n\"What, you? Juggut Khan!\"\n\n\"Aye, Brown sahib! Juggut Khan--with tidings, and a dead gray horse on\nwhich to bear them! If this fool could only use his bayonet as he can\nshoot, I think I would be dead too. His brains, though, are all behind\nhis right eye. Tie him up, where no little child can come and make him\nprisoner!\"\n\n\"Arrest that man!\" commanded Brown, and two men detached themselves from\nthe end of the guard, and stood him between them, behind the line.\n\n\"Here's his rifle!\" smiled Juggut Khan, and Brown received it with an\nill grace.\n\n\"How did you get past the other sentry?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, easily! You English are only brave; you have no brains. Sometimes\none part of the rule is broken, but the other never. You are not always\nbrave!\"\n\n\"I suppose you're angry because he killed your horse?\"\n\n\"I am angry, Brown sahib, for greater happenings than that! The man\nconceivably was right, since I did not halt for him, and I suppose he\nhad his orders. I am angry because the standard of rebellion is raised,\nand because of what it means to me!\"\n\n\"Are you drunk, Juggut Khan?\"\n\n\"Your honor is pleased to be humorous? No, I am not drunk. Nor have I\neaten opium. I have eaten of the bread of bitterness this day, and drunk\nof the cup of gall. I have seen British officers--good, brave fools,\nsome of whom I knew and loved--killed by the men they were supposed\nto lead. I have seen a barracks burning, and a city given over to be\nlooted. I have seen white women--nay, sahib, steady!--I have seen them\nrun before a howling mob, and I have seen certain of them shot by their\nown husbands!\"\n\n\"Quietly!\" ordered Brown. \"Don't let the men hear!\"\n\n\"One of them I slew myself, because her husband, who was wounded, sent\nme to her and bade me kill her. She died bravely. And certain others\nI have hidden where the mutineers are not likely to discover them at\npresent. I ride now for succor--or, I rode, rather, until your expert\nmarksman interfered with me! I now need another horse.\"\n\n\"You mean that the native troops have mutinied?\" \"I mean rather more\nthan that, sahib. Mohammedans and Hindus are as one, and the crowd is\nwith them. This is probably the end of the powder-train, for, from what\nI heard shouted by the mutineers, almost the whole of India is in revolt\nalready!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"God knows, sahib! The reason given is that the cartridges supplied are\ngreased with the blended fat of pigs and cows, thus defiling both Hindu\nand Mohammedan alike. But, if you ask me, the cause lies deeper. In the\nmeantime, the rebels have looted Jailpore and burned their barracks, and\nwithin an hour or two they will start along this road for Bholat, which\nthey have a mind to loot likewise. My advice to you is retire at once.\nGet me another horse from somewhere, that I may carry warning. Then\nfollow me as fast as you and your men can move.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Brown. \"They'll find General Baines to deal with them at\nBholat.\"\n\n\"Who knows yet how many in Bholat have not risen? Are you positive that\nthe garrison there has not already been surrounded by rebels? I am not!\nI would not be at all surprised to learn that General Baines is so busy\ndefending himself that he can not move in any direction. And--does your\nhonor mean to hold this guardroom here against five thousand?\"\n\n\"I mean to obey my orders!\" answered Brown.\n\n\"And your orders are?\"\n\n\"My orders!\"\n\n\"Would they preclude the provision of another horse for me?\"\n\n\"There's a village about a mile away, down over yonder, where I think\nyou'll find a decent horse--along that road there.\"\n\n\"And your honor's orders would possibly permit a certain payment for the\nhorse?\"\n\n\"Positively not!\" said Brown.\n\n\"Then--'\n\n\"To seize a horse, for military use, under the spur of necessity, and\nafter giving a receipt for it, would be in order.\"\n\n\"So I am to spend the night wandering around the countryside, in a vain\nendeavor to--\"\n\nBut Brown was doing mathematics in his head. Two men to guard prisoners,\ntwo on guard at the crossroads, two at the guardroom door--six from\ntwelve left six, and six were not enough to rape a countryside.\n\n\"Guard!\" he ordered. \"Release that prisoner. Now, you Stanley, let this\nbe a lesson to you, and remember that I only set you free because I'd\nhave been short-handed otherwise. Number One! Stand guard between the\nclink and the guardroom door. Keep an eye on both. The remainder--form\ntwo-deep. Right turn! By the left, quick-march! Left wheel!... Now,\"\nhe said, turning to Juggut Khan, \"if you'll come along I'll soon get a\nhorse for you!\"\n\nThe Rajput strode along beside him, and gave him some additional\ninformation as they went, Brown taking very good care all the time to\nkeep out of earshot of the men and to speak to Juggut Khan in low tones.\nHe learned, among other things, that Juggut Khan had lost every anna\nthat he owned, and had only escaped with his life by dint of luck and\nswordship and most terrific riding.\n\n\"Are all of you Rajputs loyal?\" asked Brown.\n\n\"I know not. I know that I myself shall stay loyal until the end!\"\n\n\"Well--the end is not in doubt. There can only be one end!\" commented\nBrown.\n\n\"Of a truth, sahib, I believe that you are right. There can only be one\nend. This night is not more black, this horizon is no shorter, than the\noutlook!\"\n\n\"Then, you mean--\"\n\n\"I mean, sahib, that this uprising is more serious than you--or any\nother Englishman--is likely to believe. I believe that the side I fight\nfor will be the losing side.\"\n\n\"And yet, you stay loyal?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"All the same, Juggut Khan--I'm not emotional, or a man of many words. I\ndon't trust Indians as a rule! I--but--here--will you shake hands?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sahib!\" said the Rajput. \"We be two men, you and I! Why\nshould the one be loyal and the other not?\"\n\n\"When this is over,\" said Brown, \"if it ends the way we want, and we're\nboth alive, I'd like to call myself your friend!\"\n\n\"I have always been your friend, sahib, and you mine, since the day when\nyou bandaged up a boy and gave him your own drinking-water and carried\nhim in to Bholat on your shoulder, twenty miles or more.\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that--any other man would have done the same thing. That was\nnothing!\"\n\n\"Strange that when a white man does an honorable deed he lies about it!\"\nsaid Juggut Khan. \"That was not nothing, sahib, and you know it was not\nnothing! You know that from the heat and the exertion you were ill for\nmore than a month afterward. And you know that there were others there,\nof my own people, who might have done what you did, and did not!\"\n\n\"But, hang it all! Why drag up a little thing like this?\"\n\n\"Because, sahib, I might have no other opportunity, and--\"\n\n\"Well? And what?\"\n\n\"And the Rajput boy whom you carried was my son!\"\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nThe finding of a remount for Juggut Khan was not so troublesome as might\nhave been supposed. The rumors and plans and whispered orders for the\ncoming struggle had been passed around the countryside for months past,\nand every man who owned a horse had it stalled safely near him, for use\nwhen the hour should come.\n\nThere were country-ponies and Arabs and Kathiawaris and Khaubulis among\nwhich to pick, and though the average run of them was worse than merely\nbad, and though both best and worst were hidden away whenever possible,\ngood horses were discoverable. Within an hour, Bill Brown; with the aid\nof his men, had routed out a Khaubuji stallion for Juggut Khan, one fit\nto carry him against time the whole of the way to Bholat.\n\nThe Rajput mounted him where Brown unearthed him, and watched the\nsigning of a scribbled-out receipt with a cynical smile.\n\n\"If he comes to claim his money for the horse,\" said Juggut Khan,\n\"I--even I, who am penniless--will pay him. Good-by, Brown sahib!\" He\nleaned over and grasped the sergeant by the hand. \"Take my advice, now.\nI know what is happening and what has happened. Fall back on Bholat\nat once. Hurry! Seize horses or even asses for your men, and ride in\nhotfoot. Salaam!\"\n\nHe drove his right spur in, wheeled the horse and started across country\nin the direction of Bholat at a hand-gallop, guiding himself solely\nby the soldier's sixth sense of direction, and leaving the problem of\npossible pitfalls to the horse.\n\n\"If what he says is true,\" said Brown, as the clattering hoof-beats died\naway, \"and I'm game to take my oath he wouldn't lie to me, I'd give more\nthan a little to have him with me for the next few hours!\"\n\nThe men came clustering round him now, anxious for an explanation.\nThey had held their tongues while Juggut Khan was there, because they\nhappened to know Brown too well to do otherwise. He would have snubbed\nany man who dared to question him before the Indian. But, now that the\nIndian was gone, curiosity could stay no longer within bounds.\n\n\"What is it, Sergeant? Anything been happening? What's the news? What's\nthat I heard him say about rebellion? They're a rum lot, them Rajputs.\nD'you think he's square? Tell us, Sergeant!\"\n\n\"Listen, then. Rebellion has broken out. The native barracks at Jailpore\nhave been burned, and all the English officers are killed--or so says\nJuggut Khan. He's riding on, to carry the news to General Baines. He\nsays that the mutineers are planning to come along this way some time\nwithin the next few hours!\"\n\n\"What are we going to do, then?\"\n\n\"That's my business! I'm in command here!\"\n\n\"Yes, but, Sergeant--aren't you going back to Bholat? Aren't you going\nto follow him? Are you going to stay here and get cut up? We'll get\ncaught here like rats in a trap!\"\n\n\"Are you giving orders here?\" asked Brown acidly. \"Fall in! Come on,\nnow! Hurry! 'Tshun--eyes right--ri'--dress. Eyes--front. Ri'--turn. By\nthe left--quick--march! Silence, now! Left! Left! Left!\"\n\nHe marched them back toward the crossroads without giving them any\nfurther opportunity to remonstrate or ask for information.\n\nIt was not until he reached the crossroads, without being challenged,\nthat he showed any sign of being in any way disturbed.\n\n\"Sentry!\" he shouted. \"Sentry!\"\n\nBut there was no answer.\n\n\"Halt!\" he ordered, and he himself went forward to investigate. The\nblackness swallowed him, but the men could hear him move, and they heard\nhim fall. They heard him muttering, too, within ten paces of them. Then\nthey heard his order.\n\n\"Bring a light here, some one.\"\n\nOne man produced a piece of candle, struck a match and lit it. A moment\nlater they had all broken order, and were standing huddled up together\nlike a frightened flock of sheep, peering through dancing, candle-lit\nshadows at something horrible that Brown was handling.\n\n\"What is it, Sergeant?\"\n\n\"What in hell's happened?\"\n\n\"Who was that swearing?\" inquired Brown, with a sudden look up across\nhis shoulder. \"You, Taylor? You again? Swearing in the presence of\ndeath? Talking of hell, with your two comrades lying dead at the\ncrossroads, and you like to follow both o' them at any minute?\"\n\nBoth of the guards lay dead. They lay quite neatly, side by side,\nwithout a sign about them to show that they had met with violence. Brown\nrolled one body over, though, and then the cause of death became more\nobvious. A stream of blood welled out of the man's back, from between\nthe shoulder-blades--warm blood, that had not even started to coagulate.\n\n\"They've been dead about three minutes!\" commented Brown, rising, and\nwiping his hands in the road-dust to get the blood off them. \"Pick 'em\nup. Carefully, now! Frog-march 'em, face-downwards. That's better! Now,\nforward. Quick, march!\"\n\nThe procession advanced toward the guardhouse in grim silence, and once\nagain there was no challenge when there should have been. The lamp was\nstill burning in the guardroom, for they could see it plainly as they\ndrew nearer, but there was no noise of a sentry's footfalls, or hoarse\n\"Halt!\" and \"Who comes there?\"\n\nNor was there any sign yet of the man whom Brown had left to guard both\n\"clink\" and guardroom. Brown let them take their dead comrades into the\nguardroom first, then set two fresh guards at the door, and covered up\nthe bodies with a sheet before commencing to investigate.\n\nHe started off toward the cell where he had imprisoned the fakir. He\nwent by himself, and no one volunteered to go with him.\n\nHe had gone five yards when the second explanation met his eyes. This\ntime there was no need to stoop down, nor to turn any body over. The\nsentry whom he had left to guard both cell and guardroom stood bolt\nupright, with his mouth and his eyes wide open; skewered to the wall of\nthe guardhouse by an iron spike, which pierced his chest.\n\n\"A lamp and four men here!\" ordered Brown, without waiting to let the\nhorror of the sight sink in. \"Take that poor chap down, and lay him in\nthe guardroom beside the others. How? How should I know? Pull it out, or\nbreak it off--I don't care which; don't leave him there, that's all.\"\n\nHe walked on toward the cell-door, while they labored, and fingered\ngingerly around the spike, which must have been driven through the\nsentry's chest with a hammer.\n\n\"I thought as much!\" he muttered. And, though he had not thought as\nmuch, he might have done so. \"I knew that a man who could maim his own\nbody in that way was capable of any crime in the calendar!\"\n\nThe door of the cell stood open, and there was no sign of any fakir, or\nof any one who might have helped him go--nothing but an empty cell, with\nthe haunting smell of the fakir still abiding in it.\n\nBill Brown spat, and closed the cell-door.\n\n\"I'm thinking that Juggut Khan told nothing but the truth,\" he muttered.\n\"Things look right, don't they, if that's so! Obey, Obey! I'd have liked\nto see England just once again--I would indeed. If I could only see her\njust once. If I'd a letter from her, or her picture. This is a rotten,\nrat-in-a-hole, lonely, uncreditable way to die! I wish Juggut Khan\nwere here. I'd have somebody to help me keep my good courage up in that\ncase.\"\n\nThe lock on the cell-door was broken, so he only closed it, then started\nback toward the guardroom.\n\n\"Three rifles, and three ammunition pouches gone!\" he muttered. \"That's\nthree weapons they've got, in any case. A hornet's nest'd be better\nstopping in than this place.\"\n\nHe overtook the men who were carrying in the nail-killed sentry, and he\nsaw that their faces were drawn and white. So were those of the other\nmen, who were clustered in the guardroom door.\n\n\"What next, Sergeant? Hadn't we better be quick? Why not burn the place?\nThat'd do instead o' buryin' the dead ones, and it'd give us a light to\nget away by. Might serve as a beacon, too. Might fetch assistance!\"\n\nIt was evident that panic had set in.\n\n\"Fall in!\" commanded Brown, and his straight back took on a curve that\nmeant straightness to the nth power.\n\n\"'Tshun! Ri'--dress! Eyes--front!\"\n\nHe glared at them for just about one minute before he spoke, and during\nthat minute each man there realized that what was coming would be quite\nirrevocable.\n\n\"I'm sergeant here. My orders are to hold this post until relieved.\nTherefore--and I hope there's no man here holds any other notion; I hope\nit for his own sake!--until we are relieved, we're going to hold it!\nMoreover, this command is going to be a real command, from now on. It's\ngoing to buck up. I'm going to put some ginger in it. There are three\ndead men here to be avenged, and I'm going to avenge 'em, or make you\ndo it! And if any man imagines he's going to help himself by feeling\nafraid, let me assure him that the only thing he needs to fear is me!\nI've a right to command men--I know how--I intend to do it. And if I've\ngot to make men first out of whey-faced cowards, why, I'm game to do it,\nand this is just where I begin! Now! Anybody got a word to say?\"\n\nThere was grim silence.\n\n\"Good! I'll assume, then, until I'm contradicted, that you're all brave\nmen. Into the guardroom with you!\"\n\n\"Sahib! Sahib!\" said a voice beside him.\n\n\"Well? What?\"\n\nIt was the Beluchi interpreter who had carried the lamp for him that\nevening when he arrested the fakir.\n\n\"Run, sahib! It is time to run away!\"\n\n\"Go on, then! Why don't you run?\"\n\n\"I am afraid, sahib.\"\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Of the men who slew the soldiers. Sahib! Remember what the fakir said.\nYou will be pegged out on an anthill, sahib, when you have been beaten.\nRun, while there is yet time!\"\n\n\"Did you see them kill my men?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib!\"\n\n\"How was that?\"\n\n\"I ran away and hid, sahib.\"\n\n\"How many were there?\"\n\n\"Very many. The Punjabi skin-buyer brought them.\"\n\n\"He did, did he? Very well! Did he go off with the fakir?\"\n\n\"I think he did. I did not see.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll suppose he did, then. And when the day breaks; we'll\nsuppose that we can find him, and we'll go in search of him, and I\nwouldn't like to be that Punjabi when I do find him! Get into the\nguard-room, and wait in there until I give you leave to stir.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nAn Indian city that has yet to have its mysterie's laid bare and\nbanished by electric light is a stage deliberately set for massacre. The\nbazaars run criss-crosswise; any way at all save parallel, and anyhow\nbut straight. Between them lies always a maze of passages, and alleys,\ndeep sided, narrow, overhung by trellised windows and loopholed walls\nand guarded stairways.\n\nFor every square inch where the sun can shine there are a hundred where\na man could hide unseen. Through century piled on suspicious century, no\ndesigner, no architect, no builder has neglected to provide a means of\nsecret ingress, and still more secret egress, to each new house. And the\nnewest house is built on secret passages that hid conspirators against\nthe kings of men who lived before the oldest house was thought of.\n\nAfter the Mutiny of '57 came broader roads--so that a cannon might be\ntrained along them.\n\nBut in '57, Jailpore was a nest of winding alley-ways and blind bat\nand rat holes, where weird smells and strange unlisted poisons and\nprophecies were born. In its midst, tight-packed in a roaring babel-din\nof many-colored markets, stood a stone-walled palace, built once by a\nHindu king to commemorate a victory over Moslems, added to by a Moslem\nNizam, to celebrate his conquest of the Hindus and added to once again\nby the Honorable East India Company, to make a suitable barracks for its\nnative troops.\n\nFrom the rat-infested slums, from the hot shadows and the mazy\nback-bazaars, from temples, store-houses, shops, and from the\nsin-steeped underworld, there screamed and surged and swept the\nmany-graded, many-minded polyglot rebellion-spume. A quarter of a\nmillion underdogs had turned against their masters. A hundred factions\nand as many more religions, all had one common end in view--to loot. All\nwere agreed on one thing--that the first stage of the game must be to\nturn Jailpore and, after Jailpore, India, into a charnel-house.\n\nAround and around the burning palace the mob screamed and swept\nuncontrolled. Moslem looted Hindu, and Hindu Moslem. Armed sepoys,\nwith the blood of their British officers fresh-soaked on their British\nuniforms, and the unspent pay of \"John Company\" still jingling in their\npockets, danced weird, wild devil-dances through the streets, clearing\ntheir way, when they saw fit, with cold steel or wanton volleys. Women\nscreamed. Caste looted caste. Loose horses galloped madly through the\nstreets. Here and there a pitched battle raged, where a merchant who had\nwealth had also courage, and apprentices and friends to help him defend\nhis store.\n\nAnd through all the din and clamor, under and above the howling and\nthe volleys and the roar of flames, sounded the steady thumping of\nthe sacred war-drums. The whole sky glowed red. The Indian night was\nscorched and smoked and lit by arson. Hell screamed with the cooking of\nred mutiny, and throbbed with the thunder of the sacred temple-drums.\nAnd that was only one of the hells, and a small one. India glowed red\nthat night from end to end!\n\nJuggut Khan, free-lance Rajput and gentleman of fortune, had ridden out\nof that caldron of Jailpore. His house was a heap of glowing ashes, and\nhis goods were tossed for and distributed among a company. But his mark\nlay indelibly impressed upon the town. There were three European women\nand a child who were nowhere to be found; and there was a trail that led\nfrom somewhere near the palace to the western gate. It was a red trail.\n\nIn one spot lay a sepoy pierced through by a lance, and with half of the\nlance-shaft still standing upright in him. That had been bad art--sheer\nplaying to the gallery! Juggut Khan had run him through and tried to\nlift him on the lance-end for a trophy. It was luck that saved the day\nfor him that time, not swordsmanship.\n\nBut a man who has done what he had done that day may be forgiven. There\nlay nine other men behind him where his lance was left, and each of them\nlay face upward with a round red hole in his anatomy where the lance had\nentered.\n\nAnd from the point where he had broken his lance and left it, up to\nwhere a self-appointed guard had refused at first to open the city gate\nfor him, there was a trail that did honor to the man who taught him\nswordsmanship. One man lay headless, and another's head was only part of\nhim, because the sword had split it down the middle and the two halves\nwere still joined together at the neck.\n\nThere were men who claimed afterward that of the twenty-three who lay\nbetween his lance-shaft and the city gate, some five or six had been\nslain in brawls and looting forays. And Juggut Khan was never known\nto discuss the matter. But the fact remains that every man of them was\nkilled by the blade or point of a cavalry-saber, and that Juggut Khan\nbroke out of the place untouched.\n\nAnd another fact worthy of record is, that underneath a stone floor, in\na building that was partly powder-magazine-surrounded at every end and\nside by mutineers who searched for them, and very nearly stifled by the\ndust of decaying ages--there lay three women and a child, with a jar of\nwater close beside them and a sack of hastily collected things to eat.\nThey lay there in all but furnace-heat, close-huddled in the darkness,\nand they shuddered and sobbed and blessed Juggut Khan alternately.\nBelow them the whispering echoes sighed mysteriously through a maze of\ntunnels. Around them, and around their sack of food, the rats scampered.\nAbove them, where a ten-ton stone trapdoor lay closed over their heads,\nblack powder stood in heaps and sacks and barrels. Closing the trapdoor\nhad been easy. One pushed it and it fell. Not all the mutineers in\nJailpore nor Juggut Khan nor any one could open it again without the\nsecret. And no man living knew the secret. The three women and the child\nwere safe from immediate intrusion!\n\nThose three women and that child were not so exceptionally placed for\nIndia, of that date. Two of the women had seen their husbands slain\nthat afternoon, before their eyes. They were mother and daughter and\ngrandson; and the fourth was an English nurse, red-cheeked still from\nthe kiss of English Channel breezes.\n\n\"If only Bill were here!\" the nurse wailed. \"I know he'd find a way out.\nThere wasn't never nothing nowhere that beat Bill. Bill wouldn't\nha' left us! Bill'd ha' took us out o' here, an' saved our lives.\nBill--snnff, snnff--Bill wouldn't ha'--snnff, snnff--shoved us in a\nrat-hole and took hisself off!\"\n\nShe had not yet lost her English point of view. She still believed that\nthe strong right arm of an English lover could play ducks and drakes\nwith Destiny. One-half of the world, at least, still swears that she\nwas wrong, and her mistress and the other woman thought her despicable,\nridiculous, unenlightened. It was a hardship to them, to be endured with\ndignity and patience, but none the less a hardship, that they should be\nleft and should have to die with this woman of the Ranks Below to keep\nthem company. She was an honest woman, or they would never have engaged\nher and paid her passage all the way to India. But she was not of their\njat, and she was a fool. It happens, however, that her point of view\nsaved England for the English, and that the other point of view had\nbrought England to the brink of utter ruin.\n\n\"If you'd leave off talking about your truly tiresome lover, and would\npray to God, Jane,\" said Mrs. Leslie, \"the rest of us might have a\nchance to pray to God too! This isn't the time, let me tell you, to be\nthinking of carnal love-affairs. Recall your sins, one by one, and ask\nforgiveness for them.\"\n\nIn the gloom of the vault, poor Jane was quite invisible. The sound\nof her snuffling and sobs was the only clue to her direction. But her\nbridling was a thing that could be felt through the stuffy blackness,\nand there was a ring in her retort that gave the lie to the tears that\nshe was shedding.\n\n\"The only sin I ask forgiveness for,\" she answered in a level voice, \"is\nhaving let Bill come to India alone. Pray to God, is it? Go on! Pray!\nIf Bill was here, he'd start on that stone door without no words\nnor argument, unless some one tried to stop him. Then there'd be an\nargument! And he'd get it open too. Bill's the kind that does his\nprayin' afterward, and God helps men like Bill!\"\n\n\"Well--I'm afraid that your Bill isn't here, and can't get here. So the\nbest thing that you can do is to pray and let us pray.\"\n\n\"I'll pray for Bill!\" said Jane defiantly. \"Bill don't know that I'm in\nIndia, and he surely doesn't know I'm here. But if he knew--Oh, God! Let\nhim know! Tell him! He'd come so quick. He'd--snnff, snnff--he'd--why,\nhe'd ha' been here long ago! Dear God, tell Bill I'm here, that's all!\"\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nGeneral Baines was in a position to be envied. No soldier worthy of his\nsalt is other than elated at the thought of war. Now for the proving\nof his theories. Now for the fruit of all his tireless preaching and\ninspection and preparing--the planned, pegged-out swoop to victory!\n\nHe knew--as few men in India knew--the length and the breadth of what\nwas coming. And when two of his non-commissioned officers sent in word\nthat the whole country was ablaze, he realized, as few other men did\nin that minute, that this was no local outbreak. The long-threatened\nholocaust had come, and he had to act, to smite, to strike sure and\nswift at the festering root of things, or Central India was lost.\n\nBut his hands were tied still. He knew. He could see. He could feel.\nHe could hear. But he had his orders. That very morning they had been\nrepeated to him, and with emphasis. In a letter from the Council he had\nbeen told that \"slight disturbances, of a purely local character, were\nnot without the bounds of possibility, due partly to religious unrest\nand partly to local causes. Under no circumstances were any extended\nreprisals to be undertaken until further orders, and generals commanding\ndistricts were required to keep the bulk of their commands within\ncantonments.\"\n\nThe countryside was up. All India probably was up. His own men, set by\nhimself to watch with one definite idea, had confirmed his worst fears.\nAnd he was under orders to stay with the bulk of his command in Bholat!\nCorked up in cantonments, with three thousand first-class fighting-men\nsquealing for trouble, and red rebellion running riot all around him\nthough it might be quelled by instant action!\n\nAnd then worse happened. Juggut Khan clattered in to Bholat, spurring\na horse that was so spent it could barely keep its feet. It fell in a\nwoeful heap outside the general's quarters, and Juggut Khan--all but as\nweary as the horse--swung himself free, staggered past the sentry at the\ndoor and rapped with his hilt on the tough teak panel. They had to give\nhim brandy and feed him before he could summon strength enough to tell\nwhat he had seen and heard and done.\n\n\"And Brown stayed on at the crossroads?\"\n\n\"Aye, General sahib! He stayed!\"\n\nThe general sat back and drummed his heels together on the floor in a\nway that his aides had come to recognize as meaning trouble.\n\n\"You say that all of the European officers in Jailpore have been\nkilled?\"\n\n\"I did not count. I did not even know them all by mine or sight. I\nthink, though, that all were killed. I heard men among the mutineers\ndeclare that all had been accounted for, save only three women and a\nchild, and me. Those four I myself had hidden, and as for myself--I too\nwas accounted for, and not without credit to the Raj for whom I fight!\"\n\n\"I believe you, Juggut Khan! Did you have to cut your way out?\"\n\nThe Rajput smiled.\n\n\"There was a message to deliver, sahib! What would you? Should I have\nwaited while they arrested me?\"\n\n\"Oh! You managed to evade them, did you?\"\n\n\"At least I am here, sahib!\"\n\nThe general chewed at his mustache, leaned his chair back against the\nwall and tapped at his boot with a riding-cane.\n\n\"Tell me, Juggut Khan,\" he said after another minute's thought, \"what\nis your idea? Is this sporadic? Is this a local outbreak? Will this die\ndown, if left to burn itself out?\"\n\nThe Rajput laughed aloud.\n\n\"'Sporadic,\"' he answered, \"is a word of which I have yet to learn\nthe meaning. If 'sporadic' means rebellion from Peshawur to Cape\nCormorin--revolution, rape, massacre, arson, high treason, torture,\ndeath to every European and every half-breed and every loyal native\nnorth, south, east and west--then, yes, General sahib, 'sporadic' would\nbe the proper word. If your Honor should mean less than that, then some\nother word is needed!\"\n\n\"Then you confirm my own opinion. You are inclined to think that this is\nan organized and country-wide rebellion?\"\n\n\"I know of what I speak, sahib!\"\n\n\"You don't think that you are being influenced in your opinion by the\nfact that you have seen a massacre, and have lost everything you had?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib! This is no hour for joking, or for bearing of false\ntidings. I tell you, up, sahib! Boots and saddles! Strike!\"\n\nThe general chewed at his mustache another minute.\n\n\"You know this province well?\" he asked.\n\n\"None better than I. I have traversed every yard of it, attending to my\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"And your business is?\"\n\n\"Each to his trade, sahib. My trade is honorable.\"\n\n\"I have good reasons for asking, and no impertinence is meant. Be\ngood enough to tell me. I wish to know what value I may place on your\nopinion.\"\n\n\"Sahib, I am a full sergeant of the Rajput Horse retired. I bear one\nmedal.\"\n\n\"And--\"\n\n\"I sell charms, sahib.\"\n\n\"What sort of charms?\"\n\n\"All sorts. But principally charms against the evil eye, and the red\nsickness, and death by violence. But, also love-charms now and then,\nand now and then a death-charm to a man who has an enemy and lacks\nswordsmanship or courage. I trade with each and every man, sahib, and\nlisten to the talk of each, and hold my tongue!\"\n\n\"Strange trade for a soldier, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Would you have me a robber, sahib? Or shall I sweep the streets--I, who\nhave led a troop before now? Nay, sahib! A soldier can fight, and can do\nlittle else. When the day comes that the Raj has no more need of him--or\nthinks that it has no more need of him--he must either starve or become\na prophet. And his own home is no place for a prophet who would turn his\nprophesying into silver coin!\"\n\n\"Ah! Well-now, tell me! What is your opinion, without reference to what\nanybody else may think? You have just seen the massacre at Jailpore,\nand you know how many men I have here. And you know the condition of\nthe road and the number of the mutineers. Would you, if you were in my\nplace, strike at Jailpore immediately?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib. That I would not. I would strike north. And I would strike\nso swiftly that the mutineers would wonder whence I came. In Jailpore,\nall is over. They have done the harm, and they are in charge there. They\nhave the powder-magazine in their possession, and the stands of arms,\nand the first advantage. Leave them there, then, sahib, and strike where\nyou are not expected. In Jailpore you would be out of touch. You would\nhave just that many more miles to march when the time comes--and it has\ncome, sahib!--to join forces with the next command, and hit hard at the\nheart of things.\"\n\n\"And the heart of things is--\"\n\n\"Delhi!\"\n\n\"You display a quite amazing knowledge of the game.\"\n\n\"I am a soldier, sahib!\"\n\n\"You would leave Jailpore, then, to its fate?\"\n\n\"Jailpore has already met its fate, sahib. The barracks are afire, and\nthe city has been given over to be looted. Reckon no more with Jailpore!\nReckon only of the others. Listen, sahib! Has any message come from the\nnext command? No? Then why? Think you that even a local outbreak could\noccur without some message being sent to you, and to the next division\nsouth of you? Why has no message come? Where is the next command? The\nnext command north? Harumpore? Then why is there no news from Harumpore?\nI will tell you, sahib.\"\n\n\"You mean, I suppose, that the country is up, in between?\"\n\n\"You know that it is up, sahib!\"\n\n\"You think that no message could get through to me?\"\n\n\"I know that it could not! Else had one already come. My advice to you,\nsahib, as one soldier to another and tendered with all respect, is to\nup and leave this Bholat. Here, of what use are you? Here you can hold a\nsmall city, until the countryside has time to rise and lay siege to you\nand hem you in! Outside of here, you can be a hornet-storm! They will\nburn Bholat behind you. Let them! Let them, too, pay the price. Swoop\ndown on Harumpore, sahib--join there with Kendrick sahib's command.\nThere make a fresh plan, and swoop down on some other place. But move,\nquickly, and keep on moving! And waste no time on places that are\nalready lost.\"\n\n\"Then you would have me leave those women and that child, that you tell\nme of to their fate?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib! I am not of your command. I have done my duty to the Raj,\nand I now go about my own business.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"To repay a debt that I owe the Raj, sahib!\"\n\n\"Your answers are rather unnecessarily evasive, Juggut Khan. Be good\nenough to explain yourself!\"\n\n\"I ride back to Jailpore, sahib. I would have stayed there, but it\nseemed right and soldierly to bring through the news first. Now, I\nreturn to do what I may to rescue those whom I hid there. I owe that to\nthe Raj!\"\n\n\"You mean that you will ride alone?\"\n\n\"At least half of the distance, sahib. I had a favor to ask.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Are you marching north, sahib?\"\n\n\"I have not determined yet.\"\n\n\"Determined, sahib! This is no hour for dallying! Give orders now! Up!\nStrike, sahib! Listen! Should you march on Jailpore, the mutineers, who\nfar outnumber you, will learn beforehand of your coming, and will put\nthe place in a state of defense. It may take you weeks to fight your way\nin! Leave Jailpore, and those who are left in it to me, and lend me that\nnon-commissioned officer of yours who guards the crossroads, and his\ntwelve men. With a few, we can manage what a whole division might fail\nto do. And you march north, sahib, and burn and harry and slay! Strike\nquickly, where the trouble is yet brewing, and not where the day is lost\nalready!\"\n\nIt was case of the British power in India on one side of the scale,\nagainst three women and a child on the other; sentiment in the balance\nagainst strategy. And strategy must win, especially since this Rajput\nwas offering his services.\n\n\"What are their names, you say?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Leslie, wife of Captain Leslie; Mrs. Standish, wife of Colonel\nStandish and mother of Mrs. Leslie; Mrs. Leslie's child--I know not his\nname, he is but a child in arms--and the child's nurse.\"\n\nThe general still found it difficult to make up his mind.\n\n\"What proof have I of you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Sahib, my honor is in question! I have a debt to pay!\"\n\n\"What debt?\"\n\n\"To the Raj.\"\n\n\"To the Raj?\"\n\n\"Aye, Sahib! I have but one son, and his life was saved for me by a\nBritish soldier. A life for a life. Four lives for a life. I ride! I\nneed, though, a fresh horse. And I ask for the loan of that sergeant,\nand those twelve men.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether a man such as you can realize exactly what it means\nto us to know that white women are in Jailpore, at the mercy of black\nmutineers? I mean, are you sufficiently aware of the extreme horror of\nthe situation?\"\n\n\"Knew you Captain Collins Sahib, of the Jailpore command?\"\n\n\"Know him well.\"\n\n\"Knew you his memsahib?\"\n\n\"She was a niece of mine.\"\n\n\"I slew her myself, with this sword!\"\n\n\"When? Why?\"\n\n\"Yesterday. Because her husband could not get to her himself, and since\nhe and I knew each other, and he trusted me. I said to her, 'Memsahib! I\nhave your husband's orders!' She asked me 'What orders, Juggut Khan?'\nI said, 'Why ask me, memsahib? Is my task easier, or yours?' She said\n'Obey your orders, Juggut Khan, and accept my thanks now, since I shall\nbe unable to thank you afterward!' And then she looked me bravely in the\nface, and met her death, sahib. Of a truth I know! I am to be trusted!\"\n\n\"I believe you, Juggut Khan. And, incidentally, I beg your pardon for\nhaving doubted you. Have you slept?\"\n\n\"Nay, Sahib. And I sleep not on this side of the crossroads!\"\n\n\"I don't place Sergeant Brown under your command--you'll understand\nthat's impossible--but, it's quite impossible for him to catch me up.\nHe may as well cooperate with you. Wait.\" He paused, and wrote, then\ncontinued, \"Here is a note to him, in which I order him to work with\nyou, and to take your advice whenever possible. Go to the stables, and\nchoose any horse you like except my first charger. Here--here is money;\nyou may need some. Count that, will you. How much is it? Four hundred\nrupees? Write out a receipt for it. Now, good luck to you, Juggut Khan.\nAnd if you should get through alive--I'll pay you the compliment of\nadmitting that you won't come through without the women, and I know that\nBrown won't--if you should have luck, and should happen to get through,\nwhy, look for me at Harumpore, or elsewhere to the northward of it. I\nstart with my division in an hour.\"\n\n\"Salaam, sahib!\" said Rajput, rising and standing at the salute.\n\n\"Salaam, Juggut Khan! Take any food, or drink, or clothing that you\nwant. Good-by, and your good luck ride with you. I feel like a murderer,\nbut I know I've done the best that can be done!\"\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nNow if Sergeant Brown possessed a sweetheart, and the sweetheart lived\nin England, and if Brown still loved her--as has already been more\nthan hinted at--it is not at all unreasonable to wonder why he had no\nlikeness of her, no news of her, nothing but her memory around which\nto weave the woof of sentiment--at least, it's not unreasonable so to\nwonder in this late year of grace.\n\nThen, though, in 1857, when a newspaper cost threepence or thereabouts,\nand schools were so far from being free that only the sons of gentlemen\n(and seldom the daughters of even gentlemen, remember) attended them,\nthe art of reading was not so common as it now is. Writing was still\nmore uncommon. And it has not been pretended that Brown was other than a\ncommoner. He was a stiff-backed man, and honest. And the pride that had\nraised him to the rank of sergeant was even stiffer than his stock. But\nhe came from the ranks that owned no vote, nor little else, in those\ndays, and he owned a sweetheart of the same rank as himself, who could\nneither read nor write. And when people whose somewhat primitive ideas\non right and wrong lead them to look on daguerreotypes as works of the\ndevil happen too to be living more than five thousand miles apart, when\none of the two can not write, nor readily afford the cost of postage,\nand when the other is nearly always on the move from post to post, it is\nnot exactly to be wondered at that memory of each other was all they had\nto dwell upon.\n\nA journey to India in '57 meant, to the rank and file, oblivion and\nworse. There were men then, of course, just as there are now, who would\nleave a girl behind them tied fast by a promise of futile and endless\ndevotion; men who knew what the girls did not know--that India was all\nbut inaccessible to any one outside of government employ, and that a\ncommon soldier's chance of sending for his girl, or of coming home\nagain to claim her, was something in the neighborhood of one in thirty\nthousand.\n\nBut there were other men, like William Brown, who were a shade too\nhonest and too stiff-chinned to buckle under to the social conditions\nof England in those days, and who were consequently not exactly pestered\nwith offers of employment. And a man who could see the difference\nbetween doffing his ragged cap to a dissolute squire or parson, and\nsaluting his better on parade, could also see the selfishness of leaving\nan honest girl to languish for him. Brown could not get a living in\nEngland. So he told his girl to get a better man, swung his canvas bag\nacross his shoulder and marched away.\n\n\"What kind of a man is a better man than Bill?\" she had wondered. Men\nlike Bill seem to have a knack of judging character, and of picking\ngirls who are as steadfast as themselves. So it is not to be wondered at\nthat almost before her tears were dry she had set about attempting what\nfew women of her type and time would have dreamed of. If Bill had set\nher free, she reasoned, Bill had no more authority over her, and she\nmight do exactly what she chose. Bill could release, but he could not\nmake her take another man. So, for all that the local yeomen, and local\ntradesmen even, haunted the little cottage on the Downs, and pestered\nher with their attentions, no one supplanted Bill.\n\nBill could tell her--and had told her--that India was no country for a\nwhite woman; that there were snakes there, and black men and tigers and\neven worse. But, since he had set her free, if she could manage it\nshe was quite at liberty to brave the tigers and the snakes. And, once\nthere, she would see whether she was free or not, and whether Bill was,\neither!\n\nIt took Bill Brown six years of constant honest effort to become a\nsergeant. It took Jane Emmett six weeks of pride-consuming and vexatious\nvigilance to procure for herself a job as nurse in a soldier-family. And\nit took her six more years of unremitting diligence, sweetened by all\nthe attributes that seem desirable when nursing other people's children\nand embittered by the shame of grudging patronage, before she was\nconsidered dependable enough to be recommended for the service of a\nfamily just leaving for Bengal. Then, however, her world was a real\nworld again!\n\nFive months on a sailing-ship around the Cape--deep-laden, gunwales\nawash in a beam--on Bay-of-Biscay \"snorer,\" hove-to for a week off Cape\nAgul--has, while the clumsy brigantine rolled the masts loose in her,\nall but dismasted in a typhoon come astray from the China Sea, fed on\nmoldy bread, and even moldier pork, with a fretful child to nurse, and\nan exacting mother to be pleased! Jane Emmett laughed at it. Bill had\nbeen there before her, and had done more on his way, and worse Bengal\ndid not frighten her. Nor did the knowledge, when she reached it, that\nBill was very likely still some hundreds of miles away. She, who had\ncome five thousand miles as the crows are said to fly and nine thousand\nby the map, could manage the odd hundreds. And she could wait. She had\nwaited six long years. What was another month or two?\n\nShe had not even a notion where Bill was, beyond a vague one that he\nbelonged to another province. For when the Honorable East India Company\nwas muddling the affairs of India, the honors and emoluments and\nprivileges--such as they were!--were reserved for the benefit of the\ncommissioned ranks.\n\nSo a transfer to Jailpore did not mean to Jane Emmett ten extra degrees\nof heat, the neighborhood of jungle-fever and a brand-new breed of\nsmells. Those disadvantages, which weighted down the souls of her\nemployers, were completely overshadowed, so far as she was concerned, by\nthe knowledge that she was traveling nearer by a hundred leagues or so\nto where her Bill was stationed. She was going west; and somewhere\nto the west was Bill. Anything was good--fever, and prickly heat, and\nsmells included--that brought her any nearer him.\n\nThere would be no sense in endeavoring to analyze her sensations when\nthe sudden outburst overwhelmed the inner-guard at Jailpore. The sight\nof white women being butchered, and of white men with the blood of their\nown women on their hands, selling their lives as dearly as the God\nof War would let them in a holocaust of flames, blinded her. It was\nprobably just a splurge of fire and noise and smoke and blood in her\nmemory, with one or two details standing out. The only real sensation\nthat she felt--even when a tall, lean Rajput flung her across his\nshoulder, ran with her and dropped her down through a square hole into\nstifling darkness--was a longing for Bill Brown, her Bill, the one man\nin the world who could surely stop the butchery.\n\nThe others prayed. But she refused to pray. She felt angry--not\nprayerful! Had she come nine thousand miles, and sacrificed six good\nyears of youth and youth's heritage, to be cast into a reeking dungeon\nand left to die there in the dark? Not if Bill should know of it! And\nso she changed her argument, and prayed for Bill. If only Bill\nknew--straight-backed, honest, stiff-chinned, uncompromising, plain Bill\nBrown. He would change things!\n\n\"Oh, Bill! Bill! Bill!\" she sobbed. \"Dear God, bring Bill to me!\"\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nWhen a man knows what is out against him, and from which direction he\nmay look to meet death, he only needs to be a very ordinary man to\nmake at least a gallant showing. Gallery or no gallery to watch, given\nresponsibility and trained men under hire, not one man in a thousand\nwill fail to face death with dignity.\n\nBut Brown knew practically nothing, and understood still less, of what\nwas happening. He had Juggut Khan's word for it that Jailpore was in\nflames, and that all save four of its European population had been\nkilled. He believed that to be a probably exaggerated statement of\naffairs, but he did not blink the fact that he might expect to be\noverwhelmed almost without notice, and at any minute. That was a fact\nwhich he accepted, for the sake of argument and as a working-basis on\nwhich to build a plan of some kind--His orders were to hold that post,\nand he would hold it until relieved by General Baines or death. But\nthere are several ways of holding a hot coal besides the rather obvious\none of sitting on it.\n\nIt would have been a fine chance to be theatrical, had play-acting been\nin his line. Many and many a full-blown general has risen to authority\nand fame by means of absolutely useless gallery-play. He believed that\nhe would presently be relieved by General Baines, who he felt sure would\nmarch at once on Jailpore; and had he chosen to he could have addressed\nthe men, have set them to throwing up defenses and have made a nice\ntheatrical redoubt that he could have held quite easily with the help\nof nine men for a day or two. And since the really worthwhile things go\noften unrewarded, but the gallery-plays never, nobody would have blamed\nhim had he chosen some such course as that.\n\nBut Brown's idea of holding down a place was to make that place a thorn\nin the side of the enemy. And since he did not know who was the enemy,\nor where he was, nor why he was an enemy, nor when he would attack, he\nproposed to find out these things for himself preparatory to making the\nsaid enemy as uncomfortable as his meager resources would permit, when\neked out by an honest \"dogged-does-it\" brain.\n\nHe buried the three men whom Fate had seemed to value at the price of a\nfakir's freedom. And, being a religious man, to whom religion was a fact\nand the rest of the universe a theory, he was able to say a full funeral\nservice over them from memory. He said it at the grave-end, with a\nlantern in his hand and one man facing him across the grave--as the\nEnglish used to drink when the Danes had landed, each watching for the\nglint of steel beyond the other's shoulder.\n\nAnd, four on each side of the trench that they had dug, the remainder\nknelt and faced the night each way--partly from enforced piety, and\npartly because eight men back to back, with their bayonets outward\nand their butts against their knees, are an awkward proposition for an\nenemy. They mumbled the responses because Brown made them do it, and\nthey kept their eyes skinned because the night seemed full of other\neyes, and sounds.\n\n\"And now, you men,\" said Brown, changing his voice to suit the nature of\nhis task, \"you can get your sleep by fours. I don't care which four of\nyou goes to sleep first, but there are only two watches of us left, and\nthere are about four hours left to sleep in, by my reckoning. That's two\nhours' sleep for each man. And we'll keep clear of the guardroom. As\nI understand my orders, the important point's the cross-roads. I'm\nsupposed to halt every one who comes, and to ask him his business. And\nthat'd be impossible to do from the guardroom here. Let this be a lesson\nto you men, now. In interpretin' orders, when a point's in doubt, always\nlook for the meaning of the orders rather than the letter of them,\nobeying the letter only when the meaning and the letter are the same\nthing. The letter of our orders says the guardroom. The meaning's clear.\nWe're here to guard the cross-roads. We take the meaning, and let the\nletter hang!\n\n\"Besides! The way it seems to me, if there's any more trouble cooking\nin this neighborhood, it's going to cook pretty fast, and it's going\nto boil around that guardroom; and if we're not in the guardroom, why,\nthat's point number one for us! Leave the guardroom lantern lighted, and\nbring out nothing but your cartridge-pouches and the box of ammunition.\nLeave everything else where it lies. Quick, now.\"\n\nThey obeyed him on the run, afraid to be out of his sight for a moment\neven, trusting him as little children trust a nurse, and ready to do\nanything so long as he would only keep them up and doing, and not make\nthem stay by the scene of the murders. Brown knew their state of mind\nas accurately as he knew the range of their service rifles, and he knew\njust how he could best keep panic from them. He knew too, if not what\nwas best to do, at least what he intended doing, and he knew how he\ncould best get them in a state to do it.\n\nBehind his own mind lay all the while a sense of loneliness and\nhopelessness. He did not entertain the thought of failure to hold the\ncrossroads, and he was so certain that General Baines would come with\nhis division that he could almost see the advance-guard trotting toward\nhim down the trunk road. But there is no accounting for a soldier's\nmoods, and something told him--something deep down inside him that he\ncould neither name nor understand--that he was out now on the adventure\nof a lifetime, and that the heart-cord which had held him tight to\nEngland all these years had been cut. He felt gloomy and dispirited, but\nnot a man of the nine who followed him had the slightest inkling of it.\n\nHe halted them outside the guardroom, and bullydamned two of them\nbecause some unimportant part of their accouterments was missing; and\nhe \"'Tshuned\" them, and stood them at ease, and \"'Tshuned\" them again,\nuntil he had them jumping at the word. Then he marched them two abreast\nin and out among the huts in search of any sign of native servants. They\nfound no sign of any one at all. Though in that black darkness it would\nhave been quite possible for half a hundred men to lie undetected. Brown\ndecided that the camp was empty. He thought it probable that any one\nconcealed there would have tried his luck on somebody at least, at close\nrange as he passed.\n\nSo he marched them back to the guard-room once again, and sent two\nof them in to drag out the shivering Beluchi, who had taken cover\nunderneath a cot and refused to come out until he was dragged out by the\nleg. The native's terror served to pull the men together quite a little,\nfor Tommy Atkins always does and always did behave himself with pride\nwhen what he is pleased to consider his inferiors are anywhere about.\nThey showed that unfortunate Beluchi how white men marched into the\ndarkness--best foot foremost; without halt or hesitation, when ghosts or\nmurderers or unseen marksmen were close at hand.\n\nThe Beluchi let himself be dragged, trembling, between two of them. It\nwas he who first saw something move, or heard some one breathe. For he\nwas absolutely on edge, and had nothing to attend to but his own fear.\nThe others had to keep both eyes and ears lifting, to please Brown the\nexacting. The Beluchi struggled and held back, almost breaking loose,\nand actually tearing his loin-cloth.\n\n\"Sahib!\" he whispered hoarsely. \"Sahib!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" demanded Brown, scarcely waiting for an answer, though.\nSomething told him what it was that moved, and his own skin felt\ngoose-fleshy from neck to heel.\n\n\"The fakir, sahib!\"\n\nThere was a murmur through the ranks, a sibilant indrawing of the\nbreath.\n\n\"Did I hear anybody swear?\" asked Brown.\n\nNobody answered him. All nine men stood stock-still, leaning on their\nrifles, their heads craned forward and their eyes strained in the\ndirection of the gloomy baobab.\n\n\"Form single rank!\" commanded Brown.\n\nThere was no response. They stood there fixed like a row of chickens\nstaring at a snake!\n\n\"Form single rank!\"\n\nHe leaped at them, and broke the first rule of the service--as a man may\nwhen he is man enough, and the alternative would be black shame.\n\nHis fist was a hard one and heavy, and they felt the weight of it.\n\n\"Form single rank! Take one pace open order! Extend! Now, forward--by\nthe right! Right dress, there!\"\n\nHe marched in front of them, and they followed him for very shame, now\nthat he had broken their paralysis.\n\n\"Halt! Port-arms! Charge bayonets!\"\n\nHe was peering at something in the dark, something that chuckled and\nsmelled horrible, and sat unusually still for anything that lived.\n\n\"Numbers One, Two, Three--left wheel--forward! Halt! Numbers Seven,\nEight, Nine--right wheel--forward! Halt!\"\n\nThey were standing now on three sides of a square. The fourth side\nwas the trunk of the baobab. Between them and the trunk, the streaming\ntendrils swayed and swung, bats flitted and something still invisible\nsat still and chuckled.\n\n\"One pace forward--march!\"\n\nThey could see now. The fakir sat and stared at them and grinned. Brown\nraised the lamp and let its rays fall on him. The light glinted off his\neyes, and off the only other part of him that shone--the long, curved,\nghastly fingernails that had grown through the palm of his upstretched\nhand.\n\n\"How did you get here?\" demanded Brown, not afraid to speak, for fear\nthat fright would take possession of himself as well as of his men, but\nquite well aware that the fakir would not answer him. Then he remembered\nthe Beluchi.\n\n\"Ask him, you! Ask him how he came here.\"\n\nThe Beluchi found his tongue, and stammered out a question. The fakir\nchuckled, and following his chuckle let a guttural remark escape him.\n\n\"He says, sahib, that he flew!\"\n\n\"Ask him, could he fly with nine fixed bayonets in him!\"\n\nThere was a little laughter from the men at that sally. It takes\nvery little in the way of humor to dispel a sense of the uncanny or\nmysterious.\n\n\"He answers, sahib, that you have seen what comes of striking him. He\nasks how many dead there be.\"\n\n\"Does he want me to hold him answerable for those men's lives?\"\n\n\"He says he cares not, sahib! He says that he has promised what shall\nbefall you, sahib, before a day is past--you and one other!\"\n\n\"Ask him, where is the Punjabi skin-buyer?\"\n\nThe fakir chuckled at that question, and let out suddenly a long, low,\nhollow-sounding howl, like a she-wolf's just at sundown. He was answered\nby another howl from near the guardroom, and every soldier faced about\nas though a wasp had stung him.\n\n\"Front!\" commanded Brown. \"Now, one of you, about turn! Keep watch that\nway! Is that the Punjabi?--ask him.\"\n\n\"He says 'Yes!' sahib. He and others!\"\n\n\"Very well. Now tell him that unless he obeys my orders on the jump,\nword for word as I give them, I'll hang him as high as Haman by\nthat withered arm of his, and have him beaten on the toenails with\na cleaning-rod before I fill him so full of bayonet-holes that the\nvultures'll take him for a sponge! Say I'm a man of my word, and don't\nexaggerate.\"\n\nThe Beluchi translated.\n\n\"He says you dare not, sahib!\"\n\n\"Advise him to talk sense.\"\n\n\"He says, sahib, 'You have had one lesson!\"'\n\n\"Now it's my turn to give him one. Men! We'll have to give up that\nsleep I talked about. This limping dummy of a fakir thinks he's got us\nfrightened, and we've got to teach him different. There's some reason\nwhy we're not being attacked as yet. There's something fishy going on,\nand this swab's at the bottom of it! We want him, too, on a charge of\nmurder, or instigating murder, and the guardroom's the best place for\nhim. To the guardroom with him. He'll do for a hostage anyhow. And where\nhe is, I've a notion that the control of this treachery won't be\nfar away! Grab him below the arms and by the legs. One of you hold\na bayonet-point against his ribs. The rest, face each way on guard.\nNow--all together, forward to the guardroom--march!\"\n\nThe fakir howled. Ululating howls replied from the surrounding night,\nand once a red light showed for a second and disappeared in front of\nthem. Then the fakir howled again.\n\n\"Look, sahib! See! The guardroom!\"\n\nIt was the Beluchi who saw it first--the one who was most afraid of\nthings in general and the least afraid of Sergeant Brown. A little flame\nhad started in the thatch.\n\n\"Halt!\" ordered Brown. \"Two of you hold the fakir! The\nremainder--volley-firing--kneeling--point-blank-range. Ready--as you\nwere--independent firing--ready! Now, wait till you see 'em in the\nfirelight, then blaze away all you like!\"\n\nHis last words were cut off short by the sound of rifle-fire. Each rifle\nin turn barked out, and three rifles answered from the night.\n\n\"Let that fakir feel a bayonet-point, somebody!\"\n\nThe fakir cursed between his teeth, in proof of prompt obedience by one\nof the men who held him.\n\n\"Tell him to order his crowd to cease fire!\"\n\nThe Beluchi translated, and the fakir howled again. The flames leaped\nthrough the thatch, and in a minute more the countryside was lit for\nhalf a mile or more by the glare of the burning guardroom.\n\nThe flames betrayed more than a hundred turbaned men, who hugged the\nshadows.\n\n\"Keep that bayonet-point against his ribs. See? That comes o' moving\ninstead o' sitting still! If we'd shut ourselves in the guardroom there,\nwe'd have been merrily roasting in there now! We stole a march on them.\nBeauty here was sitting on his throne to see the fun. Didn't expect us.\nThought we'd be all hiding under the beds, like Sidiki here! Goes to\nprove the worst thing that a soldier can do is to sit still when there's\ntrouble. We're better off than ever. We're free and they won't dare do\nmuch to us as long as we've got Sacred-Smells-and-Stinks in charge. Form\nup round him, men, and keep your eyes skinned till morning!\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nOf course, discussing matters in the light of history, with full and\nintimate knowledge of everything that had a bearing on the Mutiny, there\nare plenty of club-armchair critics who maintain that England could not\ndo otherwise than win in '57. They always do say that afterward of the\nside that won the day.\n\nBut then, with history yet to make, things looked very different, and\nnobody pretended that there was any certainty of anything except a\nvictory for the mutineers. All that either side recognized as likely to\nreverse conditions was the notorious ability that a beaten and cornered\nBritish army has for upsetting certainties. So the rebels had more\nthan a little argument as to what steps should be taken next, once the\ninitial butchery and loot had taken place.\n\nFor instance, in Jailpore\n\nMore than a hundred fakirs and wandering priests and mendicants had\nsent in word that the province from end to end was ready, and that the\nBritish slept. But there were those in Jailpore who distrusted fakirs\nand religious votaries of every kind. They believed them fully capable\nof rousing the countryside, of working on the religious feelings of the\nunsophisticated rustics and setting them to murdering and plundering\nright and left. But they doubted their ability to judge of the army's\nsleepiness. These doubters were the older men, who had had experience\nof England's craft in war. They knew of the ability of some at least of\nEngland's generals to match guile against guile, and back up guile with\nswift, unexpected hammer-strokes.\n\nThere were men who claimed that what had happened in Jailpore would be\nrepeated in Bholat and elsewhere. There was no need, these maintained,\nto march and join hands with other rebels. Each unit was sufficient to\nitself. Each city would be a British funeral pyre. Why march?\n\nSome said, \"The general at Bholat will learn of the massacre, and will\nlearn too, that not quite all were killed. He will come hotfoot to find\nthe four we could not find. For these British are as cobras; slay the\nhe cobra and the she one comes to seek revenge. Slay the she one and\nbeware! Her husband will track thee down, and strike thee. They are not\nordinary folk!\"\n\nThere were other factions that maintained that General Baines was strong\nenough, with his three thousand, to hold Bholat, unless the men of\nJailpore marched, to join hands with the Bholatis--who were surely in\nrevolt by this time. There were others who declared that he would leave\nBholat and Jailpore to their fates without any doubt at all, and would\nmarch to join hands with the nearest contingent, at Harumpore.\n\nThe bolder spirits of this latter faction were for setting off at once\nto prevent this combination. For a little while their arguments almost\nprevailed.\n\nBut another faction yet, and an even more numerous one, insisted it were\nbest to wait for news from other centers.\n\nWhy march, they argued, why strike, why run unnecessary risks, before\nthey knew what was happening elsewhere?\n\n\"Surely,\" these argued, \"the English will hear that four here are still\nunaccounted for. Some attempt will be made to find and rescue them. But\nif we find and slay them, and send their heads to Bholat, then will the\nEnglish know that they are indeed dead. Then there will be no attempt at\nrescue, and we shall hold Jailpore unmolested as headquarters.\"\n\nThat piece of logic won the day for a while, and parties were made up\nto explore the place, and search in every nook and cranny for the three\nwomen. and a child who surely had not passed out through any of the\ngates, and who were therefore just as surely in the city. A reward was\noffered by the committee of rebel-leaders and, although nobody believed\nthat the reward would actually be paid, the opportunities for looting\nprivately while searching were so great that the search was thorough.\n\nIt failed, though, for the very simple reason that nobody suspected that\nthe huge stone trap-door in the floor of the powder-magazine had ever\nbeen opened, or ever could be opened. The magazine had been a white\nman's watch. White men had kept guard over it for more than a hundred\nyears, and the natives had forgotten that a maze of tunnels and caverns\nlay beneath it.\n\nSo, while bayonet-points and swords were pushed into crevices, while\nsmoke was sent down passages and tunnels and great, loose-limbed,\nslobbering hounds were led on the leash and cast to find a trail, the\nthree women and the child lay still beneath the piled-up powder,\nand doled out water, and biscuit in siege-time measures. They lay in\npitch-darkness, in a vault where not even a sound could reach them,\nexcept the whispered echo of their own voices and the scampering of\nthe rats. They were growing nearly blind, and nearly crazed, with the\ndarkness and the silence and the fear.\n\nEvery second they expected to see daylight through the cracks above, as\nrebels levered up the door, or to hear feet and voices coming through\nthe vaults below, for doubtless the vaults led somewhere. But for their\nfear of snakes and rats and unknown horrors, they would have tried to\nfind a way through the vaults themselves. But as each movement that they\nmade, and each word that they spoke, sent echoes reverberating through\nthe gloom, they lay still and shuddered.\n\nOnce they heard footsteps on the stone flags overhead. But the footsteps\nwent away again, and then all was still. Soon they lost all count of\ntime. They were only aware of heat and discomfort and fear and utter\nweariness.\n\nOne woman and an infant wept. One woman prayed aloud incessantly. The\nthird woman--the menial, the worst educated and least enlightened of\nthe three, according to the others' notion of it--stubbornly refused to\nadmit that there was not some human means of rescue.\n\n\"If Bill were here,\" she kept on grumbling, \"Bill'd find a way!\"\n\nAnd in the darkness that surrounded her she felt that she could see\nBill's face, as she remembered it--red-cheeked and clean-shaven--six\nyears or more ago.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nThe blazing roof of the guardroom lit up even the crossroads for a\nwhile, and Brown and his men could see that for the present there was a\ngood wide open space between them and the enemy. The firelight showed a\ntree not far from the crossroads, and since anything is cover to men who\nare surrounded and outnumbered, they made for that tree with one accord,\nand without a word from Brown.\n\n\"We've all the luck,\" said Brown. \"There's not a detachment of any other\narmy in the world would walk straight on to a find like this!\"\n\nHe held up one frayed end of a manila rope, that was wound around the\ntree-trunk. Some tethered ox had rendered them that service.\n\n\"Fifty feet of good manila, and a fakir that needs hanging! Anybody see\nthe connection?\"\n\nThere was a chorus of ready laughter, and the two men who had the\nunenviable task of carrying the fakir picked him up and tossed him to\nthe tree-trunk. The roof of the guardhouse was blazing fiercely, and now\nthey had fired the other roofs. The fakir, the tree and the little bunch\nof men who held him prisoner were as plainly visible as though it had\nbeen daytime. A bullet pinged past Brown's ear, and buried itself in the\ntree-trunk with a thud.\n\n\"Let him feel that bayonet again!\" said Brown.\n\nA rifleman obeyed, and the fakir howled aloud. An answering howl from\nsomewhere beyond the dancing shadows told that the fakir had been\nunderstood.\n\n\"And now,\" said Brown, paraphrasing the well-remembered wording of the\ndrill-book, in another effort to get his men to laughing again, \"when\nhanging a fakir by numbers--at the word one, place the noose smartly\nround the fakir's neck. At the word two, the right-hand man takes the\nbight of the rope in the hollow of his left hand, and climbs the tree,\nwaiting on the first branch suitable for the last sound of the word\nthree. At the last sound of the word three, he slips the rope smartly\nover the bough of the tree and descends smartly to the ground, landing\non the balls of his feet and coming to attention. At the word four, the\nremainder seize the loose end of the rope, being careful to hold it in\nsuch a way that the fakir has a chance to breathe. And at the last\nsound of the word five, you haul all together, lifting the fakir off the\nground, and keeping him so until ordered to release. Now--one!\"\n\nHe had tied a noose while he was speaking, and the fakir had watched him\nwith eyes that blazed with hate. A soldier seized the noose, and slipped\nit over the fakir's head.\n\n\"Two!\"\n\nThe tree was an easy one to climb. \"Two\" and \"three\" were the work of\nnot more than a minute.\n\n\"Four!\" commanded Brown, and the rope drew tight across the bough. The\nfakir had to strain his chin upward in order to draw his breath.\n\n\"Steady, now!\"\n\nThe men were lined out in single file, each with his two hands on the\nrope. Not half of them were really needed to lift such a wizened load as\nthe fakir, but Brown was doing nothing without thought, and wasting not\nan effort. He wanted each man to be occupied, and even amused. He wanted\nthe audience, whom he could not see, but who he knew were all around him\nin the shadows, to get a full view of what was happening. They might\nnot have seen so clearly, had he allowed one-half of the men to be\nlookers-on.\n\n\"Steady!\" he repeated. \"Be sure and let him breathe, until I give the\nword.\" Then he seized the cowering Beluchi by the neck, and dragged him\nup close beside the fakir. \"Translate, you!\" he ordered. \"To the crowd\nout yonder first. Shout to 'em, and be careful to make no mistakes.\"\n\n\"Speak, then, sahib! What shall I say?\"\n\n\"Say this. This most sacred person here is our prisoner. He will die the\nmoment any one attempts to rescue him.\"\n\nThe Beluchi translated, and repeated word for word.\n\n\"I will now talk with him, and he himself will talk with you, and thus\nwe will come to an arrangement!\"'\n\nThere was a commotion in the shadows, and somewhere in the neighborhood\nof fifty men appeared, keeping at a safe distance still, but evidently\nanxious to get nearer.\n\n\"Now talk to the fakir, and not so loudly! Ask him 'Are you a sacred\nperson?' Ask him softly, now!\"\n\n\"He says 'Yes,' sahib, 'I am sacred!\"'\n\n\"Do you want to die?\"\n\n\"All men must die!\"\n\nThe answer made an opening for an interminable discussion, of the kind\nthat fakirs and their kindred love. But Brown was not bent just then on\ndissertation. He changed his tactics.\n\n\"Do you want to die, a little slowly, before all those obedient\nworshipers of yours, and in such a way that they will see and understand\nthat you can not help yourself, and therefore are a fraud?\"\n\nThe Beluchi repeated the question in the guttural tongue that apparently\nthe fakir best understood. In the fitful light cast by the burning\nroofs, it was evident that the fakir had been touched in the one weak\nspot of his armor.\n\nThere can scarcely be more than one reason why a man should torture\nhimself and starve himself and maim and desecrate and horribly defile\nhimself. At first sight, the reason sounds improbable, but consideration\nwill confirm it. It is vanity, of an iron-bound kind, that makes the\nwandering fakir.\n\n\"Ask him again!\" said Brown.\n\nBut again the fakir did not answer.\n\n\"Tell him that I'm going to let him save his face, provided he saves\nmine. Explain that I, too, have men who think I am something more than\nhuman!\"\n\nThe Beluchi interpreted, and Brown thought that the fakir's eyes gleamed\nwith something rather more than their ordinary baleful light. It might\nhave been the dancing flames that lit them, but Brown thought he saw the\ndawn of reason.\n\n\"Say that if I let my men kill him, my men will believe me superhuman,\nand his men will know that he is only a man with a withered arm!\nBut tell him this: He's got the best chance he ever had to perform\na miracle, and have the whole of this province believe in him\nforevermore.\"\n\nAgain the fakir's eyes took on a keener than usual glare, as he listened\nto the Beluchi. He did not nod, though, and he made no other sign,\nbeyond the involuntary evidence of understanding that his eyes betrayed.\n\n\"His men can see that noose round his neck, tell him. And his men know\nme, more or less, and British methods anyhow. They believe now, they're\nsure, they're positive that his neck's got about as much chance of\nescaping from that noose as a blind cow has of running from a tiger. Now\nthen! Tell him this. Let him come the heavy fakir all he likes. Tell\nhim to tell his gang that he's going to give an order. Let him tell them\nthat when he says 'Hookum hai!' my men'll loose his neck straight away,\nand fall down flat. Only, first of all he's got to tell them that he\nneeds us for the present. Let him say that he's got an extra-special\nawful death in store for us by and by, and that he's going to keep us\nby him until he's ready to work the miracle. Meantime, nobody's to touch\nus, or come near us, except to bring him and us food!\"\n\nThe fakir listened, and said nothing. At a sign from Brown the rope\ntightened just a little. The fakir raised his chin.\n\n\"And tell him that, if he doesn't do what I say, and exactly what I say,\nand do it now, he's got just so long to live as it takes a man to choke\nhis soul out!\"\n\nThe fakir answered nothing.\n\n\"Just ever such a wee bit tighter, men!\"\n\nThe fakir lost his balance, and had to scramble to his feet and stand\nthere swaying on his heels, clutching at the rope above him with his one\nuninjured hand, and sawing upward with his head for air. There came a\nmurmur from the shadows, and a dozen breech-bolts clicked. There seemed\nno disposition to lie idle while the holiest thing in a temple-ridden\nprovince dangled in mid-air.\n\n\"In case of a rush,\" said Brown quietly, \"all but two of you let go! The\nremainder seize your rifles and fire independently. The two men on the\nrope, haul taut, and make fast to the tree-trunk. This tree's as good a\nplace to die as anywhere, but he dies first! Understand?\"\n\nThe fakir rolled his eyes, and tried to make some sort of signal with\nhis free arm.\n\n\"Just a wee shade tighter!\" ordered Brown. \"I'm not sure, but I think\nhe's seeing reason!\"\n\nThe fakir gurgled. No one but a native, and he a wise one, could have\nrecognized a meaning in the guttural gasp that he let escape him.\n\n\"He says 'All right! sahib!'\" translated the Beluchi.\n\n\"Good!\" said Brown. \"Ease away on the rope; men! And now! You all heard\nwhat I told him. If he says 'Hookum hai!' you all let go the rope, and\nfall flat. But keep hold of your rifles!\"\n\nThe fakir's voice, rose in a high-pitched, nasal wail, and from the\ndarkness all around them there came an answering murmur that was like\nthe whispering of wind through trees. By the sound, there must have been\na crowd of more than a hundred there, and either the crowd was sneaking\naround them to surround them at close quarters, or else the crowd was\ngrowing.\n\n\"Keep awake, men!\" cautioned Brown.\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir! All awake, sir!\"\n\n\"Listen, now! And if he says one word except what I told him he might\nsay, tip me the wink at once.\"\n\nBrown swung the Beluchi out in front of him where he could hear the\nfakir better.\n\n\"I'll hang you, remember, after I've hanged him, if anything goes\nwrong!\"\n\n\"He is saying, sahib, exactly what you said.\"\n\n\"He'd better! Listen now! Listen carefully! Look out for tricks!\"\n\nThe fakir paused a second from his high-pitched monologue, and a murmur\nfrom the darkness answered him.\n\n\"Stand by to haul tight, you men!\"\n\n\"All ready, sir!\"\n\nThe rope tightened just a little--just sufficiently to keep the fakir\ncognizant of its position. The fakir howled out a sort of singsong\ndirge, which plainly had imperatives in every line of it. At each\nshort pause for breath he added something in an undertone that made the\nBeluchi strain his ears.\n\n\"He says, sahib, that they understand. He says, 'Now is the time!' He\nsays now he will order 'Hookum hai!' He says, 'Are you ready?' He says,\nsahib,--he says it, sahib,--not I--he says, 'Thou art a fool to stare\nthus! Thou and thy men are fools! Stare, instead, as men who are\nbewitched!'\"\n\n\"Try to look like boiled owls, to oblige his Highness, men!\" said Brown.\n\"Now, that's better; watch for the word! Easy on the rope a little!\"\n\nThe men did their best to pose for the part of semimesmerized victims\nof a superhuman power. The flame from the burning roofs was dying down\nalready, for the thatch burned fast, and the glowing gloom was deep\nenough to hide indifferent acting. With their lives at stake, though,\nmen act better than they might at other times.\n\nThe fakir spun round on his heels and, clutching with his whole hand at\nthe rope, began to execute a sort of dance--a weird, fantastic, horrible\naffair of quivering limbs and rolling eyeballs, topped by a withered arm\nthat pointed upward, and a tortured fingernail-pierced fist that nodded\non a dried-out-wrist-joint.\n\n\"Hookum hai!\" he screamed suddenly, waving his sound hand upward, and\nbringing it down suddenly with a jerk, as though by sheer force he was\nblasting them.\n\n\"Down with you!\" ordered Brown, and all except Brown and the Beluchi\ntumbled over backward.\n\n\"Keep hold of your rifles!\" ordered Brown.\n\nThe fakir's wailing continued for a while. With his own hand he took the\nnoose from his neck and, now that the flames had died away to nothing\nbut spasmodic spurts above a dull red underglow, there was no one in\nthe watching ring who could see Brown's sword-point. Only Brown and\nthe fakir knew that it was scratching at the skin between the fakir's\nshoulder-blades.\n\n\"It is done!\" said the fakir presently. \"Now take me back to my dais\nagain!\" And the Beluchi translated.\n\n\"I'd like to hear their trigger-springs released,\" suggested Brown.\n\"This has all been a shade too slick for me. I've got my doubts yet\nabout it's being done. Tell him to order them to uncock their rifles, so\nthat I can hear them do it.\"\n\n\"He says that they are gone already!\" translated the Beluchi.\n\n\"Tell him I don't believe it!\" answered Brown, whose eyes were straining\nto pierce the darkness, which was blacker than the pit again by now.\n\nThe fakir raised his voice into a howl--a long, low, ululating howl like\nthat he had uttered when they found him on his dais. From the distance,\nbeyond the range of rifles, came a hundred answering howls. The fakir\nwaited, and a minute later a hundred howls were raised again, this time\nfrom an even greater distance.\n\nThen he spoke.\n\n\"He says that they are gone,\" translated the Beluchi. \"He says he will\ngo back to his dais again.\"\n\n\"'Tshun!\" ordered Brown. \"Now, men, just because we've saved our skins\nso far is no reason why we should neglect precautions. We're going to\nput this imitation angel back on his throne again, so the same two carry\nhim that brought him here. There's no sense in giving two more men the\nitch, and all the other ailments the brute suffers from! Form up round\nhim, the rest. Take open order--say two paces--and go slow. Feel your\nway with your fixed bayonet, and don't take a step in the dark until\nyou're sure where it will lead you. Forward-march! One of you bring that\nrope along.\"\n\nThe weird procession crawled and crept and sidled back to where it had\nstarted from not so long before--jumping at every sound, and at every\nshadow that showed deeper than the coal-black night around them. It took\nthem fifteen minutes to recross a hundred yards. But when they reached\nthe earthen throne again at last, and had hoisted the fakir back in\nposition on it, there had been no casualties, and the morale of the men\nin Sergeant Brown's command was as good again as the breech-mechanism of\nthe rifles in his charge.\n\nThey were scarcely visible to him or one another in the blackness,\nbut he sensed the change in them, and changed his own tune to fit the\nchanged condition.\n\nHis voice had nothing in it but the abrupt military explosion when he\ngave his orders now--no argument, no underlying sympathy. He was no\nlonger herding a flock of frightened children. He was ordering trained,\ngrown men, and he knew it and they knew it. The orders ripped out, like\nthe crack of a drover's whip.\n\n\"Fall in, now, properly! 'Tshun! Right dress! To two paces--open\norder--from the center--extend! Now, then! Left and right wings--last\nthree at each end forward--right wheel--halt. That's it. 'Bout face. Now\neach man keep two eyes lifting till the morning. If anything shows up,\nor any of you hear a sound, shoot first and challenge afterward!\"\n\nThey were standing so when the pale sun greeted them, in hollow square,\nwith their backs toward the fakir, who was squatting, staring straight\nin front of him, on his dais, with his back turned to the tree and his\nwithered arm still pointing up to heaven like a dead man's calling to\nthe gods for vengeance.\n\nA little later, Brown made each alternate man lie down and get what\nsleep he could just where he was, with a comrade standing over him. He\nhimself slept so for a little while. But one of the men heard something\nmove among the hanging tendrils of the baobab, investigated with his\nbayonet-point, and managed to transfix a twelve-foot python. After that\nthere was, not so much desire for sleep. The fakir either slept with his\neyes open or else dispensed with sleep. No one seemed able to determine\nwhich.\n\nWhen the day grew hotter, and the utterly remorseless Indian sun\nbore down on them, and on the aching desolation of the plain and the\nburnt-out guardhouse, the fakir still sat unblinking, gazing straight\nout in front of him, with eyes that hated but did nothing else. He\nseemed to have no time nor thought nor care for anything but hate and\nthe expression of it.\n\nAt noon, three little children came to him, and brought him water in a\nsmall brass bowl, and cooked-up vegetables wrapped in some kind of leaf.\nBrown let him have theirs, and bribed the frightened children to go and\nbring water for the men and himself. He gave them the unheard-of wealth\nof one rupee between them, and they went off with it--and did not come\nback.\n\nMeanwhile the fakir had drunk his water, and had poured out what was\nleft. He had also eaten what the children had brought him, and suddenly,\nfrom vacant, implacable hatred, he woke up and began to be amused.\n\n\"Ha-ha!\" he laughed at them. \"Ho-ho!\" And then he launched out with a\nstring of eloquence that Brown called on the Beluchi to translate.\n\n\"Who said there would be thirst, and the sound of water! Is there a\nthirst? Who spoke of an anthill and of hungry ants and raw red openings\nin the flesh for the little ants to run in and out more easily?\"\n\nThe Beluchi translated faithfully, and the men all listened.\n\n\"Tell him to hold his tongue!\" growled Brown at last.\n\n\"Ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!\" laughed the fakir. \"The heat grows great, and the\ntongues grow dry, and none bring water! Ho-ho! But I told them that I\nneeded these for a deadlier death than any they devised! Ho-ho-ho-ho!\nLook at the little crows, how they wait in the branches! Ha-ha-ha-ha!\nSee how the kites come! Where are the vultures? Wait! What speck sails\nin the sky there? Even the vultures come! Ho-ho-ho-ho!\"\n\n\"I hear a horse, sir!\" said one of the men who watched.\n\n\"I heard it more than a minute ago,\" said Brown.\n\nThe fakir stopped his mockery, and even he listened.\n\n\"Ask him,\" said Brown, \"where are the men who set fire to the\nguardroom?\"\n\n\"He says they are in the village, waiting till he sends for them!\" said\nthe Beluchi.\n\n\"Keep an eye lifting, you men,\" ordered Brown. \"This'll be a messenger\nfrom Bholat, ten to one. Mind they don't ambush him! Watch every way at\nonce, and shoot at anything that moves!\"\n\n\"Clippety-clippety-clippety-cloppety--\"\n\nThe sound of a galloping horse grew nearer; a horse hard-ridden, that\nwas none the less sure-footed still, and going strong in spite of sun\nand heat. Suddenly a foam-flecked black mare swung round a bend between\ntwo banks, and the sun shone on a polished saber-hilt. A turbaned\nRajput rose in his stirrups, gazed left and right and then in front of\nhim--from the burned-out guardhouse to the baobab--drew rein to a walk\nand waved his hand.\n\n\"By all that's good and great and wonderful,\" said Brown aloud, \"if\nhere's not Juggut Khan again!\"\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\nIt is not easy to give any kind of real impression of India twenty-four\nhours after the outbreak of the mutiny. Movement was the keynote of\nthe picture--stealthy, not-yet-quite-confident pack-movement on the one\nhand, concentrated here and there in blood-red eddies, and, on the other\nhand, swift, desperate marches in the open.\n\nThe moment that the seriousness of the outbreak had been understood, and\nthe orders had gone out by galloper to \"Get a move on!\" each commanding\nofficer strained every nerve at once to strike where a blow would\nhave the most effect. There was no thought of anything but action, and\noffensive, not defensive action. Until some one at the head of things\nproved still to be alive, and had had time to form a plan, each\ndivisional commander acted as he saw fit. That was all that any one was\nasked to do at first: to act, to strike, to plunge in headlong where the\nmutiny was thickest and most dangerous, to do anything, in fact; except\nsit still.\n\nEven with the evidence of mutiny and treachery on every side, with red\nflames lighting the horizon and the stench of burning villages on every\nhand, the strange Anglo-Saxon quality persisted that has done more even\nthat the fighting-quality to teach the English tongue to half the world.\nThe native servants who had not yet run away retained their places\nstill, unquestioned. When an Englishman has once made up his mind to\ntrust another man, he trusts him to the hilt, whatever shade of brown or\nred or white his hide may be.\n\nBut, since every rule has its exceptions, there were some among the\nnative servants, who remained ostensibly loyal to their masters, who\nwould better have been shot or hanged at the first suggestion of\nan outbreak. For naturally a man who is trusted wrongly is far more\ndangerous than one who is held in suspicion. But it never was the\nslightest use endeavoring to persuade an average English officer that\nhis own man could be anything but loyal. He may be a thief and a liar\nand a proved-up rogue in every other way; but as for fearing to let him\nsleep about the house, or fearing to let him cook his master's food,\nor fearing to let him carry firearms--well! Perhaps, it is conceit, or\nmaybe just ordinary foolishness. It is not fear!\n\nSo, in a country where the art of poisoning has baffled analysts since\nanalysts have been invented, and where blood-hungry fanatic priests,\nboth Hindu and Mohammedan, were preaching and promising the reward\nof highest heaven to all who could kill an Englishman or die in the\nattempt, a native cook whose antecedents were obscured in mystery cooked\ndinner for a British general, and marched with his column to perform the\nsame service while the general tried to trounce the cook's friends and\nrelatives!\n\nBut General Baines felt perfectly at ease about his food. He never gave\na thought to it, but ate what was brought to him, sitting his horse most\nlikely, and chewing something as he rode among the men, and saw that\nthey filled their bellies properly. He had made up his mind to march on\nHarumpore, and to take over the five-hundred-strong contingent there.\nThen he could swoop down on any of a dozen other points, in any one of\nwhich a blow would tell.\n\nHe was handicapped by knowing almost too much. He had watched so long,\nand had suspected for so long that some sort of rebellion was brewing\nthat, now that it had come, his brain was busy with the tail-ends of\na hundred scraps of plans. He was so busy wondering what might be\nhappening to all the other men subordinate to him, who would have to be\nacting on their own initiative, that his own plans lacked something of\ndirectness. But there was no lack of decision, and no time was lost. The\nmen marched, and marched their swiftest, in the dust-laden Indian heat.\nAnd he marched with them, in among them, and ate what the cook brought\nhim, without a thought but for the best interests of the government he\nserved.\n\nSo they buried General Baines some eighty-and-twenty miles from\nHarumpore, and shot the cook. And, according to the easy Indian\ntheology, the cook was wafted off to paradise, while General Baines\nbetook himself to hell, or was betaken. But the column, three thousand\nperspiring Britons strong, continued marching, loaded down with\nhaversacks and ammunition and resolve.\n\nIt was met, long before the jackals had dug down to General Baines'\nremains, by the advance-guard of Colonel Kendrick's column, which was\ncoming out of Harumpore because things were not brisk enough in that\nplace to keep it busy. Kendrick himself was riding with the cavalry\ndetachment that led the way southward.\n\n\"Who's in command now?\" he asked, for they had told him of General\nBaines' death by poison.\n\n\"I am,\" said a gray-haired officer who rode up at that moment.\n\n\"I'm your senior, sir, by two years,\" answered Kendrick.\n\n\"Then you command, sir.\"\n\n\"Very good. Enough time's been wasted. The column can wait here until my\nmain body reaches us. Then we'll march at once on Jailpore. This idea\nof leaving Jailpore to its fate is nonsense! The rebels are in strength\nthere, and they have perpetrated an abominable outrage. There we will\npunish them, or else we'll all die in the attempt! If we have to raze\nJailpore to the ground, and put every man in it to the sword before we\nfind the four Europeans supposed to be left alive there, our duty is\nnone the less obvious! Here comes my column. Tell the men to be ready to\nmarch in ten minutes.\"\n\nHe turned his horse, to look through the dust at the approaching column,\nbut the man who had been superseded touched him on the sleeve.\n\n\"What's that? Better have a rest? Tired out, you say? Oh! Form them all\nup in hollow square, then, and I'll say a few words to them. There are\nother ways of reviving a leg-weary column than by letting it lie down.\"\n\nTen minutes later a dull roar rose up through a steel-shot dust-cloud,\nand three thousand helmets whirled upward, flashing in the sun. Three\nthousand weary men had given him his answer! There was no kind of handle\nto it; no reserve--nothing but generous and unconditional allegiance\nunto hunger, thirst, pain, weariness, disease or death. It takes a real\ncommander to draw that kind of answer from a tired-out column, but it\nis a kind of answer, too, that makes commanders! It is not mere talk, on\neither side. It means that by some sixth sense a strong man and his men\nhave discovered something that is good in each other.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\"You've made good time, friend Juggut Khan!\" said Brown, advancing to\nmeet him where the men and the fakir and the interpreter would not be\nable to Overhear.\n\n\"Sahib, I killed one horse--the horse you looted for me--and I brought\naway two from Bholat. One of them carried me more than fifty miles, and\nthen I changed to this one, leaving the other on the road. I have orders\nfor you, sahib.\"\n\n\"Hand 'em over then,\" said Brown. \"Orders first, and talk afterward,\nwhen there's time!\"\n\nThe Rajput drew out a sealed envelope, and passed it to him. Brown tore\nit open, and read the message, scowling at the half-sheet of paper as\nthough it were a death-sentence.\n\n\"Where's the general?\"\n\n\"With his column-twenty or thirty miles away to the northward by now!\"\n\n\"And he's left me, with this handful, in the lurch?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib! As I understood the orders, he has left you with a very\nhonorable mission to fulfil!\"\n\nBrown stared hard at the half-sheet of notepaper again. Reading was not\nhis longest suit by any means, and at that he infinitely preferred to\nwrestle with printed characters.\n\n\"Have you read it, Juggut Khan?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nay, sahib. I can speak English, but not read it.\"\n\n\"Then we're near to being in the same boat, we two!\" said Brown with\na grin. \"I'll have another try! It looks like a good-by message to\nme--here's the word 'good-by' written at the end above his signature.\"\n\n\"There were other matters, sahib. There was an order. I can not read,\nbut I know what is in the message.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"You, and your twelve--\"\n\n\"Nine!\" corrected Brown.\n\n\"Three dead?\"\n\nBrown nodded.\n\n\"Your nine, then, sahib, and you and I are to proceed immediately\nto Jailpore, and to gain an entrance if we can, rescue those whom I\nconcealed there and bring them to Harumpore, or to the northward of\nHarumpore, wherever we can find the column.\"\n\n\"Eleven men are to attempt that?\"\n\nBrown was studying out the letter word by word, and discovering to his\namazement that its purport was exactly what Juggut Khan pretended.\n\n\"If there are no more than eleven of us, then yes, eleven! And, sahib,\nsince you seem to hold at least an island here where a man may lie down\nunmolested, I propose to sleep for an hour or two, before proceeding. I\nhave had no sleep since I left Jailpore.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort!\" said Brown. \"If we're to march on Jailpore, off\nwe go at once! You can sleep on the road, my son! It's time we paid a\nvisit to that village, I'm thinking. Those treacherous brutes need a\nlesson. I'd have been down there before, only I wanted to be in full\nview of the road in case anybody came looking for me from Bholat. We'll\nneed a wagon for the fakir. You can sleep in it too.\"\n\n\"Sleep with a fakir? I? Allah! I am a Rajput, sahib! A sergeant of the\nRajput Horse, retired!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't want to sleep with him myself!\" admitted Brown. \"Come and\nlook at him. You can smell him from here, but the sight of him's the\nreal thing!\"\n\nThe Rajput swaggered up beside Brown, after loosening his horse's girths\nand lifting the saddle for a moment.\n\n\"He's not the only one that needs a drink!\" said Brown. \"We're all dry\nas brick-dust here, except the fakir!\"\n\n\"He must wait a while before he drinks. Show me the fakir. Why, Brown\nsahib, know you what you have there?\"\n\n\"The father of all the smells, and all the dirt and all the evil eyes\nand evil tongues in Asia!\" Brown hazarded.\n\n\"More than that, sahib! That is the nameless fakir--him whom they know\nas HE! Has there been no attempt made to rescue him?\"\n\n\"They rescued him once, and murdered three of my men to get him. When\nthey tried again, I put a halter round his neck and he and I arranged a\nsort of temporary compromise.\"\n\n\"And the terms of it?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's supposed to have performed a miracle. He made us unslip the\nhalter, and fall down flat, and he's supposed to be keeping us by him,\nby a sort of spell, so's to give us something extra-special in the line\nof ghastly deaths at his own convenience. That way, I was able to wait\nfor news from Bholat--see?\"\n\n\"You could have captured no more important prisoner than that, sahib,\nlet me tell you! They believe him to be almost a god; so nearly one\nthat the gods themselves obey his orders now and then! It was he, and no\nother, that told the men of Jailpore that he would make them impervious\nto bullets. If we have him, sahib, we have the key to Jailpore!\"\n\n\"We, have certainly got him,\" said Brown. \"You can see him, and you can\nsmell him. I'll order one of the men to prick him with a bayonet, if you\nwant to hear him, too! I wouldn't feel him, if I were you!\"\n\n\"He must come, too, to Jailpore!\"\n\n\"Of course he comes!\"\n\n\"Then, sahib, let us move away from here to where there is water. There\nlet us rest until sundown, and then march, in the cool of the evening.\nIt will be better so. And of a truth I must sleep, or else drop dead\nfrom weariness.\"\n\n\"Does that message put you in command?\" asked Brown, a trifle\ntruculently.\n\n\"No, sahib! But it orders you to listen to my advice whenever possible.\"\n\n\"That means that you are under my orders?\"\n\n\"That letter does not say so, sahib!\"\n\n\"Very well, are you, or are you not?\"\n\n\"We are supposed to act in concert, sahib.\"\n\n\"It doesn't say so in the letter! Yes, or no? Are you going to obey\norders, or aren't you? In other words, are you coming with me, or do you\nstay behind?\"\n\n\"I come with you, sahib!\"\n\n\"Then you obey my orders!\"\n\n\"But the letter says--\"\n\n\"That I'm to take your advice whenever possible! I don't need advice\njust at the moment, thanks! I've got orders here to march, and I'm off\nat once! You can please yourself whether you come with me or not, but if\nyou come you come on my terms.\"\n\n\"I go with you, sahib.\"\n\n\"Under my orders?\"\n\n\"Yes, sahib.\"\n\n\"All right, Juggut Khan. Here's my hand on it. Now, we'll swoop down on\nthat village, and take the fakir with us, with a halter round his neck\nfor the sake of argument. We'll get two bullock-carts down there, and\nwe'll stick him in one of them, with Sidiki the interpreter tied to him.\nSidiki won't like it, but he's only a Beluchi anyway! You get in the\nother, and get all the sleep you can. You and I'll take turns sleeping\nall the way to Jailpore, so's to be fresh, both of us, and fit for\nanything by the time that we get there!\"\n\n\"I am ready, sahib.\"\n\n\"You two men who carried old Stinkijink before, pick him up again!\"\nshouted Brown. \"Let him feel the bayonet if he makes a noise, but carry\nhim gently as though you loved him. The rest--'Tshun! Form two-deep--on\nthe center--close order, march. Ri' dress. Eyes front. Ri' turn. By the\nleft--quick march.\"\n\nThe Rajput strode beside Brown, wondering wearily whether it was worth\nhis while to offer him advice or not, and keeping his tired eyes ever\nmoving in the direction of the distant huts.\n\n\"They have rifles, sahib?\" he queried.\n\n\"Lots of 'em! Three that they took from my men, among others.\"\n\n\"It would not be well to march into a trap at this stage.\"\n\n\"As well now as later.\" \"True, sahib! And my time has not come yet; I\nknow it. Else had I died of weariness, as my horse did.\"\n\nBrown kept rigidly to that point of view in everything he did, from that\ntime on until he reached Jailpore. He believed himself to be engaged on\na forlorn hope that was so close to being an absolute impossibility as\nto be almost the same thing. He had no doubt whatever in his own mind\nbut that his own death, and the death of those with him, was a matter\nnow of hours, or possibly of minutes. His one resolute determination\nwas to die, and make the others die, in a manner befitting their oath\nof service. He had orders, and he would pass them on according to his\ninterpretation of them. He would obey his orders, and they theirs, and\nthe rest was no business of his or anybody's.\n\nThey put the fakir in a hut; where Juggut Khan--too weary for\nforaging--stood guard over him. When a crowd collected round the hut,\nand Juggut Khan applied the butt of a lighted cigarette to the tender\nskin between the fakir's shoulder-blades, the anxious fakir-worshipers\nwere told that all was well. They were to let the white soldiers take\ntwo wagons, or three even, if they wanted them. They were to return\nto their houses at once, and hide, lest the devils who would shortly\noverwhelm the white men should make mistakes and include them, too, in\nthe whelming. He, the fakir, intended to take the white men for a little\njourney along the road toward Jailpore, where the devils who would deal\nwith them would have no opportunity to make mistakes. And, since the\nnatives knew that Jailpore was a rebel stronghold, and that ten white\nmen and a native would have no chance to do the slightest damage there,\nthey chose to believe the fakir and to obey him.\n\nHindus have as stubborn and unalterable a habit of obeying and believing\ntheir priests--when the fancy suits them--as white men of other\nreligions have.\n\nIf the fakir had told them through the doorway of the hut that he\nintended going with the white men in the direction of Bholat, they would\nmost surely have prevented him. But it suited them very well indeed to\nhave the white men killed elsewhere. It was not likely, but there might\nbe a column on its way from Bholat now; and if that column came, and\nfound the bones of British soldiers as well as a burned-out guard-house,\nvengeance would be dire and prompt. Between where they were and\nJailpore, the white men could not possibly escape. And at Jailpore,\nif not sooner, they must surely die. So they believed the fakir, and\nretired to the seclusion of their houses.\n\nIt was wonderful, of course, but no more wonderful than a thousand other\nhappenings in '57. All laws of probability and general average were\nupset that year, when sixty thousand men held down an armed continent.\nEven stranger things were happening than that two bullock-carts\nshould dawdle through a rebel-seething district in the direction of a\nplundered, blood-soaked rebel stronghold; stranger even than that on\nthe foremost bullock-cart a lean and louse-infested fakir should be\nsquatting, guarded by British soldiers, who marched on either hand; or\nthat a Rajput, who could trace his birth from a thousand-year-long line\nof royal chieftains, should be sleeping in the bullock-cart behind,\nfollowed closely by a black charger with a British saddle on its back,\nwhich ate corn from the tail-board of the wagon; stranger things, even,\nthan that a British sergeant should be marching last of all, with his\nstern eyes roving a little wildly but his jaw set firm and his tread as\nrigid and authoritative and abrupt as though he were marching to inspect\naccouterments.\n\nIn more than a dozen places, about a dozen men were holding a fort\nagainst an army. They were using every wile and trick and dodge that\ningenuity or inspiration could provide them with, and they were mostly\ncontriving to hold out. But there were none who did anything more daring\nor more unusual than to march to the attack of a city, with a hostile\nfakir in the van, and nothing else but their eleven selves and their\nrifles to assist them. There is a tremendous difference between\ndefending when you have to, and attacking when you might retire.\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\nThere were many more causes than one that worked together to make\npossible the entry of Brown and his little force into Jailpore. They\nwere brave men; they were more than brave and they held the ace of\ntrumps, as Brown had stated, in the person of the fakir known as \"He.\"\nBut luck favored them as well, and but for luck they must have perished\nhalf a dozen times.\n\nThey marched the whole of the first afternoon, and met no one. They only\novertook little straggling parties of rebels, making one and all for\nJailpore, who bolted at the sight of them, imagining them probably to be\nthe advance-guard of a larger force. The very idiocy of marching eleven\nstrong through a country infested by their enemies was in their favor.\nNobody could believe that there were no more than eleven of them. Even\nthe English could not be such lunatics!\n\nThat night, they rested for a while, and then went on again. During the\nday following they lay in a hollow between some trees and rested, and\nslept by turns. They suffered agonies from the heat, and not a little\nfrom hunger, and once or twice they were hard put to it to stop the\nRajput's charger from neighing when a native pony passed along the\nnearby road. But night came again, and with it the screen of darkness\nfor their strange, almost defenseless caravan. Once or twice the\nfakir tried to shout an alarm to passing villagers, but the quick and\nenergetic application of a cleaning-rod by Brown stopped him always\nin the nick of time, and they came within sight of the battlements of\nJailpore without an accident.\n\nThen, though, their problem became really serious, and it was a series\nof circumstances altogether out of their control and not connected\nwith them that made their entry possible. The mutineers in Jailpore had\nlearned that Kendrick sahib was coming down on them from the north by\nforced marches with thirty-five hundred men or more. They were putting\nthe place into a state of siege, and getting ready by all means in their\npower to oppose him.\n\nLittle attention was being paid to small parties of arrivals from no man\nknew or cared where. And, in a final effort to find the four who were\nthe lure that was bringing Kendrick down on them, the city was once\nmore being turned upside down and inside out, and men were even being\ntortured who were thought to know of hiding-places.\n\nWith purely Eastern logic, the leaders of the rebels had decided that\nthe sight of the bodies of the four, writhing in their last agony on the\nsun-scorched outer wall, would mightily discourage the British when they\ncame. So no efforts were being spared and no stones left unturned to\nfind them. The hooks on the wall were sharp and ready, so that they\nmight be impaled without loss of time in full view of their would-be\nrescuers.\n\nAlmost every secret passage of the thousand odd had been explored. In\nthe hurry to run through them and explore the next one, doors had been\nleft open here and there that had been kept closed in some instances for\ncenturies.\n\nOne door in particular, placed cornerwise in a buttress of the outer\nwall, was spotted by Juggut Khan as he circled round the city on his\ncharger at dusk on the day following their arrival. He brought his\ncharger back to where the others lay concealed, and then went on an\nexploring-expedition on foot--to discover that the outer city wall\nwas like a sponge, a nest of honey-combed cells and passages wandering\ninterminably in the fifty-foot-thick brick and rubble rampart.\n\nAnd while he searched amid the mazy windings of the wall, Bill Brown sat\nin the forked top of a tree and studied out the ground-plan of the city.\nHe was imprinting landmarks in his memory for future reference, and\ntrying--with a brain that ached from the apparent hopelessness of the\ntask--to figure out a plan.\n\nHe knew by now that the four he had come to rescue were hidden\nunderneath the powder-magazine, and he could see the magazine itself.\nBut he could think of no way of rescuing them, for the city absolutely\nboiled with frantic, mixed-up castes and creeds picked at random, and\nthrown in at random from the whole of India. A mouse could not have\npassed through the streets undetected! And yet, from a soldier's point\nof view, there were certain fascinating details to be noticed about\nthat powder-magazine. In the first place, it had been constructed for\na granary by an emperor who never heard of Joseph, but who had the same\nideal plan for cornering the people's food-supply. And since labor had\nbeen unlimited, and cheap, he had gone about building the thing on the\nmost thoroughly unpractical and most pretentious plan that he and his\narchitects could figure out. It was big enough to hold about ten times\nas much grain as the province could grow in any one year of plenty. And,\nsince that was the least practical and most ungranary-like shape, he had\ncaused it to be built like an enormous beehive, with a tiny platform at\nthe top.\n\nWinding round and round the huge stone dome, and on the outside, was a\nsix-foot-wide trail, which was the elevator. Up this, each with a sack\nor a basket on his head, the population was to have been induced to run\nin single file, dumping its hard-won corn into the granary through an\nopening at the top until the granary was full.\n\nThe emperor died--by poison--before he could see his cherished project\nput into execution, but he had been a very thorough calculator, and\na builder who believed in permanency. He had foreseen that when the\ngranary was full, and the screw-jacks were turned beneath the cost of\nliving, there would probably be efforts made by unwashed, untutored,\nunenlightened mobs to rape his storehouse. So he had made the little\nplatform at the top a veritable fortress of a place, such as a handful\nof men could hold against a hundred thousand.\n\nThere was no known entrance to the granary above ground, except on the\nground level, where a huge stone gateway frowned above a teak-and-iron\ndoor. Above that door there were galleries, and fortalices and cunningly\ninvented battlements in miniature, from behind whose shelter a resolute\ndefending-party could pour out a hundred different kinds of death on a\nhungry crowd. The place was naturally fire-proof and naturally cool--as\nfar as any building can be cool in Central India. It was a first-class,\nideal powder-magazine, if useless as a granary; and the last new\nconquerors of India had hastened to adopt it as a means of storing up\nthe explosive medicine with which they kept their foothold.\n\nNaturally, none but White soldiers, and a very few of the more trusted\nnatives, had ever been allowed to go inside the powder-magazine.\nThe secret passages beneath it had never been intended for public\nconvenience or information. They had been designed as a means of rushing\ndefenders secretly into the granary, and they connected with a tunnel\nunderneath the palace that had just been burned. They also connected\nwith the outer wall in such a way that defenders from the ramparts might\nbe rushed there too, if wanted in a hurry. But, since there never had\nbeen corn kept in the granary, and nobody had ever had the slightest\nneed to force an entrance, the knowledge even of the existence of the\npassages had become barely a memory, and there was not a man living in\nJailpore who knew exactly where they began or where they ended. There\nwas a man outside who knew, but none inside.\n\nThe point about the powder-magazine which most appealed to Brown--next\nafter his knowledge of its contents, mineral and human--was the fact\nthat the little platform at its summit overlooked the city-wall, and\nthat the side of the granary actually touched the wall on the side of\nthe city farthest from where he sat and spied it out. Ten men on that\nprotected platform, he thought, might suffer from the sun, but they\ncould hold the building and command a good-sized section of the city\nramparts against all comers.\n\nHe noticed too, though that seemed immaterial at the time, that one\nwell-aimed shot from heavy ordnance might crash through the upper dome\nand set off the powder underneath. There was no artillery that could\nbe brought against the place, either with the British force or with the\nmutineers, but the thought set him to wondering how much powder there\nmight be stored on the huge round floor below, and what would happen\nshould it become ignited. It was a sanguinary, interesting, subtle kind\nof thought, that suited the condition of his brain exactly! He climbed\ndown from the tree, feeling almost good-natured.\n\nAt the bottom he met Juggut Khan, waiting for him patiently.\n\n\"What have you seen, sahib?\" he asked him. \"Have you formed a plan?\"\n\n\"I've been wishing I was Joshua!\" said Brown. \"I'd like to make my men\nmarch round the city and blow trumpets, and then see the walls fall\ndown. I can think of several things to do, if we could only get inside.\nBut I can't think how to get there.\"\n\n\"I have found a way in!\" said Juggut Khan. \"I have cross-questioned\nthat fakir of ours as well, with a little assistance from a cleaning-rod\nwielded by one of your men. He knows the way too. He says he is the only\nman who knows it--in which he lies, since I too have discovered it. But\nhis knowledge may help as well.\"\n\n\"What's that about a cleaning-rod?\" asked Brown.\n\n\"It was used on him to help him forget his vow of silence.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"When you were up that tree, sahib!\"\n\n\"Have you been giving my man orders?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib!\"\n\n\"How did he come to beat the fakir, then?\"\n\n\"We both arrived at the same conclusion at the same moment, and the\nfakir received the benefit!\"\n\n\"Who held him, you?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib! God forbid! I am a clean man. I listened to his\nconversation. The Beluchi held him.\"\n\n\"Oh! Well, I like you well enough, Juggut Khan, but there are things\nabout you that I don't like. You're too fond of doing things on your own\nresponsibility, and you're much too fond of using oaths. Y our soul\nis none o' my business; you're a heathen anyhow, and no longer in the\nService. But, I'll trouble you not to use those disgraceful oaths of\nyours in the presence of the men! Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"I understand you, sahib. If my respect for all your other qualities\nwere not so profound, I would laugh at you! As it is, if your honor\nshould see fit to turn the bullocks loose, and tie the fakir fast\nbetween two men and follow me, it seems to me dark enough by now, and I\nknow the way. Might I furthermore suggest that the ammunition-box would\nmake a reasonable load for another two men?\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better bring our rifles too?\" asked Brown sarcastically.\n\"Upon my honor, Juggut Khan! You're getting childish! Are your nerves\nupset, or what? Lead on, man! Lead on!\"\n\n\"Listen. There are two ways, sahib. One way leads from the burned-out\nbarracks to the cellar where the women lie hidden. That way is closed by\ndebris. The other way leads from the outer wall by a very winding route\nto the cellar where the women are. The fakir knows that way, and I do\nnot, though I know of it. There is a third way, though, that leads from\nthe outer wall, where I have been exploring, straight almost, if you\ndisregard a wind or two, to the inside of the powder-magazine. It\nenters the magazine through a doorway secretly contrived in an upright\npillar--or so the fakir swears. Now this is my notion, sahib. If we\ngo in by the lower way, we must come out that way, and run the risk of\nbeing caught as we emerge. That risk will be greatly enhanced when\nwe have frightened women with us whose eyes have been blinded by the\ndarkness. But, if we go in by the upper way, and enter the magazine\nitself, I can make the fakir show us how to lift the stone trapdoor I\nspoke of--the one that I closed when I hid the women. Then I can ascend\nwith him, and with say four men, while you ascend to the platform at the\ntop with the remainder of the men, and guard our rear and our exit.\nFrom the top, you will be able to see us as we emerge, and can cover our\nretreat, and follow.\"\n\n\"That sounds like a roundabout sort of plan to me!\" said Brown. \"Why not\ngo straight in by the lower route, and gather up the women, and carry\n'em out, and make a bolt for it?\"\n\n\"Because, sahib, we will be at the fakir's mercy.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! He's at our mercy.\"\n\n\"Think, sahib! There, he will be in his own bat's nest, so to speak.\nThese fakirs are the only men who know the windings of all the secret\npassages. They are the rats of religion and intrigue. At any step he\nmight lead us into an ambush, and we might be overwhelmed before we knew\nthat we were attacked. If we go the other way, though, I can lead the\nway myself, and we need only take the fakir to show us how to open the\ndoor.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Brown. \"Let's get a move on, though! I'm beginning to\nthink that you're a better talker than a fighter, Juggut Khan!\"\n\n\"Yes, sahib? I trust there will be no fighting!\" But the Rajput smiled\nas he said it, and thought of a certain lance-shaft which had been\nbroken in the streets of Jailpore.\n\n\"Lead on! Fall in behind me, men! Walk quietly, now, and remember. Hold\nyour tongues! Each man keep his eye on me, and a finger on the trigger!\"\n\nThe Beluchi and the fakir and Juggut Khan moved in the van, with two\nmen to hold the fakir. Next marched, or rather tiptoed, Sergeant Brown,\nfollowed by the other men in single file. In that order they hastened\nafter Juggut Khan, through the darkness, across a dried-out moat and\nround the corner of a huge stone buttress. There they disappeared inside\nthe wall, and a stone swung round and closed the gap behind the last of\nthem. There was no alarm given, and not a sign or a sound of any kind\nto betoken that any one had seen them. Inside the walls the city roared\nlike a flood-fed maelstrom, and outside all was darkness and the silence\nof the dead.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\nThere was some smart work done inside the powder-magazine. To be able to\nappreciate it properly one would be obliged to do what they did--wander\nthrough a maze of tunnels in a city-wall, blinded by darkness, oppressed\nby the stored-up stuffiness and heat of ages and deafened by the\nstillness--then emerge unexpectedly in the lamp-lit magazine, among\nmutineers who sprawled, and laughed; and chewed betel-nut at their ease\nupon the powder-kegs.\n\nBoth sides were taken by surprise, but the mutineers had the nominal\nadvantage, for their eyes were accustomed to the light. They had the\nadvantage in numbers, too, by almost two to one. But they dared not\nfire, for fear of setting off the magazine, whereas Brown and his little\nforce dared anything. They fully expected to die, and might as well die\nthat way as any other. And a quick death for the women down below would\nbe better than anything the rebels had in store for them. Brown yelled\nan order, and the rest was too quick, nearly, for the eye to follow.\n\nThree rebels died with bullets in them, and the rest stampeded for the\nteak-and-metal door, to find it locked on them, and Brown and the Rajput\nstanding in front of it on guard. The mutineers attacked fiercely. They\nflung themselves all together on the two. But they had yet to learn that\nthey were tackling, or endeavoring to tackle, the two finest swordsmen\nin that part of India. And when they turned, to find more room to fight\nin, or to draw their breath, they had to face nine bayonets that hemmed\nthem in, and drove them closer and even closer to the swords again.\nThey shouted, but no sound could pierce the walls or escape through that\ntremendous door. Even the sound of firing merely echoed upward until it\nreached the dome, and then filtered out and upward through the opening\nabove. They might as well have shouted to their friends in Bholat!\n\nFor ten minutes, perhaps, the battle surged and swayed on the stone\nfloor first one side rushing, then the other. But man after man of the\nmutineers went down--appalled by the amazing swordsmanship, disheartened\nby the grim determination of their adversaries, bewildered to feebleness\nby the suddenness of the attack.\n\nSoon there were but eight of them facing the blood-wet steel, and then\nBrown shouted for a fresh formation, swung his contingent into line and\nled them with a rush across the floor that swept the remaining mutineers\noff their feet.\n\nThree more went down with steel through them, and then the rest\nsurrendered, throwing down their arms, and begging mercy. Brown made a\nbundle of their arms, stowed it in a corner and made the prisoners stand\ntogether in a bunch, while he searched them thoroughly.\n\n\"If we can't get that trapdoor open now, with these to help us,\" he\nremarked, panting and wiping the dotted blood off his sword on a Hindu\nprisoner's trousers, \"it'll be a heavier proposition than I think!\"\n\n\"There's a trick to it,\" said Juggut Khan, panting too, for the battle\nhad been fierce and furious while it lasted. \"The fakir knows the trick.\nIt is heavy, in any case. But, if we make him tell us, we can manage\nit.\"\n\nThere followed delay while the fakir was induced to forego the pleasure\nof a sulking fit. He seemed like a child, anxious to emphasize their\ndependence on his knowledge, and needing to be recompelled to each new\nthing they needed of him. He was perfectly content, though, to surrender\nwhen he felt the weight of a cleaning-rod on his anatomy, or something\nin the way of fire--a match or cigarette for instance--placed where he\nwould get the most sensation from it.\n\nThen followed more delay, while they rigged a lever of sorts, and a rope\nthrough an iron ring in the trap, and while Juggut Khan hunted for the\nsecret catch that the fakir swore was hidden underneath a smaller stone\nthat hinged in the middle of the floor. He found it at last, moved it\nand came across to lend a hand with the lever and the rope.\n\nThe fakir sat still and smiled at them. His eyes gleamed more horridly\nthan ever, and his withered arm seemed more than ever to be calling down\ndire vengeance on them.\n\n\"I believe that monster is up to tricks of some kind!\" swore Brown.\n\n\"He can't do anything,\" said Juggut Khan. \"If we were all to put our\nweight against this, all together, we and the prisoners, sahib, we could\nget it open in a second.\"\n\n\"All together, then!\" said Brown. \"Come on, there! Lend a hand!\"\n\nThe prisoners and Brown's men and Juggut Khan and the Beluchi bent\ntheir backs above the lever, or hauled taut on the rope, and the fakir\nwriggled with some secret joke.\n\n\"At the word three!\" said Brown. \"Then all together!\"\n\n\"One!\"\n\n\"Two!\"\n\nThe fakir writhed delightedly. He seemed more than ever like a wickedly\nmalicious child.\n\n\"Three!\"\n\nThey strained their utmost, and the huge stone trap gave way with a\nsudden jerk.\n\n\"For the love of--\"\n\nThey all jumped, but they were strained in the wrong position for a\nquick recovery, and the ten-ton rock rolled back on unseen hinges to\ncrush them all, and rolled back and yet farther back--and then stayed!\nBrown had snatched a rifle, and had placed it between the rolling rock\nand the wall!\n\nHe stood wiping the sweat from his forehead, while the rest recovered\ntheir lost balance and walked out from behind unscathed. The rifle\ncreaked and bent and split. Then the stone leaned farther back, reached\nthe wall and stayed there!\n\n\"A near thing that!\" said Brown. \"That fakir's a bright beauty, isn't\nhe!\"\n\n\"Shall I kick him, sir?\" asked one of Brown's men.\n\n\"Kick him? No! What good'd that do? What next, Juggut Khan?\"\n\nBut Juggut Khan was bending down, and listening at the hole laid bare by\nthe huge hinged trap.\n\n\"Silence!\" commanded Brown.\n\nThe men held their breath, even, but not a sound came up from the\ndarkness down below.\n\n\"Are they dead, d'you suppose?\" asked Brown.\n\nAnd, even as he asked it, some one in the darkness snuffled, and he\nheard a woman's voice that moaned.\n\n\"Snff-snff-snff! I wonder if I'm dead yet! I wouldn't be, I know, if\nBill were here! He'd ha' got us out!\"\n\n\"There is one of them alive!\" said Juggut Khan.\n\n\"So I notice!\" answered Brown, with a strange dry quaver in his voice.\n\"Go down and bring her up, please! Take three or four men with you. It\nwon't do to bring women and a child up here and let 'em see this awful\nfakir and these corpses. Take your time about bringing 'em up, while\nI make the prisoners carry their dead up on to the roof. I'll take the\nfakir up there too where he's out of mischief!\"\n\nJust as a six-foot-wide pathway ran round and round the outside of the\ndome, another one, scarcely more than a yard wide, ran round the\ninside, and formed a roadway to the top in place of a stair. It took the\nprisoners and Brown's men fifteen minutes of continuous effort to carry\nup the dead and the fakir, and lay them on the roof.\n\n\"Pitch the dead over!\" ordered Brown, and the mutineers obeyed.\n\n\"I've a mind to pitch you over too!\" he growled at the fakir, and the\nstrange creature seemed to understand him, for his eyes changed from\ntheir baleful hatred to a look of fear.\n\nThe bodies slid and rolled down the rounded roof, and fell with a thud\nagainst the battlements, or else went rolling down the circular causeway\nthat led to the street below.\n\nBrown seemed to be garnering ideas from watching them. He gazed down\nat the noisy tumult of the city, watching for a while the efforts of an\nill-directed crowd to put out a fire that blazed in a distant quarter of\nthe bazaar.\n\nThere seemed to him something strangely preconcerted about much of the\nhurrying to and fro below him. It struck him as being far too orderly to\nbe the mere boiling of a loot-crazed mob.\n\nHis prisoners gave the secret to him. They were leaning against the\nparapet on the other side--the side closest to the city-wall, and\nfarthest from the top of the causeway--and they were chattering together\nexcitedly in undertones. Brown walked round to where they stood, and\nstared where they stared. Just as they had done, he recognized what lay\nbelow him.\n\nIt was faintly outlined in the blackness, picked out here and there by\nlanterns, and still too far away for most civilians to name it until\nthe sun rose and showed its detail. But Brown, the soldier, knew on the\ninstant, and so did his men.\n\nSuddenly and unexpectedly and sweetly, like a voice in the night that\nspoke of hope and strength and the rebirth of order out of chaos, a\nbugle gave tongue from where the lanterns swung in straight-kept lines.\n\n\"Oh, Juggut Khan! Oh, Juggut Khan!\"\n\nBill Brown's voice boomed through the opening in the dome, and spread\ndown the walls of the powder-magazine as though in the inside of a\nspeaking-trumpet.\n\n\"Brown sahib?\"\n\n\"The army has got here from the north! It has come down here from\nHarumpore! It's outside the walls now, lying on its arms, and evidently\nwaiting to attack at daylight!\"\n\n\"I, too, have news, Brown sahib! All four are living! All four lie here\non the floor of the magazine, and they recover rapidly. They are all but\nstrong enough to stand.\"\n\n\"Good! Then come up here, Juggut Khan!\"\n\nThat winding pathway up the inside of the dome took longer to negotiate\nthan an ordinary stairway would have done, but presently the Rajput\nleaned against the parapet and panted beside Brown.\n\n\"D'you see them? There they are! Now, look on this side! D'you see the\npreparations going on? D'you realize what the next thing's going to be?\nThey'll come for powder for the guns, so's to have it all ready for the\ngun-crews when the fun begins at dawn! Listen! Here they are already!\"\n\nA thundering had started on the great teak door below--a thundering that\nechoed through the dome like the reverberations of an earthquake. It\nwas punctuated by the screams of women. The prisoners changed their\nattitude, and eyed Brown and the Rajput with an air of truculence again.\n\n\"They'll be up this causeway in a minute, sahib! Listen. There! They've\nseen the dead bodies that you tossed over. Better it had been to keep\nthem up here for a while.\"\n\n\"Never mind! We can hold this causeway until morning! Men! Take\nclose order. Line up at the causeway-entrance. Kneel. Prepare for\nvolley-firing. Now, let 'em come!\"\n\n\"I am for making an immediate escape, sahib!\"\n\n\"Go ahead!\" said Brown, almost dreamily.\n\nHe seemed to be thinking hard on some other subject as he spoke.\n\n\"Sahib, one of the women there--she who is maid to the other two--asked\nme where Bill Brown might be! She swore to me that she had recognized\nhis voice when the trapdoor opened up above her. Are you not Bill\nBrown?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm William Brown!\"\n\n\"Her name, she says, is Emmett!\"\n\n\"You don't surprise me, Juggut Khan! I thought I had recognized her\nvoice. It seemed strangely familiar. Well--here come the rebels up the\ncauseway. See? They're at the bottom now with lanterns! Ready, men!\"\n\nThere came the answering click of breech-bolts, and a little rustling as\neach man eased his position, and laid his elbow on his knee.\n\n\"Can you find your way out through the way we came, Juggut Khan?\"\n\n\"Of course I can!\"\n\n\"Are all the women on the floor?\"\n\n\"Three women and the child.\"\n\n\"Can you close the trap-door again?\"\n\n\"Surely! It is only opening it that is difficult.\"\n\n\"Then close it before you go. I've got a reason! Send one of my men up\nhere with a lantern--one of those that are burning in the magazine. I\nwant to signal.\"\n\n\"Very well, sahib!\"\n\n\"Then take the women, with four of my men to help them walk, and get out\nas quickly as you can by the way we all came in. Wait for the rest of\nmy men when you reach the opening in the outer wall, and when they\nreach you allot two men to carry each woman, and run--the whole lot of\nyou--for the army over yonder. One of the women will object. She will\nwant to see me first. Use force, if necessary!\"\n\n\"Are you, then, not coming, sahib?\"\n\n\"I have another plan. Here they come! Hurry now, be off with the women!\nVolley-firing--ready--present!\"\n\nPattering footsteps sounded on the causeway, and a little crowd of\nnearly doubled figures came up it at a run.\n\n\"Fire!\"\n\nThe volley took the rebels absolutely by surprise, and no man could miss\nhis mark at that short range. Five of the rebels fell back headlong, and\nthe rest, who followed up the causeway, turned on their heels and ran.\n\n\"'Bout turn!\" Brown shouted suddenly. \"Use the steel, men! Use the\nsteel!\"\n\nHis own sword was flashing, and lunging as he spoke, and he had already\nchecked a sudden rush by the prisoners.\n\nThey had thought the moment favorable for joining in the scrimmage from\nthe rear.\n\n\"All right! That'll do them! I'll attend to 'em now!\"\n\nA man came running up with the lantern Brown had asked for, and Brown\ntook it and began waving it above his head.\n\n\"They must have heard that volley!\" he muttered to himself. \"Ah! There's\nthe answer!\"\n\nA red light began to dance over in the British camp, moving up and down\nand sidewise in sudden little jerks. Brown read the jerks, as he could\nnever have read writing, and a moment later he answered them.\n\n\"Now, down below, the lot of you! Give me your rifle, you. I'll need\nit.\"\n\n\"Not coming, sir.\"\n\n\"Not yet. There's something else yet, and I can do it best. Besides,\nsome one has got to guard the causeway still. There might be a rush\nagain at any minute. Listen now. Obey Juggut Khan implicitly as soon as\nyou get down. His orders are my orders. Understand? Very well, then. And\nyou without a weapon, your job is to shut the door that you leave the\nmagazine by tight from the outside--d'you understand me? Call up when\nyou're all through the door, and then shut it tight!\"\n\n\"But, how'll you get out, sir?\"\n\n\"That's my business. One minute, though. Here they come again. Get ready\nto fire another volley!\"\n\nThe mutineers made another and a more determined rush up the causeway,\ncoming up it more than twenty strong, and at the double. Brown let one\nvolley loose in the midst of them, then led his men at the charge down\non them and drove them over the edge of the causeway by dint of sheer\nimpact and cold steel. Not one of them reached the ground alive, and\nin the darkness it must have been impossible for the mutineers below to\ndivine how many were the granary's defenders.\n\n\"That'll keep 'em quiet for a while, I'll wager! Now, quick, you men!\nGet down below, and follow Juggut Khan, and don't forget to shut the\ndoor tight on you. These prisoners here are going to follow you--they\nmay as well go down with you for that matter. No! that won't do. They\ncould open the door below, couldn't they? They'll have to stay up here.\nGot any rope? Then bind them, somebody. Bind their hands and feet. Now,\noff with you!\"\n\nBrown spent the next few minutes signaling with the lantern, and reading\nanswering flashes that zig-zagged in the velvet blackness of the British\nlines. Then, as a voice boomed up through the granary, \"All's well, sir!\nI'm just about to shut the door!\" he fixed his eyes on the fakir, and\nlaughed at him.\n\n\"You and I are going to turn in our accounts of how we've worked out\nthis 'Hookum hai' business, my friend!\" he told him. \"You've given\norders, and I've obeyed orders! We've both accounted for a death or two,\nand we've both accepted responsibility. We're going to know in less than\nfive minutes from now which of us two was justified. There's one thing\nI know, though, without asking. There's one person, and she a woman,\nwho'll weep for me. Will anybody weep for you, I wonder?\"\n\nA lantern waved wildly from the British camp, and Brown seized his own\nlantern and signaled an answer.\n\n\"See that? That's to say, you glassy-eyed horror you, that our mutual\nfriend Juggut Khan has been seen emerging like a rat from a hole in the\nwall. I'll give him and his party one more minute to get clear. Then\nthere's going to be a holocaust, my friend!\"\n\nHe cocked his rifle, and examined the breech-bolt and the foresight\ncarefully. The fakir shuddered, evidently thinking that the charge was\nintended for himself.\n\n\"No! It won't be that way. I know a better! I'm taking a leaf from your\nbook and doing harm by wholesale!\"\n\nBrown leaned down into the opening of the dome, and brought the rifle\nto his shoulder. There was a chorus of yells from the prisoners, and a\nnoise like a wounded horse's scream from the fakir. The rest were bound,\nbut the fakir rose and writhed toward him on his heels, with his sound\narm stretched up in an attitude of despair beside the withered one.\n\nA chorus of bugles burst out from the British camp, and a volley ripped\nthrough the blackness.\n\n\"All right! Here goes!\" said Brown. And he aimed down into the shadowy\npowder-magazine, and pulled the trigger.\n\nTen minutes later, an army three thousand and five hundred strong\nmarched in through the gap made in the outer wall by a granary that had\nspread itself through--and not over--what was in its way. There were\nseventeen tons of powder that responded to the invitation of Brown's\nbullet.\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\nExplosions are among the few things--or the many things, whichever way\nyou like to look at it!--that science can not undertake to harness or\naccount for. When a gun blows up, or a powder-magazine, the shock kills\nwhom it kills, as when a shell bursts in a dense-packed firing-line. You\ncan not kill any man before his time comes, even if a thousand tons of\nsolid masonry combine with you to whelm him, and go hurtling through the\nair with him to absolutely obvious destruction.\n\nThe fakir's time had come, and the prisoners' time had come. But\nSergeant William Brown's had not.\n\nThey found him, blackened by powder, and with every stitch of clothing\nblown from him, clinging to a bunch of lotus-stems in a temple-pond.\nThere was a piece of fakir in the water with him, and about a ton of\nbroken granary, besides the remnants of a rifle and other proof that he\nhad come belched out of a holocaust. The men who came on him had given\ntheir officer the slip, and were bent on a private looting-expedition of\ntheir own. But by the time that they had dragged him from the water, and\nhe had looted them of wherewithal to clothe himself, their thoughts of\nplunder had departed from them. Brown had a way of quite monopolizing\npeople's thoughts!\n\nThere were twenty of them, and he led them all that night, and all\nthrough the morning and the afternoon that followed. He held them\ntogether and worked them and wheeled them and coached and cheered and\ncompelled them through the hell-tumult of the ghastliest thing there is\nbeneath the dome of heaven--house-to-house fighting in an Eastern city.\nAnd at the end of it, when the bugles blew at last \"Cease fire,\"\nand many of the men were marched away by companies to put out the\nconflagrations that were blazing here and there, he led them outside\nthe city-wall, stood them at ease in their own line and saluted their\ncommanding-officer.\n\n\"Twenty men of yours, sir. Present and correct.\"\n\n\"Which twenty?\"\n\n\"Of Mr. Blair's half-company.\"\n\n\"Where's Mr. Blair?\"\n\n\"Dunno, sir!\"\n\n\"Since when have you had charge of them?\"\n\n\"Since they broke into the city yesterday, sir.\"\n\n\"And you haven't lost a man?\"\n\n\"Had lots of luck, sir!\"\n\n\"Who are you, anyway?\"\n\n\"I'm Sergeant Brown, sir.\"\n\n\"Of the Rifles?\"\n\n\"Of the Rifles, sir.\"\n\n\"Were you the man who signaled to us from the magazine and blew it up\nand made the breach in the wall for us to enter by?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Are you alive, or dead? Man or ghost?\"\n\n\"I'm pretty much alive, sir, thank you!\"\n\n\"D'you realize that you made the taking of Jailpore possible? That\nbut for you we'd have been trying still to storm the walls without\nartillery?\"\n\n\"I had the chance, sir, and I only did what any other man would ha' done\nunder like circumstances.\"\n\n\"Go and tell that to the Horse Marines--or, rather, tell it to Colonel\nKendrick! Go and report to him at once. Possibly he'll see it through\nyour eyes!\"\n\nSo Brown marched off to report himself, and he found Colonel Kendrick\nnursing a badly wounded arm before a torn and mud-stained tent.\n\n\"Who are you?\" said the colonel, as Brown saluted him.\n\n\"I'm Sergeant Brown, sir.\"\n\n\"Not Bill Brown of the Rifles?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\n\"You lie! He was blown up on the roof of the powder-magazine! I suppose\nevery man who's gone mad from the heat will be saying that he's Brown!\"\n\n\"I'm Brown, sir! I had written orders from General Baines to enter\nJailpore and rescue three women and a child.\"\n\n\"Where are your orders?\"\n\n\"Lost 'em, sir, in the explosion.\"\n\n\"For a madman, you're a circumstantial liar! What happened to the\nwomen?\"\n\nThe colonel sat back, and smothered an exclamation of agony as the\nnerves in his injured arm tortured him afresh. He had asked a question\nwhich should settle once and for all this man's pretentions, and he\nwaited for the answer with an air of certainty. It was on his lips to\ncall the guard to take the lunatic away.\n\n\"Juggut Khan, the Rajput, took them, with nine of my men, and brought\nthem in to your camp last night, sir. I naturally haven't seen them\nsince.\"\n\n\"Will the women know you?\"\n\n\"One of them will, sir.\"\n\n\"Which one?\"\n\n\"Jane Emmett, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll see!\"\n\nThe colonel called an orderly, and sent the orderly running for Jane\nEmmett. A minute later two strong arms were thrown round Bill Brown from\nbehind, and he was all but carried off his feet.\n\n\"Oh, Bill--Bill--Bill! I knew you'd be all right! Turn round, Bill! Look\nat me!\"\n\nShe was clinging to him in such a manner that he could not turn, but he\nmanaged to pry her hands loose, and to draw her round in front of him.\n\n\"I knew, Bill! I felt sure you'd come! And I recognized your voice the\nminute that the trapdoor opened and I heard it! I did, Bill! I knew you\nin a minute! I didn't worry then! I knew you wouldn't come and talk to\nme as long as there was any duty to be done. I just waited! They said\nyou were killed in the explosion, but I knew you weren't! I knew it! I\ndid! I knew it!\"\n\n\"Face me, please!\" said Colonel Kendrick. \"Now, Jane Emmett, is that man\nSergeant William Brown, of the Rifles?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Is he the man who entered Jailpore with nine men and a Rajput, and came\nto your assistance?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir! He's the same man who spoke in the powder-magazine;\"\n\n\"Do you confirm that?\" he asked Brown.\n\n\"Under favor, sir, my men must be somewhere, if they're not all killed.\nThey'll recognize me. And there's the other lot I led all last night and\nall today. They'll tell you where they found me!\"\n\n\"Never mind! I've decided I believe you! D'you realize that you're\nsomething of a marvel?\"\n\n\"No, sir--except that I've had marvelous luck!\"\n\n\"Well, I shall take great pleasure in mentioning your name in\ndespatches. It will go direct, at first hand, to Her Majesty the Queen!\nThere are few men, let me tell you, Sergeant Brown, who would dare what\nyou dared in the first place. But, more than that, there are even fewer\nmen who would leave a sweetheart in some one else's care while they blew\nup a powder-magazine with themselves on top of it, in order to make\na breach for the army to come in by! My right hand's out of action\nunfortunately--you'll have to shake my left!\"\n\nThe colonel rose, held his uninjured hand out and Brown shook it, since\nhe was ordered to.\n\n\"I consider it an honor and a privilege to have shaken hands with you,\nSergeant Brown!\" said Colonel Kendrick.\n\n\"Thank you, sir!\" said Brown, taking one step back, and then saluting.\n\"May I join my regiment, sir?\"\n\nHe joined his regiment, when he had helped to sort out the bleeding\nremnants of it from among the by-ways and back alleys of Jailpore. And\nthe chaplain married him and Jane Emmett out of hand. He sent her off\nat once with her former mistress to the coast, and marched off with his\nregiment to Delphi. And at Delphi his name was once more mentioned in\ndespatches.\n\nWhen the Mutiny was over, and the country had settled down again to\npeace and reincarnation of a nation had begun, Brown found himself\nhoisted to a civil appointment that was greater and more highly paid\nthan anything his modest soul had ever dreamed of.\n\nHe never understood the reason for it, although he did his fighting-best\nconsistently to fill the job; and he never understood why Queen Victoria\nshould have taken the trouble to write a letter to him in which she\nthanked him personally, nor why they should have singled out for praise\nand special notice a fellow who had merely done his duty.\n\nPerhaps that was the reason why he was such a conspicuous success in\ncivil life. They still talk of how Bill Brown, with Jane his wife and\nJuggut Khan the Rajput to advise him, was Resident Political Adviser to\na Maharajah, and of how the Maharajah loathed him, and looked sidewise\nat him--but obeyed. That, though, is not a war-story. It is a story of\nthe saving of a war, and shall go on record, some day, beneath a title\nof its own.\n\n\n\n\n\nFOR THE SALT HE HAD EATEN\n\n\n\n\nPrologue\n\nTo the northward of Hanadra, blue in the sweltering heat-haze, lay\nSiroeh, walled in with sun-baked mud and listless. Through a wooden gate\nat one end of the village filed a string of women with their water-pots.\nOxen, tethered underneath the thatched eaves or by the thirsty-looking\ntrees, lay chewing the cud, almost too lazy to flick the flies away.\nEven the village goats seemed overcome with lassitude. Here and there\na pariah dog sneaked in and out among the shadows or lay and licked\nhis sores beside an offal-heap; but there seemed to be no energy in\nanything. The bone-dry, hot-weather wind had shriveled up verdure and\nambition together.\n\nBut in the mud-walled cottages, where men were wont to doze through the\nlong, hot days, there were murmurings and restless movement. Men lay\non thong-strung beds, and talked instead of dreaming, and the women\nlistened and said nothing--which is the reverse of custom. Hanadra was\nwhat it always had been, thatched, sun-baked lassitude; but underneath\nthe thatch there thrummed a beehive atmosphere of tension.\n\nIn the center of the village, where the one main road that led from the\nmain gate came to an abrupt end at a low mud wall, stood a house that\nwas larger than the others and somewhat more neatly kept; there had been\nan effort made at sweeping the enclosure that surrounded it on all four\nsides, and there was even whitewash, peeling off in places but still\ncomparatively white, smeared on the sun-cracked walls.\n\nHere, besides murmurings and movement, there was evidence of real\nactivity. Tethered against the wall on one side of the house stood a row\nof horses, saddled and bridled and bearing evidence of having traveled\nthrough the heat; through the open doorway the sunshine glinted on a\nsword-hilt and amid the sound of many voices rang the jingling of a\nspur as some one sat cornerwise on a wooden table and struck his toe\nrestlessly against the leg.\n\nAnother string of women started for the water-hole, with their\npicturesque brass jars perched at varying angles on their heads; and as\neach one passed the doorway of this larger house she turned and scowled.\nA Rajput, lean and black-bearded and swaggering, came to the door and\nwatched them, standing proudly with his arms folded across his breast.\nAs the last woman showed her teeth at him, he laughed aloud.\n\n\"Nay!\" said a voice inside. \"Have done with that! Is noticing the Hindu\nwomen fit sport for a Rajput?\"\n\nThe youngster turned and faced the old, black-bearded veteran who spoke.\n\n\"If I had my way,\" he answered, \"I would ride roughshod through this\nvillage, and fire the thatch. They fail to realize the honor that we pay\nthem by a visit!\"\n\n\"Aye, hothead! And burn thy brother's barn with what is in it! The\nHindus here are many, and we are few, and there will be burnings and\nsaberings a-plenty before a week is past, if I read the signs aright!\nOnce before have I heard such murmurings. Once before I have seen\nchupatties sent from house to house at sunset--and that time blood ran\nred along the roadside for a month to follow! Keep thy sword sharp a\nwhile and wait the day!\"\n\n\"But why,\" growled another deep-throated Rajput voice, \"does the Sirkar\nwait? Why not smite first and swiftly?\"\n\nMahommed Khan moved restlessly and ran his fingers through his beard.\n\n\"I know not!\" he answered. \"In the days when I was Risaldar in the\nRajput Horse, and Bellairs sahib was colonel, things were different! But\nwe conquered, and after conquest came security. The English have grown\noverconfident; they think that Mussulman will always war with Hindu, the\none betraying the other; they will not understand that this lies deeper\nthan jealousy--they will not listen! Six months ago I rode to Jundhra\nand whispered to the general sahib what I thought; but he laughed back\nat me. He said 'Wolf! wolf!' to me and drew me inside his bungalow and\nbade me eat my fill.\"\n\n\"Well--what matters it! This land has always been the playground of new\nconquerors!\"\n\n\"There will be no new conquerors,\" growled the old Risaldar, \"so long as\nI and mine have swords to wield for the Raj!\"\n\n\"But what have the English done for thee or us?\"\n\n\"This, forgetful one! They have treated us with honor, as surely no\nother conquerors had done! At thy age, I too measured my happiness in\ncattle and coin and women, but then came Bellairs sahib, and raised the\nRajput Horse, and I enlisted. What came of that was better than all the\nwealth of Ind!\"\n\nHe spread his long legs like a pair of scissors and caught a child\nbetween them and lifted him.\n\n\"Thou ruffian, thou!\" he chuckled. \"See how he fights! A true Rajput!\nNay, beat me not. Some day thou too shalt bear a sword for England,\ngreat-grandson mine. Ai-ee! But I grow old.\"\n\n\"For England or the next one!\"\n\n\"Nay! But for England!\" said the Risaldar, setting the child down on his\nknee. \"And thou too, hot-head. Before a week is past! Think you I called\nmy sons and grandsons all together for the fun of it? Think you I rode\nhere through the heat because I needed the exercise or to chatter like\nan ape or to stand in the doorway making faces at a Hindu woman or to\nwatch thee do it? Here I am, and here I stay until yet more news comes!\"\n\n\"Then are we to wait here? Are we to swelter in Siroeh, eating up our\nbrother's hospitality, until thy messengers see fit to come and tell us\nthat this scare of thine is past?\"\n\n\"Nay!\" said the Risaldar. \"I said that I wait here! Return now to your\nown homes, each of you. But be in readiness. I am old, but I can ride\nstill. I can round you up. Has any a better horse than mine? If he has,\nlet him make exchange.\"\n\n\"There will be horses for the looting if this revolt of thine breaks\nout!\"\n\n\"True! There will be horses for the looting! Well, I wait here then and,\nwhen the trouble comes, I can count on thirteen of my blood to carry\nswords behind me?\"\n\n\"Aye, when the trouble comes!\"\n\nThere was a chorus of assent, and the Risaldar arose to let his sons and\ngrandsons file past him. He, who had beggared himself to give each one\nof them a start in life, felt a little chagrined that they should now\nrefuse to exchange horses with him; but his eye glistened none the\nless at the sight of their stalwart frames and at the thought of what a\nfighting unit he could bring to serve the Raj.\n\n\"All, then, for England!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Nay, all for thee!\" said his eldest-born. \"We fight on whichever side\nthou sayest!\"\n\n\"Disloyal one!\" growled the Risaldar with a scowl. But he grinned into\nhis beard.\n\n\"Well, to your homes, then--but be ready!\"\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nThe midnight jackals howled their discontent while heat-cracked\nIndia writhed in stuffy torment that was only one degree less than\nunendurable. Through the stillness and the blackness of the night came\nevery now and then the high-pitched undulating wails of women, that no\none answered-for, under that Tophet-lid of blackness, punctured by the\nlow-hung, steel-white stars, men neither knew nor cared whose child had\ndied. Life and hell-hot torture and indifference--all three were one.\n\nThere was no moon, nothing to make the inferno visible, except that here\nand there an oil lamp on some housetop glowed like a blood-spot against\nthe blackness. It was a sensation, rather than sight or sound, that\nbetrayed the neighborhood of thousands upon thousands of human beings,\nsprawling, writhing, twisting upon the roofs, in restless suffering.\n\nThere was no pity in the dry, black vault of heaven, nor in the bone-dry\nearth, nor in the hearts of men, during that hot weather of '57. Men\nwaited for the threatened wrath to come and writhed and held their\ntongues. And while they waited in sullen Asiatic patience, through\nthe restless silence and the smell--the suffocating, spice-fed,\nfilth-begotten smell of India--there ran an undercurrent of even deeper\nmystery than India had ever known.\n\nPriest-ridden Hanadra, that had seen the downfall of a hundred kings,\nwatched through heat-wearied eyes for another whelming the blood-soaked,\nsudden flood that was to burst the dam of servitude and rid India of her\nlatest horde of conquerors. But eight hundred yards from where her high\nbrick walls lifted their age-scars in the stifling reek, gun-chains\njingled in a courtyard, and, sharp-clicking on age-old flagstones, rose\nthe ring of horses' feet.\n\nSection Number One of a troop of Bengal Horse Artillery was waiting\nunder arms. Sabered and grim and ready stood fifty of the finest men\nthat England could produce, each man at his horse's head; and blacker\neven than the night loomed the long twelve-pounders, in tow behind their\nlimbers. Sometimes a trace-chain jingled as a wheel-horse twitched his\nflank; and sometimes a man spoke in a low voice, or a horse stamped\non the pavement; but they seemed like black graven images of war-gods,\nhalf-smothered in the reeking darkness. And above them, from a window\nthat overlooked the courtyard, shone a solitary lamp that glistened here\nand there upon the sleek black guns and flickered on the saber-hilts,\nand deepened the already dead-black atmosphere of mystery.\n\nFrom the room above, where the lamp shone behind gauze curtains came the\nsound of voices; and in the deepest, death-darkest shadow of the door\nbelow there stood a man on guard whose fingers clutched his sword-hilt\nand whose breath came heavily. He stood motionless, save for his\nheaving breast; between his fierce, black mustache and his up-brushed,\ntwo-pointed beard, his white teeth showed through parted lips. But he\ngave no other sign that he was not some Rajput princeling's image carved\nout of the night.\n\nHe was an old man, though, for all his straight back and military\ncarriage. The night concealed his shabbiness; but it failed to hide the\nmedals on his breast, one bronze, one silver, that told of campaigns\nalready a generation gone. And his patience was another sign of age; a\nyounger man of his blood and training would have been pacing to and fro\ninstead of standing still.\n\nHe stood still even when footsteps resounded on the winding stair above\nand a saber-ferrule clanked from step to step. The gunners heard and\nstood squarely to their horses. There was a rustling and a sound of\nshifting feet, and, a \"Whoa,--you!\" to an irritated horse; but the\nRajput stayed motionless until the footsteps reached the door. Then he\ntook one step forward, faced about and saluted.\n\n\"Salaam, Bellairs sahib!\" boomed his deep-throated voice, and Lieutenant\nBellairs stepped back with a start into the doorway again--one hand on\nhis sword-hilt. The Indian moved sidewise to where the lamplight from\nthe room above could fall upon his face.\n\n\"Salaam, Bellairs sahib!\" he boomed again.\n\nThen the lieutenant recognized him.\n\n\"You, Mahommed Khan!\" he exclaimed. \"You old war-dog, what brought you\nhere? Heavens, how you startled me! What good wind brought you?\"\n\n\"Nay! It seems it was an ill wind, sahib!\"\n\n\"What ill wind? I'm glad to see you!\"\n\n\"The breath of rumor, sahib!\"\n\n\"What rumor brought you?\"\n\n\"Where a man's honor lies, there is he, in the hour of danger! Is all\nwell with the Raj, sahib?\"\n\n\"With the Raj? How d'you mean, Risaldar?\"\n\nMahommed Khan pointed to the waiting guns and smiled.\n\n\"In my days, sahib,\" he answered, \"men seldom exercised the guns at\nnight!\"\n\n\"I received orders more than three hours ago to bring my section in to\nJundhra immediately--immediately--and not a word of explanation!\"\n\n\"Orders, sahib? And you wait?\"\n\n\"They seem to have forgotten that I'm married, and by the same token,\nso do you! What else could I do but wait? My wife can't ride with the\nsection; she isn't strong enough, for one thing; and besides, there's\nno knowing what this order means; there might be trouble to face of some\nkind. I've sent into Hanadra to try to drum up an escort for her and I'm\nwaiting here until it comes.\"\n\nThe Risaldar stroked at his beard reflectively.\n\n\"We of the service, sahib,\" he answered, \"obey orders at the gallop when\nthey come. When orders come to ride, we ride!\"'\n\nBellairs winced at the thrust.\n\n\"That's all very fine, Risaldar. But how about my wife? What's going to\nhappen to her, if I leave her here alone and unprotected?\"\n\n\"Or to me, sahib? Is my sword-arm withered? Is my saber rusted home?\"\n\n\"You, old friend! D'you mean to tell me--\"\n\nThe Risaldar saluted him again.\n\n\"Will you stay here and guard her?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib! Being not so young as thou art, I know better!\"\n\n\"What in Tophet do you mean, Mahommed Khan?\"\n\n\"I mean, sahib,\"--the Indian's voice was level and deep, but it vibrated\nstrangely, and his eyes glowed as though war-lights were being born\nagain behind them--\"that not for nothing am I come! I heard what thy\norders were and--\"\n\n\"How did you hear what my orders were?\"\n\n\"My half-brother came hurrying with the news, sahib. I hastened! My\nhorse lies dead one kos from Hanadra here!\"\n\nThe lieutenant laughed.\n\n\"At last, Mahommed? That poor old screw of yours? So he's dead at last,\neh? So his time had come at last!\"\n\n\"We be not all rich men who serve the Raj!\" said the Risaldar with\ndignity. \"Ay, sahib, his time was come! And when our time comes may thou\nand I, sahib, die as he did, with our harness on! What said thy orders,\nsahib? Haste? Then yonder lies the road, through the archway!\"\n\n\"But, tell me, Risaldar, what brought you here in such a hurry?\"\n\n\"A poor old screw, sahib, whose time was come--even as thou hast said!\"\n\n\"Mahommed Khan, I'm sorry--very sorry, if I insulted you! I--I'm\nworried--I didn't stop to think. I--old friend, I--\"\n\n\"It is forgotten, sahib!\"\n\n\"Tell me--what are these rumors you have heard?\"\n\n\"But one rumor, sahib-war! Uprising--revolution--treachery--all India\nwaits the word to rise, sahib!\"\n\n\"You mean--?\"\n\n\"Mutiny among the troops, and revolution north, south, east and west!\"\n\n\"Here, too, in Hanadra?\"\n\n\"Here, too, in Hanadra, sahib! Here they will be among the first to\nrise!\"\n\n\"Oh, come! I can't believe that! How was it that my orders said nothing\nof it then?\"\n\n\"That, sahib, I know not--not having written out thy orders! I heard\nthat thy orders came. I knew, as I have known this year past, what storm\nwas brewing. I knew, too, that the heavenborn, thy wife, is here. I am\nthy servant, sahib, as I was thy father's servant--we serve one Queen;\nthy honor is my honor. Entrust thy memsahib to my keeping!\"\n\n\"You will guard her?\"\n\n\"I will bring her in to Jundhra!\"\n\n\"You alone?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib! I, and my sons, and my sons' sons--thirteen men all told!\"\n\n\"That is good of you, Mahommed Khan. Where are your sons?\"\n\n\"Leagues from here, sahib. I must bring them. I need a horse.\"\n\n\"And while you are gone?\"\n\n\"My half-brother, sahib--he is here for no other purpose--he will answer\nto me for her safety!\"\n\n\"All right, Mahommed Khan, and thank you! Take my second charger, if you\ncare to; he is a little saddle-sore, but your light weight--\"\n\n\"Sahib--listen! Between here and Siroeh, where my eldest-born and his\nthree sons live, lie seven leagues. And on from there to Lungra, where\nthe others live, are three more leagues. I need a horse this night!\"\n\n\"What need of thirteen men, Mahommed? You are sufficient by yourself,\nunless a rebellion breaks out. If it did, why, you and thirteen others\nwould be swamped as surely as you alone!\"\n\n\"Thy father and I, sahib, rode through the guns at Dera thirteen strong!\nAlone, I am an old man--not without honor, but of little use; with\ntwelve young blades behind me, though, these Hindu rabble--\"\n\n\"Do you really mean, Mahommed Khan, that you think Hanadra here will\nrise?\"\n\n\"The moment you are gone, sahib!\"\n\n\"Then, that settles it! The memsahib rides with me!\"\n\n\"Nay, listen, sahib! Of a truth, thou art a hot-head as thy father was\nbefore thee! Thus will it be better. If the heavenborn, thy wife, stays\nbehind, these rabble here will think that the section rides out to\nexercise, because of the great heat of the sun by day; they will watch\nfor its return, and wait for the parking of the guns before they put\ntorch to the mine that they have laid!\"\n\n\"The mine? D'you mean they've--\"\n\n\"Who knows, sahib? But I speak in metaphor. When the guns are parked\nagain and the horses stabled and the men asleep, the rabble, being many,\nmight dare anything!\"\n\n\"You mean, you think that they--\"\n\n\"I mean, sahib, that they will take no chances while they think the guns\nare likely to return!\"\n\n\"But, if I take the memsahib with me?\"\n\n\"They will know then, sahib, that the trap is open and the bird flown!\nKnow you how fast news travels? Faster than the guns, Sahib! There\nwill be an ambuscade, from which neither man, nor gun, nor horse, nor\nmemsahib will escape!\"\n\n\"But if you follow later, it will mean the same thing! When they see you\nride off on a spent horse, with twelve swords and the memsahib--d'you\nmean that they won't ambuscade you?\"\n\n\"They might, sahib--and again, they might not! Thirteen men and a woman\nride faster than a section of artillery, and ride where the guns would\njam hub-high against a tree-trunk! And thy orders, sahib--are thy orders\nnothing?\"\n\n\"Orders! Yes, confound it! But they know I'm married. They know--\"\n\n\"Sahib, listen! When the news came to me I was at Siroeh, dangling a\ngreat-grandson on my knee. There were no orders, but it seemed the Raj\nhad need of me. I rode! Thou, sahib, hast orders. I am here to guard thy\nwife--my honor is thy honor--take thou the guns. Yonder lies the road!\"\n\nThe grim old warrior's voice thrilled with the throb of loyalty, as he\nstood erect and pointed to the shadowy archway through which the road\nwound to the plain beyond.\n\n\"Sahib, I taught thy father how to use his sword! I nursed thee\nwhen thou wert little. Would I give three false counsel now? Ride,\nsahib--ride!\"\n\nBellairs turned away and looked at his charger, a big, brown Khaubuli\nstallion, named for the devil and true in temper and courage to his\nname; two men were holding him, ten paces off.\n\n\"Such a horse I need this night, Sahib! Thy second charger can keep pace\nwith the guns!\"\n\nBellairs gave a sudden order, and the men led the brute back into his\nstable.\n\n\"Change the saddle to my second charger!\" he ordered.\n\nThen he turned to the Risaldar again, with hand outstretched.\n\n\"I'm ashamed of myself, Mahommed Khan!\" he said, with a vain attempt to\nsmile. \"I should have gone an hour ago! Please take my horse Shaitan,\nand make such disposition for my wife's safety as you see fit. Follow as\nand when you can; I trust you, and I shall be grateful to you whatever\nhappens!\"\n\n\"Well spoken, Sahib! I knew thou wert a man! We who serve the Raj have\nneither sons, nor wives, nor sweethearts! Allah guard you, Sahib! The\nsection waits--and the Service can not wait!\"\n\n\"One moment while I tell my wife!\"\n\n\"Halt, Sahib! Thou hast said good-by a thousand times! A woman's\ntears--are they heart-meat for a soldier when the bits are champing?\nNay! See, sahib; they bring thy second charger! Mount! I will bring thy\nwife to Jundhra for thee! The Service waits!\"\n\nThe lieutenant turned and mounted.\n\n\"Very well, Mahommed Khan!\" he said. \"I know you're right! Section!\nPrepare to mount!\" he roared, and the stirrups rang in answer to him.\n\"Mount! Good-by, Mahommed Khan! Good luck to you! Section, right! Trot,\nmarch!\"\n\nWith a crash and the clattering of iron shoes on stone the guns jingled\noff into the darkness, were swallowed by the gaping archway and rattled\nout on the plain.\n\nThe Risaldar stood grimly where he was until the last hoof-beat and bump\nof gun-wheel had died away into the distance; then he turned and climbed\nthe winding stairway to the room where the lamp still shone through\ngauzy curtains.\n\nOn a dozen roof-tops, where men lay still and muttered, brown eyes\nfollowed the movements of the section and teeth that were betel-stained\ngrinned hideously.\n\nFrom a nearby temple, tight-packed between a hundred crowded houses,\ncame a wailing, high-pitched solo sung to Siva--the Destroyer. And as it\ndied down to a quavering finish it was followed by a ghoulish laugh that\nechoed and reechoed off the age-old city-wall.\n\nProud as a Royal Rajput--and there is nothing else on God's green earth\nthat is even half as proud--true to his salt, and stout of heart even\nif he was trembling at the knees, Mahommed Khan, two-medal man and\nRisaldar, knocked twice on the door of Mrs. Lellairs' room, and entered.\n\nAnd away in the distance rose the red reflection of a fire ten leagues\naway. The Mutiny of '57 had blazed out of sullen mystery already, the\nsepoys were burning their barracks half-way on the road to Jundhra!\n\nAnd down below, to the shadow where the Risaldar had stood, crept\na giant of a man who had no military bearing. He listened once, and\nsneaked into the deepest black within the doorway and crouched and\nwaited.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nHanadra reeks of history, blood-soaked and mysterious. Temples piled on\nthe site of olden temples; palaces where half-forgotten kings usurped\nthe thrones of conquerors who came from God knows where to conquer older\nkings; roads built on the bones of conquered armies; houses and palaces\nand subterranean passages that no man living knows the end of and few\neven the beginning. Dark corridors and colonnades and hollow walls;\nroofs that have ears and peep-holes; floors that are undermined by\nsecret stairs; trees that have swayed with the weight of rotting human\nskulls and have shimmered with the silken bannerets of emperors. Such is\nHanadra, half-ruined, and surrounded by a wall that was age-old in the\ndawn of written history.\n\nEven its environs are mysterious; outside the walls, there are carven,\ngloomy palaces that once re-echoed to the tinkle of stringed instruments\nand the love-songs of some sultan's favorite--now fallen into ruins,\nor rebuilt to stable horses or shelter guns and stores and men; but\neloquent in all their new-smeared whitewash, or in crumbling decay, of\nlong-since dead intrigue. No places, those, for strong men to live alone\nin, where night-breezes whisper through forgotten passages and dry teak\nplanking recreaks to the memory of dead men's footsteps.\n\nBut strong men are not the only makings of an Empire, nor yet the only\nsufferers. Wherever the flag of England flies above a distant outpost\nor droops in the stagnant moisture of an Eastern swamp, there are the\ngraves of England's women. The bones that quarreling jackals crunch\namong the tombstones--the peace along the clean-kept borderline--the\npride of race and conquest and the cleaner pride of work well done,\nthese are not man's only. Man does the work, but he is held to it and\ncheered on by the girl who loves him.\n\nAnd so, above a stone-flagged courtyard, in a room that once had echoed\nto the laughter of a sultan's favorite, it happened that an English\ngirl of twenty-one was pacing back and forth. Through the open curtained\nwindow she had seen her husband lead his command out through the echoing\narchway to the plain beyond; she had heard his boyish voice bark out the\ncommand and had listened to the rumble of the gun-wheels dying in the\ndistance--for the last time possibly. She knew, as many an English girl\nhas known, that she was alone, one white woman amid a swarm of sullen\nAryans, and that she must follow along the road the guns had taken,\nserved and protected by nothing more than low-caste natives.\n\nAnd yet she was dry-eyed, and her chin was high; for they are a strange\nbreed, these Anglo-Saxon women who follow the men they love to the\nlonely danger-zone. Ruth Bellairs could have felt no joy in her\nposition; she had heard her husband growling his complaint at being\nforced to leave her, and she guessed what her danger was. Fear must have\nshrunk her heartbeats and loneliness have tried her courage. But there\nwas an ayah in the room with her, a low-caste woman of the conquered\nrace; and pride of country came to her assistance. She was firm-lipped\nand, to outward seeming, brave as she was beautiful.\n\nEven when the door resounded twice to the sharp blow of a saber-hilt,\nand the ayah's pock-marked ebony took on a shade of gray, she stood like\na queen with an army at her back and neither blanched nor trembled.\n\n\"Who is that, ayah?\" she demanded.\n\nThe ayah shrank into herself and showed the whites of her eyes and\ngrinned, as a pariah dog might show its teeth--afraid, but scenting\ncarrion.\n\n\"Go and see!\"\n\nThe ayah shuddered and collapsed, babbling incoherencies and calling on\na horde of long-neglected gods to witness she was innocent. She clutched\nstrangely at her breast and used only one hand to drag her shawl around\nher face. While she babbled she glanced wild-eyed around the long,\nlow-ceilinged room. Ruth Bellairs looked down at her pityingly and went\nto the door herself and opened it.\n\n\"Salaam, memsahib!\" boomed a deep voice from the darkness.\n\nRuth Bellairs started and the ayah screamed.\n\n\"Who are you? Enter--let me see you!\"\n\nA black beard and a turban and the figure of a man--and then white teeth\nand a saber-hilt and eyes that gleamed moved forward from the darkness.\n\n\"It is I, Mahommed Khan!\" boomed the voice again, and the Risaldar\nstepped out into the lamplight and closed the door behind him. Then,\nwith a courtly, long-discarded sweep of his right arm, he saluted.\n\n\"At the heavenborn's service!\"\n\n\"Mahommed Khan! Thank God!\"\n\nThe old man's shabbiness was very obvious as he faced her, with his back\nagainst the iron-studded door; but he stood erect as a man of thirty,\nand his medals and his sword-hilt and his silver scabbard-tip were\nbright.\n\n\"Tell me, Mahommed Khan, you have seen my husband?\"\n\nHe bowed.\n\n\"You have spoken to him?\"\n\nThe old man bowed again.\n\n\"He left you in my keeping, heavenborn. I am to bring you safe to\nJundhra!\"\n\nShe held her hand out and he took it like a cavalier, bending until he\ncould touch her fingers with his lips.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this hurrying of the guns to Jundhra, Risaldar?\"\n\n\"Who knows, memsahib! The orders of the Sirkar come, and we of the\nservice must obey. I am thy servant and the Sirkar's!\"\n\n\"You, old friend--that were servant, as you choose to call it, to my\nhusband's father! I am a proud woman to have such friends at call!\" She\npointed to the ayah, recovering sulkily and rearranging the shawl about\nher shoulders. \"That I call service, Risaldar. She cowers when a knock\ncomes at the door! I need you, and you answer a hardly spoken prayer;\nwhat is friendship, if yours is not?\"\n\nThe Risaldar bowed low again.\n\n\"I would speak with that ayah, heavenborn!\" he muttered, almost into his\nbeard. She could hardly catch the words.\n\n\"I can't get her to speak to me at all tonight, Mahommed Khan. She's\nterrified almost out of her life at something. But perhaps you can do\nbetter. Try. Do you want to question her alone?\"\n\n\"By the heavenborn's favor, yes.\"\n\nRuth walked down the room toward the window, drew the curtain back and\nleaned her head out where whatever breeze there was might fan her cheek.\nThe Risaldar strode over to where the ayah cowered by an inner doorway.\n\n\"She-Hindu-dog!\" he growled at her. \"Mother of whelps! Louse-ridden\nscavenger of sweepings! What part hast thou in all this treachery?\nSpeak!\"\n\nThe ayah shrank away from him and tried to scream, but he gripped her by\nthe throat and shook her.\n\n\"Speak!\" he growled again.\n\nBut his ten iron fingers held her in a vise-like grip and she could not\nhave answered him if she had tried to.\n\n\"O Risaldar!\" called Ruth suddenly, with her head still out of the\nwindow. He released the ayah and let her tumble as she pleased into a\nheap.\n\n\"Heavenborn?\"\n\n\"What is that red glow on the skyline over yonder?\"\n\n\"A burning, heavenborn!\"\n\n\"A burning? What burning? Funeral pyres? It's very big for funeral\npyres!\"\n\n\"Nay, heavenborn!\"\n\n\"What, then?\"\n\nShe was still unfrightened, unsuspicious of the untoward. The Risaldar's\narrival on the scene had quite restored her confidence and she felt\ncontent to ride with him to Jundhra on the morrow.\n\n\"Barracks, heavenborn!\"\n\n\"Barracks? What barracks?\"\n\n\"There is but one barracks between here and Jundhra.\"\n\n\"Then--then--then--what has happened, Mahommed Khan?\"\n\n\"The worst has happened, heavenborn!\"\n\nHe stood between her and the ayah, so that she could not see the woman\nhuddled on the floor.\n\n\"The worst? You mean then--my--my--husband--you don't mean that my\nhusband--\"\n\n\"I mean, heavenborn that there is insurrection! All India is ablaze from\nend to end. These dogs here in Hanadra wait to rise because they think\nthe section will return here in an hour or two; then they propose to\nburn it, men, guns and horses, like snakes in the summer grass. It is\nwell that the section will not return! We will ride out safely before\nmorning!\"\n\n\"And, my husband--he knew--all this--before he left me here?\"\n\n\"Nay! That he did not! Had I told him, he had disobeyed his orders and\nshamed his service; he is young yet, and a hothead! He will be far\nalong the road to Jundhra before he knows what burns. And then he will\nremember that he trusts me and obey orders and press on!\"\n\n\"And you knew and did not tell him!\"\n\n\"Of a truth I knew!\"\n\nShe stood in silence for a moment, gazing at the red glow on the\nskyline, and then turned to read, if she could, what was on the grim,\ngrizzled face of Mahommed Khan.\n\n\"The ayah!\" he growled. \"I have yet to ask questions of the ayah. Have I\npermission to take her to the other room?\"\n\nShe was leaning through the window again and did not answer him.\n\n\"Who's that moving in the shadow down below?\" she asked him suddenly.\n\nHe leaned out beside her and gazed into the shadow. Then he called\nsoftly in a tongue she did not know and some one rose up from the shadow\nand answered him.\n\n\"Are we spied on, Risaldar?\"\n\n\"Nay. Guarded, heavenborn! That man is my half-brother. May I take the\nayah through that doorway?\"\n\n\"Why not question her in here?\"\n\nThe mystery and sense of danger were getting the better of her; she was\nthoroughly afraid now--afraid to be left alone in the room for a minute\neven.\n\n\"There are things she would not answer in thy presence!\"\n\n\"Very well. Only, please be quick!\"\n\nHe bowed. Swinging the door open, he pushed the ayah through it to the\nroom beyond. Ruth was left alone, to watch the red glow on the skyline\nand try to see the outline of the watcher in the gloom below. No sound\ncame through the heavy teak door that the Risaldar had slammed behind\nhim, and no sound came from him who watched; but from the silence of the\nnight outside and from dark corners of the room that she was in and from\nthe roof and walls and floor here came little eerie noises that made her\nflesh creep, as though she were being stared at by eyes she could not\nsee. She felt that she must scream, or die, unless she moved; and she\nwas too afraid to move, and by far too proud to scream! At last she\ntore herself away from the window and ran to a low divan and lay on it,\nsmothering her face among the cushions. It seemed an hour before the\nRisaldar came out again, and then he took her by surprise.\n\n\"Heavenborn!\" he said. She looked up with a start, to find him standing\nclose beside her.\n\n\"Mahommed Khan! You're panting! What ails you?\"\n\n\"The heat, heavenborn--and I am old.\"\n\nHis left hand was on his saber-hilt, thrusting it toward her\nrespectfully; she noticed that it trembled.\n\n\"Have I the heavenborn's leave to lock the ayah in that inner room?\"\n\n\"Why, Risaldar?\"\n\n\"The fiend had this in her possession!\" He showed her a thin-bladed\ndagger with an ivory handle; his own hand shook as he held it out to\nher, and she saw that there were beads of perspiration on his wrist.\n\"She would have killed thee!\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense! Why, she wouldn't dare!\"\n\n\"She confessed before she--she confessed! Have I the heavenborn's\nleave?\"\n\n\"If you wish it.\"\n\n\"And to keep the key?\"\n\n\"I suppose so, if you think it wise.\"\n\nHe strode to the inner door and locked it and hid the key in an inside\npocket of his tunic.\n\n\"And now, heavenborn,\" he said, \"I crave your leave to bring my\nhalf-brother to the presence!\"\n\nHe scarcely waited for an answer, but walked to the window, leaned\nout of it and whistled. A minute later he was answered by the sound of\nfingernails scrabbling on the outer door. He turned the key and opened\nit.\n\n\"Enter!\" he ordered.\n\nBarefooted and ragged, but as clean as a soldier on parade and with huge\nknots of muscles bulging underneath his copper skin, a Rajput entered,\nbowing his six feet of splendid manhood almost to the floor.\n\n\"This, heavenborn, is my half-brother, son of a low-born border-woman,\nwhom my father chose to honor thus far! The dog is loyal!\"\n\n\"Salaam!\" said Ruth, with little interest.\n\n\"Salaam, memsahib!\" muttered the shabby Rajput. \"Does any watch?\"\ndemanded the Risaldar in Hindustanee. \"Aye, one.\"\n\n\"And he?\"\n\n\"Is he of whom I spoke.\"\n\n\"Where watches he?\"\n\n\"There is a hidden passage leading from the archway; he peeps out\nthrough a crack, having rolled back so far the stone that seals it.\" He\nheld his horny fingers about an inch apart to show the distance.\n\n\"Couldst thou approach unseen?\"\n\nThe Rajput nodded.\n\n\"And there are no others there?\"\n\n\"No others.\"\n\n\"Has thy strength left thee, or thy cunning?\"\n\n\"Nay!\"\n\n\"Then bring him!\"\n\nWithout a word in answer the giant turned and went, and the Risaldar\nmade fast the door behind him. Ruth sat with her face between her hands,\ntrying not to cry or shudder, but obsessed and overpowered by a sense\nof terror. The mystery that surrounded her was bad enough; but this\nmysterious ordering and coming to and fro among her friends was worse\nthan horrible. She knew, though, that it would be useless to question\nMahommed Khan before he chose to speak. They waited there in the dimly\nlighted room for what seemed tike an age again; she, pale and tortured\nby weird imaginings; he, grim and bolt-upright like a statue of a\nwarrior. Then sounds came from the stairs again and the Risaldar hurried\nto the door and opened it.\n\nIn burst the Risaldar's half-brother, breathing heavily and bearing a\nload nearly as big as he was.\n\n\"The pig caught my wrist within the opening!\" he growled, tossing his\ngagged and pinioned burden on the floor. \"See where he all but broke\nit!\"\n\n\"What is thy wrist to the service of the Raj? Is he the right one?\"\n\n\"Aye!\" He stooped and tore a twisted loin-cloth from his victim's face,\nand the Risaldar walked to the lamp and brought it, to hold it above the\nprostrate form. Ruth left the divan and stood between the men, terrified\nby she knew not what fear, but drawn into the lamplight by insuperable\ncuriosity.\n\n\"This, heavenborn,\" said the Risaldar, prodding at the man with his\nscabbard-point, \"is none other than the High Priest of Kharvani's temple\nhere, the arch-ringleader in all the treachery afoot--now hostage for\nthy safety!\"\n\nHe turned to his half-brother. \"Unbind the thing he lies with!\" he\ncommanded, and the giant unwrapped a twisted piece of linen from the\nHigh Priest's mouth.\n\n\"So the big fox peeped through the trapdoor, because he feared to\ntrust the other foxes; and the big fox fell into the trap!\" grinned the\nRisaldar. \"Bring me that table over yonder, thou!\"\n\nThe half-brother did as he was told.\n\n\"Lay it here, legs upward, on the floor.\n\n\"Now, bind him to it--an arm to a leg and a leg to a leg.\n\n\"Remove his shoes.\n\n\"Put charcoal in yon brazier. Light it. Bring it hither!\"\n\nHe seized a brass tongs, chose a glowing coal and held it six inches\nfrom the High Priest's naked foot.\n\nRuth screamed.\n\n\"Courage, heavenborn! Have courage! This is naught to what he would have\ndone to thee!... Now, speak, thou priest of infidels! What plans are\nlaid and who will rise and when?\"\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\"Sergeant!\"\n\n\"Sir!\"\n\nThe close-cropped, pipe-clayed non-commissioned officer spurred his\nhorse into a canter until his scabbard clattered at young Bellairs'\nboot. Nothing but the rattling and the jolting of the guns and\nammunition-wagon was audible, except just on ahead of them the\nclick-clack, click-click-clack of the advance-guard. To the right and\nleft of them the shadowy forms of giant banian-trees loomed and slid\npast them as they had done for the past four hours, and for ten paces\nahead they could see the faintly outlined shape of the trunk road that\nthey followed. The rest was silence and a pall of blackness obscuring\neverything. They had ridden along a valley, but they had emerged on\nrising ground and there was one spot of color in the pall now, or else a\nhole in it.\n\n\"What d'you suppose that is burning over there?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say, sir.\"\n\n\"How far away is it?\"\n\n\"Very hard to tell on a night like this, sir. It might be ten miles\naway and might be twenty. By my reckoning it's on our road, though, and\nsomewhere between here and Jundhra.\"\n\n\"So it seems to me; our road swings round to the right presently,\ndoesn't it? That'll lead us right to it. That would make it Doonha more\nor less. D'you suppose it's at Doonha?\"\n\n\"I was thinking it might be, sir. If it's Doonha, it means that the\nsepoy barracks and all the stores are burning--there's nothing else\nthere that would make all that flame!\"\n\n\"There are two companies of the Thirty-third there, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but they're under canvas; tents would blaze up, but they'd\ndie down again in a minute. That fire's steady and growing bigger!\"\n\n\"It's the sepoy barracks, then!\"\n\n\"Seems so to me, sir!\"\n\n\"Halt!\" roared Bellairs. The advance-guard kicked up a little shower\nof sparks, trace-chains slacked with a jingle and the jolting ceased.\nBellairs rode up to the advance-guard.\n\n\"Now, Sergeant,\" he ordered, \"it looks as though that were the Doonha\nbarracks burning over yonder. There's no knowing, though, what it is.\nSend four men on, two hundred yards ahead of you, and you and the rest\nkeep a good two hundred yards ahead of the guns. See that the men keep\non the alert, and mind that they spare their horses as much as possible.\nIf there's going to be trouble, we may just as well be ready for it!\"\n\n\"Very good, sir!\"\n\n\"Go ahead, then!\"\n\nAt a word from the sergeant, four men clattered off and were swallowed\nin the darkness. A minute later the advance-guard followed them and\nthen, after another minute's pause, young Bellairs' voice was raised\ninto a ringing shout again.\n\n\"Section, advance! Trot, march!\"\n\nThe trace-chains tightened, and the clattering, bumping, jingling\nprocession began again, its rear brought up by the six-horse\nammunition-wagon. They rode speechless for the best part of an hour,\neach man's eyes on the distant conflagration that had begun now to light\nup the whole of the sky ahead of them. They still rode in darkness, but\nthey seemed to be approaching the red rim of the Pit. Huge, billowing\nclouds of smoke, red-lit on the under side, belched upward to the\nblackness overhead, and a something that was scarcely sound--for it was\nyet too distant--warned them that it was no illusion they were riding\ninto. The conflagration grew. It seemed to be nearly white-hot down\nbelow.\n\nBellairs wet his finger and held it extended upward.\n\n\"There's no wind that I can feel!\" he muttered. \"And yet, if that were\na grass-fire, there'd be game and rats and birds and things--some of 'em\nwould bolt this way. That's the Doonha barracks burning or I'm a black\nman, which the Lord forbid!\"\n\nA minute later, every man in the section pricked up his ears. There\nwas no order given; but a sensation ran the whole length of it and a\nmovement from easy riding to tense rigidity that could be felt by some\nsixth sense. Every man was listening, feeling, groping with his senses\nfor something he could neither hear as yet nor see, but that he knew was\nthere. And then, far-distant yet--not above, but under the jolting of\nthe gun-wheels and the rattle of the scabbards--they could hear the\nclickety-clickety-clickety-click of a horse hard-ridden.\n\nThey had scarcely caught that sound, they had barely tightened up their\nbridle-reins, when another sound, one just as unmistakable, burst out in\nfront of them. A ragged, ill-timed volley ripped out from somewhere\nnear the conflagration and was answered instantly by one that was\nclose-ripped like the fire of heavy ordnance. And then one of the\nadvance-guard wheeled his horse and drove his spurs home rowel-deep. He\ncame thundering back along the road with his scabbard out in the wind\nbehind him and reined up suddenly when his horse's forefeet were abreast\nof the lieutenant.\n\n\"There's some one coming, sir, hard as he can gallop! He's one of our\nmen by the sound of him. His horse is shod--and I thought I saw steel\nwhen the fire-light fell on him a minute ago!\"\n\n\"Are you sure there's only one?\"\n\n\"Sure, sir! You can hear him now!\"\n\n\"All right! Fall in behind me!\"\n\nBellairs felt his sword-hilt and cocked a pistol stealthily, but he gave\nno orders to the section. This might be a native soldier run amuck, and\nit might be a messenger; but in either case, friend or foe, if there was\nonly one man he could deal with him alone.\n\n\"Halt!\" roared the advance-guard suddenly. But the horse's hoof-beats\nnever checked for a single instant.\n\n\"Halt, you! Who comes there?\"\n\n\"Friend!\" came the answer, in an accent that was unmistakable.\n\n\"What friend? Where are you going?\"\n\nOne of the advance-guard reined his horse across the road. The others\nfollowed suit and blocked the way effectually. \"Halt!\" they roared in\nunison.\n\nThe main body of the advance came up with them.\n\n\"Who is he?\" shouted the sergeant.\n\n\"We'll soon see! Here he comes!\"\n\n\"Out of my way!\" yelled a voice, as a foamed-flecked horse burst out of\nthe darkness like an apparition and bore straight down on them--his head\nbored a little to one side, the red rims of his nostrils wide distended\nand his whole sense and energy, and strength concentrated on pleasing\nthe speed-hungry Irishman who rode him. He flashed into them head-on,\nlike a devil from the outer darkness. His head touched a man's knee--and\nhe rose and tried to jump him! His breast crashed full into the\nobstruction and horse and gunner crashed down to the road.\n\nA dozen arms reached out--twelve horses surged in a clattering\nmelee--two hands gripped the reins and four arms seized the rider,\nand in a second the panting charger was brought up all-standing. The\nsergeant thrust his grim face closer and peered at their capture.\n\n\"Good--, if it ain't an officer!\" he exclaimed. \"I beg your pardon,\nsir!\"\n\nAnd at that instant the section rattled, up behind them, with Bellairs\nin the lead.\n\n\"Halt!\" roared Bellairs. \"What's this?\"\n\n\"Bloody murder, arson, high treason, mutiny and death! Blood and onions,\nman! Don't your men know an officer when they see one? Who are you? Are\nyou Bellairs? Then why in God's name didn't you say so sooner? What have\nyou waited for?\n\n\"How many hours is it since you got the message through from Jundhra?\nCouldn't you see the barracks burning? Who am I--I'm Captain O'Rourke,\nof the Thirty-third, sent to see what you're doing on the road, that's\nwho I am! A full-fledged; able-bodied captain wasted in a crisis, just\nbecause you didn't choose to hurry! Poison take your confounded gunners,\nsir! Have they nothing better to engage them than holding up officers on\nthe Queen's trunk road?\"\n\n\"Supposing you tell me what's the matter?\" suggested young Bellairs,\nprompt as are most of his breed to appear casual the moment there was\ncause to feel excited.\n\n\"Your gunners have taken all my breath, sir. I can't speak!\"\n\n\"You shouldn't take chances with a section of artillery! They're not\nlike infantry--they don't sleep all the time--you can't ride through\nthem as a rule!\"\n\n\"Don't sleep, don't they! Then what have you been doing on the road? And\nwhat are you standing here for? Ride, man, ride! You're wanted!\"\n\n\"Get out of the way, then!\" suggested Bellairs, and Captain O'Rourke\nlegged his panting charger over to the roadside.\n\n\"Advance-guard, forward, trot!\" commanded the lieutenant.\n\n\"Have you brought your wife with you?\" demanded O'Rourke, peering into\nthe jingling blackness.\n\n\"No. Of course not. Why?\"\n\n\"'Of course not! Why?' says the man! Hell and hot porridge! Why, the\nwhole of India's ablaze from end to end--the sepoys have mutinied to a\nman, and the rest have joined them! There's bloody murder doing--they've\nshot their officers--Hammond's dead and Carstairs and Welfleet and\nheaven knows who else. They've burned their barracks and the stores and\nthey're trying to seize the magazine. If they get that, God help every\none. They're short of ammunition as it is, but two companies of the\nThirty-third can't hold out for long against that horde. You'll be in\nthe nick of time! Hurry, man! For the love of anything you like to name,\nget a move on!\"\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\"Trot, march!\n\n\"Canter!\"\n\nBellairs was thinking of his wife, alone in Hanadra, unprotected except\nby a sixty-year-old Risaldar and a half-brother who was a civilian and\nan unknown quantity. There were cold chills running down his spine and\na sickening sensation in his stomach. He rode ahead of the guns, with\nO'Rourke keeping pace beside him. He felt that he hated O'Rourke, hated\neverything, hated the Service, and the country--and the guns, that could\nput him into such a fiendish predicament.\n\nO'Rourke broke silence first.\n\n\"Who is with your wife?\" he demanded suddenly.\n\n\"Heaven knows! I left her under the protection of Risaldar Mahommed\nKhan, but he was to ride off for an escort for her.\"\n\n\"Not your father's old Risaldar?\" asked O'Rourke.\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"Then thank God! I'd sooner trust him than I would a regiment. He'll\nbring her in alive or slit the throats of half Asia--maybe 'he'll do\nboth! Come, that's off our minds! She's safer with him than she would be\nhere. Have you lots of ammunition?\"\n\n\"I brought all I had with me at Hanadra.\"\n\n\"Good! What you'll need tonight is grape!\"\n\n\"I've lots of it. It's nearly all grape.\"\n\n\"Hurrah! Then we'll treat those dirty mutineers to a dose or two of\npills they won't fancy! Come on, man--set the pace a little faster!\"\n\n\"Why didn't my orders say anything about a mutiny or bringing in my\nwife?\"\n\n\"Dunno! I didn't write 'em. I can guess, though. There'd be something\nlike nine reasons. For one thing, they'd credit you with sense enough to\nbring her in without being told. For another, the messenger who took the\nnote might have got captured on the way--they wouldn't want to tell\nthe sepoys more than they could help. Then there'd be something like a\nhurry. They're attacked there too--can't even send us assistance. Told\nus to waylay you and make use of you. Maybe they forgot your wife--maybe\nthey didn't. It's a devil of a business anyhow!\"\n\nIt was difficult to talk at the speed that they were making, with their\nown horses breathing heavily, O'Rourke's especially; the guns thundering\nalong behind them and the advance-guard clattering in front, and their\nattention distracted every other minute by the noise of volleys on ahead\nand the occasional staccato rattle of independent firing. The whole\nsky was now alight with the reflection of the burning barracks and they\ncould see the ragged outlines of the cracking walls silhouetted against\nthe blazing red within. One mile or less from the burning buildings they\ncould see, too, the occasional flash of rifles where the two companies\nof the Thirty-third, Honorable East India Company's Light Infantry, held\nout against the mutineers.\n\n\"Why did they mutiny?\" asked Bellairs.\n\n\"God knows! Nobody knows! Nobody knows anything! I'm thinking--\"\n\n\"Thinking what?\"\n\n\"Forrester-Carter is commanding. We'll settle this business pretty\nquickly, now you've come. Then--Steady, boy! Steady! Hold up! This poor\nhorse of mine is just about foundered, by the feel of him. He'll reach\nDoonha, though. Then we'll ask Carter to make a dash on Hanadra and\nbring Mrs. Bellairs--maybe we'll meet her and the Risaldar half-way--who\nknows? The sepoys wouldn't expect that, either. The move'd puzzle\n'em--it'd be a good move, to my way of thinking.\"\n\n\"Let's hope Carter will consent!\" prayed Bellairs fervently. \"Now,\nwhat's the lay of things?\"\n\n\"Couldn't tell you! When I left, our men were surrounded. I had to burst\nthrough the enemy to get away. Ours are all around the magazine and\nthe sepoys are on every side of them. You'll have to use diagonal fire\nunless you want to hurt some of our chaps--sweep 'em cornerwise. There's\nhigh ground over to the right there, within four hundred yards of the\nposition. Maybe they're holding it, though--there's no knowing!\"\n\nThey could hear the roar of the flames now, and could see the figures\nof sepoys running here and there. The rattle of musketry was incessant.\nThey could hear howls and yells and bugle-calls blown at random by the\nsepoys, and once, in answer as it seemed to a more than usually savage\nchorus from the enemy--a chorus that was punctuated by a raging din of\nintermittent rifle-fire--a ringing cheer.\n\n\"They must be in a tight hole!\" muttered Bellairs. \"Answer that, men!\nAll together, now! Let 'em know we're coming.\"\n\nThe men rose in their stirrups all together, and sent roaring through\nthe blackness the deep-throated \"Hip-hip-hur-r-a-a-a-a-a!\" that has\ngladdened more than one beleaguered British force in the course of\nhistory. It is quite different from the \"Hur-o-a-o-a-u-r-rh\" of a\nforlorn hope, or the high-pitched note of pleasure that signals the end\nof a review. It means \"Hold on, till we get there, boys!\" and it carries\nits meaning, clear and crisp and unmistakable, in its note.\n\nThe two beleaguered companies heard it and answered promptly with\nanother cheer.\n\n\"By gad, they must be in a hole!\" remarked Bellairs.\n\nBritish soldiers do not cheer like that, all together, unless there is\nvery good reason to feel cheerless. They fight, each man according to\nhis temperament, swearing or laughing, sobbing or singing comic songs,\nuntil the case looks grim. Then, though, the same thrill runs through\nthe whole of them, the same fire blazes in their eyes, and the last\nditch that they line has been known to be a grave for the enemy.\n\n\"Trumpeter! Sound close-order!\"\n\nThe trumpet rang. The advance-guard drew rein for the section to catch\nup. The guns drew abreast of one another and the mounted gunners formed\nin a line, two deep, in front of them. The ammunition-wagon trailed like\na tail behind.\n\n\"That high ground over there, I think!\" suggested O'Rourke.\n\n\"Thank you, sir. Section, right! Trot, march! Canter!\"\n\nCrash went the guns and the following wagon across the roadside ditch.\nThe tired horses came up to the collar as service-horses always will,\ngenerous to the last ounce of strength they have in them.\n\n\"Gallop!\"\n\nThe limbers bumped and jolted and the short-handled whips cracked like\nthe sound of pistol-practise. Blind, unreconnoitered, grim--like a black\nthunderbolt loosed into the blackness--the two guns shot along a\nhollow, thundered up a ridge and burst into the fire-light up above the\nmutineers, in the last place where any one expected them. A howl came\nfrom the road that they had left, a hundred sepoys had rushed down to\nblock their passage the moment that their cheer had rung above the noise\nof battle.\n\n\"Action--front!\" roared young Bellairs, and the muzzles swung round at\nthe gallop, jerked into position by the wheeling teams.\n\n\"With case, at four hundred!\"\n\nThe orders were given and obeyed almost before the guns had lost their\nmotion. The charges had been rammed into the greedy muzzles before the\nhorses were away, almost--and that takes but a second--the horses vanish\nlike blown smoke when the game begins. A howl from the mutineers told\nthat they were seen; a volley from the British infantry announced that\nthey were yet in time; and \"boom-boom!\" went both guns together.\n\nThe grapeshot whined and shrieked, and the ranks of the sepoys wilted,\nmown down as though a scythe had swept them. Once, and once only, they\ngathered for a charge on the two guns; but they were met half-way up the\nrise by a shrieking blast of grape that ripped through them and took the\nheart out of them; and the grape was followed by well-aimed volleys from\nbehind. Then they drew off to sulk and make fresh plans at a distance,\nand Bellairs took his section unmolested into the Thirty-third-lined\nrampart round the magazine.\n\n\"What kept you, sir?\" demanded Colonel Forrester-Carter, nodding to him\nin answer to his salute and holding out his right arm while a sergeant\nbandaged it.\n\n\"My wife, sir--I--\"\n\n\"Where is she? Didn't you bring her?\"\n\n\"No, sir--I--\"\n\n\"Where is she?\"\n\n\"Still at Hanadra, sir--I--\"\n\n\"Let the men fall in! Call the roll at once!\"\n\n\"There was nothing in my orders, sir, about--\" But Colonel Carter cut\nhim short with a motion and turned his back on him.\n\n\"Much obliged, Sergeant,\" he said, slipping his wounded arm into an\nimprovised sling. \"How many wagons have we here?\"\n\n\"Four, sir.\"\n\n\"And horses?\"\n\n\"All shot dead except your charger, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh! Ask Captain Trevor to come here.\"\n\nThe sergeant disappeared into the shadows, and a moment later Captain\nTrevor came running up and saluted.\n\n\"There are seven wounded, sir, and nineteen dead,\" he reported.\n\n\"Better than I had hoped, Trevor! Will you set a train to that magazine,\nplease, and blow it up the moment we are at a safe distance?\"\n\nTrevor seemed surprised, but he saluted and said nothing.\n\n\"O'Rourke! Please see about burying the dead at once. Mr. Bellairs, let\nme have two horses, please, and their drivers, from each gun. Sergeant!\nSee about putting the wounded into the lightest of the wagons and\nharness in four gun-horses the best way you can manage.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Which is your best horseman, Mr. Bellairs? Is his horse comparatively\nfresh? I'll need him to gallop with a message. I'll dictate it to\nCaptain O'Rourke as soon as he is ready. Let the gunner stay here close\nto me.\"\n\nBellairs sought out his best man and the freshest-seeming horse in\nwondering silence. He felt sick with anxiety, for what could one lone\nveteran Risaldar do to protect Mrs. Bellairs against such a horde as\nwas in Hanadra? He looked at the barracks, which were still blazing\nheavenward and illuminating the whole country-side, and shuddered as he\nwondered whether his quarters at Hanadra were in flames yet.\n\n\"It's a good job old Carter happened to be here!\" he heard one of his\nmen mumble to another. \"He's a man, that is--I'd sooner fight under him\nthan any I know of!\"\n\n\"What d'you suppose the next move is?\" asked the other man.\n\n\"I'd bet on it! I'll bet you what you like that--\"\n\nBut Bellairs did not hear the rest.\n\nA bugle rang out into the night. The gunners stood by their horses. Even\nthe sentries, posted outside the rampart to guard against alarm, stood\nto attention, and Colonel Carter, wincing from the pain in his right\narm, walked out in front of where the men were lined up.\n\nCaptain O'Rourke walked up and saluted him.\n\n\"I've arranged to bury them in that trench we dug this evening, sir,\nwhen the trouble started. It's not very deep, but it holds them all.\nI've laid them in it.\"\n\n\"Are you sure they're all dead?\"\n\n\"I've burnt their fingers with matches, sir. I don't know of any better\nway to make sure.\"\n\n\"Very well. Can you remember any of the burial service?\"\n\n\"'Fraid not, sir.\"\n\n\"Um! That's a pity. And I'm afraid I can't spare the time. Take a\nfiring-party, Captain O'Rourke, and give them the last honors, at all\nevents.\"\n\nA party marched away toward the trench, and several minutes later\nO'Rourke's voice was heard calling through the darkness, \"All ready,\nsir!\"\n\n\"Present arms!\" ordered the colonel, and the gunners sat their horses\nwith their hilts raised to their hips and the two long lines of infantry\nstood rigid at the general salute, while five volleys--bulleted--barked\nupward above the grave. They were, answered by sniping from the\nmutineers, who imagined that reprisals had commenced.\n\n\"Now, men!\" said Colonel Carter, raising his voice until every officer\nand man along the line could hear him, \"as you must have realized,\nthings are very serious indeed. We are cut off from support, but now\nthat the guns are here to help us, we could either hold out here until\nrelieved or else fight our way into Jundhra, where I have no doubt we\nare very badly needed. But\"--he spoke more slowly and distinctly now,\nwith a distinct pause between each word--\"there is an officer's lady\nalone, and practically unprotected at Hanadra. Our duty is clear. You\nare tired--I know it. You have had no supper, and will get none. It\nmeans forced marching for the rest of this night and a good part of\ntomorrow and more fighting, possibly on an empty stomach; it means the\ndust and the heat and the discomfort of the trunk road for all of us and\ndanger of the worst kind instead of safety--for we shall have farther to\ngo to reach Jundhra. But I would do the same, and you men all know it,\nfor any soldier's wife in my command, or any English woman in India. We\nwill march now on Hanadra. No! No demonstrations, please!\"\n\nHis uplifted left hand was just in time to check a roar of answering\napproval.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you so?\" exclaimed a gunner to the man beside him in an\nundertone. \"Him leave a white woman to face this sort o' music? He'd\nfight all India first!\"\n\nTen minutes later two companies of men marched out behind the guns,\nfollowed by a cart that bore their wounded. As they reached the trunk\nroad they were saluted by a reverberating blast when the magazine that\nthey had fought to hold blew skyward. They turned to cheer the explosion\nand then settled down to march in deadly earnest and, if need be, to\nfight a rear-guard action all the way.\n\nAnd in the opposite direction one solitary gunner rode,\nhell-bent-for-leather, with a note addressed to \"O. C.--Jundhra.\" It was\nshort and to the point. It ran:\n\n        Have blown up magazine;  Mrs. Bellairs at Hanadra;\n        have gone to rescue her.\n                (Signed)  A. FORRESTER-CARTER (Col.)\n                        per J. O'Rourke\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nThe red glow of barracks burning--an ayah from whom a dagger has\nbeen taken locked in another room--the knowledge that there are fifty\nthousand Aryan brothers, itching to rebel, within a stone's throw--and\ntwo lone protectors of an alien race intent on torturing a High Priest,\neach and every one of these is a disturbing feature. No woman, and least\nof all a young woman such as Ruth Bellairs, can be blamed for being\nnervous under the stress of such conditions or for displaying a certain\namount of feminine unreasonableness.\n\nShe stood shivering for a minute and watched spellbound while Mahommed\nKhan held the hot coal closer and even closer to the High Priest's naked\nfoot. The priest writhed in anticipation of the agony and turned his\neyes away, and as he turned them they met Ruth's. High priests of a\nreligion that includes sooth-saying and prophecy and bribery of gods\namong its rites are students of human nature, and especially of female\nhuman nature. Knowledge of it and of how it may be gulled, and when,\nis the first essential of their calling. Her pale face, her blue eyes\nstrained in terror, the parted lips and the attitude of tension, these\ngave him an idea. Before the charcoal touched him, he screamed--screamed\nlike a wounded horse.\n\n\"Mahommed Khan, stop! Stop this instant! I won't have it! I won't have\nmy life, even, on those terms! D'you hear me, sir!\"\n\n\"Have courage, heavenborn! There is but one way to force a Hindu priest,\nunless it be by cutting off his revenues--he must be hurt! This dog is\nunhurt as yet--see! The fire has not yet touched his foot!\"\n\n\"Don't let it, Mahommed Khan! Set that iron down! This is my room. I\nwill not have crime committed here!\"\n\n\"And how long does the heavenborn think it would be her room were this\nevil-living pig of a priest at large, or how long before a worse crime\nwere committed? Heavenborn, the hour is late and the charcoal dies out\nrapidly when it has left the fire! See. I must choose another piece!\"\n\nHe rummaged in the brazier, and she screamed again.\n\n\"I will not have it, Risaldar! You must find another way.\"\n\n\"Memsahib! Thy husband left thee in my care. Surely it is my right to\nchoose the way?\"\n\n\"Leave me, then! I relieve you of your trust. I will not have him\ntortured in my room, or anywhere!\"\n\nMahommed Khan bowed low.\n\n\"Under favor, heavenborn,\" he answered, \"my trust is to your husband. I\ncan be released by him, or by death, not otherwise.\"\n\n\"Once, and for all, Mahommed Khan, I will not have you torture him in\nhere!\"\n\n\"Memsahib, I have yet to ride for succor! At daybreak, when these Hindus\nlearn that the guns will not come back, they will rise to a man. Even\nnow we must find a hiding-place or--it is not good even to think what I\nmight find on my return!\"\n\nHe leaned over the priest again, but without the charcoal this time.\n\n\"Speak, thou!\" he ordered, growling in Hindustanee through his savage\nblack mustache. \"I have yet to hear what price a Hindu sets on immunity\nfrom torture!\"\n\nBut the priest, it seemed, had formed a new idea. He had been looking\nthrough puckered eyes at Ruth, keen, cool calculation in his glance, and\nin spite of the discomfort of his strained position he contrived to nod.\n\n\"Kharvani!\" he muttered, half aloud.\n\n\"Aye! Call on Kharvani!\" sneered the Risaldar. \"Perhaps the Bride of\nSivi will appear! Call louder!\"\n\nHe stirred again among the charcoal with his tongs, and Ruth and the\nHigh Priest both shuddered.\n\n\"Look!\" said the High Priest in Hindustanee, nodding in Ruth's\ndirection. It was the first word that he had addressed to them. It\ntook them by surprise, and the Risaldar and his half-brother turned and\nlooked. Their breath left them.\n\nFramed in the yellow lamplight, her thin, hot-weather garments draped\nabout her like a morning mist, Ruth stood and stared straight back at\nthem through frightened eyes. Her blue-black hair, which had become\nloosened in her excitement, hung in a long plait over one shoulder and\ngleamed in the lamp's reflection. Her skin took on a faintly golden\ncolor from the feeble light, and her face seemed stamped with fear,\nanxiety, pity and suffering, all at once, that strangely enhanced her\nbeauty, silhouetted as she was against the blackness of the wall behind,\nshe seemed to be standing in an aura, shimmering with radiated light.\n\n\"Kharvani!\" said the High Priest to himself again, and the two Rajputs\nstood still like men dumfounded, and stared and stared and stared.\nThey knew Kharvani's temple. Who was there in Hanadra, Christian or\nMohammedan or Hindu, who did not? The show-building of the city, the\nancient, gloomy, wonderful erection where bats lived in the dome and\nflitted round Kharvani's image, the place where every one must go who\nneeded favors of the priests, the central hub of treason and intrigue,\nwhere every plot was hatched and every rumor had its origin--the\nultimate, mazy, greedy, undisgorging goal of every bribe and every\nblackmail-wrung rupee!\n\nThey knew, too, as every one must know who has ever been inside the\nplace, the amazing, awe-inspiring picture of Kharvani painted on the\ninner wall; of Kharvani as she was idealized in the days when priests\nbelieved in her and artists thought the labor of a lifetime well\nemployed in painting but one picture of her--Kharvani the sorrowful,\ngrieving for the wickedness of earth; Kharvani, Bride of Siva, ready to\nintercede with Siva, the Destroyer, for the helpless, foolish, purblind\nsons of man.\n\nAnd here, before them, stood Kharvani--to the life!\n\n\"What of Kharvani?\" growled Mahommed Khan.\n\n\"'A purblind fool, a sot and a Mohammedan,\"' quoted the priest\nmaliciously, \"'how many be they, three or one?'\"\n\nThe Risaldar's hand went to his scabbard. His sword licked out free and\ntrembled like a tuning-fork. He flicked with his thumbnail at the blade\nand muttered: \"Sharp! Sharp as death itself!\"\n\nThe Hindu grinned, but the blade came down slowly until the point of it\nrested on the bridge of his nose. His eyes squinted inward, watching it.\n\n\"Now, make thy gentle joke again!\" growled the Risaldar. Ruth Bellairs\nchecked a scream.\n\n\"No blood!\" she exclaimed. \"Don't hurt him, Risaldar! I'll not have you\nkill a man in here--or anywhere, in cold blood, for that matter! Return\nyour sword, sir!\"\n\nThe Risaldar swore into his beard. The High Priest grinned again. \"I am\nnot afraid to die!\" he sneered. \"Thrust with that toy of thine! Thrust\nhome and make an end!\"\n\n\"Memsahib!\" said the Risaldar, \"all this is foolishness and waste\nof time! The hour is past midnight and I must be going. Leave the\nroom--leave me and my half-brother with this priest for five short\nminutes and we will coax from him the secret of some hiding-place where\nyou may lie hid until I come!\"\n\n\"But you'll hurt him!\"\n\n\"Not if he speaks, and speaks the truth!\"\n\n\"Promise me!\"\n\n\"On those conditions--yes!\"\n\n\"Where shall I go?\"\n\nThe Risaldar's eyes glanced toward the door of the inner room, but he\nhesitated. \"Nay! There is the ayah!\" he muttered. \"Is there no other\nroom?\"\n\n\"No, Risaldar, no other room except through that door. Besides, I would\nrather stay here! I am afraid of what you may do to that priest if I\nleave you alone with him!\"\n\n\"Now a murrain on all women, black and white!\" swore Mahommed Khan\nbeneath his breath. Then he turned on the priest again, and placed one\nfoot on his stomach.\n\n\"Speak!\" he ordered. \"What of Kharvani?\"\n\n\"Listen, Mahommed Khan!\" Ruth Bellairs laid one hand on his sleeve, and\ntried to draw him back. \"Your ways are not my ways! You are a soldier\nand a gentleman, but please remember that you are of a different race!\nI can not let my life be saved by the torture of a human being--no, not\neven of a Hindu priest! Maybe it's all right and honorable according to\nyour ideas; but, if you did it, I would never be able to look my husband\nin the face again! No, Risaldar! Let this priest go, or leave him\nhere--I don't care which, but don't harm him! I am quite ready to ride\nwith you, now, if you like. I suppose you have horses? But I would\nrather die than think that a man was put to the torture to save me! Life\nisn't worth that price!\"\n\nShe spoke rapidly, urging him with every argument she knew; but the grim\nold Mohammedan shook his head.\n\n\"Better die here,\" he answered her, \"than on the road! No, memsahib.\nWith thirteen blades behind me, I could reach Jundhra, or at least make\na bold attempt; but single-handed, and with you to guard, the feat is\nimpossible. This dog of a Hindu here knows of some hiding-place. Let him\nspeak!\"\n\nHis hand went to his sword again, and his eyes flashed.\n\n\"Listen, heavenborn! I am no torturer of priests by trade! It is not my\nlife that I would save!\"\n\n\"I know that, Mahommed Khan! I respect your motive. It's the method that\nI can't tolerate.\"\n\nThe Risaldar drew his arm away from her and began to pace the room.\nThe High Priest instantly began to speak to Ruth, whispering to her\nhurriedly in Hindustanee, but she was too little acquainted with the\nlanguage to understand him.\n\n\"And I,\" said the Risaldar's half-brother suddenly, \"am I of no further\nuse?\"\n\n\"I had forgotten thee!\" exclaimed the Risaldar.\n\nThey spoke together quickly in their own language, drawing aside and\nmuttering to each other. It was plain that the half-brother was\nmaking some suggestion and that the Risaldar was questioning him and\ncross-examining him about his plan, but neither Ruth nor the High Priest\ncould understand a word that either of them said. At the end of two\nminutes or more, the Risaldar gave an order of some kind and the\nhalf-brother grunted and left the room without another word, closing\nthe door noiselessly behind him. The Risaldar locked it again from the\ninside and drew the bolt.\n\n\"We have made another plan, heavenborn!\" he announced mysteriously.\n\n\"Then--then--you won't hurt this priest?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said the Risaldar. \"He may be useful!\"\n\n\"Won't you unbind him, then? Look! His wrists and ankles are all\nswollen.\"\n\n\"Let the dog swell!\" he grunted.\n\nBut Ruth stuck to her point and made him loosen the bonds a little.\n\n\"A man lives and learns!\" swore the Risaldar. \"Such as he were cast\ninto dungeons in my day, to feed on their own bellies until they had had\nenough of life!\"\n\n\"The times have changed!\" said Ruth.\n\nThe Risaldar looked out through the window toward the red glow on the\nsky-line.\n\n\"Ha! Changed, have they!\" he muttered. \"I saw one such burning, once\nbefore!\"\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nThe most wonderful thing in history, pointing with the surest finger to\nthe trail of destiny, has been the fact that in every tremendous crisis\nthere have been leaders on the spot to meet it. It is not so wonderful\nthat there should be such men, for the world keeps growing better, and\nit is more than likely that the men who have left their footprints in\nthe sands of time would compare to their own disadvantage with their\ncompeers of today. The wonderful thing is that the right men have been\nin the right place at the right time. Scipio met Hannibal; Philip\nof Spain was forced to meet Howard of Effingham and Drake; Napoleon\nBonaparte, the \"Man of Destiny,\" found Wellington and Nelson of the Nile\nto deal with him; and, in America, men like George Washington and Grant\nand Lincoln seem, in the light of history, like timed, calculated,\ncontrolling devices in an intricate machine. It was so when the Indian\nMutiny broke out. The struggle was unexpected. A handful of Europeans,\ncommissioned and enlisted in the ordinary way, with a view to trade, not\nstatesmanship, found themselves face to face at a minute's notice with\narmed and vengeful millions. Succor was a question of months, not days\nor weeks. India was ablaze from end to end with rebel fires that had\nbeen planned in secret through silent watchful years. The British force\nwas scattered here and there in unconnected details, and each detail\nwas suddenly cut off from every other one by men who had been trained to\nfight by the British themselves and who were not afraid to die.\n\nThe suddenness with which the outbreak came was one of the chief assets\nof the rebels, for they were able to seize guns and military stores and\nammunition at the very start of things, before the British force could\nconcentrate. Their hour could scarcely have been better chosen. The\nCrimean War was barely over. Practically the whole of England's standing\narmy was abroad and decimated by battle and disease. At home, politics\nhad England by the throat; the income-tax was on a Napoleonic scale and\nmen were more bent on worsting one another than on equipping armies.\nThey had had enough of war.\n\nIndia was isolated, at the rebels' mercy, so it seemed. There were no\nrailway trains to make swift movements of troops possible. Distances\nwere reckoned by the hundred miles--of sun-baked, thirsty dust in\nthe hot weather, and of mud in the rainy season. There were no\ntelegraph-wires, and the British had to cope with the mysterious,\nand even yet unsolved, native means of sending news--the so-called\n\"underground route,\" by which news and instructions travel faster than\na pigeon flies. There was never a greater certainty or a more one-sided\nstruggle, at the start. The only question seemed to be how many days,\nor possibly weeks, would pass before jackals crunched the bones of every\nEnglishman in India.\n\nBut at the British helm was Nicholson, and under him were a hundred\nother men whose courage and resource had been an unknown quantity until\nthe outbreak came. Nicholson's was the guiding spirit, but it needed\nonly his generalship to fire all the others with that grim enthusiasm\nthat has pulled Great Britain out of so many other scrapes. Instead of\nwasting time in marching and countermarching to relieve the scattered\nposts, a swift, sudden swoop was made on Delhi, where the eggs of the\nrebellion had hatched.\n\nAs many of the outposts as could be reached were told to fight their\nown way in, and those that could not be reached were left to defend\nthemselves until the big blow had been struck at the heart of things.\nIf Delhi could be taken, the rebels would be paralyzed and the rescue of\nbeleaguered details would be easier; so, although odds of one hundred\nor more to one are usually considered overlarge in wartime--when the\nhundred hold the fort and the one must storm the gate--there was no time\nlost in hesitation. Delhi was the goal; and from north and south and\neast and west the men who could march marched, and those who could not\nentrenched themselves, and made ready to die in the last ditch.\n\nSome of the natives were loyal still. There were men like Risaldar\nMahommed Khan, who would have died ten deaths ten times over rather than\nbe false in one particular to the British Government. It was these men\nwho helped to make intercommunication possible, for they could carry\nmessages and sometimes get through unsuspected where a British soldier\nwould have been shot before he had ridden half a mile. Their loyalty was\nput to the utmost test in that hour, for they can not have believed\nthat the British force could win. They knew the extent of what was out\nagainst them and knew, too, what their fate would be in the event of\ncapture or defeat. There would be direr, slower vengeance wreaked on\nthem than on the alien British. But they had eaten British salt and\npledged their word, and nothing short of death could free them from it.\nThere was not a shred of self interest to actuate them; there could not\nhave been. Their given word was law and there it ended.\n\nThere were isolated commands, like that at Jundhra, that were too far\naway to strike at Delhi and too large and too efficient to be shut in by\nthe mutineers. They were centers on their own account of isolated small\ndetachments, and each commander was given leave to act as he saw best,\nprovided that he acted and did it quickly. He could either march to the\nrelief of his detachments or call them in, but under no condition was he\nto sit still and do nothing.\n\nSo, Colonel Carter's note addressed to O. C.--Jundhra only got\ntwo-thirds of the way from Doonha. The gunner who rode with it was\nbrought to a sudden standstill by an advance-guard of British cavalry,\nand two minutes later he found himself saluting and giving up his note\nto the General Commanding. The rebels at Jundhra had been worsted and\nscattered after an eight-hour fight, and General Turner had made up his\nmind instantly to sweep down on Hanadra with all his force and relieve\nthe British garrison at Doonha on his way.\n\nJundhra was a small town and unhealthy. Hanadra was a large city, the\ncenter of a province; and, from all accounts, Hanadra had not risen yet.\nBy seizing Hanadra before the mutineers had time to barricade themselves\ninside it, he could paralyze the countryside, for in Hanadra were the\nmoney and provisions and, above all, the Hindu priests who, in that\npart of India at least, were the brains of the rebellion. So he burned\nJundhra, to make it useless to the rebels, and started for Hanadra with\nevery man and horse and gun and wagon and round of ammunition that he\nhad.\n\nNow news in India travels like the wind, first one way and then another.\nBut, unlike the wind, it never whistles. Things happen and men know\nit and the information spreads--invisible, intangible, inaudible, but\npositive and, in nine cases out of ten, correct in detail. A government\ncan no more censor it, or divert it, or stop it on the way, than it can\nstay the birthrate or tamper with the Great Monsoon.\n\nFirst the priests knew it, then it filtered through the main bazaars\nand from them on through the smaller streets. By the time that General\nTurner had been two hours on the road with his command every man and\nwoman and child in Hanadra knew that the rebels had been beaten back\nand that Hanadra was his objective. They knew, too, that the section had\nreached Doonha, had relieved it and started back again. And yet not a\nsingle rebel who had fought in either engagement was within twenty miles\nof Hanadra yet!\n\nIn the old, low-ceilinged room above the archway Mahommed Khan paced\nup and down and chewed at his black mustache, kicking his scabbard away\nfrom him each time he turned and glowering at the priest.\n\n\"That dog can solve this riddle!\" he kept muttering. Then he would glare\nat Ruth impatiently and execrate the squeamishness of women. Ruth sat\non the divan with her face between her hands, trying to force herself to\nrealize the full extent of her predicament and beat back the feeling of\nhysteria that almost had her in its grip. The priest lay quiet. He was\nin a torture of discomfort on the upturned table, but he preferred\nnot to give the Risaldar the satisfaction of knowing it. He eased his\nposition quietly from time to time as much as his bandages would let\nhim, but he made no complaint.\n\nSuddenly, Ruth looked up. It had occurred to her that she was wasting\ntime and that if she were to fight off the depression that had seized\nher she would be better occupied.\n\n\"Mahommed Khan,\" she said, \"if I am to leave here on horseback, with you\nor with an escort, I had better collect some things that I would like to\ntake with me. Let me in that room, please!\"\n\n\"The horse will have all that it can carry, heavenborn, without a load\nof woman's trappings.\"\n\n\"My jewels? I can take them, I suppose?\"\n\nHe bowed. \"They are in there? I will bring them, heavenborn!\"\n\n\"Nonsense! You don't know where to find them.\"\n\n\"The ayah--will--will show me!\"\n\nHe fitted the key into the lock and turned it, but Ruth was at his side\nbefore he could pass in through the door.\n\n\"Nonsense, Risaldar! The ayah can't hurt me. You have taken her knife\naway, and that is my room. I will go in there alone!\"\n\nShe pushed past him before he could prevent her, thrust the door back\nand peered in.\n\n\"Stay, heavenborn--I will explain!\"\n\n\"Explain what?\"\n\nThe dim light from the lamp was filtering in past them, and her eyes\nwere slowly growing accustomed to the gloom. There was something lying\non the floor, in the middle of the room, that was bulky and shapeless\nand unfamiliar.\n\n\"Ayah!\" said Ruth. \"Ayah!\"\n\nBut there was no answer.\n\n\"Where is she, Risaldar?\"\n\n\"She is there, heavenborn!\"\n\n\"Is she asleep?\"\n\n\"Aye! She sleeps deeply!\"\n\nThere was, something in the Rajput's voice that was strange, that hinted\nat a darker meaning.\n\n\"Ayah!\" she called again, afraid, though she knew not why, to enter.\n\n\"She guards the jewels, heavenborn! Wait, while I bring the lamp!\"\n\nHe crossed the room, brought it and stepped with it past Ruth, straight\ninto the room.\n\n\"See!\" he said, holding the lamp up above his head. \"There in her bosom\nare the jewels! It was there, too, that she had the knife to slay thee\nwith! My sword is clean, yet, heavenborn! I slew her with my fingers,\nthus!\"\n\nHe kicked the prostrate ayah, and, as the black face with the wide-open\nbloodshot eyes and the protruding tongue rolled sidewise and the body\nmoved, a little heap of jewels fell upon the floor. Mahommed Khan\nstooped down to gather them, bending, a little painfully, on one old\nknee--but stopped half-way and turned. There was a thud behind him in\nthe doorway. Ruth Bellairs had fainted, and lay as the ayah had lain\nwhen Risaldar had not yet locked her in the room.\n\nHe raised the lamp and studied her in silence for a minute, looking from\nher to the bound priest and back to her again.\n\n\"Now praised be Allah!\" he remarked aloud, with a world of genuine\nrelief in his voice. \"Should she stay fainted for a little while, that\npriest--\"\n\nHe stalked into the middle of the outer room. He set the lamp down on a\ntable and looked the priest over as a butcher might survey a sheep he is\nabout to kill.\n\n\"Now--robber of orphans--bleeder of widows' blood--dog of an\nidol-briber! This stands between thee and Kharvani!\" He drew his sword\nand flicked the edges of it. \"And this!\" He took up the tongs again.\n\"There is none now to plead or to forbid! Think! Show me the way out of\nthis devil's nest, or--\" He raised the tongs again.\n\nAt that minute came a quiet knock. He set the tongs down again and\ncrossed the room and opened the door.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nMahommed Khan closed the door again behind his half-brother and turned\nthe key, but the half-brother shot the bolt home as well before he\nspoke, then listened intently for a minute with his ear to the keyhole.\n\n\"Where is the priest's son?\" growled the Risaldar, in the Rajput tongue.\n\n\"I have him. I have the priestling in a sack. I have him trussed and\nbound and gagged, so that he can neither speak nor wriggle!\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Hidden safely.\"\n\n\"I said to bring him here!\"\n\n\"I could not. Listen! That ayah--where is she?\"\n\n\"Dead! What has the ayah to do with it?\"\n\n\"This--she was to give a sign. She was not to slay. She had leave only\nto take the jewels. Her orders were either to wait until she knew by\nquestioning that the section would not return or else, when it had\nreturned, to wait until the memsahib and Bellairs sahib slept, and then\nto make a sign. They grow tired of waiting now, for there is news! At\nJundhra the rebels are defeated, and at Doonha likewise.\"\n\n\"How know you this?\"\n\n\"By listening to the priests' talk while I lay in wait to snare the\npriestling. Nothing is known as yet as to what the guns or garrison at\nDoonha do, but it is known that they of Jundhra will march on Hanadra\nhere. They search now for their High Priest, being minded to march out\nof here and set an ambush on the road.\"\n\n\"They have time. From Jundhra to here is a long march! Until tomorrow\nevening or the day following they have time!\"\n\n\"Aye! And they have fear also! They seek their priest--listen.\"\n\nThere were voices plainly audible in the courtyard down below, and\ntwo more men stood at the foot of the winding stairway whispering. By\nlistening intently they could hear almost what they said, for the stone\nstairway acted like a whispering-gallery, the voices echoing up it from\nwall to wall.\n\n\"Why do they seek him here?\"\n\n\"They have sought elsewhere and not found him; and there is talk--He\nclaimed the memsahib as his share of the plunder. They think--\"\n\nMahommed Khan glared at the trussed-up priest and swore a savage oath\nbeneath his breath.\n\n\"Have they touched the stables yet?\" he demanded.\n\n\"No, not yet. The loot is to be divided evenly among certain of the\npriests, and no man may yet lay a hand on it.\"\n\n\"Is there a guard there?\"\n\n\"No. No one would steal what the priests claim, and the priests will not\ntrust one another. So the horses stand in their stalls unwatched.\"\n\nThe voices down the stairs grew louder, and the sound of footsteps began\nascending, slowly and with hesitation.\n\n\"Quick!\" said the Risaldar. \"Light me that brazier again!\"\n\nCharcoal lights quickly, and before the steps had reached the landing\nMahommed Khan had a hot coal glowing in his tongs:\n\n\"Now speak to them!\" he growled at the shuddering priest. \"Order them to\ngo back to their temple and tell them that you follow!\"\n\nThe priest shut his lips tight and shook his head. With rescue so near\nas that, he could see no reason to obey. But the hot coal touched him,\nand a Hindu who may be not at all afraid to die can not stand torture.\n\n\"I speak!\" he answered, writhing.\n\n\"Speak, then!\" said the Risaldar, choosing a larger coal. Then, in\nthe priest's language, which none--and least of all a Risaldar--can\nunderstand except the priests themselves, he began to shout directions,\npitching his voice into a high, wailing, minor key. He was answered by\nanother sing-song voice outside the door and he listened with a glowing\ncoal held six inches from his eyes.\n\n\"An eye for a false move!\" hissed Mahommed Khan. \"Two eyes are the\nforfeit unless they go down the stairs again! Then my half-brother here\nwill follow to the temple and if any watch, or stay behind, thy ears\nwill sizzle!\"\n\nThe High Priest raised his voice into a wail again, and the feet\nshuffled along the landing and descended.\n\n\"Put down that coal!\" he pleaded. \"I have done thy bidding!\"\n\n\"Watch through the window!\" said the Risaldar. \"Then follow!\"\n\nHis giant half-brother peered from behind the curtain and listened. He\ncould hear laughter, ribald, mocking laughter, but low, and plainly not\nintended for the High Priest's ears.\n\n\"They go!\" he growled.\n\n\"Then follow.\"\n\nOnce again the Risaldar was left alone with the priest and the\nunconscious Ruth. She was suffering from the effects of long days and\nnights of nerve-destroying heat, with the shock of unexpected horror\nsuper-added, and she showed no disposition to recover consciousness. The\npriest, though, was very far from having lost his power to think.\n\n\"You are a fool!\" he sneered at the Risaldar, but the sword leaped from\nits scabbard at the word and he changed that line of argument. \"You hold\ncards and know not how to play them!\"\n\n\"I know along which road my honor lies! I lay no plans to murder people\nin their sleep.\"\n\n\"Honor! And what is honor? What is the interest on honor--how much\npercent?\"\n\nThe Risaldar turned his back on him, but the High Priest laughed.\n\n\"'The days of the Raj are numbered!\" said the priest. \"The English will\nbe slain to the last man and then where will you be? Where will be the\nprofit on your honor?\"\n\nThe Risaldar listened, for he could not help it, but he made no answer.\n\n\"Me you hold here, a prisoner. You can slay or torture. But what good\nwill that do? The woman that you guard will fall sooner or later into\nHindu hands. You can not fight against a legion. Listen! I hold the\nstrings of wealth. With a jerk I can unloose a fortune in your lap. I\nneed that woman there!\"\n\n\"For what?\" snarled the Risaldar, whirling round on him, his eyes\nablaze.\n\n\"'For power! Kharvani's temple here has images and paintings and a voice\nthat speaks--but no Kharvani!\"\n\nThe Rajput turned away again and affected unconcern.\n\n\"Could Kharvani but appear, could her worshipers but see Kharvani\nmanifest, what would a lakh, two lakhs, a crore of rupees mean to me,\nthe High Priest of her temple? I could give thee anything! The power\nover all India would be in my hands! Kharvani would but appear and say\nthus and thus, and thus would it be done!\"\n\nThe Risaldar's hand had risen to his mustache. His back was still turned\non the priest, but he showed interest. His eyes wandered to where Ruth\nlay in a heap by the inner door and then away again.\n\n\"Who would believe it?\" he growled in an undertone.\n\n\"They would all believe it! One and all! Even Mohammedans would become\nHindus to worship at her shrine and beg her favors. Thou and I alone\nwould share the secret. Listen! Loose me these bonds--my limbs ache.\"\n\nMahommed Khan turned. He stooped and cut them with his sword.\n\n\"Now I can talk,\" said the priest, sitting up and rubbing his ankles.\n\"Listen. Take thou two horses and gallop off, so that the rest may think\nthat the white woman has escaped. Then return here secretly and name thy\nprice--and hold thy tongue!\"\n\n\"And leave her in thy hands?\" asked the Risaldar.\n\n\"In my keeping.\"\n\n\"Bah! Who would trust a Hindu priest!\"\n\nThe Rajput was plainly wavering and the priest stood up, to argue with\nhim the better.\n\n\"What need to trust me? You, sahib, will know the secret, and none other\nbut myself will know it. Would I, think you, be fool enough to tell the\nrest, or, by withholding just payment from you, incite you to spread it\nbroadcast? You and I will know it and we alone. To me the power that\nit will bring--to you all the wealth you ever dreamed of, and more\nbesides!\"\n\n\"No other priest would know?\"\n\n\"Not one! They will think the woman escaped!\"\n\n\"And she--where would you keep her?\"\n\n\"In a secret place I know of, below the temple.\"\n\n\"Does any other know it?\"\n\n\"No. Not one!\"\n\n\"Listen!\" said the Risaldar, stroking at his beard. \"This woman never\ndid me any wrong--but she is a woman, not a man. I owe her no fealty,\nand yet--I would not like to see her injured. Were I to agree to thy\nplan, there would needs be a third man in the secret.\"\n\n\"Who? Name him,\" said the priest, grinning his satisfaction.\n\n\"My half-brother Suliman.\"\n\n\"Agreed!\"\n\n\"He must go with us to the hiding-place and stay there as her servant.\"\n\n\"Is he a silent man?\"\n\n\"Silent as the dead, unless I bid him speak!\"\n\n\"Then, that is agreed; he and thou and I know of this secret, and none\nother is to know it! Why wait? Let us remove her to the hiding-place!\"\n\n\"Wait yet for Suliman. How long will I be gone, think you, on my\npretended flight?\"\n\n\"Nay, what think you, sahib?\"\n\n\"I think many hours. There may be those that watch, or some that ride\nafter me. I think I shall not return until long after daylight, and then\nthere will be no suspicions. Give me a token that will admit me safely\nback into Hanadra--some sign that the priests will know, and a pass to\nshow to any one that bids me halt.\"\n\nThe priest held out his hand. \"Take off that ring of mine!\" he answered.\n\"That is the sacred ring of Kharvani--and all men know it. None will\ntouch thee or refuse thee anything, do they have but the merest sight of\nit!\"\n\nThe Risaldar drew off a clumsy silver ring, set with three stones--a\nsapphire and a ruby and an emerald, each one of which was worth a\nfortune by itself. He slipped it on his own finger and turned it round\nslowly, examining it.\n\n\"See how I trust thee,\" said the priest.\n\n\"More than I do thee!\" muttered the Risaldar.\n\n\"I hear my brother!\" growled the Risaldar after another minute. \"Be\nready to show the way!\"\n\nHe walked across the room to Ruth, tore a covering from a divan and\nwrapped her in it; then he opened the outer door for his half-brother.\n\n\"Is it well?\" he asked in the Rajput tongue.\n\n\"All well!\" boomed the half-brother, eying the unbound priest with\nunconcealed surprise.\n\n\"Do any watch?\"\n\n\"Not one! The priests are in the temple; all who are not priests man the\nwalls or rush here and there making ready.\"\n\n\"And the priestling?\"\n\n\"Is where I left him.\"\n\n\"Where?--I said.\"\n\n\"In the niche underneath the arch, where I trapped the High Priest!\"\n\n\"Are the horses fed and watered?\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib!\"\n\n\"Good! How is the niche opened where the priestling lies?\"\n\n\"There is the trunk of an elephant, carved where the largest stone of\nall begins to curve outward, on the side of the stone as you go outward\nfrom the courtyard.\"\n\n\"On which side of the archway, then?\"\n\n\"On the left side, sahib. Press on the trunk downward and then pull; the\nstone swings outward. There are steps then--ten steps downward to the\nstone floor where the priestling lies.\"\n\n\"Good! I can find him. Now pick up the heavenborn yonder in those great\narms of thine, and bear her gently! Gently, I said! So! Have a care,\nnow, that she is not injured against the corners. My honor, aye, my\nhonor and yours and all our duty to the Raj you bear and--and have a\ncare of the corners?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" answered the half-brother, stolidly, holding Ruth as though she\nhad been a little bag of rice.\n\nAgain the Risaldar turned to the High Priest, and eyed him through eyes\nthat glittered.\n\n\"We are ready!\" he growled. \"Lead on to thy hiding-place!\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nThe guns rode first from Doonha, for the guns take precedence. The\nsection ground-scouts were acting scouts for the division, two hundred\nyards ahead of every one. Behind the guns rode Colonel Forrester-Carter,\nfollowed by the wagon with the wounded; and last of all the two\ncompanies of the Thirty-third trudged through the stifling heat.\n\nBut, though the guns were ahead of every one, they had to suit their\npace to that of the men who marched. For one thing, there might be an\nattack at any minute, and guns that are caught at close quarters at a\ndistance from their escort are apt to be astonishingly helpless. They\ncan act in unison with infantry; but alone, on bad ground, in the\ndarkness, and with their horses nearly too tired to drag them, a leash\nof ten puppies in a crowd would be an easier thing to hurry with.\n\nYoung Bellairs had his men dismounted and walking by their mounts. Even\nthe drivers led their horses, for two had been taken from each gun to\ndrag the wounded, and the guns are calculated as a load for six, not\nfour.\n\nAs he trudged through the blood-hot dust in clumsy riding-boots and\nled his charger on the left flank of the guns, Harry Bellairs fumed and\nfretted in a way to make no man envy him. The gloomy, ghost-like trees,\nthat had flitted past him on the road to Doonha, crawled past him\nnow--slowly and more slowly as his tired feet blistered in his boots.\nHe could not mount and ride, though, for very shame, while his men were\nmarching, and he dared not let them ride, for fear the horses might give\nin. He could just trudge and trudge, and hate himself and every one, and\nwonder.\n\nWhat had the Risaldar contrived to do? Why hadn't he packed up his\nwife's effects the moment that his orders came and ridden off with her\nand the section at once, instead of waiting three hours or more for an\nescort for her? Why hadn't he realized at once that orders that came in\na hurry that way, in the night-time, were not only urgent but ominous as\nwell? What chance had the Risaldar--an old man, however willing he might\nbe--to ride through a swarming countryside for thirty miles or more and\nbring back an escort? Why, even supposing Mohammed Khan had ridden off\nat once, he could scarcely be back again before the section! And what\nwould have happened in the meantime?\n\nSupposing the Risaldar's sons and grandsons refused to obey him?\nStranger things than that had been known to happen! Suppose they were\ndisloyal? And then--blacker though than any yet!--suppose--suppose--\nWhy had Mahommed Khan, the hard-bitten, wise old war-dog, advised him\nto leave his wife behind? Did that seem like honest advice, on second\nthought? Mohammedans had joined in this outbreak as well as Hindus.\nThe sepoys at Doonha were Mohammedans! Why had Mahommed Khan seemed so\nanxious to send him on his way? As though an extra five minutes\nwould have mattered! Why had he objected to a last good-by to Mrs.\nBellairs?... And then--he had shown a certain knowledge of the uprising;\nwhere had he obtained it? If he were loyal, who then had told him of it?\nNatives who are disloyal don't brag of their plans beforehand to men who\nare on the other side! And if he had known of it, and was still loyal,\nhow was it that he had not divulged his information before the outbreak\ncame? Would a loyal man hold his tongue until the last minute? Scarcely!\n\nHe halted, pulled his horse to the middle of the road and waited for\nColonel Carter to overtake him.\n\n\"Well? What is it?\" asked the colonel sharply.\n\n\"Can I ride on ahead, sir? My horse is good for it and I'm in agonies of\napprehension about my wife!\"\n\n\"No! Certainly not! You are needed to command your section!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, but I've a sergeant who can take command. He's\na first-class man and perfectly dependable.\"\n\n\"You could do no good, even if you did ride on,\" said the colonel, not\nunkindly.\n\n\"I'm thinking, sir, that Mahommed Khan--\"\n\n\"Risaldar Mahommed Khan?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Of the Rajput Horse?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. My father's Risaldar.\"\n\n\"You left your wife in his charge, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but I'm thinking that--that perhaps the Risaldar--I\nmean--there seem to be Mohammedans at the bottom of this business, as\nwell as Hindus. Perhaps--\"\n\n\"Bellairs! Now hear me once and for all. You thank your God that the\nRisaldar turned up to guard her! Thank God that your father was man\nenough for Mahommed Khan to love and that you are your father's son! And\nlisten! Don't let me hear you, ever, under any circumstances, breathe a\nword of doubt as to that man's loyalty! D'you understand me, sir? You,\na mere subaltern, a puppy just out of his 'teens, an insignificant\njackanapes with two twelve-pounders in your charge, daring to impute\ndisloyalty to Mahommed Khan!--your impudence! Remember this! That old\nRisaldar is the man who rode with your father through the guns at Dera!\nHe's a pauper without a pension, for all his loyalty, but he went down\nthe length of India to meet you, at his own expense, when you landed\nraw-green from England! And what d'you know of war, I'd like to know,\nthat you didn't learn from him? Thank your God, sir, that there's\nsome one there who'll kill your wife before she falls into the Hindus'\nhands!\"\n\n\"But he was going to ride away, sir, to bring an escort!\"\n\n\"Not before he'd made absolutely certain of her safety!\" swore the\ncolonel with conviction. \"Join your section, sir!\"\n\nSo Harry Bellairs joined his section and trudged along sore-footed at\nits side--sore-hearted, too. He wondered whether any one would ever say\nas much for him as Colonel Carter had chosen to say for Mahommed Khan,\nor whether any one would have the right to say it! He was ashamed of\nhaving left his wife behind and tortured with anxiety--and smarting from\nthe snub--a medley of sensations that were more likely to make a man of\nhim, if he had known it, than the whole experience of a year's campaign!\nBut in the dust and darkness, with the blisters on his heels, and fifty\nmen, who had overheard the colonel, looking sidewise at him, his plight\nwas pitiable.\n\nThey trudged until the dawn began to rise, bright yellow below the\ndrooping banian trees; only Colonel Carter and the advance-guard riding.\nThen, when they stopped at a stream to water horses and let them graze\na bit and give the men a sorely needed rest, one of the ring of outposts\nloosed off his rifle and shouted an alarm. They had formed square in an\ninstant, with the guns on one side and the men on three, and the colonel\nand the wounded in the middle. A thousand or more of the mutineers\nleaned on their rifles on the shoulder of a hill and looked them over, a\nthousand yards away.\n\n\"Send them an invitation!\" commanded Colonel Carter, and the left-hand\ngun barked out an overture, killing one sepoy. The rest made off in the\ndirection of Hanadra.\n\n\"We're likely to have a hot reception when we reach there!\" said Colonel\nCarter cheerily. \"Well, we'll rest here for thirty minutes and give them\na chance to get ready for us. I'm sorry there's no breakfast, men, but\nthe sepoys will have dinner ready by the time we get there--we'll eat\ntheirs!\"\n\nThe chorus of ready laughter had scarcely died away when a horse's\nhoof-beats clattered in the distance from the direction of Doonha and a\nnative cavalryman galloped into view, low-bent above his horse's neck.\nThe foam from his horse was spattered over him and his lance swung\npointing upward from the sling. On his left side the polished scabbard\nrose and fell in time to his horse's movement. He was urging his weary\nhorse to put out every ounce he had in him. He drew rein, though, when\nhe reached a turning in the road and saw the resting division in front\nof him, and walked his horse forward, patting his sweat-wet neck and\neasing him. But as he leaned to finger with the girths an ambushed\nsepoy fired at him, and he rammed in his spurs again and rode like a man\npossessed.\n\n\"This'll be another untrustworthy Mohammedan!\" said Colonel Carter in\na pointed undertone, and Bellairs blushed crimson underneath the tan.\n\"He's ridden through from Jundhra, with torture waiting for him if he\nhappened to get caught, and no possible reward beyond his pay. Look out\nhe doesn't spike your guns!\"\n\nThe trooper rode straight up to Colonel Carter and saluted. He removed\na tiny package from his cheek, where he had carried it so that he might\nswallow it at once in case of accident, tore the oil-silk cover from\nit and handed it to him without a word, saluting again and leading his\nhorse away. Colonel Carter unfolded the half-sheet of foreign notepaper\nand read:\n\n        Dear Colonel Carter:\n        Your letter just received in which you say that you have blown\n        up the magazine at Doonha and are marching to Hanadra with a\n        view to the rescue of Mrs. Bellairs.  This is in no sense\n        intended as a criticism of your action or of your plan, but\n        circumstances have made it seem advisable for me to transfer\n        my own headquarters to Hanadra and I am just starting.  I must\n        ask you, please, to wait for me--at a spot as near to where\n        this overtakes you as can be managed.  If Mrs. Bellairs, or\n        anybody else of ours, is in Hanadra, she--or they--are either\n        dead by now or else prisoners.  And if they are to be rescued\n        by force, the larger the force employed the better.  If you\n        were to attack with your two companies before I reached you,\n        you probably would be repulsed, and would, I think, endanger\n        the lives of any prisoners that the enemy may hold.  I am\n        coming with my whole command as fast as possible.\n                        Your Obedient Servant,\n                                        A. E. Turner\n                                        Genl. Officer Commanding\n\n\"Men!\" said Colonel Carter, in a ringing voice that gave not the\nslightest indication of his feelings, \"we're to wait here for a while\nuntil the whole division overtakes us. The general has vacated Jundhra.\nLie down and get all the rest you can!\"\n\nThe murmur from the ranks was as difficult to read as Colonel Carter's\nvoice had been. It might have meant pleasure at the thought of rest,\nor anger, or contempt, or almost anything. It was undefined and\nindefinable.\n\nBut there was no doubt at all as to how young Bellairs felt. He was\nsitting on a trunnion, sobbing, with his head bent low between his\nhands.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\"Come, then!\" said the High Priest.\n\nMahommed Khan threw open the outer door and bowed sardonically.\n\"Precedence for priests!\" he sneered, tapping at his sword-hilt. \"Thou\ngoest first! Next come I, and last Suliman with the memsahib! Thus can I\nreach thee with my sword, O priest, and also protect her if need be!\"\n\n\"Thou art trusting as a little child!\" exclaimed the priest, passing out\nahead of him.\n\n\"A priest and a liar and a thief--all three are one!\" hummed the\nRisaldar. \"Bear her gently, Suliman! Have a care, now, as you turn on\nthe winding stairs!\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib!\" said the half-brother, carrying Ruth as easily as though\nshe had been a little child.\n\nAt the foot of the stairway, in the blackness that seemed alive with\nphantom shadows, the High Priest paused and listened, stretching out\nhis left hand against the wall to keep the other two behind him. From\nsomewhere beyond the courtyard came the din of hurrying sandaled feet,\nscudding over cobblestones in one direction. The noise was incessant and\nnot unlike the murmur of a rapid stream. Occasionally a voice was raised\nin some command or other, but the stream of sound continued, hurrying,\nhurrying, shuffling along to the southward.\n\n\"This way and watch a while,\" whispered the priest.\n\n\"I have heard rats run that way!\" growled the Risaldar.\n\nThey climbed up a narrow stairway leading to a sort of battlement and\npeered over the top, Suliman laying Ruth Bellairs down in the darkest\nshadow he could find. She was beginning to recover consciousness, and\napparently Mahommed Khan judged it best to take no notice of her.\n\nDown below them they could see the city gate, wide open, with a blazing\ntorch on either side of it, and through the gate, swarming like\nants before the rains, there poured an endless stream of humans that\nmarched--and marched--and marched; four, ten, fifteen abreast; all\nheights and sizes, jumbled in and out among one another, anyhow, without\nformation, but armed, every one of them, and all intent on marching\nto the southward, where Jundhra and Doonha lay. Some muttered to one\nanother and some laughed, but the greater number marched in silence.\n\n\"That for thy English!\" grinned the priest. \"Can the English troops\novercome that horde?\"\n\n\"Hey-ee! For a troop or two of Rajputs!\" sighed the Risaldar. \"Or\nEnglish Lancers! They would ride through that as an ax does through the\nbrush-wood!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said the priest. \"All soldiers boast! There will be a houghing\nshortly after dawn. The days of thy English are now numbered.\"\n\n\"By those--there?\"\n\n\"Ay, by those, there! Come!\"\n\nThey climbed down the steps again, the Rajput humming to himself and\nsmiling grimly into his mustache.\n\n\"Ay! There will be a houghing shortly after dawn!\" he muttered. \"Would\nonly that I were there to see!... Where are the sepoys?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I know not. How should I know, who have been thy guest these hours\npast? This march is none of my ordering.\"\n\nThe priest pressed hard on a stone knob that seemed to be part of the\ncarving on a wall, then he leaned his weight against the wall and a huge\nstone swung inward, while a fetid breath of air wafted outward in their\nfaces.\n\n\"None know this road but I!\" exclaimed the priest.\n\n\"None need to!\" said the Risaldar. \"Pass on, snake, into thy hole. We\nfollow.\"\n\n\"Steps!\" said the priest, and began descending.\n\n\"Curses!\" said the Risaldar, stumbling and falling down on top of him.\n\"Have a care, Suliman! The stone is wet and slippery.\"\n\nDown, down they climbed, one behind the other, Suliman grunting beneath\nhis burden and the Risaldar keeping up a running fire of oaths. Each\ntime that he slipped, and that was often, he cursed the priest and\ncautioned Suliman. But the priest only laughed, and apparently Suliman\nwas sure-footed, for he never stumbled once. They seemed to be diving\ndown into the bowels of the earth. They were in pitch-black darkness,\nfor the stone had swung to behind them of its own accord. The wall on\neither side of them was wet with slime and the stink of decaying ages\nrose and almost stifled them. But the priest kept on descending, so fast\nthat the other two had trouble to keep up with him, and he hummed to\nhimself as though he knew the road and liked it.\n\n\"The bottom!\" he called back suddenly. \"From now the going is easy,\nuntil we rise again. We pass now under the city-wall.\"\n\nBut they could see nothing and hear nothing except their own footfalls\nswishing in the ooze beneath them. Even the priest's words seemed to\nbe lost at once, as though he spoke into a blanket, for the air they\nbreathed was thicker than a mist and just as damp. They walked on, along\na level, wet, stone passage for at least five minutes, feeling their way\nwith one band on the wall.\n\n\"Steps, now!\" said the priest. \"Have a care, now, for the lower ones are\nslippery.\"\n\nRuth was regaining consciousness. She began to move and tried once or\ntwice to speak.\n\n\"Here, thou!\" growled the Risaldar. \"Thou art a younger man than I--come\nback here. Help with the memsahib.\"\n\nThe priest came back a step or two, but Suliman declined his aid,\nsnarling vile insults at him.\n\n\"I can manage!\" he growled. \"Get thou behind me, Mahommed Khan, in case\nI slip!\"\n\nSo Mahommed Khan came last, and they slipped and grunted upward, round\nand round a spiral staircase that was hewn out of solid rock. No light\ncame through from anywhere to help them, but the priest climbed on, as\nthough he were accustomed to the stair and knew the way from constant\nuse. After five minutes of steady climbing the stone grew gradually dry.\nThe steps became smaller, too, and deeper, and not so hard to climb.\nSuddenly the priest reached out his arm and pulled at something or other\nthat hung down in the darkness. A stone in the wall rolled open. A flood\nof light burst in and nearly blinded them.\n\n\"We are below Kharvani's temple!\" announced the priest. He led them\nthrough the opening into a four-square room hewn from the rock below the\nfoundations of the temple some time in the dawn of history. The light\nthat had blinded them when they first emerged proved to be nothing but\nthe flicker of two small oil lamps that hung suspended by brass chains\nfrom the painted ceiling. The only furniture was mats spread on the\ncut-stone floor.\n\n\"By which way did we come?\" asked the Risaldar, staring in amazement\nround the walls. There was not a door nor crack, nor any sign of one,\nexcept that a wooden ladder in one corner led to a trapdoor overhead,\nand they had certainly not entered by the ladder.\n\n\"Nay! That is a secret!\" grinned the priest. \"He who can may find the\nopening! Here can the woman and her servant stay until we need them.\"\n\n\"Here in this place?\"\n\n\"Where else? No man but I knows of this crypt! The ladder there leads to\nanother room, where there is yet another ladder, and that one leads out\nthrough a secret door I know of, straight into the temple. Art ready?\nThere is need for haste!\"\n\n\"Wait!\" said the Risaldar.\n\n\"These soldiers!\" sneered the priest. \"It is wait--wait--wait with them,\nalways!\"\n\n\"Hast thou a son.\"\n\n\"Ay! But what of it?\"\n\n\"I said 'hast,' not 'hadst'!\"\n\n\"Ay. I have a son.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In one of the temple-chambers overhead.\"\n\n\"Nay, priest! Thy son lies gagged and bound and trussed in a place I\nknow of, and which thou dost not know!\"\n\n\"Since when?\"\n\n\"Since by my orders he was laid there.\"\n\n\"Thou art the devil! Thou liest, Rajput!\"\n\n\"So? Go seek thy son!\"\n\nThe priest's face had blanched beneath the olive of his skin, and he\nstared at Mahommed Khan through distended eyes.\n\n\"My son!\" he muttered.\n\n\"Aye! Thy priestling! He stays where he is, as hostage, until my return!\nAlso the heavenborn stays here! If, on my return, I find the heavenborn\nsafe and sound, I will exchange her for thy son--and if not, I will\ntear thy son into little pieces before thy eyes, priest! Dost thou\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Thou liest! My son is overhead in the temple here!\"\n\n\"Go seek him, then!\"\n\nThe priest turned and scampered up the ladder with an agility that was\nastonishing in a man of his build and paunch.\n\n\"Hanuman should have been thy master!\" jeered the Risaldar. \"So run the\nbandar-log, the monkey-folk!\"\n\nBut the priest had no time to answer him. He was half frantic with the\nsickening fear of a father for his only son. He returned ten minutes\nlater, panting, and more scared than ever.\n\n\"Go, take thy white woman,\" he exclaimed, \"and give me my son back!\"\n\n\"Nay, priest! Shall I ride with her alone through that horde that\nare marching through the gate? I go now for an escort; in\neight--ten--twelve--I know not how many hours, I will return for her,\nand then--thy son will be exchanged for her, or he dies thus in many\npieces!\"\n\nHe turned to Suliman. \"Is she awake yet?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Barely, but she recovers.\"\n\n\"Then tell her, when consciousness returns, that I have gone and will\nreturn for her. And stay here, thou, and guard her until I come.\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib!\"\n\n\"Now, show the way!\"\n\n\"But--\" said the priest, \"our bargain? The price that we agreed on--one\nlakh, was it not?\"\n\n\"One lakh of devils take thee and tear thee into little pieces! Wouldst\nbribe a Rajput, a Risaldar? For that insult I will repay thee one day\nwith interest, O priest! Now, show the way!\"\n\n\"But how shall I be sure about my son?\"\n\n\"Be sure that the priestling will starve to death or die of thirst or\nchoke, unless I hurry! He is none too easy where he lies!\"\n\n\"Go! Hurry, then!\" swore the priest. \"May all the gods there are, and\nthy Allah with them, afflict thee with all their curses--thee and thine!\nUp with you! Up that ladder! Run! But, if the gods will, I will meet\nthee again when the storm is over!\"\n\n\"Inshallah!\" growled Mahommed Khan.\n\nTen minutes later a crash and a clatter and a shower of sparks broke out\nin the sweltering courtyard where the guns had stood and waited. It was\nShaitan, young Bellairs' Khaubuli charger, with his haunches under him,\nplunging across the flagstones, through the black-dark archway, out\non the plain beyond--in answer to the long, sharp-roweled spurs of the\nRisaldar Mahommed Khan.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\nDawn broke and the roofs of old Hanadra became resplendent with the\nvaried colors of turbans and pugrees and shawls. As though the rising\nsun had loosed the spell, a myriad tongues, of women chiefly, rose in\na babel of clamor, and the few men who had been left in. Hanadra by\nthe night's armed exodus came all together and growled prophetically in\nundertones. Now was the day of days, when that part of India, at least,\nshould cast off the English yoke.\n\nTo the temple! The cry went up before the sun was fifteen minutes high.\nThere are a hundred temples in Hanadra, age-old all of them and carved\non the outside with strange images of heathen gods in high relief, like\nmolds turned inside out. But there is but one temple that that cry could\nmean--Kharvani's; and there could be but one meaning for the cry. Man,\nwoman and child would pray Kharvani, Bride of Siva the Destroyer, to\nintercede with Siva and cause him to rise and smite the English. On the\nskyline, glinting like flashed signals in the early sun, bright English\nbayonets had appeared; and between them and Hanadra was a dense black\nmass, the whole of old Hanadra's able-bodied manhood, lined up to\ndefend the city. Now was the time to pray. Fifty to one are by no means\ndespicable odds, but the aid of the gods as well is better!\n\nSo the huge dome of Kharvani's temple began to echo to the sound of\nslippered feet and awe-struck whisperings, and the big, dim auditorium\nsoon filled to overflowing. No light came in from the outer world.\nThere was nothing to illuminate the mysteries except the chain-hung\ngrease-lamps swinging here and there from beams, and they served only\nto make the darkness visible. Bats flicked in and out between them\nand disappeared in the echoing gloom above. Censers belched out\nsweet-smelling, pungent clouds of sandalwood to drown the stench of hot\nhumanity; and the huge graven image of Kharvani--serene and smiling and\nindifferent--stared round-eyed from the darkness.\n\nThen a priest's voice boomed out in a solemn incantation and the\nwhispering hushed. He chanted age-old verses, whose very meaning was\nforgotten in the womb of time--forgotten as the artist who had painted\nthe picture of idealized Kharvani on the wall. Ten priests, five on\neither side of the tremendous idol, emerged chanting from the gloom\nbehind, and then a gong rang, sweetly, clearly, suddenly, and the\nchanting ceased. Out stepped the High Priest from a niche below the\nimage, and his voice rose in a wailing, sing-song cadence that reechoed\nfrom the dome and sent a thrill through every one who heard.\n\nHis chant had scarcely ceased when the temple door burst open and a man\nrushed in.\n\n\"They have begun!\" he shouted. \"The battle has begun!\"\n\nAs though in ready confirmation of his words, the distant reverberating\nboom of cannon filtered through the doorway from the world of grim\nrealities outside.\n\n\"They have twenty cannon with them! They have more guns than we have!\"\nwailed he who brought the news. Again began the chanting that sought the\naid of Siva the Destroyer. Only, there were fewer who listened to this\nsecond chant. Those who were near the doorway slipped outside and joined\nthe watching hundreds on the roofs.\n\nFor an hour the prayers continued in the stifling gloom, priest\nrelieving priest and chant following on chant, until the temple was half\nemptied of its audience. One by one, and then by twos and threes, the\nworshipers succumbed to human curiosity and crept stealthily outside to\nwatch.\n\nAnother messenger ran in and shouted: \"They have charged! Their cavalry\nhave charged! They are beaten back! Their dead lie twisted on the\nplain!\"\n\nAt the words there was a stampede from the doorway, and half of those\nwho had remained rushed out. There were hundreds still there, though,\nfor that great gloomy pile of Kharvani's could hold an almost countless\ncrowd.\n\nWithin another hour the same man rushed to the door again and shouted:\n\n\"Help comes! Horsemen are coming from the north! Rajputs, riding like\nleaves before the wind! Even the Mussulmans are for us!\"\n\nBut the chanting never ceased. No one stopped to doubt the friendship\nof arrivals from the north, for to that side there were no English, and\nEngland's friends would surely follow byroads to her aid. The city gates\nwere wide open to admit wounded or messengers or friends--with a view,\neven, to a possible retreat--and whoever cared could ride through them\nunchallenged and unchecked.\n\nEven when the crash of horses' hoofs rattled on the stone paving outside\nthe temple there was no suspicion. No move was made to find out who\nit was who rode. But when the temple door reechoed to the thunder of a\nsword-hilt and a voice roared \"Open!\" there was something like a panic.\nThe chanting stopped and the priests and the High Priest listened to the\nstamping on the stone pavement at the temple front.\n\n\"Open!\" roared a voice again, and the thundering on the panels\nrecommenced. Then some one drew the bolt and a horse's head--a huge\nKhaubuli stallion's--appeared, snorting and panting and wild-eyed.\n\n\"Farward!\" roared the Risaldar Mahommed Khan, kneeling on young\nBellairs' winded charger.\n\n\"Farm twos! Farward!\"\n\nStraight into the temple, two by two, behind the Risaldar, rode two\nfierce lines of Rajputs, overturning men and women--their drawn swords\npointing this way and that--their dark eyes gleaming. Without a word\nto any one they rode up to the image, where the priests stood in an\nastonished herd.\n\n\"Fron-tt farm! Rear rank--'bout-face!\" barked the Risaldar, and there\nwas another clattering and stamping on the stone floor as the panting\nchargers pranced into the fresh formation, back to back.\n\n\"The memsahib!\" growled Mahommed Khan. \"Where is she?\"\n\n\"My son!\" said the High Priest. \"Bring me my son!\"\n\n\"A life for a life! Thy heavenborn first!\"\n\n\"Nay! Show me my son first!\"\n\nThe Risaldar leaped from his horse and tossed his reins to the man\nbehind him. In a second his sword was at the High Priest's throat.\n\n\"Where is that secret stair?\" he growled. \"Lead on!\"\n\nThe swordpoint pricked him. Two priests tried to interfere, but wilted\nand collapsed with fright as four fierce, black-bearded Rajputs spurred\ntheir horses forward. The swordpoint pricked still deeper.\n\n\"My son!\" said the High Priest.\n\n\"A life for a life! Lead on!\"\n\nThe High Priest surrendered, with a dark and cunning look, though, that\nhinted at something or other in reserve. He pulled at a piece of\ncarving on the wail behind and pointed to a stair that showed behind\nthe outswung door. Then he plucked another priest by the sleeve and\nwhispered.\n\nThe priest passed on the whisper. A third priest turned and ran.\n\n\"That way!\" said the High Priest, pointing.\n\n\"I? Nay! I go not down!\" He raised his voice into an ululating howl. \"O\nSuliman!\" he bellowed. \"Suliman! O!--Suliman! Bring up the heaven-born!\"\n\nA growl like the distant rumble from a bear-pit answered him. Then Ruth\nBellairs' voice was heard calling up the stairway.\n\n\"Is that you, Mahommed Khan?\"\n\n\"Ay, memsahib!\"\n\n\"Good! I'm coming!\"\n\nShe had recovered far enough to climb the ladder and the steep stone\nstair above it, and Suliman climbed up behind her, grumbling dreadful\nprophecies of what would happen to the priests now that Mohammed Khan\nhad come.\n\n\"Is all well, Risaldar?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Nay, heavenborn! All is not well yet! The general sahib from Jundhra\nand your husband's guns and others, making one division, are engaged\nwith rebels eight or nine miles from here. We saw part of the battle as\nwe rode!\"\n\n\"Who wins?\"\n\n\"It is doubtful, heavenborn! How could we tell from this distance?\"\n\n\"Have you a horse for me?\"\n\n\"Ay, heavenborn! Here! Bring up that horse, thou, and Suliman's! Ride\nhim cross-saddle, heavenborn--there were no side-saddles in Siroeh! Nay,\nhe is just a little frightened. He will stand--he will not throw thee!\nI did better than I thought, heavenborn. I come with four-and-twenty,\nmaking twenty-six with me and Suliman. An escort for a queen! So--sit\nhim quietly. Leave the reins free. Suliman will lead him! Ho! Fronnnt!\nRank--'bout-face!\"\n\n\"My son!\" wailed the High Priest. \"Where is my son?\"\n\n\"Tell him, Suliman!\"\n\n\"Where I caught thee, thou idol-briber!\" snarled the Risaldar's\nhalf-brother.\n\n\"Where? In that den of stinks. Gagged and bound all this while?\"\n\n\"Ha! Gagged and bound and out of mischief where all priests and\npriests' sons ought to be!\" laughed Mahommed Khan. \"Farward! Farm twos\nTer-r-r-ott!\"\n\nIn went the spur, and the snorting, rattling, clanking cavalcade sidled\nand pranced out of the temple into the sunshine, with Ruth and Suliman\nin the midst of them.\n\n\"Gallop!\" roared the Risaldar, the moment that the last horse was clear\nof the temple-doors. And in that instant he saw what the High Priest's\nwhispering had meant.\n\nComing up the street toward them was a horde of silent, hurrying Hindus,\narmed with swords and spears, wearing all of them the caste-marks of\nthe Brahman--well-fed, indignant relations of the priests, intent on\navenging the defilement of Kharvani's temple.\n\n\"Canter! Fronnnt--farm--Gallop! Charge!\"\n\nRuth found herself in the midst of a whirlwind of flashing sabers,\nastride of a lean-flanked Katiawari gelding that could streak like\nan antelope, knee to knee with a pair of bearded Rajputs, one of whom\ngripped her bridle-rein--thundering down a city street straight for a\nhundred swords that blocked her path. She set her eyes on the middle of\nMahommed Khan's straight back, gripped the saddle with both hands, set\nher teeth and waited for the shock. Mahommed Khan's right arm rose and\nhis sword flashed in the sunlight as he stood up in his stirrups. She\nshut her eyes. But there was no shock! There was the swish of whirling\nsteel, the thunder of hoofs, the sound of bodies falling. There was a\nscream or two as well and a coarse-mouthed Rajput oath. But when she\ndared to open her eyes once more they were thundering still, headlong\ndown the city street and Mahommed Khan was whirling his sword in mid-air\nto shake the blood from it.\n\nAhead lay the city gate and she could see another swarm of Hindus\nrushing from either side to close it. But \"Charge!\" yelled Mahommed Khan\nagain, and they swept through the crowd, through the half-shut gate, out\non the plain beyond, as a wind sweeps through the forest, leaving fallen\ntree-trunks in its wake.\n\n\"Halt!\" roared the Risaldar, when they were safely out of range. \"Are\nany hurt? No? Good for us that their rifles are all in the firing-line\nyonder!\"\n\nHe sat for a minute peering underneath his hand at the distant, dark,\nserried mass of men and the steel-tipped lines beyond it, watching the\nbelching cannon and the spurting flames of the close-range rifle-fire.\n\n\"See, heavenborn!\" he said, pointing. \"Those will be your husband's\nguns! See, over on the left, there. See! They fire! Those two! We can\nreach them if we make a circuit on the flank here!\"\n\n\"But can we get through, Risaldar? Won't they see us and cut us off?\"\n\n\"Heavenborn!\" he answered, \"men who dare ride into a city temple and\nsnatch thee from the arms of priests dare and can do anything! Take\nthis, heavenborn--take it as a keepsake, in case aught happens!\"\n\nHe drew off the priest's ring, gave it to her and then, before she could\nreply:\n\n\"Canter!\" he roared. The horses sprang forward in answer to the spurs\nand there was nothing for Ruth to do but watch the distant battle and\nlisten to the deep breathing of the Rajputs on either hand.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nThere could be no retreat that day and no thought of it. Jundhra and\nDoonha were in ruins. The bridges were down behind them and Hanadra lay\nahead. The British had to win their way into it or perish. Tired out,\nbreakfastless, suffering from the baking heat, the long, thin\nBritish line had got--not to hold at bay but to smash and pierce--an\nover-whelming force of Hindus that was stiffened up and down its length\nby small detachments of native soldiers who had mutinied.\n\nNumbers were against them, and even superiority of weapons was not so\noverwhelmingly in their favor, for those were the days of short-range\nrifle-fire and smoothbore artillery, and one gun was considerably like\nanother. The mutinous sepoys had their rifles with them; there were\nguns from the ramparts of Hanadra that were capable of quite efficient\nservice at close range; and practically every man in the dense-packed\nrebel line had a firearm of some kind. It was only in cavalry and\ndiscipline and pluck that the British force had the advantage, and the\ncavalry had already charged once and had been repulsed.\n\nGeneral Turner rode up and down the sweltering firing-line, encouraging\nthe men when it seemed to him they needed it and giving directions to\nhis officers. He was hidden from view oftener than not by the\nrolling clouds of smoke and he popped up here and there suddenly and\nunexpectedly. Wherever he appeared there was an immediate stiffening\namong the ranks, as though he carried a supply of spare enthusiasm with\nhim and could hand it out.\n\nColonel Carter, commanding the right wing, turned his head for a second\nat the sound of a horse's feet and found the general beside him.\n\n\"Had I better have my wounded laid in a wagon, sir?\" he suggested, \"in\ncase you find it necessary to fall back?\"\n\n\"There will be no retreat!\" said General Turner. \"Leave your wounded\nwhere they are. I never saw a cannon bleed before. How's that?\"\n\nHe spurred his horse over to where one of Bellairs' guns was being run\nforward into place again and Colonel Carter followed him. There was\nblood dripping from the muzzle of it.\n\n\"We're short of water, sir!\" said Colonel Carter.\n\nAnd as he spoke a gunner dipped his sponge into a pool of blood and\nrammed it home.\n\nBellairs was standing between his two guns, looking like the shadow of\nhimself, worn out with lack of sleep, disheveled, wounded. There was\nblood dripping from his forehead and he wore his left arm in a sling\nmade from his shirt.\n\n\"Fire!\" he ordered, and the two guns barked in unison and jumped back\ntwo yards or more.\n\n\"If you'll look,\" said General Turner, plucking at the colonel's\nsleeve, \"you'll see a handful of native cavalry over yonder behind the\nenemy--rather to the enemy's left--there between those two clouds of\nsmoke. D'you see them?\"\n\n\"They look like Sikhs or Rajputs,\" said the colonel.\n\n\"Yes. Don't they? I'd like you to keep an eye on them. They've come\nup from the rear. I caught sight of them quite a while ago and I can't\nquite make them out. It's strange, but I can't believe that they belong\nto the enemy. D'you see?--there--they've changed direction. They're\nriding as though they intended to come round the enemy's left flank!\"\n\n\"By gad, they are! Look! The enemy are moving to cut them off!\"\n\n\"I must get back to the other wing!\" said General Turner. \"But that\nlooks like the making of an opportunity! Keep both eyes lifting, Carter,\nand advance the moment you see any confusion in the enemy's ranks.\"\n\nHe rode off, and Colonel Carter stared long and steadily at the\napproaching horsemen. He saw a dense mass of the enemy, about a thousand\nstrong, detach itself from the left wing and move to intercept them, and\nhe noticed that the movement made a tremendous difference to the ranks\nopposed to him. He stepped up to young Bellairs and touched his sleeve.\nBellairs started like a man roused from a dream.\n\n\"That's your wife over there!\" said Colonel Carter. \"There can't be any\nother white woman here-abouts riding with a Rajput escort!\"\n\nBellairs gripped the colonel's outstretched arm.\n\n\"Where?\" he almost screamed. \"Where? I don't see her!\"\n\n\"There, man! There, where that mass of men is moving! Look! By the Lord\nHarry! He's charging right through the mob! That's Mahommed Khan, I'll\nbet a fortune! Now's our chance Bugler!\"\n\nThe bugler ran to him, and he began to puff into his instrument.\n\n\"Blow the 'attention' first!\"\n\nOut rang the clear, strident notes, and the non-commissioned officers\nand men took notice that a movement of some kind would shortly be\nrequired of them, but the din of firing never ceased for a single\ninstant. Then, suddenly, an answering bugle sang out from the other\nflank.\n\n\"Advance in echelon!\" commanded Colonel Carter, and the bugler did his\nbest to split his cheeks in a battle-rending blast.\n\n\"You remain where you are, sir!\" he ordered young Bellairs. \"Keep your\nguns served to the utmost!\"\n\nSix-and-twenty horsemen, riding full-tilt at a thousand men, may look\nlike a trifle, but they are disconcerting. What they hit, they kill; and\nif they succeed in striking home, they play old Harry with formations.\nAnd Risaldar Mahommed Khan did strike home. He changed direction\nsuddenly and, instead of using up his horses' strength in outflanking\nthe enemy, who had marched to intercept him, and making a running target\nof his small command, he did the unexpected--which is the one best thing\nto do in war. He led his six-and-twenty at a headlong gallop straight\nfor the middle of the crowd--it could not be called by any military\nname. They fired one ragged volley at him and then had no time to\nload before he was in the middle of them, clashing right and left and\npressing forward. They gave way, right and left, before him, and a good\nnumber of them ran. Half a hundred of them were cut down as they fled\ntoward their firing-line. At that second, just as the Risaldar and his\nhandful burst through the mob and the mob began rushing wildly out\nof his way, the British bugles blared out the command to advance in\nechelon.\n\nThe Indians were caught between a fire and a charge that they had good\nreason to fear in front of them, and a disturbance on their left flank\nthat might mean anything. As one-half of them turned wildly to face what\nmight be coming from this unexpected quarter, the British troops came\non with a roar, and at the same moment Mahommed Khan reached the rear of\ntheir firing-line and crashed headlong into it.\n\nIn a second the whole Indian line was in confusion and in another minute\nit was in full retreat not knowing nor even guessing what had routed it.\nRetreat grew into panic and panic to stampede and, five minutes after\nthe Risaldar's appearance on the scene, half of the Indian line was\nrushing wildly for Hanadra and the other half was retiring sullenly in\ncomparatively dense and decent order.\n\nBellairs could not see all that happened. The smoke from his own guns\nobscured the view, and the necessity for giving orders to his men\nprevented him from watching as he would have wished. But he saw\nthe Rajputs burst out through the Indian ranks and he saw his own\ncharger--Shaitan the unmistakable--careering across the plain toward him\nriderless.\n\n\"For the love of God!\" he groaned, raising both fists to heaven, \"has\nshe got this far, and then been killed! Oh, what in Hades did I entrust\nher to an Indian for? The pig-headed, brave old fool! Why couldn't he\nride round them, instead of charging through?\"\n\nAs he groaned aloud, too wretched even to think of what his duty was, a\ngalloper rode up to him.\n\n\"Bring up your guns, sir, please!\" he ordered. \"You're asked to hurry!\nTake up position on that rising ground and warm up the enemy's retreat!\"\n\n\"Limber up!\" shouted Bellairs, coming to himself again. Fifteen seconds\nlater his two guns were thundering up the rise.\n\nAs he brought them to \"action front\" and tried to collect his thoughts\nto figure out the range, a finger touched his shoulder and he turned to\nsee another artillery officer standing by him.\n\n\"I've been lent from another section,\" he explained: \"You're wanted.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Over there, where you see Colonel Carter standing. It's your wife wants\nyou, I think!\"\n\nBellairs did not wait for explanations. He sent for his horse and\nmounted and rode across the intervening space at a breakneck gallop that\nhe could barely stop in time to save himself from knocking the colonel\nover. A second later he was in Ruth's arms.\n\n\"I thought you were dead when I saw Shaitan!\" he said. He was nearly\nsobbing.\n\n\"No, Mahommed Khan rode him,\" she answered, and she made no pretense\nabout not sobbing. She was crying like a child.\n\n\"Salaam, Bellairs sahib!\" said a weak voice close to him. He noticed\nColonel Carter bending over a prostrate figure, lifting the head up\non his knee. There were three Rajputs standing between, though, and he\ncould not see whose the figure was.\n\n\"Come over here!\" said Colonel Carter, and young Bellairs obeyed him,\nleaving Ruth sitting on the ground where she was.\n\n\"Wouldn't you care to thank Mohammed Khan?\" It was a little cruel of the\ncolonel to put quite so much venom in his voice, for, when all is said\nand done: a man has almost a right to be forgetful when he has just had\nhis young wife brought him out of the jaws of death. At least he has a\ngood excuse for it. The sting of the reproof left him bereft of words\nand he stood looking down at the old Risaldar, saying nothing and\nfeeling very much ashamed.\n\n\"Salaam, Bellairs sahib!\" The voice was growing feebler. \"I would have\ndone more for thy father's son! Thou art welcome. Aie! But thy charger\nis a good one! Good-by! Time is short, and I would talk with the colonel\nsahib!\"\n\nHe waved Bellairs away with a motion of his hand and the lieutenant went\nback to his wife again.\n\n\"He sent me away just like that, too!\" she told him. \"He said he had no\ntime left to talk to women!\"\n\nColonel Carter bent down again above the Risaldar, and listened to as\nmuch as he had time to tell of what had happened.\n\n\"But couldn't you have ridden round them, Risaldar?\" he asked them.\n\n\"Nay, sahib! It was touch and go! I gave the touch! I saw as I rode how\nclose the issue was and I saw my chance and took it! Had the memsahib\nbeen slain, she had at least died in full view of the English--and there\nwas a battle to be won. What would you? I am a soldier--I.\"\n\n\"Indeed you are!\" swore Colonel Carter.\n\n\"Sahib! Call my sons!\"\n\nHis sons were standing near him, but the colonel called up his\ngrandsons, who had been told to stand at a little distance off. They\nclustered round the Risaldar in silence, and he looked them over and\ncounted them.\n\n\"All here?\" he asked.\n\n\"All here!\"\n\n\"Whose sons and grandsons are ye?\"\n\n\"Thine!\" came the chorus.\n\n\"This sahib says that having done my bidding and delivered her ye rode\nto rescue, ye are no more bound to the Raj. Ye may return to your homes\nif ye wish.\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n\"Ye may fight for the rebels, if ye wish! There will be a safe-permit\nwritten.\"\n\nAgain there was no answer.\n\n\"For whom, then, fight ye?\"\n\n\"For the Raj!\" The deep-throated answer rang out promptly from every\none of them, and they stood with their sword-hilts thrust out toward the\ncolonel. He rose and touched each hilt in turn.\n\n\"They are now thy servants!\" said the Risaldar, laying his head back.\n\"It is good! I go now. Give my salaams to General Turner sahib!\"\n\n\"Good-by, old war-dog!\" growled the colonel, in an Anglo-Saxon effort to\ndisguise emotion. He gripped at the right hand that was stretched out on\nthe ground beside him, but it was lifeless.\n\nRisaldar Mahommed Khan, two-medal man and pensionless\ngentleman-at-large, had gone to turn in his account of how he had\nremembered the salt which he had eaten.\n\n\n\n\nMACHASSAN AH\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nWaist-held in the chains and soused in the fifty-foot-high spray, Joe\nByng eyed his sounding lead that swung like a pendulum below him, and\nnamed it sacrilege.\n\n\"This 'ere navy ain't a navy no more,\" he muttered. \"This 'ere's a\nschool-gal promenade, 'and-in-'and, an' mind not to get your little\ntrotters wet, that's what this is, so 'elp me two able seamen an' a red\nmarine!\"\n\nFrom the moment that the lookout, lashed to the windlass drum up\nforward, had spied the little craft away to leeward and had bellowed his\nreport of it through hollowed hands between the thunder of the waves,\nJoe Byng had had premonitory symptoms of uneasiness. He had felt in his\nbones that the navy was about to be nose-led into shame.\n\nAt the wheel, both eyes on the compass, as the sea law bids, but both\nears on the more-even-than-usual-alert, Curley Crothers felt the same\nsensations but expressed them otherwise.\n\n\"Admiral's orders!\" he muttered. \"Maybe the admiral was drunk?\"\n\nThe brass gongs clanged down in the bowels of H.M.S. Puncher and she\ngradually lost what little weigh she had, rolling her bridge ends under\nin the heave and hollow of a beam-on monsoon sea.\n\n\"How much does he say he wants?\" asked her commander.\n\nJoe Byng in the chains and Curley Crothers at the wheel both recognized\nthe quarter tone instantly, and diagnosed it with deadly accuracy;\nevery vibration of his voice and every fiber of his being expressed\nexasperation, though a landsman might have noticed no more than contempt\nfor what he had seen fit to log as \"half a gale.\"\n\n\"He says he'll take us in for fifty pounds, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh! Tell him to make it shillings, or else to get out of my course!\"\n\nIt is not much in the way of Persian Gulf Arabic that a man picks\nup from textbooks but at garnering the business end of beach-born\ndialects--the end that gets results at least expense of time\nor energy--the Navy goes even the Army half a dozen better. The\nsublieutenant's argument, bawled from the bridge rail to the reeling\nlittle boat below, was a marvel in its own sweet way; it combined abuse\nand scorn with a cataclysmic blast of threat in six explosive sentences.\n\n\"He says he'll take us in for ten pounds, sir,\" he reported, without the\nvestige of a smile.\n\n\"Oh! Ask Mr. Hartley to step up on the bridge, will you?\"\n\nTwo minutes later, during which the nasal howls from the boat were\nutterly ignored, the acting chief engineer hauled himself along the rail\nhand over hand to windward, ducking below the canvas guard as a more\nthan usually big comber split against the Puncher's side and hove itself\nto heaven.\n\n\"It beats me how any man can keep a coat on him this weather,\" he\nremarked, and the sublieutenant noticed that the streams that ran down\nboth his temples were not sea water. \"Send for me?\"\n\nHis temper, judging by his voice, would seem to be a lot worse than\ncould be due to the pitching of the ship.\n\n\"Yes. There's a pilot overside, and our orders are to take a pilot\naboard when running in, if available. There are three men bailing that\nboat below there, and the sea's gaining on them. They'll need rescuing\nwithin two hours. Then we'd have a pilot aboard and would have saved the\ngovernment ten pounds. Point is, can you manage in the engine-room for\ntwo or three hours longer? Three more waves like that last one and the\nman's ours anyway!\"\n\n\"He might not wait two hours,\" suggested Mr. Hartley. \"He might get\ntired of looking at us, and beat back into port. Then where would be\nyour strategy?\"\n\n\"Then there wouldn't be a pilot available. I'd be justified in going in\nwithout one. Point is, can you hold out below?\"\n\n\"Man,\" said Mr. Hartley, \"you're a genius.\" He peered through the spray\ndown to leeward, where the pilot's boat danced a death dance alongside,\nheel and toe to the Puncher's statelier swing. \"Yes; there are three men\nbailing, and you're a genius. But no! The answer's no! The engines'll\nkeep on turning, maybe and perhaps, until we make the shelter o' yon\nreef. There's no knowing what a cherry-red bearing will do. I can give\nye maybe fifteen knots; maybe a leetle more for just five minutes, for\nsteerage way and luck, and after that--\"\n\nEven crouched as he was against the canvas guard he contrived to shrug\nhis shoulders.\n\n\"But if we go in there are you sure you can contrive to patch her up? It\nlooks like a rotten passage, and not much of a berth beyond it.\"\n\n\"I could cool her down.\"\n\n\"Oh, if that's all you want, I can anchor outside in thirty fathoms.\"\n\nCurley Crothers heard that and his whole frame stiffened; there seemed\na chance yet that the Navy might not be disgraced. But it faded on the\ninstant.\n\n\"Man, we've got to go inside and we've got to hurry! Better in there\nthan at the bottom of the Gulf! Put her where she'll hold still for a\nday, or maybe two days--\"\n\n\"Say a month!\" suggested the commander caustically.\n\n\"Say three days for the sake of argument. Then I can put her to rights.\nI daren't take down a thing while she's rolling twenty-five and more,\nand I've got to take things down! Why, man, the engine-room is all\npollution from gratings to bilge; if I loosened one more bolt than is\nloose a'ready her whole insides 'ud take charge and dance quadrilles\nuntil we drowned!\"\n\n\"You won't try to make Bombay?\"\n\n\"I'll try to give ye steam as far as the far side o' yon reef. After\nthat I wash my hands of a' responsibility!\"\n\n\"Oh, very well. Mr. White!\"\n\nThe sublieutenant hauled himself in turn to windward. Curley Crothers\ngave the wheel a half-spoke and looked as if he had no interest in\nanything. Joe Byng in the chains bowed his head and groaned inwardly;\nhis sticky, spray-washed lead seemed all-absorbing.\n\n\"Tell that black robber to hurry aboard, unless he wants me to come in\nwithout him.\"\n\nThe little boat had drifted fast before the wind, and the sublieutenant\nhad to bellow through a megaphone to where the three men bailed and the\nragged oarsmen swung their weight against the storm. The man of ebony,\nwho would be pilot and disgrace the Navy, balanced on a thwart with\nwide-spread naked toes and yelled an ululating answer. With his rags\nout-blown in the monsoon he looked like a sea wraith come to life. The\nbig gongs clanged again, and the Puncher drifted rather than drove down\non the smaller craft. A hand line caught the pilot precisely in the\nface. He grabbed it frantically, fell headlong in the sea, and was\nhauled aboard.\n\n\"He says he wants a tow for that boat of his,\" reported the\nsublieutenant. \"Said it in English, too--seems he knows more than he\npretends.\"\n\n\"Missed it, by gad, by just about five minutes!\" said the commander\naloud but to himself. \"Well--the bargain's made, so it can't be helped.\nThat boat's sinking! Throw 'em a line, quick!\"\n\nThe pilot's crew displayed no overdone affection for their craft, and\nthere was no struggle to the last to leave it. One by one--whichever\ncould grab the line first was the first to come--they were hauled\nthrough the thundering waves and their boat was left to sink. Then,\nbefore they could adjust their unaccustomed feet to the different\nbalance of the Puncher's heaving deck, the gongs clanged and the\ndestroyer leaped ahead like a dripping sea-soused water beetle, into her\nutmost speed that instant.\n\nAll conscious of his new-won dignity, and utterly regardless of his\nboat, the pilot had found the bridge at once. He clung to the rail there\nand braced one naked foot against a stanchion. To him the ship's speed\nseemed the all-absorbing thing, for either Mr. Hartley had forgotten\njust how many revolutions would make fifteen knots or else he had\nunderestimated his engine-room's capacity. The Puncher split the waves\nand spewed them twenty feet above her, racing head-on for the reef,\nand Curley Crothers was too busy at his wheel to pass the pilot the\nsurreptitious insult he intended.\n\nThe gongs clanged presently, and the Puncher swallowed half her speed at\nonce, giving the pilot courage.\n\n\"This exceedingly damn dangerous place, sah!\" he remarked.\n\n\"No bottom at eight!\" sang Joe Byng in the chains.\n\nThree words passed between the commander and Crothers, and the Puncher\nhove a weed-draped underside high over the crest of a beam-on roller as\nshe veered a dozen points, ducked her starboard rail into the trough\nof it, and sliced her long thin nose, sizzling and swirling, into the\nwelter ahead. It was growing weedier and dirtier each minute.\n\n\"No bottom at eight!\" chanted Joe Byng.\n\nAnd at the sound of his voice the pilot hauled himself up by his\nleverage on the rail and found his voice again.\n\n\"This most exceedingly damn dangerous place, sah!\"\n\nBut the commander was too busy acting all three L's--Log, Lead and\nLookout--his shrouded figure swaying to the heave and fall and his eyes\nfixed straight ahead of him on the double line of boiling foam. He had\nconned his course and had it charted in his head. There was no time to\nargue with a pilot.\n\n\"Port you-ah hel-um, sah! Port you-ah hel-um!\"\n\n\"By the mark--seven!\" sang Joe Byng from the chains.\n\n\"Port you-ah hel-um, sah!\" yelled the pilot in an ecstasy of fright.\n\n\"Starboard a little,\" came the quiet command.\n\nCurley Crothers moved his wheel and the Puncher's bow yawed twenty feet,\nas if Providence had pushed her.\n\n\"Gawd A'mighty!\" murmured Joe Byng, gazing open-mouthed at fifty feet of\njagged rock that grinned up suddenly three waves away.\n\nThe pilot braced both feet against a stanchion and tried to take the\nweigh off her by pulling.\n\n\"Half speed, sah! Go slow, sah! Go dead slow, sah! You'll pile up you-ah\ndamn ship, sah! Ah tell you, sah, you'll pile her up as suah as hell,\nsah! 'Bout a million sharks round he-ah, sah! For the love o' God,\nsah--Captain, sah--\"\n\n\"Oh, muzzle him, some one!\" ordered the commander, and the jiggling,\ncomplaining engines danced ahead, the horrid gray beneath the pilot's\nebony notwithstanding.\n\n\"By the deep--four!\" warned Joe Byng in a level sing-song. The two gongs\nclanged like an echo to him, and the Puncher's speed was reduced at\nonce to her point, of minimum stability. She rolled and quivered like\na living thing in fear, falling on and off, nosing out a passage on her\nown account apparently, and seeming to be gathering all her strength for\none tremendous effort.\n\n\"That's bettah, sah! That's bettah, Captain, sah! Go astern! This\nhe-ah's the bar, sah--damn bad place, the bar, sah! Go astern, sah.\nCaptain, sah, d'you he-ah me--go astern! Try again, 'nother place\nfurther up, sah. Captain, sah! Over that way; that way thar--that way,\nsah!\"\n\nHe pointed through the sky-flung spray with a trembling finger and his\nvoice was rich with doleful emphasis, but the commander held his course\nand carried on. There seemed neither sympathy nor understanding on\nthat unsteadiest of ships. Curley Crothers, solemn-faced as Nemesis and\nlooking half as compassionate, moved his wheel a trifle. Joe Byng in\nthe chains kept up his even sing-song, expressionless, as if he were an\nautomatic clock that did not care, but must record the truth each time\nhis dripping pendulum touched bottom.\n\n\"And a half--three!\"\n\nWhite foam was boiling in among the dirty welter, and the Puncher's bow\npitched suddenly as the first big bar wave lifted her; a second later\nher propellers chug-chug-chugged in surface spume as she kicked upward\nlike a porpoise diving.\n\n\"Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy!\" groaned the pilot. \"This he-ah watah's full\nof sharks, an' that's the bar! You're on the bar now, Captain, sah!\"\n\n\"By the mark--three!\" Byng chanted steadily.\n\n\"Starboard a little more,\" said the commander leaning forward and\nshoving the pilot away to leeward at the same time. Then he shouted to\nthe fo'castle head, where a bosun's mate and his crew had climbed and\nwere awaiting orders in evident and most unreasonable unconcern.\n\n\"Get both anchors ready!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" came the answer, and efficiency controlled by experts\nproceeded at kaleidoscopic angles to defy the elements. The big steel\nhooks were ready in an instant.\n\n\"Stop her!\" ordered the commander.\n\nThe gongs clanged out an alarm and the throbbing ceased.\n\n\"Hard astern, both engines!\"\n\nAgain there was a clangor under hatches, and the suffering bearings\nshrieked. The Puncher dropped her stern two feet or so, and the foam\nboiled brown round her propellers. The shock of the reversal pitched the\npilot up against the forward rail, where he clung like a drowning man.\n\n\"For the love o' God, sah! Captain; sah, we've struck! Ah told you so;\nAh said--\"\n\n\"And a half-three!\" chanted Joe Byng.\n\n\"Stop her! Starboard engine ahead! Port engine ahead! Ease your helm!\nMeet her! Half speed ahead!\"\n\nThe Puncher pitched and rolled, kicking at the following monsoon that\nthundered at her counter and tossing up the foam that seethed about her\nbow. She trembled from end to end, as if the pounding of the water hurt\nher.\n\n\"Helm amidships!\" ordered the commander suddenly.\n\n\"'Midships, sir!\"\n\n\"Full speed ahead, both engines!\"\n\nThe Puncher leaped, as all destroyers do the second day they are loosed.\nShe sliced through the storm straight for the coral beach beyond the\nbar, shaking her graceful shoulders free of the sticky spray--reeling,\nrolling, thugging, kicking, bucking through the welter to where\nquiet water waited and the ever-lasting, utterly unrighteous stink of\nsun-baked Arab beaches. As each tremendous breaker thundered on her\nstern each time she lifted to the underswell, the pilot vowed that\nshe had struck, rolling his eyes and calling two different deities to\nwitness that none of it was any fault of his.\n\n\"Thar's no water, sah--no water, Captain, sah--not one drop! You've\npiled up you-ah ship! Ah told you so; Ah said--\"\n\n\"By the deep--four!\"\n\n\"And a half-four!\"\n\n\"By the mark--five!\"\n\nThe Puncher was across the bar, gliding through muddy water on an even\nkeel and giving the lie direct to him whose fee was ten pounds English.\nThe pilot drew a talisman of some kind from underneath the least torn\nportion of his shirt, and to the commander's amazement kissed it. It is\nnot often that a woolly headed, or any other, native of the East kisses\neither folk or things. But the commander was too busy at the moment to\nask questions.\n\n\"Have your starboard anchor ready!\" he commanded, making mental notes.\n\n\"Ready, sir!\"\n\nThe glittering, wet, wind-blown beach and the little estuary slid by\nlike a painted panorama smelling of all the evil in the world as the\nPuncher eased her helm a time or two seeking a comfortable berth with\nJoe Byng's chanted aid.\n\n\"Let go twenty fathoms!\"\n\nThe pilot sighed relief as the starboard anchor splashed into the water\nand the cable roared after it through the hawse pipe.\n\n\"What nationality are you?\" asked the commander, watching the Puncher\nswing and gaging distances, but sparing one eye now for his unwelcome\nbut official guest.\n\n\"Me, sah?\"\n\n\"Yes, you.\"\n\nThe pilot looked anywhere but at his questioner, and a picture passed\nbefore the commander's eyes--a memory, perhaps, of something he had\nread about at school--of Christians in Nero's day being asked what their\nreligion was.\n\n\"Are you afraid to tell me?\" he asked, softening his voice to a kinder\ntone as he remembered that God did not make all men Englishmen, and\nturning just in time to cause Crothers to withdraw his right leg.\n\nThe pilot's toes were, after all, not destined to be trodden on just\nthen.\n\n\"No, sah, Ah'm not afraid.\"\n\n\"What are you, then?\"\n\n\"Ah'm--\"\n\n\"Well? What?\"\n\n\"Ah'm English!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Captain, sah, Ah'm English!\"\n\n\"Oh! Are you? Um-m-m! Mr. White, give this man his ten pounds, will you?\nAnd get his receipt for it.\"\n\nThat appeared to end matters, so far as the commander was concerned;\nofficial dignity forbade any further interest. But it was not so very\nlong since Mr. White was senior midshipman, and it takes a man until\nhe is admiral of the fleet to unlearn all he knew then and forget the\ncuriosity of those days.\n\n\"Now, I should have thought you were a Scotchman,\" he suggested without\nsmiling, studying the salt-encrusted wrinkles on the ebony face. \"You\nlike whisky?\"\n\n\"Yes, sah--positively, sah! Yes, Captain, sah--Ah do!\"\n\nMr. White sent for whisky and poured out a stiff four fingers, to the\nawful disgust of Curley Crothers, who saw the whole transaction. The\npilot consumed it so instantly that there seemed never to have been any\nin the glass.\n\n\"I suppose your name's Macnab--or Macphairson--which? Sign here,\nplease.\"\n\nThe pilot took the proffered pen in unaccustomed fingers and made a\ncrisscross scrawl, adorned with thirteen blots. The pen nib broke\nunder the strain, and he handed it back with an air of confidential\nremonstrance.\n\n\"That thing's no mo-ah good,\" he volunteered.\n\n\"So I see. Now tell me your name in full, so that I can write it next to\nthe mark. It's a wonder of a mark! Mac--what's the rest of it?\"\n\n\"Hassan Ah.\"\n\n\"Machassan?\"\n\n\"No, sah. Hassan Ah.\"\n\n\"And you're English?\"\n\n\"Yes, sah.\"\n\n\"With that name?\"\n\n\"Mah name makes no diffunts, sah. Ah'm English.\"\n\n\"Well--here's your money. Cutter away, there! Put the pilot and his crew\nashore! Sorry about your boat, pilot, but it couldn't be helped.\"\n\n\"Makes me believe that I'm a nigger!\" muttered Curley Crothers, not yet\nreleased from duty on the bridge.\n\n\"First time I ever wished I was a Dutchman!\" swore Joe Byng, coiling up\nhis sounding line.\n\nTen minutes later the cutter's captain swung the boat's stern in shore\nwhen he judged that he was reasonably near enough and too far in for\nsharks. He had his orders to put the pilot and his crew ashore, but the\nmeans had not been too exactly specified.\n\n\"Get out and swim for it, you bally Englishman!\" he ordered, using a\nboat-hook on the nearest one to make his meaning clear.\n\nOne by one they jumped for it, the pilot going last. He plainly did not\nunderstand the point of view.\n\n\"Ah'm English!\" he expostulated. \"Lissen he-ah, Ah'm English! Damwell\nEnglish!\"\n\n\"All right; let's see you swim, English!\" jeered the cutter's captain,\nand the pilot took the water with a splash.\n\n\"Ah su-ah am English!\" he vowed, as he swam for the shore, and he stood\nby the sea's edge repeating his assertion with a leathery pair of lungs\nuntil the cutter had rowed out of ear-shot.\n\n\"English, is he?\" said Joe Byng to Curley Crothers in the fo'castle,\nnot twenty minutes later. \"I'd show him, if I had him in here for twenty\nminutes!\"\n\n\"That fellow's interested me,\" said Crothers. \"He's got me thinking. I\nvote we investigate him.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Ashore, fathead.\"\n\n\"There'll be no shore leave.\"\n\n\"No? You left off being wet nurse to the dawg?\" \"I brush him, mornin's;\nif that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"Is he fit?\"\n\n\"Fit to fight a bumboat full o' pilots!\"\n\n\"Could he be sick for an hour?\"\n\n\"Might be did.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Morning?\"\n\n\"At about two bells?\"\n\n\"It could be done.\"\n\n\"Then do it!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because, Joe Byng my boy, you and I want shore leave; and the pup--and\nhe's a decent pup--must suffer for to make a 'tween-deck holiday. Get my\nmeaning? I've a propagandrum that'll work this tide. You go and set the\nfuse in the pup's inside; and mind you, time it right, my son--for two\nbells when the old man's in the chair!\"\n\nSo Joe Byng, who was something of an expert in the way and ways of\ndogs, departed in search of an oiler with whom he was on terms of\ncondescension; and he returned to the fo'castle a little later with\nthe nastiest, most awful-smelling mess that ever emanated even from the\nengine-room of a destroyer in the Persian Gulf (where grease and things\nrun rancid.)\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nLying lazily at anchor off the reeking beach of Adra Bight, the Puncher\nlooked peaceful and complacent--which is altogether opposite to what she\nand her commander were, or had been, for a month. The ship hummed her\nshut-in discontent, as a hive does when the bees propose to swarm, and\nher commander--who never, be it noted, went to windward of the one word\n\"damn\"--used that one word very frequently.\n\nHe sat \"abaft the mainmast\" at a table that was splotched already with\nabundant perspiration, and the acting engineer who stood in front of him\nshifted from foot to foot in attitudes expressive of increasing agony\nof mind. It grew obvious at last that there was a limit to Mr. Hartley's\nstore of courteous deference.\n\nThere had been news, red hot but wrong, of dhows loaded to the\nwater-line with guns and ammunition somewhere up the Gulf. India, ever\nfretful for her tribes beyond the border, had borrowed Applewaite and\nhis destroyer by instant cablegram, and jealously held records had been\nbroken while the Puncher quartered those indecent seas and heated up her\nbearings. It was almost too much to have to come back empty-handed. It\nwas quite too much to have to run for shelter under the lee of Adra's\nuninviting coral reef. And to be told by an acting engineer that\nhe would have to stay a week was utterly beyond the scope of polite\nconversation.\n\n\"Why a week?\" asked Commander Applewaite, with eyebrows raised to the\nnth power of incredulity.\n\n\"Why a week?\" asked Mr. Hartley, breaking down the barrier of\nself-restraint at last. \"I'll tell you why. Because, although the guts\nof her are so much scrap-iron, you've a crew of engineers who could\nbuild machinery of hell-slag--build it, mind--and could get steam out o'\nthe Sahara, where there isn't any water at all.\n\n\"Because--conditional upon the act o' God and your permission--I'm\nwilling to perform a miracle. Because the whole engine-room complement\nis dancing mad for shore leave, and there'll be none this side o'\nBombay; and because, in consequence o' that, creation would be a mild\nname for what's about to happen under gratings until the shafts revolve\nagain. Man, I wish ye'd take one peep at her bearings, though ye\nwouldn't understand.\n\n\"Because you're lucky; any other engineer in all the navies o' the world\nwould take a month to tinker with her, even if he didn't have to send to\nBombay for a tow. Because--\"\n\n\"That'll do!\" said Applewaite, his mind wandering already in search\nof suitable employment for the crew. \"Get the repairs done as soon as\npossible; we stay here until you have finished what is necessary.\"\n\nIt looked like an evil moment for asking favors, but it was the time\nlaid down in Regulations when such things as favors may be had; and\nit was the moment Curley Crothers had picked out for asking for shore\nleave.\n\n\"Come 'ere, Scamp. Come along, Scamp. Come along 'ere--good boy!\" he\ncoaxed, dragging by a short chain in his wake the sorriest-looking\nbull terrier that ever acted mascot in the British or any other navy.\nCourteous and huge and cap in hand, his weather-beaten face smiling\nrespectfully above a snow-white uniform, he took his stand before the\nlittle table. His outward bearing was one of certainty, but his\nshrewd, slightly puckered eyes alternately conned the expression of his\ncommander's face and watched the dog.\n\nThe lee, scuppers were the goal of the dog's immediate ambition, for he\nwas a well-brought-up dog and such of the decencies as were not his by\ninstinct he had learned by painful and repeated acquisition. But at the\nmoment Curley Crothers showed a wondrous disregard for etiquette.\n\n\"He's very sick, sir,\" he asserted, tugging a little at the chain in\nthe hope of producing instant proof of his contention. But the dog was\ngamiest of the game, and swallowed hurriedly.\n\n\"Well? I'm not a vet. What about it?\"\n\n\"The whole ship's crew 'ud be sorry, sir, if 'e was to lose 'is number.\nHe's the best mascot this ship ever had, by all accounts.\"\n\n\"He hasn't brought us much luck this run!\" smiled Applewaite,\nremembering a long list of \"previous convictions\" and wondering what\nCrothers might be up to next.\n\n\"No, sir? We're still a-top o' the water, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh! He gets the credit for that, eh? But for him, I suppose we'd have\npiled up on the reef yesterday?\"\n\n\"Saving your presence, sir.\"\n\nCurley Crothers made a gesture expressive of a world of compliment and\npraise, but he kept one eye steadily on the dog; he seemed to imply\nthat but for the presence of the dog on board the commander might have\nforgotten his seamanship.\n\n\"Well? What do you suggest?\"\n\n\"Seeing the poor dog's sick, sir, and you and all of us so fond of him,\nand all he needs is exercise, I thought perhaps as 'ow you'd order me\nan' Byng, sir, to take 'im for a run ashore. There'd be jackals and\npi-dogs for 'im to chase. A bit o' sport 'ud set 'im up in a jiffy. He's\nlanguishing--that's what's the matter with him.\"\n\nThere were almost tears in his voice as he tugged at the chain\nsurreptitiously, in a vain effort to produce the cataclysm that was\noverdue. But for all his efforts to appear affected, his eyes were\nsmiling. So were his commander's.\n\n\"Why Byng?\" he asked.\n\n\"Byng cleans him, sir. He knows Byng.\"\n\n\"Then, why you?\"\n\n\"Why; he knows me too, sir, and between the two of us, we'd manage him\nproper. S'posin' he was to get huntin' on his own and one of us was\ntired out chasin' him, t'other could run and catch him. If there was\nonly one of us, he couldn't.\"\n\n\"I see. Well? One of the other men might take him on the chain. A\ngood-conduct man, for instance.\"\n\nCrothers tugged at the chain, and the unhappy dog drew away toward the\nscuppers with all his remaining strength.\n\n\"He's cussed about the chain, sir--apt to drag on it and try to chaw it\nthrough. Besides, sir, when a dawg's sick, he's like a man--same as me\nan' you; he likes to 'ave 'is partic'lar pals with 'im. Now, that dawg's\nfond o' me an' Byng.'\n\n\"I see. But supposing exercise isn't what he wants after all? Suppose he\nneeds a long rest and lots of sleep? How about that?\"\n\nThe argument had reached a crisis, and Curley realized it. Joking or\nnot, when the commander of a ship takes too long in reaching a decision\nhe generally does not reach a favorable one. The leash was tugged\nagain, this time with some severity. The martyred Scamp was drawn on\nhis protesting haunches close to the official table, that the commander\nmight have a better view of his distress. And then the expected\nhappened--voluminously.\n\nCurley stood with an expression of wooden-headed, abject innocence on\nhis big, broad face, and looked straight in front of him.\n\n\"He certainly is sick, sir,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Sick. Good heavens! The dog's turning himself inside out! That's the\nlast time a thing like this happens; he's the last dog I ever take on\na cruise. Take him away at once! Bosun--call some one to wipe up that\ndisgusting mess!\"\n\n\"Take him ashore, did you say, sir?\"\n\n\"Take him out of this! Take him anywhere you like! Yes, take him ashore\nand lose him--feed him to the sharks--give him to the Arabs--take him\naway, that's all!\"\n\n\"Me and Byng, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, you and Byng! Did you hear me tell you to take him away?\"\n\n\"Very good, sir; thank you!\"\n\nCurley Crothers saluted without the vestige of a smile, and hurried\noff before the dog could show too early signs of recovering health and\nstrength or the commander could change his mind.\n\n\"Come on, Scamp,\" he whispered. \"That was nothing but a temporary\ndisaccommodation to your tummy, doglums; we'll soon have you to rights\nagain.\"\n\nHe dived into the fo'castle with the dog behind him, and there were\nthose who noticed that the terrier's whip-like tail no longer hugged his\nstomach, but was waving to the world at large.\n\nAnd thirty minutes later, as the Puncher's launch put off with Curley\nand Joe Byng comfortably seated in the stern, it was obvious to any one\nwho cared to look that Scamp was the happiest and healthiest terrier in\nAsia.\n\n\"Now, I wonder what they did to him,\" mused the Puncher's commander,\nwatching from beneath his awning. \"Those two men live up to the name\nthey brought aboard! I believe they'd find means and a good excuse for\nwalking to windward of a First Sea Lord!\"\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nNow an Arab would as soon allow a dog to lick his face as he would think\nof eating pork in public with his women folk; so the bearded, hook-nosed\nbelievers in the Prophet who looked down from the rock wall that lines\none side of Adra knew what to think of Curley and his friend Joe Byng\nlong before either of them realized that they were being watched.\n\nArrayed from head to ankles in spotless white, their black boots looking\nblacker by comparison, they proceeded in the general direction of the\ndistant village, with the order and decorum of sea lords descending on\na dockyard for inspection purposes. The trackless sand proved hot\nand sharp; the dog proved in poor condition from the voyage and the\nmorning's incidental martyrdom, and Byng was generous-hearted. He\npicked up the dog and carried him; and Scamp displayed his gratitude in\ncustomary canine way.\n\nThe comments of the watching Arabs would not fit into any story in the\nworld, and it is quite as well that Crothers and Joe Byng did not hear\nthem and could not have translated them, for in the other case trouble\nwould have started even sooner than it did. As it was, they tumbled and\nmaneuvered over unresisting sand through almost tangible stench to where\na gap in the ragged wall did duty as a gate. As they came nearer, a\nbanner with the star and crescent was displayed from the wall-top, but\nno other sign was given that their coming was observed.\n\nIt was not until they had debouched (as Crothers termed it) to their\nhalf-right front and had taken to a narrow one-man track that ran below\nthe wall that any over attention was paid them. Suddenly a hook-nosed\nAsiatic gentleman emerged through the once-was gateway--a picture of\na Bible shepherd but for the long-barreled gun he carried instead of\ncrook--a brown shadow against brown masonry. He challenged them in\nArabic, and Curley Crothers answered him in Queen Victoria's English\nthat all was well.\n\n\"Everything in the garden's lovely!\" he asserted, in a deep-sea\nsing-song. \"How's yourself?\"\n\nThe man repeated whatever he had said before, this time with a gesture\nof impatience.\n\n\"Friend!\" roared Byng and Curley both together. And the bull terrier\ntook the joint yell for a war cry, or a bunting call, or possibly the\nherald's overture that summons bull pups to Valhalla. He was bred right\nand British Navy trained and his was not to reason why. He waited for\nno second invitation, but lit out from Byng's arms like a streak--a\nwhip-tail, snow-white streak--for where the Arab's hard lean legs shone\nshiny-brown below his fluttering brown raiment.\n\n\"Come back, there!\" yelled both keepers in excited unison, but they\ncalled too late.\n\nEach grabbed for the chain too late. Their heads and shoulders cannoned\nand they fell together on the hot, dirty sand while Scamp and the Arab\nmade each other's intimate acquaintance in a whirl of ripping cloth and\nlegs and teeth and blasphemy.\n\nThat in itself was bad enough, and good enough excuse if such were\nwanted for war between the Shadow of God Upon Earth and England's\ndistant Queen; but there was worse to follow.\n\nOne does not laugh, between certain parallels, unless the ultimate\ndegree of insult is intended. And Curley Crothers and Joe Byng did\nlaugh. They held their ribs and laughed until their muscles ached and\ntheir strong men's strength oozed out of them.\n\nThey were laughing when they grabbed the dog at last and pulled him off.\nThey laughed as they set the Arab on his feet and gave him back his gun;\nand they laughed at him with Christian and mannerly good grace when he\nspat at them in awful frenzy until the spittle matted in his beard.\nAnd, being gentlemen after a fashion quite their own, they smilingly\napologized.\n\nArabia lies in the middle of the zone where laughter is not wisdom.\nAnd a smile lies midway in the measure of a laugh. A laugh might be\nunintentional. A smile must be deliberate. And the Arab's spittle was\nrun dry. Creed, custom, law of tooth for tooth and the thought of half\na hundred co-religionists all watching him from crannies in the wall\ncombined to make him shoot, since further means of showing malice were\ndenied him; and he raised the long butt to his shoulder with meaning\nthat was unmistakable.\n\nAnd so, with sorrow that the East should be so lacking in good\nfellowship, but with the ready instinct of men who have been trained for\nwar, they closed with him from two directions, swiftly, bull-dog-wise,\nand took his gun away. And how could even an able seaman help the dog's\ntaking a share in the game again?\n\nSo far, nobody had done anything intended to be wrong--least of all the\ndog. The Arab was defending institutions; Crothers and Joe Byng were\nbent on holiday, and full of kind regards for anything that lived; and\nthe dog was living dogfully up to well-bred-terrier tradition. It was as\nif two harmless chemicals had met and blended into nitroglycerin.\n\nDeprived of his gun, the Arab drew a knife; and no British sailor lives\nwho does not understand the quick-loosed answer to the glint of steel.\nFist and boot both landed on the Arab quicker than his own thought\nserved the knife, and the weight of quick concussions jarred him into\nall but coma. This time Byng caught the dog in time and held him back,\nleaving Curley Crothers to finish matters by making the long knife prize\nof war. Once more he helped the Arab on his feet, smiling hugely and\ngentling the iron sinews with huge paws that could have wrenched them\nall apart if need be.\n\n\"Take my advice, cully, and weigh quick!\" he counseled, looking the Arab\nover and making sure the unfortunate had not been too much hurt. \"Run\nfor shelter where you can cool your bearings! Run off to the mosque and\npray, to make up for all that cussing. Go and be good! And next time you\nmeets us, be friendly--see?\"\n\nThe Arab was too apoplectically angry to comply, but Crothers took him\nby both shoulders and shoved him; and finding himself shot forward\nout of reach, seeing safety ahead and its possible corollary of awful\nvengeance, he suddenly achieved discretion and scampered through the gap\nin the wall.\n\n\"'E's gone to fetch his pals. Look out, mate!\" warned Joe Byng.\n\n\"Not 'im!\" vowed Crothers. \"'E's 'ad enough, that's all! We've seen the\nlast of 'im!\"\n\nAnd the most amazing thing of all was that Crothers believed just what\nhe said--Curley Crothers, to whom Red Sea and Persian Gulf ports were\nas an open book, and to whom the Arab customs and religion and\nreprehensible tendencies were currently supposed to be first-reader\nknowledge. It was he who had proved there were no harems--he who coined\nthe Navy adage, \"Search an Arab first, and sit on him, before you come\nto terms!\"\n\nYet here he was, advising Byng to disregard a looted Arab's spittle!\nThere is no accounting, ever, for the ways of shore-leave sailor-men.\n\n\"Come on, Joe,\" he said. \"Lead 'the dawg--he can walk now--and let's see\nwhat Adra looks like.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nAll might have been well, and both seamen might have reached the Puncher\nagain with dignity and grace, had they not entered Adra, past the\nonly jail in that part of Arabia. And an Arab jail being rarer and one\npercent more evil than any other evil thing there is, the two of them\nquite naturally paused to make its closest possible acquaintance.\n\n\"Look out for vermin!\" cautioned Curley, standing on tiptoe to peer in\nthrough the close-spaced iron bars.\n\nThey forgot the dog. The jail, for the moment, challenged all their\nwaking senses, the olfactory by no means least.\n\n\"Can you see anything?\" asked Byng.\n\nBefore Crothers could answer him, a snarl, then a yap, then a quick,\ndetermined growl gave warning of the terrier's interest in something\nelse than fleas.\n\nHe had been scratching himself peacefully a moment earlier; now, like a\nbower anchor taking charge, he ripped the chain through Byng's hand and\nwas off--chin, back and tail in one straight, striving line--in full\nchase of a pariah.\n\nThe yellow cur yapped its agony of fear; the nearest hundred and odd\nmangy monsters of the gutter took up the chorus; within five seconds\nof the start there was the Puncher's mascot racing after one abominable\nscavenger, and after him in just as hot pursuit there raced the whole\nstreet-cleaning force of Adra--tongues out, eyes blazing, and their mean\nthin barks all working overtime.\n\n\"Good-by, Scamp!\" groaned Byng, estimating rapidly.\n\n\"Not yet it ain't!\" said Crothers, grabbing Byng's arm and nearly\ntearing out the muscles.\n\nIt was a crude way of rousing Byng's latent speed, both of thought and\nmovement, but it worked. Before Joe could swear, even, Crothers was\noff like the wind, with Joe after him, using the string of oaths he had\nmeant for Crothers on the sand that gave under him and made him stumble\nat every other stride.\n\nAdra turned out, as a colony of prairie dogs might from planless\nburrows; only these had more venom in their bite than prairie dogs and\ncame from structural instead of natural, from flea-bepeppered instead of\ngrass-grown dirt. Man, woman and child--the grown men armed, the women\nveiled in dirt-brown, some of them, and some (mostly the better-looking)\nunveiled and unashamed, the little children mostly naked and colored\nwith all the human hues there are--raced, yelling, through a swarm of\nflies in hot pursuit. Never since Shem's great-grandson gat the Arab\nrace was there a procession like it.\n\nBehind its mud-and-Masonry decrepit wall that guards only the seaward\nside, Adra straggles quite a distance desertward; and there are winding\nstreets enough to hide an army in, provided that the army did not mind\nthe fleas. Scamp, view-halloaing his utmost, led that most amazing hunt\na quite considerable circuit before other men and dogs, arriving from a\ndozen different directions, set a limit to his unobstructed movement.\n\nHe knew what he was after, but they did not; they had come to see. For a\nmoment they seemed to think that Scamp was the object of the chase, and\na dozen guns of a dozen different kinds and dates were aimed at him.\n\nAnd then, as consciousness dawns on a man recovering from chloroform,\nthere swept over their lethargic Eastern brains the simultaneous idea\nthat Curley Crothers and Joe Byng were the real quarry; and--again like\nmen recovering from chloroform--they did not quite know what to do.\nShould they slay, there was the Puncher to be reckoned with; and the\nPuncher's port quick-firers could be seen commanding Adra by any man who\ncared to climb the wall.\n\nBesides, an Arab's hospitality is proverbial. He very seldom kills a\nvisitor on sight.\n\nOn the other hand a man, and particularly a British sailor, who runs\nhas reason, as a rule. Therefore these two men were evidently guilty.\nTherefore they must not escape. In five seconds the affair had changed\nfrom a spectacular amusement, with Adra's population in the role of\nsuper-heated audience, to a hunt of Crothers and Joe Byng.\n\nWithin ten seconds each of the sailors lay with his face pressed hard\ninto the sand and at least a dozen Arabs sitting on him. Scamp--utterly\nforgotten now by all except the sailors--still behind the one stray\npariah and ahead of all the rest but beginning to appreciate the fact\nthat he was hunted, and beginning to feel spent--raced on, took three\nsharp turns in close succession, and was gathered all unwilling in the\narms of an enormous black man who snatched him from the very teeth\nof the following pack and dispersed them, howling, by means of\nwell-directed kicks.\n\n\"Ah seed you yesterday, Ah did,\" said his deliverer in English; and,\nrecalling principle, the terrier bit at him--only to find himself\nmuzzled by a horny, huge fist that caressed even while it rendered\nimpotent.\n\n\"Ah'm fond of little dogs! Ah'm English!\"\n\nScamp understood nothing of the conversation, but with canine instinct\nrealized that he was safe; and after that he was satisfied to lie and\npant. With five red inches of tongue hanging out, and no sign whatever\nof his white-uniformed guardians to trouble him, a black man's arms were\nas good as any other place; he did not waste half a thought on Byng and\nCrothers.\n\nBut Byng, three turnings back, spat filthy sand out of his mouth the\nmoment an Arab deemed it safe to leave off sitting on his head, looked\nwildly around for Crothers, and bellowed--\n\n\"Where's the pup?\"\n\nCrothers, spitting out sand, too, twenty yards behind where the swifter\nByng had fallen, called back:\n\n\"Dunno. Whistle him!\"\n\nByng tried to whistle, and the Arabs mistook the effort for a signal. In\nan instant both men were face-downward again, struggling for breath\nand clawing at the dirt. Then worse befell. The gentleman whose brown\nanatomy had suffered from the seamen's feet and fists just previous to\ntheir invasion of the town limped up with his eye teeth showing and his\nflapping cotton raiment still unmended where the dog had torn it. Any\nother wrath, however awful, could be nothing but the shadow of his state\nof mind; and since he knew the more vindictive portions of the Koran all\nby heart, and was quoting as he came, there was little need of words to\nillustrate further his attitude.\n\nHe seemed to be a person of authority. An Arab town or village is a\ndemocracy in which each free man has his say; not even a sheik can\noverrule the vote of a majority, and this man was no sheik. But rage\nand self-assertion will generally exercise a certain weight in tribal\ncouncils, and the crowd in this case was too doubtful of the facts to\nhave any settled notions of its own.\n\n\"To the jail with them!\" the new arrival almost shrieked, and about a\ndozen in the crowd took up the cry--\n\n\"To jail with them!\"\n\n\"Infidels! Worshipers of dogs! Wine-drinkers! Eaters of pig flesh! Dogs\nand the sons of dogs--what mothers gave them birth? Are your hands,\nTrue-believers, fit bonds for them? To the jail! To the jail that Abdul\nHamid caused his men to build for such as these!\"\n\nHe stooped and looked deliberately to make sure that Crothers could not\nbreak away, then came closer and spat on him, saving half his spittle\nwith impartial forethought for the struggling Byng, who looked up\nin time to see what was in store for him. Being spat on is even less\nexhilarating than it sounds or looks, and Byng waxed speechless after\npassing through a many-worded stage of blasphemy.\n\nCrothers, the larger of the two and by six brawny inches more\nphlegmatic, bode his time in silence, so that neither of them spoke a\nword while they were hustled and cuffed along the street between the\nunbaked brick hovels. It was not until the reinforced iron door of\nAdra's one stone building slammed on them that either of them said a\nword.\n\nThen--\n\n\"I'm not a mean man,\" protested Crothers.\n\n\"No?\" said Byng, monosyllabic for a start.\n\n\"No,\" repeated Crothers, \"I am not, Joe Byng. But--and I says it solemn;\nI says it with one 'and above my 'ed, and I'd take my affidavy on it in\na court o' law, if it's the last word I ever does say an' it's my dying\noath--so 'elp me Solomon and all 'is glory; I'm a Dutchman if I wouldn't\nlike to 'ave a come-back at that Arab.\"\n\nByng lay full length on his stomach, and buried his face in his arms. He\nwas still too full of wrath for words.\n\n\"I'd kick his mother, if I couldn't land on him,\" mused Crothers.\nAnd then he busied himself about conning his new bearings. It was a\nfour-walled jail--one-doored, one-windowed, iron-barred--ill-smelling,\nverminous, too hot for words and too suggestive of the opposite of home,\nsweet home to call forth humor, even from a seaman.\n\n\"They'll come an' rescue us,\" moaned Byng. \"They'll quarantine the pair\nof us for being lousy, and they'll turn the perishing salt-water hose\non us. We're due for the brig for Gawd knows 'ow long; our reppitation's\ngone; we've been spat on by a--by a Arab, and we 'aven't hit 'im back;\nan' we've lost the pup. We've gone an' lost the pup! Gawd! There ain't\nno more good in nothin'!\"\n\nWhich shows no more than that Joe Byng in his sorrow overlooked a\ncircumstance or two. For instance, there were rings in the floor that\nCrothers eyed with keen curiosity. They were anchored in the solid\nblocks of stone.\n\n\"It's better than it might be, mate!\" he argued optimistically. \"They\nmight 'ave gone and chained us up to those!\"\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nArabia has some peculiarities, not all of them discreditable, which she\ndoes not share with any other country. There is, for instance, the kind\ncustom that dictates the setting free of slaves when they have rendered\nseven years' good service.\n\nThat rule (and it is rather rule than law) tends to eliminate all class\nand color prejudice. Provided that a man will bow to Mecca three times\ndaily and refrain from pork and wine, he may wear whatever skin God gave\nhim and yet mingle with the best. He may even marry whom he will and\ncan afford; and he may be whatever his ability, ambition, and audacity\ndictate.\n\nAnd Hassan Ah had never been a slave, so he had even less to overcome\nthan might have been the case. He stalked Adra socially uncondemned\nwhere once he had caught fish, groomed camels, and done other irritating\njobs. His old fish-catching days had given him an intimate acquaintance\nwith the reef, and his small-boat seamanship, born of hard pulling in\nthe trough of beam-on-seas, was well suited to the local type of craft.\n\nSo nobody questioned his right to the title of harbor pilot. And if\ncertain perquisites went with an otherwise barren office, that was to\nbe expected. Who worked for nothing, or for the empty honor of it, in\nArabia?\n\nNobody can pass the reef at night in shallow-draft lateen-sail boats\nwithout having him on board; and though he was never ostensibly paid\nfor his services, it was understood that he performed pilot service in\nreturn for certain other opportunities that sometimes came his way. When\nthings happened on the high sea that were not discussed in public, it\nwas understood that Hassan Ah could have discussed them as thoroughly as\nanybody if he chose.\n\nOn the whole, then, and within limits that were only more or less\ndefinable, he was something of a personality. Men listened to him when\nhe raised his voice in argument, and as one who could grant favors on\noccasion his words had weight.\n\nThe sun was very nearly in its zenith, beating down on dry Arabia\nbetween racing black clouds, when he had finished talking to the local\ncouncil in the ramshackle old council-house, skin and mat curtained,\nthat faced the sheik's where the main street broadened for a hundred\nfilthy yards into a market-place. All through his argument he had held a\npure-white bull terrier between his knees as proof that he knew whereof\nhe spoke.\n\n\"Can any of you hold him without being bitten?\" he demanded. And they\ndid not seem to care to try.\n\n\"I know the ways of these men!\" he asserted, drawing extravagant\nexpressions of contentment from the dog in proof of it.\n\nSo the others in the stuffy council place gave the dog a wide berth and\nno privilege, but conceded him the right to hold the beast, if he wanted\nto, without personal defilement. And since the way of the world is that\na man who has won the first of his contentions can win all the rest\nwith half the ease, he persuaded them with a hurricane of black man's\nrhetoric to do what Arabs consider almost wicked.\n\nUnbelievers who are prisoners should die, beyond all question.\n\n\"As the dregs of oil shall the fruit of the tree of Al Zakkum boil in\nthe bellies of the damned!\" the sheik quoted. \"They should be hurried,\ntherefore, to the punishment that waits!\"\n\nBut Hassen Ah outargued him.\n\n\"Then they will land men from the ship, who will search our houses,\"\nhe asserted. \"Is there a majority in the council who would like to be\nsearched by unbelievers?\"\n\n\"Then bind them, and take them to their ship, and tell a tale of much\ndrunkenness and wrong-doing. Ask an indemnity, and show the proofs,\nwhich will be easy to arrange.\"\n\n\"They, too, will tell their tale!\" said Hassan Ah in perfect Arabic.\n\nUnlike the more enlightened peoples of the West, Arabs do not encourage\nthe mutilation of their mother-tongue; they teach it as carefully as\nthey talk it, and this negro spoke like an Arab of the blood.\n\n\"There are certain damages they have received--some bruises on the\nface and tears in the clothing that does not belong to them but their\ngovernment,\" he continued. \"They would lay all the blame on us, and\nwould breathe in the face of an appointed man, in proof that they were\nnot drunk. And who could get other drink than coffee or water here? And\nwho would believe the rest of our story, having found that part to be\na lie? There would be a landing, and a search for proof, and much\nunpleasantness. Besides--\"\n\nIf he had intended to add further arguments, the sheik saw fit to nip\nthem in the bud; for there were some men in the council-room who did not\nknow as much as Hassan Ah. Any free man may speak in council in Arabia.\n\n\"What is thy way, then?\" he asked.\n\nThe woolly headed pilot laughed aloud, taking care to make it evident\nthat he was laughing at the prisoners; to laugh at a sheik or a sheik's\nbewilderment would be too dangerous.\n\n\"I would send them to the ship well satisfied,\" he answered.\n\n\"With money?\" asked the sheik.\n\n\"With whose money?\" asked Hassan Ah.\n\n\"With thine?\" shot back the sheik.\n\n\"In the name of Allah, no!\"\n\nThe black man laughed again, and rose to lean against the wall behind\nhim, gathering the dog up in his arms.\n\n\"If it is the order of the council,\" he asserted, \"I will send them back\nsatisfied, with a tale to tell that will bring about no landing. Also, I\nwill give the council much amusement.\"\n\n\"But will other sailors land afterward, seeking similar amusement?\"\nasked the sheik.\n\n\"No! There will be an order that none land!\"\n\nThe sheik took a vote on it. Heads nodded solemnly all around the room\nas his eyes sought each half-veiled face in turn. His own face was\nalmost altogether shielded by the brown linen head-dress, for men of\nhis race like to reach a judgment unobserved. They were all nods that\nanswered him, and he saw fit to keep his own opinion to himself.\n\n\"Thou seest? These others are all with thee. Have it thine own way,\nHassan Ah. Unlock thou the riddle and on thy head be the answer! Thou\nhast our leave to go.\"\n\nSo Hassan Ah set out undaunted for the jail, with a terrier in tow\nbehind him and a huge smile on his broad-beamed face. And behind him a\nmurmur rose that:\n\n\"It was well. He brought the warship in, instead of leaving it outside\nor--as any wise man would have done--wrecking it on the outer reef,\nwhere it could have been plundered at discretion. Let him send the\nsailors back again and bear the consequences!\"\n\nAnd within a minute of the pilot's arrival at the window of the jail\n(through which he peered for two minutes before speaking) the whole\nof Adra's council, followed by the city's children in a noisy horde,\nproceeded in a cluster after him and took up position, each as he saw\nfit, at different vantage points.\n\nThen Hassan Ah shook a loose bar of the window until it rattled, and so\ncalled attention to himself. Crothers and Joe Byng raced for the window\nneck and neck, and reached it simultaneously.\n\n\"You two men want you-ah dog?\" asked Hassan Ah, and the chained dog\nleaped up at the window as both men swore at once.\n\n\"You pass him in here! Come on, you black-faced cornerman! There'll be\na cutter's crew ashore pretty soon to rescue us, and if you don't hand\nthat dog over before they get here you'll get the worst whipping you\never had in all your black life!\"\n\n\"They'll feed you to the dog when they're through with you!\" vowed Byng.\n\n\"Come on, MacHassan!\" ordered Crothers. \"Get the key and pass the\ndog in. That'll settle your account. T hen you's free. You needn't be\n'fraid.\"\n\n\"Ah'm English,\" said the pilot of the day before, with an enormous grin\nthat showed a pound or two of yellow ivory. \"Ah'm not afraid; Ah can\nlick you; Ah can fight same as you men. Ah'm English!\"\n\n\"Fight? You Irish Chink! Which of us two do you want to fight?\" asked\nthe outraged Byng. \"Come on in here! I'll fight you!\"\n\nBut to Byng's amazement Hassan Ah pointed to Crothers, who was heavier\nby forty pounds or more and taller by at least half a head.\n\n\"Ah choose him!\" he grinned; and Curley Crothers clenched both fists in\nabsolute but quite unterrified amazement.\n\n\"Come on, then,\" he answered. \"Open the door.\" Then, as an\nafterthought--\"I'll fight you for the dog.\"\n\n\"Ah don't want to kill that little man,\" said Hassan Ah. \"But Ah'll give\nyou the dog, win or lose, if you'll fight me. You fight fair? You fight\nEnglish?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm damned!\" said Crothers. \"I fight Queensberry rules. That suit\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh-ah, yes! Keensby rules, that's it. All right-o!\"\n\nHassan Ah produced his key and turned it in the creaking lock. He was\nstripping himself even before the two sailors were out in the sun, and\nby the time that Crothers and Joe Byng had realized that there was\nan audience of something like a thousand, including children, he was\nstanding posed like a gladiator, with the straight-down tropic sun\nstreaming off his ebony hide. As Crothers, not quite sure even yet that\nthe whole affair was not a joke, began to doff his blouse it dawned on\nhim that if the thing were true it would not be a picnic.\n\n\"Do you mean this?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ah shohly do. Are you afraid o' me?\"\n\nThat, of course, settled matters. The thing was not a joke, and\nEnglishman or nigger--black, green, white, or gray--the plot must be\nlicked forthwith and in accordance with the rules.\n\nCrothers spat into his hands, while Joe Byng folded up his blouse and\nknelt on it. He eyed his antagonist for at least a minute, summing him\nup and ignoring none of the woolly-headed one's physical advantages in\nweight and strength, in height and reach, in being used to the climate\nand the glare, the odds were all with Hassan Ah. Then he sized up the\nmoral odds; and though a biased audience might be at first supposed to\nweigh against him too, the sight of all those Arabs waiting to see him\nbeaten roused his fighting dander.\n\n\"Do you represent the bloke that spat on us two men?\" asked Crothers.\n\n\"Ah represent maself! Ah'm English! Ah fight English, and Ah'll prove\nit!\"\n\n\"Aw, wade into him!\" advised Joe Byng. \"London Prize Rules--no time\ncalled until a man's down. Go on, Curley--lead!\"\n\n\"Do you agree?\" asked Crothers.\n\n\"Suttainly!\" The black man seemed disposed to agree to anything so long\nas he could get what he was after.\n\n\"Then here goes!\" said Crothers; and he stepped in and led for the honor\nof the British Navy.\n\nOh! It was a fight! Crothers knew what he was up against the instant\nthat his left fist slid along an ebony forearm and his nose collided\nwith what seemed like an iron club. Steamship pilot this man might not\nbe, but fighting man he very surely was. He hit straight and guarded\nhigh. He was no untutored savage. He had the hardest to acquire of all\nthe Christian arts at his fingers' (or rather his fists') ends, and\nthe heavyweight champion of Gosport took a double reef in his fighting\ntactics while he sparred for time in which to recover from the shock\nof that first blow. The claret was streaming down his face and he was\ndizzy.\n\n\"Oh, wade into him, mate!\" urged Joe.\n\nIt is always easier to see what should be done than to do it. The sand\nwas not slipping and giving under Joe Byng's feet, nor were his fists\nand wrists aching from contact with hard ebony. To him the thing seemed\neasy, and he was as anxious to get into the fight himself as was the\nterrier that strained at his chain. But Crothers, who had won a hundred\nfights at least in cleaner climes, fought canny and tried to make the\nblack man tire himself with wasted effort.\n\nAnd the Arabs sat in silence, like a row of vultures waiting for the\nend. Even the little children held their clamor and subsided into\nmotionless calm. There was not a movement along the roofs or the wall,\nor in the rings of those who squatted. Arabia was spellbound, watching\nsomething she had never seen before and trying to puzzle out the\nwherefore of it. There were knives and guns available, yet these men\nfought without weapons. The white contender had a friend, but the friend\ndid not join in. Why? Had Allah struck all three men mad? They sat\nstill to see the end, having no doubt but that it would prove to be a\njudgment.\n\nCurley Crothers was the first to close a round. He put an end to round\none at the end of three minutes by missing with a heavy right swing,\nducking to avoid terrific punishment, slipping in the yielding sand and\nfalling.\n\n\"Back with you!\" yelled Joe Byng, afraid that the pilot would take\nliberties and ready to jump in and stop him if need be. But he wasted\nhis excitement.\n\n\"Ah told you Ah'm English!\" said the pilot, stepping back and letting\nCrothers find his corner.\n\nCurley was glad enough of a rest on Joe Byng's knee, and too intent on\ngetting back his wind to listen over carefully to Joe's advice. When Joe\ncalled \"Time\" he stepped in readily again; and this time it was Hassan\nAh who suffered from surprise.\n\nCurley had been getting out of practise on board ship; he had needed\nwaking up, and round one had done it for him. Round two and the six that\nfollowed it were exhibitions of the \"noble art\" that men in any of the\nlarger cities of the world would have paid out a fortune to have seen.\n\nThere was racial prejudice, and service pride, as well as the usual\ndecent man's desire to win to make a real mill of what might have been\nnothing out of ordinary; and there were the quite considerable odds\nagainst him that--after the first repulse--usually make men like\nCrothers do their utmost.\n\nEven the Arabs lost their stoicism while round two was under way.\nByng yelled, and the terrier yelped, but the Arabs only shifted their\nposition. That, though, was proof enough of their excitement; they\nactually sighed in unison when Hassan Ah thrust his ungainly chin in the\nway of a crushing right-hand smash, and laid his broad back on the sand.\n\nAfter that it was slug-and-come-again with both of them, each getting\nwilder as round succeeded round, but neither man obtaining much\nadvantage. Twice it was Crothers who went down; then he discovered a\nsoft spot in Hassan's ribs, and after that he kept the black man busy on\nthe desperate defensive.\n\nThere was no doubt of the end, then, barring accidents. Even Hassan Ah\ncould not have doubted it; but he did his black man's uttermost to put\nit off, and he fought as gamely as anybody ever fought since prize-ring\nrules were drafted. He did not foul, or take undue advantage once.\n\nIt was a plain, right-handed, battering-ram punch to the neck that ended\nthings, and Hassan Ah lay coughing on the sand with bulging eyes while\nJoe Byng tended Curley's hurts.\n\n\"Hasn't the nigger got any pals?\" asked Crothers; and then it occurred\nto Byng that the most hurt man was surely most in need of mending. Both\nhe and Crothers bent over him, then, and they soon had him on his feet\nagain.\n\n\"Ah told you Ah'm English!\" were the first words he succeeded in\nspluttering through swollen lips.\n\n\"Now, what d'you mean by that exactly?\" asked Joe Byng, his attitude\ntoward him almost entirely changed. A man who loses gamely is entitled\nto respect if not to friendship.\n\nHassan Ah searched in the tattered shirt that he had laid aside, and\npulled out a folded piece of paper after a lot of fumbling. He opened it\ngingerly, and holding one corner of it displayed the rest with evident\nintention not to allow it out of his grasp.\n\n\"That says Ah'm English!\" he explained.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Crothers, rubbing an injured eye in order to see it better.\n\"Can you read, you black heathen?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the pilot. \"That says Ah'm English, but Ah can't read!\"\n\n\"Well, MacHassan,\" said Curley Crothers, reading the document a second\ntime. \"Black or white, you fight like a gentleman. I'm proud to have\nlicked you. Good-by, and good luck! Here's my hand!\"\n\nThey shook hands, and the seamen started shoreward with the terrier in\ntow.\n\n\"Did you read the paper?\" asked Crothers. \"It was dated Aden--non-coms'\nmess of some regiment or other. 'This is to certify that this regiment\ntaught Hassan Ah to use his fists, and that he has since licked every\nsingle mother's son of us!' Pity I didn't see that first, eh?\"\n\n\"Oh, I dunno,\" said Joe Byng, who had not had to do the fighting. \"You\nlicked the savage, anyway.\"\n\nHassan Ah was right. There was no more shore leave granted. Crothers and\nJoe Byng were punished with extra duty and \"confined to ship\" for coming\nback with the marks of fighting on them; and the Puncher gave no further\nsigns of life until, some three I days later, her long-suffering engines\nturned again and she departed through the channel that had brought her\nin.\n\nThen the sheik and three others and a certain Hassan Ah went down\nat midnight to the jail and lifted with the aid of long poles\npassed through the rings in them the largest floor stones of that\nvermin-infested building. But the vermin did not trouble them. What they\nwere after and what they lifted out was the cases of guns and cartridges\nthe Puncher had contrived to miss.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Told in the East, by Talbot Mundy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOLD IN THE EAST ***\n\n***** This file should be named 5315.txt or 5315.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/3/1/5315/\n\nProduced by Jake Jaqua\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
