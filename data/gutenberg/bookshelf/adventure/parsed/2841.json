Rider Haggard\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nALLAN GIVES A SHOOTING LESSON\n\nNow I, Allan Quatermain, come to the story of what was, perhaps, one of\nthe strangest of all the adventures which have befallen me in the course\nof a life that so far can scarcely be called tame or humdrum.\n\nAmongst many other things it tells of the war against the Black Kendah\npeople and the dead of Jana, their elephant god. Often since then I\nhave wondered if this creature was or was not anything more than a mere\ngigantic beast of the forest. It seems improbable, even impossible, but\nthe reader of future days may judge of this matter for himself.\n\nAlso he can form his opinion as to the religion of the White Kendah and\ntheir pretensions to a certain degree of magical skill. Of this magic\nI will make only one remark: If it existed at all, it was by no means\ninfallible. To take a single instance, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt were convinced\nby divination that I, and I only, could kill Jana, which was why they\ninvited me to Kendahland. Yet in the end it was Hans who killed him.\nJana nearly killed me!\n\nNow to my tale.\n\n\n\nIn another history, called \"The Holy Flower,\" I have told how I came to\nEngland with a young gentleman of the name of Scroope, partly to see him\nsafely home after a hunting accident, and partly to try to dispose of\na unique orchid for a friend of mine called Brother John by the white\npeople, and Dogeetah by the natives, who was popularly supposed to be\nmad, but, in fact, was very sane indeed. So sane was he that he pursued\nwhat seemed to be an absolutely desperate quest for over twenty years,\nuntil, with some humble assistance on my part, he brought it to a\ncuriously successful issue. But all this tale is told in \"The Holy\nFlower,\" and I only allude to it here, that is at present, to explain\nhow I came to be in England.\n\nWhile in this country I stayed for a few days with Scroope, or, rather,\nwith his fianc\u00e9e and her people, at a fine house in Essex. (I called it\nEssex to avoid the place being identified, but really it was one of the\nneighbouring counties.) During my visit I was taken to see a much finer\nplace, a splendid old castle with brick gateway towers, that had been\nwonderfully well restored and turned into a most luxurious modern\ndwelling. Let us call it \"Ragnall,\" the seat of a baron of that name.\n\nI had heard a good deal about Lord Ragnall, who, according to all\naccounts, seemed a kind of Admirable Crichton. He was said to be\nwonderfully handsome, a great scholar--he had taken a double first at\ncollege; a great athlete--he had been captain of the Oxford boat at the\nUniversity race; a very promising speaker who had already made his mark\nin the House of Lords; a sportsman who had shot tigers and other large\ngame in India; a poet who had published a successful volume of verse\nunder a pseudonym; a good solider until he left the Service; and lastly,\na man of enormous wealth, owning, in addition to his estates, several\ncoal mines and an entire town in the north of England.\n\n\"Dear me!\" I said when the list was finished, \"he seems to have been\nborn with a whole case of gold spoons in his mouth. I hope one of them\nwill not choke him,\" adding: \"Perhaps he will be unlucky in love.\"\n\n\"That's just where he is most lucky of all,\" answered the young lady to\nwhom I was talking--it was Scroope's fianc\u00e9e, Miss Manners--\"for he is\nengaged to a lady that, I am told, is the loveliest, sweetest, cleverest\ngirl in all England, and they absolutely adore each other.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" I repeated. \"I wonder what Fate _has_ got up its sleeve for\nLord Ragnall and his perfect lady-love?\"\n\nI was doomed to find out one day.\n\nSo it came about that when, on the following morning, I was asked if\nI would like to see the wonders of Ragnall Castle, I answered \"Yes.\"\nReally, however, I wanted to have a look at Lord Ragnall himself, if\npossible, for the account of his many perfections had impressed the\nimagination of a poor colonist like myself, who had never found an\nopportunity of setting his eyes upon a kind of human angel. Human devils\nI had met in plenty, but never a single angel--at least, of the male\nsex. Also there was always the possibility that I might get a glimpse\nof the still more angelic lady to whom he was engaged, whose name,\nI understood, was the Hon. Miss Holmes. So I said that nothing would\nplease me more than to see this castle.\n\nThither we drove accordingly through the fine, frosty air, for the month\nwas December. On reaching the castle, Mr. Scroope was told that Lord\nRagnall, whom he knew well, was out shooting somewhere in the park, but\nthat, of course, he could show his friend over the place. So we went\nin, the three of us, for Miss Manners, to whom Scroope was to be married\nvery shortly, had driven us over in her pony carriage. The porter at the\ngateway towers took us to the main door of the castle and handed us over\nto another man, whom he addressed as Mr. Savage, whispering to me that\nhe was his lordship's personal attendant.\n\nI remember the name, because it seemed to me that I had never seen\nanyone who looked much less savage. In truth, his appearance was that\nof a duke in disguise, as I imagine dukes to be, for I never set eyes\non one. His dress--he wore a black morning cut-away coat--was faultless.\nHis manners were exquisite, polite to the verge of irony, but with a\nhint of haughty pride in the background. He was handsome also, with a\nfine nose and a hawk-like eye, while a touch of baldness added to the\ngeneral effect. His age may have been anything between thirty-five and\nforty, and the way he deprived me of my hat and stick, to which I\nstrove to cling, showed, I thought, resolution of character. Probably, I\nreflected to myself, he considers me an unusual sort of person who might\ndamage the pictures and other objects of art with the stick, and not\nseeing his way how to ask me to give it up without suggesting suspicion,\nhas hit upon the expedient of taking my hat also.\n\nIn after days Mr. Samuel Savage informed me that I was quite right\nin this surmise. He said he thought that, judging from my somewhat\nunconventional appearance, I might be one of the dangerous class of whom\nhe had been reading in the papers, namely, a \"hanarchist.\" I write the\nword as he pronounced it, for here comes the curious thing. This man,\nso flawless, so well instructed in some respects, had a fault which gave\neverything away. His h's were uncertain. Three of them would come quite\nright, but the fourth, let us say, would be conspicuous either by\nits utter absence or by its unwanted appearance. He could speak, when\ndescribing the Ragnall pictures, in rotund and flowing periods that\nwould scarcely have disgraced the pen of Gibbon. Then suddenly that\n\"h\" would appear or disappear, and the illusion was over. It was like a\nsudden shock of cold water down the back. I never discovered the origin\nof his family; it was a matter of which he did not speak, perhaps\nbecause he was vague about it himself; but if an earl of Norman blood\nhad married a handsome Cockney kitchenmaid of native ability, I can\nquite imagine that Samuel Savage might have been a child of the union.\nFor the rest he was a good man and a faithful one, for whom I have a\nhigh respect.\n\nOn this occasion he conducted us round the castle, or, rather, its more\npublic rooms, showing us many treasures and, I should think, at least\ntwo hundred pictures by eminent and departed artists, which gave him an\nopportunity of exhibiting a peculiar, if somewhat erratic, knowledge of\nhistory. To tell the truth, I began to wish that it were a little less\nfull in detail, since on a December day those large apartments felt\nuncommonly cold. Scroope and Miss Manners seemed to keep warm, perhaps\nwith the inward fires of mutual admiration, but as I had no one to\nadmire except Mr. Savage, a temperature of about 35 degrees produced its\nnatural effect upon me.\n\nAt length we took a short cut from the large to the little gallery\nthrough a warmed and comfortable room, which I understood was Lord\nRagnall's study. Halting for a moment by one of the fires, I observed\na picture on the wall, over which a curtain was drawn, and asked Mr.\nSavage what it might be.\n\n\"That, sir,\" he replied with a kind of haughty reserve, \"is the portrait\nof her future ladyship, which his lordship keeps for his private heye.\"\n\nMiss Manners sniggered, and I said:\n\n\"Oh, thank you. What an ill-omened kind of thing to do!\"\n\nThen, observing through an open door the hall in which my hat had been\ntaken from me, I lingered and as the others vanished in the little\ngallery, slipped into it, recovered my belongings, and passed out to\nthe garden, purposing to walk there till I was warm again and Scroope\nreappeared. While I marched up and down a terrace, on which, I remember,\nseveral very cold-looking peacocks were seated, like conscientious\nbirds that knew it was their duty to be ornamental, however low the\ntemperature, I heard some shots fired, apparently in a clump of ilex\noaks which grew about five hundred yards away, and reflected to myself\nthat they seemed to be those of a small rifle, not of a shotgun.\n\nMy curiosity being excited as to what was to be an almost professional\nmatter, I walked towards the grove, making a circuit through a\nshrubbery. At length I found myself near to the edge of a glade, and\nperceived, standing behind the shelter of a magnificent ilex, two men.\nOne of these was a young keeper, and the other, from his appearance,\nI felt sure must be Lord Ragnall himself. Certainly he was a\nsplendid-looking man, very tall, very broad, very handsome, with a\npeaked beard, a kind and charming face, and large dark eyes. He wore a\ncloak upon his shoulders, which was thrown back from over a velvet coat,\nand, except for the light double-barrelled rifle in his hand, looked\nexactly like a picture by Van Dyck which Mr. Savage had just informed me\nwas that of one of his lordship's ancestors of the time of Charles I.\n\nStanding behind another oak, I observed that he was trying to shoot\nwood-pigeons as they descended to feed upon the acorns, for which the\nhard weather had made them greedy. From time to time these beautiful\nblue birds appeared and hovered a moment before they settled, whereon\nthe sportsman fired and--they flew away. _Bang! Bang!_ went the\ndouble-barrelled rifle, and off fled the pigeon.\n\n\"Damn!\" said the sportsman in a pleasant, laughing voice; \"that's the\ntwelfth I have missed, Charles.\"\n\n\"You hit his tail, my lord. I saw a feather come out. But, my lord, as\nI told you, there ain't no man living what can kill pigeons on the wing\nwith a bullet, even when they seem to sit still in the air.\"\n\n\"I have heard of one, Charles. Mr. Scroope has a friend from Africa\nstaying with him who, he swears, could knock over four out of six.\"\n\n\"Then, my lord, Mr. Scroope has a friend what lies,\" replied Charles as\nhe handed him the second rifle.\n\nThis was too much for me. I stepped forward, raising my hat politely,\nand said:\n\n\"Sir, forgive me for interrupting you, but you are not shooting at those\nwood-pigeons in the right way. Although they seem to hover just before\nthey settle, they are dropping much faster than you think. Your keeper\nwas mistaken when he said that you knocked a feather out of the tail of\nthat last bird at which you fired two barrels. In both cases you shot at\nleast a foot above it, and what fell was a leaf from the ilex tree.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence, which was broken by Charles, who\nejaculated in a thick voice:\n\n\"Well, of all the cheek!\"\n\nLord Ragnall, however, for it was he, looked first angry and then\namused.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"I thank you for your advice, which no doubt is\nexcellent, for it is certainly true that I have missed every pigeon\nwhich I tried to shoot with these confounded little rifles. But if you\ncould demonstrate in practice what you so kindly set out in precept, the\nvalue of your counsel would be enhanced.\"\n\nThus he spoke, mimicking, I have no doubt (for he had a sense of\nhumour), the manner of my address, which nervousness had made somewhat\npompous.\n\n\"Give me the rifle,\" I answered, taking off my greatcoat.\n\nHe handed it me with a bow.\n\n\"Mind what you are about,\" growled Charles. \"That there thing is full\ncocked and 'air-triggered.\"\n\nI withered, or, rather, tried to wither him with a glance, but this\nunbelieving keeper only stared back at me with insolence in his round\nand bird-like eyes. Never before had I felt quite so angry with a\nmenial. Then a horrible doubt struck me. Supposing I should miss! I knew\nvery little of the manner of flight of English wood-pigeons, which\nare not difficult to miss with a bullet, and nothing at all of these\nparticular rifles, though a glance at them showed me that they were\nexquisite weapons of their sort and by a great maker. If I muffed\nthe thing now, how should I bear the scorn of Charles and the polite\namusement of his noble master? Almost I prayed that no more pigeons\nwould put in an appearance, and thus that the issue of my supposed skill\nmight be left in doubt.\n\nBut this was not to be. These birds came from far in ones or twos to\nsearch for their favourite food, and the fact that others had been\nscared away did not cause them to cease from coming. Presently I heard\nCharles mutter:\n\n\"Now, then, look out, guv'nor. Here's your chance of teaching his\nlordship how to do it, though he does happen to be the best shot in\nthese counties.\"\n\nWhile he spoke two pigeons appeared, one a little behind the other,\ncoming down very straight. As they reached the opening in the ilex grove\nthey hovered, preparing to alight, for of us they could see nothing, one\nat a distance of about fifty and the other of, say, seventy yards away.\nI took the nearest, got on to it, allowing for the drop and the angle,\nand touched the trigger of the rifle, which fell to my shoulder very\nsweetly. The bullet struck that pigeon on the crop, out of which fell a\nshower of acorns that it had been eating, as it sank to the ground stone\ndead. Number two pigeon, realizing danger, began to mount upwards almost\nstraight. I fired the second barrel, and by good luck shot its head\noff. Then I snatched the other rifle, which Charles had been loading\nautomatically, from his outstretched hand, for at that moment I saw two\nmore pigeons coming. At the first I risked a difficult shot and hit it\nfar back, knocking out its tail, but bringing it, still fluttering, to\nthe ground. The other, too, I covered, but when I touched the trigger\nthere was a click, no more.\n\nThis was my opportunity of coming even with Charles, and I availed\nmyself of it.\n\n\"Young man,\" I said, while he gaped at me open-mouthed, \"you should\nlearn to be careful with rifles, which are dangerous weapons. If you\ngive one to a shooter that is not loaded, it shows that you are capable\nof anything.\"\n\nThen I turned, and addressing Lord Ragnall, added:\n\n\"I must apologize for that third shot of mine, which was infamous, for\nI committed a similar fault to that against which I warned you, sir,\nand did not fire far enough ahead. However, it may serve to show your\nattendant the difference between the tail of a pigeon and an oak leaf,\"\nand I pointed to one of the feathers of the poor bird, which was still\ndrifting to the ground.\n\n\"Well, if this here snipe of a chap ain't the devil in boots!\" exclaimed\nCharles to himself.\n\nBut his master cut him short with a look, then lifted his hat to me and\nsaid:\n\n\"Sir, the practice much surpasses the precept, which is unusual. I\ncongratulate you upon a skill that almost partakes of the marvellous,\nunless, indeed, chance----\" And he stopped.\n\n\"It is natural that you should think so,\" I replied; \"but if more\npigeons come, and Mr. Charles will make sure that he loads the rifle, I\nhope to undeceive you.\"\n\nAt this moment, however, a loud shout from Scroope, who was looking for\nme, reinforced by a shrill cry uttered by Miss Manners, banished every\npigeon within half a mile, a fact of which I was not sorry, since who\nknows whether I should have it all, or any, of the next three birds?\n\n\"I think my friends are calling me, so I will bid you good morning,\" I\nsaid awkwardly.\n\n\"One moment, sir,\" he exclaimed. \"Might I first ask you your name? Mine\nis Ragnall--Lord Ragnall.\"\n\n\"And mine is Allan Quatermain,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh!\" he answered, \"that explains matters. Charles, this is Mr.\nScroope's friend, the gentleman that you said--exaggerated. I think you\nhad better apologize.\"\n\nBut Charles was gone, to pick up the pigeons, I suppose.\n\nAt this moment Scroope and the young lady appeared, having heard our\nvoices, and a general explanation ensued.\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain has been giving me a lesson in shooting pigeons on the\nwing with a small-bore rifle,\" said Lord Ragnall, pointing to the dead\nbirds that still lay upon the ground.\n\n\"He is competent to do that,\" said Scroope.\n\n\"Painfully competent,\" replied his lordship. \"If you don't believe me,\nask the under-keeper.\"\n\n\"It is the only thing I can do,\" I explained modestly. \"Rifle-shooting\nis my trade, and I have made a habit of practising at birds on the wing\nwith ball. I have no doubt that with a shot-gun your lordship would\nleave me nowhere, for that is a game at which I have had little\npractice, except when shooting for the pot in Africa.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" interrupted Scroope, \"you wouldn't have any chance at that,\nAllan, against one of the finest shots in England.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" said Lord Ragnall, laughing pleasantly. \"I have an\nidea that Mr. Quatermain is full of surprises. However, with his leave,\nwe'll see. If you have a day to spare, Mr. Quatermain, we are going to\nshoot through the home coverts to-morrow, which haven't been touched\ntill now, and I hope you will join us.\"\n\n\"It is most kind of you, but that is impossible,\" I answered with\nfirmness. \"I have no gun here.\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind that, Mr. Quatermain. I have a pair of\nbreech-loaders\"--these were new things at that date--\"which have been\nsent down to me to try. I am going to return them, because they are much\ntoo short in the stock for me. I think they would just suit you, and you\nare quite welcome to the use of them.\"\n\nAgain I excused myself, guessing that the discomfited Charles would\nput all sorts of stories about concerning me, and not wishing to look\nfoolish before a party of grand strangers, no doubt chosen for their\nskill at this particular form of sport.\n\n\"Well, Allan,\" exclaimed Scroope, who always had a talent for saying the\nwrong thing, \"you are quite right not to go into a competition with Lord\nRagnall over high pheasants.\"\n\nI flushed, for there was some truth in his blundering remark, whereon\nLord Ragnall said with ready tact:\n\n\"I asked Mr. Quatermain to shoot, not to a shooting match, Scroope, and\nI hope he'll come.\"\n\nThis left me no option, and with a sinking heart I had to accept.\n\n\"Sorry I can't ask you too, Scroope,\" said his lordship, when details\nhad been arranged, \"but we can only manage seven guns at this shoot. But\nwill you and Miss Manners come to dine and sleep to-morrow evening? I\nshould like to introduce your future wife to my future wife,\" he added,\ncolouring a little.\n\nMiss Manners being devoured with curiosity as to the wonderful Miss\nHolmes, of whom she had heard so much but never actually seen, accepted\nat once, before her lover could get out a word, whereon Scroope\nvolunteered to bring me over in the morning and load for me. Being\npossessed by a terror that I should be handed over to the care of the\nunsympathetic Charles, I replied that I should be very grateful, and so\nthe thing was settled.\n\nOn our way home we passed through a country town, of which I forget the\nname, and the sight of a gunsmith's shop there reminded me that I had\nno cartridges. So I stopped to order some, as, fortunately, Lord Ragnall\nhad mentioned that the guns he was going to lend me were twelve-bores.\nThe tradesman asked me how many cartridges I wanted, and when I replied\n\"a hundred,\" stared at me and said:\n\n\"If, as I understood, sir, you are going to the big winter shoot at\nRagnall to-morrow, you had better make it three hundred and fifty at\nleast. I shall be there to watch, like lots of others, and I expect to\nsee nearly two hundred fired by each gun at the last Lake stand.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I answered, fearing to show more ignorance by further\ndiscussion. \"I will call for the cartridges on my way to-morrow morning.\nPlease load them with three drachms of powder.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and an ounce and an eighth of No. 5 shot, sir? That's what\nall the gentlemen use.\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"No. 3; please be sure as to that. Good evening.\"\n\nThe gunsmith stared at me, and as I left the shop I heard him remark to\nhis assistant:\n\n\"That African gent must think he's going out to shoot ostriches with\nbuck shot. I expect he ain't no good, whatever they may say about him.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nALLAN MAKES A BET\n\nOn the following morning Scroope and I arrived at Castle Ragnall at\nor about a quarter to ten. On our way we stopped to pick up my three\nhundred and fifty cartridges. I had to pay something over three solid\nsovereigns for them, as in those days such things were dear, which\nshowed me that I was not going to get my lesson in English pheasant\nshooting for nothing. The gunsmith, however, to whom Scroope gave a lift\nin his cart to the castle, impressed upon me that they were dirt cheap,\nsince he and his assistant had sat up most of the night loading them\nwith my special No. 3 shot.\n\nAs I climbed out of the vehicle a splendid-looking and portly person,\narrayed in a velvet coat and a scarlet waistcoat, approached with\nthe air of an emperor, followed by an individual in whom I recognized\nCharles, carrying a gun under each arm.\n\n\"That's the head-keeper,\" whispered Scroope; \"mind you treat him\nrespectfully.\"\n\nMuch alarmed, I took off my hat and waited.\n\n\"Do I speak to Mr. Allan Quatermain?\" said his majesty in a deep and\nrumbling voice, surveying me the while with a cold and disapproving eye.\n\nI intimated that he did.\n\n\"Then, sir,\" he went on, pausing a little at the \"sir,\" as though he\nsuspected me of being no more than an African colleague of his own, \"I\nhave been ordered by his lordship to bring you these guns, and I hope,\nsir, that you will be careful of them, as they are here on sale or\nreturn. Charles, explain the working of them there guns to this foreign\ngentleman, and in doing so keep the muzzles up _or_ down. They ain't\nloaded, it's true, but the example is always useful.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Keeper,\" I replied, growing somewhat nettled, \"but I\nthink that I am already acquainted with most that there is to learn\nabout guns.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it, sir,\" said his majesty with evident disbelief.\n\"Charles, I understand that Squire Scroope is going to load for the\ngentleman, which I hope he knows how to do with safety. His lordship's\norders are that you accompany them and carry the cartridges. And,\nCharles, you will please keep count of the number fired and what\nis killed dead, not reckoning runners. I'm sick of them stories of\nrunners.\"\n\nThese directions were given in a portentous stage aside which we were\nnot supposed to hear. They caused Scroope to snigger and Charles to\ngrin, but in me they raised a feeling of indignation.\n\nI took one of the guns and looked at it. It was a costly and beautifully\nmade weapon of the period, with an under-lever action.\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with the gun, sir,\" rumbled Red Waistcoat. \"If\nyou hold it straight it will do the rest. But keep the muzzle up, sir,\nkeep it up, for I know what the bore is without studying the same with\nmy eye. Also perhaps you won't take it amiss if I tell you that here at\nRagnall we hates a low pheasant. I mention it because the last gentleman\nwho came from foreign parts--he was French, he was--shot nothing all day\nbut one hen bird sitting just on the top of the brush, two beaters, his\nlordship's hat, and a starling.\"\n\nAt this point Scroope broke into a roar of idiotic laughter. Charles,\nfrom whom Fortune decreed that I was not to escape, after all, turned\nhis back and doubled up as though seized with sudden pain in the\nstomach, and I grew absolutely furious.\n\n\"Confound it, Mr. Keeper,\" I explained, \"what do you mean by lecturing\nme? Attend to your business, and I'll attend to mine.\"\n\nAt this moment who should appear from behind the angle of some\nbuilding--we were talking in the stableyard, near the gun-room--but Lord\nRagnall himself. I could see that he had overheard the conversation, for\nhe looked angry.\n\n\"Jenkins,\" he said, addressing the keeper, \"do what Mr. Quatermain has\nsaid and attend to your own business. Perhaps you are not aware that he\nhas shot more lions, elephants, and other big game than you have cats.\nBut, however that may be, it is not your place to try to instruct him or\nany of my guests. Now go and see to the beaters.\"\n\n\"Beg pardon, my lord,\" ejaculated Jenkins, his face, that was as florid\nas his waistcoat, turning quite pale; \"no offence meant, my lord, but\nelephants and lions don't fly, my lord, and those accustomed to such\nground varmin are apt to shoot low, my lord. Beaters all ready at the\nHunt Copse, my lord.\"\n\nThus speaking he backed himself out of sight. Lord Ragnall watched him\ngo, then said with a laugh:\n\n\"I apologize to you, Mr. Quatermain. That silly old fool was part of my\ninheritance, so to speak; and the joke of it is that he is himself the\nworst and most dangerous shot I ever saw. However, on the other hand,\nhe is the best rearer of pheasants in the county, so I put up with\nhim. Come in, now, won't you? Charles will look after your guns and\ncartridges.\"\n\nSo Scroope and I were taken through a side entrance into the big hall\nand there introduced to the other members of the shooting party, most of\nwhom were staying at the castle. They were famous shots. Indeed, I\nhad read of the prowess of some of them in _The Field_, a paper that I\nalways took in Africa, although often enough, when I was on my distant\nexpeditions, I did not see a copy of it for a year at a time.\n\nTo my astonishment I found that I knew one of these gentlemen. We had\nnot, it is true, met for a dozen years; but I seldom forget a face,\nand I was sure that I could not be mistaken in this instance. That mean\nappearance, those small, shifty grey eyes, that red, pointed nose could\nbelong to nobody except Van Koop, so famous in his day in South Africa\nin connexion with certain gigantic and most successful frauds that the\nlaw seemed quite unable to touch, of which frauds I had been one of the\nmany victims to the extent of \u00a3250, a large sum for me.\n\nThe last time we met there had been a stormy scene between us, which\nended in my declaring in my wrath that if I came across him on the veld\nI should shoot him at sight. Perhaps that was one of the reasons why Mr.\nvan Koop vanished from South Africa, for I may add that he was a cur\nof the first water. I believe that he had only just entered the room,\nhaving driven over from wherever he lived at some distance from Ragnall.\nAt any rate, he knew nothing of my presence at this shoot. Had he known\nI am quite sure that he would have been absent. He turned, and seeing\nme, ejaculated: \"Allan Quatermain, by heaven!\" beneath his breath, but\nin such a tone of astonishment that it attracted the attention of Lord\nRagnall, who was standing near.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. van Koop,\" I answered in a cheerful voice, \"Allan Quatermain,\nno other, and I hope you are as glad to see me as I am to see you.\"\n\n\"I think there is some mistake,\" said Lord Ragnall, staring at us. \"This\nis Sir Junius Fortescue, who used to be Mr. Fortescue.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I replied. \"I don't know that I ever remember his being called\nby that particular name, but I do know that we are old--friends.\"\n\nLord Ragnall moved away as though he did not wish to continue the\nconversation, which no one else had overheard, and Van Koop sidled up to\nme.\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain,\" he said in a low voice, \"circumstances have changed\nwith me since last we met.\"\n\n\"So I gather,\" I replied; \"but mine have remained much the same, and if\nit is convenient to you to repay me that \u00a3250 you owe me, with interest,\nI shall be much obliged. If not, I think I have a good story to tell\nabout you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Quatermain,\" he answered with a sort of smile which made me\nfeel inclined to kick him, \"you know I dispute that debt.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" I exclaimed. \"Well, perhaps you will dispute the story also.\nBut the question is, will you be believed when I give the proofs?\"\n\n\"Ever heard of the Statute of Limitations, Mr. Quatermain?\" he asked\nwith a sneer.\n\n\"Not where character is concerned,\" I replied stoutly. \"Now, what are\nyou going to do?\"\n\nHe reflected for a moment, and answered:\n\n\"Look here, Mr. Quatermain, you were always a bit of a sportsman, and\nI'll make you an offer. If I kill more birds than you do to-day, you\nshall promise to hold your tongue about my affairs in South Africa; and\nif you kill more than I do, you shall still hold your tongue, but I will\npay you that \u00a3250 and interest for six years.\"\n\nI also reflected for a moment, knowing that the man had something up his\nsleeve. Of course, I could refuse and make a scandal. But that was not\nin my line, and would not bring me nearer my \u00a3250, which, if I chanced\nto win, might find its way back to me.\n\n\"All right, done!\" I said.\n\n\"What is your bet, Sir Junius?\" asked Lord Ragnall, who was approaching\nagain.\n\n\"It is rather a long story,\" he answered, \"but, to put it shortly, years\nago, when I was travelling in Africa, Mr. Quatermain and I had a dispute\nas to a sum of \u00a35 which he thought I owed him, and to save argument\nabout a trifle we have agreed that I should shoot against him for it\nto-day.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Lord Ragnall rather seriously, for I could see that\nhe did not believe Van Koop's statement as to the amount of the bet;\nperhaps he had heard more than we thought. \"To be frank, Sir Junius, I\ndon't much care for betting--for that's what it comes to--here. Also I\nthink Mr. Quatermain said yesterday that he had never shot pheasants in\nEngland, so the match seems scarcely fair. However, you gentlemen know\nyour own business best. Only I must tell you both that if money is\nconcerned, I shall have to set someone whose decision will be final to\ncount your birds and report the number to me.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said Van Koop, or, rather, Sir Junius; but I answered nothing,\nfor, to tell the truth, already I felt ashamed of the whole affair.\n\nAs it happened, Lord Ragnall and I walked together ahead of the others,\nto the first covert, which was half a mile or more away.\n\n\"You have met Sir Junius before?\" he said to me interrogatively.\n\n\"I have met Mr. van Koop before,\" I answered, \"about twelve years\nsince, shortly after which he vanished from South Africa, where he was a\nwell-known and very successful--speculator.\"\n\n\"To reappear here. Ten years ago he bought a large property in this\nneighbourhood. Three years ago he became a baronet.\"\n\n\"How did a man like Van Koop become a baronet?\" I inquired.\n\n\"By purchase, I believe.\"\n\n\"By purchase! Are honours in England purchased?\"\n\n\"You are delightfully innocent, Mr. Quatermain, as a hunter from Africa\nshould be,\" said Lord Ragnall, laughing. \"Your friend----\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Lord Ragnall, I am a very humble person, not so elevated,\nindeed, as that gamekeeper of yours; therefore I should not venture to\ncall Sir Junius, late Mr. van Koop, my friend, at least in earnest.\"\n\nHe laughed again.\n\n\"Well, the individual with whom you make bets subscribed largely to the\nfunds of his party. I am telling you what I know to be true, though the\namount I do not know. It has been variously stated to be from fifteen\nto fifty thousand pounds, and, perhaps by coincidence, subsequently was\nsomehow created a baronet.\"\n\nI stared at him.\n\n\"That's all the story,\" he went on. \"I don't like the man myself, but he\nis a wonderful pheasant shot, which passes him everywhere. Shooting has\nbecome a kind of fetish in these parts, Mr. Quatermain. For instance, it\nis a tradition on this estate that we must kill more pheasants than on\nany other in the country, and therefore I have to ask the best guns, who\nare not always the best fellows. It annoys me, but it seems that I must\ndo what was done before me.\"\n\n\"Under those circumstances I should be inclined to give up the thing\naltogether, Lord Ragnall. Sport as sport is good, but when it becomes a\nbusiness it grows hateful. I know, who have had to follow it as a trade\nfor many years.\"\n\n\"That's an idea,\" he replied reflectively. \"Meanwhile, I do hope that\nyou will win back your--\u00a35 from Sir Junius. He is so vain that I would\ngladly give \u00a350 to see you do so.\"\n\n\"There is little chance of that,\" I said, \"for, as I told you, I have\nnever shot pheasants before. Still, I'll try, as you wish it.\"\n\n\"That's right. And look here, Mr. Quatermain, shoot well forward of\nthem. You see, I am venturing to advise you now, as you advised me\nyesterday. Shot does not travel so fast as ball, and the pheasant is a\nbird that is generally going much quicker than you think. Now, here we\nare. Charles will show you your stand. Good luck to you.\"\n\nTen minutes later the game began outside of a long covert, all the\nseven guns being posted within sight of each other. So occupied was I in\nwatching the preliminaries, which were quite new to me, that I allowed\nfirst a hare and then a hen pheasant to depart without firing at them,\nwhich hen pheasant, by the way, curved round and was beautifully killed\nby Van Koop, who stood two guns off upon my right.\n\n\"Look here, Allan,\" said Scroope, \"if you are going to beat your African\nfriend you had better wake up, for you won't do it by admiring the\nscenery or that squirrel on a tree.\"\n\nSo I woke up. Just at that moment there was a cry of \"cock forward.\"\nI thought it meant a cock pheasant, and was astonished when I saw a\nbeautiful brown bird with a long beak flitting towards me through the\ntops of the oak trees.\n\n\"Am I to shoot at that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course. It is a woodcock,\" answered Scroope.\n\nBy this time the brown bird was rocking past me within ten yards. I\nfired and killed it, for where it had been appeared nothing but a cloud\nof feathers. It was a quick and clever shot, or so I thought. But when\nCharles stepped out and picked from the ground only a beak and a head, a\ntitter of laughter went down the whole line of guns and loaders.\n\n\"I say, old chap,\" said Scroope, \"if you will use No. 3 shot, let your\nbirds get a little farther off you.\"\n\nThe incident upset me so much that immediately afterwards I missed three\neasy pheasants in succession, while Van Koop added two to his bag.\n\nScroope shook his head and Charles groaned audibly. Now that I was not\nin competition with his master he had become suddenly anxious that I\nshould win, for in some mysterious way the news of that bet had spread,\nand my adversary was not popular amongst the keeper class.\n\n\"Here you come again,\" said Scroope, pointing to an advancing pheasant.\n\nIt was an extraordinarily high pheasant, flushed, I think, outside the\ncovert by a stop, so high that, as it travelled down the line, although\nthree guns fired at it, including Van Koop, none of them seemed to touch\nit. Then I fired, and remembering Lord Ragnall's advice, far in front.\nIts flight changed. Still it travelled through the air, but with the\nmomentum of a stone to fall fifty yards to my right, dead.\n\n\"That's better!\" said Scroope, while Charles grinned all over his round\nface, muttering:\n\n\"Wiped his eye that time.\"\n\nThis shot seemed to give me confidence, and I improved considerably,\nthough, oddly enough, I found that it was the high and difficult\npheasants which I killed and the easy ones that I was apt to muff. But\nVan Koop, who was certainly a finished artist, killed both.\n\nAt the next stand Lord Ragnall, who had been observing my somewhat\nindifferent performance, asked me to stand back with him behind the\nother guns.\n\n\"I see the tall ones are your line, Mr. Quatermain,\" he said, \"and you\nwill get some here.\"\n\nOn this occasion we were placed in a dip between two long coverts which\nlay about three hundred yards apart. That which was being beaten proved\nfull of pheasants, and the shooting of those picked guns was really a\nthing to see. I did quite well here, nearly, but not altogether, as well\nas Lord Ragnall himself, though that is saying a great deal, for he was\na lovely shot.\n\n\"Bravo!\" he said at the end of the beat. \"I believe you have got a\nchance of winning your \u00a35, after all.\"\n\nWhen, however, at luncheon, more than an hour later, I found that I\nwas thirty pheasants behind my adversary, I shook my head, and so did\neverybody else. On the whole, that luncheon, of which we partook in\na keeper's house, was a very pleasant meal, though Van Koop talked so\ncontinuously and in such a boastful strain that I saw it irritated our\nhost and some of the other gentlemen, who were very pleasant people. At\nlast he began to patronize me, asking me how I had been getting on with\nmy \"elephant-potting\" of late years.\n\nI replied, \"Fairly well.\"\n\n\"Then you should tell our friends some of your famous stories, which\nI promise I won't contradict,\" he said, adding: \"You see, they are\ndifferent from us, and have no experience of big-game shooting.\"\n\n\"I did not know that you had any, either, Sir Junius,\" I answered,\nnettled. \"Indeed, I thought I remembered your telling me in Africa that\nthe only big game you had ever shot was an ox sick with the red-water.\nAnyway, shooting is a business with me, not an amusement, as it is to\nyou, and I do not talk shop.\"\n\nAt this he collapsed amid some laughter, after which Scroope, the most\nloyal of friends, began to repeat exploits of mine till my ears tingled,\nand I rose and went outside to look at the weather.\n\nIt had changed very much during luncheon. The fair promise of the\nmorning had departed, the sky was overcast, and a wind, blowing in\nstrong gusts, was rising rapidly, driving before it occasional scurries\nof snow.\n\n\"My word,\" said Lord Ragnall, who had joined me, \"the Lake\ncovert--that's our great stand here, you know--will take some shooting\nthis afternoon. We ought to kill seven hundred pheasants in it with this\nteam, but I doubt if we shall get five. Now, Mr. Quatermain, I am going\nto stand Sir Junius Fortescue and you back in the covert, where you\nwill have the best of it, as a lot of pheasants will never face the lake\nagainst this wind. What is more, I am coming with you, if I may, as\nsix guns are enough for this beat, and I don't mean to shoot any more\nto-day.\"\n\n\"I fear that you will be disappointed,\" I said nervously.\n\n\"Oh, no, I sha'n't,\" he answered. \"I tell you frankly that if only you\ncould have a season's practice, in my opinion you would make the best\npheasant shot of the lot of us. At present you don't quite understand\nthe ways of the birds, that's all; also those guns are strange to you.\nHave a glass of cherry brandy; it will steady your nerves.\"\n\nI drank the cherry brandy, and presently off we went. The covert we\nwere going to shoot, into which we had been driving pheasants all the\nmorning, must have been nearly a mile long. At the top end it was broad,\nnarrowing at the bottom to a width of about two hundred yards. Here it\nran into a horse-shoe shaped piece of water that was about fifty yards\nin breadth. Four of the guns were placed round the bow of this water,\nbut on its farther side, in such a position that the pheasants should\nstream over them to yet another covert behind at the top of a slope, Van\nKoop and I, however, were ordered to take our places, he to the right\nand I to the left, about seventy yards up the tongue in little glades in\nthe woodland, having the lake to our right and our left respectively.\nI noticed with dismay that we were so set that the guns below us on\nits farther side could note all that we did or did not do; also that a\nlittle band of watchers, among whom I recognized my friend the gunsmith,\nwere gathered in a place where, without interfering with us, they could\nsee the sport. On our way to the boat, however, which was to row us\nacross the water, an incident happened that put me in very good spirits\nand earned some applause.\n\nI was walking with Lord Ragnall, Scroope and Charles, about sixty yards\nclear of a belt of tall trees, when from far away on the other side of\nthe trees came a cry of \"Partridges over!\" in the hoarse voice of the\nred-waistcoated Jenkins, who was engaged in superintending the driving\nin of some low scrub before he joined his army at the top of the covert.\n\n\"Look out, Mr. Quatermain, they are coming this way,\" said Lord Ragnall,\nwhile Charles thrust a loaded gun into my hand.\n\nAnother moment and they appeared over the tree-tops, a big covey of them\nin a long, straggling line, travelling at I know not what speed, for a\nfierce gust from the rising gale had caught them. I fired at the first\nbird, which fell at my feet. I fired again, and another fell behind me.\nI snatched up the second gun and killed a third as it passed over me\nhigh up. Then, wheeling round, I covered the last retreating bird, and\nlo! it too fell, a very long shot indeed.\n\n\"By George!\" said Scroope, \"I never saw that done before,\" while Ragnall\nstared and Charles whistled.\n\nBut now I will tell the truth and expose all my weakness. The second\nbird was not the one I aimed at. I was behind it and caught that which\nfollowed. And in my vanity I did not own up, at least not till that\nevening.\n\nThe four dead partridges--there was not a runner among them--having been\ncollected amidst many congratulations, we went on and were punted across\nthe lake to the covert. As we entered the boat I observed that, in\naddition to the great bags, Charles was carrying a box of cartridges\nunder his arm, and asked him where he got it from.\n\nHe replied, from Mr. Popham--that was the gunsmith's name--who had\nbrought it with him in case I should not have enough. I made no remark,\nbut as I knew I had quite half of my cartridges left out of the three\nhundred and fifty that I had bought, I wondered to myself what kind of a\nshoot this was going to be.\n\nWell, we took up our stands, and while we were doing so, suddenly the\nwind increased to a tearing gale, which seemed to me to blow from all\npoints of the compass in turn. Rooks flying homewards, and pigeons\ndisturbed by the beaters were swept over us like drifting leaves; wild\nduck, of which I got one, went by like arrows; the great bare oaks\ntossed their boughs and groaned; while not far off a fir tree was blown\ndown, falling with a splash into the water.\n\n\"It's a wild afternoon,\" said Lord Ragnall, and as he spoke Van Koop\ncame from his stand, looking rather scared, and suggested that the shoot\nshould be given up.\n\nLord Ragnall asked me what I wished to do. I replied that I would rather\ngo on, but that I was in his hands.\n\n\"I think we are fairly safe in these open places, Sir Junius,\" he said;\n\"and as the pheasants have been so much disturbed already, it does not\nmuch matter if they are blown about a bit. But if you are of another\nopinion, perhaps you had better get out of it and stand with the others\nover the lake. I'll send for my guns and take your place.\"\n\nOn hearing this Van Koop changed his mind and said that he would go on.\n\nSo the beat began. At first the wind blew from behind us, and pheasants\nin increasing numbers passed over our heads, most of them rather low,\nto the guns on the farther side of the water, who, skilled though they\nwere, did not make very good work with them. We had been instructed not\nto fire at birds going forward, so I let these be. Van Koop, however,\ndid not interpret the order in the same spirit, for he loosed at\nseveral, killing one or two and missing others.\n\n\"That fellow is no sportsman,\" I heard Lord Ragnall remark. \"I suppose\nit is the bet.\"\n\nThen he sent Charles to ask him to desist.\n\nShortly after this the gale worked round to the north and settled there,\nblowing with ever-increasing violence. The pheasants, however, still\nflew forward in the shelter of the trees, for they were making for the\ncovert on the hill, where they had been bred. But when they got into the\nopen and felt the full force of the wind, quite four out of six of\nthem turned and came back at a most fearful pace, many so high as to be\nalmost out of shot.\n\nFor the next three-quarters of an hour or more--as I think I have\nexplained, the beat was a very long one--I had such covert shooting as\nI suppose I shall never see again. High above those shrieking trees,\nor over the lake to my left, flashed the wind-driven pheasants in an\nendless procession. Oddly enough, I found that this wild work suited me,\nfor as time went on and the pheasants grew more and more impossible, I\nshot better and better. One after another down they came far behind me\nwith a crash in the brushwood or a splash in the lake, till the\nguns grew almost too hot to hold. There were so many of them that I\ndiscovered I could pick my shots; also that nine out of ten were caught\nby the wind and curved at a certain angle, and that the time to fire was\njust before they took the curve. The excitement was great and the\nsport splendid, as anyone will testify who has shot December pheasants\nbreaking back over the covert and in a tearing gale. Van Koop also\nwas doing very well, but the guns in front got comparatively little\nshooting. They were forced to stand there, poor fellows, and watch our\nperformance from afar.\n\nAs the thing drew towards an end the birds came thicker and thicker, and\nI shot, as I have said, better and better. This may be judged from the\nfact that, notwithstanding their height and tremendous pace, I killed\nmy last thirty pheasants with thirty-five cartridges. The final bird\nof all, a splendid cock, appeared by himself out of nothingness when we\nthought that all was done. I think it must have been flushed from the\ncovert on the hill, or been turned back just as it reached it by the\nresistless strength of the storm. Over it came, so high above us that it\nlooked quite small in the dark snow-scud.\n\n\"Too far--no use!\" said Lord Ragnall, as I lifted the gun.\n\nStill, I fired, holding I know not how much in front, and lo! that\npheasant died in mid air, falling with a mighty splash near the bank of\nthe lake, but at a great distance behind us. The shot was so remarkable\nthat everyone who saw it, including most of the beaters, who had passed\nus by now, uttered a cheer, and the red-waistcoated old Jenkins, who had\nstopped by us, remarked: \"Well, bust me if that bain't a master one!\"\n\nScroope made me angry by slapping me so hard upon the back that it hurt,\nand nearly caused me to let off the other barrel of the gun. Charles\nseemed to become one great grin, and Lord Ragnall, with a brief\ncongratulatory \"Never enjoyed a shoot so much in my life,\" called to the\nmen who were posted behind us to pick up all the dead pheasants, being\ncareful to keep mine apart from those of Sir Junius Fortescue.\n\n\"You should have a hundred and forty-three at this stand,\" he said,\n\"allowing for every possible runner. Charles and I make the same total.\"\n\nI remarked that I did not think there were many runners, as the No. 3\nshot had served me very well, and getting into the boat was rowed to the\nother side, where I received more congratulations. Then, as all further\nshooting was out of the question because of the weather, we walked back\nto the castle to tea.\n\nAs I emptied my cup Lord Ragnall, who had left the room, returned and\nasked us to come and see the game. So we went, to find it laid out in\nendless lines upon the snow-powdered grass in the quadrangle of the\ncastle, arranged in one main and two separate lots.\n\n\"Those are yours and Sir Junius's,\" said Scroope. \"I wonder which of you\nhas won. I'll put a sovereign on you, old fellow.\"\n\n\"Then you're a donkey for your pains,\" I answered, feeling vexed, for at\nthat moment I had forgotten all about the bet.\n\nI do not remember how many pheasants were killed altogether, but the\ntotal was much smaller than had been hoped for, because of the gale.\n\n\"Jenkins,\" said Lord Ragnall presently to Red Waistcoat, \"how many have\nyou to the credit of Sir Junius Fortescue?\"\n\n\"Two hundred and seventy-seven, my lord, twelve hares, two woodcocks,\nand three pigeons.\"\n\n\"And how many to that of Mr. Quatermain?\" adding: \"I must remind\nyou both, gentlemen, that the birds have been picked as carefully as\npossible and kept unmixed, and therefore that the figures given by\nJenkins must be considered as final.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" I answered, but Van Koop said nothing. Then, while we all\nwaited anxiously, came the amazing answer:\n\n\"Two hundred and seventy-seven pheasants, my lord, same number as those\nof Sir Junius, Bart., fifteen hares, three pigeons, four partridges, one\nduck, and a beak--I mean a woodcock.\"\n\n\"Then it seems you have won your \u00a35, Mr. Quatermain, upon which I\ncongratulate you,\" said Lord Ragnall.\n\n\"Stop a minute,\" broke in Van Koop. \"The bet was as to pheasants; the\nother things don't count.\"\n\n\"I think the term used was 'birds,'\" I remarked. \"But to be frank, when\nI made it I was thinking of pheasants, as no doubt Sir Junius was also.\nTherefore, if the counting is correct, there is a dead heat and the\nwager falls through.\"\n\n\"I am sure we all appreciate the view you take of the matter,\" said Lord\nRagnall, \"for it might be argued another way. In these circumstances Sir\nJunius keeps his \u00a35 in his pocket. It is unlucky for you, Quatermain,\"\nhe added, dropping the \"mister,\" \"that the last high pheasant you shot\ncan't be found. It fell into the lake, you remember, and, I suppose,\nswam ashore and ran.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"especially as I could have sworn that it was quite\ndead.\"\n\n\"So could I, Quatermain; but the fact remains that it isn't there.\"\n\n\"If we had all the pheasants that we think fall dead our bags would\nbe much bigger than they are,\" remarked Van Koop, with a look of great\nrelief upon his face, adding in his horrid, patronizing way: \"Still,\nyou shot uncommonly well, Quatermain. I'd no idea you would run me so\nclose.\"\n\nI felt inclined to answer, but didn't. Only Lord Ragnall said:\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain shot more than well. His performance in the Lake covert\nwas the most brilliant that I have ever seen. When you went in there\ntogether, Sir Junius, you were thirty ahead of him, and you fired\nseventeen more cartridges at the stand.\"\n\nThen, just as we turned to go, something happened. The round-eyed\nCharles ran puffing into the quadrangle, followed by another man with\na dog, who had been specially set to pick my birds, and carrying in his\nhand a much-bedraggled cock pheasant without a tail.\n\n\"I've got him, my lord,\" he gasped, for he had run very fast; \"the\nlittle gent's--I mean that which he killed in the clouds with the last\nshot he fired. It had gone right down into the mud and stuck there. Tom\nand me fished him up with a pole.\"\n\nLord Ragnall took the bird and looked at it. It was almost cold, but\nevidently freshly killed, for the limbs were quite flexible.\n\n\"That turns the scale in favour of Mr. Quatermain,\" he said, \"so, Sir\nJunius, you had better pay your money and congratulate him, as I do.\"\n\n\"I protest,\" exclaimed Van Koop, looking very angry and meaner than\nusual. \"How am I to know that this was Mr. Quatermain's pheasant? The\nsum involved is more than \u00a35 and I feel it is my duty to protest.\"\n\n\"Because my men say so, Sir Junius; moreover, seeing the height from\nwhich the bird fell, their story is obviously true.\"\n\nThen he examined the pheasant further, pointing out that it appeared\nto have only one wound--a shot through the throat almost exactly at the\nroot of the beak, of which shot there was no mark of exit. \"What sized\nshot were you using, Sir Junius?\" he asked.\n\n\"No. 4 at the last stand.\"\n\n\"And you were using No. 3, Mr. Quatermain. Now, was any other gun using\nNo. 3?\"\n\nAll shook their heads.\n\n\"Jenkins, open that bird's head. I think the shot that killed it will be\nfound in the brain.\"\n\nJenkins obeyed, using a penknife cleverly enough. Pressed against the\nbone of the skull he found the shot.\n\n\"No. 3 it is, sure enough, my lord,\" he said.\n\n\"You will agree that settles the matter, Sir Junius,\" said Lord Ragnall.\n\"And now, as a bet has been made here it had better be paid.\"\n\n\"I have not enough money on me,\" said Van Koop sulkily.\n\n\"I think your banker is mine,\" said Lord Ragnall quietly, \"so you can\nwrite a cheque in the house. Come in, all of you, it is cold in this\nwind.\"\n\nSo we went into the smoking-room, and Lord Ragnall, who, I could see,\nwas annoyed, instantly fetched a blank cheque from his study and handed\nit to Van Koop in rather a pointed manner.\n\nHe took it, and turning to me, said:\n\n\"I remember the capital sum, but how much is the interest? Sorry to\ntrouble you, but I am not very good at figures.\"\n\n\"Then you must have changed a good deal during the last twelve years,\nSir Junius,\" I could not help saying. \"Still, never mind the interest, I\nshall be quite satisfied with the principal.\"\n\nSo he filled up the cheque for \u00a3250 and threw it down on the table\nbefore me, saying something about its being a bother to mix up business\nwith pleasure.\n\nI took the draft, saw that it was correct though rather illegible, and\nproceeded to dry it by waving it in the air. As I did so it came into my\nmind that I would not touch the money of this successful scamp, won back\nfrom him in such a way.\n\nYielding to a perhaps foolish impulse, I said:\n\n\"Lord Ragnall, this cheque is for a debt which years ago I wrote off\nas lost. At luncheon to-day you were talking of a Cottage Hospital for\nwhich you are trying to get up an endowment fund in this neighbourhood,\nand in answer to a question from you Sir Junius Fortescue said that he\nhad not as yet made any subscription to its fund. Will you allow me to\nhand you Sir Junius's subscription--to be entered in his name, if you\nplease?\" And I passed him the cheque, which was drawn to myself or\nbearer.\n\nHe looked at the amount, and seeing that it was not \u00a35, but \u00a3250,\nflushed, then asked:\n\n\"What do you say to this act of generosity on the part of Mr.\nQuatermain, Sir Junius?\"\n\nThere was no answer, because Sir Junius had gone. I never saw him\nagain, for years ago the poor man died quite disgraced. His passion for\nsemi-fraudulent speculations reasserted itself, and he became a bankrupt\nin conditions which caused him to leave the country for America, where\nhe was killed in a railway accident while travelling as an immigrant. I\nhave heard, however, that he was not asked to shoot at Ragnall any more.\n\nThe cheque was passed to the credit of the Cottage Hospital, but not, as\nI had requested, as a subscription from Sir Junius Fortescue. A couple\nof years later, indeed, I learned that this sum of money was used to\nbuild a little room in that institution to accommodate sick children,\nwhich room was named the Allan Quatermain ward.\n\nNow, I have told this story of that December shoot because it was the\nbeginning of my long and close friendship with Ragnall.\n\nWhen he found that Van Koop had gone away without saying good-bye, Lord\nRagnall made no remark. Only he took my hand and shook it.\n\nI have only to add that, although, except for the element of competition\nwhich entered into it, I enjoyed this day's shooting very much indeed,\nwhen I came to count up its cost I felt glad that I had not been\nasked to any more such entertainments.

Then Scroope\nappeared, as, being unable to find my way about the long passages of\nthat great old castle, I had asked him to do, and we descended together\nto the large drawing-room.\n\nIt was a splendid apartment, only used upon state occasions, lighted,\nI should think, with at least two or three hundred wax candles, which\nthrew a soft glow over the panelled and pictured walls, the priceless\nantique furniture, and the bejewelled ladies who were gathered there. To\nmy mind there never was and never will be any artificial light to equal\nthat of wax candles in sufficient quantity. The company was large; I\nthink thirty sat down to dinner that night, which was given to introduce\nLord Ragnall's future wife to the neighbourhood, whereof she was\ndestined to be the leader.\n\nMiss Manners, who was looking very happy and charming in her jewels and\nfine clothes, joined us at once, and informed Scroope that \"she\" was\njust coming; the maid in the cloakroom had told her so.\n\n\"Is she?\" replied Scroope indifferently. \"Well, so long as you have come\nI don't care about anyone else.\"\n\nThen he told her she was looking beautiful, and stared at her with such\naffection that I fell back a step or two and contemplated a picture of\nJudith vigorously engaged in cutting off the head of Holofernes.\n\nPresently the large door at the end of the room was thrown open and the\nimmaculate Savage, who was acting as a kind of master of the ceremonies,\nannounced in well-bred but penetrating tones, \"Lady Longden and the\nHonourable Miss Holmes.\" I stared, like everybody else, but for a while\nher ladyship filled my eye. She was an ample and, to my mind, rather\nawful-looking person, clad in black satin--she was a widow--and very\nlarge diamonds. Her hair was white, her nose was hooked, her dark eyes\nwere penetrating, and she had a bad cold in her head. That was all I\nfound time to notice about her, for suddenly her daughter came into my\nline of vision.\n\nTruly she was a lovely girl, or rather, young woman, for she must\nhave been two or three-and-twenty. Not very tall, her proportions were\nrounded and exquisite, and her movements as graceful as those of a doe.\nAltogether she was doe-like, especially in the fineness of her lines\nand her large and liquid eyes. She was a dark beauty, with rich brown,\nwaving hair, a clear olive complexion, a perfectly shaped mouth and very\nred lips. To me she looked more Italian or Spanish than Anglo-Saxon, and\nI believe that, as a matter of fact, she had some southern blood in her\non her father's side. She wore a dress of soft rose colour, and her only\nornaments were a string of pearls and a single red camellia. I could see\nbut one blemish, if it were a blemish, in her perfect person, and that\nwas a curious white mark upon her breast, which in its shape exactly\nresembled the crescent moon.\n\nThe face, however, impressed me with other than its physical qualities.\nIt was bright, intelligent, sympathetic and, just now, happy. But I\nthought it more, I thought it mystical. Something that her mother said\nto her, probably about her dress, caused her smile to vanish for a\nmoment, and then, from beneath it as it were, appeared this shadow of\ninnate mysticism. In a second it was gone and she was laughing again;\nbut I, who am accustomed to observe, had caught it, perhaps alone of all\nthat company. Moreover, it reminded me of something.\n\nWhat was it? Ah! I knew. A look that sometimes I had seen upon the face\nof a certain Zulu lady named Mameena, especially at the moment of her\nwonderful and tragic death. The thought made me shiver a little; I could\nnot tell why, for certainly, I reflected, this high-placed and fortunate\nEnglish girl had nothing in common with that fate-driven Child of Storm,\nwhose dark and imperial spirit dwelt in the woman called Mameena. They\nwere as far apart as Zululand is from Essex. Yet it was quite sure that\nboth of them had touch with hidden things.\n\nLord Ragnall, looking more like a splendid Van Dyck than ever in his\nevening dress, stepped forward to greet his fianc\u00e9e and her mother with\na courtly bow, and I turned again to continue my contemplation of the\nstalwart Judith and the very ugly head of Holofernes. Presently I was\naware of a soft voice--a very rich and thrilling voice--asking quite\nclose to me:\n\n\"Which is he? Oh! you need not answer, dear. I know him from the\ndescription.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Lord Ragnall to Miss Holmes--for it was she--\"you are\nquite right. I will introduce you to him presently. But, love, whom do\nyou wish to take you in to dinner? I can't--your mother, you know; and\nas there are no titles here to-night, you may make your choice. Would\nyou like old Dr. Jeffreys, the clergyman?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied, with quiet firmness, \"I know him; he took me in once\nbefore. I wish Mr. Allan Quatermain to take me in. He is interesting,\nand I want to hear about Africa.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he answered, \"and he _is_ more interesting than all the\nrest put together. But, Luna, why are you always thinking and talking\nabout Africa? One might imagine that you were going to live there.\"\n\n\"So I may one day,\" she answered dreamily. \"Who knows where one has\nlived, or where one will live!\" And again I saw that mystic look come\ninto her face.\n\nI heard no more of that conversation, which it is improbable that anyone\nwhose ears had not been sharpened by a lifetime of listening in great\nsilences would have caught at all. To tell the truth, I made myself\nscarce, slipping off to the other end of the big room in the hope of\nevading the kind intentions of Miss Holmes. I have a great dislike\nof being put out of my place, and I felt that among all these local\ncelebrities it was not fitting that I should be selected to take in\nthe future bride on an occasion of this sort. But it was of no use, for\npresently Lord Ragnall hunted me up, bringing the young lady with him.\n\n\"Let me introduce you to Miss Holmes, Quatermain,\" he said. \"She is\nanxious that you should take her in to dinner, if you will be so kind.\nShe is very interested in--in----\"\n\n\"Africa,\" I suggested.\n\n\"In Mr. Quatermain, who, I am told, is one of the greatest hunters in\nAfrica,\" she corrected me, with a dazzling smile.\n\nI bowed, not knowing what to say. Lord Ragnall laughed and vanished,\nleaving us together. Dinner was announced. Presently we were wending in\nthe centre of a long and glittering procession across the central hall\nto the banqueting chamber, a splendid room with a roof like a church\nthat was said to have been built in the times of the Plantagenets. Here\nMr. Savage, who evidently had been looking out for her future ladyship,\nconducted us to our places, which were upon the left of Lord Ragnall,\nwho sat at the head of the broad table with Lady Longden on his right.\nThen the old clergyman, Dr. Jeffreys, a pompous and rather frowsy\necclesiastic, said grace, for grace was still in fashion at such feasts\nin those days, asking Heaven to make us truly thankful for the dinner we\nwere about to consume.\n\nCertainly there was a great deal to be thankful for in the eating and\ndrinking line, but of all I remember little, except a general vision of\nsilver dishes, champagne, splendour, and things I did not want to eat\nbeing constantly handed to me. What I do remember is Miss Holmes, and\nnothing but Miss Holmes; the charm of her conversation, the light of her\nbeautiful eyes, the fragrance of her hair, her most flattering interest\nin my unworthy self. To tell the truth, we got on \"like fire in the\nwinter grass,\" as the Zulus say, and when that dinner was over the grass\nwas still burning.\n\nI don't think that Lord Ragnall quite liked it, but fortunately Lady\nLongden was a talkative person. First she conversed about her cold in\nthe head, sneezing at intervals, poor soul, and being reduced to send\nfor another handkerchief after the entr\u00e9es. Then she got off upon\nbusiness matters; to judge from the look of boredom on her host's face,\nI think it must have been of settlements. Three times did I hear him\nrefer her to the lawyers--without avail. Lastly, when he thought he had\nescaped, she embarked upon a quite vigorous argument with Dr. Jeffreys\nabout church matters--I gathered that she was \"low\" and he was\n\"high\"--in which she insisted upon his lordship acting as referee.\n\n\"Do try and keep your attention fixed, George,\" I heard her say\nseverely. \"To allow it to wander when high spiritual affairs are under\ndiscussion (sneeze) is scarcely reverent. Could you tell the man to shut\nthat door? The draught is dreadful. It is quite impossible for you to\nagree with both of us, as you say you do, seeing that metaphorically Dr.\nJeffreys is at one pole and I am at the other.\" (Sneeze.)\n\n\"Then I wish I were at the Tropic of Cancer,\" I heard him mutter with a\ngroan.\n\nIn vain; he had to keep his \"attention fixed\" on this point for the next\nthree-quarters of an hour. So as Miss Manners was at the other side\nof me, and Scroope, unhampered by the presence of any prospective\nmother-in-law, was at the other side of her, for all practical purposes\nMiss Holmes and I were left alone.\n\nShe began by saying:\n\n\"I hear you beat Sir Junius Fortescue out shooting to-day, and won a lot\nof money from him which you gave to the Cottage Hospital. I don't like\nshooting, and I don't like betting; and it's strange, because you don't\nlook like a man who bets. But I detest Sir Junius Fortescue, and that is\na bond of union between us.\"\n\n\"I never said I detested him.\"\n\n\"No, but I am sure you do. Your face changed when I mentioned his name.\"\n\n\"As it happens, you are right. But, Miss Holmes, I should like you to\nunderstand that you were also right when you said I did not look like a\nbetting man.\" And I told her some of the story of Van Koop and the \u00a3250.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, when I had finished, \"I always felt sure he was a\nhorror. And my mother wanted me, just because he pretended to be low\nchurch--but that's a secret.\"\n\nThen I congratulated her upon her approaching marriage, saying what\na joyful thing it was now and again to see everything going in real,\nhappy, storybook fashion: beauty, male and female, united by love, high\nrank, wealth, troops of friends, health of body, a lovely and an ancient\nhome in a settled land where dangers do not come--at present--respect\nand affection of crowds of dependants, the prospect of a high and useful\ncareer of a sort whereof the door is shut to most people, everything\nin short that human beings who are not actually royalty could desire or\ndeserve. Indeed after my second glass of champagne I grew quite eloquent\non these and kindred points, being moved thereto by memories of the\nmisery that is in the world which formed so great a contrast to the lot\nof this striking and brilliant pair.\n\nShe listened to me attentively and answered:\n\n\"Thank you for your kind thoughts and wishes. But does it not strike\nyou, Mr. Quatermain, that there is something ill-omened in such talk? I\nbelieve that it does; that as you finished speaking it occurred to you\nthat after all the future is as much veiled from all of us as--as the\npicture which hangs behind its curtain of rose-coloured silk in Lord\nRagnall's study is from you.\"\n\n\"How did you know that?\" I asked sharply in a low voice. For by the\nstrangest of coincidences, as I concluded my somewhat old-fashioned\nlittle speech of compliments, this very reflection had entered my\nmind, and with it the memory of the veiled picture which Mr. Savage had\npointed out to me on the previous morning.\n\n\"I can't say, Mr. Quatermain, but I did know it. You were thinking of\nthe picture, were you not?\"\n\n\"And if I was,\" I said, avoiding a direct reply, \"what of it? Though\nit is hidden from everybody else, he has only to draw the curtain and\nsee--you.\"\n\n\"Supposing he should draw the curtain one day and see nothing, Mr.\nQuatermain?\"\n\n\"Then the picture would have been stolen, that is all, and he would have\nto search for it till he found it again, which doubtless sooner or later\nhe would do.\"\n\n\"Yes, sooner or later. But where? Perhaps you have lost a picture or two\nin your time, Mr. Quatermain, and are better able to answer the question\nthan I am.\"\n\nThere was silence for a few moments, for this talk of lost pictures\nbrought back memories which choked me.\n\nThen she began to speak again, low, quickly, and with suppressed\npassion, but acting wonderfully all the while. Knowing that eyes were on\nher, her gestures and the expression of her face were such as might\nhave been those of any young lady of fashion who was talking of everyday\naffairs, such as dancing, or flowers, or jewels. She smiled and even\nlaughed occasionally. She played with the golden salt-cellar in front\nof her and, upsetting a little of the salt, threw it over her left\nshoulder, appearing to ask me if I were a victim of that ancient habit,\nand so on.\n\nBut all the while she was talking deeply of deep things, such as I\nshould never have thought would pass her mind. This was the substance\nof what she said, for I cannot set it all down verbatim; after so many\nyears my memory fails me.\n\n\"I am not like other women. Something moves me to tell you so, something\nvery real and powerful which pushes me as a strong man might. It is odd,\nbecause I have never spoken to anyone else like that, not to my mother\nfor instance, or even to Lord Ragnall. They would neither of them\nunderstand, although they would misunderstand differently. My mother\nwould think I ought to see a doctor--and if you knew that doctor! He,\"\nand she nodded towards Lord Ragnall, \"would think that my engagement had\nupset me, or that I had grown rather more religious than I ought to be\nat my age, and been reflecting too much--well, on the end of all things.\nFrom a child I have understood that I am a mystery set in the midst of\nmany other mysteries. It all came to me one night when I was about nine\nyears old. I seemed to see the past and the future, although I could\ngrasp neither. Such a long, long past and such an infinite future. I\ndon't know what I saw, and still see sometimes. It comes in a flash, and\nis in a flash forgotten. My mind cannot hold it. It is too big for\nmy mind; you might as well try to pack Dr. Jeffreys there into this\nwineglass. Only two facts remain written on my heart. The first is\nthat there is trouble ahead of me, curious and unusual trouble; and\nthe second, that permanently, continually, I, or a part of me, have\nsomething to do with Africa, a country of which I know nothing\nexcept from a few very dull books. Also, by the way--this is a new\nthought--that I have a great deal to do with _you_. That is why I am\nso interested in Africa and you. Tell me about Africa and yourself now,\nwhile we have the chance.\" And she ended rather abruptly, adding in a\nlouder voice, \"You have lived there all your life, have you not, Mr.\nQuatermain?\"\n\n\"I rather think your mother would be right--about the doctor, I mean,\" I\nsaid.\n\n\"You _say_ that, but you don't _believe_ it. Oh! you are very\ntransparent, Mr. Quatermain--at least, to me.\"\n\nSo, hurriedly enough, for these subjects seemed to be uncomfortable,\neven dangerous in a sense, I began to talk of the first thing about\nAfrica that I remembered--namely, of the legend of the Holy Flower that\nwas guarded by a huge ape, of which I had heard from a white man who was\nsupposed to be rather mad, who went by the name of Brother John. Also I\ntold her that there was something in it, as I had with me a specimen of\nthe flower.\n\n\"Oh! show it me,\" she said.\n\nI replied that I feared I could not, as it was locked away in a safe in\nLondon, whither I was returning on the morrow. I promised, however, to\nsend her a life-sized water-colour drawing of which I had caused several\nto be made. She asked me if I were going to look for this flower, and\nI said that I hoped so if I could make the necessary arrangements. Next\nshe asked me if there chanced to be any other African quests upon which\nI had set my mind. I replied that there were several. For instance, I\nhad heard vaguely through Brother John, and indirectly from one or\ntwo other sources, of the existence of a certain tribe in East Central\nAfrica--Arabs or semi-Arabs--who were reported to worship a child that\nalways remained a child. This child, I took it, was a dwarf; but as I\nwas interested in native religious customs which were infinite in their\nvariety, I should much like to find out the truth of the matter.\n\n\"Talking of Arabs,\" she broke in, \"I will tell you a curious story. Once\nwhen I was a little girl, eight or nine years of age--it was just before\nthat kind of awakening of which I have spoken to you--I was playing in\nKensington Gardens, for we lived in London at the time, in the charge of\nmy nurse-governess. She was talking to some young man who she said was\nher cousin, and told me to run about with my hoop and not to bother. I\ndrove the hoop across the grass to some elm trees. From behind one of\nthe trees came out two tall men dressed in white robes and turbans, who\nlooked to me like scriptural characters in a picture-book. One was an\nelderly man with flashing, black eyes, hooked nose, and a long grey\nbeard. The other was much younger, but I do not remember him so well.\nThey were both brown in colour, but otherwise almost like white men; not\nNegroes by any means. My hoop hit the elder man, and I stood still, not\nknowing what to say. He bowed politely and picked it up, but did not\noffer to return it to me. They talked together rapidly, and one of them\npointed to the moon-shaped birthmark which you see I have upon my\nneck, for it was hot weather, and I was wearing a low-cut frock. It was\nbecause of this mark that my father named me Luna. The elder of the two\nsaid in broken English:\n\n\"'What is your name, pretty little girl?'\n\n\"I told him it was Luna Holmes. Then he drew from his robe a box made of\nscented wood, and, opening it, took out some sweetmeat which looked\nas if it had been frozen, and gave me a piece that, being very fond of\nsweet, I put into my mouth. Next, he bowled the hoop along the ground\ninto the shadow of the trees--it was evening time and beginning to grow\ndark--saying, 'Run, catch it, little girl!'\n\n\"I began to run, but something in the taste of that sweet caused me to\ndrop it from my lips. Then all grew misty, and the next thing I remember\nwas finding myself in the arms of the younger Eastern, with the nurse\nand her 'cousin,' a stalwart person like a soldier, standing in front of\nus.\n\n\"'Little girl go ill,' said the elder Arab. 'We seek policeman.'\n\n\"'You drop that child,' answered the 'cousin,' doubling his fists. Then\nI grew faint again, and when I came to myself the two white-robed men\nhad gone. All the way home my governess scolded me for accepting sweets\nfrom strangers, saying that if my parents came to know of it, I should\nbe whipped and sent to bed. Of course, I begged her not to tell them,\nand at last she consented. Do you know, I think you are the first to\nwhom I have ever mentioned the matter, of which I am sure the governess\nnever breathed a word, though after that, whenever we walked in the\ngardens, her 'cousin' always came to look after us. In the end I think\nshe married him.\"\n\n\"You believe the sweet was drugged?\" I asked.\n\nShe nodded. \"There was something very strange in it. It was a night\nor two after I had tasted it that I had what just now I called my\nawakening, and began to think about Africa.\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen these men again, Miss Holmes?\"\n\n\"No, never.\"\n\nAt this moment I heard Lady Longden say, in a severe voice:\n\n\"My dear Luna, I am sorry to interrupt your absorbing conversation, but\nwe are all waiting for you.\"\n\nSo they were, for to my horror I saw that everyone was standing up\nexcept ourselves.\n\nMiss Holmes departed in a hurry, while Scroope whispered in my ear with\na snigger:\n\n\"I say, Allan, if you carry on like that with his young lady, his\nlordship will be growing jealous of you.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" I said sharply. But there was something in his\nremark, for as Lord Ragnall passed on his way to the other end of the\ntable, he said in a low voice and with rather a forced smile:\n\n\"Well, Quatermain, I hope your dinner has not been as dull as mine,\nalthough your appetite seemed so poor.\"\n\nThen I reflected that I could not remember having eaten a thing since\nthe first entr\u00e9e. So overcome was I that, rejecting all Scroope's\nattempts at conversation, I sat silent, drinking port and filling up\nwith dates, until not long afterwards we went into the drawing-room,\nwhere I sat down as far from Miss Holmes as possible, and looked at a\nbook of views of Jerusalem.\n\nWhile I was thus engaged, Lord Ragnall, pitying my lonely condition, or\nbeing instigated thereto by Miss Holmes, I know not which, came up and\nbegan to chat with me about African big-game shooting. Also he asked me\nwhat was my permanent address in that country. I told him Durban, and in\nmy turn asked why he wanted to know.\n\n\"Because Miss Holmes seems quite crazy about the place, and I expect I\nshall be dragged out there one day,\" he replied, quite gloomily. It was\na prophetic remark.\n\nAt this moment our conversation was interrupted by Lady Longden, who\ncame to bid her future son-in-law good night. She said that she must go\nto bed, and put her feet in mustard and water as her cold was so bad,\nwhich left me wondering whether she meant to carry out this operation\nin bed. I recommended her to take quinine, a suggestion she acknowledged\nrather inconsequently by remarking in somewhat icy tones that she\nsupposed I sat up to all hours of the night in Africa. I replied that\nfrequently I did, waiting for the sun to rise next day, for that member\nof the British aristocracy irritated me.\n\nThus we parted, and I never saw her again. She died many years ago,\npoor soul, and I suppose is now freezing her former acquaintances in\nthe Shades, for I cannot imagine that she ever had a friend. They talk\na great deal about the influences of heredity nowadays, but I don't\nbelieve very much in them myself. Who, for instance, could conceive\nthat persons so utterly different in every way as Lady Longden and her\ndaughter, Miss Holmes, could be mother and child? Our bodies, no doubt,\nwe do inherit from our ancestors, but not our individualities. These\ncome from far away.\n\nA good many of the guests went at the same time, having long distances\nto drive on that cold frosty night, although it was only just ten\no'clock. For as was usual at that period even in fashionable houses, we\nhad dined at seven.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nHAR\u00dbT AND MAR\u00dbT\n\nAfter Lord Ragnall had seen his guests to the door in the old-fashioned\nmanner, he returned and asked me if I played cards, or whether I\npreferred music. I was assuring him that I hated the sight of a card\nwhen Mr. Savage appeared in his silent way and respectfully inquired\nof his lordship whether any gentleman was staying in the house whose\nChristian name was _Here-come-a-zany_. Lord Ragnall looked at him with a\nsearching eye as though he suspected him of being drunk, and then asked\nwhat he meant by such a ridiculous question.\n\n\"I mean, my lord,\" replied Mr. Savage with a touch of offence in his\ntone, \"that two foreign individuals in white clothes have arrived at\nthe castle, stating that they wish to speak at once with a _Mr.\nHere-come-a-zany_ who is staying here. I told them to go away as the\nbutler said he could make nothing of their talk, but they only sat down\nin the snow and said they would wait for _Here-come-a-zany_.\"\n\n\"Then you had better put them in the old guardroom, lock them up with\nsomething to eat, and send the stable-boy for the policeman, who is a\nzany if ever anybody was. I expect they are after the pheasants.\"\n\n\"Stop a bit,\" I said, for an idea had occurred to me. \"The message may\nbe meant for me, though I can't conceive who sent it. My native name is\nMacumazana, which possibly Mr. Savage has not caught quite correctly.\nShall I go to see these men?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't do that in this cold, Quatermain,\" Lord Ragnall answered.\n\"Did they say what they are, Savage?\"\n\n\"I made out that they were conjurers, my lord. At least when I told them\nto go away one of them said, 'You will go first, gentleman.' Then, my\nlord, I heard a hissing sound in my coat-tail pocket and, putting my\nhand into it, I found a large snake which dropped on the ground and\nvanished. It quite paralysed me, my lord, and while I stood there\nwondering whether I was bitten, a mouse jumped out of the kitchenmaid's\nhair. She had been laughing at their dress, my lord, but _now_ she's\nscreaming in hysterics.\"\n\nThe solemn aspect of Mr. Savage as he narrated these unholy marvels was\nsuch that, like the kitchenmaid, we both burst into ill-timed merriment.\nAttracted by our laughter, Miss Holmes, Miss Manners, with whom she was\ntalking, and some of the other guests, approached and asked what was the\nmatter.\n\n\"Savage here declares that there are two conjurers in the kitchen\npremises, who have been producing snakes out of his pocket and mice from\nthe hair of one of the maids, and who want to see Mr. Quatermain,\" Lord\nRagnall answered.\n\n\"Conjurers! Oh, do have them in, George,\" exclaimed Miss Holmes;\nwhile Miss Manners and the others, who were getting a little tired of\npromiscuous conversation, echoed her request.\n\n\"By all means,\" he answered, \"though we have enough mice here without\ntheir bringing any more. Savage, go and tell your two friends that _Mr.\nHere-come-a-zany_ is waiting for them in the drawing-room, and that the\ncompany would like to see some of their tricks.\"\n\nSavage bowed and departed, like a hero to execution, for by his pallor I\ncould see that he was in a great fright. When he had gone we set to\nwork and cleared a space in the middle of the room, in front of which we\narranged chairs for the company to sit on.\n\n\"No doubt they are Indian jugglers,\" said Lord Ragnall, \"and will want\na place to grow their mango-tree, as I remember seeing them do in\nKashmir.\"\n\nAs he spoke the door opened and Mr. Savage appeared through it, walking\nmuch faster than was his wont. I noted also that he gripped the pockets\nof his swallow-tail coat firmly in his hand.\n\n\"Mr. Hare-root and Mr. Mare-root,\" he announced.\n\n\"Hare-root and Mare-root!\" repeated Lord Ragnall.\n\n\"Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, I expect,\" I said. \"I think I have read somewhere\nthat they were great magicians, whose names these conjurers have taken.\"\n(Since then I have discovered that they are mentioned in the Koran as\nmasters of the Black Art.)\n\nA moment later two men followed him through the doorway. The first was\na tall, Eastern-looking person with a grave countenance, a long, white\nbeard, a hooked nose, and flashing, hawk-like eyes. The second was\nshorter and rather stout, also much younger. He had a genial, smiling\nface, small, beady-black eyes, and was clean-shaven. They were very\nlight in colour; indeed I have seen Italians who are much darker; and\nthere was about their whole aspect a certain air of power.\n\nInstantly I remembered the story that Miss Holmes had told me at dinner\nand looked at her covertly, to see that she had turned quite pale and\nwas trembling a little. I do not think that anyone else noticed this,\nhowever, as all were staring at the strangers. Moreover she recovered\nherself in a moment, and, catching my eye, laid her finger on her lips\nin token of silence.\n\nThe men were clothed in thick, fur-lined cloaks, which they took off\nand, folding them neatly, laid upon the floor, standing revealed in\nrobes of a beautiful whiteness and in large plain turbans, also white.\n\n\"High-class Somali Arabs,\" thought I to myself, noting the while that as\nthey arranged the robes they were taking in every one of us with their\nquick eyes. One of them shut the door, leaving Savage on this side of\nit as though they meant him to be present. Then they walked towards\nus, each of them carrying an ornamental basket made apparently of split\nreeds, that contained doubtless their conjuring outfit and probably the\nsnake which Savage had found in his pocket. To my surprise they came\nstraight to me, and, having set down the baskets, lifted their hands\nabove their heads, as a person about to dive might do, and bowed till\nthe points of their fingers touched the floor. Next they spoke, not in\nArabic as I had expected that they would, but in Bantu, which of course\nI understood perfectly well.\n\n\"I, Har\u00fbt, head priest and doctor of the White Kendah People, greet you,\nO Macumazana,\" said the elder man.\n\n\"I, Mar\u00fbt, a priest and doctor of the People of the White Kendah, greet\nyou, O Watcher-by-night, whom we have travelled far to find,\" said the\nyounger man. Then together,\n\n\"We both greet you, O Lord, who seem small but are great, O Chief with\na troubled past and with a mighty future, O Beloved of Mameena who has\n'gone down' but still speaks from beneath, Mameena who was and is of our\ncompany.\"\n\nAt this point it was my turn to shiver and become pale, as any may guess\nwho may have chanced to read the history of Mameena, and the turn of\nMiss Holmes to watch _me_ with animated interest.\n\n\"O Slayer of evil men and beasts!\" they went on, in their rich-voiced,\nmonotonous chant, \"who, as our magic tells us, are destined to deliver\nour land from the terrible scourge, we greet you, we bow before you, we\nacknowledge you as our lord and brother, to whom we vow safety among us\nand in the desert, to whom we promise a great reward.\"\n\nAgain they bowed, once, twice, thrice; then stood silent before me with\nfolded arms.\n\n\"What on earth are they saying?\" asked Scroope. \"I could catch a few\nwords\"--he knew a little kitchen Zulu--\"but not much.\"\n\nI told him briefly while the others listened.\n\n\"What does Mameena mean?\" asked Miss Holmes, with a horrible acuteness.\n\"Is it a woman's name?\"\n\nHearing her, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt bowed as though doing reverence to that\nname. I am sorry to say that at this point I grew confused, though\nreally there was no reason why I should, and muttered something about a\nnative girl who had made trouble in her day.\n\nMiss Holmes and the other ladies looked at me with amused disbelief,\nand to my dismay the venerable Har\u00fbt turned to Miss Holmes, and with his\ninevitable bow, said in broken English:\n\n\"Mameena very beautiful woman, perhaps more beautiful than you, lady.\nMameena love the white lord Macumazana. She love him while she live, she\nlove him now she dead. She tell me so again just now. You ask white lord\ntell you pretty story of how he kiss her before she kill herself.\"\n\nNeedless to say all this very misleading information was received by the\naudience with an attention that I can but call rapt, and in a kind of\nholy silence which was broken only by a sudden burst of sniggering on\nthe part of Scroope. I favoured him with my fiercest frown. Then I fell\nupon that venerable villain Har\u00fbt, and belaboured him in Bantu, while\nthe audience listened as intently as though they understood.\n\nI asked him what he meant by coming here to asperse my character. I\nasked him who the deuce he was. I asked him how he came to know anything\nabout Mameena, and finally I told him that soon or late I would be even\nwith him, and paused exhausted.\n\nHe stood there looking for all the world like a statue of the patriarch\nJob as I imagine him, and when I had done, replied without moving a\nmuscle and in English:\n\n\"O Lord, Zikali, Zulu wizard, friend of mine! All great wizard friend\njust like all elephant and all snake. Zikali make me know Mameena,\nand she tell me story and send you much love, and say she wait for\nyou always.\" (More sniggers from Scroope, and still intenser interest\nevinced by Miss Holmes and others.) \"If you like, I show you Mameena\n'fore I go.\" (Murmurs from Miss Holmes and Miss Manners of \"Oh, _please_\ndo!\") \"But that very little business, for what one long-ago lady out of\nso many?\"\n\nThen suddenly he broke into Bantu, and added: \"A jest is a jest,\nMacumazana, though often there is meaning in a jest, and you shall see\nMameena if you will. I come here to ask you to do my people a service\nfor which you shall not lack reward. We, the White Kendah, the People of\nthe Child, are at war with the Black Kendah, our subjects who outnumber\nus. The Black Kendah have an evil spirit for a god, which spirit from\nthe beginning has dwelt in the largest elephant in all the world, a\nbeast that none can kill, but which kills many and bewitches more. While\nthat elephant, which is named Jana, lives we, the People of the Child,\ngo in terror, for day by day it destroys us. We have learned--how it\ndoes not matter--that you alone can kill that elephant. If you will come\nand kill it, we will show you the place where all the elephants go to\ndie, and you shall take their ivory, many wagon-loads, and grow rich.\nSoon you are going on a journey that has to do with a flower, and you\nwill visit peoples named the Mazitu and the Pongo who live on an island\nin a lake. Far beyond the Pongo and across the desert dwell my people,\nthe Kendah, in a secret land. When you wish to visit us, as you will do,\njourney to the north of that lake where the Pongo dwell, and stay there\non the edge of the desert shooting till we come. Now mock me if you\nwill, but do not forget, for these things shall befall in their season,\nthough that time be far. If we meet no more for a while, still do not\nforget. When you have need of gold or of the ivory that is gold, then\njourney to the north of the lake where the Pongo dwell, and call on the\nnames of Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt.\"\n\n\"And call on the names of Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt,\" repeated the younger man,\nwho hitherto appeared to take no interest in our talk.\n\nNext, before I could answer, before I could think the thing out indeed,\nfor all this breath from savage and mystical Africa blowing on me\nsuddenly here in an Essex drawing-room, seemed to overwhelm me, the\nineffable Har\u00fbt proceeded in his English conjurer's patter:\n\n\"Rich ladies and gentlemen want see trick by poor old wizard from centre\nAfrica. Well, we show them, but please 'member no magic, all quite\nsimple trick. Teach it you if you pay. Please not look too hard, no want\nyou learn how it done. What you like see? Tree grow out of nothing, eh?\nGood! Please lend me that plate--what you call him--china.\"\n\nThen the performance began. The tree grew admirably upon the china plate\nunder the cover of an antimacassar. A number of bits of stick danced\ntogether on the said plate, apparently without being touched. At a\nwhistle from Mar\u00fbt a second snake crawled out of the pocket of the\nhorrified Mr. Savage, who stood observing these proceedings at a\nrespectful distance, erected itself on its tail upon the plate and took\nfire till it was consumed to ashes, and so forth.\n\nThe show was very good, but to tell the truth I did not take much notice\nof it, for I had seen similar things before and was engaged in thoughts\nmuch excited by what Har\u00fbt had said to me. At length the pair paused\namidst the clapping of the audience, and Mar\u00fbt began to pack up the\nproperties as though all were done. Then Har\u00fbt observed casually:\n\n\"The Lord Macumazana think this poor business and he right. Very poor\nbusiness, any conjurer do better. All common trick\"--here his eye fell\nupon Mr. Savage who was wriggling uneasily in the background. \"What\nmatter with that gentleman? Brother Mar\u00fbt, go see.\"\n\nBrother Mar\u00fbt went and freed Mr. Savage from two more snakes which\nseemed to have taken possession of various parts of his garments. Also,\namidst shouts of laughter, from a large dead rat which he appeared to\ndraw from his well-oiled hair.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Har\u00fbt, as his confederate returned with these prizes, leaving\nSavage collapsed in a chair, \"snake love that gentleman much. He earn\ngreat money in Africa. Well, he keep rat in hair; hungry snake always\nwant rat. But as I say, this poor business. Now you like to see some\nbetter, eh? Mameena, eh?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied firmly, whereat everyone laughed.\n\n\"Elephant Jana we want you kill, eh? Just as he look this minute.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"very much indeed, only how will you show it me?\"\n\n\"That quite easy, Macumazana. You just smoke little Kendah 'bacco and\nsee many things, if you have gift, as I _think_ you got, and as I almost\n_sure_ that lady got,\" and he pointed to Miss Holmes. \"Sometimes they\nthings people want see, and sometimes they things people not want see.\"\n\n\"Dakka,\" I said contemptuously, alluding to the Indian hemp on which\nnatives make themselves drunk throughout great districts of Africa.\n\n\"Oh! no, not dakka, that common stuff; this 'bacco much better than\ndakka, only grow in Kendah-land. You think all nonsense? Well, you see.\nGive me match please.\"\n\nThen while we watched he placed some tobacco, at least it looked like\ntobacco, in a little wooden bowl that he also produced from his basket.\nNext he said something to his companion, Mar\u00fbt, who drew a flute from\nhis robe made out of a thick reed, and began to play on it a wild and\nmelancholy music, the sound of which seemed to affect my backbone as\nstanding on a great height often does. Presently too Har\u00fbt broke into a\nlow song whereof I could not understand a word, that rose and fell with\nthe music of the flute. Now he struck a match, which seemed incongruous\nin the midst of this semi-magical ceremony, and taking a pinch of the\ntobacco, lit it and dropped it among the rest. A pale, blue smoke arose\nfrom the bowl and with it a very sweet odour not unlike that of the\ntuberoses gardeners grow in hot-houses, but more searching.\n\n\"Now you breath smoke, Macumazana,\" he said, \"and tell us what you\nsee. Oh! no fear, that not hurt you. Just like cigarette. Look,\" and he\ninhaled some of the vapour and blew it out through his nostrils, after\nwhich his face seemed to change to me, though what the change was I\ncould not define.\n\nI hesitated till Scroope said:\n\n\"Come, Allan, don't shirk this Central African adventure. I'll try if\nyou like.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Har\u00fbt brusquely, \"_you_ no good.\"\n\nThen curiosity and perhaps the fear of being laughed at overcame me. I\ntook the bowl and held it under my nose, while Har\u00fbt threw over my head\nthe antimacassar which he had used in the mango trick, to keep in the\nfumes I suppose.\n\nAt first these fumes were unpleasant, but just as I was about to drop\nthe bowl they seemed to become agreeable and to penetrate to the inmost\nrecesses of my being. The general affect of them was not unlike that of\nthe laughing gas which dentists give, with this difference, that whereas\nthe gas produces insensibility, these fumes seemed to set the mind\non fire and to burn away all limitations of time and distance. Things\nshifted before me. It was as though I were no longer in that room but\ntravelling with inconceivable rapidity.\n\nSuddenly I appeared to stop before a curtain of mist. The mist rolled\nup in front of me and I saw a wild and wonderful scene. There lay a lake\nsurrounded by dense African forest. The sky above was still red with the\nlast lights of sunset and in it floated the full moon. On the eastern\nside of the lake was a great open space where nothing seemed to grow and\nall about this space were the skeletons of hundreds of dead elephants.\nThere they lay, some of them almost covered with grey mosses hanging to\ntheir bones, through which their yellow tusks projected as though they\nhad been dead for centuries; others with the rotting hide still on them.\nI knew that I was looking on a cemetery of elephants, the place where\nthese great beasts went to die, as I have since been told the extinct\nmoas did in New Zealand. All my life as a hunter had I heard rumours\nof these cemeteries, but never before did I see such a spot even in a\ndream.\n\nSee! There was one dying now, a huge gaunt bull that looked as though it\nwere several hundred years old. It stood there swaying to and fro. Then\nit lifted its trunk, I suppose to trumpet, though of course I could\nhear nothing, and slowly sank upon its knees and so remained in the last\nrelaxation of death.\n\nAlmost in the centre of this cemetery was a little mound of water-washed\nrock that had endured when the rest of the stony plain was denuded in\npast epochs. Suddenly upon that rock appeared the shape of the most\ngigantic elephant that ever I beheld in all my long experience. It had\none enormous tusk, but the other was deformed and broken off short. Its\nsides were scarred as though with fighting and its eyes shone red and\nwickedly. Held in its trunk was the body of a woman whose hair hung down\nupon one side and whose feet hung down upon the other. Clasped in her\narms was a child that seemed to be still living.\n\nThe rogue, as a brute of this sort is called, for evidently such it was,\ndropped the corpse to the ground and stood a while, flapping its ears.\nThen it felt for and picked up the child with its trunk, swung it to and\nfro and finally tossed it high into the air, hurling it far away. After\nthis it walked to the elephant that I had just seen die, and charged\nthe carcass, knocking it over. Then having lifted its trunk as though to\ntrumpet in triumph, it shambled off towards the forest and vanished.\n\nThe curtain of mist fell again and in it, dimly, I thought I saw--well,\nnever mind who or what I saw. Then I awoke.\n\n\"Well, did you see anything?\" asked a chorus of voices.\n\nI told them what I had seen, leaving out the last part.\n\n\"I say, old fellow,\" said Scroope, \"you must have been pretty clever to\nget all that in, for your eyes weren't shut for more than ten seconds.\"\n\n\"Then I wonder what you would say if I repeated everything,\" I answered,\nfor I still felt dreamy and not quite myself.\n\n\"You see elephant Jana?\" asked Har\u00fbt. \"He kill woman and child, eh?\nWell, he do that every night. Well, that why people of White Kendah\nwant you to kill _him_ and take all that ivory which they no dare touch\nbecause it in holy place and Black Kendah not let them. So he live\nstill. That what we wish know. Thank you much, Macumazana. You very good\nlook through-distance man. Just what I think. Kendah 'bacco smoke work\nvery well in you. Now, beautiful lady,\" he added turning to Miss Holmes,\n\"you like look too? Better look. Who knows what you see?\"\n\nMiss Holmes hesitated a moment, studying me with an inquiring eye. But I\nmade no sign, being in truth very curious to hear _her_ experience.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\n\"I would prefer, Luna, that you left this business alone,\" remarked Lord\nRagnall uneasily. \"I think it is time that you ladies went to bed.\"\n\n\"Here is a match,\" said Miss Holmes to Har\u00fbt who was engaged in putting\nmore tobacco into the bowl, the suspicion of a smile upon his grave\nand statuesque countenance. Har\u00fbt received the match with a low bow\nand fired the stuff as before. Then he handed the bowl, from which once\nagain the blue smoke curled upwards, to Miss Holmes, and gently and\ngracefully let the antimacassar fall over it and her head, which it\ndraped as a wedding veil might do. A few seconds later she threw off the\nantimacassar and cast the bowl, in which the fire was now out, on to the\nfloor. Then she stood up with wide eyes, looking wondrous lovely and,\nnotwithstanding her lack of height, majestic.\n\n\"I have been in another world,\" she said in a low voice as though she\nspoke to the air, \"I have travelled a great way. I found myself in a\nsmall place made of stone. It was dark in the place, the fire in that\nbowl lit it up. There was nothing there except a beautiful statue of a\nnaked baby which seemed to be carved in yellow ivory, and a chair made\nof ebony inlaid with ivory and seated with string. I stood in front of\nthe statue of the Ivory Child. It seemed to come to life and smile at\nme. Round its neck was a string of red stones. It took them from its\nneck and set them upon mine. Then it pointed to the chair, and I sat\ndown in the chair. That was all.\"\n\nHar\u00fbt followed her words with an interest that I could see was intense,\nalthough he attempted to hide it. Then he asked me to translate them,\nwhich I did.\n\nAs their full sense came home to him, although his face remained\nimpassive, I saw his dark eyes shine with the light of triumph. Moreover\nI heard him whisper to Mar\u00fbt words that seemed to mean,\n\n\"The Sacred Child accepts the Guardian. The Spirit of the White Kendah\nfinds a voice again.\"\n\nThen as though involuntarily, but with the utmost reverence, both of\nthem bowed deeply towards Miss Holmes.\n\nA babel of conversation broke out.\n\n\"What a ridiculous dream,\" I heard Lord Ragnall say in a vexed voice.\n\"An ivory child that seemed to come to life and to give you a necklace.\nWhoever heard such nonsense?\"\n\n\"Whoever heard such nonsense?\" repeated Miss Holmes after him, as though\nin polite acquiescence, but speaking as an automaton might speak.\n\n\"I say,\" interrupted Scroope, addressing Miss Manners, \"this is a\ndrawing-room entertainment and a half, isn't it, dear?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Miss Manners, doubtfully, \"it is rather too\nqueer for my taste. Tricks are all very well, but when it comes to magic\nand visions I get frightened.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose the show is over,\" said Lord Ragnall. \"Quatermain,\nwould you mind asking your conjurer friends what I owe them?\"\n\nHere Har\u00fbt, who had understood, paused from packing up his properties\nand answered,\n\n\"Nothing, O great Lord, nothing. It is we owe you much. Here we learn\nwhat we want know long time. I mean if elephant Jana still kill people\nof Kendah. Kendah 'bacco no speak to us. Only speak to new spirit. You\ngot great gift, lady, and you too, Macumazana. You not like smoke more\nKendah 'bacco and look into past, eh? Better look! Very full, past,\nlearn much there about all us; learn how things begin. Make you\nunderstand lot what seem odd to-day. No! Well, one day you look p'raps,\n'cause past pull hard and call loud, only no one hear what it say.\nGood night, O great Lord. Good night, O beautiful lady. Good night,\nO Macumazana, till we meet again when you come kill elephant Jana.\nBlessing of the Heaven-Child, who give rain, who protect all danger, who\ngive food, who give health, on you all.\"\n\nThen making many obeisances they walked backwards to the door where they\nput on their long cloaks.\n\nAt a sign from Lord Ragnall I accompanied them, an office which, fearing\nmore snakes, Mr. Savage was very glad to resign to me. Presently we\nstood outside the house amidst the moaning trees, and very cold it was\nthere.\n\n\"What does all this mean, O men of Africa?\" I asked.\n\n\"Answer the question yourself when you stand face to face with the great\nelephant Jana that has in it an evil spirit, O Macumazana,\" replied\nHar\u00fbt. \"Nay, listen. We are far from our home and we sought tidings\nthrough those who could give it to us, and we have won those tidings,\nthat is all. We are worshippers of the Heavenly Child that is eternal\nyouth and all good things, but of late the Child has lacked a tongue.\nYet to-night it spoke again. Seek to know no more, you who in due season\nwill know all things.\"\n\n\"Seek to know no more,\" echoed Mar\u00fbt, \"who already, perhaps, know too\nmuch, lest harm should come to you, Macumazana.\"\n\n\"Where are you going to sleep to-night?\" I asked.\n\n\"We do not sleep here,\" answered Har\u00fbt, \"we walk to the great city and\nthence find our way to Africa, where we shall meet you again. You know\nthat we are no liars, common readers of thought and makers of tricks,\nfor did not Dogeetah, the wandering white man, speak to you of the\npeople of whom he had heard who worshipped the Child of Heaven? Go in,\nMacumazana, ere you take harm in this horrible cold, and take with you\nthis as a marriage gift from the Child of Heaven whom she met to-night,\nto the beautiful lady stamped with the sign of the young moon who is\nabout to marry the great lord she loves.\"\n\nThen he thrust a little linen-wrapped parcel into my hand and with his\ncompanion vanished into the darkness.\n\nI returned to the drawing-room where the others were still discussing\nthe remarkable performance of the two native conjurers.\n\n\"They have gone,\" I said in answer to Lord Ragnall, \"to walk to London\nas they said. But they have sent a wedding-present to Miss Holmes,\" and\nI showed the parcel.\n\n\"Open it, Quatermain,\" he said again.\n\n\"No, George,\" interrupted Miss Holmes, laughing, for by now she seemed\nto have quite recovered herself, \"I like to open my own presents.\"\n\n\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and I handed her the parcel, which was neatly\nsewn up. Somebody produced scissors and the stitches were cut. Within\nthe linen was a necklace of beautiful red stones, oval-shaped like amber\nbeads and of the size of a robin's egg. They were roughly polished and\nthreaded on what I recognized at once to be hair from an elephant's\ntail. From certain indications I judged these stones, which might have\nbeen spinels or carbuncles, or even rubies, to be very ancient. Possibly\nthey had once hung round the neck of some lady in old Egypt. Indeed a\nbeautiful little statuette, also of red stone, which was suspended from\nthe centre of the necklace, suggested that this was so, for it may well\nhave been a likeness of one of the great gods of the Egyptians, the\ninfant Horus, the son of Isis.\n\n\"That is the necklace I saw which the Ivory Child gave me in my dream,\"\nsaid Miss Holmes quietly.\n\nThen with much deliberation she clasped it round her throat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE PLOT\n\nThe sequel to the events of this evening may be told very briefly and of\nit the reader can form his own judgment. I narrate it as it happened.\n\nThat night I did not sleep at all well. It may have been because of the\nexcitement of the great shoot in which I found myself in competition\nwith another man whom I disliked and who had defrauded me in the past,\nto say nothing of its physical strain in cold and heavy weather. Or it\nmay have been that my imagination was stirred by the arrival of that\nstrange pair, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, apparently in search of myself, seven\nthousand miles away from any place where they can have known aught of an\ninsignificant individual with a purely local repute. Or it may have been\nthat the pictures which they showed me when under the influence of\nthe fumes of their \"tobacco\"--or of their hypnotism--took an undue\npossession of my brain.\n\nOr lastly, the strange coincidence that the beautiful betrothed of my\nhost should have related to me a tale of her childhood of which she\ndeclared she had never spoken before, and that within an hour the two\nprincipal actors in that tale should have appeared before my eyes and\nhers (for I may state that from the beginning I had no doubt that\nthey were the same men), moved me and filled me with quite natural\nforeboding. Or all these things together may have tended to a\nconcomitant effect. At any rate the issue was that I could not sleep.\n\nFor hour after hour I lay thinking and in an irritated way listening for\nthe chimes of the Ragnall stable-clock which once had adorned the tower\nof the church and struck the quarters with a damnable reiteration. I\nconcluded that Messrs. Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt were a couple of common Arab\nrogues such as I had seen performing at the African ports. Then a\nquarter struck and I concluded that the elephants' cemetery which I\nbeheld in the smoke undoubtedly existed and that I meant to collar those\nthousands of pounds' worth of ivory before I died. Then after another\nquarter I concluded that there was no elephants' cemetery--although by\nthe way my old friend, Dogeetah or Brother John, had mentioned such\na thing to me--but that probably there was a tribe, as he had also\nmentioned, called the Kendah, who worshipped a baby, or rather its\neffigy.\n\nWell now, as had already occurred to me, the old Egyptians, of whom I\nwas always fond of reading when I got a chance, also worshipped a child,\nHorus the Saviour. And that child had a mother called Isis symbolized in\nthe crescent moon, the great Nature goddess, the mistress of mysteries\nto whose cult ten thousand priests were sworn--do not Herodotus and\nothers, especially Apuleius, tell us all about her? And by a queer\ncoincidence Miss Holmes had the mark of a crescent moon upon her breast.\nAnd when she was a child those two men, or others very like them, had\npointed out that mark to each other. And I had seen them staring hard\nat it that night. And in her vapour-invoked dream the \"Heavenly Child,\"\n_alias_ Horus, or the double of Horus, the _Ka_, I think the Egyptians\ncalled it, had awakened at the sight of her and kissed her and given her\nthe necklace of the goddess, and--all the rest. What did it mean?\n\nI went to sleep at last wondering what on earth it _could_ mean, till\npresently that confounded clock woke me up again and I must go through\nthe whole business once more.\n\nBy degrees, this was towards dawn, I became aware that all hope of rest\nhad vanished from me utterly; that I was most painfully awake, and what\nis more, oppressed by a curious fear to the effect that something was\ngoing to happen to Miss Holmes. So vivid did this fear become that at\nlength I arose, lit a candle and dressed myself. As it happened I knew\nwhere Miss Holmes slept. Her room, which I had seen her enter, was on\nthe same corridor as mine though at the other end of it near the head\nof a stair that ran I knew not whither. In my portmanteau that had been\nsent over from Miss Manners's house, amongst other things was a small\ndouble-barrelled pistol which from long habit I always carried with me\nloaded, except for the caps that were in a little leather case with some\nspare ammunition attached to the pistol belt. I took it out, capped it\nand thrust it into my pocket. Then I slipped from the room and stood\nbehind a tall clock in the corridor, watching Miss Holmes's door and\nreflecting what a fool I should look if anyone chanced to find me.\n\nHalf an hour or so later by the light of the setting moon which\nstruggled through a window, I saw the door open and Miss Holmes emerge\nin a kind of dressing-gown and still wearing the necklace which Har\u00fbt\nand Mar\u00fbt had given her. Of this I was sure for the light gleamed upon\nthe red stones.\n\nAlso it shone upon her face and showed me without doubt that she was\nwalking in her sleep.\n\nGliding as silently as a ghost she crossed the corridor and vanished.\nI followed and saw that she had descended an ancient, twisting stairway\nwhich I had noted in the castle wall. I went after her, my stockinged\nfeet making no noise, feeling my way carefully in the darkness of the\nstair, for I did not dare to strike a match. Beneath me I heard a noise\nas of someone fumbling with bolts. Then a door creaked on its hinges and\nthere was some light. When I reached the doorway I caught sight of the\nfigure of Miss Holmes flitting across a hollow garden that was laid out\nin the bottom of the castle moat which had been drained. The garden, as\nI had observed when we walked through it on the previous day on our way\nto the first covert that we shot, was bordered by a shrubbery through\nwhich ran paths that led to the back drive of the castle.\n\nAcross the garden glided the figure of Miss Holmes and after it went I,\ncrouching and taking cover behind every bush as though I were stalking\nbig game, which indeed I was. She entered the shrubbery, moving much\nmore swiftly now, for as she went she seemed to gather speed, like a\nstone which is rolled down a hill. It was as though whatever might be\nattracting her, for I felt sure that she was being drawn by something,\nacted more strongly upon her sleeping will as she drew nearer to it.\nFor a while I lost sight of her in the shadow of the tall trees. Then\nsuddenly I saw her again, standing quite still in an opening caused by\nthe blowing down in the gale of one of the avenue of elms that bordered\nthe back drive. But now she was no longer alone, for advancing towards\nher were two cloaked figures in whom I recognized Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt.\n\nThere she stood with outstretched arms, and towards her, stealthily as\nlions stalking a buck, came Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt. Moreover, between the naked\nboughs of the fallen elm I caught sight of what looked like the outline\nof a closed carriage standing upon the drive. Also I heard a horse\nstamp upon the frosty ground. Round the edge of the little glade I ran,\nkeeping in the dark shadow, as I went cocking the pistol that was in my\npocket. Then suddenly I darted out and stood between Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt and\nMiss Holmes.\n\nNot a word passed between us. I think that all three of us\nsubconsciously were anxious not to awake the sleeping woman, knowing\nthat if we did so there would be a terrible scene. Only after motioning\nto me to stand aside, of course in vain, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt drew from their\nrobes curved and cruel-looking knives and bowed, for even now their\npoliteness did not forsake them. I bowed back and when I straightened\nmyself those enterprising Easterns found that I was covering the heart\nof Har\u00fbt with my pistol. Then with that perception which is part of the\nmental outfit of the great, they saw that the game was up since I could\nhave shot them both before a knife touched me.\n\n\"You have won this time, O Watcher-by-Night,\" whispered Har\u00fbt softly,\n\"but another time you will lose. That beautiful lady belongs to us and\nthe People of the White Kendah, for she is marked with the holy mark of\nthe young moon. The call of the Child of Heaven is heard in her heart,\nand will bring her home to the Child as it has brought her to us\nto-night. Now lead her hence still sleeping, O brave and clever one, so\nwell named Watcher-by-Night.\"\n\nThen they were gone and presently I heard the sound of horses being\ndriven rapidly along the drive.\n\nFor a moment I hesitated as to whether I would or would not run in and\nshoot those horses. Two considerations stayed me. The first was that\nif I did so my pistol would be empty, or even if I shot one horse\nand retained a barrel loaded, with it I could only kill a single man,\nleaving myself defenceless against the knife of the other. The second\nconsideration was that now as before I did not wish to wake up Miss\nHolmes.\n\nI crept to her and not knowing what else to do, took hold of one of her\noutstretched hands. She turned and came with me at once as though she\nknew me, remaining all the while fast asleep. Thus we went back to the\nhouse, through the still open door, up the stairway straight to her own\nroom, on the threshold of which I loosed her hand. The room was dark and\nI could see nothing, but I listened until I heard a sound as of a person\nthrowing herself upon the bed and drawing up the blankets. Then knowing\nthat she was safe for a while, I shut the door, which opened outwards\nas doors of ancient make sometimes do, and set against it a little table\nthat stood in the passage.\n\nNext, after reflecting for a minute, the circumstances being awkward in\nmany ways, I went to my room and lit a candle. Obviously it was my\nduty to inform Lord Ragnall of what had happened and that as soon as\npossible. But I had no idea in what part of that huge building his\nsleeping place might be, nor, for patent reasons, was it desirable\nthat I should disturb the house and so create talk. In this dilemma I\nremembered that Lord Ragnall's confidential servant, Mr. Savage, when he\nconducted me to my room on the previous night, which he made a point of\ndoing perhaps because he wished to talk over the matter of the snakes\nthat had found their way into his pockets, had shown me a bell in it\nwhich he said rang outside his door. He called it an \"emergency bell.\" I\nremarked idly that it was improbable that I should have any occasion for\nits use.\n\n\"Who knows, sir?\" said Mr. Savage prophetically. \"There are folk who say\nthat this old castle is haunted, which after what I have seen to-night\nI can well believe. If you should chance to meet a ghost looking, let us\nsay, like those black villains, Harum and Scarum, or whatever they call\nthemselves--well, sir, two's better company than one.\"\n\nI considered that bell but was loath to ring it for the reasons I have\ngiven. Then I went outside the room and looked. As I had hoped might be\nthe case, there ran the wire on the face of the wall connected along its\nlength by other wires with the various rooms it passed.\n\nI set to work and followed that wire. It was not an easy job; indeed\nonce or twice it reminded me of that story of the old Greek hero who\nfound his way through a labyrinth by means of a silken thread. I forget\nwhether it were a bull or a lady he was looking for, but with care and\nperseverance he found one or the other, or it may have been both.\n\nDown staircases and various passages I went with my eye glued upon the\nwire, which occasionally got mixed up with other wires, till at length\nit led me through a swing door covered with red baize into what appeared\nto be a modern annexe to the castle. Here at last it terminated on\nthe spring of an alarming-looking and deep-throated bell that hung\nimmediately over a certain door.\n\nOn this door I knocked, hoping that it might be that of Mr. Savage and\npraying earnestly that it did not enclose the chaste resting-place of\nthe cook or any other female. Too late, I mean after I had knocked,\nit occurred to me that if so my position would be painful to a degree.\nHowever in this particular Fortune stood my friend, which does not\nalways happen to the virtuous. For presently I heard a voice which I\nrecognized as that of Mr. Savage, asking, not without a certain quaver\nin its tone,\n\n\"Who the devil is that?\"\n\n\"Me,\" I replied, being flustered.\n\n\"'Me' won't do,\" said the voice. \"'Me' might be Harum or it might be\nScarum, or it might be someone worse. Who's 'Me'?\"\n\n\"Allan Quatermain, you idiot,\" I whispered through the keyhole.\n\n\"Anna who? Well, never mind. Go away, Hanna. I'll talk to you in the\nmorning.\"\n\nThen I kicked the door, and at length, very cautiously, Mr. Savage\nopened it.\n\n\"Good heavens, sir,\" he said, \"what are you doing here, sir? Dressed\ntoo, at this hour, and with the handle of a pistol sticking out of your\npocket--or is it--the head of a snake?\" and he jumped back, a strange\nand stately figure in a long white nightshirt which apparently he wore\nover his underclothing.\n\nI entered the room and shut the door, whereon he politely handed me a\nchair, remarking,\n\n\"Is it ghosts, sir, or are you ill, or is it Harum and Scarum, of whom\nI have been thinking all night? Very cold too, sir, being afraid to pull\nup the bedclothes for fear lest there might be more reptiles in them.\"\nHe pointed to his dress-coat hanging on the back of another chair with\nboth the pockets turned inside out, adding tragically, \"To think, sir,\nthat this new coat has been a nest of snakes, which I have hated like\npoison from a child, and me almost a teetotaller!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said impatiently, \"it's Harum and Scarum as you call them. Take\nme to Lord Ragnall's bedroom at once.\"\n\n\"Ah! sir, burgling, I suppose, or mayhap worse,\" he exclaimed as he\nthrew on some miscellaneous garments and seized a life-preserver which\nhung upon a hook. \"Now I'm ready, only I hope they have left their\nsnakes behind. I never could bear the sight of a snake, and they seem to\nknow it--the brutes.\"\n\nIn due course we reached Lord Ragnall's room, which Mr. Savage entered,\nand in answer to a stifled inquiry exclaimed,\n\n\"Mr. Allan Quatermain to see you, my lord.\"\n\n\"What is it, Quatermain?\" he asked, sitting up in bed and yawning. \"Have\nyou had a nightmare?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, and Savage having left us and shut the door, I told\nhim everything as it is written down.\n\n\"Great heavens!\" he exclaimed when I had finished. \"If it had not been\nfor you and your intuition and courage----\"\n\n\"Never mind me,\" I interrupted. \"The question is--what should be done\nnow? Are you going to try to arrest these men, or will you--hold your\ntongue and merely cause them to be watched?\"\n\n\"Really I don't know. Even if we can catch them the whole story would\nsound so strange in a law-court, and all sorts of things might be\nsuggested.\"\n\n\"Yes, Lord Ragnall, it would sound so strange that I beg you will come\nat once to see the evidences of what I tell you, before rain or snow\nobliterates them, bringing another witness with you. Lady Longden,\nperhaps.\"\n\n\"Lady Longden! Why one might as well write to _The Times_. I have it!\nThere's Savage. He is faithful and can be silent.\"\n\nSo Savage was called in and, while Lord Ragnall dressed himself\nhurriedly, told the outline of his story under pain of instant dismissal\nif he breathed a word. Really to watch his face was as good as a play.\nSo astonished was he that all he could ejaculate was--\n\n\"The black-hearted villains! Well, they ain't friendly with snakes for\nnothing.\"\n\nThen having made sure that Miss Holmes was still in her room, we went\ndown the twisting stair and through the side doorway, locking the door\nafter us. By now the dawn was breaking and there was enough light to\nenable me in certain places where the snow that fell after the gale\nremained, to show Lord Ragnall and Savage the impress of the little\nbedroom slippers which Miss Holmes wore, and of my stockinged feet\nfollowing after.\n\nIn the plantation things were still easier, for every detail of the\nmovements of the four of us could be traced. Moreover, on the back drive\nwas the spoor of the horses and the marks of the wheels of the carriage\nthat had been brought for the purposes of the abduction. Also my great\ngood fortune, for this seemed to prove my theory, we found a parcel\nwrapped in native linen that appeared to have fallen out of the carriage\nwhen Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt made their hurried escape, as one of the wheels had\ngone over it. It contained an Eastern woman's dress and veil, intended,\nI suppose, to be used in disguising Miss Holmes, who thence-forward\nwould have appeared to be the wife or daughter of one of the abductors.\n\nSavage discovered this parcel, which he lifted only to drop it with a\nyell, for underneath it lay a torpid snake, doubtless one of those that\nhad been used in the performance.\n\nOf these discoveries and many other details, on our return to the house,\nLord Ragnall made full notes in a pocket-book, that when completed were\nsigned by all three of us.\n\nThere is not much more to tell, that is of this part of the story. The\nmatter was put into the hands of detectives who discovered that the\nEasterns had driven to London, where all traces of the carriage which\nconveyed them was lost. They, however, embarked upon a steamer called\nthe _Antelope_, together with two native women, who probably had been\nprovided to look after Miss Holmes, and sailed that very afternoon for\nEgypt. Thither, of course, it was useless to follow them in those days,\neven if it had been advisable to do so.\n\n\n\nTo return to Miss Holmes. She came down to breakfast looking very\ncharming but rather pale. Again I sat next to her and took some\nopportunity to ask her how she had rested that night.\n\nShe replied, Very well and yet very ill, since, although she never\nremembered sleeping more soundly in her life, she had experienced all\nsorts of queer dreams of which she could remember nothing at all, a\ncircumstance that annoyed her much, as she was sure that they were most\ninteresting. Then she added,\n\n\"Do you know, Mr. Quatermain, I found a lot of mud on my dressing-gown\nthis morning, and my bedroom slippers were also a mass of mud and wet\nthrough. How do you account for that? It is just as though I had been\nwalking about outside in my sleep, which is absurd, as I never did such\na thing in my life.\"\n\nNot feeling equal to the invention of any convincing explanation of\nthese phenomena, I upset the marmalade pot on to the table in such a way\nthat some of it fell upon her dress, and then covered my retreat with\nprofuse apologies. Understanding my dilemma, for he had heard something\nof this talk, Lord Ragnall came to my aid with a startling statement of\nwhich I forget the purport, and thus that crisis passed.\n\nShortly after breakfast Scroope announced to Miss Manners that her\ncarriage was waiting, and we departed. Before I went, as it chanced,\nI had a few private words with my host, with Miss Holmes, and with the\nmagnificent Mr. Savage. To the last, by the way, I offered a tip which\nhe refused, saying that after all we had gone through together he could\nnot allow \"money to come between us,\" by which he meant, to pass from my\npocket to his. Lord Ragnall asked me for both my English and my African\naddresses, which he noted in his pocket-book. Then he said,\n\n\"Really, Quatermain, I feel as though I had known you for years instead\nof three days; if you will allow me I will add that I should like to\nknow a great deal more of you.\" (He was destined to do so, poor fellow,\nthough neither of us knew it at the time.) \"If ever you come to England\nagain I hope you will make this house your headquarters.\"\n\n\"And if ever you come to South Africa, Lord Ragnall, I hope you will\nmake my four-roomed shanty on the Berea at Durban your headquarters. You\nwill get a hearty welcome there and something to eat, but little more.\"\n\n\"There is nothing I should like better, Quatermain. Circumstances have\nput me in a certain position in this country, still to tell you the\ntruth there is a great deal about the life of which I grow very tired.\nBut you see I am going to be married, and that I fear means an end\nof travelling, since naturally my wife will wish to take her place in\nsociety and the rest.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied, \"for it is not every young lady who has the luck\nto become an English peeress with all the etceteras, is it? Still I\nam not so sure but that Miss Holmes will take to travelling some day,\nalthough I _am_ sure that she would do better to stay at home.\"\n\nHe looked at me curiously, then asked,\n\n\"You don't think there is anything really serious in all this business,\ndo you?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think,\" I answered, \"except that you will do well\nto keep a good eye upon your wife. What those Easterns tried to do last\nnight and, I think, years ago, they may try again soon, or years hence,\nfor evidently they are patient and determined men with much to win.\nAlso it is a curious coincidence that she should have that mark upon her\nwhich appeals so strongly to Messrs. Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, and, to be brief,\nshe is in some ways different from most young women. As she said to\nme herself last night, Lord Ragnall, we are surrounded by mysteries;\nmysteries of blood, of inherited spirit, of this world generally in\nwhich it is probable that we all descended from quite a few common\nancestors. And beyond these are other mysteries of the measureless\nuniverse to which we belong, that may already be exercising their strong\nand secret influences upon us, as perhaps, did we know it, they have\ndone for millions of years in the Infinite whence we came and whither we\ngo.\"\n\nI suppose I spoke somewhat solemnly, for he said,\n\n\"Do you know you frighten me a little, though I don't quite understand\nwhat you mean.\" Then we parted.\n\nWith Miss Holmes my conversation was shorter. She remarked,\n\n\"It has been a great pleasure to me to meet you. I do not remember\nanybody with whom I have found myself in so much sympathy--except one\nof course. It is strange to think that when we meet again I shall be a\nmarried woman.\"\n\n\"I do not suppose we shall ever meet again, Miss Holmes. Your life is\nhere, mine is in the wildest places of a wild land far away.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, we shall,\" she answered. \"I learned this and lots of other\nthings when I held my head in that smoke last night.\"\n\nThen we also parted.\n\nLastly Mr. Savage arrived with my coat. \"Goodbye, Mr. Quatermain,\" he\nsaid. \"If I forget everything else I shall never forget you and those\nvillains, Harum and Scarum and their snakes. I hope it won't be my lot\never to clap eyes on them again, Mr. Quatermain, and yet somehow I don't\nfeel so sure of that.\"\n\n\"Nor do I,\" I replied, with a kind of inspiration, after which followed\nthe episode of the rejected tip.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE BONA FIDE GOLD MINE\n\nFully two years had gone by since I bade farewell to Lord Ragnall and\nMiss Holmes, and when the curtain draws up again behold me seated on the\nstoep of my little house at Durban, plunged in reflection and very sad\nindeed. Why I was sad I will explain presently.\n\nIn that interval of time I had heard once or twice about Lord Ragnall.\nThus I received from Scroope a letter telling of his lordship's marriage\nwith Miss Holmes, which, it appeared, had been a very fine affair\nindeed, quite one of the events of the London season. Two Royalties\nattended the ceremony, a duke was the best man, and the presents\naccording to all accounts were superb and of great value, including a\npriceless pearl necklace given by the bridegroom to the bride. A cutting\nfrom a society paper which Scroope enclosed dwelt at length upon the\nsplendid appearance of the bridegroom and the sweet loveliness of the\nbride. Also it described her dress in language which was Greek to me.\nOne sentence, however, interested me intensely.\n\nIt ran: \"The bride occasioned some comment by wearing only one ornament,\nalthough the Ragnall family diamonds, which have not seen the light for\nmany years, are known to be some of the finest in the country. It was\na necklace of what appeared to be large but rather roughly polished\nrubies, to which hung a small effigy of an Egyptian god also fashioned\nfrom a ruby. It must be added that although of an unusual nature on\nsuch an occasion this jewel suited her dark beauty well. Lady Ragnall's\nselection of it, however, from the many she possesses was the cause of\nmuch speculation. When asked by a friend why she had chosen it, she is\nreported to have said that it was to bring her good fortune.\"\n\nNow why did she wear the barbaric marriage gift of Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt in\npreference to all the other gems at her disposal, I wondered. The thing\nwas so strange as to be almost uncanny.\n\nThe second piece of information concerning this pair reached me through\nthe medium of an old _Times_ newspaper which I received over a year\nlater. It was to the effect that a son and heir had been born to Lord\nRagnall and that both mother and child were doing well.\n\nSo there's the end to a very curious little story, thought I to myself.\n\n\n\nWell, during those two years many things befell me. First of all, in\ncompany with my old friend Sir Stephen Somers, I made the expedition to\nPongoland in search of the wonderful orchid which he desired to add\nto his collection. I have already written of that journey and our\nextraordinary adventures, and need therefore allude to it no more here,\nexcept to say that during the course of it I was sorely tempted to\ntravel to the territory north of the lake in which the Pongos dwelt.\nMuch did I desire to see whether Messrs. Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt would in truth\nappear to conduct me to the land where the wonderful elephant which was\nsupposed to be animated by an evil spirit was waiting to be killed by\nmy rifle. However, I resisted the impulse, as indeed our circumstances\nobliged me to do. In the end we returned safely to Durban, and here I\ncame to the conclusion that never again would I risk my life on such mad\nexpeditions.\n\nOwing to circumstances which I have detailed elsewhere I was now in\npossession of a considerable sum of cash, and this I determined to lay\nout in such a fashion as to make me independent of hunting and trading\nin the wilder regions of Africa. As usual when money is forthcoming, an\nopportunity soon presented itself in the shape of a gold mine which had\nbeen discovered on the borders of Zululand, one of the first that was\never found in those districts. A Jew trader named Jacob brought it to\nmy notice and offered me a half share if I would put up the capital\nnecessary to work the mine. I made a journey of inspection and convinced\nmyself that it was indeed a wonderful proposition. I need not enter into\nthe particulars nor, to tell the truth, have I any desire to do so, for\nthe subject is still painful to me, further than to say that this Jew\nand some friends of his panned out visible gold before my eyes and\nthen revealed to me the magnificent quartz reef from which, as they\ndemonstrated, it had been washed in the bygone ages of the world. The\nnews of our discovery spread like wildfire, and as, whatever else I\nmight be, everyone knew that I was honest, in the end a small company\nwas formed with Allan Quatermain, Esq., as the chairman of the Bona Fide\nGold Mine, Limited.\n\nOh! that company! Often to this day I dream of it when I have\nindigestion.\n\nOur capital was small, \u00a310,000, of which the Jew, who was well named\nJacob, and his friends, took half (for nothing of course) as the\npurchase price of their rights. I thought the proportion large and said\nso, especially after I had ascertained that these rights had cost them\nexactly three dozen of square-face gin, a broken-down wagon, four cows\npast the bearing age and \u00a35 in cash. However, when it was pointed out\nto me that by their peculiar knowledge and genius they had located and\nprovided the value of a property of enormous potential worth, moreover\nthat this sum was to be paid to them in scrip which would only be\nrealizable when success was assured and not in money, after a night of\nanxious consideration I gave way.\n\nPersonally, before I consented to accept the chairmanship, which carried\nwith it a salary of \u00a3100 a year (which I never got), I bought and paid\nfor in cash, shares to the value of \u00a31,000 sterling. I remember that\nJacob and his friends seemed surprised at this act of mine, as they\nhad offered to give me five hundred of their shares for nothing \"in\nconsideration of the guarantee of my name.\" These I refused, saying that\nI would not ask others to invest in a venture in which I had no actual\nmoney stake; whereon they accepted my decision, not without enthusiasm.\nIn the end the balance of \u00a34,000 was subscribed and we got to work. Work\nis a good name for it so far as I was concerned, for never in all my\ndays have I gone through so harrowing a time.\n\nWe began by washing a certain patch of gravel and obtained results which\nseemed really astonishing. So remarkable were they that on publication\nthe shares rose to 10s. premium. Jacob and Co. took advantage of\nthis opportunity to sell quite half of their bonus holding to eager\napplicants, explaining to me that they did so not for personal profit,\nwhich they scorned, but \"to broaden the basis of the undertaking by\nadmitting fresh blood.\"\n\nIt was shortly after this boom that the gravel surrounding the rich\npatch became very gravelly indeed, and it was determined that we should\nbuy a small battery and begin to crush the quartz from which the gold\nwas supposed to flow in a Pactolian stream. We negotiated for that\nbattery through a Cape Town firm of engineers--but why follow the\nmelancholy business in all its details? The shares began to decrease in\nvalue. They shrank to their original price of \u00a31, then to 15s., then\nto 10s. Jacob, he was managing director, explained to me that it\nwas necessary to \"support the market,\" as he was already doing to an\nenormous extent, and that I as chairman ought to take a \"lead in this\ngood work\" in order to show my faith in the concern.\n\nI took a lead to the extent of another \u00a3500, which was all that I could\nafford. I admit that it was a shock to such trust in human nature as\nremained to me when I discovered subsequently that the 1,000 shares\nwhich I bought for my \u00a3500 had really been the property of Jacob,\nalthough they appeared to be sold to me in various other names.\n\nThe crisis came at last, for before that battery was delivered our\navailable funds were exhausted, and no one would subscribe another\nhalfpenny. Debentures, it is true, had been issued and taken up to the\nextent of about \u00a31,000 out of the \u00a35,000 offered, though who bought them\nremained at the time a mystery to me. Ultimately a meeting was called to\nconsider the question of liquidating the company, and at this meeting,\nafter three sleepless nights, I occupied the chair.\n\nWhen I entered the room, to my amazement I found that of the five\ndirectors only one was present besides myself, an honest old retired\nsea captain who had bought and paid for 300 shares. Jacob and the two\nfriends who represented his interests had, it appeared, taken ship that\nmorning for Cape Town, whither they were summoned to attend various\nrelatives who had been seized with illness.\n\nIt was a stormy meeting at first. I explained the position to the best\nof my ability, and when I had finished was assailed with a number of\nquestions which I could not answer to the satisfaction of myself or\nof anybody else. Then a gentleman, the owner of ten shares, who had\nevidently been drinking, suggested in plain language that I had cheated\nthe shareholders by issuing false reports.\n\nI jumped up in a fury and, although he was twice my size, asked him to\ncome and argue the question outside, whereon he promptly went away. This\nincident excited a laugh, and then the whole truth came out. A man with\ncoloured blood in him stood up and told a story which was subsequently\nproved to be true. Jacob had employed him to \"salt\" the mine by mixing\na heavy sprinkling of gold in the gravel we had first washed (which the\ncoloured man swore he did in innocence), and subsequently had defrauded\nhim of his wages. That was all. I sank back in my chair overcome. Then\nsome good fellow in the audience, who had lost money himself in the\naffair and whom I scarcely knew, got up and made a noble speech which\nwent far to restore my belief in human nature.\n\nHe said in effect that it was well known that I, Allan Quatermain,\nafter working like a horse in the interests of the shareholders, had\npractically ruined myself over this enterprise, and that the real thief\nwas Jacob, who had made tracks for the Cape, taking with him a large\ncash profit resulting from the sale of shares. Finally he concluded by\ncalling for \"three cheers for our honest friend and fellow sufferer, Mr.\nAllan Quatermain.\"\n\nStrange to say the audience gave them very heartily indeed. I thanked\nthem with tears in my eyes, saying that I was glad to leave the room as\npoor as I had ever been, but with a reputation which my conscience as\nwell as their kindness assured me was quite unblemished.\n\nThus the winding-up resolution was passed and that meeting came to\nan end. After shaking hands with my deliverer from a most unpleasant\nsituation, I walked homewards with the lightest heart in the world. My\nmoney was gone, it was true; also my over-confidence in others had led\nme to make a fool of myself by accepting as fact, on what I believed\nto be the evidence of my eyes, that which I had not sufficient expert\nknowledge to verify. But my honour was saved, and as I have again and\nagain seen in the course of life, money is nothing when compared with\nhonour, a remark which Shakespeare made long ago, though like many other\ntruths this is one of which a full appreciation can only be gained by\npersonal experience.\n\nNot very far from the place where our meeting had been held I passed a\nside street then in embryo, for it had only one or two houses situated\nin their gardens and a rather large and muddy sluit of water running\ndown one side at the edge of the footpath. Save for two people this\nstreet was empty, but that pair attracted my attention. They were\na white man, in whom I recognized the stout and half-intoxicated\nindividual who had accused me of cheating the company and then departed,\nand a withered old Hottentot who at that distance, nearly a hundred\nyards away, much reminded me of a certain Hans.\n\nThis Hans, I must explain, was originally a servant of my father, who\nwas a missionary in the Cape Colony, and had been my companion in\nmany adventures. Thus in my youth he and I alone escaped when Dingaan\nmurdered Retief and his party of Boers,[*] and he had been one of my\nparty in our quest for the wonderful orchid, the record of which I have\nwritten down in \"The Holy Flower.\"\n\n     [*] See the book called \"Marie.\"--Editor.\n\nHans had his weak points, among which must be counted his love of\nliquor, but he was a gallant and resourceful old fellow as indeed he had\namply proved upon that orchid-seeking expedition. Moreover he loved me\nwith a love passing the love of women. Now, having acquired some\nmoney in a way I need not stop to describe--for is it not written\nelsewhere?--he was settled as a kind of little chief on a farm not very\nfar from Durban, where he lived in great honour because of the fame of\nhis deeds.\n\nThe white man and Hans, if Hans it was, were engaged in violent\naltercation whereof snatches floated to me on the breeze, spoken in the\nDutch tongue.\n\n\"You dirty little Hottentot!\" shouted the white man, waving a stick,\n\"I'll cut the liver out of you. What do you mean by nosing about after\nme like a jackal?\" And he struck at Hans, who jumped aside.\n\n\"Son of a fat white sow,\" screamed Hans in answer (for the moment I\nheard his voice I knew that it was Hans), \"did you dare to call the Baas\na thief? Yes, a thief, O Rooter in the mud, O Feeder on filth and worms,\nO Hog of the gutter--the Baas, the clipping of whose nail is worth\nmore than you and all your family, he whose honour is as clear as the\nsunlight and whose heart is cleaner than the white sand of the sea.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did,\" roared the white man; \"for he got my money in the gold\nmine.\"\n\n\"Then, hog, why did you run away. Why did you not wait to tell him so\noutside that house?\"\n\n\"I'll teach you about running away, you little yellow dog,\" replied the\nother, catching Hans a cut across the ribs.\n\n\"Oh! you want to see me run, do you?\" said Hans, skipping back a few\nyards with wonderful agility. \"Then look!\"\n\nThus speaking he lowered his head and charged like a buffalo. Fair\nin the middle he caught that white man, causing him to double up, fly\nbackwards and land with a most resounding splash in the deepest part of\nthe muddy sluit. Here I may remark that, as his shins are the weakest,\na Hottentot's head is by far the hardest and most dangerous part of him.\nIndeed it seems to partake of the nature of a cannon ball, for,\nwithout more than temporary disturbance to its possessor, I have seen a\nhalf-loaded wagon go over one of them on a muddy road.\n\nHaving delivered this home thrust Hans bolted round a corner and\ndisappeared, while I waited trembling to see what happened to his\nadversary. To my relief nearly a minute later he crept out of the sluit\ncovered with mud and dripping with water and hobbled off slowly down the\nstreet, his head so near his feet that he looked as though he had been\nfolded in two, and his hands pressed upon what I believe is medically\nknown as the diaphragm. Then I also went upon my way roaring with\nlaughter. Often I have heard Hottentots called the lowest of mankind,\nbut, reflected I, they can at any rate be good friends to those who\ntreat them well--a fact of which I was to have further proof ere long.\n\nBy the time I reached my house and had filled my pipe and sat myself\ndown in the dilapidated cane chair on the veranda, that natural reaction\nset in which so often follows rejoicing at the escape from a great\ndanger. It was true that no one believed I had cheated them over that\nthrice-accursed gold mine, but how about other matters?\n\nI mused upon the Bible narrative of Jacob and Esau with a new and very\npoignant sympathy for Esau. I wondered what would become of my Jacob.\nJacob, I mean the original, prospered exceedingly as a result of\nhis deal in porridge, and, as thought I, probably would his artful\ndescendant who so appropriately bore his name. As a matter of fact I do\nnot know what became of him, but bearing his talents in mind I think\nit probable that, like Van Koop, under some other patronymic he has now\nbeen rewarded with a title by the British Government. At any rate I\nhad eaten the porridge in the shape of worthless but dearly purchased\nshares, after labouring hard at the chase of the golden calf, while\nbrother Jacob had got my inheritance, or rather my money. Probably he\nwas now counting it over in sovereigns upon the ship and sniggering as\nhe thought of the shareholders' meeting with me in the chair. Well,\nhe was a thief and would run his road to whatever end is appointed for\nthieves, so why should I bother my head more about him? As I had kept my\nhonour--let him take my savings.\n\nBut I had a son to support, and now what was I to do with scarcely three\nhundred pounds, a good stock of guns and this little Durban property\nleft to me in the world? Commerce in all its shapes I renounced once\nand for ever. It was too high--or too low--for me; so it would seem that\nthere remained to me only my old business of professional hunting. Once\nagain I must seek those adventures which I had forsworn when my evil\nstar shone so brightly over a gold mine. What was it to be? Elephants, I\nsupposed, since these are the only creatures worth killing from a money\npoint of view. But most of my old haunts had been more or less shot out.\nThe competition of younger professionals, of wandering backveld Boers\nand even of poaching natives who had obtained guns, was growing severe.\nIf I went at all I should have to travel farther afield.\n\nWhilst I meditated thus, turning over the comparative advantages\nor disadvantages of various possible hunting grounds in my mind, my\nattention was caught by a kind of cough that seemed to proceed from the\nfarther side of a large gardenia bush. It was not a human cough, but\nrather resembled that made by a certain small buck at night, probably\nto signal to its mate, which of course it could not be as there were no\nbuck within several miles. Yet I knew it came from a human throat, for\nhad I not heard it before in many an hour of difficulty and danger?\n\n\"Draw near, Hans,\" I said in Dutch, and instantly out of a clump of\naloes that grew in front of the pomegranate hedge, crept the withered\nshape of the old Hottentot, as a big yellow snake might do. Why he\nshould choose this method of advance instead of that offered by the\ngarden path I did not know, but it was quite in accordance with his\nsecretive nature, inherited from a hundred generations of ancestors who\nspent their lives avoiding the observation of murderous foes.\n\nHe squatted down in front of me, staring in a vacant way at the fierce\nball of the westering sun without blinking an eyelid, just as a vulture\ndoes.\n\n\"You look to me as though you had been fighting, Hans,\" I said. \"The\ncrown of your hat is knocked out; you are splashed with mud and there is\nthe mark of a stick upon your left side.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas. You are right as usual, Baas. I had a quarrel with a man\nabout sixpence that he owed me, and knocked him over with my head,\nforgetting to take my hat off first. Therefore it is spoiled, for which\nI am sorry, as it was quite a new hat, not two years old. The Baas gave\nit me. He bought it in a store at Utrecht when we were coming back from\nPongoland.\"\n\n\"Why do you lie to me?\" I asked \"You have been fighting a white man\nand for more than sixpence. You knocked him into a sluit and the mud\nsplashed up over you.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, that is so. Your spirit speaks truly to you of the matter.\nYet it wanders a little from the path, since I fought the white man for\nless than sixpence. I fought him for love, which is nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Then you are even a bigger fool than I took you for, Hans. What do you\nwant now?\"\n\n\"I want to borrow a pound, Baas. The white man will take me before\nthe magistrate, and I shall be fined a pound, or fourteen days in the\n_trunk_ (i.e. jail). It is true that the white man struck me first, but\nthe magistrate will not believe the word of a poor old Hottentot against\nhis, and I have no witness. He will say, 'Hans, you were drunk again.\nHans, you are a liar and deserve to be flogged, which you will be next\ntime. Pay a pound and ten shillings more, which is the price of good\nwhite justice, or go to the _trunk_ for fourteen days and make baskets\nthere for the great Queen to use.' Baas, I have the price of the justice\nwhich is ten shillings, but I want to borrow the pound for the fine.\"\n\n\"Hans, I think that just now you are better able to lend me a pound than\nI am to lend one to you. My bag is empty, Hans.\"\n\n\"Is it so, Baas? Well, it does not matter. If necessary I can make\nbaskets for the great white Queen to put her food in, for fourteen days,\nor mats on which she will wipe her feet. The _trunk_ is not such a bad\nplace, Baas. It gives time to think of the white man's justice and to\nthank the Great One in the Sky, because the little sins one did not do\nhave been found out and punished, while the big sins one did do,\nsuch as--well, never mind, Baas--have not been found out at all. Your\nreverend father, the Predikant, always taught me to have a thankful\nheart, Baas, and when I remember that I have only been in the _trunk_\nfor three months altogether who, if all were known, ought to have been\nthere for years, I remember his words, Baas.\"\n\n\"Why should you go to the _trunk_ at all, Hans, when you are rich and\ncan pay a fine, even if it were a hundred pounds?\"\n\n\"A month or two ago it is true I was rich, Baas, but now I am poor. I\nhave nothing left except ten shillings.\"\n\n\"Hans,\" I said severely, \"you have been gambling again; you have been\ndrinking again. You have sold your property and your cattle to pay your\ngambling debts and to buy square-face gin.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, and for no good it seems; though it is not true that I have\nbeen drinking. I sold the land and the cattle for \u00a3650, Baas, and with\nthe money I bought other things.\"\n\n\"What did you buy?\" I said.\n\nHe fumbled first in one pocket of his coat and then in the other, and\nultimately produced a crumpled and dirty-looking piece of paper that\nresembled a bank-note. I took and examined this document and next minute\nnearly fainted. It certified that Hans was the proprietor of I know not\nhow many debentures or shares, I forget which they were, in the Bona\nFide Gold Mine, Limited, that same company of which I was the unlucky\nchairman, in consideration for which he had paid a sum of over six\nhundred and fifty pounds.\n\n\"Hans,\" I said feebly, \"from whom did you buy this?\"\n\n\"From the baas with the hooked nose, Baas. He who was named Jacob, after\nthe great man in the Bible of whom your father, the Predikant, used to\ntell us, that one who was so slim and dressed himself up in a goatskin\nand gave his brother mealie porridge when he was hungry, after he had\ncome in from shooting buck, Baas, and got his farm and cattle, Baas, and\nthen went to Heaven up a ladder, Baas.\"\n\n\"And who told you to buy them, Hans?\"\n\n\"Sammy, Baas, he who was your cook when we went to Pongoland, he who hid\nin the mealie-pit when the slavers burned Beza-Town and came out half\ncooked like a fowl from the oven. The Baas Jacob stopped at Sammy's\nhotel, Baas, and told him that unless he bought bits of paper like this,\nof which he had plenty, you would be brought before the magistrate and\nsent to the _trunk_, Baas. So Sammy bought some, Baas, but not many for\nhe had only a little money, and the Baas Jacob paid him for all he ate\nand drank with other bits of paper. Then Sammy came to me and showed me\nwhat it was my duty to do, reminding me that your reverend father, the\nPredikant, had left you in my charge till one of us dies, whether you\nwere well or ill and whether you got better or got worse--just like a\nwhite wife, Baas. So I sold the farm and the cattle to a friend of the\nBaas Jacob's, at a very low price, Baas, and that is all the story.\"\n\nI heard and, to tell the honest truth, almost I wept, since the thought\nof the sacrifice which this poor old Hottentot had made for my sake on\nthe instigation of a rogue utterly overwhelmed me.\n\n\"Hans,\" I asked recovering myself, \"tell me what was that new name which\nthe Zulu captain Mavovo gave you before he died, I mean after you had\nfired Beza-Town and caught Hassan and his slavers in their own trap?\"\n\nHans, who had suddenly found something that interested him extremely\nout at sea, perhaps because he did not wish to witness my grief, turned\nround slowly and answered:\n\n\"Mavovo named me Light-in-Darkness, and by that name the Kafirs know me\nnow, Baas, though some of them call me Lord-of-the-Fire.\"\n\n\"Then Mavovo named you well, for indeed, Hans, you shine like a light in\nthe darkness of my heart. I whom you think wise am but a fool, Hans, who\nhas been tricked by a _vernuker_, a common cheat, and he has tricked you\nand Sammy as well. But as he has shown me that man can be very vile, you\nhave shown me that he can be very noble; and, setting the one against\nthe other, my spirit that was in the dust rises up once more like a\nwithered flower after rain. Light-in-Darkness, although if I had ten\nthousand pounds I could never pay you back--since what you have given\nme is more than all the gold in the world and all the land and all the\ncattle--yet with honour and with love I will try to pay you,\" and I held\nout my hand to him.\n\nHe took it and pressed it against his wrinkled old forehead, then\nanswered:\n\n\"Talk no more of that, Baas, for it makes me sad, who am so happy. How\noften have you forgiven me when I have done wrong? How often have you\nnot flogged me when I should have been flogged for being drunk and other\nthings--yes, even when once I stole some of your powder and sold it to\nbuy square-face gin, though it is true I knew it was bad powder, not fit\nfor you to use? Did I thank you then overmuch? Why therefore should you\nthank me who have done but a little thing, not really to help you but\nbecause, as you know, I love gambling, and was told that this bit of\npaper would soon be worth much more than I gave for it. If it had proved\nso, should I have given you that money? No, I should have kept it myself\nand bought a bigger farm and more cattle.\"\n\n\"Hans,\" I said sternly, \"if you lie so hard, you will certainly go to\nhell, as the Predikant, my father, often told you.\"\n\n\"Not if I lie for you, Baas, or if I do it doesn't matter, except that\nthen we should be separated by the big kloof written of in the Book,\nespecially as there I should meet the Baas Jacob, as I very much want to\ndo for a reason of my own.\"\n\nNot wishing to pursue this somewhat unchristian line of thought, I\ninquired of him why he felt happy.\n\n\"Oh! Baas,\" he answered with a twinkle in his little black eyes, \"can't\nyou guess why? Now you have very little money left and I have none at\nall. Therefore it is plain that we must go somewhere to earn money,\nand I am glad of that, Baas, for I am tired of sitting on that farm out\nthere and growing mealies and milking cows, especially as I am too old\nto marry, Baas, as you are tired of looking for gold where there isn't\nany and singing sad songs in that house of meeting yonder like you did\nthis afternoon. Oh! the Great Father in the skies knew what He was about\nwhen He sent the Baas Jacob our way. He beat us for our good, Baas, as\nHe does always if we could only understand.\"\n\nI reflected to myself that I had not often heard the doctrine of the\nChurch better or more concisely put, but I only said:\n\n\"That is true, Hans, and I thank you for the lesson, the second you have\ntaught me to-day. But where are we to go to, Hans? Remember, it must be\nelephants.\"\n\nHe suggested some places; indeed he seemed to have come provided with a\nlist of them, and I sat silent making no comment. At length he finished\nand squatted there before me, chewing a bit of tobacco I had given him,\nand looking up at me interrogatively with his head on one side, for all\nthe world like a dilapidated and inquisitive bird.\n\n\"Hans,\" I said, \"do you remember a story I told you when you came to see\nme a year or more ago, about a tribe called the Kendah in whose country\nthere is said to be a great cemetery of elephants which travel there\nto die from all the land about? A country that lies somewhere to the\nnorth-east of the lake island on which the Pongo used to dwell?\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas.\"\n\n\"And you said, I think, that you had never heard of such a people.\"\n\n\"No, Baas, I never said anything at all. I have heard a good deal about\nthem.\"\n\n\"Then why did you not tell me so before, you little idiot?\" I asked\nindignantly.\n\n\"What was the good, Baas? You were hunting gold then, not ivory. Why\nshould I make you unhappy, and waste my own breath by talking about\nbeautiful things which were far beyond the reach of either of us, far as\nthat sky?\"\n\n\"Don't ask fool's questions but tell me what you know, Hans. Tell me at\nonce.\"\n\n\"This, Baas: When we were up at Beza-Town after we came back from\nkilling the gorilla-god, and the Baas Stephen your friend lay sick, and\nthere was nothing else to do, I talked with everyone I could find worth\ntalking to, and they were not many, Baas. But there was one very old\nwoman who was not of the Mazitu race and whose husband and children\nwere all dead, but whom the people in the town looked up to and feared\nbecause she was wise and made medicines out of herbs, and told fortunes.\nI used to go to see her. She was quite blind, Baas, and fond of talking\nwith me--which shows how wise she was. I told her all about the Pongo\ngorilla-god, of which already she knew something. When I had done she\nsaid that he was as nothing compared with a certain god that she\nhad seen in her youth, seven tens of years ago, when she became\nmarriageable. I asked her for that story, and she spoke it thus:\n\n\"Far away to the north and east live a people called the Kendah, who are\nruled over by a sultan. They are a very great people and inhabit a most\nfertile country. But all round their country the land is desolate and\nmanless, peopled only by game, for the reason that they will suffer none\nto dwell there. That is why nobody knows anything about them: he that\ncomes across the wilderness into that land is killed and never returns\nto tell of it.\n\n\"She told me also that she was born of this people, but fled because\ntheir sultan wished to place her in his house of women, which she did\nnot desire. For a long while she wandered southwards, living on roots\nand berries, till she came to desert land and at last, worn out, lay\ndown to die. Then she was found by some of the Mazitu who were on an\nexpedition seeking ostrich feathers for war-plumes. They gave her food\nand, seeing that she was fair, brought her back to their country, where\none of them married her. But of her own land she uttered only lying\nwords to them because she feared that if she told the truth the gods who\nguard its secrets would be avenged on her, though now when she was near\nto death she dreaded them no more, since even the Kendah gods cannot\nswim through the waters of death. That is all she said about her journey\nbecause she had forgotten the rest.\"\n\n\"Bother her journey, Hans. What did she say about her god and the Kendah\npeople?\"\n\n\"This, Baas: that the Kendah have not one god but two, and not one ruler\nbut two. They have a good god who is a child-fetish\" (here I started)\n\"that speaks through the mouth of an oracle who is always a woman. If\nthat woman dies the god does not speak until they find another woman\nbearing certain marks which show that she holds the spirit of the god.\nBefore the woman dies she always tells the priests in what land they are\nto look for her who is to come after her; but sometimes they cannot find\nher and then trouble falls because 'the Child has lost its tongue,' and\nthe people become the prey of the other god that never dies.\"\n\n\"And what is that god, Hans?\"\n\n\"That god, Baas, is an elephant\" (here I started again), \"a very bad\nelephant to which human sacrifice is offered. I think, Baas, that it is\nthe devil wearing the shape of an elephant, at least that is what she\nsaid. Now the sultan is a worshipper of the god that dwells in the\nelephant Jana\" (here I positively whistled) \"and so are most of the\npeople, indeed all those among them who are black. For once far away\nin the beginning the Kendah were two peoples, but the lighter-coloured\npeople who worshipped the Child came down from the north and conquered\nthe black people, bringing the Child with them, or so I understood her,\nBaas, thousands and thousands of years ago when the world was young.\nSince then they have flowed on side by side like two streams in the same\nchannel, never mixing, for each keeps its own colour. Only, she said,\nthat stream which comes from the north grows weaker and that from the\nsouth more strong.\"\n\n\"Then why does not the strong swallow up the weak?\"\n\n\"Because the weak are still the pure and the wise, Baas, or so the old\nvrouw declared. Because they worship the good while the others worship\nthe devil, and as your father the Predikant used to say, Good is the\ncock which always wins the fight at the last, Baas. Yes, when he seems\nto be dead he gets up again and kicks the devil in the stomach and\nstands on him and crows, Baas. Also these northern folk are mighty\nmagicians. Through their Child-fetish they give rain and fat seasons and\nkeep away sickness, whereas Jana gives only evil gifts that have to do\nwith cruelty and war and so forth. Lastly, the priests who rule through\nthe Child have the secrets of wealth and ancient knowledge, whereas the\nsultan and his followers have only the might of the spear. This was the\nsong which the old woman sang to me, Baas.\"\n\n\"Why did you not tell me of these matters when we were at Beza-Town and\nI could have talked with her myself, Hans?\"\n\n\"For two reasons, Baas. The first was that I feared, if I told you,\nyou would wish to go on to find these people, whereas I was tired of\ntravelling and wanted to come to Natal to rest. The second was that\non the night when the old woman finished telling me her story, she was\ntaken sick and died, and therefore it would have been no use to bring\nyou to see her. So I saved it up in my head until it was wanted.\nMoreover, Baas, all the Mazitu declared that old woman to be the\ngreatest of liars.\"\n\n\"She was not altogether a liar, Hans. Hear what I have learned,\" and I\ntold him of the magic of Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt and of the picture that I had\nseemed to see of the elephant Jana and of the prayer that Har\u00fbt and\nMar\u00fbt had made to me, to all of which he listened quite stolidly. It is\nnot easy to astonish a Hottentot's brain, which often draws no accurate\ndividing-line between the possible and what the modern world holds to be\nimpossible.\n\n\"Yes, Baas,\" he said when I had finished, \"then it seems that the old\nwoman was not such a liar after all. Baas, when shall we start after\nthat hoard of dead ivory, and which way will you go? By Kilwa or through\nZululand? It should be settled soon because of the seasons.\"\n\nAfter this we talked together for a long while, for with pockets as\nempty as mine were then, the problem seemed difficult, if not insoluble.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nLORD RAGNALL'S STORY\n\nThat night Hans slept at my house, or rather outside of it in the\ngarden, or upon the stoep, saying that he feared arrest if he went to\nthe town, because of his quarrel with the white man. As it happened,\nhowever, the other party concerned never stirred further in the\nbusiness, probably because he was too drunk to remember who had knocked\nhim into the sluit or whether he had gravitated thither by accident.\n\nOn the following morning we renewed our discussion, debating in detail\nevery possible method of reaching the Kendah people by help of such\nmeans as we could command. Like that of the previous night it proved\nsomewhat abortive. Obviously such a long and hazardous expedition ought\nto be properly financed and--where was the money? At length I came\nto the conclusion that if we went at all it would be best, in the\ncircumstances, for Hans and myself to start alone with a Scotch cart\ndrawn by oxen and driven by a couple of Zulu hunters, which we could\nlade with ammunition and a few necessaries.\n\nThus lightly equipped we might work through Zululand and thence\nnorthward to Beza-Town, the capital of the Mazitu, where we were sure of\na welcome. After that we must take our chance. It was probable that\nwe should never reach the district where these Kendah were supposed to\ndwell, but at least I might be able to kill some elephants in the wild\ncountry beyond Zululand.\n\nWhile we were talking I heard the gun fired which announced the arrival\nof the English mail, and stepping to the end of the garden, saw the\nsteamer lying at anchor outside the bar. Then I went indoors to write a\nfew business letters which, since I had become immersed in the affairs\nof that unlucky gold mine, had grown to be almost a daily task with me.\nI had got through several with many groanings, for none were agreeable\nin their tenor, when Hans poked his head through the window in a silent\nkind of a way as a big snake might do, and said: \"Baas, I think there\nare two baases out on the road there who are looking for you. Very fine\nbaases whom I don't know.\"\n\n\"Shareholders in the Bona Fide Gold Mine,\" thought I to myself, then\nadded as I prepared to leave through the back door: \"If they come here\ntell them I am not at home. Tell them I left early this morning for the\nCongo River to look for the sources of the Nile.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas,\" said Hans, collapsing on to the stoep.\n\nI went out through the back door, sorrowing that I, Allan Quatermain,\nshould have reached a rung in the ladder of life whence I shrank from\nlooking any stranger in the face, for fear of what he might have to say\nto me. Then suddenly my pride asserted itself. After all what was there\nof which I should be ashamed? I would face these irate shareholders as I\nhad faced the others yesterday.\n\nI walked round the little house to the front garden which was planted\nwith orange trees, and up to a big moonflower bush, I believe _datura_\nis its right name, that grew near the pomegranate hedge which separated\nmy domain from the road. There a conversation was in progress, if so it\nmay be called.\n\n\"_Ikona_\" (that is: \"I don't know\"), \"_Inkoosi_\" (i.e. \"Chief\"), said\nsome Kafir in a stupid drawl.\n\nThereon a voice that instantly struck me as familiar, answered:\n\n\"We want to know where the great hunter lives.\"\n\n\"_Ikona_,\" said the Kafir.\n\n\"Can't you remember his native name?\" asked another voice which was also\nfamiliar to me, for I never forget voices though I am unable to place\nthem at once.\n\n\"The great hunter, Here-come-a-zany,\" said the first voice triumphantly,\nand instantly there flashed back upon my mind a vision of the splendid\ndrawing-room at Ragnall Castle and of an imposing majordomo introducing\ninto it two white-robed, Arab-looking men.\n\n\"Mr. Savage, by the Heavens!\" I muttered. \"What in the name of goodness\nis he doing here?\"\n\n\"There,\" said the second voice, \"your black friend has bolted, and no\nwonder, for who can be called by such a name? If you had done what I\ntold you, Savage, and hired a white guide, it would have saved us a lot\nof trouble. Why will you always think that you know better than anyone\nelse?\"\n\n\"Seemed an unnecessary expense, my lord, considering we are travelling\nincog., my lord.\"\n\n\"How long shall we travel 'incog.' if you persist in calling me my lord\nat the top of your voice, Savage? There is a house beyond those trees;\ngo in and ask where----\"\n\nBy this time I had reached the gate which I opened, remarking quietly,\n\n\"How do you do, Lord Ragnall? How do you do, Mr. Savage? I thought that\nI recognized your voices on the road and came to see if I was right.\nPlease walk in; that is, if it is I whom you wish to visit.\"\n\nAs I spoke I studied them both, and observed that while Savage\nlooked much the same, although slightly out of place in these strange\nsurroundings, the time that had passed since we met had changed Lord\nRagnall a good deal. He was still a magnificent-looking man, one of\nthose whom no one that had seen him would ever forget, but now his\nhandsome face was stamped with some new seal of suffering. I felt at\nonce that he had become acquainted with grief. The shadow in his dark\neyes and a certain worn expression about the mouth told me that this was\nso.\n\n\"Yes, Quatermain,\" he said as he took my hand, \"it is you whom I have\ntravelled seven thousand miles to visit, and I thank God that I have\nbeen so fortunate as to find you. I feared lest you might be dead, or\nperhaps far away in the centre of Africa where I should never be able to\ntrack you down.\"\n\n\"A week later perhaps you would not have found me, Lord Ragnall,\" I\nanswered, \"but as it happens misfortune has kept me here.\"\n\n\"And misfortune has brought me here, Quatermain.\"\n\nThen before I had time to answer Savage came up and we went into the\nhouse.\n\n\"You are just in time for lunch,\" I said, \"and as luck will have it\nthere is a good rock cod and a leg of orib\u00e9 buck for you to eat. Boy,\nset two more places.\"\n\n\"One more place, if you please, sir,\" said Savage. \"I should prefer to\ntake my food afterwards.\"\n\n\"You will have to get over that in Africa,\" I muttered. Still I let him\nhave his way, with the result that presently the strange sight was seen\nof the magnificent English majordomo standing behind my chair in\nthe little room and handing round the square-face as though it were\nchampagne. It was a spectacle that excited the greatest interest in my\nprimitive establishment and caused Hans with some native hangers-on\nto gather at the window. However, Lord Ragnall took it as a matter of\ncourse and I thought it better not to interfere.\n\nWhen we had finished we went on to the stoep to smoke, leaving Savage\nto eat his dinner, and I asked Lord Ragnall where his luggage was. He\nreplied that he had left it at the Customs. \"Then,\" I said, \"I will send\na native with Savage to arrange about getting it up here. If you do not\nmind my rough accommodation there is a room for you, and your man can\npitch a tent in the garden.\"\n\nAfter some demur he accepted with gratitude, and a little later Savage\nand the native were sent off with a note to a man who hired out a\nmule-cart.\n\n\"Now,\" I said when the gate had shut behind them, \"will you tell me why\nyou have come to Africa?\"\n\n\"Disaster,\" he replied. \"Disaster of the worst sort.\"\n\n\"Is your wife dead, Lord Ragnall?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I almost hope that she is. At any rate she is lost to\nme.\"\n\nAn idea leapt to my mind to the effect that she might have run away with\nsomebody else, a thing which often happens in the world. But fortunately\nI kept it to myself and only said,\n\n\"She was nearly lost once before, was she not?\"\n\n\"Yes, when you saved her. Oh! if only you had been with us, Quatermain,\nthis would never have happened. Listen: About eighteen months ago she\nhad a son, a very beautiful child. She recovered well from the business\nand we were as happy as two mortals could be, for we loved each other,\nQuatermain, and God has blessed us in every way; we were so happy that\nI remember her telling me that our great good fortune made her feel\nafraid. One day last September when I was out shooting, she drove in a\nlittle pony cart we had, with the nurse, and the child but no man, to\ncall on Mrs. Scroope who also had been recently confined. She often went\nout thus, for the pony was an old animal and quiet as a sheep.\n\n\"By some cursed trick of fate it chanced that when they were passing\nthrough the little town which you may remember near Ragnall, they met a\ntravelling menagerie that was going to some new encampment. At the head\nof the procession marched a large bull elephant, which I discovered\nafterwards was an ill-tempered brute that had already killed a man and\nshould never have been allowed upon the roads. The sight of the pony\ncart, or perhaps a red cloak which my wife was wearing, as she always\nliked bright colours, for some unknown reason seems to have infuriated\nthis beast, which trumpeted. The pony becoming frightened wheeled round\nand overturned the cart right in front of the animal, but apparently\nwithout hurting anybody. Then\"--here he paused a moment and with\nan effort continued--\"that devil in beast's shape cocked its ears,\nstretched out its long trunk, dragged the baby from the nurse's arms,\nwhirled it round and threw it high into the air, to fall crushed upon\nthe kerb. It sniffed at the body of the child, feeling it over with the\ntip of its trunk, as though to make sure that it was dead. Next, once\nmore it trumpeted triumphantly, and without attempting to harm my wife\nor anybody else, walked quietly past the broken cart and continued its\njourney, until outside the town it was made fast and shot.\"\n\n\"What an awful story!\" I said with a gasp.\n\n\"Yes, but there is worse to follow. My poor wife went off her head, with\nthe shock I suppose, for no physical injury could be found upon her. She\ndid not suffer in health or become violent, quite the reverse indeed\nfor her gentleness increased. She just went off her head. For hours at\na time she would sit silent and smiling, playing with the stones of that\nred necklace which those conjurers gave her, or rather counting them,\nas a nun might do with the beads of her rosary. At times, however, she\nwould talk, but always to the baby, as though it lay before her or she\nwere nursing it. Oh! Quatermain, it was pitiful, pitiful!\n\n\"I did everything I could. She was seen by three of the greatest\nbrain-doctors in England, but none of them was able to help. The only\nhope they gave was that the fit might pass off as suddenly as it had\ncome. They said too that a thorough change of scene would perhaps be\nbeneficial, and suggested Egypt; that was in October. I did not take\nmuch to the idea, I don't know why, and personally should not have\nacceded to it had it not been for a curious circumstance. The last\nconsultation took place in the big drawing-room at Ragnall. When it was\nover my wife remained with her mother at one end of the room while I and\nthe doctors talked together at the other, as I thought quite out of her\nearshot. Presently, however, she called to me, saying in a perfectly\nclear and natural voice:\n\n\"'Yes, George, I will go to Egypt. I should like to go to Egypt.' Then\nshe went on playing with the necklace and talking to the imaginary\nchild.\n\n\"Again on the following morning as I came into her room to kiss her, she\nexclaimed,\n\n\"'When do we start for Egypt? Let it be soon.'\n\n\"With these sayings the doctors were very pleased, declaring that they\nshowed signs of a returning interest in life and begging me not to\nthwart her wish.\n\n\"So I gave way and in the end we went to Egypt together with Lady\nLongden, who insisted upon accompanying us although she is a wretched\nsailor. At Cairo a large dahabeeyah that I had hired in advance, manned\nby an excellent crew and a guard of four soldiers, was awaiting us. In\nit we started up the Nile. For a month or more all went well; also to\nmy delight my wife seemed now and again to show signs of returning\nintelligence. Thus she took some interest in the sculptures on the walls\nof the temples, about which she had been very fond of reading when in\nhealth. I remember that only a few days before the--the catastrophe,\nshe pointed out one of them to me, it was of Isis and the infant Horus,\nsaying, 'Look, George, the holy Mother and the holy Child,' and then\nbowed to it reverently as she might have done to an altar. At length\nafter passing the First Cataract and the Island of Phil\u00e6 we came to\nthe temple of Abu Simbel, opposite to which our boat was moored. On the\nfollowing morning we explored the temple at daybreak and saw the sun\nstrike upon the four statues which sit at its farther end, spending\nthe rest of that day studying the colossal figures of Rameses that are\ncarved upon its face and watching some cavalcades of Arabs mounted upon\ncamels travelling along the banks of the Nile.\n\n\"My wife was unusually quiet that afternoon. For hour after hour she sat\nstill upon the deck, gazing first at the mouth of the rock-hewn temple\nand the mighty figures which guard it and then at the surrounding\ndesert. Only once did I hear her speak and then she said, 'Beautiful,\nbeautiful! Now I am at home.' We dined and as there was no moon, went\nto bed rather early after listening to the Sudanese singers as they sang\none of their weird chanties.\n\n\"My wife and her mother slept together in the state cabin of the\ndahabeeyah, which was at the stern of the boat. My cabin, a small one,\nwas on one side of this, and that of the trained nurse on the other. The\ncrew and the guard were forward of the saloon. A gangway was fixed from\nthe side to the shore and over it a sentry stood, or was supposed to\nstand. During the night a Khamsin wind began to blow, though lightly as\nwas to be expected at this season of the year. I did not hear it for, as\na matter of fact, I slept very soundly, as it appears did everyone else\nupon the dahabeeyah, including the sentry as I suspect.\n\n\"The first thing I remember was the appearance of Lady Longden just\nat daybreak at the doorway of my cabin and the frightened sound of her\nvoice asking if Luna, that is my wife, was with me. Then it transpired\nthat she had left her cabin clad in a fur cloak, evidently some\ntime before, as the bed in which she had been lying was quite cold.\nQuatermain, we searched everywhere; we searched for four days, but from\nthat hour to this no trace whatever of her has been found.\"\n\n\"Have you any theory?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, or at least all the experts whom we consulted have a theory. It is\nthat she slipped down the saloon in the dark, gained the deck and thence\nfell or threw herself into the Nile, which of course would have carried\nher body away. As you may have heard, the Nile is full of bodies. I\nmyself saw two of them during that journey. The Egyptian police\nand others were so convinced that this was what had happened that,\nnotwithstanding the reward of a thousand pounds which I offered for any\nvaluable information, they could scarcely be persuaded to continue the\nsearch.\"\n\n\"You said that a wind was blowing and I understand that the shores are\nsandy, so I suppose that all footprints would have been filled in?\"\n\nHe nodded and I went on. \"What is your own belief? Do you think she was\ndrowned?\"\n\nHe countered my query with another of:\n\n\"What do _you_ think?\"\n\n\"I? Oh! although I have no right to say so, I don't think at all. I\nam quite sure that she was _not_ drowned; that she is living at this\nmoment.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"As to that you had better inquire of our friends, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt,\" I\nanswered dryly.\n\n\"What have you to go on, Quatermain? There is no clue.\"\n\n\"On the contrary I hold that there are a good many clues. The whole\nEnglish part of the story in which we were concerned, and the threats\nthose mysterious persons uttered are the first and greatest of these\nclues. The second is the fact that your hiring of the dahabeeyah\nregardless of expense was known a long time before your arrival in\nEgypt, for I suppose you did so in your own name, which is not\nexactly that of Smith or Brown. The third is your wife's sleep-walking\npropensities, which would have made it quite easy for her to be drawn\nashore under some kind of mesmeric influence. The fourth is that you had\nseen Arabs mounted on camels upon the banks of the Nile. The fifth is\nthe heavy sleep you say held everybody on board that particular night,\nwhich suggests to me that your food may have been drugged. The sixth is\nthe apathy displayed by those employed in the search, which suggests to\nme that some person or persons in authority may have been bribed, as is\ncommon in the East, or perhaps frightened with threats of bewitchment.\nThe seventh is that a night was chosen when a wind blew which would\nobliterate all spoor whether of men or of swiftly travelling camels.\nThese are enough to begin with, though doubtless if I had time to think\nI could find others. You must remember too that although the journey\nwould be long, this country of the Kendah can doubtless be reached\nfrom the Sudan by those who know the road, as well as from southern or\neastern Africa.\"\n\n\"Then you think that my wife has been kidnapped by those villains, Har\u00fbt\nand Mar\u00fbt?\"\n\n\"Of course, though villains is a strong term to apply to them. They\nmight be quite honest men according to their peculiar lights, as indeed\nI expect they are. Remember that they serve a god or a fetish, or\nrather, as they believe, a god _in_ a fetish, who to them doubtless is\na very terrible master, especially when, as I understand, that god is\nthreatened by a rival god.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that, Quatermain?\"\n\nBy way of answer I repeated to him the story which Hans said he had\nheard from the old woman at Beza, the town of the Mazitu. Lord Ragnall\nlistened with the deepest interest, then said in an agitated voice:\n\n\"That is a very strange tale, but has it struck you, Quatermain, that\nif your suppositions are correct, one of the most terrible circumstances\nconnected with my case is that our child should have chanced to come to\nits dreadful death through the wickedness of an elephant?\"\n\n\"That curious coincidence has struck me most forcibly, Lord Ragnall.\nAt the same time I do not see how it can be set down as more than\na coincidence, since the elephant which slaughtered your child was\ncertainly not that called Jana. To suppose because there is a war\nbetween an elephant-god and a child-god somewhere in the heart of\nAfrica, that therefore another elephant can be so influenced that it\nkills a child in England, is to my mind out of all reason.\"\n\nThat is what I said to him, as I did not wish to introduce a new horror\ninto an affair that was already horrible enough. But, recollecting that\nthese priests, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, believed the mother of this murdered\ninfant to be none other than the oracle of their worship (though how\nthis chanced passed my comprehension), and therefore the great enemy\nof the evil elephant-god, I confess that at heart I felt afraid. If any\npowers of magic, black or white or both, were mixed up with the matter\nas my experiences in England seemed to suggest, who could say what might\nbe their exact limits? As, however, it has been demonstrated again and\nagain by the learned that no such thing as African magic exists, this\nline of thought appeared to be too foolish to follow. So passing it by I\nasked Lord Ragnall to continue.\n\n\"For over a month,\" he went on, \"I stopped in Egypt waiting till\nemissaries who had been sent to the chiefs of various tribes in the\nSudan and elsewhere, returned with the news that nothing whatsoever had\nbeen seen of a white woman travelling in the company of natives, nor\nhad they heard of any such woman being sold as a slave. Also through the\nKhedive, on whom I was able to bring influence to bear by help of\nthe British Government, I caused many harems in Egypt to be visited,\nentirely without result. After this, leaving the inquiry in the hands of\nthe British Consul and a firm of French lawyers, although in truth all\nhope had gone, I returned to England whither I had already sent Lady\nLongden, broken-hearted, for it occurred to me as possible that my wife\nmight have drifted or been taken thither. But here, too, there was no\ntrace of her or of anybody who could possibly answer to her description.\nSo at last I came to the conclusion that her bones must lie somewhere at\nthe bottom of the Nile, and gave way to despair.\"\n\n\"Always a foolish thing to do,\" I remarked.\n\n\"You will say so indeed when you hear the end, Quatermain. My\nbereavement and the sleeplessness which it caused prayed upon me so\nmuch, for now that the child was dead my wife was everything to me,\nthat, I will tell you the truth, my brain became affected and like Job I\ncursed God in my heart and determined to die. Indeed I should have died\nby my own hand, had it not been for Savage. I had procured the laudanum\nand loaded the pistol with which I proposed to shoot myself immediately\nafter it was swallowed so that there might be no mistake. One night only\na couple of months or so ago, Quatermain, I sat in my study at Ragnall,\nwith the doors locked as I thought, writing a few final letters before\nI did the deed. The last of them was just finished about twelve when\nhearing a noise, I looked up and saw Savage standing before me. I asked\nhim angrily how he came there (I suppose he must have had another key to\none of the other doors) and what he wanted. Ignoring the first part of\nthe question he replied:\n\n\"'My lord, I have been thinking over our trouble'--he was with us in\nEgypt--'I have been thinking so much that it has got a hold of my sleep.\nTo-night as you said you did not want me any more and I was tired, I\nwent to bed early and had a dream. I dreamed that we were once more in\nthe shrubbery, as happened some years ago, and that the little African\ngent who shot like a book, was showing us the traces of those two black\nmen, just as he did when they tried to steal her ladyship. Then in my\ndream I seemed to go back to bed and that beastly snake which we found\nlying under the parcel in the road seemed to follow me. When I had got\nto sleep again, all in the dream, there it was standing on its tail\nat the end of the bed, hissing till it woke me. Then it spoke in good\nEnglish and not in African as might have been expected.\n\n\"'\"Savage,\" it said, \"get up and dress yourself and go at once and tell\nhis lordship to travel to Natal and find Mr. Allan Quatermain\" (you may\nremember that was the African gentleman's name, my lord, which, with so\nmany coming and going in this great house, I had quite forgotten, until\nI had the dream). \"Find Mr. Allan Quatermain,\" that slimy reptile went\non, opening and shutting its mouth for all the world like a Christian\nmaking a speech, \"for he will have something to tell him as to that\nwhich has made a hole in his heart that is now filled with the seven\ndevils. Be quick, Savage, and don't stop to put on your shirt or your\ntie\"--I have not, my lord, as you may see. \"He is shut up in the study,\nbut you know how to get into it. If he will not listen to you let him\nlook round the study and he will see something which will tell him that\nthis is a true dream.\"\n\n\"'Then the snake vanished, seeming to wriggle down the left bottom\nbed-post, and I woke up in a cold sweat, my lord, and did what it had\ntold me.'\n\n\"Those were his very words, Quatermain, for I wrote them down afterwards\nwhile they were fresh in my memory, and you see here they are in my\npocket-book.\n\n\"Well, I answered him, rather brusquely I am afraid, for a crazed man\nwho is about to leave the world under such circumstances does not show\nat his best when disturbed almost in the very act, to the edge of which\nlong agony has brought him. I told him that all his dream of snakes\nseemed ridiculous, which obviously it was, and was about to send him\naway, when it occurred to me that the suggestion it conveyed that I\nshould put myself in communication with you was not ridiculous in view\nof the part you had already played in the story.\"\n\n\"Very far from ridiculous,\" I interpolated.\n\n\"To tell the truth,\" went on Lord Ragnall, \"I had already thought of\ndoing the same thing, but somehow beneath the pressure of my imminent\ngrief the idea was squeezed out of my mind, perhaps because you were so\nfar away and I did not know if I could find you even if I tried. Pausing\nfor a moment before I dismissed Savage, I rose from the desk at which I\nwas writing and began to walk up and down the room thinking what I would\ndo. I am not certain if you saw it when you were at Ragnall, but it is\na large room, fifty feet long or so though not very broad. It has two\nfireplaces, in both of which fires were burning on this night, and it\nwas lit by four standing lamps besides that upon my desk. Now between\nthese fireplaces, in a kind of niche in the wall, and a little in the\nshadow because none of the lamps was exactly opposite to it, hung a\nportrait of my wife which I had caused to be painted by a fashionable\nartist when first we became engaged.\"\n\n\"I remember it,\" I said. \"Or rather, I remember its existence. I did not\nsee it because a curtain hung over the picture, which Savage told me\nyou did not wish to be looked at by anybody but yourself. At the time\nI remarked to him, or rather to myself, that to veil the likeness of a\nliving woman in such a way seemed to me rather an ill-omened thing to\ndo, though why I should have thought it so I do not quite know.\"\n\n\"You are quite right, Quatermain. I had that foolish fancy, a lover's\nfreak, I suppose. When we married the curtain was removed although the\nbrass rod on which it hung was left by some oversight. On my return to\nEngland after my loss, however, I found that I could not bear to\nlook upon this lifeless likeness of one who had been taken from me so\ncruelly, and I caused it to be replaced. I did more. In order that it\nmight not be disturbed by some dusting housemaid, I myself made it fast\nwith three or four tin-tacks which I remember I drove through the velvet\nstuff into the panelling, using a fireiron as a hammer. At the time\nI thought it a good job although by accident I struck the nail of the\nthird finger of my left hand so hard that it came off. Look, it has not\nquite finished growing again,\" and he showed the finger on which the new\nnail was still in process of formation.\n\n\"Well, as I walked up and down the room some impulse caused me to look\ntowards the picture. To my astonishment I saw that it was no longer\nveiled, although to the best of my belief the curtain had been drawn\nover it as lately as that afternoon; indeed I could have sworn that this\nwas so. I called to Savage to bring the lamp that stood upon my table,\nand by its light made an examination. The curtain was drawn back, very\ntidily, being fastened in its place clear of the little alcove by means\nof a thin brass chain. Also along one edge of it, that which I had\nnailed to the panelling, the tin-tacks were still in their places; that\nis, three of them were, the fourth I found afterwards upon the floor.\n\n\"'She looks beautiful, doesn't she, my lord,' said Savage, 'and please\nGod so we shall still find her somewhere in the world.'\n\n\"I did not answer him, or even remark upon the withdrawal of the\ncurtain, as to which indeed I never made an inquiry. I suppose that\nit was done by some zealous servant while I was pretending to eat my\ndinner--there were one or two new ones in the house whose names and\nappearance I did not know. What impressed itself upon my mind was that\nthe face which I had never expected to see again on the earth, even in\na picture, was once more given to my eyes, it mattered not how. This, in\nmy excited state, for laudanum waiting to be swallowed and a pistol at\nfull cock for firing do not induce calmness in a man already almost mad,\nat any rate until they have fulfilled their offices, did in truth appear\nto me to be something of the nature of a sign such as that spoken of\nin Savage's idiotic dream, which I was to find if 'I looked round the\nstudy.'\n\n\"'Savage,' I said, 'I don't think much of your dreams about snakes that\ntalk to you, but I do think that it might be well to see Mr. Quatermain.\nTo-day is Sunday and I believe that the African mail sails on Friday. Go\nto town early to-morrow and book passages.'\n\n\"Also I told him to see various gunsmiths and bid them send down a\nselection of rifles and other weapons for me to choose from, as I\ndid not know whither we might wander in Africa, and to make further\nnecessary arrangements. All of these things he did, and--here we are.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered reflectively, \"here you are. What is more, here is\nyour luggage of which there seems to be enough for a regiment,\" and I\npointed to a Scotch cart piled up with baggage and followed by a\nlong line of Kafirs carrying sundry packages upon their heads that,\nmarshalled by Savage, had halted at my gate.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE START\n\nThat evening when the baggage had been disposed of and locked up in my\nlittle stable and arrangements were made for the delivery of some cases\ncontaining tinned foods, etc., which had proved too heavy for the Scotch\ncart, Lord Ragnall and I continued our conversation. First, however, we\nunpacked the guns and checked the ammunition, of which there was a large\nsupply, with more to follow.\n\nA beautiful battery they were of all sorts from elephant guns down, the\nmost costly and best finished that money could buy at the time. It made\nme shiver to think what the bill for them must have been, while their\nappearance when they were put together and stood in a long line against\nthe wall of my sitting-room, moved old Hans to a kind of ecstasy. For a\nlong while he contemplated them, patting the stocks one after the other\nand giving to each a name as though they were all alive, then exclaimed:\n\n\"With such weapons as these the Baas could kill the devil himself.\nStill, let the Baas bring Intombi with him\"--a favourite old rifle of\nmine and a mere toy in size, that had however done me good service in\nthe past, as those who have read what I have written in \"Marie\" and\n\"The Holy Flower\" may remember. \"For, Baas, after all, the wife of one's\nyouth often proves more to be trusted than the fine young ones a man\nbuys in his age. Also one knows all her faults, but who can say how\nmany there may be hidden up in new women however beautifully they are\ntattooed?\" and he pointed to the elaborate engraving upon the guns.\n\nI translated this speech to Lord Ragnall. It made him laugh, at which\nI was glad for up till then I had not seen him even smile. I should\nadd that in addition to these sporting weapons there were no fewer than\nfifty military rifles of the best make, they were large-bore Sniders\nthat had just then been put upon the market, and with them, packed in\ntin cases, a great quantity of ammunition. Although the regulations\nwere not so strict then as they are now, I met with a great deal of\ndifficulty in getting all this armament through the Customs. Lord\nRagnall however had letters from the Colonial Office to such authorities\nas ruled in Natal, and on our giving a joint undertaking that they were\nfor defensive purposes only in unexplored territory and not for sale,\nthey were allowed through. Fortunate did it prove for us in after days\nthat this matter was arranged.\n\nThat night before we went to bed I narrated to Lord Ragnall all the\nhistory of our search for the Holy Flower, which he seemed to find very\nentertaining. Also I told him of my adventures, to me far more terrible,\nas chairman of the Bona Fide Gold Mine and of their melancholy end.\n\n\"The lesson of which is,\" he remarked when I had finished, \"that because\na man is master of one trade, it does not follow that he is master of\nanother. You are, I should judge, one of the finest shots in the\nworld, you are also a great hunter and explorer. But when it comes to\ncompanies, Quatermain----! Still,\" he went on, \"I ought to be grateful\nto that Bona Fide Gold Mine, since I gather that had it not been for\nit and for your rascally friend, Mr. Jacob, I should not have found you\nhere.\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"it is probable that you would not, as by this time\nI might have been far in the interior where a man cannot be traced and\nletters do not reach him.\"\n\nThen he made a few pointed inquiries about the affairs of the mine,\nnoting my answers down in his pocket-book. I thought this odd but\nconcluded that he wished to verify my statements before entering into\na close companionship with me, since for aught he knew I might be the\nlargest liar in the world and a swindler to boot. So I said nothing,\neven when I heard through a roundabout channel on the morrow that he had\nsought an interview with the late secretary of the defunct company.\n\nA few days later, for I may as well finish with this matter at once, the\nastonishing object of these inquiries was made clear to me. One morning\nI found upon my table a whole pile of correspondence, at the sight\nof which I groaned, feeling sure that it must come from duns and be\nconnected with that infernal mine. Curiosity and a desire to face the\nworst, however, led me to open the first letter which as it happened\nproved to be from that very shareholder who had proposed a vote of\nconfidence in me at the winding-up meeting. By the time that it was\nfinished my eyes were swimming and really I felt quite faint. It ran:\n\n\"Honoured Sir,--I knew that I was putting my money on the right horse\nwhen I said the other day that you were one of the straightest that ever\nran. Well, I have got the cheque sent me by the lawyer on your account,\nbeing payment in full for every farthing I invested in the Bona Fide\nGold Mine, and I can only say that it is uncommonly useful, for that\nbusiness had pretty well cleaned me out. God bless you, Mr. Quatermain.\"\n\nI opened another letter, and another, and another. They were all to the\nsame effect. Bewildered I went on to the stoep, where I found Hans with\nan epistle in his hand which he requested me to be good enough to read.\nI read it. It was from a well-known firm of local lawyers and said:\n\n\"On behalf of Allan Quatermain, Esq., we beg to enclose a draft for\nthe sum of \u00a3650, being the value of the interest in the Bona Fide Gold\nCompany, Limited (in liquidation), which stands in your name on the\nbooks of the company. Please sign enclosed receipt and return same to\nus.\"\n\nYes, and there was the draft for \u00a3650 sterling!\n\nI explained the matter to Hans, or rather I translated the document,\nadding:\n\n\"You see you have got your money back again. But Hans, I never sent it;\nI don't know where it comes from.\"\n\n\"Is it money, Baas?\" asked Hans, surveying the draft with suspicion. \"It\nlooks very much like the other bit of paper for which I paid money.\"\n\nAgain I explained, reiterating that I knew nothing of the transaction.\n\n\"Well, Baas,\" he said, \"if you did not send it someone did--perhaps\nyour father the reverend Predikant, who sees that you are in trouble and\nwishes to wash your name white again. Meanwhile, Baas, please put that\nbit of paper in your pocket-book and keep it for me, for otherwise I\nmight be tempted to buy square-face with it.\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"you can now buy your land back, or some other land,\nand there will be no need for you to come with me to the country of the\nKendah.\"\n\nHans thought a moment and then very deliberately began to tear up the\ndraft; indeed I was only just in time to save it from destruction.\n\n\"If the Baas is going to turn me off because of this paper,\" he said, \"I\nwill make it small and eat it.\"\n\n\"You silly old fool,\" I said as I possessed myself of the cheque.\n\nThen the conversation was interrupted, for who should appear but Sammy,\nmy old cook, who began in his pompous language:\n\n\"The perfect rectitude of your conduct, Mr. Quatermain, moves me to the\ndeepest gratitude, though indeed I wish that I had put something into\nthe food of the knave Jacob who beguiled us all, that would have caused\nhim internal pangs of a severe if not of a dangerous order. My holding\nin the gold mine was not extensive, but the unpaid bill of the said\nJacob and his friends----\"\n\nHere I cut him short and fled, since I saw yet another shareholder\ngalloping to the gate, and behind him two more in a spider. First I took\nrefuge in my room, my idea being to put away that pile of letters. In so\ndoing I observed that there was one still unopened. Half mechanically\nI took it from the envelope and glanced at its contents. They were\nword for word identical with those of that addressed to \"Mr. Hans,\nHottentot,\" only my name was at the bottom of it instead of that of Hans\nand the cheque was for \u00a31,500, the amount I had paid for the shares I\nheld in the venture.\n\nFeeling as though my brain were in a melting-pot, I departed from the\nhouse into a patch of native bush that in those days still grew upon the\nslope of the hill behind. Here I sat myself down, as I had often\ndone before when there was a knotty point to be considered, aimlessly\nwatching a lovely emerald cuckoo flashing, a jewel of light, from tree\nto tree, while I turned all this fairy-godmother business over in my\nmind.\n\nOf course it soon became clear to me. Lord Ragnall in this case was\nthe little old lady with the wand, the touch of which could convert\nworthless share certificates into bank-notes of their face value. I\nremembered now that his wealth was said to be phenomenal and after\nall the cash capital of the company was quite small. But the question\nwas--could I accept his bounty?\n\nI returned to the house where the first person whom I met was Lord\nRagnall himself, just arrived from some interview about the fifty Snider\nrifles, which were still in bond. I told him solemnly that I wished to\nspeak to him, whereon he remarked in a cheerful voice,\n\n\"Advance, friend, and all's well!\"\n\nI don't know that I need set out the details of the interview. He\nwaited till I had got through my halting speech of mingled gratitude and\nexpostulation, then remarked:\n\n\"My friend, if you will allow me to call you so, it is quite true that I\nhave done this because I wished to do it. But it is equally true that to\nme it is a small thing--to be frank, scarcely a month's income; what I\nhave saved travelling on that ship to Natal would pay for it all. Also\nI have weighed my own interest in the matter, for I am anxious that you\nshould start upon this hazardous journey of ours up country with a mind\nabsolutely free from self-reproach or any money care, for thus you will\nbe able to do me better service. Therefore I beg that you will say no\nmore of the episode. I have only one thing to add, namely that I have\nmyself bought up at par value a few of the debentures. The price of them\nwill pay the lawyers and the liquidation fees; moreover they give me a\nstatus as a shareholder which will enable me to sue Mr. Jacob for his\nfraud, to which business I have already issued instructions. For please\nunderstand that I have not paid off any shares still standing in his\nname or in those of his friends.\"\n\nHere I may add that nothing ever came of this action, for the lawyers\nfound themselves unable to serve any writ upon that elusive person,\nMr. Jacob, who by then had probably adopted the name of some other\npatriarch.\n\n\"Please put it all down as a rich man's whim,\" he concluded.\n\n\"I can't call that a whim which has returned \u00a31,500 odd to my pocket\nthat I had lost upon a gamble, Lord Ragnall.\"\n\n\"Do you remember, Quatermain, how you won \u00a3250 upon a gamble at my place\nand what you did with it, which sum probably represented to you twenty\nor fifty times what it would to me? Also if that argument does not\nappeal to you, may I remark that I do not expect you to give me your\nservices as a professional hunter and guide for nothing.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I answered, fixing on this point and ignoring the rest, \"now\nwe come to business. If I may look upon this amount as salary, a very\nhandsome salary by the way, paid in advance, you taking the risks of my\ndying or becoming incapacitated before it is earned, I will say no more\nof the matter. If not I must refuse to accept what is an unearned gift.\"\n\n\"I confess, Quatermain, that I did not regard it in that light, though I\nmight have been willing to call it a retaining fee. However, do not let\nus wrangle about money any more. We can always settle our accounts when\nthe bill is added up, if ever we reach so far. Now let us come to more\nimportant details.\"\n\nSo we fell to discussing the scheme, route and details of our proposed\njourney. Expenditure being practically no object, there were several\nplans open to us. We might sail up the coast and go by Kilwa, as I had\ndone on the search for the Holy Flower, or we might retrace the line of\nour retreat from the Mazitu country which ran through Zululand. Again,\nwe might advance by whatever road we selected with a small army of\ndrilled and disciplined retainers, trusting to force to break a way\nthrough to the Kendah. Or we might go practically unaccompanied, relying\non our native wit and good fortune to attain our ends. Each of these\nalternatives had so much to recommend it and yet presented so many\ndifficulties, that after long hours of discussion, for this talk was\nrenewed again and again, I found it quite impossible to decide upon\nany one of them, especially as in the end Lord Ragnall always left the\nchoice with its heavy responsibilities to me.\n\nAt length in despair I opened the window and whistled twice on a certain\nlow note. A minute later Hans shuffled in, shaking the wet off the new\ncorduroy clothes which he had bought upon the strength of his return to\naffluence, for it was raining outside, and squatted himself down upon\nthe floor at a little distance. In the shadow of the table which cut off\nthe light from the hanging lamp he looked, I remember, exactly like\nan enormous and antique toad. I threw him a piece of tobacco which he\nthrust into his corn-cob pipe and lit with a match.\n\n\"The Baas called me,\" he said when it was drawing to his satisfaction,\n\"what does Baas want of Hans?\"\n\n\"Light in darkness!\" I replied, playing on his native name, and\nproceeded to set out the whole case to him.\n\nHe listened without a word, then asked for a small glass of gin, which\nI gave him doubtfully. Having swallowed this at a gulp as though it were\nwater, he delivered himself briefly to this effect:\n\n\"I think the Baas will do well not to go to Kilwa, since it means\nwaiting for a ship, or hiring one; also there may be more slave-traders\nthere by now who will bear him no love because of a lesson he taught\nthem a while ago. On the other hand the road through Zululand is open,\nthough it be long, and there the name of Macumazana is one well known.\nI think also that the Baas would do well not to take too many men, who\nmake marching slow, only a wagon or two and some drivers which might be\nsent back when they can go no farther. From Zululand messengers can be\ndispatched to the Mazitu, who love you, and Bausi or whoever is king\nthere to-day will order bearers to meet us on the road, until which time\nwe can hire other bearers in Zululand. The old woman at Beza-Town told\nme, moreover, as you will remember, that the Kendah are a very great\npeople who live by themselves and will allow none to enter their land,\nwhich is bordered by deserts. Therefore no force that you could take\nwith you and feed upon a road without water would be strong enough to\nknock down their gates like an elephant, and it seems better that you\nshould try to creep through them like a wise snake, although they appear\nto be shut in your face. Perhaps also they will not be shut since did\nyou not say that two of their great doctors promised to meet you and\nguide you through them?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I interrupted, \"I dare say it will be easier to get in than to\nget out of Kendahland.\"\n\n\"Last of all, Baas, if you take many men armed with guns, the black part\nof the Kendah people of whom I told you will perhaps think you come to\nmake war, whatever the white Kendah may say, and kill us all, whereas if\nwe be but a few perchance they will let us pass in peace. I think that\nis all, Baas. Let the Baas and the Lord Igeza forgive me if my words are\nfoolish.\"\n\nHere I should explain that \"Igeza\" was the name which the natives\nhad given to Lord Ragnall because of his appearance. The word means a\nhandsome person in the Zulu tongue. Savage they called \"Bena,\" I don't\nknow why. \"Bena\" in Zulu means to push out the breast and it may be\nthat the name was a round-about allusion to the proud appearance of the\ndignified Savage, or possibly it had some other recondite signification.\nAt any rate Lord Ragnall, Hans and myself knew the splendid Savage\nthenceforward by the homely appellation of Beans. His master said it\nsuited him very well because he was so green.\n\n\"The advice seems wise, Hans. Go now. No, no more gin,\" I answered.\n\nAs a matter of fact careful consideration convinced us it was so wise\nthat we acted on it down to the last detail.\n\n\n\nSo it came about that one fine afternoon about a fortnight later, for\nhurry as we would our preparations took a little time, we trekked for\nZululand over the sandy roads that ran from the outskirts of Durban.\nOur baggage and stores were stowed in two half-tented wagons, very good\nwagons since everything we had with us was the best that money could\nbuy, the after-part of which served us as sleeping-places at night.\nHans sat on the _voor-kisse_ or driving-seat of one of the wagons; Lord\nRagnall, Savage and I were mounted upon \"salted\" horses, that is, horses\nwhich had recovered from and were therefore supposed to be proof against\nthe dreadful sickness, valuable and docile animals which were trained to\nshooting.\n\nAt our start a little contretemps occurred. To my amazement I saw\nSavage, who insisted upon continuing to wear his funereal upper\nservant's cut-away coat, engaged with grim determination in mounting his\nsteed from the wrong side. He got into the saddle somehow, but there\nwas worse to follow. The horse, astonished at such treatment, bolted\na little way, Savage sawing at its mouth. Lord Ragnall and I cantered\nafter it past the wagons, fearing disaster. All of a sudden it swerved\nviolently and Savage flew into the air, landing heavily in a sitting\nposture.\n\n\"Poor Beans!\" ejaculated Lord Ragnall as we sped forward. \"I expect\nthere is an end of his journeyings.\"\n\nTo our surprise, however, we saw him leap from the ground with the most\nmarvellous agility and begin to dance about slapping at his posterior\nparts and shouting,\n\n\"Take it off! Kill it!\"\n\nA few seconds later we discovered the reason. The horse had shied at\na sleeping puff adder which was curled up in the sand of that little\nfrequented road, and on this puff adder Savage had descended with\nso much force, for he weighed thirteen stone, that the creature was\nsquashed quite flat and never stirred again. This, however, he did not\nnotice in his agitation, being convinced indeed that it was hanging to\nhim behind like a bulldog.\n\n\"Snakes! my lord,\" he exclaimed, when at last after careful search we\ndemonstrated to him that the adder had died before it could come into\naction.\n\n\"I hate 'em, my lord, and they haunts\" (he said 'aunts) \"me. If ever\nI get out of this I'll go and live in Ireland, my lord, where they\nsay there ain't none. But it isn't likely that I shall,\" he added\nmournfully, \"for the omen is horrid.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" I answered, \"it is splendid, for you have killed the\nsnake and not the snake you. 'The dog it was that died,' Savage.\"\n\nAfter this the Kafirs gave Savage a second very long name which meant\n\"He-who-sits-down-on-snakes-and-makes-them-flat.\" Having remounted him\non his horse, which was standing patiently a few yards away, at\nlength we got off. I lingered a minute behind the others to give some\ndirections to my old Griqua gardener, Jack, who snivelled at parting\nwith me, and to take a last look at my little home. Alack! I feared it\nmight be the last indeed, knowing as I did that this was a dangerous\nenterprise upon which I found myself embarked, I who had vowed that I\nwould be done with danger.\n\nWith a lump in my throat I turned from the contemplation of that\npeaceful dwelling and happy garden in which each tree and plant was dear\nto me, and waving a good-bye to Jack, cantered on to where Ragnall was\nwaiting for me.\n\n\"I am afraid this is rather a sad hour for you, who are leaving your\nlittle boy and your home,\" he said gently, \"to face unknown perils.\"\n\n\"Not so sad as others I have passed,\" I answered, \"and perils are my\ndaily bread in every sense of the word. Moreover, whatever it is for me\nit is for you also.\"\n\n\"No, Quatermain. For me it is an hour of hope; a faint hope, I admit,\nbut the only one left, for the letters I got last night from Egypt and\nEngland report that no clue whatsoever has been found, and indeed that\nthe search for any has been abandoned. Yes, I follow the last star left\nin my sky and if it sets I hope that I may set also, at any rate to this\nworld. Therefore I am happier than I have been for months, thanks to\nyou,\" and he stretched out his hand, which I shook.\n\nIt was a token of friendship and mutual confidence which I am glad to\nsay nothing that happened afterwards ever disturbed for a moment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE MEETING IN THE DESERT\n\nNow I do not propose to describe all our journey to Kendahland, or at\nany rate the first part thereof. It was interesting enough in its way\nand we met with a few hunting adventures, also some others. But there is\nso much to tell of what happened to us after we reached the place that\nI have not the time, even if I had the inclination to set all these\nmatters down. Let it be sufficient, then, to say that although owing\nto political events the country happened to be rather disturbed at the\ntime, we trekked through Zululand without any great difficulty. For\nhere my name was a power in the land and all parties united to help me.\nThence, too, I managed to dispatch three messengers, half-bred border\nmen, lean fellows and swift of foot, forward to the king of the Mazitu,\nas Hans had suggested that I should do, advising him that his old\nfriends, Macumazana, Watcher-by-Night, and the yellow man who was named\nLight-in-Darkness and Lord-of-the-Fire, were about to visit him again.\n\nAs I knew we could not take the wagons beyond a certain point where\nthere was a river called the Luba, unfordable by anything on wheels, I\nrequested him, moreover, to send a hundred bearers with whatever escort\nmight be necessary, to meet us on the banks of that river at a spot\nwhich was known to both of us. These words the messengers promised to\ndeliver for a fee of five head of cattle apiece, to be paid on their\nreturn, or to their families if they died on the road, which cattle we\npurchased and left in charge of a chief, who was their kinsman. As it\nhappened two of the poor fellows did die, one of them of cold in a swamp\nthrough which they took a short cut, and the other at the teeth of a\nhungry lion. The third, however, won through and delivered the message.\n\nAfter resting for a fortnight in the northern parts of Zululand, to give\ntime to our wayworn oxen to get some flesh on their bones in the warm\nbushveld where grass was plentiful even in the dry season, we trekked\nforward by a route known to Hans and myself. Indeed it was the\nsame which we had followed on our journey from Mazituland after our\nexpedition in search for the Holy Flower.\n\nWe took with us a small army of Zulu bearers. This, although they were\ndifficult to feed in a country where no corn could be bought, proved\nfortunate in the end, since so many of our cattle died from tsetse bite\nthat we were obliged to abandon one of the wagons, which meant that\nthe goods it contained must be carried by men. At length we reached the\nbanks of the river, and camped there one night by three tall peaks\nof rock which the natives called \"The Three Doctors,\" where I had\ninstructed the messengers to tell the Mazitu to meet us. For four days\nwe remained here, since rains in the interior had made the river quite\nimpassable. Every morning I climbed the tallest of the \"Doctors\" and\nwith my glasses looked over its broad yellow flood, searching the wide,\nbush-clad land beyond in the hope of discovering the Mazitu advancing to\nmeet us. Not a man was to be seen, however, and on the fourth evening,\nas the river had now become fordable, we determined that we would cross\non the morrow, leaving the remaining wagon, which it was impossible to\ndrag over its rocky bottom, to be taken back to Natal by our drivers.\n\nHere a difficulty arose. No promise of reward would induce any of our\nZulu bearers even to wet their feet in the waters of this River Luba,\nwhich for some reason that I could not extract from them they declared\nto be _tagati_, that is, bewitched, to people of their blood. When I\npointed out that three Zulus had already undertaken to cross it, they\nanswered that those men were half-breeds, so that for them it was only\nhalf bewitched, but they thought that even so one or more of them would\npay the penalty of death for this rash crime.\n\nIt chanced that this happened, for, as I have said, two of the poor\nfellows did die, though not, I think, owing to the magical properties\nof the waters of the Luba. This is how African superstitions are kept\nalive. Sooner or later some saying of the sort fulfils itself and then\nthe instance is remembered and handed down for generations, while\nother instances in which nothing out of the common has occurred are not\nheeded, or are forgotten.\n\nThis decision on the part of those stupid Zulus put us in an awkward\nfix, since it was impossible for us to carry over all our baggage and\nammunition without help. Therefore glad was I when before dawn on the\nfifth morning the nocturnal Hans crept into the wagon, in the after\npart of which Ragnall and I were sleeping, and informed us that he heard\nmen's voices on the farther side of the river, though how he could hear\nanything above that roar of water passed my comprehension.\n\nAt the first break of dawn again we climbed the tallest of the \"Doctor\"\nrocks and stared into the mist. At length it rolled away and there on\nthe farther side of the river I saw quite a hundred men who by their\ndress and spears I knew to be Mazitu. They saw me also and raising a\ncheer, dashed into the water, groups of them holding each other round\nthe middle to prevent their being swept away. Thereupon our silly Zulus\nseized their spears and formed up upon the bank. I slid down the steep\nside of the \"Great Doctor\" and ran forward, calling out that these were\nfriends who came.\n\n\"Friends or foes,\" answered their captain sullenly, \"it is a pity that\nwe should walk so far and not have a fight with those Mazitu dogs.\"\n\nWell, I drove them off to a distance, not knowing what might happen if\nthe two peoples met, and then went down to the bank. By now the Mazitu\nwere near, and to my delight at the head of them I perceived no other\nthan my old friend, their chief general, Babemba, a one-eyed man with\nwhom Hans and I had shared many adventures. Through the water he plunged\nwith great bounds and reaching the shore, greeted me literally with\nrapture.\n\n\"O Macumazana,\" he said, \"little did I hope that ever again I should\nlook upon your face. Welcome to you, a thousand welcomes, and to you\ntoo, Light-in-Darkness, Lord-of-the-Fire, Cunning-one whose wit saved us\nin the battle of the Gate. But where is Dogeetah, where is Wazeela, and\nwhere are the Mother and the Child of the Flower?\"\n\n\"Far away across the Black Water, Babemba,\" I answered. \"But here are\ntwo others in place of them,\" and I introduced him to Ragnall and Savage\nby their native names of Igeza and Bena.\n\nHe contemplated them for a moment, then said:\n\n\"This,\" pointing to Ragnall, \"is a great lord, but this,\" pointing to\nSavage, who was much the better dressed of the two, \"is a cock of the\nashpit arrayed in an eagle's feathers,\" a remark I did not translate,\nbut one which caused Hans to snigger vacuously.\n\nWhile we breakfasted on food prepared by the \"Cock of the Ashpit,\" who\namongst many other merits had that of being an excellent cook, I heard\nall the news. Bausi the king was dead but had been succeeded by one\nof his sons, also named Bausi, whom I remembered. Beza-Town had been\nrebuilt after the great fire that destroyed the slavers, and much more\nstrongly fortified than before. Of the slavers themselves nothing more\nhad been seen, or of the Pongo either, though the Mazitu declared that\ntheir ghosts, or those of their victims, still haunted the island in the\nlake. That was all, except the ill tidings as to two of our messengers\nwhich the third, who had returned with the Mazitu, reported to us.\n\nAfter breakfast I addressed and sent away our Zulus, each with a\nhandsome present from the trade goods, giving into their charge the\nremaining wagon and our servants, none of whom, somewhat to my relief,\nwished to accompany us farther. They sang their song of good-bye,\nsaluted and departed over the rise, still looking hungrily behind them\nat the Mazitu, and we were very pleased to see the last of them without\nbloodshed or trouble.\n\nWhen we had watched the white tilt of the wagon vanish, we set to work\nto get ourselves and our goods across the river. This we accomplished\nsafely, for the Mazitu worked for us like friends and not as do hired\nmen. On the farther bank, however, it took us two full days so to divide\nup the loads that the bearers could carry them without being overladen.\n\nAt length all was arranged and we started. Of the month's trek that\nfollowed there is nothing to tell, except that we completed it without\nnotable accidents and at last reached the new Beza-Town, which much\nresembled the old, where we were accorded a great public reception.\nBausi II himself headed the procession which met us outside the south\ngate on that very mound which we had occupied in the great fight, where\nthe bones of the gallant Mavovo and my other hunters lay buried. Almost\ndid it seem to me as though I could hear their deep voices joining in\nthe shouts of welcome.\n\nThat night, while the Mazitu feasted in our honour, we held an _indaba_\nin the big new guest house with Bausi II, a pleasant-faced young\nman, and old Babemba. The king asked us how long we meant to stay at\nBeza-Town, intimating his hope that the visit would be prolonged. I\nreplied, but a few days, as we were travelling far to the north to find\na people called the Kendah whom we wished to see, and hoped that he\nwould give us bearers to carry our goods as far as the confines of their\ncountry. At the name of Kendah a look of astonishment appeared upon\ntheir faces and Babemba said:\n\n\"Has madness seized you, Macumazana, that you would attempt this thing?\nOh surely you must be mad.\"\n\n\"You thought us mad, Babemba, when we crossed the lake to Rica Town, yet\nwe came back safely.\"\n\n\"True, Macumazana, but compared to the Kendah the Pongo were but as the\nsmallest star before the face of the sun.\"\n\n\"What do you know of them then?\" I asked. \"But stay--before you answer,\nI will speak what I know,\" and I repeated what I had learned from Hans,\nwho confirmed my words, and from Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, leaving out, however,\nany mention of their dealings with Lady Ragnall.\n\n\"It is all true,\" said Babemba when I had finished, \"for that old woman\nof whom Light-in-the-Darkness speaks, was one of the wives of my uncle\nand I knew her well. Hearken! These Kendah are a terrible nation and\ncountless in number and of all the people the fiercest. Their king is\ncalled Simba, which means Lion. He who rules is always called Simba,\nand has been so called for hundreds of years. He is of the Black Kendah\nwhose god is the elephant Jana, but as Light-in-Darkness has said, there\nare also the White Kendah who are Arab men, the priests and traders of\nthe people. The Kendah will allow no stranger within their doors; if one\ncomes they kill him by torment, or blind him and turn him out into the\ndesert which surrounds their country, there to die. These things the\nold woman who married my uncle told me, as she told them to\nLight-in-Darkness, also I have heard them from others, and what she\ndid not tell me, that the White Kendah are great breeders of the beasts\ncalled camels which they sell to the Arabs of the north. Go not near\nthem, for if you pass the desert the Black Kendah will kill you; and\nif you escape these, then their king, Simba, will kill you; and if you\nescape him, then their god Jana will kill you; and if you escape him,\nthen their white priests will kill you with their magic. Oh! long before\nyou look upon the faces of those priests you will be dead many times\nover.\"\n\n\"Then why did they ask me to visit them, Babemba?\"\n\n\"I know not, Macumazana, but perhaps because they wished to make an\noffering of you to the god Jana, whom no spear can harm; no, nor even\nyour bullets that pierce a tree.\"\n\n\"I am willing to make trial of that matter,\" I answered confidently,\n\"and any way we must go to see these things for ourselves.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" echoed Ragnall, \"we must certainly go,\" while even Savage, for I\nhad been translating to them all this while, nodded his head although he\nlooked as though he would much rather stay behind.\n\n\"Ask him if there are any snakes there, sir,\" he said, and foolishly\nenough I put the question to give me time to think of other things.\n\n\"Yes, O Bena. Yes, O Cock of the Ashpit,\" replied Babemba. \"My uncle's\nKendar wife told me that one of the guardians of the shrine of the White\nKendah is such a snake as was never seen elsewhere in the world.\"\n\n\"Then say to him, sir,\" said Savage, when I had translated almost\nautomatically, \"that shrine ain't a church where _I_ shall go to say my\nprayers.\"\n\nAlas! poor Savage little knew the future and its gifts.\n\nThen we came to the question of bearers. The end of it was that after\nsome hesitation Bausi II, because of his great affection for us,\npromised to provide us with these upon our solemnly undertaking to\ndismiss them at the borders of the desert, \"so that they might escape\nour doom,\" as he remarked cheerfully.\n\nFour days later we started, accompanied by about one hundred and twenty\npicked men under the command of old Babemba himself, who, he explained,\nwished to be the last to see us alive in the world. This was depressing,\nbut other circumstances connected with our start were calculated to\nweigh even more upon my spirit. Thus the night before we left Hans\narrived and asked me to \"write a paper\" for him. I inquired what he\nwanted me to put in the paper. He replied that as he was going to his\ndeath and had property, namely the \u00a3650 that had been left in a bank to\nhis credit, he desired to make a \"white man's will\" to be left in the\ncharge of Babemba. The only provision of the said will was that I was to\ninherit his property, if I lived. If I died, which, he added, \"of course\nyou must, Baas, like the rest of us,\" it was to be devoted to furnishing\npoor black people in hospital with something comforting to drink instead\nof the \"cow's water\" that was given to them there. Needless to say\nI turned him out at once, and that testamentary deposition remained\nunrecorded. Indeed it was unnecessary, since, as I reminded him, on my\nadvice he had already made a will before we left Durban, a circumstance\nthat he had quite forgotten.\n\nThe second event, which occurred about an hour before our departure,\nwas, that hearing a mighty wailing in the market-place where once Hans\nand I had been tied to stakes to be shot to death with arrows, I went\nout to see what was the matter. At the gateway I was greeted by the\nsight of about a hundred old women plastered all over with ashes,\nengaged in howling their loudest in a melancholy unison. Behind these\nstood the entire population of Beza-Town, who chanted a kind of chorus.\n\n\"What the devil are they doing?\" I asked of Hans.\n\n\"Singing our death-song, Baas,\" he replied stolidly, \"as they say that\nwhere we are going no one will take the trouble to do so, and it is\nnot right that great lords should die and the heavens above remain\nuninformed that they are coming.\"\n\n\"That's cheerful,\" I remarked, and wheeling round, asked Ragnall\nstraight out if he wished to persevere in this business, for to tell the\ntruth my nerve was shaken.\n\n\"I must,\" he answered simply, \"but there is no reason why you and Hans\nshould, or Savage either for the matter of that.\"\n\n\"Oh! I'm going where you go,\" I said, \"and where I go Hans will go.\nSavage must speak for himself.\"\n\nThis he did and to the same effect, being a very honest and faithful\nman. It was the more to his credit since, as he informed me in private,\nhe did not enjoy African adventure and often dreamed at nights of\nhis comfortable room at Ragnall whence he superintended the social\nactivities of that great establishment.\n\nSo we departed and marched for the matter of a month or more through\nevery kind of country. After we had passed the head of the great lake\nwherein lay the island, if it really was an island, where the Pongo used\nto dwell (one clear morning through my glasses I discerned the mountain\ntop that marked the former residence of the Mother of the Flower, and by\ncontrast it made me feel quite homesick), we struck up north, following\na route known to Babemba and our guides. After this we steered by the\nstars through a land with very few inhabitants, timid and nondescript\nfolk who dwelt in scattered villages and scarcely understood the art of\ncultivating the soil, even in its most primitive form.\n\nA hundred miles or so farther on these villages ceased and thenceforward\nwe only encountered some nomads, little bushmen who lived on game which\nthey shot with poisoned arrows. Once they attacked us and killed two\nof the Mazitu with those horrid arrows, against the venom of which no\nremedy that we had in our medicine chest proved of any avail. On this\noccasion Savage exhibited his courage if not his discretion, for rushing\nout of our thorn fence, after missing a bushmen with both barrels at a\ndistance of five yards--he was, I think, the worst shot I ever saw--he\nseized the little viper with his hands and dragged him back to camp. How\nSavage escaped with his life I do not know, for one poisoned arrow went\nthrough his hat and stuck in his hair and another just grazed his leg\nwithout drawing blood.\n\nThis valorous deed was of great service to us, since we were able\nthrough Hans, who knew something of the bushmen's language, to explain\nto our prisoner that if we were shot at again he would be hung. This\ninformation he contrived to shout, or rather to squeak and grunt, to\nhis amiable tribe, of which it appeared he was a kind of chief, with the\nresult that we were no more molested. Later, when we were clear of the\nbushmen country, we let him depart, which he did with great rapidity.\n\nBy degrees the land grew more and more barren and utterly devoid of\ninhabitants, till at last it merged into desert. At the edge of this\ndesert which rolled away without apparent limit we came, however, to\na kind of oasis where there was a strong and beautiful spring of water\nthat formed a stream which soon lost itself in the surrounding sand.\nAs we could go no farther, for even if we had wished to do so, and were\nable to find water there, the Mazitu refused to accompany us into the\ndesert, not knowing what else to do, we camped in the oasis and waited.\n\nAs it happened, the place was a kind of hunter's paradise, since every\nkind of game, large and small, came to the water to drink at night, and\nin the daytime browsed upon the saltish grass that at this season of the\nyear grew plentifully upon the edge of the wilderness.\n\nAmongst other creatures there were elephants in plenty that travelled\nhither out of the bushlands we had passed, or sometimes emerged from\nthe desert itself, suggesting that beyond this waste there lay fertile\ncountry. So numerous were these great beasts indeed that for my part I\nhoped earnestly that it would prove impossible for us to continue our\njourney, since I saw that in a few months I could collect an enormous\namount of ivory, enough to make me comparatively rich, if only I were\nable to get it away. As it was we only killed a few of them, ten in all\nto be accurate, that we might send back the tusks as presents to Bausi\nII. To slaughter the poor animals uselessly was cruel, especially as\nbeing unaccustomed to the sight of man, they were as easy to approach as\ncows. Even Savage slew one--by carefully aiming at another five paces to\nits left.\n\nFor the rest we lived on the fat of the land and, as meat was necessary\nto us, had as much sport as we could desire among the various antelope.\n\nFor fourteen days or so this went on, till at length we grew thoroughly\ntired of the business, as did the Mazitu, who were so gorged with flesh\nthat they began to desire vegetable food. Twice we rode as far into the\ndesert as we dared, for our horses remained to us and had grown fresh\nagain after the rest, but only to return without information. The place\nwas just a vast wilderness strewn with brown stones beautifully polished\nby the wind-driven sand of ages, and quite devoid of water.\n\nAfter our second trip, on which we suffered severely from thirst, we\nheld a consultation. Old Babemba said that he could keep his men no\nlonger, even for us, as they insisted upon returning home, and inquired\nwhat we meant to do and why we sat here \"like a stone.\" I answered that\nwe were waiting for some of the Kendah who had bid me to shoot game\nhereabouts until they arrived to be our guides. He remarked that the\nKendah to the best of his belief lived in a country that was still\nhundreds of miles away and that, as they did not know of our presence,\nany communication across the desert being impossible, our proceedings\nseemed to be foolish.\n\nI retorted that I was not quite so sure of this, since the Kendah seemed\nto have remarkable ways of acquiring information.\n\n\"Then, Macumazana, I fear that you will have to wait by yourselves until\nyou discover which of us is right,\" he said stolidly.\n\nTurning to Ragnall, I asked him what he would do, pointing out that\nto journey into the desert meant death, especially as we did not know\nwhither we were going, and that to return alone, without the stores\nwhich we must abandon, through the country of the bushmen to Mazituland,\nwould also be a risky proceeding. However, it was for him to decide.\n\nNow he grew much perturbed. Taking me apart again he dwelt earnestly\nupon his secret reasons for wishing to visit these Kendah, with which of\ncourse I was already acquainted, as indeed was Savage.\n\n\"I desire to stay here,\" he ended.\n\n\"Which means that we must all stay, Ragnall, since Savage will not\ndesert you. Nor will Hans desert me although he thinks us mad. He points\nout that I came to seek ivory and here about is ivory in plenty for the\ntrouble of taking.\"\n\n\"I might remain alone, Quatermain----\" he began, but I looked at him in\nsuch a way that he never finished the sentence.\n\nUltimately we came to a compromise. Babemba, on behalf of the Mazitu,\nagreed to wait three more days. If nothing happened during that period\nwe on our part agreed to return with them to a stretch of well-watered\nbush about fifty miles behind us, which we knew swarmed with elephants,\nthat by now were growing shy of approaching our oasis where there was so\nmuch noise and shooting. There we would kill as much ivory as we could\ncarry, an operation in which they were willing to assist for the fun of\nit, and then go back with them to Mazituland.\n\nThe three days went by and with every hour that passed my spirits rose,\nas did those of Savage and Hans, while Lord Ragnall became more and\nmore depressed. The third afternoon was devoted to a jubilant packing of\nloads, for in accordance with the terms of our bargain we were to start\nbackwards on our spoor at dawn upon the morrow. Most happily did I lay\nmyself down to sleep in my little bough shelter that night, feeling that\nat last I was rid of an uncommonly awkward adventure. If I thought that\nwe could do any good by staying on, it would have been another matter.\nBut as I was certain that there was no earthly chance of our finding\namong the Kendah--if ever we reached them--the lady who had tumbled in\nthe Nile in Egypt, well, I was glad that Providence had been so good as\nto make it impossible for us to commit suicide by thirst in a desert, or\notherwise. For, notwithstanding my former reasonings to the contrary,\nI was now convinced that this was what had happened to poor Ragnall's\nwife.\n\nThat, however, was just what Providence had not done. In the middle of\nthe night, to be precise, at exactly two in the morning, I was awakened\nby Hans, who slept at the back of my shanty, into which he had crept\nthrough a hole in the faggots, exclaiming in a frightened voice,\n\n\"Open your eyes and look, Baas. There are two _spooks_ waiting to see\nyou outside, Baas.\"\n\nVery cautiously I lifted myself a little and stared out into the\nmoonlight. There, seated about five paces from the open end of the hut\nwere the \"spooks\" sure enough, two white-robed figures squatting silent\nand immovable on the ground. At first I was frightened. Then I bethought\nme of thieves and felt for my Colt pistol under the rug that served me\nas a pillow. As I got hold of the handle, however, a deep voice said:\n\n\"Is it your custom, O Macumazana, Watcher-by-Night, to receive guests\nwith bullets?\"\n\nNow thought I to myself, who is there in the world who could see a man\ncatch hold of the handle of a pistol in the recesses of a dark place and\nunder a blanket at night, except the owner of that voice which I seemed\nto remember hearing in a certain drawing-room in England?\n\n\"Yes, Har\u00fbt,\" I answered with an unconcerned yawn, \"when the guests come\nin such a doubtful fashion and in the middle of the night. But as you\nare here at last, will you be so good as to tell us why you have kept us\nwaiting all this time? Is that your way of fulfilling an engagement?\"\n\n\"O Lord Macumazana,\" answered Har\u00fbt, for of course it was he, in quite a\nperturbed tone, \"I offer to you our humble apologies. The truth is\nthat when we heard of your arrival at Beza-Town we started, or tried to\nstart, from hundreds of miles away to keep our tryst with you here as\nwe promised we would do. But we are mortal, Macumazana, and accidents\nintervened. Thus, when we had ascertained the weight of your baggage,\ncamels had to be collected to carry it, which were grazing at a\ndistance. Also it was necessary to send forward to dig out a certain\nwell in the desert where they must drink. Hence the delay. Still, you\nwill admit that we have arrived in time, five, or at any rate four hours\nbefore the rising of that sun which was to light you on your homeward\nway.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have, O Prophets, or O Liars, whichever you may be,\" I\nexclaimed with pardonable exasperation, for really their knowledge of my\nprivate affairs, however obtained, was enough to anger a saint. \"So as\nyou are here at last, come in and have a drink, for whether you are men\nor devils, you must be cold out there in the damp.\"\n\nIn they came accordingly, and, not being Mohammedans, partook of a tot\nof square-face from a bottle which I kept locked in a box to put Hans\nbeyond the reach of temptation.\n\n\"To your health, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt,\" I said, drinking a little out of the\npannikin and giving the rest to Hans, who gulped the fiery liquor down\nwith a smack of his lips. For I will admit that I joined in this unholy\nmidnight potation to gain time for thought and to steady my nerve.\n\n\"To your health, O Lord Macumazana,\" the pair answered as they swallowed\ntheir tots, which I had made pretty stiff, and set down their pannikins\nin front of them with as much reverence as though these had been holy\nvessels.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, throwing a blanket over my shoulders, for the air\nwas chilly, \"now let us talk,\" and taking the lantern which Hans had\nthoughtfully lighted, I held it up and contemplated them.\n\nThere they were, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt without doubt, to all appearance\ntotally unchanged since some years before I had seen them at Ragnall\nin England. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked in a kind of fiery\nindignation inspired by my intense curiosity. \"How did you get out of\nEngland after you had tried to steal away the lady to whom you sent the\nnecklace? What did you do with that lady after you had beguiled her from\nthe boat at Abu-Simbel? In the name of your Holy Child, or of Shaitan\nof the Mohammedans, or of Set of the Egyptians, answer me, lest I should\nmake an end of both of you, which I can do here without any questions\nbeing asked,\" and I whipped out my pistol.\n\n\"Pardon us,\" said Har\u00fbt with a grave smile, \"but if you were to do as\nyou say, Lord Macumazana, many questions would be asked which _you_\nmight find it hard to answer. So be pleased to put that death-dealer\nback into its place, and to tell us before we reply to you, what you\nknow of Set of the Egyptians.\"\n\n\"As much or as little as you do,\" I replied.\n\nBoth bowed as though this information were of the most satisfactory\norder. Then Har\u00fbt went on: \"In reply to your requests, O Macumazana, we\nleft England by a steamboat and in due course after long journeyings we\nreached our own country. We do not understand your allusions to a place\ncalled Abu-Simbel on the Nile, whence, never having been there, we have\ntaken no lady. Indeed, we never meant to take that lady to whom we sent\na necklace in England. We only meant to ask certain questions of her, as\nshe had the gift of vision, when you appeared and interrupted us. What\nshould we want with white ladies, who have already far too many of our\nown?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I replied, \"but I do know that you are the biggest liars\nI ever met.\"\n\nAt these words, which some might have thought insulting, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt\nbowed again as though to acknowledge a great compliment. Then Har\u00fbt\nsaid:\n\n\"Let us leave the question of ladies and come to matters that have to do\nwith men. You are here as we told you that you would be at a time when\nyou did not believe us, and we here to meet _you_, as we told you that\nwe would be. How we knew that you were coming and how we came do not\nmatter at all. Believe what you will. Are you ready to start with us,\nO Lord Macumazana, that you may bring to its death the wicked elephant\nJana which ravages our land, and receive the great reward of ivory? If\nso, your camel waits.\"\n\n\"One camel cannot carry four men,\" I answered, avoiding the question.\n\n\"In courage and skill you are more than many men, O Macumazana, yet in\nbody you are but one and not four.\"\n\n\"If you think that I am going with you alone, you are much mistaken,\nHar\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt,\" I exclaimed. \"Here with me is my servant without whom\nI do not stir,\" and I pointed to Hans, whom they contemplated gravely.\n\"Also there is the Lord Ragnall, who in this land is named Igeza, and\nhis servant who here is named Bena, the man out of whom you drew snakes\nin the room in England. They also must accompany us.\"\n\nAt this news the impassive countenances of Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt showed, I\nthought, some signs of disturbance. They muttered together in an unknown\ntongue. Then Har\u00fbt said:\n\n\"Our secret land is open to you alone, O Macumazana, for one purpose\nonly--to kill the elephant Jana, for which deed we promise you a great\nreward. We do not wish to see the others there.\"\n\n\"Then you can kill your own elephant, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, for not one step\ndo I go with you. Why should I when there is as much ivory here as I\nwant, to be had for the shooting?\"\n\n\"How if we take you, O Macumazana?\"\n\n\"How if I kill you both, O Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt? Fools, here are many brave\nmen at my command, and if you or any with you want fighting it shall be\ngiven you in plenty. Hans, bid the Mazitu stand to their arms and summon\nIgeza and Bena.\"\n\n\"Stay, Lord,\" said Har\u00fbt, \"and put down that weapon,\" for once more I\nhad produced the pistol. \"We would not begin our fellowship by shedding\nblood, though we are safer from you than you think. Your companions\nshall accompany you to the land of the Kendah, but let them know that\nthey do so at their own risk. Learn that it is revealed to us that if\nthey go in there some of them will pass out again as spirits but not as\nmen.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you will murder them?\"\n\n\"No. We mean that yonder are some stronger than us or any men, who will\ntake their lives in sacrifice. Not yours, Macumazana, for that, it is\ndecreed, is safe, but those of two of the others, which two we do not\nknow.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, and how am I to be sure that any of us are\nsafe, or that you do not but trick us to your country, there to kill us\nwith treachery and steal our goods?\"\n\n\"Because we swear it by the oath that may not be broken; we swear it by\nthe Heavenly Child,\" both of them exclaimed solemnly, speaking with one\nvoice and bowing till their foreheads almost touched the ground.\n\nI shrugged my shoulders and laughed a little.\n\n\"You do not believe us,\" went on Har\u00fbt, \"who have not heard what happens\nto those who break this oath. Come now and see something. Within five\npaces of your hut is a tall ant-heap upon which doubtless you have been\naccustomed to stand and overlook the desert.\" (This was true, but how\ndid they guess it, I wondered.) \"Go climb that ant-heap once more.\"\n\nPerhaps it was rash, but my curiosity led me to accept this invitation.\nOut I went, followed by Hans with a loaded double-barrelled rifle, and\nscrambled up the ant-heap which, as it was twenty feet high and there\nwere no trees just here, commanded a very fine view of the desert\nbeyond.\n\n\"Look to the north,\" said Har\u00fbt from its foot.\n\nI looked, and there in the bright moonlight five or six hundred yards\naway, ranged rank by rank upon a slope of sand and along the crest of\nthe ridge beyond, I saw quite two hundred kneeling camels, and by each\ncamel a tall, white-robed figure who held in his hand a long lance to\nthe shaft of which, not far beneath the blade, was attached a little\nflag. For a while I stared to make sure that I was not the victim of an\nillusion or a mirage. Then when I had satisfied myself that these were\nindeed men and camels I descended from the ant-heap.\n\n\"You will admit, Macumazana,\" said Har\u00fbt politely, \"that if we had meant\nyou any ill, with such a force it would have been easy for us to take a\nsleeping camp at night. But these men come here to be your escort, not\nto kill or enslave you or yours. And, Macumazana, we have sworn to\nyou the oath that may not be broken. Now we go to our people. In the\nmorning, after you have eaten, we will return again unarmed and alone.\"\n\nThen like shadows they slipped away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nCHARGE!\n\nTen minutes later the truth was known and every man in the camp was up\nand armed. At first there were some signs of panic, but these with the\nhelp of Babemba we managed to control, setting the men to make the\nbest preparations for defence that circumstances would allow, and thus\noccupying their minds. For from the first we saw that, except for the\nthree of us who had horses, escape was impossible. That great camel\ncorps could catch us within a mile.\n\nLeaving old Babemba in charge of his soldiers, we three white men and\nHans held a council at which I repeated every word that had passed\nbetween Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt and myself, including their absolute denial of\ntheir having had anything to do with the disappearance of Lady Ragnall\non the Nile.\n\n\"Now,\" I asked, \"what is to be done? My fate is sealed, since for\npurposes of their own, of which probably we know nothing, these people\nintend to take me with them to their country, as indeed they are\njustified in doing, since I have been fool enough to keep a kind of\nassignation with them here. But they don't want anybody else. Therefore\nthere is nothing to prevent you Ragnall, and you Savage, and you Hans,\nfrom returning with the Mazitu.\"\n\n\"Oh! Baas,\" said Hans, who could understand English well enough\nalthough he seldom spoke it, \"why are you always bothering me with such\n_praatjes_?\"--(that is, chatter). \"Whatever you do I will do, and I\ndon't care what you do, except for your own sake, Baas. If I am going to\ndie, let me die; it doesn't at all matter how, since I must go soon and\nmake report to your reverend father, the Predikant. And now, Baas, I\nhave been awake all night, for I heard those camels coming a long while\nbefore the two spook men appeared, and as I have never heard camels\nbefore, could not make out what they were, for they don't walk like\ngiraffes. So I am going to sleep, Baas, there in the sun. When you have\nsettled things, you can wake me up and give me your orders,\" and he\nsuited the action to the word, for when I glanced at him again he was,\nor appeared to be, slumbering, just like a dog at its master's feet.\n\nI looked at Ragnall in interrogation.\n\n\"I am going on,\" he said briefly.\n\n\"Despite the denial of these men of any complicity in your wife's\nfate?\" I asked. \"If their words are true, what have you to gain by this\njourney, Ragnall?\"\n\n\"An interesting experience while it lasts; that is all. Like Hans\nthere, if what they say _is_ true, my future is a matter of complete\nindifference to me. But I do not believe a word of what they say.\nSomething tells me that they know a great deal which they do not choose\nto repeat--about my wife I mean. That is why they are so anxious that I\nshould not accompany you.\"\n\n\"You must judge for yourself,\" I answered doubtfully, \"and I hope to\nHeaven that you are judging right. Now, Savage, what have you decided?\nRemember before you reply that these uncanny fellows declare that if we\nfour go, two of us will never return. It seems impossible that they can\nread the future, still, without doubt, they _are_ most uncanny.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Savage, \"I will take my chance. Before I left England his\nlordship made a provision for my old mother and my widowed sister and\nher children, and I have none other dependent upon me. Moreover, I won't\nreturn alone with those Mazitu to become a barbarian, for how could I\nfind my way back to the coast without anyone to guide me? So I'll go on\nand leave the rest to God.\"\n\n\"Which is just what we have all got to do,\" I remarked. \"Well, as that\nis settled, let us send for Babemba and tell him.\"\n\nThis we did accordingly. The old fellow received the news with more\nresignation than I had anticipated. Fixing his one eye upon me, he said:\n\n\"Macumazana, these words are what I expected from you. Had any other man\nspoken them I should have declared that he was quite mad. But I remember\nthat I said this when you determined to visit the Pongo, and that you\ncame back from their country safe and sound, having done wonderful\nthings there, and that it was the Pongo who suffered, not you. So I\nbelieve it will be again, so far as you are concerned, Macumazana, for\nI think that some devil goes with you who looks after his own. For the\nothers I do not know. They must settle the matter with their own devils,\nor with those of the Kendah people. Now farewell, Macumazana, for it\ncomes to me that we shall meet no more. Well, that happens to all at\nlast, and it is good to have known you who are so great in your own way.\nOften I shall think of you as you will think of me, and hope that in a\ncountry beyond that of the Kendah I may hear from your lips all that\nhas befallen you on this and other journeys. Now I go to withdraw my\nmen before these white-robed Arabs come on their strange beasts to seize\nyou, lest they should take us also and there should be a fight in which\nwe, being the fewer, must die. The loads are all in order ready to be\nladen on their strange beasts. If they declare that the horses cannot\ncross the desert, leave them loose and we will catch them and take them\nhome with us, and since they are male and female, breed young ones from\nthem which shall be yours when you send for them, or Bausi the king's\nif you never send. Nay, I want no more presents who have the gun and the\npowder and the bullets you gave me, and the tusks of ivory for Bausi the\nking, and what is best of all, the memory of you and of your courage\nand wisdom. May these and the gods you worship befriend you. From\nyonder hill we will watch till we see that you have gone. Farewell,\"\nand waiting for no answer, he departed with the tears running from his\nsolitary eye.\n\nTen minutes later the Mazitu bearers had also saluted us and gone,\nleaving us seated in that deserted camp surrounded by our baggage, and\nso far as I was concerned, feeling most lonely. Another ten minutes went\nby which we occupied in packing our personal belongings. Then Hans, who\nwas now washing out the coffee kettle at a little distance, looked up\nand said:\n\n\"Here come the spook-men, Baas, the whole regiment of them.\" We ran and\nlooked. It was true. Marshalled in orderly squadrons, the camels with\ntheir riders were sweeping towards us, and a fine sight the beasts made\nwith their swaying necks and long, lurching gait. About fifty yards away\nthey halted just where the stream from our spring entered the desert,\nand there proceeded to water the camels, twenty of them at a time. Two\nmen, however, in whom I recognized Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, walked forward and\npresently were standing before us, bowing obsequiously.\n\n\"Good morning, Lord,\" said Har\u00fbt to Ragnall in his broken English. \"So\nyou come with Macumazana to call at our poor house, as we call at your\nfine one in England. You think we got the beautiful lady you marry, she\nwe give old necklace. That is not so. No white lady ever in Kendahland.\nWe hear story from Macumazana and believe that lady drowned in Nile, for\nyou 'member she walk much in her sleep. We very sorry for you, but gods\nknow their business. They leave when they will leave, and take when they\nwill take. You find her again some day more beautiful still and with her\nsoul come back.\"\n\nHere I looked at him sharply. I had told him nothing about Lady Ragnall\nhaving lost her wits. How then did he know of the matter? Still I\nthought it best to hold my peace. I think that Har\u00fbt saw he had made\nsome mistake, for leaving the subject of Lady Ragnall, he went on:\n\n\"You very welcome, O Lord, but it right tell you this most dangerous\njourney, since elephant Jana not like strangers, and,\" he continued\nslowly, \"think no elephant like your blood, and all elephants brothers.\nWhat one hate rest hate everywhere in world. See it in your face that\nyou already suffer great hurt from elephant, you or someone near you.\nAlso some of Kendah very fierce people and love fighting, and p'raps\nthere war in the land while you there, and in war people get killed.\"\n\n\"Very good, my friend,\" said Ragnall, \"I am prepared to take my\nchance of these things. Either we all go to your country together, as\nMacumazana has explained to you, or none of us go.\"\n\n\"We understand. That is our bargain and we no break word,\" replied\nHar\u00fbt.\n\nThen he turned his benevolent gaze upon Savage, and said: \"So you come\ntoo, Mr. Bena. That your name here, eh? Well, you learn lot things in\nKendahland, about snakes and all rest.\"\n\nHere the jovial-looking Mar\u00fbt whispered something into the ear of his\ncompanion, smiling all over his face and showing his white teeth as he\ndid so. \"Oh!\" went on Har\u00fbt, \"my brother tells me you meet one snake\nalready, down in country called Natal, but sit on him so hard, that he\ngrow quite flat and no bite.\"\n\n\"Who told him that?\" gasped Savage.\n\n\"Oh! forget. Think Macumazana. No? Then p'raps you tell him in sleep,\nfor people talk much in sleep, you know, and some other people got good\nears and hear long way. Or p'raps little joke Har\u00fbt. You 'member, he\nfirst-rate conjurer. P'raps he send that snake. No trouble if know how.\nWell, we show you much better snake Kendahland. But you no sit on _him_,\nMr. Bena.\"\n\nTo me, I know not why, there was something horrible in all this\njocosity, something that gave me the creeps as always does the sight\nof a cat playing with a mouse. I felt even then that it foreshadowed\nterrible things. How _could_ these men know the details of occurrences\nat which they were not present and of which no one had told them? Did\nthat strange \"tobacco\" of theirs really give them some clairvoyant\npower, I wondered, or had they other secret methods of obtaining news?\nI glanced at poor Savage and perceived that he too felt as I did, for\nhe had turned quite pale beneath his tan. Even Hans was affected, for\nhe whispered to me in Dutch: \"These are not men; these are devils, Baas,\nand this journey of ours is one into hell.\"\n\nOnly Ragnall sat stern, silent, and apparently quite unmoved. Indeed\nthere was something almost sphinx-like about the set and expression of\nhis handsome face. Moreover, I felt sure that Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt recognized\nthe man's strength and determination and that he was one with whom they\nmust reckon seriously. Beneath all their smiles and courtesies I could\nread this knowledge in their eyes; also that it was causing them grave\nanxiety. It was as though they knew that here was one against whom their\npower had no avail, whose fate was the master of their fate. In a sense\nHar\u00fbt admitted this to me, for suddenly he looked up and said in a\nchanged voice and in Bantu:\n\n\"You are a good reader of hearts, O Macumazana, almost as good as I am.\nBut remember that there is One Who writes upon the book of the heart,\nWho is the Lord of us who do but read, and that what He writes, that\nwill befall, strive as we may, for in His hands is the future.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" I replied coolly, \"and that is why I am going with you to\nKendahland and fear you not at all.\"\n\n\"So it is and so let it be,\" he answered. \"And now, Lords, are you ready\nto start? For long is the road and who knows what awaits us ere we see\nits end?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"long is the road of life and who knows what awaits us\nere we see its end--and after?\"\n\n\n\nThree hours later I halted the splendid white riding-camel upon which\nI was mounted, and looked back from the crest of a wave of the desert.\nThere far behind us on the horizon, by the help of my glasses, I could\nmake out the site of the camp we had left and even the tall ant-hill\nwhence I had gazed in the moonlight at our mysterious escort which\nseemed to have sprung from the desert as though by magic.\n\nThis was the manner of our march: A mile or so ahead of us went a picket\nof eight or ten men mounted on the swiftest beasts, doubtless to give\nwarning of any danger. Next, three or four hundred yards away, followed\na body of about fifty Kendah, travelling in a double line, and behind\nthese the baggage men, mounted like everyone else, and leading behind\nthem strings of camels laden with water, provisions, tents of skin\nand all our goods, including the fifty rifles and the ammunition that\nRagnall had brought from England. Then came we three white men and Hans,\neach of us riding as swift and fine a camel as Africa can breed. On\nour right at a distance of about half a mile, and also on our left,\ntravelled other bodies of the Kendah of the same numerical strength\nas that ahead, while the rear was brought up by the remainder of the\ncompany who drove a number of spare camels.\n\nThus we journeyed in the centre of a square whence any escape would have\nbeen impossible, for I forgot to say that our keepers Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt\nrode exactly behind us, at such a distance that we could call to them if\nwe wished.\n\nAt first I found this method of travelling very tiring, as does everyone\nwho is quite unaccustomed to camel-back. Indeed the swing and the jolt\nof the swift creature beneath me seemed to wrench my bones asunder to\nsuch an extent that at the beginning I had once or twice to be lifted\nfrom the saddle when, after hours of torture, at length we camped for\nthe night. Poor Savage suffered even more than I did, for the motion\nreduced him to a kind of jelly. Ragnall, however, who I think had ridden\ncamels before, felt little inconvenience, and the same may be said of\nHans, who rode in all sorts of positions, sometimes sideways like\na lady, and at others kneeling on the saddle like a monkey on a\nbarrel-organ. Also, being very light and tough as rimpis, the swaying\nmotion did not seem to affect him.\n\nBy degrees all these troubles left us to such an extent that I could\ncover my fifty miles a day, more or less, without even feeling tired.\nIndeed I grew to like the life in that pure and sparkling desert air,\nperhaps because it was so restful. Day after day we journeyed on across\nthe endless, sandy plain, watching the sun rise, watching it grow high,\nwatching it sink again. Night after night we ate our simple food with\nappetite and slept beneath the glittering stars till the new dawn broke\nin glory from the bosom of the immeasurable East.\n\nWe spoke but little during all this time. It was as though the silence\nof the wilderness had got hold of us and sealed our lips. Or perhaps\neach of us was occupied with his own thoughts. At any rate I know that\nfor my part I seemed to live in a kind of dreamland, thinking of the\npast, reflecting much upon the innumerable problems of this passing show\ncalled life, but not paying much heed to the future. What did the future\nmatter to me, who did not know whether I should have a share of it even\nfor another month, or week, or day, surrounded as I was by the shadow of\ndeath? No, I troubled little as to any earthly future, although I admit\nthat in this oasis of calm I reflected upon that state where past,\npresent and future will all be one; also that those reflections, which\nwere in their essence a kind of unshaped prayer, brought much calm to my\nspirit.\n\nWith the regiment of escort we had practically no communication; I think\nthat they had been forbidden to talk to us. They were a very silent set\nof men, finely-made, capable persons, of an Arab type, light rather than\ndark in colour, who seemed for the most part to communicate with each\nother by signs or in low-muttered words. Evidently they looked upon\nHar\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt with great veneration, for any order which either of\nthese brethren gave, if they were brethren, was obeyed without\ndispute or delay. Thus, when I happened to mention that I had lost a\npocket-knife at one of our camping-places two days' journey back, three\nof them, much against my wish, were ordered to return to look for it,\nand did so, making no question. Eight days later they rejoined us much\nexhausted and having lost a camel, but with the knife, which they handed\nto me with a low bow; and I confess that I felt ashamed to take the\nthing.\n\nNor did we exchange many further confidences with Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt. Up\nto the time of our arrival at the boundaries of the Kendah country, our\nonly talk with them was of the incidents of travel, of where we should\ncamp, of how far it might be to the next water, for water-holes or old\nwells existed in this desert, of such birds as we saw, and so forth. As\nto other and more important matters a kind of truce seemed to prevail.\nStill, I observed that they were always studying us, and especially Lord\nRagnall, who rode on day after day, self-absorbed and staring straight\nin front of him as though he looked at something we could not see.\n\nThus we covered hundreds of miles, not less than five hundred at the\nleast, reckoning our progress at only thirty miles a day, including\nstoppages. For occasionally we stopped at the water-holes or small\noases, where the camels drank and rested. Indeed, these were so\nconveniently arranged that I came to the conclusion that once there must\nhave been some established route running across these wastelands to\nthe south, of which the traditional knowledge remained with the Kendah\npeople. If so, it had not been used for generations, for save those of\none or two that had died on the outward march, we saw no skeletons of\ncamels or other beasts, or indeed any sign of man. The place was an\nabsolute wilderness where nothing lived except a few small mammals at\nthe oases and the birds that passed over it in the air on their way to\nmore fertile regions. Of these, by the way, I saw many that are known\nboth to Europe and Africa, especially ducks and cranes; also storks\nthat, for aught I can say, may have come from far-off, homely Holland.\n\nAt last the character of the country began to change. Grass appeared on\nits lower-lying stretches, then bushes, then occasional trees and among\nthe trees a few buck. Halting the caravan I crept out and shot two of\nthese buck with a right and left, a feat that caused our grave escort to\nstare in a fashion which showed me that they had never seen anything of\nthe sort done before.\n\nThat night, while we were eating the venison with relish, since it was\nthe first fresh meat that we had tasted for many a day, I observed that\nthe disposition of our camp was different from its common form. Thus it\nwas smaller and placed on an eminence. Also the camels were not allowed\nto graze where they would as usual, but were kept within a limited area\nwhile their riders were arranged in groups outside of them. Further, the\nstores were piled near our tents, in the centre, with guards set over\nthem. I asked Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, who were sharing our meal, the reason of\nthese alterations.\n\n\"It is because we are on the borders of the Kendah country,\" answered\nold Har\u00fbt. \"Four days' more march will bring us there, Macumazana.\"\n\n\"Then why should you take precautions against your own people? Surely\nthey will welcome you.\"\n\n\"With spears perhaps. Macumazana, learn that the Kendah are not one but\ntwo people. As you may have heard before, we are the White Kendah, but\nthere are also Black Kendah who outnumber us many times over, though in\nthe beginning we from the north conquered them, or so says our history.\nThe White Kendah have their own territory; but as there is no other\nroad, to reach it we must pass through that of the Black Kendah, where\nit is always possible that we may be attacked, especially as we bring\nstrangers into the land.\"\n\n\"How is it then that the Black Kendah allow you to live at all, Har\u00fbt,\nif they are so much the more numerous?\"\n\n\"Because of fear, Macumazana. They fear our wisdom and the decrees of\nthe Heavenly Child spoken through the mouth of its oracle, which, if it\nis offended, can bring a curse upon them. Still, if they find us outside\nour borders they may kill us, if they can, as we may kill them if we\nfind them within our borders.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Har\u00fbt. Then it looks to me as though there were a war breeding\nbetween you.\"\n\n\"A war is breeding, Macumazana, the last great war in which either the\nWhite Kendah or the Black Kendah must perish. Or perhaps both will die\ntogether. Maybe that is the real reason why we have asked you to be our\nguest, Macumazana,\" and with their usual courteous bows, both of them\nrose and departed before I could reply.\n\n\"You see how it stands,\" I said to Ragnall. \"We have been brought here\nto fight for our friends, Har\u00fbt, Mar\u00fbt and Co., against their rebellious\nsubjects, or rather the king who reigns jointly with them.\"\n\n\"It looks like it,\" he replied quietly, \"but doubtless we shall find\nout the truth in time and meanwhile speculation is no good. Do you go to\nbed, Quatermain, I will watch till midnight and then wake you.\"\n\nThat night passed in safety. Next day we marched before the dawn,\npassing through country that grew continually better watered and more\nfertile, though it was still open plain but sloping upwards ever more\nsteeply. On this plain I saw herds of antelopes and what in the distance\nlooked like cattle, but no human being. Before evening we camped where\nthere was good water and plenty of food for the camels.\n\nWhile the camp was being set Har\u00fbt came and invited us to follow him to\nthe outposts, whence he said we should see a view. We walked with him, a\nmatter of not more than a quarter of a mile to the head of that rise up\nwhich we had been travelling all day, and thence perceived one of\nthe most glorious prospects on which my eyes have fallen in all great\nAfrica. From where we stood the land sloped steeply for a matter of ten\nor fifteen miles, till finally the fall ended in a vast plain like to\nthe bottom of a gigantic saucer, that I presume in some far time of the\nworld's history was once an enormous lake. A river ran east and west\nacross this plain and into it fell tributaries. Far beyond this river\nthe contours of the country rose again till, many, many miles away,\nthere appeared a solitary hill, tumulus-shaped, which seemed to be\ncovered with bush.\n\nBeyond and surrounding this hill was more plain which with the aid of my\npowerful glasses was, we could see, bordered at last by a range of\ngreat mountains, looking like a blue line pencilled across the northern\ndistance. To the east and west the plain seemed to be illimitable.\nObviously its soil was of a most fertile character and supported numbers\nof inhabitants, for everywhere we could see their kraals or villages.\nMuch of it to the west, however, was covered with dense forest with, to\nall appearance, a clearing in its midst.\n\n\"Behold the land of the Kendah,\" said Har\u00fbt. \"On this side of the River\nTava live the Black Kendah, on the farther side, the White Kendah.\"\n\n\"And what is that hill?\"\n\n\"That is the Holy Mount, the Home of the Heavenly Child, where no man\nmay set foot\"--here he looked at us meaningly--\"save the priests of the\nChild.\"\n\n\"What happens to him if he does?\" I asked.\n\n\"He dies, my Lord Macumazana.\"\n\n\"Then it is guarded, Har\u00fbt?\"\n\n\"It is guarded, not with mortal weapons, Macumazana, but by the spirits\nthat watch over the Child.\"\n\nAs he would say no more on this interesting matter, I asked him as to\nthe numbers of the Kendah people, to which he replied that the Black\nKendah might number twenty thousand men of arm-bearing age, but the\nWhite Kendah not more than two thousand.\n\n\"Then no wonder you want spirits to guard your Heavenly Child,\" I\nremarked, \"since the Black Kendah are your foes and with you warriors\nare few.\"\n\nAt this moment our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a\npicket on a camel, who reported something to Har\u00fbt which appeared to\ndisturb him. I asked him what was the matter.\n\n\"That is the matter,\" he said, pointing to a man mounted on a rough pony\nwho just then appeared from behind some bushes about half a mile away,\ngalloping down the slope towards the plain. \"He is one of the scouts of\nSimba, King of the Black Kendah, and he goes to Simba's town in yonder\nforest to make report of our arrival. Return to camp, Macumazana, and\neat, for we must march with the rising of the moon.\"\n\nAs soon as the moon rose we marched accordingly, although the camels,\nmany of which were much worn with the long journey, scarcely had been\ngiven time to fill themselves and none to rest. All night we marched\ndown the long slope, only halting for half an hour before daylight to\neat something and rearrange the loads on the baggage beasts, which now,\nI noticed, were guarded with extra care. When we were starting again\nMar\u00fbt came to us and remarked with his usual smile, on behalf of his\nbrother Har\u00fbt, who was otherwise engaged, that it might be well if we\nhad our guns ready, since we were entering the land of the elephant Jana\nand \"who knew but that we might meet him?\"\n\n\"Or his worshippers on two legs,\" I suggested, to which his only reply\nwas a nod.\n\nSo we got our repeating rifles, some of the first that were ever made,\nserviceable but rather complicated weapons that fired five cartridges.\nHans, however, with my permission, armed himself with the little Purdey\npiece that was named \"Intombi,\" the singe-barrelled, muzzle-loading gun\nwhich had done me so much service in earlier days, and even on my last\njourney to Pongoland. He said that he was accustomed to it and did not\nunderstand these new-fangled breechloaders, also that it was \"lucky.\" I\nconsented as I did not think that it made much difference with what kind\nof rifle Hans was provided. As a marksman he had this peculiarity: up to\na hundred yards or so he was an excellent shot, but beyond that distance\nno good at all.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, as the dawn was breaking, we passed through\na kind of _nek_ of rough stones bordering the flat land, and emerged\ninto a compact body on to the edge of the grassy plain. Here the word\nwas given to halt for a reason that became clear to me so soon as I was\nout of the rocks. For there, marching rapidly, not half a mile away,\nwere some five hundred white-robed men. A large proportion of these\nwere mounted, the best being foot-soldiers, of whom more were running\nup every minute, appearing out of bush that grew upon the hill-side,\napparently to dispute our passage. These people, who were black-faced\nwith fuzzy hair upon which they wore no head-dress, all seemed to be\narmed with spears.\n\nPresently from out of the mass of them two horsemen dashed forward, one\nof whom bore a white flag in token that they came to parley. Our advance\nguard allowed them to pass and they galloped on, dodging in and out\nbetween the camels with wonderful skill till at length they came to\nwhere we were with Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, and pulling up their horses so\nsharply that the animals almost sat down on their haunches, saluted by\nraising their spears. They were very fine-looking fellows, perfectly\nblack in colour with a negroid cast of countenance and long frizzled\nhair which hung down on to their shoulders. Their clothing was light,\nconsisting of hide riding breeches that resembled bathing drawers,\nsandals, and an arrangement of triple chains which seemed to be made\nof some silvery metal that hung from their necks across the breast and\nback. Their arms consisted of a long lance similar to that carried by\nthe White Kendah, and a straight, cross-handled sword suspended from\na belt. This, as I ascertained afterwards, was the regulation cavalry\nequipment among these people. The footmen carried a shorter spear, a\nround leather shield, two throwing javelins or assegais, and a curved\nknife with a horn handle.\n\n\"Greeting, Prophets of the Child!\" cried one of them. \"We are messengers\nfrom the god Jana who speaks through the mouth of Simba the King.\"\n\n\"Say on, worshippers of the devil Jana. What word has Simba the King for\nus?\" answered Har\u00fbt.\n\n\"The word of war, Prophet. What do you beyond your southern boundary of\nthe Tava river in the territory of the Black Kendah, that was sealed\nto them by pact after the battle of a hundred years ago? Is not all\nthe land to the north as far as the mountains and beyond the mountains\nenough for you? Simba the King let you go out, hoping that the desert\nwould swallow you, but return you shall not.\"\n\n\"That we shall know presently,\" replied Har\u00fbt in a suave voice. \"It\ndepends upon whether the Heavenly Child or the devil Jana is the more\npowerful in the land. Still, as we would avoid bloodshed if we may, we\ndesire to explain to you, messengers of King Simba, that we are here\nupon a peaceful errand. It was necessary that we should convey the white\nlords to make an offering to the Child, and this was the only road by\nwhich we could lead them to the Holy Mount, since they come from the\nsouth. Through the forests and the swamps that lie to the east and west\ncamels cannot travel.\"\n\n\"And what is the offering that the white men would make to the Child,\nProphet? Oh! we know well, for like you we have our magic. The offering\nthat they must make is the blood of Jana our god, which you have brought\nthem here to kill with their strange weapons, as though any weapon could\nprevail against Jana the god. Now, give to us these white men that we\nmay offer them to the god, and perchance Simba the King will let you go\nthrough.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Har\u00fbt, \"seeing that you declare that the white men cannot\nharm Jana, to whom indeed they wish no harm. To surrender them to you\nthat they may be torn to pieces by the devil Jana would be to break the\nlaw of hospitality, for they are our guests. Now return to Simba the\nKing, and say to Simba that if he lifts a spear against us the threefold\ncurse of the Child shall fall upon him and upon you his people: The\ncurse of Heaven by storm or by drought. The curse of famine. The curse\nof war. I the prophet have spoken. Depart.\"\n\nWatching, I could see that this ultimatum delivered by Har\u00fbt in a most\nimpressive voice, and seconded as it was by the sudden and simultaneous\nlifting of the spears of all our escort that were within hearing,\nproduced a considerable effect upon the messengers. Their faces grew\nafraid and they shrank a little. Evidently the \"threefold curse of the\nChild\" suggested calamities which they dreaded. Making no answer, they\nwheeled their horses about and galloped back to the force that was\ngathering below as swiftly as they had come.\n\n\"We must fight, my Lord Macumazana,\" said Har\u00fbt, \"and if we would live,\nconquer, as I know that we shall do.\"\n\nThen he issued some orders, of which the result was that the caravan\nadopted a wedge-shaped formation like to that of a great flock of\nwildfowl on the wing. Har\u00fbt stationed himself almost at the apex of the\ntriangle. I with Hans and Mar\u00fbt were about the centre of the line, while\nRagnall and Savage were placed opposite to us in the right line, the\nwhole width of the wedge being between us. The baggage camels and their\nleaders occupied the middle space between the lines and were followed by\na small rear-guard.\n\nAt first we white men were inclined to protest at this separation, but\nwhen Mar\u00fbt explained to us that its object was to give confidence to the\ntwo divisions of the force and also to minimize the risk of destruction\nor capture of all three of us, of course we had nothing more to say.\nSo we just shook hands, and with as much assurance as we could command\nwished each other well through the job.\n\nThen we parted, poor Savage looking very limp indeed, for this was his\nfirst experience of war. Ragnall, however, who came of an old fighting\nstock, seemed to be happy as a king. I who had known so many battles,\nwas the reverse of happy, for inconveniently enough there flashed into\nmy mind at this juncture the dying words of the Zulu captain and seer,\nMavovo, which foretold that I too should fall far away in war; and I\nwondered whether this were the occasion that had been present to his\nforeseeing mind.\n\nOnly Hans seemed quite unconcerned. Indeed I noted that he took the\nopportunity of the halt to fill and light his large corn-cob pipe, a bit\nof bravado in the face of Providence for which I could have kicked him\nhad he not been perched in his usual monkey fashion on the top of a very\ntall camel. The act, however, excited the admiration of the Kendah, for\nI heard one of them call to the others:\n\n\"Look! He is not a monkey after all, but a man--more of a man than his\nmaster.\"\n\nThe arrangements were soon made. Within a quarter of an hour of the\ndeparture of the messengers Har\u00fbt, after bowing thrice towards the Holy\nMountain, rose in his stirrups and shaking a long spear above his head,\nshouted a single word:\n\n\"Charge!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nALLAN IS CAPTURED\n\nThe ride that followed was really quite exhilarating. The camels,\nnotwithstanding their long journey, seemed to have caught some of the\nenthusiasm of the war-horse as described in the Book of Job; indeed I\nhad no idea that they could travel at such a rate. On we swung down the\nslope, keeping excellent order, the forest of tall spears shining\nand the little lancer-like pennons fluttering on the breeze in a very\ngallant way. In silence we went save for the thudding of the hoofs of\nthe camels and an occasional squeal of anger as some rider drove his\nlance handle into their ribs. Not until we actually joined battle did\na single man open his lips. Then, it is true, there went up one\nsimultaneous and mighty roar of:\n\n\"The Child! Death to Jana! The Child! The Child!\"\n\nBut this happened a few minutes later.\n\nAs we drew near the enemy I saw that they had massed their footmen in\na dense body, six or eight lines thick. There they stood to receive the\nimpact of our charge, or rather they did not all stand, for the first\ntwo ranks were kneeling with long spears stretched out in front of them.\nI imagine that their appearance must have greatly resembled that of the\nGreek phalanx, or that of the Swiss prepared to receive cavalry in the\nMiddle Ages. On either side of this formidable body, which by now must\nhave numbered four or five hundred men, and at a distance perhaps of\na quarter of a mile from them, were gathered the horsemen of the Black\nKendah, divided into two bodies of nearly equal strength, say about a\nhundred horse in each body.\n\nAs we approached, our triangle curved a little, no doubt under the\ndirection of Har\u00fbt. A minute or so later I saw the reason. It was that\nwe might strike the foot-soldiers not full in front but at an angle. It\nwas an admirable manoeuvre, for when presently we did strike, we caught\nthem swiftly on the flank and crumpled them up. My word! we went through\nthose fellows like a knife through butter; they had as much chance\nagainst the rush of our camels as a brown-paper screen has against a\ntyphoon. Over they rolled in heaps while the White Kendah spitted them\nwith their lances.\n\n\"The Child is top dog! My money on the Child,\" reflected I in irreverent\necstasy. But that exultation was premature, for those Black Kendah were\nby no means all dead. Presently I saw that scores of them had appeared\namong the camels, which they were engaged in stabbing, or trying\nto stab, in the stomach with their spears. Also I had forgotten the\nhorsemen. As our charge slackened owing to the complication in front,\nthese arrived on our flanks like two thunderbolts. We faced about and\ndid our best to meet the onslaught, of which the net result was that\nboth our left and right lines were pierced through about fifty yards\nbehind the baggage camels. Luckily for us the very impetuosity of the\nBlack Kendah rush deprived it of most of the fruits of victory, since\nthe two squadrons, being unable to check their horses, ended by charging\ninto each other and becoming mixed in inextricable confusion. Then, I\ndo not know who gave the order, we wheeled our camels in and fell upon\nthem, a struggling, stationary mass, with the result that many of them\nwere speared, or overthrown and trampled.\n\n\"I have said we, but that is not quite correct, at any rate so far\nas Mar\u00fbt, Hans, I and about fifteen camelmen were concerned. How it\nhappened I could not tell in that dust and confusion, but we were\ncut off from the main body and presently found ourselves fighting\ndesperately in a group at which Black Kendah horsemen were charging\nagain and again. We made the best stand we could. By degrees the\nbewildered camels sank under the repeated spear-thrusts of the enemy,\nall except one, oddly enough that ridden by Hans, which by some strange\nchance was never touched. The rest of us were thrown or tumbled off the\ncamels and continued the fight from behind their struggling bodies.\"\n\nThat is where I came in. Up to this time I had not fired a single shot,\npartly because I do not like missing, which it is so easy to do from the\nback of a swaying camel, and still more for the reason that I had\nnot the slightest desire to kill any of these savage men unless I was\nobliged to do so in self-defence. Now, however, the thing was different,\nas I was fighting for my life. Leaning against my camel, which was dying\nand beating its head upon the ground, groaning horribly the while, I\nemptied the five cartridges of the repeater into those Black Kendah,\npausing between each shot to take aim, with the result that presently\nfive riderless horses were galloping loose about the veld.\n\nThe effect was electrical, since our attackers had never seen anything\nof the kind before. For a while they all drew off, which gave me time to\nreload. Then they came on again and I repeated the process. For a second\ntime they retreated and after consultation which lasted for a minute or\nmore, made a third attack. Once more I saluted them to the best of my\nability, though on this occasion only three men and a horse fell. The\nfifth shot was a clean miss because they came on in such a scattered\nformation that I had to turn from side to side to fire.\n\nNow at last the game was up, for the simple reason that I had no more\ncartridges save two in my double-barrelled pistol. It may be asked why.\nThe answer is, want of foresight. Too many cartridges in one's pocket\nare apt to chafe on camel-back and so is a belt full of them. In those\ndays also the engagements were few in which a man fired over fifteen.\nI had forty or fifty more in a bag, which bag Savage with his usual\npoliteness had taken and hung upon his saddle without saying a word to\nme. At the beginning of the action I found this out, but could not then\nget them from him as he was separated from me. Hans, always careless in\nsmall matters, was really to blame as he ought to have seen that I had\nthe cartridges, or at any rate to have carried them himself. In short,\nit was one of those accidents that will happen. There is nothing more to\nbe said.\n\nAfter a still longer consultation our enemies advanced on us for the\nfourth time, but very slowly. Meanwhile I had been taking stock of the\nposition. The camel corps, or what was left of it, oblivious of our\nplight which the dust of conflict had hidden from them, was travelling\non to the north, more or less victorious. That is to say, it had cut its\nway through the Black Kendah and was escaping unpursued, huddled up in\na mob with the baggage animals safe in its centre. The Black Kendah\nthemselves were engaged in killing our wounded and succouring their\nown; also in collecting the bodies of the dead. In short, quite\nunintentionally, we were deserted. Probably, if anybody thought about us\nat all in the turmoil of desperate battle, they concluded that we were\namong the slain.\n\nMar\u00fbt came up to me, unhurt, still smiling and waving a bloody spear.\n\n\"Lord Macumazana,\" he said, \"the end is at hand. The Child has saved the\nothers, or most of them, but us it has abandoned. Now what will you do?\nKill yourself, or if that does not please you, suffer me to kill you? Or\nshoot on until you must surrender?\"\n\n\"I have nothing to shoot with any more,\" I answered. \"But if we\nsurrender, what will happen to us?\"\n\n\"We shall be taken to Simba's town and there sacrificed to the devil\nJana--I have not time to tell you how. Therefore I propose to kill\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Then I think you are foolish, Mar\u00fbt, since once we are dead, we are\ndead; but while we are alive it is always possible that we may escape\nfrom Jana. If the worst comes to the worst I have a pistol with two\nbullets in it, one for you and one for me.\"\n\n\"The wisdom of the Child is in you,\" he replied. \"I shall surrender with\nyou, Macumazana, and take my chance.\"\n\nThen he turned and explained things to his followers, who spoke together\nfor a moment. In the end these took a strange and, to my mind, a very\nheroic decision. Waiting till the attacking Kendah were quite close\nto us, with the exception of three men, who either because they lacked\ncourage or for some other reason, stayed with us, they advanced humbly\nas though to make submission. A number of the Black Kendah dismounted\nand ran up, I suppose to take them prisoners. The men waited till\nthese were all round them. Then with a yell of \"The Child!\" they sprang\nforward, taking the enemy unawares and fighting like demons, inflicted\ngreat loss upon them before they fell themselves covered with wounds.\n\n\"Brave men indeed!\" said Mar\u00fbt approvingly. \"Well, now they are all at\npeace with the Child, where doubtless we shall find them ere long.\"\n\nI nodded but answered nothing. To tell the truth, I was too much engaged\nin nursing the remains of my own courage to enter into conversation\nabout that of other people.\n\nThis fierce and cunning stratagem of desperate men which had cost their\nenemies so dear, seemed to infuriate the Black Kendah.\n\nAt us came the whole mob of them--we were but six now--roaring \"Jana!\nJana!\" and led by a grey-beard who, to judge from the number of silver\nchains upon his breast and his other trappings, seemed to be a great man\namong them. When they were about fifty yards away and I was preparing\nfor the worst, a shot rang out from above and behind me. At the same\ninstant Greybeard threw his arms wide and letting fall the spear he\nheld, pitched from his horse, evidently stone dead. I glanced back and\nsaw Hans, the corn-cob pipe still in his mouth and the little rifle,\n\"Intombi,\" still at his shoulder. He had fired from the back of the\ncamel, I think for the first time that day, and whether by chance or\nthrough good marksmanship, I do not know, had killed this man.\n\nHis sudden and unexpected end seemed to fill the Black Kendah with grief\nand dismay. Halting in their charge they gathered round him, while a\nfierce-looking middle-aged man, also adorned with much barbaric finery,\ndismounted to examine him.\n\n\"That is Simba the King,\" said Mar\u00fbt, \"and the slain one is his uncle,\nGoru, the great general who brought him up from a babe.\"\n\n\"Then I wish I had another cartridge left for the nephew,\" I began and\nstopped, for Hans was speaking to me.\n\n\"Good-bye, Baas,\" he said, \"I must go, for I cannot load 'Intombi' on\nthe back of this beast. If you meet your reverend father the Predikant\nbefore I do, tell him to make a nice place ready for me among the\nfires.\"\n\nThen before I could get out an answer, Hans dragged his camel round;\nas I have said, it was quite uninjured. Urging it to a shambling gallop\nwith blows of the rifle stock, he departed at a great rate, not towards\nthe home of the Child but up the hill into a brake of giant grass\nmingled with thorn trees that grew quite close at hand. Here with\nstartling suddenness both he and the camel vanished away.\n\nIf the Black Kendah saw him go, of which I am doubtful, for they all\nseemed to be lost in consultation round their king and the dead general,\nGoru, they made no attempt to follow him. Another possibility is that\nthey thought he was trying to lead them into some snare or ambush.\n\nI do not know what they thought because I never heard them mention Hans\nor the matter of his disappearance, if indeed they ever realized that\nthere was such a person. Curiously enough in the case of men who had\njust shown themselves so brave, this last accident of the decease of\nGoru coming on the top of all their other casualties, seemed to take the\ncourage out of them. It was as though they had come to the conclusion\nthat we with our guns were something more than mortal.\n\nFor several minutes they debated in evident hesitation. At last from out\nof their array rode a single man, in whom I recognized one of the envoys\nwho had met us in the morning, carrying in his hand a white flag as he\nhad done before. Thereon I laid down my rifle in token that I would not\nfire at him, which indeed I could not do having nothing to fire. Seeing\nthis he came to within a few yards and halting, addressed Mar\u00fbt.\n\n\"O second Prophet of the Child,\" he said, \"these are the words of Simba\nthe King: Your god has been too strong for us to-day, though in a day\nto come it may be otherwise. I thought I had you in a pit; that you were\nthe bucks and I the hunter. But, though with loss, you have escaped out\nof the pit,\" and the speaker glanced towards our retreating force which\nwas now but a cloud of dust in the far distance, \"while I the hunter\nhave been gored by your horns,\" and again he glanced at the dead that\nwere scattered about the plain. \"The noblest of the buck, the white bull\nof the herd,\" and he looked at me, who in any other circumstances\nwould have felt complimented, \"and you, O Prophet Mar\u00fbt, and one or two\nothers, besides those that I have slain, are however still in the pit\nand your horn is a magic horn,\" here he pointed to my rifle, \"which\npierces from afar and kills dead all by whom it is touched.\"\n\n\"So I caught those gentry well in the middle,\" thought I to myself, \"and\nwith soft-nosed bullets!\"\n\n\"Therefore I, Simba the King, make you an offer. Yield yourselves and\nI swear that no spear shall be driven through your hearts and no knife\ncome near your throats. You shall only be taken to my town and there\nbe fed on the best and kept as prisoners, till once more there is peace\nbetween the Black Kendah and the White. If you refuse, then I will\nring you round and perhaps in the dark rush on you and kill you all. Or\nperhaps I will watch you from day to day till you, who have no water,\ndie of thirst in the heat of the sun. These are my words to which\nnothing may be added and from which nothing shall be taken away.\"\n\nHaving finished this speech he rode back a few yards out of earshot, and\nwaited.\n\n\"What will you answer, Lord Macumazana?\" asked Mar\u00fbt.\n\nI replied by another question. \"Is there any chance of our being rescued\nby your people?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"None. What we have seen to-day is but a small part\nof the army of the Black Kendah, one regiment of foot and one of horse,\nthat are always ready. By to-morrow thousands will be gathered, many\nmore than we can hope to deal with in the open and still less in their\nstrongholds, also Har\u00fbt will believe that we are dead. Unless the Child\nsaves us we shall be left to our fate.\"\n\n\"Then it seems that we are indeed in a pit, as that black brute of\na king puts it, Mar\u00fbt, and if he does what he says and rushes us at\nsundown, everyone of us will be killed. Also I am thirsty already and\nthere is nothing to drink. But will this king keep his word? There are\nother ways of dying besides by steel.\"\n\n\"I think that he will keep his word, but as that messenger said, he will\nnot add to his word. Choose now, for see, they are beginning to hedge us\nround.\"\n\n\"What do you say, men?\" I asked of the three who had remained with us.\n\n\"We say, Lord, that we are in the hands of the Child, though we wish\nnow that we had died with our brothers,\" answered their spokesman\nfatalistically.\n\nSo after Mar\u00fbt and I had consulted together for a little as to the form\nof his reply, he beckoned to the messenger and said:\n\n\"We accept the offer of Simba, although it would be easy for this lord\nto kill him now where he stands, namely, to yield ourselves as prisoners\non his oath that no harm shall come to us. For know that if harm does\ncome, the vengeance will be terrible. Now in proof of his good faith,\nlet Simba draw near and drink the cup of peace with us, for we thirst.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said the messenger, \"for then that white lord might kill him\nwith his tube. Give me the tube and Simba shall come.\"\n\n\"Take it,\" I said magnanimously, handing him the rifle, which he\nreceived in a very gingerly fashion. After all, I reflected, there is\nnothing much more useless than a rifle without ammunition.\n\nOff he went holding the weapon at arm's length, and presently Simba\nhimself, accompanied by some of his men, one of whom carried a skin of\nwater and another a large cup hollowed from an elephant's tusk, rode up\nto us. This Simba was a fine and rather terrifying person with a large\nmoustache and a chin shaved except for a little tuft of hair which\nhe wore at its point like an Italian. His eyes were big and dark,\nfrank-looking, yet now and again with sinister expression in the corners\nof them. He was not nearly so black as most of his followers; probably\nin bygone generations his blood had been crossed with that of the White\nKendah. He wore his hair long without any head-dress, held in place by a\nband of gold which I suppose represented a crown. On his forehead was\na large white scar, probably received in some battle. Such was his\nappearance.\n\nHe looked at me with great curiosity, and I have often wondered since\nwhat kind of an impression I produced upon him. My hat had fallen off,\nor I had knocked it off when I fired my last cartridge into his people,\nand forgotten to replace it, and my intractable hair, which was longer\nthan usual, had not been recently brushed. My worn Norfolk jacket was\ndyed with blood from a wounded or dying man who had tumbled against me\nin the scrimmage when the cavalry charged us, and my right leg and boot\nwere stained in a similar fashion from having rubbed against my camel\nwhere a spear had entered it. Altogether I must have appeared a most\ndisreputable object.\n\nSome indication of his opinion was given, however, in a remark, which of\ncourse I pretended not to understand, that I overheard him make to one\nof his officers:\n\n\"Truly,\" he said, \"we must not always look to the strong for strength.\nAnd yet this little white porcupine is strength itself, for see how much\ndamage he has wrought us. Also consider his eyes that appear to pierce\neverything. Jana himself might fear those eyes. Well, time that grinds\nthe rocks will tell us all.\"\n\nAll of this I caught perfectly, my ears being very sharp, although he\nthought that he spoke out of my hearing, for after spending a month in\ntheir company I understood the Kendah dialect of Bantu very well.\n\nHaving delivered himself thus he rode nearer and said:\n\n\"You, Prophet Mar\u00fbt, my enemy, have heard the terms of me, Simba the\nKing, and have accepted them. Therefore discuss them no more. What I\nhave promised I will keep. What I have given I give, neither greater nor\nless by the weight of a hair.\"\n\n\"So be it, O King,\" answered Mar\u00fbt with his usual smile, which nothing\never seemed to disturb. \"Only remember that if those terms are broken\neither in the letter or in the spirit, especially the spirit\" (that is\nthe best rendering I can give of his word), \"the manifold curses of\nthe Child will fall upon you and yours. Yes, though you kill us all by\ntreachery, still those curses will fall.\"\n\n\"May Jana take the Child and all who worship it,\" exclaimed the king\nwith evident irritation.\n\n\"In the end, O King, Jana will take the Child and its followers--or\nthe Child will take Jana and his followers. Which of these things must\nhappen is known to the Child alone, and perchance to its prophets.\nMeanwhile, for every one of those of the Child I think that three of the\nfollowers of Jana, or more, lie dead upon this field. Also the caravan\nis now out of your reach with two of the white lords and many of such\ntubes which deal death, like that which we have surrendered to you.\nTherefore because we are helpless, do not think that the Child is\nhelpless. Jana must have been asleep, O King, or you would have set your\ntrap better.\"\n\nI thought that this coolly insolent speech would have produced some\noutburst, but in fact it seemed to have an opposite effect. Making no\nreply to it, Simba said almost humbly:\n\n\"I come to drink the cup of peace with you and the white lord, O\nProphet. Afterwards we can talk. Give me water, slave.\"\n\nThen a man filled the great ivory cup with water from the skin he\ncarried. Simba took it and having sprinkled a little upon the ground,\nI suppose as an offering, drank from the cup, doubtless to show that it\nwas not poisoned. Watching carefully, I made sure that he swallowed what\nhe drank by studying the motions of his throat. Then he handed the cup\nwith a bow to Mar\u00fbt, who with a still deeper bow passed it to me. Being\nabsolutely parched I absorbed about a pint of it, and feeling a new man,\npassed the horn to Mar\u00fbt, who swallowed the rest. Then it was filled\nagain for our three White Kendah, the King first tasting the water as\nbefore, after which Mar\u00fbt and I had a second pull.\n\nWhen at length our thirst was satisfied, horses were brought to us,\nserviceable and docile little beasts with sheepskins for saddles and\nloops of hide for stirrups. On these we mounted and for the next three\nhours rode across the plain, surrounded by a strong escort and with an\narmed Black Kendah running on each side of our horses and holding in his\nhand a thong attached to the ring of the bridle, no doubt to prevent any\nattempt to escape.\n\nOur road ran past but not through some villages whence we saw many women\nand children staring at us, and through beautiful crops of mealies and\nother sorts of grain that in this country were now just ripening. The\nluxuriant appearance of these crops suggested that the rains must have\nbeen plentiful and the season all that could be desired. From some of\nthe villages by the track arose a miserable sound of wailing. Evidently\ntheir inhabitants had already heard that certain of their menkind had\nfallen in that morning's fight.\n\nAt the end of the third hour we began to enter the great forest which\nI had seen when first we looked down on Kendahland. It was filled with\nsplendid trees, most of them quite strange to me, but perhaps because of\nthe denseness of their overshadowing crowns there was comparatively\nno undergrowth. The general effect of the place was very gloomy, since\nlittle light could pass through the interlacing foliage of the tops of\nthose mighty trees.\n\nTowards evening we came to a clearing in this forest, it may have been\nfour or five miles in diameter, but whether it was natural or artificial\nI am not sure. I think, however, that it was probably the former for\ntwo reasons: the hollow nature of the ground, which lay a good many feet\nlower than the surrounding forest, and the wonderful fertility of the\nsoil, which suggested that it had once been deposited upon an old\nlake bottom. Never did I see such crops as those that grew upon that\nclearing; they were magnificent.\n\nWending our way along the road that ran through the tall corn, for here\nevery inch was cultivated, we came suddenly upon the capital of the\nBlack Kendah, which was known as Simba Town. It was a large place,\nsomewhat different from any other African settlement with which I\nam acquainted, inasmuch as it was not only stockaded but completely\nsurrounded by a broad artificial moat filled with water from a stream\nthat ran through the centre of the town, over which moat there were\nfour timber bridges placed at the cardinal points of the compass. These\nbridges were strong enough to bear horses or stock, but so made that in\nthe event of attack they could be destroyed in a few minutes.\n\nRiding through the eastern gate, a stout timber structure on the farther\nside of the corresponding bridge, where the king was received with\nsalutes by an armed guard, we entered one of the main streets of the\ntown which ran from north to south and from east to west. It was broad\nand on either side of it were the dwellings of the inhabitants set close\ntogether because the space within the stockade was limited. These were\nnot huts but square buildings of mud with flat roofs of some kind of\ncement. Evidently they were built upon the model of Oriental and North\nAfrican houses of which some debased tradition remained with these\npeople. Thus a stairway or ladder ran from the interior to the roof of\neach house, whereon its inhabitants were accustomed, as I discovered\nafterwards, to sleep during a good part of the year, also to eat in the\ncool of the day. Many of them were gathered there now to watch us pass,\nmen, women, and children, all except the little ones decently clothed in\nlong garments of various colours, the women for the most part in white\nand the men in a kind of bluish linen.\n\nI saw at once that they had already heard of the fight and of the\nconsiderable losses which their people had sustained, for their\nreception of us prisoners was most unfriendly. Indeed the men shook\ntheir fists at us, the women screamed out curses, while the children\nstuck out their tongues in token of derision or defiance. Most of these\ndemonstrations, however, were directed at Mar\u00fbt and his followers, who\nonly smiled indifferently. At me they stared in wonder not unmixed with\nfear.\n\nA quarter of a mile or so from the gate we came to an inner enclosure,\nthat answered to the South African cattle kraal, surrounded by a dry\nditch and a timber palisade outside of which was planted a green fence\nof some shrub with long white thorns. Here we passed through more\ngates, to find ourselves in an oval space, perhaps five acres in extent.\nEvidently this served as a market ground, but all around it were open\nsheds where hundreds of horses were stabled. No cattle seemed to be kept\nthere, except a few that with sheep and goats were driven in every day\nfor slaughter purposes at a shambles at the north end, from the great\nstock kraals built beyond the forest to the south, where they were safe\nfrom possible raiding by the White Kendah.\n\nA tall reed fence cut off the southern end of this marketplace, outside\nof which we were ordered to dismount. Passing through yet another gate\nwe found within the fence a large hut or house built on the same model\nas the others in the town, which Mar\u00fbt whispered to me was that of the\nking. Behind it were smaller houses in which lived his queen and women,\ngood-looking females, who advanced to meet him with obsequious bows. To\nthe right and left were two more buildings of about equal size, one of\nwhich was occupied by the royal guard and the other was the guest-house\nwhither we were conducted.\n\nIt proved to be a comfortable dwelling about thirty feet square but\ncontaining only one room, with various huts behind it that served for\ncooking and other purposes. In one of these the three camelmen were\nplaced. Immediately on our arrival food was brought to us, a lamb or kid\nroasted whole upon a wooden platter, and some green mealie-cobs boiled\nupon another platter; also water to drink and wash with in earthenware\njars of sun-dried clay.\n\nI ate heartily, for I was starving. Then, as it was useless to attempt\nprecautions against murder, without any talk to my fellow prisoner, for\nwhich we were both too tired, I threw myself down on a mattress stuffed\nwith corn husks in a corner of the hut, drew a skin rug over me and,\nhaving commended myself to the protection of the Power above, fell fast\nasleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE FIRST CURSE\n\nThe next thing I remember was feeling upon my face the sunlight that\npoured through a window-place which was protected by immovable wooden\nbars. For a while I lay still, reflecting as memory returned to me upon\nall the events of the previous day and upon my present unhappy position.\nHere I was a prisoner in the hands of a horde of fierce savages who had\nevery reason to hate me, for though this was done in self-defence, had\nI not killed a number of their people against whom personally I had no\nquarrel? It was true that their king had promised me safety, but what\nreliance could be put upon the word of such a man? Unless something\noccurred to save me, without doubt my days were numbered. In this way\nor in that I should be murdered, which served me right for ever entering\nupon such a business.\n\nThe only satisfactory point in the story was that, for the present at\nany rate, Ragnall and Savage had escaped, though doubtless sooner or\nlater fate would overtake them also. I was sure that they had escaped,\nsince two of the camelmen with us had informed Mar\u00fbt that they saw them\nswept away surrounded by our people and quite unharmed. Now they would\nbe grieving over my death, since none survived who could tell them\nof our capture, unless the Black Kendah chose to do so, which was not\nlikely. I wondered what course they would take when Ragnall found that\nhis quest was vain, as of course must happen. Try to get out of the\ncountry, I suppose, as I prayed they might succeed in doing, though this\nwas most improbable.\n\nThen there was Hans. He of course would attempt to retrace our road\nacross the desert, if he had got clear away. Having a good camel,\na rifle and some ammunition, it was just possible that he might win\nthrough, as he never forgot a path which he had once travelled, though\nprobably in a week's time a few bones upon the desert would be all that\nremained of him. Well, as he had suggested, perhaps we should soon be\ntalking the event over in some far sphere with my father--and others.\nPoor old Hans!\n\nI opened my eyes and looked about me. The first thing I noticed was that\nmy double-barrelled pistol, which I had placed at full cock beside\nme before I went to sleep, was gone, also my large clasp-knife. This\ndiscovery did not tend to raise my spirits, since I was now quite\nweaponless. Then I observed Mar\u00fbt seated on the floor of the hut staring\nstraight in front of him, and noted that at length even he had ceased to\nsmile, but that his lips were moving as though he were engaged in prayer\nor meditation.\n\n\"Mar\u00fbt,\" I said, \"someone has been in this place while we were asleep\nand stolen my pistol and knife.\"\n\n\"Yes, Lord,\" he answered, \"and my knife also. I saw them come in the\nmiddle of the night, two men who walked softly as cats, and searched\neverything.\"\n\n\"Then why did you not wake me?\"\n\n\"What would have been the use, Lord? If we had caught hold of the men,\nthey would have called out and we should have been murdered at once. It\nwas best to let them take the things, which after all are of no good to\nus here.\"\n\n\"The pistol might have been of some good,\" I replied significantly.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, nodding, \"but at the worst death is easy to find.\"\n\n\"Do you think, Mar\u00fbt, that we could manage to let Har\u00fbt and the others\nknow our plight? That smoke which I breathed in England, for instance,\nseemed to show me far-off things--if we could get any of it.\"\n\n\"The smoke was nothing, Lord, but some harmless burning powder which\nclouded your mind for a minute, and enabled you to see the thoughts that\nwere in _our_ minds. _We_ drew the pictures at which you looked. Also\nhere there is none.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I said, \"the old trick of suggestion; just what I imagined. Then\nthere's an end of that, and as the others will think that we are\ndead and we cannot communicate with them, we have no hope except in\nourselves.\"\n\n\"Or the Child,\" suggested Mar\u00fbt gently.\n\n\"Look here!\" I said with irritation. \"After you have just told me that\nyour smoke vision was a mere conjurer's trick, how do you expect me\nto believe in your blessed Child? Who is the Child? What is the Child,\nand--this is more important--what can it do? As your throat is going to\nbe cut shortly you may as well tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"Lord Macumazana, I will. Who and what the Child is I cannot say because\nI do not know. But it has been our god for thousands of years, and we\nbelieve that our remote forefathers brought it with them when they were\ndriven out of Egypt at some time unknown. We have writings concerning it\ndone up in little rolls, but as we cannot read them they are of no use\nto us. It has an hereditary priesthood, of which Har\u00fbt my uncle, for he\nis my uncle, is the head. We believe that the Child is God, or rather\na symbol in which God dwells, and that it can save us in this world and\nthe next, for we hold that man is an immortal spirit. We believe also\nthat through its Oracle--a priestess who is called Guardian of the\nChild--it can declare the future and bring blessings or curses upon men,\nespecially upon our enemies. When the Oracle dies we are helpless\nsince the Child has no 'mouth' and our enemies prevail against us. This\nhappened a long while ago, and the last Oracle having declared before\nher death that her successor was to be found in England, my uncle and I\ntravelled thither disguised as conjurers and made search for many years.\nWe thought that we had found the new Oracle in the lady who married the\nLord Igeza, because of that mark of the new moon upon her neck. After\nour return to Africa, however, for as I have spoken of this matter I may\nas well tell you all,\" here he stared me full in the eyes and spoke in\na clear metallic voice which somehow no longer convinced me, \"we found\nthat we had made a mistake, for the real Oracle, a mere girl, was\ndiscovered among our own people, and has now been for two years\ninstalled in her office. Without doubt the last Guardian of the Child\nwas wandering in her mind when she told us that story before her death\nas to a woman in England, a country of which she had heard through\nArabs. That is all.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I replied, feeling that it would be useless to show any\nsuspicion of his story. \"Now will you be so good as to tell me who and\nwhat is the god, or the elephant Jana, whom you have brought me here to\nkill? Is the elephant a god, or is the god an elephant? In either case\nwhat has it to do with the Child?\"\n\n\"Lord, Jana among us Kendah represents the evil in the world, as the\nChild represents the good. Jana is he whom the Mohammedans call Shaitan\nand the Christians call Satan, and our forefathers, the old Egyptians,\ncalled Set.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" thought I to myself, \"now we have got it. Horus the Divine Child,\nand Set the evil monster, with whom it strives everlastingly.\"\n\n\"Always,\" went on Mar\u00fbt, \"there has been war between the Child and Jana,\nthat is, between Good and Evil, and we know that in the end one of them\nmust conquer the other.\"\n\n\"The whole world has known that from the beginning,\" I interrupted. \"But\nwho and what is this Jana?\"\n\n\"Among the Black Kendah, Lord, Jana is an elephant, or at any rate his\nsymbol is an elephant, a very terrible beast to which sacrifices are\nmade, that kills all who do not worship him if he chances to meet them.\nHe lives farther on in the forest yonder, and the Black Kendah make use\nof him in war, for the devil in him obeys their priests.\"\n\n\"Indeed, and is this elephant always the same?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you, but for many generations it has been the same, for\nit is known by its size and by the fact that one of its tusks is twisted\ndownwards.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I remarked, \"all this proves nothing, since elephants certainly\nlive for at least two hundred years, and perhaps much longer. Also,\nafter they become 'rogues' they acquire every kind of wicked and\nunnatural habit, as to which I could tell you lots of stories. Have you\nseen this elephant?\"\n\n\"No, Macumazana,\" he answered with a shiver. \"If I had seen it should\nI have been alive to-day? Yet I fear I am fated to see it ere long,\nnot alone,\" and again he shivered, looking at me in a very suggestive\nmanner.\n\nAt this moment our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of two\nBlack Kendahs who brought us our breakfast of porridge and a boiled\nfowl, and stood there while we ate it. For my part I was not sorry, as\nI had learned all I wanted to know of the theological opinions and\npractice of the land, and had come to the conclusion that the terrible\ndevil-god of the Black Kendah was merely a rogue elephant of unusual\nsize and ferocity, which under other circumstances it would have given\nme the greatest pleasure to try to shoot.\n\nWhen we had finished eating, that is soon, for neither of our appetites\nwas good that morning, we walked out of the house into the surrounding\ncompound and visited the camelmen in their hut. Here we found them\nsquatted on the ground looking very depressed indeed. When I asked them\nwhat was the matter they replied, \"Nothing,\" except that they were men\nabout to die and life was pleasant. Also they had wives and children\nwhom they would never see again.\n\nHaving tried to cheer them up to the best of my ability, which I fear I\ndid without conviction, for in my heart I agreed with their view of the\ncase, we returned to the guest-house and mounted the stair which led to\nthe flat roof. Hence we saw that some curious ceremony was in progress\nin the centre of the market-place. At that distance we could not make\nout the details, for I forgot to say that my glasses had been stolen\nwith the pistol and knife, probably because they were supposed to be\nlethal weapons or instruments of magic.\n\nA rough altar had been erected, on which a fire burned. Behind it the\nking, Simba, was seated on a stool with various councillors about him.\nIn front of the altar was a stout wooden table, on which lay what\nlooked like the body of a goat or a sheep. A fantastically dressed man,\nassisted by other men, appeared to be engaged in inspecting the inside\nof this animal with, we gathered, unsatisfactory results, for presently\nhe raised his arms and uttered a loud wail. Then the creature's viscera\nwere removed from it and thrown upon the fire, while the rest of the\ncarcass was carried off.\n\nI asked Mar\u00fbt what he thought they were doing. He replied dejectedly:\n\n\"Consulting their Oracle; perhaps as to whether we should live or die,\nMacumazana.\"\n\nJust then the priest in the strange, feathered attire approached the\nking, carrying some small object in his hand. I wondered what it could\nbe, till the sound of a report reached my ears and I saw the man begin\nto jump round upon one leg, holding the other with both his hands at the\nknee and howling loudly.\n\n\"Ah!\" I said, \"that pistol was full cocked, and the bullet got him in\nthe foot.\"\n\nSimba shouted out something, whereon a man picked up the pistol and\nthrew it into the fire, round which the others gathered to watch it\nburn.\n\n\"You wait,\" I said to Mar\u00fbt, and as I spoke the words the inevitable\nhappened.\n\nOff went the other barrel of the pistol, which hopped out of the fire\nwith the recoil like a living thing. But as it happened one of the\nassistant priests was standing in front of the mouth of that barrel, and\nhe also hopped once, but never again, for the heavy bullet struck him\nsomewhere in the body and killed him. Now there was consternation.\nEveryone ran away, leaving the dead man lying on the ground. Simba led\nthe rout and the head-priest brought up the rear, skipping along upon\none leg.\n\nHaving observed these events, which filled me with an unholy joy, we\ndescended into the house again as there was nothing more to see, also\nbecause it occurred to me that our presence on the roof, watching their\ndiscomfiture, might irritate these savages. About ten minutes later the\ngate of the fence round the guest-house was thrown open, and through it\ncame four men carrying on a stretcher the body of the priest whom the\nbullet had killed, which they laid down in front of our door. Then\nfollowed the king with an armed guard, and after him the befeathered\ndiviner with his foot bound up, who supported himself upon the shoulders\nof two of his colleagues. This man, I now perceived, wore a hideous\nmask, from which projected two tusks in imitation of those of an\nelephant. Also there were others, as many as the space would hold.\n\nThe king called to us to come out of the house, which, having no choice,\nwe did. One glance at him showed me that the man was frantic with fear,\nor rage, or both.\n\n\"Look upon your work, magicians!\" he said in a terrible voice, pointing\nfirst to the dead priest, then to the diviner's wounded foot.\n\n\"It is no work of ours, King Simba,\" answered Mar\u00fbt. \"It is your own\nwork. You stole the magic weapon of the white lord and made it angry, so\nthat it has revenged itself upon you.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Simba, \"that the tube has killed one of those who\ntook it away from you and wounded the other\" (here was luck indeed).\n\"But it was you who ordered it to do so, magicians. Now, hark! Yesterday\nI promised you safety, that no spear should pierce your hearts and no\nknife come near your throats, and drank the cup of peace with you. But\nyou have broken the pact, working us more harm, and therefore it no\nlonger holds, since there are many other ways in which men can die.\nListen again! This is my decree. By your magic you have taken away the\nlife of one of my servants and hurt another of my servants, destroying\nthe middle toe of his left foot. If within three days you do not give\nback the life to him who seems to be dead, and give back the toe to him\nwho seems to be hurt, as you well can do, then you shall join those whom\nyou have slain in the land of death, how I will not tell you.\"\n\nNow when I heard this amazing sentence I gasped within myself, but\nthinking it better to keep up my r\u00f4le of understanding nothing of their\ntalk, I preserved an immovable countenance and left Mar\u00fbt to answer.\nThis, to his credit be it recorded, he did with his customary pleasant\nsmile.\n\n\"O King,\" he said, \"who can bring the dead back to life? Not even the\nChild itself, at any rate in this world, for there is no way.\"\n\n\"Then, Prophet of the Child, you had better find a way, or, I repeat, I\nsend you to join them,\" he shouted, rolling his eyes.\n\n\"What did my brother, the great Prophet, promise to you but yesterday,\nO King, if you harmed us?\" asked Mar\u00fbt. \"Was it not that the three great\ncurses should fall upon your people? Learn now that if so much as one\nof us is murdered by you, these things shall swiftly come to pass. I,\nMar\u00fbt, who am also a Prophet of the Child, have said it.\"\n\nNow Simba seemed to go quite mad, so mad that I thought all was over. He\nwaved his spear and danced about in front of us, till the silver chains\nclanked upon his breast. He vituperated the Child and its worshippers,\nwho, he declared, had worked evil on the Black Kendah for generations.\nHe appealed to his god Jana to avenge these evils, \"to pierce the Child\nwith his tusks, to tear it with his trunk, and to trample it with his\nfeet,\" all of which the wounded diviner ably seconded through his horrid\nmask.\n\nThere we stood before him, I leaning against the wall of the house with\nan air of studied nonchalance mingled with mild interest, at least that\nis what I meant to do, and Mar\u00fbt smiling sweetly and staring at the\nheavens. Whilst I was wondering what exact portion of my frame was\ndestined to become acquainted with that spear, of a sudden Simba gave it\nup. Turning to his followers, he bade them dig a hole in the corner of\nour little enclosure and set the dead man in it, \"with his head out so\nthat he may breathe,\" an order which they promptly executed.\n\nThen he issued a command that we should be well fed and tended, and\nremarking that if the departed was not alive and healthy on the third\nmorning from that day, we should hear from him again, he and his company\nstalked off, except those men who were occupied with the interment.\n\nSoon this was finished also. There sat the deceased buried to the neck\nwith his face looking towards the house, a most disagreeable sight.\nPresently, however, matters were improved in this respect by one of the\nsextons fetching a large earthenware pot and several smaller pots full\nof food and water. The latter they set round the head, I suppose for the\nsustenance of the body beneath, and then placed the big vessel inverted\nover all, \"to keep the sun off our sleeping brother,\" as I heard one say\nto the other.\n\nThis pot looked innocent enough when all was done, like one of those\nthat gardeners in England put over forced rhubarb, no more. And yet,\nsuch is the strength of the imagination, I think that on the whole I\nshould have preferred the object underneath naked and unadorned. For\ninstance, I have forgotten to say that the heads of those of the White\nKendah who had fallen in the fight had been set up on poles in front of\nSimba's house. They were unpleasant to contemplate, but to my mind not\nso unpleasant as that pot.\n\nAs a matter of fact, this precaution against injury from the sun to the\nlate diviner proved unnecessary, since by some strange chance from\nthat moment the sun ceased to shine. Quite suddenly clouds arose which\ngradually covered the whole sky and the weather began to turn very cold,\nunprecedentedly so, Mar\u00fbt informed me, for the time of year, which, it\nwill be remembered, in this country was the season just before harvest.\nObviously the Black Kendah thought so also, since from our seats on the\nroof, whither we had retreated to be as far as possible from the pot, we\nsaw them gathered in the market-place, staring at the sky and talking to\neach other.\n\nThe day passed without any further event, except the arrival of our\nmeals, for which we had no great appetite. The night came, earlier than\nusual because of the clouds, and we fell asleep, or rather into a series\nof dozes. Once I thought that I heard someone stirring in the huts\nbehind us, but as it was followed by silence I took no more notice. At\nlength the light broke very slowly, for now the clouds were denser\nthan ever. Shivering with the cold, Mar\u00fbt and I made a visit to the\ncamel-drivers, who were not allowed to enter our house. On going into\ntheir hut we saw to our horror that only two of them remained, seated\nstonily upon the floor. We asked where the third was. They replied they\ndid not know. In the middle of the night, they said, men had crept in,\nwho seized, bound and gagged him, then dragged him away. As there was\nnothing to be said or done, we returned to breakfast filled with horrid\nfears.\n\nNothing happened that day except that some priests arrived, lifted\nthe earthenware pot, examined their departed colleague, who by now had\nbecome an unencouraging spectacle, removed old dishes of food, arranged\nmore about him, and went off. Also the clouds grew thicker and thicker,\nand the air more and more chilly, till, had we been in any northern\nlatitude, I should have said that snow was pending. From our perch on\nthe roof-top I observed the population of Simba Town discussing the\nweather with ever-increasing eagerness; also that the people who were\ngoing out to work in the fields wore mats over their shoulders.\n\nOnce more darkness came, and this night, notwithstanding the cold, we\nspent wrapped in rugs, on the roof of the house. It had occurred to us\nthat kidnapping would be less easy there, as we could make some sort of\na fight at the head of the stairway, or, if the worst came to the worst,\ndive from the parapet and break our necks. We kept watch turn and turn\nabout. During my watch about midnight I heard a noise going on in the\nhut behind us; scuffling and a stifled cry which turned my blood cold.\nAbout an hour later a fire was lighted in the centre of the market-place\nwhere the sheep had been sacrificed, and by the flare of it I could see\npeople moving. But what they did I could not see, which was perhaps as\nwell.\n\nNext morning only one of the camelmen was left. This remaining man was\nnow almost crazy with fear, and could give no clear account of what had\nhappened to his companion.\n\nThe poor fellow implored us to take him away to our house, as he feared\nto be left alone with \"the black devils.\" We tried to do so, but armed\nguards appeared mysteriously and thrust him back into his own hut.\n\nThis day was an exact repetition of the others. The same inspection of\nthe deceased and renewal of his food; the same cold, clouded sky, the\nsame agitated conferences in the market-place.\n\nFor the third time darkness fell upon us in that horrible place. Once\nmore we took refuge on the roof, but this night neither of us slept.\nWe were too cold, too physically miserable, and too filled with mental\napprehensions. All nature seemed to be big with impending disaster. The\nsky appeared to be sinking down upon the earth. The moon was hidden, yet\na faint and lurid light shone now in one quarter of the horizon, now in\nanother. There was no wind, but the air moaned audibly. It was as though\nthe end of the world were near as, I reflected, probably might be\nthe case so far as we were concerned. Never, perhaps, have I felt so\nspiritually terrified as I was during the dreadful inaction of that\nnight. Even if I had known that I was going to be executed at dawn, I\nthink that by comparison I should have been light-hearted. But the worst\npart of the business was that I knew nothing. I was like a man forced to\nwalk through dense darkness among precipices, quite unable to guess when\nmy journey would end in space, but enduring all the agonies of death at\nevery step.\n\nAbout midnight again we heard that scuffle and stifled cry in the hut\nbehind us.\n\n\"He's gone,\" I whispered to Mar\u00fbt, wiping the cold sweat from my brow.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mar\u00fbt, \"and very soon we shall follow him, Macumazana.\"\n\nI wished that his face were visible so that I could see if he still\nsmiled when he uttered those words.\n\nAn hour or so later the usual fire appeared in the marketplace, round\nwhich the usual figures flitted dimly. The sight of them fascinated\nme, although I did not want to look, fearing what I might see. Luckily,\nhowever, we were too far off to discern anything at night.\n\nWhile these unholy ceremonies were in progress the climax came, that is\nso far as the weather was concerned. Of a sudden a great gale sprang\nup, a gale of icy wind such as in Southern Africa sometimes precedes\na thunderstorm. It blew for half an hour or more, then lulled. Now\nlightning flashed across the heavens, and by the glare of it we\nperceived that all the population of Simba Town seemed to be gathered in\nthe market-place. At least there were some thousands of them, talking,\ngesticulating, pointing at the sky.\n\nA few minutes later there came a great crash of thunder, of which it\nwas impossible to locate the sound, for it rolled from everywhere. Then\nsuddenly something hard struck the roof by my side and rebounded, to be\nfollowed next moment by a blow upon my shoulder which nearly knocked me\nflat, although I was well protected by the skin rugs.\n\n\"Down the stair!\" I called. \"They are stoning us,\" and suited the action\nto the word.\n\nTen seconds later we were both in the room, crouched in its farther\ncorner, for the stones or whatever they were seemed to be following us.\nI struck a match, of which fortunately I had some, together with my pipe\nand a good pocketful of tobacco--my only solace in those days--and, as\nit burned up, saw first that blood was running down Mar\u00fbt's face,\nand secondly, that these stones were great lumps of ice, some of them\nweighing several ounces, which hopped about the floor like live things.\n\n\"Hailstorm!\" remarked Mar\u00fbt with his accustomed smile.\n\n\"Hell storm!\" I replied, \"for whoever saw hail like that before?\"\n\nThen the match burnt out and conversation came to an end for the reason\nthat we could no longer hear each other speak. The hail came down with\na perpetual, rattling roar, that in its sum was one of the most terrible\nsounds to which I ever listened. And yet above it I thought that I could\ncatch another, still more terrible, the wail of hundreds of people in\nagony. After the first few minutes I began to be afraid that the roof\nwould be battered in, or that the walls would crumble beneath this\nperpetual fire of the musketry of heaven. But the cement was good and\nthe place well built.\n\nSo it came about that the house stood the tempest, which had it been\nroofed with tiles or galvanized iron I am sure it would never have done,\nsince the lumps of ice must have shattered one and pierced the other\nlike paper. Indeed I have seen this happen in a bad hailstorm in\nNatal which killed my best horse. But even that hail was as snowflakes\ncompared to this.\n\nI suppose that this natural phenomenon continued for about twenty\nminutes, not more, during ten of which it was at its worst. Then by\ndegrees it ceased, the sky cleared and the moon shone out beautifully.\nWe climbed to the roof again and looked. It was several inches deep in\njagged ice, while the market-place and all the country round appeared in\nthe bright moonlight to be buried beneath a veil of snow.\n\nVery rapidly, as the normal temperature of that warm land reasserted\nitself, this snow or rather hail melted, causing a flood of water which,\nwhere there was any fall, began to rush away with a gurgling sound. Also\nwe heard other sounds, such as that from the galloping hoofs of many\nof the horses which had broken loose from their wrecked stables at\nthe north end of the market-place, where in great number they had been\nkilled by the falling roofs or had kicked each other to death, and a\nwild universal wail that rose from every quarter of the big town, in\nwhich quantities of the worst-built houses had collapsed. Further, lying\nhere and there about the market-place we could see scores of dark shapes\nthat we knew to be those of men, women and children, whom those sharp\nmissiles hurled from heaven had caught before they could escape and\nslain or wounded almost to death. For it will be remembered that perhaps\nnot fewer than two thousand people were gathered on this market-place,\nattending the horrid midnight sacrifice and discussing the unnatural\nweather when the storm burst upon them suddenly as an avalanche.\n\n\"The Child is small, yet its strength is great. Behold the first curse!\"\nsaid Mar\u00fbt solemnly.\n\nI stared at him, but as he chose to believe that a very unusual\nhailstorm was a visitation from heaven I did not think it worth while\narguing the point. Only I wondered if he really did believe this. Then\nI remembered that such an event was said to have afflicted the old\nEgyptians in the hour of their pride because they would not \"let the\npeople go.\" Well, these blackguardedly Black Kendah were certainly worse\nthan the Egyptians can ever have been; also they would not let _us_\ngo. It was not wonderful therefore that Mar\u00fbt should be the victim of\nphantasies on the matter.\n\nNot until the following morning did we come to understand the full\nextent of the calamity which had overtaken the Black Kendah. I think I\nhave said that their crops this year were magnificent and just ripening\nto harvest. From our roof on previous days we could see a great area\nof them stretching to the edge of the forest. When the sun rose that\nmorning this area had vanished, and the ground was covered with a\ncarpet of green pulp. Also the forest itself appeared suddenly to have\nexperienced the full effects of a northern winter. Not a leaf was left\nupon the trees, which stood their pointing their naked boughs to heaven.\n\nNo one who had not seen it could imagine the devastating fury of that\nstorm. For example, the head of the diviner who was buried in the\ncourt-yard awaiting resurrection through our magic was, it may be\nrecalled, covered with a stout earthenware pot. Now that pot had\nshattered into sherds and the head beneath was nothing but bits of\nbroken bone which it would have been impossible for the very best magic\nto reconstruct to the likeness of a human being.\n\nCalamity indeed stalked naked through the land.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nJANA\n\nNo breakfast was brought to us that morning, probably for the reason\nthat there was none to bring. This did not matter, however, seeing that\nplenty of food accumulated from supper and other meals stood in a corner\nof the house practically untouched. So we ate what we could and then\npaid our usual visit to the hut in which the camelmen had been confined.\nI say had been, for now it was quite empty, the last poor fellow having\nvanished away like his companions.\n\nThe sight of this vacuum filled me with a kind of fury.\n\n\"They have all been murdered!\" I said to Mar\u00fbt.\n\n\"No,\" he replied with gentle accuracy. \"They have been sacrificed to\nJana. What we have seen on the market-place at night was the rite of\ntheir sacrifice. Now it will be our turn, Lord Macumazana.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I exclaimed, \"I hope these devils are satisfied with Jana's\nanswer to their accursed offerings, and if they try their fiendish\npranks on us----\"\n\n\"Doubtless there will be another answer. But, Lord, the question is,\nwill that help us?\"\n\nDumb with impotent rage I returned to the house, where presently the\nremains of the reed gate opened. Through it appeared Simba the King, the\ndiviner with the injured foot walking upon crutches, and others of whom\nthe most were more or less wounded, presumably by the hailstones. Then\nit was that in my wrath I put off the pretence of not understanding\ntheir language and went for them before they could utter a single word.\n\n\"Where are our servants, you murderers?\" I asked, shaking my fist at\nthem. \"Have you sacrificed them to your devil-god? If so, behold the\nfruits of sacrifice!\" and I swept my arm towards the country beyond.\n\"Where are your crops?\" I went on. \"Tell me on what you will live this\nwinter?\" (At these words they quailed. In their imagination already they\nsaw famine stalking towards them.) \"Why do you keep us here? Is it that\nyou wait for a worse thing to befall you? Why do you visit us here now?\"\nand I paused, gasping with indignation.\n\n\"We came to look whether you had brought back to life that doctor whom\nyou killed with your magic, white man,\" answered the king heavily.\n\nI stepped to the corner of the court-yard and, drawing aside a mat that\nI had thrown there, showed them what lay beneath.\n\n\"Look then,\" I said, \"and be sure that if you do not let us go, as\nyonder thing is, so shall all of you be before another moon has been\nborn and died. Such is the life we shall give to evil men like you.\"\n\nNow they grew positively terrified.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Simba, for the first time addressing me by a title of\nrespect, \"your magic is too strong for us. Great misfortune has fallen\nupon our land. Hundreds of people are dead, killed by the ice-stones\nthat you have called down. Our harvest is ruined, and there is but\nlittle corn left in the storepits now when we looked to gather the new\ngrain. Messengers come in from the outlying land telling us that nearly\nall the sheep and goats and very many of the cattle are slain. Soon we\nshall starve.\"\n\n\"As you deserve to starve,\" I answered. \"Now--will you let us go?\"\n\nSimba stared at me doubtfully, then began to whisper into the ear of\nthe lamed diviner. I could not catch what they said, so I watched their\nfaces. That of the diviner whose head I was glad to see had been cut by\na hailstone so that both ends of him were now injured, told me a good\ndeal. His mask had been ugly, but now that it was off the countenance\nbeneath was far uglier. Of a negroid type, pendulous-lipped, sensuous\nand loose-eyed, he was indeed a hideous fellow, yet very cunning and\ncruel-looking, as men of his class are apt to be. Humbled as he was\nfor the moment, I felt sure that he was still plotting evil against us,\nsomewhat against the will of his master. The issue showed that I was\nright. At length Simba spoke, saying:\n\n\"We had intended, Lord, to keep you and the priest of the Child here as\nhostages against mischief that might be worked on us by the followers\nof the Child, who have always been our bitter enemies and done us much\nundeserved wrong, although on our part we have faithfully kept the pact\nconcluded in the days of our grandfathers. It seems, however, that fate,\nor your magic, is too strong for us, and therefore I have determined to\nlet you go. To-night at sundown we will set you on the road which leads\nto the ford of the River Tava, which divides our territory from that of\nthe White Kendah, and you may depart where you will, since our wish is\nthat never again may we see your ill-omened faces.\"\n\nAt this intelligence my heart leapt in joy that was altogether\npremature. But, preserving my indignant air, I exclaimed:\n\n\"To-night! Why to-night? Why not at once? It is hard for us to cross\nunknown rivers in the dark.\"\n\n\"The water is low, Lord, and the ford easy. Moreover, if you started\nnow you would reach it in the dark; whereas if you start at sundown, you\nwill reach it in the morning. Lastly, we cannot conduct you hence until\nwe have buried our dead.\"\n\nThen, without giving me time to answer, he turned and left the place,\nfollowed by the others. Only at the gateway the diviner wheeled round on\nhis crutches and glared at us both, muttering something with his thick\nlips; probably it was curses.\n\n\"At any rate they are going to set us free,\" I said to Mar\u00fbt, not\nwithout exultation, when they had all vanished.\n\n\"Yes, Lord,\" he replied, \"but _where_ are they going to set us free? The\ndemon Jana lives in the forests and the swamps by the banks of the Tava\nRiver, and it is said that he ravages at night.\"\n\nI did not pursue the subject, but reflected to myself cheerfully that\nthis mystic rogue-elephant was a long way off and might be circumvented,\nwhereas that altar of sacrifice was extremely near and very difficult to\navoid.\n\nNever did a thief with a rich booty in view, or a wooer having an\nassignation with his lady, wait for sundown more eagerly than I did that\nday. Hour after hour I sat upon the house-top, watching the Black Kendah\ncarrying off the dead killed by the hailstones and generally trying to\nrepair the damage done by the terrific tempest. Watching the sun also\nas it climbed down the cloudless sky, and literally counting the minutes\ntill it should reach the horizon, although I knew well that it would\nhave been wiser after such a night to prepare for our journey by lying\ndown to sleep.\n\nAt length the great orb began to sink in majesty behind the tattered\nwestern forest, and, punctual to the minute, Simba, with a mounted\nescort of some twenty men and two led horses, appeared at our gate. As\nour preparations, which consisted only of Mar\u00fbt stuffing such food as\nwas available into the breast of his robe, were already made, we walked\nout of that accursed guest-house and, at a sign from the king, mounted\nthe horses. Riding across the empty market-place and past the spot where\nthe rough stone altar still stood with charred bones protruding from\nthe ashes of its extinguished fire--were they those of our friends the\ncamel-drivers? I wondered--we entered the north street of the town.\n\nHere, standing at the doors of their houses, were many of the\ninhabitants who had gathered to watch us pass. Never did I see hate more\nsavage than was written on those faces as they shook their fists at us\nand muttered curses not loud but deep.\n\nNo wonder! for they were all ruined, poor folk, with nothing to look\nforward to but starvation until long months hence the harvest came again\nfor those who would live to gather it. Also they were convinced that we,\nthe white magician and the prophet of their enemy the Child, had brought\nthis disaster on them. Had it not been for the escort I believe they\nwould have fallen on us and torn us to pieces. Considering them I\nunderstood for the first time how disagreeable real unpopularity _can\nbe_. But when I saw the actual condition of the fruitful gardens without\nin the waning daylight, I confess that I was moved to some sympathy with\ntheir owners. It was appalling. Not a handful of grain was there left\nto gather, for the corn had been not only \"laid\" but literally cut to\nribbons by the hail.\n\nAfter running for some miles through the cultivated land the road\nentered the forest. Here it was dark as pitch, so dark that I wondered\nhow our guides found their way. In that blackness dreadful apprehensions\nseized me, for I became convinced that we had been brought here to be\nmurdered. Every minute I expected to feel a knife-thrust in my back. I\nthought of digging my heels into the horse's sides and trying to gallop\noff anywhere, but abandoned the idea, first because I could not desert\nMar\u00fbt, of whom I had lost touch in the gloom, and secondly because I was\nhemmed in by the escort. For the same reason I did not try to slip from\nthe horse and glide away into the forest. There was nothing to be done\nsave to go on and await the end.\n\nIt came at last some hours later. We were out of the forest now, and\nthere was the moon rising, past her full but still very bright. Her\nlight showed me that we were on a wild moorland, swampy, with scattered\ntrees growing here and there, across which what seemed to be a game\ntrack ran down hill. That was all I could make out. Here the escort\nhalted, and Simba the King said in a sullen voice:\n\n\"Dismount and go your ways, evil spirits, for we travel no farther\nacross this place which is haunted. Follow the track and it will lead\nyou to a lake. Pass the lake and by morning you will come to the river\nbeyond which lies the country of your friends. May its waters swallow\nyou if you reach them. For learn, there is one who watches on this road\nwhom few care to meet.\"\n\nAs he finished speaking men sprang at us and, pulling us from the\nhorses, thrust us out of their company. Then they turned and in another\nminute were lost in the darkness, leaving us alone.\n\n\"What now, friend Mar\u00fbt?\" I asked.\n\n\"Now, Lord, all we can do is to go forward, for if we stay here Simba\nand his people will return and kill us at the daylight. One of them said\nso to me.\"\n\n\"Then, 'come on, Macduff,'\" I exclaimed, stepping out briskly, and\nthough he had never read Shakespeare, Mar\u00fbt understood and followed.\n\n\"What did Simba mean about 'one on the road whom few care to meet'?\" I\nasked over my shoulder when we had done half a mile or so.\n\n\"I think he meant the elephant Jana,\" replied Mar\u00fbt with a groan.\n\n\"Then I hope Jana isn't at home. Cheer up, Mar\u00fbt. The chances are that\nwe shall never meet a single elephant in this big place.\"\n\n\"Yet many elephants have been here, Lord,\" and he pointed to the ground.\n\"It is said that they come to die by the waters of the lake and this\nis one of the roads they follow on their death journey, a road that no\nother living thing dare travel.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I exclaimed. \"Then after all that was a true dream I had in the\nhouse in England.\"\n\n\"Yes, Lord, because my brother Har\u00fbt once lost his way out hunting when\nhe was young and saw what his mind showed you in the dream, and what we\nshall see presently, if we live to come so far.\"\n\nI made no reply, both because what he said was either true or false,\nwhich I should ascertain presently, and because I was engaged in\nsearching the ground with my eyes. He was right; many elephants had\ntravelled this path--one quite recently. I, a hunter of those brutes,\ncould not be deceived on this point. Once or twice also I thought that\nI caught sight of the outline of some tall creature moving silently\nthrough the scattered thorns a couple of hundred yards or so to our\nright. It might have been an elephant or a giraffe, or perhaps nothing\nbut a shadow, so I said nothing. As I heard no noise I was inclined\nto believe the latter explanation. In any case, what was the good of\nspeaking? Unarmed and solitary amidst unknown dangers, our position was\ndesperate, and as Mar\u00fbt's nerve was already giving out, to emphasize its\nhorrors to him would be mere foolishness.\n\nOn we trudged for another two hours, during which time the only living\nthing that I saw was a large owl which sailed round our heads as though\nto look at us, and then flew away ahead.\n\nThis owl, Mar\u00fbt informed me, was one of \"Jana's spies\" that kept him\nadvised of all that was passing in his territory. I muttered \"Bosh\"\nand tramped on. Still I was glad that we saw no more of the owl, for in\ncertain circumstances such dark fears are catching.\n\nWe reached the top of a rise, and there beneath us lay the most desolate\nscene that ever I have seen. At least it would have been the most\ndesolate if I did not chance to have looked on it before, in the\ndrawing-room of Ragnall Castle! There was no doubt about it. Below was\nthe black, melancholy lake, a large sheet of water surrounded by reeds.\nAround, but at a considerable distance, appeared the tropical forest. To\nthe east of the lake stretched a stony plain. At the time I could make\nout no more because of the uncertain light and the distance, for we had\nstill over a mile to go before we reached the edge of the lake.\n\nThe aspect of the place filled me with tremblings, both because of its\nutter uncanniness and because of the inexplicable truth that I had seen\nit before. Most people will have experienced this kind of moral shock\nwhen on going to some new land they recognize a locality as being quite\nfamiliar to them in all its details. Or it may be the rooms of a house\nhitherto unvisited by them. Or it may be a conversation of which, when\nit begins, they already foreknow the sequence and the end, because in\nsome dim state, when or how who can say, they have taken part in\nthat talk with those same speakers. If this be so even in cheerful\nsurroundings and among our friends or acquaintances, it is easy to\nimagine how much greater was the shock to me, a traveller on such a\njourney and in such a night.\n\nI shrank from approaching the shores of this lake, remembering that as\nyet all the vision was not unrolled. I looked about me. If we went to\nthe left we should either strike the water, or if we followed its edge,\nstill bearing to the left, must ultimately reach the forest, where\nprobably we should be lost. I looked to the right. The ground was strewn\nwith boulders, among which grew thorns and rank grass, impracticable for\nmen on foot at night. I looked behind me, meditating retreat, and there,\nsome hundreds of yards away behind low, scrubby mimosas mixed with\naloe-like plants, I saw something brown toss up and disappear again that\nmight very well have been the trunk of an elephant. Then, animated\nby the courage of despair and a desire to know the worst, I began to\ndescend the elephant track towards the lake almost at a run.\n\nTen minutes or so more brought us to the eastern head of the lake, where\nthe reeds whispered in the breath of the night wind like things alive.\nAs I expected, it proved to be a bare, open space where nothing seemed\nto grow. Yes, and all about me were the decaying remains of elephants,\nhundreds of them, some with their bones covered in moss, that may have\nlain here for generations, and others more newly dead. They were all\nold beasts as I could tell by the tusks, whether male or female. Indeed\nabout me within a radius of a quarter of a mile lay enough ivory to make\na man very rich for life, since although discoloured, much of it seemed\nto have kept quite sound, like human teeth in a mummy case. The sight\ngave me a new zest for life. If only I could manage to survive and carry\noff that ivory! I would. In this way or in that I swore that I would!\nWho could possibly die with so much ivory to be had for the taking? Not\nthat old hunter, Allan Quatermain.\n\nThen I forgot about the ivory, for there in front of me, just where\nit should be, just as I had seen it in the dream-picture, was the bull\nelephant dying, a thin and ancient brute that had lived its long life\nto the last hour. It searched about as though to find a convenient\nresting-place, and when this was discovered, stood over it, swaying\nto and fro for a full minute. Then it lifted its trunk and trumpeted\nshrilly thrice, singing its swan-song, after which it sank slowly to its\nknees, its trunk outstretched and the points of its worn tusks resting\non the ground. Evidently it was dead.\n\nI let my eyes travel on, and behold! about fifty yards beyond the dead\nbull was a mound of hard rock. I watched it with gasping expectation\nand--yes, on the top of the mound something slowly materialized.\nAlthough I knew what it must be well enough, for a while I could not see\nquite clearly because there were certain little clouds about and one of\nthem had floated over the face of the moon. It passed, and before me,\nperhaps a hundred and forty paces away, outlined clearly against the\nsky, I perceived the devilish elephant of my vision.\n\nOh! what a brute was that! In bulk and height it appeared to be half\nas big again as any of its tribe which I had known in all my life's\nexperience. It was enormous, unearthly; a survivor perhaps of some\nancient species that lived before the Flood, or at least a very giant of\nits kind. Its grey-black sides were scarred as though with fighting. One\nof its huge tusks, much worn at the end, for evidently it was very old,\ngleamed white in the moonlight. The other was broken off about halfway\ndown its length. When perfect it had been malformed, for it curved\ndownwards and not upwards, also rather out to the right.\n\nThere stood this mammoth, this leviathan, this _monstrum horrendum,\ninforme, ingens_, as I remember my old father used to call a certain\ngigantic and misshapen bull that we had on the Station, flapping a pair\nof ears that looked like the sides of a Kafir hut, and waving a trunk\nas big as a weaver's beam--whatever a weaver's beam may be--an appalling\nand a petrifying sight.\n\nI squatted behind the skeleton of an elephant which happened to be handy\nand well covered with moss and ferns and watched the beast, fascinated,\nwishing that I had a large-bore rifle in my hand. What became of Mar\u00fbt I\ndo not exactly know, but I think that he lay down on the ground.\n\nDuring the minute or so that followed I reflected a good deal, as we\ndo in times of emergency, often after a useless sort of a fashion. For\ninstance, I wondered why the brute appeared thus upon yonder mound, and\nthe thought suggested itself to me that it was summoned thither from\nsome neighbouring lair by the trumpet call of the dying elephant. It\noccurred to me even that it was a kind of king of the elephants, to\nwhich they felt bound to report themselves, as it were, in the hour\nof their decease. Certainly what followed gave some credence to my\nfantastical notion which, if there were anything in it, might account\nfor this great graveyard at that particular spot.\n\nAfter standing for a while in the attitude that I have described,\ntesting the air with its trunk, Jana, for I will call him so, lumbered\ndown the mound and advanced straight to where the elephant that I had\nthought to be dead was kneeling. As a matter of fact it was not quite\ndead, for when Jana arrived it lifted its trunk and curled it round\nthat of Jana as though in affectionate greeting, then let it fall to\nthe ground again. Thereon Jana did what I had seen it do in my dream or\nvision at Ragnall, namely, attacked it, knocking it over on to its side,\nwhere it lay motionless; quite dead this time.\n\nNow I remembered that the vision was not accurate after all, since in it\nI had seen Jana destroy a woman and a child, who on the present occasion\nwere wanting. Since then I have thought that this was because Har\u00fbt,\nclairvoyantly or telepathically, had conveyed to me, as indeed Mar\u00fbt\ndeclared, a scene which he had witnessed similar to that which I was\nwitnessing, but not identical in its incidents. Thus it happened,\nperhaps, that while the act of the woman and the child was omitted,\nin our case there was another act of the play to follow of which I had\nreceived no inkling in my Ragnall experience. Indeed, if I had received\nit, I should not have been there that night, for no inducement on earth\nwould have brought me to Kendahland.\n\nThis was the act. Jana, having prodded his dead brother to his\nsatisfaction, whether from viciousness or to put it out of pain, I\ncannot say, stood over the carcass in an attitude of grief or pious\nmeditation. At this time, I should mention, the wind, which had been\nrustling the hail-stripped reeds at the lake border, had died away\nalmost, but not completely; that is to say, only a very faint gust\nblew now and again, which, with a hunter's instinct, I observed with\nsatisfaction drew _from_ the direction of Jana towards ourselves. This I\nknew, because it struck on my forehead, which was wet with perspiration,\nand cooled the skin.\n\nPresently, however, by a cursed spite of fate, one of these gusts--a\nvery little one--came from some quarter behind us, for I felt it in my\nback hair, that was as damp as the rest of me. Just then I was glancing\nto my right, where it seemed to me that out of the corner of my eye I\nhad caught sight of something passing among the stones at a distance\nof a hundred yards or so, possibly the shadow of a cloud or another\nelephant. At the time I did not ascertain which it was, since a faint\nrattle from Jana's trunk reconcentrated all my faculties on him in a\npainfully vivid fashion.\n\nI looked to see that all the contemplation had departed from his\nattitude, now as alert as that of a fox-terrier which imagines he has\nseen a rat. His vast ears were cocked, his huge bulk trembled, his\nenormous trunk sniffed the air.\n\n\"Great Heavens!\" thought I to myself, \"he has winded us!\" Then I took\nsuch consolation as I could from the fact that the next gust once more\nstruck upon my forehead, for I hoped he would conclude that he had made\na mistake.\n\nNot a bit of it! Jana as far too old a bird--or beast--to make any\nmistake. He grunted, got himself going like a luggage train, and with\ngreat deliberation walked towards us, smelling at the ground, smelling\nat the air, smelling to the right, to the left, and even towards heaven\nabove, as though he expected that thence might fall upon him vengeance\nfor his many sins. A dozen times as he came did I cover him with an\nimaginary rifle, marking the exact spots where I might have hoped to\nsend a bullet to his vitals, in a kind of automatic fashion, for all my\nreal brain was contemplating my own approaching end.\n\nI wondered how it would happen. Would he drive that great tusk through\nme, would he throw me into the air, or would he kneel upon my poor\nlittle body, and avenge the deaths of his kin that had fallen at my\nhands? Mar\u00fbt was speaking in a rattling whisper:\n\n\"His priests have told Jana to kill us; we are about to die,\" he said.\n\"Before I die I want to say that the lady, the wife of the lord----\"\n\n\"Silence!\" I hissed. \"He will hear you,\" for at that instant I took not\nthe slightest interest in any lady on the earth. Fiercely I glared at\nMar\u00fbt and noted even then how pitiful was his countenance. There was no\nsmile there now. All its jovial roundness had vanished. It had sunk in;\nit was blue and ghastly with large, protruding eyes, like to that of a\nman who had been three days dead.\n\nI was right--Jana _had_ heard. Low as the whisper was, through that\nintense silence it had penetrated to his almost preternatural senses.\nForward he came at a run for twenty paces or more with his trunk held\nstraight out in front of him. Then he halted again, perhaps the length\nof a cricket pitch away, and smelt as before.\n\nThe sight was too much for Mar\u00fbt. He sprang up and ran for his life\ntowards the lake, purposing, I suppose, to take refuge in the water.\nOh! how he ran. After him went Jana like a railway engine--express this\ntime--trumpeting as he charged. Mar\u00fbt reached the lake, which was quite\nclose, about ten yards ahead, and plunging into it with a bound, began\nto swim.\n\nNow, I thought, he may get away if the crocodiles don't have him, for\nthat devil will scarcely take to the water. But this was just where I\nmade a mistake, for with a mighty splash in went Jana too. Also he was\nthe better swimmer. Mar\u00fbt soon saw this and swung round to the shore, by\nwhich manoeuvre he gained a little as he could turn quicker than Jana.\n\nBack they came, Jana just behind Mar\u00fbt, striking at him with his great\ntrunk. They landed, Mar\u00fbt flew a few yards ahead doubling in and out\namong the rocks like a hare and, to my horror, making for where I lay,\nwhether by accident or in a mad hope of obtaining protection, I do not\nknow.\n\nIt may be asked why I had not taken the opportunity to run also in the\nopposite direction. There are several answers. The first was that there\nseemed to be nowhere to run; the second, that I felt sure, if I did run,\nI should trip up over the skeletons of those elephants or the stones;\nthe third, that I did not think of it at once; the fourth, that Jana\nhad not yet seen me, and I had no craving to introduce myself to him\npersonally; and the fifth and greatest, that I was so paralysed with\nfear that I did not feel as though I could lift myself from the ground.\nEverything about me seemed to be dead, except my powers of observation,\nwhich were painfully alive.\n\nOf a sudden Mar\u00fbt gave up. Less than a stone's throw from me he wheeled\nround and, facing Jana, hurled at him some fearful and concentrated\ncurse, of which all that I could distinguish were the words: \"The\nChild!\"\n\nOddly enough it seemed to have an effect upon the furious rogue, which\nhalted in its rush and, putting its four feet together, slid a few paces\nnearer and stood still. It was just as though the beast had understood\nthe words and were considering them. If so, their effect was to rouse\nhim to perfect madness. He screamed terribly; he lashed his sides with\nhis trunk; his red and wicked eyes rolled; foam flew from the cavern\nof his open mouth; he danced upon his great feet, a sort of hideous\nScottish reel. Then he charged!\n\nI shut my eyes for a moment. When I opened them again it was to see\npoor Mar\u00fbt higher in the air than ever he flew before. I thought that\nhe would never come down, but he did at last with an awesome thud. Jana\nwent to him and very gently, now that he was dead, picked him up in his\ntrunk. I prayed that he might carry him away to some hiding-place and\nleave me in peace. But not so. With slow and stately strides, rocking\nthe deceased Mar\u00fbt up and down in his trunk, as a nurse might rock\na baby, he marched on to the very stone where I lay, behind which I\nsuppose he had seen or smelt me all the time.\n\nFor quite a long while, it seemed more than a century, he stood over me,\nstudying me as though I interested him very much, the water of the lake\ntrickling in a refreshing stream from his great ears on to my back. Had\nit not been for that water I think I should have fainted, but as it was\nI did the next best thing--pretended to be dead. Perhaps this monster\nwould scorn to touch a dead man. Watching out of the corner of my eye, I\nsaw him lift one vast paw that was the size of an arm-chair and hold it\nover me.\n\nNow good-bye to the world, thought I. Then the foot descended as a\nsteam-hammer does, but also as a steam-hammer sometimes does when used\nto crack nuts, stopped as it touched my back, and presently came to\nearth again alongside of me, perhaps because Jana thought the foothold\ndangerous. At any rate, he took another and better way. Depositing the\nremains of Mar\u00fbt with the most tender care beside me, as though the\nnurse were putting the child to bed, he unwound his yards of trunk and\nbegan to feel me all over with its tip, commencing at the back of my\nneck. Oh! the sensation of that clammy, wriggling tip upon my spinal\ncolumn!\n\nDown it went till it reached the seat of my trousers. There it pinched,\npresumably to ascertain whether or no I were malingering, a most\nagonizing pinch like to that of a pair of blacksmith's tongs. So sharp\nwas it that, although I did not stir, who was aware that the slightest\nmovement meant death, it tore a piece out of the stout cloth of my\nbreeches, to say nothing of a portion of the skin beneath. This seemed\nto astonish the beast, for it lifted the tip of its trunk and shifted\nits head, as though to examine the fragment by the light of the moon.\n\nNow indeed all was over, for when it saw blood upon that cloth----! I\nput up one short, piteous prayer to Heaven to save me from this terrible\nend, and lo, it was answered!\n\nFor just as Jana, the results of the inspection being unsatisfactory,\nwas cocking his ears and making ready to slay me, there rang out the\nshort, sharp report of a rifle fired within a few yards. Glancing up\nat the instant, I saw blood spurt from the monster's left eye, where\nevidently the bullet had found a home.\n\nHe felt at his eye with his trunk; then, uttering a scream of pain,\nwheeled round and rushed away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE CHASE\n\nI suppose that I swooned for a minute or two. At any rate I remember\na long and very curious dream, such a dream as is evolved by a patient\nunder laughing gas, that is very clear and vivid at the time but\nimmediately afterwards slips from the mind's grasp as water does\nfrom the clenched hand. It was something to the effect that all those\nhundreds of skeleton elephants rose and marshalled themselves before me,\nmaking obeisance to me by bending their bony knees, because, as I quite\nunderstood, I was the only human being that had ever escaped from Jana.\nMoreover, on the foremost elephant's skull Hans was perched like a\nmahout, giving words of command, to their serried ranks and explaining\nto them that it would be very convenient if they would carry their\ntusks, for which they had no further use, and pile them in a certain\nplace--I forget where--that must be near a good road to facilitate their\nsubsequent transport to a land where they would be made into billiard\nballs and the backs of ladies' hair-brushes. Next, through the figments\nof that retreating dream, I heard the undoubted voice of Hans himself,\nwhich of course I knew to be absurd as Hans was lost and doubtless dead,\nsaying:\n\n\"If you are alive, Baas, please wake up soon, as I have finished\nreloading Intombi, and it is time to be going. I think I hit Jana in the\neye, but so big a beast will soon get over so little a thing as that and\nlook for us, and the bullet from Intombi is too small to kill him, Baas,\nespecially as it is not likely that either of us could hit him in the\nother eye.\"\n\nNow I sat up and stared. Yes, there was Hans himself looking just the\nsame as usual, only perhaps rather dirtier, engaged in setting a cap on\nto the nipple of the little rifle Intombi.\n\n\"Hans,\" I said in a hollow voice, \"why the devil are you here?\"\n\n\"To save you from the devil, of course, Baas,\" he replied aptly. Then,\nresting the gun against the stone, the old fellow knelt down by my side\nand, throwing his arms around me, began to blubber over me, exclaiming:\n\n\"Just in time, Baas! Only just in time, for as usual Hans made a mess of\nthings and judged badly--I'll tell you afterwards. Still, just in time,\nthanks be to your reverend father, the Predikant. Oh! if he had delayed\nme for one more minute you would have been as flat as my nose, Baas. Now\ncome quickly. I've got the camel tied up there, and he can carry two,\nbeing fat and strong after four days' rest with plenty to eat. This\nplace is haunted, Baas, and that king of the devils, Jana, will be back\nafter us presently, as soon as he has wiped the blood out of his eye.\"\n\nI didn't make any remark, having no taste for conversation just then,\nbut only looked at poor Mar\u00fbt, who lay by me as though he was sleeping.\n\n\"Oh, Baas,\" said Hans, \"there is no need to trouble about him, for\nhis neck is broken and he's quite dead. Also it is as well,\" he added\ncheerfully. \"For, as your reverend father doubtless remembered, the\ncamel could never carry three. Moreover, if he stops here, perhaps Jana\nwill come back to play with him instead of following us.\"\n\nPoor Mar\u00fbt! This was his requiem as sung by Hans.\n\nWith a last glance at the unhappy man to whom I had grown attached in a\nway during our time of joint captivity and trial, I took the arm of the\nold Hottentot, or rather leant upon his shoulder, for at first I felt\ntoo weak to walk by myself, and picked my path with him through the\nstones and skeletons of elephants across the plateau eastwards, that\nis, away from the lake. About two hundred yards from the scene of our\ntragedy was a mound of rock similar to that on which Jana had appeared,\nbut much smaller, behind which we found the camel, kneeling as a\nwell-trained beast of the sort should do and tethered to a stone.\n\nAs we went, in brief but sufficient language Hans told me his story.\nIt seemed that after he had shot the Kendah general it came into his\ncunning, foreseeing mind that he might be of more use to me free than as\na companion in captivity, or that if I were killed he might in that case\nlive to bring vengeance on my slayers. So he broke away, as has been\ndescribed, and hid till nightfall on the hill-side. Then by the light\nof the moon he tracked us, avoiding the villages, and ultimately found\na place of shelter in a kind of cave in the forest near to Simba Town,\nwhere no people lived. Here he fed the camel at night, concealing it\nat dawn in the cave. The days he spent up a tall tree, whence he could\nwatch all that went on in the town beneath, living meanwhile on some\nfood which he carried in a bag tied to the saddle, helped out by green\nmealies which he stole from a neighbouring field.\n\nThus he saw most of what passed in the town, including the desolation\nwrought by the fearful tempest of hail, which, being in their cave, both\nhe and the camel escaped without harm. On the next evening from his\npost of outlook up the tree, where he had now some difficulty in hiding\nhimself because the hail had stripped off all its leaves, he saw Mar\u00fbt\nand myself brought from the guest-house and taken away by the escort.\nDescending and running to the cave, he saddled the camel and started\nin pursuit, plunging into the forest and hiding there when he perceived\nthat the escort were leaving us.\n\nHere he waited until they had gone by on their return journey. So close\ndid they pass to him that he could overhear their talk, which told him\nthey expected, or rather were sure, that we should be destroyed by the\nelephant Jana, their devil god, to whom the camelmen had been already\nsacrificed. After they had departed he remounted and followed us. Here I\nasked him why he had not overtaken us before we came to the cemetery of\nelephants, as I presumed he might have done, since he stated that he was\nclose in our rear. This indeed was the case, for it was the head of the\ncamel I saw behind the thorn trees when I looked back, and not the trunk\nof an elephant as I had supposed.\n\nAt the time he would give me no direct answer, except that he grew\nmuddled as he had already suggested, and thought it best to keep in the\nbackground and see what happened. Long afterwards, however, he admitted\nto me that he acted on a presentiment.\n\n\"It seemed to me, Baas,\" he said, \"that your reverend father was telling\nme that I should do best to let you two go on and not show myself, since\nif I did so we should all three be killed, as one of us must walk whom\nthe other two could not desert. Whereas if I left you as you were, one\nof you would be killed and the other escape, and that the one to be\nkilled would not be _you_, Baas. All of which came about as the Spirit\nspoke in my head, for Mar\u00fbt was killed, who did not matter, and--you\nknow the rest, Baas.\"\n\nTo return to Hans' story. He saw us march down to the borders of the\nlake, and, keeping to our right, took cover behind the knoll of rock,\nwhence he watched also all that followed. When Jana advanced to attack\nus Hans crept forward in the hope, a very wild one, of crippling him\nwith the little Purdey rifle. Indeed, he was about to fire at the hind\nleg when Mar\u00fbt made his run for life and plunged into the lake. Then he\ncrawled on to lead me away to the camel, but when he was within a few\nyards the chase returned our way and Mar\u00fbt was killed.\n\nFrom that moment he waited for an opportunity to shoot Jana in the only\nspot where so soft a bullet would, as he knew, have the faintest chance\nof injuring him vitally--namely, in the eye--for he was sure that its\npenetration would not be sufficient to reach the vitals through that\nthick hide and the mass of flesh behind. With an infinite and wonderful\npatience he waited, knowing that my life or death hung in the balance.\nWhile Jana held his foot over me, while he felt me with his trunk, still\nHans waited, balancing the arguments for and against firing upon the\nscales of experience in his clever old mind, and in the end coming to a\nright and wise conclusion.\n\nAt length his chance came, the brute exposed his eye, and by the light\nof the clear moon Hans, always a very good shot at a distance when it\nwas not necessary to allow for trajectory and wind, let drive and _hit_.\nThe bullet did not get to the brain as he had hoped; it had not strength\nfor that, but it destroyed this left eye and gave Jana such pain that\nfor a while he forgot all about me and everything else except escape.\n\nSuch was the Hottentot's tale as I picked it up from his laconic,\ncolourless, Dutch _patois_ sentences, then and afterwards; a very\nwonderful tale I thought. But for him, his fidelity and his bushman's\ncunning, where should I have found myself before that moon set?\n\n\n\nWe mounted the camel after I had paused a minute to take a pull from\na flask of brandy which remained in the saddlebags. Although he loved\nstrong drink so well Hans had saved it untouched on the mere chance\nthat it might some time be of service to me, his master. The monkey-like\nHottentot sat in front and directed the camel, while I accommodated\nmyself as best I could on the sheepskins behind. Luckily they were thick\nand soft, for Jana's pinch was not exactly that of a lover.\n\nOff we went, picking our way carefully till we reached the elephant\ntrack beyond the mound where Jana had appeared, which, in the light of\nfaith, we hoped would lead us to the River Tava. Here we made better\nprogress, but still could not go very fast because of the holes made by\nthe feet of Jana and his company. Soon we had left the cemetery behind\nus, and lost sight of the lake which I devoutly trusted I might never\nsee again.\n\nNow the track ran upwards from the hollow to a ridge two or three miles\naway. We reached the crest of this ridge without accident, except that\non our road we met another aged elephant, a cow with very poor tusks,\ntravelling to its last resting place, or so I suppose. I don't know\nwhich was the more frightened, the sick cow or the camel, for camels\nhate elephants as horses hate camels until they get used to them. The\ncow bolted to the right as quickly as it could, which was not very fast,\nand the camel bolted to the left with such convulsive bounds that we\nwere nearly thrown off its back. However, being an equable brute, it\nsoon recovered its balance, and we got back to the track beyond the cow.\n\nFrom the top of the rise we saw that before us lay a sandy plain lightly\nclothed in grass, and, to our joy, about ten miles away at the foot of\na very gentle slope, the moonlight gleamed upon the waters of a broad\nriver. It was not easy to make out, but it was there, we were both sure\nit was there; we could not mistake the wavering, silver flash. On we\nwent for another quarter of a mile, when something caused me to turn\nround on the sheepskin and look back.\n\nOh Heavens! At the very top of the rise, clearly outlined against\nthe sky, stood Jana himself with his trunk lifted. Next instant he\ntrumpeted, a furious, rattling challenge of rage and defiance.\n\n\"Allemagte! Baas,\" said Hans, \"the old devil is coming to look for\nhis lost eye, and has seen us with that which remains. He has been\ntravelling on our spoor.\"\n\n\"Forward!\" I answered, bringing my heels into the camel's ribs.\n\nThen the race began. The camel was a very good camel, one of the real\nrunning breed; also, as Hans said, it was comparatively fresh, and may,\nmoreover, have been aware that it was near to the plains where it had\nbeen bred. Lastly, the going was now excellent, soft to its spongy feet\nbut not too deep in sand, nor were there any rocks over which it could\nfall. It went off like the wind, making nothing of our united weights\nwhich did not come to more than two hundred pounds, or a half of what\nit could carry with ease, being perhaps urged to its top speed by the\nknowledge that the elephant was behind. For mile after mile we rushed\ndown the plain. But we did not go alone, for Jana came after us like a\ncruiser after a gunboat. Moreover, swiftly as we travelled, he travelled\njust a little swifter, gaining say a few yards in every hundred. For the\nlast mile before we came to the river bank, half an hour later perhaps,\nthough it seemed to be a week, he was not more than fifty paces to our\nrear. I glanced back at him, and in the light of the moon, which was\ngrowing low, he bore a strange resemblance to a mud cottage with broken\nchimneys (which were his ears flapping on each side of him), and the\nyard pump projecting from the upper window.\n\n\"We shall beat him now, Hans,\" I said looking at the broad river which\nwas now close at hand.\n\n\"Yes, Baas,\" answered Hans doubtfully and in jerks. \"This is very good\ncamel, Baas. He runs so fast that I have no inside left, I suppose\nbecause he smells his wife over that river, to say nothing of death\nbehind him. But, Baas, I am not sure; that devil Jana is still faster\nthan the camel, and he wants to settle for his lost eye, which makes him\nlively. Also I see stones ahead, which are bad for camels. Then there\nis the river, and I don't know if camels can swim, but Jana can as Mar\u00fbt\nlearned. Do you think, Baas, that you could manage to sting him up\nwith a bullet in his knee or that great trunk of his, just to give him\nsomething to think about besides ourselves?\"\n\nThus he prattled on, I believe to occupy my mind and his own, till at\nlength, growing impatient, I replied:\n\n\"Be silent, donkey. Can I shoot an elephant backwards over my shoulder\nwith a rifle meant for springbuck? Hit the camel! Hit it hard!\"\n\nAlas! Hans was right! There _were_ stones at the verge of the river,\nwhich doubtless it had washed out in periods of past flood, and\npresently we were among them. Now a camel, so good on sand that is its\nnative heath, is a worthless brute among stones, over which it slips and\nflounders. But to Jana these appeared to offer little or no obstacle. At\nany rate he came over them almost if not quite as fast as before. By\nthe time that we reached the brink of the water he was not more than ten\nyards behind. I could even see the blood running down from the socket of\nhis ruined eye.\n\nMoreover, at the sight of the foaming but shallow torrent, the camel,\na creature unaccustomed to water, pulled up in a mulish kind of way and\nfor a moment refused to stir. Luckily at this instant Jana let off one\nof his archangel kind of trumpetings which started our beast again,\nsince it was more afraid of elephants than it was of water.\n\nIn we went and were presently floundering among the loose stones at the\nbottom of the river, which was nowhere over four feet deep, with Jana\nsplashing after us not more than five yards behind. I twisted myself\nround and fired at him with the rifle. Whether I hit him or no I could\nnot say, but he stopped for a few seconds, perhaps because he remembered\nthe effect of a similar explosion upon his eye, which gave us a trifling\nstart. Then he came on again in his steam-engine fashion.\n\nWhen we were about in the middle of the river the inevitable happened.\nThe camel fell, pitching us over its head into the stream. Still\nclinging to the rifle I picked myself up and began half to swim half to\nwade towards the farther shore, catching hold of Hans with my free hand.\nIn a moment Jana was on to that camel. He gored it with his tusks, he\ntrampled it with his feet, he got it round the neck with his trunk,\ndragging nearly the whole bulk of it out of the water. Then he set to\nwork to pound it down into the mud and stones at the bottom of the river\nwith such a persistent thoroughness, that he gave us time to reach\nthe other bank and climb up a stout tree which grew there, a sloping,\nflat-topped kind of tree that was fortunately easy to ascend, at least\nfor a man. Here we sat gasping, perhaps about thirty feet above the\nground level, and waited.\n\nPresently Jana, having finished with the camel, followed us, and\nwithout any difficulty located us in that tree. He walked all round it\nconsidering the situation. Then he wound his huge trunk about the bole\nof the tree and, putting out his strength, tried to pull it over. It was\nan anxious moment, but this particular child of the forest had not grown\nthere for some hundreds of years, withstanding all the shocks of wind,\nweather and water, in order to be laid low by an elephant, however\nenormous. It shook a little--no more. Abandoning this attempt as futile,\nJana next began to try to dig it up by driving his tusk under its roots.\nHere, too, he failed because they grew among stones which evidently\njarred him.\n\nCeasing from these agricultural efforts with a deep rumble of rage, he\nadopted yet a third expedient. Rearing his huge bulk into the air he\nbrought down his forefeet with all the tremendous weight of his great\nbody behind them on to the sloping trunk of the tree just below where\nthe branches sprang, perhaps twelve or thirteen feet above the ground.\nThe shock was so heavy that for a moment I thought the tree would be\nuprooted or snapped in two. Thank Heaven! it held, but the vibration was\nsuch that Hans and I were nearly shaken out of the upper branches, like\nautumn apples from a bough. Indeed, I think I should have gone had not\nthe monkey-like Hans, who had toes to cling with as well as fingers,\ngripped me by the collar.\n\nThrice did Jana repeat this manoeuvre, and at the third onslaught I saw\nto my horror that the roots were loosening. I heard some of them snap,\nand a crack appeared in the ground not far from the bole. Fortunately\nJana never noted these symptoms, for abandoning a plan which he\nconsidered unavailing, he stood for a while swaying his trunk and lost\nin gentle thought.\n\n\"Hans,\" I whispered, \"load the rifle quick! I can get him in the spine\nor the other eye.\"\n\n\"Wet powder won't go off, Baas,\" groaned Hans. \"The water got to it in\nthe river.\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"and it is all your fault for making me shoot at him\nwhen I could take no aim.\"\n\n\"It would have been just the same, Baas, for the rifle went under water\nalso when we fell from the camel, and the cap would have been damp, and\nperhaps the powder too. Also the shot made Jana stop for a moment.\"\n\nThis was true, but it was maddening to be obliged to sit there with an\nempty gun, when if I had but one charge, or even my pistol, I was sure\nthat I could have blinded or crippled this satanic pachyderm.\n\nA few minutes later Jana played his last card. Coming quite close to\nthe trunk of the tree he reared himself up as before, but this time\nstretched out his forelegs so that these and his body were supported on\nthe broad bole. Then he elongated his trunk and with it began to break\noff boughs which grew between us and him.\n\n\"I don't think he can reach us,\" I said doubtfully to Hans, \"that is,\nunless he brings a stone to stand on.\"\n\n\"Oh! Baas, pray be silent,\" answered Hans, \"or he will understand and\nfetch one.\"\n\nAlthough the idea seemed absurd, on the whole I thought it well to take\nthe hint, for who knew how much this experienced beast did or did not\nunderstand? Then, as we could go no higher, we wriggled as far as we\ndared along our boughs and waited.\n\nPresently Jana, having finished his clearing operations, began to\nlengthen his trunk to its full measure. Literally, it seemed to expand\nlike a telescope or an indiarubber ring. Out it came, foot after foot,\ntill its snapping tip was waving within a few inches of us, just short\nof my foot and Han's head, or rather felt hat. One final stretch and he\nreached the hat, which he removed with a flourish and thrust into the\nred cavern of his mouth. As it appeared no more I suppose he ate it.\nThis loss of his hat moved Hans to fury. Hurling horrible curses at Jana\nhe drew his butcher's knife and made ready.\n\nOnce more the sinuous brown trunk elongated itself. Evidently Jana had\ngot a better hold with his hind legs this time, or perhaps had actually\nwriggled himself a few inches up the tree. At any rate I saw to my\ndismay that there was every prospect of my making a second acquaintance\nwith that snapping tip. The end of the trunk was lying along my bough\nlike a huge brown snake and creeping up, up, up.\n\n\"He'll get us,\" I muttered.\n\nHans said nothing but leaned forward a little, holding on with his left\nhand. Next instant in the light of the rising sun I saw a knife flash,\nsaw also that the point of it had been driven through the lower lip of\nJana's trunk, pinning it to the bough like a butterfly to a board.\n\nMy word! what a commotion ensued! Up the trunk came a scream which\nnearly blew me away. Then Jana, with a wriggling motion, tried to unnail\nhimself as gently as possible, for it was clear that the knife point\nhurt him, but could not do so because Hans still held the handle and had\ndriven the blade deep into the wood. Lastly he dragged himself downwards\nwith such energy that something had to go, that something being the skin\nand muscle of the lower lip, which was cut clean through, leaving the\nknife erect in the bough.\n\nOver he went backwards, a most imperial cropper. Then he picked himself\nup, thrust the tip of his trunk into his mouth, sucked it as one does a\ncut finger, and finally, roaring in defeated rage, fled into the river,\nwhich he waded, and back upon his tracks towards his own home. Yes, off\nhe went, Hans screaming curses and demands that he should restore his\nhat to him, and very seldom in all my life have I seen a sight that I\nthought more beautiful than that of his whisking tail.\n\n\"Now, Baas,\" chuckled Hans, \"the old devil has got a sore nose as well\nas a sore eye by which to remember us. And, Baas, I think we had better\nbe going before he has time to think and comes back with a long stick to\nknock us out of this tree.\"\n\nSo we went, in double-quick time I can assure you, or at any rate as\nfast as my stiff limbs and general condition would allow. Fortunately\nwe had now no doubt as to our direction, since standing up through the\nmists of dawn with the sunbeams resting on its forest-clad crest, we\ncould clearly see the strange, tumulus-shaped hill which the White\nKendah called the Holy Mount, the Home of the Child. It appeared to be\nabout twenty miles away, but in reality was a good deal farther, for\nwhen we had walked for several hours it seemed almost as distant as\never.\n\nIn truth that was a dreadful trudge. Not only was I exhausted with all\nthe terrors I had passed and our long midnight flight, but the wound\nwhere Jana had pinched out a portion of my frame, inflamed by the\nriding, had now grown stiff and intolerably sore, so that every step\ngave me pain which sometimes culminated in agony. Moreover, it was\nno use giving in, foodless as we were, for Mar\u00fbt had carried the\nprovisions, and with the chance of Jana returning to look us up. So I\nstuck to it and said nothing.\n\nFor the first ten miles the country seemed uninhabited; doubtless it\nwas too near the borders of the Black Kendah to be popular as a place\nof residence. After this we saw herds of cattle and a few camels,\napparently untended; perhaps their guards were hidden away in the long\ngrass. Then we came to some fields of mealies that were, I noticed,\nquite untouched by the hailstorm, which, it would seem, had confined its\nattentions to the land of the Black Kendah. Of these we ate thankfully\nenough. A little farther on we perceived huts perched on an inaccessible\nplace in a kloof. Also their inhabitants perceived us, for they ran away\nas though in a great fright.\n\nStill we did not try to approach the huts, not knowing how we should\nbe received. After my sojourn in Simba Town I had become possessed of a\nlove of life in the open.\n\nFor another two hours I limped forward with pain and grief--by now I was\nleaning on Hans' shoulder--up an endless, uncultivated rise clothed with\neuphorbias and fern-like cycads. At length we reached its top and found\nourselves within a rifle shot of a fenced native village. I suppose that\nits inhabitants had been warned of our coming by runners from the huts\nI have mentioned. At any rate the moment we appeared the men, to the\nnumber of thirty or more, poured out of the south gate armed with spears\nand other weapons and proceeded to ring us round and behave in a very\nthreatening manner. I noticed at once that, although most of them were\ncomparatively light in colour, some of these men partook of the negro\ncharacteristics of the Black Kendah from whom we had escaped, to such an\nextent indeed that this blood was clearly predominant in them. Still,\nit was also clear that they were deadly foes of this people, for when\nI shouted out to them that we were the friends of Har\u00fbt and those who\nworshipped the Child, they yelled back that we were liars. No friends\nof the Child, they said, came from the country of the Black Kendah, who\nworshipped the devil Jana. I tried to explain that least of all men in\nthe world did we worship Jana, who had been hunting us for hours, but\nthey would not listen.\n\n\"You are spies of Simba's, the smell of Jana is upon you\" (this may have\nbeen true enough), they yelled, adding: \"We will kill you, white-faced\ngoat. We will kill you, little yellow monkey, for none who are not\nenemies come here from the land of the Black Kendah.\"\n\n\"Kill us then,\" I answered, \"and bring the curse of the Child upon you.\nBring famine, bring hail, bring war!\"\n\nThese words were, I think, well chosen; at any rate they induced a pause\nin their murderous intentions. For a while they hesitated, all talking\ntogether at once. At last the advocates of violence appeared to get the\nupper hand, and once more a number of the men began to dance about us,\nwaving their spears and crying out that we must die who came from the\nBlack Kendah.\n\nI sat down upon the ground, for I was so exhausted that at the time I\ndid not greatly care whether I died or lived, while Hans drew his\nknife and stood over me, cursing them as he had cursed at Jana. By slow\ndegrees they drew nearer and nearer. I watched them with a kind of\nidle curiosity, believing that the moment when they came within actual\nspear-thrust would be our last, but, as I have said, not greatly caring\nbecause of my mental and physical exhaustion.\n\nI had already closed my eyes that I might not see the flash of the\nfalling steel, when an exclamation from Hans caused me to open them\nagain. Following the line of the knife with which he pointed, I\nperceived a troop of men on camels emerging from the gates of the\nvillage at full speed. In front of these, his white garments fluttering\non the wind, rode a bearded and dignified person in whom I recognized\nHar\u00fbt, Har\u00fbt himself, waving a spear and shouting as he came. Our\nassailants heard and saw him also, then flung down their weapons as\nthough in dismay either at his appearance or his words, which I could\nnot catch. Har\u00fbt guided his rushing camel straight at the man who I\npresume was their leader, and struck at him with his spear, as though\nin fury, wounding him in the shoulder and causing him to fall to the\nground. As he struck he called out:\n\n\"Dog! Would you harm the guests of the Child?\"\n\nThen I heard no more because I fainted away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE DWELLER IN THE CAVE\n\nAfter this it seemed to me that I dreamed a long and very troubled dream\nconcerning all sorts of curious things which I cannot remember. At last\nI opened my eyes and observed that I lay on a low bed raised about three\ninches above the floor, in an Eastern-looking room, large and cool. It\nhad window-places in it but no windows, only grass mats hung upon a\nrod which, I noted inconsequently, worked on a rough, wooden hinge, or\nrather pin, that enabled the curtain to be turned back against the wall.\n\nThrough one of these window-places I saw at a little distance the slope\nof the forest-covered hill, which reminded me of something to do with a\nchild--for the life of me I could not remember what. As I lay wondering\nover the matter I heard a shuffling step which I recognized, and,\nturning, saw Hans twiddling a new hat made of straw in his fingers.\n\n\"Hans,\" I said, \"where did you get that new hat?\"\n\n\"They gave it me here, Baas,\" he answered. \"The Baas will remember that\nthe devil Jana ate the other.\"\n\nThen I did remember more or less, while Hans continued to twiddle the\nhat. I begged him to put it on his head because it fidgeted me, and then\ninquired where we were.\n\n\"In the Town of the Child, Baas, where they carried you after you had\nseemed to die down yonder. A very nice town, where there is plenty to\neat, though, having been asleep for three days, you have had nothing\nexcept a little milk and soup, which was poured down your throat with a\nspoon whenever you seemed to half wake up for a while.\"\n\n\"I was tired and wanted a long rest, Hans, and now I feel hungry. Tell\nme, are the lord and Bena here also, or were they killed after all?\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, they are safe enough, and so are all our goods. They were\nboth with Har\u00fbt when he saved us down by the village yonder, but you\nwent to sleep and did not see them. They have been nursing you ever\nsince, Baas.\"\n\nJust then Savage himself entered, carrying some soup upon a wooden tray\nand looking almost as smart as he used to do at Ragnall Castle.\n\n\"Good day, sir,\" he said in his best professional manner. \"Very glad to\nsee you back with us, sir, and getting well, I trust, especially after\nwe had given you and Mr. Hans up as dead.\"\n\nI thanked him and drank the soup, asking him to cook me something more\nsubstantial as I was starving, which he departed to do. Then I sent Hans\nto find Lord Ragnall, who it appeared was out walking in the town. No\nsooner had they gone than Har\u00fbt entered looking more dignified than ever\nand, bowing gravely, seated himself upon the mat in the Eastern fashion.\n\n\"Some strong spirit must go with you, Lord Macumazana,\" he said, \"that\nyou should live today, after we were sure that you had been slain.\"\n\n\"That's where you made a mistake. Your magic was not of much service to\nyou there, friend Har\u00fbt.\"\n\n\"Yet my magic, as you call it, though I have none, was of some service\nafter all, Macumazana. As it chanced I had no opportunity of breathing\nin the wisdom of the Child for two days from the hour of our arrival\nhere, because I was hurt on the knee in the fight and so weary that I\ncould not travel up the mountain and seek light from the eyes of the\nChild. On the third day, however, I went and the Oracle told me all.\nThen I descended swiftly, gathered men and reached those fools in time\nto keep you from harm. They have paid for what they did, Lord.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, Har\u00fbt, for they knew no better; and, Har\u00fbt, although I\nsaved myself, or rather Hans saved me, we have left your brother behind,\nand with him the others.\"\n\n\"I know. Jana was too strong for them; you and your servant alone could\nprevail against him.\"\n\n\"Not so, Har\u00fbt. He prevailed against us; all we could do was to injure\nhis eye and the tip of his trunk and escape from him.\"\n\n\"Which is more than any others have done for many generations, Lord. But\ndoubtless as the beginning was, so shall the end be. Jana, I think, is\nnear his death and through you.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I repeated. \"Who and what is Jana?\"\n\n\"Have I not told you that he is an evil spirit who inhabits the body of\na huge elephant?\"\n\n\"Yes, and so did Mar\u00fbt; but I think that he is just a huge elephant with\na very bad temper of his own. Still, whatever he is, he will take some\nkilling, and I don't want to meet him again by that horrible lake.\"\n\n\"Then you will meet him elsewhere, Lord. For if you do not go to look\nfor Jana, Jana will come to look for you who have hurt him so sorely.\nRemember that henceforth, wherever you go in all this land, it may\nhappen that you will meet Jana.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that the brute comes into the territory of the White\nKendah?\"\n\n\"Yes, Macumazana, at times he comes, or a spirit wearing his shape\ncomes; I know not which. What I do know is that twice in my life I\nmyself have seen him upon the Holy Mount, though how he came or how he\nwent none can tell.\"\n\n\"Why was he wandering there, Har\u00fbt?\"\n\n\"Who can say, Lord? Tell me why evil wanders through the world and I\nwill answer your question. Only I repeat--let those who have harmed Jana\nbeware of Jana.\"\n\n\"And let Jana beware of me if I can meet him with a decent gun in my\nhand, for I have a score to settle with the beast. Now, Har\u00fbt, there is\nanother matter. Just before he was killed Mar\u00fbt, your brother, began to\ntell me something about the wife of the Lord Ragnall. I had no time to\nlisten to the end of his words, though I thought he said that she was\nupon yonder Holy Mount. Did I hear aright?\"\n\nInstantly Har\u00fbt's face became like that of a stone idol, impenetrable,\nimpassive.\n\n\"Either you misunderstood, Lord,\" he answered, \"or my brother raved in\nhis fear. Wherever she may be, that beautiful lady is not upon the\nHoly Mount, unless there is another Holy Mount in the Land of Death.\nMoreover, Lord, as we are speaking of this matter, let me tell you the\nforest upon that Mount must be trodden by none save the priest of\nthe Child. If others set foot there they die, for it is watched by a\nguardian more terrible even than Jana, nor is he the only one. Ask me\nnothing of that guardian, for I will not answer, and, above all, if you\nor your comrades value life, let them not seek to look upon him.\"\n\nUnderstanding that it was quite useless to pursue this subject farther\nat the moment, I turned to another, remarking that the hailstorm which\nhad smitten the country of the Black Kendah was the worst that I had\never experienced.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Har\u00fbt, \"so I have learned. That was the first of the\ncurses which the Child, through my mouth, promised to Simba and his\npeople if they molested us upon our road. The second, you will remember,\nwas famine, which for them is near at hand, seeing that they have little\ncorn in store and none left to gather, and that most of their cattle are\ndead of the hail.\"\n\n\"If they have no corn while, as I noted, you have plenty which the storm\nspared, will not they, who are many in number but near to starving,\nattack you and take your corn, Har\u00fbt?\"\n\n\"Certainly they will do so, Lord, and then will fall the third curse,\nthe curse of war. All this was foreseen long ago, Macumazana, and you\nare here to help us in that war. Among your goods you have many guns and\nmuch powder and lead. You shall teach our people how to use those guns,\nthat with them we may destroy the Black Kendah.\"\n\n\"I think not,\" I replied quietly. \"I came here to kill a certain\nelephant, and to receive payment for my service in ivory, not to fight\nthe Black Kendah, of whom I have already seen enough. Moreover, the guns\nare not my property but that of the Lord Ragnall, who perhaps will ask\nhis own price for the use of them.\"\n\n\"And the Lord Ragnall, who came here against our will, is, as it\nchances, our property and we may ask your own price for his life. Now,\nfarewell for a while, since you, who are still sick and weak, have\ntalked enough. Only before I go, as your friend and that of those with\nyou, I will add one word. If you would continue to look upon the sun,\nlet none of you try to set foot in the forest upon the Holy Mount.\nWander where you will upon its southern slopes, but strive not to pass\nthe wall of rock which rings the forest round.\"\n\nThen he rose, bowed gravely and departed, leaving me full of\nreflections.\n\nShortly afterwards Savage and Hans returned, bringing me some meat which\nthe former had cooked in an admirable fashion. I ate of it heartily, and\njust as they were carrying off the remains of the meal Ragnall himself\narrived. Our greeting was very warm, as might be expected in the case of\ntwo comrades who never thought to speak to each other again on this side\nof the grave. As I had supposed, he was certain that Hans and I had been\ncut off and killed by the Black Kendah, as, after we were missed, some\nof the camelmen asserted that they had actually seen us fall. So he went\non, or rather was carried on by the rush of the camels, grieving, since,\nit being impossible to attempt to recover our bodies or even to return,\nthat was the only thing to do, and in due course reached the Town of\nthe Child without further accident. Here they rested and mourned for\nus, till some days later Har\u00fbt suddenly announced that we still lived,\nthough how he knew this they could not ascertain. Then they sallied\nout and found us, as has been told, in great danger from the ignorant\nvillagers who, until we appeared, had not even heard of our existence.\n\nI asked what they had done and what information they had obtained since\ntheir arrival at this place. His answer was: Nothing and none worth\nmentioning. The town appeared to be a small one of not much over two\nthousand inhabitants, all of whom were engaged in agricultural pursuits\nand in camel-breeding. The herds of camels, however, they gathered, for\nthe most part were kept at outlying settlements on the farther side of\nthe cone-shaped mountain. As they were unable to talk the language the\nonly person from whom they could gain knowledge was Har\u00fbt, who spoke\nto them in his broken English and told them much what he had told me,\nnamely that the upper mountain was a sacred place that might only be\nvisited by the priests, since any uninitiated person who set foot there\ncame to a bad end. They had not seen any of these priests in the town,\nwhere no form of worship appeared to be practised, but they had observed\nmen driving small numbers of sheep or goats up the flanks of the\nmountain towards the forest.\n\nOf what went on upon this mountain and who lived there they remained\nin complete ignorance. It was a case of stalemate. Har\u00fbt would not tell\nthem anything nor could they learn anything for themselves. He added in\na depressed way that the whole business seemed very hopeless, and that\nhe had begun to doubt whether there was any tidings of his lost wife to\nbe gained among the Kendah, White or Black.\n\nNow I repeated to him Mar\u00fbt's dying words, of which most unhappily I had\nnever heard the end. These seemed to give him new life since they showed\nthat tidings there was of some sort, if only it could be extracted. But\nhow might this be done? How, how?\n\n\n\nFor a whole week things went on thus. During this time I recovered\nmy strength completely, except in one particular which reduced me to\nhelplessness. The place on my thigh where Jana had pinched out a bit of\nthe skin healed up well enough, but the inflammation struck inwards to\nthe nerve of my left leg, where once I had been injured by a lion, with\nthe result that whenever I tried to move I was tortured by pains of a\nsciatic nature. So I was obliged to lie still and to content myself\nwith being carried on the bed into a little garden which surrounded\nthe mud-built and white-washed house that had been allotted to us as a\ndwelling-place.\n\nThere I lay hour after hour, staring at the Holy Mount which began\nto spring from the plain within a few hundred yards of the scattered\ntownship. For a mile or so its slopes were bare except for grass on\nwhich sheep and goats were grazed, and a few scattered trees. Studying\nthe place through glasses I observed that these slopes were crowned by\na vertical precipice of what looked like lava rock, which seemed to\nsurround the whole mountain and must have been quite a hundred\nfeet high. Beyond this precipice, which to all appearance was of an\nunclimbable nature, began a dense forest of large trees, cedars I\nthought, clothing it to the very top, that is so far as I could see.\n\nOne day when I was considering the place, Har\u00fbt entered the garden\nsuddenly and caught me in the act.\n\n\"The House of the god is beautiful,\" he said, \"is it not?\"\n\n\"Very,\" I answered, \"and of a strange formation. But how do those who\ndwell on it climb that precipice?\"\n\n\"It cannot be climbed,\" he answered, \"but there is a road which I\nam about to travel who go to worship the Child. Yet I have told you,\nMacumazana, that any strangers who seek to walk that road find death. If\nthey do not believe me, let them try,\" he added meaningly.\n\nThen, after many inquiries about my health, he informed me that news had\nreached him to the effect that the Black Kendah were mad at the loss\nof their crops which the hail had destroyed and because of the near\nprospect of starvation.\n\n\"Then soon they will be wishing to reap yours with spears,\" I said.\n\n\"That is so. Therefore, my Lord Macumazana, get well quickly that you\nmay be able to scare away these crows with guns, for in fourteen days\nthe harvest should begin upon our uplands. Farewell and have no fears,\nfor during my absence my people will feed and watch you and on the third\nnight I shall return again.\"\n\nAfter Har\u00fbt's departure a deep depression fell upon all of us. Even\nHans was depressed, while Savage became like a man under sentence of\nexecution at a near but uncertain date. I tried to cheer him up and\nasked him what was the matter.\n\n\"I don't know, Mr. Quatermain,\" he answered, \"but the fact is this is\na 'ateful and un'oly 'ole\" (in his agitation he quite lost grip of his\nh's, which was always weak), \"and I am sure that it is the last I shall\never see, except one.\"\n\n\"Well, Savage,\" I said jokingly, \"at any rate there don't seem to be any\nsnakes here.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Quatermain. That is, I haven't met any, but they crawl about me\nall night, and whenever I see that prophet man he talks of them to me.\nYes, he talks of them and nothing else with a sort of cold look in his\neyes that makes my back creep. I wish it was over, I do, who shall\nnever see old England again,\" and he went away, I think to hide his very\npainful and evident emotion.\n\nThat evening Hans returned from an expedition on which I had sent him\nwith instructions to try to get round the mountain and report what was\non its other side. It had been a complete failure, as after he had gone\na few miles men appeared who ordered him back. They were so threatening\nin their demeanour that had it not been for the little rifle, Intombi,\nwhich he carried under pretence of shooting buck, a weapon that they\nregarded with great awe, they would, he thought, have killed him. He\nadded that he had been quite unsuccessful in his efforts to collect\nany news of value from man, woman or child, all of whom, although very\npolite, appeared to have orders to tell him nothing, concluding with the\nremark that he considered the White Kendah bigger devils than the Black\nKendah, inasmuch as they were more clever.\n\n\n\nShortly after this abortive attempt we debated our position with\nearnestness and came to a certain conclusion, of which I will speak in\nits place.\n\nIf I remember right it was on this same night of our debate, after\nHar\u00fbt's return from the mountain, that the first incident of interest\nhappened. There were two rooms in our house divided by a partition\nwhich ran almost up to the roof. In the left-hand room slept Ragnall\nand Savage, and in that to the right Hans and I. Just at the breaking of\ndawn I was awakened by hearing some agitated conversation between Savage\nand his master. A minute later they both entered my sleeping place, and\nI saw in the faint light that Ragnall looked very disturbed and Savage\nvery frightened.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked.\n\n\"We have seen my wife,\" answered Ragnall.\n\nI stared at him and he went on:\n\n\"Savage woke me by saying that there was someone in the room. I sat up\nand looked and, as I live, Quatermain, standing gazing at me in such a\nposition that the light of dawn from the window-place fell upon her, was\nmy wife.\"\n\n\"How was she dressed?\" I asked at once.\n\n\"In a kind of white robe cut rather low, with her hair loose hanging to\nher waist, but carefully combed and held outspread by what appeared to\nbe a bent piece of ivory about a foot and a half long, to which it was\nfastened by a thread of gold.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"No. Upon her breast was that necklace of red stones with the little\nimage hanging from its centre which those rascals gave her and she\nalways wore.\"\n\n\"Anything more?\"\n\n\"Yes. In her arms she carried what looked like a veiled child. It was so\nstill that I think it must have been dead.\"\n\n\"Well. What happened?\"\n\n\"I was so overcome I could not speak, and she stood gazing at me with\nwide-opened eyes, looking more beautiful than I can tell you. She never\nstirred, and her lips never moved--that I will swear. And yet both of us\nheard her say, very low but quite clearly: 'The mountain, George! Don't\ndesert me. Seek me on the mountain, my dear, my husband.'\"\n\n\"Well, what next?\"\n\n\"I sprang up and she was gone. That's all.\"\n\n\"Now tell me what _you_ saw and heard, Savage.\"\n\n\"What his lordship saw and heard, Mr. Quatermain, neither more nor less.\nExcept that I was awake, having had one of my bad dreams about snakes,\nand saw her come through the door.\"\n\n\"Through the door! Was it open then?\"\n\n\"No, sir, it was shut and bolted. She just came through it as if it\nwasn't there. Then I called to his lordship after she had been looking\nat him for half a minute or so, for I couldn't speak at first. There's\none more thing, or rather two. On her head was a little cap that looked\nas though it had been made from the skin of a bird, with a gold snake\nrising up in front, which snake was the first thing I caught sight of,\nas of course it would be, sir. Also the dress she wore was so thin that\nthrough it I could see her shape and the sandals on her feet, which were\nfastened at the instep with studs of gold.\"\n\n\"I saw no feather cap or snake,\" said Ragnall.\n\n\"Then that's the oddest part of the whole business,\" I remarked. \"Go\nback to your room, both of you, and if you see anything more, call me. I\nwant to think things over.\"\n\nThey went, in a bewildered sort of fashion, and I called Hans and spoke\nwith him in a whisper, repeating to him the little that he had not\nunderstood of our talk, for as I have said, although he never spoke it,\nHans knew a great deal of English.\n\n\"Now, Hans,\" I said to him, \"what is the use of you? You are no better\nthan a fraud. You pretend to be the best watchdog in Africa, and yet\na woman comes into this house under your nose and in the grey of the\nmorning, and you do not see her. Where is your reputation, Hans?\"\n\nThe old fellow grew almost speechless with indignation, then he\nspluttered his answer:\n\n\"It was not a woman, Baas, but a spook. Who am I that I should be\nexpected to catch spooks as though they were thieves or rats? As it\nhappens I was wide awake half an hour before the dawn and lay with my\neyes fixed upon that door, which I bolted myself last night. It never\nopened, Baas; moreover, since this talk began I have been to look at it.\nDuring the night a spider has made its web from door-post to door-post,\nand that web is unbroken. If you do not believe me, come and see for\nyourself. Yet they say the woman came through the doorway and therefore\nthrough the spider's web. Oh! Baas, what is the use of wasting thought\nupon the ways of spooks which, like the wind, come and go as they will,\nespecially in this haunted land from which, as we have all agreed, we\nshould do well to get away.\"\n\nI went and examined the door for myself, for by now my sciatica, or\nwhatever it may have been, was so much better that I could walk a\nlittle. What Hans said was true. There was the spider's web with the\nspider sitting in the middle. Also some of the threads of the web were\nfixed from post to post, so that it was impossible that the door could\nhave been opened or, if opened, that anyone could have passed through\nthe doorway without breaking them. Therefore, unless the woman came\nthrough one of the little window-places, which was almost incredible as\nthey were high above the ground, or dropped from the smoke-hole in the\nroof, or had been shut into the place when the door was closed on the\nprevious night, I could not see how she had arrived there. And if any\none of these incredible suppositions was correct, then how did she get\nout again with two men watching her?\n\nThere were only two solutions to the problem--namely, that the whole\noccurrence was hallucination, or that, in fact, Ragnall and Savage had\nseen something unnatural and uncanny. If the latter were correct I only\nwished that I had shared the experience, as I have always longed to\nsee a ghost. A real, indisputable ghost would be a great support to our\ndoubting minds, that is if we _knew_ its owner to be dead.\n\nBut--this was another thought--if by any chance Lady Ragnall were still\nalive and a prisoner upon that mountain, what they had seen was no\nghost, but a shadow or _simulacrum_ of a living person projected\nconsciously or unconsciously by that person for some unknown purpose.\nWhat could the purpose be? As it chanced the answer was not difficult,\nand to it the words she was reported to have uttered gave a cue. Only a\nfew hours ago, just before we turned in indeed, as I have said, we had\nbeen discussing matters. What I have not said is that in the end we\narrived at the conclusion that our quest here was wild and useless and\nthat we should do well to try to escape from the place before we became\ninvolved in a war of extermination between two branches of an obscure\ntribe, one of which was quite and the other semi-savage.\n\nIndeed, although Ragnall still hung back a little, it had been arranged\nthat I should try to purchase camels in exchange for guns, unless I\ncould get them for nothing which might be less suspicious, and that we\nshould attempt such an escape under cover of an expedition to kill the\nelephant Jana.\n\nSupposing such a vision to be possible, then might it not have come, or\nbeen sent to deter us from this plan? It would seem so.\n\nThus reflecting I went to sleep worn out with useless wonderment, and\ndid not wake again till breakfast time. That morning, when we were alone\ntogether, Ragnall said to me:\n\n\"I have been thinking over what happened, or seemed to happen last\nnight. I am not at all a superstitious man, or one given to vain\nimaginings, but I am sure that Savage and I really did see and hear the\nspirit or the shadow of my wife. Her body it could not have been as you\nwill admit, though how she could utter, or seem to utter, audible speech\nwithout one is more than I can tell. Also I am sure that she is captive\nupon yonder mountain and came to call me to rescue her. Under these\ncircumstances I feel that it is my duty, as well as my desire, to give\nup any idea of leaving the country and try to find out the truth.\"\n\n\"And how will you do that,\" I asked, \"seeing that no one will tell us\nanything?\"\n\n\"By going to see for myself.\"\n\n\"It is impossible, Ragnall. I am too lame at present to walk half a\nmile, much less to climb precipices.\"\n\n\"I know, and that is one of the reasons why I did not suggest that you\nshould accompany me. The other is that there is no object in all of\nus risking our lives. I wished to face the thing alone, but that good\nfellow Savage says that he will go where I go, leaving you and Hans here\nto make further attempts if we do not return. Our plan is to slip out\nof the town during the night, wearing white dresses like the Kendah, of\nwhich I have bought some for tobacco, and make the best of our way up\nthe slope by starlight that is very bright now. When dawn comes we will\ntry to find the road through that precipice, or over it, and for the\nrest trust to Providence.\"\n\nDismayed at this intelligence, I did all I could to dissuade him from\nsuch a mad venture, but quite without avail, for never did I know a more\ndetermined or more fearless man than Lord Ragnall. He had made up\nhis mind and there was an end of the matter. Afterwards I talked with\nSavage, pointing out to him all the perils involved in the attempt, but\nlikewise without avail. He was more depressed than usual, apparently on\nthe ground that \"having seen the ghost of her ladyship\" he was sure he\nhad not long to live. Still, he declared that where his master went he\nwould go, as he preferred to die with him rather than alone.\n\nSo I was obliged to give in and with a melancholy heart to do what I\ncould to help in the simple preparations for this crazy undertaking,\nrealizing all the while that the only real help must come from above,\nsince in such a case man was powerless. I should add that after\nconsultation, Ragnall gave up the idea of adopting a Kendah disguise\nwhich was certain to be discovered, also of starting at night when the\ntown was guarded.\n\nThat very afternoon they went, going out of the town quite openly on the\npretext of shooting partridges and small buck on the lower slopes of\nthe mountain, where both were numerous, as Har\u00fbt had informed us we were\nquite at liberty to do. The farewell was somewhat sad, especially\nwith Savage, who gave me a letter he had written for his old mother in\nEngland, requesting me to post it if ever again I came to a civilized\nland.\n\nI did my best to put a better spirit in him but without avail. He only\nwrung my hand warmly, said that it was a pleasure to have known such a\n\"real gentleman\" as myself, and expressed a hope that I might get out of\nthis hell and live to a green old age amongst Christians. Then he wiped\naway a tear with the cuff of his coat, touched his hat in the orthodox\nfashion and departed. Their outfit, I should add, was very simple: some\nfood in bags, a flask of spirits, two double-barrelled guns that would\nshoot either shot or ball, a bull's-eye lantern, matches and their\npistols.\n\nHans walked with them a little way and, leaving them outside the town,\nreturned.\n\n\"Why do you look so gloomy, Hans?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because, Baas,\" he answered, twiddling his hat, \"I had grown to be fond\nof the white man, Bena, who was always very kind to me and did not treat\nme like dirt as low-born whites are apt to do. Also he cooked well, and\nnow I shall have to do that work which I do not like.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Hans? The man isn't dead, is he?\"\n\n\"No, Baas, but soon he will be, for the shadow of death is in his eyes.\"\n\n\"Then how about Lord Ragnall?\"\n\n\"I saw no shadow in his eyes; I think that he will live, Baas.\"\n\nI tried to get some explanation of these dark sayings out of the\nHottentot, but he would add nothing to his words.\n\nAll the following night I lay awake filled with heavy fears which\ndeepened as the hours went on. Just before dawn we heard a knocking on\nour door and Ragnall's voice whispering to us to open. Hans did so while\nI lit a candle, of which we had a good supply. As it burned up Ragnall\nentered, and from his face I saw at once that something terrible had\nhappened. He went to the jar where we kept our water and drank three\npannikin-fuls, one after the other. Then without waiting to be asked, he\nsaid:\n\n\"Savage is dead,\" and paused a while as though some awful recollection\novercame him. \"Listen,\" he went on presently. \"We worked up the\nhill-side without firing, although we saw plenty of partridges and one\nbuck, till just as twilight was closing in, we came to the cliff face.\nHere we perceived a track that ran to the mouth of a narrow cave\nor tunnel in the lava rock of the precipice, which looked quite\nunclimbable. While we were wondering what to do, eight or ten\nwhite-robed men appeared out of the shadows and seized us before we\ncould make any resistance. After talking together for a little they took\naway our guns and pistols, with which some of them disappeared. Then\ntheir leader, with many bows, indicated that we were at liberty to\nproceed by pointing first to the mouth of the cave, and next to the top\nof the precipice, saying something about '_ingane_,' which I believe\nmeans a little child, does it not?\"\n\nI nodded, and he went on:\n\n\"After this they all departed down the hill, smiling in a fashion that\ndisturbed me. We stood for a while irresolute, until it became quite\ndark. I asked Savage what he thought we had better do, expecting that he\nwould say 'Return to the town.' To my surprise, he answered:\n\n\"'Go on, of course, my lord. Don't let those brutes say that we white\nmen daren't walk a step without our guns. Indeed, in any case I mean to\ngo on, even if your lordship won't.'\n\n\"Whilst he spoke he took a bull's-eye lantern from his foodbag, which\nhad not been interfered with by the Kendah, and lit it. I stared at him\namazed, for the man seemed to be animated by some tremendous purpose.\nOr rather it was as though a force from without had got hold of his will\nand were pushing him on to an unknown end. Indeed his next words showed\nthat this was so, for he exclaimed:\n\n\"'There is something drawing me into that cave, my lord. It may be\ndeath; I think it is death, but whatever it be, go I must. Perhaps you\nwould do well to stop outside till I have seen.'\n\n\"I stepped forward to catch hold of the man, who I thought had gone mad,\nas perhaps was the case. Before I could lay my hands on him he had\nrun rapidly to the mouth of the cave. Of course I followed, but when I\nreached its entrance the star of light thrown forward by the bull's-eye\nlantern showed me that he was already about eight yards down the tunnel.\nThen I heard a terrible hissing noise and Savage exclaiming: 'Oh! my\nGod!' twice over. As he spoke the lantern fell from his hand, but did\nnot go out, because, as you know, it is made to burn in any position.\nI leapt forward and picked it from the ground, and while I was doing so\nbecame aware that Savage was running still farther into the depths of\nthe cave. I lifted the lantern above my head and looked.\n\n\"This was what I saw: About ten paces from me was Savage with his arms\noutstretched and dancing--yes, dancing--first to the right and then to\nthe left, with a kind of horrible grace and to the tune of a hideous\nhissing music. I held the lantern higher and perceived that beyond him,\nlifted eight or nine feet into the air, nearly to the roof of the tunnel\nin fact, was the head of the hugest snake of which I have ever heard. It\nwas as broad as the bottom of a wheelbarrow--were it cut off I think\nit would fill a large wheelbarrow--while the neck upon which it was\nsupported was quite as thick as my middle, and the undulating body\nbehind it, which stretched far away into the darkness, was the size of\nan eighteen-gallon cask and glittered green and grey, lined and splashed\nwith silver and with gold.\n\n\"It hissed and swayed its great head to the right, holding Savage with\ncold eyes that yet seemed to be on fire, whereon he danced to the right.\nIt hissed again and swayed its head to the left, whereon he danced to\nthe left. Then suddenly it reared its head right to the top of the cave\nand so remained for a few seconds, whereon Savage stood still, bending\na little forward, as though he were bowing to the reptile. Next instant,\nlike a flash it struck, for I saw its white fangs bury themselves in\nthe back of Savage, who with a kind of sigh fell forward on to his face.\nThen there was a convulsion of those shining folds, followed by a sound\nas of bones being ground up in a steam-driven mortar.\n\n\"I staggered against the wall of the cave and shut my eyes for a moment,\nfor I felt faint. When I opened them again it was to see something flat,\nmisshapen, elongated like a reflection in a spoon, something that had\nbeen Savage lying on the floor, and stretched out over it the huge\nserpent studying me with its steely eyes. Then I ran; I am not ashamed\nto say I ran out of that horrible hole and far into the night.\"\n\n\"Small blame to you,\" I said, adding: \"Hans, give me some square-face\nneat.\" For I felt as queer as though I also had been in that cave with\nits guardian.\n\n\"There is very little more to tell,\" went on Ragnall after I had drunk\nthe hollands. \"I lost my way on the mountain-side and wandered for many\nhours, till at last I blundered up against one of the outermost houses\nof the town, after which things were easy. Perhaps I should add that\nwherever I went on my way down the mountain it seemed to me that I heard\npeople laughing at me in an unnatural kind of voice. That's all.\"\n\nAfter this we sat silent for a long while, till at length Hans said in\nhis unmoved tone:\n\n\"The light has come, Baas. Shall I blow out the candle, which it is a\npity to waste? Also, does the Baas wish me to cook the breakfast, now\nthat the snake devil is making his off Bena, as I hope to make mine off\nhim before all is done. Snakes are very good to eat, Baas, if you know\nhow to dress them in the Hottentot way.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nHANS STEALS THE KEYS\n\nA few hours later some of the White Kendah arrived at the house and very\npolitely delivered to us Ragnall's and poor Savage's guns and pistols,\nwhich they said they had found lying in the grass on the mountain-side,\nand with them the bull's-eye lantern that Ragnall had thrown away in his\nflight; all of which articles I accepted without comment. That evening\nalso Har\u00fbt called and, after salutations, asked where Bena was as he did\nnot see him. Then my indignation broke out:\n\n\"Oh! white-bearded father of liars,\" I said, \"you know well that he is\nin the belly of the serpent which lives in the cave of the mountain.\"\n\n\"What, Lord!\" exclaimed Har\u00fbt addressing Ragnall in his peculiar\nEnglish, \"have you been for walk up to hole in hill? Suppose Bena want\nsee big snake. He always very fond of snake, you know, and they very\nfond of him. You 'member how they come out of his pocket in your house\nin England? Well, he know all about snake now.\"\n\n\"You villain!\" exclaimed Ragnall, \"you murderer! I have a mind to kill\nyou where you are.\"\n\n\"Why you choke me, Lord, because snake choke your man? Poor snake, he\nonly want dinner. If you go where lion live, lion kill you. If you go\nwhere snake live, snake kill you. I tell you not to. You take no notice.\nNow I tell you all--go if you wish, no one stop you. Perhaps you kill\nsnake, who knows? Only you no take gun there, please. That not allowed.\nWhen you tired of this town, go see snake. Only, 'member that not right\nway to House of Child. There another way which you never find.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Ragnall, \"what is the use of all this foolery? You\nknow very well why we are in your devilish country. It is because I\nbelieve you have stolen my wife to make her the priestess of your evil\nreligion whatever it may be, and I want her back.\"\n\n\"All this great mistake,\" replied Har\u00fbt blandly. \"We no steal beautiful\nlady you marry because we find she not right priestess. Also Macumazana\nhere not to look for lady but to kill elephant Jana and get pay in ivory\nlike good business man. You, Lord, come with him as friend though we no\nask you, that all. Then you try find temple of our god and snake which\nwatch door kill your servant. Why we not kill _you_, eh?\"\n\n\"Because you are afraid to,\" answered Ragnall boldly. \"Kill me if you\ncan and take the consequences. I am ready.\"\n\nHar\u00fbt studied him not without admiration.\n\n\"You very brave man,\" he said, \"and we no wish kill you and p'raps after\nall everything come right in end. Only Child know about that. Also you\nhelp us fight Black Kendah by and by. So, Lord, you quite safe unless\nyou big fool and go call on snake in cave. He very hungry snake and soon\nwant more dinner. You hear, Light-in-Darkness, Lord-of-the-Fire,\" he\nadded suddenly turning on Hans who was squatted near by twiddling his\nhat with a face that for absolute impassiveness resembled a deal board.\n\"You hear, he very hungry snake, and you make nice tea for him.\"\n\nHans rolled his little yellow eyes without even turning his head until\nthey rested on the stately countenance of Har\u00fbt, and answered in Bantu:\n\n\"I hear, Liar-with-the-White-Beard, but what have I to do with this\nmatter? Jana is my enemy who would have killed Macumazana, my master,\nnot your dirty snake. What is the good of this snake of yours? If it\nwere any good, why does it not kill Jana whom you hate? And if it is no\ngood, why do you not take a stick and knock it on the head? If you are\nafraid I will do so for you if you pay me. That for your snake,\" and\nvery energetically he spat upon the floor.\n\n\"All right,\" said Har\u00fbt, still speaking in English, \"you go kill snake.\nGo when you like, no one say no. Then we give you new name. Then we call\nyou Lord-of-the-Snake.\"\n\nAs Hans, who now was engaged in lighting his corn-cob pipe, did not\ndeign to answer these remarks, Har\u00fbt turned to me and said:\n\n\"Lord Macumazana, your leg still bad, eh? Well, I bring you some\nointment what make it quite well; it holy ointment come from the Child.\nWe want you get well quick.\"\n\nThen suddenly he broke into Bantu. \"My Lord, war draws near. The Black\nKendah are gathering all their strength to attack us and we must have\nyour aid. I go down to the River Tava to see to certain matters, as to\nthe reaping of the outlying crops and other things. Within a week I will\nbe back; then we must talk again, for by that time, if you will use the\nointment that I have given you, you will be as well as ever you were\nin your life. Rub it on your leg, and mix a piece as large as a mealie\ngrain in water and swallow it at night. It is not poison, see,\" and\ntaking the cover off a little earthenware pot which he produced he\nscooped from it with his finger some of the contents, which looked like\nlard, put it on his tongue and swallowed it.\n\nThen he rose and departed with his usual bows.\n\nHere I may state that I used Har\u00fbt's prescription with the most\nexcellent results. That night I took a dose in water, very nasty it was,\nand rubbed my leg with the stuff, to find that next morning all pain\nhad left me and that, except for some local weakness, I was practically\nquite well. I kept the rest of the salve for years, and it proved a\nperfect specific in cases of sciatica and rheumatism. Now, alas! it is\nall used and no recipe is available from which it can be made up again.\n\nThe next few days passed uneventfully. As soon as I could walk I began\nto go about the town, which was nothing but a scattered village much\nresembling those to be seen on the eastern coasts of Africa. Nearly\nall the men seemed to be away, making preparations for the harvest, I\nsuppose, and as the women shut themselves up in their houses after the\nOriental fashion, though the few that I saw about were unveiled and\nrather good-looking, I did not gather any intelligence worth noting.\n\nTo tell the truth I cannot remember being in a more uninteresting place\nthan this little town with its extremely uncommunicative population\nwhich, it seemed to me, lived under a shadow of fear that prevented all\ngaiety. Even the children, of whom there were not many, crept about in\na depressed fashion and talked in a low voice. I never saw any of them\nplaying games or heard them shouting and laughing, as young people do\nin most parts of the world. For the rest we were very well looked after.\nPlenty of food was provided for us and every thought taken for our\ncomfort. Thus a strong and quiet pony was brought for me to ride because\nof my lameness. I had only to go out of the house and call and it\narrived from somewhere, all ready saddled and bridled, in charge of a\nlad who appeared to be dumb. At any rate when I spoke to him he would\nnot answer.\n\nMounted on this pony I took one or two rides along the southern slopes\nof the mountain on the old pretext of shooting for the pot. Hans\naccompanied me on these occasions, but was, I noted, very silent and\nthoughtful, as though he were hunting something up and down his tortuous\nintelligence. Once we got quite near to the mouth of the cave or tunnel\nwhere poor Savage had met his horrid end. As we stood studying it a\nwhite-robed man whose head was shaved, which made me think he must be\na priest, came up and asked me mockingly why we did not go through the\ntunnel and see what lay beyond, adding, almost in the words of Har\u00fbt\nhimself, that none would attempt to interfere with us as the road was\nopen to any who could travel it. By way of answer I only smiled and\nput him a few questions about a very beautiful breed of goats with long\nsilky hair, some of which he seemed to be engaged in herding. He replied\nthat these goats were sacred, being the food of \"one who dwelt in the\nMountain who only ate when the moon changed.\"\n\nWhen I inquired who this person was he said with his unpleasant\nsmile that I had better go through the tunnel and see for myself, an\ninvitation which I did not accept.\n\nThat evening Har\u00fbt appeared unexpectedly, looking very grave and\ntroubled. He was in a great hurry and only stayed long enough to\ncongratulate me upon the excellent effects of his ointment, since \"no\nman could fight Jana on one leg.\"\n\nI asked him when the fight with Jana was to come off. He replied:\n\n\"Lord, I go up to the Mountain to attend the Feast of the First-fruits,\nwhich is held at sunrise on the day of the new moon. After the offering\nthe Oracle will speak and we shall learn when there will be war with\nJana, and perchance other things.\"\n\n\"May we not attend this feast, Har\u00fbt, who are weary of doing nothing\nhere?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" he answered with his grave bow. \"That is, if you come\nunarmed; for to appear before the Child with arms is death. You know the\nroad; it runs through yonder cave and the forest beyond the cave. Take\nit when you will, Lord.\"\n\n\"Then if we can pass the cave we shall be welcome at the feast?\"\n\n\"You will be very welcome. None shall hurt you there, going or\nreturning. I swear it by the Child. Oh! Macumazana,\" he added, smiling\na little, \"why do you talk folly, who know well that one lives in yonder\ncave whom none may look upon and love, as Bena learned not long ago? You\nare thinking that perhaps you might kill this Dweller in the cave with\nyour weapons. Put away that dream, seeing that henceforth those who\nwatch you have orders to see that none of you leave this house carrying\nso much as a knife. Indeed, unless you promise me that this shall be so\nyou will not be suffered to set foot outside its garden until I return\nagain. Now do you promise?\"\n\nI thought a while and, drawing the two others aside out of hearing,\nasked them their opinion.\n\nRagnall was at first unwilling to give any such promise, but Hans said:\n\n\"Baas, it is better to go free and unhurt without guns and knives than\nto become a prisoner once, as you were among the Black Kendah. Often\nthere is but a short step between the prison and the grave.\"\n\nBoth Ragnall and I acknowledged the force of this argument and in the\nend we gave the promise, speaking one by one.\n\n\"It is enough,\" said Har\u00fbt; \"moreover, know, Lord, that among us White\nKendah he who breaks an oath is put across the River Tava unarmed to\nmake report thereof to Jana, Father of Lies. Now farewell. If we do\nnot meet at the Feast of the First-fruits on the day of the new moon,\nwhither once more I invite you, we can talk together here after I have\nheard the voice of the Oracle.\"\n\nThen he mounted a camel which awaited him outside the gate and departed\nwith an escort of twelve men, also riding camels.\n\n\"There is some other road up that mountain, Quatermain,\" said Ragnall.\n\"A camel could sooner pass through the eye of a needle than through that\ndreadful cave, even if it were empty.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" I answered, \"but as we don't know where it is and I dare say\nit lies miles from here, we need not trouble our heads on the matter.\nThe cave is _our_ only road, which means that there is _no_ road.\"\n\nThat evening at supper we discovered that Hans was missing; also that he\nhad got possession of my keys and broken into a box containing liquor,\nfor there it stood open in the cooking-hut with the keys in the lock.\n\n\"He has gone on the drink,\" I said to Ragnall, \"and upon my soul I don't\nwonder at it; for sixpence I would follow his example.\"\n\nThen we went to bed. Next morning we breakfasted rather late, since when\none has nothing to do there is no object in getting up early. As I was\npreparing to go to the cook-house to boil some eggs, to our astonishment\nHans appeared with a kettle of coffee.\n\n\"Hans,\" I said, \"you are a thief.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas,\" answered Hans.\n\n\"You have been at the gin box and taking that poison.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, I have been taking poison. Also I took a walk and all is\nright now. The Baas must not be angry, for it is very dull doing nothing\nhere. Will the Baases eat porridge as well as eggs?\"\n\nAs it was no use scolding him I said that we would. Moreover, there was\nsomething about his manner which made me suspicious, for really he did\nnot look like a person who has just been very drunk.\n\nAfter we had finished breakfast he came and squatted down before me.\nHaving lit his pipe he asked suddenly:\n\n\"Would the Baases like to walk through that cave to-night? If so, there\nwill be no trouble.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, suspecting that he was still drunk.\n\n\"I mean, Baas, that the Dweller-in-the-cave is fast asleep.\"\n\n\"How do you know that, Hans?\"\n\n\"Because I am the nurse who put him to sleep, Baas, though he kicked\nand cried a great deal. He is asleep; he will wake no more. Baas, I have\nkilled the Father of Serpents.\"\n\n\"Hans,\" I said, \"now I am sure that you are still drunk, although you do\nnot show it outside.\"\n\n\"Hans,\" added Ragnall, to whom I had translated as much of this as he\ndid not understand, \"it is too early in the day to tell good stories.\nHow could you possibly have killed that serpent without a gun--for you\ntook none with you--or with it either for that matter?\"\n\n\"Will the Baases come and take a walk through the cave?\" asked Hans with\na snigger.\n\n\"Not till I am quite sure that you are sober,\" I replied; then,\nremembering certain other events in this worthy's career, added; \"Hans,\nif you do not tell us the story at once I will beat you.\"\n\n\"There isn't much story, Baas,\" replied Hans between long sucks at his\npipe, which had nearly gone out, \"because the thing was so easy. The\nBaas is very clever and so is the Lord Baas, why then can they never\nsee the stones that lie under their noses? It is because their eyes are\nalways fixed upon the mountains between this world and the next. But\nthe poor Hottentot, who looks at the ground to be sure that he does not\nstumble, ah! he sees the stones. Now, Baas, did you not hear that man\nin a night shirt with his head shaved say that those goats were food for\nOne who dwelt in the mountain?\"\n\n\"I did. What of it, Hans?\"\n\n\"Who would be the One who dwelt in the mountain except the Father of\nSnakes in the cave, Baas? Ah, now for the first time you see the stone\nthat lay at your feet all the while. And, Baas, did not the bald man add\nthat this One in the mountain was only fed at new and full moon, and is\nnot to-morrow the day of new moon, and therefore would he not be very\nhungry on the day before new moon, that is, last night?\"\n\n\"No doubt, Hans; but how can you kill a snake by feeding it?\"\n\n\"Oh! Baas, you may eat things that make you ill, and so can a snake. Now\nyou will guess the rest, so I had better go to wash the dishes.\"\n\n\"Whether I guess or do not guess,\" I replied sagely, the latter being\nthe right hypothesis, \"the dishes can wait, Hans, since the Lord there\nhas not guessed; so continue.\"\n\n\"Very well, Baas. In one of those boxes are some pounds of stuff which,\nwhen mixed with water, is used for preserving skins and skulls.\"\n\n\"You mean the arsenic crystals,\" I said with a flash of inspiration.\n\n\"I don't know what you call them, Baas. At first I thought they were\nhard sugar and stole some once, when the real sugar was left behind, to\nput into the coffee--without telling the Baas, because it was my fault\nthat the sugar was left behind.\"\n\n\"Great Heavens!\" I ejaculated, \"then why aren't we all dead?\"\n\n\"Because at the last moment, Baas, I thought I would make sure, so I put\nsome of the hard sugar into hot milk and, when it had melted, I gave it\nto that yellow dog which once bit me in the leg, the one that came from\nBeza-Town, Baas, that I told you had run away. He was a very greedy dog,\nBaas, and drank up the milk at once. Then he gave a howl, twisted about,\nfoamed at the mouth and died and I buried him at once. After that I\nthrew some more of the large sugar mixed with mealies to the fowls that\nwe brought with us for cooking. Two cocks and a hen swallowed them\nby mistake for the corn. Presently they fell on their backs, kicked a\nlittle and died. Some of the Mazitu, who were great thieves, stole those\ndead fowls, Baas. After this, Baas, I thought it best not to use that\nsugar in the coffee, and later on Bena told me that it was deadly\npoison. Well, Baas, it came into my mind that if I could make that great\nsnake swallow enough of this poison, he, too, might die.\n\n\"So I stole your keys, as I often do, Baas, when I want anything,\nbecause you leave them lying about everywhere, and to deceive you first\nopened one of the boxes that are full of square-face and brandy and left\nit open, for I wished you to think that I had just gone to get drunk\nlike anybody else. Then I opened another box and got out two one-pound\ntins of the sugar which kills dogs and fowls. Half a pound of it I\nmelted in boiling water with some real sugar to make the stuff sweet,\nand put it into a bottle. The rest I tied with string in twelve little\npackets in the soft paper which is in one of the boxes, and put them in\nmy pocket. Then I went up the hill, Baas, to the place where I saw those\ngoats are kraaled at night behind a reed fence. As I had hoped, no one\nwas watching them because there are no tigers so near this town, and\nman does not steal the goats that are sacred. I went into the kraal and\nfound a fat young ewe which had a kid. I dragged it out and, taking it\nbehind some stones, I made its leg fast with a bit of cord and poured\nthis stuff out of the bottle all over its skin, rubbing it in well.\nThen I tied the twelve packets of hard poison-sugar everywhere about its\nbody, making them very fast deep in the long hair so that they could not\ntumble or rub off.\n\n\"After this I untied the goat, led it near to the mouth of the cave and\nheld it there for a time while it kept on bleating for its kid. Next I\ntook it almost up to the cave, wondering how I should drive it in, for I\ndid not wish to enter there myself, Baas. As it happened I need not have\ntroubled about that. When the goat was within five yards of the cave, it\nstopped bleating, stood still and shivered. Then it began to go forward\nwith little jumps, as though it did not want to go, yet must do so.\nAlso, Baas, I felt as though _I_ wished to go with it. So I lay down and\nput my heels against a rock, leaving go of the goat.\n\n\"For now, Baas, I did not care where that goat went so long as I could\nkeep out of the hole where dwelt the Father of Serpents that had eaten\nBena. But it was all right, Baas; the goat knew what it had to do and\ndid it, jumping straight into the cave. As it entered it turned its head\nand looked at me. I could see its eyes in the starlight, and, Baas, they\nwere dreadful. I think it knew what was coming and did not like it at\nall. And yet it had to walk on because it could not help it. Just like a\nman going to the devil, Baas!\n\n\"Holding on to the stone I peered after it, for I had heard something\nstirring in the cave making a soft noise like a white lady's dress upon\nthe floor. There in the blackness I saw two little sparks of fire, which\nwere the eyes of the serpent, Baas. Then I heard a sound of hissing like\nfour big kettles boiling all at once, and a little bleat from the goat.\nAfter this there was a noise as of men wrestling, followed by another\nnoise as of bones breaking, and lastly, yet another sucking noise as of\na pump that won't draw up the water. Then everything grew nice and quiet\nand I went some way off, sat down a little to one side of the cave, and\nwaited to see if anything happened.\n\n\"It must have been nearly an hour later that something did begin to\nhappen, Baas. It was as though sacks filled with chaff were being beaten\nagainst stone walls there in the cave. Ah! thought I to myself, your\nstomach is beginning to ache, Eater-up-of-Bena, and, as that goat had\nlittle horns on its head--to which I tied two of the bags of the poison,\nBaas--and, like all snakes, no doubt you have spikes in your throat\npointing downwards, you won't be able to get it up again. Then--I\nexpect this was after the poison-sugar had begun to melt nicely in the\nserpent's stomach, Baas--there was a noise as though a whole company of\ngirls were dancing a war-dance in the cave to a music of hisses.\n\n\"And then--oh! then, Baas, of a sudden that Father of Serpents came out.\nI tell you, Baas, that when I saw him in the bright starlight my hair\nstood up upon my head, for never has there been such another snake in\nthe whole world. Those that live in trees and eat bucks in Zululand, of\nwhose skins men make waistcoats and slippers, are but babies compared\nto this one. He came out, yard after yard of him. He wriggled about, he\nstood upon his tail with his head where the top of a tree might be, he\nmade himself into a ring, he bit at stones and at his own stomach, while\nI hid behind my rock praying to your reverend father that he might not\nsee me. Then at last he rushed away down the hill, faster than any horse\ncould gallop.\n\n\"Now I hoped that he had gone for good and thought of going myself.\nStill I feared to do so lest I should meet him somewhere, so I made up\nmy mind to wait till daylight. It was as well, Baas, for about half an\nhour later he came back again. Only now he could not jump, he could only\ncrawl. Never in my life did I see a snake look so sick, Baas. Into the\ncave he went and lay there hissing. By degrees the hissing grew very\nfaint, till at length they died away altogether. I waited another\nhalf-hour, Baas, and then I grew so curious that I thought that I would\ngo to look in the cave.\n\n\"I lit the little lantern I had with me and, holding it in one hand and\nmy stick in the other, I crept into the hole. Before I had crawled ten\npaces I saw something white stretched along the ground. It was the belly\nof the great snake, Baas, which lay upon its back quite dead.\n\n\"I know that it was dead, for I lit three wax matches, setting them to\nburn upon its tail and it never stirred, as any live snake will do when\nit feels fire. Then I came home, Baas, feeling very proud because I\nhad outwitted that great-grandfather of all snakes who killed Bena my\nfriend, and had made the way clear for us to walk through the cave.\n\n\"That is all the story, Baas. Now I must go to wash those dishes,\" and\nwithout waiting for any comment off he went, leaving us marvelling at\nhis wit, resource and courage.\n\n\"What next?\" I asked presently.\n\n\"Nothing till to-night,\" answered Ragnall with determination, \"when I am\ngoing to look at the snake which the noble Hans has killed and whatever\nlies beyond the cave, as you will remember Har\u00fbt invited us to do\nunmolested, if we could.\"\n\n\"Do you think Har\u00fbt will keep his word, Ragnall?\"\n\n\"On the whole, yes, and if he doesn't I don't care. Anything is better\nthan sitting here in this suspense.\"\n\n\"I agree as to Har\u00fbt, because we are too valuable to be killed just now,\nif for no other reason; also as to the suspense, which is unendurable.\nTherefore I will walk with you to look at that snake, Ragnall, and so no\ndoubt will Hans. The exercise will do my leg good.\"\n\n\"Do you think it wise?\" he asked doubtfully; \"in your case, I mean.\"\n\n\"I think it most unwise that we should separate any more. We had better\nstand or fall altogether; further, we do not seem to have any luck\napart.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE SANCTUARY AND THE OATH\n\nThat evening shortly after sundown the three of us started boldly from\nour house wearing over our clothes the Kendah dresses which Ragnall had\nbought, and carrying nothing save sticks in our hands, some food and\nthe lantern in our pockets. On the outskirts of the town we were met by\ncertain Kendah, one of whom I knew, for I had often ridden by his side\non our march across the desert.\n\n\"Have any of you arms upon you, Lord Macumazana?\" he asked, looking\ncuriously at us and our white robes.\n\n\"None,\" I answered. \"Search us if you will.\"\n\n\"Your word is sufficient,\" he replied with the grave courtesy of his\npeople. \"If you are unarmed we have orders to let you go where you wish\nhowever you may be dressed. Yet, Lord,\" he whispered to me, \"I pray you\ndo not enter the cave, since One lives there who strikes and does not\nmiss, One whose kiss is death. I pray it for your own sakes, also for\nours who need you.\"\n\n\"We shall not wake him who sleeps in the cave,\" I answered\nenigmatically, as we departed rejoicing, for now we had learned that the\nKendah did not yet know of the death of the serpent.\n\nAn hour's walk up the hill, guided by Hans, brought us to the mouth of\nthe tunnel. To tell the truth I could have wished it had been longer,\nfor as we drew near all sorts of doubts assailed me. What if Hans really\nhad been drinking and invented this story to account for his absence?\nWhat if the snake had recovered from a merely temporary indisposition?\nWhat if it had a wife and family living in that cave, every one of them\nthirsting for vengeance?\n\nWell, it was too late to hesitate now, but secretly I hoped that one\nof the others would prefer to lead the way. We reached the place and\nlistened. It was silent as a tomb. Then that brave fellow Hans lit the\nlantern and said:\n\n\"Do you stop here, Baases, while I go to look. If you hear anything\nhappen to me, you will have time to run away,\" words that made me feel\nsomewhat ashamed of myself.\n\nHowever, knowing that he was quick as a weasel and silent as a cat,\nwe let him go. A minute or two later suddenly he reappeared out of the\ndarkness, for he had turned the metal shield over the bull's-eye of the\nlantern, and even in that light I could see that he was grinning.\n\n\"It is all right, Baas,\" he said. \"The Father of Serpents has really\ngone to that land whither he sent Bena, where no doubt he is now\nroasting in the fires of hell, and I don't see any others. Come and look\nat him.\"\n\nSo in we went and there, true enough, upon the floor of the cave lay the\nhuge reptile stone dead and already much swollen. I don't know how long\nit was, for part of its body was twisted into coils, so I will only say\nthat it was by far the most enormous snake that I have ever seen. It is\ntrue that I have heard of such reptiles in different parts of\nAfrica, but hitherto I had always put them down as fabulous creatures\ntransformed into and worshipped as local gods. Also this particular\nspecimen was, I presume, of a new variety, since, according to Ragnall,\nit both struck like the cobra or the adder, and crushed like the\nboa-constrictor. It is possible, however, that he was mistaken on this\npoint; I do not know, since I had no time, or indeed inclination, to\nexamine its head for the poison fangs, and when next I passed that way\nit was gone.\n\nI shall never forget the stench of that cave. It was horrible, which is\nnot to be wondered at seeing that probably this creature had dwelt there\nfor centuries, since these large snakes are said to be as long lived as\ntortoises, and, being sacred, of course it had never lacked for food.\nEverywhere lay piles of cast bones, amongst one of which I noticed\nfragments of a human skull, perhaps that of poor Savage. Also the\nprojecting rocks in the place were covered with great pieces of snake\nskin, doubtless rubbed off by the reptile when once a year it changed\nits coat.\n\nFor a while we gazed at the loathsome and still glittering creature,\nthen pushed on fearful lest we should stumble upon more of its kind.\nI suppose that it must have been solitary, a kind of serpent rogue,\nas Jana was an elephant rogue, for we met none and, if the information\nwhich I obtained afterwards may be believed, there was no species at\nall resembling it in the country. What its origin may have been I never\nlearned. All the Kendah could or would say about it was that it had\nlived in this hole from the beginning and that Black Kendah prisoners,\nor malefactors, were sometimes given to it to kill, as White Kendah\nprisoners were given to Jana.\n\nThe cave itself proved to be not very long, perhaps one hundred and\nfifty feet, no more. It was not an artificial but a natural hollow in\nthe lava rock, which I suppose had once been blown through it by an\noutburst of steam. Towards the farther end it narrowed so much that I\nbegan to fear there might be no exit. In this I was mistaken, however,\nfor at its termination we found a hole just large enough for a man to\nwalk in upright and so difficult to climb through that it became clear\nto us that certainly this was not the path by which the White Kendah\napproached their sanctuary.\n\nScrambling out of this aperture with thankfulness, we found ourselves\nupon the slope of a kind of huge ditch of lava which ran first downwards\nfor about eighty paces, then up again to the base of the great cone of\nthe inner mountain which was covered with dense forest.\n\nI presume that the whole formation of this peculiar hill was the result\nof a violent volcanic action in the early ages of the earth. But as I do\nnot understand such matters I will not dilate upon them further than to\nsay that, although comparatively small, it bore a certain resemblance\nto other extinct volcanoes which I had met with in different parts of\nAfrica.\n\nWe climbed down to the bottom of the ditch that from its general\nappearance might have been dug out by some giant race as a protection to\ntheir stronghold, and up its farther side to where the forest began on\ndeep and fertile soil. Why there should have been rich earth here and\nnone in the ditch is more than we could guess, but perhaps the presence\nof springs of water in this part of the mount may have been a cause. At\nany rate it was so.\n\nThe trees in this forest were huge and of a variety of cedar, but did\nnot grow closely together; also there was practically no undergrowth,\nperhaps for the reason that their dense, spreading tops shut out the\nlight. As I saw afterwards both trunks and boughs were clothed with\nlong grey moss, which even at midday gave the place a very ghostly\nappearance. The darkness beneath those trees was intense, literally we\ncould not see an inch before our faces. Yet rather than stand still we\nstruggled on, Hans leading the way, for his instincts were quicker than\nours. The steep rise of the ground beneath our feet told us that we were\ngoing uphill, as we wished to do, and from time to time I consulted a\npocket compass I carried by the light of a match, knowing from previous\nobservations that the top of the Holy Mount lay due north.\n\nThus for hour after hour we crept up and on, occasionally butting into\nthe trunk of a tree or stumbling over a fallen bough, but meeting with\nno other adventures or obstacles of a physical kind. Of moral, or rather\nmental, obstacles there were many, since to all of us the atmosphere\nof this forest was as that of a haunted house. It may have been the\nembracing darkness, or the sough of the night wind amongst the boughs\nand mosses, or the sense of the imminent dangers that we had passed and\nthat still awaited us. Or it may have been unknown horrors connected\nwith this place of which some spiritual essence still survived, for\nwithout doubt localities preserve such influences, which can be felt by\nthe sensitive among living things, especially in favouring conditions of\nfear and gloom. At any rate I never experienced more subtle and yet more\npenetrating terrors than I did upon that night, and afterwards Ragnall\nconfessed to me that my case was his own. Black as it was I thought that\nI saw apparitions, among them glaring eyes and that of the elephant\nJana standing in front of me with his trunk raised against the bole of a\ncedar. I could have sworn that I saw him, nor was I reassured when Hans\nwhispered to me below his breath, for here we did not seem to dare to\nraise our voices:\n\n\"Look, Baas. Is it Jana glowing like hot iron who stands yonder?\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" I answered. \"How can Jana be here and, if he were\nhere, how could we see him in the night?\" But as I said the words I\nremembered Har\u00fbt had told us that Jana had been met with on the Holy\nMount \"in the spirit or in the flesh.\" However this may be, next instant\nhe was gone and we beheld him or his shadow no more. Also we thought\nthat from time to time we heard voices speaking all around us, now here,\nnow there and now in the tree tops above our heads, though what they\nsaid we could not catch or understand.\n\nThus the long night wore away. Our progress was very slow, but guided by\noccasional glimpses at the compass we never stopped but twice, once\nwhen we found ourselves apparently surrounded by tree boles and fallen\nboughs, and once when we got into swampy ground. Then we took the risk\nof lighting the lantern, and by its aid picked our way through these\ndifficult places. By degrees the trees grew fewer so that we could see\nthe stars between their tops. This was a help to us as I knew that one\nof them, which I had carefully noted, shone at this season of the year\ndirectly over the cone of the mountain, and we were enabled to steer\nthereby.\n\nIt must have been not more than half an hour before the dawn that Hans,\nwho was leading--we were pushing our way through thick bushes at the\ntime--halted hurriedly, saying:\n\n\"Stop, Baas, we are on the edge of a cliff. When I thrust my stick\nforward it stands on nothing.\"\n\nNeedless to say we pulled up dead and so remained without stirring\nan inch, for who could say what might be beyond us? Ragnall wished to\nexamine the ground with the lantern. I was about to consent, though\ndoubtfully, when suddenly I heard voices murmuring and through the\nscreen of bushes saw lights moving at a little distance, forty feet or\nmore below us. Then we gave up all idea of making further use of the\nlantern and crouched still as mice in our bushes, waiting for the dawn.\n\nIt came at last. In the east appeared a faint pearly flush that by\ndegrees spread itself over the whole arch of the sky and was welcomed\nby the barking of monkeys and the call of birds in the depths of the\ndew-steeped forest. Next a ray from the unrisen sun, a single spear\nof light shot suddenly across the sky, and as it appeared, from the\ndarkness below us arose a sound of chanting, very low and sweet to hear.\nIt died away and for a little while there was silence broken only by\na rustling sound like to that of people taking their seats in a dark\ntheatre. Then a woman began to sing in a beautiful, contralto voice,\nbut in what language I do not know, for I could not catch the words, if\nthese were words and not only musical notes.\n\nI felt Ragnall trembling beside me and in a whisper asked him what was\nthe matter. He answered, also in a whisper:\n\n\"I believe that is my wife's voice.\"\n\n\"If so, I beg you to control yourself,\" I replied.\n\nNow the skies began to flame and the light to pour itself into a misty\nhollow beneath us like streams of many-coloured gems into a bowl,\ndriving away the shadows. By degrees these vanished; by degrees we saw\neverything. Beneath us was an amphitheatre, on the southern wall of\nwhich we were seated, though it was not a wall but a lava cliff between\nforty and fifty feet high which served as a wall. The amphitheatre\nitself, however, almost exactly resembled those of the ancients which\nI had seen in pictures and Ragnall had visited in Italy, Greece, and\nSouthern France. It was oval in shape and not very large, perhaps the\nflat space at the bottom may have covered something over an acre, but\nall round this oval ran tiers of seats cut in the lava of the crater.\nFor without doubt this was the crater of an extinct volcano.\n\nMoreover, in what I will call the arena, stood a temple that in its main\noutlines, although small, exactly resembled those still to be seen in\nEgypt. There was the gateway or pylon; there the open outer court with\ncolumns round it supporting roofed cloisters, which, as we ascertained\nafterwards, were used as dwelling-places by the priests. There beyond\nand connected with the first by a short passage was a second rather\nsmaller court, also open to the sky, and beyond this again, built like\nall the rest of the temple of lava blocks, a roofed erection measuring\nabout twelve feet square, which I guessed at once must be the sanctuary.\n\nThis temple was, as I have said, small, but extremely well proportioned,\nevery detail of it being in the most excellent taste though unornamented\nby sculpture or painting. I have to add that in front of the sanctuary\ndoor stood a large block of lava, which I concluded was an altar, and in\nfront of this a stone seat and a basin, also of stone, supported upon a\nvery low tripod. Further, behind the sanctuary was a square house with\nwindow-places.\n\nAt the moment of our first sight of this place the courts were empty,\nbut on the benches of the amphitheatre were seated about three hundred\npersons, male and female, the men to the north and the women to the\nsouth. They were all clad in pure white robes, the heads of the men\nbeing shaved and those of the women veiled, but leaving the face\nexposed. Lastly, there were two roadways into the amphitheatre, one\nrunning east and one west through tunnels hollowed in the encircling\nrock of the crater, both of which roads were closed at the mouths of the\ntunnels by massive wooden double doors, seventeen or eighteen feet\nin height. From these roadways and their doors we learned two things.\nFirst, that the cave where had lived the Father of Serpents was, as I\nhad suspected, not the real approach to the shrine of the Child, but\nonly a blind; and, secondly, that the ceremony we were about to witness\nwas secret and might only be attended by the priestly class or families\nof this strange tribe.\n\nScarcely was it full daylight when from the cells of the cloisters\nround the outer court issued twelve priests headed by Har\u00fbt himself, who\nlooked very dignified in his white garment, each of whom carried on a\nwooden platter ears of different kinds of corn. Then from the cells of\nthe southern cloister issued twelve women, or rather girls, for all were\nyoung and very comely, who ranged themselves alongside of the men. These\nalso carried wooden platters, and on them blooming flowers.\n\nAt a sign they struck up a religious chant and began to walk forward\nthrough the passage that led from the first court to the second.\nArriving in front of the altar they halted and one by one, first a\npriest and then a priestess, set down the platters of offerings, piling\nthem above each other into a cone. Next the priests and the priestesses\nranged themselves in lines on either side of the altar, and Har\u00fbt took\na platter of corn and a platter of flowers in his hands. These he held\nfirst towards that quarter of the sky in which swam the invisible new\nmoon, secondly towards the rising sun, and thirdly towards the doors of\nthe sanctuary, making genuflexions and uttering some chanted prayer, the\nwords of which we could not hear.\n\nA pause followed, that was succeeded by a sudden outburst of song\nwherein all the audience took part. It was a very sonorous and beautiful\nsong or hymn in some language which I did not understand, divided into\nfour verses, the end of each verse being marked by the bowing of every\none of those many singers towards the east, towards the west, and\nfinally towards the altar.\n\nAnother pause till suddenly the doors of the sanctuary were thrown wide\nand from between them issued--the goddess Isis of the Egyptians as I\nhave seen her in pictures! She was wrapped in closely clinging draperies\nof material so thin that the whiteness of her body could be seen\nbeneath. Her hair was outspread before her, and she wore a head-dress\nor bonnet of glittering feathers from the front of which rose a little\ngolden snake. In her arms she bore what at that distance seemed to be\na naked child. With her came two women, walking a little behind her\nand supporting her arms, who also wore feather bonnets but without the\ngolden snake, and were clad in tight-fitting, transparent garments.\n\n\"My God!\" whispered Ragnall, \"it is my wife!\"\n\n\"Then be silent and thank Him that she is alive and well,\" I answered.\n\nThe goddess Isis, or the English lady--in that excitement I did not\nreck which--stood still while the priests and priestesses and all the\naudience, who, gathered on the upper benches of the amphitheatre, could\nsee her above the wall of the inner court, raised a thrice-repeated and\ntriumphant cry of welcome. Then Har\u00fbt and the first priestess lifted\nrespectively an ear of corn and a flower from the two topmost platters\nand held these first to the lips of the child in her arms and secondly\nto her lips.\n\nThis ceremony concluded, the two attendant women led her round the altar\nto the stone chair, upon which she seated herself. Next fire was kindled\nin the bowl on the tripod in front of the chair, how I could not see;\nbut perhaps it was already smouldering there. At any rate it burnt up\nin a thin blue flame, on to which Har\u00fbt and the head priestess threw\nsomething that caused the flame to turn to smoke. Then Isis, for I\nprefer to call her so while describing this ceremony, was caused to bend\nher head forward, so that it was enveloped in the smoke exactly as she\nand I had done some years before in the drawing-room at Ragnall Castle.\nPresently the smoke died away and the two attendants with the feathered\nhead-dresses straightened her in the chair where she sat still holding\nthe babe against her breast as she might have done to nurse it, but with\nher head bent forward like that of a person in a swoon.\n\nNow Har\u00fbt stepped forward and appeared to speak to the goddess at some\nlength, then fell back again and waited, till in the midst of an intense\nsilence she rose from her seat and, fixing her wide eyes on the heavens,\nspoke in her turn, for although we heard nothing of what she said, in\nthat clear, morning light we could see her lips moving. For some minutes\nshe spoke, then sat down again upon the chair and remained motionless,\nstaring straight in front of her. Har\u00fbt advanced again, this time to\nthe front of the altar, and, taking his stand upon a kind of stone step,\naddressed the priests and priestesses and all the encircling audience in\na voice so loud and clear that I could distinguish and understand every\nword he said.\n\n\"The Guardian of the heavenly Child, the Nurse decreed, the appointed\nNurturer, She who is the shadow of her that bore the Child, She who in\nher day bears the symbol of the Child and is consecrated to its service\nfrom of old, She whose heart is filled with the wisdom of the Child and\nwho utters the decrees of Heaven, has spoken. Hearken now to the voice\nof the Oracle uttered in answer to the questions of me, Har\u00fbt, the head\npriest of the Eternal Child during my life-days. Thus says the Oracle,\nthe Guardian, the Nurturer, marked like all who went before her with\nthe holy mark of the new moon. She on whom the spirit, flitting from\ngeneration to generation, has alighted for a while. 'O people of the\nWhite Kendah, worshippers of the Child in this land and descendants of\nthose who for thousands of years worshipped the Child in a more\nancient land until the barbarians drove it thence with the remnant that\nremained. War is upon you, O people of the White Kendah. Jana the evil\none; he whose other name is Set, he whose other name is Satan, he who\nfor this while lives in the shape of an elephant, he who is worshipped\nby the thousands whom once you conquered, and whom still you bridle by\nmy might, comes up against you. The Darkness wars against the Daylight,\nthe Evil wars against the Good. My curse has fallen upon the people of\nJana, my hail has smitten them, their corn and their cattle; they have\nno food to eat. But they are still strong for war and there is food in\nyour land. They come to take your corn; Jana comes to trample your god.\nThe Evil comes to destroy the Good, the Night to Devour the Day. It is\nthe last of many battles. How shall you conquer, O People of the Child?\nNot by your own strength, for you are few in number and Jana is very\nstrong. Not by the strength of the Child, for the Child grows weak and\nold, the days of its dominion are almost done, and its worship is almost\noutworn. Here alone that worship lingers, but new gods, who are still\nthe old gods, press on to take its place and to lead it to its rest.'\n\n\"How then shall you conquer that, when the Child has departed to its own\nplace, a remnant of you may still remain? In one way only--so says\nthe Guardian, the Nurturer of the Child speaking with the voice of the\nChild; by the help of those whom you have summoned to your aid from far.\nThere were four of them, but one you have suffered to be slain in\nthe maw of the Watcher in the cave. It was an evil deed, O sons and\ndaughters of the Child, for as the Watcher is now dead, so ere long\nmany of you who planned this deed must die who, had it not been for that\nman's blood, would have lived on a while. Why did you do this thing?\nThat you might keep a secret, the secret of the theft of a woman, that\nyou might continue to act a lie which falls upon your head like a stone\nfrom heaven.\n\n\"Thus saith the Child: 'Lift no hand against the three who remain, and\nwhat they shall ask, that give, for thus alone shall some of you be\nsaved from Jana and those who serve him, even though the Guardian and\nthe Child be taken away and the Child itself returned to its own\nplace.' These are the words of the Oracle uttered at the Feast of the\nFirst-fruits, the words that cannot be changed and mayhap its last.\"\n\n\nHar\u00fbt ceased, and there was silence while this portentous message sank\ninto the minds of his audience. At length they seemed to understand its\nominous nature and from them all there arose a universal, simultaneous\ngroan. As it died away the two attendants dressed as goddesses assisted\nthe personification of the Lady Isis to rise from her seat and, opening\nthe robes upon her breast, pointed to something beneath her throat,\ndoubtless that birthmark shaped like the new moon which made her so\nsacred in their eyes since she who bore it and she alone could fill her\nholy office.\n\nAll the audience and with them the priests and priestesses bowed before\nher. She lifted the symbol of the Child, holding it high above her head,\nwhereon once more they bowed with the deepest veneration. Then still\nholding the effigy aloft, she turned and with her two attendants passed\ninto the sanctuary and doubtless thence by a covered way into the house\nbeyond. At any rate we saw her no more.\n\n\n\nAs soon as she was gone the congregation, if I may call it so, leaving\ntheir seats, swarmed down into the outer court of the temple through\nits eastern gate, which was now opened. Here the priests proceeded to\ndistribute among them the offerings taken from the altar, giving a grain\nof corn to each of the men to eat and a flower to each of the women,\nwhich flower she kissed and hid in the bosom of her robe. Evidently it\nwas a kind of sacrament.\n\nRagnall lifted himself a little upon his hands and knees, and I saw that\nhis eyes glowed and his face was very pale.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Demand that those people give me back my wife, whom they have stolen.\nDon't try to stop me, Quatermain, I mean what I say.\"\n\n\"But, but,\" I stammered, \"they never will and we are but three unarmed\nmen.\"\n\nHans lifted up his little yellow face between us.\n\n\"Baas,\" he hissed, \"I have a thought. The Lord Baas wishes to get the\nlady dressed like a bird as to her head and like one for burial as to\nher body, who is, he says, his wife. But for us to take her from among\nso many is impossible. Now what did that old witch-doctor Har\u00fbt declare\njust now? He declared, speaking for his fetish, that by our help alone\nthe White Kendah can resist the hosts of the Black Kendah and that no\nharm must be done to us if the White Kendah would continue to live. So\nit seems, Baas, that we have something to sell which the White Kendah\nmust buy, namely our help against the Black Kendah, for if we will not\nfight for them, they believe that they cannot conquer their enemies and\nkill the devil Jana. Well now, supposing that the Baas says that our\nprice is the white woman dressed like a bird, to be delivered over to us\nwhen we have defeated the Black Kendah and killed Jana--after which they\nwill have no more use for her. And supposing that the Baas says that if\nthey refuse to pay that price we will burn all our powder and cartridges\nso that the rifles are no use? Is there not a path to walk on here?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I answered. \"Something of the sort was working in my mind but\nI had no time to think it out.\"\n\nTurning, I explained the idea to Ragnall, adding:\n\n\"I pray you not to be rash. If you are, not only may we be killed, which\ndoes not so much matter, but it is very probable that even if they spare\nus they will put an end to your wife rather than suffer one whom they\nlook upon as holy and who is necessary to their faith in its last\nstruggle to be separated from her charge of the Child.\"\n\nThis was a fortunate argument of mine and one which went home.\n\n\"To lose her now would be more than I could bear,\" he muttered.\n\n\"Then will you promise to let me try to manage this affair and not to\ninterfere with me and show violence?\"\n\nHe hesitated a moment and answered:\n\n\"Yes, I promise, for you two are cleverer than I am and--I cannot trust\nmy judgment.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said, assuming an air of confidence which I did not feel. \"Now\nwe will go down to call upon Har\u00fbt and his friends. I want to have a\ncloser look at that temple.\"\n\nSo behind our screen of bushes we wriggled back a little distance till\nwe knew that the slope of the ground would hide us when we stood up.\nThen as quickly as we could we made our way eastwards for something over\na quarter of a mile and after this turned to the north. As I expected,\nbeyond the ring of the crater we found ourselves on the rising,\ntree-clad bosom of the mountain and, threading our path through the\ncedars, came presently to that track or roadway which led to the eastern\ngate of the amphitheatre. This road we followed unseen until presently\nthe gateway appeared before us. We walked through it without attracting\nany attention, perhaps because all the people were either talking\ntogether, or praying, or perhaps because like themselves we were wrapped\nin white robes. At the mouth of the tunnel we stopped and I called out\nin a loud voice:\n\n\"The white lords and their servant have come to visit Har\u00fbt, as he\ninvited them to do. Bring us, we pray you, into the presence of Har\u00fbt.\"\n\nEveryone wheeled round and stared at us standing there in the shadow of\nthe gateway tunnel, for the sun behind us was still low. My word, how\nthey did stare! A voice cried:\n\n\"Kill them! Kill these strangers who desecrate our temple.\"\n\n\"What!\" I answered. \"Would you kill those to whom your high-priest has\ngiven safe-conduct; those moreover by whose help alone, as your Oracle\nhas just declared, you can hope to slay Jana and destroy his hosts?\"\n\n\"How do they know that?\" shouted another voice. \"They are magicians!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I remarked, \"all magic does not dwell in the hearts of the White\nKendah. If you doubt it, go to look at the Watcher in the Cave whom your\nOracle told you is dead. You will find that it did not lie.\"\n\nAs I spoke a man rushed through the gates, his white rob streaming on\nthe wind, shouting as he emerged from the tunnel:\n\n\"O Priests and Priestesses of the Child, the ancient serpent is dead. I\nwhose office it is to feed the serpent on the day of the new moon have\nfound him dead in his house.\"\n\n\"You hear,\" I interpolated calmly. \"The Father of Snakes is dead. If you\nwant to know how, I will tell you. We looked on it and it died.\"\n\nThey might have answered that poor Savage also looked on it with the\nresult that _he_ died, but luckily it did not occur to them to do so.\nOn the contrary, they just stood still and stared at us like a flock of\nstartled sheep.\n\nPresently the sheep parted and the shepherd in the shape of Har\u00fbt\nappeared looking, I reflected, the very picture of Abraham softened by\na touch of the melancholia of Job, that is, as I have always imagined\nthose patriarchs. He bowed to us with his usual Oriental courtesy, and\nwe bowed back to him. Hans' bow, I may explain, was of the most peculiar\nnature, more like a _skulpat_, as the Boers call a land-tortoise,\ndrawing its wrinkled head into its shell and putting it out again than\nanything else. Then Har\u00fbt remarked in his peculiar English, which I\nsuppose the White Kendah took for some tongue known only to magicians:\n\n\"So you get here, eh? Why you get here, how the devil you get here, eh?\"\n\n\"We got here because you asked us to do so if we could,\" I answered,\n\"and we thought it rude not to accept your invitation. For the rest, we\ncame through a cave where you kept a tame snake, an ugly-looking reptile\nbut very harmless to those who know how to deal with snakes and are not\nafraid of them as poor Bena was. If you can spare the skin I should like\nto have it to make myself a robe.\"\n\nHar\u00fbt looked at me with evident respect, muttering:\n\n\"Oh, Macumazana, you what you English call cool, quite cool! Is that\nall?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered. \"Although you did not happen to notice us, we have\nbeen present at your church service, and heard and seen everything. For\ninstance, we saw the wife of the lord here whom you stole away in Egypt,\nher that, being a liar, Har\u00fbt, you swore you never stole. Also we heard\nher words after you had made her drunk with your tobacco smoke.\"\n\nNow for once in his life Har\u00fbt was, in sporting parlance, knocked out.\nHe looked at us, then turning quite pale, lifted his eyes to heaven and\nrocked upon his feet as though he were about to fall.\n\n\"How you do it? How you do it, eh?\" he queried in a weak voice.\n\n\"Never you mind how we did it, my friend,\" I answered loftily. \"What\nwe want to know is when you are going to hand over that lady to her\nhusband.\"\n\n\"Not possible,\" he answered, recovering some of his tone. \"First we kill\nyou, first we kill her, she Nurse of the Child. While Child there, she\nstop there till she die.\"\n\n\"See here,\" broke in Ragnall. \"Either you give me my wife or someone\nelse will die. You will die, Har\u00fbt. I am a stronger man than you are\nand unless you promise to give me my wife I will kill you now with this\nstick and my hands. Do not move or call out if you want to live.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" answered the old man with some dignity, \"I know you can kill me,\nand if you kill me, I think I say thank you who no wish to live in so\nmuch trouble. But what good that, since in one minute then you die too,\nall of you, and lady she stop here till Black Kendah king take her to\nwife or she too die?\"\n\n\"Let us talk,\" I broke in, treading warningly upon Ragnall's foot. \"We\nhave heard your Oracle and we know that you believe its words. It is\nsaid that we alone can help you to conquer the Black Kendah. If you will\nnot promise what we ask, we will not help you. We will burn our powder\nand melt our lead, so that the guns we have cannot speak with Jana and\nwith Simba, and after that we will do other things that I need not tell\nyou. But if you promise what we ask, then we will fight for you against\nJana and Simba and teach your men to use the fifty rifles which we have\nhere with us, and by our help you shall conquer. Do you understand?\"\n\nHe nodded and stroking his long beard, asked:\n\n\"What you want us promise, eh?\"\n\n\"We want you to promise that after Jana is dead and the Black Kendah\nare driven away, you will give up to us unharmed that lady whom you have\nstolen. Also that you will bring her and us safely out of your country\nby the roads you know, and meanwhile that you will let this lord see his\nwife.\"\n\n\"Not last, no,\" replied Har\u00fbt, \"that not possible. That bring us all to\ngrave. Also no good, 'cause her mind empty. For rest, you come to other\nplace, sit down and eat while I talk with priests. Be afraid nothing;\nyou quite safe.\"\n\n\"Why should we be afraid? It is you who should be afraid, you who stole\nthe lady and brought Bena to his death. Do you not remember the words of\nyour own Oracle, Har\u00fbt?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know words, but how _you_ know them _that_ I not know,\" he\nreplied.\n\nThen he issued some orders, as a result of which a guard formed itself\nabout us and conducted us through the crowd and along the passage to the\nsecond court of the temple, which was now empty. Here the guard left us\nbut remained at the mouth of the passage, keeping watch. Presently women\nbrought us food and drink, of which Hans and I partook heartily though\nRagnall, who was so near to his lost wife and yet so far away, could eat\nbut little. Mingled joy because after these months of arduous search he\nfound her yet alive, and fear lest she should again be taken from him\nfor ever, deprived him of all appetite.\n\nWhile we ate, priests to the number of about a dozen, who I suppose had\nbeen summoned by Har\u00fbt, were admitted by the guard and, gathering out of\nearshot of us between the altar and the sanctuary, entered on an earnest\ndiscussion with him. Watching their faces I could see that there was a\nstrong difference of opinion between them, about half taking one view\non the matter of which they disputed, and half another. At length Har\u00fbt\nmade some proposition to which they all agreed. Then the door of the\nsanctuary was opened with a strange sort of key which one of the priests\nproduced, showing a dark interior in which gleamed a white object, I\nsuppose the statue of the Child. Har\u00fbt and two others entered, the door\nbeing closed behind them. About five minutes later they appeared again\nand others, who listened earnestly and after renewed consultation\nsignified assent by holding up the right hand. Now one of the priests\nwalked to where we were and, bowing, begged us to advance to the altar.\nThis we did, and were stood in a line in front of it, Hans being set in\nthe middle place, while the priests ranged themselves on either side.\nNext Har\u00fbt, having once more opened the door of the sanctuary, took his\nstand a little to the right of it and addressed us, not in English but\nin his own language, pausing at the end of each sentence that I might\ntranslate to Ragnall.\n\n\"Lords Macumazana and Igeza, and yellow man who is named\nLight-in-Darkness,\" he said, \"we, the head priests of the Child,\nspeaking on behalf of the White Kendah people with full authority so to\ndo, have taken counsel together and of the wisdom of the Child as to the\ndemands which you make of us. Those demands are: First, that after you\nhave killed Jana and defeated the Black Kendah we should give over to\nyou the white lady who was born in a far land to fill the office of\nGuardian of the Child, as is shown by the mark of the new moon upon\nher breast, but who, because for the second time we could not take her,\nbecame the wife of you, the Lord Igeza. Secondly, that we should conduct\nyou and her safely out of our land to some place whence you can return\nto your own country. Both of these things we will do, because we know\nfrom of old that if once Jana is dead we shall have no cause to fear the\nBlack Kendah any more, since we believe that then they will leave their\nhome and go elsewhere, and therefore that we shall no longer need an\nOracle to declare to us in what way Heaven will protect us from Jana and\nfrom them. Or if another Oracle should become necessary to us, doubtless\nin due season she will be found. Also we admit that we stole away this\nlady because we must, although she was the wife of one of you. But if we\nswear this, you on your part must also swear that you will stay with us\ntill the end of the war, making our cause your cause and, if need be,\ngiving your lives for us in battle. You must swear further that none of\nyou will attempt to see or to take hence that lady who is named Guardian\nof the Child until we hand her over to you unharmed. If you will not\nswear these things, then since no blood may be shed in this holy place,\nhere we will ring you round until you die of hunger and of thirst, or if\nyou escape from this temple, then we will fall upon you and put you to\ndeath and fight our own battle with Jana as best we may.\"\n\n\"And if we make these promises how are we to know that you will keep\nyours?\" I interrupted.\n\n\"Because the oath that we shall give you will be the oath of the Child\nthat may not be broken.\"\n\n\"Then give it,\" I said, for although I did not altogether like the\nsecurity, obviously it was the best to be had.\n\nSo very solemnly they laid their right hands upon the altar and \"in the\npresence of the Child and the name of the Child and of all the White\nKendah people,\" repeated after Har\u00fbt a most solemn oath of which I\nhave already given the substance. It called down on their heads a very\ndreadful doom in this world and the next, should it be broken either in\nthe spirit or the letter; the said oath, however, to be only binding if\nwe, on our part, swore to observe their terms and kept our engagement\nalso in the spirit and the letter.\n\nThen they asked us to fulfil our share of the pact and very\nconsiderately drew out of hearing while we discussed the matter; Har\u00fbt,\nthe only one of them who understood a word of English, retiring behind\nthe sanctuary. At first I had difficulties with Ragnall, who was most\nunwilling to bind himself in any way. In the end, on my pointing out\nthat nothing less than our lives were involved and probably that of his\nwife as well, also that no other course was open to us, he gave way, to\nmy great relief.\n\nHans announced himself ready to swear anything, adding blandly that\nwords mattered nothing, as afterwards we could do whatever seemed best\nin our own interests, whereon I read him a short moral lecture on the\nheinousness of perjury, which did not seem to impress him very much.\n\nThis matter settled, we called back the priests and informed them of our\ndecision. Har\u00fbt demanded that we should affirm it \"by the Child,\" which\nwe declined to do, saying that it was our custom to swear only in the\nname of our own God. Being a liberal-minded man who had travelled, Har\u00fbt\ngave way on the point. So I swore first to the effect that I would fight\nfor the White Kendah to the finish in consideration of the promises that\nthey had made to us. I added that I would not attempt either to see or\nto interfere with the lady here known as the Guardian of the Child until\nthe war was over or even to bring our existence to her knowledge, ending\nup, \"so help me God,\" as I had done several times when giving evidence\nin a court of law.\n\nNext Ragnall with a great effort repeated my oath in English, Har\u00fbt\nlistening carefully to every word and once or twice asking me to explain\nthe exact meaning of some of them.\n\nLastly Hans, who seemed very bored with the whole affair, swore, also\nrepeating the words after me and finishing on his own account with\n\"so help me the reverend Predikant, the Baas's father,\" a form that he\nutterly declined to vary although it involved more explanations. When\npressed, indeed, he showed considerable ingenuity by pointing out to\nthe priests that to his mind my poor father stood in exactly the same\nrelation to the Power above us as their Oracle did to the Child. He\noffered generously, however, to throw in the spirits of his grandfather\nand grandmother and some extraordinary divinity they worshipped, I think\nit was a hare, as an additional guarantee of good faith. This proposal\nthe priests accepted gravely, whereon Hans whispered into my ear in\nDutch:\n\n\"Those fools do not remember that when pressed by dogs the hare often\ndoubles on its own spoor, and that your reverend father will be very\npleased if I can play them the same trick with the white lady that they\nplayed with the Lord Igeza.\"\n\nI only looked at him in reply, since the morality of Hans was past\nargument. It might perhaps be summed up in one sentence: To get the\nbetter of his neighbour in his master's service, honestly if possible;\nif not, by any means that came to his hand down to that of murder. At\nthe bottom of his dark and mysterious heart Hans worshipped only one\ngod, named Love, not of woman or child, but of my humble self. His\nprinciples were those of a rather sly but very high-class and exclusive\ndog, neither better nor worse. Still, when all is said and done, there\nare lower creatures in the world than high-class dogs. At least so\nthe masters whom they adore are apt to think, especially if their\nwatchfulness and courage have often saved them from death or disaster.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE EMBASSY\n\nThe ceremonies were over and the priests, with the exception of Har\u00fbt\nand two who remained to attend upon him, vanished, probably to inform\nthe male and female hierophants of their result, and through these the\nwhole people of the White Kendah. Old Har\u00fbt stared at us for a little\nwhile, then said in English, which he always liked to talk when Ragnall\nwas present, perhaps for the sake of practice:\n\n\"What you like do now, eh? P'r'aps wish fly back to Town of Child, for\nsuppose this how you come. If so, please take me with you, because that\nsave long ride.\"\n\n\"Oh! no,\" I answered. \"We walked here through that hole where lived the\nFather of Snakes who died of fear when he saw us, and just mixed with\nthe rest of you in the court of the temple.\"\n\n\"Good lie,\" said Har\u00fbt admiringly, \"very first-class lie! Wonder how\nyou kill great snake, which we all think never die, for he live there\nhundred, hundred years; our people find him there when first they come\nto this country, and make him kind of god. Well, he nasty beast and best\ndead. I say, you like see Child? If so, come, for you our brothers now,\nonly please take off hat and not speak.\"\n\nI intimated that we should \"like see Child,\" and led by Har\u00fbt we entered\nthe little sanctuary which was barely large enough to hold all of us.\nIn a niche of the end wall stood the sacred effigy which Ragnall and I\nexamined with a kind of reverent interest. It proved to be the statue of\nan infant about two feet high, cut, I imagine, from the base of a single\nbut very large elephant's tusk, so ancient that the yellowish ivory had\nbecome rotten and was covered with a multitude of tiny fissures. Indeed,\nfor its appearance I made up my mind that several thousands of years\nmust have passed since the beast died from which this ivory was taken,\nespecially as it had, I presume, always been carefully preserved under\ncover.\n\nThe workmanship of the object was excellent, that of a fine artist who,\nI should think, had taken some living infant for his model, perhaps a\nchild of the Pharaoh of the day. Here I may say at once that there could\nbe no doubt of its Egyptian origin, since on one side of the head was a\nsingle lock of hair, while the fourth finger of the right hand was\nheld before the lips as though to enjoin silence. Both of these\npeculiarities, it will be remembered, are characteristic of the infant\nHorus, the child of Osiris and Isis, as portrayed in bronzes and temple\ncarvings. So at least Ragnall, who recently had studied many such\neffigies in Egypt, informed me later. There was nothing else in the\nplace except an ancient, string-seated chair of ebony, adorned with\ninlaid ivory patterns; an effigy of a snake in porcelain, showing that\nserpent worship was in some way mixed up with their religion; and two\nrolls of papyrus, at least that is what they looked like, which were\nlaid in the niche with the statue. These rolls, to my disappointment,\nHar\u00fbt refused to allow us to examine or even to touch.\n\nAfter we had left the sanctuary I asked Har\u00fbt when this figure was\nbrought to their land. He replied that it came when they came, at what\ndate he could not tell us as it was so long ago, and that with it came\nthe worship and the ceremonies of their religion.\n\nIn answer to further questions he added that this figure, which seemed\nto be of ivory, contained the spirits which ruled the sun and the moon,\nand through them the world. This, said Ragnall, was just a piece of\nEgyptian theology, preserved down to our own times in a remote corner\nof Africa, doubtless by descendants of dwellers on the Nile who had been\ndriven thence in some national catastrophe, and brought away with them\ntheir faith and one of the effigies of their gods. Perhaps they fled at\nthe time of the Persian invasion by Cambyses.\n\nAfter we had emerged from this deeply interesting shrine, which was\nlocked behind us, Har\u00fbt led us, not through the passage connecting it\nwith the stone house that we knew was occupied by Ragnall's wife in her\ncapacity as Guardian of the Child, or a latter-day personification of\nIsis, Lady of the Moon, at which house he cast many longing glances, but\nback through the two courts and the pylon to the gateway of the temple.\nHere on the road by which we had entered the place, a fact which we did\nnot mention to him, he paused and addressed us.\n\n\"Lords,\" he said, \"now you and the People of the White Kendah are one;\nyour ends are their ends, your fate is their fate, their secrets are\nyour secrets. You, Lord Igeza, work for a reward, namely the person of\nthat lady whom we took from you on the Nile.\"\n\n\"How did you do that?\" interrupted Ragnall when I had interpreted.\n\n\"Lord, we watched you. We knew when you came to Egypt; we followed you\nin Egypt, whither we had journeyed on our road to England once more to\nseek our Oracles, till the day of our opportunity dawned. Then at night\nwe called her and she obeyed the call, as she must do whose mind we have\ntaken away--ask me not how--and brought her to dwell with us, she who\nis marked from her birth with the holy sign and wears upon her breast\ncertain charmed stones and a symbol that for thousands of years have\nadorned the body of the Child and those of its Oracles. Do you remember\na company of Arabs whom you saw riding on the banks of the Great River\non the day before the night when she was lost to you? We were with that\ncompany and on our camels we bore her thence, happy and unharmed to this\nour land, as I trust, when all is done, we shall bear her back again and\nyou with her.\"\n\n\"I trust so also, for you have wrought me a great wrong,\" said Ragnall\nbriefly, \"perhaps a greater wrong than I know at present, for how came\nit that my boy was killed by an elephant?\"\n\n\"Ask that question of Jana and not of me,\" Har\u00fbt answered darkly. Then\nhe went on: \"You also, Lord Macumazana, work for a reward, the countless\nstore of ivory which your eyes have beheld lying in the burial place of\nelephants beyond the Tava River. When you have slain Jana who watches\nthe store, and defeated the Black Kendah who serve him, it is yours and\nwe will give you camels to bear it, or some of it, for all cannot be\ncarried, to the sea where it can be taken away in ships. As for the\nyellow man, I think that he seeks no reward who soon will inherit all\nthings.\"\n\n\"The old witch-doctor means that I am going to die,\" remarked Hans\nexpectorating reflectively. \"Well, Baas, I am quite ready, if only Jana\nand certain others die first. Indeed I grow too old to fight and travel\nas I used to do, and therefore shall be glad to pass to some land where\nI become young again.\"\n\n\"Stuff and rubbish!\" I exclaimed, then turned and listened to Har\u00fbt who,\nnot understanding our Dutch conversation, was speaking once more.\n\n\"Lords,\" he said, \"these paths which run east and west are the real\napproach to the mountain top and the temple, not that which, as I\nsuppose, led you through the cave of the old serpent. The road to\nthe west, which wanders round the base of the hill to a pass in those\ndistant mountains and thence across the deserts to the north, is so easy\nto stop that by it we need fear no attack. With this eastern road the\ncase is, however, different, as I shall now show you, if you will ride\nwith me.\"\n\nThen he gave some orders to two attendant priests who departed at a run\nand presently reappeared at the head of a small train of camels which\nhad been hidden, I know not where. We mounted and, following the road\nacross a flat piece of ground, found that not more than half a mile away\nwas another precipitous ridge of rock which had presumably once formed\nthe lip of an outer crater. This ridge, however, was broken away for a\nwidth of two or three hundred yards, perhaps by some outrush of lava,\nthe road running through the centre of the gap on which schanzes had\nbeen built here and there for purposes of defence. Looking at these I\nsaw that they were very old and inefficient and asked when they had been\nerected. Har\u00fbt replied about a century before when the last war took\nplace with the Black Kendah, who had been finally driven off at this\nspot, for then the White Kendah were more numerous than at present.\n\n\"So Simba knows this road?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, Lord, and Jana knows it also, for he fought in that war and still\nat times visits us here and kills any whom he may meet. Only to the\ntemple he has never dared to come.\"\n\nNow I wondered whether we had really seen Jana in the forest on the\nprevious night, but coming to the conclusion that it was useless to\ninvestigate the matter, made no inquiries, especially as these would\nhave revealed to Har\u00fbt the route by which we approached the temple. Only\nI pointed out to him that proper defences should be put up here without\ndelay, that is if they meant to make a stronghold of the mountain.\n\n\"We do, Lord,\" he answered, \"since we are not strong enough to attack\nthe Black Kendah in their own country or to meet them in pitched battle\non the plain. Here and in no other place must be fought the last fight\nbetween Jana and the Child. Therefore it will be your task to build\nwalls cunningly, so that when they come we may defeat Jana and the hosts\nof the Black Kendah.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that this elephant will accompany Simba and his soldiers,\nHar\u00fbt?\"\n\n\"Without doubt, Lord, since he has always done so from the beginning.\nJana is tame to the king and certain priests of the Black Kendah, whose\nforefathers have fed him for generations, and will obey their orders.\nAlso he can think for himself, being an evil spirit and invulnerable.\"\n\n\"His left eye and the tip of his trunk are not invulnerable,\" I\nremarked, \"though from what I saw of him I should say there is no doubt\nabout his being able to think for himself. Well, I am glad the brute is\ncoming as I have an account to settle with him.\"\n\n\"As he, Lord, who does not forget, has an account to settle with you and\nyour servant, Light-in-Darkness,\" commented Har\u00fbt in an unpleasant and\nsuggestive tone.\n\nThen after we had taken a few measurements and Ragnall, who understands\nsuch matters, had drawn a rough sketch of the place in his pocket-book\nto serve as data for our proposed scheme of fortifications, we pursued\nour journey back to the town, where we had left all our stores and there\nwere many things to be arranged. It proved to be quite a long ride, down\nthe eastern slope of the mountain which was easy to negotiate, although\nlike the rest of this strange hill it was covered with dense cedar\nforests that also seemed to me to have defensive possibilities. Reaching\nits foot at length we were obliged to make a detour by certain winding\npaths to avoid ground that was too rough for the camels, so that in the\nend we did not come to our own house in the Town of the Child till about\nmidday.\n\nGlad enough were we to reach it, since all three of us were tired out\nwith our terrible night journey and the anxious emotions that we had\nundergone. Indeed, after we had eaten we lay down and I rejoiced to\nsee that, notwithstanding the state of mental excitement into which the\ndiscovery of his wife had plunged him, Ragnall was the first of us to\nfall asleep.\n\nAbout five o'clock we were awakened by a messenger from Har\u00fbt,\nwho requested our attendance on important business at a kind of\nmeeting-house which stood at a little distance on an open place where\nthe White Kendah bartered produce. Here we found Har\u00fbt and about twenty\nof the headmen seated in the shade of a thatched roof, while behind\nthem, at a respectful distance, stood quite a hundred of the White\nKendah. Most of these, however, were women and children, for as I have\nsaid the greater part of the male population was absent from the town\nbecause of the commencement of the harvest.\n\nWe were conducted to chairs, or rather stools of honour, and when we two\nhad seated ourselves, Hans taking his stand behind us, Har\u00fbt rose and\ninformed us that an embassy had arrived from the Black Kendah which was\nabout to be admitted.\n\nPresently they came, five of them, great, truculent-looking fellows of\na surprising blackness, unarmed, for they had not been allowed to bring\ntheir weapons in to the town, but adorned with the usual silver chains\nacross their breasts to show their rank, and other savage finery. In the\nman who was their leader I recognized one of those messengers who had\naccosted us when first we entered their territory on our way from the\nsouth, before that fight in which I was taken prisoner. Stepping forward\nand addressing himself to Har\u00fbt, he said:\n\n\"A while ago, O Prophet of the Child, I, the messenger of the god Jana,\nspeaking through the mouth of Simba the King, gave to you and your\nbrother Mar\u00fbt a certain warning to which you did not listen. Now Jana\nhas Mar\u00fbt, and again I come to warn you, Har\u00fbt.\"\n\n\"If I remember right,\" interrupted Har\u00fbt blandly, \"I think that on that\noccasion two of you delivered the message and that the Child marked one\nof you upon the brow. If Jana has my brother, say, where is yours?\"\n\n\"We warned you,\" went on the messenger, \"and you cursed us in the name\nof the Child.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" interrupted Har\u00fbt again, \"we cursed you with three curses. The\nfirst was the curse of Heaven by storm or drought, which has fallen upon\nyou. The second was the curse of famine, which is falling upon you; and\nthe third was the curse of war, which is yet to fall on you.\"\n\n\"It is of war that we come to speak,\" replied the messenger,\ndiplomatically avoiding the other two topics which perhaps he found it\nawkward to discuss.\n\n\"That is foolish of you,\" replied the bland Har\u00fbt, \"seeing that the\nother day you matched yourselves against us with but small success. Many\nof you were killed but only a very few of us, and the white lord whom\nyou took captive escaped out of your hands and from the tusks of Jana\nwho, I think, now lacks an eye. If he is a god, how comes it that he\nlacks an eye and could not kill an unarmed white man?\"\n\n\"Let Jana answer for himself, as he will do ere long, O Har\u00fbt.\nMeanwhile, these are the words of Jana spoken through the mouth of Simba\nthe King: The Child has destroyed my harvest and therefore I demand this\nof the people of the Child--that they give me three-fourths of their\nharvest, reaping the same and delivering it on the south bank of the\nRiver Tava. That they give me the two white lords to be sacrificed to\nme. That they give the white lady who is Guardian of the Child to be a\nwife of Simba the King, and with her a hundred virgins of your people.\nThat the image of the Child be brought to the god Jana in the presence\nof his priests and Simba the King. These are the demands of Jana spoken\nthrough the mouth of Simba the King.\"\n\nWatching, I saw a thrill of horror shake the forms of Har\u00fbt and of\nall those with him as the full meaning of these, to them, most impious\nrequests sank into their minds. But he only asked very quietly:\n\n\"And if we refuse the demands, what then?\"\n\n\"Then,\" shouted the messenger insolently, \"then Jana declares war upon\nyou, the last war of all, war till every one of your men be dead and the\nChild you worship is burnt to grey ashes with fire. War till your women\nare taken as slaves and the corn which you refuse is stored in our grain\npits and your land is a waste and your name forgotten. Already the hosts\nof Jana are gathered and the trumpet of Jana calls them to the fight.\nTo-morrow or the next day they advance upon you, and ere the moon is\nfull not one of you will be left to look upon her.\"\n\nHar\u00fbt rose, and walking from under the shed, turned his back upon the\nenvoys and stared at the distant line of great mountains which stood out\nfar away against the sky. Out of curiosity I followed him and observed\nthat these mountains were no longer visible. Where they had been was\nnothing but a line of black and heavy cloud. After looking for a while\nhe returned and addressing the envoys, said quite casually:\n\n\"If you will be advised by me, friends, you will ride hard for the\nriver. There is such rain upon the mountains as I have never seen\nbefore, and you will be fortunate if you cross it before the flood comes\ndown, the greatest flood that has happened in our day.\"\n\nThis intelligence seemed to disturb the messengers, for they too stepped\nout of the shed and stared at the mountains, muttering to each other\nsomething that I could not understand. Then they returned and with a\nfine appearance of indifference demanded an immediate answer to their\nchallenge.\n\n\"Can you not guess it?\" answered Har\u00fbt. Then changing his tone he drew\nhimself to his full height and thundered out at them: \"Get you back\nto your evil spirit of a god that hides in the shape of a beast of the\nforest and to his slave who calls himself a king, and say to them: 'Thus\nspeaks the Child to his rebellious servants, the Black Kendah dogs: Swim\nmy river when you can, which will not be yet, and come up against me\nwhen you will; for whenever you come I shall be ready for you. You are\nalready dead, O Jana. You are already dead, O Simba the slave. You are\nscattered and lost, O dogs of the Black Kendah, and the home of such\nof you as remain shall be far away in a barren land, where you must dig\ndeep for water and live upon the wild game because there little corn\nwill grow.' Now begone, and swiftly, lest you stop here for ever.\"\n\nSo they turned and went, leaving me full of admiration for the\nhistrionic powers of Har\u00fbt.\n\nI must add, however, that being without doubt a keen observer of the\nweather conditions of the neighbourhood, he was quite right about\nthe rain upon the mountains, which by the way never extended to the\nterritory of the People of the Child. As we heard afterwards, the flood\ncame down just as the envoys reached the river; indeed, one of them was\ndrowned in attempting its crossing, and for fourteen days after this it\nremained impassable to an army.\n\n\n\nThat very evening we began our preparations to meet an attack which was\nnow inevitable. Putting aside the supposed rival powers of the tribal\ndivinities worshipped under the names of the Child and Jana, which,\nwhile they added a kind of Homeric interest to the contest, could, we\nfelt, scarcely affect an issue that must be decided with cold steel\nand other mortal weapons, the position of the White Kendah was serious\nindeed. As I think I have said, in all they did not number more than\nabout two thousand men between the ages of twenty and fifty-five, or,\nincluding lads between fourteen and twenty and old men still able-bodied\nbetween fifty-five and seventy, say two thousand seven hundred capable\nof some sort of martial service. To these might be added something under\ntwo thousand women, since among this dwindling folk, oddly enough, from\ncauses that I never ascertained, the males out-numbered the females,\nwhich accounted for their marriage customs that were, by comparison with\nthose of most African peoples, monogamous. At any rate only the\nrich among them had more than one wife, while the poor or otherwise\nineligible often had none at all, since inter-marriage with other races\nand above all with the Black Kendah dwelling beyond the river was so\nstrictly taboo that it was punishable with death or expulsion.\n\nAgainst this little band the Black Kendah could bring up twenty thousand\nmen, besides boys and aged persons who with the women would probably\nbe left to defend their own country, that is, not less than ten to one.\nMoreover, all of these enemies would be fighting with the courage of\ndespair, since quite three-fourths of their crops with many of their\ncattle and sheep had been destroyed by the terrific hail-burst that\nI have described. Therefore, since no other corn was available in the\nsurrounding land, where they dwelt alone encircled by deserts, either\nthey must capture that of the White Kendah, or suffer terribly from\nstarvation until a year later when another harvest ripened.\n\nThe only points I could see in favour of the People of the Child\nwere that they would fight on the vantage ground of their mountain\nstronghold, a formidable position if properly defended. Also they would\nhave the benefit of the skill and knowledge of Ragnall and myself.\nLastly, the enemy must face our rifles. Neither the White nor the\nBlack Kendah, I should say, possessed any guns, except a few antiquated\nflintlock weapons that the former had captured from some nomadic tribe\nand kept as curiosities. Why this was the case I do not know, since\nundoubtedly at times the White Kendah traded in camels and corn with\nArabs who wandered as far as the Sudan, or Egypt, nomadic tribes to whom\neven then firearms were known, although perhaps rarely used by them. But\nso it was, possibly because of some old law or prejudice which forbade\ntheir introduction into the country, or mayhap of the difficulty of\nprocuring powder and lead, or for the reason that they had none to teach\nthem the use of such new-fangled weapons.\n\nNow it will be remembered that, on the chance of their proving useful,\nRagnall, in addition to our own sporting rifles, had brought with him to\nAfrica fifty Snider rifles with an ample supply of ammunition, the same\nthat I had trouble in passing through the Customs at Durban, all of\nwhich had arrived safely at the Town of the Child. Clearly our first\nduty was to make the best possible use of this invaluable store. To\nthat end I asked Har\u00fbt to select seventy-five of the boldest and most\nintelligent young men among his people, and to hand them over to me and\nHans for instruction in musketry. We had only fifty rifles but I drilled\nseventy-five men, or fifty per cent. more, that some might be ready to\nreplace any who fell.\n\nFrom dawn to dark each day Hans and I worked at trying to convert\nthese Kendah into sharpshooters. It was no easy task with men, however\nwilling, who till then had never held a gun, especially as I must be\nvery sparing of the ammunition necessary to practice, of which of course\nour supply was limited. Still we taught them how to take cover, how to\nfire and to cease from firing at a word of command, also to hold the\nrifles low and waste no shot. To make marksmen of them was more than I\ncould hope to do under the circumstances.\n\nWith the exception of these men nearly the entire male population\nwere working day and night to get in the harvest. This proved a very\ndifficult business, both because some of the crops were scarcely fit and\nbecause all the grain had to be carried on camels to be stored in and at\nthe back of the second court of the temple, the only place where it was\nlikely to be safe. Indeed in the end a great deal was left unreaped.\nThen the herds of cattle and breeding camels which grazed on the farther\nsides of the Holy Mount must be brought into places of safety, glens in\nthe forest on its slope, and forage stacked to feed them. Also it was\nnecessary to provide scouts to keep watch along the river.\n\nLastly, the fortifications in the mountain pass required unceasing\nlabour and attention. This was the task of Ragnall, who fortunately in\nhis youth, before he succeeded unexpectedly to the title, was for\nsome years an officer in the Royal Engineers and therefore thoroughly\nunderstood that business. Indeed he understood it rather too well, since\nthe result of his somewhat complicated and scientific scheme of defence\nwas a little confusing to the simple native mind. However, with the\nassistance of all the priests and of all the women and children who\nwere not engaged in provisioning the Mount, he built wall after wall and\nredoubt after redoubt, if that is the right word, to say nothing of the\nshelter trenches he dug and many pitfalls, furnished at the bottom with\nsharp stakes, which he hollowed out wherever the soil could be easily\nmoved, to discomfit a charging enemy.\n\nIndeed, when I saw the amount of work he had concluded in ten\ndays, which was not until I joined him on the mountain, I was quite\nastonished.\n\nAbout this time a dispute arose as to whether we should attempt to\nprevent the Black Kendah from crossing the river which was now running\ndown, a plan that some of the elders favoured. At last the controversy\nwas referred to me as head general and I decided against anything of the\nsort. It seemed to me that our force was too small, and that if I took\nthe rifle-men a great deal of ammunition might be expended with poor\nresult. Also in the event of any reverse or when we were finally driven\nback, which must happen, there might be difficulty about remounting the\ncamels, our only means of escape from the horsemen who would possibly\ngallop us down. Moreover the Tava had several fords, any one of which\nmight be selected by the enemy. So it was arranged that we should make\nour first and last stand upon the Holy Mount.\n\nOn the fourteenth night from new moon our swift camel-scouts who were\nposted in relays between the Tava and the Mount reported that the Black\nKendah were gathered in thousands upon the farther side of the river,\nwhere they were engaged in celebrating magical ceremonies. On the\nfifteenth night the scouts reported that they were crossing the river,\nabout five thousand horsemen and fifteen thousand foot soldiers, and\nthat at the head of them marched the huge god-elephant Jana, on which\nrode Simba the King and a lame priest (evidently my friend whose foot\nhad been injured by the pistol), who acted as a mahout. This part of the\nstory I confess I did not believe, since it seemed to me impossible that\nanyone could ride upon that mad rogue, Jana. Yet, as subsequent events\nshowed, it was in fact true. I suppose that in certain hands the beast\nbecame tame. Or perhaps it was drugged.\n\nTwo nights later, for the Black Kendah advanced but slowly, spreading\nthemselves over the country in order to collect such crops as had not\nbeen gathered through lack of time or because they were still unripe,\nwe saw flames and smoke arising from the Town of the Child beneath us,\nwhich they had fired. Now we knew that the time of trial had come and\nuntil near midnight men, women and children worked feverishly finishing\nor trying to finish the fortifications and making every preparation in\nour power.\n\nOur position was that we held a very strong post, that is, strong\nagainst an enemy unprovided with big guns or even firearms, which, as\nall other possible approaches had been blocked, was only assailable by\ndirect frontal attack from the east. In the pass we had three main lines\nof defence, one arranged behind the other and separated by distances of\na few hundred yards. Our last refuge was furnished by the walls of the\ntemple itself, in the rear of which were camped the whole White Kendah\ntribe, save a few hundred who were employed in watching the herds of\ncamels and stock in almost inaccessible positions on the northern slopes\nof the Mount.\n\nThere were perhaps five thousand people of both sexes and every age\ngathered in this camp, which was so well provided with food and water\nthat it could have stood a siege of several months. If, however, our\ndefences should be carried there was no possibility of escape, since\nwe learned from our scouts that the Black Kendah, who by tradition and\nthrough spies were well acquainted with every feature of the country,\nhad detached a party of several thousand men to watch the western road\nand the slopes of the mountain, in case we should try to break out by\nthat route. The only one remaining, that which ran through the cave\nof the serpent, we had taken the precaution of blocking up with great\nstones, lest through it our flank should be turned.\n\nIn short, we were rats in a trap and where we were there we must either\nconquer or die--unless indeed we chose to surrender, which for most of\nus would mean a fate worse than death.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nALLAN QUATERMAIN MISSES\n\nI had made my last round of the little corps that I facetiously named\n\"The Sharpshooters,\" though to tell the truth at shooting they were\nanything but sharp, and seen that each man was in his place behind a\nwall with a reserve man squatted at the rear of every pair of them,\nwaiting to take his rifle if either of these should fall. Also I had\nmade sure that all of them had twenty rounds of ammunition in their skin\npouches. More I would not serve out, fearing lest in excitement or in\npanic they might fire away to the last cartridge uselessly, as before\nnow even disciplined white troops have been known to do. Therefore I had\narranged that certain old men of standing who could be trusted should\nwait in a place of comparative safety behind the line, carrying all our\nreserve ammunition, which amounted, allowing for what had been expended\nin practice, to nearly sixty rounds per rifle. This they were instructed\nto deliver from their wallets to the firing line in small lots when they\nsaw that it was necessary and not before.\n\nIt was, I admit, an arrangement apt to miscarry in the heat of desperate\nbattle, but I could think of none better, since it was absolutely\nnecessary that no shot should be wasted.\n\nAfter a few words of exhortation and caution to the natives who acted\nas sergeants to the corps, I returned to a bough shelter that had been\nbuilt for us behind a rock to get a few hours' sleep, if that were\npossible, before the fight began.\n\nHere I found Ragnall, who had just come in from his inspection. This\nwas of a much more extensive nature than my own, since it involved going\nround some furlongs of the rough walls and trenches that he had prepared\nwith so much thought and care, and seeing that the various companies of\nthe White Kendah were ready to play their part in the defence of them.\n\nHe was tired and rather excited, too much so to sleep at once. So we\ntalked a little while, first about the prospects of the morrow's battle,\nas to which we were, to say the least of it, dubious, and afterwards of\nother things. I asked him if during his stay in this place, while I was\nbelow at the town or later, he had heard or seen anything of his wife.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he answered. \"These priests never speak of her, and if\nthey did Har\u00fbt is the only one of them that I can really understand.\nMoreover, I have kept my word strictly and, even when I had occasion\nto see to the blocking of the western road, made a circuit on the\nmountain-top in order to avoid the neighbourhood of that house where I\nsuppose she lives Oh! Quatermain, my friend, my case is a hard one, as\nyou would think if the woman you loved with your whole heart were shut\nup within a few hundred yards of you and no communication with her\npossible after all this time of separation and agony. What makes it\nworse is, as I gathered from what Har\u00fbt said the other day, that she is\nstill out of her mind.\"\n\n\"That has some consolations,\" I replied, \"since the mindless do not\nsuffer. But if such is the case, how do you account for what you\nand poor Savage saw that night in the Town of the Child? It was not\naltogether a phantasy, for the dress you described was the same we saw\nher wearing at the Feast of the First-fruits.\"\n\n\"I don't know what to make of it, Quatermain, except that many strange\nthings happen in the world which we mock at as insults to our limited\nintelligence because we cannot understand them.\" (Very soon I was to\nhave another proof of this remark.) \"But what are you driving at? You\nare keeping something back.\"\n\n\"Only this, Ragnall. If your wife were utterly mad I cannot conceive\nhow it came about that she searched you out and spoke to you even in\na vision--for the thing was not an individual dream since both you and\nSavage saw her. Nor did she actually visit you in the flesh, as the door\nnever opened and the spider's web across it was not broken. So it comes\nto this: either some part of her is not mad but can still exercise\nsufficient will to project itself upon your senses, or she is dead and\nher disembodied spirit did this thing. Now we know that she is not\ndead, for we have seen her and Har\u00fbt has confessed as much. Therefore\nI maintain that, whatever may be her temporary state, she must still\nbe fundamentally of a reasonable mind, as she is of a natural body. For\ninstance, she may only be hypnotized, in which case the spell will break\none day.\"\n\n\"Thank you for that thought, old fellow. It never occurred to me and\nit gives me new hope. Now listen! If I should come to grief in this\nbusiness, which is very likely, and you should survive, you will do your\nbest to get her home; will you not? Here is a codicil to my will which I\ndrew up after that night of dream, duly witnessed by Savage and Hans.\nIt leaves to you whatever sums may be necessary in this connexion\nand something over for yourself. Take it, it is best in your keeping,\nespecially as if you should be killed it has no value.\"\n\n\"Of course I will do my best,\" I answered as I put away the paper in\nmy pocket. \"And now don't let us take any more thought of being killed,\nwhich may prevent us from getting the sleep we want. I don't mean to be\nkilled if I can help it. I mean to give those beggars, the Black Kendah,\nsuch a doing as they never had before, and then start for the coast with\nyou and Lady Ragnall, as, God willing, we shall do. Good night.\"\n\nAfter this I slept like a top for some hours, as I believe Ragnall did\nalso. When I awoke, which happened suddenly and completely, the first\nthing that I saw was Hans seated at the entrance to my little shelter\nsmoking his corn-cob pipe, and nursing the single-barrelled rifle,\nIntombi, on his knee. I asked him what the time was, to which he replied\nthat it lacked two hours to dawn. Then I asked him why he had not been\nsleeping. He replied that he had been asleep and dreamed a dream. Idly\nenough I inquired what dream, to which he replied:\n\n\"Rather a strange one, Baas, for a man who is about to go into battle. I\ndreamed that I was in a large place that was full of quiet. It was light\nthere, but I could not see any sun or moon, and the air was very soft\nand tasted like food and drink, so much so, Baas, that if anyone had\noffered me a cup quite full of the best 'Cape smoke' I should have told\nhim to take it away. Then, Baas, suddenly I saw your reverend father,\nthe Predikant, standing beside me and looking just as he used to look,\nonly younger and stronger and very happy, and so of course knew at once\nthat I was dead and in hell. Only I wondered where the fire that does\nnot go out might be, for I could not see it. Presently your reverend\nfather said to me: 'Good day, Hans. So you have come here at last. Now\ntell me, how has it gone with my son, the Baas Allan? Have you looked\nafter him as I told you to do?'\n\n\"I answered: 'I have looked after him as well as I could, O reverend\nsir. Little enough have I done; still, not once or twice or three times\nonly have I offered up my life for him as was my duty, and yet we both\nhave lived.' And that I might be sure he heard the best of me, as was\nbut natural, I told him the times, Baas, making a big story out of small\nthings, although all the while I could see that he knew exactly just\nwhere I began to lie and just where I stopped from lying. Still he did\nnot scold me, Baas; indeed, when I had finished, he said:\n\n\"'Well done, O good and faithful servant,' words that I think I have\nheard him use before when he was alive, Baas, and used to preach to us\nfor such a long time on Sunday afternoons. Then he asked: 'And how goes\nit with Baas Allan, my son, now, Hans?' to which I replied:\n\n\"'The Baas Allan is going to fight a very great battle in which he may\nwell fall, and if I could feel sorry here, which I can't, I should\nweep, O reverend sir, because I have died before that battle began and\ntherefore cannot stand at his side in the battle and be killed for him\nas a servant should for his master!'\n\n\"'You will stand at his side in the battle,' said your reverend father,\n'and those things which you desire you will do, as it is fitting that\nyou should. And afterwards, Hans, you will make report to me of how the\nbattle went and of what honour my son has won therein. Moreover, know\nthis, Hans, that though while you live in the world you seem to see many\nother things, they are but dreams, since in all the world there is but\none real thing, and its name is Love, which if it be but strong enough,\nthe stars themselves must obey, for it is the king of every one of them,\nand all who dwell in them worship it day and night under many names for\never and for ever, Amen.'\n\n\"What he meant by that I am sure I don't know, Baas, seeing that I have\nnever thought much of women, at least not for many years since my last\nold vrouw went and drank herself to death after lying in her sleep on\nthe baby which I loved much better than I did her, Baas.\n\n\"Well, before I could ask him, or about hell either, he was gone like a\nwhiff of smoke from a rifle mouth in a strong wind.\"\n\nHans paused, puffed at his pipe, spat upon the ground in his usual\nreflective way and asked:\n\n\"Is the Baas tired of the dream or would he like to hear the rest?\"\n\n\"I should like to hear the rest,\" I said in a low voice, for I was\nstrangely moved.\n\n\"Well, Baas, while I was standing in that place which was so full of\nquiet, turning my hat in my hands and wondering what work they would set\nme to there among the devils, I looked up. There I saw coming towards\nme two very beautiful women, Baas, who had their arms round each other's\nnecks. They were dressed in white, with the little hard things that are\nfound in shells hanging about them, and bright stones in their hair.\nAnd as they came, Baas, wherever they set a foot flowers sprang up, very\npretty flowers, so that all their path across the quiet place was marked\nwith flowers. Birds too sang as they passed, at least I think they were\nbirds though I could not see them.\"\n\n\"What were they like, Hans?\" I whispered.\n\n\"One of them, Baas, the taller I did not know. But the other I knew well\nenough; it was she whose name is holy, not to be mentioned. Yet I must\nmention that name; it was the Missie Marie herself as last we saw\nher alive many, many years ago, only grown a hundred times more\nbeautiful.\"[*]\n\n     [*] See the book called _Marie_ by H. Rider Haggard.\n\nNow I groaned, and Hans went on:\n\n\"The two White Ones came up to me, and stood looking at me with eyes\nthat were more soft than those of bucks. Then the Missie Marie said to\nthe other: 'This is Hans of whom I have so often told you, O Star.'\"\n\nHere I groaned again, for how did this Hottentot know that name, or\nrather its sweet rendering?\n\n\"Then she who was called Star asked, 'How goes it with one who is the\nheart of all three of us, O Hans?' Yes, Baas, those Shining Ones joined\n_me_, the dirty little Hottentot in my old clothes and smelling of\ntobacco, with themselves when they spoke of you, for I knew they were\nspeaking of you, Baas, which made me think I must be drunk, even there\nin the quiet place. So I told them all that I had told your reverend\nfather, and a very great deal more, for they seemed never to be tired of\nlistening. And once, when I mentioned that sometimes, while pretending\nto be asleep, I had heard you praying aloud at night for the Missie\nMarie who died for you, and for another who had been your wife whose\nname I did not remember but who had also died, they both cried a little,\nBaas. Their tears shone like crystals and smelt like that stuff in a\nlittle glass tube which Har\u00fbt said that he brought from some far land\nwhen he put a drop or two on your handkerchief, after you were faint\nfrom the pain in your leg at the house yonder. Or perhaps it was the\nflowers that smelt, for where the tears fell there sprang up white\nlilies shaped like two babes' hands held together in prayer.\"\n\nHearing this, I hid my face in my hands lest Hans should see human tears\nunscented with attar of roses, and bade him continue.\n\n\"Baas, the White One who was called Star, asked me of your son, the\nyoung Baas Harry, and I told her that when last I had seen him he was\nstrong and well and would make a bigger man than you were, whereat she\nsighed and shook her head. Then the Missie Marie said: 'Tell the Baas,\nHans, that I also have a child which he will see one day, but it is not\na son.'\n\n\"After this they, too, said something about Love, but what it was\nI cannot remember, since even as I repeat this dream to you it is\nbeginning to slip away from me fast as a swallow skimming the water.\nTheir last words, however, I do remember. They were: 'Say to the Baas\nthat we who never met in life, but who here are as twin sisters, wait\nand count the years and count the months and count the days and count\nthe hours and count the minutes and count the seconds until once more he\nshall hear our voices calling to him across the night.' That's what they\nsay, Baas. Then they were gone and only the flowers remained to show\nthat they had been standing there.\n\n\"Now I set off to bring you the message and travelled a very long way\nat a great rate; if Jana himself had been after me I could not have gone\nmore fast. At last I got out of that quiet place and among mountains\nwhere there were dark kloofs, and there in the kloofs I heard Zulu impis\nsinging their war-song; yes, they sang the _ingoma_ or something very\nlike it. Now suddenly in the pass of the mountains along which I sped,\nthere appeared before me a very beautiful woman whose skin shone like\nthe best copper coffee kettle after I have polished it, Baas. She was\ndressed in a leopard-like moocha and wore on her shoulders a fur kaross,\nand about her neck a circlet of blue beads, and from her hair there rose\none crane's feather tall as a walking-stick, and in her hand she held a\nlittle spear. No flowers sprang beneath her feet when she walked towards\nme and no birds sang, only the air was filled with the sound of a royal\nsalute which rolled among the mountains like the roar of thunder, and\nher eyes flashed like summer lightning.\"\n\nNow I let my hands fall and stared at him, for well I knew what was\ncoming.\n\n\"'Stand, yellow man!' she said, 'and give me the royal salute.'\n\n\"So I gave her the _Bay\u00e9te_, though who she might be I did not know,\nsince I did not think it wise to stay to ask her if it were hers of\nright, although I should have liked to do so. Then she said: 'The Old\nMan on the plain yonder and those two pale White Ones have talked to you\nof their love for your master, the Lord Macumazana. I tell you, little\nYellow Dog, that they do not know what love can be. There is more love\nfor him in my eyes alone than they have in all that makes them fair. Say\nit to the Lord Macumazana that, as I know well, he goes down to battle\nand that the Lady Mameena will be with him in the battle as, though he\nsaw her not, she has been with him in other battles, and will be with\nhim till the River of Time has run over the edge of the world and is\nlost beyond the sun. Let him remember this when Jana rushes on and death\nis very near to him to-day, and let him look--for then perchance he\nshall see me. Begone now, Yellow Dog, to the heels of your master, and\nplay your part well in the battle, for of what you do or leave undone\nyou shall give account to me. Say that Mameena sends her greetings to\nthe Lord Macumazana and that she adds this, that when the Old Man and\nthe White ones told you that Love is the secret blood of the worlds\nwhich makes them to be they did not lie. Love reigns and I, Mameena, am\nits priestess, and the heart of Macumazana is my holy house.'\n\n\"Then, Baas, I tumbled off a precipice and woke up here; and, Baas, as\nwe may not light a fire I have kept some coffee hot for you buried in\nwarm ashes,\" and without another word he went to fetch that coffee,\nleaving me shaken and amazed.\n\nFor what kind of a dream was it which revealed to an old Hottentot all\nthese mysteries and hidden things about persons whom he had never seen\nand of whom I had never spoken to him? My father and my wife Marie might\nbe explained, for with these he had been mixed up, but how about Stella\nand above all Mameena, although of course it was possible that he had\nheard of the latter, who made some stir in her time? But to hit her off\nas he had done in all her pride, splendour, and dominion of desire!\n\nWell, that was his story which, perhaps fortunately, I lacked time to\nanalyse or brood upon, since there was much in it calculated to unnerve\na man just entering the crisis of a desperate fray. Indeed a minute or\nso later, as I was swallowing the last of the coffee, messengers arrived\nabout some business, I forget what, sent by Ragnall I think, who had\nrisen before I woke. I turned to give the pannikin to Hans, but he had\nvanished in his snake-like fashion, so I threw it down upon the ground\nand devoted my mind to the question raised in Ragnall's message.\n\nNext minute scouts came in who had been watching the camp of the Black\nKendah all night.\n\nThese were sleeping not more than half a mile away, in an open place on\nthe slope of the hill with pickets thrown out round them, intending to\nadvance upon us, it was said, as soon as the sun rose, since because of\ntheir number they feared lest to march at night should throw them into\nconfusion and, in case of their falling into an ambush, bring about a\ndisaster. Such at least was the story of two spies whom our people had\ncaptured.\n\nThere had been some question as to whether we should not attempt a night\nattack upon their camp, of which I was rather in favour. After full\ndebate, however, the idea had been abandoned, owing to the fewness of\nour numbers, the dislike which the White Kendah shared with the Black of\nattempting to operate in the dark, and the well chosen position of our\nenemy, whom it would be impossible to rush before we were discovered by\ntheir outposts. What I hoped in my heart was that they might try to\nrush us, notwithstanding the story of the two captured spies, and in\nthe gloom, after the moon had sunk low and before the dawn came, become\nentangled in our pitfalls and outlying entrenchments, where we should be\nable to destroy a great number of them. Only on the previous afternoon\nthat cunning old fellow, Hans, had pointed out to me how advantageous\nsuch an event would be to our cause and, while agreeing with him, I\nsuggested that probably the Black Kendah knew this as well as we did, as\nthe prisoners had told us.\n\nYet that very thing happened, and through Hans himself. Thus: Old Har\u00fbt\nhad come to me just one hour before the dawn to inform me that all\nour people were awake and at their stations, and to make some last\narrangements as to the course of the defence, also about our final\nconcentration behind the last line of walls and in the first court of\nthe temple, if we should be driven from the outer entrenchments. He\nwas telling me that the Oracle of the Child had uttered words at the\nceremony that night which he and all the priests considered were of the\nmost favourable import, news to which I listened with some impatience,\nfeeling as I did that this business had passed out of the range of the\nChild and its Oracle. As he spoke, suddenly through the silence that\nprecedes the dawn, there floated to our ears the unmistakable sound of\na rifle. Yes, a rifle shot, half a mile or so away, followed by the\nroaring murmur of a great camp unexpectedly alarmed at night.\n\n\"Who can have fired that?\" I asked. \"The Black Kendah have no guns.\"\n\nHe replied that he did not know, unless some of my fifty men had left\ntheir posts.\n\nWhile we were investigating the matter, scouts rushed in with the\nintelligence that the Black Kendah, thinking apparently that they were\nbeing attacked, had broken camp and were advancing towards us. We passed\na warning all down the lines and stood to arms. Five minutes later, as I\nstood listening to that approaching roar, filled with every kind of fear\nand melancholy foreboding such as the hour and the occasion might well\nhave evoked, through the gloom, which was dense, the moon being hidden\nbehind the hill, I thought I caught sight of something running towards\nme like a crouching man. I lifted my rifle to fire but, reflecting that\nit might be no more than a hyena and fearing to provoke a fusilade from\nmy half-trained company, did not do so.\n\nNext instant I was glad indeed, for immediately on the other side of the\nwall behind which I was standing I heard a well-known voice gasp out:\n\n\"Don't shoot, Baas, it is I.\"\n\n\"What have you been doing, Hans?\" I said as he scrambled over the wall\nto my side, limping a little as I fancied.\n\n\"Baas,\" he puffed, \"I have been paying the Black Kendah a visit. I crept\ndown between their stupid outposts, who are as blind in the dark as a\nbat in daytime, hoping to find Jana and put a bullet into his leg or\ntrunk. I didn't find him, Baas, although I heard him. But one of their\ncaptains stood up in front of a watchfire, giving a good shot. My bullet\nfound _him_, Baas, for he tumbled back into the fire making the sparks\nfly this way and that. Then I ran and, as you see, got here quite\nsafely.\"\n\n\"Why did you play that fool's trick?\" I asked, \"seeing that it ought to\nhave cost you your life?\"\n\n\"I shall die just when I have to die, not before, Baas,\" he replied in\nthe intervals of reloading the little rifle. \"Also it was the trick of a\nwise man, not of a fool, seeing that it has made the Black Kendah think\nthat we were attacking them and caused them to hurry on to attack _us_\nin the dark over ground that they do not know. Listen to them coming!\"\n\nAs he spoke a roar of sound told us that the great charge had swept\nround a turn there was in the pass and was heading towards us up\nthe straight. Ivory horns brayed, captains shouted orders, the very\nmountains shook beneath the beating of thousands of feet of men and\nhorses, while in one great yell that echoed from the cliffs and forests\nwent up the battle-cry of \"_Jana! Jana!_\"--a mixed tumult of noise which\ncontrasted very strangely with the utter silence in our ranks.\n\n\"They will be among the pitfalls presently,\" sniggered Hans, shifting\nhis weight nervously from one leg on to the other. \"Hark! they are going\ninto them.\"\n\nIt was true. Screams of fear and pain told me that the front ranks\nhad begun to fall, horse and foot together, into the cunningly devised\nsnares of which with so much labour we had dug many, concealing them\nwith earth spread over thin wickerwork, or rather interlaced\nboughs. Into them went the forerunners, to be pierced by the sharp,\nfire-hardened stakes set at the bottom of each pit. Vainly did those who\nwere near enough to understand their danger call to the ranks behind to\nstop. They could not or would not comprehend, and had no room to extend\ntheir front. Forward surged the human torrent, thrusting all in front of\nit to death by wounds or suffocation in those deadly holes, till one by\none they were filled level with the ground by struggling men and horses,\nover whom the army still rushed on.\n\nHow many perished there I do not know, but after the battle was over we\nfound scarcely a pit that was not crowded to the brim with dead. Truly\nthis device of Ragnall's, for if I had conceived the idea, which\nwas unfamiliar to the Kendah, it was he who had carried it out in so\nmasterly a fashion, had served us well.\n\nStill the enemy surged on, since the pits were only large enough to hold\na tithe of them, till at length, horsemen and footmen mixed up together\nin inextricable confusion, their mighty mass became faintly visible\nquite close to us, a blacker blot upon the gloom.\n\nThen my turn came. When they were not more than fifty yards away from\nthe first wall, I shouted an order to my riflemen to fire, aiming low,\nand set the example by loosing both barrels of an elephant gun at the\nthickest of the mob. At that distance even the most inexperienced shots\ncould not miss such a mark, especially as those bullets that went high\nstruck among the oncoming troops behind, or caught the horsemen lifted\nabove their fellows. Indeed, of the first few rounds I do not think that\none was wasted, while often single balls killed or injured several men.\n\nThe result was instantaneous. The Black Kendah who, be it remembered,\nwere totally unaccustomed to the effects of rifle fire and imagined that\nwe only possessed two or three guns in all, stopped their advance as\nthough paralyzed. For a few seconds there was silence, except for the\nintermittent crackle of the rifles as my men loaded and fired. Next came\nthe cries of the smitten men and horses that were falling everywhere,\nand then--the unmistakable sound of a stampede.\n\n\"They have gone. That was too warm for them, Baas,\" chuckled Hans\nexultingly.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, when I had at length succeeded in stopping the\nfiring, \"but I expect they will come back with the light. Still, that\ntrick of yours has cost them dear, Hans.\"\n\nBy degrees the dawn began to break. It was, I remember, a particularly\nbeautiful dawn, resembling a gigantic and vivid rose opening in the\neast, or a cup of brightness from which many coloured wines were poured\nall athwart the firmament. Very peaceful also, for not a breath of wind\nwas stirring. But what a scene the first rays of the sun revealed upon\nthat narrow stretch of pass in front of us. Everywhere the pitfalls and\ntrenches were filled with still surging heaps of men and horses, while\nall about lay dead and wounded men, the red harvest of our rifle fire.\nIt was dreadful to contrast the heavenly peace above and the hellish\nhorror beneath.\n\nWe took count and found that up to this moment we had not lost a single\nman, one only having been slightly wounded by a thrown spear. As is\ncommon among semi-savages, this fact filled the White Kendah with an\nundue exultation. Thinking that as the beginning was so the end must\nbe, they cheered and shouted, shaking each other's hands, then fell to\neating the food which the women brought them with appetite, chattering\nincessantly, although as a general rule they were a very silent people.\nEven the grave Har\u00fbt, who arrived full of congratulations, seemed as\nhigh-spirited as a boy, till I reminded him that the real battle had not\nyet commenced.\n\nThe Black Kendah had fallen into a trap and lost some of their number,\nthat was all, which was fortunate for us but could scarcely affect the\nissue of the struggle, since they had many thousands left. Ragnall, who\nhad come up from his lines, agreed with me. As he said, these people\nwere fighting for life as well as honour, seeing that most of the corn\nwhich they needed for their sustenance was stored in great heaps either\nin or to the rear of the temple behind us. Therefore they must come on\nuntil they won or were destroyed. How with our small force could we hope\nto destroy this multitude? That was the problem which weighed upon our\nhearts.\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour later two spies that we had set upon the\ntop of the precipitous cliffs, whence they had a good view of the pass\nbeyond the bend, came scrambling down the rocks like monkeys by a route\nthat was known to them. These boys, for they were no more, reported that\nthe Black Kendah were reforming their army beyond the bend of the pass,\nand that the cavalry were dismounting and sending their horses to the\nrear, evidently because they found them useless in such a place. A\nlittle later solitary men appeared from behind the bend, carrying\nbundles of long sticks to each of which was attached a piece of white\ncloth, a proceeding that excited my curiosity.\n\nSoon its object became apparent. Swiftly these men, of whom in the end\nthere may have been thirty or forty, ran to and fro, testing the ground\nwith spears in search for pitfalls. I think they only found a very few\nthat had not been broken into, but in front of these and also of those\nthat were already full of men and horses they set up the flags as a\nwarning that they should be avoided in the advance. Also they removed a\nnumber of their wounded.\n\nWe had great difficulty in restraining the White Kendah from rushing out\nto attack them, which of course would only have led us into a trap in\nour turn, since they would have fled and conducted their pursuers into\nthe arms of the enemy. Nor would I allow my riflemen to fire, as the\nresult must have been many misses and a great waste of ammunition which\nere long would be badly wanted. I, however, did shoot two or three, then\ngave it up as the remainder took no notice whatever.\n\nWhen they had thoroughly explored the ground they retired until, a\nlittle later, the Black Kendah army began to appear, marching in serried\nregiments and excellent order round the bend, till perhaps eight or ten\nthousand of them were visible, a very fierce and awe-inspiring _impi_.\nTheir front ranks halted between three and four hundred yards away,\nwhich I thought farther off than it was advisable to open fire on them\nwith Snider rifles held by unskilled troops. Then came a pause, which\nat length was broken by the blowing of horns and a sound of exultant\nshouting beyond the turn of the pass.\n\nNow from round this turn appeared the strangest sight that I think my\neyes had ever seen. Yes, there came the huge elephant, Jana, at a slow,\nshambling trot. On his back and head were two men in whom, with my\nglasses, I recognized the lame priest whom I already knew too well and\nSimba, the king of the Black Kendah, himself, gorgeously apparelled and\nwaving a long spear, seated in a kind of wooden chair. Round the brute's\nneck were a number of bright metal chains, twelve in all, and each of\nthese chains was held by a spearman who ran alongside, six on one side\nand six on the other. Lastly, ingeniously fastened to the end of his\ntrunk were three other chains to which were attached spiked knobs of\nmetal.\n\nOn he came as docilely as any Indian elephant used for carrying teak\nlogs, passing through the centre of the host up a wide lane which had\nbeen left, I suppose for his convenience, and intelligently avoiding the\npitfalls filled with dead. I thought that he would stop among the first\nranks. But not so. Slackening his pace to a walk he marched forwards\ntowards our fortifications. Now, of course, I saw my chance and made\nsure that my double-barrelled elephant rifle was ready and that Hans\nheld a second rifle, also double-barrelled and of similar calibre,\nfull-cocked in such a position that I could snatch it from him in a\nmoment.\n\n\"I am going to kill that elephant,\" I said. \"Let no one else fire. Stand\nstill and you shall see the god Jana die.\"\n\nStill the enormous beast floundered forward; up to that moment I had\nnever realized how truly huge it was, not even when it stood over me in\nthe moonlight about to crush me with its foot. Of this I am sure, that\nnone to equal it ever lived in Africa, at least in any times of which I\nhave knowledge.\n\n\"Fire, Baas,\" whispered Hans, \"it is near enough.\"\n\nBut like the Frenchman and the cock pheasant, I determined to wait until\nit stopped, wishing to finish it with a single ball, if only for the\nprestige of the thing.\n\nAt length it did stop and, opening its cavern of a mouth, lifted its\ngreat trunk and trumpeted, while Simba, standing up in his chair, began\nto shout out some command to us to surrender to the god Jana, \"the\nInvincible, the Invulnerable.\"\n\n\"I will show you if you are invulnerable, my boy,\" said I to myself,\nglancing round to make sure that Hans had the second rifle ready and\ncatching sight of Ragnall and Har\u00fbt and all the White Kendah standing\nup in their trenches, breathlessly awaiting the end, as were the Black\nKendah a few hundred yards away. Never could there have been a fairer\nshot and one more certain to result in a fatal wound. The brute's head\nwas up and its mouth was open. All I had to do was to send a hard-tipped\nbullet crashing through the palate to the brain behind. It was so easy\nthat I would have made a bet that I could have finished him with one\nhand tied behind me.\n\nI lifted the heavy rifle. I got the sights dead on to a certain spot at\nthe back of that red cave. I pressed the trigger; the charge boomed--and\nnothing happened! I heard no bullet strike and Jana did not even take\nthe trouble to close his mouth.\n\nAn exclamation of \"O-oh!\" went up from the watchers. Before it had\ndied away the second bullet followed the first, with the same result\nor rather lack of result, and another louder \"O-oh!\" arose. Then Jana\ntranquilly shut his mouth, having finished trumpeting, and as though\nto give me a still better target, turned broadside on and stood quite\nstill.\n\nWith an inward curse I snatched the second rifle and aiming behind the\near at a spot which long experience told me covered the heart let drive\nagain, first one barrel and then the other.\n\nJana never stirred. No bullet thudded. No mark of blood appeared upon\nhis hide. The horrible thought overcame me that I, Allan Quatermain,\nI the famous shot, the renowned elephant-hunter, had four times missed\nthis haystack of a brute from a distance of forty yards. So great was\nmy shame that I think I almost fainted. Through a kind of mist I heard\nvarious ejaculations:\n\n\"Great Heavens!\" said Ragnall.\n\n\"_Allemagte!_\" remarked Hans.\n\n\"The Child help us!\" muttered Har\u00fbt.\n\nAll the rest of them stared at me as though I were a freak or a lunatic.\nThen somebody laughed nervously, and immediately everybody began to\nlaugh. Even the distant army of the Black Kendah became convulsed with\nroars of unholy merriment and I, Allan Quatermain, was the centre of\nall this mockery, till I felt as though I were going mad. Suddenly the\nlaughter ceased and once more Simba the King began to roar out something\nabout \"Jana the Invincible and Invulnerable,\" to which the White Kendah\nreplied with cries of \"Magic\" and \"Bewitched! Bewitched!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" yelled Simba, \"no bullet can touch Jana the god, not even those\nof the white lord who was brought from far to kill him.\"\n\nHans leaped on to the top of the wall, where he danced up and down like\nan intoxicated monkey, and screamed:\n\n\"Then where is Jana's left eye? Did not my bullet put it out like a\nlamp? If Jana is invulnerable, why did my bullet put out his left eye?\"\n\nHans ceased from dancing on the wall and steadying himself, lifted the\nlittle rifle Intombi, shouting:\n\n\"Let us see whether after all this beast is a god or an elephant.\"\n\nThen he touched the trigger, and simultaneously with the report, I heard\nthe bullet clap and saw blood appear on Jana's hide just by the very\nspot over the heart at which I had aimed without result. Of course, the\nsoft ball driven from a small-bore rifle with a light charge of powder\nwas far too weak to penetrate to the vitals. Probably it did not do much\nmore than pierce through the skin and an inch or two of flesh behind it.\n\nStill, its effects upon this \"invulnerable\" god were of a marked order.\nHe whipped round; he lifted his trunk and screamed with rage and pain.\nThen off he lumbered back towards his own people, at such a pace that\nthe attendants who held the chains on either side of him were thrown\nover and forced to leave go of him, while the king and the priest upon\nhis back could only retain their seats by clinging to the chair and the\nrope about his neck.\n\nThe result was satisfactory so far as the dispelling of magical\nillusions went, but it left me in a worse position than before, since\nit now became evident that what had protected Jana from my bullets was\nnothing more supernatural than my own lack of skill. Oh! never in my\nlife did I drink of such a cup of humiliation as it was my lot to drain\nto the dregs in this most unhappy hour. Almost did I hope that I might\nbe killed at once.\n\nAnd yet, and yet, how was it possible that with all my skill I should\nhave missed this towering mountain of flesh four times in succession.\nThe question is one to which I have never discovered any answer,\nespecially as Hans hit it easily enough, which at the time I wished\nheartily he had not done, since his success only served to emphasize\nmy miserable failure. Fortunately, just then a diversion occurred which\nfreed my unhappy self from further public attention. With a shout and a\nroar the great army of the Black Kendah woke into life.\n\nThe advance had begun.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nALLAN WEEPS\n\nOn they came, slowly and steadily, preceded by a cloud of skirmishers--a\nthousand or more of these--who kept as open an order as the narrow\nground would allow and carried, each of them, a bundle of throwing\nspears arranged in loops or sockets at the back of the shield. When\nthese men were about a hundred yards away we opened fire and killed a\ngreat number of them, also some of the marshalled troops behind. But\nthis did not stop them in the least, for what could fifty rifles do\nagainst a horde of brave barbarians who, it seemed, had no fear of\ndeath? Presently their spears were falling among us and a few casualties\nbegan to occur, not many, because of the protecting wall, but still\nsome. Again and again we loaded and fired, sweeping away those in front\nof us, but always others came to take their places. Finally at some word\nof command these light skirmishers vanished, except whose who were dead\nor wounded, taking shelter behind the advancing regiments which now were\nwithin fifty yards of us.\n\nThen, after a momentary pause another command was shouted out and the\nfirst regiment charged in three solid ranks. We fired a volley point\nblank into them and, as it was hopeless for fifty men to withstand such\nan onslaught, bolted during the temporary confusion that ensued, taking\nrefuge, as it had been arranged that we should do, at a point of vantage\nfarther down the line of fortifications, whence we maintained our\ngalling fire.\n\nNow it was that the main body of the White Kendah came into action under\nthe leadership of Ragnall and Har\u00fbt. The enemy scrambled over the first\nwall, which we had just vacated, to find themselves in a network of\nother walls held by our spearmen in a narrow place where numbers gave no\ngreat advantage.\n\nHere the fighting was terrible and the loss of the attackers great, for\nalways as they carried one entrenchment they found another a few yards\nin front of them, out of which the defenders could only be driven at\nmuch cost of life.\n\nTwo hours or more the battle went on thus. In spite of the desperate\nresistance which we offered, the multitude of the Black Kendah, who I\nmust say fought magnificently, stormed wall after wall, leaving hundreds\nof dead and wounded to mark their difficult progress. Meanwhile I and\nmy riflemen rained bullets on them from certain positions which we had\nselected beforehand, until at length our ammunition began to run low.\n\nAt half-past eight in the morning we were driven back over the open\nground to our last entrenchment, a very strong one just outside of the\neastern gate of the temple which, it will be remembered, was set in\na tunnel pierced through the natural lava rock. Thrice did the Black\nKendah come on and thrice we beat them off, till the ditch in front of\nthe wall was almost full of fallen. As fast as they climbed to the top\nof it the White Kendah thrust them through with their long spears, or we\nshot them with our rifles, the nature of the ground being such that only\na direct frontal attack was possible.\n\nIn the end they drew back sullenly, having, as we hoped, given up the\nassault. As it turned out, this was not so. They were only resting\nand waiting for the arrival of their reserve. It came up shouting and\nsinging a war-song, two thousand strong or more, and presently once more\nthey charged like a flood of water. We beat them back. They reformed and\ncharged a second time and we beat them back.\n\nThen they took another counsel. Standing among the dead and dying at the\nbase of the wall, which was built of loose stones and earth, where we\ncould not easily get at them because of the showers of spears which\nwere rained at anyone who showed himself, they began to undermine it,\nlevering out the bottom stones with stakes and battering them with\npoles.\n\nIn five minutes a breach appeared, through which they poured\ntumultuously. It was hopeless to withstand that onslaught of so vast a\nnumber. Fighting desperately, we were driven down the tunnel and through\nthe doors that were opened to us, into the first court of the temple.\nBy furious efforts we managed to close these doors and block them\nwith stones and earth. But this did not avail us long, for, bringing\nbrushwood and dry grass, they built a fire against them that soon caught\nthe thick cedar wood of which they were made.\n\nWhile they burned we consulted together. Further retreat seemed\nimpossible, since the second court of the temple, save for a narrow\npassage, was filled with corn which allowed no room for fighting,\nwhile behind it were gathered all the women and children, more than two\nthousand of them. Here, or nowhere, we must make our stand and conquer\nor die. Up to this time, compared with what which we had inflicted upon\nthe Black Kendah, of whom a couple of thousand or more had fallen, our\nloss was comparatively slight, say two hundred killed and as many more\nwounded. Most of such of the latter as could not walk we had managed to\ncarry into the first court of the temple, laying them close against the\ncloister walls, whence they watched us in a grisly ring.\n\nThis left us about sixteen hundred able-bodied men or many more than we\ncould employ with effect in that narrow place. Therefore we determined\nto act upon a plan which we had already designed in case such an\nemergency as ours should arise. About three hundred and fifty of the\nbest men were to remain to defend the temple till all were slain. The\nrest, to the number of over a thousand, were to withdraw through the\nsecond court and the gates beyond to the camp of the women and children.\nThese they were to conduct by secret paths that were known to them to\nwhere the camels were kraaled, and mounting as many as possible of\nthem on the camels to fly whither they could. Our hope was that the\nvictorious Black Kendah would be too exhausted to follow them across the\nplain to the distant mountains. It was a dreadful determination, but we\nhad no choice.\n\n\"What of my wife?\" Ragnall asked hoarsely.\n\n\"While the temple stands she must remain in the temple,\" replied Har\u00fbt.\n\"But when all is lost, if I have fallen, do you, White Lord, go to the\nsanctuary with those who remain and take her and the Ivory Child and\nflee after the others. Only I lay this charge on you under pain of the\ncurse of Heaven, that you do not suffer the Ivory Child to fall into the\nhands of the Black Kendah. First must you burn it with fire or grind it\nto dust with stones. Moreover, I give this command to all in case of\nthe priests in charge of it should fail me, that they set flame to the\nbrushwood that is built up with the stacks of corn, so that, after all,\nthose of our enemies who escape may die of famine.\"\n\nInstantly and without murmuring, for never did I see more perfect\ndiscipline than that which prevailed among these poor people, the orders\ngiven by Har\u00fbt, who in addition to his office as head priest was a kind\nof president of what was in fact a republic, were put in the way of\nexecution. Company by company the men appointed to escort the women and\nchildren departed through the gateway of the second court, each company\nturning in the gateway to salute us who remained, by raising their\nspears, till all were gone. Then we, the three hundred and fifty who\nwere left, marshalled ourselves as the Greeks may have done in the Pass\nof Thermopyl\u00e6.\n\nFirst stood I and my riflemen, to whom all the remaining ammunition was\nserved out; it amounted to eight rounds per man. Then, ranged across\nthe court in four lines, came the spearmen armed with lances and swords\nunder the immediate command of Har\u00fbt. Behind these, near the gate of the\nsecond court so that at the last they might attempt the rescue of the\npriestess, were fifty picked men, captained by Ragnall, who, I forgot\nto say, was wounded in two places, though not badly, having received\na spear thrust in the left shoulder and a sword cut to the left thigh\nduring his desperate defence of the entrenchment.\n\nBy the time that all was ready and every man had been given to drink\nfrom the great jars of water which stood along the walls, the massive\nwooden doors began to burn through, though this did not happen for quite\nhalf an hour after the enemy had begun to attempt to fire them. They\nfell at length beneath the battering of poles, leaving only the mound of\nearth and stones which we had piled up in the gateway after the closing\nof the doors. This the Black Kendah, who had raked out the burning\nembers, set themselves to dig away with hands and sticks and spears, a\ntask that was made very difficult to them by about a score of our people\nwho stabbed at them with their long lances or dashed them down with\nstones, killing and disabling many. But always the dead and wounded were\ndragged off while others took their places, so that at last the gateway\nwas practically cleared. Then I called back the spearmen who passed into\nthe ranks behind us, and made ready to play my part.\n\nI had not long to wait. With a rush and a roar a great company of the\nBlack Kendah charged the gateway. Just as they began to emerge into the\ncourt I gave the word to fire, sending fifty Snider bullets tearing into\nthem from a distance of a few yards. They fell in a heap; they fell like\ncorn before the scythe, not a man won through. Quickly we reloaded and\nwaited for the next rush. In due course it came and the dreadful scene\nrepeated itself. Now the gateway and the tunnel beyond were so choked\nwith fallen men that the enemy must drag these out before they could\ncharge any more. It was done under the fire of myself, Hans and a few\npicked shots--somehow it was done.\n\nOnce more they charged, and once more were mown down. So it went on\ntill our last cartridge was spent, for never did I see more magnificent\ncourage than was shown by those Black Kendah in the face of terrific\nloss. Then my people threw aside their useless rifles and arming\nthemselves with spears and swords fell back to rest, leaving Har\u00fbt and\nhis company to take their place. For half an hour or more raged that\nawful struggle, since the spot being so narrow, charge as they would,\nthe Black Kendah could not win through the spears of despairing\nwarriors defending their lives and the sanctuary of their god. Nor, the\nencircling cliffs being so sheer, could they get round any other way.\n\nAt length the enemy drew back as though defeated, giving us time to drag\naside our dead and wounded and drink more water, for the heat in the\nplace was now overwhelming. We hoped against hope that they had given up\nthe attack. But this was far from the case; they were but making a new\nplan.\n\nSuddenly in the gateway there appeared the huge bulk of the elephant\nJana, rushing forward at speed and being urged on by men who pricked it\nwith spears behind. It swept through the defenders as though they were\nbut dry grass, battering those in front of it with its great trunk\nfrom which swung the iron balls that crushed all on whom they fell, and\npaying no more heed to the lance thrusts than it might have done to the\nbites of gnats. On it came, trumpeting and trampling, and after it in a\nflood flowed the Black Kendah, upon whom our spearmen flung themselves\nfrom either side.\n\nAt the time I, followed by Hans, was just returning from speaking with\nRagnall at the gate of the second court. A little before I had retired\nexhausted from the fierce and fearful fighting, whereon he took my place\nand repelled several of the Black Kendah charges, including the last. In\nthis fray he received a further injury, a knock on the head from a stick\nor stone which stunned him for a few minutes, whereon some of our people\nhad carried him off and set him on the ground with his back against one\nof the pillars of the second gate. Being told that he was hurt I ran\nto see what was the matter. Finding to my joy that it was nothing very\nserious, I was hurrying to the front again when I looked up and saw that\ndevil Jana charging straight towards me, the throng of armed men parting\non each side of him, as rough water does before the leaping prow of a\nstorm-driven ship.\n\nTo tell the truth, although I was never fond of unnecessary risks, I\nrejoiced at the sight. Not even all the excitement of that hideous and\nprolonged battle had obliterated from my mind the burning sense of shame\nat the exhibition which I had made of myself by missing this beast with\nfour barrels at forty yards.\n\nNow, thought I to myself with a kind of exultant thrill, now, Jana,\nI will wipe out both my disgrace and you. This time there shall be no\nmistake, or if there is, let it be my last.\n\nOn thundered Jana, whirling the iron balls among the soldiers, who fled\nto right and left leaving a clear path between me and him. To make quite\nsure of things, for I was trembling a little with fatigue and somewhat\nsick from the continuous sight of bloodshed, I knelt down upon my right\nknee, using the other as a prop for my left elbow, and since I could\nnot make certain of a head shot because of the continual whirling of\nthe huge trunk, got the sight of my big-game rifle dead on to the beast\nwhere the throat joins the chest. I hoped that the heavy conical\nbullet would either pierce through to the spine or cut one of the large\narteries in the neck, or at least that the tremendous shock of its\nimpact would bring him down.\n\nAt about twenty paces I fired and hit--not Jana but the lame priest who\nwas fulfilling the office of mahout, perched upon his shoulders many\nfeet above the point at which I had aimed. Yes! I hit him in the head,\nwhich was shattered like an eggshell, so that he fell lifeless to the\nground.\n\nIn perfect desperation again I aimed, and fired when Jana was not more\nthan thirty feet away. This time the bullet must have gone wide to\nthe left, for I saw a chip fly from the end of the animal's broken and\ndeformed tusk, which stuck out in that direction several feet clear of\nits side.\n\nThen I gave up all hope. There was no time to gain my feet and escape;\nindeed I did not wish to do so, who felt that there are some failures\nwhich can only be absolved by death. I just knelt there, waiting for the\nend.\n\nIn an instant the giant creature was almost over me. I remember looking\nup at it and thinking in a queer sort of a way--perhaps it was some\nancestral memory--that I was a little ape-like child about to be slain\nby a primordial elephant, thrice as big as any that now inhabit the\nearth. Then something appeared to happen which I only repeat to show how\nat such moments absurd and impossible things seem real to us.\n\nThe reader may remember the strange dream which Hans had related to me\nthat morning.\n\nOne incident of this phantasy was that he had met the spirit of the Zulu\nlady Mameena, whom I knew in bygone years, and that she bade him tell me\nshe would be with me in the battle and that I was to look for her when\ndeath drew near to me and \"Jana thundered on,\" for then perchance I\nshould see her.\n\nWell, no doubt in some lightning flash of thought the memory of these\nwords occurred to me at this juncture, with the ridiculous result that\nmy subjective intelligence, if that is the right term, actually created\nthe scene which they described. As clearly, or perhaps more clearly than\never I saw anything else in my life, I appeared to behold the beautiful\nMameena in her fur cloak and her blue beads, standing between Jana and\nmyself with her arms folded upon her breast and looking exactly as she\ndid in the tremendous moment of her death before King Panda. I even\nnoted how the faint breeze stirred a loose end of her outspread hair\nand how the sunlight caught a particular point of a copper bangle on her\nupper arm.\n\nSo she stood, or rather seemed to stand, quite still; and as it\nhappened, at that moment the giant Jana, either because something had\nfrightened him, or perhaps owing to the shock of my bullet striking on\nhis tusk having jarred the brain, suddenly pulled up, sliding along a\nlittle with all his four feet together, till I thought he was going to\nsit down like a performing elephant. Then it appeared to me as though\nMameena turned round very slowly, bent towards me, whispering something\nwhich I could not hear although her lips moved, looked at me sweetly\nwith those wonderful eyes of hers and vanished away.\n\nA fraction of a second later all this vision had gone and something that\nwas no vision took its place. Jana had recovered himself and was at me\nagain with open mouth and lifted trunk. I heard a Dutch curse and saw\na little yellow form; saw Hans, for it was he, thrust the barrels of\nmy second elephant rifle almost into that red cave of a mouth, which\nhowever they could not reach, and fire, first one barrel, then the\nother.\n\nAnother moment, and the mighty trunk had wrapped itself about Hans and\nhurled him through the air to fall on to his head and arms thirty or\nforty feet away.\n\nJana staggered as though he too were about to fall; recovered himself,\nswerved to the right, perhaps to follow Hans, stumbled on a few paces,\nmissing me altogether, then again came to a standstill. I wriggled\nmyself round and, seated on the pavement of the court, watched what\nfollowed, and glad am I that I was able to do so, for never shall I\nbehold such another scene.\n\nFirst I saw Ragnall run up with a rifle and fire two barrels at the\nbrute's head, of which he took no notice whatsoever. Then I saw his\nwife, who in this land was known as the Guardian of the Child, issuing\nfrom the portals of the second court, dressed in her goddess robes,\nwearing the cap of bird's feathers, attended by the two priestesses also\ndressed as goddesses, as we had seen her on the morning of sacrifice,\nand holding in front of her the statue of the Ivory Child.\n\nOn she came quite quietly, her wide, empty eyes fixed upon Jana. As she\nadvanced the monster seemed to grow uneasy. Turning his head, he lifted\nhis trunk and thrust it along his back until it gripped the ankle of the\nKing Simba, who all this while was seated there in his chair making no\nmovement.\n\nWith a slow, steady pull he dragged Simba from the chair so that he fell\nupon the ground near his left foreleg. Next very composedly he wound his\ntrunk about the body of the helpless man, whose horrified eyes I can see\nto this day, and began to whirl him round and round in the air, gently\nat first but with a motion that grew ever more rapid, until the bright\nchains on the victim's breast flashed in the sunlight like a silver\nwheel. Then he hurled him to the ground, where the poor king lay a mere\nshattered pulp that had been human.\n\nNow the priestess was standing in front of the beast-god, apparently\nquite without fear, though her two attendants had fallen back. Ragnall\nsprang forward as though to drag her away, but a dozen men leapt on to\nhim and held him fast, either to save his life or for some secret reason\nof their own which I never learned.\n\nJana looked down at her and she looked up at Jana. Then he screamed\nfuriously and, shooting out his trunk, snatched the Ivory Child from her\nhands, whirled it round as he had whirled Simba, and at last dashed it\nto the stone pavement as he had dashed Simba, so that its substance,\ngrown brittle on the passage of the ages, shattered into ten thousand\nfragments.\n\nAt this sight a great groan went up from the men of the White Kendah,\nthe women dressed as goddesses shrieked and tore their robes, and Har\u00fbt,\nwho stood near, fell down in a fit or faint.\n\nOnce more Jana screamed. Then slowly he knelt down, beat his trunk and\nthe clattering metal balls upon the ground thrice, as though he were\nmaking obeisance to the beautiful priestess who stood before him,\nshivered throughout his mighty bulk, and rolled over--dead!\n\n\n\nThe fighting ceased. The Black Kendah, who all this while had been\npressing into the court of the temple, saw and stood stupefied. It was\nas though in the presence of events to them so pregnant and terrible men\ncould no longer lift their swords in war.\n\nA voice called: \"The god is dead! The king is dead! Jana has slain Simba\nand has himself been slain! Shattered is the Child; spilt is the blood\nof Jana! Fly, People of the Black Kendah; fly, for the gods are dead and\nyour land is a land of ghosts!\"\n\nFrom every side was this wail echoed: \"Fly, People of the Black Kendah,\nfor the gods are dead!\"\n\nThey turned; they sped away like shadows, carrying their wounded with\nthem, nor did any attempt to stay them. Thirty minutes later, save for\nsome desperately hurt or dying men, not one of them was left in the\ntemple or the pass beyond. They had all gone, leaving none but the dead\nbehind them.\n\nThe fight was finished! The fight that had seemed lost was won!\n\n\n\nI dragged myself from the ground. As I gained my tottering feet, for now\nthat all was over I felt as if I were made of running water, I saw the\nmen who held Ragnall loose their grip of him. He sprang to where his\nwife was and stood before her as though confused, much as Jana had\nstood, Jana against whose head he rested, his left hand holding to the\nbrute's gigantic tusk, for I think that he also was weak with toil,\nterror, loss of blood and emotion.\n\n\"Luna,\" he gasped, \"Luna!\"\n\nLeaning on the shoulder of a Kendah man, I drew nearer to see what\npassed between them, for my curiosity overcame my faintness. For quite a\nlong while she stared at him, till suddenly her eyes began to change. It\nwas as though a soul were arising in their emptiness as the moon arises\nin the quiet evening sky, giving them light and life. At length she\nspoke in a slow, hesitating voice, the tones of which I remembered well\nenough, saying:\n\n\"Oh! George, that dreadful brute,\" and she pointed to the dead elephant,\n\"has killed our baby. Look at it! Look at it! We must be everything to\neach other now, dear, as we were before it came--unless God sends us\nanother.\"\n\nThen she burst into a flood of weeping and fell into his arms, after\nwhich I turned away. So, to their honour be it said, did the Kendah,\nleaving the pair alone behind the bulk of dead Jana.\n\nHere I may state two things: first, that Lady Ragnall, whose bodily\nhealth had remained perfect throughout, entirely recovered her reason\nfrom that moment. It was as though on the shattering of the Ivory Child\nsome spell had been lifted off her. What this spell may have been I am\nquite unable to explain, but I presume that in a dim and unknown way she\nconnected this effigy with her own lost infant and that while she held\nand tended it her intellect remained in abeyance. If so, she must also\nhave connected its destruction with the death of her own child which,\nstrangely enough, it will be remembered, was likewise killed by an\nelephant. The first death that occurred in her presence took away her\nreason, the second seeming death, which also occurred in her presence,\nbrought it back again!\n\nSecondly, from the moment of the destruction of her boy in the streets\nof the English country town to that of the shattering of the Ivory Child\nin Central Africa her memory was an utter blank, with one exception.\nThis exception was a dream which a few days later she narrated to\nRagnall in my presence. That dream was that she had seen him and Savage\nsleeping together in a native house one night. In view of a certain\nincident recorded in this history I leave the reader to draw his own\nconclusions as to this curious incident. I have none to offer, or if I\nhave I prefer to keep them to myself.\n\nLeaving Ragnall and his wife, I staggered off to look for Hans and found\nhim lying senseless near the north wall of the temple. Evidently he was\nbeyond human help, for Jana seemed to have crushed most of his ribs in\nhis iron trunk. We carried him to one of the priest's cells and there I\nwatched him till the end, which came at sundown.\n\nBefore he died he became quite conscious and talked with me a good deal.\n\n\"Don't grieve about missing Jana, Baas,\" he said, \"for it wasn't you who\nmissed him but some devil that turned your bullets. You see, Baas, he\nwas bewitched against you white men. When you look at him closely you\nwill find that the Lord Igeza missed him also\" (strange as it may seem,\nthis proved to be the case), \"and when you managed to hit the tip of his\ntusk with the last ball the magic was wearing off him, that's all.\nBut, Baas, those Black Kendah wizards forgot to bewitch him against\nthe little yellow man, of whom they took no account. So I hit him sure\nenough every time I fired at him, and I hope he liked the taste of my\nbullets in that great mouth of his. He knew who had sent them there very\nwell. That's why he left you alone and made for me, as I had hoped he\nwould. Oh! Baas, I die happy, quite happy since I have killed Jana and\nhe caught me and not you, me who was nearly finished anyhow. For, Baas,\nthough I didn't say anything about it, a thrown spear struck my groin\nwhen I went down among the Black Kendah this morning. It was only a\nsmall cut, which bled little, but as the fighting went on something gave\nway and my inside began to come through it, though I tied it up with a\nbit of cloth, which of course means death in a day or two.\" (Subsequent\nexamination showed me that Hans's story of this wound was perfectly\ntrue. He could not have lived for very long.)\n\n\"Baas,\" he went on after a pause, \"no doubt I shall meet that Zulu lady\nMameena to-night. Tell me, is she really entitled to the royal salute?\nBecause if not, when I am as much a spook as she is I will not give it\nto her again. She never gave me my titles, which are good ones in their\nway, so why should I give her the _Bay\u00e9te_, unless it is hers by right\nof blood, although I am only a little 'yellow dog' as she chose to call\nme?\"\n\nAs this ridiculous point seemed to weigh upon his mind I told him that\nMameena was not even of royal blood and in nowise entitled to the salute\nof kings.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said with a feeble grin, \"then now I shall know how to deal\nwith her, especially as she cannot pretend that I did not play my part\nin the battle, as she bade me do. Did you see anything of her when Jana\ncharged, Baas, because I thought I did?\"\n\n\"I seemed to see something, but no doubt it was only a fancy.\"\n\n\"A fancy? Explain to me, Baas, where truths end and fancies begin and\nwhether what we think are fancies are not sometimes the real truths.\nOnce or twice I have thought so of late, Baas.\"\n\nI could not answer this riddle, so instead I gave him some water which\nhe asked for, and he continued:\n\n\"Baas, have you any messages for the two Shining ones, for her whose\nname is holy and her sister, and for the child of her whose name is\nholy, the Missie Marie, and for your reverend father, the Predikant? If\nso, tell it quickly before my head grows too empty to hold the words.\"\n\nI will confess, however foolish it may seem, that I gave him certain\nmessages, but what they were I shall not write down. Let them remain\nsecret between me and him. Yes, between me and him and perhaps those to\nwhom they were to be delivered. For after all, in his own words, who\ncan know exactly where fancies end and truth begin, and whether at times\nfancies are not the veritable truths in this universal mystery of which\nthe individual life of each of us is so small a part?\n\nHans repeated what I had spoken to him word for word, as a native does,\nrepeated it twice over, after which he said he knew it by heart and\nremained silent for a long while. Then he asked me to lift him up in\nthe doorway of the cell so that he might look at the sun setting for\nthe last time, \"for, Baas,\" he added, \"I think I am going far beyond the\nsun.\"\n\nHe stared at it for a while, remarking that from the look of the sky\nthere should be fine weather coming, \"which will be good for your\njourney towards the Black Water, Baas, with all that ivory to carry.\"\n\nI answered that perhaps I should never get the ivory from the graveyard\nof the elephants, as the Black Kendah might prevent this.\n\n\"No, no, Baas,\" he replied, \"now that Jana is dead the Black Kendah will\ngo away. I know it, I know it!\"\n\nThen he wandered for a space, speaking of sundry adventures we had\nshared together, till quite before the last indeed, when his mind\nreturned to him.\n\n\"Baas,\" he said, \"did not the captain Mavovo name me Light-in-Darkness,\nand is not that my name? When you too enter the Darkness, look for that\nLight; it will be shining very close to you.\"\n\nHe only spoke once more. His words were:\n\n\"Baas, I understand now what your reverend father, the Predikant, meant\nwhen he spoke to me about Love last night. It had nothing to do with\nwomen, Baas, at least not much. It was something a great deal bigger,\nBaas, something as big as what I feel for you!\"\n\nThen Hans died with a smile on his wrinkled face.\n\nI wept!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nHOMEWARDS\n\nThere is not much more to write of this expedition, or if that statement\nbe not strictly true, not much more that I wish to write, though I have\nno doubt that Ragnall, if he had a mind that way, could make a good and\nvaluable book concerning many matters on which, confining myself to the\nhistory of our adventure, I have scarcely touched. All the affinities\nbetween this Central African Worship of the Heavenly Child and\nits Guardian and that of Horus and Isis in Egypt from which it was\nundoubtedly descended, for instance. Also the part which the great\nserpent played therein, as it may be seen playing a part in every tomb\nupon the Nile, and indeed plays a part in our own and other religions.\nFurther, our journey across the desert to the Red Sea was very\ninteresting, but I am tired of describing journeys--and of making them.\n\nThe truth is that after the death of Hans, like to Queen Sheba when she\nhad surveyed the wonders of Solomon's court, there was no more spirit in\nme. For quite a long while I did not seem to care at all what happened\nto me or to anybody else. We buried him in a place of honour, exactly\nwhere he shot Jana before the gateway of the second court, and when the\nearth was thrown over his little yellow face I felt as though half my\npast had departed with him into that hole. Poor drunken old Hans, where\nin the world shall I find such another man as you were? Where in the\nworld shall I find so much love as filled the cup of that strange heart\nof yours?\n\nI dare say it is a form of selfishness, but what every man desires is\nsomething that cares for him _alone_, which is just why we are so fond\nof dogs. Now Hans was a dog with a human brain and he cared for me\nalone. Often our vanity makes us think that this has happened to some of\nus in the instance of one or more women. But honest and quiet reflection\nmay well cause us to doubt the truth of such supposings. The woman who\nas we believed adored us solely has probably in the course of her career\nadored others, or at any rate other things.\n\nTo take but one instance, that of Mameena, the Zulu lady whom Hans\nthought he saw in the Shades. She, I believe, did me the honour to be\nvery fond of me, but I am convinced that she was fonder still of her\nambition. Now Hans never cared for any living creature, or for any human\nhope or object, as he cared for me. There was no man or woman whom\nhe would not have cheated, or even murdered for my sake. There was no\nearthly advantage, down to that of life itself, that he would not, and\nin the end did not forgo for my sake; witness the case of his little\nfortune which he invested in my rotten gold mine and thought nothing of\nlosing--for my sake.\n\nThat is love _in excelsis_, and the man who has succeeded in inspiring\nit in any creature, even in a low, bibulous, old Hottentot, may feel\nproud indeed. At least I am proud and as the years go by the pride\nincreases, as the hope grows that somewhere in the quiet of that great\nplain which he saw in his dream, I may find the light of Hans's love\nburning like a beacon in the darkness, as he promised I should do, and\nthat it may guide and warm my shivering, new-born soul before I dare the\nadventure of the Infinite.\n\nMeanwhile, since the sublime and the ridiculous are so very near akin,\nI often wonder how he and Mameena settled that question of her right to\nthe royal salute. Perhaps I shall learn one day--indeed already I have\nhad a hint of it. If so, even in the blaze of a new and universal Truth,\nI am certain that their stories will differ wildly.\n\n\n\nHans was quite right about the Black Kendah. They cleared out, probably\nin search of food, where I do not know and I do not care, though whether\nthis were a temporary or permanent move on their part remains, and so\nfar as I am concerned is likely to remain, veiled in obscurity. They\nwere great blackguards, though extraordinarily fine soldiers, and what\nbecame of them is a matter of complete indifference to me. One thing is\ncertain, however, a very large percentage of them never migrated at all,\nfor something over three thousand of their bodies did our people have to\nbury in the pass and about the temple, a purpose for which all the pits\nand trenches we had dug came in very useful. Our loss, by the way, was\nfive hundred and three, including those who died of wounds. It was a\ngreat fight and, except for those who perished in the pitfalls during\nthe first rush, all practically hand to hand.\n\nJana we interred where he fell because we could not move him, within a\nfew feet of the body of his slayer Hans. I have always regretted that\nI did not take the exact measurements of this brute, as I believe the\nrecord elephant of the world, but I had no time to do so and no rule or\ntape at hand. I only saw him for a minute on the following morning, just\nas he was being tumbled into a huge hole, together with the remains of\nhis master, Simba the King. I found, however, that the sole wounds upon\nhim, save some cuts and scratches from spears, were those inflicted by\nHans--namely, the loss of one eye, the puncture through the skin over\nthe heart made when he shot at him for the second time with the little\nrifle Intombi, and two neat holes at the back of the mouth through which\nthe bullets from the elephant gun had driven upwards to the base of the\nbrain, causing his death from h\u00e6morrhage on that organ.\n\nI asked the White Kendah to give me his two enormous tusks, unequalled,\nI suppose, in size and weight in Africa, although one was deformed\nand broken. But they refused. These, I presume, they wished to keep,\ntogether with the chains off his breast and trunk, as mementoes of their\nvictory over the god of their foes. At any rate they hewed the former\nout with axes and removed the latter before tumbling the carcass into\nthe grave. From the worn-down state of the teeth I concluded that this\nbeast must have been extraordinarily old, how old it is impossible to\nsay.\n\nThat is all I have to tell of Jana. May he rest in peace, which\ncertainly he will not do if Hans dwells anywhere in his neighbourhood,\nin the region which the old boy used to call that of the \"fires that\ndo not go out.\" Because of my horrible failure in connection with this\nbeast, the very memory of which humiliates me, I do not like to think of\nit more than I can help.\n\nFor the rest the White Kendah kept faith with us in every particular. In\na curious and semi-religious ceremony, at which I was not present, Lady\nRagnall was absolved from her high office of Guardian or Nurse to a god\nwhereof the symbol no longer existed, though I believe that the priests\ncollected the tiny fragments of ivory, or as many of them as could be\nfound, and preserved them in a jar in the sanctuary. After this had\nbeen done women stripped the Nurse of her hallowed robes, of the ancient\norigin of which, by the way, I believe that none of them, except perhaps\nHar\u00fbt, had any idea, any more than they knew that the Child represented\nthe Egyptian Horus and his lady Guardian the moon-goddess Isis. Then,\ndressed in some native garments, she was handed over to Ragnall and\nthenceforth treated as a stranger-guest, like ourselves, being allowed,\nhowever, to live with her husband in the same house that she had\noccupied during all the period of her strange captivity. Here they abode\ntogether, lost in the mutual bliss of this wonderful reunion to which\nthey had attained through so much bodily and spiritual darkness and\nmisery, until a month or so later we started upon our journey across the\nmountains and the great desert that lay beyond them.\n\nOnly once did I find any real opportunity of private conversation with\nLady Ragnall.\n\nThis happened after her husband had recovered from the hurts he received\nin the battle, on an occasion when he was obliged to separate from her\nfor a day in order to attend to some matter in the Town of the Child.\nI think it had to do with the rifles used in the battle, which he had\npresented to the White Kendah. So, leaving me to look after her, he\nwent, unwillingly enough, who seemed to hate losing sight of his wife\neven for an hour.\n\nI took her for a walk in the wood, to that very point indeed on the lip\nof the crater whence we had watched her play her part as priestess at\nthe Feast of the First-fruits. After we had stood there a while we went\ndown among the great cedars, trying to retrace the last part of our\nmarch through the darkness of that anxious night, whereof now for the\nfirst time I told her all the story.\n\nGrowing tired of scrambling among the fallen boughs, at length Lady\nRagnall sat down and said:\n\n\"Do you know, Mr. Quatermain, these are the first words we have really\nhad since that party at Ragnall before I was married, when, as you may\nhave forgotten, you took me in to dinner.\"\n\nI replied that there was nothing I recollected much more clearly, which\nwas both true and the right thing to say, or so I supposed.\n\n\"Well,\" she said slowly, \"you see that after all there was something in\nthose fancies of mine which at the time you thought would best be dealt\nwith by a doctor--about Africa and the rest, I mean.\"\n\n\"Yes, Lady Ragnall, though of course we should always remember that\ncoincidence accounts for many things. In any case they are done with\nnow.\"\n\n\"Not quite, Mr. Quatermain, even as you mean, since we have still a long\nway to go. Also in another sense I believe that they are but begun.\"\n\n\"I do not understand, Lady Ragnall.\"\n\n\"Nor do I, but listen. You know that of anything which happened during\nthose months I have no memory at all, except of that one dream when I\nseemed to see George and Savage in the hut. I remember my baby being\nkilled by that horrible circus elephant, just as the Ivory Child was\nkilled or rather destroyed by Jana, which I suppose is another of your\ncoincidences, Mr. Quatermain. After that I remember nothing until I woke\nup and saw George standing in front of me covered with blood, and you,\nand Jana dead, and the rest.\"\n\n\"Because during that time your mind was gone, Lady Ragnall.\"\n\n\"Yes, but where had it gone? I tell you, Mr. Quatermain, that although\nI remember nothing of what was passing about me then, I do remember a\ngreat deal of what seemed to be passing either long ago or in some time\nto come, though I have said nothing of it to George, as I hope you will\nnot either. It might upset him.\"\n\n\"What do you remember?\" I asked.\n\n\"That's the trouble; I can't tell you. What was once very clear to me\nhas for the most part become vague and formless. When my mind tries to\ngrasp it, it slips away. It was another life to this, quite a different\nlife; and there was a great story in it of which I think what we have\nbeen going through is either a sequel or a prologue. I see, or saw,\ncities and temples with people moving about them, George and you among\nthem, also that old priest, Har\u00fbt. You will laugh, but my recollection\nis that you stood in some relationship to me, either that of father or\nbrother.\"\n\n\"Or perhaps a cousin,\" I suggested.\n\n\"Or perhaps a cousin,\" she repeated, smiling, \"or a great friend; at any\nrate something very intimate. As for George, I don't know what he was,\nor Har\u00fbt either. But the odd thing is that little yellow man, Hans, whom\nI only saw once living for a few minutes that I can remember, comes more\nclearly back to my mind than any of you. He was a dwarf, much stouter\nthan when I saw him the other day, but very like. I recall him curiously\ndressed with feathers and holding an ivory rod, seated upon a stool\nat the feet of a great personage--a king, I think. The king asked him\nquestions, and everyone listened to his answers. That is all, except\nthat the scenes seemed to be flooded with sunlight.\"\n\n\"Which is more than this place is. I think we had better be moving, Lady\nRagnall, or you will catch a chill under these damp cedars.\"\n\nI said this because I did not wish to pursue the conversation. I\nconsidered it too exciting under all her circumstances, especially as I\nperceived that mystical look gathering on her face and in her beautiful\neyes, which I remembered noting before she was married.\n\nShe read my thoughts and answered with a laugh:\n\n\"Yes, it is damp; but you know I am very strong and damp will not hurt\nme. For the rest you need not be afraid, Mr. Quatermain. I did not lose\nmy mind. It was taken from me by some power and sent to live elsewhere.\nNow it has been given back and I do not think it will be taken again in\nthat way.\"\n\n\"Of course it won't,\" I exclaimed confidently. \"Whoever dreamed of such\na thing?\"\n\n\"_You_ did,\" she answered, looking me in the eyes. \"Now before we go I\nwant to say one more thing. Har\u00fbt and the head priestess have made me a\npresent. They have given me a box full of that herb they called tobacco,\nbut of which I have discovered the real name is Taduki. It is the same\nthat they burned in the bowl when you and I saw visions at Ragnall\nCastle, which visions, Mr. Quatermain, by another of your coincidences,\nhave since been translated into facts.\"\n\n\"I know. We saw you breathe that smoke again as priestess when you\nuttered the prophecy as Oracle of the Child at the Feast of the\nFirst-fruits. But what are you going to do with this stuff, Lady\nRagnall? I think you have had enough of visions just at present.\"\n\n\"So do I, though to tell you the truth I like them. I am going to keep\nit and do nothing--as yet. Still, I want you always to remember one\nthing--don't laugh at me\"--here again she looked me in the eyes--\"that\nthere is a time coming, some way off I think, when I and you--no one\nelse, Mr. Quatermain--will breathe that smoke again together and see\nstrange things.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" I replied, \"I have given up tobacco of the Kendah variety; it\nis too strong for me.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" she said, \"for something that is stronger than the Kendah\ntobacco will make you do it--when I wish.\"\n\n\"Did Har\u00fbt tell you that, Lady Ragnall?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she answered confusedly. \"I think the Ivory Child\ntold me; it used to talk to me often. You know that Child isn't really\ndestroyed. Like my reason that seemed to be lost, it has only gone\nbackwards or forwards where you and I shall see it again. You and I and\nno others--unless it be the little yellow man. I repeat that I do not\nknow when that will be. Perhaps it is written in those rolls of papyrus,\nwhich they have given me also, because they said they belonged to me\nwho am 'the first priestess and the last.' They told me, however, or\nperhaps,\" she added, passing her hand across her forehead, \"it was the\nChild who told me, that I was not to attempt to read them or have them\nread, until after a great change in my life. What the change will be I\ndo not know.\"\n\n\"And had better not inquire, Lady Ragnall, since in this world most\nchanges are for the worse.\"\n\n\"I agree, and shall not inquire. Now I have spoken to you like this\nbecause I felt that I must do so. Also I want to thank you for all you\nhave done for me and George. Probably we shall not talk in such a way\nagain; as I am situated the opportunity will be lacking, even if the\nwish is present. So once more I thank you from my heart. Until we meet\nagain--I mean really meet--good-bye,\" and she held her right hand to me\nin such a fashion that I knew she meant me to kiss it.\n\nThis I did very reverently and we walked back to the temple almost in\nsilence.\n\n\n\nThat month of rest, or rather the last three weeks of it, since for the\nfirst few days after the battle I was quite prostrate, I occupied in\nvarious ways, amongst others in a journey with Har\u00fbt to Simba Town. This\nwe made after our spies had assured us that the Black Kendah were\nreally gone somewhere to the south-west, in which direction fertile and\nunoccupied lands were said to exist about three hundred miles away. It\nwas with very strange feelings that I retraced our road and looked once\nmore upon that wind-bent tree still scored with the marks of Jana's\nhuge tusk, in the boughs of which Hans and I had taken refuge from the\nmonster's fury. Crossing the river, quite low now, I travelled up the\nslope down which we raced for our lives and came to the melancholy lake\nand the cemetery of dead elephants.\n\nHere all was unchanged. There was the little mount worn by his feet, on\nwhich Jana was wont to stand. There were the rocks behind which I had\ntried to hide, and near to them some crushed human bones which I knew to\nbe those of the unfortunate Mar\u00fbt. These we buried with due reverence on\nthe spot where he had fallen, I meanwhile thanking God that my own bones\nwere not being interred at their side, as but for Hans would have been\nthe case--if they were ever interred at all. All about lay the skeletons\nof dead elephants, and from among these we collected as much of the best\nivory as we could carry, namely about fifty camel loads. Of course there\nwas much more, but a great deal of the stuff had been exposed for so\nlong to sun and weather that it was almost worthless.\n\nHaving sent this ivory back to the Town of the Child, which was being\nrebuilt after a fashion, we went on to Simba Town through the forest,\ndispatching pickets ahead of us to search and make sure that it was\nempty. Empty it was indeed; never did I see such a place of desolation.\n\nThe Black Kendah had left it just as it stood, except for a pile of\ncorpses which lay around and over the altar in the market-place, where\nthe three poor camelmen were sacrificed to Jana, doubtless those of\nwounded men who had died during or after the retreat. The doors of the\nhouses stood open, many domestic articles, such as great jars resembling\nthat which had been set over the head of the dead man whom we were\ncommanded to restore life, and other furniture lay about because they\ncould not be carried away. So did a great quantity of spears and various\nweapons of war, whose owners being killed would never want them again.\nExcept a few starved dogs and jackals no living creature remained in the\ntown. It was in its own way as waste and even more impressive than the\ngraveyard of elephants by the lonely lake.\n\n\"The curse of the Child worked well,\" said Har\u00fbt to me grimly. \"First,\nthe storm; the hunger; then the battle; and now the misery of flight and\nruin.\"\n\n\"It seems so,\" I answered. \"Yet that curse, like others, came back to\nroost, for if Jana is dead and his people fled, where are the Child and\nmany of its people? What will you do without your god, Har\u00fbt?\"\n\n\"Repent us of our sins and wait till the Heavens send us another, as\ndoubtless they will in their own season,\" he replied very sadly.\n\nI wonder whether they ever did and, if so, what form that new divinity\nput on.\n\nI slept, or rather did not sleep, that night in the same guest-house in\nwhich Mar\u00fbt and I had been imprisoned during our dreadful days of fear,\nreconstructing in my mind every event connected with them. Once more I\nsaw the fires of sacrifice flaring upon the altar and heard the roar of\nthe dancing hail that proclaimed the ruin of the Black Kendah as loudly\nas the trumpet of a destroying angel. Very glad was I when the morning\ncame at length and, having looked my last upon Simba Town, I crossed\nthe moats and set out homewards through the forest whereof the stripped\nboughs also spoke of death, though in the spring these would grow green\nagain.\n\nTen days later we started from the Holy Mount, a caravan of about a\nhundred camels, of which fifty were laden with the ivory and the rest\nridden by our escort under the command of Har\u00fbt and our three selves.\nBut there was an evil fate upon this ivory, as on everything else that\nhad to do with Jana. Some weeks later in the desert a great sandstorm\novertook us in which we barely escaped with our lives. At the height of\nthe storm the ivory-laden camels broke loose, flying before it. Probably\nthey fell and were buried beneath the sand; at any rate of the fifty we\nonly recovered ten.\n\nRagnall wished to pay me the value of the remaining loads, which ran\ninto thousands of pounds, but I would not take the money, saying it\nwas outside our bargain. Sometimes since then I have thought that I\nwas foolish, especially when on glancing at that codicil to his will in\nafter days, the same which he had given me before the battle, I found\nthat he had set me down for a legacy of \u00a310,000. But in such matters\nevery man must follow his own instinct.\n\nThe White Kendah, an unemotional people especially now when they were\nmourning for their lost god and their dead, watched us go without any\ndemonstration of affection, or even of farewell. Only those priestesses\nwho had attended upon the person of Lady Ragnall while she played a\ndivine part among them wept when they parted from her, and uttered\nprayers that they might meet her again \"in the presence of the Child.\"\n\nThe pass through the great mountains proved hard to climb, as the\nfoothold for the camels was bad. But we managed it at last, most of the\nway on foot, pausing a little while on their crest to look our last for\never at the land which we had left, where the Mount of the Child was\nstill dimly visible. Then we descended their farther slope and entered\nthe northern desert.\n\nDay after day and week after week we travelled across that endless\ndesert by a way known to Har\u00fbt on which water could be found, the only\nliving things in all its vastness, meeting with no accidents save that\nof the sandstorm in which the ivory was lost. I was much alone during\nthat time, since Har\u00fbt spoke little and Ragnall and his wife were\nwrapped up in each other.\n\nAt length, months later, we struck a little port on the Red Sea, of\nwhich I forget the Arab name, a place as hot as the infernal regions.\nShortly afterwards, by great good luck, two trading vessels put in for\nwater, one bound for Aden, in which I embarked en route for Natal, and\nthe other for the port of Suez, whence Ragnall and his wife could travel\noverland to Alexandria.\n\nOur parting was so hurried at the last, as is often the way after long\nfellowship, that beyond mutual thanks and good wishes we said little\nto one another. I can see them now standing with their arms about each\nother watching me disappear. Concerning their future there is so much\nto tell that of it I shall say nothing; at any rate here and now, except\nthat Lady Ragnall was right. We did not part for the last time.\n\nAs I shook old Har\u00fbt's hand in farewell he told me that he was going on\nto Egypt, and I asked him why.\n\n\"Perchance to look for another god, Lord Macumazana,\" he answered\ngravely, \"whom now there is no Jana to destroy. We may speak of that\nmatter if we should meet again.\"\n\nSuch are some of the things that I remember about this journey, but to\ntell truth I paid little attention to them and many others.\n\nFor oh! my heart was sore because of Hans.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Ivory Child, by H.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
