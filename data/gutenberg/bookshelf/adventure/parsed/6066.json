Those\nwho stand in their way and pretend to help them with a flood of words\nare a host. And from the host goes up an endless cry that India is the\nhome of thugs, and of three hundred million hungry ones.\n\nThe men who know--and Athelstan King might claim to know a\nlittle--answer that she is the original home of chivalry and the modern\nmistress of as many decent, gallant, native gentlemen as ever graced a\npage of history.\n\nThe charge has seen the light in print that India--well-spring of\nplague and sudden death and money-lenders--has sold her soul to twenty\nsucceeding conquerors in turn.\n\nAthelstan King and a hundred like him whom India has picked from British\nstock and taught, can answer truly that she has won it back again from\neach by very purity of purpose.\n\nSo when the world war broke the world was destined to be surprised on\nIndia's account. The Red Sea, full of racing transports crowded with\ndark-skinned gentlemen, whose one prayer was that the war might not be\nover before they should have struck a blow for Britain, was the Indian\narmy's answer to the press.\n\nThe rest of India paid its taxes and contributed and muzzled itself and\nset to work to make supplies. For they understand in India, almost as\nnowhere else, the meaning of such old-fashioned words as gratitude and\nhonor; and of such platitudes as, \"Give and it shall be given unto you.\"\n\nMore than one nation was deeply shocked by India's answer to \"practises\"\nthat had extended over years. But there were men in India who learned to\nlove India long ago with that love that casts out fear, who knew exactly\nwhat was going to happen and could therefore afford to wait for orders\ninstead of running round in rings.\n\nAthelstan King, for instance, nothing yet but a captain unattached, sat\nin meagerly furnished quarters with his heels on a table. He is not a\ndoctor, yet he read a book on surgery, and when he went over to the club\nhe carried the book under his arm and continued to read it there. He is\nconsidered a rotten conversationalist, and he did nothing at the club to\nimprove his reputation.\n\n\"Man alive--get a move on!\" gasped a wondering senior, accepting a\ncigar. Nobody knows where he gets those long, strong, black cheroots,\nand nobody ever refuses one.\n\n\"Thanks--got a book to read,\" said King.\n\n\"You ass! Wake up and grab the best thing in sight, as a stepping stone\nto something better! Wake up and worry!\"\n\nKing grinned. You have to when you don't agree with a senior officer,\nfor the army is like a school in many more ways than one.\n\n\"Help yourself, sir! I'll take the job that's left when the scramble's\nover. Something good's sure to be overlooked.\"\n\n\"White feather? Laziness? Dark Horse?\" the major wondered. Then he\nhurried away to write telegrams, because a belief thrives in the early\ndays of any war that influence can make or break a man's chances. In\nthe other room where the telegraph blanks were littered in confusion\nall about the floor, he ran into a crony whose chief sore point was\nAthelstan King, loathing him as some men loathe pickles or sardines, for\nno real reason whatever, except that they are what they are.\n\n\"Saw you talking to King,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes. Can't make him out. Rum fellow!\"\n\n\"Rum? Huh! Trouble is he's seventh of his family in succession to serve\nin India. She has seeped into him and pickled his heritage. He's a\nbeliever in Kismet crossed on to Opportunity. Not sure he doesn't pray\nto Allah on the sly! Hopeless case.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Quite!\"\n\nSo they all sent telegrams and forgot King who sat and smoked and read\nabout surgery; and before he had nearly finished one box of cheroots\na general at Peshawur wiped a bald red skull and sent him an urgent\ntelegram.\n\n\"Come at once!\" it said simply.\n\nKing was at Lahore, but miles don't matter when the dogs of war are\nloosed. The right man goes to the right place at the exact right time\nthen, and the fool goes to the wall. In that one respect war is better\nthan some kinds of peace.\n\nIn the train on the way to Peshawur he did not talk any more volubly,\nand a fellow traveler, studying him from the opposite corner of the\nstifling compartment, catalogued him as \"quite an ordinary man.\" But he\nwas of the Public Works Department, which is sorrowfully underpaid and\nwears emotions on its sleeve for policy's sake, believing of course that\nall the rest of the world should do the same.\n\n\"Don't you think we're bound in honor to go to Belgium's aid?\" he asked.\n\"Can you see any way out of it?\"\n\n\"Haven't looked for one,\" said King.\n\n\"But don't you think--\"\n\n\"No,\" said King. \"I hardly ever think. I'm in the army, don't you know,\nand don't have to. What's the use of doing somebody else's work?\"\n\n\"Rotter!\" thought the P.W.D. man, almost aloud; but King was not\ntroubled by any further forced conversation. Consequently he reached\nPeshawur comfortable, in spite of the heat. And his genial manner\nof saluting the full-general who met him with a dog-cart at Peshawur\nstation was something scandalous.\n\n\"Is he a lunatic or a relative or royalty?\" the P.W.D. man wondered.\n\nFull-generals, particularly in the early days of war, do not drive\nto the station to meet captains very often; yet King climbed into the\ndog-cart unexcitedly, after keeping the general waiting while he checked\na trunk!\n\nThe general cracked his whip without any other comment than a smile.\nA blood mare tore sparks out of the macadam, and a dusty military road\nbegan to ribbon out between the wheels. Sentries in unexpected places\nannounced themselves with a ring of shaken steel as their rifles came to\nthe \"present,\" which courtesies the general noticed with a raised whip.\nThen a fox-terrier resumed his chase of squirrels between the planted\nshade-trees, and Peshawur became normal, shimmering in light and heat\nreflected from the \"Hills.\"\n\n(The P.W.D. man, who would have giggled if a general mentioned him by\nname, walked because no conveyance could be hired. Judgment was in the\nwind.)\n\nOn the dog-cart's high front seat, staring straight ahead of him between\nthe horse's ears, King listened. The general did nearly all the talking.\n\n\"The North's the danger.\"\n\nKing grunted with the lids half-lowered over full dark eyes. He did not\nlook especially handsome in that attitude. Some men swear he looks like\na Roman, and others liken him to a gargoyle, all of them choosing to\nignore the smile that can transform his whole face instantly.\n\n\"We're denuding India of troops--not keeping back more than a mere\nhandful to hold the tribes in check.\"\n\nKing nodded. There has never been peace along the northwest border. It\ndid not need vision to foresee trouble from that quarter. In fact it\nmust have been partly on the strength of some of King's reports that the\ngeneral was planning now.\n\n\"That was a very small handful of Sikhs you named as likely to give\ntrouble. Did you do that job thoroughly?\"\n\nKing grunted.\n\n\"Well--Delhi's chock-full of spies, all listening to stories made in\nGermany for them to take back to the 'Hills' with 'em. The tribes'll\nknow presently how many men we're sending oversea. There've been rumors\nabout Khinjan by the hundred lately. They're cooking something. Can you\nimagine 'em keeping quiet now?\"\n\n\"That depends, sir. Yes, I can imagine it.\"\n\nThe general laughed. \"That's why I sent for you. I need a man with\nimagination! There's a woman you've got to work with on this occasion\nwho can imagine a shade or two too much. What's worse, she's ambitious.\nSo I chose you to work with her.\"\n\nKing's lips stiffened under his mustache, and the corners of his eyes\nwrinkled into crow's-feet to correspond. Eyes are never coal-black, of\ncourse, but his looked it at that minute.\n\n\"You know we've sent men to Khinjan who are said to have entered the\nCaves. Not one of 'em has ever returned.\"\n\nKing frowned.\n\n\"She claims she can enter the Caves and come out again at pleasure. She\nhas offered to do it, and I have accepted.\"\n\nIt would not have been polite to look incredulous, so King's expression\nchanged to one of intense interest a little overdone, as the general did\nnot fail to notice.\n\n\"If she hadn't given proof of devotion and ability, I'd have turned\nher down. But she has. Only the other day she uncovered a plot in\nDelhi--about a million dynamite bombs in a ruined temple in charge of a\nGerman agent for use by mutineers supposed to be ready to rise against\nus. Fact! Can you guess who she is?\"\n\n\"Not Yasmini?\" King hazarded, and the general nodded and flicked his\nwhip. The horse mistook it for a signal, and it was two minutes before\nthe speed was reduced to mere recklessness.\n\nThe helmet-strap mark, printed indelibly on King's jaw and cheek by the\nIndian sun, tightened and grew whiter--as the general noted out of the\ncorner of his eye.\n\n\"Know her?\"\n\n\"Know of her, of course, sir. Everybody does. Never met her to my\nknowledge.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m! Whose fault was that? Somebody ought to have seen to that. Go\nto Delhi now and meet her. I'll send her a wire to say you're coming.\nShe knows I've chosen you. She tried to insist on full discretion, but\nI overruled her. Between us two, she'll have discretion once she gets\nbeyond Jamrud. The 'Hills' are full of our spies, of course, but none\nof 'em dare try Khinjan Caves any more and you'll be the only check we\nshall have on her.\"\n\nKing's tongue licked his lips, and his eyes wrinkled. The general's\nvoice became the least shade more authoritative.\n\n\"When you see her, get a pass from her that'll take you into Khinjan\nCaves! Ask her for it! For the sake of appearances I'll gazette you\nSeconded to the Khyber Rifles. For the sake of success, get a pass from\nher!\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\"\n\n\"You've a brother in the Khyber Rifles, haven't you? Was it you or your\nbrother who visited Khinjan once and sent in a report?\"\n\n\"I did, sir.\"\n\nHe spoke without pride. Even the brigade of British-Indian cavalry that\nwent to Khinjan on the strength of his report and leveled its defenses\nwith the ground, had not been able to find the famous Caves. Yet the\nCaves themselves are a by-word.\n\n\"There's talk of a jihad (holy war). There's worse than that! When you\nwent to Khinjan, what was your chief object?\"\n\n\"To find the source of the everlasting rumors about the so-called 'Heart\nof the Hills,' sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. I remember. I read your report. You didn't find anything, did\nyou? Well. The story is now that the 'Heart of the Hills' has come to\nlife. So the spies say.\"\n\nKing whistled softly.\n\n\"There's no guessing what it means,\" said the general. \"Go and find\nout. Go and work with Yasmini. I shall have enough men here to attack\ninstantly and smash any small force as soon as it begins to gather\nanywhere near the border. But Khinjan is another story. We can't prove\nanything, but the spies keep bringing in rumors of ten thousand men in\nKhinjan Caves, and of another large lashkar not far away from Khinjan.\nThere must be no jihad, King! India is all but defenseless! We can\ntackle sporadic raids. We can even handle an ordinary raid in force. But\nthis story about a 'Heart of the Hills' coming to life may presage unity\nof action and a holy war such as the world has not seen. Go up there and\nstop it if you can. At least, let me know the facts.\"\n\nKing grunted. To stop a holy war single-handed would be rather like\nstopping the wind--possibly easy enough, if one knew the way. Yet\nhe knew no general would throw away a man like himself on a useless\nventure. He began to look happy.\n\nThe general clucked to the mare and the big beast sank an inch between\nthe shafts. The sais behind set his feet against the drop-board and\nclung with both hands to the seat. One wheel ceased to touch the gravel\nas they whirled along a semicircular drive. Suddenly the mare drew up\non her haunches, under the porch of a pretentious residence. Sentries\nsaluted. The sais swung down. In less than sixty seconds King was\nfollowing the general through a wide entrance into a crowded hall. The\ninstant the general's fat figure darkened the doorway twenty men of\nhigher rank than King, native and English, rose from lined-up chairs and\npressed forward.\n\n\"Sorry--have to keep you all waiting--busy!\" He waved them aside with a\nlittle apologetic gesture. \"Come in here, King.\"\n\nKing followed him through a door that slammed tight behind them on\nrubber jambs.\n\n\"Sit down!\"\n\nThe general unlocked a steel drawer and began to rummage among the\npapers in it. In a minute he produced a package, bound in rubber bands,\nwith a faded photograph face-upward on the top.\n\n\"That's the woman! How d'you like the look of her?\"\n\nKing took the package and for a minute stared hard at the likeness of a\nwoman whose fame has traveled up and down India, until her witchery\nhas become a proverb. She was dressed as a dancing woman, yet very few\ndancing women could afford to be dressed as she was.\n\nKing's service uses whom it may, and he had met and talked with many\ndancing women in the course of duty; but as he stared at Yasmini's\nlikeness he did not think he had ever met one who so measured up to\nrumor. The nautch he knew for a delusion. Yet--!\n\nThe general watched his face with eyes that missed nothing.\n\n\"Remember--I said work with her!\"\n\nKing looked up and nodded.\n\n\"They say she's three parts Russian,\" said the general. \"To my own\nknowledge she speaks Russian like a native, and about twenty other\ntongues as well, including English. She speaks English as well as you or\nI. She was the girl-widow of a rascally Hill-rajah. There's a story I've\nheard, to the effect that Russia arranged her marriage in the day when\nIndia was Russia's objective--and that's how long ago?--seems like\nweeks, not years! I've heard she loved her rajah. And I've heard she\ndidn't! There's another story that she poisoned him. I know she got\naway with his money--and that's proof enough of brains! Some say she's\na she-devil. I think that's an exaggeration, but bear in mind she's\ndangerous!\"\n\nKing grinned. A man who trusts Eastern women over readily does not rise\nfar in the Secret Service.\n\n\"If you've got nous enough to keep on her soft side and use her--not let\nher use you--you can keep the 'Hills' quiet and the Khyber safe! If\nyou can contrive that--now--in this pinch--there's no limit for you!\nCommander-in-chief shall be your job before you're sixty!\"\n\nKing pocketed the photograph and papers. \"I'm well enough content, sir,\nas things are,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"Well, remember she's ambitious, even if you're not! I'm not preaching\nambition, mind--I'm warning you! Ambition's bad! Study those papers on\nyour way down to Delhi and see that I get them back.\"\n\nThe general paced once across the room and once back again, with hands\nbehind him. Then he stopped in front of King.\n\n\"No man in India has a stiffer task than you have now! It may encourage\nyou to know that I realize that! She's the key to the puzzle, and she\nhappens to be in Delhi. Go to Delhi, then. A jihad launched from the\n'Hills' would mean anarchy in the plains. That would entail sending\nback from France an army that can't be spared. There must be no jihad,\nKing!--There must--not--be--one! Keep that in your head!\"\n\n\"What arrangements have been made with her, sir?\"\n\n\"Practically none! She's watching the spies in Delhi, but they're likely\nto break for the 'Hills' any minute. Then they'll be arrested. When that\nhappens the fate of India may be in your hands and hers! Get out of my\nway now, until tiffin-time!\"\n\nIn a way that some men never learn, King proceeded to efface himself\nentirely among the crowd in the hall, contriving to say nothing of any\naccount to anybody until the great gong boomed and the general led\nthem all in to his long dining table. Yet he did not look furtive\nor secretive. Nobody noticed him, and he noticed everybody. There is\nnothing whatever secretive about that.\n\nThe fare was plain, and the meal a perfunctory affair. The general and\nhis guests were there for other reason than to eat food, and only the\nman who happened to seat himself next to King--a major by the name of\nHyde--spoke to him at all.\n\n\"Why aren't you with your regiment?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because the general asked me to lunch, sir!\"\n\n\"I suppose you've been pestering him for an appointment!\"\n\nKing, with his mouth full of curr did not answer, but his eyes smiled.\n\n\"It's astonishing to me,\" said the major, \"that a captain should leave\nhis company when war has begun! When I was captain I'd have been driven\nout of the service if I'd asked for leave of absence at such a time!\"\n\nKing made no comment, but his expression denoted belief.\n\n\"Are you bound for the front, sir?\" he asked presently. But Hyde did not\nanswer. They finished the meal in silence.\n\nAfter lunch he was closeted with the general again for twenty minutes.\nThen one of the general's carriages took him to the station; and it did\nnot appear to trouble him at all that the other occupant of the carriage\nwas the self-same Major Hyde who had sat next him at lunch. In fact, he\nsmiled so pleasantly that Hyde grew exasperated. Neither of them spoke.\nAt the station Hyde lost his temper openly, and King left him abusing an\nunhappy native servant.\n\nThe station was crammed to suffocation by a crowd that roared and\nwrithed and smelt to high heaven. At one end of the platform, in the\nmidst of a human eddy, a frenzied horse resisted with his teeth and all\nfour feet at once the efforts of six natives and a British sergeant to\nforce him into a loose-box. At the back of the same platform the little\ndark-brown mules of a mountain battery twitched their flanks in line,\njingling chains and stamping when the flies bit home.\n\nFlies buzzed everywhere. Fat native merchants vied with lean and timid\nones in noisy effort to secure accommodation on a train already crowded\nto the limit. Twenty British officers hunted up and down for the places\nsupposed to have been reserved for them, and sweating servants hurried\nafter them with arms full of heterogeneous baggage, swearing at\nthe crowd that swore back ungrudgingly. But the general himself had\ntelephoned for King's reservation, so he took his time.\n\nThere were din and stink and dust beneath a savage sun, shaken into\nreverberations by the scream of an engine's safety valve. It was India\nin essence and awake!--India arising out of lethargy!--India as she is\nmore often nowadays--and it made King, for the time being of the Khyber\nRifles, happier than some other men can be in ballrooms.\n\nAny one who watched him--and there was at least one man who did--must\nhave noticed his strange ability, almost like that of water, to reach\nthe point he aimed for, through, and not around, the crowd.\n\nHe neither shoved nor argued. Orders and blows would have been equally\nuseless, for had it tried the crowd could not have obeyed, and it was in\nno mind to try. Without the least apparent effort he arrived--and\nthere is no other word that quite describes it--he arrived, through\nthe densest part of the sweating throng of humans, at the door of the\nluggage office.\n\nThere, though a bunnia's sharp elbow nagged his ribs, and the bunnia's\nservant dropped a heavy package on his foot, he smiled so genially that\nhe melted the wrath of the frantic luggage clerk. But not at once. Even\nthe sun needs seconds to melt ice.\n\n\"Am I God?\" the babu wailed. \"Can I do all the-e things in all the-e\nworld at once if not sooner?\"\n\nKing's smile began to get its work in. The man ceased gesticulating to\nwipe sweat from his stubbly jowl with the end of a Punjabi headdress. He\nactually smiled back. Who was he, that he should suspect new outrage or\nguess he was about to be used in a game he did not understand? He would\nhave stopped all work to beg for extra pay at the merest suggestion of\nsuch a thing; but as it was he raised both fists and lapsed into his own\ntongue to apostrophize the ruffian who dared jostle King. A Northerner\nwho did not seem to understand Punjabi almost cost King his balance as\nhe thrust broad shoulders between him and the bunnia.\n\nThe bunnia chattered like an outraged ape; but King, the person most\nentitled to be angry, actually apologized! That being a miracle, the\nbabu forthwith wrought another one, and within a minute King's one trunk\nwas checked through to Delhi.\n\n\"Delhi is right, sahib?\" he asked, to make doubly sure; for in India\nwhere the milk of human kindness is not hawked in the market-place, men\nwill pay over-measure for a smile.\n\n\"Yes. Delhi is right. Thank you, babuji.\"\n\nHe made more room for the Hillman, beaming amusement at the man's\nimpatience; but the Hillman had no luggage and turned away, making an\nunexpected effort to hide his face with a turban end. He who had forced\nhis way to the front with so much violence and haste now burst back\nagain toward the train like a football forward tearing through the thick\nof his opponents. He scattered a swath a yard wide, for he had shoulders\nlike a bull. King saw him leap into third-class carriage. He saw, too,\nthat he was not wanted in the carriage. There was a storm of protest\nfrom tight-packed native passengers, but the fellow had his way.\n\nThe swath through the crowd closed up like water in a ship's wake, but\nit opened again for King. He smiled so humorously that the angry jostled\nones smiled too and were appeased, forgetting haste and bruises and\nindignity merely because understanding looked at them through merry\neyes. All crowds are that way, but an Indian crowd more so than all.\n\nTaking his time, and falling foul of nobody, King marked down a native\nconstable--hot and unhappy, leaning with his back against the train. He\ntouched him on the shoulder and the fellow jumped.\n\n\"Nay, sahib! I am only constabeel--I know nothing--I can do nothing! The\nteerain goes when it goes, and then perhaps we will beat these people\nfrom the platform and make room again! But there is no authority--no law\nany more--they are all gone mad!\"\n\nKing wrote on a pad, tore off a sheet, folded it and gave it to him.\n\n\"That is for the Superintendent of Police at the office. Carriage number\n1181, eleven doors from here--the one with the shut door and a big\nHillman inside sitting three places from the door facing the engine.\nGet the Hillman! No, there is only one Hillman in the carriage. No, the\nothers are not his friends; they will not help him. He will fight, but\nhe has no friends in that carriage.\"\n\nThe \"constabeel\" obeyed, not very cheerfully. King stood to watch him\nwith a foot on the step of a first-class coach. Another constable passed\nhim, elbowing a snail's progress between the train and the crowd. He\nseized the man's arm.\n\n\"Go and help that man!\" he ordered. \"Hurry!\"\n\nThen he climbed into the carriage and leaned from the window. He grinned\nas he saw both constables pounce on a third-class carriage door and,\nwith the yell of good huntsmen who have viewed, seize the protesting\nNortherner by the leg and begin to drag him forth. There was a fight,\nthat lasted three minutes, in the course of which a long knife flashed.\nBut there were plenty to help take the knife away, and the Hillman stood\nhandcuffed and sullen at last, while one of his captors bound a cut\nforearm. Then they dragged him away; but not before he had seen King at\nthe window, and had lipped a silent threat.\n\n\"I believe you, my son!\" King chuckled, half aloud. \"I surely believe\nyou! I'll watch! Ham dekta hai!\"\n\n\"Why was that man arrested?\" asked an acid voice behind him; and without\ntroubling to turn his head, he knew that Major Hyde was to be\nhis carriage mate again. To be vindictive, on duty or off it, is\nfoolishness; but to let opportunity slip by one is a crime. He looked\nglad, not sorry, as he faced about--pleased, not disappointed--like a\nman on a desert island who has found a tool.\n\n\"Why was that man arrested?\" the major asked again.\n\n\"I ordered it,\" said King.\n\n\"So I imagined. I asked you why.\"\n\nKing stared at him and then turned to watch the prisoner being dragged\naway; he was fighting again, striking at his captors' heads with\nhandcuffed wrists.\n\n\"Does he look innocent?\" asked King.\n\n\"Is that your answer?\" asked the major. Balked ambition is an ugly horse\nto ride. He had tried for a command but had been shelved.\n\n\"I have sufficient authority,\" said King, unruffled. He spoke as if he\nwere thinking of something entirely different. His eyes were as if they\nsaw the major from a very long way off and rather approved of him on the\nwhole.\n\n\"Show me your authority, please!\"\n\nKing dived into an inner pocket and produced a card that had about ten\nwords written on its face, above a general's signature. Hyde read it and\npassed it back.\n\n\"So you're one of those, are you!\" he said in a tone of voice that would\nstart a fight in some parts of the world and in some services. But\nKing nodded cheerfully, and that annoyed the major more than ever; he\nsnorted, closed his mouth with a snap and turned to rearrange the sheet\nand pillow on his berth.\n\nThen the train pulled out, amid a din of voices from the left--behind\nthat nearly drowned the panting of overloaded engine. There was a roar\nof joy from the two coaches full of soldiers in the rear--a shriek from\na woman who had missed the train--a babel of farewells tossed back and\nforth between the platform and the third-class carriages--and Peshawur\nfell away behind.\n\nKing settled down on his side of the compartment, after a struggle with\nthe thermantidote that refused to work. There was heat enough below the\nroof to have roasted meat, so that the physical atmosphere became as\nturgid as the mental after a little while.\n\nHyde all but stripped himself and drew on striped pajamas. King was\ncontent to lie in shirt-sleeves on the other berth, with knees raised,\nso that Hyde could not overlook the general's papers. At his ease he\nstudied them one by one, memorizing a string of names, with details as\nto their owners' antecedents and probable present whereabouts. There\nwere several photographs in the packet, and he studied them very\ncarefully indeed.\n\nBut much most carefully of all he examined Yasmini's portrait, returning\nto it again and again. He reached the conclusion in the end that when it\nwas taken she had been cunningly disguised.\n\n\"This was intended for purpose of identification at a given time and\nplace,\" he told himself.\n\n\"Were you muttering at me?\" asked Hyde.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"It looked extremely like it!\"\n\n\"My mistake, sir. Nothing of the sort intended.\"\n\n\"H-rrrrr-ummmmmph!\"\n\nHyde turned an indignant back on him, and King studied the back as if he\nfound it interesting. On the whole he looked sympathetic, so it was as\nwell that Hyde did not look around. Balked ambition as a rule loathes\nsympathy.\n\nAfter many prickly-hot, interminable, jolting hours the train drew up at\nRawal-Pindi station. Instantly King was on his feet with his tunic on,\nand he was out on the blazing hot platform before the train's motion had\nquite ceased.\n\nHe began to walk up and down, not elbowing but percolating through the\ncrowd, missing nothing worth noticing in all the hot kaleidoscope and\nseeming to find new amusement at every turn. It was not in the least\nastonishing that a well-dressed native should address him presently, for\nhe looked genial enough to be asked to hold a baby. King himself did not\nseem surprised at all. Far from it; he looked pleased.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said the man in glib babu English. \"I am seeking\nCaptain King sahib, for whom my brother is veree anxious to be servant.\nCan you kindlee tell me, sir, where I could find Captain King sahib?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" King answered him. He looked glad to be of help. \"Are you\ntraveling on this train?\"\n\nThe question sounded like politeness welling from the lips of\nunsuspicion.\n\n\"Yes, sir. I am traveling from this place where I have spent a few days,\nto Bombay, where my business is.\n\n\"How did you know King sahib is on the train?\" King asked him, smiling\nso genially that even the police could not have charged him with more\nthan curiosity.\n\n\"By telegram, sir. My brother had the misfortune to miss Captain King\nsahib at Peshawur and therefore sent a telegram to me asking me to do\nwhat I can at an interview.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said King. \"I see.\" And judging by the sparkle in his eyes as\nhe looked away he could see a lot. But the native could not see his eyes\nat that instant, although he tried to.\n\nHe looked back at the train, giving the man a good chance to study his\nface in profile.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, sir!\" said the native oilily. \"You are most kind! I am\nyour humble servant, sir!\"\n\nKing nodded good-by to him, his dark eyes in the shadow of the khaki\nhelmet seeming scarcely interested any longer.\n\n\"Couldn't you find another berth?\" Hyde asked him angrily when he\nstepped back into the compartment.\n\n\"What were you out there looking for?\"\n\nKing smiled back at him blandly.\n\n\"I think there are railway thieves on the train,\" he announced without\nany effort at relevance. He might not have heard the question.\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"Observation, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh! Then if you've seen thieves, why didn't you have 'em arrested? You\nwere precious free with that authority of yours on Peshawur platform!\"\n\n\"Perhaps You'd care to take the responsibility, sir? Let me point out\none of them.\"\n\nFull of grudging curiosity Hyde came to stand by him, and King stepped\nback just as the train began to move.\n\n\"That man, sir--over there--no, beyond him--there!\"\n\nHyde thrust head and shoulders through the window, and a well-dressed\nnative with one foot on the running-board at the back end of the train\ntook a long steady stare at him before jumping in and slamming the door\nof a third-class carriage.\n\n\"Which one?\" demanded Hyde impatiently.\n\n\"I don't see him now, sir!\"\n\nHyde snorted and returned to his seat in the silence of unspeakable\nscorn. But presently he opened a suitcase and drew out a repeating\npistol which he cocked carefully and stowed beneath his pillow; not at\nall a contemptible move, because the Indian railway thief is the most\nresourceful specialist in the world. But King took no overt precautions\nof any kind.\n\nAfter more interminable hours night shut down on them, red-hot,\nblack-dark, mesmerically subdivided into seconds by the thump of\ncarriage wheels and lit at intervals by showers of sparks from the\ngasping engine. The din of Babel rode behind the first-class carriages,\nfor all the natives in the packed third-class talked all together.\n(In India, when one has spent a fortune on a third-class ticket, one\nproceeds to enjoy the ride.) The train was a Beast out of Revelation,\nwallowing in noise.\n\nBut after other, hotter hours the talking ceased. Then King, strangely\nwithout kicking off his shoes, drew a sheet up over his shoulders. On\nthe opposite berth Hyde covered his head, to keep dust out of his hair,\nand presently King heard him begin to snore gently. Then, very carefully\nhe adjusted his own position so that his profile lay outlined in the dim\nlight from the gas lamp in the roof. He might almost have been waiting\nto be shaved.\n\nThe stuffiness increased to a degree that is sometimes preached in\nChristian churches as belonging to a sulphurous sphere beyond the grave.\nYet he did not move a muscle. It was long after midnight when his vigil\nwas rewarded by a slight sound at the door. From that instant his eyes\nwere on the watch, under dark of closed lashes; but his even breathing\nwas that of the seventh stage of sleep that knows no dreams.\n\nA click of the door-latch heralded the appearance of a hand. With skill,\nof the sort that only special training can develop, a man in native\ndress insinuated himself into the carriage without making another sound\nof any kind. King's ears are part of the equipment for his exacting\nbusiness, but he could not hear the door click shut again.\n\nFor about five minutes, while the train swayed head-long into Indian\ndarkness, the man stood listening and watching King's face. He stood\nso near that King recognized him for the one who had accosted him on\nRawal-Pindi platform. And he could see the outline of the knife-hilt\nthat the man's fingers clutched underneath his shirt.\n\n\"He'll either strike first, so as to kill us both and do the looting\nafterward--and in that case I think it will be easier to break his neck\nthan his arm--yes, decidedly his neck; it's long and thin;--or--\"\n\nHis eyes feigned sleep so successfully that the native turned away at\nlast.\n\n\"Thought so!\" He dared open his eyes a mite wider. \"He's pukka--true to\ntype! Rob first and then kill! Rule number one with his sort, run when\nyou've stabbed! Not a bad rule either, from their point of view!\"\n\nAs he watched, the thief drew the sheet back from Hyde's face, with\ntrained fingers that could have taken spectacles from the victims' nose\nwithout his knowledge. Then as fish glide in and out among the reeds\nwithout touching them, swift and soft and unseen, his fingers searched\nHyde's body. They found nothing. So they dived under the pillow and\nbrought out the pistol and a gold watch.\n\nAfter that he began to search the clothes that hung on a hook beside\nHyde's berth. He brought forth papers and a pocketbook--then money.\nMoney went into one bag--papers and pocketbook into another. And that\nwas evidence enough as well as risk enough. The knife would be due in a\nminute.\n\nKing moved in his sleep, rather noisily, and the movement knocked a book\nto the floor from the foot of his berth. The noise of that awoke Hyde,\nand King pretended to begin to wake, yawning and rolling on his back\n(that being much the safest position an unarmed man can take and much\nthe most awkward for his enemy).\n\n\"Thieves!\" Hyde yelled at the top of his lungs, groping wildly for his\npistol and not finding it.\n\nKing sat up and rubbed his eyes. The native drew the knife,\nand--believing himself in command of the situation--hesitated for one\npriceless second. He saw his error and darted for the door too late.\nWith a movement unbelievably swift King was there ahead of him; and with\nanother movement not so swift, but much more disconcerting, he threw his\nsheet as the retiarius used to throw a net in ancient Rome. It wrapped\nround the native's head and arms, and the two went together to the floor\nin a twisted stranglehold.\n\nIn another half-minute the native was groaning, for King had his\nknife-wrist in two hands and was bending it backward while he pressed\nthe man's stomach with his knees.\n\n\"Get his loot!\" he panted between efforts.\n\nThe knife fell to the floor, and the thief made a gallant effort\nto recover it, but King was too strong for him. He seized the knife\nhimself, slipped it in his own bosom and resumed his hold before the\nnative guessed what he was after. Then he kept a tight grip while\nHyde knelt to grope for his missing property. The major found both the\nthief's bags, and held them up.\n\n\"I expect that's all,\" said King, loosening his grip very gradually.\nThe native noticed--as Hyde did not--that King had begun to seem almost\nabsent-minded; the thief lay quite still, looking up, trying to divine\nhis next intention. Suddenly the brakes went on, but King's grip did not\ntighten. The train began to scream itself to a standstill at a wayside\nstation, and King (the absent-minded)--very nearly grinned.\n\n\"If I weren't in such an infernal hurry to reach Bombay--\" Hyde\ngrumbled; and King nearly laughed aloud then, for the thief knew\nEnglish, and was listening with all his ears, \"--may I be damned if I\nwouldn't get off at this station and wait to see that scoundrel brought\nto justice!\"\n\nThe train jerked itself to a standstill, and a man with a lantern began\nto chant the station's name.\n\n\"Damn it!--I'm going to Bombay to act censor. I can't wait--they want me\nthere.\"\n\nThe instant the train's motion altogether ceased the heat shut in on\nthem as if the lid of Tophet had been slammed. The prickly beat burst\nout all over Hyde's skin and King's too.\n\n\"Almighty God!\" gasped Hyde, beginning to fan himself.\n\nThere was plenty of excuse for relaxing hold still further, and King\nmade full use of it. A second later he gave a very good pretense of pain\nin his finger-ends as the thief burst free. The native made a dive\nat his bosom for the knife, but he frustrated that. Then he made a\nprodigious effort, just too late, to clutch the man again, and he did\nsucceed in tearing loose a piece of shirt; but the fleeing robber must\nhave wondered, as he bolted into the blacker shadows of the station\nbuilding, why such an iron-fingered, wide-awake sahib should have made\nsuch a truly feeble showing at the end.\n\n\"Damn it!--couldn't you hold him? Were you afraid of him, or what?\"\ndemanded Hyde, beginning to dress himself. Instead of answering, King\nleaned out into the lamp-lit gloom, and in a minute he caught sight of a\nsergeant of native infantry passing down the train. He made a sign that\nbrought the man to him on the run.\n\n\"Did you see that runaway?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ha, sahib. I saw one running. Shall I follow?\"\n\n\"No. This piece of his shirt will identify him. Take it. Hide it! When\na man with a torn shirt, into which that piece fits, makes for the\ntelegraph office after this train has gone on, see that he is allowed to\nsend any telegrams he wants to! Only, have copies of every one of them\nwired to Captain King, care of the station-master, Delhi. Have you\nunderstood?\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib.\"\n\n\"Grab him, and lock him up tight afterward--but not until he has sent\nhis telegrams!'\n\n\"Atcha, sahib.\"\n\n\"Make yourself scarce, then!\"\n\nMajor Hyde was dressed, having performed that military evolution in\nsomething less than record time.\n\n\"Who was that you were talking to?\" he demanded. But King continued to\nlook out the door.\n\nHyde came and tapped on his shoulder impatiently, but King did not seem\nto understand until the native sergeant had quite vanished into the\nshadows.\n\n\"Let me pass, will you!\" Hyde demanded. \"I'll have that thief caught if\nthe train has to wait a week while they do it!\"\n\nHe pushed past, but he was scarcely on the step when the station-master\nblew his whistle, and his colored minion waved a lantern back and forth.\nThe engine shrieked forthwith of death and torment; carriage doors\nslammed shut in staccato series; the heat relaxed as the engine\nmoved--loosened--let go--lifted at last, and a trainload of hot\npassengers sighed thanks to an unresponsive sky as the train gained\nspeed and wind crept in through the thermantidotes.\n\nOnly through the broken thermantidote in King's compartment no wet\nair came. Hyde knelt on King's berth and wrestled with it like a caged\nanimal, but with no result except that the sweat poured out all over him\nand he was more uncomfortable than before.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" he demanded at last, sitting on King's berth.\nHis head swam. He had to wait a few seconds before he could step across\nto his own side.\n\n\"Only a knife,\" said King. He was standing under the dim gas lamp that\nhelped make the darkness more unbearable.\n\n\"Not that robber's knife? Did he drop it?\"\n\n\"It's my knife,\" said King.\n\n\"Strange time to stand staring at it, if it's yours! Didn't you ever see\nit before?\"\n\nKing stowed the knife away in his bosom, and the major crossed to his\nown side.\n\n\"I'm thinking I'll know it again, at all events!\" King answered, sitting\ndown. \"Good night, sir.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\nWithin ten minutes Hyde was asleep, snoring prodigiously. Then King\npulled out the knife again and studied it for half an hour. The blade\nwas of bronze, with an edge hammered to the keenness of a razor. The\nhilt was of nearly pure gold, in the form of a woman dancing.\n\nThe whole thing was so exquisitely wrought that age had only softened\nthe lines, without in the least impairing them. It looked like one of\nthose Grecian toys with which Roman women of Nero's day stabbed their\nlovers. But that was not why he began to whistle very softly to himself.\n\nPresently he drew out the general's package of papers, with the\nphotograph on the top. He stood up, to hold both knife and papers close\nto the light in the roof.\n\nIt needed no great stretch of imagination to suggest a likeness between\nthe woman of the photograph and the other, of the golden knife-hilt.\nAnd nobody, looking at him then, would have dared suggest he lacked\nimagination.\n\nIf the knife had not been so ancient they might have been portraits of\nthe same woman, in the same disguise, taken at the same time.\n\n\"She knew I had been chosen to work with her. The general sent her word\nthat I am coming,\" he muttered to himself. \"Man number one had a try for\nme, but I had him pinched too soon. There must have been a spy watching\nat Peshawur, who wired to Rawal-Pindi for this man to jump the train and\ngo on with the job. She must have had him planted at Rawal-Pindi in case\nof accidents. She seems thorough! Why should she give the man a knife\nwith her own portrait on it? Is she queen of a secret society? Well--we\nshall see!\"\n\nHe sat down on his berth again and sighed, not discontentedly. Then\nhe lit one of his great black cigars and blew rings for five or six\nminutes. Then he lay back with his head on the pillow, and before five\nminutes more had gone he was asleep, with the cold cigar still clutched\nbetween his fingers.\n\nHe looked as interesting in his sleep as when awake. His mobile face in\nrepose looked Roman, for the sun had tanned his skin and his nose was\naquiline. In museums, where sculptured heads of Roman generals and\nemperors stand around the wall on pedestals, it would not be difficult\nto pick several that bore more than a faint resemblance to him. He had\nbreadth and depth of forehead and a jowl that lent itself to smiles as\nwell as sternness, and a throat that expressed manly determination in\nevery molded line.\n\nHe slept like a boy until dawn; and he and Hyde had scarcely exchanged\nanother dozen words when the train screamed next day into Delhi station.\nThen he saluted stiffly and was gone.\n\n\"Young jackanapes!\" Hyde muttered after him. \"Lazy young devil! He ought\nto be with his regiment, marching and setting a good example to his men!\nWe'll have our work cut out to win this war, if there are many of his\nstamp! And I'm afraid there are--I'm afraid so--far too many of 'em!\nPity! Such a pity! If the right men were at the top the youngsters\nat the foot of the ladder would mind their P's and Q's. As it is, I'm\nafraid we shall get beaten in this show. Dear, oh, dear!\"\n\nBeing what he was, and consistent before all things, Major Hyde drew\nout his writing materials there and then and wrote a report against\nAthelstan King, which he signed, addressed to headquarters and mailed at\nthe first opportunity. There some future historian may find it and draw\nfrom it unkind deductions on the morale of the British army.\n\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\n\n\n     The only things which can not be explained are facts.  So,\n     use 'em. A riddle is proof there is a key to it.  Nor is it\n     a riddle when you've got the key. Life is as simple as all\n     that.--Cocker\n\n\nDelhi boasts a round half-dozen railway stations, all of them designed\nwith regard to war, so that to King there was nothing unexpected in the\nfact that the train had brought him to an unexpected station. He\nplunged into its crowd much as a man in the mood might plunge into a\nwhirlpool,--laughing as he plunged, for it was the most intoxicating\nsplurge of color, din and smell that even India, the many-peopled--even\nDelhi, mother of dynasties--ever had, evolved.\n\nThe station echoed--reverberated--hummed. A roar went up of human\nvoices, babbling in twenty tongues, and above that rose in differing\ndegrees the ear-splitting shriek of locomotives, the blare of bugles,\nthe neigh of led horses, the bray of mules, the jingle of gun-chains and\nthe thundering cadence of drilled feet.\n\nAt one minute the whole building shook to the thunder of a grinning\nregiment; an instant later it clattered to the wrought-steel hammer of a\nthousand hoofs, as led troop-horses danced into formation to invade the\nwaiting trucks. Loaded trucks banged into one another and thunderclapped\ntheir way into the sidings. And soldiers of nearly every Indian military\ncaste stood about everywhere, in what was picturesque confusion to the\nuninitiated, yet like the letters of an index to a man who knew. And\nKing knew. Down the back of each platform Tommy Atkins stood in long\nstraight lines, talking or munching great sandwiches or smoking.\n\nThe heat smelt and felt of another world. The din was from the same\nsphere. Yet everywhere was hope and geniality and by-your-leave as if\nweddings were in the wind and not the overture to death.\n\nThreading his way in and out among the motley swarm with a\ngreat black cheroot between his teeth and sweat running into\nhis eyes from his helmet-band, Athelstan King strode at ease--at\nhome--intent--amused--awake--and almost awfully happy. He was not in the\nleast less happy because perfectly aware that a native was following him\nat a distance, although he did wonder how the native had contrived to\npass within the lines.\n\nThe general at Peshawur had compressed about a ton of miscellaneous\ninformation into fifteen hurried minutes, but mostly he had given him\nleave and orders to inform himself; so the fun was under way of winning\nexact knowledge in spite of officers, not one of whom would not have\ngrown instantly suspicions at the first asked question. At the end of\nfifteen minutes there was not a glib staff-officer there who could have\ndeceived him as to the numbers and destination of the force entraining.\n\n\"Kerachi!\" he told himself, chewing the butt of his cigar and keeping\nwell ahead of the shadowing native. Always keep a \"shadow\" moving until\nyou're ready to deal with him is one of Cocker's very soundest rules.\n\n\"Turkey hasn't taken a hand yet--the general said so. No holy war yet.\nThese'll be held in readiness to cross to Basra in case the Turks\nbegin. While they wait for that at Kerachi the tribes won't dare begin\nanything. One or two spies are sure to break North and tell them what\nthis force is for--but the tribes won't believe. They'll wait until the\nforce has moved to Basra before they take chances. Good! That means no\nespecial hurry for me!\"\n\nHe did not have to return salutes, because he did not look for them.\nVery few people noticed him at all, although he was recognized once\nor twice by former messmates, and one officer stopped him with an\nout-stretched hand.\n\n\"Shake hands, you old tramp! Where are you bound for next? Tibet by any\nchance--or is it Samarkand this time?\"\n\n\"Oh, hullo, Carmichel!\" he answered, beaming instant good-fellowship.\n\"Where are you bound for?\" And the other did not notice that his own\nquestion had not been answered.\n\n\"Bombay! Bombay--Marseilles--Brussels--Berlin!\"\n\n\"Wish you luck!\" laughed King, passing on. Every living man there, with\nthe exception of a few staff-officers, believed himself en route for\nEurope; their faces said as much. Yet King took another look at the\npiles of stores and at the kits the men carried.\n\n\"Who'd take all that stuff to Europe, where they make it?\" he reflected.\n\"And what 'u'd they use camel harness for in France?\"\n\nAt his leisure--in his own way, that was devious and like a string of\nmiracles--he filtered toward the telegraph office. The native who had\nfollowed him all this time drew closer, but he did not let himself be\ntroubled by that.\n\nHe whispered proof of his identity to the telegraph clerk, who was a\nRoyal Engineer, new to that job that morning, and a sealed telegram was\nhanded to him at once. The \"shadow\" came very close indeed, presumably\nto try and read over his shoulder from behind, but he side-stepped into\na corner and read the telegram with his back to the wall.\n\nIt was in English, no doubt to escape suspicion; and because it was\nwar-time, and the censorship had closed on India like a throttling\nstring, it was not in code. So the wording, all things considered, had\nto be ingenious, for the Mirza Ali, of the Fort, Bombay, to whom it\nwas addressed, could scarcely be expected to read more than between the\nlines. The lines had to be there to read between.\n\n\"Cattle intended for slaughter,\" it ran, \"despatched Bombay on Fourteen\ndown. Meet train. Will be inspected en route, but should be dealt with\ncarefully, on arrival. Cattle inclined to stampede owing to bad scare\nreceived to North of Delhi. Take all precautions and notify Abdul.\" It\nwas signed \"Suliman.\"\n\n\"Good!\" he chuckled. \"Let's hope we get Abdul too. I wonder who he is!\"\n\nStill uninterested in the man who shadowed him, he walked back to the\noffice window and wrote two telegrams; one to Bombay, ordering the\narrest of Ali Mirza of the Fort, with an urgent admonition to discover\nwho his man Abdul might be, and to seize him as soon as found; the other\nto the station in the north, insisting on dose confinement for Suliman.\n\n\"Don't let him out on any terms at all!\" he wired.\n\nThat being all the urgent business, he turned leisurely to face his\nshadow, and the native met his eyes with the engaging frankness of an\nold friend, coming forward with outstretched hand. They did not shake\nhands, for King knew better than to fall into the first trap offered\nhim. But the man made a signal with his fingers that is known to not\nmore than a dozen men in all the world, and that changed the situation\naltogether.\n\n\"Walk with me,\" said King, and the man fell into stride beside him.\n\nHe was a Rangar,--which is to say a Rajput who, or whose ancestors had\nturned Muhammadan. Like many Rajputs he was not a big man, but he looked\nfit and wiry; his head scarcely came above the level of King's chin,\nalthough his turban distracted attention from the fact. The turban was\nof silk and unusually large.\n\nThe whitest of well-kept teeth, gleaming regularly under a little black\nwaxed mustache betrayed no trace of betel-nut or other nastiness, and\nneither his fine features nor his eyes suggested vice of the sort that\noften undermines the character of Rajput youth.\n\nOn second thoughts, and at the next opportunity to see them, King was\nnot so sure that the eyes were brown, and he changed his opinion about\ntheir color a dozen times within the hour. Once he would even have sworn\nthey were green.\n\nThe man was well-to-do, for his turban was of costly silk, and he was\nclad in expensive jodpur riding breeches and spurred black riding boots,\nall perfectly immaculate. The breeches, baggy above and tight, below,\nsuggested the clean lines of cat-like agility and strength.\n\nThe upper part of his costume was semi-European. He was a regular Rangar\ndandy, of the type that can be seen playing polo almost any day at\nMount Abu--that gets into mischief with a grace due to practise and\nheredity--but that does not manage its estates too well, as a rule, nor\npay its debts in a hurry.\n\n\"My name is Rewa Gunga,\" he said in a low voice, looking up sidewise at\nKing a shade too guilelessly. Between Cape Comorin and the Northern Ice\nguile is normal, and its absence makes the wise suspicious.\n\n\"I am Captain King.\"\n\n\"I have a message for you.\"\n\n\"From whom?\"\n\n\"From her!\" said the Rangar, and without exactly knowing why, or being\npleased with himself, King felt excited.\n\nThey were walking toward the station exit. King had a trunk check in\nhis hand, but returned it to pocket, not proposing just yet to let this\nRangar over--hear instructions regarding the trunk's destination; he was\ntoo good-looking and too overbrimming with personal charm to be trusted\nthus early in the game. Besides, there was that captured knife, that\nhinted at lies and treachery. Secret signs as well as loot have been\nstolen before now.\n\n\"I'd like to walk through the streets and see the crowd.\"\n\nHe smiled as he said that, knowing well that the average young Rajput of\ngood birth would rather fight a tiger with cold steel than walk a mile\nor two. He drew fire at once.\n\n\"Why walk, King sahib? Are we animals? There is a carriage waiting--her\ncarriage--and a coachman whose ears were born dead. We might be\noverheard in the street. Are you and I children, tossing stones into a\npool to watch the rings widen!\"\n\n\"Lead on, then,\" answered King.\n\nOutside the station was a luxuriously modern victoria, with C springs\nand rubber tires, with horses that would have done credit to a viceroy.\nThe Rangar motioned King to get in first, and the moment they were both\nseated the Rajput coachman set the horses to going like the wind. Rewa\nGunga opened a jeweled cigarette case.\n\n\"Will you have one?\" he asked with the air of royalty entertaining a\nblood-equal.\n\nKing accepted a cigarette for politeness' sake and took occasion to\nadmire the man's slender wrist, that was doubtless hard and strong as\nwoven steel, but was not much more than half the thickness of his own.\n\nThe Rajputs as a race are proud of their wrists and hands. Their swords\nare made with a hilt so small that none save a Rajput of the blood could\npossibly use one; yet there is no race in all warring India, nor any\nin the world, that bears a finer record for hard fighting and sheer\nderring-do. One of the questions that occurred to King that minute was\nwhy this well-bred youngster whose age he guessed at twenty-two or so\nhad not turned his attention to the army.\n\n\"My height!\"\n\nThe man had read his thoughts!\n\n\"Not quite tall enough. Besides--you are a soldier, are you not? And do\nyou fight?\"\n\nHe nodded toward a dozen water-buffaloes, that slouched along the street\nwith wet goatskin mussuks slung on their blue flanks.\n\n\"They can fight,\" he said smiling. \"So can any other fool!\" Then, after\na minute of rather strained silence: \"My message is from her.\"\n\n\"From Yasmini?\"\n\n\"Who else?\"\n\nKing accepted the rebuke with a little inclination of the head. He spoke\nas little as possible, because he was puzzled. He had become conscious\nof a puzzled look in the Rangar's eyes--of a subtle wonderment that\nmight be intentional flattery (for Art and the East are one). Whenever\nthe East is doubtful, and recognizes doubt, it is as dangerous as a\nhillside in the rains, and it only added to his problem if the Rangar\nfound in him something inexplicable. The West can only get the better of\nthe East when the East is too cock-sure.\n\n\"She has jolly well gone North!\" said the Rangar suddenly, and King\nshut his teeth with a snap. He sat bolt upright, and the Rangar allowed\nhimself to look amused.\n\n\"When? Why?\"\n\n\"She was too jolly well excited to wait, sahib! She is of the North,\nyou know. She loves the North, and the men of the 'Hills'; and she knows\nthem because she loves them. There came a tar (telegram) from Peshawur,\nfrom a general, to say King sahib comes to Delhi; but already she had\ncompleted all arrangements here. She was in a great stew, I can assure\nyou. Finally she said, 'Why should I wait?' Nobody could answer her.\"\n\nHe spoke English well enough. Few educated foreign gentlemen could have\nspoken it better, although there was the tendency to use slang that\nwell-bred natives insist on picking up from British officers; and as he\nwent on, here and there the native idiom crept through, translated. King\nsaid nothing, but listened and watched, puzzled more than he would\nhave cared to admit by the look in the Rangar's eyes. It was not\nsuspicion--nor respect. Yet there was a suggestion of both.\n\n\"At last she said, 'It is well; I will not wait! I know of this sahib.\nHe is a man whose feet stand under him and he will not tread my growing\nflowers into garbage! He will be clever enough to pick up the end of\nthe thread that I shall leave behind and follow it and me! He is a true\nbound, with a nose that reads the wind, or the general sahib never would\nhave sent him!' So she left me behind, sahib, to--to present to you the\nend of the thread of which she spoke.\"\n\nKing tossed away the stump of the cigarette and rolled his tongue round\nthe butt of a fresh cheroot. The word \"hound\" is not necessarily a\ncompliment in any of a thousand Eastern tongues and gains little by\ntranslation. It might have been a slip, but the East takes advantage of\nits own slips as well as of other peoples' unless watched.\n\nThe carriage swayed at high speed round three sharp corners in\nsuccession before the Rangar spoke again.\n\n\"She has often heard of you,\" he said then. That was not unlikely, but\nnot necessarily true either. If it were true, it did not help to account\nfor the puzzled look in the Rangar's eyes, that increased rather than\ndiminished.\n\n\"I've heard of her,\" said King.\n\n\"Of course! Who has not? She has desired to meet you, sahib, ever since\nshe was told you are the best man in your service.\"\n\nKing grunted, thinking of the knife beneath his shirt.\n\n\"She is very glad that you and she are on the same errand.\" He leaned\nforward for the sake of emphasis and laid a finger on King's hand. It\nwas a delicate, dainty finger with an almond nail. \"She is very glad.\nShe is far more glad than you imagine, or than you would believe. King\nsahib, she is all bucked up about it! Listen--her web is wide! Her\nagents are here--there--everywhere, and she is obeyed as few kings have\never been! Those agents shall all be held answerable for your life,\nsahib,--for she has said so! They are one and all your bodyguard, from\nnow forward!\"\n\nKing inclined his head politely, but the weight of the knife inside\nhis shirt did not encourage credulity. True, it might not be Yasmini's\nknife, and the Rangar's emphatic assurance might not be an unintentional\nadmission that the man who had tried to use it was Yasmini's man. But\nwhen a man has formed the habit of deduction, he deduces as he goes\nalong, and is prone to believe what his instinct tells him.\n\nAgain, it was as if the Rangar read a part of his thoughts, if not all\nof them. It is not difficult to counter that trick, but to do it a man\nmust be on his guard, or the East will know what he has thought and what\nhe is going to think, as many have discovered when it was too late.\n\n\"Her men are able to protect anybody's life from any God's number of\nassassins, whatever may lead you to think the contrary. From now forward\nyour life is in her men's keeping!\"\n\n\"Very good of her; I'm sure,\" King murmured. He was thinking of the\ngeneral's express order to apply for a \"passport\" that would take him\ninto Khinjan Caves--mentally cursing the necessity for asking any kind\nof favor,--and wondering whether to ask this man for it or wait until he\nshould meet Yasmini. He had about made up his mind that to wait would\nbe quite within a strict interpretation of his orders, as well as\ninfinitely more agreeable to himself, when the Rangar answered his\nthoughts again as if he had spoken them aloud.\n\n\"She left this with me, saying I am to give it to you! I am to say that\nwherever you wear it, between here and Afghanistan, your life shall be\nsafe and you may come and go!\"\n\nKing stared. The Rangar drew a bracelet from an inner pocket and held it\nout. It was a wonderful, barbaric thing of pure gold, big enough for a\ngrown man's wrist, and old enough to have been hammered out in the very\nwomb of time. It looked almost like ancient Greek, and it fastened with\na hinge and clasp that looked as if they did not belong to it, and might\nhave been made by a not very skillful modern jeweler.\n\n\"Won't you wear it?\" asked Rewa Gunga, watching him. \"It will prove a\ntrue talisman! What was the name of the Johnny who had a lamp to rub?\nAladdin? It will be better than what he had! He could only command a lot\nof bogies. This will give you authority over flesh and blood! Take it,\nsahib!\"\n\nSo King put it on, letting it slip up his sleeve, out of sight,--with\na sensation as the snap closed of putting handcuffs on himself. But the\nRangar looked relieved.\n\n\"That is your passport, sahib! Show it to a Hill-man whenever you\nsuppose yourself in danger. The Raj might go to pieces, but while\nYasmini lives--\"\n\n\"Her friends will boast about her, I suppose!\"\n\nKing finished the sentence for him because it is considered good\nform for natives to hint at possible dissolution of the Anglo-Indian\nGovernment. Everybody knows that the British will not govern India\nforever, but the British--who know it best of all, and work to that end\nmost fervently--are the only ones encouraged to talk about it.\n\nFor a few minutes after that Rewa Gunga held his peace, while the\ncarriage swayed at breakneck speed through the swarming streets. They\nhad to drive slower in the Chandni Chowk, for the ancient Street of the\nSilversmiths that is now the mart of Delhi was ablaze with crude colors,\nand was thronged with more people than ever since '57. There were a\nthousand signs worth studying by a man who could read them.\n\nKing, watching and saying nothing, reached the conclusion that Delhi was\nin hand--excited undoubtedly, more than a bit bewildered, watchful,\nbut in hand. Without exactly knowing how he did it, he grew aware of a\ncertain confidence that underlay the surface fuss. After that the sea\nof changing patterns and raised voices ceased to have any particular\ninterest for him and he lay back against the cushions to pay stricter\nattention to his own immediate affairs.\n\nHe did not believe for a second the lame explanation Yasmini had left\nbehind. She must have some good reason for wishing to be first up the\nKhyber, and he was very sorry indeed she had slipped away. It might be\nonly jealousy, yet why should she be jealous? It might be fear--yet why\nshould she be afraid?\n\nIt was the next remark of the Rangar's that set him entirely on his\nguard, and thenceforward whoever could have read his thoughts would have\nbeen more than human. Perhaps it is the most dominant characteristic of\nthe British race that it will not defend itself until it must. He had\nknown of that thought-reading trick ever since his ayah (native\nnurse) taught him to lisp Hindustanee; just as surely he knew that its\nimpudent, repeated use was intended to sap his belief in himself. There\nis not much to choose between the native impudence that dares intrude on\na man's thoughts, and the insolence that understands it, and is rather\ntoo proud to care.\n\n\"I'll bet you a hundred dibs,\" said the Rangar, \"that she jolly well\ndidn't fancy your being on the scene ahead of her! I'll bet you she\ndecided to be there first and get control of the situation! Take me?\nYou'd lose if you did! She's slippery, and quick, and like all Women,\nshe's jealous!\"\n\nThe Rangar's eyes were on his, but King was not to be caught again.\nIt is quite easy to think behind a fence, so to speak, if one gives\nattention to it.\n\n\"She will be busy presently fooling those Afridis,\" he continued, waving\nhis cigarette. \"She has fooled them always, to the limit of their bally\nbent. They all believe she is their best friend in the world--oh, dear\nYes, you bet they do! And so she is--so she is--but not in the way they\nthink! They believe she plots with them against the Raj! Poor silly\ndevils! Yet Yasmini loves them! They want war--blood--loot! It is all\nthey think about! They are seldom satisfied unless their wrists and\nelbows are bally well red with other peoples' gore! And while they\nare picturing the loot, and the slaughter of unbelievers--(as if they\nbelieved anything but foolishness themselves!)--Yasmini plays her own\ngame, for amusement and power--a good game--a deep game! You have seen\nalready how India has to ask her aid in the 'Hills'! She loves power,\npower, power--not for its name, for names are nothing, but to use\nit. She loves the feel of it! Fighting is not power! Blood-letting\nis foolishness. If there is any blood spilt it is none of her\ndoing--unless--\"\n\n\"Unless what?\" asked King.\n\n\"Oh--sometimes there were fools who interfered. You can not blame her\nfor that.\"\n\n\"You seem to be a champion of hers! How long have you known her?\"'\n\nThe Rangar eyed him sharply.\n\n\"A long time. She and I played together when we were children. I know\nher whole history--and that is something nobody else in the world knows\nbut she herself. You see, I am favored. It is because she knows me very\nwell that she chose me to travel North with you, when you start to find\nher in the 'Hills'!\"\n\nKing cleared his throat, and the Rangar nodded, looking into his eyes\nwith the engaging confidence of a child who never has been refused\nanything, in or out of reason. King made no effort to look pleased, so\nthe Rangar drew on his resources.\n\n\"I have a letter from her,\" he stated blandly.\n\nFrom a pocket in the carriage cushions he brought out a silver tube,\nrichly carved in the Kashmiri style and closed at either end with a\ntightly fitting silver cap. King accepted it and drew the cap from one\nend. A roll of scented paper fell on his lap, and a puff of hot wind\ncombined with a lurch of the carriage springs came near to lose it\nfor him; he snatched it just in time and unrolled it to find a letter\nwritten to himself in Urdu, in a beautiful flowing hand.\n\nUrdu is perhaps the politest of written tongues and lends itself most\nreadily to indirectness; but since he did not expect to read a catalogue\nof exact facts, he was not disappointed.\n\nTranslated, the letter ran:\n\n        \"To Athelstan King sahib, by the hand of Rewa Gunga.\n        Greeting.  The bearer is my well-trusted servant, whom\n        I have chosen to be the sahib's guide until Heaven\n        shall be propitious and we meet.  He is instructed\n        in all that he need know concerning what is now in hand,\n        and he will tell by word of mouth such things as ought\n        not to be written.  By all means let Rewa Gunga travel\n        with you, for he is of royal blood, of the House of\n        Ketchwaha and will not fail you.  His honor and mine\n        are one.  Praying that the many gods of India may heap\n        honors on your honor's head, providing each his proper\n        attribute toward entire ability to succeed in all things,\n        but especially in the present undertaking,\n\n        \"I am Your Excellency's humble servant,\n        --Yasmini.\"\n\nHe had barely finished reading it when the coachman took a last corner\nat a gallop and drew the horses up on their haunches at a door in a high\nwhite wall. Rewa Gunga sprang out of the carriage before the horses were\nquite at a standstill.\n\n\"Here we are!\" he said, and King, gathering up the letter and the silver\ntube, noticed that the street curved here so that no other door and no\nwindow overlooked this one.\n\nHe followed the Rangar, and he was no sooner into the shadow of the door\nthan the coachman lashed the horses and the carriage swung out of view.\n\n\"This way,\" said the Rangar over his shoulder. \"Come!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\n\n     Lie to a liar, for lies are his coin.\n     Steal from a thief, for that is easy.\n     Set a trap for a trickster, and catch him at the first attempt.\n     But beware of the man who has no axe to grind.\n     --Eastern Proverb\n\n\nIt was a musty smelling entrance, so dark that to see was scarcely\npossible after the hot glare outside. Dimly King made out Rewa Gunga\nmounting stairs to the left and followed him. The stairs wound backward\nand forward on themselves four times, growing scarcely any lighter as\nthey ascended, until, when he guessed himself two stories at least above\nroad level, there was a sudden blaze of reflected light and he blinked\nat more mirrors than he could count. They had been swung on hinges\nsuddenly to throw the light full in his face.\n\nThere were curtains reflected in each mirror, and little glowing lamps,\nso cunningly arranged that it was not possible to guess which were\nreal and which were not. Rewa Gunga offered no explanation, but stood\nwatching with quiet amusement. He seemed to expect King to take a chance\nand go forward, but if he did he reckoned without his guest. King stood\nstill.\n\nThen suddenly, as if she had done it a thousand times before and\nsurprised a thousand people, a little nut-brown maid parted the middle\npair of curtains and said \"Salaam!\" smiling with teeth that were as\nwhite as porcelain. All the other curtains parted too, so that the\nwhereabouts of the door might still have been in doubt had she not\nspoken and so distinguished herself from her reflections. King looked\nscarcely interested and not at all disturbed.\n\nBalked of his amusement, Rewa Gunga hurried past him, thrusting the\nlittle maid aside, and led the way. King followed him into a long room,\nwhose walls were hung with richer silks than any he remembered to have\nseen. In a great wide window to one side some twenty, women began at\nonce to make flute music.\n\nSilken punkahs swung from chains, wafting back and forth a cloud of\nsandalwood smoke that veiled the whole scene in mysterious, scented\nmist. Through the open window came the splash of a fountain and the\nchattering of birds, and the branch of a feathery tree drooped near by.\nIt seemed that the long white wall below was that of Yasmini's garden.\n\n\"Be welcome!\" laughed Rewa Gunga; \"I am to do the honors, since she is\nnot here. Be seated, sahib.\"\n\nKing chose a divan at the room's farthest end, near tall curtains that\nled into rooms beyond. He turned his back toward the reason for his\nchoice. On a little ivory-inlaid ebony table about ten feet away lay a\nknife, that was almost the exact duplicate of the one inside his shirt.\nBronze knives of ancient date, with golden handles carved to represent a\nwoman dancing, are rare. The ability to seem not to notice incriminating\nevidence is rarer still--rarest of all when under the eyes of a native\nof India, for cats and hawks are dullards by comparison to them. But\nKing saw the knife, yet did not seem to see it.\n\nThere was nothing there calculated to set an Englishman at ease. In\nspite of the Rangar's casual manner, Yasmini's reception room felt\nlike the antechamber to another world, where mystery is atmosphere and\nordinary air to breathe is not at all. He could sense hushed expectancy\non every side--could feel the eyes of many women fixed on him--and began\nto draw on his guard as a fighting man draws on armor. There and then he\ndeliberately set himself to resist mesmerism, which is the East's chief\nweapon.\n\nRewa Gunga, perfectly at home, sprawled leisurely, along a cushioned\ncouch with a grace that the West has not learned yet; but King did not\nmake the mistake of trusting him any better for his easy manners, and\nhis eyes sought swiftly for some unrhythmic, unplanned thing on which to\nrest, that he might save himself by a sort of mental leverage.\n\nGlancing along the wall that faced the big window, he noticed for the\nfirst time a huge Afridi, who sat on a stool and leaned back against the\nsilken hangings with arms folded.\n\n\"Who is that man?\" he asked.\n\n\"He? Oh, he is a savage--just a big savage,\" said Rewa Gunga, looking\nvaguely annoyed.\n\n\"Why is he here?\"\n\nHe did not dare let go of this chance side-issue. He knew that Rewa\nGunga wished him to talk of Yasmini and to ask questions about her, and\nthat if he succumbed to that temptation all his self-control would be\ncunningly sapped away from him until his secrets, and his very senses,\nbelonged to some one else.\n\n\"What is he doing here?\" he insisted.\n\n\"He? Oh, he does nothing. He waits,\" purred the Rangar. \"He is to be\nyour body-servant on your journey to the North. He is nothing--nobody at\nall!--except that he is to be trusted utterly because he loves Yasmini.\nHe is Obedience! A big obedient fool! Let him be!\"\n\n\"No,\" said King. \"If he's to be my man I'll speak to him!\"\n\nHe felt himself winning. Already the spell of the room was lifting, and\nhe no longer felt the cloud of sandalwood smoke like a veil across his\nbrain.\n\n\"Won't you tell him to come here to me?\"\n\nRewa Gunga laughed, resting his silk turban against the wall hangings\nand clasping both hands about his knee. It was as a man might laugh who\nhas been touched in a bout with foils.\n\n\"Oh!--Ismail!\" he called, with a voice like a bell, that made King\nstare.\n\nThe Afridi seemed to come out of a deep sleep and looked bewildered,\nrubbing his eyes and feeling whether his turban was on straight. He\ncombed his beard with nervous fingers as he gazed about him and caught\nRewa Gunga's eye. Then he sprang to his feet.\n\n\"Come!\" ordered Rewa Gunga.\n\nThe man obeyed.\n\n\"Did you see?\" Rewa Gunga chuckled. \"He rose from his place like a\nbuffalo, rump first and then shoulder after shoulder! Such men are safe!\nSuch men have no guile beyond what will help them to obey! Such men\nthink too slowly to invent deceit for its own sake!\"\n\nThe Afridi came and towered above them, standing with gnarled hands\nknotted into clubs.\n\n\"What is thy name?\" King asked him.\n\n\"Ismail!\" he boomed.\n\n\"Thou art to be my servant?\"\n\n\"Aye! So said she. I am her man. I obey!\"\n\n\"When did she say so?\" King asked him blandly, asking unexpected\nquestions being half the art of Secret Service, although the other half\nis harder to achieve.\n\nThe Hillman stroked his great beard and stood considering the question.\nOne could almost imagine the click of slow machinery revolving in his\nmind, although King entertained a shrewd suspicion that he was not so\nstupid as he chose to seem. His eyes were too hawk-bright to be a stupid\nman's.\n\n\"Before she went away,\" he answered at last.\n\n\"When did she go away?\"\n\nHe thought again, then \"Yesterday,\" he said.\n\n\"Why did you wait before you answered?\"\n\nThe Afridi's eyes furtively sought Rewa Gunga's and found no aid there.\nWatching the Rangar less furtively, but even less obviously, King was\naware that his eyes were nearly closed, as if they were not interested.\nThe fingers that clasped his knee drummed on it indifferently, seeing\nwhich King allowed himself to smile.\n\n\"Never mind,\" he told Ismail. \"It is no matter. It is ever well to think\ntwice before speaking once, for thus mistakes die stillborn. Only the\nmonkey-folk thrive on quick answers--is it not so? Thou art a man of\nmany inches--of thew and sinew--Hey, but thou art a man! If the heart\nwithin those great ribs of thine is true as thine arms are strong I\nshall be fortunate to have thee for a servant!\"\n\n\"Aye!\" said the Afridi. \"But what are words? She has said I am thy\nservant, and to hear her is to obey!\"\n\n\"Then from now thou art my servant?\"\n\n\"Nay, but from yesterday when she gave the order!\"\n\n\"Good!\" said King.\n\n\"Aye, good for thee! May Allah do more to me if I fail!\"\n\n\"Then, take me a telegram!\" said King.\n\nHe began to write at once on a half-sheet of paper that he tore from a\nletter he had in his pocket, setting down a row of figures at the top\nand transposing into cypher as he went along.\n\n\"Yasmini has gone North. Is there any reason at your end why I should\nnot follow her at once?\"\n\nHe addressed it in plain English to his friend the general at Peshawur,\ntaking great care lest the Rangar read it through those sleepy,\nhalf-closed eyes of his. Then he tore the cypher from the top, struck\na match and burned the strip of paper and handed the code telegram to\nIsmail, directing him carefully to a government office where the cypher\nsignature would be recognized and the telegram given precedence.\n\nIsmail stalked off with it, striding like Moses down from\nSinai--hook-nose--hawk-eye--flowing beard--dignity and all, and King\nsettled down to guard himself against the next attempt on his sovereign\nself-command.\n\nNow he chose to notice the knife on the ebony table as if he had not\nseen it before. He got up and reached for it and brought it back,\nturning it over and over in his hand.\n\n\"A strange knife,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,--from Khinjan,\" said Rewa Gunga, and King eyed him as one wolf\neyes another.\n\n\"What makes you say it is from Khinjan?\"\n\n\"She brought it from Khinjan Caves herself! There is another knife that\nmatches it, but that is not here. That bracelet you now wear, sahib, is\nfrom Khinjan Caves too! She has the secret of the Caves!\"\n\n\"I have heard that the 'Heart of the Hills' is there,\" King answered.\n\"Is the 'Heart of the Hills' a treasure house?\"\n\nRewa Gunga laughed.\n\n\"Ask her, sahib! Perhaps she will tell you! Perhaps she will let you\nsee! Who knows? She is a woman of resource and unexpectedness--Let her\nwomen dance for you a while.\"\n\nKing nodded. Then he got up and laid the knife back on the little table.\nA minute or so later he noticed that at a sign from Rewa Gunga a woman\nleft the great window place and spirited the knife away.\n\n\"May I have a sheet of paper?\" he asked, for he knew that another fight\nfor his self-command was due.\n\nRewa Gunga gave an order, and a maid brought him scented paper on a\nsilver tray. He drew out his own fountain pen then and made ready.\n\nIn spite of the great silken punkah that swung rhythmically across the\nfull breadth of the room the beat was so great that the pen slipped\nround and round between his fingers. Yet he contrived to write, and\nsince his one object was to give his brain employment, he wrote down\na list of the names he had memorized in the train on the journey from\nPeshawur, not thinking of a use for the list until he had finished.\nThen, though, a real use occurred to him.\n\nWhile he began to write more than a dozen dancing women swept into the\nroom from behind the silk hangings in a concerted movement that was all\nlithe slumberous grace. Wood-wind music called to them from the great\ndeep window as snakes are summoned from their holes, and as cobras\nanswer the charmer's call the women glided to the center and stood\npoised beneath the punkah.\n\nThere they began to chant, still dreamily, and with the chant the dance\nbegan, in and out, round and round, lazily, ever so lazily, wreathed in\nbuoyant gossamer that was scarcely more solid than the sandalwood smoke\nthey wafted into rings.\n\nKing watched them and listened to their chant until he began to\nrecognize the strain on the eye-muscles that precedes the mesmeric\nspell. Then he wrote and read what he had written and wrote again. And\nafter that, for the sake of mental exercise, he switched his thoughts\ninto another channel altogether. He reverted to Delhi railway station.\n\n\"The Turks can spy as well as anybody.--They know those men are going to\nKerachi to be ready for them.--Therefore, having cut his eye-teeth B.C.\nseveral hundred, the Unspeakable Turk will take care not to misbehave\nUNTIL he's ready. And I suppose our government, being ours and we being\nus, will let him do it! All of which will take time.--And that again\nmeans no trouble in the Hills--probably--until the Turks really do feel\nready to begin. They'll preach a holy war just ahead of the date. The\ntribes will keep quiet because an army at Kerachi might be meant for\ntheir benefit. Oh, yes, I'm quite sure they were entraining for Kerachi\nin readiness to move on Basra.\n\n\"Trucks ready for camels--and camel drivers--and food for camels--and\nEresby, who's just come from taking a special camel course. Not a doubt\nof it!--And then, Corrigan--Elwright--Doby--Gould--all on the platform\nin a bunch, and all down on the Army List as Turkish interpreters! Not a\ndoubt left!\"\n\n\"What have you written?\" asked a quiet voice at his ear; and he turned\nto look straight in the eyes of Rewa Gunga, who had leaned forward to\nread over his shoulder. Just for one second he hovered on the brink of\nquick defeat. Having escaped the Scylla of the dancing women, Charybdis\nwaited for him in the shape of eyes that were pools of hot mystery. It\nwas the sound of his own voice that brought him back to the world again\nand saved his will for him unbound.\n\n\"Read it, won't you?\" he laughed. \"If you know, take this pen and mark\nthe names of whichever of those men are still in Delhi.\"\n\nRewa Gunga took pen and paper and set a mark against some thirty of the\nnames, for King had a manner that disarmed refusal.\n\n\"Where are the others?\" he asked him, after a glance at it.\n\n\"In jail, or else over the border.\"\n\n\"Already?\"\n\nThe Rangar nodded. \"Trust Yasmini! She saw to that jolly well before she\nleft Delhi! She would have stayed had there been anything more to do!\"\n\nKing began to watch the dance again, for it did not feel safe to look\ntoo long into the Rangar's eyes. It was not wise just then to look too\nlong at anything, or to think too long on any one subject.\n\n\"Ismail is slow about returning,\" said the Rangar.\n\n\"I wrote at the foot of the tar,\" said King, \"that they are to detain\nhim there until the answer comes.\"\n\nThe Rangar's eyes blazed for a second and then grew cold again (as King\ndid not fail to observe). He knew as well as the Rangar that not many\nmen would have kept their will so unfettered in that room as to be able\nto give independent orders. He recognized resignation, temporary at\nleast, in the Rangar's attitude of leaning back again to watch from\nunder lowered eyelids. It was like being watched by a cat.\n\nAll this while the women danced on, in time to wailing flute-music,\nuntil, it seemed from nowhere, a lovelier woman than any of them\nappeared in their midst, sitting cross-legged with a flat basket at her\nknees. She sat with arms raised and swayed from the waist as if in a\ndelirium. Her arms moved in narrowing circles, higher and higher above\nthe basket lid, and the lid began to rise. Nobody touched it, nor was\nthere any string, but as it rose it swayed with sickening monotony.\n\nIt was minutes before the bodies of two great king-cobras could be\nmade out, moving against the woman's spangled dress. The basket lid was\nresting on their heads, and as the music and the chanting rose to a wild\nweird shriek the lid rose too, until suddenly the woman snatched the\nlid away and the snakes were revealed, with hoods raised, hissing the\ncobra's hate-song that is prelude to the poison-death.\n\nThey struck at the woman, one after the other, and she leaped out of\ntheir range, swift and as supple as they. Instantly then she joined\nin the dance, with the snakes striking right and left at her. Left\nand right she swayed to avoid them, far more gracefully than a matador\navoids the bull and courting a deadlier peril than he--poisonous, two to\nhis one. As she danced she whirled both arms above her head and cried as\nthe were-wolves are said to do on stormy nights.\n\nSome unseen hand drew a blind over the great window and an eerie\ngreen-and-golden light began to play from one end of the room, throwing\nthe dancers into half-relief and deepening the mystery.\n\nSweet strange scents were wafted in from under the silken hangings.\nThe room grew cooler by unguessed means. Every sense was treacherously\nwooed. And ever, in the middle of the moving light among the languorous\ndancers, the snakes pursued the woman!\n\n\"Do you do this often?\" wondered King, in a calm aside to Rewa Gunga,\nturning half toward him and taking his eyes off the dance without any,\nvery, great effort.\n\nRewa Gunga clapped his hands and the dance ceased. The woman spirited\nher snakes away. The blind was drawn upward and in a moment all was\nnormal again with the punkah swinging slowly overhead, except that the\nseductive smell remained, that was like the early-morning breath of all\nthe different flowers of India.\n\n\"If she were here,\" said the Rangar, a little grimly--with a trace of\ndisappointment in his tone--\"you would not snatch your eyes away\nlike that! You would have been jolly well transfixed, my friend!\nThese--she--that woman--they are but clumsy amateurs! If she were here,\nto dance with her snakes for you, you would have been jolly well dancing\nwith her, if she had wished it! Perhaps you shall see her dance some\nday! Ah,--here is Ismail,\" he added in an altered tone of voice. He\nseemed relieved at sight of the Afridi.\n\nBursting through the glass-bead curtains at the door, the great savage\nstrode down the room, holding out a telegram. Rewa Gunga looked as if\nhe would have snatched it, but King's hand was held out first and Ismail\ngave it to him. With a murmur of conventional apology King tore the\nenvelope and in a second his eyes were ablaze with something more than\nwonder. A mystery, added to a mystery, stirred all the zeal in him. But\nin a second he had sweated his excitement down.\n\n\"Read that, will you?\" he said, passing it to Rewa Gunga. It was not in\ncypher, but in plain everyday English.\n\n\"She has not gone North,\" it ran. \"She is still in Delhi. Suit your own\nmovements to your plans.\"\n\n\"Can you explain?\" asked King in a level voice. He was watching the\nRangar narrowly, yet he could not detect the slightest symptom of\nemotion.\n\n\"Explain?\" said the Rangar. \"Who can explain foolishness? It means that\nanother fat general has made another fat mistake!\"\n\n\"What makes you so certain she went North?\" King asked.\n\nInstead of answering, Rewa Gunga beckoned Ismail, who had stepped back\nout of hearing. The giant came and loomed over them like the Spirit of\nthe Lamp of the Arabian Nights.\n\n\"Whither went she?\" asked the Rangar.\n\n\"To the North!\" he boomed.\n\n\"How knowest thou?\"\n\n\"I saw her go!\"\n\n\"When went she?\"\n\n\"Yesterday, when a telegram came.\"\n\nThe word \"came\" was the only clue to his meaning, for in the language he\nused \"yesterday\" and \"to-morrow\" are the same word; such is the East's\nestimate of time.\n\n\"By what route did she go?\" asked Rewa Gunga.\n\n\"By the terrain from the station.\"\n\n\"How knowest thou that?\"\n\n\"I was there, bearing her box of jewels.\"\n\n\"Didst thou see her buy the tikkut?\"\n\n\"Nay, I bought it, for she ordered me.\"\n\n\"For what destination was the tikkut?\"\n\n\"Peshawur!\" said Ismail, filling his mouth with the word as if he loved\nit.\n\n\"Yet\"--it was King who spoke now, pointing an accusing finger at him--\"a\nburra sahib sends a tar to me--this is it!--to say she is in Delhi\nstill! Who told thee to answer those questions with those words?\"\n\n\"She!\" the big man answered.\n\n\"Yasmini?\"\n\n\"Aye! May Allah cover her with blessings!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said King. \"You have my leave to depart out of earshot.\"\n\nThen he turned on Rewa Gunga.\n\n\"Whatever the truth of all this,\" he said quietly, \"I suppose it means\nshe has done what there was to do in Delhi?\"\n\n\"Sahib,--trust her! Does a tigress hunt where no watercourses are, and\nwhere no game goes to drink? She follows the sambur!\"\n\n\"You are positive she has started for the North?\"\n\n\"Sahib, when she speaks it is best to believe! She told me she will go.\nTherefore I am ready to lead King sahib up the Khyber to her!\"\n\n\"Are you certain you can find her?\"\n\n\"Aye, sahib,--in the dark!\"\n\n\"There's a train leaves for the North to-night,\" said King.\n\nThe Rangar nodded.\n\n\"You'll want a pass up the line. How many servants? Three--four--how\nmany?\"\n\n\"One,\" said the Rangar, and King was instantly suspicious of the modesty\nof that allowance; however he wrote out a pass for Rewa Gunga and one\nservant and gave it to him.\n\n\"Be there on time and see about your own reservation,\" he said. \"I'll\nattend to Ismail's pass myself.\"\n\nHe folded the list of names that the Rangar had marked and wrote\nsomething on the back. Then he begged an envelope, and Rewa Gunga had\none brought to him. He sealed the list in the envelope, addressed it and\nbeckoned Ismail again.\n\n\"Take this to Saunders sahib!\" he ordered. \"Go first to the telegraph\noffice, where you were before, and the babu there will tell you where\nSaunders sahib may be found. Having found him, deliver the letter to\nhim. Then come and find me at the Star of India Hotel and help me to\nbathe and change my clothes.\"\n\n\"To hear is to obey!\" boomed Ismail, bowing; but his last glance was\nfor Rewa Gunga, and he did not turn to go until he had met the Rangar's\neyes.\n\nWhen Ismail had gone striding down the room, with no glance to spare\nfor the whispering women in the window, and with dignity like an aura\nexuding from him, King looked into the Rangar's eyes with that engaging\nfrankness of his that disarms so many people.\n\n\"Then you'll be on the train to-night?\" he asked.\n\n\"To hear is to obey! With pleasure, sahib!\"\n\n\"Then good-by until this evening.\"\n\nKing bowed very civilly and walked out, rather unsteadily because his\nhead ached. Probably nobody else, except the Rangar, could have guessed\nwhat an ordeal he had passed through or how near he had been to losing\nself-command.\n\nBut as he felt his way down the stairs, that were dimly lighted now, he\nknew he had all his senses with him, for he \"spotted\" and admired the\nlurking places that had been designed for undoing of the unwary, or even\nthe overwary. Yasmini's Delhi nest was like a hundred traps in one.\n\n\"Almost like a pool table,\" he reflected. \"Pocket 'em at both ends and\nthe middle!\"\n\nIn the street he found a gharry after a while and drove to his hotel.\nAnd before Ismail came he took a stroll through a bazaar, where he made\na few strange purchases. In the hotel lobby he invested in a leather bag\nwith a good lock, in which to put them. Later on Ismail came and proved\nhimself an efficient body-servant.\n\nThat evening Ismail carried the leather bag and found his place on the\ntrain, and that was not so difficult, because the trains running North\nwere nearly empty, although the platforms were all crowded. As he stood\nat the carriage door with Ismail near him, a man named Saunders slipped\nthrough the crowd and sought him out.\n\n\"Arrested 'em all!\" he grinned.\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"Seen anything of her? I recognized Yasmini's scent on your envelope.\nIt's peculiar to her--one of her monopolies!\"\n\n\"No. I'm told she went North yesterday.\"\n\n\"Not by train, she didn't! It's my business to know that!\"\n\nKing did not answer; nor did he look surprised. He was watching Rewa\nGunga, followed by a servant, hurrying to a reserved compartment at the\nfront end of the train. The Rangar waved to him and he waved back.\n\n\"I'd know her in a million!\" vowed Saunders. \"I can take oath she hasn't\ngone anywhere by train! Unless she has walked, or taken a carriage,\nshe's in Delhi!\"\n\nThe engine gave a preliminary shriek and the giant Ismail nudged King's\nelbow in impatient warning. There was no more sign of Rewa Gunga, who\nhad evidently settled down in his compartment for the night.\n\n\"Get my bag out again!\" King ordered, and Ismail stared.\n\n\"Get out my bag, I said!\"\n\n\"To hear is to obey!\" Ismail grumbled, reaching with his long arm\nthrough the window.\n\nThe engine shrieked again, somebody whistled, and the train began to\nmove.\n\n\"You've missed it!\" said Saunders, amused at Ismail's frantic\ndisappointment. The giant was tugging at his beard. \"How about your\ntrunk? Better wire ahead and have it spotted for you.\"\n\n        \"No,\" said King;  \"it's still in the baggage room a the\nother station. I didn't intend to go by this train. Came down here\nto see another fellow off, that's all! Have a cigar and then let's go\ntogether and look those prisoners over!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\n\n\n   Men boast in the Hills, when they ought to pray;\n   For the wind blows lusty, and the blood runs red,\n   And Law lies belly upwards for a man to wreak his fancy on it.\n   Down in the plains, in the dust of the plains\n   Where law is master and a good man ought to boast,\n   They all lie belly downwards praying for their Hills again!\n\n\nThe rear lights of the train he had not taken swayed out of Delhi\nstation and King grinned as he wiped the sweat from his face with\na dripping handkerchief. Behind him towered the hook-nosed Ismail,\nresentful of the unexpected. In front of him Saunders eyed the proffered\nblack cheroots suspiciously, accepted one with an air of curiosity and\npassed the case back. Around them the clatter of the station crowd began\nto die, and Parsimony in a shabby uniform went round to lower lights.\n\n\"Are you sure--\"\n\nKing's merry eyes looked into Saunders' as if there were no world war\nreally and they two were puppets in a comedy.\n\n\"--are you absolutely certain Yasmini is in Delhi?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Saunders. \"What I swear to is that she has not left by train.\nIt's my business to know who leaves by train.\"\n\n\"What can you suggest?\" asked King, twisting at his scrubby little\nmustache. But if he wished to convey the impression of a man at his\nwits' end, he failed signally.\n\n\"I? Nothing! She's the most elusive individual in Asia! One person\nin the world knows where she is, unless she has an accomplice. My\ninformation's negative. I know she has not gone by--\"\n\nKing struck a match and held it out, so the sentence was unfinished;\nthe first few puffs of the astonishing cigar wiped out all memory of the\nmissing word. And then King changed the subject.\n\n\"Those men I asked you to arrest--?\"\n\n\"Nabbed\"--puff--\"every one of 'em!\"--puff--puff--\"all\nunder\"--puff--puff--\"lock and key,--best smoke I ever tasted--where\nd'you get 'em?\"\n\n\"Had they been in communication with her?\"\n\nPuff--puff--\"You bet they had! Where d'you get these things?\"\n\n\"Not her special men by any chance?\"\n\nPuff--\"Gad, what smoke!--couldn't say, of course,\nbut\"--puff--puff--\"shouldn't think so.\"\n\n\"Well--I'll go along with you if you like, and look them over.\"\n\nBoth tone and manner gave Saunders credit for the suggestion, and\nSaunders seemed to like it. There is nothing like following up, in\nfootball, war or courtship.\n\n\"I see you're a judge of a cigar,\" said King, and Saunders purred,\nall men being fools to some extent, and the only trouble being to\ndemonstrate the fact.\n\nThey had started for the station entrance when a nasal voice began\nintoning, \"Cap-teen King sahib--Cap-teen King sahib!\" and a telegraph\nmessenger passed them with his book under his arm. King whistled him. A\nmoment later he was tearing open an official urgent telegram and writing\na string of figures in pencil across the top. Then he decoded swiftly,\n\n        \"Advices are Yasmini was in Delhi as recently as six\n        this evening.  Fail to understand your inability to\n        get in touch.  Have you tried at her house?  Matters\n        in Khyber district much less satisfactory.  Word from\n        O-C Khyber Rifles to effect that lashkar is collecting.\n        Better sweep up in Delhi and proceed northward as quickly\n        as compatible with caution.   L. M. L.\"\n\nThe three letters at the end were the general's coded signature. The\nwording of the telegram was such that as he read King saw a mental\npicture of the general's bald red skull and could almost hear him say\nthe \"fail to understand.\" The three words \"much less satisfactory\" were\na bookful of information. So, as he folded up the telegram, tore the\npenciled strip of figures from the top and burned it with a match, he\nwas at pains to look pleased.\n\n\"Good news?\" asked Saunders, blowing smoke through his nose.\n\n\"Excellent. Where's my man? Here--you--Ismail!\"\n\nThe giant came and towered above him.\n\n\"You swore she went North!\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib! To Peshawur she went!\"\n\n\"Did she start from this station?\"\n\n\"From where else, sahib?\"\n\nBut this was too much for Saunders, who stepped forward and thrust in\nan oar. King on the other band stepped back a pace so as to watch both\nfaces.\n\n\"Then, when did she go?\"\n\n\"I saw her go!\" said Ismail, affronted.\n\n\"When? When, confound you! When?\"\n\n\"Yesterday.\"\n\n\"I expect he means to-morrow,\" said King. With the advantage of\nlooker-on and a very deep experience of Northerners, he had noted that\nIsmail was lying and that Saunders was growing doubtful, although both\nmen concealed the truth with what was very close to being art.\n\n\"I have a telegram here,\" he said, \"that says she is in Delhi!\"\n\nHe patted his coat, where the inner pocket bulged.\n\n\"Nay, then the tar lies, for I saw her go with these two eyes of mine!\"\n\n\"It is not wise to lie to me, my friend,\" King assured him, so\npleasantly that none could doubt he was telling truth.\n\n\"If I lie may I eat dirt!\" Ismail answered him.\n\nInches lent the Afridi dignity, but dignity has often been used as a\nstalking horse for untruth. King nodded, and it was not possible to\njudge by his expression whether he believed or not.\n\n\"Let's make a move,\" he said, turning to Saunders. \"She seems at\nany rate to wish it believed she has gone North. I can't stay here\nindefinitely. If she's here she's on the watch here, and there's no need\nof me. If she has gone North, then that is where the kites are wheeling!\nI'll take the early morning train. Where are the prisoners?\"\n\n\"In the old Mir Khan Palace. We were short of jail room and had to\nimprovise. The horse-stalls there have come in handy more than once\nbefore. Shall we take this gharry?\"\n\nWith Ismail up beside the driver nursing King's bag and looking like\na great grim vulture about to eat the horse, they drove back through\nswarming streets in the direction of the river. King seemed to have lost\nall interest in crowds. He scarcely even troubled to watch when they\nwere held up at a cross-roads by a marching regiment that tramped as if\nit were herald of the Last Trump, with bayonets glistening in the street\nlights. He sat staring ahead in silence, although Saunders made more\nthan one effort to engage him in conversation.\n\n\"No!\" he said at last suddenly--so that Saunders jumped.\n\n\"No what?\"\n\n\"No need to stay here. I've got what I came for!\"\n\n\"What was that?\" asked Saunders, but King was silent again. Conscious of\nthe unaccustomed weight on his left wrist, he moved his arm so that the\nsleeve drew and he could see the edge of the great gold bracelet Rewa\nGunga had given him in Yasmini's name.\n\n\"Know anything of Rewa Gunga?\" he asked suddenly again.\n\n\"The Rangar?\"\n\n\"Yes, the Rangar. Yasmini's man.\"\n\n\"Not much. I've seen him. I've spoken with him, and I've had to stand\nimpudence from him--twice. I've been tipped off more than once to let\nhim alone because he's her man. He does ticklish errands for her, or so\nthey say. He's what you might call 'known to the police' all right.\"\n\nThey began to approach an age-old palace near the river, and Saunders\nwhispered a pass-word when an armed guard halted them. They were halted\nagain at a gloomy gateway where an officer came out to look them over;\nby his leave they left the gharry and followed him under the arch\nuntil their heels rang on stone paving in a big ill-lighted courtyard\nsurrounded by high walls.\n\nThere, after a little talk, they left Ismail squatting beside King's\nbag, and Saunders led the way through a modern iron door, into what had\nonce been a royal prince's stables.\n\nIn gloom that was only thrown into contrast by a wide-spaced row of\nelectric lights, a long line of barred and locked converted horse-stalls\nran down one side of a lean-to building. The upper half of each locked\ndoor was a grating of steel rods, so that there was some ventilation for\nthe prisoners; but very little light filtered between the bars, and all\nthat King could see of the men within was the whites of their eyes. And\nthey did not look friendly.\n\nHe had to pass between them and the light, and they could see more of\nhim than he could of them. At the first cell he raised his left hand and\nmade the gold bracelet on his wrist clink against the steel bars.\n\nA moment later be cursed himself, and felt the bracelet with his\nfingernail. He had made a deep nick in the soft gold. A second later yet\nhe smiled.\n\n\"May God be with thee!\" boomed a prisoner's voice in Pashtu.\n\n\"Didn't know that fellow was handcuffed,\" said Saunders. \"Did you hear\nthe ring? They should have been taken off. Leaving his irons on has made\nhim polite, though.\"\n\nHe passed oil, and King followed him, saying nothing. But at the next\ncell he repeated what he had done at the first, taking better care of\nthe gold but letting his wrist stay longer in the light.\n\n\"May God be with thee!\" said a voice within.\n\n\"Gettin' a shade less arrogant, what?\" said Saunders.\n\n\"May God be with thee!\" said a man in the third stall as King passed.\n\n\"They seem to be anxious for your morals!\" laughed Saunders, keeping a\npace or two ahead to do the honors of the place.\n\n\"May God be with thee!\" said a fourth man, and King desisted for the\npresent, because Saunders looked as if he were growing inquisitive.\n\n\"Where did you arrest them?\" he asked when Saunders came to a stand\nunder a light.\n\n\"All in one place. At Ali's.\"\n\n\"Who and what is Ali?\"\n\n\"Pimp--crimp--procurer--Prussian spy and any other evil thing that takes\nhis fancy! Runs a combination gambling hell and boarding house. Lets\n'em run into debt and blackmails 'em. Ali's in the kaiser's pay--that's\nknown! 'Musing thing about it is he keeps a photo of Wilhelm in his\npocket and tries to make himself believe the kaiser knows him by name.\nSuffers from swelled head, which is part of their plan, of course.\nWe'll get him when we want him, but at present he's useful 'as is' for\na decoy. Ali was very much upset at the arrest--asked in the name of\nHeaven--seems to be familiar with God, too, and all the angels!--how he\nshall collect all the money these men owe him!\"\n\n\"You wouldn't call these men prosperous, then?\"\n\n\"Not exactly! Ali is the only spy out of the North who prospers much at\npresent, and even he gets most of his money out of his private business.\nWhy, man, the real Germans we have pounced on are all as poor as church\nmice. That's another part of the plan, of course, which is sweet in all\nits workings. They're paid less than driven by threats of exposure to\nus--comes cheaper, and serves to ginger up the spies! The Germans pay\nAli a little, and he traps the Hillmen when they come South--lets\n'em gamble--gets 'em into debt--plays on their fear of jail and their\nignorance of the Indian Penal Code, which altereth every afternoon--and\nspends a lot of time telling 'em stories to take back with 'em to the\nHills when they can get away. They can get away when they've paid him\nwhat they owe. He makes that clear, and of course that's the fly in the\namber. Yasmini sends and pays their board and gambling debts, and she's\nour man, so to speak. When they get back to the 'Hills'--\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said King, \"I know what happens in the 'Hills. Tell me about\nthe Delhi end of it.\"\n\n\"Well, when the wander-fever grabs 'em again they come down once more\nfrom their 'Hills' to drink and gamble,--and first they go to Yasmini's.\nBut she won't let 'em drink at her place. Have to give her credit for\nthat, y'know; her place has never been a stews. Sooner or later they\ngrow tired of virtue, 'specially with so much intrigue goin' on under\ntheir noses, and back they all drift to Ali's and tell him tales to\ntell the Germans--and the round begins again. Yasmini coaxes all their\nstories out of 'em and primes 'em with a few extra good ones into the\nbargain. Everybody's fooled--'specially the Germans--and exceptin', of\ncourse, Yasmini and the Raj. Nobody ever fooled that woman, nor ever\nwill if my belief goes for anything!\"\n\n\"Sounds simple!\" said King.\n\n\"Simple and sordid!\" agreed Saunders.\n\nKing looked up and down the line of locked doors and then straight into\nSaunders' eyes in a friendly, yet rather disconcerting way. One could\nnot judge whether he were laughing or just thinking.\n\n\"D'you suppose it's as simple as all that?\"\n\n\"How d'you mean?\"\n\n\"D'you suppose the Germans aren't in director touch with the tribes?\"\n\n\"Why should they be? The simpler the better, I expect, from their point\nof view; and the cheaper the better, too!\"\n\n\"Um-m-m!\" King rubbed his chin. \"On what charge did you get these men?\"\n\n\"Defense of the Realm--suspicious characters--charge to be entered\nlater.\"\n\n\"Good! That's simple at all events! Know anything of my man Ismail?\"\n\n\"Sure! He's one of Yasmini's pets. She bailed him out of Ali's three\nyears ago and he worships her. It was he who broke the leg and ribs of\na pup-rajah a month or two ago for putting on too much dog in her\nreception room! He's Ursus out of Quo Vadis! He's dog, desperado,\nstalking horse and Keeper of the Queen's secrets!\"\n\n\"Then why d'you suppose she passed him along to me?\" asked King.\n\n\"Dunno! This is your little mystery, not mine!\"\n\n\"Glad you appreciate that! Do me a favor, will you?\"\n\n\"Anything in reason.\"\n\n\"Get the keys to all these cells--send 'em in here to me by Ismail--and\nleave me in here alone!\"\n\nSaunders whistled and wiped sweat from his glistening face, for in spite\nof windows open to the courtyard it was hotter than a furnace room.\n\n\"Mayn't I have you thrown into a den of tigers?\" he asked. \"Or a nest\nof cobras? Or get the fiery furnace ready? You'll find 'em sore--and\ndangerous! That man at the end with handcuffs on has probably been\nviolent! That 'God be with thee' stuff is habit--they say it with\nunction before they knife a man!\"\n\n\"I'll be careful, then,\" King chuckled; and it is a fact that few men\ncan argue with him when he laughs quietly in that way. \"Send me in the\nkeys, like a good chap.\"\n\nSo Saunders went, glad enough to get into the outer air. He slammed\nthe great iron door behind him as if he were glad, too, to disassociate\nhimself from King and all foolishness. Like many another first-class\nman, King sheds friends as a cat sheds fur going under a gate. They grow\nagain and quit again and don't seem to make much difference.\n\nThe instant the door slammed King continued down the line with his left\nwrist held high so that the occupant of each cell in turn could see the\nbracelet.\n\n\"May God be with thee!\" came the instant greeting from each cell until\ndown toward the farther end. The occupants of the last six cells were\nsilent.\n\nNumbers had been chalked roughly on the doors. With wetted fingers he\nrubbed out the chalk marks on the last six doors, and he had scarcely\nfinished doing that when Ismail strode in, slamming the great iron door\nbehind him, jangling a bunch of keys and looking more than ever like\nsomebody out of the Old Testament.\n\n\"Open every door except those whose numbers I have rubbed out!\" King\nordered him.\n\nIsmail proceeded to obey as if that were the least improbable order\nin all the world. It took him two minutes to select the pass-key and\ndetermine how it worked, then the doors flew open one after another in\nquick succession.\n\n\"Come out!\" he growled. \"Come out!--Come out!\" although King had not\nordered that.\n\nKing went and stood under the center light with his left arm bared. The\nprisoners, emerging like dead men out of tombs, blinked at the bright\nlight--saw him--then the bracelet--and saluted.\n\n\"May God be with thee!\" growled each of them.\n\nThey stood still then, awaiting fresh developments. It did not seem\nto occur to any one of them as strange that a British officer in khaki\nuniform should be sporting Yasmini's talisman; the thing was apparently\nsufficient explanation in itself.\n\n\"Ye all know this?\" he asked, holding up his wrist. \"Whose is this?\"\n\n\"Hers!\"\n\nThe answer was monosyllabic and instant from all thirty throats. \"May\nAllah guard her, sleeping and awake!\" added one or two of them.\n\nKing lit a cheroot and made mental note of the wisdom of referring to\nher by pronoun, not by name.\n\n\"And I? Who am I?\" he asked, since it saves worlds of trouble to have\nthe other side state the case. The Secret Service was not designed for\ngiving information, but discovering it.\n\n\"Her messenger! Who else? Thou art he who shall take us to the 'Hills'!\nShe promised!\"\n\n\"How did she know ye were in this jail?\" he asked them, and one of the\nHillmen laughed like a jackal, showing yellow eye-teeth. The others\ncackled in chorus after him.\n\n\"Answer that riddle thyself--or else ask her! Who are we? Bats, that can\nsee in the night? Spirits, who can hear through walls? Nay, we be plain\nmen of the mountains!\"\n\n\"But where were ye when she promised?\"\n\n\"At Ali's. All of us at Ali's--held for debt. We sent and begged of her.\nShe sent word back by a woman that one of the sirkar's men shall free us\nand send us home. So we waited, eating shame and little else, at Ali's.\nAt last came a sahib in a great rage, who ordered irons put on our\nwrists and us marched hither. Only when each was pushed into a separate\ncell were the irons taken off again. Yet we were patient, for we knew\nthis is part of her cunning, to get us away from Ali without paying him.\n'May Ali die of want,' said we, with one voice all together in these\ncells! And now we be ready! They fed us before we had been in here an\nhour. Our bellies be full, but we be hungry for the 'Hills'!\"\n\nKing thought of the gold-hilted knife, that still rested under his\nshirt. He was tempted to show it to them and find out surely whose\nit was and what it meant. But wisdom and curiosity seldom mingle. He\nthought of Ismail--\"Ursus, of Quo Vadis--dog, desperado, stalking-horse\nand Keeper of the Queen's secrets.\" It was not time yet to run risks\nwith Ismail. The knife stayed where it was.\n\n\"I shall start for the Hills at dawn,\" he said slowly, and he watched\ntheir eyes gleam at the news. No caged tiger is as wretched as a\nprisoned Hillman. No freed bird wings more wildly for the open. No moth\ncomes more foolishly back to the flame again. It was easy to take pity\non them--probably not one of whom knew pity's meaning.\n\n\"Is there any among you who would care to come--?\"\n\n\"Ah-h-h-h!\"\n\n\"--at the price of strict obedience?\"\n\n\"Eh-h-h-h-h!\"\n\nIt seemed there was no word in Pashtu that could express their\nwillingness.\n\n\"We be very, very weary for our Hills!\" explained the nearest man.\n\n\"Aye!\" King answered. \"And ye all owe Ali!\"\n\n\"Uh-h-h-h-h!\"\n\nBut he knew better than to browbeat them on that account just then, for\nthe men of the North are easier led than driven--up to a certain point.\nYet it is no bad plan to remind them of the fundamentals to begin with.\n\n\"Will ye obey me, and him?\" he asked, laying his hand on Ismail's\nshoulder, as much to let them see the bracelet again as for any other\nreason.\n\n\"Aye! If we fail, Allah do more to us!\"\n\nKing laughed. \"Ye shall leave this place as my prisoners. Here ye have\nno friends. Here ye must obey. But what when ye come to your 'Hills' at\nlast? Can one man hold thirty men prisoners then? In the 'Hills' will ye\nstill obey me?\"\n\nThey answered him in chorus. Every man of the thirty, and Ismail into\nthe bargain, threw his right hand in the air.\n\n\"Allah witness that we will obey!\"\n\n\"Ah-h-h!\" said King. \"I have heard Hillmen swear by Allah many a time!\nMany a time!\"\n\nThe answer to that was unexpected. Ismail knelt--seized his hand--and\npressed the gold bracelet to his lips!\n\nIn turn, every one of them filed by, knelt reverently and kissed the\nbracelet!\n\n\"Saw ye ever a Hillman do that before?\" asked Ismail. \"They will obey\nthee! Have no fear!\"\n\n\"Kutch dar nahin hai!\" King answered. \"There is no such thing as fear!\"\nand Ismail grinned at him, not knowing that King was feeling as Aladdin\nmust have done.\n\n\"I have heard you swear,\" said King; \"be ye true men!\"\n\n\"Ah-h-h!\"\n\n\"Have they belongings that ought to be collected first?\" he asked, and\nIsmail laughed.\n\n\"No more than the dead have! A shroud apiece! Ali gave them bitterness\nto eat and picked their teeth afterward for gleanings! They stand in\nwhat they own!\"\n\n\"Then, come!\" ordered King, turning his back confidently on thirty\nsavages whom Saunders, for instance, would have preferred to drive in\nfront of him, after first seeing them handcuffed. But when he is not\npressed for time neither pistols, nor yet handcuffs, are included in\nKing's method.\n\n\"Each lock has a key, but some keys fit all locks,\" says the Eastern\nproverb. King has been chosen for many ticklish errands in his time, and\nSaunders is still in Delhi.\n\nThrough the great iron door into dim outer darkness King led them and\npresently made them squat in a close-huddled semicircle on the paving\nstones, like night-birds waiting for a meal.\n\n\"I want blankets for them--two good ones apiece--and food for a week's\njourney!\" he told the astonished Saunders; and he spoke so decidedly\nthat the other man's questions and argument died stillborn. \"While you\nattend to that for me, I'll be seeing his dibs and making explanations.\nYou look full of news. What do you know?\"\n\n\"I've telephoned all the other stations, and my men swear Yasmini has\nnot left Delhi by train!\"\n\nKing smiled at him.\n\n\"If I leave by train d'you suppose she'll hear of it?\"\n\n\"You bet! Bet your boots! Man alive--if she's interested in you by so\nmuch,\"--he measured off a fraction of his little finger end--\"she knows\nyour next two moves ahead, to say nothing of your past half-dozen!\nI crossed her bows once and thought I had her at a disadvantage. She\nlaughed at me. On my honor, my spine tingles yet at the mere thought of\nit! You've never met her? Never heard her laugh? Never seen her eyes?\nYou've a treat in store for you--and a mauvais quat' d'heure! What'll\nyou bet me she doesn't laugh you out of countenance the very first time\nyou meet? Come now--what'll you bet?\"\n\n\"Not in the habit,\" King answered, glancing at his watch. \"Will you see\nabout their rations, please, and the blankets? Thanks!\"\n\nThey went then in opposite directions and the prisoners were left\nsquatting under the eyes and bayonets of a very suspicious prison guard,\nwho made no secret of being ready for all conceivable emergencies. One\nenthusiast drew the cartridge out of his breech-chamber and licked it at\nintervals of a minute or two, to the very great interest of the Hillmen,\nwho memorized every detail that by any stretch of imagination might be\nexpected to improve their own shooting when they should get home again.\n\nKing found his way on foot through a maze of streets to a palace where\nhe was admitted through one door after another by sentries who saluted\nwhen he had whispered to them. He ended by sitting on the end of the bed\nof a gray-headed man who owns three titles and whose word is law between\nthe borders of a province. To him he talked as one schoolboy to a bigger\none, because the gray-haired man had understanding, and hence sympathy.\n\n\"I don't envy you!\" said he under the sheet. \"There was an American\nhere not long ago--most amusing man I ever talked to. He had the right\nexpression. 'I do not desiderate that pie!' was his way of putting it.\nGood, don't you think?\"\n\nAll the while he talked the older man was writing on a pad that he held\npropped by his knees beneath the bedclothes, holding the paper tight to\nkeep it from fluttering in the breeze of a big electric fan.\n\n\"There's the release for your prisoners. Take it--and take them!\nWhatever possessed you to want such a gift?\"\n\n\"Orders, sir.\"\n\n\"Whose?\"\n\n\"His. He sent for me to Peshawur and gave me strict orders to work with,\nnot against her. This was obvious.\"\n\n\"How obvious? It seems bewildering!\"\n\n\"Well, sir,--first place, she doesn't want to seem to be connected with\nme. Otherwise she'd have been more in evidence. Second place, she has\nleft Delhi--his telegram and Saunders' men on oath notwithstanding--and\nshe did not mean to leave those men. I imagine her best way to manage\nHillmen is to keep promises, and they say she promised them. Third\nplace, if those thirty men had been anything but her particular pet\ngang they'd either have been over the border or else in jail before\nnow,--just like all the others. For some reason that I don't pretend to\nunderstand, she promised 'em more than she has been able to perform. So\nI provide performance. She gets the credit for it. I get a pretty good\npersonal following at least as far as up the Khyber! Q.E.D.,sir!\"\n\nThe man in bed nodded. \"Not bad,\" he said.\n\n\"Didn't she make some effort to get those men away from Ali's?\" King\nasked him. \"I mean, didn't she try to get them dry-nursed by the sirkar\nin some way?\"\n\n\"Yes. She did. But it was difficult. In the first place, there didn't\nseem to be any particular hurry. They were eating Ali's substance. The\nscoundrel had to feed them as long as he kept them there, and we wanted\nthat. We forbade her to pay their debts to Ali, because he has too\nurgent need of money just now. He is being pressed on account of debts\nof his own, and the pressure is making him take risks. He has been\nbegging for money from the German agents. We know who they are, and we\nexpect to make a big haul within a few hours now.\"\n\n\"Hope I didn't spoil things by butting in, sir.\"\n\n\"No. This is different. She wanted them arrested and locked up at a\nmoment when the jails were all crowded. And then she wanted us to put\n'em into trucks and railroad 'em up North out of harm's way as she put\nit, and we happened to be too busy. The railway staff was overworked.\nNow things are getting straightened out. I felt it keenly not being able\nto oblige her, but she asked too much at the wrong moment! I would have\ndone it if I could out of gratitude; it was she who tipped off for us\nmost of the really dangerous men, and it was not her fault a few of them\nescaped. But we've all been working both tides under, King. Take me;\nthis is my first night in bed in three, and here I am awake! No--nothing\npersonal--glad to see you, but please understand. And I'm a leisured\ndilettante compared to most of the others. She must have known our fix.\nShe shouldn't have asked.\"\n\nKing smiled. \"Perfectly good opportunity for me, sir!\" he said\ncheerfully.\n\n\"So you seem to think. But look out for that woman, King--she's\ndangerous. She's got the brains of Asia coupled with Western energy! I\nthink she's on our side, and I know he believes it; but watch her!\"\n\n\"Ham dekta hai!\" King grinned. But the older man continued to look as if\nhe pitied him.\n\n\"If you get through alive, come and tell me about it afterward. Now,\nmind you do! I'm awfully interested, but as for envying you--\"\n\n\"Envy!\" King almost squealed. He made the bed-springs rattle as he\njumped. \"I wouldn't swap jobs with General French, sir!\"\n\n\"Nor with me, I suppose!\"\n\n\"Nor with you, sir.\n\n\"Good-by, then. Good-by, King, my boy. Good-by, Athelstan. Your\nbrother's up the Khyber, isn't he? Give him my regards. Good-by!\"\n\nLong before dawn the thirty prisoners and Ismail squatted in a little\nherd on the up-platform of a railway station, shepherded by King, who\nsmoked a cheroot some twenty paces away, sitting on an unmarked chest of\nmedicines. He seemed absorbed in a book on surgery that he had borrowed\nfrom a chance-met acquaintance in the go-down where he drew the medical\nsupplies. Ismail sat on the one trunk that had been fetched from\nthe other station and nursed the new hand-bag on his knees, picking\neverlastingly at the lock and wondering audibly what the bag contained\nto an accompaniment of low-growled sympathy.\n\n\"I am his servant--for she said so--and he said so. As the custom is he\ngave me the key of the great bag--on which I sit--as he said himself,\nfor safe-keeping. Then why--why in Allah's name--am I not to have the\nkey of this bag too? Of this little bag that holds so little and is so\nlight?\"\n\n\"It might be money in it?\" hazarded one of the herd.\n\n\"Nay, for that it is too light.\"\n\n\"Paper money!\" suggested another man. \"Hundies, with printing on the\nface that sahibs accept instead of gold.\"\n\n\"Nay, I know where his money is,\" said Ismail. \"He has but little with\nhim.\"\n\n\"A razor would slit the leather easily,\" suggested another man. \"Then\nwith a hand inserted carefully through the slit, so as not to widen it\nmore than needful, a man could soon discover the contents. And later,\nthe bag might be dropped or pushed violently against some sharp thing,\nto explain the cut.\"\n\nIsmail shook his head.\n\n\"Why? What could he do to thee?\"\n\n\"It is because I know not what he would do to me that I will do\nnothing!\" answered Ismail. \"He is not at all like other sahibs I have\nhad dealings with. This man does unexpected things. This man is not mad,\nhe has a devil. I have it in my heart to love this man. But such talk is\nfoolishness. We are all her men!\"\n\n\"Aye! We are her men!\" came the chorus, so that King looked up and\nwatched them over the open book.\n\nAt dawn, when the train pulled out, the thirty prisoners sat safely\nlocked in third-class compartments. King lay lazily on the cushions of a\nfirst-class carriage in the rear, utterly absorbed in the principles of\nantiseptic dressing, as if that had anything to do with Prussians and\nthe Khyber Pass; and Ismail attended to the careful packing of soda\nwater bottles in the ice-box on the floor.\n\n\"Shall I open the little bag, sahib?\" he asked.\n\nKing shook his head.\n\nIsmail shook the bag.\n\n\"The sound is as of things of much importance all disordered,\" he said\nsagely. \"It might be well to rearrange.\"\n\n\"Put it over there!\" King ordered. \"Set it down!\"\n\nIsmail obeyed and King laid his book down to light another of his black\ncheroots. The theme of antiseptics ceased to exercise its charm over\nhim. He peeled off his tunic, changed his shirt and lay back in sweet\ncontentment. Headed for the \"Hills,\" who would not be contented, who had\nbeen born in their very shadow?--in their shadow, of a line of Britons\nwho have all been buried there!\n\n\"The day after to-morrow I'll see snow!\" he promised himself. And\nIsmail, grinning with yellow teeth through a gap in his wayward beard,\nunderstood and sympathized.\n\nForward in the third-class carriages the prisoners hugged themselves and\ncrooned as they met old landmarks and recognized the changing scenery.\nThere was a new cleaner tang in the hot wind that spoke of the \"Hills\"\nand home!\n\nDelhi had drawn them as Monte Carlo attracts the gamblers of all Europe.\nBut Delhi had spewed them out again, and oh! how exquisite the promise\nof the \"Hills\" was, and the thunder of the train that hurried--the\nbumping wheels that sang Himahlayas--Himahlyas!--the air that blew in on\nthem unscented--the reawakened memory--the heart's desire for the cold\nand the snow and the cruelty--the dark nights and the shrieking storms\nand the savagery of the Land of the Knife ahead!\n\nThe journey to Peshawur, that ought to have been wearisome because\nthey were everlastingly shunted into sidings to make way for roaring\nsouth-bound troop trains and kept waiting at every wayside station\nbecause the trains ahead of them were blocked three deep, was no less\nthan a jubilee progress!\n\nNot a packed-in regiment went by that was not howled at by King's\nprisoners as if they were blood-brothers of every man in it. Many an\nofficer whom King knew waved to him from a passing train.\n\n\"Meet you in Berlin!\" was a favorite greeting. And after that they would\nshout to him for news and be gone before King could answer.\n\nMany a man, at stations where the sidings were all full and nothing\nless than miracles seemed able to release the wedged-in trains, came\nand paced up and down a platform side by side with King. From them he\nreceived opinions, but no sympathy to speak of.\n\n\"Got to stay in India? Hard lines!\" Then the conversation would be\nbluntly changed, for in the height of one's enthusiasm it is not decent\nto hurt another fellow's feelings. Simple, simple as a little child is\nthe clean-clipped British officer. \"Look at that babu, now. Don't you\nthink he's a marvel? Don't you think the Indian babu's a marvel? Sixty\na month is more than the beggar gets, and there he goes, doing two\njobs and straightening out tangled trains into the bargain! Isn't he a\nwonder, King?\"\n\n\"India's a wonderful country,\" King would answer, that being one of his\nstock remarks. And to his credit be it written that he never laughed at\none of them. He let them think they were more fortunate than he, with\nmanlier, bloodier work to do.\n\nPeshawur, when they reached it at last, looked dusty and bleak in the\ncomfortless light of Northern dawn. But the prisoners crowed and crooned\nit a greeting, and there was not much grumbling when King refused to\nunlock their compartment doors. Having waited thus long, they could\nendure a few more hours in patience, now that they could see and smell\ntheir \"Hills\" at last.\n\nAnd there was the general again, not in a dog-cart this time, but\nfuriously driven in a motor-car, roaring and clattering into the station\nless than two minutes after the train arrived. He was out of the car,\nfor all his age and weight, before it had come to a stand. He took one\nsteady look at King and then at the prisoners before he returned King's\nsalute.\n\n\"Good!\" he said. And then, as if that were not enough: \"Excellent! Don't\nlet 'em out, though, to chew the rag with people on the platform. Keep\n'em in!\"\n\n\"They're locked in, sir.\"\n\n\"Excellent! Come and walk up and down with me.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\n\n\n     Death roosts in the Khyber while he preens his wings!\n     --Native Proverb\n\n\n\"Seen her?\" asked the general, with his hands behind him.\n\n\"No,\" said King, looking sharply sidewise at him and walking stride for\nstride. His hands were behind him, too, and one of them covered the gold\nbracelet on his other wrist.\n\nThe general looked equally sharply sidewise.\n\n\"Nor've I,\" he said. \"She called me up over the phone yesterday to ask\nfor facilities for her man Rewa Gunga, and he was in here later. He's\nwaiting for you at the foot of the Pass--camped near the fort at Jamrud\nwith your bandobast all ready. She's on ahead--wouldn't wait.\"\n\nKing listened in silence, and his prisoners, watching him through the\nbarred compartment windows, formed new and golden opinions of him, for\nit is common knowledge in the \"Hills\" that when a burra sahib speaks\nto a chota sahib, the chota sahib ought to say, \"Yes, sir, oh, yes!\" at\nvery short intervals. Therefore King could not be a chota sahib after\nall. So much the better. The \"Hills\" ever loved to deal with men in\nauthority, just as they ever despised underlings.\n\n\"What made you go back for the prisoners?\" the general asked. \"Who gave\nyou that cue?\"\n\n\"It's a safe rule never to do what the other man expects, sir, and Rewa\nGunga expected me to travel by his train.\"\n\n\"Was that your only reason?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I had general reasons. None of 'em specific. Where natives\nhave a finger in the pie there's always something left undone at the\nlast minute.\"\n\n\"But what made you investigate those prisoners?\"\n\n\"Couldn't imagine why thirty men should be singled out for special\ntreatment. Rewa Gunga told me they were still at large in Delhi.\nCouldn't guess why. Had 'em arrested so's to be able to question 'em.\nThat's all, sir.\"\n\n\"Not nearly all!\" said the general. \"You realize by now, I suppose, that\nthey're her special men--special personal following?\"\n\n\"Guessed something of that sort.\"\n\n\"Well--she's clever. It occurred to her that the safest way to get\n'em up North was to have 'em arrested and deported. That would avoid\ninterference and delay and would give her a chance to act deliverer at\nthis end, and so make 'em grateful to her--you see? Rewa Gunga told me\nall this, you understand. He seems to think she's semi-divine. He was\nfull of her cleverness in having thought of letting 'em all get into\ndebt at a house of ill repute, so as to have 'em at hand when she wanted\n'em.\"\n\n\"She must have learned that trick from our merchant marine,\" said King.\n\n\"Maybe. She's clever. She asked me over the phone whether her thirty men\nhad started North. I sent a telegram in cypher to find out. The answer\nwas that you had found 'em and rounded 'em up and were bringing 'em with\nyou. When she called me up on the phone the second time I told her so,\nand I heard her chuckle with delight. So I emphasized the point of your\nhaving discovered 'em and saved 'em every wit whole and all that kind of\nthing. I asked her to come and see me, but she wouldn't,--said she was\n'disguised and particularly did not want to be recognized, which\nwas reasonable enough. She sent Rewa Gunga instead. Now, this seems\nimportant:\n\n\"Before I sent you down to Delhi--before I sent for you at all--I told\nher what I meant to do, and I never in my life knew a woman raise such\nterrific objections to working with a man. As it happened her objections\nonly confirmed my determination to send for you, and before she went\ndown to Delhi to clean up I told her flatly she would either have to\nwork with you or else stay in India for the duration of the war.\"\n\nThe general did not notice that King was licking his lips. Nor, if\nhe had noticed King's hand that now was in front of him pressing on\nsomething under his shirt, could he have guessed that the something\nwas a gold-hilted knife with a bronze blade. King grunted in token of\nattention, and the general continued.\n\n\"She gave in finally, but I felt nervous about it. Now, without your\ngetting sight of her--you say you haven't seen her?--her whole attitude\nhas changed! What have you done? Bringing up her thirty men seems a\nlittle enough thing. Yet, she swears by you! Used to swear at you, and\nnow says you're the only officer in the British army with enough brains\nto fill a helmet! Says she wouldn't go up the Khyber without you! Says\nyou're indispensable! Sent Rewa Gunga round to me with orders to\nmake sure I don't change my mind about you! What have you done to\nher--bewitched her?\"\n\n\"Done nothing,\" said King.\n\n\"Well, keep on doing nothing in the same style and the world shall\nrender you its best jobs, one after the other, in sequence! You've made\na good beginning!\"\n\n\"Know anything of Rewa Gunga, sir?\"\n\n\"Nothing, except that he's her man. She trusts him, so we've got to, and\nyou've got to take him up the Khyber with you. What she orders, he'll\ndo, or you may take it from me she would never have left him behind.\nAs long as she is on our side you will be pretty safe in trusting Rewa\nGunga. And she has got to be on our side. Got to be! She's the only key\nwe've got to Khinjan, and hell is brewing there this minute! She dare\nunlock the gates and ride the devil down the Khyber if she thought it\nworth her while! You're to go up the Khyber after her to convince her\nthat there are better mounts than the devil and better fun than playing\nwith hell-fire! The Rangar told me he had given you her passport--that\nright?\"\n\nAs they turned at the end of the platform King bared his wrist and\nshowed the gold bracelet.\n\n\"Good!\" said the general, but King thought his face clouded. \"That thing\nis worth more than a hundred men. Jack Allison wore that same bracelet,\nunless I'm much mistaken, on his way down in disguise from Bukhara. So\ndid another man we both knew; but he died. Be sure not to forget to give\nit back to her when the show's over, King.\"\n\nKing nodded and grunted. \"What's the news from Khinjan, sir?\"\n\n\"Nothing specific, except that the place is filling up. You remember\nwhat I told you about the 'Heart of the Hills' being in Khinjan? Well,\nthey say now that the 'Heart of the Hills' has been awake for a long\ntime, and that when the heart stirs the body does not lie quiet long. No\nuse trying to guess what they mean; go and find out. And remember--the\nwhole armed force at my disposal in this Province isn't more than enough\nto tempt the tribes to conclusions! It's a case for diplomacy. It's a\ncase where diplomacy must not fail.\"\n\nKing said nothing, but the chin-strap mark on his cheek and chin grew\nslightly whiter, as it always does under the stress of emotion. He\ncan not control it, and he has dyed it more than once on the eve of\nhappenings, there being no more wisdom in wearing feelings on one's face\nthan on a sleeve.\n\n\"Here comes your engine,\" said the general. \"Well--there are two\nbattalions of Khyber Rifles up the Pass and they're about at full\nstrength. They've got word already that you are gazetted to them.\nThey'll expect you. By the way, you've a brother in the K.R., haven't\nyou?\"\n\n\"At Ali Masjid, sir.\"\n\n\"Give him my regards when you see him, will you?\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"There's your engine whistling. You'd better hurry, Good-by, my boy. Get\nword to me whenever possible. Good luck to you! Regards to your brother!\nGood-by!\"\n\nKing saluted and stood watching while the general hurried to the waiting\nmotor-car. When the car whirled away in a din of dust he returned\nleisurely to the train that had been shortened to three coaches. Then he\ngave the signal to start up the spur-track, that leads to Jamrud, where\na fort cowers in the very throat of the dreadfulest gorge in Asia--the\nKhyber Pass.\n\nIt was not a long journey, nor a very slow one, for there was nothing to\nblock the way except occasional men with flags, who guarded culverts\nand little bridges. The Germans would know better than to waste time or\neffort on blowing up that track, but there might be Northern gentlemen\nat large, out to do damage for the sport of it, and the sepoys all along\nthe line were posted in twos, and awake.\n\nIt was low-tide under the Himalayas. The flood that was draining India\nof her armed men had left Jamrud high and dry with a little nondescript\nforce stranded there, as it were, under a British major and some native\nofficers. There were no more pomp and circumstance; no more of the\nreassuring thunder of gathering regiments, nor for that matter any more\nof that unarmed native helplessness that so stiffens the backs of the\nofficial English.\n\nFrowning over Jamrud were the lean \"Hills,\" peopled by the fiercest\nfighting men on earth, and the clouds that hung over the Khyber's course\nwere an accent to the savagery.\n\nBut King smiled merrily as he jumped out of the train, and Rewa Gunga,\nwho was there to meet him, advanced with outstretched hand and a smile\nthat would have melted snow on the distant peaks if he had only looked\nthe other way.\n\n\"Welcome, King sahib!\" he laughed, with the air of a skilled fencer who\nadmires another, better one. \"I shall know better another time and let\nyou keep in front of me! No more getting first into a train and settling\ndown for the night! It may not be easy to follow you, and I suspect it\nisn't, but at least it jolly well can't be such a job as leading you! I\ntrust you had a comfortable journey?\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said King, shaking hands with him, and then turning away to\nunlock the carriage doors that held his prisoners in. They were baying\nnow like wolves to be free, and they surged out, like wolves from a\ncage, to clamor round the Rangar, pawing him and struggling to be first\nto ask him questions.\n\n\"Nay, ye mountain people; nay!\" he laughed. \"I, too, am from the plains!\nWhat do I know of your families or of your feuds? Am I to be torn to\npieces to make a meal?\"\n\nAt that Ismail interfered, with the aid of an ash pick-handle,\nchance-found beside the track.\n\n\"Hill-bastards!\" he howled at them, beating at them as if they were\nsheaves and his cudgel were a flail. \"Sons of nameless mothers!\nForgotten of God! Shameless! Brood of the evil one! Hands off!\"\n\nKing had to stop him, not that he feared trouble, for they did not seem\nto resent either abuse or cudgeling in the least--and that in itself was\nfood for thought; but broken shoulders are no use for carrying loads.\n\nLaughing as if the whole thing was the greatest joke imaginable, Rewa\nGunga fell into stride beside King and led him away in the direction of\nsome tents.\n\n\"She is up the Pass ahead of us,\" he announced. \"She was in the deuce of\na hurry, I can assure you. She wanted to wait and meet you, but matters\nwere too jolly well urgent, and we shall have our bally work cut out to\ncatch her, you can bet! But I have everything ready--tents and beds and\nstores--everything!\"\n\nKing looked over his shoulder to make sure that Ismail was bringing the\nlittle leather bag along.\n\n\"So have I,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"I have horses,\" said Rewa Gunga, \"and mules and--\"\n\n\"How did she travel up the Khyber?\" King asked him, and the Rangar\nspared him a curious sidewise glance.\n\n\"On a horse. You should have seen the horse!\"\n\n\"What escort had she?\"\n\n\"She?\"\n\nRewa Gunga chuckled and then suddenly grew serious.\n\n\"The 'Hills' are her escort, King sahib. She is mistress in the 'Hills.'\nThere isn't a murdering ruffian who would not lie down and let her walk\non him! She rode away alone on a thoroughbred mare and she jolly well\nleft me the mare's double on which to follow her. Come and look.\"\n\nNot far from where the tents had been pitched in a cluster a string of\nhorses winnied at a picket rope. King saw the two good horses ready for\nhimself, and ten mules beside them that would have done credit to any\noutfit. But at the end of the line, pawing at the trampled grass, was a\nblack mare that made his eyes open wide. Once in a hundred years or so\na viceroy's cup, or a Derby is won by an animal that can stand and look\nand move as that mare did.\n\n\"Just watch!\" the Rangar boasted; hooking up the bit and throwing off\nthe blanket. And as he mounted into the native-made rough-hide saddle\na shout went up from the fort and native officers and half the soldiery\ncame out to watch the poetry of motion.\n\nThe mare was not the only one worth watching; her rider shared the\npraise. There was something unexpected, although not in the least\nungainly, about the Rangar's seat in the saddle that was not the\nordinary, graceful native balance and yet was full of grace. King\nascribed the difference to the fact that the Rangar had seen no military\nservice, and before the inadequacy of that explanation had asserted\nitself he had already forgotten to criticize in sheer admiration.\n\nThere was none of the spurring and back-reining that some native bloods\nof India mistake for horse-manship. The Rangar rode with sympathy and\nmost consummate skill, and the result was that the mare behaved as if\nshe were part of him, responding to his thoughts, putting a foot where\nhe wished her to put it and showing her wildest turn of speed along a\nlevel stretch in instant response to his mood.\n\n\"Never saw anything better,\" King admitted ungrudgingly, as the mare\ncame back at a walk to her picket rope.\n\n\"There is only one mare like this one,\" laughed the Rangar. \"She has\nher.\"\n\n\"What'll you take for this one?\" King asked him. \"Name your price!\"\n\n\"The mare is hers. You must ask her. Who knows? She is generous. There\nis nobody on earth more generous than she when she cares to be. See what\nyou wear on your wrist!\"\n\n\"That is a loan,\" said King, uncovering the bracelet. \"I shall give it\nback to her when we meet.\"\n\n\"See what she says when you meet!\" laughed the Rangar, taking a\ncigarette from his jeweled case with an air and smiling as he lighted\nit. \"There is your tent, sahib.\"\n\nHe motioned with the cigarette toward a tent pitched quite a hundred\nyards away from the others and from the Rangar's own; with the Rangar's\nand the cluster of tents for the men it made an equilateral triangle, so\nthat both he and the Rangar had privacy.\n\nWith a nod of dismissal, King walked over to inspect the bandobast, and\nfinding it much more extravagant than he would have dreamed of providing\nfor himself, he lit one of his black cheroots, and with hands clasped\nbehind him strolled over to the fort to interview Courtenay, the officer\ncommanding.\n\nIt so happened that Courtenay had gone up the Pass that morning with\nhis shotgun after quail. He came back into view, followed by his little\nten-man escort just as King neared the fort, and King timed his approach\nso as to meet him. The men of the escort were heavily burdened; he could\nsee that from a distance.\n\n\"Hello!\" he said by the fort gate, cheerily, after he had saluted and\nthe salute had been returned.\n\n\"Oh, hello, King! Glad to see you. Heard you were coming, of course.\nAnything I can do?\"\n\n\"Tell me anything you know,\" said King, offering him a cheroot which the\nother accepted. As he bit off the end they stood facing each other, so\nthat King could see the oncoming escort and what it carried. Courtenay\nread his eyes.\n\n\"Two of my men!\" he said. \"Found 'em up the Pass. Gazi work I think.\nThey were cut all to pieces. There's a big lashkar gathering somewhere\nin the 'Hills,' and it might have been done by their skirmishers, but I\ndon't think so.\"\n\n\"A lashkar besides the crowd at Khinjan?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Who's supposed to be leading it?\"\n\n\"Can't find out,\" said Courtenay. Then he stepped aside to give orders\nto the escort. They carried the dead bodies into the fort.\n\n\"Know anything of Yasmini?\" King asked, when the major stood in front of\nhim again.\n\n\"By reputation, of course, yes. Famous person--sings like a\nbulbul--dances like the devil--lived in Delhi--mean her?\"\n\nKing nodded. \"When did she start up the Pass?\" he asked.\n\n\"How d'ye mean?\" Courtenay demanded sharply.\n\n\"To-day or yesterday?\"\n\n\"She didn't start! I know who goes up and who comes down. Would you care\nto glance over the list?\"\n\n\"Know anything of Rewa Gunga?\" King asked him.\n\n\"Not much. Tried to buy his mare. Seen the animal? Gad! I'd give a\nyear's pay for that beast! He wouldn't sell and I don't blame him.\"\n\n\"He goes up the Khyber with me,\" said King. \"He's what the Turks would\ncall my youldash.\"\n\n\"And the Persians a hamrah, eh? There was an American here lately--merry\nfellow--and I was learning his language. Side partner's the word in\nthe States. I can imagine a worse side partner than that same man Rewa\nGunga--much worse.\"\n\n\"He told me just now,\" said King, \"that Yasmini went up the Pass\nunescorted, mounted on a mare the very dead spit of the black one you\nsay you wanted to buy.\"\n\nCourtenay whistled.\n\n\"I'm sorry, King. I'm sorry to say he lied.\"\n\n\"Will you come and listen while I have it out with him?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nKing threw away his less-than-half-consumed cheroot and they started to\nwalk together toward King's camp. After a few minutes they arrived at a\npoint from which they could see the prisoners lined up in a row facing\nRewa Gunga. A less experienced eye than King's or Courtenay's could have\nrecognized their attitude of reverent obedience.\n\n\"He'll make a good adjutant for you, that man,\" said Courtenay; but King\nonly grunted.\n\nAt sight of them Ismail left the line and came hurrying toward them with\nlong mountainman's strides.\n\n\"Tell Rewa Gunga sahib that I wish to speak to him!\" King called, and\nIsmail hurried back again.\n\nWithin two minutes the Rangar stood facing them, looking more at ease\nthan they.\n\n\"I was cautioning those savages!\" he explained. \"They're an escort, but\nthey need a reminder of the fact, else they might jolly well imagine\nthemselves mountain goats and scatter among the 'Hills'!\"\n\nHe drew out his wonderful cigarette case and offered it open to\nCourtenay, who hesitated, and then helped himself. King refused.\n\n\"Major Courtenay has just told me,\" said King, \"that nobody resembling\nYasmini has gone up the Pass recently. Can you explain?\"\n\n\"You see, I've been watching the Pass,\" explained Courtenay.\n\nThe Rangar shook his head, blew smoke through his nose and laughed.\n\n\"And you did not see her go?\" he said, as if he were very much amused.\n\n\"No,\" said Courtenay. \"She didn't go.\"\n\n\"Can you explain?\" asked King rather stiffly.\n\n\"Do you mean, can I explain why the major failed to see her? 'Pon my\nsoul, King sahib, d'you want me to insult the man? Yasmini is too jolly\nclever for me, or for any other man I ever met; and the major's a\nman, isn't he? He may pack the Khyber so full of men that there's only\nstanding room and still she'll go up without his leave if she chooses!\nThere is nobody like Yasmini in all the world!\"\n\nThe Rangar was looking past them, facing the great gorge that lets the\nNorth of Asia trickle down into India and back again when weather and\nthe tribes permit. His eyes had become interested in the distance. King\nwondered why--and looked--and saw. Courtenay saw, too.\n\n\"Hail that man and bring him here!\" he ordered.\n\nIsmail, keeping his distance with ears and eyes peeled, heard instantly\nand hurried off. He went like the wind and all three watched in silence\nfor ten minutes while he headed off a man near the mouth of the Pass,\nstopped him, spoke to him and brought him along. Fifteen minutes later\nan Afridi stood scowling in front of them with a little letter in\na cleft stick in his hand. He held it out and Courtenay took it and\nsniffed.\n\n\"Well--I'll be blessed! A note\"--sniff--sniff--\"on scented paper!\"\nSniff--sniff! \"Carried down the Khyber in a split stick! Take it,\nKing--it's addressed to you.\"\n\nKing obeyed and sniffed too. It smelt of something far more subtle than\nmusk. He recognized the same strange scent that had been wafted from\nbehind Yasmini's silken hangings in her room in Delhi. As he unfolded\nthe note--it was not sealed--he found time for a swift glance at Rewa\nGunga's face. The Rangar seemed interested and amused.\n\n        \"Dear Captain King,\" the note ran, in English.  \"Kindly\n        be quick to follow me, because there is much talk of a\n        lashkar getting ready for a raid.  I shall wait for\n        you in Khinjan, whither my messenger shall show the way.\n        Please let him keep his rifle.  Trust him, and Rewa\n        Gunga and my thirty whom you brought with you.  The\n        messenger's name is Darya Khan.\n\n                \"Your servant,\n\n                        \"Ysamini.\"\n\nHe passed the note to Courtenay, who read it and passed it back.\n\n\"Are you the messenger who is to show this sahib the road to Khinjan?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"Aye!\"\n\n\"But you are one of three who left here and went up the Pass at dawn! I\nrecognize you.\"\n\n\"Aye!\" said the man. \"She met me and gave me this letter and sent me\nback.\"\n\n\"How great is the lashkar that is forming?\" asked Courtenay.\n\n\"Some say three thousand men. They speak truth. They who say five\nthousand are liars. There is a lashkar.\"\n\n\"And she went up alone?\" King murmured aloud in Pashtu.\n\n\"Is the moon alone in the sky?\" the fellow asked, and King smiled at\nhim.\n\n\"Let us hurry after her, sahib!\" urged Rewa Gunga, and King looked\nstraight into his eyes, that were like pools of fire, just as they had\nbeen that night in the room in Delhi. He nodded and the Rangar grinned.\n\n\"Better wait until dawn,\" advised Courtenay. \"The Pass is supposed to be\nclosed at dusk.\"\n\n\"I shall have to ask for special permission, sir.\"\n\n\"Granted, of course.\"\n\n\"Then, we'll start at eight to-night!\" said King, glancing at his watch\nand snapping the gold case shut.\n\n\"Dine with me,\" said Courtenay.\n\n\"Yes, please. Got to pack first. Daren't trust anybody else.\"\n\n\"Very well. We'll dine in my tent at six-thirty,\" said Courtenay. \"So\nlong!\"\n\n\"So long, sir,\" said King, and each went about his own business, King\nwith the Rangar, and Ismail and all thirty prisoners at his heels, and\nCourtenay alone, but that much more determined.\n\n\"I'll find out,\" the major muttered, \"how she got up the Pass without my\nknowing it. Somebody's tail shall be twisted for this!\"\n\nBut he did not find out until King told him, and that was many days\nlater, when a terrible cloud no longer threatened India from the North.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\n\n\n     Oh, a broken blade,\n     And an empty bag,\n     And a sodden kit,\n     And a foundered nag,\n     And a whimpering wind\n     Are more or less\n     Ground for a gentleman's distress.\n     Yet the blade will cut,\n     (He should swing with a will!)\n     And the emptiest bag\n     He may readiest fill;\n     And the nag will trot\n     If the man has a mind,\n     So the kit he may dry\n     In the whimpering wind.\n     Shades of a gallant past--confess!\n     How many fights were won with less?\n\n\n\"I think I envy you!\" said Courtenay.\n\nThey were seated in Courtenay's tent, face to face across the low table,\nwith guttering lights between and Ismail outside the tent handing plates\nand things to Courtenay's servant inside.\n\n\"You're about the first who has admitted it,\" said King.\n\nNot far from them a herd of pack-camels grunted and bubbled after the\nevening meal. The evening breeze brought the smoke of dung fires down\nto them, and an Afghan--one of the little crowd of traders who had come\ndown with the camels three hours ago--sang a wailing song about his\nlady-love. Overhead the sky was like black velvet, pierced with silver\nholes.\n\n\"You see, you can't call our end of this business war--it's sport,\"\nsaid Courtenay. \"Two battalions of Khyber Rifles, hired to hold the Pass\nagainst their own relations. Against them a couple of hundred thousand\ntribesmen, very hungry for loot, armed with up-to-date rifles, thanks\nto Russia yesterday and Germany to-day, and all perfectly well aware\nthat a world war is in progress. That's sport, you know--not the 'image\nand likeness of war' that Jorrocks called it, but the real red root. And\nyou've got a mystery thrown in to give it piquancy. I haven't found out\nyet how Yasmini got up the Pass without my knowledge. I thought it was a\ntrick. Didn't believe she'd gone. Yet all my mer swear they know she\nhas gone, and not one of them will own to having seen her go! What d'you\nthink of that?\"\n\n\"Tell you later,\" said King, \"when I've been in the 'Hills' a while.\"\n\n\"What d'you suppose I'm going to say, eh? Shall I enter in my diary that\na chit came down the Pass from a woman who never went up it? Or shall I\nsay she went up while I was looking the other way?\"\n\n\"Help yourself!\" laughed King.\n\n\"Laugh on! I envy you! I f the worst comes to the worst, you'll have\nhad the best end of it. If you fail up there in the 'Hills' you'll get\nscoughed and be done with you. You'll at least have had a show. All we\nshall know of your failure will be the arrival of the flood! We'll be\nswamped ingloriously--shot, skinned alive and crucified without a chance\nof doing anything but wait for it! You're in luck--you can move about\nand keep off the fidgets!\"\n\nFor a while, as he ate Courtenay's broiled quail, King did not answer.\nBut the merry smile had left his eyes and he seemed for once to be\nletting his mind dwell on conditions as they concerned himself.\n\n\"How many men have you at the fort?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"Two hundred. Why?\"\n\n\"All natives?\"\n\n\"To a man.\"\n\n        \"Like 'em?\"\n\n\"What's the use of talking?\" answered Courtenay. \"You know what it means\nwhen men of an alien race stand up to you and grin when they salute.\nThey're my own.\"\n\nKing nodded. \"Die with you, eh?\"\n\n\"To the last man,\" said Courtenay quietly with that conviction that can\nonly be arrived at in one way, and that not the easiest.\n\n\"I'd die alone,\" said King. \"It'll be lonely in the 'Hills.' Got any\nmore quail?\"\n\nAnd that was all he ever did say on that subject, then or at any other\ntime.\n\n\"Here's to her!\" laughed Courtenay at last, rising and holding up his\nglass. \"We can't explain her, so let's drink to her! No heel-taps!\nHere's to Rewa Gunga's mistress, Yasmini!\"\n\n\"May she show good hunting!\" answered King, draining his glass; and it\nwas his first that day. \"If it weren't for that note of hers that came\ndown the Pass, and for one or two other things, I'd almost believe her\na myth--one of those supposititious people who are supposed to express\nsome ideal or other. Not an hallucination, you understand--nor exactly\nan embodied spirit, either. Perhaps the spirit of a problem. Let y be\nthe Khyber district, z the tribes, and x the spirit of the rumpus. Find\nx. Get me?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. Got quinine in your kit, by the way?\"\n\n\"Plenty, thanks.\"\n\n\"What shall you do first after you get up the Pass? Call on your brother\nat Ali Masjid? He's likely to know a lot by the time you get there.\"\n\n\"Not sure,\" said King. \"May and may not. I'd like to see him. Haven't\nseen the old chap in a donkey's age. How is he?\"\n\n\"Well two days ago,\" said Courtenay. \"What's your general plan?\"\n\n\"Hunt!\" said King. \"Hunt for x and report. Hunt for the spirit of the\ncoming ruction and try to scrag it! Live in the open when I can, sleep\nwith the lice when it rains or snows, eat dead goat and bad bread, I\nexpect; scratch myself when I'm not looking, and take a tub at the first\nopportunity. When you see me on my way back, have a bath made ready for\nme, will you--and keep to windward!\"\n\n\"Certainly!\" said Courtenay. \"What's the Rangar going to do with that\nmare of his? Suppose he'll leave her at Ali Masjid? He'll have to leave\nher somewhere on the way. She'll get stolen. Gad! That's the brightest\nnotion yet! I'll make a point of buying her from the first horse-thief\nwho comes traipsing down the Pass!\"\n\n\"Here's wishing you luck!\" said King. \"It's time to go, sir.\"\n\nHe rose, and Courtenay walked with him to where his party waited in the\ndark, chilled by the cold wind whistling down the Khyber. Rewa Gunga\nsat, mounted, at their head, and close to him his personal servant rode\nanother horse. Behind them were the mules, and then in a cluster, each\nwith a load of some sort on his head, were the thirty prisoners, and\nIsmail took charge of them officiously. Darya Khan, the man who had\nbrought the letter down the Pass, kept close to Ismail.\n\n\"Are you armed?\" King asked, as soon as he could see the whites of the\nRangar's eyes through the gloom.\n\n\"You jolly well bet I am!\" the Rangar laughed.\n\nKing mounted, and Courtenay shook hands; then he went to Rewa Gunga's\nside and shook hands with him, too.\n\n\"Good-by!\" called King.\n\n\"Good-by and good luck!\"\n\n\"Forward! March!\" King ordered, and the little procession started.\n\n\"Oh, men of the 'Hills,' ye look like ghosts--like graveyard ghosts!\"\njeered Courtenay, as they all filed past him. \"Ye look like dead men,\ngoing to be judged!\"\n\nNobody answered. They strode behind the horses, with the swift silent\nstrides of men who are going home to the \"Hills\"; but even they, born in\nthe \"Hills\"' and knowing them as a wolf-pack knows its hunting-ground,\nwere awed by the gloom of Khyber-mouth ahead. King's voice was the first\nto break the silence, and he did not speak until Courtenay was out of\near-shot. Then:\n\n\"Men of the 'Hills'!\" he called. \"Kuch dar nahin hai!\"\n\n\"Nahin hai! Hah!\" shouted Ismail. \"So speaks a man! Hear that, ye\nmountain folk! He says, 'There is no such thing as fear!'\"\n\nIn his place in the lead, King whistled softly to himself; but he drew\nan automatic pistol from its place beneath his armpit and transferred it\nto a readier position.\n\nFear or no fear, Khyber-mouth is haunted after dark by the men whose\nblood-feuds are too reeking raw to let them dare go home and for whom\nthe British hangman very likely waits a mile or two farther south. It is\none of the few places in the world where a pistol is better than a thick\nstick.\n\nBoulder, crag and loose rock faded into gloom behind; in front on both\nhands ragged hillsides were beginning to close in; and the wind, whose\nhome is in Allah's refuse heap, whistled as it searched busily among\nthe black ravines. Then presently the shadow of the thousand-foot-high\nKhyber walls began to cover them, and King drew rein to count them all\nand let them close up. To have let them straggle after that point would\nbe tantamount to murder probably.\n\n\"Ride last!\" he ordered Rewa Gunga. \"You've got the only other pistol,\nhaven't you?\"\n\nDarya Khan, who had brought the letter, had a rifle; so King gave him a\nroving commission on the right flank.\n\nThey moved on again after five minutes, in the same deep silence,\nlooking like ghosts in search of somebody to ferry them across the Styx.\nOnly the glow of King's cheroot, and the lesser, quicker fire of Rewa\nGunga's cigarette, betrayed humanity, except that once or twice King's\nhorse would put a foot wrong and be spoken to.\n\n\"Hold up!\"\n\nBut from five or ten yards away that might have been a new note in the\ngaining wind or even nothing.\n\nAfter a while King's cheroot went out, and he threw it away. A little\nlater Rewa Gunga threw away his cigarette. After that, the veriest\nfive-year-old among the Zakka Khels, watching sleepless over the rim of\nsome stone watch-tower, could have taken oath that the Khyber's unburied\ndead were prowling in search of empty graves. Probably their uncanny\nsilence was their best protection; but Rewa Gunga chose to break it\nafter a time.\n\n\"King sahib!\" he called softly, repeating it louder and more loudly\nuntil King heard him. \"Slowly! Not so fast!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nKing did not check speed by a fraction, but the Rangar legged his mare\ninto a canter and forced him to pull out to the left of the track and\nmake room.\n\n\"Because, sahib, there are men among those boulders, and to go too\nfast is to make them think you are afraid! To seem afraid is to invite\nattack! Can we defend ourselves, with three firearms between us? Look!\nWhat was that?\"\n\nThey were at the point where the road begins to lead up-hill, westward,\nleaving the bed of a ravine and ascending to join the highway built\nby British engineers. Below, to left and right, was pit-mouth gloom,\nshadows amid shadows, full of eerie whisperings, and King felt the short\nhair on his neck begin to rise.\n\nSo he urged his horse forward, because what Rewa Gunga said is true.\nThere is only one surer key to trouble in the Khyber than to seem\nafraid--and that is to be afraid. And to have sat his horse there\nlistening to the Rangar's whisperings and trying to see through shadows\nwould have been to invite fear, of the sort that grows into panic.\n\nThe Rangar followed him, close up, and both horse and mare sensed\nexcitement. The mare's steel shoes sent up a shower of sparks, and King\nturned to rebuke the Rangar. Yet he did not speak. Never, in all the\nyears he had known India and the borderland beyond, had he seen eyes so\nsuggestive of a tiger's in the dark! Yet they were not the same color as\na tiger's, nor the same size, nor the same shape!\n\n\"Look, sahib!\"\n\n\"Look at what?\"\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nAfter a second or two he caught a glimpse of bluish flame that flashed\nsuddenly and died again, somewhere below to the right. Then all at once\nthe flame burned brighter and steadier and began to move and to grow.\n\n\"Halt!\" King thundered; and his voice was as sharp and unexpected as a\npistol-crack. This was something tangible, that a man could tackle--a\nperfect antidote for nerves.\n\nThe blue light continued on a zigzag course, as if a man were running\namong boulders with an unusual sort of torch; and as there was no answer\nKing drew his pistol, took about thirty seconds' aim and fired. He fired\nstraight at the blue light.\n\nIt vanished instantly, into measureless black silence.\n\n\"Now you've jolly well done it, haven't you!\"' the Rangar laughed in his\near. \"That was her blue light--Yasmini's!\"\n\nIt was a minute before King answered, for both animals were all but\nfrantic with their sense of their riders' state of mind; it needed\nhorsemanship to get them back under control.\n\n\"How do you know whose light it was?\" King demanded, when the horse and\nmare were head to head again.\n\n\"It was prearranged. She promised me a signal at the point where I am to\nleave the track!\"\n\n\"Where's that guide?\" demanded King; and Darya Khan came forward out of\nthe night, with his rifle cocked and ready.\n\n\"Did she not say Khinjan is the destination?\"'\n\n\"Aye!\" the fellow answered.\n\n\"I know the way to Khinjan. That is not it. Get down there and find out\nwhat that light was. Shout back what you find!\"\n\nThe man obeyed instantly and sprang down into darkness. But King had\nhardly given the order when shame told him he had sent a native on an\nerrand he had no liking for himself.\n\n\"Come back!\" he shouted. \"I'll go.\"\n\nBut the man had gone, slipping noiselessly in the dark from rock to\nrock.\n\nSo King drove both spurs home, and set his unwilling horse to scrambling\ndownward at an angle he could not guess, into blackness he could feel,\ntrusting the animal to find a footing where his own eyes could make out\nnothing.\n\nTo his disgust he heard the Rangar follow immediately. To his even\ngreater disgust the black mare overtook him. And even then, with his own\nmount stumbling and nearly pitching him headforemost at each lurch, he\nwas forced to admire the mare's goatlike agility, for she descended into\nthe gorge in running leaps, never setting a wrong foot. When he and his\nhorse reached the bottom at last he found the Rangar waiting for him.\n\n\"This way, sahib!\"\n\nThe next he knew sparks from the black mare's heels were kicking up in\nfront of him, and a wild ride had begun such as he had never yet dreamed\nof. There was no catching up, for the black mare could gallop two to\nhis horse's one; but he set his teeth and followed into solid night,\ntrusting ear, eye, guesswork and the God of Secret Service men who loves\nthe reckless.\n\nOnce in a minute or so he would see a spark, or a shower of them, where\nthe mare took a turn in a hurry. Once in every two or three minutes he\ncaught sight for a second of the same blue siren light that had started\nthe race. He suspected that there were many torches placed at intervals.\nIt could not be one man running. More than once it occurred to him to\ndraw and shoot, but that thought died into the darkness whence it came.\nNever once while he rode did he forget to admire the Rangar's courage or\nthe black mare's speed.\n\nHis own horse developed a speed and stamina he had not suspected, and\nprobably the Rangar did not dare extend the mare to her limit in the\ndark; at all events, for ten, perhaps fifteen, minutes of breathless\ngalloping he almost made a race of it, keeping the Rangar, either within\nsight or sound.\n\nBut then the mare swerved suddenly behind a boulder and was gone. He\nspurred round the same great rock a minute later, and was faced by a\nblank wall of shale that brought his horse up all standing. It led\nsteep up for a thousand feet to the sky-line. There was not so much as a\ngoat-track to show in which direction the mare had gone, nor a sound of\nany kind to guide him.\n\nHe dismounted and stumbled about on foot for about ten minutes with his\neyes two feet from the earth, trying to find some trace of hoof. Then he\nlistened, with his ear to the ground. There was no result.\n\nHe knew better than to shout, for that would sound like a cry of\ndistress, and there is no mercy whatever in the \"Hills\" for lost\nwanderers, or for men who seem lost. He had not a doubt there were\nmen with long jezails lurking not far away, to say nothing of those\nresponsible for the blue torchlight.\n\nAfter some thought be mounted and began to hunt the way back,\nremembering turns and twists with a gift for direction that natives\nmight well have envied him. He found his way back to the foot of the\nroad at a trot, where ninety-nine men out of almost any hundred would\nhave been lost hopelessly; and close to the road he overtook Darya Khan,\nhugging his rifle and staring about like a scorpion at bay.\n\n\"Did you expect that blue light, and this galloping away?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nay, sahib; I knew nothing of it! I was told to lead the way to\nKhinjan.\"\n\n\"Come on, then!\"\n\nHe set his horse at the boulder-strewn slope and had to dismount to lead\nhim at the end of half a minute. At the end of a minute both he and the\nmessenger were hauling at the reins and the horse had grown frantic from\nfear of falling backward. He shouted for help, and Ismail and another\nman came leaping down, looking like the devils of the rocks, to lend\ntheir strength. Ismail tightened his long girdle and stung the other two\nwith whiplash words, so that Darya Khan overcame prejudice to the point\nof stowing his rifle between some rocks and lending a hand. Then it took\nall four of them fifteen minutes to heave and haul the struggling animal\nto the level road above.\n\nThere, with eyes long grown used to the dark, King stared about him,\nrecovering his breath and feeling in his pockets for a fresh cheroot and\nmatches. He struck a match and watched it to be sure his hand did not\nshake before he spoke, because one of Cocker's rules is that a man must\ncommand himself before trying it on others.\n\n\"Where are the others?\" he asked, when he was certain of himself.\n\n\"Gone!\" boomed Ismail, still panting, for he had heaved and dragged more\nstoutly than had all the rest together.\n\nKing took a dozen pulls at the cheroot and stared about again. In the\nmiddle of the road stood his second horse, and three mules with his\nbaggage, including the unmarked medicine chest. Close to them were\nthree men, making the party now only six all told, including Darya Khan,\nhimself and Ismail.\n\n\"Gone whither?\" he asked.\n\n\"Whither?\"\n\nIsmail's voice was eloquent of shocked surprise.\n\n\"They followed! Was it then thy baggage on the other mules? Were they\nthy men? They led the mules and went!\"\n\n\"Who ordered them?\"\n\n\"Allah! Need the night be ordered to follow the Day?\"\n\n\"Who told them whither to go?\"\n\n\"Who told the moon where the night was?\" Ismail answered.\n\n\"And thou?\"\n\n\"I am thy man! She bade me be thy man!\"\n\n\"And these?\"\n\n\"Try them!\"\n\nKing bethought him of his wrist, that was heavy with the weight of gold\non it. He drew back his sleeve and held it up.\n\n\"May God be with thee!\" boomed all five men at once, and the Khyber\nnight gave back their voices, like the echoing of a well.\n\nKing took his reins and mounted.\n\n\"What now?\" asked Ismail, picking up the leather bag that he regarded as\nhis own particular charge.\n\n\"Forward!\" said King. \"Come along!\"\n\nHe began to set a fairly fast pace, Ismail leading the spare horse and\nthe others towing the mules along. Except for King, who was modern and\nout of the picture, they looked like Old Testament patriarchs, hurrying\nout of Egypt, as depicted in the illustrated Bibles of a generation\nago--all leaning forward--each man carrying a staff--and none looking to\nthe right or left.\n\nAfter a time the moon rose and looked at them from over a distant ridge\nthat was thousands of feet higher than the ragged fringe of Khyber wall.\nThe little mangy jackals threw up their heads to howl at it; and after\nthat there was pale light diffused along the track, and they could\nsee so well that King set a faster pace, and they breathed hard in the\neffort to keep up. He did not draw rein until it was nearly time for\nthe Pass to begin narrowing and humping upward to the narrow gut at Ali\nMasjid. But then he halted suddenly. The jackals had ceased howling, and\nthe very spirit of the Khyber seemed to hold its breath and listen.\n\nIn that shuddersome ravine unusual sounds will rattle along sometimes\nfrom wall to wall and gully to gully, multiplying as they go, until\nnight grows full of thunder. So it was now that they heard a staccato\ncannonade--not very loud yet, but so quick, so pulsating, so filling to\nthe ears that he could judge nothing about the sound at all, except that\nwhatever caused it must be round a corner out of sight.\n\nAt first, for a few minutes King suspected it was Rewa Gunga's mare,\ngalloping over hard rock away ahead of him. Then he knew it was a horse\napproaching. After that he became nearly sure he was mistaken altogether\nand that the drums were being beaten at a village--until he remembered\nthere was no village near enough and no drums in any case.\n\nIt was the behavior of the horse he rode, and of the led one and the\nmules, that announced at last beyond all question that a horse was\ncoming down the Khyber in a hurry. One of the mules brayed until the\nwhole gorge echoed with the insult, and a man hit him hard on the nose\nto silence him.\n\nKing legged his horse into the shadow of a great rock. And after\nshepherding the men and mules into another shadow, Ismail came and held\nhis stirrup, with the leather bag in the other hand. The bag fascinated\nhim, because he did not know what was in it, and it was plain that he\nmeant to cling to it until death or King should put an end to curiosity.\n\nKing drew his pistol. Ismail drew in his breath with a hissing sound, as\nif he and not King were the marksman. King notched the foresight against\nthe corner of a crag, at a height that ought to be an inch or two above\nan oncoming horse's ears, and Ismail nodded sagely. Whoever now should\ngallop round that rock would be obliged to cross the line of fire. Such\nare the vagaries of the Khyber's night echoes that it was a long five\nminutes yet before a man appeared at last, riding like the night wind,\non a horse that seemed to be very nearly on his last legs. The beast was\ngoing wildly, sobbing, with straggled ears.\n\nInstead of speaking, King spurred out of the shadow and blocked the\noncoming horseman's way, making his own horse meet the other shoulder to\nbreast, knocking most of the remaining wind out of him. At risk of his\nown life, Ismail seized the man's reins. The sparks flew, and there\nwas a growled oath; but the long and the short of it was that the rider\nsquinted uncomfortably down the barrel of King's repeating pistol.\n\n\"Give an account of yourself!\" commanded King.\n\nThe man did not answer. He was a jezailchi of the Khyber\nRifles--hook-nosed as an osprey--black-bearded--with white teeth\nglistening out of a gap in the darkness of his lower face. And he was\narmed with a British government rifle, although that is no criterion\nin that borderland of professional thieves where many a man has offered\nhimself for enlistment with a stolen government rifle in his grasp.\n\nThe waler he rode was an officer's charger. The poor brute sobbed and\nheaved and sweated in his tracks as his rightful owner surely had never\nmade him do.\n\n\"Whither?\" King demanded.\n\n\"Jamrud!\"\n\nThe jezailchi growled the one-word answer with one eye on King, but the\nother eye still squinted down the pistol barrel warily.\n\n\"Have you a letter?\"\n\nThe man did not answer.\n\n\"You may speak to me. I am of your regiment. I am Captain King.\"\n\n\"That is a lie, and a poor one!\" the fellow answered. \"But a very little\nwhile ago I spoke with King sahib in Ali Masjid Fort, and he is no\ncappitin, he is leftnant. Therefore thou art a liar twice over--nay,\nthree times! Thou art no officer of Khyber Rifles! I am a jezailchi, and\nI know them all!\"\n\n\"None the less,\" said King, \"I am an officer of the Khyber Rifles, newly\nappointed. I asked you, have you a letter?\"\n\n\"Aye!\"\n\n\"Let me see it.\"\n\n\"Nay!\"\n\n\"I order you!\"\n\n\"Nay! I am a true man! I will eat the letter rather!\"\n\n\"Tell me who wrote it, then.\"\n\nBut the fellow shook his head, still eying the pistol as if it were a\nsnake about to strike.\n\n\"I have eaten the salt!\" he said. \"May dogs eat me if I break faith! Who\nart thou, to ask me to break faith? An arrficer? That must be a lie!\nThe letter is from him who wrote it, to whom I bear it--and that is my\nanswer if I die this minute!\"\n\nKing let his reins fall and raised his left wrist until the moonlight\nglinted on the gold of his bracelet under the jezailchi's very eyes.\n\n\"May God be with thee!\" said the man at once.\n\n\"From whom is your letter, and to whom?\" asked King, wondering what the\nmen in the clubs at home would say if they knew that a woman's bracelet\ncould outweigh authority on British sod; for the Khyber Pass is as much\nBritish as the air is an eagle's or Korea Japanese, or Panama United\nStates American, and the Khyber jezailchis are paid to help keep it so.\n\n\"From the karnal sahib (colonel) at Landi Kotal, whose horse I ride,\"\nsaid the jezailchi slowly, \"to the arrficer at Jamrud. To King sahib,\nthe arrficer at Ali Masjid I bore a letter also, and left it as I\npassed.\"\n\n\"Had they no spare horse at Ali Masjid? That beast is foundered.\"\n\n\"There are two horses there, and both lame. The man who thou sayest is\nthy brother is heavy on horses.\"\n\nKing nodded. \"What is in the letter?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nay! Have I eyes that can see through paper?\"\n\n\"Thou hast ears that can listen!\" answered King.\n\n\"In the letter that I left at Ali Masjid there is news of the lashkar\nthat is gathering in the 'Hills,' above Ali Masjid and beyond Khinjan.\nKing sahib is ordered to be awake and wary.\"\n\n\"And to lame no more horses jumping them over rocks!\"\n\n\"Nay, the karnal sahib said he is to ride after no more jackals with a\nspear!\"\n\n\"Same old game!\" said King to himself. \"What knowest thou of the lashkar\nthat is gathering?\"\n\n\"I? Oh, a little. An uncle of mine, and three half-brothers, and a\nbrother are of its number! One came at night to tempt me to join--but\nI have eaten the salt. It was I who first warned our karnal sahib. Now,\nlet me by!\"\n\n\"Nay, wait!\" ordered King. But he lowered his pistol point.\n\nTo hold up a despatch rider was about as irregular as any proceeding\ncould be; but it was within his province to find out how far the Khyber\njezailchis could be trusted and within his power more than to make up\nthe lost time. So that the irregularity did not trouble him much.\n\n\"Does this other letter tell of the lashkar, too?\"\n\n\"Am I God, that I should know? But of what else should the karnal sahib\nwrite?\"\n\n\"What is the object of the rising?\" King asked him next; and the man\nthrew his head back to laugh like a wolf. Laughter, at night in the\nKhyber, is an insult. Ismail chattered into his beard; but King sat\nstill.\n\n\"Object? What but to force the Khyber and burst through into India and\nloot? What but to plunder, now that English backs are turned the other\nway?\"\n\n\"Who said their backs are turned?\" demanded King.\n\n\"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ho! Hear him!\"\n\nThe Khyber echoed the mockery away and away into the distance.\n\n\"Their backs are this way and their faces that! The kites know it! The\nvultures know it! The little jackals know it! The little butchas in\nthe valley villages all know it! Ask the rocks, and the grass--the very\nwater running from the 'Hills'! They all know that the English fight for\nlife!\"\n\n\"And the Khyber jezailchis? What of them?\" King asked.\n\n\"They know it better than any!\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"They make ready, even as I.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For what Allah shall decide! We ate the salt, we jezailchis. We chose,\nand we ate of our own free will. We have been paid the price we named,\nin silver and rifles and clothing. The arrficers the sirkar sent us are\nmen of faith who have made no trouble with our women. What, then, should\nthe Khyber jezailchis do? For a little while there will be fighting--or,\nif we be very brave and our arrficers skillful, and Allah would fain see\nsport, then for a longer while. Then we shall be overridden. Then the\nKhyber will be a roaring river of men pouring into India, as my father's\nfather told me it has often been! India shall bleed in these days--but\nthere will be fighting in the Khyber first!\"\n\n\"And what of her? Of Yasmini?\" King asked.\n\n\"Thou wearest that--and askest what of her? Nay--tell!\"\n\n\"Should she order the jezailchis to be false to the salt--?\"\n\n\"Such a question!\"\n\nThe man clucked into his beard and began to fidget in the saddle.\nKing gave him another view of the bracelet, and again he found a civil\nanswer.\n\n\"We of the Rifles have her leave to be loyal to the salt, for, said she,\notherwise how could we be true men; and she loves no liars. From the\nfirst, when she first won our hearts in the 'Hills,' she gave us of the\nRifles leave to be true men first and her servants afterward! We may\nlove her--as we do!--and yet fight against her, if so Allah wills--and\nshe will yet love us!\"\n\n\"Where is she?\" King asked him suddenly, and the man began to laugh\nagain.\n\n\"Let me by!\" he shouted truculently. \"Who am I to sit a horse and gossip\nin the Khyber? Let me by, I say!\"\n\n\"I will let you by when you have told me where she is!\"\n\n\"Then I die here, and very likely thou, too!\" the man answered, bringing\nhis rifle to the port in front of him so quickly that he almost had King\nat a disadvantage. As it was, King was quick enough to balance matters\nby covering him with the pistol again. The horses sensed excitement and\nbegan to stir. With a laugh the jezailchi let the rifle fall across his\nlap, and at that King put the pistol out of sight.\n\n\"Fool!\" hissed Ismail in his ear; but King knows the \"Hills\" better in\nsome ways than the savages who live in them; they, for instance, never\nseem able to judge whether there will be a fight presently or not.\n\n\"Why won't you tell me where she is?\" he asked in his friendliest voice,\nand that would wheedle secrets from the Sphynx.\n\n\"Her secrets are her own, and may Allah help her guard them! I will tear\nmy tongue out first!\"\n\n\"Enviable woman!\" murmured King. \"Pass, friend!\" he ordered, reining\naside. \"Take my spare horse and leave me that weary one, so you will\nrecover the lost time and more into the bargain.\"\n\nThe man changed horses gladly, saying nothing. When he had shifted the\nsaddle and mounted, he began to ride off with a great air, not so much\nas deigning to scowl at Ismail. But he had not ridden a dozen paces when\nhe sat round in the saddle and drew rein.\n\n\"Sahib!\" he called. \"Sahib!\"\n\nKing waited. He had waited for this very thing and could afford to wait\na minute longer.\n\n\"Hast thou--is there--does the sahib--I have not tasted--\"\n\nHe made a sign with his hand that men recognize in pretty nearly every\nland under the sun.\n\n\"So-ho!\" laughed King, patting his hip pocket, from which the cap of a\nsilver-topped flask had been protruding ever since he put the pistol out\nof sight. \"So our copper's hot, eh?\"\n\n\"May Allah do more to me if my throat is not lined with the fires of\nEblis!\"\n\n\"But the Kalamullah!\" King objected. \"What saith the Prophet?\"\n\n\"The Prophet forbade the faithful to drink wine,\" said the jezailchi.\n\"He said nothing about whiskey, that I ever heard!\"\n\n\"Mine is brandy,\" said King.\n\n\"May Allah bless the sahib's sons and grandsons to the seventh\ngeneration! May Allah--\"\n\n\"Tell me about Yasmini first! Where is she?\"\n\n\"Nay!\"\n\nKing tapped the flask in his pocket.\n\n\"Nay! My throat is dry, but it shalt parch! I know not! As to where she\nis, I know not!\"\n\n\"Remember, and I will give you the whole of it!\"\n\nHe drew the flask out of his pocket and rode a little way toward the\nman.\n\n\"None can overhear. Tell me now.\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib! I am silent!\"\n\n\"Have you passed her on your way?\"\n\nThe man shook his head--shook it until the whites of his eyes were a\nstreak in the middle of his dark face; and when a Hillman is as vehement\nas that he is surely lying.\n\nKing set the flask to his own lips and drank a few drops.\n\n\"Salaam, sahib!\" said the jezaitchi, wheeling his horse to ride away.\n\nKing let him ride twenty paces before calling to him to halt.\n\n\"Come back!\" he ordered, and rode part of the way to meet him.\n\n\"I but tried thee, friend!\" he said, holding out the flask.\n\n\"Allah then preserve me from a second test!\"\n\nThe jezailchi seized the flask, clapped it to his lips and drained it to\nthe last drop while King sat still in the moonlight and smiled at him.\n\n\"God grant the giver peace!\" he prayed, handing the flask back. The\nkindly East possesses no word for \"Thank you.\" Then he wheeled the horse\nin a sudden eddy, as polo ponies turn on the Indian plains, and rode\naway down the wind as if the Pass were full of devils in pursuit of him.\n\nKing watched him out of sight and then listened until the hoof-beats\ndied away and the Pass grew still again.\n\n\"The jezailchis'll stand!\" he said, lighting a new cheroot. \"Good men\nand good luck to 'em!\"\n\nThen he rode back to his own men.\n\n\"Where starts the trail to Khinjan?\" he asked; not that he had forgotten\nit, but to learn who knew.\n\n\"This side of Ali Masjid!\" they answered all together.\n\n\"Two miles this side. More than a mile from here,\" said Ismail. \"What\nnext? Shall we camp here? Here is fuel and a little water. Give the\nword--\"\n\n\"Nay-forward!\" ordered King.\n\n\"Forward?\" growled Ismail. \"With this man it is ever 'forward!' Is there\nneither rest nor fear? Has she bewitched him? Hai! Ye lazy ones! Ho!\nSons of sloth! Urge the mules faster! Beat the led horse!\"\n\nSo in weird wan moonlight, King led them forward, straight up the\nnarrowing gorge, between cliffs that seemed to fray the very bosom of\nthe sky. He smoked a cigar and stared at the view, as if he were off\nto the mountains for a month's sport with dependable shikarris whom he\nknew. Nobody could have looked at him and guessed he was not enjoying\nhimself.\n\n\"That man,\" mumbled Ismail behind him, \"is not as other sahibs I have\nknown. He is a man, this one! He will do unexpected things!\"\n\n\"Forward!\" King called to them, thinking they were grumbling. \"Forward,\nmen of the 'Hills'!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\n\n\n     The owl he has eyes that are big for his size,\n     And the night like a book he deciphers;\n     \"Too-woop!\" he asserts, and \"Hoo-woo-ip!\" he cries,\n     And he means to remark he is awfully wise;\n     But he lags behind us, who are \"on\" to the lies\n     Of the hairy Himalayan knifers!\n\n     For eyes we be, of Empire, we,\n     Skinned and puckered and quick to see,\n     And nobody guesses how wise we be,\n     Nor hidden in what disguise we be,\n     A-cooking a sudden surprise we be\n     For hairy Himahlyan knifers!\n\n\nAfter a time King urged his horse to a jog-trot, and the five Hillmen\npattered in his wake, huddled so close together that the horse could\neasily have kicked more than one of them. The night was cold enough to\nmake flesh creep; but it was imagination that herded them until they\ntouched the horse's rump and kept the whites of their eyes ever showing\nas they glanced to left and right. The Khyber, fouled by memory, looks\nlike the very birthplace of the ghosts when the moon is fitful and a\nmist begins to flow.\n\n\"Cheloh!\" King called merrily enough; but his horse shied at nothing,\nbecause horses have an uncanny way of knowing how their riders really\nfeel. They led mules and the spare horse, instead of dragging at their\nbridles, pressed forward to have their heads among the men, and every\nonce and again there would sound the dull thump of a fist on a beast's\nnose--such being the attitude of men toward the lesser beasts.\n\nThey trotted forward until the bed of the Khyber began to grow very\nnarrow, and Ali Masjid Fort could not be much more than a mile away, at\nthe widest guess. Then King drew rein and dismounted, for he would have\nbeen challenged had he ridden much farther. A challenge in the Khyber\nafter dark consists invariably of a volley at short range, with the mere\nwords afterward, and the wise man takes precaution.\n\n\"Off with the mules' packs!\" he ordered, and the men stood round and\nstared. Darya Khan, leaning on the only rifle in the party, grinned like\na post-office letter box.\n\n\"Truly,\" growled Ismail, forgetting past expression of a different\nopinion, \"this man is as mad as all the other Englishmen.\"\n\n\"Were you ever bitten by one?\" wondered King aloud.\n\n\"God forbid!\"\n\n\"Then, off with the packs--and hurry!\"\n\nIsmail began to obey.\n\n\"Thou! Lord of the Rivers! (For that is what Darya Khan means.) What is\nthy calling?\"\n\n\"Badragga\" (guide), he answered. \"Did she not send me back down the Pass\nto be a guide?\"\n\n\"And before that what wast thou?\"\n\n\"Is that thy business?\" he snarled, shifting his rifle-barrel to the\nother hand. \"I am what she says I am! She used to call me 'Chikki'--the\nLifter!--and I was! There are those who were made to know it! If she\nsays now I am badragga, shall any say she lies?\"\n\n\"I say thou art unpacker of mules' burdens!\" answered King. \"Begin!\"\n\nFor answer the fellow grinned from ear to ear and thrust the\nrifle-barrel forward insolently. King, with the movement of\ndetermination that a man makes when about to force conclusions, drew up\nhis sleeves above the wrist. At that instant the moon shone through the\nmist and the gold bracelet glittered in the moonlight.\n\n\"May God be with thee!\" said \"Lord of the Rivers\" at once. And without\nanother word he laid down his rifle and went to help off-load the mules.\n\nKing stepped aside and cursed softly. To a man who knows how to enforce\nhis own authority, it is worse than galling to be obeyed because he\nwears a woman's favor. But for a vein of wisdom that underlay his pride\nhe would have pocketed the bracelet there and then and have refused to\nwear it again. But as he sweated his pride he overheard Ismail growl:\n\n\"Good for thee! He had taught thee obedience in another bat of the eye!\"\n\n\"I obey her!\" muttered Darya Khan.\n\n\"I, too,\" said Ishmail. \"So shall he before the week dies! But now it is\ngood to obey him. He is an ugly man to disobey!\"\n\n\"I obey him until she sets me free, then,\" grumbled Darya Khan.\n\n\"Better for thee!\" said Ismail.\n\nThe packs were laid on the ground, and the mules shook themselves, while\nthe jackals that haunt the Khyber came closer, to sit in a ring and\nwatch. King dug a flashlight out of one of the packs, gave it to Ismail\nto hold, sat on the other pack and began to write on a memorandum pad.\nIt was a minute before he could persuade Ismail that the flashlight was\nharmless, and another minute before he could get him to hold it still.\nThen, however, he wrote swiftly.\n\n        \"In the Khyber, a mile below you.\n\n        \"Dear Old Man--I would like to run in and see you, but\n        circumstances don't permit.  Several people sent you\n        their regards by me.  Herewith go two mules and their\n        packs.  Make any use of the mules you like, but store\n        the loads where I can draw on them in case of need.\n        I would like to have a talk with you before taking the\n        rather desperate step I intend, but I don't want to be\n        seen entering or leaving Ali Masjid.  Can you come\n        down the Pass without making your intention known?\n        It is growing misty now.  It ought to be easy.  My men\n        will tell you where I am and show you the way.  Why\n        not destroy this letter?\n\n        \"Athelstan.\"\n\nHe folded the note and stuck a postage stamp on it in lieu of seal. Then\nhe examined the packs with the aid of the flashlight, sorted them and\nordered two of the mules reloaded.\n\n\"You three!\" he ordered then. \"Take the loaded mules into Ali Masjid\nFort. Take this chit, you. Give it to the sahib in command there.\"\n\nThey stood and gaped at him, wide-eyed--then I came closer to see his\neyes and to catch any whisper that Ismail might have for them. But\nIsmail and Darya Khan seemed full of having been chosen to stay behind;\nthey offered no suggestions--certainly no encouragement to mutiny.\n\n\"To hear is to obey!\" said the nearest man, seizing the note, for at all\nevents that was the easiest task. His action decided the other two. They\ntook the mules' leading-reins and followed him. Before they had gone\nten paces they were all swallowed in the mist that had begun to flow\nsoutheastward; it closed on them like a blanket, and in a minute more\nthe clink of shod hooves had ceased. The night grew still, except for\nthe whimpering of jackals. Ismail came nearer and squatted at King's\nfeet.\n\n\"Why, sahib?\" he asked: and Darya Khan came closer, too. King had tied\nthe reins of the two horses and the one remaining mule together in a\nknot and was sitting on the pack.\n\n\"Why not?\" he countered.\n\nSolemn, almost motionless, squatted on their hunkers, they looked like\ntwo great vultures watching an animal die.\n\n\"What have they done that they should be sent away?\" asked Ismail. \"What\nhave they done that they should be sent to the fort, where the arrficer\nwill put them in irons?\"\n\n\"Why should he put them in irons?\" asked King.\n\n\"Why not? Here in the Khyber there is often a price on men's heads!\"\n\n\"And not in Delhi?\"\n\n\"In Delhi these were not known. There were no witnesses in Delhi. In the\nfort at Ali Masjid there will be a dozen ready to swear to them!\"\n\n\"Then, why did they obey?\" asked King.\n\n\"What is that on the sahib's wrist?\"\n\n\"You mean--?\"\n\n\"Sahib--if she said, 'Walk into the fire or over that Cliff!' there be\nmany in these 'Hills' who would obey without murmuring!\"\n\n\"I have nothing against them,\" said King. \"As long as they are my men I\nwill not send them into a trap.\"\n\n\"Good!\" nodded Ismail and Darya Khan together, but they did not seem\nreally satisfied.\n\n\"It is good,\" said Ismail, \"that she should have nothing against thee,\nsahib! Those three men are in thy keeping!\"\n\n\"And I in thine?\" King asked, but neither man answered him.\n\nThey sat in silence for five minutes. Then suddenly the two Hillmen\nshuddered, although King did not bat an eyelid. Din burst into being. A\nvolley ripped out of the night and thundered down the Pass.\n\n\"How-utt! Hukkums dar?\" came the insolent challenge half a minute after\nit--the proof positive that Ali Masjid's guards neither slept nor were\nafraid.\n\nA weird wail answered the challenge, and there began a tossing to and\nfro of words, that was prelude to a shouted invitation:\n\n\"Ud-vance-frrrennen-orsss-werrul!\"\n\nEnglish can be as weirdly distorted as wire, or any other supple medium,\nand native levies advance distortion to the point of art; but the\nlanguage sounds no less good in the chilly gloom of a Khyber night.\n\nFollowed another wait, this time of half an hour. Then a man's\nfootsteps--a booted, leather-heeled man, striding carelessly. Not far\nbehind him was the softer noise of sandals. The man began to whistle\nAnnie Laurie.\n\n\"Charles? That you?\" called King.\n\n\"That you, old man?\"\n\nA man in khaki stepped into the moonlight. He was so nearly the image of\nAthelstan King that Ismail and Darya Khan stood up and stared. Athelstan\nstrode to meet him. Their walk was the same. Angle for angle, line\nfor line, they might have been one man and his shadow, except for\nthree-quarters of an inch of stature.\n\n\"Glad to see you, old man,\" said Athelstan.\n\n\"Sure, old chap!\" said Charles; and they shook hands.\n\n\"What's the desperate proposal?\" asked the younger.\n\n\"I'll tell you when we are alone.\"\n\nHis brother nodded and stood a step aside. The three who had taken the\nnote to the fort came closer--partly to call attention to themselves,\npartly to claim credit, partly because the outer silence frightened\nthem. They elbowed Ismail and Darya Khan, and one of them received a\nsavage blow in the stomach by way of retort from Ismail. Before that\nspark could start an explosion Athelstan interfered.\n\n\"Ismail! Take two men. Go down the Pass out of car-shot, and keep watch!\nCome back when I whistle thus--but no sooner!\"\n\nHe put fingers between his teeth and blew until the night shrilled back\nat him. Ismail seized the leather bag and started to obey.\n\n\"Leave that bag. Leave it, I say!\"\n\n\"But some man may steal it, sahib. How shall a thief know there is no\nmoney in it?\"\n\n\"Leave it and go!\"\n\nIsmail departed, grumbling, and King turned on Darya Khan.\n\n\"Take the remaining man, and go up the Pass!\" he ordered. \"Stand out of\near-shot and keep watch. Come when I whistle!\"\n\n\"But this one has a belly ache where Ismail smote him! Can a man with\na belly ache stand guard? His moaning will betray both him and me!\"\nobjected \"Lord of the Rivers.\"\n\n\"Take him and go!\" commanded King.\n\n\"But--\"\n\nKing was careful now not to show his bracelet.\n\nBut there was something in his eye and in his attitude--a subtle\nsuggestive something-or-other about him--that was rather more convincing\nthan a pistol or a stick. Darya Khan thrust his rifle-end into the hurt\nman's stomach for encouragement and started off into the mist.\n\n\"Come and ache out of the sahibs' sight!\" he snarled.\n\nIn a minute King and his brother stood unseen, unheard in the shadow by\na patch of silver moonlight. Athelstan sat down on the mule's pack.\n\n\"Well?\" said the younger. \"Tell me. I shall have to hurry. You see I'm\nin charge back there. They saw me come out, but I hope to teach 'em a\nlesson going back.\"\n\nAthelstan nodded. \"Good!\" he said. \"I've a roving commission. I'm\nordered to enter Khinjan Caves.\"\n\nHis brother whistled. \"Tall order! What's your plan?\"\n\n\"Haven't one--yet. Know more when I'm nearer Khinjan. You can help no\nend.\"\n\n\"How? Name it!\"\n\n\"I shall go up in disguise. Nobody can put the stain on as well as you.\nBut tell me something first. Any news of a holy war yet?\"\n\nHis brother nodded. \"Plenty of talk about one to come,\" he said. \"We\nkeep hearing of that lashkar that we can't locate, under a mullah whose\nname seems to change with the day of the week. And there are everlasting\ntales about the 'Heart of the Hills.\"'\n\n\"No explanation of 'em?\" Athelstan asked him.\n\n\"None! Not a thing!\"\n\n\"D'you know of Yasmini?\"\n\n\"Heard of her of course,\" said his brother.\n\n\"Has she come up the Pass?\"\n\nHis brother laughed. \"No, neither she nor a coach and four.\"\n\n\"I have heard the contrary,\" said Athelstan.\n\n\"Heard what, exactly?\"\n\n\"She's up the Pass ahead of me.\"\n\n\"She hasn't passed Ali Masjid!\" said his brother, and Athelstan nodded.\n\n\"Are the Turks in the show yet?\" asked Charles.\n\n\"Not yet. But I know they're expected in.\"\n\n\"You bet they're expected in!\" The younger man grinned from ear to ear.\n\"They're working both tides under to prepare the tribes for it. They\nflatter themselves they can set alight a holy war that will put Timour\nIlang to shame. You should hear my jezailchies talk at night when they\nthink I'm not listening!\"\n\n\"The jezailchies'll stand though,\" said Athelstan.\n\n\"Stake my life on it!\" said his brother. \"They'll stick to the last\nman!\"\n\n\"I can't tell you,\" said Athelstan, \"why we're not attacking brother\nTurk before he's ready. I imagine Whitehall has its hands full. But it's\nlikely enough that the Turk will throw in his lot with the Prussians the\nminute he's ready to begin. Meanwhile my job is to help make the holy\nwar seem unprofitable to the tribes, so that they'll let the Turk down\nhard when he calls on 'em. Every day that I can point to forts held\nstrongly in the Khyber is a day in my favor. There are sure to be raids.\nIn fact, the more the merrier, provided they're spasmodic. We must keep\n'em separated--keep 'em from swarming too fast--while I sow other seeds\namong 'em.\"\n\nHis brother nodded. Sowing seeds was almost that family's hereditary\njob. Athelstan continued:\n\n\"Hang on to Ali Masjid like a leech, old man! The day one raiding\nlashkar gets command of the Khyber's throat, the others'll all believe\nthey've won the game. Nothing'll stop 'em then! Look out for traps.\nSmash 'em on sight. But don't follow up too far!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Charles.\n\n\"Help me with the stain now, will you?\"\n\nWith his flash-light burning as if its battery provided current by the\nweek instead of by the minute, Athelstan dragged open the mule's pack\nand produced a host of things. He propped a mirror against the pack and\nsquatted in front of it. Then he passed a little bottle to his brother,\nand Charles attended to the chin-strap mark that would have betrayed him\na British officer in any light brighter than dusk. In a few minutes his\nwhole face was darkened to one hue, and Charles stepped back to look at\nit.\n\n\"Won't need to wash yourself for a month!\" he said. \"The dirt won't\nshow!\" He sniffed at the bottle. \"But that stain won't come off if you\ndo wash--never worry! You'll do finely.\"\n\n\"Not yet, I won't!\" said Athelstan, picking up a little safety razor and\nbeginning on his mustache. In a minute he had his upper lip bare. Then\nhis brother bent over him and rubbed in stain where the scrubby mustache\nhad been.\n\nAfter that Athelstan unlocked the leather bag that had caused Ismail so\nmuch concern and shook out from it a pile of odds and ends at which\nhis brother nodded with perfect understanding. The principal item was\na piece of silk--forty or fifty yards of it--that he proceeded to\nbind into a turban on his head, his brother lending him a guiding,\nunderstanding finger at every other turn. When that was done, the man\nwho had said he looked in the least like a British officer would have\nlied.\n\nOne after another he drew on native garments, picking them from the pile\nbeside him. So, by rapid stages he developed into a native hakim--by\ncreed a converted Hindu, like Rewa Gunga,--one of the men who practise\nyunani, or modern medicine, without a license and with a very great deal\nof added superstition, trickery and guesswork.\n\n\"I wouldn't trust you with a ha'penny!\" announced his brother when he\nhad done.\n\n\"Really? As good as all that?\"\n\n\"The part to a T.\"\n\n\"Well--take these into the fort for me, will you?\" His brother caught\nthe bundle of discarded European clothes and tucked them under his arm.\n\"Now, re-member, old man! This is the biggest show there has ever been!\nWe've got to hold the Khyber, and we can't do it by riding pell-mell\ninto the first trap set for us! We must smash when the fighting\nstarts--but we mayn't miss! We mayn't run past the mark! Be a coward,\nif that's the name you care to give it. You needn't tell me you've got\norders to hunt skirmishers to a standstill, because I know better. I\nknow you've just had your wig pulled for laming two horses!\"\n\n\"How d'you know that?\"\n\n\"Never mind! I've been seconded to your crowd. I'm your senior, and I'm\ngiving you orders. This show isn't sport, but the real red thing, and\nI want to count on you to fight like a trained man, not like a\nnatural-born fool. I want to know you're holding Ali Masjid like Fabius\nheld Rome, by being slow and wily, just for the sake of the comfortable\nfeeling it will give me when I'm alone among the 'Hills.' Hit hard when\nyou have to, but for God's sake, old man, ware traps!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said his brother.\n\n\"Then good-by, old man!\"\n\n\"Good-by, Athelstan!\"\n\nThey stood facing and shook hands. Where had been a man and his\nreflection in the mist, there now seemed to be the same man and a\nnative. Athelstan King had changed his very nature with his clothes.\nHe stood like a native--moved like one; even his voice was changed, as\nif--like the actor who dyed himself all over to act Othello--he could do\nnothing by halves.\n\n\"I'm going to try to get in without my men seeing me!\" said the younger.\n\n\"If they do see you, they'll shoot!\"\n\n\"Yes, and miss! Trust a Khyber jezailchi not to hit much in the dark!\nIt'll do 'em good either way. I'll have time to give 'em the password\nbefore they fire a second volley. They're not really dangerous till the\nthird one. Good-by!\"\n\n\"By, Charles!\"\n\nOfficers in that force are not chosen for their clumsiness, or inability\nto move silently by night. His foot-steps died in the mist almost as\nquickly as his shadow. Before he had been gone a minute the Pass was\nsilent as death again, and though Athelstan listened with trained ears,\nthe only sound he could detect was of a jackal cracking a bone fifty or\nsixty yards away.\n\nHe repacked the loads, putting everything back carefully into the big\nleather envelopes and locking the empty hand-bag, after throwing in a\nfew stones for Ismail's benefit. Then he went to sit in the moonlight,\nwith his back to a great rock and waited there cross-legged to give his\nbrother time to make good a retreat through the mist. When there was\nno more doubt that his own men, at all events, had failed to detect the\nlieutenant, he put two fingers in his mouth and whistled.\n\nAlmost at once he heard sandals come pattering from both directions. As\nthey emerged out of the mist he sat silent and still. It was Darya Khan\nwho came first and stood gaping at him, but Ismail was a very close\nsecond, and the other three were only a little behind. For full two\nminutes after the man with the sore stomach had come they all stood\nholding one another's arms, astonished. Then--\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Ismail.\n\n\"Who?\" said King, the hakim.\n\n\"Our sahib--King sahib--where is he?\"\n\n\"Gone!\"\n\nEven his voice was so completely changed that men who had been reared\namid mutual suspicion could not recognize it.\n\n\"But there are his loads! There is his mule!\"\n\n\"Here is his bag!\" said Ismail, pouncing on it, picking it up and\nshaking it. \"It rattles not as formerly! There is more in it than there\nwas!\"\n\n\"His two horses and the mule are here,\" said Darya Khan.\n\n\"Did I say he took them with him?\" asked the hakim, who sat still with\nhis back to a rock. \"He went because I came! He left me here in charge!\nShould he not leave the wherewithal to make me comfortable, since I must\ndo his work? Hah! What do I see? A man bent nearly double? That means a\nbelly ache! Who should have a belly ache when I have potions, lotions,\nbalms to heal all ills, magic charms and talismans, big and little\npills--and at such a little price! So small a price! Show me the belly\nand pay your money! Forget not the money, for nothing is free except\nair, water and the Word of God! I have paid money for water before now,\nand where is the mullah who will not take a fee? Nay, only air costs\nnothing! For a rupee, then--for one rupee I will heal the sore belly and\nforget to be ashamed for taking such a little fee!\"\n\n\"Whither went the sahib? Nay--show us proof!\" objected Darya Khan; and\nIsmail stood back a pace to scratch his flowing beard and think.\n\n\"The sahib left this with me!\" said King, and held up his wrist. The\ngold bracelet Rewa Gunga had given him gleamed in the pale moonlight.\n\n\"May God be with thee!\" boomed all five men together.\n\nKing jumped to his feet so suddenly that all five gave way in front of\nhim, and Darya Khan brought his rifle to the port.\n\n\"Hast thou never seen me before?\" he demanded, seizing Ismail by the\nshoulders and staring straight into his eyes.\n\n\"Nay, I never saw thee!\"\n\n\"Look again!\"\n\nHe turned his head, to show his face in profile.\n\n\"Nay, I never saw thee!\"\n\n\"Thou, then! Thou with the belly! Thou! Thou!\"\n\nThey all denied ever having seen him.\n\nSo he stepped back until the moon shone full in his face and pulled off\nhis turban, changing his expression at the same time.\n\n\"Now look!\"\n\n\"Ma'uzbillah! (May God protect us!)\"\n\n\"Now ye know me?\"\n\n\"Hee-yee-yee!\" yelled Ismail, hugging himself by the elbows and\nbeginning to dance from side to side. \"Hee-yee-yee! What said I? Said\nI not so? Said I not this is a different man? Said I not this is a\ngood one--a man of unexpected things? Said I not there was magic in the\nleather bag? I shook it often, and the magic grew! Hee-yee-yee! Look at\nhim! See such cunning! Feel him! Smell of him! He is a good one--good!\"\n\nThree of the others stood and grinned, now that their first shock of\nsurprise had died away. The fourth man poked among the packs. There was\nlittle to see except gleaming teeth and the whites of eyes, set in hairy\nfaces in the mist. But Ismail danced all by himself among the stones of\nKhyber road and he looked like a bearded ghoul out for an airing.\n\n\"Hee-yee-yee! She smelt out a good one! Hee-yee-yee! This is a man after\nmy heart! Hee-yee-yee! God preserve me! God preserve me to see the end\nof this! This one will show sport! Oh-yee-yee-yee!\"\n\nSuddenly be closed with King and hugged him until the stout ribs cracked\nand bent inward and King sobbed for breath among the strands of the\nAfridi's beard. He had to use knuckles and knees and feet to win\nfreedom, and though he used them with all his might and hurt the old\nsavage fiercely, he made no impression on his good will.\n\n\"After my own heart, thou art! Spirit of a cunning one! Worker of\nspells! Allah! That was a good day when she bade me wait for thee!\"\n\nKing sat down again, panting. He wanted time to get his breath back and\na little of the ache out of his ribs, but he did not care to waste any\nmore minutes, and his eyes watched the faces of the other four men. He\nsaw them slowly waken to understanding of what Ismail meant by \"worker\nof spells\" and \"magic in the bag\" and knew that he had even greater hold\non them now than Yasmini's bracelet gave him.\n\n\"Ma'uzbillah!\" they murmured as Ismail's meaning dawned and they\nrecognized a magician in their midst. \"May God protect us!\"\n\n\"May God protect me! I have need of it!\" said King. \"What shall my new\nname be? Give ye me a name!\"\n\n\"Nay, choose thou!\" urged Ismail, drawing nearer. \"We have seen one\nmiracle; now let us hear another!\"\n\n\"Very well. Khan is a title of respect. Since I wish for respect, I\nwill call myself Khan. Name me a village the first name you can think\nof--quick!\"\n\n\"Kurram,\" said Ismail, at a hazard.\n\n\"Kurram is good. Kurram I am! Kurram Khan is my name henceforward!\nKurram Khan the dakitar!\"\n\n\"But where is the sahib who came from the fort to talk?\" asked the man\nwhose stomach ached yet from Ismail and Darya Khan's attentions to it.\n\n\"Gone!\" announced King. \"He went with the other one!\"\n\n\"Went whither? Did any see him go?\"\n\n\"Is that thy affair?\" asked King, and the man collapsed. It is not\nconsidered wise to the north of Jamrud to argue with a wizard, or even\nwith a man who only claims to be one. This was a man who had changed his\nvery nature almost under their eyes.\n\n\"Even his other clothes have gone!\" murmured one man, he who had poked\nabout among the packs.\n\n\"And now, Ismail, Darya Khan, ye two dunder-heads!--ye bellies without\nbrains!--when was there ever a dakitar--a hakim, who had not two\nassistants at the least? Have ye never seen, ye blinder-than-bats--how\none man holds a patient while his boils are lanced, and yet another\nmakes the hot iron ready?\"\n\n\"Aye! Aye!\"\n\nThey had both seen that often.\n\n\"Then, what are ye?\"\n\nThey gaped at him. Were they to work wonders too? Were they to be part\nand parcel of the miracle? Watching them, King saw understanding dawn\nbehind Ismail's eyes and knew he was winning more than a mere admirer.\nHe knew it might be days yet, might be weeks before the truth was out,\nbut it seemed to him that Ismail was at heart his friend. And there are\nno friendships stronger than those formed in the Khyber and beyond--no\nmore loyal partnerships. The \"Hills\" are the home of contrasts,\nof blood-feuds that last until the last-but-one man dies, and of\nfriendships that no crime or need or slander can efface. If the feuds\nare to be avoided like the devil, the friendships are worth having.\n\n\"There is another thing ye might do,\" he suggested, \"if ye two grown men\nare afraid to see a boil slit open. Always there are timid patients who\nhang back and refuse to drink the medicines. There should be one or two\namong the crowd who will come forward and swallow the draughts eagerly,\nin proof that no harm results. Be ye two they!\"\n\nIsmail spat savagely.\n\n\"Nay! Bismillah! Nay, nay! I will hold them who have boils, sitting\nfirmly on their bellies--so--or between their shoulders--thus--when\nthe boils are behind! Nay, I will drink no draughts! I am a man, not a\ncess-pool!\"\n\n\"And I will study how to heat hot irons!\" said Darya Khan, with grim\nconviction. \"It is likely that, having worked for a blacksmith once, I\nmay learn quickly! Phaughghgh! I have tasted physic! I have drunk Apsin\nSaats! (Epsom Salts.)\"\n\nHe spat, too, in a very fury of reminiscence.\n\n\"Good!\" said King. \"Henceforward, then, I am Kurram Khan, the dakitar,\nand ye two are my assistants, Ismail to hold the men with boils, and\nDarya Khan to heat the irons--both of ye to be my men and support me\nwith words when need be!\"\n\n\"Aye!\" said Ismail, quick to think of details, \"and these others shall\nbe the tasters! They have big bellies, that will hold many potions\nwithout crowding. Let them swallow a little of each medicine in the\nchest now, for the sake of practise! Let them learn not to make a wry\nface when the taste of cess-pools rests on the tongue--\"\n\n\"Aye, and the breath comes sobbing through the nose!\" said Darya Khan,\nremembering fragments of an adventurous career. \"Let them learn to drink\nApsin Saats without coughing!\"\n\n\"We will not drink the medicines!\" announced the man who had a stomach\nache. \"Nay, nay!\"\n\nBut Ismail hit him with the back of his hand in the stomach again and\ndanced away, hugging himself and shouting \"Hee-yee-yee!\" until the\njackals joined him in discontented chorus and the Khyber Pass became\nfull of weird howling. Then suddenly the old Afridi thought of something\nelse and came back to thrust his face close to King's.\n\n\"Why be a Rangar? Why be a Rajput, sahib? She loves us Hillmen better!\"\n\n\"Do I look like a Hillman of the 'Hills'?\" asked King.\n\n\"Nay, not now. But he who can work one miracle can work another. Change\nthy skin once more and be a true Hillman!\"\n\n\"Aye!\" King laughed. \"And fall heir to a blood-feud with every second\nman I chance upon! A Hill-man is cousin to a hundred others, and what\nsay they in the 'Hills'?--'to hate like cousins,' eh? All cousins are\nat war. As a Rangar I have left my cousins down in India. Better be\na converted Hindu and be despised by some than have cousins in the\n'Hills'! Besides--do I speak like a Hillman?\"\n\n\"Aye! Never an Afridi spake his own tongue better!\"\n\n\"Yet--does a Hillman slip? Would a Hillman use Punjabi words in a\ncareless moment?\"'\n\n\"God forbid!\"\n\n\"Therefore, thou dunderhead, I will be a Rangar Rajput,--a stranger in\na strange land, traveling by her favor to visit her in Khinjan!\nThus, should I happen to make mistakes in speech or action, it may be\noverlooked, and each man will unwittingly be my advocate, explaining\naway my errors to himself and others instead of my enemy denouncing me\nto all and sundry! Is that clear, thou oaf?\"\n\n\"Aye! Thou art more cunning than any man I ever met!\"\n\nThe great Afridi began to rub the tips of his fingers through his\nstraggly beard in a way that might mean anything, and King seemed to\ndraw considerable satisfaction from it, as if it were a sign language\nthat he understood. More than any one thing in the world just then\nhe needed a friend, and he certainly did not propose to refuse such a\nuseful one.\n\n\"And,\" he added, as if it were an afterthought, instead of his chief\nreason, \"if her special man Rewa Gunga is a Rangar, and is known as a\nRangar through out the 'Hills,' shall I not the more likely win favor\nby being a Rangar too? If I wear her bracelet and at the same time am a\nRangar, who will not trust me?\"\n\n\"True! Thou art a magician!\"\n\n\"True!\" agreed Ismail.\n\nBut the moon was getting low and Khyber would be dark again in half an\nhour, for the great crags in the distance to either hand shut off more\nlight than do the Khyber walls. The mist, too, was growing thicker. It\nwas time to make a move.\n\nKing rose. \"Pack the mule and bring my horse!\" he ordered and they\nhurried to obey with alacrity born of new respect, Darya Khan attending\nto the trimming of the mule's load in person instead of snarling at\nanother man. It was a very different little escort from the one that\nhad come thus far. Like King himself, it had changed its very nature in\nfifteen minutes!\n\nThey brought the horse, and King laughed at them, calling the\nidiots--men without eyes.\n\n\"The saddle?\" Ismail suggested. \"It is a government arrficer's saddle.\"\n\n\"Stolen!\" said King, and they nodded. \"Stolen along with the horse!\"\n\n\"Then the bridle?\"\n\n\"Stolen too, ye men without eyes! Ye insects! A Stolen horse and saddle\nand bridle, are they not a passport of gentility this side of the\nborder?\"\n\n\"Aye!\"\n\n\"I am Kurram Khan, the dakitar, but who in the 'Hills' would believe it?\nLook now--look ye and tell me what is wrong?\"\n\nHe pointed to the horse, and they stood in a row and stared.\n\n\"Shorten those stirrups, then, six holes at the least! Men will laugh at\nme if I ride like a British arrficer!\"\n\n\"Aye!\" said Ismail, hurrying to obey.\n\n\"Aye! Aye! Aye!\" agreed the others.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, gathering the reins and swinging into the saddle, \"who\nknows the way to Khinjan?\"\n\n\"Which of us does not!\"\n\n\"Ye all know it? Then ye all are border thieves and worse! No honest man\nknows that road! Lead on, Darya Khan, thou Lord of Rivers! Do thy duty\nas badragga and beware lest we get our knees wet at the fords! Ismail,\nyou march next. Now I. You other two and the mule follow me. Let the man\nwith the belly ache ride last on the other horse. So! Forward march!\"\n\nSo Darya Khan led the way with his rifle, and King's face glowed in\ncigarette light not very far behind him as he legged his horse up the\nnarrow track that led northward out of the Khyber bed.\n\nIt would be a long time before he would dare smoke a cigar again, and\nhis supply of cigarettes was destined to dwindle down to nothing before\nthat day. But he did not seem to mind.\n\n\"Cheloh!\" he called. \"Forward, men of the mountains! Kuch dar nahin\nhai!\"\n\n\"Thy mother and the spirit of a fight were one!\" swore Ismail just in\nfront of him, stepping out like a boy going to a picnic. \"She will love\nthee! Allah! She will love thee! Allah! Allah!\"\n\nThe thought seemed to appal him. For hours after that he climbed ahead\nin silence.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\n\n\n     Dear is the swagger that takes a man in\n             Helmeted, clattering, proud.\n     Sweet are the honors the arrogant win,\n             Hot from the breath of a crowd.\n     Precious the spirit that never will bend--\n             Hot challenge for insolent stare!\n     But--talk when you've tried it!--to win in the end,\n     Go ahsti!*  Be meek!  And beware!\n\n     [* Slowly.]\n\n\nEven with the man with the stomach Ache mounted on the spare horse for\nthe sake of extra speed (and he was not suffering one-fifth so much as\nhe pretended); with Ismail to urge, and King to coax, and the fear of\nmountain death on every side of them, they were the part of a night and\na day and a night and a part of another day in reaching Khinjan.\n\nDarya Khan, with the rifle held in both hands, led the way swiftly,\nbut warily; and the last man's eyes looked ever backward, for many a\nsneaking enemy might have seen them and have judged a stern chase worth\nwhile.\n\nIn the \"Hills\" the hunter has all the best of it, and the hunted needs\nmust run. The accepted rule is to stalk one's enemy relentlessly and get\nhim first. King happened to be bunting, although not for human life, and\nhe felt bold, but the men with him dreaded each upstanding crag, that\nmight conceal a rifleman. Armed men behind corners mean only one thing\nin the \"Hills.\"\n\nThe animals grew weary to the verge of dropping, for the \"road\" had been\nmade for the most part by mountain freshets, and where that was not the\ncase it was imaginary altogether. They traveled upward, along ledges\nthat were age-worn in the limestone--downward where the \"hell-stones\"\nslid from under them to almost bottomless ravines, and a false step\nwould have been instant death--up again between big edged boulders, that\nnipped the mule's pack and let the mule between--past many and many a\nlonely cairn that hid the bones of a murdered man (buried to keep his\nghost from making trouble)--ever with a tortured ridge of rock for\nsky-line and generally leaning against a wind, that chilled them to the\nbone, while the fierce sun burned them.\n\nAt night and at noon they slept fitfully at the chance-met shrine of\nsome holy man. The \"Hills\" are full of them, marked by fluttering rags\nthat can be seen for miles away; and though the Quran's meaning must be\nstretched to find excuse, the Hillmen are adept at stretching things and\nhold those shrines as sacred as the Book itself. Men who would almost\nrather cut throats than gamble regard them as sanctuaries.\n\nWhen a man says he is holy he can find few in the \"Hills\" to believe\nhim; but when he dies or is tortured to death or shot, even the men who\nmurdered him will come and revere his grave.\n\nWhole villages leave their preciousest possessions at a shrine before\nwandering in search of summer pasture. They find them safe on their\nreturn, although the \"Hills\" are the home of the lightest-fingered\nthieves on earth, who are prouder of villainy than of virtue. A man\nwith a blood-feud, and his foe hard after him, may sleep in safety at\na faquir's grave. His foe will wait within range, but he will not draw\ntrigger until the grave is left behind.\n\nSo a man may rest in temporary peace even on the road to Khinjan,\nalthough Khinjan and peace have nothing whatever in common.\n\nIt was at such a shrine, surrounded by tattered rags tied to sticks,\nthat fluttered in the wind three or four thousand feet above Khyber\nlevel, that King drew Ismail into conversation, and deftly forced on him\nthe role of questioner.\n\n\"How can'st thou see the Caves!\" he asked, for King had hinted at his\nintention; and for answer King gave him a glimpse of the gold bracelet.\n\n\"Aye! Well and good! But even she dare not disobey the rule. Khinjan was\nthere before she came, and the rule was there from the beginning, when\nthe first men found the Caves! Some--hundreds--have gained admission,\nlacking the right. But who ever saw them again? Allah! I, for one, would\nnot chance it!\"\n\n\"Thou and I are two men!\" answered King. \"Allah gave thee qualities I\nlack. He gave thee the strength of a bull and a mountain goat in one,\nand her for a mistress. To me he gave other qualities. I shall see the\nCaves. I am not afraid.\"\n\n\"Aye! He gave thee other gifts indeed! But listen! How many Indian\nservants of the British Raj have set out to see the Caves? Many,\nmany--aye, very many! Again and again the sirkar sent its loyal ones.\nDid any return? Not one! Some were crucified before they reached the\nplace. One died slowly on the very rock whereon we sit, with his eyelids\nmissing and his eyes turned to the sun! Some entered Khinjan, and the\nwomen of the place made sport with them. Those would rather have been\ncrucified outside had they but known. Some, having got by Khinjan,\nentered the Caves. None ever came out again!\"\n\n\"Then, what is my case to thee?\" King asked him \"If I can not come out\nagain and there is a secret then the secret will be kept, and what is\nthe trouble?\"\n\n\"I love thee,\" the Afridi answered simply. \"Thou art a man after mine\nown heart. Turn! Go back before it is too late!\"\n\nKing shook his head.\n\n\"Be warned!\"\n\nIsmail reached out a hairy-backed hand that shook with half-suppressed\nemotion.\n\n\"When we reach Khinjan, and I come within reach of her orders again,\nthen I am her man, not thine!\"\n\nKing smiled, glancing again at the gold bracelet on his arm.\n\n\"I look like her man, too!\"\n\n\"Thou!\" Ismail's scorn was well feigned if it was not real. \"Thou\nchicken running to the hand that will pluck thy breast-feathers!\nListen! Abdurrahman--he of Khabul--and may Allah give his ugly bones no\npeace!--Abdurrahman of Khabul sought the secret of the Caves. He sent\nhis men to set an ambush. They caught twenty coming out of Khinjan on\na raid. The twenty were carried to Khabul and put to torture there.\nHow many, think you, told the secret under torture? They died cursing\nAbdurrahman to his face and he died without the secret! May God\nrecompense him with the fire that burns forever and scalding water and\nashes to eat! May rats eat his bones!\"\n\n\"Had Abdurrahman this?\" asked King, touching the bracelet.\n\n\"Nay! He would have given one eye for it, but none would trade with him!\nHe knew of it, but never saw it.\"\n\n\"I am more favored. I have it. It is hers, is it not?\"\n\n\"Does not she know the secret?\"\n\n\"She knows all that any man knows and more!\"\n\n\"Was she seen to slay a man in the teeth of written law?\" asked King,\nand Ismail stared so hard at him that he laughed.\n\n\"I was in Khinjan once before, my friend! I know the rule! I failed to\nreach the Caves that other time because I had no witnesses to swear they\nhad seen me slay a man in the teeth of written law. I know!\"\n\n\"Who saw thee this time?\" Ismail asked, and began to cackle with the\ncruel humor of the \"Hills,\" that sees amusement in a man's undoing, or\nin the destruction of his plans. His humor forced him to explain.\n\n\"The price of an entrance has come of late to be the life of an English\narrficer! Many an one the English have dubbed Ghazi, because he crossed\nthe border and buried his knife in a man on church parade! They hang\nand burn them, knowing our Muslim law, that denies Heaven to him who is\nhanged and burned. Yet the man they miscall ghazi sought but the key to\nKhinjan Caves, with no thought at all about Heaven! Thou art a British\narrficer. It may be they will let thee enter the Caves at her bidding.\nIt may be, too, that they will keep thee in a cage there for some\nchief's son to try his knife on when the time comes to win admission!\nListen--man o' my heart!--so strict is the rule that boys born in the\nCaves, when they come to manhood, must go and slay an Englishman and\nearn outlawry before they may come back; and lest they prove fearful and\nbetray the secret, ten men follow each. They die by the hand of one or\nother of the ten unless they have slain their man within two weeks. So\nthe secret has been kept more years than ten men can remember!\" (That\nestimate was doubtless due to a respect for figures and bore no relation\nto the length of a human generation.)\n\n\"Whom did she kill to gain admission?\" King asked him unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ask her!\" said Ismail. \"It is her business.\"\n\n\"And thou? Was the life of a British officer the price paid?\"\n\n\"Nay. I slew a mullah.\"\n\nThe calmness of the admission, and the satisfaction that its memory\nseemed to bring the owner made King laugh. He found lawless satisfaction\nfor himself in that Ismail's blood-price should have been a priest, not\none of his brother officers. A man does not follow King's profession for\nhealth, profit or sentiment's sake, but healthy sentiment remains. The\nloyalty that drives him, and is its own most great reward, makes him a\nman to the middle. He liked Ismail. He could not have liked him in the\nsame way if he had known him guilty of English blood, which is only\nproof, of course, that sentiment and common justice are not one. But\nsentiment remains. Justice is an ideal.\n\n\"Be warned and go back!\" urged Ismail.\n\n\"Come with me, then.\"\n\n\"Nay, I am her man. She waits for me!\"\n\n\"I imagine she waits for me!\" laughed King. \"Forward! We have rested in\nthis place long enough!\"\n\nSo on they went, climbing and descending the naked ramparts that lead\neastward and upward and northward to the Roof of Mother Earth--Ismail\never grumbling into his long beard, and King consumed by a fiercer\nenthusiasm than ever had yet burned in him,\n\n\"Forward! Forward! Cast hounds forward! Forward in any event!\" says\nCocker. It is only regular generals in command of troops in the field\nwho must keep their rear open for retreat. The Secret Service thinks\nonly of the goal ahead.\n\nIt was ten of a blazing forenoon, and the sun had heated up the rocks\nuntil it was pain to walk on them and agony to sit, when they topped the\nlast escarpment and came in sight of Khinjan's walls, across a\nmile-wide rock ravine--Khinjan the unregenerate, that has no other human\nhabitation within a march because none dare build.\n\nThey stood on a ridge and leaned against the wind. Beneath them a path\nlike a rope ladder descended in zigzags to the valley that is Khinjan's\ndry moat; it needed courage as well as imagination to believe that the\nanimals could be guided down it.\n\n\"Is there no other way?\" asked King. He knew well of one other, but one\ndoes not tell all one knows in the \"Hills,\" and there might have been a\nthird way.\n\n\"None from this side,\" said Ismail.\n\n\"And on the other side?\"\n\n\"There is a rather better path--that by which the sirkar's troops once\ncame--although it has been greatly obstructed since. It is two days'\nmarch from here to reach it. Be warned a last time, sahib--little\nhakim--be warned and go back!\"\n\n\"Thou bird of ill omen!\" laughed King. \"Must thou croak from every rock\nwe rest on?\"\n\n\"If I were a bird I would fly away back with thee!\" said Ismail.\n\n\"Forward, since we can not fly--forward and downward!\" King answered.\n\"She must have crossed this valley. Therefore there are things worth\nwhile beyond! Forward!\"\n\nThe animals, weary to death anyhow, fell rather that walked down the\ntrack. The men sat and scrambled. And the heat rose up to meet them from\nthe waterless ravine as if its floor were Tophet's lid and the devil\nbusy under it, stoking.\n\nIt was midday when at last they stood on bottom and swayed like men in a\ndream fingering their bruises and scarcely able for the heat haze to\nsee the tangled mass of stone towers and mud-and-stone walls that faced\nthem, a mile away. Nobody challenged them yet. Khinjan itself seemed\ndead, crackled in the heat.\n\n\"Sahib, let us mount the hill again and wait for night and a cool\nbreeze!\" urged Darya Khan.\n\nIsmail clucked into his beard and spat to wet his lips.\n\n\"This glare makes my eyes ache!\" he grumbled.\n\n\"Wait, sahib! Wait a while!\" urged the others.\n\n\"Forward!\" ordered King. \"This must be Tophet. Know ye not that none\ncome out of Tophet by the way they entered in? Forward! The exit is\nbeyond!\"\n\nThey staggered after him, sheltering their eyes and faces from the\nglare with turban-ends and odds and ends of clothing. The animals swayed\nbehind them with hung heads and drooping ears, and neither man nor beast\nhad sense enough left to have detected an ambush. They were more than\nhalf-way across the valley, hunting for shadow where none was to be\nfound, when a shotted salute brought them up all-standing in a cluster.\nSix or eight nickel-coated bullets spattered on the rocks close by, and\none so narrowly missed King that he could feel its wind.\n\nUp went all their hands together, and they held them so until they\nached. Nothing whatever happened. Their arms ceased aching and grew\nnumb.\n\n\"Forward!\" ordered King.\n\nAfter another quarter of a mile of stumbling among hot boulders, not\none of which was big enough to afford cover, or shelter from the sun,\nanother volley whistled over them. Their hands went up again, and this\ntime King could see turbaned heads above a parapet in front. But nothing\nfurther happened.\n\n\"Forward!\" he ordered.\n\nThey advanced another two hundred yards and a third volley rattled\namong the rocks on either hand, frightening one of the mules so that it\nstumbled and fell and had to be helped up again. When that was done,\nand the mule stood trembling, they all faced the wall. But they were too\nweary to hold their hands up any more. Thirst had begun to exercise its\nsway. One of the men was half delirious.\n\n\"Who are ye?\" howled a human being, whose voice was so like a wolf's\nthat the words at first had no meaning. He peered over the parapet,\na hundred feet above, with his head so swathed in dirty linen that he\nlooked like a bandaged corpse.\n\n\"What will ye? Who comes uninvited into Khinjan?\"\n\nKing bethought him of Yasmini's talisman. He, held it up, and the gold\nband glinted in the sun. Yet, although a Hillman's eyes are keener than\nan eagle's, he did not believe the thing could be recognized at that\nangle, and from that distance. Another thought suggested itself to him.\nHe turned his head and caught Ismail in the act of signaling with both\nhands.\n\n\"Ye may come!\" howled the watchman on the parapet, disappearing\ninstantly.\n\nKing trembled--perhaps as a racehorse trembles at the starting gate,\nthough he was weary enough to tremble from fatigue. The \"Hills,\" that\nnumb the hearts of many men, had not cowed him, for he loved them and\nin love there is no fear. Heat and cold an hunger were all in the day's\nwork; thirst was an incident; and the whistle of lead in the wind had\nnever meant more to him than work ahead to do.\n\nBut a greyhound trembles in the leash. A boiler, trembles when word goes\ndown the speaking-tube from the bridge for \"all she's got.\" And so\nthe mild-looking hakim Kurram Khan, walking gingerly across her rocks,\ndonning cheap, imitation shell-rimmed spectacles to help him look the\npart, trembled even more than the leg-weary horse he led.\n\nBut that passed. He was all in hand when he led his men up over a rough\nstone causeway to a door in the bottom of a high battlemented wall and\nwaited for somebody to open it.\n\nThe great teak door looked as if it had been stolen from some Hindu\ntemple, and he wondered how and when they could have brought it there\nacross those savage intervening miles. With its six-inch teak planks\nand bronze bolts its weight must be guessed at in tons--yet a horse can\nhardly carry a man along any of the trails that lead to Khinjan!\n\nThe wood bore the marks of siege and fracture repair. The walls were\nnew-built, of age-old stone. The last expedition out of India had\nleveled every bit of those defenses flat with the valley, but Khinjan's\ndevils had reerected them, as ants rebuild a rifled nest.\n\nThe door was swung open after a time, pulled by a rope, manipulated from\nabove by unseen hands. Inside was another blind wall, twenty feet behind\nthe first. To the right a low barricade blocked the passage and provided\na safe vantage point from which it could be swept by a hail of lead;\nbut to the left a path ran unobstructed for more than a hundred yards\nbetween the walls, to where the way was blocked by another teak door,\nset in unscalable black rock. High above the door was a ledge of rock\nthat crossed like a bridge from wall to wall, with a parapet of stone\nbuilt upon it, pierced for rifle-fire.\n\nAs they approached this second door a Rangar turban, not unlike King's\nown, appeared above the parapet on the ledge and a voice he recognized\nhailed him good-humoredly.\n\n\"Salaam aleikoum!\"\n\n\"And upon thee be peace!\" King answered in the Pashtu tongue, for the\n\"Hills\" are polite, whatever the other principles.\n\nRewa Gunga's face beamed down on him, wreathed in smiles that seemed to\ninclude mockery as well as triumph. Looking up at him at an angle that\nmade his neck ache and dazzled his eyes, King could not be sure, but it\nseemed to him that the smile said, \"Here you are, my man, and aren't you\nin for it?\" He more than half suspected he was intended to understand\nthat. But the Rangar's conversation took another line.\n\n\"By jove!\" he chuckled. \"She expected you. She guessed you are a hound\nwho can hunt well on a dry scent, and she dared bet you will come in\nspite of all odds! But she didn't expect you in Rangar dress! No, by\njove! You jolly well will take the wind out of her sails!\"\n\nKing made no answer. For one thing, the word \"hound,\" even in English,\nis not essentially a compliment. But he had a better reason than that.\n\n\"Did you find the way easily?\" the Rangar asked but King kept silence.\n\n\"Is he parched? Have they cut his tongue out on the road?\"\n\nThat question was in Pashtu, directed at Ismail and the others, but King\nanswered it.\n\n\"Oh, as for that,\" he said, salaaming again in the fastidious manner\nof a native gentleman, \"I know no other tongue than Pashtu and my own\nRajasthani. My name is Kurram Khan. I ask admittance.\"\n\nHe held up his wrist to show the gold bracelet, and high over his head\nthe Rangar laughed like a bell.\n\n\"Shabash!\" he laughed. \"Well done! Enter, Kurram Khan, and be welcome,\nthou and thy men. Be welcome in her name!\"\n\nSomebody pulled a rope and the door yawned wide, giving on a kind of\ncourtyard whose high walls allowed no view of anything but hot blue sky.\nKing hurried under the arch and looked up, but on the courtyard side of\nthe door the wall rose sheer and blank, and there was no sign of window\nor stairs, or of any means of reaching the ledge from which the Rangar\nhad addressed him. What he did see, as he faced that way, was that\neach of his men salaamed low and covered his face with both hands as he\nentered.\n\n\"Whom do ye salute?\" he asked.\n\nIsmail stared back at him almost insolently, as one who would rebuke a\nfool.\n\n\"Is this not her nest these days?\" he answered. \"It is well to bow low.\nShe is not as other women. She is she! See yonder!\"\n\nThrough a gap under an arch in a far corner of the courtyard came a\none-eyed, lean-looking villain in Afridi dress who leaned on a long gun\nand stared at them under his hand. After a leisurely consideration of\nthem he rubbed his nose slowly with one finger, spat contemptuously, and\nthen used the finger to beckon them, crooking it queerly and turning on\nhis heel. He did not say one word.\n\nKing led the way after him on foot, for even in the \"Hills\" where\ncruelty is a virtue, a man may be excused, on economic grounds, for\nshowing mercy to his beast. His men tugged the weary animals along\nbehind him, through the gap under the arch and along an almost\ninterminable, smelly maze of alleys whose sides were the walls of square\nstone towers, or sometimes of mud-and-stone-walled compounds, and here\nand there of sheer, slab-sided cliff.\n\nAt intervals they came to bolted narrow doors, that probably led up to\noverhead defenses. Not fifty yards of any alley was straight; not a yard\nbut what was commanded from overhead. Khinjan bad been rebuilt since its\nlast destruction by some expert who knew all about street fighting. Like\nOld Jerusalem, the place could have contained a civil war of a hundred\nfactions, and still have opposed stout resistance to an outside army.\n\nAlley gave on to courtyard, and filthy square to alley, until\nunexpectedly at last a seemingly blind passage turned sharply and opened\non a straight street, of fair width, and more than half a mile long. It\nis marked \"Street of the Dwellings\" on the secret army maps, and it has\nbeen burned so often by Khinjan rioters, as well as by expeditions out\nof India, that a man who goes on a long journey never expects to find it\nthe same on his return.\n\nIt was lined on either hand with motley dwellings, out of which a\nmotlier crowd of people swarmed to stare at King and his men. There were\nhouses built of stolen corrugated iron-that cursed, hot, hideous stuff\nthat the West has inflicted on an all-too-willing East; others of\nwood--of stone--of mud--of mat of skins--even of tent-cloth. Most of\nthem were filthy. A row of kites sat on the roof of one, and in the\ngutter near it three gorged vultures sat on the remains of a mule.\nScarcely a house was fit to be defended, for Khinjan's fighting men all\npossess towers, that are plastered about the overfrowning mountain like\nwasp nests on a wall. These were the sweepers, the traders, the loose\nwomen, the mere penniless and the more or less useful men--not Khinjan's\ninner guard by any means.\n\nThere were Hindus--sycophants, keepers of accounts and writers to\nthe chiefs (since literacy is at premium in these parts). In proof of\nKhinjan's catholic taste and indiscriminate villainy, there were\nwomen of nearly every Indian breed and caste, many of them stolen into\nshameful slavery, but some of them there from choice. And there were\nlittle children--little naked brats with round drum tummies, who\nsquealed and shrilled and stared with bold eyes; some of them were\npretending to be bandits on their own account already, and one flung a\nstone that missed King by an inch. The stone fell in the gutter on the\nfar side and, started a fight among the mangy street curs, which\nproved a diversion and probably saved King's party from more accurate\nattentions.\n\nPerhaps a thousand souls came out to watch, all told. Not an eye of them\nall missed the government marks on King's trappings, or the government\nbrand on the mules, and after a minute or two, when the procession was\nhalf-way down the street, a man reproved the child who had thrown\na stone, and he was backed up by the others. They classified King\ncorrectly, exactly as he meant they should. As a hakim--a man of\nmedicine--he could fill a long-felt want; but by the brand on his\naccouterments he walked an openly avowed robber, and that made him a\nbrother in crime. Somebody cuffed the next child who picked up a stone.\n\nHe knew the street of old, although it had changed perhaps a dozen times\nsince he had seen it. It was a cul-de-sac, and at the end of it, just\nas on his previous visit, there stood a stone mosque, whose roof leaned\nback at a steep angle against the mountain-side. The fact that it was a\nmosque, and that it was the only building used as such in Khinjan,\nhad saved it from being leveled to the ground by the last British\nexpedition.\n\nIt was a famous mosque in its way, for the bed-sheet of the Prophet is\nknown to hang in it, preserved against the ravages of time and the touch\nof infidels by priceless Afghan rugs before and behind, so that it hangs\nlike a great thin sandwich before the rear stone wall. King had seen\nit. Very vividly he recalled his almost exposure by a suspicious mullah,\nwhen he had crept nearer to examine it at close range. For the Secret\nService must probe all things.\n\nThere had been an attempt since his last visit to make the mosque's\nexterior look more in keeping with the building's use. It was cleaner.\nIt had been smeared with whitewash. A platform had been built on the\nroof for the muezzin. But it still looked more like a fort than a place\nof worship.\n\nToward it the one-eyed ruffian led the way, with the long,\nleisurely-seeming gait of a mountaineer. At the door, in the middle of\nthe end of the street, he paused and struck on the lintel three times\nwith his gun-butt. And that was a strange proceeding, to say the least,\nin a land where the mosque is public resting place for homeless ones,\nand all the \"faithful\" have a right to enter.\n\nA mullah, shaven like a mummy for some unaccountable reason--even his\neyebrows and eyelashes had been removed--pushed his bare head through\nthe door and blinked at them. There was some whispering and more\nstaring, and at last the mullah turned his back.\n\nThe door slammed. The one-eyed guide grounded his gun-butt on the\nstone, and the procession waited, watched by the crowd that had lost its\ninterest sufficiently to talk and joke.\n\nIn two minutes the mullah returned and threw a mat over the threshold.\nIt turned out to be the end of a long narrow strip that he kicked and\nunrolled in front of him all across the floor of the mosque. After that\nit was not so astonishing that the horses and mules were allowed to\nenter.\n\n\"Which proves I was right after all!\" murmured King to himself.\n\nIn a steel box at Simla is a memorandum, made after his former visit\nto the place, to the effect that the entrance into Khinjan Caves might\npossibly be inside the mosque. Nobody had believed it likely, and he\nhad not more than half favored it himself; but it is good, even when\nthe next step may lead into a death-trap, to see one's first opinions\nconfirmed.\n\nHe nodded to himself as the outer door slammed shut behind them, for\nthat was another most unusual circumstance.\n\nA faint light shone through slit-like windows, changing darkness into\ngloom, and little more than vaguely hinting at the Prophet's bed-sheet.\nBut for a section of white wall to either side of it, the relic might\nhave seemed part of the shadows. The mullah stood with his back to it\nand beckoned King nearer. He approached until he could see the pattern\non the covering rugs, and the pink rims round the mullah's lashless\neyes.\n\n\"What is thy desire?\" the mullah asked--as a wolf might ask what a lamb\nwants.\n\nSupposing Yasmini to be jealous of invasion of her realm, King did not\ndoubt she would be glad to have him break down at this point. Until he\nhad actually gained access to her, nobody could reasonably charge her\nwith his safety. If he had been done to death in the Khyber, the sirkar\nwould have known it in a matter of hours. If he were killed here they\nmight never know it.\n\n\"Answer!\" said the mullah. \"What is thy desire?\"\n\n\"Audience with her!\" he answered, and showed the gold bracelet on his\nwrist.\n\nThe red eye-rims of the mullah blinked a time or two, and though he\ndid not salute the bracelet, as others had invariably done, his manner\nunderwent a perceptible change.\n\n\"That is proof that she knows thee. What is thy name.\"\n\n\"Kurram Khan.\"\n\n\"And thy business?\"\n\n\"Hakim.\"\n\n\"We need thee in Khinjan Caves! But none enter who have not earned right\nto enter! There is but one key. Name it!\"\n\nKing drew in his breath. He had hoped Yasmini's talisman would prove to\nbe key enough. The nails his left hand nearly pierced the palm, but he\nsmiled pleasantly.\n\n\"He who would enter must slay a man before witnesses in the teeth of\nwritten law!\" he said.\n\n\"And thou?\"\n\n\"I slew an Englishman!\" The boast made his blood run cold, but his\nexpression was one of sinful pride.\n\n\"Whom? When? Where?\"\n\n\"Athelstan King--a British arrficer--sent on his way to these 'Hills' to\nspy!\"\n\nIt was like having spells cast on himself to order!\n\n\"Where is his body?\"\n\n\"Ask the vultures! Ask the kites!\"\n\n\"And thy witnesses?\"\n\nHoping against hope, King turned and waved his hand. As he did so, being\nquick-eyed, he saw Ismail drive an elbow home into Darya Khan's ribs, an\ncaught a quick interchange of whispers.\n\n\"These men are all known to me,\" said the mullah. \"They all have right\nto enter here. They have right to testify. Did ye see him slay his man?\"\n\n\"Aye!\" lied Ismail, prompt as friend can be.\n\n\"Aye!\" lied Darya Khan, fearful of Ismail's elbow.\n\n\"Then, enter!\" said the priest resignedly, as one admits a communicant\nagainst his better judgment.\n\nHe turned his back on them so as to face the Prophet's bed-sheet and\nthe rear wall, and in that minute a hairy hand gripped King's arm from\nbehind, and Ismail's voice hissed hot-breathed in his ear.\n\n\"Ready of tongue! Ready of wit! Who told thee I would lie to save thy\nskin? Be thy kismet as thy courage, then--but I am hers, not thy man!\nHers, thou light of life--though God knows I love thee!\"\n\nThe mullah seized the Prophet's bed-sheet and its covering rugs in both\nhands, with about as much reverence as salesmen show for what they keep\nin stock. The whole lot slid to one side by means of noisy rings on a\nrod, and a wall lay bare, built of crudely cut but very well laid stone\nblocks. It appeared to reach unbroken across the whole width of the\nmosque's interior.\n\nOn the floor lay a mallet, a peculiar thing of bronze, cast in one\npiece, handle and all. The mullah took it in his band and struck the\nstone floor sharply once--then twice again--then three times--then a\ndozen times in quick succession. The floor rang hollow at that spot.\n\nAfter about a minute there came one answering hammer-stroke from beyond\nthe wall. Then the mullah laid the mallet down and though King ached to\npick it up and examine it he did not dare.\n\nExcitement now was probably the least of his emotions. It had been\nswallowed in interest. But in his guise of hakim he had to beware of\nthat superficial western carelessness, that permits folk to acknowledge\nthemselves frightened or excited or amused. His business was to attract\nas little attention to himself as possible; and to that end he folded\nhis hands and looked reverent, as if entering some Mecca of his dreams.\nThrough his horn-rimmed spectacles his eyes looked far-away and dreamy.\nBut it would have been a mistake to suppose that a detail was escaping\nhim.\n\nThe irregular lines in the masonry began to be more pronounced. All at\nonce the wall shook and they gaped by an inch or two, as happens when an\nearthquake has shaken buildings without bringing anything down. Then an\nirregular section of wall began to move quite smoothly away in front of\nhim, leaving a gap through which eight men abreast could have marched.\n\nAs it receded be observed that the lowest course stones was laid on\na bronze foundation, that keyed in wide bronze grooves. There was oil\nenough in the grooves to have greased a ship's ways and there neither\nsqueak nor tremor as the tons of masonry slid back.\n\nAt the end of perhaps three minutes that section of the wall had become\nthe fourth side of a twenty-foot-wide island that stood fair in the\nmiddle of a tunnel, splitting it in two to right and left. Judging by\nthe angle of the two divisions they became one again before going very\nfar.\n\nThe mullah stood aside and motioned King to enter. But the one-eyed\nguide who had led them to the mosque thrust himself between Darya Khan\nand Ismail, pushed King aside and took the lead.\n\n\"Nay!\" he said, \"I am responsible to her.\"\n\nIt was the first time he had spoken and he appeared to resent the waste\nof words.\n\nThe tunnel that led to the left was pierced in twenty places in the roof\nfor rifle-fire; a score of men with enough ammunition could have held\nit forever against an army. But the right-hand way looked undefended.\nNevertheless, the guide led to the left, and King followed him, filled\nwith curiosity.\n\n\"Many have entered!\" sang the lashless mullah in a sing-song chant.\n\"More have sought to enter! Some who remained without were wisest! I\ncount them! I keep count! Many went in! Not all came out again by this\nroad!\"\n\n\"Then there is another road?\" King wondered, but he held his tongue and\nfollowed the guide.\n\nIt proved to be fifty yards through part natural, part hand-hewn, tunnel\nto the neck of the fork where the left--and right-hand passages became\none again. He stopped at the fork and looked back, for none of his men\nwas following.\n\nHe caught the sound of scuffling of clattering hoofs, and grunts and\nshouted oaths--and started to run back, since even a native hakim may\nprotect his own, should he care to, even in the \"Hills.\"\n\nFor the sake of principle he chose the other passage, for Cocker says,\n\"Look! Look! Look!\" But the guide seized him by the arm from behind and\nswung him back again.\n\n\"Not that way!\" he growled. But he offered no explanation.\n\nIn the \"Hills\" it is not good to ask \"why\" of strangers. It is good\nto be glad one was not knifed, and to be deferent until more suitable\noccasion. King started to run again, but this time along the same\ndefended passage down which they had come. And now the guide made no\nobjection but leaned on his long gun and waited.\n\nThe charger proved to be making the trouble--the horse that King had\nexchanged with the jezailchi in the Khyber. The terrified brute was\nrefusing to enter the passage, and all the men, including Ismail and the\nmullah, were shoving, or else tugging at the reins.\n\nAt the moment King appeared the united strength of six men was beginning\nto prevail. The mullah let go the reins, and in that instant the horse\nsaw King advance toward him out of the tunnel; so, after the manner of\nhorses, he chose the other passage. King ran at full speed round\nthe corner after him, remembering that the guide had admitted\nresponsibility, and therefore that the chances were he would be rescued\nshould he run into a trap.\n\nSuddenly, ten yards in the lead down the dark tunnel the horse threw his\nweight back with a clatter of sparks and screamed as only a horse can.\nAfter that there was neither sight nor sound of him.\n\nCreeping forward with both arms outstretched against the left-hand wall,\nhe reached the spot where, the horse had been, and shuddered on the\nsmooth dark edge of a hole that went the full width of the floor. There\ncame whispering up out of it, and a dank wet smell, as if there were\nrunning water a mile away below. He could feel that a little air flowed\ndownward into it. Twenty yards away on the far side the path resumed,\nbut there was neither hand nor foothold on the smooth damp\nwalls between. He went back to his men with a shiver between his\nshoulder-blades, and the mullah, standing in the gap of the mosque wall,\nblinked at him with lashless eyes.\n\n\"Many have entered,\" he chanted maliciously. \"Some went out by a\ndifferent road!\"\n\n\"Come!\" Ismail growled at the other men, seizing the mule's bridle\nhimself and leading to the left. \"The ghosts will have a charger now for\ntheir captain to ride! Lead on, Hakim sahib!\"\n\n\"Come!\" called the one-eyed guide from the neck of the fork ahead. And\nas they all pressed forward after King the hairless mullah gave a\nsignal and the great stone door slid slowly into place. It was like a\ntombstone. It was as if the world that mortals know were a thing of the\nforgotten past and the underworld lay ahead.\n\n\"Lead along, Charon!\" King grinned. He needed some sort of pleasantry\nto steady his nerves. But even so he wondered what the nerves of India\nwould be like if her millions knew of this place.\n\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\n\n\n     Oh, Abdul trod with a martial tread,\n     Swinging his scimiter's weight.\n     \"I am overlord here,\" he said,\n     \"And he who wishes may chance his head,\n     \"For my blade is long, and my arm is strong,\n     \"And the goods of the world to the bold belong!\"\n     So Abdul guarded the gate.\n\n     Many a head did Abdul cleave,\n     Turban and crown and chin,\n     For all the 'venturers sought to know\n     What it could be he guarded so.\n     And since none give but eke receive,\n     A thrust in his ribs made Abdul grieve\n     For good blood outpourin'.\n\n     His men wept, watching Abdul bleed\n     And life's light waning dim,\n     Till he cursed them. \"Open the fort gate wide!\n     To saddle, and scour the countryside\n     For a leech!\" he swore.  \"God rot ye, ride!\"\n     'Twas thus, in the guise of a friend in need,\n     His enemy came to him.\n\n\nThe second gap closed up behind them and the tunnel began to echo\nweirdly. The mule was the next to be panic-stricken. The noise of\nhis plunging increased the echoes a thousand times and multiplied his\nfright, until the poor brute collapsed into meek obedience at last.\nBut the guide strode on unconcerned with his easy Hillman gait, neither\ndeigning to glance back nor making any verbal comment.\n\nOver their heads, at irregular intervals, there were holes that if they\nled as King presumed into caves above, left not an inch of all the\nlong passage that could not have been swept by rifle-fire. It was\nimpregnable; for no artillery heavy enough to pound the mountain into\npieces could ever be dragged within range. Whatever hiding place this\nentrance guarded could be held forever, given food and cartridges!\n\nThe tunnel wound to right and left like a snake, growing lighter and\nlighter after each bend; and soon their own din began to be swallowed in\na greater one that entered from the farther end. After two sharp turns\nthey came out unexpectedly into the blaze of blue day, nearly stunned by\nlight and sound. A road came up from below like that of an ocean in the\ngrip of a typhoon.\n\nWhen his wits recovered from the shock, King struggled with a wild\ndesire to yell, for before him, was what no servant of British India had\never seen and lived to tell about, and that is an experience more potent\nthan unbroken rum.\n\nThey had emerged from a round-mouthed tunnel--it looked already like a\nrabbit-hole, so huge was the cliff behind--on to a ledge of rock that\nformed a sort of road along one side of a mile-wide chasm. Above him, it\nseemed a mile up, was blue sky, to which limestone walls ran sheer, with\nscarcely a foothold that could be seen. Beneath, so deep that eyes\ncould not guess how deep, yawned the stained gorge of the underworld,\nmany-colored, smooth and wet.\n\nAnd out of a great, jagged slit in the side of the cliff, perhaps a\nthousand feet below them, there poured down into thunderous dimness a\nwaterfall whose breadth seemed not less than half a mile. It spouted\nseventy or eighty yards before it began to curve, and its din was like\nthe voice of all creation.\n\nIsmail came and stood by King in silence, taking his hand, as a little\nchild might. Presently he stooped and picked up a stone and tossed it\nover.\n\n\"Gone!\" he said simply. \"That down there is Earth's Drink!\"\n\n\"And this is the 'Heart of the Hills' men boast about?\"\n\n\"Nay! It is not!\" snapped Ismail.\n\n\"Then, where--\"\n\nBut the one-eyed guide beckoned impatiently, and King led the way after\nhim, staring as hakim or prisoner or any man had right to do on first\nadmission to such wonders. Not to have stared would have been to\nproclaim himself an idiot.\n\nThe least of all the wonders was that the secret of the place should\nhave been kept all down the centuries; for it was the hollow middle of\na limestone mountain, that could neither be looked down into from\nabove, because the heights were not scalable, nor guessed at from the\nconformation of the country. The river, that flowed out of rock and went\nplunging down into the chasm, must be snow from the Himalayan peaks, on\nits way to swell the sea. There was no other way to account for that;\nbut that explanation did explain why at least one Indian river is no\ngreater than it is.\n\nThe road they followed was a fold in the natural rock, rising and\nfalling and curving like a ribbon, but tending on the average downward.\nIt looked to be about two miles to the point where it curved at the\nchasm's end and swept round and downward, to be lost in a fissure in the\ncliff.\n\nThey soon began to pass the mouths of caves. Some were above the road,\nnow and then at crazy heights above it, reached by artificial steps hewn\nout of the stone. Others were below, reached from the road by means of\nladders, that trembled and swayed over the dizzying waterfall. Most of\nthe caves were inhabited, for armed men and sullen women came to their\nentrances to stare.\n\nEars grow accustomed to the sound of water sooner than to almost\nanything. It was not long before King's ears could catch the patter of\nhis men's feet following, and the shod clink of the mule. He could hear\nwhen Ismail whispered:\n\n\"Be brave, little hakim! She loves fearless men.\"\n\nAs the track descended caves became more numerous. In one there were\nhorses, for as they passed there came a whiff of unclean stables, and\nthe litter of fodder and dung was all about the entrance. The mouths\nof other caves were sealed, with great wax disks, strangely stamped,\naffixed to stout wooden doors. One cave smelt as if oil were stored in\nit, and King wondered whence the oil was brought--for the sirkar knows\nto a pint and an ounce what products travel up and down the Khyber.\n\nAt last the guide halted, in the middle of a short steep slope where the\npath was less than six feet wide and a narrow cave mouth gave directly\non to it.\n\n\"Be content to rest here!\" he said, pointing.\n\n\"Thy cave?\" asked King.\n\n\"Nay. God's! I am the caretaker!\"\n\n(The \"Hills\" are very pious and polite, between the acts of robbing and\nshedding blood.)\n\n\"Allah, then, reward thee, brother!\" answered King. \"Allah give sight to\nthy blind eye! Allah give thee children! Allah give thee peace, and to\nall thy house!\"\n\nThe guide salaamed, half-mockingly, half-wondering at such eloquence,\npausing in the passage to point into the side-caves that debouched to\neither hand. There was a niche of a place, where a man might lie on\nguard near the entrance; another cave in which horses could be stabled,\nwith plenty of fodder piled up ready; another beyond that for servants\nand baggage, with a fireplace and cooking pots; and at the last at the\nrear of all a great cavern full of eerie gloom, that opened out from the\nend of the passage like a bottle at the end of a long neck.\n\nPeering about him into vastness, King became aware of frame beds, placed\nat intervals in a row, each with a mat beside it. And there were several\nbrass basins and ewers for water. Also there were some little bronze\nlamps; the guide lit three of them, and King took up one to examine it.\nAs he did so, involuntarily his hand almost went to his bosom, where the\nstrange knife still reposed that he had taken from the would-be murderer\nin the train to Delhi.\n\nThere was no gold on the lamp; but the handle by which he lifted it had\nbeen cast, the devils of the Himalayas only knew how many centuries ago,\nin the form of a woman dancing; her size, and her shape, and the art\nwith which she had been fashioned, were the same as the handle of the\nknife.\n\nWatching him as a wolf eyes another one, the strange guide found his\ntongue.\n\n\"How many such hast thou ever seen?\" he asked.\n\n\"None!\" answered King, and the guide cackled at him, like a hen that has\nlaid an egg.\n\n\"There be many strange things in Khinjan, but few strangers!\" he\nremarked; and then, as if that were enough for any man to say on any\noccasion, he turned on his heel and stalked out of the cavern. It was\nthe last King ever saw of him. He followed him down the passage to the\nentrance and watched him until his back disappeared round the first\nbend, but the man never turned his head once. He did not even look over\nthe edge of the road, down into the amazing waterfall, nor up to the\nround disk of sky.\n\nKing turned back and looked into the other caves--saw the weary horse\nand mule fed, watered and bedded down--took note of the running water\nthat rushed out of a rock fissure and gurgled out of sight down another\none--examined the servants' cave and saw that they had been amply\nprovided with blankets. There was nothing lacking that the most exacting\ntraveler could have demanded at such a distance from civilization. There\nwas more than the most exacting would have dared expect.\n\n\"Why isn't it damp in here?\" he wondered, returning to his own cave. And\nthen he noticed long fissures in the cavern walls, and that the smoke\nfrom the lamps drifted toward them. He could not guess what made it\ndo that, unless it were the suction of the enormous river hurrying\nunderground; and then he remembered that at the entrance air had rushed\ndownward into the hole down which the horse had disappeared, which\npartly confirmed his guess.\n\n\"Ismail!\" he shouted, and jumped at the revolver-crack--like echo of his\nvoice.\n\nIsmail came running.\n\n\"Make the men carry the mule's packs into this cave. You and Darya Khan\nstay here and help me open them. Remember, ye are both assistants of\nKurram Khan, the hakim!\"\n\n\"They will laugh at us! They will laugh at us!\" clucked Ismail, but he\nhurried to obey, while King wondered who would laugh.\n\nWithin an hour a delegation came from no less a person than Yasmini\nherself, bearing her compliments, and hot food savory enough to make\na brass idol's mouth water. By that time King had his sets of surgical\ninstruments and drugs and bandages all laid out on one of the beds and\ncovered from view by a blanket.\n\nIt was only one more proof of the British army's everlasting luck that\none of the men, who set the great brass dish of food on the floor\nnear King, had a swollen cheek, and that he should touch the swelling\nclumsily, as he lifted his hand to shake back a lock of greasy hair.\n\nThere followed an oath like flint struck on steel ten times in rapid\nsuccession.\n\n\"Does it pain thee, brother?\" asked Kurram Khan the hakim.\n\n\"Are there devils in Tophet! Fire and my veins are one!\"\n\nThe man did not notice the eagerness beaming out of King's horn-rimmed\nspectacles, but Ismail did; it seemed to him time to prove his virtues\nas assistant.\n\n\"This is the famous hakim Kurram Khan,\" he boasted. \"He can cure\nanything, and for a very little fee!\"\n\n\"Nay, for no fee at all in this case!\" said King.\n\nThe man looked incredulous, but King drew the covering from his row of\ninstruments and bottles.\n\n\"Take a chance!\" he advised. \"None but the brave wins anything!\"\n\nThe man sat down, as if he would argue the point at length, but Ismail\nand Darya Khan were new to the business and enthusiastic. They had him\ndown, held tight on the floor to the huge amusement of the rest, before\nthe man could even protest; and his howls of rage did him no good, for\nIsmail drove the hilt of a knife between his open jaws to keep them\nopen.\n\nA very large proportion of King's stores consisted of morphia and\ncocaine. He injected enough cocaine to deaden the man's nerves, and\nallowed it time to work. Then he drew out three back teeth in quick\nsuccession, to make sure he had the right one.\n\nIsmail let the victim up, and Darya Khan gave him water in a brass\ncup. Utterly without pain for the first time for days, the man was as\ngrateful as a wolf freed from a trap.\n\n\"Allah reward thee, since the service was free!\" he smirked.\n\n\"Are there any others in pain in Khinjan?\" King asked him.\n\n\"Listen to him! What is Khinjan? Is there one man without a wound or a\nsore or a scar or a sickness?\"\n\n\"Then, tell them,\" said King.\n\nThe man laughed.\n\n\"When I show my jaw, there will be a fight to be first! Make ready,\nhakim! I go!\"\n\nHe was true to his word and left the cave like a gust of wind, followed\nby the three who had come with him. King sat down to eat, but he had not\nfinished his meal--he had made the last little heap of rice into a\nball with his fingers, native style, and was mopping up the last of the\ncurried gravy with it--when the advance guard of the lame and the halt\nand the sick made its appearance. The cave's entrance became jammed with\nthem, and no riot ever made more noise.\n\n\"Hakim! Ho, hakim! Where is the hakim who draws teeth? Where is the man\nwho knows yunani?\"\n\nTen men burst down the passage all together, all clamoring, and one man\nwasted no time at all but began to tear away bloody bandages to show his\nwound. The hardest thing now was to get and keep some kind of order,\nand for ten minutes Ismail and Darya Khan labored, using threats where\nargument failed, and brute force when they dared. It was like beating\nmad hounds from off their worry. What established order at last was that\nKing rolled up his sleeves and began, so that eagerness gave place to\nwonder.\n\nThe \"Hills\" are not squeamish in any one particular; so that the fact\nthat the cave became a shambles upset nobody. The surgeon's thrill that\nmakes even half-amateurs oblivious of all but the work in hand,\ncoupled with the desperate need of winning this first trick, made King\nhorror-proof; and nobody waiting for the next turn was troubled because\nthe man under the knife screamed a little or bled more than usual.\n\nWhen they died--and more than one did die--men carried them out and\nflung them over the precipice into the waterfall below.\n\nIsmail and Darya Khan became choosers of the victims. They seized a man,\nlaid him on the bed, tore off his disgusting bandages and held their\nbreath until the awful resulting stench had more or less dispersed. Then\nKing would probe or lance or bandage as he saw fit, using anaesthetics\nwhen he must, but managing mostly without them.\n\nThey almost flung money at him. Few of them asked what his fee would\nbe. Those who had no money brought him shawls, and swords, and even\nclothing. Two or three brought old-fashioned fire-arms; but they were\nmen who did not expect to live. And King accepted every gift without\ncomment, because that was in keeping with the part he played. He tossed\nmoney and clothes and every other thing they gave him into a corner at\nthe back of the cave, and nobody tried to steal them back, although a\nman suspected of honesty in that company would have been tortured to\ndeath as an heretic and would have had no sympathy.\n\nFor hour after gruesome hour he toiled over wounds and sores such as\nonly battles and evil living can produce, until men began to come at\nlast with fresh wounds, all caused by bullets, wrapped in bandages on\nwhich the blood had caked but had not grown foul.\n\n\"There has been fighting in the Khyber,\" somebody, informed him, and\nhe stopped with lancet in mid-air to listen, scanning a hundred faces\nswiftly in the smoky lamplight. There were ten men who held lamps for\nhim, one of them a newcomer, and it was he who spoke.\n\n\"Fighting in the Khyber! Aye! We were a little lashkar, but we drove\nthem back into their fort! Aye! we slew many!\"\n\n\"Not a jihad yet?\" King asked, as if the world might be coming to an\nend. The words were startled out of him. Under other circumstances\nhe would never have asked that question so directly; but he had\nlost reckoning of everything but these poor devils' dreadful need of\ndoctoring, and he was like a man roused out of a dream. If a holy war\nhad been proclaimed already, then he was engaged on a forlorn hope. But\nthe man laughed at him.\n\n\"Nay, not yet. Bull-with-a-beard holds back yet. This was a little\nfight. The jihad shall come later!\"\n\n\"And who is 'Bull-with-a-beard'?\" King wondered; but he did not ask that\nquestion because his wits were awake again. It pays not to be in too\nmuch of a hurry to know things in the \"Hills.\"\n\nAs it happened, he asked no more questions, for there came a shout\nat the cave entrance whose purport he did not catch, and within five\nminutes after that, without a word of explanation, the cave was left\nempty of all except his own five men. They carried away the men too sick\nto walk and vanished, snatching the last man away almost before King's\nfingers had finished tying the bandage on his wound.\n\n\"Why is that?\" he asked Ismail. \"Why did they go? Who shouted?\"\n\n\"It is night,\" Ismail answered. \"It was time.\"\n\nKing stared about him. He had not realized until then that without aid\nof the lamps he could not see his own hand held out in front of him;\nhis eyes had grown used to the gloom, like those of the surgeons in the\nsick-bays below the water line in Nelson's fleet.\n\n\"But who shouted?\"\n\n\"Who knows? There is only one here who gives orders. We be many who\nobey,\" said Ismail.\n\n\"Whose men were the last ones?\" King asked him, trying a new line.\n\n\"Bull-with-a-beard's.\"\n\n\"And whose man art thou, Ismail?\"\n\nThe Afridi hesitated, and when he spoke at last there was not quite the\nsame assurance in his voice as once there had been.\n\n\"I am hers! Be thou hers, too! But it is night. Sleep against the toil\ntomorrow. There be many sick in Khinjan.\"\n\nKing made a little effort to clean the cave, but the task was hopeless.\nFor one thing he was so weary that his very bones were water; for\nanother, Ismail pretended to be equally tired, and when the suggestion\nthat they should help was put to the others they claimed their izzat\nindignantly. Izzat and sharm (honor and shame) are the two scarcely\ndistinguishable enemies of honest work, into whose teeth it takes both\nnerve and resolution to drive a Hillman at the best of times. Nerve King\nhad, but his resolution was asleep. He was too tired to care.\n\nHe appointed them to two-hour watches, to relieve one another until\ndawn, and flung himself on a clean bed. He was asleep before his head\nhad met the pillow; and for all he knew to the contrary he dreamed of\nYasmini all night long.\n\nIt seemed to him that she came into the cave--she the woman of the faded\nphotograph the general had given him in Peshawur--and that the cave\nbecame filled with the strange intoxicating scent that had first wooed\nhis senses in her reception room in Delhi.\n\nHe dreamed that she called him by name. First, \"King sahib!\" Then,\n\"Kurram Khan!\" And her voice was surprisingly familiar. But dreams are\nstrange things.\n\n\"He sleeps!\" said the same voice presently. \"It is good that he sleeps!\"\nAnd in his sleep he thought that a shadowy Ismail grunted an answer.\n\nAfter that he was very sure in his dream that it was good to sleep,\nalthough a voice he did not recognize and that he was quite sure was a\ndream-voice, kept whispering to him to wake up and protect himself.\n\nBut the scent grew stronger, and he began to dream of cobras, that\ndanced with a woman and struck at her so swiftly that she had to become\ntwo women in order to avoid them; and Rewa Gunga came and laughed at\nboth and called them amateurs, so that the woman became enraged and drew\na bronze-bladed dagger with a golden hilt.\n\nThen intelligible dreams ceased altogether, and he, slept like a dead\nman, but with a vague suggestion ever with him that Yasmini was not\nvery far away, and that she was interested in him to a point that was\nactually embarrassing. It was like the ether-dream he once dreamt in a\nhospital.\n\nWhen he awoke at last it was after dawn, and light shone down the\npassage into his cave.\n\n\"Ismail!\" he shouted, for he was thirsty. But there was no answer.\n\n\"Darya Khan!\"\n\nAgain there was no answer. He called each of the other men by name with\nthe same result.\n\nHe got up and realized then for the first time that he had not undressed\nhimself the night before. His head felt heavy, and although he did not\nbelieve he had been drugged, there was a scent he half-recognized that\npermeated the cave, and even overcame the dreadful atmosphere that the\nsick of yesterday had left behind. He decided to go to the cave mouth,\nsummon his men, who were no doubt sleeping as he had done, sniff the\nfresh air outside and come back to try the scent again; he would know\nthen whether his nose were deceiving him.\n\nBut there was no Ismail near the entrance--no Darya Khan--nor any of the\nother men. The horse was gone. So was the mule. So was the harness, and\neverything he had, except the drugs and instruments and the presents\nthe sick had given him; he had noticed all those still lying about in\nconfusion when he woke.\n\n\"Ismail!\" he shouted at the top of his lungs, thinking they might all be\noutside.\n\nHe heard a man hawk and spit, close to the entrance, and went out to\nsee. A man whom he had never seen before leaned on a magazine rifle and\neyed him as a tiger eyes its prey.\n\n\"No farther!\" he growled, bringing his rifle to the port.\n\n\"Why not?\" King asked him.\n\n\"Allah! When a camel dies in the Khyber do the kites ask why? Go in!\"\n\nHe thought then of Yasmini's bracelet, that always gained him at least\ncivility from every man who saw it. He held up his left wrist and knew\nthat instant why it felt uncomfortable. The bracelet has disappeared!\n\nHe turned back into the cave to hunt for it, and the strange scent\ngreeted him again. In spite of the surrounding stench of drugs and\nfilthy wounds, there was no mistaking it. If it had been her special\nscent in Delhi, as Saunders swore it was, and her special scent on the\nnote Darya Khan had carried down the Khyber, then it was hers now, and\nshe had been in the cave.\n\nHe hunted high and low and found no bracelet.\n\nHis pistol was gone, too, and his cartridges, but not the dagger,\nwrapped in a handkerchief, under his shirt. The money, that his patients\nhad brought him, lay on the floor untouched. It was an unusual robber\nwho had robbed him.\n\nAt least once in his life (or he were not human, but an angel) it dawns\non a man that he has done the unforgivable. It dawns on most men oftener\nthan once a week. So men learn sympathy.\n\n\"I should have been awake to change the guard every two hours!\" he\nadmitted, sitting on the bed. \"I wouldn't hesitate to shoot another man\nfor that--or for less!\"\n\nHe let the thought sink in, until the very lees of shame tasted like\nashes in his mouth. Then, being what he was,--and there are not very\nmany men good enough to shoulder what lay ahead of him--he set the whole\naffair behind him as part of the past and looked forward.\n\n\"Who's 'Bull-with-a-beard'?\" he wondered. \"Nobody interfered with me\nuntil I doctored his men. He's in opposition. That's a fair guess. Now,\nwho in thunder--by the fat lord Harry--can 'Bull-with-a-beard' be?\nAnd why fighting in the Khyber so early as all this? And why does\n'Bull-with-a-beard,' whoever he is, hang back?\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\n\n\n   Are jackals a tiger's friends because they flatter him and eat\n   his leavings?\n   Choose, ye with stripes and proud whiskers, choose between friend\n   and enemy.--Native Proverb\n\n\nThey came and changed the guard two hours after dawn, to the\naccompaniment of a lot of hawking and spitting, orders growled through\nthe mist, and the crash of rifle-butts grounding on the rock path. King\nwent to the cave entrance, to look the new man over; but because he was\nin Khinjan, and Khinjan in the \"Hills,\" where indirectness is the key to\ninformation, he stood for a while at gaze, listening to the thunder of\ntumbling water and looking at the cliff-edge six feet away that was laid\nlike a knife in the ascending mist.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye he noticed that the new man was a\nMahsudi--no sweeter to look at and no less treacherous for the fact.\nAlso, that he had boils all over the back of his neck. He was not likely\nto be better tempered because of that fact, either. But it is an ill\nwind that blows no good to the Secret Service.\n\n\"There is an end to everything,\" he remarked presently, addressing the\nworld at large, or as much as he could see of it through the cave mouth.\n\"A hill is so high, a pool so deep, a river so wide. How long, for\ninstance, must thy watch be?\"\n\n\"What is that to thee?\" the fellow growled.\n\n\"There is an end to pain!\" said King, adjusting his horn-rimmed\nspectacles. \"I lanced a man's boils last night, and it hurt him, but he\nmust be well to-day.\"\n\n\"Get in!\" growled the guard. \"She says it is sorcery! She says none are\nto let thee touch them!\"\n\nPlainly, he was in no receptive mood; orders had been spat into his\nhairy ear too recently.\n\n\"Get in!\" he growled, lifting his rifle-butt as if to enforce the order.\n\n\"I can heal boils!\" said King, retiring into the cave. Then, from a\nsafe distance down the passage, he added a word or two to sink in as the\nhours went by.\n\n\"It is good to be able to bend the neck without pain and to rest easily\nat night! It is good not to flinch at another's touch. Boils are bad!\nHealing is easy and good!\"\n\nThen, since a quarrel was the very last thing he was looking for, he\nretired into his own gloomy quarters at the rear, taking care to sit so\nthat he could see and overhear what passed at the entrance. Among other\nthings in the course of the day he noticed that the watch was changed\nevery four hours and that there were only three men in the guard, for\nthe same man was back again that evening.\n\nAt intervals throughout the day Yasmini sent him food by silent\nmessengers; so he ate, for \"the thing to do,\" says Cocker, \"is the first\nthat comes to hand, and the thing not to do is worry.\" It is not easy to\nworry and eat heartily at one and the same time. Having eaten, he rolled\nup his sleeves and native-made cotton trousers and proceeded to clean\nthe cave. After that he overhauled his stock of drugs and instruments,\nrepacking them and making ready against opportunity.\n\n\"As I told that heathen with a gun out there, there's an end to\neverything!\" he reflected. \"May this come soon!\"\n\nWhen they changed the guard that afternoon he had grown weary of his\nown company and of fruitless speculation and was pacing up and down. The\nsecond guard proved even less communicative than the first, up to the\npoint when, to lessen his ennui, King began to whistle. Because a Secret\nService man must be consistent, the tune was not English, but a weird\nminor one to which the \"Hills\" have set their favorite love song (that\nis, all about hate in the concrete!).\n\nThe echo of the waterfall within the cave was like the roaring in a\nshell held to the ear, but each time he came near the entrance the\nnew guard could catch a few bars of the tune. After a little while the\nhook-nosed ruffian began to sing the words to it, in a voice like a\nforgotten dog's.\n\nSo he stopped at the entrance and changed the tune. And the guard sang\nthe words of the new tune, too. After that he came out into the light\nof day (direct sunlight was cut off by the huge height of the cliffs all\naround) and leaned in the entrance, smiling.\n\n\"Allah preserve thee, brother!\" he remarked. \"Thine is a voice like a\nwarrior's--bold and big! Thou art a true son of the Prophet!\"\n\n\"Aye!\" said the fellow, \"that I am! Allah preserve thee, for thou hast\nmore need of it than I, although I guard thee just at present. Whistle\nme another one!\"\n\nSo King whistled the refrain of a song that boasts of an Afghan invasion\nof India, and of the loot that came of it, and the prisoners, and the\nwomen--particularly the women, mentioning more than a few of them by\nname, and their charms in detail. It was a song to warm the very cockles\nof a Hillman's heart. Nothing could have been better chosen for that\nsetting, of a cave mouth half-way down the side of a gash in earth's\nwildest mountains, with the blue sky resting on a jagged rim a mile\nabove.\n\n\"Good!\" said the bearded jailer. \"Now begin again and I will sing!\"\n\nHe threw his head back and howled until the mountain walls rang with the\nsong, and other men in far-off caves took it up and howled it back at\nhim. When he left off singing at last, to drink from a water-bottle,\nthat surely had been looted from a British soldier, King decided to be\ndone with overtures and make the next move in the game.\n\n\"Didst thou ever sing for her?\" he asked, and the man turned round to\nstare at him as if he were mad, King saw then a blood-soaked bandage on\nthe right of his neck, not very far from the jugular.\n\n\"When she sings we are silent! When she is silent it is good to wait a\nwhile and see!\" he answered.\n\n\"Hah!\" said King. \"Was that wound got in the Khyber the other day?\"\n\n\"Nay. Here in Khinjan. I had my thumb in a man's eye, and the bastard\nbit me! May devils do worse to him where he has gone! I threw him into\nEarth's Drink!\"\n\n\"A good place for one's enemies!\" laughed King.\n\n\"Aye!\"\n\n\"A man told me last night,\" said King, drawing on imagination without\nany compunction at all, \"that the fight in the Khyber was because a\njihad is launched aleady.\"\n\n\"That man lied!\" said the guard, shifting position uneasily, as if\nafraid to talk too much.\n\n\"So I told him!\" answered King. \"I told him there never will be another\njihad.\"'\n\n\"Then art thou a greater liar than he!\" the guard answered hotly. \"There\nwill be a jihad when she is ready, such an one as never yet was! India\nshall bleed for all the fat years she has lain unplundered! Not a throat\nof an unbeliever in the world shall be left un-slit! No jihad? Thou\nliar! Get in out of my sight!\"\n\nSo King retired into the cave, with something new to think about. Was\nshe planning the jihad! Or pretending to plan one? Every once in a while\nthe guard leaned far into the cave mouth and buried adjectives at him,\nthe mildest of which was a well of information. If his temper was the\ntemper of the \"Hills,\" it was easy to read disappointment for a jihad\nthat should have been already but had been postponed.\n\nWhen they changed the guard again the new man proved surly. There was\nno getting a word out of him. He showed dirty yellow teeth in a wolfish\nsnarl, and his only answer was a lifted rifle and a crooked forefinger.\nKing let him alone and paced the cave for hours.\n\nHe was squatting on his bed-end in the dark, like a spectacled image of\nBuddha, when the first of the three men came on guard again and at last\nIsmail came for him holding a pitchy torch that filled the dim passage\nfull of acrid smoke and made both of them, cough. Ismail was red-eyed\nwith it.\n\n\"Come!\" he growled. \"Come, little hakim!\" Then he turned on his heel at\nonce, as if afraid of being twitted with desertion. He seemed to want to\nget outside, where he could keep out of range of words, yet not to wish\nto seem unfriendly.\n\nBut King made no effort to speak to him, following in silence out on to\nthe dark ledge above the waterfall and noticing that the guard with the\nboils was back again on duty. He grinned evilly out of a shadow as King\npassed.\n\n\"Make an end!\" he advised, spitting over the Cliff into thunderous\ndarkness to illustrate the suggestion. \"Jump, hakim, before a worse\nthing happens!\"\n\nTo add further point be kicked a loose stone over the edge, and the\nmovement caused him to bend his neck and so inadvertently to hurt his\nboils. He cursed, and there was pity in King's voice when he spoke next.\n\n\"Do they hurt thee?\"\n\n\"Aye, like the devil! Khinjan is a place of plagues!\"\n\n\"I could heal them,\" King said, passing on, and the man stared hard.\n\n\"Come!\" boomed Ismail through the darkness, shaking the torch to make\nit burn better and beckoning impatiently, and King hurried after him,\nleaving behind a savage at the cave mouth who fingered his sores and\nwondered, muttering, leaning on a rifle, muttering and muttering again\nas if he had seen a new light.\n\nInstead of waiting for King to catch up, Ismail began to lead the way at\ngreat speed along a path that descended gradually until it curved round\nthe end of the chasm and plunged into a tunnel where the darkness grew\nopaque. In the tunnel the torch's smoke cast weird shadows on walls and\nroof, and the fitful light only confused, so that Ismail slowed down and\nlet him come up close.\n\nThen for thirty minutes he led swiftly down a crazy devil's stairway\nof uneven boulders, stopping to lend a hand at the worst places, but\neverlastingly urging him to hurry. They were both breathless, and King\nwas bruised in a dozen places when they reached level going at least six\nor seven hundred feet below the cave from which they started.\n\nThen the hell-mouth gloom began to grow faintly luminous, and the\nwaterfall's thunder burst on their ears from close at hand. They emerged\ninto fresh wet air and a sea of sound, on a rock ledge like the one\nabove. Ismail raised the torch and waved it. The fire and smoke wandered\nup, until they flattened on a moving opal dome, that prisoned all the\nnoises in the world.\n\n\"Earth's Drink!\" he announced, waving the torch and then shutting his\nmouth tight, as if afraid to voice sacrilege.\n\nIt was the river, million-colored in the torch-light, pouring from a\nhalf-mile-long slash in the cliff above them and plunging past them\nthrough the gloom toward the very middle of the world. Its width was a\nmatter of memory, and its depth unguessable, for although dim moonlight\nfiltered through it, he did not know where the moon was, nor how far\nsuch light could penetrate through moving water. Somewhere it met\nrock-bottom and boiled there, for a roar like the sea's came up from\ndeeps unimaginable.\n\nHe watched the overturning dome until his senses reeled. Then he crawled\non hands and knees to the ledge's brink and tried to peer over. But\nIsmail dragged him back.\n\n\"Come!\" he howled; but in all that din his shout was like a whisper.\n\n\"How deep is it?\" King bellowed back.\n\n\"Allah! Ask Him who made it!\"\n\nThe fear of the falls was on the Afridi, and he tugged at King's arm in\na frenzy of impatience. Suddenly he let go and broke into a run. King\ntrotted after him, afraid too, to look to right or left, lest the\nfear should make him throw himself over the brink. The thunder and the\nhugeness had their grip on him and had begun to numb his power to think\nand his will to be a man. Suddenly when they had run a hundred yards,\nIsmail turned sharp to the right into a tunnel that led straight back\ninto the cliff and sloped uphill. As the din of the falls grew less\nbehind him and his power to think returned, King calculated that they\nmust be following the main direction of the river bed, but edging away\ngradually to the right of it. After ten minutes' hurrying uphill he\nguessed they must be level with the river, in a tunnel running nearly\nparallel.\n\nHe proved to be right, for they came to a gap in the wall, and Ismail\nthrust the torch through it. The light shone on swift black water, and a\nwind rushed through the gap that nearly blew the torch out. It accounted\naltogether for the dryness of the rock and the fresh air in the tunnel.\nThe river's weight seemed to suck a hurricane along with it--air enough\nfor a million men to breathe.\n\nAfter that there was no more need to stop at intervals and beat the\ntorch against the wall to make it burn brightly, for the wind fanned it\nuntil the flame was nearly white. Ismail kept looking back to bid King\nhurry and never paused once to rest.\n\n\"Come!\" he urged fiercely. \"This leads to the 'Heart of the Hills'!\" And\nafter that King had to do his best to keep the Afridi's back in sight.\n\nThey began after a time to hear voices and to see the smoky glare made\nby other torches. Then Ismail set the pace yet faster, and they became\nthe last two of a procession of turbaned men, who tramped along a\nwinding tunnel into a great mountain's womb. The sound of slippers\nclicking and rutching on the rock floor swelled and died and swelled\nagain as the tunnel led from cavern into cavern.\n\nIn one great cave they came to every man beat out his torch and tossed\nit on a heap. The heap was more than shoulder high, and three parts\ncovered the floor of the cave. After that there was a ledge above the\nheight of a man's head on either side of the tunnel, and along the ledge\nlittle oil-burning lamps were spaced at measured intervals. They looked\nancient enough to have been there when the mountain itself was born,\nand although all the brass ones suggested Indian and Hindu origin, there\nwere others among them of earthenware that looked like plunder from\nancient Greece.\n\nIt was like a transposition of epochs. King felt already as if the\ntwentieth century had never existed, just as he seemed to have left life\nbehind for good and all when the mosque door had closed on him.\n\nA quarter of a mile farther along the tunnel opened into another, yet\ngreater cave, and there every man kicked off his slippers, without\nseeming to trouble how they lay; they littered the floor unarranged and\nuncared for, looking like the cast-off wing-cases of gigantic beetles.\n\nAfter that cave there were two sharp turns in the tunnel, and then at\nlast a sea of noise and a veritable blaze of light.\n\nPart of the noise made King feel homesick, for out of the mountain's\nvery womb brayed a music-box, such as the old-time carousels made use\nof before the days of electricity and steam. It was being worked by\ninexpert hands, for the time was something jerky; but it was robbed of\nits tinny meanness and even majesty by the hugeness of a\ncavern's roof, as well as by the crashing, swinging march it\nplayed--wild--wonderful--invented for lawless hours and a kingless\npeople.\n\n\"Marchons!--Citoyens!--\"\n\nThe procession began to tramp in time to it, and the rock shook. They\ndeployed to left and right into a space so vast that the eye at first\nrefused to try to measure it. It was the hollow core of a mountain,\nfilled by the sea-sound of a human crowd and hung with huge stalactites\nthat danced and shifted and flung back a thousand colors at the\nflickering light below.\n\nThere was an undertone to the clangor of the music-box and the human\nhum, for across the cavern's farther end for a space of two hundred\nyards the great river rushed, penned here into a deep trough of less\nthan a tenth its normal width--plunging out of a great fanged gap and\nhurrying out of view down another one, licking smooth banks on its way\nwith a hungry sucking sound. Its depth where it crossed the cavern's\nend could only be guessed by remembering the half-mile breadth of the\nwaterfall.\n\nThere were little lamps everywhere, perched on ledges amid the\nstalactites, and they suffused the whole cavern in golden glow, made the\ncrowd's faces look golden and cast golden shimmers on the cold, black\nriver bed. There was scarcely any smoke, for the wind that went like a\nstorm down the tunnel seemed to have its birth here; the air was fresh\nand cool and never still. No doubt fresh air was pouring in continually\nthrough some shaft in the rock, but the shaft was invisible.\n\nIn the midst of the cavern a great arena had been left bare, and\nthousands of turbaned men squatted round it in rings. At the end where\nthe river formed a tangent to them the rings were flattened, and at that\npoint they were cut into by the ramp of a bridge, and by a lane left\nto connect the bridge with the arena. The bridge was almost the most\nwonderful of all.\n\nSo delicately formed that fairies might have made it with a guttered\ncandle, it spanned the river in one splendid sweep, twenty feet above\nwater, like a suspension bridge. Then, so light and graceful that it\nscarcely seemed to touch anything at all, it swept on in irregular\narches downward to the arena and ceased abruptly as if shorn off by a\ngiant ax, at a point less than half-way to it.\n\nIts end formed a nearly square platform, about fourteen feet above\nthe floor, and the broad track thence to the arena, as well as all the\narena's boundary, had been marked off by great earthenware lamps, whose\ngreasy smoke streaked up and was lost by the wind among the stalactites.\n\n\"Greek lamps, every one of 'em!\" King whispered to himself, but he\nwasted no time just then on trying to explain how Greek lamps had ever\ngot there. There was too much else to watch and wonder at.\n\nNo steps led down from the bridge end to the floor; toward the arena it\nwas blind. But from the bridge's farther end across the hurrying water\nstairs had been hewn out of the rock wall and led up to a hole of twice\na man's height, more than fifty feet above water level.\n\nOn either side of the bridge end a passage had been left clear to the\nriver edge, and nobody seemed to care to invade it, although it was not\nmarked off in any way. Each passage was about fifty feet wide and quite\nstraight. But the space between the bridge end and the arena, and the\narena itself, had to be kept free from trespassers by fifty swaggering\nruffians armed to the teeth.\n\nEvery man of the thousands there had a knife in evidence, but the arena\nguards had magazine rifles well as Khyber tulwars. Nobody else wore\nfirearms openly. Some of the arena guards bore huge round shields of\nprehistoric pattern of a size and sort he had never seen before, even\nin museums. But there was very little that he was seeing that night of a\nkind that he had seen before anywhere!\n\nThe guards lolled insolently, conscious of brute strength and special\nfavor. When any man trespassed with so much as a toe beyond the ring of\nlamps, a guard would slap his rifle-butt until the swivels rattled and\nthe offender would scurry into bounds amid the jeers of any who had\nseen.\n\nShoving, kicking and elbowing with set purpose, Ismail forced a way\nthrough the already seated crowd, and drew King down into the cramped\nspace beside him, close enough to the arena to be able to catch the\nguards' low laughter. But he was restless. He wished to get nearer yet,\nonly there seemed no room anywhere in front.\n\nThe music-box was hidden. King could see it nowhere. Five minutes after\nhe and Ismail were seated it stopped playing. The hum of the crowd died\ntoo.\n\nThen a guard threw his shield down with a clang and deliberately fired\nhis rifle at the roof. The ricocheting bullet brought down a shower of\nsplintered stone and stalactite, and he grinned as he watched the\ncrowd dodge to avoid it. Before they had done dodging and while he yet\ngrinned, a chant began--ghastly--tuneless--so out of time that the words\nwere not intelligible--yet so obvious in general meaning that nobody\ncould hear it and not understand.\n\nIt was a devils' anthem, glorifying hellishness--suggestive of the\ngnashing of a million teeth, and the whicker of drawn blades--more\nshuddersome and mean than the wind of a winter's night. And it ceased as\nsuddenly as it had begun.\n\nAnother ruffian fired at the roof, and while the crack of the shot yet\nechoed seven other of the arena guards stepped forward with long horns\nand blew a blast. That was greeted by a yell that made the cavern\ntremble.\n\nInstantly a hundred men rose from different directions and raced for the\narena, each with a curved sword in either hand. The yelling changed back\ninto the chant, only louder than before, and by that much more terrible.\nCymbals crashed. The music-box resumed its measured grinding of The\nMarseillaise. And the hundred began an Afridi sword dance, than which\nthere is nothing wilder in all the world. Its like can only be seen\nunder the shadow of the \"Hills.\"\n\nIsmail put his hands together and howled through them like a wolf on the\nwar-path, nudging King with an elbow. So King imitated him, although one\nextra shout in all that din seemed thrown away.\n\nThe dancers pranced in a circle, each man whirling both swords around\nhis head and the head of the man in front of him at a speed that passed\nbelief. Their long black hair shook and swayed. The sweat began to pour\nfrom them until their arms and shoulders glistened. The speed increased.\nAnother hundred men leaped in, forming a new ring outside the first,\nonly facing the other way. Another hundred and fifty formed a ring\noutside them again, with the direction again reversed; and two hundred\nand fifty more formed an outer circle--all careering at the limit of\ntheir power, gasping as the beasts do in the fury of fighting to the\ndeath, slitting the air until it whistled, with swords that missed human\nheads by immeasurable fractions of an inch.\n\nIsmail seemed obsessed by the spirit of hell let loose--drawn by it,\nas by a magnet, although subsequent events proved him not to have been\naltogether without a plan. He got up, with his eyes fixed on the dance,\nand dragged King with him to a place ten rows nearer the arena, that had\nbeen vacated by a dancer. There--two, where there was only rightly\nroom for one--he thrust himself and King next to some Orakzai Pathans,\nelbowing savagely to right and left to make room. And patience proved\nscarce. The instant oaths of anything but greeting were like overture to\na dog fight.\n\n\"Bismillah!\" swore the nearest man, deigning to use intelligible\nsentences at last. \"Shall a dog of an Afridi bustle me?\"\n\nHe reached for the ever-ready Pathan knife, and Ismail, with both eyes\non the dancing, neither heard nor saw. The Pathan leaned past King to\nstab, but paused in the instant that his knife licked clear. From a\nswift side-glance at King's face be changed to full stare, his scowl\nslowly giving place to a grin as he recognized him.\n\n\"Allah!\"\n\nHe drove the long blade back again, fidgeting about to make more room\nand kicking out at his next neighbor to the same end, so that presently\nKing sat on the rock floor instead of on other men's hip-bones.\n\n\"Well met, hakim! See--the wound heals finely!\"\n\nBaring his shoulder under the smelly sheepskin coat, he lifted a bandage\ngingerly to show the clean opening out of which King had coaxed a bullet\nthe day before. It looked wholesome and ready to heal.\n\n\"Name thy reward, hakim! We Orakzai Pathans forget no favors!\" (Now that\nboast was a true one.)\n\nKing glanced to his left and saw that there was no risk of being\noverheard or interrupted by Ismail; the Afridi was beating his fists\ntogether, rocking from side to side in frenzy, and letting out about one\nyell a minute that would have curdled a wolf's heart.\n\n\"Nay, I have all I need!\" he answered, and the Pathan laughed.\n\n\"In thine own time, hakim! Need forgets none of us!\"\n\n\"True!\" said King.\n\nHe nodded more to himself than to the other man. He needed, for\ninstance, very much to know who was planning a jihad, and who\n\"Bull-with-a-beard\" might be; but it was not safe to confide just yet in\na chance-made acquaintance. A very fair acquaintance with some phases of\nthe East had taught him that names such as Bull-with-a-beard are often\nalmost photographically descriptive. He rose to his feet to look. A\nblind man can talk, but it takes trained eyes to gather information.\n\nThe din had increased, and it was safe to stand up and stare, because\nall eyes were on the madness in the middle. There were plenty besides\nhimself who stood to get a better view, and he had to dodge from side to\nside to see between them.\n\n\"I'm not to doctor his men. Therefore it's a fair guess that he and\nI are to be kept apart. Therefore he'll be as far away from me now as\npossible, supposing he's here.\"\n\nReasoning along that line, he tried to see the face on the far side, but\nthe problem was to see over the dancers' heads. He succeeded presently,\nfor the Orakzai Pathan saw what he wanted, and in his anxiety to be\nagreeable, reached forward to pull back a box from between the ranks in\nfront.\n\nIts owners offered instant fight, but made no further objection when\nthey saw who wanted it and why. King wondered at their sudden change of\nmind, the Pathan looked actually grieved that a fight should have been\nspared him. He tried, with a few barbed insults, to rearouse a spark of\nenmity, but failed, to his own great discontent.\n\nThe box was a commonplace affair, built square, of pine, and had\nprobably contained somebody's new helmet at one stage of its career. The\nstenciled marks on its sides and top had long ago become obliterated by\nwear and dirt.\n\nKing got up on it and gazed long at the rows of spectators on the far\nside, and having no least notion what to look for, he studied the faces\none by one.\n\n\"If he's important enough for her to have it in for him, he'll not be\nfar from the front,\" he reasoned and with that in mind he picked out\nseveral bull-necked, bearded men, any one of whom could easily have\nanswered to the description. There were too many of them to give him any\ncomfort, until the thought occurred to him that a man with brains enough\nto be a leader would not be so obsessed and excited by mere prancing\nathleticism as those men were. Then he looked farther along the line.\n\nHe found a man soon who was not interested in the dancing, but who had\neyes and ears apparently for everything and everybody else. He watched\nhim for ten minutes, until at last their eyes met. Then he sat down and\nkicked the box back to its owners.\n\nHe looked again at Ismail. With teeth clenched and eyes ablaze, the\nAfridi was smashing his knuckles together and rocking to and fro.\nThere was no need to fear him. He turned and touched the Pathan's broad\nshoulder. The man smiled and bent his turbaned head to listen.\n\n\"Opposite,\" said King, \"nearly exactly opposite--three rows back from\nthe front, counting the front row as one--there sits a man with his arm\nin a sling and a bandage over his eye.\"\n\nThe Pathan nodded and touched his knife-hilt.\n\n\"One-and-twenty men from him, counting him as one, sits a man with a big\nblack beard, whose shoulders are like a bull's. As he sits he hangs his\nhead between them--thus.\"\n\n\"And you want him killed? Nay, I think you mean Muhammad Anim. His time\nis not yet.\"\n\nThe suggestion was as good-naturedly prompt as if the hakim's need had\nbeen water, and the other's flask were empty. He was sorry he could not\noffer to oblige.\n\n\"Who am I that I should want him killed?\" King answered with mild\nreproof. \"My trade is to heal, not slay. I am a hakim.\"\n\nThe other nodded.\n\n\"Yet, to enter Khinjan Caves you had to slay a man, hakim or no!\"\n\n\"He was an unbeliever,\" King answered modestly, and the other nodded\nagain with friendly understanding.\n\n\"What about the man yonder, then?\" the Pathan asked. \"What will you have\nof him?\"\n\n\"Look! See! Tell me truly what his name is!\"\n\nThe Pathan got up and strode forward to stand on the box, kicking aside\nthe elbows that leaned on it and laughing when the owners cursed him.\nHe stood on it and stared for five minutes, counting deliberately three\ntimes over, striking a finger on the palm of his hand to check himself.\n\n\"Bull-with-a-beard!\" he announced at last, dropping back into place\nbeside King. \"Muhammad Anim. The mullah Muhammad Anim.\"\n\n\"An Afghan?\" King asked.\n\n\"He says he is an Afghan. But unless he lies he is from Isbtamboul\n(Constantinople).\"\n\nItching to ask more questions, King sat still and held his peace. The\ndirer the need of information in the \"Hills,\" and in all the East\nfor that matter, the greater the wisdom, as a rule, of seeming\nuninquisitive. And wisdom was rewarded now, for the Pathan, who would\nhave dried up under eager questioning, grew talkative. Civility and\nvolubility are sometimes one, and not always only among the civilized.\nKing--the hakim Kurram Khan--blinked mildly behind his spectacles and\nlooked like one to whom a savage might safely ease his mind.\n\n\"He bade me go to Sikaram where my village is and bring him a hundred\nmen for his lashkar. He says he has her special favor. Wait and watch, I\nsay!\n\n\"Has he money?\" asked King, apparently drawing a bow at a venture for\nconversation's sake. But there is an art in asking artless questions.\n\n\"Aye! The liar says the Germans gave it to him! He swears they will send\nmore. Who are the Germans? Who is a man who talks of a jihad that is\nto be, that he should have gold coin given him by unbelievers? I saw a\nGerman once, at Nuklao. He ate pig-meat and washed it down with wine.\nAre such men sons of the Prophet? Wait and watch, say I!\"\n\n\"Money?\" said King. \"He admits it? And none dare kill him for it? You\nsay his time is not yet come?\"\n\nMore than ever it was obvious that the hakim was a very simple man. The\nPathan made a gesture of contempt.\n\n\"I dare what I will, hakim! But he says there is more money on the way!\nWhen he has it all--why--we are all in Allah's keeping--He decides!\"\n\n\"And should no more money come?\"\n\nThis was courteous conversation and received as such--many a long league\nremoved from curiosity.\n\n\"Who am I to foretell a man's kismet? I know what I know, and I think\nwhat I think! I know thee, hakim, for a gentle fellow, who hurt me\nalmost not at all in the drawing of a bullet out of my flesh. What\nknowest thou about me?\"\n\n\"That I will dress the wound for thee again!\"\n\nArtless statements are as useful in their way as artless questions. Let\nthe guile lie deep, that is all.\n\n\"Nay, nay! For she said nay! Shall I fall foul of her, for the sake of a\nnew bandage?\"\n\nThe temptation was terrific to ask why she had given that order, but\nKing resisted it; and presently it occurred to the Pathan that his own\ntheories on the subject might be of interest.\n\n\"She will use thee for a reward,\" he said. \"He who shall win and keep\nher favor may have his hurts dressed and his belly dosed. Her enemies\nmay rot.\"\n\n\"Who is fool enough to be her enemy?\" asked King, the altogether mild\nand guileless.\n\nThe Pathan stuck out his tongue and squeezed his nose with one finger\nuntil it nearly disappeared into his face.\n\n\"If she calls a man enemy, how shall he prove otherwise?\" he answered.\nThen he rolled off center, to pull out his great snuff-box from the\nleather bag at his waist.\n\n\"Does she call the mullah Muhammad Anim enemy?\" King asked him.\n\n\"Nay, she never mentions him by name.\"\n\n\"Art thou a man of thy word?\" King asked.\n\n\"When it suits me.\"\n\n\"There was a promise regarding my reward.\"\n\n\"Name it, hakim! We will see.\"\n\n\"Go tell the mullah Muhammad Anim where I sit!\"\n\nThe fellow laughed. He considered himself tricked; one could read that\nplainly enough; for taking polite messages does not come within the\nHills' elastic code of izzat, although carrying a challenge is another\nmatter. Yet he felt grateful for the hakim's service and was ready to\nseize the first cheap means of squaring the indebtedness.\n\n\"Keep my place!\" he ordered, getting up. He growled it, as some men\nspeak to dogs, because growling soothed his ruffled vanity.\n\nHe helped himself noisily to snuff then and began to clear a passage,\nkicking out to right and left and laughing when his victims protested.\nBefore he had traversed fifty yards he had made himself more enemies\nthan most men dare aspire to in a lifetime, and he seemed well pleased\nwith the fruit of his effort.\n\nThe dance went on for fifteen minutes yet, but then--quite\nunexpectedly--all the arena guards together fired a volley at the roof,\nand the dance stopped as if every dancer had been hit. The spectators\nwere set surging by the showers of stone splinters, that hurt whom they\nstruck, and their snarl was like a wolf-pack's when a tiger interferes.\nBut the guards thought it all a prodigious joke and the more the crowd\nswore the more they laughed.\n\nPanting--foaming at the mouth, some of them--the dancers ran to their\nseats and set the crowd surging again, leaving the arena empty of all\nbut the guards. The man whose seat Ismail had taken came staggering,\nslippery with sweat, and squeezed himself where he belonged, forcing\nKing into the Pathan's empty place. Ismail threw his arms round the man\nand patted him, calling him \"mighty dancer,\" \"son of the wind,\" \"prince\nof prancers,\" \"prince of swordsmen,\" \"war-horse,\" and a dozen more\nendearing epithets. The fellow lay back across Ismail's knees,\nbreathless but well enough contented.\n\nAnd after a few more minutes the Orakzai Pathan came back, and King\ntried to make room for him to sit.\n\n\"I bade thee keep my place!\" he growled, towering over King and plucking\nat his knife-belt irresolutely. He made it clear without troubling to\nuse words that any other man would have had to fight, and the hakim\nmight think himself lucky.\n\n\"Take my seat,\" said King, struggling to get up.\n\n\"Nay, nay--sit still, thou. I can kick room for myself. So! So! So!\"\n\nThere was an answering snarl of hate that seemed like a song to him,\namid which he sat down.\n\n\"The mullah Muhammad Anim answered he knows nothing of thee and cares\nless! He said--and he said it with vehemence--it is no more to him where\na hakim sits than where the rats hide!\"\n\nHe watched King's face and seeing that, King allowed his facial muscles\nto express chagrin.\n\n\"Between us, it is a poor time for messages to him. He is too full of\npride that his lashkar should have beaten the British.\"\n\n\"Did they beat the British greatly?\" King asked him, with only vague\ninterest on his face and a prayer inside him that his heart might\nflutter less violently against his ribs. His voice was as non-committal\nas the mullah's message.\n\n\"Who knows, when so many men would rather lie than kill? Each one who\nreturned swears he slew a hundred. But some did not return. Wait and\nwatch, say I!\"\n\nNow a man stood up near the edge of the crowd whom King recognized;\nand recognition brought no joy with it. The mullah without hair or\neyelashes, who had admitted him and his party through the mosque into\nthe Caves, strode out to the middle of the arena all alone, strutting\nand swaggering. He recalled the man's last words and drew no consolation\nfrom them, either.\n\n\"Many have entered! Some went out by a different road!\"\n\nCold chills went down his back. All at once Ismail's manner became\nunencouraging. He ceased to make a fuss over the dancer and began to eye\nKing sidewise, until at last he seemed unable to contain the malice that\nwould well forth.\n\n\"At the gate there were only words!\" he whispered. \"Here in this cavern\nmen wait for proof!\"\n\nHe licked his teeth suggestively, as a wolf does when he contemplates\na meal. Then, as an afterthought, as though ashamed, \"I love thee! Thou\nart a man after my own heart! But I am her man! Wait and see!\"\n\nThe mullah in the arena, blinking with his lashless eyes, held both\narms up for silence in the attitude of a Christian priest blessing\na congregation. The guards backed his silent demand with threatening\nrifles. The din died to a hiss of a thousand whispers, and then the\ngreat cavern grew still, and only the river could be heard sucking\nhungrily between the smooth stone banks.\n\n\"God is great!\" the mullah howled.\n\n\"God is great!\" the crowd thundered in echo to him; and then the vault\ntook up the echoes. \"God is great--is great--is great--ea--ea--eat!\"\n\n\"And Muhammad is His prophet!\" howled the mullah. Instantly they\nanswered him again.\n\n\"And Muhammad is His prophet!\"\n\n\"His prophet--is His prophet--is His prophet!\" said the stalactites, in\nloud barks--then in murmurs--then in awe-struck whispers.\n\nThat seemed to be all the religious ritual Khinjan remembered or could\ntolerate. Considering that the mullah, too, must have killed his man\nin cold blood before earning the right to be there, perhaps it was\nenough--too much. There were men not far from King who shuddered.\n\n\"There are strangers!\" announced the mullah, as a man might say, \"I\nsmell a rat!\" But he did not look at anybody in particular; he blinked\nat the crowd.\n\n\"Strangers!\" said the stalactites, in an awe-struck whisper.\n\n\"Show them! Show them! Let them stand forth!\"\n\n\"Oh-h-h-h-h! Let them stand forth!\" said the roof.\n\nThe mullah bowed as if that idea were a new one and he thought it better\nthan his own; for all crowds love flattery.\n\n\"Bring them!\" he shouted, and King suppressed a shudder--for what proof\nhad he of right to be there beyond Ismail's verbal corroboration of a\nlie? Would Ismail lie for him again? he wondered. And if so, would the\nlie be any use?\n\nNot far from where King sat there was an immediate disturbance in the\ncrowd, and a wretched-looking Baluchi was thrust forward at a run, with\narms lashed to his sides and a pitiful look of terror on his face. Two\nmore Baluchis were hustled along after him, protesting a little, but\nlooking almost as hopeless.\n\nOnce in the arena, the guards took charge of all three of them and lined\nthem up facing the mullah, clubbing them with their rifle-butts to\nget quick obedience. The crowd began to be noisy again, but the mullah\nsigned for silence.\n\n\"These are traitors!\" he howled, with a gesture such as Ajax might have\nused when he defied the lightning.\n\nThe roof said \"Traitors!\"\n\n\"Slay them, then!\" howled the crowd, delighted. And blinking behind the\nhorn-rimmed spectacles, King began to look about busily for hope, where\nthere did not seem to be any.\n\n\"Nay, hear me first!\" the mullah howled, and his voice was like a wolf's\nat hunting time. \"Hear, and be warned!\"\n\nThe crowd grew very still, but King saw that some men licked their lips,\nas if they well knew what was coming.\n\n\"These three men came, and one was a new man!\" the mullah howled. \"The\nother two were his witnesses! All three swore that the first man came\nfrom slaying an unbeliever in the teeth of written law. They said he ran\nfrom the law. So, as the custom is, I let all three enter!\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the crowd. \"Good!\" They might have been five thousand\njudges, judging in equity, so grave they were. Yet they licked their\nlips.\n\n\"But later, word came to me saying they are liars. So--again as the\ncustom is--I ordered them bound and held!\"\n\n\"Slay them! Slay them!\" the crowd yelped, gleeful as a wolf-pack on a\nscent and abandoning solemnity as suddenly as it had been assumed. \"Slay\nthem!\"\n\nThey were like the wind, whipping in and out among Khinjan's rocks,\nsavage and then still for a minute, savage and then still.\n\n\"Nay, there is a custom yet!\" the mullah howled, holding up both arms.\nAnd there was silence again like the lull before a hurricane, with only\nthe great black river talking to itself.\n\n\"Who speaks for them? Does any speak for them?\"\n\n\"Speak for them?\" said the roof.\n\nThere was silence. Then there was a murmur of astonishment. Over\nopposite to where King sat the mullah stood up, who the Pathan had said\nwas \"Bull-with-a-beard\"--Muhammad Anim.\n\n\"The men are mine!\" he growled. His voice was like a bear's at bay; it\nwas low, but it carried strangely. And as he spoke he swung his great\nhead between his shoulders, like a bear that means to charge. \"The proof\nthey brought has been stolen! They had good proof! I speak for them! The\nmen are mine!\"\n\nThe Pathan nudged King in the ribs with an elbow like a club and tickled\nhis ear with hot breath.\n\n\"Bull-with-a-beard speaks truth!\" he grinned. \"'Truth and a lie\ntogether! Good may it do him and them! They die, they three Baluchis!\"\n\n\"Proof!\" howled the mullah who had no hair eyelashes.\n\n\"Proof--oof--oof!\" said the stalactites.\n\n\"Proof! Show us proof!\" yelled the crowd.\n\n\"Words at the gate--proof in the cavern!\" howled the lashless one.\n\nThe Pathan next King leaned over to whisper to him again, but stiffened\nin the act. There was a great gasp the same instant, as the whole crowd\ncaught its breath all together. The mullah in the middle froze into\nmobility. Bull-with-a-beard stood mumbling, swaying his great head from\nside to side, no longer suggestive of a bear about to charge, but of one\nwho hesitates.\n\nThe crowd was staring at the end of the bridge. King stared, too, and\ncaught his own breath. For Yasmini stood there, smiling on them all as\nthe new moon smiles down on the Khyber! She had come among them like a\nspirit, all unheralded.\n\nSo much more beautiful than the one likeness King had seen of her that\nfor a second he doubted who she was--more lovely than he had imagined\nher even in his dreams--she stood there, human and warm and real, who\nhad begun to seem a myth, clad in gauzy transparent stuff that made no\nsecret of sylph-like shapeliness and looking nearly light enough to blow\naway. Her feet--and they were the most marvelously molded things he had\never seen--were naked and played restlessly on the naked stone. Not one\npart of her was still for a fraction of a second; yet the whole effect\nwas of insolently lazy ease.\n\nHer eyes blazed brighter than the little jewels stitched to her gossamer\ndress, and when a man once looked at them he did not find it easy to\nlook away again. Even mullah Muhammad Anim seemed transfixed, like a\ngreat foolish animal.\n\nBut King was staring very hard indeed at something else--mentally\ncursing the plain glass spectacles he wore, that had begun to film over\nand dim his vision. There were two bracelets on her arm, both barbaric\nthings of solid gold. The smaller of the two was on her wrist and the\nlarger on her upper arm, but they were so alike, except for size, and so\nexactly like the one Rewa Gunga had given him in her name and that had\nbeen stolen from him in the night, that he ran the risk of removing the\nglasses a moment to stare with unimpeded eyes. Even then the distance\nwas too great. He could not quite see.\n\nBut her eyes began to search the crowd in his direction, and then he\nknew two things absolutely. He was sitting where she had ordered Ismail\nto place him; for she picked him out almost instantly, and laughed as\nif somebody had struck a silver bell. And one of those bracelets was the\none that he had worn; for she flaunted it at him, moving her arm so that\nthe light should make the gold glitter.\n\nThen, perhaps because the crowd bad begun to whisper, and she wanted all\nattention, she raised both arms to toss back the golden hair that came\ncascading nearly to her knees. And as if the crowd knew that symptom\nwell, it drew its breath in sharply and grew very still.\n\n\"Muhammad Anim!\" she said, and she might have been wooing him. \"That was\na devil's trick!\"\n\nIt was rather an astounding statement, coming from lovely lips in such\na setting. It was rather suggestive of a driver's whiplash, flicked\nthrough the air for a beginning. Muhammad Anim continued glaring and did\nnot answer her, so in her own good time, when she had tossed her golden\nhair back once or twice again, she developed her meaning.\n\n\"We who are free of Khinjan Caves do not send men out to bring recruits.\nWe know better than to bid our men tell lies for others at the gate.\nNor, seeking proof for our new recruit, do we send men to hunt a head\nfor him--not even those of us who have a lashkar that we call our own,\nmullah Muhammad Anim. Each of us earns his own way in!\"\n\nThe mullah Muhammad Anim began to stroke his beard, but he made no\nanswer.\n\n\"And--mullah Muhammad Anim, thou wandering man of God--when that lashkar\nhas foolishly been sent and has failed, is it written in the Kalamullah\nsaying we should pretend there was a head, and that the head was stolen?\nA lie is a lie, Muhammad Anim! Wandering perhaps is good, if in search\nof the way. Is it good to lose the way, and to lie, thou true follower\nof the Prophet?\"\n\nShe smiled, tossing her hair back. Her eyes challenged, her lips mocked\nhim and her chin scorned. The crowd breathed hard and watched. The\nmullah muttered something in his beard, and sat down, and the crowd\nbegan to roar applause at her. But she checked it with a regal gesture,\nand a glance of contempt at the mullah that was alone worth a journey\nacross the \"Hills\" to see.\n\n\"Guards!\" she said quietly. And the crowd's sigh then was like the night\nwind in a forest.\n\n\"Away with those three of Muhammad Anim's men!\"\n\nTwelve of the arena guards threw down their shields with a sudden\nclatter and seized the prisoners, four to each. The crowd shivered with\ndelicious anticipation. The doomed men neither struggled nor cried,\nfor fatalism is an anodyne as well as an explosive. King set his teeth.\nYasmini, with both hands behind her head, continued to smile down on\nthem all as sweetly as the stars shine on a battle-field.\n\nShe nodded once; and then all was over in a minute. With a ringing \"Ho!\"\nand a run, the guards lifted their victims shoulder high and bore them\nforward. At the river bank they paused for a second to swing them. Then,\nwith another \"Ho!\" they threw them like dead rubbish into the swift\nblack water.\n\nThere was only one wild scream that went echoing and re-echoing to the\nroof. There was scarcely a splash, and no extra ripple at all. No heads\ncame up again to gasp. No fingers clutched at the surface. The fearful\nspeed of the river sucked them under, to grind and churn and pound them\nthrough long caverns underground and hurl them at last over the great\ncataract toward the middle of the world.\n\n\"Ah-h-h-h-h!\" sighed the crowd in ecstasy.\n\n\"Is there no other stranger?\" asked Yasmini, searching for King again\nwith her amazing eyes. The skin all down his back turned there and then\ninto gooseflesh. And as her eyes met his she laughed like a bell at him.\nShe knew! She knew who he was, how he had entered, and how he felt. Not\na doubt of it!\n\n\n\n\nChapter XI\n\n\n     Long slept the Heart o' the Hills, oh, long!\n     (Ye who have watched, ye know!)\n     As sap sleeps in the deodars\n     When winter shrieks and steely stars\n     Blink over frozen snow.\n     Ye haste? The sap stirs now, ye say?\n     Ye feel the pulse of spring?\n     But sap must rise ere buds may break,\n     Or cubs fare forth, or bees awake,\n     Or lean buck spurn the ling!\n\n\n\"Kurram Khan!\" the lashless mullah howled, like a lone wolf in the\nmoonlight, and King stood up.\n\nIt is one of the laws of Cocker, who wrote the S. S. Code, that a man\nis alive until he is proved dead, and where there is life there is\nopportunity. In that grim minute King felt heretical; but a man's\nfeelings are his own affair provided he can prove it, and he managed to\nseem about as much at ease as a native hakim ought to feel at such an\ninitiation.\n\n\"Come forward!\" the mullah howled, and he obeyed, treading gingerly\nbetween men who were at no pains to let him by, and silently blessing\nthem, because he was not really in any hurry at all. Yasmini looked\nlovely from a distance, and life was sweet.\n\n\"Who are his witnesses?\"\n\n\"Witnesses?\" the roof hissed.\n\n\"I!\" shouted Ismail, jumping up.\n\n\"I!\" cracked the roof. \"I! I!\" So that for a second King almost believed\nhe had a crowd of men to swear for him and did not hear Darya Khan at\nall, who rose from a place not very far behind where had sat.\n\nIsmail followed him in a hurry, like a man wading a river with loose\nclothes gathered in one arm and the other arm ready in case of falling.\nHe took much less trouble than King not to tread on people, and oaths'\nmarked his wake.\n\nDarya Khan did not go so fast. As he forced his way forward a man passed\nhim up the wooden box that King had used to stand on; he seized it in\nboth hands with a grin and a jest and went to stand behind King and\nIsmail, in line with the lashless mullah, facing Yasmini. Yasmini smiled\nat them all as if they were actors in her comedy, and she well pleased\nwith them.\n\n\"Look ye!\" howled the mullah. \"Look ye and look well, for this is to be\none of us!\"\n\nKing felt ten thousand eyes burn holes in his back, but the one pair of\neyes that mocked him from the bridge was more disconcerting.\n\n\"Turn, Kurram Khan! Turn that all may see!\"\n\nFeeling like a man on a spit, he revolved slowly. By the time he had\nturned once completely around, besides knowing positively that one of\nthe two bracelets on her right arm was the one he had worn, or else its\nexact copy, he knew that he was not meant to die yet; for his eyes could\nwork much more swiftly than the horn-rimmed spectacles made believe. He\ndecided that Yasmini meant he should be frightened, but not much hurt\njust yet.\n\nSo he ceased altogether to feel frightened and took care to look more\nscared than ever.\n\n\"Who paid the price of thy admission?\" the mullah howled, and King\ncleared his throat, for he was not quite sure yet what that might mean.\n\n\"Speak, Kurram Khan!\" Yasmini purred, smiling her loveliest. \"Tell them\nwhom you slew.\"\n\nKing turned and faced the crowd, raising himself on the balls of his\nfeet to shout, like a man facing thousands of troops on parade. He\nnearly gave himself away, for habit had him unawares. A native hakim,\ngiven the stoutest lungs in all India, would not have shouted in that\nway.\n\n\"Cappitin Attleystan King!\" he roared. And he nearly jumped out of\nhis skin when his own voice came rattling back at him from the roof\noverhead.\n\n\"Cappitin Attleystan King!\" it answered.\n\nYasmini chuckled as a little rill will sometimes chuckle among ferns. It\nwas devilish. It seemed to say there were traps not far ahead.\n\n\"Where was he slain?\" asked the mullah.\n\n\"In the Khyber Pass,\" said King.\n\n\"In the Khyber Pass!\" the roof whispered hoarsely, as if aghast at such\ncold-bloodedness.\n\n\"Now give proof!\" said the mullah. \"Words at the gate--proof in the\ncavern! Without good proof, there is only one way out of here!\"\n\n\"Proof!\" the crowd thundered. \"Proof!\"\n\n\"Proof! Proof! Proof!\" the roof echoed.\n\nThere was no need for Darya Khan to whisper. King's hands were behind\nhim, and he had seen what he had seen and guessed what he had guessed\nwhile he was turning to let the crowd look at him. His fingers closed on\nhuman hair.\n\n\"Nay, it is short!\" hissed Darya Khan. \"Take the two ears, or hold it by\nthe jawbone! Hold it high in both hands!\"\n\nKing obeyed, without looking at the thing, and Ismail, turning to face\nthe crowd, rose on tiptoe and filled his lungs for the effort of his\nlife.\n\n\"The head of Cappitin Attleystan King--infidel kaffir--British\narrficer!\" he howled.\n\n\"Good!\" the crowd bellowed. \"Good! Throw it!\"\n\nThe crowd's roar and the roof's echoes combined until pandemonium.\n\n\"Throw it to them, Kurram Khan!\" Yasmini purred from the bridge end,\nspeaking as softly and as sweetly, as if she coaxed a child. Yet her\nvoice carried.\n\nHe lowered the head, but instead of looking at it he looked up at her.\nHe thought she was enjoying herself and his predicament as he had never\nseen any one enjoy anything.\n\n\"Throw it to them, Kurram Khan!\" she purred. \"It is the custom!\"\n\n\"Throw it! Throw it!\" the crowd thundered.\n\nHe turned the ghastly thing until it lay face-upward in his hands, and\nso at last he saw it. He caught his breath, and only the horn-rimmed\nspectacles, that he had cursed twice that night, saved him from\nself-betrayal. The cavern seemed to sway, but he recovered and his wits\nworked swiftly. If Yasmini detected his nervousness she gave no sign.\n\n\"Throw it! Throw it! Throw it!\"\n\nThe crowd was growing impatient. Many men were standing, waving their\narms to draw attention to themselves, and he wondered what the ultimate\nend of the head would be, if he obeyed and threw it to them. Watching\nYasmini's eyes, he knew it had not entered her head that he might\ndisobey.\n\nHe looked past her toward the river. There were no guards near enough to\nprevent what he intended; but he had to bear in mind that the guards\nhad rifles, and if he acted too suddenly one of them might shoot at him\nunbidden. They were wondrous free with their cartridges, those guards,\nin a land where ammunition is worth its weight in silver coin.\n\nHolding the head before him with both hands, he began to walk toward the\nriver, edging all the while a little toward the crowd as if meaning to\nget nearer before he threw.\n\nHe was much more than half-way to the river's edge before Yasmini or\nanybody else divined his true intention. The mullah grew suspicions\nfirst and yelled. Then King hurried, for he did not believe Yasmini\nwould need many seconds in which to regain command of any situation. But\nshe saw fit to stand still and watch.\n\nHe reached the river and stood there. Now he was in no hurry at all, for\nit stood to reason that unless Yasmini very much desired him to be kept\nalive he would have been shot dead already. For a moment the crowd was\nso interested that it forgot to bark and snarl.\n\nHis next move was as deliberate as he could make it, although he was\ncareful to avoid the least suggestion of mummery (for then the crowd\nwould have suspected disloyalty to Islam, and the \"Hills\" are very, very\npious, and very suspicious of all foreign ritual).\n\nHe did a thoughtful simple thing that made every savage who watched him\ngasp because of its very unexpectedness. He held the head in both\nhands, threw it far out into the river and stood to watch it sink. Then,\nwithout visible emotion of any kind, he walked back stolidly to face\nYasmini at the bridge end, with shoulders a little more stubborn now\nthan they ought to be, and chin a shade too high, for there never was a\nman who could act quite perfectly.\n\n\"Thou fool!\" Yasmini whispered through lips that did not move.\n\nShe betrayed a flash of temper like a trapped she-tiger's, but followed\nit instantly with her loveliest smile. Like to like, however, the crowd\nsaw the flash of temper and took its cue from that.\n\n\"Slay him!\" yelled a lone voice, that was greeted an approving murmur.\n\n\"Slay him!\" advised the roof in a whisper, in one of its phonetic\ntricks.\n\n\"This is a darbar!\" Yasmini announced in a rising, ringing voice. \"My\ndarbar, for I summoned it! Did I invite any man to speak?\"\n\nThere was silence, as a whipped unwilling pack is silent.\n\n\"Speak, thou, Kurram Khan!\" she said. \"Knowing the custom--having heard\nthe order to throw that trophy to them--why act otherwise? Explain!\"\n\nNothing in the wide world could be fairer! She left him to extricate\nhimself from a mess of his own making! It was more than fair, for she\nwent out of her way to offer him an opening to jump through. And she\npaid him the compliment of suggesting be must be clever enough to take\nit, for she seemed to expect a satisfying answer.\n\n\"Tell them why!\" she said, smiling. No man could have guessed by the\ntone of her voice whether she was for him or against him, and the crowd,\nbeginning again to whisper, watched to see which way the cat would jump.\n\nHe bowed low to her three times--very low indeed and very slowly, for he\nhad to think. Then he turned his back and repeated the obeisance to the\ncrowd. Still he could think of no excuse, except Cocker's Rule No. I for\nTight Places, and all the world knows that because Solomon said much the\nsame thing first:\n\n\"A soft answer is better than a sword!\"\n\nBut Cocker adds, \"Never excuse. Explain! And blame no man.\"\n\n\"My brothers,\" he said, and paused, since a man must make a beginning,\neven when he can not see the end. And as he spoke the answer came to\nhim. He stood upright, and his voice became that of a man whose advice\nhas been asked, and who gives it freely. \"These be stirring times! Ye\nneed take care, my brothers! Ye saw this night how one man entered here\non the strength of an oath and a promise. All he lacked was proof. And I\nhad proof. Ye saw! Who am I that I should deny you a custom? Yet--think\nye, my brothers!--how easy would it not have been, had I thrown that\nhead to you, for a traitor to catch it and hide it in his clothes,\nand make away with it! He could have used it to admit to these\ncaves--why--even an Englishman, my brothers! If that had happened, ye\nwould have blamed me!\"\n\nYasmini smiled. Taking its cue from her, the crowd murmured, scarcely\nassent, but rather recognition of the hakim's adroitness. The game\nwas not won; there lacked a touch to tip the scales in his favor, and\nYasmini supplied it with ready genius.\n\n\"The hakim speaks truth!\" she laughed.\n\nKing turned about instantly to face her, but he salaamed so low that she\ncould not have seen his expression had she tried.\n\n\"If Ye wish it, I will order him tossed into Earth's Drink after those\nother three.\"\n\nMuhammed Anim rose stroking his beard and rocking where he stood.\n\n\"It is the law!\" he growled, and King shuddered.\n\n\"It is the law,\" Yasmini answered in a voice that rang with pride and\ninsolence, \"that none interrupt me while I speak! For such ill-mannered\nones Earth's Drink hungers! Will you test my authority, Muhammad Anim?\"\n\nThe mullah sat down, and hundreds of men laughed at him, but not all of\nthe men by any means.\n\n\"It is the law that none goes out of Khinjan Cave alive who breaks the\nlaw of the Caves. But he broke no very big law. And he spoke truth.\nThink Ye! If that head had only fallen into Muhammad Anim's lap, the\nmullah might have smuggled in another man with it!\"\n\nA roar of laughter greeted that thrust. Many men who had not laughed at\nthe mullah's first discomfiture, joined in now. Muhammad Anim sat and\nfidgeted, meeting nobody's eye and answering nothing.\n\n\"So it seems to me good,\" Yasmini said, in a voice that did not echo any\nmore but rang very clear and true (she seemed to know the trick of the\nroof, and to use the echo or not as she chose), \"to let this hakim live!\nHe shall meditate in his cave a while, and perhaps he shall be beaten,\nlest he dare offend again. He can no more escape from Khinjan Caves than\nthe women who are prisoners here. He may therefore live!\"\n\nThere was utter silence. Men looked at one another and at her, and her\nblazing eyes searched the crowd swiftly. It was plain enough that there\nwere at least two parties there, and that none dared oppose Yasmini's\nwill for fear of the others.\n\n\"To thy seat, Kurram Khan!\" she ordered, when she had waited a full\nminute and no man spoke.\n\nHe wasted no time. He hurried out of the arena as fast as he could walk,\nwith Ismail and Darya Khan close at his heels. It was like a run out of\ndanger in a dream. He stumbled over the legs of the front-rank men in\nhis hurry to get back to his place, and Ismail overtook him, seized him\nby the shoulders, hugged him, and dragged him to the empty seat next to\nthe Orakzai Pathan. There he hugged him until his ribs cracked.\n\n\"Ready o' wit!\" he crowed. \"Ready o' tongue! Light o' life! Man after\nmine own heart! Hey, I love thee! Readily I would be thy man, but for\nbeing hers! Would I had a son like thee! Fool--fool--fool not to throw\nthe head to them! Squeamish one! Man like a child! What is the head\nbut earth when the life has left it? What would thy head be without the\nnimble wit? Fool--fool--fool! And clever! Turned the joke on Muhammad\nAnim! Turned it on Bull-with-a-beard in a twinkling--in the bat of an\neye--in a breath! Turned it against her enemy and raised a laugh against\nhim from his own men! Ready o' wit! Shameless one! Lucky one! Allah was\nsurely good to thee!\"\n\nStill exulting, he let go, but none too soon for comfort. King's ribs\nwere sore from his hugging for days.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked. For King seemed to be shaping words with his\nlips. He bent a great hairy ear to listen.\n\n\"Have they taken Ali Masjid Fort?\" King whispered.\n\n\"How should I know? Why?\"\n\n\"Tell me, man, if you love me! Have they taken it?\"\n\n\"Nay, how should I know? Ask her! She knows more than any man knows!\"\n\nKing turned to ask the same question of his friend the Orakzai Pathan;\nbut the Pathan would have none of his questions, he was busy listening\nfor whispers from the crowd, watching with both eyes, and he shoved King\naside.\n\nThe crowd was very far from being satisfied. An angry murmur had begun\nto fill the cavern as a hive is filled with the song of bees at swarming\ntime. But even so, surmise what one might, it was not easy to persuade\nthe eye that Yasmini's careless smile and easy poise were assumed.\nIf she recognized indignation and feared it, she disguised her fear\namazingly.\n\nKing saw her whisper to a guard. The fellow nodded and passed his shield\nto another man. He began to make his way in no great hurry toward the\nedge of the arena. She whispered again and standing forward with their\ntrumpets seven of the guards blew a blast that split across the cavern\nlike the trump of doom; and as its hundred thousand echoes died in the\nroof, the hum of voices died, too, and the very sound of breathing. The\ngurgling of water became as if the river flowed in solitude.\n\nLeisurely then, languidly, she raised both arms until she looked like an\nangel poised for flight. The little jewels stitched to her gauzy dress\ntwinkled like fire-flies as she moved. The crowd gasped sharply. She had\nit by the heart-strings.\n\nShe called, and four guards got under one shield, bowing their heads and\nresting the great rim on their shoulders. They carried it beneath her\nand stood still. With a low delicious laugh, sweet and true, she sprang\non it, and the shield scarcely trembled; she seemed lighter than the\nsilk her dress was woven from!\n\nThey carried her so, looking as if she and the shield were carved of a\npiece, and by a master such as has not often been. And in the midst of\nthe arena before they had ceased moving she began to sing, with her head\nthrown back and bosom swelling like a bird's.\n\nThe East would ever rather draw its own conclusions from a hint let fall\nthan be puzzled by what the West believes are facts. And parables are\nnot good evidence in courts of law, which is always a consideration. So\nher song took the form of a parable.\n\nAnd to say that she took hold of them and played rhapsodies of her own\nmaking on their heart-strings would be to undervalue what she did. They\nwere dumb while she sang, but they rose at her. Not a force in the\nworld could have kept them down, for she was deftly touching cords that\nstirred other forces--subtle, mysterious, mesmeric, which the old East\nunderstands--which Muhammad the Prophet understood when he harnessed\nevil in the shafts with men and wrote rules for their driving in a book.\nThey rose in silence and stood tense.\n\nWhile she sang, the guard to whom she had whispered forced a way through\nthe ranks of the standing crowd, and came behind Ismail. He tweaked\nthe Afridi's ear to draw attention, for like all the others--like King,\ntoo--Ismail was listening with dropped jaw and watching with burning\neyes. For a minute they whispered, so low that King did not hear what\nthey said; and then the guard forced his way back by the shortest route\nto the arena, knocking down half a dozen men and gaining safety beyond\nthe lamps before his victims could draw knife and follow him.\n\nYasmini's song went on, verse after verse, telling never one fact, yet\nhinting unutterable things in a language that was made for hint and\nmetaphor and parable and innuendo. What tongue did not hint at was\nconveyed by subtle gesture and a smile and flashing eyes. It was\nperfectly evident that she knew more than King--more than the general at\nPeshawur--more than the viceroy at Simla--probably more than the British\ngovernment--concerning what was about to happen in Islam. The others\nmight guess. She knew. It was just as evident that she would not tell.\nThe whole of her song, and it took her twenty minutes by the count of\nKing's pulse, to sing it, was a warning to wait and a promise of amazing\nthings to come.\n\nShe sang of a wolf-pack gathering from the valleys in the winter snow--a\nvery hungry wolf-pack. Then of a stalled ox, grown very fat from being\ncared for. Of the \"Heart of the Hills\" that awoke in the womb of the\n\"Hills,\" and that listened and watched.\n\n\"Now, is she the 'Heart of the Hills'?\" King wondered. The rumors men\nhad heard and told again in India, about the \"Heart of the Hills\" in\nKhinjan seemed to have foundation.\n\nHe thought of the strange knife, wrapped in a handkerchief under his\nshirt, with its bronze blade and gold hilt in the shape of a woman\ndancing. The woman dancing was astonishingly like Yasmini, standing on\nthe shield!\n\nShe sang about the owners of the stalled ox, who were busy at bay,\ndefending themselves and their ox from another wolf-pack in another\ndirection \"far beyond.\"\n\nShe urged them to wait a little while. The ox was big enough and fat\nenough to nourish all the wolves in the world for many seasons. Let\nthem wait, then, until another, greater wolf-pack joined them, that they\nmight go hunting all together, overwhelm its present owners and devour\nthe ox! So urged the \"Heart of the Hills,\" speaking to the mountain\nwolves, according to Yasmini's song.\n\n        \"The little cubs in the burrows know.\n        Are ye grown wolves, who hurry so?\"\n\nShe paused, for effect; but they gave tongue then because they could not\nhelp it, and the cavern shook to their terrific worship.\n\n\"Allah! Allah!\"\n\nThey summoned God to come and see the height and depth and weight of\ntheir allegiance to her! And because for their thunder there was no more\nchance of being heard, she dropped from the shield like a blossom. No\nsound of falling could have been heard in all that din, but one could\nsee she made no sound. The shield-bearers ran back to the bridge and\nstood below it, eyes agape.\n\nRewa Gunga spoke truth in Delhi when he assured King he should some day\nwonder at Yasmini's dancing.\n\nShe became joy and bravery and youth! She danced a story for them of the\nthings they knew. She was the dawn light, touching the distant peaks.\nShe was the wind that follows it, sweeping among the junipers and\nkissing each as she came. She was laughter, as the little children\nlaugh when the cattle are loosed from the byres at last to feed in the\nvalleys. She was the scent of spring uprising. She was blossom. She was\nfruit! Very daughter of the sparkle of warm sun on snow, she was the\n\"Heart of the Hills\" herself!\n\nNever was such dancing! Never such an audience! Never such mad applause!\nShe danced until the great rough guards had to run round the arena with\nclubbed butts and beat back trespassers who would have mobbed her. And\nevery movement--every gracious wonder-curve and step with which she\ntold her tale was as purely Greek as the handle on King's knife and the\nfigures on the lamp-bowls and as the bracelets on her arm. Greek!\n\nAnd she half-modern-Russian, ex-girl-wife of a semi-civilized\nHill-rajah! Who taught her? There is nothing new, even in Khinjan, in the\n\"Hills\"!\n\nAnd when the crowd defeated the arena guards at last and burst through\nthe swinging butts to seize and fling her high and worship her with\nmad barbaric rite, she ran toward the shield. The four men raised it\nshoulder-high again. She went to it like a leaf in the wind--sprang on\nit as if wings had lifted her, scarce touching it with naked toes--and\nleapt to the bridge with a laugh.\n\nShe went over the bridge on tiptoes, like nothing else under heaven but\nYasmini at her bewitchingest. And without pausing on the far side she\ndanced up the hewn stone stairs, dived into the dark hole and was gone!\n\n\"Come!\" yelled Ismail in King's ear. He could have heard nothing less,\nfor the cavern was like to burst apart from the tumult.\n\n\"Whither?\" the Afridi shouted in disgust. \"Does the wind ask whither?\nCome like the wind and see! They will remember next that they have a\nbone to pick with thee! Come away!\"\n\nThat seemed good enough advice. He followed as fast as Ismail could\nshoulder a way out between the frantic Hillmen, deafened, stupefied,\nnumbed, almost cowed by the ovation they were giving their \"Heart of\ntheir Hills.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XII\n\n\n\n     A scorpion in a corner stings himself to death.\n     A coward blames the gods. They laugh and let him die\n     A man goes forward\n     --Native Proverb\n\n\nAs they disappeared after a scramble through the mouth of the same\ntunnel they had entered by, a roar went up behind them like the birth of\nearthquakes. Looking back over his shoulder, King saw Yasmini come back\ninto the hole's mouth, to stand framed in it and bow acknowledgment.\nShe looked so ravishing in contrast to the huge grim wall, and the black\nriver, and the darkness at her back, that Khinjan's thousands tried to\nstorm the bridge and drag her down to them. The guards were hard put to\nit, with their backs to the bridge end, for two or three minutes.\n\nBut Ismail would not let him wait and watch from there. He dragged him\ndown the tunnel and pushed him up on to a ledge where they could both\nsee without being seen, through a fissure in the rock.\n\nFor the space of five minutes Yasmini stood in the great hole, smiling\nand watching the struggle below. Then she went, and the guards began to\nget the best of it, because the crowd's enthusiasm waned when they could\nsee her no more. Then suddenly the guards began to loose random volleys\nat the roof and brought down hundredweights of splintered stalactite.\n\nWithin a minute there were a hundred men busy on sweeping up the\nsplinters. In another minute twenty Zakka Khels had begun a sword dance,\nyelling like the damned. A hundred joined them. In three minutes more\nthe whole arena was a dinning whirlpool, and the river's voice was\ndrowned in shouting and the stamping of naked feet on stone.\n\n\"Come!\" urged Ismail, and led the way.\n\nKing's last impression was of earth's womb on fire and of hellions\nbrewing wrath. The stalactites and the hurrying river multiplied the\ndancing lights into a million, and the great roof hurled the din down\nagain to make confusion with the new din coming up.\n\nIsmail went like a rat down a run, and King failed to overtake him until\nhe found him in the cave of the slippers kicking to right and left at\nrandom.\n\n\"Choose a good pair!\" he growled. \"Let late-comers fight for what is\nleft! Nay, I have thine! Choose thou the next best!\"\n\nThe statement being one of fact, and that no time or place for a quarrel\nwith the only friend in sight, King picked out the best slippers he\ncould see. The instant he had them on Ismail was off again, running like\nthe wind.\n\nThey had no torch. They left the little tunnel lamps behind. It became\nso dark that King had to follow by ear, and so it happened that he\nmissed seeing where the tunnel forked. He imagined they were running\nback toward the ledge under the waterfall; yet, when Ismail called a\nhalt at last, panting, groped behind a great rock for a lamp and lit the\nwick with a common safety match, they were in a cave he had never seen\nbefore.\n\n\"Where are we?\" King asked.\n\n\"Where none dare seek us.\"\n\nIsmail held the lamp high, shielding its wick with a hollowed palm and\npeering about him as if in doubt, his ragged beard looking like smoke in\nthe wind; for a wind blew down all the passages in Khinjan.\n\nKing examined the lamp. It was of bronze and almost as surely ancient\nGreek as it surely was not Indian. There were figures graven on the bowl\nrepresenting a woman dancing, who looked not unlike Yasmini; but before\nhe had time to look very closely Ismail blew the lamp out and was off\nagain, like a shadow shot into its mother night.\n\nConfused by the sudden darkness King crashed into a rock as he tried to\nfollow. Ismail turned back and gave him the end of a cotton girdle that\nhe unwound from his waist; then he plunged ahead again into Cimmerian\nblackness, down a passage so narrow that they could touch a wall with\neither hand.\n\nOnce he shouted back to duck, and they passed tinder a low roof where\nwater dripped on them, and the rock underfoot was the bed of a shallow\nstream. After that the track began to rise, and the grade grew so steep\nthat even Ismail, the furious, had to slacken pace.\n\nThey began to climb up titanic stairways all in the dark, feeling their\nway through fissures in a mountain's framework, up zigzag ledges, and\nover great broken lumps of rock from one cave to another; until at last\nin one great cave Ismail stopped and relit the lamp. Hunting about with\nits aid he found an imported \"hurricane\" lantern and lit that, leaving\nthe bronze lamp in its place.\n\nSoon after that they lost sight of walls to their left for a time,\nalthough there were no stars, nor any light to suggest the outer\nworld--nothing but wind. The wind blew a hurricane.\n\nTheir path now was a very narrow ledge formed by a crack that ran\ndiagonally down the face of a black cliff on their right. They hugged\nthe stone because of a sense of fathomless space above--below--on every\nside but one. The rock wall was the one thing tangible, and the footing\nthe crack in it afforded was the gift of God.\n\nThe moaning wind rose to a shriek at intervals and made their clothes\nflutter like ghosts' shrouds, and in spite of it King's shirt was\ndrenched with sweat, and his fingers ached from clinging as if they were\non fire. Crawling against the wind along a wider ledge at the top, they\ncame to a chasm, crossed by a foot-wide causeway. The wind bowled and\nmoaned in it, and the futile lantern rays only suggested unimaginable,\nthings--death the least of them.\n\n\"Art thou afraid?\" asked Ismail, holding the lantern to King's face.\n\n\"Kuch dar nahin hai!\" he answered. \"There is no such thing as fear!\"\n\nIt was a bold answer, and Ismail laughed, knowing well that neither of\nthem believed a word of it at that moment. Only, each thought better\nof the other, that the one should have cared to ask, and that the other\nshould be willing to give the lie to a fear that crawled and could be\nfelt. Too many men are willing to admit they are afraid. Too many would\nrather condemn and despise than ask and laugh. But it is on the edges of\neternity that men find each other out, and sympathize.\n\nIsmail went down on his hands and knees, lifting the lantern along a\nfoot at a time in front of him and carrying it in his teeth by the bail\nthe last part of the way. It seemed like an hour before he stood up,\nnearly a hundred yards away on the far side, and yelled for King to\nfollow.\n\nThe wind snatched the yells away, but the waving lantern beckoned him,\nand King knelt down in the dark. It happened that he laid his hand on a\nloose stone, the size of his head, near the edge. He shoved it over and\nlistened. He listened for a minute but did not hear it strike anything,\nand the shudder, that he could not repress, came from the middle of his\nbackbone and spread outward through each fiber of his being. If he had\ndelayed another second his courage would have failed; he began at once\nto crawl to where Ismail stood swinging the light.\n\nThere was room on the ledge for his knees and no more. Toes and fingers\nwere overside. He sat down as on horseback, and transferred both\nslippers to his pockets, and then went forward again with bare feet,\nwaiting whenever the wind snatched at him with redoubled fury, to lean\nagainst it and grip the rock with numb fingers. Ismail swung the lamp,\nfor reasons best known to himself, and half-way over King sat astride\nthe ridge again to shout to him to hold it still. But Ismail did not\nunderstand him.\n\n\"Khinjan graves are deep!\" he howled back. \"Fear and the shadow of death\nare one!\"\n\nHe swung the lamp even more violently, as if it were a charm that could\nexorcise fear and bring a man over safely. The shadows danced until\nhis brain reeled, and King swore he would thrash the fool as soon as he\ncould reach him. He lay belly-downward on the rock and crawled like an\ninsect the remainder of the way.\n\nAnd as if aware of his intention Ismail started to hurry on while\nthere was yet a yard or two to crawl, and anger not being a load worth\ncarrying, nor revenge a thing permitted to interfere with the sirkar's\nbusiness, King let both die.\n\nHunted by the wind, they ran round a bold shoulder of cliff into another\nblack-dark tunnel. There the wind died, swallowed in a hundred fissures,\nbut the track grew worse and steeper until they had to cling with both\nhands and climb and now and then Ismail set the lantern on a ledge\nand lowered his girdle to help King up. Sometimes he stood on King's\nshoulder in order to reach a higher level. They climbed for an hour and\ndropped at last panting, on a ledge, after squeezing themselves under\nthe corner of a boulder.\n\nThe lantern light shone on a tiny trickle of cold water, and there\nIsmail drank deep, like a bull, before signing to King to imitate him.\n\n\"A thirsty throat and a crazy head are one,\" he counseled. \"A man needs\nwit and a wet tongue who would talk with her!\"\n\n\"Where is she?\" asked King, when he had finished drinking.\n\n\"Go and look!\"\n\nIsmail gave him a sudden shove, that sent him feet first forward over\nthe edge. He fell a distance rather greater than his own height,\nto another ledge and stood there looking up. He could see Ismail's\nred-rimmed eyes blinking down at him in the lantern light, but suddenly\nthe Afridi blew the lamp out, and then the darkness became solid.\nThought itself left off less than a yard away.\n\n\"Ismail!\" he whispered. But Ismail did not answer him.\n\nHe faced about, leaning against the rock, with the flat of both bands\npressed tight against it for the sake of its company; and almost at once\nhe saw a little bright red light glowing in the distance. It might have\nbeen a hundred yards, and it might have been a mile away below him; it\nwas perfectly impossible to judge, for the darkness was not measurable.\n\n\"Flowers turn to the light!\" droned Ismail's voice above sententiously,\nand turning, he thought he could see red eyes peering over the rock. He\njumped, and made a grab for the flowing beard that surely must be below\nthem, but he missed.\n\n\"Little fish swim to the light!\" droned Ismail. \"Moths fly to the light!\nWho is a man that he should know less than they?\"\n\nHe turned again and stared at the light. Dimly, very vaguely be could\nmake out that a causeway led downward from almost where he stood. He was\nconvinced that should he try to climb back Ismail would merely reach out\na hand and shove him down again, and there was no sense in being put to\nthat indignity. He decided to go forward, for there was even less sense\nin standing still.\n\n\"Come with me! Come along, Ismail!\" he called.\n\n\"Allah! Hear him! Nay, nay, nay! Who was it said a little while ago,\n'There is no such thing as fear!' I am afraid, but thou and I are two\nmen! Go thou alone!\"\n\nReason is a man's only dependable faculty. Reason told him that at a\nword from Yasmini he would have been flung into \"Earth's Drink\" hours\nago. Therefore, added reason, why should she forego that spectacular\nopportunity when his death would have amused Khinjan's thousands, only\nto kill him now in the dark alone? He had treated a few dozen sick men,\nsurely she had not been afraid to offend them. Had she not dared forbid\nthe sick coming to him altogether? \"Forward!\" says Cocker, in at least a\ndozen places. \"Go forward and find out! Better a bed in hell than a seat\non the horns of a dilemma! Forward!\"\n\nThere was no sound now anywhere. He stretched a leg downward and felt\na rock two or three feet lower down, and the sound of his slipper sole\ntouching it, being the only noise, made the short hair rise on the back\nof his neck. Then he took himself, so to speak, by the hand and went\nforward and downward, for action is the only curb imagination knows.\n\nHe forgot to count his pulse and judge how long it took him to descend\nthat causeway in the dark. It was not so very rough, nor so very\ndangerous, but of course he only knew that fact afterward. He had to\ngrope his way inch by inch, trusting to sense of touch and the British\narmy's everlasting luck, with an eye all the while on a red light that\nwas something like the glow through hell's keyhole.\n\nWhen he reached bottom, after perhaps twenty minutes, and stood at last\non comparatively level rock, his legs were trembling from tension, and\nhe had to sit down while he stretched them out and rested. The light\nstill looked a quarter of a mile away, although that was guesswork. It\nmade scarcely more impression on the surrounding darkness than one coal\nglowing in a cellar. The silence began to make his head ache.\n\nHe got up and started forward, but just as he did that he thought he\nheard a footstep. He suspected Ismail might be following after all.\n\n\"Ismail!\" he called, trying to peer through the dark.\n\nBut all the darkness had its home there. He could not even see his own\nhand stretched out. His own voice made him jump; after a second's pause\nit began to crack and rattle from wall to wall and from roof to floor,\nuntil at last the echoing word became one again and died with a hiss\nsomewhere in the bowels of the world--Mbisssss!--like the sound of hot\niron being plunged into a blacksmith's trough with a little after-murmur\nof complaining water.\n\nBut then he was sure he heard a footstep! He faced about; and now there\nwere two red lights where there had been only one. They seemed rather\nnearer, perhaps because there were two of them.\n\n\"Hullo, King sahib!\" said a voice he recognized; and he choked. He felt\nthat if he had coughed his heart would have lain on the floor!\n\n\"Are you afraid, King sahib?\" said the Rangar Rewa Gunga's voice, and\nhe took a step forward to be closer to his questioner. He found himself\nbeside a rock, looking up at the Rangar's turban, that peered over the\ntop of it. He could dimly make out the Rangar's dark eyes.\n\n\"I would be afraid if I were you!\"\n\nRewa Gunga flashed a little electric torch into his eyes, but after\na few seconds he shifted it so that both their faces could be seen,\nalthough the Rangar's only very faintly.\n\n\"I have come to warn you!\"\n\n\"Very good of you, I'm sure!\" said King.\n\n\"If she knew I were here, she would jolly well have my liver nailed to a\nwall! I come to advise you to go back!\"\n\n\"Have they taken Ali Masjid Fort?\" King asked him.\n\n\"Never mind, sahib, but listen! I have brought her bracelet! I stole it!\nShe stole it from you, and I stole it back! Take it! Put it on and wear\nit! Use it as a passport out of Khinjan Caves--for no man dare touch you\nwhile you wear it--and as a passport down the Khyber into India! Go back\nto India and stay there! Take it and go! Quick! Take it!\"\n\n\"No, thanks!\" said King.\n\nThe Rangar laughed mirthlessly, shifting the light a little as King\nstepped aside to get a better view of him. He held the torch more\ncunningly than a Spanish lady holds a fan.\n\n\"All Englishmen are fools--most of them stiff-necked fools,\" he\nasserted. \"Bah! Do you think I do not know? Do you think anything\nis hidden from her? I know--and she knows--that you think you have a\nsurprise in store for her! You think you will go to her, and she will\nsay, 'King sahib, why did you throw that head into the river, and put me\nin danger from my men?' And you will say, will you not, 'Princess, that\nwas my brother's head!'? Was that not what you intended? Is it not true?\nDoes she not know it? She knows more than you know, King sahib! Because\nyou showed me certain little courtesies, I have come to warn you to run\naway!\"\n\n\"Do you suppose she knows you are here?\" King asked, and the Rangar\nlaughed.\n\n\"If she knows so much, and is able to read my mind from a distance,\nwhere does she suppose you are?\" King insisted.\n\nThe Rangar laughed again, leaning his chin on both fists and switching\nout the light.\n\n\"Perhaps she sent me to warn you!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said King, \"my brother commanded at Ali Masjid Fort. There are\nthings I must ask her. How did she know that head was my brother's? What\npart had she in taking it from his shoulders? What did she mean by that\nsong of hers?\"\n\nThe Rangar chuckled softly.\n\n\"There are no fools in the world like Englishmen! Listen! You are being\noffered life and liberty! Here is the key to both!\"\n\nHe made the gold bracelet ring on the rock by way of explanation.\n\n\"Take the key and go!\"\n\n\"No!\" said King.\n\n\"Very well, sahib! Hear the other side of it! Beyond those two red\nlights there is a curtain. This side of that curtain you are Athelstan\nKing of the Khyber Rifles, or Kurram Khan, or whatever you care to call\nyourself. Beyond it, you are what she calls you! Choose!\"\n\nKing did not answer, so he continued after a pause.\n\n\"You shall pass behind that curtain, if you insist. Beyond it you shall\nknow what she knows about Ali Masjid and your brother's head! You shall\nknow all that she knows! There shall be no secrets between you and her!\nShe shall translate the meaning of her song to you! But you shall never\ncome out again King of the Khyber Rifles, or Kurram Khan! If you ever\ncome out again, it shall be as you never dreamed, bearing arms you never\nsaw yet, and you shall cut with your own hand the ties that bind you to\nEngland! Choose!\"\n\n\"I chose long ago,\" said King.\n\n\"Are the gentle English never serious?\" the Rangar asked. \"Will you not\nunderstand that if you pass that curtain you shall know all things\nthat Yasmini knows, but that you shall cease to be yourself?\nCease--to--be--yourself! Is my meaning clear?\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said King, \"but I hope mine is!\"\n\n\"You will go forward?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said King.\n\nRewa Gunga made no answer to that, although King waited for an answer.\nFor about a minute there was no sound at all, except the beating of\nKing's heart. Then he moved to try and see the Rangar's turban above the\nrock. He could not see it. He found a niche in the rock, set his foot\nin it and mounted three or four feet, until his head was level with the\ntop. The Rangar was gone!\n\nHe listened for two or three minutes, but the silence began to make his\nhead ache again; so he stooped to feel the floor with his hand before\ndeciding to go forward. There was no mistaking the finish given by the\ntread of countless feet. He was on a highway, and there are not often\npitfalls where so many feet have been.\n\nFor all that he went forward as a certain Agag once did, and it was many\nminutes before he could see a curtain glowing blood-red in the light\nbehind the two lamps, at the top of a flight of ten stone steps. It\nwas peculiar to him and to his service that he counted the steps before\ngoing nearer.\n\nWhen he went quite close he saw carpet down the middle of the steps,\nso ancient that the stone showed through in places; all the pattern,\nsupposing it ever had any, was worn or faded away. Carpet and steps\nglowed red too. His own face, and the hands he held in front of him\nwere red-hot-poker color. Yet outside the little ellipse of light the\ndarkness looked like a thing to lean against, and the silence was so\nintense that he could hear the arteries singing by his ears.\n\nHe saw the curtains move slightly, apparently in a little puff of wind\nthat made the lamps waver. He was very nearly sure he heard a footfall\nbeyond the curtains and a tinkle--as of a tiny silver bell, or a jewel\nstriking against another one.\n\nHe kicked his slippers off, because there are no conditions under which\nbad manners ever are good policy. Wide history and Cocker's famous code.\nThen he walked up the steps without treading on the carpet, because\nliving scorpions have been known to be placed under carpets on purpose\non occasion. And at the top, being a Secret Service man, he stooped to\nexamine the lamps.\n\nThey were bronze, cast, polished and graved. All round the circumference\nof each bowl were figures in half-relief, representing a woman dancing.\nShe was the woman of the knife-hilt, and of the lamps in the arena! She\nlooked like Yasmini! Only she could not be Yasmini because these lamps\nwere so ancient and so rare that he had never seen any in the least like\nthem, although he had visited most of the museums of the East.\n\nBoth lamps were alike, for he crossed over to make sure and took each in\nhis hands in turn. But no two figures of the dance were alike on\neither. It was the same woman dancing, but the artist had chosen twenty\ndifferent poses with which to immortalize his skill, and hers. Both\nlamps burned sweet oil with a wick, and each had a chimney of horn, not\nat all unlike a modern lamp-chimney. The horn was stained red.\n\nAs he set the second lamp down he became aware of a subtle interesting\nsmell, and memory took back at once to Yasmini's room in the Chandni\nChowk in Delhi where he had smelled it first. It was the peculiar scent\nhe had been told was Yasmini's own--a blend of scents, like a chord of\nmusic, in which musk did not predominate.\n\nHe took three strides and touched the curtains, discovering now for the\nfirst time that there were two of them, divided down the middle. They\nwere about eight feet high, and each three feet wide, of leather, and\nthough they looked old as the \"Hills\" themselves the leather was supple\nas good cloth. They had once been decorated with figures in gold leaf,\nbut only a little patch of yellow here and there remained to hint at\nfaded glories.\n\nHe decided to remember his manners again, and at least to make\nopportunity for an invitation.\n\n\"Kurram Khan hai!\" he announced, forgetting the echo. But the echo was\nthe only answer. It cackled at him, cracking back and forth down the\ncavern to die with a groan in illimitable darkness.\n\n\"Kurram-urram-urram-urram-urram-ahn-hai! Urram-urram-urram-urram-ahn-hai!\nUrram-urram-urram-ah-hh-ough-ah!\"\n\nThere was no sound beyond the curtains. No answer. Only he thought the\nstrange scent grew stronger. He decided to go forward. With his heart in\nhis mouth he parted the curtains with both hands, startled by the sharp\njangle of metal rings on a rod.\n\nSo he stood, with arms outstretched, staring--staring--staring--with\neyes skilled swiftly to take in details, but with a brain that tried to\nexplain--formed a hundred wild suggestions--and then reeled. He was face\nto face with the unexplainable--the riddle of Khinjan Caves.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII\n\n\n\n     Grand was thy goal! Thy vision new!\n             Ave, Caesar!\n     Conquest?  Ends of Earth thy view?\n             Ave, Caesar!\n     To sow--to reap--to play God's game?\n     How many Caesars did that same\n     Until the great, grim Reaper came!\n     Who ploughs with death shall garner rue,\n     And under all skies is nothing new.\n             Vale, Caesar!\n\n\nTelling the story afterward King never made any effort to describe\nhis own sensations. It was surely enough to state what he saw, after a\nbreathless climb among the rat-runs of a mountain with his imagination\nfired already by what had happened in the Cavern of Earth's Drink.\n\nThe leather curtains slipped through his fingers and closed behind him\nwith the clash of rings on a rod. But he was beyond being startled. He\nwas not really sure he was in the world. He knew he was awake, and he\nknew he was glad he had left his shoes outside. But he was not certain\nwhether it was the twentieth century, or fifty-five B. C., or earlier\nyet; or whether time had ceased. Very vividly in that minute there\nflashed before his mind Mark Twain's suggestion of the Transposition of\nEpochs.\n\nThe place where he was did not look like a cave, but a palace chamber,\nfor the rock walls had been trimmed square and polished smooth; then\nthey had been painted pure white, except for a wide blue frieze, with\na line of gold-leaf drawn underneath it. And on the frieze, done in\ngold-leaf too, was the Grecian lady of the lamps, always dancing. There\nwere fifty or sixty figures of her, no two the same.\n\nA dozen lamps were burning, set in niches cut in the walls at measured\nintervals. They were exactly like the two outside, except that their\nhorn chimneys were stained yellow instead of red, suffusing everything\nin a golden glow.\n\nOpposite him was a curtain, rather like that through which he had\nentered. Near to the curtain was a bed, whose great wooden posts were\ncracked with age. And it was at the bed he stared, with eyes that took\nin every detail but refused to believe.\n\nIn spite of its age it was spread with fine new linen. Richly\nembroidered, not very ancient Indian draperies hung down from it to\nthe floor on either side. On it, above the linen, a man and a woman lay\nhand-in-hand; and the woman was so exactly like Yasmini, even to her\nclothing, and her naked feet, that it was not possible for a man to be\nself-possessed.\n\nThey both seemed asleep. It was as if Yasmini, weary from the dancing,\nhad laid herself to sleep beside her lord. But who was he? And why did\nhe wear Roman armor? And why was there no guard to keep intruders out?\n\nIt was minutes before he satisfied himself that the man's breast did not\nrise and fall under the bronze armor and that the woman's jeweled gauzy\nstuff was still. Imagination played such tricks with him that in the\nstillness he imagined he heard breathing.\n\nAfter he was sure they were both dead, he went nearer, but it was a\nminute yet before he knew the woman was not she. At first a wild thought\npossessed him that she had killed herself.\n\nThe only thing to show who he had been were the letters S. P. Q. R. on a\ngreat plumed helmet, on a little table by the bed. But she was the woman\nof the lamp-bowls and the frieze. A life-size stone statue in a corner\nwas so like her, and like Yasmini too, that it was difficult to decide\nwhich of the two it represented.\n\nShe had lived when he did, for her fingers were locked in his. And he\nhad lived two thousand years ago, because his armor was about as old as\nthat, and for proof that he had died in it part of his breast had turned\nto powder inside the breastplate. The rest of his body was whole and\nperfectly preserved.\n\nStern, handsome in a high-beaked Roman way, gray on the temples,\nfirm-lipped, he lay like an emperor in harness. But the pride and\nresolution on his face were outdone by the serenity of hers. Very surely\nthose two had been lovers.\n\nSomething--he could not decide what--about the man's appearance kept him\nstaring for ten minutes, holding his breath unconsciously and letting\nit out in little silent gasps. It annoyed him that he could not pin down\nthe elusive thing; and when he went on presently to be curious about\nmore tangible things, it was only to be faced with the unexplainable at\nevery turn.\n\nHow had the bodies been preserved, for instance? They were perfect,\nexcept for that one detail of the man's breast. The air was full of the\nperfume he had learned to recognize as Yasmini's, but there was no sniff\nabout the bodies of pitch or bitumen, or of any other chemical. Nor\nwas there any sign of violence about them, or means of telling how they\ndied, or when, except for the probable date of the man's armor.\n\nBoth of them looked young and healthy--the woman younger than\nthirty--twenty-five at a guess--and the man perhaps forty, perhaps\nforty-five.\n\nHe bent over them. Every stitch of the man's clothing had decayed in the\ncourse of centuries, so that his armor rested on the naked skin, except\nfor a dressed leather kilt about his middle. The leather was as old as\nthe curtains at the entrance, and as well preserved.\n\nBut the woman's silken clothing was as new as the bedding; and that was\nso new that it had been woven in Belfast, Ireland, by machinery and bore\nthe mark of the firm that made it!\n\nYet, they both died at about the same time, or how could their fingers\nhave been interlaced? And some of the jewelry on the woman's clothes was\nvery ancient as well as priceless.\n\nHe looked closer at the fingers for signs of force and suddenly caught\nhis breath. Under the woman's flimsy sleeve was a wrought gold\nbracelet, smaller than that one he himself had worn in Delhi and up the\nKhyber--exactly like the little one that Yasmini wore on her wrist in\nthe Cavern of Earth's Drink! He raised the loose sleeve to look more\nclosely at it.\n\nThe sleeve overlay the man's forearm, and the movement laid bare another\nbracelet, on the man's right wrist. Size for size, this was the same as\nthe one that had been stolen from himself.\n\nMemory prompted him. He felt its outer edge with a finger-nail. There\nwas the little nick that he had made in the soft gold when he struck it\nagainst the cell bars in the jail at the Mir Khan Palace!\n\nThat put another thought in his head. It was less than two hours since\nYasmini danced in the arena. It might well be much less than that since\nshe had taken off her bracelets. He laid a finger on the dead man's\nstone-cold hand and let it rest so for a minute. Then, running it slowly\nup the wrist, he touched the gold. It was warm. He repeated the test on\nthe woman's wrist. Hers was warm, too. Both bracelets had been worn by a\nliving being within an hour--\n\n\"Probably within minutes!\"\n\nHe muttered and frowned in thought, and then suddenly jumped backward.\nThe leather curtain near the bed had moved on its bronze rod.\n\n\"Aren't they dears?\" a voice said in English behind him. \"Aren't they\nsweet?\"\n\nHe had jumped so as to face about, and somebody laughed at him. Yasmini\nstood not two arms' lengths away, lovelier than the dead woman because\nof the merry life in her, young and warm, aglow, but looking like\nthe dead woman and the woman of the frieze--the woman of the\nlamp--bowls--the statue--come to life, speaking to him in English more\nsweetly than if it had been her mother tongue. The English abuse their\nlanguage. Yasmini caressed it and made it do its work twice over.\n\nBeing dressed as a native, he salaamed low. Knowing him for what he was,\nshe gave him the senna-stained tips of her warm fingers to kiss, and he\nthought she trembled when he touched them. But a second later she had\nsnatched them away and was treating him to raillery.\n\n\"Man of pills and blisters!\" she said, \"tell me how those bodies are\npreserved! Spill knowledge from that learned skull of thine!\"\n\nHe did not answer. He never shone in conversation at any time, having\nmade as many friends as enemies by saying nothing until the spirit moves\nhim. But she did not know that yet.\n\n\"If I knew for certain why those two did not turn to worms,\" she went\non, \"almost I would choose to die now, while I am beautiful! Think\nof the fogy museum men!\" (She called them by a far less edifying name,\nreally, for the East is frank in that way, especially in its use of\nother tongues.) \"What would they say, think you, King sahib, if they\nfound us two dead beside those two? Would not that be a mystery? Don't\nyou love mysteries? Speak, man, speak! Has Khinjan struck you dumb?\"\n\nBut he did not speak. He was staring at her arm, where two whitish marks\non the skin betrayed that bracelets had been.\n\n\"Oh, those! They are theirs. I would not rob the dead, or the gods would\nturn on me. I robbed you, instead, while you slept. Fie, King sahib,\nwhile you slept!\"\n\nBut her steel did not strike on flint. It was her eyes that flashed. He\nwould have done better to have seemed ashamed, for then he might have\nfooled her, at least for a while. But having judged himself, he did\nnot care a fig for her judgment of him. She realized that instantly and\nhaving found a tool that would not work, discarded it for a better one.\nShe grew confidential.\n\n\"I borrow them,\" she explained, \"but I put them back. I take them for\nso many days, and when the day comes--the gods like us to be exact! Once\nthere was an Englishman to whom I lent the larger one, and he refused\nto return it. He wanted it to wear, to bring him luck. Collins, of the\nGurkhas. A cobra bit him.\"\n\nKing's eyes changed, for Collins of the Gurkhas had died in his two\narms, saying never a word. He had always wondered why the native who\nran in to kill the cobra had run away again and left Collins lying there\nafter seeming to shake hands with him. Yasmini, watching his eyes and\nreading his memory, missed nothing.\n\n\"You saw?\" she said excitedly. \"You remember? Then you understand! You\nyourself were near death when I took the bracelet last night. The time\nwas up. I would have stabbed you if you had tried to prevent me!\"\n\nNow he spoke at last and gave her a first glimpse of an angle of his\nmind she had not suspected.\n\n\"Princess,\" he said. He used the word with the deference some men can\ncombine with effrontery, so that very tenderness has barbs. \"You might\nhave had that thing back if you had sent a messenger for it at any time.\nA word by a servant would have been enough.\n\n\"You could never have reached Khinjan then!\" she retorted. Her eyes\nflashed again, but his did not waver.\n\n\"Princess,\" he said, \"why speak of what you don't know?\"\n\nHe thought she would strike like a snake, but she smiled at him instead.\nAnd when Yasmini has smiled on a man he has never been just the same man\nafterward. He knows more, for one thing. He has had a lesson in one of\nthe finer arts.\n\n\"I will speak of what I do know,\" she said. \"No, there is no need. Look!\nLook!\"\n\nShe pointed at the bed--at the man on the bed--fingers locked in those\nof a woman who looked so like herself.\n\n\"You see--yet you do not see! Men are blind! Men look into a mirror, and\nsee only whiskers they forgot to shave the day before. Women look once\nand then remember! Look again!\"\n\nHe looked, knowing well there was something to be understood, that\nstared him in the face. But for the life of him he could not determine\nquestion or answer.\n\n\"What is in your bosom?\" she asked him.\n\nHe put his band to his shirt.\n\n\"Draw it out!\" she said, as a teacher drills a child.\n\nHe drew out the gold-hilted knife with the bronze blade, with which a\nman had meant to murder him. He let it lie on the palm of his hand\nand looked from it to her and back again. The hilt might have been a\nportrait of her modeled from the life.\n\n\"Here is another like it,\" she said, stepping to the bedside. She drew\nback the woman's dress at the bosom and showed a knife exactly like that\nin King's hand. \"One lay on her bosom and one on his when I found them!\"\nshe said. \"Now, think again!\"\n\nHe did think, of thirty thousand possibilities, and of one impossible\nidea that stood up prominent among them all and insisted on seeming the\nonly likely one.\n\n\"I saw the knife in your bosom last night,\" she said, \"and laughed so\nthat I nearly wakened you. Man! Are you stupid? Will that ready wit of\nyours not work? Have I bewildered you? Is it my perfume? My eyes? My\njewels? What is it? Think, man! Think!\"\n\nBut if she wanted to make him guess aloud for her amusement she was\nwasting time. Had he known the answer he would have held his tongue. As\nhe did not know it, he had all the more reason to wait indefinitely, if\nneed be. But interminable waiting was no part of her plan. Words were\nwelling out of her.\n\n\"I gave a fool that knife to use, because he was afraid. It gave him\ncourage. When he failed I knew it by telegram, and I sent another fool\nbefore the wires were cold, to kill him in the police-station cell for\nhaving failed. One fool has been stabbed and the English will hang the\nother. Then I sent twenty men to turn India inside out and find the\nknife again, for like the bracelets it has its place. And that is why I\nlaughed. They are hunting. They will hunt until I call them off!\"\n\n\"Why didn't you take it with the bracelet?\" King asked her, holding it\nout. \"Take it now. I don't want it.\"\n\nShe accepted it and laid it on the man's bronze armor. Then, however,\nshe resumed it and played with it.\n\n\"Look again!\" she said. \"Think and look again!\"\n\nHe looked, and he knew now. But he still preferred that she should tell\nhim, and his lips shut tight.\n\n\"Why, having ordered your death, did I countermand the order when your\nlife had been attempted once? Why, as soon as Rewa Gunga had seen you,\ndid I order you to be aided in every way?\"\n\nStill he did not answer, although the solution to that riddle, too,\nwas beginning to dawn on his consciousness. He suspected she would be\nannoyed if he deprived her of the fun of telling him, so that by being\nsilent he played both her game and his own.\n\n\"Why did I order your death in the first place?\"\n\nThe answer to that was obvious, but she answered it for him.\n\n\"Because, since the sirkar insisted that one man must come with me to\nKhinjan, I preferred a fool, who could be lost on the way. I knew your\nreputation. I never heard any man call you a fool.\"\n\nShe laughed. He nodded. She was obviously telling truth.\n\n\"Can you guess why I changed my mind about you--wise man?\"\n\nShe looked from him to the man on the bed and back to him again. Having\nsolved her riddle, King had leisure to be interested in her eyes, and\nwatched them analytically, like a jeweler appraising diamonds. They were\nstrangely reminiscent, but much more changeable and colorful than any he\nhad ever seen. They had the baffling trick of changing while he watched\nthem.\n\n\"Having sent a man to kill you, why did I cease to want you killed?\nInstead of losing you on the way to Khinjan, why did I run risks to\nprotect you after you reached here? Why did I save your life in the\nCavern of Earth's Drink to-night? You do not know yet? Then I will tell\nyou something else you do not know. I was in Delhi when you were! I\nwatched and listened while you and Rewa Gunga talked in my house! I was\nin Rewa Gunga's carriage on the train that he took and you did not! I\nhave learned at first hand that you are not a fool. But that was not\nenough! You had to be three things--clever and brave and one other. The\none other you are! Brave you have proved yourself to be! Clever you\nmust be, to trick your way into Khinjan Caves, even with Ismail at your\nelbow! That is why I saved your life--because you are those two things\nand--and--one other!\"\n\nShe snatched a mirror from a little ivory table--a modern mirror--bad\nglass, bad art, bad workmanship, but silver warranted.\n\n\"Look in it and then at him!\" she ordered.\n\nBut he did not need to look. The man on the bed was not so much like\nhimself as the woman was like her, but the resemblance seemed to grow\nunder his eyes, as such things do. It was helped out by the stain his\nbrother had applied to his face in the Khyber. King was the taller\nand the younger by several years, but the noses were the same, and the\nwrinkled fore-heads; both men had the same firm mouth; both looked like\nRomans.\n\n\"How did you get that scar?\"\n\nShe came closer and took his hand, holding it in both hers, and he felt\nthe same thrill Samson knew. He steeled himself as Samson did not.\n\n\"A Mahsudi got me with a martini at long range in the blockade of 1902,\"\nhe said dryly.\n\n\"Look! Did he get his from a spear or from an arrow?\"\n\nAlmost in the same spot, also on the dead man's left hand, was a scar\nso nearly like it that it needed a third and a fourth glance to tell the\ndifference. They both bent over the bed to see it, and she laid a\nhand on his shoulder. Touch and scent and confidence, all three were\nbewitching; all three were calculated, too! He could have killed her,\nand she knew he could have killed her, just as she knew he would not.\nYet what right had she to know it!\n\n\"Athelstan!\"\n\nShe pronounced his given name as if she loved the word, standing\nstraight again and looking into his eyes. There were high lights in hers\nthat outgleamed the diamonds on her dress.\n\n\"Your gods and mine have done this, Athelstan. When the gods combine\nthey lay plans well indeed!\"\n\n\"I only know one God,\" he answered simply, as a man speaks of the deep\nthings in his heart.\n\n\"I know of many! They love me! They shall love you, too! Many are better\nthan one! You shall learn to know my gods, for we are to be partners,\nyou and I!\"\n\nShe laughed at him, looking like a goddess herself, but he frowned. And\nthe more he frowned the better she seemed to like him.\n\n\"Partners in what, Princess?\"\n\n\"Thou--Ismail dubbed thee Ready o' wit!--answer thine own question!\"\n\nShe took his hand again, her eyes burning with excitement and mysticism\nand ambition like a fever. She seemed to take more than physical\npossession of him.\n\n\"What brought them here? Tell me that!\" she demanded, pointing to the\nbed. \"You think he brought, her? I tell you she was the spur that drove\nhim! Is it a wonder that men called her the 'Heart of the Hills'? I\nfound them ten years ago and clothed her and put new linen on their bed,\nfor the old was all rags and dust. There have always been hundreds--and\nsometimes thousands--who knew the secret of Khinjan Caves, but this has\nbeen a secret within a secret. Some one, who knew the secret before I,\nsawed those bracelets through and fitted hinges and clasps. The men you\nsaw in the Cavern of Earth's Drink have no doubt I am the 'Heart of the\nHills' come to life! They shall know thee as Him within a little while!\"\n\nShe held his hand a little tighter and pressed closer to him, laughing\nsoftly. He stood as if made of iron, and that only made her laugh the\nmore.\n\n\"Tales of the 'Heart of the Hills' have puzzled the Raj, haven't they,\nthese many years? They sent me to find the source of them. Me! They\nchose well! There are not many like me! I have found this one dead woman\nwho was like me. And in ten years, until you came, I have found no man\nlike Him!\"\n\nShe tried to look into his eyes, but he frowned straight in front of\nhim. His native costume and Rangar turban did not make him seem any less\na man. His jowl, that was beginning to need shaving, was as grim and\nas satisfying as the dead Roman's. She stroked his left hand with soft\nfingers.\n\n\"I used to think I knew how to dance!\" she laughed--\"For ten years I\nhave taken those pictures of her for my model and have striven to learn\nwhat she knew. I have surpassed her! I used to think I knew how to amuse\nmyself with men's dreams--until I found this! Then I dreamed on my own\naccount! My dream was true, my warrior! You have come! Our hour has\ncome!\"\n\nShe tugged at his hand. He was hers, soul and harness, if outward signs\ncould prove it.\n\n\"Come!\" she said. \"Is this my hospitality? You are weary and hungry.\nCome!\"\n\nShe led him by the hand, for it would have needed brute force to pry her\nfingers loose. She drew aside the leather curtain that hung on a bronze\nrod near the bed, led him through it, and let it clash to again behind\nthem.\n\nNow they were in the dark together, and it was not comprehended in her\nscheme of things to let circumstance lie fallow. She pressed his hand,\nand sighed, and then hurried, whispering tender words he could scarcely\ncatch. When they burst together through a curtain at the other end of\na passage in the rock, his skin was red under the tan and for the first\ntime her eyes refused to meet his.\n\n\"Why did they choose that cave to sleep in?\" she asked him. \"Is not this\na better one? Who laid them there?\"\n\nHe stared about. They were in a great room far more splendid than the\nfirst. There was a fountain in the center splashing in the midst of\nflowers. They were cut flowers. The \"Hills\" must have been scoured for\nthem within a day.\n\nThere were great cushioned couches all about and two thrones made of\nivory and gold. Between two couches was a table, laden with golden\nplates and a golden jug, on pure white linen. There were two goblets of\nbeaten gold and knives with golden handles and bronze blades. The whole\nroom seemed to be drenched in the scent Yasmini favored, and there was\nthe same frieze running round all four walls, with the woman depicted on\nit dancing.\n\n\"Come, we shall eat!\" she said, leading him by the hand to a couch. She\ntook the one facing him, and they lay like two Romans of the Empire with\nthe table in between.\n\nShe struck a golden gong then, and a native woman came in who stared at\nKing as if she had seen him before and did not like him. Except for the\njewels, she was dressed exactly like Yasmini, which is to say that her\ngauzy stuff was all but transparent. But Yasmini uses raiment as she\ndoes her eyes; it is part of her, and of her art. The maid, who would\nhave shone among many women, looked stiff and dull by contrast.\n\n\"I trust no Hill woman--they are cattle with human tongues,\" Yasmini\nsaid, frowning at the maid. \"Even in Delhi there was only this one woman\nwhom I dared bring here with me. You brought my men-servants! They\nare loyal, but as clumsy as the bears in their cold 'Hills'! Rewa Gunga\nbrought me this one disguised as a man--you remember?\"\n\nShe nodded to the servant, who clapped her hands. At once came a stream\nof Hillmen, robed in white, who carried sherbet in bottles cooled in\nsnow and dishes fragrant with hot food. He recognized his own prisoners\nfrom the Mir Khan Palace jail, and nodded to them as they set the things\ndown under the maid's direction. When they had done the woman chased\nthem out and came and stood behind Yasmini with a fan, for though it was\nnot too hot, she liked to have her golden hair blown into movement.\n\n\"My cook was a viceroy's,\" she said, beginning to eat. \"He killed an\nofficer who said the curry had pig's fat in it. That made him free of\nKhinjan but of not many other places! I have promised him a swim in\nEarth's Drink when he ever forgets his art!\"\n\nKing ate, because a man can not talk and eat at once. It was true that\nhe was hungry, that hunger is a piquant sauce, and that artist was an\nadjective too mild to apply to the cook. But the other reason was his\nchief one. Yasmini ate daintily, as if only to keep him company.\n\n\"You would rather have wine?\" she asked suddenly. \"All sahibs drink\nwine. Bring wine!\" she ordered.\n\nBut King shook his head, and she looked pleased.\n\nHe had thought she would be disappointed. When he had finished eating\nshe drove the maid away with a sharp word; and when King jumped to his\nfeet she led him toward the gold-and-ivory thrones, taking her seat on\none of them and bidding him adjust the footstool.\n\n\"Would I might offer you the other!\" she said, merrily enough, \"but you\nmust sit at my feet until our hearts are one!\"\n\nIt was clear that she took no delight in easy victories, for she laughed\naloud at the quizzical expression on his face. He guessed that if she\ncould have conquered him at the first attempt a day would have found her\nweary of him; there was deliberate wisdom in his plan for the present to\nseem to let her win by little inches at a time. He reasoned that so she\nwould tell him more than if he defied her outright.\n\nHe brought an ivory footstool and set it about a yard away from her\nwaxen toes. And she, watching him with burning eyes, wound tresses of\nher hair around the golden dagger handle, making her jewels glitter with\neach movement.\n\n\"You pleased me by refusing wine,\" she said. \"You please me--oh, you\nplease me! Christians drink wine and eat beef and pig-meat. Ugh! Hindu\nand Muslim both despise them, having each a little understanding of his\nown. The gods of India, who are the only real gods, what do they think\nof it all! They have been good to the English, but they have had no\nthanks. They will stand aside now and watch a greater jihad than the\nworld has ever seen! And the Hindu, who holds the cow sacred, will not\nsupport Christians who hold nothing sacred, against Muhammadans who\nloathe the pig! Christianity has failed! The English must go down with\nit--just as Rome went down when she dabbled in Christianity. Oh, I know\nall about Rome!\"\n\n\"And the gods of India?\" he asked, to keep her to the point now that she\nseemed well started.\n\nHe was there to learn, not to teach.\n\n\"I know them, too! I know them as nobody else does! They are neither\nHindu, nor Muhammadan, but are older by a thousand ages than either\nfoolishness! I love them, and they love me--as you shall love me, too!\nIf they did not love both of us, we would not both be here! We must obey\nthem!\"\n\nNone of the East's amazing ways of courtship are ever tedious. Love\nsprings into being on an instant and lives a thousand years inside an\nhour. She left no doubt as to her meaning. She and King were to love,\nas the East knows love, and then the world might have just what they two\ndid not care to take from it.\n\nHis only possible course as yet was the defensive, and there is no\ndefense like silence. He was still.\n\n\"The sirkar,\" she went on, \"the silly sirkar fears that perhaps Turkey\nmay enter the war. Perhaps a jihad may be proclaimed. So much for fear!\nI know! I have known for a very long time! And I have not let fear\ntrouble me at all!\"\n\nHer eyes were on his steadily, and she read no fear in his,\neither, for none was there. In hers he saw ambition--triumph\nalready--excitement--the gambler's love of all the hugest risks. Behind\nthem burned genius and the devilry that would stop at nothing. As the\ngeneral had told him in Peshawur, she would dare open Hell's gate and\nride the devil down the Khyber for the fun of it.\n\n\"Au diable, diable et demie!\" the French say; and like most French\nproverbs it is a wise one. But whence the devil and a half should come\nto thwart her was not obvious.\n\n\"I must be a devil and a half,\" he told himself, and very nearly\nlaughed aloud at the idea. She mistook the sudden humor in his eyes for\nadmiration of herself, being used to that from men.\n\n\"Listen, while I tell you all from the beginning! The sirkar sent me to\ndiscover what may be this 'Heart of the Hills' men talk about. I found\nthese caves--and this! I told the sirkar a little about the Caves, and\nnothing at all about the Sleepers. But even at that they only believed\nthe third of what I said. And I--back in Delhi I bought books--borrowed\nbooks--sent to Europe for more books--and hired babu Sita Ram to read\nthem to me, until his tongue grew dry and swollen and he used\nto fall asleep in a corner. I know all about Rome! Days I\nspent--weeks!--months!--listening to the history of their great Caesar,\nand their little Caesars--of their conquests and their games! It was\ngood, and I understood it all! Rome should have been true to the old\ngods, and they would have been true to her! She fell when she fooled\nwith Christianity!\"\n\nShe was speaking dreamily now, with her chin resting on a hand and an\nelbow on the ivory arm of the throne, remembering as she told her story.\nAnd it meant so much to her, she was so in earnest, that her voice\nconjured up pictures for King to see.\n\n\"When I had read enough I came back here to think. I knew enough now\nto be sure that the Sleeper is a Roman, and the 'Heart of the Hills' a\nGrecian maid. She is like me. That is why I know she drove him to make\nan empire, choosing for a beginning these 'Hills' where Rome had never\npenetrated. He found her in Greece. He plunged through Persia to build a\nthrone for her! I have seen it all in dreams, and again in the crystal!\nAnd because I was all alone, I saw that I would need all the skill I\ncould learn, and much patience. So I began to learn to dance as she\ndanced, using those pictures of her as a model. I have surpassed her! I\ncan dance better than she ever did!\n\n\"Between times I would go to Delhi and dance there a little, and a\nlittle in other places--once indeed before a viceroy, and once for the\nking of England--and all men--the king, too!--told me that none in\nthe world can dance as I can! And all the while I kept looking for the\nman--the man who should be like the Sleeper, even as I am like her whom\nhe loved!\n\n\"Many a man--many and many a man I have tried and found wanting! For I\nwas impatient in spite of resolutions. I burned to find him at once, and\nbegin! But you are the first of all the men I have tested who answered\nall the tests! Languages--he must speak the native tongues. Brave be\nmust be--and clever--resembling the Sleeper in appearance. I began to\nthink long ago that I must forego that last test, for there was none\nlike the Sleeper until you came. And when this world war broke--for it\nis a world war, a world war I tell you!--I thought at last that I must\nmanage all alone. And then you came!\n\n\"But there were many I tried--many--especially after I abandoned the\nthought that the man must resemble the Sleeper. There was a Prince of\nGermany who came to India on a hunting trip. You remember?\"\n\nKing pricked his ears and allowed himself to grin, for in common with\nmany hundred other men who had been lieutenants at the time, he would\nonce have given an ear and an eye to know the truth of that affair. The\ngrin transformed his whole appearance, until Yasmini beamed on him.\n\n\"I'm listening, Princess!\" he reminded her.\n\n\"Well--he came--the Prince of Germany--the borrower!\"\n\n\"Borrower of what, Princess?\"\n\n\"Of wit! Of brains! Of platitudes! Of reputation! There came a crowd\nwith him of such clumsy plunderers, asking such rude questions, that\neven the sirkar could not shut its ears and eyes!\n\n\"I did not know all about sahibs in those days. I thought that, although\nthis man is what he is, yet he is a prince, and perhaps I can fire him\nwith my genius. I could have taught him the native tongues. I thought\nhe had ambition, but I learned that he is only greedy. You see, I was\nfoolish, not knowing yet that in good time if I am patient my man will\ncome to me! But I learned all about Germans--all!\n\n\"I offered him India first, then Asia, then the world--even as I now\noffer them to you. The sirkar sent him to see me dance, and he stayed\nto hear me talk. When I saw at last that he has the head and heart of a\nhyena I told him lies. But he, being drunk, told me truths that I have\nremembered.\n\n\"Later he sent two of his officers to ask me questions, and they were\nlittle better than he, although a little better mannered. I told them\nlies, too, and they told me lies, but they told me much that was true.\n\n\"Then the prince came again, a last time. And I was weary of him. The\nsirkar was very weary of him too. He offered me money to go to Germany\nand dance for the kaiser in Berlin. He said I will be shown there much\nthat will be to my advantage. I refused. He made me other offers. So I\nspat in his face and threw food at him.\n\n\"He complained to the sirkar against me, sending one of his high\nofficers to demand that I be whipped. So I told the sirkar some--not\nmuch, indeed, but enough--of the things he and his officers had told\nme. And the sirkar said at once that there was both cholera and bubonic\nplague, and he must go home!\n\n\"I have heard--three men told me--that he said he will never rest until\nI have been whipped! But I have heard that his officers laughed behind\nhis back. And ever since that time there have always been Germans in\ncommunication with me. I have had more money from Berlin than would\nbribe the viceroy's council, and I have not once been in the dark about\nGermany's plans--although they have always thought I am in the dark.\n\n\"I went on looking for my man--studying all, Germans, English, Turks,\nFrench--and there was a Frenchman whom I nearly chose--and an American,\na man who used the strangest words, who laughed at me. I studied Hindu,\nMuslim, Christian, every good-looking fighting man who came my way,\nknowing well that all creeds are one when the gods have named their\nchoice.\n\n\"There came that old Bull-with-a-beard, Muhammad Anim, and for a time I\nthought he is the man, for he is a man whatever else he is. But I tired\nof him. I called him Bull-with-a-beard, and the 'Hills' took it up and\nmocked him, until the new name stuck. He still thinks he is the man,\nhaving more strength to hope and more will to will wrongly than any\nman I ever met, except a German. I have even been sure sometimes that\nMuhammad Anim is a German; yet now I am not sure.\n\n\"From all the men I met and watched I have learned all they knew! And I\nhave never neglected to tell the sirkar sufficient of what men have told\nme, to keep the sirkar pleased with me!\n\n\"Nor have I ever played Germany's game--no, no! I have talked with a\nprince of Germany, and I understand too well! Who sups with a boar may\nget good roots to eat, but must endure pigs' feet in the trough! Pigs'\nhides make good saddles; I have used the Germans, as they think they\nhave used me! I have used them ruthlessly.\n\n\"Knowing all I knew, and being ready except that I had not found my man\nyet, I dallied in India on the eve of war, watching a certain Sikh to\ndiscover whether he is the man or not. But he lacked imagination, and\nI was caught in Delhi when war broke and the English dosed the Khyber\nPass. Yet I had to come up the Khyber, to reach Khinjan.\n\n\"So it was fortunate that I knew of a German plot that I could spoil\nat the last minute. I fooled the Germans by letting the Sikh whom I had\nwatched discover it. The Germans still believe me their accomplice--and\nthe sirkar was so pleased that I think if I had asked for an English\npeerage they would have answered me soberly. A million dynamite bombs\nwas a big haul for the sirkar! My offer to go to Khinjan and keep the\n'Hills' quiet was accepted that same day!\n\n\"But what are a million dynamite bombs! Dynamite bombs have been coming\ninto Khinjan month by month these three years! Bombs and rifles and\ncartridges! Muhammad Anim's men, whom he trusts because he must, hid it\nall in a cave I showed them, that they think, and he thinks, has only\none entrance to it. Muhammad Anim scaled it, and he has the key. But I\nhave the ammunition!\n\n\"There was another way out of that cave, although there is none now,\nfor I have blocked it. My men, whom I trust because I know them, carried\neverything out by the back way, and I have it all. I will show it to you\npresently.\n\n\"I know all Muhammad Anim's plans. Bull-with-a-beard believes himself a\nstatesman, yet he told me all he knows! He has told me how Germany plans\nto draw Turkey in and to force Turkey to proclaim a jihad. As if I did\nnot know it first, almost before the Germans knew it! Fools! The jihad\nwill recoil on them! It will be like a cobra, striking whoever stirs\nit! A typhoon, smiting right and left! Christianity is doomed, and\nthe Germans call themselves Christians! Fools! Rome called herself\nChristian--and where is Rome?\n\n\"But we, my warrior, when Muhammad Anim gets the word from Germany and\ngives the sign, and the 'Hills' are afire, and the whole East roars in\nthe flame of the jihad--we will put ourselves at the head of that jihad,\nand the East and the world is ours!\"\n\nKing smiled at her.\n\n\"The East isn't very well armed,\" he objected. \"Mere numbers--\"\n\n\"Numbers?\" She laughed at him. \"The West has the West by the throat!\nIt is tearing itself! They will drag in America! There will be no armed\nnation with its hands free--and while those wolves fight, other wolves\nshall come and steal the meat! The old gods, who built these caverns in\nthe 'Hills,' are laughing! They are getting ready! Thou and I--\"\n\nAs she coupled him and herself together in one plan she read the changed\nexpression of his face--the very quickly passing cloud that even the\nbest-trained man can not control.\n\n\"I know!\" she asserted, sitting upright and coming out of her dream\nto face facts as their master. She looked more lovely now than ever,\nalthough twice as dangerous. \"You are thinking of your brother--of his\nhead! That I am a murderess who can never be your friend! Is that not\nso?\"\n\nHe did not answer, but his eyes may have betrayed something, for\nshe looked as if he had struck her. Leaning forward, she held the\ngold-hilted dagger out to him, hilt first.\n\n\"Take it and stab me!\" she ordered. \"Stab--if you blame me for your\nbrother's death! I should have known him for your brother if I had come\non him in the dark!--His head might have come from your shoulders!--You\nwere like a man holding up his own head, as I have seen in pictures in a\nbook! I would never have killed him!\"\n\nHer golden hair fell all about his shoulders, and its scent was not\nintended to be sobering. She ran warm fingers through his hair while she\nheld the knife toward him with the other hand.\n\n\"Take it and stab!\"\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\n\"No!\" she laughed. \"No! You are my warrior--my man--my well--beloved!\nYou have come to me alone out of all the world! You would no more stab\nme than the gods would forget me!\"\n\nTheir eyes were on each other's--deep looking into deep.\n\n\"Strength!\" she said, flinging him away and leaning back to look at him,\nalmost as a fed cat stretches in the sunlight. \"Courage! Simplicity!\nDirectness! Strength I have, too, and courage never failed me, but my\nmind is a river winding in and out, gathering as it goes. I have no\ndirectness--no simplicity! You go straight from point to point, my\nsending from the gods! I have needed you! Oh, I have needed you so much,\nthese many years! And now that you have come you want to hate me because\nyou think I killed your brother! Listen--I will tell you all I know\nabout your brother.\"'\n\nWithout a scrap of proof of any kind he knew she was telling truth\nunadorned--or at least the truth as she saw it. Eye to eye, there are\ntimes when no proof is needed.\n\n\"Without my leave, Muhammad Anim sent five hundred men on a foray toward\nthe Khyber. Bull-with-a-beard needed an Englishman's head, for proof\nfor a spy of his who could not enter Khinjan Caves. They trapped your\nbrother outside Ali Masjid with fifty of his men. They took his head\nafter a long fight, leaving more than a hundred of their own in payment.\n\n\"Bull-with-a-beard was pleased. But he was careless, and I sent my men\nto steal the head from his men. I needed evidence for you. And I swear\nto you--I swear to you by my gods who have brought us two together--that\nI first knew it was your brother's head when you held it up in the\nCavern of Earth's Drink! Then I knew it could not be anybody else's\nhead!\"\n\n\"Why bid me throw it to them, then?\" he asked her, and he was aware of\nher scorn before the words had left his lips.\n\nShe leaned back again and looked at him through lowered eyes, as if she\nmust study him all anew. She seemed to find it hard to believe that he\nreally thought so in the commonplace.\n\n\"What is a head to me, or to you--a head with no life in\nit--carrion!--compared to what shall be? Would you have known it was his\nhead if you had thrown it to them when I ordered you?\"\n\nHe understood. Some of her blood was Russian, some Indian.\n\n\"A friend is a friend, but a brother is a rival,\" says the East, out of\nworld-old experience, and in some ways Russia is more eastern than the\nEast itself.\n\n\"Muhammad Anim shall answer to you for your brother's head!\" she said\nwith a little nod, as if she were making concessions to a child. \"At\npresent we need him. Let him preach his jihad, and loose it at the\nright time. After that he will be in the way! You shall name his\ndeath--Earth's Drink--slow torture--fire! Will that content you?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, with a dry laugh.\n\n\"What more can you ask?\"\n\n\"Less! My brother died at the head of his men. He couldn't ask more. Let\nBull-with-a-beard alone.\"\n\nShe set both elbows on her knees and laid her chin on both hands to\nstare at him again. He began to remember long-forgotten schoolboy lore\nabout chemical reagents, that dissolve materials into their component\nparts, such was the magic of her eyes. There were no eyes like hers that\nhe had ever seen, although Rewa Gunga's had been something like them.\nOnly Rewa Gunga's had not changed so. Thought of the Rangar no sooner\ncrossed his mind than she was speaking of him.\n\n\"Rewa Gunga met you in the dark, beyond those outer curtains, did he\nnot?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Did he tell you that if you pass the curtains you shall be told all I\nknow?\"\n\nHe nodded again, and she laughed.\n\n\"It would take time to tell you all I know! First, I think I will show\nyou things. Afterward you shall ask me questions, and I will answer\nthem!\"\n\nShe stood up, and of course he stood up, too. So, she on the footstool\nof the throne, her eyes and his were on a level. She laid hands on\nhis shoulders and looked into his eyes until he could see his own twin\nportraits in hers that were glowing sunset pools. Heart of the Hills?\nThe Heart of all the East seemed to burn in her, rebellious!\n\n\"Are you believing me?\" she asked him.\n\nHe nodded, for no man could have helped believing her. As she knew\nthe truth, she was telling it to him, as surely as she was doing her\nskillful best to mesmerize him. But the Secret Service is made up of men\ntrained against that.\n\n\"Come!\" she said, and stepping down she took his arm.\n\nShe led him past the thrones to other leather curtains in a wall, and\nthrough them into long hewn passages from cavern into cavern, until even\nthe Rock of Gibraltar seemed like a doll's house in comparison.\n\nIn one cave there were piles of javelins that had been stacked there by\nthe Sleeper and his men. In another were sheaves of arrows; and in one\nwere spears in racks against a wall. There were empty stables, with\nrings made fast into the rock where a hundred horses could have stood in\nline.\n\nShe showed him a cave containing great forges, where the bronze had been\nworked, with charcoal still piled up against the wall at one end. There\nwere copper and tin ingots in there of a shape he had never seen.\n\n\"I know where they came from,\" she told him. \"I have made it my\nbusiness to know all the 'Hills.' I know things the Hillmen's\ngreat-great-great-grand-fathers forgot! I know old workings that would\nmake a modern nation rich! We shall have money when we need it, never\nfear! We shall conquer India while the English backs are turned and the\nbest troops are oversea. We will bring a hundred thousand slaves back\nhere to work our mines! With what they dig from the mines, copper and\ngold and tin, we will make ready to buy the English off when they are\nfree to turn this way again. The English will do anything for money!\nThey will be in debt when this war is over, and their price will be less\nthen than now!\"\n\nShe laughed merrily at him because his face showed that he did not\nappreciate that stricture. Then she called him her Warrior and her\nWell-beloved and took him down a long passage, holding his hand all the\nway, to show him slots cut in the floor for the use of archers.\n\n\"You entered Khinjan Caves by a tunnel under this floor, Well-beloved.\nThere is no other entrance!\"\n\nBy this time Well-beloved was her name for him, although there was no\nair of finality about it. It was as if she paved the way for use of\nAthelstan and that was a sacred name. It was amazing how she conveyed\nthat impression without using words.\n\n\"The Sleeper cut these slots for his archers. Then he had another\nthought and set these cauldrons in place, to boil oil to pour down.\nCould any army force a way through by the route by which you entered?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, marveling at the ton-weight copper cauldrons, one to each\nhole.\n\n\"Even without rifles for the defense?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\n\"And I have more than a thousand Mauser rifles here, and more than a\nmillion rounds of ammunition!\"\n\n\"How did you get them?\"\n\n\"I shall tell you that later. Come and see some other things. See and\nbelieve!\"\n\nShe showed him a cave in which boxes were stacked in high square piles.\n\n\"Dynamite bombs!\" she boasted. \"How many boxes? I forget! Too many to\ncount! Women brought them all the way from the sea, for even Muhammad\nAnim could not make Afridi riflemen carry loads. I have wondered what\nBull-with-a-beard will say when he misses his precious dynamite!\"\n\n\"You've enough in there to blow the mountain up!\" King advised her. \"If\nsomebody fired a pistol in here, the least would be the collapse of this\nfloor into the tunnel below with a hundred thousand tons of rock on top\nof it. There is no other way out?\"\n\n\"Earth's Drink!\" she said, and he made a grimace that set her to\nlaughing.\n\nBut she looked at him darkly after that and he got the impression that\nthe thought was not new to her, and that she did not thank him for\nthe advice. He began to wonder whether there was anything she had not\nthought of--any loophole she had left him for escape--any issue she had\nnot foreseen.\n\n\"Kill her!\" a secret voice urged him. But that was the voice of the\n\"Hills,\" that are violent first and regretful afterward. He did not\nlisten to it. And then the wisdom of the West came to him, as epitomized\nby Cocker along the lines laid down by Solomon.\n\n\"It isn't possible to make a puzzle that has no solution to it. The fact\nthat it's a puzzle is the proof that there's a key! Go ahead!\"\n\nIt was the \"Go ahead!\" that Solomon omitted, and that makes Cocker such\ncheerful reading. King ceased conjecturing and gave full attention to\nhis guide.\n\nShe showed him where eleven hundred Mauser rifles stood in racks in\nanother cave, with boxes of ammunition piled beside them--each rifle and\ncartridge worth its weight in silver coin--a very rajah's ransom!\n\n\"The Germans are generous in some things--only in some things--very\nmean in others!\" she told him. \"They sent no medical stores, and no\nblankets!\"\n\nPast caves where provisions of every imaginable kind were stored,\nsufficient for an army, she led him to where her guards slept together\nwith the thirty special men whom King had brought with him up the\nKhyber.\n\n\"I have five hundred others whom I dare trust to come in here,\" she\nsaid, \"but they shall stay outside until I want them. A mystery is a\ngood thing! It is good for them all to wonder what I keep in here! It is\ngood to keep this sanctuary; it makes for power!\"\n\nPressing very close to him, she guided him down another dark tunnel\nuntil he and she stood together in the jaws of the round hole above the\nriver, looking down into the cavern of Earth's Drink.\n\nNobody looked up at them. The thousands were too busy working up a\nfrenzy for the great jihad that was to come.\n\nStacks of wood had been piled up, six-man high in the middle, and then\nfired. The heat came upward like a furnace blast, and the smoke was a\ngreat red cloud among the stalactites. Round and round that holocaust\nthe thousands did their sword-dance, yelling as the devils yelled at\nKhinjan's birth. They needed no wine to craze them. They were drunk with\nfanaticism, frenzy, lust!\n\n\"The women brought that wood from fifty miles away!\" Yasmini shouted in\nhis ear; for the din, mingling with the river's voice, made a volcano\nchord. \"It is a week's supply of wood! But so they are--so they will be!\nThey will lay waste India! They will butcher and plunder and burn! It\nwill be what they leave of India that we shall build anew and govern,\nfor India herself will rise to help them lay her own cities waste! It is\nalways so! Conquests always are so! Come!\"\n\nShe tugged at him and led him back along the tunnel and through other\ntunnels to the throne room, where she made him sit at her feet again.\n\nThe food had been cleared away in their absence. Instead, on the ebony\ntable there were pens and ink and paper.\n\nShe leaned back on her throne, with bare feet pressed tight against the\nfootstool, staring, staring at the table and the pens, and then at\nKing, as if she would compose an ultimatum to the world and send King to\ndeliver it.\n\n\"I said I will tell you,\" she sad slowly. \"Listen!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIV\n\n\n\n     Nothing new! Nothing new!\n     Nowhere to hide when a reckoning's due,\n     But right earns right, and wrong gets rue,\n     With nothing deducted or given in lieu;\n     And neither the War God, I, nor you\n     Ever could make one lie come true!\n             Vale, Ceasar!\n\n\nAs Yasmini herself had admitted, she headed from point to point after a\nmanner of her own.\n\n\"You know where is Dar es Salaam?\" she asked.\n\n\"East Africa,\" said King.\n\n\"How far is that from here?\"\n\n\"Two or three thousand miles.\"\n\n\"And English war-ships watch the Persian Gulf and all the seas from\nIndia to Aden?\"\n\nKing nodded.\n\n\"Have the English any ships that dive under water?\"\n\nHe nodded again.\n\n\"In these waters?\"\n\n\"I think not. I'm not sure, but I think not.\"\n\n\"The grenades you have seen, and the rifles and cartridges were sent by\nthe Germans to Dar es Salaam, to suppress a rising of African natives.\nDoes it begin to grow clear to you, my friend?\"\n\nHe smiled as well as nodded this time.\n\n\"Muhammad Anim used to wait with a hundred women at a certain place on\nthe seashore. What he found on the beach there he made the women carry\non their heads to Khinjan. And by the time he had hidden what he found\nand returned from Khinjan to the beach, there were more things to\nfind and bring. So they worked, he and the Germans, for I know not how\nlong--with the English watching the seas as on land lean wolves comb the\nvalleys.\n\n\"Did you ever hear of the big whale in the Gulf?\"\n\n\"No,\" said King. That was natural. There are as a rule about as many\nwhales as salmon in the Persian Gulf.\n\n\"A German who came to me in Delhi--he who first showed me pictures of\nan underwater ship--said that at that time the officers and crew of one\nsuch ship were getting great practise. Do you suppose their practise\nmade whales take refuge in the Gulf?\"\n\n\"How should I know, Princess?\"\n\n\"Because I heard a story later, of an English cruiser on its way up\nthe Gulf, that collided with a whale. The shock of hitting it bent many\nsteel plates, and the cruiser had to put back for repair. It must have\nbeen a very big whale, for there was much oil on the sea for a long time\nafterward. So I heard.\n\n\"And no more dynamite came--nor rifles--nor cartridges, although the\nGermans bad promised more. And orders for Muhammad Anim that had been\nsaid to come by sea came now by way of Bagdad, carried by pilgrims\nreturning from the holy places. I know that because I intercepted a\nletter and threw its bearer into Earth's Drink to save Muhammad Anim the\ntrouble of asking questions.\"\n\n\"What were the terms of the German bargain?\" King asked her. \"What\nstipulations did they make?\"\n\n\"With the tribes? None! They were too wise. A jihad was decided on in\nGermany's good time; and when that time should come ten rifles in the\n'Hills' and a thousand cartridges would mean not only a hundred dead\nEnglishmen, but ten times that number busily engaged. Why bargain when\nthere was no need? A rifle is what it is. The 'Hills' are the 'Hills'!\n\n\"Tell me about your lamp oil, then,\" he said. \"You burn enough oil in\nKhinjan Caves to light Bombay! That does not come by submarine. The\nsirkar knows how much of everything goes up the Khyber. I have seen\nthe printed lists myself--a few hundred cans of kerosene--a few score\ngallons of vegetable oil, and all bound for farther north. There isn't\nenough oil pressed among the 'Hills' to keep these caves going for a\nday. Where does it all come from?\"\n\nShe laughed, as a mother laughs at a child's questions, finding\ndelicious enjoyment in instructing him.\n\n\"There are three villages, not two days' march from Khabul, where men\nhave lived for centuries by pressing oil for Khinjan Caves,\" she said.\n\"The Sleeper fetched his oil thence. There are the bones of a camel in a\ncave I did not show you, and beside the camel are the leather bags still\nin which the oil was carried. Nowadays it comes in second-hand cans\nand drums. The Sleeper left gold in here. Those who kept the Sleeper's\nsecret paid for the oil in gold. No Afghan troubled why oil was needed,\nso long as gold paid for it, until Abdurrahman heard the story. He made\na ten-year-long effort to learn the secret, but he failed. When he cut\noff the supply of oil for a time, there was A rebellion so close to\nKhabul gates that he thought better of it. Of gold and Abdurrahman, gold\nwas the stronger. And I know where the Sleeper dug his gold!\"\n\nThey sat in silence for a long while after that, she looking at the\ntable, with its ink and pens and paper, and he thinking, with hands\nclasped round one knee; for it is wiser to think than to talk, even when\na woman is near who can read thoughts that are not guarded.\n\n\"Most disillusionments come simply,\" King said at last. \"D'you know,\nPrincess, what has kept the sirkar from really believing in Khinjan\nCaves?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"The gods!\" she said. \"The gods can blindfold\ngovernments and whole peoples as easily as they can make us see!\"\n\n\"It was the fact that they knew what provisions and what oil and what\nnecessities of life went up the Khyber and came down it. They knew a\nplace such as this was said to be could not be. They knew it! They could\nprove it!\"\n\nYasmini nodded.\n\n\"Let it be a lesson to you, Princess!\"\n\nShe stared, and her fiery-opal eyes began to change and glow. She began\nto twist her golden hair round the dagger hilt again. But always\nher feet were still on the footstool of the throne, as if she\nknew--knew--knew that she stood on firm foundations. No sirkar ever\ndoubted less than she, and the suggestions in King's little homily did\nnot please her. She looked toward the table again--then again into his\neyes.\n\n\"Athelstan!\" she said. \"It sounds like a king's name! What was the\nSleeper's name? I have often wondered! I found no name in all the books\nabout Rome that seemed to fit him. None of the names I mouthed could\nmake me dream as the sight of him could. But, Athelstan! That is a\nname like a king's! It seems to fit him, too! Was there such a name, in\nRome?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\n\"What does it mean?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Slow of resolution!\"\n\nShe clapped her hands.\n\n\"Another sign!\" she laughed. \"The gods love me! There always is a\nsign when I need one! Slow of resolution, art thou? I will speed thy\nresolution, Well-beloved! You were quick to change from King, of the\nKhyber Rifle Regiment, to Kurram Khan. Change now into my warrior--my\ndear lord--my King again!\"\n\nShe rose, with arms outstretched to him. All her dancer's art, her\nuntamed poetry, her witchery, were expressed in a movement. Her eyes\nmelted as they met his. And since he stood up, too, for manner's sake,\nthey were eye to eye again--almost lip to lip. Her sweet breath was in\nhis nostrils.\n\nIn another moment she was in his arms, clinging to him, kissing him. And\nif any man has felt on his lips the kiss of all the scented glamour of\nthe East, let him tell what King's sensations were. Let Ceasar, who was\nkissed by Cleopatra, come to life and talk of it!\n\nKing's arm is strong, and he did not stand like an idol. His head might\nswim, but she, too, tasted the delirium of human passion loosed and\ngiven for a mad swift minute. If his heart swelled to bursting, so must\nhers have done.\n\n\"I have needed you!\" she whispered. \"I have been all alone! I have\nneeded you!\"\n\nThen her lips sought his again, and neither spoke.\n\nNeither knew how long it was before she began to understand that he, not\nshe, was winning. The human answer to her appeal was full. He gave her\nall she asked of admiration, kiss for kiss. And then--her arms did not\ncling so tightly, although his strong right arm was like a stanchion.\nBecause he knew that he, not she, was winning, he picked her up in his\narms and kissed her as if she were a child. And then, because he knew he\nhad won, he set her on her feet on the footstool of the throne, and even\npitied her.\n\nShe felt the pity. As she tossed the hair back over her shoulder her\neyes glowed with another meaning--dangerous--like a tiger's glare.\n\n\"You pity me? You think because I love you, you can feed my love on a\nplate to the Indian government? You think my love is a weapon to use\nagainst me? Your love for me may wait for a better time? You are not so\nwise as I thought you, Athelstan!\"\n\nBut he knew he had won. His heart was singing down inside him as it had\nnot sung since he left India behind. But he stood quite humbly before\nher, for had he not kissed her?\n\n\"You think a kiss is the bond between us? You mistake! You forget! The\nkiss, my Athelstan, was the fruit, not the seed! The seed came first! If\nI loosed you--if I set you free--you would never dare go back to India!\"\n\nHe scarcely heard her. He knew he had won. His heart was like a bird,\nfluttering wildly. He knew that the next step would be shown him, and\nfor the present he had time and grace to pity her, knowing how he would\nhave felt if she had won. Besides, he had kissed her, and he had not\nlied. Each kiss had been a tribute of admiration, for was she not\nsplendid--amazing--more to be desired than wine? He stood with bowed\nhead, lest the triumph in his eyes offend her. Yet if any one had asked\nhim how he knew that he had won, he never could have told.\n\n\"If you were to go back to India except as its conqueror, they would\nstrip the buttons from your uniform and tear your medals off and shoot\nyou in the back against a wall! My signature is known in India and I am\nknown. What I write will be believed. Rewa Gunga shall take a letter.\nHe shall take two--four--witnesses. He shall see them on their way and\nshall give them the letter when they reach the Khyber and shall send\nthem into India with it. Have no fear. Bull-with-a-beard shall not\nintercept them, as I have intercepted his men. When Rewa Gunga shall\nreturn and tell me he saw my letter on its way down the Khyber, then we\nshall talk again about pity--you and I! Come!\"\n\nShe took his arm, as if her threats had been caresses. Triumph shone\nfrom her eyes. She tossed her brave chin and laughed at him, only\nencouraged to greater daring by his attitude.\n\n\"Why don't you kill me?\" she asked, and though his answer surprised her,\nit did not make her angry.\n\n\"It would do no good,\" he said simply.\n\n\"Would you kill me if you thought it would do good?\"\n\n\"Certainly!\" he said.\n\nShe laughed at that as if it were the greatest joke she had ever heard.\nIt set her in the best humor possible, and by the time they reached the\nebony table and she had taken the pen and dipped it in the ink, she was\nchuckling to herself as if the one good joke had grown into a hundred.\n\nShe wrote in Urdu. It is likely that for all her knowledge of the spoken\nEnglish tongue she was not so swift or ready with the trick of writing\nit. She had said herself that a babu read English books to her aloud.\nBut she wrote in Urdu with an easy flowing hand, and in two minutes she\nhad thrown sand on the letter and had given it to King to read. It was\nnot like a woman's letter. It did not waste a word.\n\n        \"Your Captain King has been too much trouble.  He has\n        taken money from the Germans.  He adopted native dress.\n        He called himself Kurram Khan.  He slew his own brother\n        at night in the Khyber Pass.  These men will say that\n        he carried the head to Khinjan, and their word is true,\n        for I, Yasmini, saw.  He used the head for a passport,\n        to obtain admittance.  He proclaims a jihad!  He urges\n        invasion of India!  He held up his brother's head\n        before five thousand men and boasted of the murder.\n        The next you shall hear of your Captain King of the\n        Khyber Rifles, he will be leading a jihad into India.\n        You would have better trusted me.  Yasmini.\"\n\nHe read it and passed it back to her.\n\n\"They will not disbelieve me,\" she said, triumphant as the very devil\nover a branded soul all hot. \"They will be sure you are mad, and they\nwill believe the witnesses!\"\n\nHe bowed. She sealed the letter and addressed it with only a scrawled\nmark on its outer cover. That, by the way, was utter insolence, for the\nmark would be understood at any frontier post by the officer commanding.\n\n\"Rewa Gunga shall start with this to-day!\" she said, with more amusement\nthan malice. After that she was still for a moment, watching his eyes,\nat a loss to understand his carelessness. He seemed strangely unabased.\nHis folded arms were not defiant, but neither were they yielding.\n\n\"I love you, Athelstan!\" she said. \"Do you love me?\"\n\n\"I think you are very beautiful, Princess!\"\n\n\"Beautiful? I know I am beautiful. But is that all?\"\n\n\"Clever!\" he added.\n\nShe began to drum with the golden dagger hilt on the table, and to\nlook dangerous, which is not to infer by any means that she looked less\nlovely.\n\n\"Do you love me?\" she asked.\n\n\"Forgive me, Princess, but you forget. I was born east of Mecca, but my\nfolk were from the West. We are slower to love than some other nations.\nWith us love is more often growth, less often surrender at first sight.\nI think you are wonderful.\"\n\nShe nodded and tucked the sealed letter in her bosom.\n\n\"It shall go,\" she said darkly, \"and another letter with it. They looted\nyour brother's body. In his pocket they found the note you wrote him,\nand that you asked him to destroy! That will be evidence. That will\nconvince! Come!\"\n\nHe followed her through leather curtains again and down the dark\npassage into the outer chamber; and the illusion was of walking behind a\ngolden-haired Madonna to some shrine of Innocence. Her perfume was like\nincense; her manner perfect reverence. She passed into the cave where\nthe two dead bodies lay like a high priestess performing a rite.\n\nWalking to the bed, she stood for minutes, gazing at the Sleeper and\nhis queen. And from the new angle from which King saw him the Sleeper's\nlikeness to himself was actually startling. Startling--weird--like an\nincantation were Yasmini's words when at last she spoke.\n\n\"Muhammad lied! He lied in his teeth! His sons have multiplied his lie!\nSiddhattha, whom men have called Gotama, the Buddha, was before Muhammad\nand he knew more! He told of the wheel of things, and there is a wheel!\nYet, what knew the Buddha of the wheel? He who spoke of Dharma (the\ncustoms of the law) not knowing Dharma! This is true---Of old there was\na wish of the gods--of the old gods. And so these two were. There is a\nwish again now of the old gods. So, are we two not as they two were? It\nis the same wish, and lo! We are ready, this man and I. We will obey, ye\ngods--ye old gods!\"\n\nShe raised her arms and, going closer to the bed, stood there in an\nattitude of mystic reverence, giving and receiving blessings.\n\n\"Dear gods!\" she prayed. \"Dear old gods--older than these 'Hills'--show\nme in a vision what their fault was--why these two were ended before the\nend!\n\n\"I know all the other things ye have shown me. I know the world's silly\ncreeds have made it mad, and it must rend itself, and this man and I\nshall reap where the nations sowed--if only we obey! Wherein, ye old\ndear gods, who love me, did these two disobey? I pray you, tell me in a\nvision!\"\n\nShe shook her head and sighed. Sadness seemed to have crept over her,\nlike a cold mist from the night. It was as if she could dimly see her\nplans foredoomed, and yet hoped on in spite of it. The fatalism that she\nscorned as Muhammad's lie held her in its grip, and her natural courage\nfought with it. Womanlike, she turned to King in that minute and\nconfided to him her very inmost thoughts. And he, without an inkling as\nto how she must fail, yet knew that she must, and pitied her.\n\n\"Have you seen that breast under the armor?\" she asked suddenly. \"Come\nnearer! Come and look! Why did his breast decay and his body stay whole\nlike hers? Did she kill him? Was that a dagger-stab in his breast? I\nfound perfume in these caves--great jars of it, and I use it always.\nIt is better than temple incense and all the breath of gardens in\nthe spring! I have put it on slaughtered animals. Where the knife has\ntouched them, they decay--as that man's breast did--but the rest of\nthem remains undecaying year after year. It was a knife, I think, that\npierced his breast. I think that scent is the preservative. Did she kill\nhim? Was she jealous of him? How did she die? There is no mark on her!\nAthelstan--listen! I think he would have failed her! I think she stabbed\nhim rather than see him fail, and then swallowed poison! Afterward their\nservants laid them there. She smiles in death because she knew the wheel\nwill turn and that death dies too! He looks grim because he knew less\nthan she. It is always woman who understands and man who fails! I think\nshe stabbed him. She should have loved him better, and then there would\nhave been no need. I will love you better than she loved him!\"\n\nShe turned and devoured him with her eyes, so that it needed all his\nmanhood to hold him back from being her slave that minute. For in that\nminute she left no charm unexercised--sex--mesmerisrn--beauty--flattery\n(her eyes could flatter as a dumb dog's flatter a huntsman!)--grace\nunutterable-mystery--she used every art on him she knew. Yet he stood\nthe test.\n\n\"Even if you fail me, Well-beloved, I will love you! The gods who gave\nyou to me will know how to make you love; and lessons are to learn. If\nyou fail me I will forgive, knowing that in the end the gods will never\nlet you fail me! You are mine, and Earth is ours, for the old gods\nintend it so!\"\n\nShe seemed to expect him to take her in his arms again; but he stood\nrespectfully and made no answer, nor any move. Grim and strong his jowl\nwas, like the Sleeper's, and the dark hair three days old on it softened\nnothing of its lines. His Roman nose and steady, dark, full eyes\nsuggested no compromise. Yet he was good to look at. She had not lied\nwhen she said she loved him, and he understood her and was sorry. But he\ndid not look sorry, nor did he offer any argument to quench her love. He\nwas a servant of the raj; his life and his love had been India's\nsince the day he first buckled on his spurs, and Yasmini wouldn't have\nunderstood that.\n\nNor did she understand that, even supposing he had loved her with\nall his heart, not on any conditions would he have admitted it until\nabsolutely free, any more than that if she crucified him he would love\nher the same, supposing that he loved her at all. Nor did she trust the\n\"old gods\" too well, or let them work unaided.\n\n\"Come with me, Athelstan!\" she said. She took his arm--found little\njeweled slippers in a closet hewn in the wall--put them on and led him\nto the curtains he had entered by. She led him through them, and, red as\ncardinals in lamplight on the other side, they stood hand-in-hand, back\nto the leather, facing the unfathomable dark. Her fingers were so strong\nthat he could not have wrenched his own away without using the other\nhand to help.\n\n\"Where are your shoes?\" she asked him.\n\n\"At the foot of these steps, Princess.\"\n\n\"Can you see them yonder in the dark?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Can you guess where the darkness leads to?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHe shuddered and she chuckled.\n\n\"Could you return alone by the way Ismail brought you?\"\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"Will you try?\"\n\n\"If I must. I am not afraid.\"\n\n\"You have heard the echo? Yes, I know you heard the echo. Hear it\nagain!\"\n\nShe raised her head and howled like a wolf--like a lone wolf that has\nfound no quarry--melancholy, mean, grown reckless with his hunger. There\nwas a pause of nearly a minute. Then in the hideous darkness a phantom\nwolf-pack took up the howl in chorus, and for three long minutes there\nwas din beside which the voice of living wolves at war would be a\nslumber song. Ten times ghastlier than if it had been real, the chorus\nwailed and ululated back and forth along immeasurable distances--became\none yell again--and went howling down into earth's bowels as if the last\nof a phantom pack were left behind and yelling to be waited for.\n\nWhen it ceased at last King was sweating.\n\n\"Nor am I afraid,\" she laughed, squeezing his hand yet tighter.\n\nShe led him down the steps, and at the foot told him to put on his\nslippers, as if he were a child. Then, hurrying as if those opal eyes\nof hers were indifferent to dark or daylight, she picked her way among\nboulders that he could feel but not see, along a floor that was only\nsmooth in places, for a distance that was long enough by two or three\ntimes to lose him altogether.\n\nWhen he looked back there was no sign of red lights behind him. And when\nhe looked forward, there was a dim outer light in front and a whiff of\nthe cool fresh air that presages the dawn!\n\nShe led him through a gap on to a ledge of rock that hung thousands of\nfeet above the home of thunder, a ledge less than six feet wide, less\nthan twenty long, tilted back toward the cliff. There they sat, watching\nthe stars. And there they saw the dawn come.\n\nMorning looks down into Khinjan hours after the sun has risen, because\nthe precipices shut it out. But the peaks on every side are very beacons\nof the range at the earliest peep of dawn. In silence they watched day's\nherald touch the peaks with rosy jeweled fingers--she waiting as if she\nexpected the marvel of it all to make King speak.\n\nIt was cold. She came and snuggled close to him, and it was so they\nwatched the sparkle of dawn's jewels die and the peaks grow gray again,\nshe with an arm on his shoulder and strands of her golden hair blown\npast his face.\n\n\"Of what are you thinking?\" she asked him at last.\n\n\"Of India, Princess.\"\n\n\"What of India?\"\n\n\"She lies helpless.\"\n\n\"Ah! You love India?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You shall love me better! You shall love me better than your life!\nThen, for love of me, you shall own the India you think you love! This\nletter shall go!\" She tapped her bosom. \"It is best to cut you off from\nIndia first. You shall lose that you may win!\"\n\nShe got up and stood in the gap, smiling mockingly, framed in the\ndarkness of the cave behind.\n\n\"I understand!\" she said. \"You think you are my enemy. Love and hate\nnever lived side by side. You shall see!\"\n\nThen in an instant she was gone, backward into the dark. He sat and\nwaited for her, cross-legged on the ledge. As daylight began to filter\ndownward he could dimly make out the waterfall, thundering like the\nwhelming of a world; he sat staring at it, trying to formulate a plan,\nuntil it dawned on him that he was nearly chilled to the bone. Then he\ngot up and stepped through the gap, too.\n\n\"Princess!\" he called. Then louder, \"Princess!\"\n\nWhen the echo of his own voice died, it was as if the ghoul who made the\nechoes had taken shape. A beard--red eye-rims--and a hook nose came out\nof the dark, and Ismail bared yellow teeth.\n\n\"Come!\" he said. \"Come, little hakim!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XV\n\n\n\n     Private preserves?  New Notions?\n     Measure me a quart of honesty,\n     And I will trade it for a pound weight of my thoughts.\n     Then you and I shall go and dream together\n     A brand-new dream of things that never happened,\n     Nor ever can be.  Come, trade with me!\n\n\nWhat Yasmini had been doing in the minutes while King stared from the\nledge in the dawn was unguessable. Perhaps she had been praying to\nher old gods. At least she had given Ismail strict orders, for he said\nnothing, but seized King's hand and led him through the dark as a rat\nleads a blind one--swiftly, surely, unhesitating. King had no means\nwhatever of guessing their direction. They did not pass the two lights\nagain with the curtain and the steps all glowing red.\n\nThey came instead to other steps, narrow and steep, that led upward in a\nsemicircle to a rough hole in a rock wall. At the top there was a little\nyellow light, so dim and small that its rays scarcely sufficed to show\nthe opening.\n\n\"Go up!\" said Ismail, giving King a shove and disappearing at once. One\nside-step into blackness and he might have been a mile away.\n\nSo King went up, stooping to feel each next footing with a cautious\nhand. He was beginning to be sleepy, and to suspect that Yasmini had\ntaken him to view the dawn with just that end in view. Nothing can make\ntired eyes so long for sleep as a glimpse of waking day--Sleepy eyes are\neasiest to trick.\n\nIt was not many minutes before he was sure his guess was right.\n\nThe opening at the head of the stairs led into a tunnel. He followed\nit with a hand on either wall and reached another of Khinjan's strange\nleather curtains. His face struck the leather unexpectedly, and at that\ninstant, as if his touch were electric, the curtain sprang aside and his\neyes were dazzled by the light of diamonds.\n\nIt was Aladdin's Cave, with her acting spirit of the lamp! It needed\neffort of self-control to know that the huge, white, cut crystals that\nsparkled all about the hewn cell could not be diamonds. They were as big\nas his head, and bigger--at least a hundred of them, and they multiplied\nthe light of half a dozen little oil lamps until the cave seemed the\nhome of light.\n\nYasmini had not a jewel on her. She was in a new mood and new garments\nto suit it. Her feet were still bare, but she was robed from head to\nheel in pure white linen, on which her long hair shone as if it were\ntruly strands of gold. She received him with an air of mystic calm,\ngracious and dignified as the high-priestess of a Grecian temple. She\nseemed devout--to have forgotten that she ever killed a man, or made a\nthreat or plotted for a kingdom.\n\n\"Be still,\" she said, raising a finger. \"The old gods talk to us in\nhere. It is not for us to answer them in words, but in deeds. Let us\nlisten and do!\"\n\nThere were two cushions--great billowy modern ones, covered in gold\nbrocade--on the floor in the midst of the cave. Between them was a stand\nof ivory, some two feet high, whose top was a disk, cut from the largest\ntusk that ever could have been. On the disk resting in a little hollow\nin the ivory, was a pure, perfect crystal sphere of a foot diameter.\nHe could see his reflection in it, and Yasmini's, too, the moment he\nentered the cave, and whichever way they moved both images remained\nundistorted. He suspected that the lighting and the crystal reflectors\nhad not been arranged at random.\n\nIn each corner of the four-square cave there was a brazier of bronze,\nand from each rose incense smoke, straight upward. The four streams of\nsmoke met at the ceiling and converged into a cloud that hung almost\nmotionless.\n\nYasmini stepped very reverently to a cushion by the crystal in the\nmiddle, and signed to King to imitate her. They stood facing. She seemed\nto pray, for her eyes were hidden under the long lashes. Then she knelt,\nand King did the same, his knees sinking deep into another cushion. So\nthey knelt eye to eye above the crystal for many minutes without either\nsaying a word. It was Yasmini who spoke first.\n\n\"The old gods have showed me the past many and many a time in this,\" she\nsaid. \"It is, their way of speaking to me. Now, to-day, I have prayed to\nthem to show me the future. Look! Look, Athelstan! Do as I do--so!\"\n\nThere seemed nothing to be gained by disobeying her. To obey her might\nbe to win new insight into the ramifications of her plans. Men who have\nexperience of the East are the last to deny that there is method in\nEastern magic; they glimpse the knowledge that belonged to Pharaoh's\nmen, although unlike Moses they are not always able to confound it. The\nEast forgets nothing. The West ignores. But there are men from the West\nwho are willing to look and to listen and to try to understand; like\nKing, they go high in the Service. There are others who look on at the\nmagic with an understanding eye and are caught by it. Their end is not\ngood to contemplate. The East is fettered in her own mesmeric spell and\nmust suffer until she wakes.\n\nYasmini held the upright column of the ivory stand with both hands,\nclose under the disk at the top. He copied her, placing his hands below\nhers. Hers slipped down and covered his, soft and warm; and so they\nstayed.\n\n\"Look!\" she said. \"Look!\"\n\nHer own eyes were grown big and round, and she gazed at the crystal ball\nas she had looked into King's eyes that night, with the very hunger of\nher soul. Her lips were parted. Watching her, King grew expectant, too.\nHis eyes followed hers, to stare into the middle of the crystal, no\nlonger feeling sleepy, and in less than a minute he could not have\nwithdrawn them had he tried.\n\nThe crystal clouded over. Yasmini's breath came steadily, with a little\nhissing sound between her teeth, and the crystal, or else the whole\nworld, seemed to sway in time to it. Then the man in Roman armor strode\nout of a mist, and all was steady again and easy to understand. When the\nman in armor opened his lips to speak, one knew what he had said. When\nbe frowned, one knew why he frowned. When he smiled, one knew that she\nwas coming.\n\nAnd she did come, dancing out of the mist behind him, to fling soft arms\nround his neck and whisper praises in his ear. He stood like a king who\nhas come into his own, with an arm round her and his chin held high. She\nkissed him on his proud chin, and laughed into his face.\n\nThere were troubles--difficulties, all in the mist behind, but he stood\nand despised them then while she caressed him!\n\nJust as spoken words had no part in the vision, yet the whole was\nunderstood, so time did not enter into it. There was no connecting link\nbetween each scene; each dissolved into the other, and all were one.\n\nShe faded into mist, in a swirl of graceful drapery, and he frowned\nagain. A long line of men-at-arms stood before him, grim as he and as\ndiscontented. They leaned on spears, at ease, and that seemed to annoy\nhim most of all. A spokesman stood out from the ranks and addressed him,\nwith gesticulations and a head so far thrown back that his helmet-plume\nstood out like a secretary's pen behind him. He was not a Roman,\nalthough there was something Roman about his attitude and armor. None of\nthe men-at-arms was a Roman.\n\nThey demanded to be led home, wherever home was. (It was as plain as if\ntheir spokesman had shouted it into King's ear aloud.) And he refused\nthem bluntly, proudly.\n\nTwo men brought him a native woman, each holding an arm and thrusting\nher forward between them. She was not at all unlike a native woman of\nto-day, either in dress or sullenness; she had the beak and the keen\neyes and the cruel lips of the \"Hills.\" They showed her to him, and it\nwas quite clear that they compared her to their own women, left behind;\nthe comparison was plainly to her disadvantage.\n\nHe wasted no argument on them, but his scorn made the two men fade away,\nand the woman with them. Yet he had no scorn for his lined-up fighting\nmen, and so could act none. He ordered the spokesman back to the ranks,\nand the man obeyed. He gave another order, and the long lines stood at\nattention, spears straight up and down, and their round sheilds like\ngreat medallions on a wall. He ordered them away, but they stood still.\n\nThen he did a truly Roman thing. He got his harness off--unbuckled and\ntook off the great bronze corselet, in which he lay dead in another\ncave. He threw it down--tore open the white shirt underneath--and held\nhis arms out. He bade them come and kill him. He bade them drive their\nspears into his unprotected breast.\n\nThere was not a movement down the line of men. They stood\nas a cliff looks at the tide. He dared them. He called them\ncowards--women--weaklings afraid of blood. But they stood still. He\nstrode up and down the line, seeking a man with heart enough to plunge a\nspear into him, and no man moved.\n\nThen he stood still before them all again and wept, because they loved\nhim and he loved them. And then she came, not dancing this time, but\nbarefooted and walking like a poem of the early days of Greece. She\npicked up his corselet and buckled it on him, making him hold up\nhis arms and kneel while she slipped it over his head. And the grim\nmen-at-arms hove their long spears up into the air and roared her an\novation, bringing down their right feet with a thunder all together.\n\n\"Ave!\"\n\nBut the mist closed up and then the crystal was clear again. It was\nYasmini's voice that spoke, King looked up into her eyes, and they\nmade him shudder, for he had never seen eyes like them. Her hands still\nclasped his own, burning hot. She was more terrible than Khinjan.\n\n\"I never saw that before,\" she said. \"It is because you are here! We\nshall see it all now! We shall know it all! We shall know whether it\nwas she who killed him, or whether his own men took him at his word. We\nshall know! Look again! Look again!\"\n\nHis eyes seemed unable to obey his own will any longer. They obeyed\nher voice. He gazed again into the crystal, and it clouded over. But\nalthough he obeyed her, the crystal obeyed him and answered at least in\npart the questions his imagination asked. He was not conscious of asking\nanything, but being a soldier his curiosity followed a more or less\ndefinite line.\n\nYasmini's breath began to come and go again with the little hissing\nsound. Her hot hands pressed his own. The mist suddenly dissolved. There\nwas a road--a long white road, across a plain, and the men-at-arms\nfought their way along it. They were facing east.\n\nArchers opposed them--archers on foot, and cavalry--Parthians. The\nParthians were wild, but the drill of the men-at-arms was a thing to\nmarvel at. When the flights of arrows came they knelt behind their\nshields. When the horsemen charged they closed in solid phalanx, and\nthe inner ranks hurled javelins at ten-yard range. When the fury of the\nonslaught died they formed in column and went forward, gaining furlongs\nat a time while their enemy watched them and wondered.\n\nIt was plain that the enemy expected them to retreat sooner or later,\nfor the archers and cavalry were at great pains to get behind them, so\nthat before long the road ahead was less well defended than that behind.\nIt did not seem to occur to the enemy that they were pressing toward the\ndistant line of hills and did not seek to return at all.\n\nThey had no baggage to impede them. It was absurd to suppose they would\nnot try to fight a way back soon. They must be a Roman raiding party,\nout to teach Parthians a lesson. Yet they pressed ever forward, and the\nhills grew ever nearer; while he sat a great brown charger calmly in\ntheir midst and gave them not too many orders, but here and there a word\nof praise, and once or twice a trumpet shout of encouragement. He seemed\nto own the knack of being wherever the fight was fiercest. His mere\npresence seemed better than a hundred men when the phalanx bent before\ncharging cavalry.\n\nShe rode a little white horse, beside him always and utterly scornful\nof the risk. She wore no armor--carried no shield. Her bare feet showed\nthrough the sandal straps, and the outlines of her lissom body were\nquite visible through the muslin stuff she wore. She might have just\ncome from the dancing. She had a flower in her hand, and a wreath of\nflowers in her hair. She shouted more encouragement than he. She shouted\ntoo much. Once he laid a strong brown hand across her mouth, and she\nheld it there and kissed it.\n\nThey lost men--five or six or ten or twenty at each onslaught. Perhaps\nthey had been a thousand strong in the beginning. Their own men--the\nregimental surgeons probably--cut the throats of the badly wounded, to\nsave them from the enemy's attentions; and by this time they were not\nmore than seven or eight hundred strong.\n\nBut they went forward--ever forward--and the line of hills drew near.\nThen he began to stir himself, and she with him. He shouted to them to\ncharge, and she echoed him, leaving his side at last to take command\nof a wing and sting the tired-out men-at-arms into new enthusiasm. In\na minute they were a roaring tide that swept forward to the foot of the\nhills and surged upward without a check. In a little while they were\nhurling boulders down on an enemy that seemed inclined to parley.\n\nThen, like a shadow of the incense cloud above, the mist closed up in\nthe crystal again, and in a moment more King and Yasmini were looking\ninto each other's eyes again above it.\n\n\"I have seen that before,\" she said, shaking her, head. \"I am weary of\ntheir battles. They won; that is enough! I must know how they failed, so\nthat we make no such mistakes!\"\n\nHer face was flushed, and her eyes glowed with the fire that is not lit\nby ordinary passion. She was being eaten by ambition--burned by her own\nfire--by ambition not totally selfish, for she yearned to shepherd King\nas she seemed to think this woman of the vision had not shepherded the\nman in armor.\n\n\"Look again!\" she said. \"Look again! And oh, ye old gods, show--show me\nwherein she failed!\"\n\nThey stared again, and once more the crystal clouded. Out of the cloud\ncame a city in the middle of a plain, and the city was besieged. It was\nnot a very great city, but from the outside it looked rich, for domes\nand roofs and towers showed above the wall, all well built and well\npreserved. He and she, sitting their horses out of arrow range from the\nmain gate seemed confident of taking it and eager to get it over with.\n\nThey no longer had only six or seven hundred men, but men by the\nthousand. Their veterans in Roman armor were in command of others now,\nand they had a human pack-train with them, heavily burdened captives who\nsulked in chains under a guard.\n\nThe mist cleared further, and the gate gave in under the blows of an\nimprovised battering-ram, covered by showers of arrows from short\nrange. Then, like a river breaking down a dam, the thousands stormed in,\nhowling. Smoke rose. There were screams of women. A great tower near the\ngate, that was half wood, half stone, crackled and curled up in yellow\nand crimson flame. He and she rode in together as modern men and women\nride through a gate to the covert side at a fox-hunt. They chatted and\nlaughed together, and their horses pranced, responding to the humor of\ntheir riders.\n\nKing would have liked to tear his eyes away from the scenes that\nfollowed in the tree-lined streets, but the crystal ball held him as\nif in a trance--that and Yasmini's hands that clasped his own like hot\ntorture chamber clamps. Animals fighting to the death are not so vile,\nnor so inhuman as men can be in the hour of what they call victory. Even\nthe little children of that city paid the penalty for having closed the\ngate.\n\nTime was no measure to the crystal ball. In minutes it showed the\ndevil's work of hours. The city went up in smoke and flame, and from\nthe far side through a great breach in the wall the conquerors went\nout, with their plunder and such prisoners as had been saved to drag and\ncarry it.\n\nNow there were wagons and camels and horses. Now there were tents and\nfurniture. Now each man of the fighting force had as much as he himself\ncould carry, as well as what was loaded on the prisoners.\n\nOnly he and she seemed to care nothing for the loot and rode as if each\nwas all the other needed. Still he wore nothing but his armor, and\nshe no more than her dancing dress and sandals. But now she had eight\nprisoners to hold a panoply above her horse and keep the sun from her.\n\nShe had flowers woven in her hair, and others in her hand, as if she\nrode from a bridal feast and were not in mourning for a plundered,\nbutchered city. They were headed northward now, toward distant\nmountains, and the dust of their long column went up like a river of\nsmoke, flowing from the holocaust behind.\n\nYasmini shook her head impatiently. The crystal clouded over, and King's\neyes were free.\n\n\"I am tired of it,\" she said. \"I have seen that so many times. I know\nthey won. I know they found their way to Khinjan. I know they began to\nbuild an empire here. I have seen all that a hundred times. What I must\nknow is what mistake they made. What did they do wrong? How did they\ncome to fail? Look again! Let us look again!\"\n\nShe never once let King's hands go, but pressed them tighter and\ntighter until the circulation nearly stopped and they grew numb. Her own\nstrength seemed endless--to grow rather than to wane in proportion as\nher yearning to look into the past grew. Her attitude would have\nbeen more understandable if she had believed herself and King to be\nreincarnations of those forgotten conquerors; but she was too original\nfor that. She had said the old gods wished, and the man and the woman\nwere; the old gods wished the same wish again, and she and King were.\nWhy then, if the old gods were contriving it all, should she seek to\nsteady the ark for them? But down at bottom there is no logic connected\nwith gods many. She clutched King's fingers as if to hold him there, and\nto make him see and understand the distant past, were the only way to\nsave him from mistakes.\n\n\"Look!\" she insisted. \"Look again!\" And he obeyed her. By this time\nobedience was much the easiest course. Between times his eyes were so\nweary he could hardly hold them open, and it was only when he gazed into\nthe crystal that he could rest them and feel easy. He knew well that\nshe was winning control over him in some sort, and he fought against it\ngrimly. Soon he became weirdly conscious of being two men--one, whom she\nhad grasped and overcome, a physical man who did not matter much, and\nanother, mental man who was free from her, who could understand her,\nwhom she could not reach or touch.\n\n\"Look!\" she insisted. \"Look!\" And the crystal clouded over.\n\nHe strode out of the mist again, frowning, with his chin hung low and\nfists clenched tight at his sides. Four of his own men came out of the\nmist to him and greeted him respectfully, yet not without a touch of\nirony.\n\nThey spoke to him and pointed westward. One laid a hand on his shoulder,\nbut he shook it off and the man reeled back as if he had been struck.\nAnother man took up the argument, but he shook his head. They all spoke\ntogether, gesticulating and growing angry; but he stood calm among them,\nas a rock stands in a storm. He folded his arms across his breast after\na while and listened, saying nothing.\n\nThen as if to end the argument for good and all, he drew his sword and\nheld it out toward them, hilt first, telling them again to kill him\nand have done with it. They refused. He laughed at them, but they still\nrefused; so he put his sword back in the sheath.\n\nOne of the men stepped into the mist and disappeared. Presently he\ncame again, with two others, helping a wounded man along between them.\nWhoever the wounded man might be he was treated with respect. Prouder\nthan Lucifer, he who had struck another man's hand from off his shoulder\nknelt to give this wounded man a knee and seemed pained when the man\nrefused him.\n\nThe wounded man pointed to the westward too and argued in short\nclipped-off sentences. He had a day or two to live--certainly not\nlonger, for the blood flowed slowly from a wound that would not stanch;\nyet he argued as a man who has lost no interest in life, but rather sees\nits problems truly now that his own are near an end.\n\nHe demanded something almost truculently. He took his helmet off and\npassed it down to him. With fingers that were growing feeble the wounded\nman held it and traced out the letters S. P. Q. R. on the front.\n\n\"Go home!\" he said, passing it back to him. \"Fight your way back home!\"\nWhat he said was as distinct as if a voice in the cave had spoken it.\n\nThen, vision within a vision--dream within a dream--there was a view of\nthe Via Appia, with gaunt grim gallows set along it in a row and on them\na regiment's commander crucified along with the remnant of his men.\n\n\"So Rome treats traitors!\" said a voice, that might have been either\nman's.\n\nBut instantly there was another vision, of ten thousand wolves baying\ndown a Himalayan gorge in winter-time, the sleet frozen stiff on their\nfur and their tongues hanging. Eye and fang flashed altogether and made\none gleam.\n\n\"Choose!\" said a voice.\n\nSo he chose. He nodded. The men saluted him, and the wounded man was\nhelped away to die. And then she came, angry as a flash of lightning, to\nspring at him and cling to him and call him names--begging, demanding,\nordering, crying--abusing him and praising him in turn. He shook his\nhead. She sobbed, but he shook his head again and pointed westward.\nThen she took him by the hand and led him away, not looking at his face\nagain.\n\nThe crystal ball grew clouded. Yasmini's breath came and went as if she\nwere running in a race, and her pressure on King's fingers was actually\npainful. The mist dissolved, and King forgot the pressure--forgot\neverything. The man in armor lay dead on his back in the cave on the\nwooden bed, and she bent over him, dagger in hand.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Yasmini, her teeth chattering. \"But what else could she do?\"\nThe mist closed in again and the crystal grew opaque. \"The future!\" she\nbegged. \"It is the future I must know! Ye old gods, tell me! Show me!\"\n\nThe mist turned red. The crystal ball became as it were a ball of fire\nrevolving within itself. The fire turned to blood, and the blood to\nfire again. The very cavern that they knelt in seemed to sway. Yasmini\nscreamed and moaned. She loosed King's hands to cover her own eyes.\n\nAnd as she did that King sank, like a sack half-empty and toppled over\nsidewise on the floor asleep.\n\nHe neither dreamed nor was conscious of anything, but slept like a dead\nman, having fought against her mesmerism harder than he knew.\n\nStatesmen, generals, outlaws, all make their big mistakes and manage to\nrecover. Very nearly always it is an apparently little mistake that does\nmost damage in the end, something unnoticeable at the time, that grows\nin geometrical proportion, minus instead of plus.\n\nYasmini made her little mistake that minute in believing King was\nutterly mesmerized at last and utterly in her power. Whereas in truth he\nwas only weary. It may be that she gave him orders in his sleep, after\nthe accepted manner of mesmerists; but if she did, they never reached\nhim; he was far too fast asleep. He slept so deep and long that he was\nnot conscious of men's voices, nor of being carried, nor of time, nor of\nanxiety, nor of anything.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVI\n\n\n\n     Wolf met wolf in the dawning day\n     Where scent hung sweet over trodden clay,\n     And square each stood in the jungle way\n     Eyeing the other with ears laid back.\n     Still were the watchers.  When foe greets foe\n     The wisest are quietest.  Better to go--\n     Who stays to watch trouble woos trouble!\n             But lo!\n     They trotted together to hunt one doe,\n     Eyeing each other with ears laid back.\n\n\nWhen King awoke he lay on a comfortable bed in a cave he had never yet\nseen, but there was no trace of Yasmini, nor of the men who must have\ncarried him to it. Barbaric splendor and splendor that was not by any\nmeans barbaric lay all about--tiger skins, ivory-legged chairs, graven\nbronze vases, and a yak-hair shawl worth a rajah's ransom.\n\nThe cave was spacious and not gloomy, for there was a wide door,\napparently unguarded, and another square opening cut in the rock to\nserve as a window. Through both openings light streamed in like taut\nthreads of Yasmini's golden hair--strings of a golden zither, on which\nhis own heart's promptings played a tune.\n\nHe had no idea how long he had slept, but judged from memory of his\nformer need of sleep and recogntion of his present freshness--and from\nthe fact that it was a morning sun that shone through the openings--that\nhe must have slept the clock round.\n\nIt did not matter. He knew it did not matter in the least. He had\nno more plan than a mathematician has who starts to solve a problem,\nknowing that twice two is four in infinite combination. Like the\nmathematician, he knew that he must win.\n\nNo man ever won a battle or conceived a stroke of statesmanship, no\ngreat deed was ever accomplished without a first taste of the triumphant\nforeknowledge, such as comes only to men who have digged hard, hewing to\nthe line, loyal to first principles. King had been loyal all his life.\n\nThe difference between first principles and the other thing could hardly\nbe better illustrated than by comparing Yasmini's position with his.\nFrom her point of view he had no ground to stand on, unless he should\nchoose to come and stand on hers. She had men, ammunition, information.\nHe had what he stood in, and his only information had been poured into\nhis ears for her ends.\n\nYet his heart sang inside him now; and he trusted it because that\nsinging never had deceived him. He did not believe she would have left\nhim alone at that state of affairs unless through over-confidence. It\nis one of the absolute laws that over-confidence begets blindness and\nmistakes.\n\nShe had staked on what seemed to her the certainty of India's rising\nat the first signal of a holy war. She believed from close acquaintance\nthat India was utterly disloyal, having made a study of disloyalty. And\nhaving read history she knew that many a conqueror has staked on such\ncards as hers, to win for lack of a better man to take the other side.\n\nBut King had studied loyalty all his life, and he knew that besides\nbeing the home of money-lenders, thugs, and murderers, India is the very\nmotherland of chivalry; that besides sedition she breeds gentlemen with\nstout hearts; that in addition to what one Christian Book calls \"whoring\nafter strange gods\" India strives after purity. He knew that India's\nideals are all imperishable, and her crimes but a kaleidoscopic phase.\n\nNot that he was analyzing thoughts just then. He was listening to the\nstill small voice that told him half of his purpose was accomplished.\nHe had probed Khinjan Caves, and knew the whole purpose for which the\nlawless thousands had been gathering and were gathering still. Remained,\nto thwart that purpose. And he had no more doubt of there being a means\nto thwart it than a mathematician has of the result of two times two,\napplied.\n\nLike a mathematician, he did not waste time and confuse issues by\ncasting too far ahead, but began to devote himself steadily to the\nfigures nearest. Knots are not untied by wholesale, but are conquered\nstrand by strand. He began at the beginning, where he stood.\n\nHe became conscious of human life near by and tip-toed to the door to\nlook. A six-foot ledge of smooth rock ended just at the door and sloped\nin the other direction sharply downward toward another opening in the\ncliff side, three or four hundred yards away and two hundred feet lower\ndown.\n\nBehind him in a corner at the back of the cave was a narrow fissure,\nhung with a leather curtain, that was doubtless the door into Khinjan's\nheart; but the only way to the outer air was along that ledge above a\ndizzying precipice, so high that the huge waterfall looked like a little\nstream below. He was in a very eagle's aerie; the upper rim of Khinian's\ngorge seemed not more than a quarter of a mile above him.\n\nRound the corner, ten feet from the entrance, stood a guard, armed to\nthe teeth, with a rifle, a sword, two pistols and a long curved Khyber\nknife stuck handy in his girdle. He spoke to the man and received no\nanswer. He picked up a splinter of rock and threw it. The fellow looked\nat him then. He spoke again. The man transferred his rifle to the other\nhand and made signs with his free fingers. King looked puzzled. The man\nopened his mouth and showed that his tongue was missing. He had been\nmade dumb, as pegs are made to fit square holes. King went in again, to\nwait on events and shudder.\n\nNor did he have long to wait. There came a sound of grunting, up the\nrock path. Then footsteps. Then a hoarse voice, growling orders. He went\nout again to look, and beheld a little procession of women, led by\na man. The man was armed, but the women were burdened with his own\nbelongings--the medicine chest--his saddle and bridle--his unrifled\nmule-pack--and, wonder of wonders! the presents Khinjan's sick had given\nhim, including money and weapons. They came past the dumb man on guard\nand laid them all at King's feet just inside the cave.\n\nHe smiled, with that genial, face-transforming smile of his that has so\noften melted a road for him through sullen crowds. But the man in charge\nof the women did not grin. He was suffering. He growled at the women,\nand they went away like obedient animals, to sit half-way down the ledge\nand await further orders. He himself made as if to follow them, and the\ndumb man on guard did not pay much attention; he let women and man pass\nbehind him, stepping one pace forward toward the edge to make more room.\nThat was his last entirely voluntary act in this world.\n\nWith a suddenness that disarmed all opposition the other humped himself\nagainst the wall and bucked into the dumb man's back, sending him,\nweapons and all, hurtling over the precipice. With a wild effort to\nrecover, and avenge himself, and do his duty, the victim fired his\nrifle, that was ready cocked. The bullet struck the rock above and\neither split or shook a great fragment loose, that hurtled down after\nhim, so that he and the stone made a race of it for the waterfall and\nthe caverns into which the water tumbled thousands of feet away. The\nother ruffian spat after him, and then walked back to where King stood.\n\n\"Now heal me my boils!\" he said, grinning at last, doubtless from\npleasure at the prospect. He was the same man who had stood on guard at\nthe \"guest-cave\" when Ismail led King out to see the Cavern of Earth's\nDrink.\n\nThe temptation was to fling the brute after his victim. The temptation\nalways is to do the wrong thing--to cap wrath with wrath, injustice with\nvengeance. That way wars begin and are never ended. King beckoned\nhim into the cave, and bent over the chest of medical supplies. Then,\nfinding the light better for his purpose at the entrance, he called the\nman back and made him sit down on the box.\n\nThe business of lancing boils is not especially edifying in itself; but\nthat particular minor operation probably saved India. But for hope of\nit the man with boils would never have stood two turns on guard hand\nrunning and let the relief sleep on; so he would not have been on duty\nwhen the message came to carry King's belongings to his new cave of\nresidence. There would have been no object in killing the dumb man and\nso there would have been an expert with a loaded rifle to keep Muhammad\nAnim lurking down the trail.\n\nMuhammad Anim came--like the devil to scotch King's faith. He had\nfollowed the women with the loads. He stood now, like a big bear on a\nmountain track, swaying his head from side to side six feet away from\nKing, watching the boils succumb to treatment. He grunted when the job\nwas finished, and King jumped, nearly driving the lance into a new place\nin his patient's neck.\n\n\"Let him go!\" growled Muhammad Anim. \"Go thou! Stand guard over the\nwomen until I come!\"\n\nThe mullah turned a rifle this way and that in his paws, like a great\nbear dancing. The Mahsudi with a sore neck could have shot him perhaps,\nbut there are men with whom only the bravest dare try conclusions. In\ncold gray dawn it would have needed a martinet to make a firing squad\ndo execution on Muhammad Anim, even with his hands tied and his back\nagainst a wall. A man whose boils had just been lanced was no match for\nhim at all, even in broad daylight. The Hillman slunk away and did as he\nwas told.\n\n\"What meant thy message?\" growled the mullah. \"There came a Pathan to me\nin the Cavern of Earth's Drink with word that yonder sits a hakim. What\nof it?\"\n\nKing had almost forgotten the message he had sent to Muhammad Anim in\nthe Cavern of Earth's Drink. But that was not why his eyes looked past\nthe mullah's now, nor why he did not answer. The mullah did not look\nround, for he knew what was happening.\n\nThe very Orakzai Pathan who had sat next King in the Cavern of Earth's\nDrink, and who had carried the message for him, was creeping up behind\nthe women and already had his rifle leveled at the man with boils.\n\n\"Aye!\" said the mullah, watching King's eyes. \"He has done well, and the\nroad is clear!\"\n\nThe man with boils offered no fight. He dropped his rifle and threw his\nhands up. In a moment the Orakzai Pathan was in command of two rifles,\nholding them in one hand and nodding and making signs to King from\namong the women, whom he seemed to regard as his plunder too. The women\nappeared supremely indifferent in any event. King nodded back to him.\nA friend is a friend in the \"Hills,\" and rare is the man who spares his\nenemy.\n\n\"Why send that message to me?\" asked Muhammad Anim.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked King. \"If none know where the hakim is, how shall the\nhakim earn a living?\"\n\n\"None comes to earn a living in the Hills,\" growled the mullah, swaying\nhis head slowly and devouring King with cruel calculating eyes. \"Why art\nthou here?\"\n\n\"I slew a man,\" said King.\n\n\"Thou liest! It was my men who got the head that let thee in! Speak! Why\nart thou here?\"\n\nBut King did not answer. The mullah resumed.\n\n\"He who brought me the message yesterday says he has it from another,\nwho had it from a third, that thou art here because she plans a\nsimultaneous rising in India, and thou art from the Punjab where the\nSikhs all wait to rise. Is that true?\"\n\n\"Thy man said it,\" answered King.\n\n\"What sayest thou?\" the mullah asked.\n\n\"I say nothing,\" said King.\n\n\"Then hear me!\" said the mullah. \"Listen, thou.\" But he did not begin\nto speak yet. He tried to see past King into the cave and to peer about\ninto the shadows.\n\n\"Where is she?\" he asked. \"Her man Rewa Gunga went yesterday, with three\nmen and a letter to carry, down the Khyber. But where is she?\"\n\nSo he had slept the clock round! King did not answer. He blocked the way\ninto the cave and looked past the mullah at a sight that fascinated, as\na serpent's eyes are said to fascinate a bird. But the mullah, who knew\nperfectly well what must be happening, did not trouble to turn his head.\n\nThe Orakzai Pathan crouched among the women, and the women grinned. The\nMahsudi, having surrendered and considering himself therefore absolved\nfrom further responsibility at least for the present, spat over the\nprecipice and fingered gingerly the sore place where his boils had been.\nHe yawned and dropped both hands to his side; and it was at that instant\nthat the Pathan sprang at him.\n\nWith arms like the jaws of a vise he pinned the Mahsudi's to his side,\nand lifted him from off his feet. The fellow screamed, and the Pathan\nshouted \"Ho!\" But he did no murder yet. He let his victim grow fully\nconscious of the fate in store for him, holding him so that his frantic\nkicks were squandered on thin air. He turned him slowly, until he was\nupside-down; and so, perpendicular, face-outward, he hove him forward\nlike a dead log. He stood and watched his victim fall two or three\nthousand feet before troubling to turn and resume both rifles; and it\nwas not until then, as if he had been mentally conscious of each move,\nthat the mullah turned to look, and seeing only one man nodded.\n\n\"Good!\" he grunted. \"'Shabash!\"' (Well done!)\n\nThen he turned his head to stare into King's face, with the scrutiny of\na trader appraising loot. Fire leaped up behind his calculating eyes.\nAnd without a word passing between them, King knew that this man as well\nas Yasmini was in possession of the secret of the Sleeper. Perhaps he\nknew it first; perhaps she snatched the keeping of the secret from him.\nAt all events he knew it and recognized King's likeness to the Sleeper,\nfor his eyes betrayed him. He began to stroke his beard monotonously\nwith one hand. The rifle, that he pretended to be holding, really leaned\nagainst his back and with the free hand he was making signals.\n\nKing knew well he was making signals. But he knew too that in Yasmini's\npower, her prisoner, he had no chance at all of interfering with her\nplans. Having grounded on the bottom of impotence, so to speak, any tide\nthat would take him off must be a good tide. He pretended to be aware of\nnothing, and to be particularly unaware that the Pathan, with a rifle in\neach hand, was pretending to come casually up the path.\n\nIn a minute he was covered by a rifle. In another minute the mullah had\nlashed his hands. In five minutes more the women were loaded again with\nhis belongings and they were all half-way down the track in single file,\nthe mullah bringing up the rear, descending backward with rifle ready\nagainst surprise, as if he expected Yasmini and her men to pounce out\nany minute to the rescue.\n\nThey entered a tunnel and wound along it, stepping at short intervals\nover the bodies of three stabbed sentries. The Pathan spurned them with\nhis heel as he passed. In the glare at the tunnel's mouth King tripped\nover the body of a fourth man and fell with his chin beyond the edge of\na sheer precipice.\n\nThey were on a ledge above the waterfall again, having come through\na projection on the cliff's side, for Khinjan is all rat-runs and\nprojections, like a sponge or a hornet's nest on a titanic scale.\n\nThe Pathan laughed and came back to gather him like a sheaf of corn. The\ngreat smelly ruffian hugged him to himself as he set him on his feet.\n\n\"Ah! Thou hakim!\" he grinned. \"There is no pain in my shoulder at all!\nAsk of me another favor when the time comes! Hey, but I am sick of\nKhinjan!\"\n\nHe gave King a shove along the path in the general direction of the\nmullah. Then he seized the dead body by the legs, and hurled it like a\nsling shot, watching it with a grin as it fell in a wide parabola. After\nthat he took the dead man's rifle, and those of the three other dead\nmen, that he had hidden in a crevice in the rock, and loaded them all on\na woman in addition to King's saddle that she carried already.\n\n\"Come!\" he said. \"Hurry, or Bull-with-a-beard yonder will remember us\nagain. I love him best when he forgets!\"\n\nThey soon reached another cave, at which the mullah stopped. It was a\ndark ill-smelling hole, but he ordered King into it and the Pathan after\nhim on guard, after first seeing the women pile all their loads\ninside. Then he took the women away and went off muttering to himself,\nswaggering, swinging his right arm as he strode, in a way few natives\ndo.\n\n\"Let us hope he has forgotten these!\" the Pathan grinned, touching the\npile of rifles. \"Weight for weight in silver they will bring me a fine\nprice! He may forget. He dreams. For a mullah he cares less for meat and\nmoney than any I ever saw. He is mad, I think. It is my opinion Allah\ntouched him!\"\n\n\"What is that, under thy shirt?\" King asked.\n\nThe Pathan grinned, and undid the button. There was a second shirt\nunderneath, and to that on the left breast were pinned two British\nmedals.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" he laughed. \"I served the raj! I was in the army eleven\nyears.\"\n\n\"Why did you leave it?\" King asked, remembering that this man loved to\nhear his own voice.\n\n\"Oh, I had furlough, and the bastard who stood next me in the ranks was\nthe son of a dog with whom my father had a blood-feud. The blind fool\ndid not know me. He received his furlough on the same day as I. I would\nnot lay finger on him that side of the border, for we ate the same salt.\nI knifed him this side the border. It was no affair, of the British. But\nI was seen, and I fled. And having slain a man, and having no doubt a\nreport had gone back to the regiment, I entered this place. Except for a\nraid now and then to cool my blood I have been here ever since. It is a\ndevil of a place.\"\n\nNow the art of ruling India consists not in treading barefooted on\nscorpions--not in virtuous indignation at men who know no better--but in\nseeking for and making much of the gold that lies ever amid the dross.\nThere is gold in the character of any man who once passed the grilling\ntests before enlistment in a British-Indian regiment. It may need\nexperience to lay a finger on it, but it is surely there.\n\n\"I heard,\" said King, \"as I came toward the Khyber in great haste (for\nthe police were at my heels)--\"\n\n\"Ah, the police!\" the Pathan grinned pleasantly.\n\nThe inference was that at some time or other he had left his mark on the\npolice.\n\n\"I heard,\" said King, \"that men are flocking back to their old\nregiments.\"\n\n\"Aye, but not men with a price on their heads, little hakim!\"\n\n\"I could not say,\" said King. To seem to know too much is as bad as to\ndrink too much. \"But I heard say that the sirkar has offered pardons to\nall deserters who return.\"\n\n\"Hah! The sirkar must be afraid. The sirkar needs men!\"\n\n\"For myself,\" said King, \"a whole skin in the 'Hills' seems better than\none full of bullet holes in India.\"\n\n\"Hah! But thou art a hakim, not a soldier!\"\n\n\"True!\" said King.\n\n\"Tell me that again! Free pardons? Free pardons for all deserters?\"\n\n\"So I heard.\"\n\n\"Ah! But I was seen to slay a man of my own regiment.\"\n\n\"On this side the border or that?\" asked King artfully.\n\n\"On this side.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you were seen.\"\n\n\"Ay! But that is no man's business. In India I earned in my salt. I\nobeyed the law. There is no law here in the 'Hills.' I am minded to\ngo back and seek that pardon! It would feel good to stand in the rank\nagain, with a stiff-backed sahib out in front of me, and the thunder of\nthe gun-wheels going by. The salt was good! Come thou with me!\"\n\n\"The pardon is for deserters,\" King objected, \"not for political\noffenders.\"\n\n\"Haugh!\" said the Pathan, bringing down his flat hand hard on the\nhakim's thigh. \"I will attend to that for thee. I will obtain my pardon\nfirst. Then will I lead thee by the hand to the karnal sahib and lie to\nhim and say, 'This is the one who persuaded me against my will to come\nback to the regiment!\"'\n\n\"And he will believe? Nay, I would be afraid!\" said King.\n\n\"Would a pardon not be good?\" the Pathan asked him. \"A pardon and leave\nto swagger through the bazaars again and make trouble with the daughters\nand wives of fat traders--a pardon--Allah! It would be good to salute\nthe karnal sahib again and see him raise a finger, thus; and to have\nthe captain sahib call me a scoundrel--or some worse name if he loves me\nvery much, for the English are a strange race--\"\n\n\"Thou art a dreamer!\" said King. \"Untie my hands; the thong cuts me.\"\nThe Pathan obeyed.\n\n\"Dreamer, am I? It is good to dream such dreams. By Allah, I've a mind\nto see that dream come true! I never slew a man on Indian soil, only in\nthese 'Hills.' I will go to them and say 'Here I am! I am a deserter. I\nseek that pardon!' 'Truly I will go! Come thou with me, little hakim!\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said King, \"I have another thought.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"You, who were seen to slay a man a yard this side of the border--\"\n\n\"Nay; half a mile this side!\"\n\n\"Half a mile, then. You who were seen to slay a fellow soldier of your\nregiment, and I who am a political offender, do not win pardons so\neasily as that.\"\n\n\"Would they hang us?\"\n\nThat was the first squeamishness the Pathan had shown of any kind,\nbut men of his race would rather be tortured to death than hanged in a\nmerciful hempen noose.\n\n\"They would hang us,\" said King, \"unless we came bearing gifts.\"\n\n\"Gifts? Has Allah touched thee? What gifts should we bring? A dozen\nstolen rifles? A bag of silver? And I am the dreamer, am I?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said King. \"I am the dreamer. I have seen a good vision.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"There are others in these Hills--others in Khinjan who wear British\nmedals?\"\n\nThe Pathan nodded.\n\n\"How many?\" asked King.\n\n\"Hundreds. Men fight first on one side, then on the other, being true to\neither side while the contract lasts. In all there must be the makings\nof many regiments among the 'Hills.'\"\n\nKing nodded. He himself had seen the chieftains come to parley after\nthe Tirah war. Most of them had worn British medals and had worn them\nproudly.\n\n\"If we two,\" he said, speaking slowly, \"could speak with some of those\nmen and stir the spirit in them and persuade them to feel as thou dost,\nmentioning the pardon for deserters and the probability of bonuses to\nthe time-expired for reenlistment; if we could march down the Khyber\nwith a hundred such, or even with fifty or with twenty-five or with\na dozen men--we would receive our pardon for the sake of service\nrendered.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nThe Pathan thumped him on the back so hard that his eyes watered.\n\n\"We would have to use much caution,\" King advised him, when he was able\nto speak again.\n\n\"Aye! If Bull-with-a-beard got wind of it he would have us crucified.\nAnd if she heard of it--\"\n\nHe was silent. Apparently there were no words in his tongue that could\ncompass his dread of her revenge. He was silent for ten minutes,\nand King sat still beside him, letting memory of other days do its\nwork--memory of the long, clean regimental lines, and of order and\ndecency and of justice handed out to all and sundry by gentlemen who did\nnot think themselves too good to wear a native regiment's uniform.\n\n\"In two days I could do the drill again as well as ever,\" he said at\nlast. Then there was silence again for fifteen minutes more. \"I could\nalways shoot,\" he murmured; \"I could always shoot.\"\n\nWhen Muhammad Anim came back they had both forgotten to replace the\nlashing on King's wrists, but the mullah seemed not to notice it.\n\n\"Come!\" he ordered, with a sidewise jerk of his great ugly head, and\nthen stood muttering impatiently while they obeyed.\n\nHe had twice the number of women with him, but none of them the same;\nand he had brought five ruffians to guard them, who pounced on the\ncaptured rifles and claimed one apiece, to the Pathan's loud-growled\ndisgust. Then the women were made to gather up King's belongings, and at\na word from the mullah they started in single file--the mullah leading,\nthen two men, then King, then the Orakzai Pathan, and then the other\nthree. The Pathan began to whisper busily to the man next behind and\nnoticing that King looked straight forward and contented himself; his\nheart was singing within him unexplainedly; he wanted to sing and dance,\nas once David did before the ark. He did not feel in the least like a\nprisoner.\n\nThey marched downward through interminable tunnels and along ledges\npoised between earth and heaven, until they came at last to the tunnel\nleading to the one entrance into Khinjan Caves. Just before they entered\nit two more of the mullah's men came up with them, leading horses. One\nhorse was for the mullah, and they helped King mount the other, showing\nhim more respect than is usually shown a prisoner in the \"Hills.\"\n\nThen the mullah led the way into the tunnel, and he seemed in deadly\nfear. The echo of the hoof-beats irritated him. He eyed each hole in the\nroof as if Yasmini might be expected to shoot down at him or drench him\nwith boiling oil and hurried past each of them at a trot, only to draw\nrein immediately afterward because the noise was too great.\n\nIt became evident that his men had been at work here too, for at\nintervals along the passage lay dead bodies. Yasmini must have posted\nthe men there, but where was she? Each of them lay dead with a knife\nwound in his back, and the mullah's men possessed themselves of rifles\nand knives and cartridges, wiping off blood that had scarcely cooled\nyet.\n\nWhen they came to the end of the tunnel it was to find the door into\nthe mosque open in front of them, and twenty more of Muhammad Anim's men\nstanding guard over the eyelashless mullah. They had bound and gagged\nhim. At a word from Muhammad Anim they loosed him; and at a threat the\nhairless one gave a signal that brought the great stone door sliding\nforward on its oiled bronze grooves.\n\nThen, with a dozen jests thrown to the hairless one for consolation, and\nan utter indifference to the sacredness of the mosque floor, they sought\nouter air, and Muhammad Anim led them up the Street of the Dwellings\ntoward Khinian's outer ramparts. They reached the outer gate without\nincident and hurried into the great dry valley beyond it. As they rode\nacross the valley the mullah thumbed a long string of beads. Unlike\nYasmini, he was praying to one god; but he seemed to have many prayers.\nHis back was a picture of determined treachery--the backs of his men\nwere expressions of the creed that \"He shall keep who can!\" King rode\nall but last now and had a good view of their unconsciously vaunted\nblackguardism. There was not a hint of honor or tenderness among the\nlot, man, woman or mullah. Yet his heart sang within him as if he were\nriding to his own marriage feast!\n\nLast of all, close behind him, marched his friend, the Orakzai Pathan,\nand as they picked their way among the boulders across the mile-wide\nmoat the two contrived to fall a little to the rear. The Pathan began\nspeaking in a whisper and King, riding with lowered head as if he were\nstudying the dangerous track, listened with both ears.\n\n\"She sent her man Rewa Gunga toward the Khyber with a message,\" he\nwhispered. \"He took a few men with him, and he is to send them with the\nmessage when they reach the Khyber, but he is to come back. All he\nwent for is to make sure the message is not intercepted, for\nBull-with-a-beard is growing reckless these days. He knew what was doing\nand said at once that she is treating with the British, but there were\nfew who believed that. There are more who wonder where she hides while\nthe message is on its way. None has seen her. Men have swarmed into the\nCavern of Earth's Drink and howled for her, but she did not come. Then\nthe mullah went to look for his ammunition that he stored and sealed in\na cave. And it was gone. It was all gone. And there was no proof of who\nhad taken it!\n\n\"Hakim, there be some who say--and Bull-with-a-beard is one of\nthem--that she is afraid and hides. Men say she fears vengeance for the\nstolen ammunition, because it was plenty for a conquest of India. So men\nsay. So say these here, for I have asked them.\"\n\n\"And thou?\" asked King, struggling to keep the note of exultation from\nhis voice. He did not believe she was hiding. She might be staring into\na crystal in some secret cave--she might be planning new mischief of any\nkind. But afraid she was surely not. And just as surely he could vow she\nwas working out her own undoing.\n\n\"I?\" said the Pathan. \"I swear she is afraid of nothing. If she has\ntaken all the ammunition, then we shall hear from it again and from her\ntoo!\"\n\n\"And what of me?\" asked King. \"What will the mullah do with me?\"\n\n\"His men say he is desperate. His own are losing faith in him. He\nsnatched thee to be a bait for her, having it in mind that a man whom\nshe hides in her private part of Khinjan must be of great value to her.\nHe has sworn to have thee skinned alive on a hot rock should she fail to\ncome to terms!\"\n\nThat being not such a comforting reflection, King rode in silence for\na while, with the Pathan trudging solemnly beside his stirrup keeping\nsemblance of guard over him. When they reached the steep escarpment he\nhad to dismount, although the mullah in the lead tried to make his own\nbeast carry him up the lower spur and was mad--angry with his men for\nlaughing when the horse fell back with him.\n\nFar in the rear King and the Pathan shoved and hauled and nearly lost\ntheir horse a dozen times at that. But once at the top the mullah set a\nfurious pace and the laden women panted in their efforts to keep up, the\nmen taking less notice of them than if they had been animals.\n\nThe march went on in single file until the sun died down in splendid\nfury. Then there began to be a wind that they had to lean against, but\nthe women were allowed no rest.\n\nAt last at a place where the trail began to widen, the mullah beckoned\nKing to ride beside him. It was not that he wished to be communicative,\nbut there were things King knew that he did not know, and he had his own\nway of asking questions.\n\n\"Damned hakim!\" he growled. \"Pill-man! Poulticer! That is a sweeper's\ntrade of thine! Thou shalt apply it at my camp! I have some wounded and\nsome sick.\"\n\nKing did not answer, but buttoned his coat closer against the keen wind.\nThe mullah mistook the shudder for one of another kind.\n\n\"Did she choose thee only for thy face?\" he asked. \"Did she not consider\nthy courage? Does she love thee well enough to ransom thee?\"\n\nAgain King did not answer, but he watched the mullah's face keenly in\nthe dark and missed nothing of its expression. He decided the man was in\ndoubt---even racked by indecision.\n\n\"Should she not ransom thee, hakim, thou shall have a chance to show\nmy men how a man out of India can die! By and by I will lend thee a\nmessenger to send to her. Better make the message clear and urgent!\nThou shalt state my terms to her and plead thine own cause in the same\nletter. My camp lies yonder.\"\n\nHe motioned with one sweep of his arm toward a valley that lay in shadow\nfar below them. As far as the slope leading down to it was visible in\nthe moonlight it was littered with what the \"Hills\" call \"hell-stones,\"\nthat will neither lie flat nor keep on rolling, and are dangerous to man\nand beast alike. Nothing else could be made out through the darkness but\na few twisted tamarisk trees, that served to make the savagery yet more\nsavage and the loneliness more desolate. The gloom below the trees was\nthat of the very underdepths of hell itself.\n\nThe mullah pointed to a rock that rose like a shadow from the deeper\nblackness.\n\n\"Yes,\" said King, \"I have seen.\" And the mullah stared at him. Then he\nshouted, and the top of the rock turned into a man, who gave them leave\nto advance, leaning on his rifle as one who had assured himself of their\nidentity long minutes ago.\n\nAs they approached it the rock clove in two and became two great\npillars, with a man on each. And between the pillars they looked down\ninto a valley lit by fires that burned before a thousand hide tents,\nwith shadows by the hundred flitting back and forth between them. A dull\nroar, like the voice of an army, rose out of the gorge.\n\n\"More than four thousand men!\" said the mullah proudly.\n\n\"What are four thousand for a raid into India?\" sneered King, greatly\ndaring.\n\n\"Wait and see!\" growled the mullah; but he seemed depressed.\n\nHe led the way downward, getting off his horse and giving the reins to\na man. King copied him, and part-way sliding, part stumbling down they\nfound their way along the dry bed of a water-course between two spurs\nof a hillside, until they stood at last in the midst of a cluster of a\ndozen sentries, close to a tamarisk to which a man's body hung spiked.\nThat the man had been spiked to it alive was suggested by the body's\nattitude.\n\nWithout a word to the sentries the mullah led on down a lane through the\nmidst of the camp, toward a great open cave at the far side, in which a\nbonfire cast fitful light and shadow. Watchers sitting by the thousand\ntents yawned at them, but took no particular notice.\n\nThe mouth of the cave was like a lion's, fringed with teeth. There were\nmen in it, ten or eleven of them, all armed, squatting round the fire.\n\n\"Get out!\" growled the mullah. But they did not obey. They sat and\nstared at him.\n\n\"Have ye tents?\" the mullah asked, in a voice like thunder.\n\n\"Aye!\" But they did not go yet.\n\nOne of the men, he nearest the mullah, got on his feet, but he had to\nstep back a pace, for the mullah would not give ground and their breath\nwas in each other's faces.\n\n\"Where are the bombs? And the rifles? And the many cartridges?\" he\ndemanded. \"We have waited long, Muhammad Anim. Where are they now?\"\n\nThe others got up, to lend the first man encouragement. They leaned on\nrifles and surrounded the mullah, so that King could only get a glimpse\nof him between them. They seemed in no mood to be treated cavalierly--in\nno mood to be argued with. And the Mullah did not argue.\n\n\"Ye dogs!\" he growled at them, and he strode through them to the fire\nand chose himself a good, thick burning brand. \"Ye sons of nameless\nmothers!\"\n\nThen he charged them suddenly, beating them over head and face and\nshoulders, driving them in front of him, utterly reckless of their\nrifles. His own rifle lay on the ground behind him, and King kicked its\nstock clear of the fire.\n\n\"Oh, I shall pray for you this night!\" Muhammad Anim snarled. \"What a\ncurse I shall beg for you! Oh, what a burning of the bowels ye shall\nhave! What a sickness! What running of the eyes! What sores! What boils!\nWhat sleepless nights and faithless women shall be yours! What a prayer\nI will pray to Allah!\"\n\nThey scattered into outer gloom before his rage, and then came back\nto kneel to him and beg him withdraw his curse. He kicked them as they\nknelt and drove them away again. Then, silhouetted in the cave mouth,\nwith the glow of the fire behind him, he stood with folded arms and\ndared them shoot. He lacked little in that minute of being a full-grown\nbrute at bay. King admired him, with reservations.\n\nAfter five minutes of angry contemplation of the camp he turned on a\ncontemptuous heel and came back to the fire, throwing on more fuel from\na great pile in a corner. There was an iron pot in the embers. He seized\na stick and stirred the contents furiously, then set the pot between\nhis knees and ate like an animal. He passed the pot to King when he had\nfinished, but fingers had passed too many times through what was left in\nit and the very thought of eating the mess made his gorge rise; so King\nthanked him and set the pot aside.\n\nThen, \"That is thy place!\" Muhammad Anim growled, pointing over his\nshoulder to a ledge of rock, like a shelf in the far wall. There was a\nbed upon it, of cotton blankets stuffed with dry grass. King walked over\nand felt the blankets and found them warm from the last man who had lain\nthere. They smelt of him too. He lifted them and laughed. Taking the\nwhole in both hands he carried it to the fire and threw it in, and the\nsudden blaze made the mullah draw away a yard; but it did not make him\nspeak.\n\n\"Bugs!\" King explained, but the mullah showed no interest. He watched,\nhowever, as King went back to the bed, and subsequent proceedings seemed\nto fascinate him.\n\nOut of the chest that one of the women had set down King took soap.\nThere was a pitcher of water between him and the fire; he carried it\nnearer. With an improvised scrubbing brush of twigs he proceeded to\nscrub every inch of the rock-shelf, and when he had done and had dried\nit more or less, he stripped and began to scrub himself.\n\n\"Who taught thee thy squeamishness?\" the mullah asked at last, getting\nup and coming nearer. It was well that King's skin was dark (although\nit was many shades lighter than his face, that had been stained so\ncarefully). The mullah eyed him from head to foot and looked awfully\nsuspicious, but something prompted King and he answered without an\ninstant's hesitation.\n\n\"Why ask a woman's questions?\" he retorted. \"Only women ask when they\nknow the answer. When I watched thee with the firebrand a short while\nago, oh, mullah, I mistook thee lor a man.\"\n\nThe mullah grunted and began to tug his beard. But King said no more and\nwent on washing himself.\n\n\"I forgot,\" said the mullah then, \"that thou art her pet. She would not\nlove thee unless thy smell was sweet.\"\n\n\"No,\" said King quite cheerfully--going it blind, for he did not know\nwhat had possessed him to take that line, but knew he might as well be\nhanged for a sheep as for a lamb. \"No, if I stank like thee she would not\nlove me.\"\n\nThe mullah snorted and went back to the fire, but he took King's cake of\nsoap with him and sat examining it.\n\n\"Tauba!\" he swore suddenly as if he had made a gruesome discovery. \"Such\nfilthy stuff is made from the fat of pigs!\"\n\n\"Doubtless!\" said King. \"That is why she uses it, and why I use it. She\nis a better Muhammadan than thou. She would surely cleanse her skin with\nthe fat of pigs!\"\n\n\"Thou art a shameless one!\" said the mullah, shaking his head like a\nbear.\n\n\"I am what Allah made me!\" answered King, and then, for the sake of the\nimpression, he went through the outward form of muslim prayer, spreading\na mat and omitting none of the genuflections. When he had finished he\nunfolded his own blankets that a woman had thrown down beside the chest\nand spread them carefully on the rock-shelf. But though he was allowed\nto climb up and lie there, he was not allowed to sleep--nor did he want\nto sleep--for more than an hour to come.\n\nThe mullah came over from the fire again and stood beside him, glaring\nlike a great animal and grumbling in his beard.\n\n\"Does she surely love thee?\" he asked at last, and King nodded, because\nhe knew he was on the trail of information.\n\n\"So thou art to ape the Sleeper in his bronze mail, eh? Thou art to\ncome to life, as she was said to come to life, and the two of you are to\nplunder India? Is that it?\"\n\nKing nodded again, for a nod is less committal than a word; and the nod\nwas enough to start the mullah off again.\n\n\"I saw the Sleeper and his bride before she knew of either! It was I who\nlet her into Khinjan! It was I who told the men she is the 'Heart of\nthe Hills' come to life! She tricked me! But this is no hour for bearing\ngrudges. She has a plan and I am minded to help.\"\n\nKing lay still and looked up at him, sure that treachery was the\nultimate end of any plan the mullah Muhammad Anim had. India has been\nsaved by the treachery of her enemies more often than ruined by false\nfriends. So has the world, for that matter.\n\n\"A jihad when the right hour comes will raise the tribes,\" the mullah\ngrowled. \"She and thou, as the Sleeper and his mate, could work\nwonders. But who can trust her? She stole that head! She stole all the\nammunition! Does she surely love thee?\"\n\nKing nodded again, for modesty could not help him at that juncture. Love\nand boastfulness go together in the \"Hills.\"\n\n\"She shall have thee back, then, at a price!\"\n\nKing did not answer. His brown eyes watched the mullah's, and he drew\nhis breath in little jerks, lest by breathing aloud he should miss one\nword of what, was coming.\n\n\"She shall have thee back against Khinian and the ammunition! She and\nthou shall have India, but I shall be the power behind you! She must\ngive me Khinjan and the ammunition! She must admit me to the inner\ncaves, whence her damned guards expelled me. I must have the reins in my\ntwo hands so! Then, thou and she shall have the pomp and glitter while I\nguide!\"\n\nKing did not answer.\n\n\"Dost understand?\"\n\nKing murmured something unintelligible.\n\n\"Otherwise, I and my men will storm Khinjan, and she and thou shall go\ndown into Earth's Drink lashed together!\"\n\nKing shuddered, not because he felt afraid, but because some instinct\ntold him to make the mullah think him afraid. He was far too interested\nto be fearful.\n\n\"Ye shall both be tortured before the plunge into the river! She shall\nbe tortured in the Cavern of Earth's Drink before the men!\"\n\nKing shuddered again, this time without an effort. He could imagine the\nthousands watching grimly while the flayer used his knife.\n\n\"I have men in Khinjan! I have as many as she! On the day I march there\nwill be a revolt within. She would better agree to terms!\"\n\nKing lay looking at him, like a prisoner on the rack undergoing\nexamination. He did not answer.\n\n\"Write thou a letter. Since she loves thee, state thine own case to her.\nTell her that I hold thee hostage, and that Khinjan is mine already for\na little fighting. In a month she can not pick out my men from among\nher own. Her position is undermined. Tell her that. Tell her that if she\nobeys she shall have India and be queen. If she disobeys, she shall die\nin the Cavern of Earth's Drink!\"\n\n\"She is a proud woman, mullah,\" answered King. \"Threats to such as\nshe--?\"\n\nThe mullah mumbled and strode back and forth three times between King's\nbed and the fire, with his fists knotted together behind him and his\nhead bent, as Napoleon used to walk. When he stood beside the bed again\nat last it was with his mind made up, as his clenched fists and his eyes\nindicated.\n\n\"Make thine own terms with her!\" he growled. \"Write the letter and send\nit! I hold thee; she holds Khinjan and the ammunition. I am between her\nand India. So be it. She shall starve in there! She shall lie in there\nuntil the war is over and take what terms are offered her in the end!\nWrite thine own letter! State the case, and bid her answer!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said King. He began to see now definitely how India was to\nbe saved. It was none of his business to plan yet, but to help others'\nplans destroy themselves and to sow such seed in the broken ground as\nmight bear fruit in time.\n\nThe mullah left him, to squat and gaze into the fire, and mutter, and\nKing lay still. After a while the mullah went and carried a great water\nbowl nearer to the fire and, as King had done, stripped himself. Then he\nheaped great fagots on the fire--wasteful fagots, each of which had cost\nsome woman hours of mountain climbing. And in the glow of the leaping\nflame he scrubbed himself from head to foot with King's soap. Finally,\nwith a feat of strength that nearly forced an exclamation out of King,\nhe lifted the great water bowl in both hands and emptied the whole\ncontents over himself. Then he resumed his smelly garments without\ntroubling to dry his body, and got out a Quran from a corner and began\nto read it in a nasal singsong that would have kept dead men awake. King\nlay and watched and listened.\n\nReading scripture only seemed to fire the mullah's veins. For him sleep\nwas either out of reach or despicable, perhaps both. He seemed in a mood\nto despise anything but conquest and strode back and forth up and down\nthe cave like a caged bear, muttering to himself.\n\nAfter a time he went to the mouth of the cave, to stand and stare out\nat the camp where the thousand fires were dying fitfully and wood smoke\npurged the air of human nastiness. The stars looked down on him, and he\nseemed to try to read them, standing with fists knotted together at his\nback.\n\nAnd as he stood so, six other mullahs came to him and began to argue\nwith him in low tones, he browbeating them all with furious words hissed\nbetween half-closed teeth. They were whispering still when King fell\nasleep. It was courage, not carelessness, that let him sleep--courage\nand a great hope born of the mullah's perplexity.\n\nHe dreamed that he was writing, writing, writing, while the torturers\nmade a hot fire ready in the Cavern of Earth's Drink and whetted knives\non the bridge end while the organ played The Marseillaise. He dreamed\nYasmini came to him and whispered the solution to it all, but what she\nwhispered he could not catch, although she whispered the same words\nagain and again and seemed to be angry with him for not listening.\n\nAnd when he awoke at last he had fragments of his blanket in either\nhand, and the sun was already shining into the jaws of the cave. The\ncamp was alive and reeked of cooking food. But the mullah was gone, and\nso was all the money the women had brought, together with his medicines\nand things from Khinjan.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVII\n\n\n\n     When the last evil jest has been made, and the rest\n     Of the ink of hypocrisy spilt,\n     When the awfully right have elected to fight\n     Lest their own should discover their guilt;\n     When the door has been shut on the \"if\" and the \"but\"\n     And it's up to the men with the guns,\n     On their knees in that day let diplomatists pray\n     For forgiveness from prodigal sons.\n\n\nInstead of the mullah, growling texts out of a Quran on his lap, the\nOrakzai Pathan sat and sunned himself in the cave mouth, emitting\nworldlier wisdom unadulterated with divinity. As King went toward him\nto see to whom he spoke he grinned and pointed with his thumb, and King\nlooked down on some sick and wounded men who sat in a crowd together on\nthe ramp, ten feet or so below the cave.\n\nThey seemed stout soldierly fellows. Men of another type were being kept\nat a distance by dint of argument and threats. Away in the distance was\nMuhammad Anim with his broad back turned to the cave, in altercation\nwith a dozen other mullahs. For the time he was out of the reckoning.\n\n\"Some of these are wounded,\" the Pathan explained. \"Some have sores.\nSome have the belly ache. Then again, some are sick of words, hot and\ncold by day and night. All have served in the army. All have medals.\nAll are deserters, some for one reason, some for another and some for no\nreason at all. Bull-with-a-beard looks the other way. Speak thou to them\nabout the pardon that is offered!\"\n\nSo King went down among them, taking some of the tools of his supposed\ntrade with him and trying to crowd down the triumph that would well up.\nThe seed he had sown had multiplied by fifty in a night. He wanted to\nshout, as men once did before the walls of Jericho.\n\nA man bared a sword cut. He bent over him, and if the mullah had turned\nto look there would have been no ground for suspicion. So in a voice\njust loud enough to reach them all, he repeated what he had told the\nPathan the day before.\n\n\"But who art thou?\" asked one of them suspiciously. Perhaps there had\nbeen a shade too much cocksureness in the hakim's voice, but he acted\nfaultlessly when he answered. Voice, accent, mannerism, guilty pride,\nwere each perfect.\n\n\"Political offender. My brother yonder in the cave mouth\"--(The Pathan\nsmirked. He liked the imputation)--\"suggested I seek pardon, too.\nHe thinks if I persuade many to apply for pardon then the sirkar may\nforgive me for service rendered.\"\n\nThe Pathan's smirk grew to a grin. He liked grandly to have the notion\nfathered on himself; and his complacency of course was suggestive of the\nhakim's trustworthiness. But the East is ever cautious.\n\n\"Some say thou art a very great liar,\" remarked a man with half a nose.\n\n\"Nay,\" answered King. \"Liar I may be, but I am one against many. Which\nof you would dare stand alone and lie to all the others? Nay, sahibs, I\nam a political offender, not a soldier!\"\n\nThey all laughed at that and seizing the moment when they were in a\npliant mood the Orakzai Pathan proceeded to bring proposals to a head.\n\n\"Are we agreed?\" he asked. \"Or have we waggled our beards all night long\nin vain? Take him with us, say I. Then, if pardons are refused us he at\nleast will gain nothing by it. We can plunge our knives in him first,\nwhatever else happens.\"\n\n\"Aye!\"\n\nThat was reasonable and they approved in chorus. Possibility of pardon\nand reinstatement, though only heard of at second hand, had brought\nunity into being. And unity brought eagerness.\n\n\"Let us start to-night!\" urged one man, and nobody hung back.\n\n\"Aye! Aye! Aye!\" they chorused. And eagerness, as always in the \"Hills,\"\nbrought wilder counsel in its wake.\n\n\"Who dare stab Bull-with-a-beard? He has sought blood and has let blood.\nLet him drink his own.\"\n\n\"Aye!\"\n\n\"Nay! He is too well guarded.\"\n\n\"Not he!\"\n\n\"Let us stab him and take his head with us; there well may be a price on\nit.\"\n\nThey took a vote on it and were agreed; but that did not suit King at\nall, whatever Muhammad Anim's personal deserts might be. To let him be\nstabbed would be to leave Yasmini without a check on her of any kind,\nand then might India defend herself! Yet to leave the mullah and Yasmini\nboth at large would be almost equally dangerous, for they might form an\nalliance. There must be some other way, and he set out to gain time.\n\n\"Nay, nay, sahibs!\" he urged. \"Nay, nay!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Sahibs, I have wife and children in Lahore. Same are most dear to me\nand I to them. I find it expedient to make great effort for my pardon.\nYe are but fifty. Ye are less than fifty. Nay, let us gather a hundred\nmen.\"\n\n\"Who shall find a hundred?\" somebody demanded, and there was a chorus of\ndenial. \"We be all in this camp who ate the salt.\"\n\nIt was plain, though, that his daring to hold out only gave them the\nmore confidence in him.\n\n\"But Khinjan,\" he objected. The crimes of the Khinjan men were not to\nthe point. Time had to be gained.\n\n\"Aye,\" they agreed. \"There be many in Khinjan!\" Mere mention of the\nplace made them regard Orakzai Pathan and hakim with new respect, as\nhaving right of entry through the forbidden gate.\n\n\"Then I have it!\" the Pathan announced at once, for he was awake to\nopportunity. \"Many of you can hardly march. Rest ye here and let the\nhakim treat your belly aches. Bull-with-a-beard bade me wait here for a\nletter that must go to Khinjan to-day. Good. I will take his letter.\nAnd in Khinjan I will spread news about pardons. It is likely there are\nfifty there who will dare follow me back, and then we shall march down\nthe Khyber like a full company of the old days! Who says that is not a\ngood plan?\"\n\nThere were several who said it was not, but they happened to have\nnothing the matter with them and could have marched at once. The rest\nwere of the other way of thinking and agreed in asserting that Khinjan\nmen were a higher caste of extra-ultra murderers whose presence\ndoubtless would bring good luck to the venture. These prevailed after\nconsiderable argument.\n\nStrangely enough, none of them deemed the proposition beneath Khinjan\nmen's consideration. Pardon and leave to march again behind British\nofficers loomed bigger in their eyes than the green banner of the\nProphet, which could only lead to more outrageous outlawry. They knew\nKhinjan men were flesh and blood--humans with hearts--as well as they.\nBut caution had a voice yet.\n\n\"She will catch thee in Khinjan Caves,\" suggested the man with part of\nhis nose missing. \"She will have thee flayed alive!\"\n\n\"Take note then, I bequeath all the women in the world to thee! Be thou\nheir to my whole nose, too, and a blessing!\" laughed the Pathan, and\nthe butt of the jest spat savagely. In the \"Hills\" there is only one\nexplanation given as to how one lost his nose, and they all laughed like\nhyenas until the mullah Muhammad Anim came rolling and striding back.\n\nBy that time King had got busy with his lancet, but the mullah called\nhim off and drove the crowd away to a distance; then he drove King into\nthe cave in front of him, his mouth working as if he were biting bits of\nvengeance off for future use.\n\n\"Write thy letter, thou! Write thy letter! Here is paper. There is a\npen--take it! Sit! Yonder is ink--ttutt--ttutt!--Write, now, write!\"\n\nKing sat at a box and waited, as if to take dictation, but the mullah,\ntugging at his beard, grew furious.\n\n\"Write thine own letter! Invent thine own argument! Persuade her, or die\nin a new way! I will invent a new way for thee!\"\n\nSo King began to write, in Urdu, for reasons of his own. He had spoken\nonce or twice in Urdu to the mullah and had received no answer. At the\nend of ten minutes he handed up what he had written, and Muhammad Anim\nmade as if to read it, trying to seem deliberate, and contriving to look\nirresolute. It was a fair guess that he hated to admit ignorance of the\nscholars' language.\n\n\"Are there any alterations you suggest?\" King asked him.\n\n\"Nay, what care I what the words are? If she be not persuaded, the worse\nfor thee!\"\n\nHe held it out, and as he took it King contrived to tear it; he also\ncontrived to seem ashamed of his own clumsiness.\n\n\"I will copy it out again,\" he said.\n\nThe mullah swore at him, and conceiving that some extra show of\nauthority was needful, growled out:\n\n\"Remember all I said. Set down she must surrender Khinjan Caves or I\nswear by Allah I will have thee tortured with fire and thorns--and her,\ntoo, when the time comes!\"\n\nNow he had said that, or something very like it, in the first letter.\nThere was no doubt left that the Mullah was trying to hide ignorance,\nas men of that fanatic ambitious mold so often will at the expense of\nbetter judgment. If fanatics were all-wise, it would be a poor world for\nthe rest.\n\n\"Very well,\" King said quietly. And with great pretense of copying the\nother letter out on fresh paper he now wrote what he wished to say,\ntaking so long about it (for he had to weigh each word), that the mullah\nstrode up and down the cave swearing and kicking things over.\n\n        \"Greeting,\"' he wrote, \"to the most beautiful and very\n        wise Princess Yasmini, in her palace in the Caves in\n        Khinjan, from her servant Kurram Khan the hakim, in\n        the camp of the mullah Muhammad Anim, a night's march\n        distant in the hills.\n\n        \"The mullah Muhammad Anim makes his stand and demands\n        now surrender to himself of Khinjan Caves; and of all\n        his ammunition.  Further, he demands full control of\n        you and of me and of all your men.  He is ready to\n        fight for his demands and already--as you must well\n        know--he has considerable following in Khinjan Caves.\n        He has at least as many men as you have, and he has\n        four thousand more here.\n\n        \"He threatens as a preliminary to blockade Khinjan\n        Caves, unless the answer to this prove favorable,\n        letting none enter, but calling his own men out to\n        join him.  This would suit the Indian government,\n        because while the 'Hills' fight among themselves\n        they can not raid India, and while he blockades\n        Khinjan Caves there will be time to move against him.\n\n        \"Knowing that he dares begin and can accomplish what\n        he threatens, I am sorry;  because I know it is said\n        how many services you have rendered of old to the\n        government I serve.  We who serve one raj are One--one\n        to remember--one to forget--one to help each other in\n        good time.\n\n        \"I have not been idle.  Some of Muhammad Anim's men\n        are already mine.  With them I can return to India,\n        taking information with me that will serve my government.\n        My men are eager to be off.\n\n        \"It may be that vengeance against me would seem sweeter\n        to you than return to your former allegiance.  In that\n        case, Princess, you only need betray me to the mullah,\n        and be sure my death would leave nothing to be desired\n        by the spectators.  At present he does not suspect me.\n\n        \"Be assured, however, that not to betray me to him is\n        to leave me free to serve my government and well able\n        to do so.\n\n        \"I invite you to return to India with me, bearing news\n        that the mullah Muhammad Anim and his men are bottled\n        in Khinjan Caves, and to plan with me to that end.\n\n        \"If you will, then write an answer to Muhammad Anim,\n        not in Urdu, but in a language he can understand;  seem\n        to surrender to him.  But to me send a verbal message,\n        either by the bearer of this or by some trustier messenger.\n\n        \"India can profit yet by your service if you will.  And\n        in that case I pledge my word to direct the government's\n        attention only to your good service in the matter.  It is\n        not yet too late to choose.  It is not impertinent in me\n        to urge you.\n\n        \"Nor can I say how gladly I would subscribe myself your\n        grateful and loyal servant.\"\n\nThe mullah pounced on the finished letter, pretended to read it, and\nwatched him seal it up, smudging the hot wax with his own great gnarled\nthumb. Then he shouted for the Orakzai Pathan, who came striding in, all\ngrins and swagger.\n\n\"There--take it! Make speed!\" he ordered, and with his rifle at the\n\"ready\" and the letter tucked inside his shirt, the Pathan favored King\nwith a farewell grin and obeyed.\n\n\"Get out!\" the mullah snarled then immediately. \"See to the sick. Tell\nthem I sent thee. Bid them be grateful!\"\n\nKing went. He recognized the almost madness that constituted the\nmullah's driving power. It is contagious, that madness, until it\ndestroys itself. It had made several thousand men follow him and believe\nin him, but it had once given Yasmini a chance to fool him and defeat\nhim, and now it gave King his chance. He let the mullah think himself\nobeyed implicitly.\n\nHe became the busiest man in all the \"Hills.\" While the mullah glowered\nover the camp from the cave mouth or fulminated from the Quran or fought\nwith other mullahs with words for weapons and abuse for argument, he\nbandaged and lanced and poulticed and physicked until his head swam with\nweariness.\n\nThe sick swarmed so around him that he had to have a body-guard to keep\nthem at bay; so he chose twenty of the least sick from among those who\nhad talked with him after sunrise.\n\nAnd because each of those men had friends, and it is only human to wish\none's friend in the same boat, especially when the sea, so to speak, is\nrough, the progress through the camp became a current of missionary zeal\nand the virtues of the Anglo-Indian raj were better spoken of than the\n\"Hills\" had heard for years.\n\nNot that there was any effort made to convert the camp en masse. Far\nfrom it. But the likely few were pounced on and were told of a chance to\nenlist for a bounty in India. And what with winter not so far ahead, and\nwhat with experience of former fighting against the British army, the\nchoosing was none so difficult. From the day when the lad first feels\nsoft down upon his face until the old man's beard turns white and his\nteeth shake out, the Hillman would rather fight than eat; but he prefers\nto fight on the winning side if he may, and he likes good treatment.\n\nBefore if was dark that night there were thirty men sworn to hold\ntheir tongues and to wait for the word to hurry down the Khyber for the\npurpose of enlisting in some British-Indian regiment. Some even began\nto urge the hakim not to wait for the Orakzai Pathan, but to start with\nwhat he had.\n\n\"Shall I leave my brother in the lurch?\" the hakim asked them; and\nthough they murmured, they thought better of him for it.\n\nWell for him that he had plenty of Epsom salts in his kit, for in the\n\"Hills\" physic should taste evil and show very quick results to be\nbelieved in. He found a dozen diseases of which he did not so much as\nknow the name, but half of the sufferers swore they were cured after the\nfirst dose. They would have dubbed him faquir and have foisted him to a\npillar of holiness had he cared to let them.\n\nMuhammad Anim slept most of the day, like a great animal that scorns to\nlive by rule. But at evening he came to the cave mouth and fulminated\nsuch a sermon as set the whole camp to roaring. He showed his power\nthen. The jihad he preached would have tempted dead men from their\ngraves to come and share the plunder, and the curses he called down on\ncowards and laggards and unbelievers were enough to have frightened the\ndead away again.\n\nIn twenty minutes he had undone all King's missionary work. And then\nin ten more, feeling his power and their response, and being at heart a\nfool as all rogues are, he built it up again.\n\nHe began to make promises too definite. He wanted Khinjan Caves. More,\nhe needed them. So he promised them they should all be free of Khinjan\nCaves within a day or two, to come and go and live there at their\npleasure. He promised them they should leave their wives and children\nand belongings safe in the Caves while they themselves went down to\nplunder India. He overlooked the fact that Khinjan Caves for centuries\nhad been a secret to be spoken of in whispers, and that prospect of its\nviolation came to them as a shock.\n\nHalf of them did not believe him. Such a thing was impossible, and if he\nwere lying as to one point, why not as to all the others, too?\n\nAnd the army veterans, who had been converted by King's talk of pardons,\nand almost reconverted by the sermon, shook their heads at the talk of\ntaking Khinjan. Why waste time trying to do what never had been done,\nwith her to reckon against, when a place in the sun was waiting for them\ndown in India, to say nothing of the hope of pardons and clean living\nfor a while? They shook their heads and combed their beards and eyed one\nanother sidewise in a way the \"Hills\" understand.\n\nThat night, while the mullah glowered over the camp like a great old\nowl, with leaping firelight reflected in his eyes, the thousands under\nthe skin tents argued, so that the night was all noise. But King slept.\n\nAll of another day and part of another night he toiled among the sick,\nwondering when a message would come back. It was nearly midnight when\nhe bandaged his last patient and came out into the starlight to bend his\nback straight and yawn and pick his way reeling with weariness back to\nthe mullah's cave. He had given his bag of medicines and implements to\na man to carry ahead of him and had gone perhaps ten paces into the dark\nwhen a strong hand gripped him by the wrist.\n\n\"Hush!\" said a voice that seemed familiar.\n\nHe turned swiftly and looked straight into the eyes of the Rangar Rewa\nGunga!\n\n\"How did you get here?\" he asked in English.\n\n\"Any fool could learn the password into this camp! Come over here,\nsahib. I bring word from her.\"\n\nThe ground was criss-crossed like a man's palm by the shadows of\ntent-ropes. The Rangar led him to where the tents were forty feet apart\nand none was likely to overhear them. There he turned like a flash.\n\n\"She sends you this!\" he hissed.\n\nIn that same instant King was fighting for his life.\n\nIn another second they were down together among the tent-pegs, King\nholding the Rangar's wrist with both hands and struggling to break\nit, and the Rangar striving for another stroke. The dagger he held\nhad missed King's ribs by so little that his skin yet tingled from its\ntouch. It was a dagger with bronze blade and a gold hilt--her dagger. It\nwas her perfume in the air.\n\nThey rolled over and over, breathing hard. King wanted to think before\nhe gave an alarm, and he could not think with that scent in his nostrils\nand creeping into his lungs. Even in the stress of fighting be wondered\nhow the Rangar's clothes and turban had come to be drenched in it. He\nadmitted to himself afterward that it was nothing else than jealousy\nthat suggested to him to make the Rangar prisoner and hand him over to\nthe mullah.\n\nThat would have been a ridiculous thing to do, for it would have forced\nhis own betrayal to the mullah. But as if the Rangar had read his\nmind he suddenly redoubled his efforts and King, weary to the point of\nsickness, had to redouble his own or die. Perhaps the jealousy helped\nput venom in his effort, for his strength came back to him as a madman's\ndoes. The Rangar gave a moan and let the knife fall.\n\nAnd because jealousy is poison King did the wrong thing then. He\npounced on the knife instead of on the Rangar. He could have questioned\nhim--knelt on him and perhaps forced explanations from him. But with a\nsudden swift effort like a snake's the Rangar freed himself and was\nup and gone before King could struggle to his feet--gone like a shadow\namong shadows.\n\nKing got up and felt himself all over, for they had fought on stony\nground and he was bruised. But bruises faded into nothing, and weariness\nas well, as his mind began to dwell on the new complication to his\nproblem.\n\nIt was plain that the moment he had returned from his message to the\nKhyber the Rangar had been sent on this new murderous mission. If\nYasmini had told the truth a letter had gone into India describing him,\nKing, as a traitor, and from her point of view that might be supposed to\ncut the very ground away from under his feet.\n\nThen why so much trouble to have him killed? Either Rewa Gunga had never\ntaken the first letter, or--and this seemed more probable--Yashiini had\nnever believed the letter would be treated seriously by the authorities,\nand had only sent it in the hope of fooling him and undermining his\ndetermination. In that case, especially supposing her to have received\nhis ultimatum on the mullah's behalf before sending Rewa Gunga with the\ndagger, she must consider him at least dangerous. Could she be afraid?\nIf so her game was lost already!\n\nPerhaps she saw her own peril. Perhaps she contemplated--gosh! what a\ncontingency!--perhaps she contemplated bolting into India with a story\nof her own, and leaving the mullah to his own devices! In such a case,\nbefore going she would very likely try to have the one man stabbed who\ncould give her away most completely. In fact, would she dare escape into\nIndia and leave himself alive behind her?\n\nHe rather thought she would dare do anything. And that thought brought\nreassurance. She would dare, and being what she was she almost surely\nwould seek vengeance on the mullah before doing anything else.\n\nThen why the dagger for himself? She must believe him in league with the\nmullah against her. She might believe that with him out of the way the\nmullah would prove an easier prey for her. And that belief might be\njustifiable, but as an explanation it failed to satisfy.\n\nThere was an alternative, the very thought of which made him fearfully\nuneasy, and yet brought a thrill with it. In all eastern lands, love\nscorned takes to the dagger. He had half believed her when she swore she\nloved him! The man who could imagine himself loved by Yasmini and not be\nthrilled to his core would be inhuman, whatever reason and caution and\ncaste and creed might whisper in imagination's wake.\n\nReeling from fatigue (he felt like a man who had been racked, for the\nRangar's strength was nearly unbelievable), he started toward where the\nmullah sat glowering in the cave mouth. He found the man who had carried\nhis bag asleep at the foot of the ramp, and taking the bag away from\nhim, let him lie there. And it took him five minutes to drag his hurt\nweary bones up the ramp, for the fight had taken more out of him than he\nhad guessed at first.\n\nThe mullah glared at him but let him by without a word. It was by the\nfire at the back of the cave, where he stooped to dip water from the\nmullah's enormous crock that the next disturbing factor came to light.\nHe kicked a brand into the fire and the flame leaped. Its light shone\non a yard and a half of exquisitely fine hair, like spun gold, that\ncaressed his shoulder and descended down one arm. One thread of hair\nthat conjured up a million thoughts, and in a second upset every\nargument!\n\nIf Rewa Gunga had been near enough to her and intimate enough with her\nnot only to become scented with her unmistakable perfume but even to get\nher hair on his person, then gone was all imagination of her love for\nhimself! Then she had lied from first to last! Then she had tried to\nmake him love her that she might use him, and finding she had failed,\nshe had sent her true love with the dagger to make an end!\n\nIn a moment he imagined a whole picture, as it might have been in a\ncrystal, of himself trapped and made to don the Roman's armor and forced\nto pose to the savage 'Hills'--or fooled into posing to them--as her\nlover, while Rewa Gunga lurked behind the scenes and waited for the\nharvest in the end. And what kind of harvest?\n\nAnd what kind of man must Rewa Gunga be who could lightly let go all\nthe prejudices of the East and submit to what only the West has endured\nhitherto with any complacency--a \"tertium quid\"?\n\nYet what a fool he, King, had been not to appreciate at once that Rewa\nGunga must be her lover. Why should he not be? Were they not alike as\ncousins? And the East does not love its contrary, but its complement,\nbeing older in love than the West, and wiser in its ways in all but the\nmaterial. He had been blind. He had overlooked the obvious--that from\nfirst to last her plan had been to set herself and this Rewa Gunga on\nthe throne of India!\n\nHe washed and went through the mummery of muslim prayers for the\nwatchful mullah's sake, and climbed on to his bed. But sleep seemed out\nof the question. He lay and tossed for an hour, his mind as busy as a\nterrier in hay. And when he did fall asleep at last it was so to\ndream and mutter that the mullah came and shook him and preached him\na half-hour sermon against the mortal sins that rob men of peaceful\nslumber by giving them a foretaste of the hell to come.\n\nAll that seemed kinder and more refreshing than King's own thoughts had\nbeen, for when the mullah had done at last and had gone striding back to\nthe cave mouth, he really did fall sound asleep, and it was after dawn\nwhen he awoke. The mullah's voice, not untuneful was rousing all the\nvalley echoes in the call to prayer.\n\n        Allah is Almighty!  Allah is Almighty!\n        I declare there is no God but Allah!\n        I declare Muhammad is his prophet!\n        Hie ye to prayer!\n        Hie ye to salvation!\n        Prayer is better than sleep!\n        Prayer is better than sleep!\n        There is no God but Allah!\n\nAnd while King knelt behind the mullah and the whole camp faced Mecca in\nforehead-in-the-dust abasement there came a strange procession down the\nmidst--not strange to the \"Hills,\" where such sights are common, but\nstrange to that camp and hour. Somebody rose and struck them, and they\nknelt like the rest; but when prayer was over and cooking had begun and\nthe camp became a place of savory smell, they came on again--seven blind\nmen.\n\nThey were weary, ragged, lean--seven very tatter-demalions--and the\nfront man led them, tapping the ground with a long stick. The others\nclung to him in line, one behind the other. He was the only clean-shaven\none, and he was the tallest. He looked as if he had not been blind so\nlong, for his physical health was better. All seven men yelled at the\nutmost of their lungs, but he yelled the loudest.\n\n\"Oh, the hakim--the good hakim!\" they wailed. \"Where is the famous\nhakim? We be blind men--blind we be--blind--blind! Oh, pity us! Is any\nkismet worse than ours? Oh, show us to the hakim! Show us the way to\nhim! Lead us to him! Oh, the famous, great, good hakim who can heal\nmen's eyes!\"\n\nThe mullah looked down on them like a vulture waiting to see them die,\nand seeing they did not die, turned his back and went into his cave.\nClose to the ramp they stopped, and the front man, cocking his head to\none side as only birds and the newly blind do, gave voice again in nasal\nsingsong.\n\n\"Will none tell me where is the great, good, wise hakim Kurram Khan?\"\n\n\"I am he,\" said King, and he stepped down toward him, calling to an\nassistant to come and bring him water and a sponge. The blind man's face\nlooked strangely familiar, though it was partly disguised by some gummy\nstuff stuck all about the eyes. Taking it in both hands be tilted the\neyes to the light and opened one eye with his thumb. There was nothing\nwhatever the matter with it. He opened the other.\n\n\"Rub me an ointment on!\" the man urged him, and he stared at the face\nagain.\n\n\"Ismail!\" he said. \"You?\"\n\n\"Aye! Father of cleverness! Make play of healing my eyes!\"\n\nSo King dipped a sponge in water and sent back for his bag and made a\ngreat show of rubbing on ointment. In a minute Ismail, looking almost\nlike a young man without his great beard, was dancing like a lunatic\nwith both fists in the air, and yelling as if wasps had stung him.\n\n\"Aieee--aieee--aieee!\" he yelled. \"I see again! I see! My eyes have\nlight in them! Allah! Oh, Allah heap riches on the great wise hakfim who\ncan heal men's eyes! Allah reward him richly, for I am a beggar and have\nno goods!\"\n\nThe other six blind men came struggling to be next, and while King\nrubbed ointment on their eyes and saw that there was nothing there he\ncould cure the whole camp began to surge toward him to see the miracle,\nand his chosen body-guard rushed up to drive them back.\n\n\"Find your way down the Khyber and ask for the Wilayti dakitar. He will\nfinish the cure.\"\n\nThe six blind men, half-resentful, half-believing, turned away, mainly\nbecause Ismail drove them with words and blows. And as they went a tall\nAfridi came striding down the camp with a letter for the mullah held out\nin a cleft stick in front of him.\n\n\"Her answer!\" said Ismail with a wicked grin.\n\n\"What is her word? Where is the Orakzai Pathan?\"\n\nBut Ismail laughed and would not answer him. It seemed to King that he\nscented climax. So did his near-fifty and their thirty friends. He chose\nto take the arrival of the blind men as a hint from Providence and to\n\"go it blind\" on the strength of what he had hoped might happen. Also he\nchose in that instant to force the mullah's hand, on the principle that\nhurried buffaloes will blunder.\n\n\"To Khinjan!\" he shouted to the nearest man. \"The mullah will march on\nKhinjan!\"\n\nThey murmured and wondered and backed away from him to give him room.\nIsmail watched him with dropped jaw and wild eye.\n\n\"Spread it through the camp that we march on Khinjan! Shout it! Bid them\nstrike the tents!\"\n\nSomebody behind took up the shout and it went across the camp in leaps,\nas men toss a ball. There was a surge toward the tents, but King called\nto his deserters and they clustered back to him. He had to cement their\nallegiance now or fail altogether, and he would not be able to do it by\nordinary argument or by pleading; he had to fire their imagination. And\nhe did.\n\n\"She is on our side!\" That was a sheer guess. \"She has kept our man and\nsent another as hostage for him in token of good faith! Listen! Ye saw\nthis man's eyes healed. Let that be a token! Be ye the men with new\neyes! Give it out! Claim the title and be true to it and see me guide\nyou down the Khyber in good time like a regiment, many more than a\nhundred strong!\"\n\nThey jumped at the idea. The \"Hills\"--the whole East, for that\nmatter--are ever ready to form a new sect or join a new band or a\nnew blood-feud. Witness the Nikalseyns, who worship a long-since dead\nEnglishman.\n\n\"We see!\" yelled one of them.\n\n\"We see!\" they chorused, and the idea took charge. From that minute they\nwere a new band, with a war-cry of their own.\n\n\"To Khinjan!\" they howled, scattering through the camp, and the mullah\ncame out to glare at them and tug his beard and wonder what possessed\nthem.\n\n\"To Khinjan!\" they roared at him. \"Lead us to Khinjan!\"\n\n\"To Khinjan, then!\" he thundered, throwing up both arms in a sort of\ndouble apostolic blessing, and then motioning as if he threw them the\nreins and leave to gallop. They roared back at him like the sea under\nthe whip of a gaining wind. And Ismail disappeared among them, leaving\nKing alone. Then the mullah's eyes fell on King and he beckoned him.\n\nKing went up with an effort, for he ached yet from his struggle of the\nnight before. Up there by the ashes of the fire the mullah showed him a\nletter he had crumpled in his fist. There were only a few lines, written\nin Arabic, which all mullahs are supposed to be able to read, and they\nwere signed with a strange scrawl that might have meant anything. But\nthe paper smelt strongly of her perfume.\n\n\"Come, then. Bring all your men, and I will let you and them enter\nKhinjan Caves. We will strike a bargain in the Cavern of Earth's Drink.\"\n\nThat was all, but the fire in the mullah's eyes showed that he thought\nit was enough. He did not doubt that once he should have his extra four\nthousand in the caves Khinjan would be his; and he said so.\n\n\"Khinjan is mine!\" he growled. \"India is mine!\"\n\nAnd King did not answer him. He did not believe Yasmini would be fool\nenough to trust herself in any bargain with Muhammad Anim. Yet he could\nsee no alternative as yet. He could only be still and be glad he had set\nthe camp moving and so had forced the mullah's hand.\n\n\"The old fatalist would have suspected her answer otherwise!\" he told\nhimself, for he knew that he himself suspected it.\n\nWhile he and the mullah watched the tents began to fall and the women\nlabored to roll them. The men began firing their rifles, and within the\nhour enough ammunition had been squandered to have fought a good-sized\nskirmish; but the mullah did not mind, for he had Khinjan Caves in view,\nand none knew better than he what vast store of cartridges and dynamite\nwas piled in there. He let them waste.\n\nWatching his opportunity, King slipped down the ramp and into the crowd,\nwhile the mullah was busy with personal belongings in the cave. King\nleft his own belongings to the fates, or to any thief who should care\nto steal them. He was safe from the mullah in the midst of his nearly\neighty men, who half believed him a sending from the skies.\n\n\"We see! we see!\" they yelled and danced around him.\n\nBefore ever the mullah gave an order they got under way and started\nclimbing the steep valley wall. The mullah on his brown mule thrust\nforward, trying to get in the lead, and King and his men hung back, to\nkeep at a distance from him. It was when the mullah had reached the top\nof the slope and was not far from being in the lead that Ismail appeared\nagain, leading King's horse, that he had found in possession of another\nman. That did not look like enmity or treachery. King mounted and\nthanked him. Ismail wiped his knife, that had blood on it, and stuck\nhis tongue through his teeth, which did not look quite like treachery\neither. Yet the Afridi could not be got to say a word.\n\nTwo or three miles along the top of the escarpment the mullah sent back\nword that he wanted the hakim to be beside him. Doubtless he had looked\nback and had seen King on the horse, head and shoulders above the\nbaggage.\n\nBut King's men treated the messenger to open scorn and sent him packing.\n\n\"Bid the mullah hunt himself another hakim! Be thou his hakim! Stay, we\nwill give thee a lesson in how to use a knife!\"\n\nThe man ran, lest they carry out their threat, for men joke grimly in\nthe \"Hills.\"\n\nIsmail came and held King's stirrup, striding beside him with the easy\nHillman gait.\n\n\"Art thou my man at last?\" King asked him, but Ismail laughed and shook\nhis head.\n\n\"I am her man.\"\n\n\"Where is she?\" King asked.\n\n\"Nay, who am I that I should know?\"\n\n\"But she sent thee?\"\n\n\"Aye, she sent me.\"\n\n\"To what purpose?\"'\n\n\"To her purpose!\" the Afridi answered, and King could not get another\nword out of him. He fell behind.\n\nBut out of the corner of his eye, and once or twice by looking back\ndeliberately, King saw that Ismail was taking the members of his new\nband one by one and whispering to them. What he said was a mystery, but\nas they talked each man looked at King. And the more they talked the\nbetter pleased they seemed. And as the day wore on the more deferential\nthey grew. By midday if King wanted to dismount there were three at\nleast to hold his stirrup and ten to help him mount again.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII\n\n\n\n     By the sweat of your brow;  by the ache of your bones;\n     In the sun, in the wind, in the chill of the rains,\n     Ye sowed as ye knew.  And ye know it was blown\n     To be trodden and burned--aye, and that by your own\n     Who sneered at lean furrows and mocked at the stones.\n     But ye stayed and sowed on.  And a little remains.\n     Ye shall have for your faith.  Ye shall reap for your pains.\n\n\nFour thousand men with women and children and baggage do not move\nso swiftly as one man or a dozen, especially in the \"Hills,\" where\ndiscipline is reckoned beneath a proud man's honor. There were many\nmiles to go before Khinjan when night fell and the mullah bade them\ncamp. He bade them camp because they would have done it otherwise in any\ncase.\n\n\"And we,\" said King to his all but eighty who crowded around him, \"being\nmen with new eyes and with a great new hope in us, will halt here and\neat the evening meal and watch for an opportunity.\"\n\n\"Opportunity for what?\" they asked him.\n\n\"An opportunity to show how Allah loves the brave!\" said King, and they\nhad to be content with that, for he would say no more to them. Seeing he\nwould not talk, they made their little fires all around him and watched\nwhile their women cooked the food. The mullah would not let them eat\nuntil he and the whole camp had prayed like the only righteous.\n\nWhen the evening meal was eaten, and sentries had been set at every\nvantage point, and the men all sat about cleansing their beards and\nfingers the mullah sent for the hakim again. Only this time he sent\ntwenty men to fetch him.\n\nThere was so nearly a fight that the skin all down King's back was\ngooseflesh, for a fight at that juncture would have ruined everything.\nAt the least he would have been made a hopeless helpless prisoner. But\nin the end the mullah's men drew off snarling, and before they could\nhave time to receive new orders or reinforcements, King's die was cast.\n\nThere came another order from the mullah. The women and children were to\nbe left in camp next dawn, and to remain there until sent for. There\nwas murmuring at that around the camp, and especially among King's\ncontingent. But King laughed.\n\n\"It is good!\" he said.\n\n\"Why? How so?\" they asked him.\n\n\"Bid your women make for the Khyber soon after the mullah marches\ntomorrow. Bid them travel down the Khyber until we and they meet!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Please yourselves, sahibs!\" The hakim's air was one of supremest\nindifference. \"As for me, I leave no women behind me in the mountains. I\nam content.\"\n\nThey murmured a while, but they gave the orders to their women, and\nKing watched the women nod. And all that while Ismail watched him\nwith carefully disguised concern, but undisguised interest. And King\nunderstood. Enlightenment comes to a man swiftly, when it does come, as\na rule.\n\nHe recalled that Yasmini had not done much to make his first entry into\nKhinjan easy. On the contrary, she had put him on his mettle and had set\nRewa Gunga to the task of frightening him and had tested him and tried\nhim before tempting him at last.\n\nShe must be watching him now, for even the East repeats itself. She had\nsent Ismail for that purpose. It might be Ismail's business to drive a\nknife in him at the first opportunity, but he doubted that. It was much\nmore likely that, having failed in an attempt to have him murdered, she\nwas superstitiously remorseful. Her course would depend on his. If he\nfailed, she was done with him. If he succeeded in establishing a strong\nposition of his own, she would yield.\n\nAll of which did not explain Ismail's whisperings and noddings and chin\nstrokings with King's contingent. But it explained enough for King's\npresent purpose, and he wasted no time on riders to the problem. With\nor without Ismail's aid, with or without his enmity, he must control his\neighty men and give the slip to the mullah, and he went at once about\nthe best way to do both.\n\n\"We will go now,\" he said quietly. \"That sentry in yonder shadow has his\nback turned. He has over-eaten. We will rush him and put good running\nbetween us and the mullah.\"\n\nSurprised into obedience, and too delighted at the prospect of action to\nwonder why they should obey a hakim so, they slung on their bandoliers\nand made ready. Ismail brought up King's horse and he mounted. And then\nat King's word all eighty made a sudden swoop on the drowsy sentry\nand took him unawares. They tossed him over the cliff, too startled\nto scream an alarm; and though sentries on either hand heard them and\nshouted, they were gone into outer darkness like wind-blown ghosts of\ndead men before the mullah even knew what was happening.\n\nThey did not halt until not one of them could run another yard, King\ntrusting to his horse to find a footing along the cliff-tops, and to the\nmen to find the way.\n\n\"Whither?\" one whispered to him.\n\n\"To Khinjan!\" he answered; and that was enough. Each whispered to the\nother, and they all became fired with curiosity more potent than money\nbribes.\n\nWhen he halted at last and dismounted and sat down and the stragglers\ncaught up, panting, they held a council of war all together, with Ismail\nsitting at King's back and leaning a chin on his shoulder in order to\nhear better. Bone pressed on bone, and the place grew numb; King shook\nhim off a dozen times; but each time Ismail set his chin back on the\nsame spot, as a dog will that listens to his master. Yet he insisted he\nwas her man, and not King's.\n\n\"Now, ye men of the Hills,\" said King, \"listen to me who am\npolitical-offender-with-reward-for-capture-offered!\" That was a gem of a\ntitle. It fired their imaginations. \"I know things that no soldier would\nfind out in a thousand years, and I will tell you some of what I know.\"\n\nNow he had to be careful. If he were to invent too much they might\ndenounce him as a traitor to the \"Hills\" in general. If he were to tell\nthem too little they would lose interest and might very well desert\nhim at the first pinch. He must feel for the middle way and upset no\nprejudices.\n\n\"She has discovered that this mullah Muhammad Anim is no true muslim,\nbut an unbelieving dog of a foreigner from Farangistan! She has\ndiscovered that he plans to make himself an emperor in these Hills, and\nto sell Hillmen into slavery!\" Might as well serve the mullah up hot\nwhile about it! Beyond any doubt not much more than a mile away the\nmullah was getting even by condemning the lot of them to death. \"An eye\nfor the risk of an eye!\" say the unforgiving Hills.\n\n\"If one of us should go back into his camp now he would be tortured. Be\nsure of that.\"\n\nBreathing deeply in the darkness, they nodded, as if the dark had eyes.\nIsmail's chin drove a fraction deeper into his shoulder.\n\n\"Now ye know--for all men know--that the entrance into Khinjan Caves is\nfree to any man who can tell a lie without flinching. It is the way out\nagain that is not free. How many men do ye know that have entered and\nnever returned?\"\n\nThey all nodded again. It was common knowledge that Khinjan was a very\ngraveyard of the presumptuous.\n\n\"She has set a trap for the mullah. She will let him and all his men\nenter and will never let them out again!\"\n\n\"How knowest thou?\" This from two men, one on either hand.\n\n\"Was I never in Khinjan Caves?\" he retorted. \"Whence came I? I am her\nman, sent to help trap the mullah! I would have trapped all you, but\nfor being weary of these 'Hills' and wishful to go back to India and be\npardoned! That is who I am! That is how I know!\"\n\nTheir breath came and went sibilantly, and the darkness was alive with\nthe excitement they thought themselves too warrior-like to utter.\n\n\"But what will she do then?\" asked somebody.\n\nKing searched his memory, and in a moment there came back to him a\npicture of the hurrying jezailchi he had held up in the Khyber Pass,\nand recollection of the man's words.\n\n\"Know ye not,\" he said, \"that long ago she gave leave to all who ate\nthe salt to be true to the salt? She gave the Khyber jezailchis leave to\nfight against her. Be sure, whatever she does, she will stand between no\nman and his pardon!\"\n\n\"But will she lead a jihad? We will not fight against her!\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said King, drawing his breath in. Ismail's chin felt like a knife\nagainst his collar bone, and Ismail's iron fingers clutched his arm.\nIt was time to give his hostage to dame Fortune. \"She will go down into\nIndia and use her influence in the matter of the pardons!\"\n\n\"I believe thou art a very great liar indeed!\" said the man who lacked\npart of his nose. \"The Pathan went, and he did not come back. What proof\nhave we.\"\n\n\"Ye have me!\" said King. \"If I show you no proof, how can I escape you?\"\n\nThey all grunted agreement as to that. King used his elbow to hit Ismail\nin the ribs. He did not dare speak to him; but now was the time for\nIsmail to carry information to her, supposing that to be his job. And\nafter a minute Ismail rolled into a shadow and was gone. King gave him\ntwenty minutes start, letting his men rest their legs and exercise their\ntongues.\n\nNow that he was out of the mullah's clutches--and he suspected Yasmini\nwould know of it within an hour or two, and before dawn in any event--he\nbegan to feel like a player in a game of chess who foresees his opponent\nmate in so many moves.\n\nIf Yasmini were to let the mullah and his men into the Caves and to join\nforces with him in there, he would at least have time to hurry back to\nIndia with his eighty men and give warning. He might have time to call\nup the Khyber jezailchis and blockade the Caves before the hive could\nswarm, and he chuckled to think of the hope of that.\n\nOn the other hand, if there was to be a battle royal between Yasmini and\nthe mullah he would be there to watch it and to comfort India with the\nnews.\n\n\"Now we will go on again, in order to be close to Khinjan at break of\nday,\" he said, and they all got up and obeyed him as if his word had\nbeen law to them for years. Of all of them he was the only man in\ndoubt--he who seemed most confident of all.\n\nThey swung along into the darkness under low-hung stars, trailing behind\nKing's horse, with only half a dozen of them a hundred yards or so ahead\nas an advance guard, and all of them expecting to see Khinjan loom\nabove each next valley, for distances and darkness are deceptive in the\n\"Hills,\" even to trained eyes. Suddenly the advance guard halted, but\ndid not shoot. And as King caught up with them he saw they were talking\nwith some one.\n\nHe had to ride up close before he recognized the Orakzai Pathan.\n\n\"Salaam!\" said the fellow with a grin. \"I bring one hundred and eleven!\"\n\nAs he spoke graveyard shadows rose out of the darkness all around and\nleaned on rifles.\n\n\"Be ye men all ex-soldiers of the raj?\" King asked them.\n\n\"Aye!\" they growled in chorus.\n\n\"What will ye?\"\n\n\"Pardons!\" They all said the word together.\n\n\"Who gave you leave to come?\" King asked.\n\n\"None! He told us of the pardons and we came!\"\n\n\"Aye!\" said the Orakzai Pathan, drawing King aside. \"But she gave me\nleave to seek them out and tempt them!\"\n\n\"And what does she intend?\" King asked him suddenly.\n\n\"She? Ask Allah, who put the spirit in her! How should I know?\"\n\n\"We will march again, my brothers!\" King shouted, and they streamed\nalong behind him, now with no advance guard, but with the Orakzai Pathan\nstriding beside King's horse, with a great hand on the saddle. Like the\nothers, he seemed decided in his mind that the hakim ought not to be\nallowed much chance to escape.\n\nJust as the dawn was tinting the surrounding peaks with softest rose\nthey topped a ridge, and Khinjan lay below them across the mile-wide\nbone-dry valley. They all stood and stared at it, leaning on their guns.\nAll the \"Men with New Eyes\" saw it now for the first time, and it held\nthem speechless, for with its patchwork towers and high battlements it\nlooked like a very city of the spirits that their tales around the fire\non winter nights so linger on.\n\nAnd while they watched, and the Khinjan men were beginning to murmur\n(for they needed no last view of the place to satisfy any longings!)\nnone else than Ismail rose from behind a rock and came to King's\nstirrup. He tugged and King backed his horse until they stood together\napart.\n\n\"She sends this message,\" said Ismail, showing his teeth in the most\npeculiar grin that surely the Hills ever witnessed. And then, omitting\nthe message, he proceeded first to give some news. \"Many of her men who\nhave never been in the army, are none the less true to her, and she will\nnot leave them to the mullah's mercy. They will leave the Caves in a\nlittle while and will come up here. They are to go down into India and\nbe made prisoners if the sirkar will not enlist them. You are to wait\nfor them here.\"\n\n\"Is that all her message?\" King asked him.\n\n\"Nay. That is none of it! This is her message. THOU SHALT KNOW THIS DAY,\nTHOU ENGLISHMAN, WHETHER OR NOT SHE TRULY LOVED THEE! THERE SHALL BE\nPROOF, SUCH AS EVEN THOU SHALT UNDERSTAND!\"'\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Nay, who am I that I should know?\"\n\nIsmail slipped away and lost himself among the men, and none of them\nseemed to notice that he had been away and had come again. On King's\nadvice a dozen men climbed near-by eminences and began to watch for the\nmullah's coming. The Khinjan men murmured openly; they wanted to be off.\n\n\"But no,\" said King. \"Go if ye will, but she has sent word that other\nmen are coming. I wait for them here.\"\n\nAfter a great deal of resentful argument they consented to lie hidden\nfor an hour or two \"but no longer,\" and King hid his horse in a hollow\nand persuaded three of them to gather grass for him. It was a little\nmore than an hour after dawn and the chilled rocks were beginning to\ngrow warmer when the head of a procession came out of Khinjan Gate and\nstarted toward them over the valley. In all more than five hundred men\nemerged and about a hundred women and children, and King's men were\nkept busy for half an hour counting them and quarreling about the\nexact number. Some of them were burdened heavily, and there was much\ndiscussion as to whether to loot them or not. Then:\n\n\"Muhammad Anim comes!\" shouted a voice from a crag top.\n\nThey snuggled into better hiding, and there was no thought now of\nleaving before the mullah should go by. There began to be wagers as to\nwhether her men would be hidden out of sight before the mullah could top\nthe rise; and then, when the last man was safe across the valley and up\nthe cliff and in hiding, there was endless argument as to how much each\nhad betted and to whom he had lost. It needed an effort to quiet them\nwhen the mullah rose into view at last above the rise and paused for a\nminute to stare across at Khinjan before leading his four thousand down\nand onward. He was silent as an image, but his men roared like a river\nin flood and he made no effort to check them. He was like a man who has\nmade up his mind to victory in any event. He seemed to be speculating\nthree or four moves ahead of this one, and to hold this one such a\nforegone conclusion in his mind that it had ceased to interest. He was\nadmirable, there was no doubt of that. In his own way, like an old\nboar sniffing up the wind for trouble, he could command a decent man's\nrespect.\n\nHe dismounted, for he had to, and tossed his reins to the nearest\nman with the air of an emperor. And he led the way dawn the cliffside\nwithout hesitation, striding like a mountaineer. His men followed him\nnoisily, holding hands to make human chains at the difficult places\nand shouting a great deal; but not quite naturally now. They were too\nimpressed by the seriousness of what they undertook, and in their hearts\ntoo much afraid. The noise was bravado.\n\nIt was a weary long wait, watching from the crevices until the last\nman's back departed down the cliff, and the procession--Pied Piper of\nHamelin and rats, (but no music!)--wound across the valley. At last\nKhinjan Gate opened and the mullah led in. The gate did not shut after\nthe last man, King noted that.\n\n\"Let us go now!\" shouted fifty voices, and every man of King's party\nshowed himself and stretched. \"Let us go! Why wait?\"\n\nBut King would not go. Nor would he explain why he would not go. Nor\ncould he tell himself what held him, gazing at Khinjan, except that he\nthought of Yasmini and ached to know what she was doing.\n\nIt was thirty minutes after the last of the mullahs men had vanished\nthrough the gate, and his own men in dozens and twenties were scattered\nalong the cliff-top arguing against delay with growing rancor, when\na lone horseman galloped out of Khinjan Gate and started across the\nvalley. He rode recklessly. He was either panic-stricken or else bolder\nthan the devil.\n\nIn a minute King had recognized the mare, and so had the eyes of fifty\nmen around him. No man with half an eye for a horse could have failed\nto recognize that black mare, having ever seen her once. She came like\na goat among the rocks, just as she had once dived into darkness in the\nKhyber with King following. In another two minutes King had recognized\nthe Rangar's silken turban. And now there was no need to restrain the\nmen; they all stood and watched, to know what new turn affairs were\ntaking.\n\nMost of them were staring downward at the Rangar's head as he urged the\nmare up the cliff path, when the explanation of Yasmini's message came.\nIt was only King, urged by some intuition, who had his eyes fixed on\nKhinjan.\n\nThere came a shock that actually swayed the hill they stood on. The mare\non the path below missed her footing and fell a dozen feet, only to\nget up again and scramble as if a thousand devils were behind her, the\nRangar riding her grimly, like a jockey in a race. Three more shocks\nfollowed. A great slice of Khinjan suddenly caved in with a roar, and\nsmoke and dust burst upward through the tumbling crust.\n\nThere was a pause after that, as if the waiting elements were gathering\nstrength. For ten minutes they watched and scarcely breathed. Rewa Gunga\ngained the summit and, dismounting, stood by King with the reins over\nhis arm. The mare was too blown to do anything but stand and tremble.\nAnd King was too enthralled to do anything but stare.\n\n\"That is what a woman can do for a man!\" said Rewa Gunga grimly. \"She\nset a fuse and exploded all the dynamite. There were tons of it! The\ngalleries must have fallen in, one on the other! A thousand men digging\nfor a thousand years could never get into Khinjan now, and the only way\nout is down Earth's Drink! She bade me come and bid you good-by, sahib.\nI would have stayed in there, but she commanded me. She said, 'Tell King\nsahib my love was true. Tell him I give him India and all Asia that were\nat my mercy!'\"\n\nWhile the Rangar spoke there came three more earth tremors in swift\nsuccession, and a thunder out of Khinjan as if the very \"Hills\" were\ncoming to an end. The mare grew frantic and the Rangar summoned six men\nto hold her.\n\nSuddenly, right over the top of Khinjan's upper rim, where only the\neagles ever perched, there burst a column of water, immeasurable, huge,\nthat for a moment blotted out the sun. It rose sheer upward, curved on\nitself, and fell in a million-ton deluge on to Khinjan and into Khinjan\nvalley, hissing and roaring and thundering.\n\nEarth's Drink had been blocked by the explosion and had found a new\nway over the barrier before plunging down again into the bowels of\nthe world. The one sky-flung leap it made as its weight burst down a\nmountain wall was enough to blot out Khinjan forever, and what had been\na dry mile-wide moat was a shallow lake with death's rack and rubbish\nfloating on the surface.\n\nThe earth rocked. The Hillmen prayed, and King stared, trying to\nmemorize all that had been. Suddenly it flashed across his mind that the\nRangar who had striven like a fiend to stab him only a matter of hours\nago was now standing behind him, within a yard.\n\nHe was up on his feet in a second and faced about. The Rangar laughed.\n\n\"So ends the 'Heart of the Hills!'\" he said. \"Think kindly of her,\nsahib. She thought well enough of you!\"\n\nHe laughed again and sprang on the black mare, and before King could\nspeak or raise a hand to stop him he was off, hell-bent-for-leather\nalong the precipice in the direction of the Khyber Pass and India. Two\nof the men who had come out of Khinjan mounted and spurred after him.\n\nKing collected his men and the women and children. It was easy, for they\nwere numb from what they had witnessed and dazed by fear. In half an\nhour he had them mustered and marching.\n\n\"Let us go back and loot the mullah's camp and take the women!\" urged a\ndozen men at least.\n\n\"Go then!\" said King. \"Go back! But I go on!\"\n\n\"He is afraid! The hakim is afraid of what he saw!\"\n\nKing let them think so. He let them think anything they chose, knowing\nwell that what had unnerved him had at least rendered them amenable to\nleading. They would have no more dared go back without him, and without\nat least a hundred others, than they would have dared go and hunt in the\nruins of Khinjan.\n\nEven Ismail clang to his stirrup and would not leave him, looking like\na fledgling with his beard all new-sprouted on his jaw, and eyes wider\nthan any bird's.\n\n\"Why art thou here?\" King asked him. \"Had she no true men who would die\nwith her?\"\n\nThe Afridi scowled, but choked the answer back.\n\n\"Art thou my man now?\" King asked him. But he shook his head.\n\nSo they marched without talking over the hideous boulder-strewn range\nthat separates Khinjan from the Khyber, sleeping fitfully whenever King\ncalled a halt, and eating almost nothing at all, for only a few of them\nhad thought of bringing food.\n\nThey reached the Khyber famished and were fed at Ali Masjid Fort, after\nKing had given a certain password and had whispered to the officer\ncommanding. But he did not change into European clothes yet, and none of\nhis following suspected him of being an Englishman.\n\n\"A Rangar on a black mare has gone down the pass ahead of you in a\nhurry,\" they told him at Ali Masjid. \"He had two men with him and food\nenough. Only stopped long enough to make his business known.\"\n\n\"What did he say his business is?\" asked King.\n\n\"He gave a sign and said a word that satisfied us--on that point!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said King. \"Can you signal down the Pass?\"\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"Courtenay still at Jamrud?\"\n\n\"Yes. In charge there and growing tired of doing nothing.\"\n\n\"Signal down and ask him to have that bath ready for me that I spoke\nabout. Good-by.\"\n\nSo he left Ali Masjid at the head of a motley procession that grew\nnoisier and more confident every hour. Ismail still clung to his\nstirrup, but began to grow more lively and to have a good many orders to\nfling to the rest.\n\n\"You mourn like a dog,\" King told him. \"Three howls and a whine and a\nlittle sulking--and then forgetfulness!\"\n\nIsmail looked nasty at that but did not answer, although he seemed to\nhave a hot word ready. And thenceforward he hung his head more, and at\nleast tried to seem bereaved. But his manner was unconvincing none the\nless, and King found it food for thought.\n\nThe ex-soldiers and would-be soldiers marched in fours behind him,\ngrowing hourly more like drilled men, and talking, with each stride that\nbrought them nearer India, more as men do who have an interest in law\nand order. Behind them tramped the women from Khinjan, carrying their\nbabies and their husbands loads; and behind them again were the other\nwomen, who had been told they would be overtaken in the Khyber, but who\nhad actually had to run themselves raw-footed in order to catch up.\n\nDown the Khyber have come conquerors, a dozen conquering kings, and as\nmany beaten armies; but surely no stranger host than this ever trudged\nbetween the echoing walls. The very eagles screamed at them.\n\nAnd as they neared Jamrud Fort the men who sought pardons began to grow\nsheepish. They began to remember that the hakim might after all be a\ntrickster, and to realize how much too friendly--how almost intimate he\nhad been with the sahibs at Ali Masjid. They began to cluster round\nhim instead of letting him lead, and by the time they met the farthest\noutposts up the Khyber they were as nervous as raw recruits and ready to\nturn and bolt at a word--for no one can be more timid than your Hillman\nwhen he is not sure of himself, just as no one can be braver when he\nknows his ground.\n\nSignals preceded them, and Courtenay himself rode up the Pass to greet\nthem. But of course he was not very cordial to King, considering his\ndisguise; and he chose to keep the Hillmen in doubt yet as to their\neventual reception. But one of them, the Orakzai Pathan (for nothing\ncould completely unman him), shouted to know whether it was true that\npardons had been offered for deserters, and Courtenay nodded. They were\nless timid after that. Some of them pulled medals out and pinned them\noutside their shirts.\n\nAt Jamrud they were given food and their rifles were taken away from\nthem and a guard was set to watch them. But the guard only consisted\nof two men, both of whom were Pathans, and they assured them that,\nridiculous though it sounded, the British were actually willing to\nforgive their enemies and to pardon all deserters who applied for pardon\non condition of good faith in the future.\n\nThat night they prayed to Allah like little children lost and found. The\nwomen crooned love-songs to their babies over the clear fires and the\nmen talked--and talked--and talked until the stars grew big as moons to\nweary eyes and they slept at last, to dream of khaki uniforms and karnel\nsahibs who knew neither fear nor favor and who said things that were so.\nIt is a mad world to the Himalayan Hillman where men in authority tell\ntruth unadorned without shame and without consideration--a mad, mad\nworld, and perhaps too exotic to be wholesome, but pleasant while the\ndream lasts.\n\nOver in the fort Courtenay placed a bath at King's disposal and lent him\nclean clothes and a razor. But he was not very cordial.\n\n\"Tell me all the war news!\" said King, splashing in the tub. And\nCourtenay told him, passing him another cake of soap when the first\nwas finished. After all there was not much to tell--butchery in\nBelgium--Huns and guns--and the everlastingly glorious stand that saved\nParis and France and Europe.\n\n\"According to the cables our men are going the records one better. I\nthink that's all,\" said Courtenay.\n\n\"Then why the stuffiness?\" asked King. \"Why am I talked to at the end of\na tube, so to speak?\"\n\n\"You're under arrest!\" said Courtenay.\n\n\"The deuce I am!\"\n\n\"I'm taking care of you myself to obviate the necessity of putting a\nsentry on guard over you.\"\n\n\"Good of you, I'm sure. What's it all about?\"\n\n\"I don't mind telling you, but I'd rather you'd wait. The minute you\nwere sighted word was wired down to headquarters, and the general\nhimself will be up here by train any minute.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said King. \"Got a cigar? Got a black one? Blacker the\nbetter!\"\n\nHe was out of his bath and remembered that minute that he had not smoked\na cigar since leaving India. Naked, shaved, with some of the stain\nremoved, he did not look like a man in trouble as he filled his lungs\nwith the saltpeterish smoke of a fat Trichinopoli.\n\nAnd then the general came and did not wait for King to get dressed but\nburst into the bathroom and shook hands with him while he was still\nnaked and asked ten questions (like a gatling gun) while King was\ngetting on his trousers, divining each answer after the third word and\nwaving the rest aside.\n\n\"And why am I arrested, sir?\" asked King the moment he could slip the\nquestion in edgewise.\n\n\"Oh, yes, of course. Try the case here as well as anywhere. What does\nthis mean?\"\n\nOut of his pocket the general produced a letter that smelt strongly of\na scent King recognized. He spread it out on a table, and King read. It\nwas Yasmini's letter that she had sent down the Khyber to make India too\nhot to hold him.\n\n        \"Your Captain King has been too much trouble.  He has\n        taken money from the Germans.  He adopted native dress.\n        He called himself Kurram Khan.  He slew his own brother\n        at night in the Khyber Pass.  These men will say that\n        he carried the head to Khinjan, and their word is true.\n        I, Yasmini, saw.  He used the head for a passport to\n        obtain admittance.  He proclaims a jihad!  He urges\n        invasion of India!  He held up his brother's head before\n        five thousand men and boasted of the murder.  The next\n        you shall hear of your Captain King of the Khyber Rifles\n        he will be leading a jihad into India.  You would have\n        better trusted me.  Yasmini.\"\n\n\"Too bad about your brother,\" said the general.\n\n\"The body is buried. How much is true about the head?\"\n\nKing told him.\n\n\"Where's she?\" asked the general.\n\nKing did not answer. The general waited.\n\n\"I don't know, sir.\"\n\n\"Ask the Rangar,\" Courtenay suggested.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked King.\n\n\"Caught him coming down the Khyber on his black mare and arrested him.\nHe's in the next room! I hope he's to be hanged. So that I can buy the\nmare,\" he added cheerfully.\n\nKing whistled softly to himself, and the general looked at him through\nhalf-closed eyes.\n\n\"Go in and talk to him, King. Let me know the result.\"\n\nHe had picked King to go up the Khyber on that errand not for nothing.\nHe knew King and he knew the symptoms. Without answering him King\nobeyed. He went out of the room into a dark corridor and rapped on the\ndoor of the next room to the right. There was a muffled answer from\nwithin. Courtenay shouted something to the sentry outside the door and\nhe called another man who fitted a key in the lock. King walked into a\nroom in which one lamp was burning and the door slammed shut behind him.\n\nHe was in there an hour, and it never did transpire just what passed,\nfor he can hold his tongue on any subject like a clam, and the general,\nif anything, can go him one better. Courtenay was placed under orders\nnot to talk, so those who say they know exactly what happened in the\nroom between the time when the door was shut on King and the time when\nhe knocked to have it opened and called for the general, are not telling\nthe truth.\n\nWhat is known is that finally the general hurried through the door and\nejaculated, \"Well, I'm damned!\" before it could close again. The sentry\n(Punjabi Mussulman) has sworn to that over a dozen camp-fires since the\nday.\n\nAnd it is known, too, for the sentry has taken oath on it and has told\nthe story so many times without much variation that no one who knows the\nman's record doubts any longer--it is known that when the door opened\nagain King and the general walked out, with the Rangar between them. And\nthe Rangar had no turban on, but carried it unwound in his hand. And his\ngolden hair fell nearly to his knees and changed his whole appearance.\nAnd he was weeping. And he was not a Rangar at all, but she, and how\nanybody can ever have mistaken her for a man, even in man's clothes and\nwith her skin darkened, was beyond the sentry's power to guess. He for\none, etc.... But nobody believed that part of his tale.\n\nAs Yussuf bin Ali said over the camp-fire up the Khyber later on, \"When\nshe sets out to disguise herself, she is what she will be, and he who\nsays he thinks otherwise has two tongues and no conscience!\"\n\nWhat is surely true is that the four of them--Yasmini, the general,\nCourtenay and King sat up all night in a room in the fort, talking\ntogether, while a succession of sentries overstrained their ears\nendeavoring to hear through keyholes. And the sentries heard nothing and\ninvented very much.\n\nBut Partan Singh, the Sikh, who carried in bread and cocoa to them at\nabout five the next morning and found them still talking, heard King\nsay, \"So, in my opinion, sir, there'll be no jihad in these parts.\nThere'll be sporadic raids, of course, but nothing a brigade can't deal\nwith. The heart of the holy war's torn out and thrown away.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the general. \"You can get up the Khyber again and join\nyour regiment.\"'\n\nBut by that time the Rangar's turban was on again and the tears were\ndry, and it was Partan Singh who threw most doubt on the sentry's tale\nabout the golden hair. But, as the sentry said, no doubt Partan Singh\nwas jealous.\n\nThere is no doubt whatever that the general went back to Peshawur in the\ntrain at eight o'clock and that the Rangar went with him in a separate\ncompartment with about a dozen Hillmen chosen from among those who had\ncome down with King.\n\nAnd it is certain that before they went King had a talk with the Rangar\nin a room alone, of which conversation, however, the sentry reported\nafterward that he did not overhear one word; and he had to go to the\ndoctor with a cold in his ear at that. He said he was nearly sure he\nheard weeping. But on the other hand, those who saw both of them come\nout were certain that both were smiling.\n\nIt is quite certain that Athelstan King went up the Khyber again, for\nthe official records say so, and they never lie, especially in time of\nwar. He rode a coal-black mare, and Courtenay called him \"Chikki\"--a\n\"lifter.\"\n\nSome say the Rangar went to Delhi. Some say Yasmini is in Delhi. Some\nsay no. But it is quite certain that before he started up the Khyber\nKing showed Courtenay a great gold bracelet that he had under his\nsleeve. Five men saw him do it.\n\nAnd if that was really Rewa Gunga in the general's train, why was the\ngeneral so painfully polite to him? And why did Ismail insist on riding\nin the train, instead of accepting King's offer to go up the Khyber with\nhim?\n\nOne thing is very certain. King was right about the jihad. There has\nbeen none in spite of all Turkey's and Germany's efforts. There have\nbeen sporadic raids, much as usual, but nothing one brigade could not\neasily deal with, the paid press to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nKing of the Khyber Rifles is now a major, for you can see that by\nturning up the army list.\n\nBut if you wish to know just what transpired in the room in Jamrud Fort\nwhile the general and Courtenay waited, you must ask King--if you dare;\nfor only he knows, and one other. It is not likely you can find the\nother.\n\nBut it is likely that you may hear from both of them again, for \"A woman\nand intrigue are one!\" as India says. The war seems long, and the world\nis large, and the chances for intrigue are almost infinite, given such\ncombination as King and Yasmini and a love affair.\n\nAnd as King says on occasion: \"Kuch dar nahin hai! There is no such\nthing as fear!\" Another one might say, \"The roof's the limit!\"\n\nAnd bear in mind, for this is important: King wrote to Yasmini a letter,\nin Urdu from the mullah's cave, in which he as good as gave her his word\nof honor to be her \"loyal servant\" should she choose to return to her\nallegiance. He is no splitter of hairs, no quibbler. His word is good on\nthe darkest night or wherever he casts a shadow in the sun.\n\n\"A man and his promise--a woman and intrigue--are one!\"\n\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's King--of the Khyber Rifles, by Talbot Mundy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK KING--OF THE KHYBER RIFLES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6066.txt or 6066.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/0/6/6066/\n\nProduced by M.R.J.\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
