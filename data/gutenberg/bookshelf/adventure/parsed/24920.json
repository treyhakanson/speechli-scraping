Enthusiasm, reflected\nthe elder man, was one of the qualities which were most desirable in the\nman who was to accept the position which Malcolm Hay was at that moment\nconsidering.\n\n\"Russia is a strange country,\" said Mr. Tremayne. \"It is one of the\nmystery places of the world. You hear fellows coming back from China who\ntell you amazing stories of the idiosyncrasies of the Chink. But I can\ntell you, from my own personal observations, that the Chinaman is an\nopen book in words of one syllable compared with the average Russian\npeasant. By the way, you speak Russian, I understand?\"\n\nHay nodded.\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" he said, \"I have been talking Russian ever since I was\nsixteen, and I speak both the dialects.\"\n\n\"Good!\" nodded Mr. Tremayne. \"Now, all that remains for you to do is to\nthink both dialects. I was in Southern Russia attending to our wells for\ntwenty years. In fact, long before our wells came into being, and I can\nhonestly say that, though I am not by any means an unintelligent man, I\nknow just as little about the Russian to-day as I did when I went there.\nHe's the most elusive creature. You think you know him two days after\nyou have met him. Two days later you find that you have changed all your\nopinions about him; and by the end of the first year, if you have kept a\ncareful note of your observations and impressions in a diary, you will\ndiscover that you have three hundred and sixty-five different\nviews--unless it happens to be a leap year.\"\n\n\"What happens in a leap year?\" asked the innocent Hay.\n\n\"You have three hundred and sixty-six views,\" said the solemn Mr.\nTremayne.\n\nHe struck a bell.\n\n\"We shan't want you to leave London for a week or two,\" he said, \"and in\nthe meantime you had better study up our own special literature. We can\ngive you particulars about the country--that part of the country in\nwhich the wells are situated--which you will not find in the guidebooks.\nThere are also a few notable personages whom it will be advisable for\nyou to study.\"\n\n\"I know most of them,\" said the youth with easy confidence. \"As a matter\nof fact, I got the British Consul to send me a local directory and\nswotted it.\"\n\nMr. Tremayne concealed a smile.\n\n\"And what did the local directory say about Israel Kensky?\" he asked\ninnocently.\n\n\"Israel Kensky?\" said the puzzled youth. \"I don't remember that name.\"\n\n\"It is the only name worth remembering,\" said the other dryly, \"and, by\nthe way, you'll be able to study him in a strange environment, for he is\nin London at this moment.\"\n\nA clerk had answered the bell and stood waiting in the doorway.\n\n\"Get Mr. Hay those books and pamphlets I spoke to you about,\" said\nTremayne. \"And, by the way, when did M. Kensky arrive?\"\n\n\"To-day,\" said the clerk.\n\nTremayne nodded.\n\n\"In fact,\" he said, \"London this week will be filled with people whose\nnames are not in your precious directory, and all of whom you should\nknow. The Yaroslavs are paying a sort of state visit.\"\n\n\"The Yaroslavs?\" repeated Hay. \"Oh, of course----\"\n\n\"The Grand Duke and his daughter,\" added Mr. Tremayne.\n\n\"Well,\" smiled the young man, \"I'm not likely to meet the Grand Duke or\nthe Grand Duchess. I understand the royal family of Russia is a little\nexclusive.\"\n\n\"Everything is likely in Russia,\" said the optimistic Mr. Tremayne. \"If\nyou come back in a few years' time and tell me that you've been\nappointed an admiral in the Russian Navy, or that you've married the\nGrand Duchess Irene Yaroslav, I shall not for one moment disbelieve you.\nAt the same time, if you come back from Russia without your ears, the\nsame having been cut off by your peasant neighbours to propitiate the\nghost of a martyr who died six hundred years ago, I shall not be\nsurprised either. That is the country you're going to--and I envy you.\"\n\n\"I'm a little surprised at myself,\" admitted Malcolm, \"it seems almost\nincredible. Of course, sir, I have a lot to learn and I'm not placing\ntoo much reliance upon my degree.\"\n\n\"Your science degree?\" said Tremayne. \"It may be useful, but a divinity\ndegree would have been better.\"\n\n\"A divinity degree?\"\n\nTremayne nodded.\n\n\"It is religion you want in Russia, and especially local religion.\nYou'll have to do a mighty lot of adapting when you're out there, Hay,\nand I don't think you could do better than get acquainted with the local\nsaints. You'll find that the birth or death of four or five of them are\ncelebrated every week, and that your workmen will take a day's holiday\nfor each commemoration. If you're not pretty smart, they'll whip in a\nfew saints who have no existence, and you'll get no work done at\nall--that will do.\"\n\nHe ended the interview with a jerk of his head, and as the young man got\nto his feet to go, added: \"Come back again to-morrow. I think you ought\nto see Kensky.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\" asked Hay courteously. \"A local magnate?\"\n\n\"In a sense he is and in a sense he's not,\" said the careful Mr.\nTremayne. \"He's a big man locally, and from a business point of view, I\nsuppose he is a magnate. However, you'll be able to judge for yourself.\"\n\nMalcolm Hay went out into the teeming streets of London, walking on air.\nIt was his first appointment--he was earning money, and it seemed\nrather like a high-class dream.\n\nIn Maida Vale there are many little side streets, composed of shabby\nhouses covered with discoloured stucco, made all the more desolate and\ngloomy in appearance by the long and narrow strip of \"garden\" which runs\nout to the street. In one of these, devoted to the business of a\nboarding-house, an old man sat at a portable bench, under the one\nelectric light which the economical landlady had allowed him. The room\nwas furnished in a typically boarding-house style.\n\nBut both the worker at the bench, and the woman who sat by the table,\nher chin on her palms, watching him, seemed unaffected by the poverty of\ntheir surroundings. The man was thin and bent of back. As he crouched\nover the bench, working with the fine tools on what was evidently\nintended to be the leather cover of a book, his face lay in the shadow,\nand only the end of his straggling white beard betrayed his age.\n\nPresently he looked up at the woman and revealed himself as a hawk-nosed\nman of sixty. His face was emaciated and seamed, and his dark eyes shone\nbrightly. His companion was a woman of twenty-four, obviously of the\nJewish type, as was the old man; what good looks she possessed were\nmarred by the sneer on her lips.\n\n\"If these English people see you at work,\" she said presently, \"they\nwill think you are some poor man, little father.\"\n\nIsrael Kensky did not stop his work.\n\n\"What book are you binding?\" she asked after awhile. \"Is it the Talmud\nwhich Levi Leviski gave you?\"\n\nThe old man did not answer, and a dark frown gathered on the woman's\nheavy face. You might not guess that they were father and daughter, yet\nsuch was the case. But between Sophia Kensky and her father there was\nneither communion of spirit nor friendship. It was amazing that she\nshould accompany him, as she did, wherever he went, or that he should be\ncontent to have her as his companion. The gossips of Kieff had it that\nneither would trust the other out of sight; and it may be that there was\nsomething in this, though a stronger motive might be suspected in so far\nas Sophia's actions were concerned.\n\nPresently the old man put down his tools, blinked, and pushed back his\nchair.\n\n\"It is a design for a great book,\" he said, and chuckled hoarsely. \"A\nbook with steel covers and wonderful pages.\" He smiled contemptuously.\n\"The Book of All-Power,\" he said.\n\n\"Little father, there are times when I think you are mad. For how can\nyou know the secrets which are denied to others? And you who write so\nbadly, how can you fill a great book with your writings?\"\n\n\"The Book of All-Power,\" repeated the man, and the smile on the woman's\nface grew broader.\n\n\"A wonderful book!\" she scoffed, \"filled with magic and mystery and\nspells--do you wonder that we of Kieff suspect you?\"\n\n\"We of Kieff?\" he repeated mockingly, and she nodded.\n\n\"We of Kieff,\" she said.\n\n\"So you are with the rabble, Sophia!\" He lifted one shoulder in a\ncontemptuous little gesture.\n\n\"You are also of the rabble, Israel Kensky,\" she said. \"Do you take your\ndinner in the Grand Duke's palace?\"\n\nHe was gathering together the tools on the table, and methodically\nfitting each graver into a big leather purse.\n\n\"The Grand Duke does not stone me in the street, nor set fire to my\nhouses,\" he said.\n\n\"Nor the Grand Duchess,\" said the girl meaningly, and he looked at her\nfrom under his lowered brows.\n\n\"The Grand Duchess is beyond the understanding of such as you,\" he said\nharshly, and the woman laughed.\n\n\"There will come a day when she will be on her knees to me,\" she said\nprophetically, and she got up from the table with a heavy yawn. \"That I\npromise myself, and with this promise I put myself to sleep every\nnight.\"\n\nShe went on and she spoke without heat.\n\n\"I see her sweeping my floors and eating the bread I throw to her.\"\n\nIsrael Kensky had heard all this before, and did not even smile.\n\n\"You are an evil woman, Sophia,\" he said. \"God knows how such a one\ncould be a daughter of mine. What has the Grand Duchess done to you that\nyou should harbour such venom?\"\n\n\"I hate her because she is,\" said the woman evenly. \"I hate her not for\nthe harm she has done me, but for the proud smile she gives to her\nslaves. I hate her because she is high and I am low, and because all the\ntime she is marking the difference between us.\"\n\n\"You are a fool,\" said Israel Kensky as he left the room.\n\n\"Perhaps I am,\" said the woman, his daughter. \"Are you going to bed\nnow?\"\n\nHe turned in the doorway.\n\n\"I am going to my room. I shall not come down again,\" he said.\n\n\"Then I will sleep,\" she yawned prodigiously. \"I hate this town.\"\n\n\"Why did you come?\" he asked. \"I did not want you.\"\n\n\"I came because you did not want me,\" said Sophia Kensky.\n\nIsrael went to his room, closed the door and locked it. He listened and\npresently he heard the sound of his daughter's door close also and heard\nthe snap of the key as it turned. But it was a double snap, and he knew\nthat the sound was intended for him and that the second click was the\nunlocking of the door. She had locked and unlocked it in one motion. He\nwaited, sitting in an arm-chair before a small fire, for ten minutes,\nand then, rising, crossed the room softly and switched out the light.\nThere was a transom above the door, so that anybody in the passage\noutside could tell whether his light was on or off. Then he resumed his\nseat, spreading his veined hands to the fire, and listened.\n\nHe waited another quarter of an hour before he heard a soft creak and\nthe sound of breathing outside the door. Somebody was standing there\nlistening. The old man kept his eyes fixed on the fire, but his senses\nwere alive to every sound. Again he heard the creaking, this time\nlouder. A jerry-built house in Maida Vale does not offer the best\nassistance to the furtive business in which Sophia Kensky was engaged.\nAnother creak, this time farther away and repeated at intervals, told\nhim that she was going down the stairs. He walked to the window and\ngently pulled up the blind, taking his station so that he could command\na view of the narrow strip of garden. Presently his vigil was rewarded.\nHe saw her dark figure walk along the flagged pavement, open the gate\nand disappear into the darkened street.\n\nIsrael Kensky went back to his chair, stirred the fire and settled down\nto a long wait, his lined face grave and anxious.\n\nThe woman had turned to the right and had walked swiftly to the end of\nthe street. The name of that street, or its pronunciation, were beyond\nher. She neither spoke English, nor was she acquainted with the\ntopography of the district in which she found herself. She slowed her\npace as she reached the main road and a man came out of the shadows to\nmeet her.\n\n\"Is it you, little mother?\" he asked in Russian.\n\n\"Thank God you're here! Who is this?\" asked Sophia breathlessly.\n\n\"Boris Yakoff,\" said the other, \"I have been waiting for an hour, and it\nis very cold.\"\n\n\"I could not get away before,\" she said as she fell in beside him. \"The\nold man was working with his foolery and it was impossible to get him to\ngo to bed. Once or twice I yawned, but he took no notice.\"\n\n\"Why has he come to London?\" asked her companion. \"It must be something\nimportant to bring him away from his money-bags.\"\n\nTo this the woman made no reply. Presently she asked:\n\n\"Do we walk? Is there no droski or little carriage?\"\n\n\"Have patience, have patience!\" grinned the man good humouredly. \"Here\nin London we do things in grand style. We have an auto-car for you. But\nit was not wise to bring it so close to your house, little mother. The\nold man----\"\n\n\"Oh, finish with the old man,\" she said impatiently; \"do not forget that\nI am with him all the day.\"\n\nThe antipathy between father and daughter was so well known that the man\nmade no apology for discussing the relationship with that frankness\nwhich is characteristic of the Russian peasant. Nor did Sophia Kensky\nresent the questions of a stranger, nor hesitate to unburden herself of\nher grievances. The \"auto-car\" proved to be a very common-place\ntaxi-cab, though a vehicle of some luxury to Yakoff.\n\n\"They say he practises magic,\" said that garrulous man, as the taxi got\non its way; \"also that he bewitches you.\"\n\n\"That is a lie,\" said the woman indifferently: \"he frightens me\nsometimes, but that is because I have here\"--she tapped her\nforehead--\"a memory which is not a memory. I seem to remember something\njust at the end of a thread, and I reach for it, and lo! it is gone!\"\n\n\"That is magic,\" said Yakoff gravely. \"Evidently he practises his spells\nupon you. Tell me, Sophia Kensky, is it true that you Jews use the blood\nof Christian children for your beastly ceremonies?\"\n\nThe woman laughed.\n\n\"What sort of man are you that you believe such things?\" she asked\ncontemptuously. \"I thought all the comrades in London were educated?\"\n\nYakoff made a little clicking noise with his mouth to betray his\nannoyance. And well he might resent this reflection upon his education,\nfor he held a university degree and had translated six revolutionary\nRussian novels into English and French. This, he explained with some\ndetail, and the girl listened with little interest. She was not\nsurprised that an educated man should believe the fable of human\nsacrifices, which had gained a certain currency in Russia. Only it\nseemed to her just a little inexplicable.\n\nThe cab turned out of the semi-obscurity of the side street into a\nbrilliantly lighted thoroughfare and bowled down a broad and busy road.\nA drizzle of rain was falling and blurred the glass; but even had the\nwindows been open, she could not have identified her whereabouts.\n\n\"To what place are you taking me?\" she asked. \"Where is the meeting?\"\n\nYakoff lowered his voice to a husky whisper.\n\n\"It is the caf\u00e9 of the Silver Lion, in a place called Soho,\" he said.\n\"Here we meet from day to day and dream of a free Russia. We also play\nbagatelle.\" He gave the English name for the latter. \"It is a club and a\nrestaurant. To-night it is necessary that you should be here, Sophia\nKensky, because of the great happenings which must follow.\"\n\nShe was silent for awhile, then she asked whether it was safe, and he\nlaughed.\n\n\"Safe!\" he scoffed. \"There are no secret police in London. This is a\nfree country, where one may do as one wishes. No, no, Sophia Kensky, be\nnot afraid.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" she answered, \"but tell me, Yakoff, what is this\ngreat meeting about?\"\n\n\"You shall learn, you shall learn, little sister,\" said Yakoff\nimportantly.\n\nHe might have added that he also was to learn, for as yet he was in\nignorance.\n\nThey drove into a labyrinth of narrow streets and stopped suddenly\nbefore a doorway. There was no sign of a restaurant, and Yakoff\nexplained, before he got out of the cab, that this was the back\nentrance to the Silver Lion, and that most of the brethren who used the\nclub also used this back door.\n\nHe dismissed the cab and pressed a bell in the lintel of the door.\nPresently it was opened and they passed in unchallenged. They were in a\nsmall hallway, lighted with a gas-jet. There was a stairway leading to\nthe upper part of the premises, and a narrower stairway, also lighted by\ngas, at the foot leading to the cellar; and it was down the latter that\nYakoff moved, followed by the girl.\n\nThey were now in another passage, whitewashed and very orderly. A\ngas-jet lit this also, and at one end the girl saw a plain, wooden door.\nTo this Yakoff advanced and knocked. A small wicket, set in the panel,\nwas pushed aside, and after a brief scrutiny by the door's custodian, it\nwas opened and the two entered without further parley.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA GUN-MAN REFUSES WORK\n\n\nIt was a big underground room, the sort of basement dining-room one\nfinds in certain of the caf\u00e9s in Soho, and its decorations and furniture\nwere solid and comfortable. There were a dozen men in this\ninnocent-looking saloon when the girl entered. They were standing about\ntalking, or sitting at the tables playing games. The air was blue with\ntobacco smoke.\n\nHer arrival seemed to be the signal for the beginning of a conference.\nFour small tables were drawn from the sides and placed together, and in\na few seconds she found herself one of a dozen that sat about the board.\n\nThe man who seemed to take charge of the proceedings she did not know.\nHe was a Russian--a big, clean-shaven man, quietly and even\nwell-dressed. His hair was flaming red, his nose was crooked. It was\nthis crooked nose which gave her a clue to his identity. She remembered\nin Kieff, where physical peculiarities could not pass unnoticed, some\nreference to \"twist nose,\" and racked her brains in an effort to recall\nwho that personage was. That he knew her he very quickly showed.\n\n\"Sophia Kensky,\" he said, \"we have sent for you to ask you why your\nfather is in London.\"\n\n\"If you know my father,\" she replied, \"you know also that I, his\ndaughter, do not share his secrets.\"\n\nThe man at the head of the table nodded.\n\n\"I know him,\" he said grimly, \"also I know you, Sophia. I have seen you\noften at the meetings of our society in Kieff.\"\n\nAgain she frowned, trying to recall his name and where she had seen him.\nIt was not at any of the meetings of the secret society--of that she was\nsure. He seemed to read her thoughts, for he laughed--a deep, thunderous\nlaugh which filled the underground room with sound.\n\n\"It is strange that you do not know me,\" he said, \"and yet I have seen\nyou a hundred times, and you have seen me.\"\n\nA light dawned on her.\n\n\"Boolba, the _buffet-schek_ of the Grand Duke!\" she gasped.\n\nHe nodded, absurdly pleased at the recognition.\n\n\"I do not attend the meetings in Kieff, little sister, for reasons which\nyou will understand. But here in London, where I have come in advance\nof Yaroslav, it is possible. Now, Sophia Kensky, you are a proved friend\nof our movement?\"\n\nShe nodded, since the statement was in the way of a question.\n\n\"It is known to you, as to us, that your father, Israel Kensky, is a\nfriend of the Grand Duchess.\"\n\nBoolba, the President, saw the sullen look on her face and drew his own\nconclusions, even before she explained her antipathy to the young girl\nwho held that exalted position.\n\n\"It is a mystery to me, Boolba,\" she said, \"for what interest can this\ngreat lady have in an old Jew?\"\n\n\"The old Jew is rich,\" said Boolba significantly.\n\n\"So also is Irene Yaroslav,\" said the girl. \"It is not for money that\nshe comes.\"\n\n\"It is not for money,\" agreed the other, \"it is for something else. When\nthe Grand Duchess Irene was a child, she was in the streets of Kieff one\nday in charge of her nurse. It happened that some Caucasian soldiers\nstationed in the town started a pogrom against the Jews. The soldiers\nwere very drunk; they were darting to and fro in the street on their\nlittle horses, and the nurse became frightened and left the child. Your\nfather was in hiding, and the soldiers were searching for him; yet, when\nhe saw the danger of the Grand Duchess, he ran from his hiding-place,\nsnatched her up under the hoofs of the horses, and bore her away into\nhis house.\"\n\n\"I did not know this,\" said Sophia, listening open-mouthed. Her father\nhad never spoken of the incident, and the curious affection which this\nhigh-born lady had for the old usurer of Kieff had ever been a source of\nwonder to her.\n\n\"You know it now,\" said Boolba. \"The Grand Duke has long since forgotten\nwhat he owes to Israel Kensky, but the Grand Duchess has not. Therefore,\nshe comes to him with all her troubles--and that, Sophia Kensky, is why\nwe have sent for you.\"\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"I see,\" she said at last, \"you wish me to spy upon Israel Kensky and\ntell you all that happens.\"\n\n\"I want to know all that passes between him and the Grand Duchess,\" said\nBoolba. \"She comes to London to-morrow with her father, and it is\ncertain she will seek out Israel Kensky. Every letter that passes\nbetween them must be opened.\"\n\n\"But----\" she began.\n\n\"There is no 'but,'\" roared Boolba. \"Hear and obey; it is ordered!\"\n\nHe turned abruptly to the man on his left.\n\n\"You understand, Yaroslav arrives in London to-morrow. It is desirable\nthat he should not go away.\"\n\n\"But, but, Excellency,\" stammered the man on his left, \"here in London!\"\n\nBoolba nodded.\n\n\"But, Excellency,\" wailed the man, \"in London we are safe; it is the one\nrefuge to which our friends can come. If such a thing should happen,\nwhat would be our fate? We could not meet together. We should be hounded\ndown by the police from morning until night; we should be deported--it\nwould be the ruin of the great movement.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, it is an order,\" said Boolba doggedly; \"this is a matter\nbeyond the cause. It will gain us powerful protectors at the court, and\nI promise you that, though the commotion will be great, yet it will not\nlast for very long, and you will be left undisturbed.\"\n\n\"But----\" began one of the audience, and Boolba silenced him with a\ngesture.\n\n\"I promise that none of you shall come to harm, my little pigeons, and\nthat you shall not be concerned in this matter.\"\n\n\"But who will do it, Excellency?\" asked another member.\n\n\"That is too important to be decided without a meeting of all the\nbrethren. For my part, I would not carry out such an order unless I\nreceived the instructions of our President.\"\n\n\"I promise that none of you shall take a risk,\" sneered Boolba. \"Now\nspeak, Yakoff!\"\n\nThe man who had accompanied Sophia Kensky smiled importantly at the\ncompany, then turned to Sophia.\n\n\"Must I say this before Sophia Kensky?\" he asked.\n\n\"Speak,\" said Boolba. \"We are all brothers and sisters, and none will\nbetray you.\"\n\nYakoff cleared his throat.\n\n\"When your Excellency wrote to me from Kieff, asking me to find a man, I\nwas in despair,\" he began--an evidently rehearsed speech, \"I tore my\nhair, I wept----\"\n\n\"Tell us what you have done,\" said the impatient Boolba. \"For what does\nit matter, in the name of the saints and the holy martyrs\" (everyone at\nthe table, including Boolba, crossed himself) \"whether your hair was\ntorn or your head was hammered?\"\n\n\"It was a difficult task, Excellency,\" said Yakoff in a more subdued\ntone, \"but Providence helped me. There is a good comrade of ours who is\nengaged in punishing the bourgeoisie by relieving them of their\ngoods----\"\n\n\"A thief, yes,\" said Boolba.\n\n\"Through him I learnt that a certain man had arrived in England and was\nin hiding. This man is a professional assassin.\"\n\nThey looked at him incredulously, all except Boolba, who had heard the\nstory before.\n\n\"An assassin?\" said one. \"Of what nationality?\"\n\n\"American,\" said Yakoff, and there was a little titter of laughter.\n\n\"It is true,\" interrupted Boolba. \"This man, whom Yakoff has found, is\nwhat is known in New York as a gun-man. He belongs to a gang which was\nhunted down by the police, and our comrade escaped.\"\n\n\"But an American!\" persisted one of the unconvinced.\n\n\"An American,\" said Yakoff. \"This man is desired by the police on this\nside, and went in hiding with our other comrade, who recognized him.\"\n\n\"A gun-man,\" said Boolba thoughtfully, and he used the English word with\nsome awkwardness. \"A gun-man. If he would only--is he here?\" he\ndemanded, looking up.\n\nYakoff nodded.\n\n\"Does he know----\"\n\n\"I have told him nothing, Excellency,\" said Yakoff, rising from the\ntable with alacrity, \"except to be here, near the entrance to the club,\nat this hour. Shall I bring him down?\"\n\nBoolba nodded, and three minutes later, into this queer assembly,\nsomething of a fish out of water and wholly out of his element, strode\nCherry Bim, that redoubtable man.\n\nHe was a little, man, stoutly built and meanly dressed. He had a fat,\ngood-humoured face and a slight moustache, and eyes that seemed laughing\nall the time.\n\nDespite the coldness of the night, he wore no waistcoat, and as a\nprotest against the conventions he had dispensed with a collar. As he\nstood there, belted about his large waist, a billycock hat on the back\nof his head, he looked to be anything from a broken-down publican to an\nout-of-work plumber.\n\nHe certainly did not bear the impress of gun-man.\n\nIf he was out of his element, he was certainly not out of conceit with\nhimself. He gave a cheery little nod to every face that was turned to\nhim, and stood, his hands thrust through his belt, his legs wide apart,\nsurveying the company with a benevolent smile.\n\n\"Good evening, ladies and gents,\" he said. \"Shake hands with Cherry Bim!\nBim on my father's side and Cherry by christening--Cherry Bim, named\nafter the angels.\" And he beamed again.\n\nThis little speech, delivered in English, was unintelligible to the\nmajority of those present, including Sophia Kensky, but Yakoff\ntranslated it. Solemnly he made a circuit of the company and as solemnly\nshook hands with every individual, and at last he came to Boolba; and\nonly then did he hesitate for a second.\n\nPerhaps in that meeting there came to him some premonition of the\nfuture, some half-revealed, half-blurred picture of prophecy. Perhaps\nthat picture was one of himself, lying in the darkness on the roof of\nthe railway carriage, and an obscene Boolba standing erect in a\nmotor-car on the darkened station, waving his rage, ere the three quick\nshots rang out.\n\nCherry Bim confessed afterwards to a curious shivery sensation at his\nspine. The hesitation was only for a second, and then his hand gripped\nthe big hand of the self-constituted chairman.\n\n\"Now, gents and ladies,\" he said, with a comical little bow towards\nSophia, \"I understand you're all good sports here, and I'm telling you\nthat I don't want to stay long. I'm down and out, and I'm free to\nconfess it, and any of you ladies and gents who would like to grubstake\na stranger in a foreign land, why, here's your chance. I'm open to take\non any kind of job that doesn't bring me into conspicuous relationship\nwith the bulls--bulls, ladies and gentlemen, being New York for\npolicemen.\"\n\nThen Boolba spoke, and he spoke in English, slow but correct.\n\n\"Comrade,\" he said, \"do you hate tyrants?\"\n\n\"If he's a copper,\" replied Mr. Bim mistakenly. \"Why, he's just as\npopular with me as a hollow tooth at an ice-cream party.\"\n\n\"What does he say?\" asked the bewildered Boolba, who could not follow\nthe easy flow of Mr. Bim's conversation, and Yakoff translated to the\nbest of his ability.\n\nAnd then Boolba, arresting the interruption of the American, explained.\nIt was a long explanation. It dealt with tyranny and oppression and\nother blessed words dear to the heart of the revolutionary; it concerned\nmillions of men and hundreds of millions of men and women in chains,\nunder iron heels, and the like; and Mr. Bim grew more and more hazy, for\nhe was not used to the parabole, the allegory, or the metaphor. But\ntowards the end of his address, Boolba became more explicit, and, as his\nemotions were moved, his English a little more broken.\n\nMr. Bim became grave, for there was no mistaking the task which had been\nset him.\n\n\"Hold hard, mister,\" he said. \"Let's get this thing right. There's a guy\nyou want to croak. Do I get you right?\"\n\nAgain Mr. Yakoff translated the idioms, for Yakoff had not lived on the\nedge of New York's underworld without acquiring some knowledge of its\nlanguage.\n\nBoolba nodded.\n\n\"We desire him killed,\" he said. \"He is a tyrant, an oppressor----\"\n\n\"Hold hard,\" said Bim. \"I want to see this thing plain. You're going to\ncroak this guy, and I'm the man to do it? Do I get you?\"\n\n\"That is what I desire,\" said Boolba, and Bim shook his head.\n\n\"It can't be done,\" he said. \"I'm over here for a quiet, peaceful life,\nand anyway, I've got nothing on this fellow. I'm not over here to get my\npicture in the papers. It's a new land to me--why, if you put me in\nPiccadilly Circus I shouldn't know which way to turn to get out of it!\nAnyway, that strong arm stuff is out so far as I'm concerned.\"\n\n\"What does he say?\" said Boolba again, and again Yakoff translated.\n\n\"I thought you were what you call a gun-man,\" said Boolba with a curl of\nhis lip. \"I did not expect you to be frightened.\"\n\n\"There's gun-men and gun-men,\" said Cherry Bim, unperturbed by the\npatent sarcasm. \"And then there's me. I never drew a gun on a man in my\nlife that didn't ask for it, or in the way of business. No, sirree. You\ncan't hire Cherry Bim to do a low, vulgar murder.\"\n\nHis tone was uncompromising and definite. Boolba realized that he could\nnot pursue his argument with any profit to himself, and that if he were\nto bring this unwilling agent to his way of thinking a new line would\nhave to be taken.\n\n\"You will not be asked to take a risk for nothing,\" he said. \"I am\nauthorized to pay you twenty thousand roubles, that is, two thousand\npounds in your money----\"\n\n\"Not mine,\" interrupted Bim. \"It's ten thousand dollars you're trying to\nsay. Well, even that doesn't tempt me. It's not my game, anyway,\" he\nsaid, pulling up a chair and sitting down in the most friendly manner.\n\"And don't think you're being original when you offer me this\ncommission. I've had it offered me before in New York City, and I've\nalways turned it down, though I know my way to safety blindfolded.\nThat's all there is to it, gentlemen--and ladies,\" he added.\n\n\"So you refuse?\" Neither Boolba's voice nor his manner was pleasant.\n\n\"That's about the size of it,\" said Cherry Bim, rising. \"I'm a grafter,\nI admit it. There ain't hardly anything I wouldn't do from smashing a\nbank downwards, to turn a dishonest penny. But, gents, I'm short of the\nnecessary nerve, inclination, lack of morals, and general ungodliness,\nto take on murder in the first, second, or third degree.\"\n\n\"You have courage, my friend,\" said Boolba significantly. \"You do not\nsuppose we should take you into our confidence and let you go away\nagain so easily?\"\n\nMr. Bim's smile became broader.\n\n\"Gents, I won't deceive you,\" he said. \"I expected a rough house and\nprepared for it. Watch me!\"\n\nHe extended one of his hands in the manner of a conjurer and with the\nother pulled up the sleeve above the wrist. He turned the hands over,\nwaggling the fingers as though he were giving a performance, and they\nwatched him curiously.\n\n\"There's nothing there, is there?\" said Cherry Bim, beaming at the\ncompany, \"and yet there is something there. Look!\"\n\nNo eyes were sharp enough to follow the quick movement of his hand. None\nsaw it drop or rise again. There was a slur of movement, and then, in\nthe hand which had been empty, was a long-barrelled Colt. Cherry Bim,\ntaking no notice of the sensation he created, tossed the revolver to the\nceiling and caught it again.\n\n\"Now, gents, I don't know whether you're foolish or only just crazy. Get\naway from that door, Hector,\" he said to a long-haired man who stood\nwith folded arms against the closed door. And \"Hector,\" whose name was\nNickolo Novoski Yasserdernski in real life, made haste to obey.\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" said the careful gun-man. \"That's a key in your waistcoat\npocket, I guess.\" He thrust the barrel of his revolver against the\nother's side, and the long-haired man doubled up with a gasp. But Cherry\nBim meant no mischief. The barrel of the gun clicked against the end of\na key, and when Cherry Bim drew his revolver away the key was hanging to\nit!\n\n\"Magnetic,\" the gun-man kindly explained; \"it is a whim of mine.\"\n\nWith no other words he passed through the door and slammed it behind\nhim.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE GRAND DUCHESS IRENE\n\n\nIsrael Kensky was dozing before the fire when the sound of the creaking\nstair woke him. He walked softly to the door and listened, and presently\nhe heard the steps of his daughter passing along the corridor. He opened\nthe door suddenly and stepped out, and she jumped back with a little cry\nof alarm. There were moments when she was terribly afraid of her father,\nand such a moment came to her now.\n\n\"Are you not asleep, Israel Kensky?\" she faltered.\n\n\"I could not sleep,\" replied the other, in so mild a tone that she took\ncourage. \"Come into my room. I wish to speak to you.\"\n\nHe did not ask her where she had been, or to explain why, at three\no'clock in the morning, she was dressed for the street, and she felt it\nnecessary to offer some explanation.\n\n\"You wonder why I am dressed?\" she said.\n\n\"I heard a great noise in the street, and went out to see----\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\" said Israel Kensky. \"Save your breath, little\ndaughter. Why should you not walk in the street if you desire?\"\n\nHe switched on the light to augment the red glow which came from the\nfire.\n\n\"Sit down, Sophia,\" he said, \"I have been waiting for you. I heard you\ngo out.\"\n\nShe made no reply. There was fear in her eyes, and all the time she was\nconscious of many unpleasant interviews with her father--interviews\nwhich had taken place in Kieff and in other towns--the details of which\nshe could never recall. And she was filled with a dread of some\nhappening to which she could not give form or description. He saw her\nshifting in her chair and smiled slowly.\n\n\"Get me the little box which is on my dressing-table, Sophia Kensky,\" he\nsaid.\n\nHe was seated by the fire, his hands outstretched to the red coal. After\na moment's hesitation she got up, went to the dressing-table, and\nbrought back a small box. It was heavy and made of some metal over which\na brilliant black enamel had been laid.\n\n\"Open the box, Sophia Kensky,\" said the old man, not turning his head.\n\nShe had a dim recollection that she had been asked to do this before,\nbut again could not remember when or in what circumstances. She opened\nthe lid and looked within. On a bed of black velvet was a tiny convex\nmirror, about the size of a sixpence. She looked at this, and was still\nlooking at it when she walked slowly back to her chair and sat down. It\nhad such a fascination, this little mirror, that she could not tear her\neyes away.\n\n\"Close your eyes,\" said Kensky in a monotonous voice, and she obeyed.\n\"You cannot open them,\" said the old man, and she shook her head and\nrepeated:\n\n\"I cannot open them.\"\n\n\"Now you shall tell me, Sophia Kensky, where you went this night.\"\n\nIn halting tones she told him of her meeting with Yakoff, of their walk,\nof the cab, of the little door in the back street, and the stone stairs\nthat led to the whitewashed passage; and then she gave, as near as she\nknew, a full account of all that had taken place. Only when she came to\ndescribe Bim and to tell of what he said, did she flounder. Bim had\nspoken in a foreign language, and the translation of Yakoff had conveyed\nvery little to her. But in this part of the narrative the old man was\nless interested. Again and again he returned to Boolba and the plot.\n\n\"What hand will kill the Grand Duke?\" he asked, not once but many\ntimes, and invariably she answered:\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"On whose behalf does Boolba act?\" asked the old man. \"Think, Sophia\nKensky! Who will give this foreigner twenty thousand roubles?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" she answered again.\n\nPresently a note of distress was evident in her voice, and Israel Kensky\nrose up and took the box from her hand.\n\n\"You will go to bed, Sophia Kensky,\" he said slowly and deliberately,\n\"and to-morrow morning, when you wake, you shall not remember anything\nthat happened after you came into this house to-night. You shall not\nremember that I spoke to you or that I asked you to look in the little\nbox. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, Israel Kensky,\" she replied slowly, and walked with weary feet\nfrom the room.\n\nIsrael Kensky listened and heard her door click, then closed his own,\nand, sitting at a table, began to write quickly. He was still writing\nwhen the grey dawn showed in his windows at six o'clock. He blotted the\nlast letter and addressed an envelope to \"The Most Excellent and\nIllustrious Highness the Grand Duchess Irene Yaroslav\" before, without\ntroubling to undress, he sank down upon his bed into a sleep of\nexhaustion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMalcolm Hay had an appointment with Mr. Tremayne on the morning that saw\nIsrael Kensky engaged in frantic letter-writing. It was about Kensky\nthat Tremayne spoke.\n\n\"He has arrived in London,\" he said, \"and is staying in Colbury Terrace,\nMaida Vale. I think you had better see him, because, as I told you, he\nis a local big-wig and may be very useful to you. Our wells, as you\nknow, are about thirty miles outside Kieff, which is the nearest big\ntown, so you may be seeing him pretty often. Also, by the way, he is our\nagent. If you have any trouble with Government officials you must see\nKensky, who can generally put things square.\"\n\n\"I believe his daughter is with him,\" Mr. Tremayne went on, \"but I know\nvery little about her. Yet another neighbour of yours arrives by special\ntrain at midday.\"\n\n\"Another neighbour of mine?\" repeated Malcolm with a smile. \"And who is\nthat?\"\n\n\"The Grand Duke Yaroslav. I don't suppose you'll have very much to do\nwith him, but he's the King Pippin in your part of the world.\"\n\nA clerk came in with a typewritten sheet covered with Russian\ncharacters.\n\n\"Here's your letter of introduction to Kensky. He knows just as much\nEnglish as you will want him to know.\"\n\nWhen Malcolm presented himself at the lodgings, it was to discover that\nthe old Jew had gone out, and had left no message as to the time he\nwould return. Since Malcolm was anxious to meet this important\npersonage, he did not leave his letter, but went into the City to lunch\nwith an old college chum. In the afternoon he decided to make his call,\nand only remembered, as he was walking up the Strand, that he had\nintended satisfying his curiosity as to that \"other neighbour\" of his,\nthe Grand Duke Yaroslav.\n\nThere was a little crowd about Charing Cross Station, though it was\nnearly two hours after midday when the Yaroslavs were due; and he was to\ndiscover, on inquiry of a policeman, that the cause of this public\ncuriosity had been the arrival of two royal carriages.\n\n\"Some Russian prince or other,\" said the obliging bobby. \"The boat was\nlate, and--here they come!\"\n\nMalcolm was standing on the side-walk in the courtyard of Charing Cross\nStation when the two open landaus drove out through the archway. In the\nfirst was a man a little over middle age, wearing a Russian uniform; but\nMalcolm had no eyes for him--it was for the girl who sat by his side,\nerect, haughty, almost disdainful, with her splendid beauty, and\napparently oblivious to all that was being said to her by the smiling\nyoung man who sat on the opposite seat.\n\nAs the carriage came abreast and the postilions reined in their mounts\nbefore turning into the crowded Strand, the girl turned her head for a\nsecond and her eyes seemed to rest on Malcolm.\n\nInstinctively he lifted his hat from his head, but it was not the girl\nwho returned his salutation, but the stiff figure of the elderly man at\nher side who raised his hand with an automatic gesture. Only for a\nsecond, and then she swept out of view, and Malcolm heaved a long, deep\nsigh.\n\n\"Some dame!\" said a voice at his side. \"Well, I'm glad I saw him,\nanyway.\"\n\nMalcolm looked down at the speaker. He was a stout little man, who wore\nhis hard felt hat at a rakish angle. The butt of a fat cigar was\nclenched between his teeth, and his genial eyes met Malcolm's with an\ninviting frankness which was irresistible.\n\n\"That was his Grand Nibs, wasn't it?\" asked the man, and Malcolm smiled.\n\n\"That was the Grand Duke, I think,\" he said.\n\n\"And who was the dame?\"\n\n\"The dame?\"\n\n\"I mean the lady, the young peacherino--gee! She was wonderful!\"\n\nMalcolm shared his enthusiasm but was not prepared to express himself\nwith such vigour.\n\n\"That girl,\" said his companion, speaking with evident sincerity, \"is\nwasted--what a face for a beauty chorus!\"\n\nMalcolm laughed. He was not a very approachable man, but there was\nsomething about this stranger which broke down all barriers.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad I've seen him,\" said Mr. Cherry Bim again emphatically.\n\"I wonder what he's done.\"\n\nMalcolm turned to move off, and the little man followed his example.\n\n\"What do you mean--what has he done?\" asked the amused Malcolm.\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" said the other airily, \"but I just wondered, that's all.\"\n\n\"I'm glad I've seen them too,\" said Malcolm; \"I nearly missed them. I\nwas sitting so long over lunch----\"\n\n\"You're a lucky man,\" said Mr. Bim.\n\n\"To have seen them?\"\n\n\"No, to have sat over lunch,\" said Cherry with an inward groan. \"My! I'd\nlike to see what a lunch looks like.\"\n\nMalcolm looked at the man with a new interest and a new sympathy.\n\n\"Broke?\" he asked, and the other grinned.\n\n\"If I was only broke,\" he said, \"there'd be no trouble. But what's the\nmatter with me is that there ain't any pieces!\"\n\nCherry Bim noticed the hesitation in Malcolm's face and said:\n\n\"I hope you're not worrying about hurting my feelings.\"\n\n\"How?\" said the startled Malcolm.\n\n\"Why,\" drawled the other, \"if it's among your mind that you'd like to\nslip me two dollars and you're afraid of me throwing it at you, why, you\ncan get that out of your mind straightaway.\"\n\nMalcolm laughed and handed half a sovereign to the man.\n\n\"Go and get something to eat,\" he said.\n\n\"Hold hard,\" said the other as Malcolm was turning away. \"What is your\nname?\"\n\n\"Does that matter?\" asked the young man with amusement.\n\n\"It matters a lot to me,\" said the other seriously. \"I like to pay back\nanything I borrow.\"\n\n\"Hay is my name--Malcolm Hay. It's no use giving you my address, because\nI shall be in Russia next week.\"\n\n\"In Russia, eh? That's rum!\" Cherry Bim scratched his unshaven chin.\n\"I'm always meeting Russians.\"\n\nHe looked at the young engineer thoughtfully, then, with a little jerk\nof his head and a \"So long!\" he turned and disappeared into the crowd.\n\nMalcolm looked at his watch. He would try Kensky again, he thought; but\nagain his mission was fruitless. He might have given up his search for\nthis will-o'-the-wisp but for the fact that his new employers seemed to\nattach considerable importance to his making acquaintance with this\nnotability of Kieff. He could hardly be out after dinner--he would try\nagain.\n\nHe had dressed for the solitary meal, thinking that, if his quest again\nfailed, he could spend the evening at a theatre. This time the elderly\nlandlady of the house in which Mr. Kensky lodged informed him that her\nguest was at home; and a few moments later Malcolm was ushered into the\npresence of the old man.\n\nIsrael Kensky eyed his visitor keenly, taking him in from his carefully\ntied dress-bow to the tips of his polished boots. It was an approving\nglance, for Kensky, though he lived in one of the backwaters of\ncivilization; though his attitude to the privileged classes of the\nworld--in which category he placed Malcolm, did that young man but know\nit--was deferential and even servile; had very definite views as to what\nwas, and was not, appropriate in his superior's attire.\n\nHe read through the letter which Malcolm had brought without a word,\nand then:\n\n\"Pray sit down, Mr. Hay,\" he said in English. \"I have been expecting\nyou. I had a letter from Mr. Tremayne.\"\n\nMalcolm seated himself near the rough bench at which he cast curious\neyes. The paraphernalia of Kensky's hobby still lay upon its surface.\n\n\"You are wondering what an old Jew does to amuse himself, eh?\" chuckled\nKensky. \"Do you think we in South Russia do nothing but make bombs? If I\nhad not an aptitude for business,\" he said (he pronounced the word\n\"pizziness,\" and it was one of the few mispronunciations he made), \"I\nshould have been a bookbinder.\"\n\n\"It is beautiful work,\" said Malcolm, who knew something of the art.\n\n\"It takes my mind from things,\" said Kensky, \"and also it helps me--yes,\nit helps me very much.\"\n\nMalcolm did not ask him in what manner his craft might assist a\nmillionaire merchant, for in those days he had not heard of the \"Book of\nAll-Power.\"\n\nThe conversation which followed travelled through awkward stages and\nmore awkward pauses. Kensky looked a dozen times at the clock, and on\nthe second occasion Malcolm, feeling uncomfortable, rose to go, but was\neagerly invited to seat himself again.\n\n\"You are going to Russia?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is a strange country if you do not know it. And the Russians are\nstrange people. And to Kieff also! That is most important.\"\n\nMalcolm did not inquire where the importance lay, and dismissed this as\nan oblique piece of politeness on the other's part.\n\n\"I am afraid I am detaining you, Mr. Kensky. I merely came in to make\nyour acquaintance and shake hands with you,\" he said, rising, after yet\nanother anxious glance at the clock on the part of his host.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" protested Kensky. \"You must forgive me, Mr. Hay, if I seem\nto be dreaming and I do not entertain you. I am turning over in my mind\nso many possibilities, so many plans, and I think I have come to the\nright conclusion. You shall stay, and you shall know. I can rely upon\nyour discretion, can I not?\"\n\n\"Certainly, but----\"\n\n\"I know I can!\" said the old man, nodding \"And you can help me. I am a\nstranger in London. Tell me, Mr. Hay, do you know the Caf\u00e9 of the Silver\nLion?\"\n\nThe other was staggered by the question.\n\n\"No, I can't say that I do,\" he admitted. \"I am a comparative stranger\nin London myself.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you can find it. You know all the reference books, which are so\nmuch Greek to me; you could discover it by inquiring of the\npolice--inquiries made very discreetly, you understand, Mr. Hay?\"\n\nMalcolm wondered what he was driving at, but the old man changed the\nsubject abruptly.\n\n\"To-night you will see a lady here. She is coming to me. Again I ask for\nyour discretion and your silence. Wait!\"\n\nHe shuffled to the window, pulled aside the blind and looked out.\n\n\"She is here,\" he said in a whisper. \"You will stand just there.\"\n\nHe indicated a position which to Malcolm was ludicrously suggestive of\nhis standing in a corner. Further explanations could neither be given\nnor asked for. The door opened suddenly and a girl came in, closing it\nbehind her. She looked first at Kensky with a smile, and then at the\nstranger, and the smile faded from her lips. As for Malcolm, he was\nspeechless. There was no doubt at all as to the identity. The straight\nnose, the glorious eyes, the full, parted lips.\n\nKensky shuffled across to her, bent down and kissed her hand.\n\n\"Highness,\" he said humbly, \"this gentleman is a friend of mine. Trust\nold Israel Kensky, Highness!\"\n\n\"I trust you, Israel Kensky,\" she replied in Russian, and with the\nsweetest smile that Malcolm had ever seen in a woman.\n\nShe bowed slightly to the young man, and for the rest of the interview\nher eyes and speech were for the Jew. He brought a chair forward for\nher, dusted it carefully, and she sat down by the table, leaning her\nchin on her palm, and looking at the old man.\n\n\"I could not come before,\" she said. \"It was so difficult to get away.\"\n\n\"Your Highness received my letter?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"But Israel,\" her voice almost pleaded, \"you do not believe that this\nthing would happen?\"\n\n\"Highness, all things are possible,\" said the old man. \"Here in London\nthe cellars and garrets teem with evil men.\"\n\n\"But the police----\" she began.\n\n\"The police cannot shelter you, Highness, as they do in our Russia.\"\n\n\"I must warn the Grand Duke,\" she said thoughtfully, \"and\"--she\nhesitated, and a shadow passed over her face--\"and the Prince. Is it not\nhim they hate?\"\n\nKensky shook his head.\n\n\"Lady,\" he said humbly, \"in my letter I told you there was something\nwhich could not be put on paper, and that I will tell you now. And if I\nspeak of very high matters, your Highness must forgive an old man.\"\n\nShe nodded, and again her laugh twinkled in her eyes.\n\n\"Your father, the Grand Duke Yaroslav,\" he said, \"has one child, who is\nyour Highness.\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"The heir to the Grand Dukedom is----\" He stopped inquiringly.\n\n\"The heir?\" she said slowly. \"Why, it is Prince Serganoff. He is with\nus.\"\n\nMalcolm remembered the olive-faced young man who had sat on the seat of\nthe royal carriage facing the girl; and instinctively he knew that this\nwas Prince Serganoff, though in what relationship he stood to the Grand\nDucal pair he had no means of knowing.\n\n\"The heir is Prince Serganoff,\" said the old man slowly, \"and his\nHighness is an ambitious man. Many things can happen in our Russia,\nlittle lady. If the Grand Duke were killed----\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" She sprang to her feet. \"He would never dare! He would\nnever dare!\"\n\nKensky spread out his expressive hands.\n\n\"Who knows?\" he said. \"Men and women are the slaves of their ambition.\"\n\nShe looked at him intently.\n\n\"He would never dare,\" she said slowly. \"No, no, I cannot believe that.\"\n\nThe old man made no reply.\n\n\"Where did you learn this, Israel Kensky?\" she asked.\n\n\"From a good source, Highness,\" he replied evasively, and she nodded.\n\n\"I know you would not tell me this unless there were some foundation,\"\nshe said. \"And your friend?\" She looked inquiringly at the silent Hay.\n\"Does he know?\"\n\nIsrael Kensky shook his head.\n\n\"I would wish that the _gospodar_ knew as much as possible, because he\nwill be in Kieff, and who knows what will happen in Kieff? Besides, he\nknows London.\"\n\nMalcolm did not attempt to deny the knowledge, partly because, in spite\nof his protest, he had a fairly useful working knowledge of the\nmetropolis.\n\n\"I shall ask the _gospodar_ to discover the meeting-place of the\nrabble.\"\n\n\"Do you suggest,\" she demanded, \"that Prince Serganoff is behind this\nconspiracy, that he is the person who inspired this idea of\nassassination?\"\n\nAgain the old man spread out his hands.\n\n\"The world is a very wicked place,\" he said.\n\n\"And the Prince has many enemies,\" she added with a bright smile. \"You\nmust know that, Israel Kensky. My cousin is Chief of the Political\nPolice in St. Petersburg, and it is certain that people will speak\nagainst him.\"\n\nThe old man was eyeing her thoughtfully.\n\n\"Your Highness has much wisdom,\" he said, \"and I remember, when you were\na little girl, how you used to point out to me the bad men from the\ngood. Tell me, lady, is Prince Serganoff a good man or a bad man? Is he\ncapable or incapable of such a crime?\"\n\nShe did not answer. In truth she could not answer; for all that Kensky\nhad said, she had thought. She rose to her feet.\n\n\"I must go now, Israel Kensky,\" she said. \"My car is waiting for me. I\nwill write to you.\"\n\nShe would have gone alone, but Malcolm Hay, with amazing courage,\nstepped forward.\n\n\"If Your Imperial Highness will accept my escort to your car,\" he said\nhumbly, \"I shall be honoured.\"\n\nShe looked at him in doubt.\n\n\"I think I would rather go alone.\"\n\n\"Let the young man go with you, Highness,\" said Kensky earnestly. \"I\nshall feel safer in my mind.\"\n\nShe nodded, and led the way down the stairs. They turned out of the\ngarden into the street and did not speak a word. Presently the girl said\nin English:\n\n\"You must think we Russian people are barbarians, Mr.----\"\n\n\"Hay,\" suggested Malcolm.\n\n\"Mr. Hay. That is Scottish, isn't it? Tell me, do you think we are\nuncivilized?\"\n\n\"No, Your Highness,\" stammered Malcolm. \"How can I think that?\"\n\nThey walked on until they came in sight of the tail lights of the car,\nand then she stopped.\n\n\"You must not come any farther,\" she said. \"You can stand here and watch\nme go. Do you know any more than Israel Kensky told?\" she asked, a\nlittle anxiously.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he replied in truth.\n\nShe offered her hand, and he bent over it.\n\n\"Good night, Mr. Hay. Do not forget, I must see you in Kieff.\"\n\nHe watched the red lights of the car disappear and walked quickly back\nto old Kensky's rooms. Russia and his appointment had a new fascination.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE PRINCE WHO PLANNED\n\n\nFew people knew or know how powerful a man Prince Serganoff really was\nin these bad old days. He waved his hand and thousands of men and women\ndisappeared. He beckoned and he had a thousand sycophantic suppliants.\n\nIn the days before he became Chief of the Police to the entourage, he\nwent upon a diplomatic mission to High Macedonia, the dark and sinister\nstate. He was sent by none, but he had a reason, for Dimitrius, his\nsometime friend, had fled to the capital of the higher Balkan state and\nSerganoff went down without authority to terrify his sometime confidant\ninto returning for trial. In High Macedonia the exquisite young man was\nled by sheer curiosity to make certain inquiries into the domestic\nadministration of the country, and learnt things.\n\nHe had hardly made himself master of these before he was sent for by the\nForeign Minister.\n\n\"Highness,\" said the suave man, stroking his long, brown beard, \"how\nlong have you been in the capital?\"\n\n\"Some four days, Excellency,\" said the Prince.\n\n\"That is ninety-six hours too long,\" said the minister. \"There is a\ntrain for the north in forty minutes. You will catch that, and God be\nwith you!\"\n\nPrince Serganoff did not argue but went out from the ornate office, and\nthe Minister called a man who was waiting.\n\n\"If his Highness does not leave by the four o'clock train, cut his\nthroat and carry the body to one of the common houses of the\ntown--preferably that of the man Domopolo, the Greek, who is a bad\ncharacter, and well deserving of death.\"\n\n\"Excellency,\" said the man gravely, and saluted his way out.\n\nThey knew Serganoff in High Macedonia and were a little anxious. Had\nthey known him better they would have feared him less. He did not leave\nby the four o'clock train, but by a special which was across the\nfrontier by four. He sat in a cold sweat till the frontier post was\npast.\n\nThis man was a mass of contradictions. He liked the good things of life.\nHe bought his hosiery in Paris, his shoes in Vienna, his suits and\ncravats in New York; and it is said of him that he made a special\npilgrimage to London--the Mecca of those who love good leather\nwork--for the characteristic attach\u00e9 cases which were so indispensable\nto the Chief of Gendarmerie of the Marsh Town.\n\nHe carried with him the irrepressible trimness and buoyancy of youth,\nwith his smooth, sallow face, his neat black moustache and his\nshapeliness of outline. An exquisite of exquisites, he had never felt\nthe draughts of life or experienced its rude buffetings.\n\nHis perfectly-appointed flat in the Morskaya had been modelled to his\ntaste and fancy. It was a suite wherein you pressed buttons and\ncomfortable things happened. You opened windows and boiled water, or\nsummoned a valet to your bedside by the gentle pressure you applied to a\nmother-of-pearl stud set in silver plate which, by some miracle, was\nalways within reach.\n\nHe had an entire suite converted to bath-rooms, where his masseur, his\nmanicurist and his barber attended him daily. He had conscripted modern\nscience to his service, he had so cunningly disguised its application,\nthat you might never guess the motive power of the old English clock\nwhich ticked in the spacious hall, or realize that the soft light which\ncame from the many branched candelabra which hung from the centre of his\ndrawing-room was due to anything more up to date than the hundred most\nlife-like candles which filled the sockets.\n\nYet this suave gentleman with his elegant manners and his pretty taste\nin old china, this genius who was the finest judge in the capital of\nPekinese dogs, and had been known to give a thousand-rouble fee to the\nveterinary surgeon who performed a minor operation on his favourite\nBorzoi, had another aspect. He who shivered at the first chill winds of\nwinter and wrapped himself in sables whenever he drove abroad after the\nlast days of September, and had sent men and women to the bleakness of\nAlexandrowski without a qualm; he who had to fortify himself to face an\nAmerican dentist (his fees for missed appointments would have kept the\naverage middle-class family in comfort for a year), was ruthless in his\ndealings with the half-crazed men and women who strayed across the\nfrontier which divided conviction from propaganda.\n\nPhysical human suffering left him unmoved--he hanged the murderer\nPalatoff with his own hands. Yet in that operation someone saw him turn\nvery pale and shrink back from his victim. Afterwards the reason was\ndiscovered. The condemned man had had the front of his rough shirt\nfastened with a safety-pin which had worked loose. The point had ripped\na little gash in the inexperienced finger of the amateur hangman.\n\nHe brought Dr. Von Krauss from Berlin, because von Krauss was an\nauthority upon blood infection and spent a week of intense mental agony\nuntil he was pronounced out of danger.\n\nHe sat before a long mirror in his bedroom, that gave on Horridge's\nHotel, and surveyed himself thoughtfully. He was looking at the only man\nhe trusted, for it was not vanity, but a love of agreeable company that\nexplained the passion for mirrors which was the jest of St. Petersburg.\n\nIt was his fourth day in London and a little table near the window was\ncovered with patterns of cloth; he had spent an exciting afternoon with\nthe representative of his tailor. But it was not of sartorial\nmagnificence that he was thinking.\n\nHe stretched out his legs comfortably towards his reflection, and\nsmiled.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, as though answering some secret thought, and he and the\nreflection nodded to one another as though they had reached a complete\nunderstanding.\n\nPresently he pushed the bell and his valet appeared.\n\n\"Has the Grand Duke gone?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, Excellency,\" replied the man.\n\n\"And the Grand Duchess?\"\n\n\"Yes, Excellency.\"\n\n\"Good!\" Serganoff nodded.\n\n\"Is your Excellency's headache better?\" asked the man.\n\n\"Much better,\" replied the Chief of Police. \"Go to their Highness's\nsuite, and tell their servant--what is the man's name?\"\n\n\"Boolba, Excellency,\" said the valet.\n\n\"Yes, that is the fellow. Ask him to come to me. The Grand Duke\nmentioned a matter which I forgot to tell Boolba.\"\n\nBoolba made his appearance, a suave domestic, wearing the inconspicuous\nlivery of an English butler rather than the ornate uniform which\naccompanied his office in Kieff.\n\n\"That will do.\" Serganoff dismissed his valet. \"Boolba, come here.\"\n\nThe man approached him and Serganoff lowered his voice.\n\n\"You have made a fool of me again, Boolba.\"\n\n\"Excellency,\" pleaded the man urgently, \"I have done all that was\npossible.\"\n\n\"You have placed my fortune and my life in the hands of an American\ncriminal. If that is your idea of doing all that is possible, I agree\nwith you,\" said Serganoff. \"Be careful, Boolba! The arm of the Bureau is\na very long one, and greater men than you have disappeared from their\nhomes.\"\n\n\"Illustrious Excellency,\" said the agitated man, \"I swear to you I did\nall that you requested. There were many reasons why I should not entrust\nthis matter to the men of the secret society.\"\n\n\"I should like to hear a few,\" said Serganoff, cleaning his nails\ndelicately.\n\n\"Excellency, the Grand Duke stands well with the society. He had never\noppressed them, and he is the only popular member of the Imperial House\nwith our--their society.\"\n\n\"Our society, eh?\" said Serganoff, noticing the slip. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Besides, Excellency,\" said Boolba, \"it was necessary not only to kill\nthe Grand Duke, but to shoot down his assassin. Our plan was to get this\nAmerican to shoot him in the park, where he walks in the morning, and\nthen for one of the society to shoot the American. That was a good plan,\nbecause it meant that the man who could talk would talk no more, and\nthat the comrade who shot down the murderer would stand well with the\nGovernment.\"\n\nSerganoff nodded.\n\n\"And your plan has failed,\" he said, \"failed miserably at the outset.\nYou dog!\"\n\nHe leapt to his feet, his eyes blazing, and Boolba stepped back.\n\n\"Highness, wait, wait!\" he cried. \"I have something else in my mind! I\ncould have helped Highness better if I had known more. But I could only\nguess. I had to grope in the dark all the time.\"\n\n\"Do you imagine I am going to take you into my confidence?\" asked\nSerganoff. \"What manner of fool am I? Tell me what you have guessed. You\nmay sit down; nobody will come in, and if they do you can be buttoning\nmy boots.\"\n\nBoolba wiped his damp face with a handkerchief and leaned nearer to the\nman.\n\n\"If the Grand Duke dies, a certain illustrious person succeeds to his\nestates,\" he said, \"but not to his title.\"\n\nSerganoff looked at him sharply. The man had put into words the one\ndifficulty which had occupied the mind of the Chief of Police for\nmonths.\n\n\"Well?\" he said.\n\n\"The title is in the gift of the Czar,\" said Boolba. \"He alone can\ncreate a Grand Duke who succeeds but is not in the direct line.\nTherefore, the killing of Yaroslav would bring little but the property\nto the illustrious person. Only if His Imperial Majesty decided upon a\nworthier holder, or if the Grand Duke fell under a cloud at Court, could\nit pass to the illustrious person.\"\n\n\"That I know,\" said Serganoff. \"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, Highness, would it not be better if the Grand Duke were\ndisgraced, if he were brought to St. Petersburg to answer certain\ncharges which the illustrious person formulated? After, the Grand Duke\nmight die--that is a simple matter. Russia would think that he had been\nput to death by the Court party as a matter of policy. Yaroslav is not\nin favour at the Court,\" he added significantly; but Serganoff shook his\nhead.\n\n\"He is not sufficiently out of favour yet,\" he said. \"Go on, man, you\nhave something in your mind.\"\n\nBoolba edged closer.\n\n\"Suppose the Grand Duke or the Grand Duchess were involved in some\nconspiracy against the Imperial House?\" he said, speaking rapidly.\n\"Suppose, on evidence which could not be disputed, such as the evidence\nof the London police, it was proved that either the Grand Duke or his\ndaughter was in league with an anarchist society, or was attending their\nmeetings--does your Excellency see?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Serganoff, \"but they do not attend meetings.\"\n\nBoolba hesitated.\n\n\"Yet,\" he said, speaking slowly, \"I would guarantee that I could bring\nthe Grand Duchess Irene to such a meeting, and that I could arrange for\nthe place to be raided whilst she was there.\"\n\nSerganoff put down his orange stick and eyed the other keenly.\n\n\"You have brains, Boolba,\" he said. \"Some day I shall bring you to St.\nPetersburg and place you on my staff--if you do not know too much.\"\n\nHe paced the apartment, his hands clasped behind his back.\n\n\"Suppose you get in touch with this American again, bring him to the\nmeeting, unless he's afraid to come, and then boldly suggest to him that\nhe goes to St. Petersburg to make an attempt upon the life of the Czar\nhimself.\"\n\n\"He would reject it,\" said Boolba, shaking his head.\n\n\"What if he did--that doesn't matter,\" said Serganoff impatiently. \"It\nis sufficient that the suggestion is made. Suppose this man is amongst\nthese infamous fellows when the London police raid and arrest them, and\nhe makes a statement that he was approached to destroy the Imperial\nlife, and the Grand Duchess Irene is arrested at the same time?\"\n\nBoolba's eyes brightened.\n\n\"That is a wonderful idea, Highness,\" he said admiringly.\n\nSerganoff continued his pacing, and presently stopped.\n\n\"I will arrange the police raid,\" he said. \"I am in communication with\nScotland Yard, and it will be better if I am present when the raid is\nconducted. It is necessary that I should identify myself with this\nchapter,\" he said, \"but how will you induce the Grand Duchess to come?\"\n\n\"Leave that to me, Highness,\" replied the man, and gave some details of\nhis scheme.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE RAID ON THE SILVER LION\n\n\nSophia Kensky was a loyal and faithful adherent to the cause she had\nespoused, and her report, written in the weird caligraphy of Russia,\ngreatly interested the butler of the Grand Duke Yaroslav. From that\nreport he learned of the visit which the Grand Duchess Irene had paid;\nlearned, too, that she had been escorted to her car by an Englishman,\nwhose name the woman did not know; and was to discover later that the\nsaid \"Englishman\" had been sent out by Israel Kensky on a special\nmission. That mission was to discover the Silver Lion, a no very\ndifficult task. In point of fact, it was discoverable in a London\ntelephone directory, because the upper part of the premises were used\nlegitimately enough in the proprietor's business as restaurateur.\n\nMalcolm Hay had lunch at the place and saw nothing suspicious in its\ncharacter. Most of the client\u00e8le were obviously foreign, and not a few\nwere Russian. Pretending to lose his way, he wandered through the\nservice door, and there made the important discovery that the kitchen\nwas on the top floor, and also that meals were being served somewhere in\nthe basement. This he saw during the few minutes he was allowed to make\nobservations, because there was a service lift which was sent down to\nthe unseen clients below.\n\nHe apologized for his intrusion and went out. Officially there was no\nbasement-room, nor, from the restaurant itself, any sign of stairs which\nled down to an underground chamber. He made a further reconnaissance,\nand found the back door which Sophia Kensky had described in her\nhypnotic sleep, and the location of which the old man had endeavoured to\nconvey to his agent.\n\nMalcolm Hay was gifted with many of the qualities which make up the\nequipment of a good detective. In addition, he had the education and\ntraining of an engineer. That the underground room existed, he knew by\ncertain structural evidence, and waited about in the street until he saw\nthree men come out and the door close behind them. After awhile, another\ntwo emerged. There was nothing sinister or romantic about the existence\nof a basement dining-room, or even of a basement club-room.\n\nThe character of this club was probably well known to the police, he\nthought, and pursued his inquiries to Marlborough Street police station.\nThere he found, as he had expected, that the club was registered and\nknown as \"The Foreign Friends of Freedom Club.\" The officer who supplied\nhim with the information told him that the premises were visited at\nfrequent intervals by a representative of the police, and that nothing\nof an irregular character had been reported.\n\n\"Have you any complaints to make?\" asked the official.\n\n\"None whatever,\" smiled Hay. \"Only I am writing an article on the\nforeign clubs of London, and I want to be sure of my facts.\"\n\nIt was the first and most plausible lie that occurred to him, and it\nanswered his purpose. He returned to Kensky with his information, and\nthe old man producing a map of London, he marked the spot with a red\ncross. All this time Malcolm Hay was busy making preparations for\ndeparture. He would have been glad to stay on, so that his leaving\nLondon would coincide with the departure of the Grand Duchess, but his\nsleeper had already been booked, and he had to make a call _en route_ at\nVienna.\n\nIt was on the occasion of this visit with details of the location and\ncharacter of the club, that he first saw Sophia Kensky. He thought her\npretty in a bold, heavy way, and she regarded him with insolent\nindifference. It was one of the few occasions in his life that he spoke\nwith her.\n\n\"The _gospodar_ is going to Kieff, Sophia Kensky,\" introduced the old\nman.\n\n\"What will you do in Kieff, Excellency?\" asked the woman indolently.\n\n\"I shall not be in Kieff,\" smiled Hay, \"except on rare occasions. I am\ntaking charge of some oil-wells about twenty versts outside of the\ntown.\"\n\n\"It is a terrible life, living in the country,\" she said, and he was\ninclined to agree.\n\nThis and a few trite sentiments about Russian weather and Russian\nseasons were the only words he ever exchanged with her in his life.\nYears later, when he stood, hardly daring to breathe, in the cupboard of\na commissary's office, and heard her wild denunciation of the man who\nhad sent her to death, he was to recall this first and only meeting.\n\nIsrael Kensky dismissed his daughter without ceremony, and it was then\nthat Malcolm Hay told him the result of his investigations. The old man\nsat for a long time stroking his beard.\n\n\"Two more days they stay in this town,\" he said, half to himself, \"and\nthat is the dangerous time.\"\n\nHe looked up sharply at Hay.\n\n\"You are clever, and you are English,\" he said. \"Would you not help an\nold man to save this young life from misery and sorrow?\"\n\nMalcolm Hay looked at him in astonishment.\n\n\"To save whom?\" he asked.\n\n\"The Grand Duchess,\" replied Kensky moodily. \"It is for her I fear, more\nthan for her father.\"\n\nMalcolm Hay was on the point of blurting out the very vital truth that\nthere was nothing in the wide world he would not do to save that\nwonderful being from the slightest ache or pain, but thought it best to\ndissemble the craziest of infatuations that ever a penniless and obscure\nengineer felt for a daughter of the Imperial House of Russia. Instead he\nmurmured some conventional expression of his willingness.\n\n\"It is in this club that the danger lies,\" said Kensky. \"I know these\nsocieties, Mr. Hay, and I fear them most when they look most innocent.\"\n\n\"Could you not get the police to watch?\" asked Malcolm.\n\nHad he lived in Russia, or had he had the experience which was his in\nthe following twelve months, he would not have asked so absurd a\nquestion.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Kensky, \"this is not a matter for the police. It is a\nmatter for those who love her.\"\n\n\"What can I do?\" asked Malcolm hastily.\n\nHe had a horrible feeling that his secret had been surprised, for he was\nof the age when love is fearless of everything except ridicule.\n\n\"You could watch the club,\" said Kensky. \"I myself would go, but I am\ntoo old, and this English weather makes me sick.\"\n\n\"You mean actually watch it?\" said Malcolm in surprise. \"Why, I'll do\nthat like a shot!\"\n\n\"Note who goes in and who come out,\" said Kensky. \"Be on hand at all\ntimes, in case you are called upon for help. You will see my daughter\nthere,\" he said, after a pause, and a faint smile curved his pale lips.\n\"Yes, Sophia Kensky is a great conspirator!\"\n\n\"Whom do you expect me to see?\" asked the other bluntly.\n\nKensky got up from his chair and went to a leather bag which stood on\nthe sideboard. This he unlocked, and from a mass of papers took a\nphotograph. He brought it back to the young man.\n\n\"Why,\" said Malcolm in surprise, \"that is the man Serganoff, the Prince\nfellow!\"\n\nKensky nodded slowly.\n\n\"That is Serganoff,\" he said. \"Here is another picture of him, but not\nof his face.\"\n\nIt was, in fact, a snapshot photograph showing the back of the Police\nChief; and it might have been, thought Malcolm, of a tailor's dummy,\nwith its wasp waist and its perfectly creased trousers.\n\n\"Particularly I wish to know whether he will visit the club in the next\ntwo days,\" said the old man. \"It is important that you should look for\nhim.\"\n\n\"Anybody else?\"\n\nKensky hesitated.\n\n\"I hope not,\" he said. \"I hope not!\"\n\nMalcolm Hay went back to his hotel, feeling a new zest in life. His\nexperience of the past few days had been incredible. He, an unknown\nstudent, had found himself suddenly plunged into the heart of an\nanarchist plot, and on nodding terms with royal highnesses! He laughed\nsoftly as he sat on the edge of his bed and reviewed all the\ncircumstances, but did not laugh when the thought occurred to him that\nthe danger which might be threatening this girl was very real.\n\nThat side of the adventure sobered him. He had sense enough to see that\nit was the unalienable right of youth to believe in fairies and to love\nbeautiful princesses, and that such passions were entitled to disturb\nthe rest and obscure the judgment of their victims for days and even for\nweeks. But he had an unpleasant conviction that he was looking at the\nGrand Duchess from an angle which was outside his experience of fairy\nstories.\n\nThat night when he went on his way to take up his \"police duty\" in the\nlittle street behind the Silver Lion, he saw two mounted policemen\ntrotting briskly down the Strand followed by a closed carriage, and in\nthe light of the electric standard he caught a glimpse of a face which\nset his heart beating faster. He cursed himself for his folly, swore so\nvigorously and so violently at his own stupidity, that he did not\nrealize he was talking aloud, until the open-mouthed indignation of an\nelderly lady brought him to a sense of decorum.\n\nShe was going to the theatre, of course, he thought, and wondered what\ntheatre would be graced by her presence. He half regretted his promise\nto Israel Kensky, which prevented him discovering the house of\nentertainment and securing a box or a stall from whence he could feast\nhis eyes upon her face.\n\nHis vigil was painfully monotonous. It was the most uninteresting job he\nhad ever undertaken. Most of the habitu\u00e9s of the club had evidently come\nat an early hour, for he saw nobody come in and nobody go out until\nnearly eleven o'clock. It began to rain a fine, thin drizzle, which\npenetrated every crevice, which insinuated itself down his neck, though\nhis collar was upturned; and then, on top of this, came a gusty easterly\nwind, which chilled him to the marrow. Keeping in the shadow of the\nhouses opposite, he maintained, however, a careful scrutiny, thereby\nearning the suspicion of a policeman, who passed him twice on his beat\nbefore he stopped to ask if he were looking for somebody.\n\nAs midnight chimed from a neighbouring church the door of the club\nopened and its members came out. Malcolm crossed the road and walked\ndown to meet them, since they all seemed to be coming in the same\ndirection.\n\nThere were about twenty men, and they were speaking in Russian or\nYiddish, but the subjects of their discourse were of the most innocent\ncharacter. He saw nobody he knew, or had ever seen before. Israel Kensky\nhad expected that the St. Petersburg Chief of Police would be present;\nthat expectation was not realized. Then he heard the door bolted and\nchained, and went home, after the most unprofitable evening he had ever\nspent.\n\nHow much better it would have been to sit in the warm theatre, with,\nperhaps, a clear view of the girl, watching her every movement, seeing\nher smile, noting her little tricks of manner or gesture.\n\nIn the end he laughed himself into a sane condition of mind, ate a\nhearty supper, and went to bed to dream that Serganoff was pursuing him\nwith a hammer in his hand, and that the Grand Duchess was sitting in a\nbox wildly applauding the efforts of her homicidal relative.\n\nThe next afternoon Malcolm Hay was packing, with the remainder of his\nbelongings, a few articles he had purchased in London. Amongst these was\na small and serviceable Colt revolver, and he stood balancing this in\nthe palm of his hand, uncertain as to whether it would not be better to\nretain his weapon until after his present adventure. Twice he put it\ninto his portmanteau and twice took it out again, and finally, blushing\nat the act, he slipped the weapon into his hip-pocket.\n\nHe felt theatrical and cheap in doing so. He told himself that he was\ninvesting a very common-place measure of precaution taken by old Israel\nKensky, who was probably in the secret police, to protect his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e,\nwith an importance and a romance which it did not deserve. He went down\nto his post that night, feeling horribly self-conscious. This time he\nkept on the same side of the street as that on which the club was\nsituated.\n\nHis watch was rewarded by events of greater interest than had occurred\non the previous night. He had not been on duty half an hour before two\nmen walked rapidly from the end of the street and passed him so closely\nthat he could not make any mistake as to the identity of one. Had he not\nbeen able to recognize him, his voice would have instantly betrayed his\nidentity, for, as they passed, the shorter of the two was talking.\n\n\"I'm one of those guys who don't believe in starving to death in a\ndelicatessen store----\"\n\nMalcolm looked after the pair in amazement. It was the little man whom\nhe had befriended in the courtyard at Charing Cross station. Other\npeople drifted through the door in ones and twos, and then a man came\nwalking smartly across the street, betraying the soldier at every\nstride. Malcolm turned and strolled in his direction.\n\nThere was no mistaking him either, though he was muffled up to the chin.\nWith his tight-waisted greatcoat, a glimpse of an olive face with two\npiercing dark eyes, which flashed an inquiring glance as they\npassed--there was no excuse for error. It was Colonel Prince Serganoff\nbeyond a doubt.\n\nA quarter of an hour later came the real shock of the evening. A girl\nwas almost on top of him before he saw her, for she was wearing shoes\nwhich made no sound. He had only time to turn so that she did not see\nhis face, before she too entered the door and passed in. The Grand\nDuchess! And Serganoff! And the American adventurer!\n\nWhat had these three in common, he wondered. And now he recalled the\nwarning of the old man. Perhaps the girl was in danger--the thought\nbrought him to the door, with his hand raised and touching the bell-push\nbefore he realized his folly. There was nothing to do but wait.\n\nFive minutes passed and ten minutes, and then Malcolm Hay became\nconscious of the fact that something unusual was happening in the\nstreet. It was more thickly populated. Half a dozen men had appeared at\neither end of the street and were moving slowly towards him, as\nthough----\n\nAnd then in a flash he realized just what was happening. It was a police\nraid. In his student days he had seen such a raid upon a gambling house,\nand he recognized all the signs. He first thought of the girl--she must\nnot be involved in this. He raced toward the door, but somebody had ran\nquicker, and his hand was on the bell-push when he was swung violently\nbackwards, and an authoritative voice said:\n\n\"Take that man, sergeant.\"\n\nA hand gripped his shoulder and somebody peered in his face.\n\n\"Why, he's English,\" he said in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" gasped Malcolm. \"I'm sorry to interfere, but there is a lady\nin there, in whom I'm rather interested--you're raiding this club,\naren't you?\"\n\n\"That's about the size of it,\" said a man in civilian clothes; and then,\nsuspiciously, \"Who are you?\"\n\nMalcolm explained his status and calling.\n\n\"Take my advice and get away. Don't be mixed up in this business,\" said\nthe officer. \"You can release him, sergeant. What's the time?\"\n\nA clock struck at that moment, and the officer in charge of the raid\npressed the bell.\n\n\"If you've a lady friend involved in this, perhaps you'd like to stand\nby,\" he said. \"She may want you to bail her out,\" he added\ngood-humouredly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nPRINCE SERGANOFF PAYS THE PRICE\n\n\nMr. Cherry Bim, a citizen of the world, and an adventurer at large, was\nan optimist to his finger-tips. He also held certain races in profound\ncontempt, not because he knew the countries, but because he had met\nrepresentatives of those nations in America, and judged by their\ncharacteristics.\n\nSo that the man called Yakoff, whose task it was to inveigle Mr. Bim\nagain to the premises of the Friends of Freedom Club, found to his\nastonishment that Mr. Bim required very little inveigling. The truth\nwas, of course, that the gun-man had a supreme contempt for all\nRussians, whom he had classified mistakenly as \"Lithanians\" and\n\"Pollaks.\" To the fervent promise made by Mr. Yakoff that no harm would\ncome to him, Cherry Bim had replied briefly but unprintably.\n\n\"Of course, there'll be no harm come to me,\" he said scornfully. \"You\ndon't think I worry about what that bunch will do? No, sir! But I'm\npowerfully disinclined to associate myself with people out of my class.\nIt doesn't do a man any good to be seen round with Pollaks and Letts.\"\n\nYakoff earnestly implored him to come and give the benefit of his\nexperience to the assembly, and had promised him substantial payment.\nThis latter argument was one which Cherry Bim could understand and\nappreciate. He accepted on the spot, and came down to the stuffy little\nunderground room, expecting no more than to be asked to deliver a\nlecture on the gentle art of assassination. Not that he knew very much\nabout it, because Cherry, with three or four men to his credit, had shot\nthem in fair fight; but a hundred pounds was a lot of money, and he\nbadly needed just enough to shake the mud of England from his shoes and\nseek a land more prolific in possibilities.\n\nThe first thing he noticed on arrival was that Boolba, the man who had\ninterrogated him before, was not present. In his place sat a smaller\nman, with a straggly black beard and a white face, who was addressed as\n\"Nicholas.\"\n\nThe second curious circumstance which struck him was that he was\nreceived also in an ominous silence.\n\nThe black-bearded man, who spoke in perfect English, indicated a chair\nto the left of him.\n\n\"Sit down, comrade,\" he said. \"We have asked you to come because we\nhave another proposition to make to you.\"\n\n\"If it's a croaking proposition, you needn't go any farther,\" said\nCherry, \"and I won't trouble you with my presence, gents, and----\" he\nlooked in vain for the woman he had seen before, and added, that he\nmight round off his sentence gracefully--\"fellow murderers.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bim,\" said Nicholas in his curious singsong tone, \"does it not make\nyour blood boil to see tyranny in high places----\"\n\n\"Now, can that stuff!\" said Cherry Bim. \"Nothing makes my blood boil, or\nwould make my blood boil, except sitting on a stove, I guess. Tyranny\ndon't mean any more in my young life than Hennessy, and tyrants more\nthan hydrants. I guess I was brought up in a land of freedom and glory,\nwhere the only tyrant you ever meet is a traffic cop. If this is another\ncroaking job, why, gents, I won't trouble you any longer.\"\n\nHe half-rose, but Nicholas pushed him down.\n\n\"Not even if it was the Czar?\" he said calmly.\n\nCherry Bim gaped at him.\n\n\"The Czar?\" he said, with a queer little grimace to emphasize his\ndisbelief in the evidence of his hearing. \"What are you getting at?\"\n\n\"Would you shoot the Czar for two thousand pounds?\" asked Nicholas.\n\nCherry Bim pushed his hat to the back of his head and got up, shaking\noff the protesting arm.\n\n\"I'm through,\" he said, \"and that's all there is to it.\"\n\nIt was at that moment that Serganoff came through the door and Cherry\nBim remained where he stood, surprised to silence, for the face of the\nnewcomer was covered from chin to forehead by a black silk mask.\n\nThe door was shut behind him; he walked slowly to the table and dropped\ninto a broken chair, Cherry's eyes never leaving his face.\n\n\"For fifteen years,\" said the gun-man, speaking slowly, \"I've been a\ncrook, but never once have I seen a guy got up like that villain in a\nmovie picture. Say, mister, let's have a look at your face.\"\n\nCherry Bim was not the only person perturbed by the arrival of a masked\nstranger. Only three men in the room were in the secret of the\nnewcomer's identity, and suspicious and scowling faces were turned upon\nhim.\n\n\"You will excuse me,\" said the mask, \"but there are many reasons why you\nshould not see me or know me again.\"\n\n\"And there's a mighty lot of reasons why you shouldn't know me again,\"\nsaid Cherry, \"yet I've obliged you with a close-up of my distinguished\nfeatures.\"\n\n\"You have heard the proposition,\" said the man. \"What do you think of\nit?\"\n\n\"I think it's a fool proposition,\" replied Cherry contemptuously. \"I've\ntold these lads before that I am not falling for the Lucretia Borgia\nstuff, and I'm telling you the same.\"\n\nThe masked man chuckled.\n\n\"Well, don't let us quarrel,\" he said. \"Nicholas, give him the money we\npromised.\"\n\nNicholas put his hand in his pocket and brought out a roll of notes,\nwhich he tossed to the man on his left, and Cherry Bim, to whom tainted\nmoney was as acceptable as tainted pheasant to the epicure, pocketed it\nwith a smack of his lips.\n\n\"Now, if there's anything I can do for you boys,\" he said, \"here's your\nchance to make use of me. Though I say it myself, there ain't a man in\nNew York with my experience, tact and finesse. Show me a job that can be\ndone single-handed, with a dividend at the end of it, and I'll show you\na man who can take it on. In the meantime,\" said he affably, \"the drinks\nare on me. Call the waiter, and order the best in the house.\"\n\nSerganoff held up his hand.\n\n\"Wait,\" he said; \"was that the door?\"\n\nNicholas nodded, and the whole room stood in silence and watched the\ndoor slowly open. There was a gasp of astonishment, of genuine\nsurprise, for Irene Yaroslav was well known to them, and it was Irene\nYaroslav who stood with her back to the door. She wore a long black\ncloak of sable and by her coiffure it was evident that she was wearing\nan evening toilette beneath the cloak.\n\n\"Where is Israel Kensky?\" she asked.\n\nShe did not immediately see the man in the masked face, for he sat under\na light and his broad-brimmed hat threw his face into shadow.\n\nNobody answered her, and she asked again:\n\n\"Where is Israel Kensky?\"\n\n\"He is not here,\" said Serganoff coolly, as she took two paces and\nstopped dead, clasping her hands before her.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" she asked. \"What are you doing here, Ser----\"\n\n\"Stop!\" His voice was almost a shout, and yet there was a shake in it.\n\nSerganoff realized the danger of his own position, if amongst these men\nwere some who had cause to hate him.\n\n\"Do not mention my name, Irene.\"\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" she asked. \"And where is Israel Kensky?\"\n\n\"He has not come,\" Serganoff's voice was uneven and his hands shook.\n\nShe turned to go, but he was before her and stood with his back to the\nentrance.\n\n\"You will wait,\" he said.\n\n\"What insolence is this?\" she demanded haughtily. \"I had a letter from\nIsrael Kensky telling me to come here under his protection and I should\nlearn the truth of the plot against my father.\"\n\nSerganoff had recovered something of his self-possession and laughed\nsoftly.\n\n\"It was I who sent you that letter, Irene. I sent it because I\nparticularly desired you here at this moment.\"\n\n\"You shall pay for this,\" she said, and tried to force her way past him,\nbut his strong hands gripped her and pushed her back.\n\nShe turned with a flaming face upon the men.\n\n\"Are you men,\" she asked, \"that you allow this villain, who betrayed my\nfather and will betray you, to treat a woman so.\"\n\nShe spoke in Russian, and nobody moved. Then a voice said:\n\n\"Speak English, miss.\"\n\nShe turned and glanced gratefully at the stout little man with his\ngrotesque Derby hat and his good-humoured smile.\n\n\"I have been brought here by a trick,\" she said breathlessly, \"by this\nman\"--she pointed to Serganoff. \"Will you help me leave? You're English,\naren't you?\"\n\n\"American, miss,\" said Cherry Bim. \"And as for helping you, why, bless\nyou, you can class me as your own little bodyguard.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Serganoff hoarsely, and instinctively, at the sight of the\nlevelled revolver. Cherry's hands went up. \"You'll keep out of this and\ndo not interfere,\" said Serganoff. \"You'll have all the trouble you want\nbefore this evening is through. Irene, come here.\"\n\nAt one side of the room was a narrow doorway, which most of the members\nbelieved led to a cupboard, but which a few knew was a safety bolt in\ncase of trouble. The Prince had recognized the door by its description,\nand had edged his way towards it, taking the key from his pocket.\n\nHe gripped the girl by the waist, inserted the key and flung open the\ndoor. She struggled to escape, but the hand that held the key also held\nthe revolver, and never once did it point anywhere but at Cherry Bim's\nanatomy.\n\n\"Help!\" cried the girl. \"This man is Serganoff, the Chief of Police at\nPetrograd----\"\n\nThere was a crash, and the sound of hurrying footsteps. A voice from the\nouter hall screamed, \"The police!\"\n\nAt that moment Serganoff dragged the girl through the doorway and\nslammed it behind him. They were in a small cellar, almost entirely\nfilled with barrels, with only a narrow alley-way left to reach a\nfarther door. He dragged her through this apartment, up a short flight\nof stairs. They were on the level of the restaurant, and the girl could\nhear the clatter of plates as he pushed her up another stairway and into\na room. By its furniture she guessed it was a private dining-room. The\nblinds were drawn and she had no means of knowing whether the apartment\noverlooked the front or the back of the premises.\n\nHe stopped long enough to lock the door and then he turned to her,\nslipping off his mask.\n\n\"I thought you would recognize me,\" he said coolly.\n\n\"What does this outrage mean?\" asked the girl with heaving bosom. \"You\nshall pay for this, colonel.\"\n\n\"There will be a lot of payment to be made before this matter is\nthrough,\" he said calmly. \"Calm yourself, Irene. I have saved you from a\ngreat disgrace. Are you aware that, at the moment I brought you from\nthat room, the English police were raiding it?\"\n\n\"I should not have been in the room but for you,\" she said, \"my\nfather----\"\n\n\"It is about your father I want to speak,\" he said. \"Irene, I am the\nsole heir to your father's estate. Beyond the property which is settled\non you, you have nothing. My affection for you is known and approved at\nCourt.\"\n\n\"Your affection!\" she laughed bitterly. \"I'd as soon have the affection\nof a wolf!\"\n\n\"You could not have a more complete wolf than I,\" he said meaningly. \"Do\nyou know what has happened to-night? An anarchist club in London has\nbeen raided, and the Grand Duchess Irene Yaroslav has been found in the\ncompany of men whose object is to destroy the monarchy.\"\n\nShe realized with a sickening sense of disaster all that it meant. She\nknew as well as he in what bad odour her father stood at Court, and\nguessed the steps which would be taken if this matter became public.\n\n\"I was brought here by a trick,\" she said steadily. \"A letter came to\nme, as I thought, from Israel Kensky----\"\n\n\"It was from me,\" he interrupted.\n\n\"And you planned the raid, of course?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"I planned the raid in the most promising circumstances,\" he said. \"The\ngentleman who offered to be your good knight is a well-known New York\ngun-man. He is wanted by the police, who probably have him in their\ncustody at this moment. He was brought here to-night, and an offer was\nmade to him, an offer of a large sum of money, on condition that he\nwould destroy the Czar.\"\n\nShe gasped.\n\n\"You see, my little Irene, that when this gun-man's evidence is taken in\ncourt, matters will look very bad for the Yaroslav family.\"\n\n\"What do you propose?\" she asked.\n\n\"There are two alternatives,\" he said. \"The first is that I should\narrest you and hand you over to the police. The second is that you\nshould undertake most solemnly to marry me, in which case I will take\nyou away from here.\"\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"Is there a third possibility?\" she asked, and he shook his head.\n\n\"My dear,\" he said familiarly as he flicked a speck of dust from his\nsleeve. \"I think you will take the easier way. None of these scum will\nbetray you, thinking that you are one of themselves--as I happen to\nknow, some of the best families in Russia are associated with plotters\nof this type. As for the American, who might be inclined to talk, in a\nfew weeks he will be on his way to New York to serve a life sentence. I\nhave been looking up his record, and particularly drew the attention of\nthe English police to the fact that he would be here to-night.\"\n\nCherry Bim, creeping up the stairs in his stockinged feet--he had\nmarked and shot the fuse-box to pieces before the police came in, and\nhad burst his way through the door in the wall--heard the sound of\nvoices in the little room and stopped to listen. It was not a thick\ndoor, and he could hear Serganoff's voice very clearly. He stooped down\nto the key-hole. Serganoff had not taken the key out, and it was an\nold-fashioned key, the end of which projected an eighth of an inch on\nthe other side of the door. Cherry Bim felt in his pocket and produced a\npair of peculiarly shaped nippers, and gripped the end of the key,\nturning it gently. Then he slipped his handy gun from his pocket and\nwaited.\n\n\"Now, Irene,\" said Serganoff's voice. \"You must decide. In a few minutes\nthe police will be up here, for they are instructed to make a complete\nsearch of the house. I can either explain that you are here to witness\nthe raid, or that I have followed you up and arrested you. Which is it\nto be?\"\n\nStill she did not answer. Serganoff had laid his revolver on the table\nand this she was manoeuvring to reach. He divined her intention before\nshe sprang forward, and, gripping her by the waist, threw her back.\n\n\"That will be more useful to me than to you,\" he said.\n\n\"Sure thing it will!\" said a voice behind him.\n\nHe turned as swift as a cat and fired. The horrified girl heard only one\nshot, so quickly did one report follow another. She saw Cherry Bim raise\nhis hand and wipe the blood from his cheek, saw the splinter of wood\nwhere the bullet had struck behind him; then Serganoff groaned and\nsprawled forward over the table. She dared not look at him, but followed\nBim's beckoning finger.\n\n\"Down the stairs and out of that door, miss,\" he said, \"or the bulls\nwill have you.\"\n\nShe did not ask him who the \"bulls\" were; she could guess. She flew down\nthe stairs, with trembling hands unfastened the lock and stepped into\nthe street. It was empty, save for two men, and one of these came\nforward to meet her with outstretched hands.\n\n\"Thank God you're safe!\" he said. \"You weren't there, were you?\"\n\nMalcolm Hay was incoherent. The detective who was with him could but\nsmile a little, for the girl had come out of the door which, according\nto his instructions, led only to the private dining-room.\n\n\"Take me away,\" she whispered.\n\nHe put his arm about her trembling figure, and led her along the street.\nAll the time he was in terror lest the police should call her back, and\ndesire him to identify her; but nothing happened and they gained\nShaftesbury Avenue and a blessed taxicab.\n\n\"To Israel Kensky,\" she said. \"I can't go home like this.\"\n\nHe stretched out of the window and gave fresh instructions.\n\n\"I am greatly obliged to you, Mr. Hay,\" she faltered and then covered\nher face with her hands. \"Oh, it was dreadful, dreadful!\"\n\n\"What happened?\" he asked.\n\nShe shook her head. Then suddenly:\n\n\"No, no, I must go home. Will you tell the cabman? There is a chance\nthat I may get into my suite without Boolba seeing. Will you go on to\nIsrael Kensky after you have left me, and tell him what has happened?\"\n\nHe nodded, and again gave the change of instructions.\n\nThey reached the hotel at a period when most of the guests were either\nlingering over their dinner or had gone to the theatre.\n\n\"I hate leaving you like this,\" he said; \"how do I know that you will\nget in without detection?\"\n\nShe smiled in spite of her distress.\n\n\"You're an inventor, aren't you, Mr. Hay?\" she laughed. \"But I am afraid\neven you could not invent a story which would convince my father if he\nknew I had been to that horrible place.\" Presently she said: \"My room\noverlooks the street. If I get in without detection I will come to the\nwindow and wave a handkerchief.\"\n\nHe waited in a fit of apprehension, until presently he saw a light leap\nup to three windows, and her figure appeared. There was a flutter of a\nwhite handkerchief, and the blinds were drawn. Malcolm Hay drove to\nMaida Vale, feeling that the age of romance was not wholly dead.\n\nTo his surprise Kensky had had the news before he reached there.\n\n\"Is she safe? Is she safe?\" asked the old man tremulously. \"Now, thank\nJehovah for his manifold blessings and mercies! I feared something was\nwrong. Her Highness wrote to me this afternoon, and I did not get the\nletter,\" said Israel. \"They waylaid the messenger, and wrote and told\nher to go to the Silver Lion--the devils!\"\n\nHis hand was shaking as he took up the poker to stir the fire.\n\n\"He, at any rate, will trouble none of us again,\" he said with malignant\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"He? Who?\"\n\n\"Serganoff,\" said the old man. \"He was dead when the police found him!\"\n\n\"And the American?\" asked Hay.\n\n\"Only Russians were arrested,\" said Israel Kensky. \"I do not think I\nshall see him again.\"\n\nIn this he was wrong, though six years were to pass before they met: the\nmystic, Israel Kensky, Cherry Bim the modern knight-errant, and Malcolm\nHay.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nKENSKY OF KIEFF\n\n\nMalcolm Hay drew rein half a verst from the Church of St. Andrea. Though\nhis shaggy little horse showed no signs of distress, Malcolm kicked his\nfeet free from the stirrups and descended, for his journey had been a\nlong one, the day was poisonously hot and the steppe across which he had\nridden, for all its golden beauty, its wealth of blue cornflour and\nyellow genista, had been wearisome. Overhead the sky was an unbroken\nbowl of blue and at its zenith rode a brazen merciless sun.\n\nHe took a leather cigar-case from his pocket, extracted a long black\ncheroot and lit it; then, leaving his horse to its own devices, he\nmounted the bank by the side of the road, from whence he could look\nacross the valley of the Dneiper. That majestic river lay beneath him\nand to the right.\n\nBefore him, at the foot of the long, steep and winding road, lay the\nquarter which is called Podol.\n\nFor the rest his horizon was filled with a jumble of buildings,\nmagnificent or squalid; the half-revealed roofs on the wooded slopes of\nthe four hills, and the ragged fringe of belfry and glittering cupola\nwhich made up the picture of Kieff.\n\nThe month was June and the year of grace 1914, and Malcolm Hay, chief\nengineer of the Ukraine-American Oil Corporation, had no other thought\nin his mind, as he looked upon the undoubted beauty of Kieff, than that\nit would be a very pleasant place to leave. He climbed the broken stone\nwall and stood, his hands thrust deeply into his breeches pockets,\nwatching the scene. It was one of those innumerable holy days which the\nRussian peasant celebrated with such zest. Rather it was the second of\nthree consecutive feast days and, as Malcolm knew, there was small\nchance of any work being done on the field until his labourers had taken\ntheir fill of holiness, and had slept off the colossal drunk which\ninevitably followed this pious exercise.\n\nA young peasant, wearing a sheepskin coat despite the stifling heat of\nthe day, walked quickly up the hill leading a laden donkey. The man\nstopped when he was abreast of Malcolm, took a cigarette from the inside\nof his coat and lit it.\n\n\"God save you, _dudushka_,\" he said cheerfully.\n\nMalcolm was so used to being addressed as \"little grandfather,\" and\nthat for all his obvious youth, that he saw nothing funny in the\naddress.\n\n\"God save you, my little man,\" he replied.\n\nThe new-comer was a broad-faced, pleasant-looking fellow with a ready\ngrin, and black eyebrows that met above his nose. Malcolm Hay knew the\ntype, but to-day being for idleness, he did not dread the man's\nloquacity as he would had it been a working day.\n\n\"My name is Gleb,\" introduced the man: \"I come from the village of\nPotchkoi where my father has seven cows and a bull.\"\n\n\"God give him prosperity and many calves,\" said Malcolm mechanically.\n\n\"Tell me, _gospodar_, do you ride into our holy city to-day?\"\n\n\"Surely,\" said Malcolm.\n\n\"Then you will do well to avoid the Street of Black Mud,\" said Gleb.\n\nMalcolm waited.\n\n\"I speak wisely because of my name,\" said the man with calm assurance;\n\"possibly your excellence has wondered why I should bear the same name\nas the great saint who lies yonder,\" he pointed to one of the towering\nbelfries shimmering with gold that rose above the shoulder of a distant\nhill. \"I am Gleb, the son of Gleb, and it is said that we go back a\nthousand years to the Holy Ones. Also, it was prophesied by a wise\nwoman,\" said the peasant, puffing out a cloud of smoke and crossing\nhimself at the same time, \"that I should go the way of holiness and that\nafter my death my body should be incorruptible.\"\n\n\"All this is very interesting, little brother,\" said Malcolm with a\nsmile, \"but first you must tell me why I should not go into the Street\nof Black Mud.\"\n\nThe man laughed softly.\n\n\"Because of Israel Kensky,\" he said significantly.\n\nYou could not live within a hundred miles of Kieff and not know of\nIsrael Kensky. Malcolm realized with a start that he had not met the old\nman since he left him in London.\n\n\"In what way has Israel Kensky offended?\" asked Malcolm, understanding\nthe menace in the man's tone.\n\nGleb, squatting in the dust, brushed his sheepskin delicately with the\ntips of his fingers.\n\n\"Little father,\" he said, \"all men know Israel Kensky is a Jew and that\nhe practises secret devil-rites, using the blood of Christian children.\nThis is the way of Jews, as your lordship knows. Also he was seen on the\nplains to shoot pigeons, which is a terrible offence, for to shoot a\npigeon is to kill the Holy Ghost.\"\n\nMalcolm knew that the greater offence had not yet been stated and\nwaited.\n\n\"To-day I think they will kill him if the Grand Duke does not send his\nsoldiers to hold the people in check--or the Grand Duchess, his lovely\ndaughter who has spoken for him before, does not speak again.\"\n\n\"But why should they kill Kensky?\" asked Malcolm.\n\nIt was not the first time that Israel Kensky had been the subject of\nhostile demonstrations. The young engineer had heard these stories of\nhorrible rites practised at the expense of Christian children, and had\nheard them so often that he was hardened to the repetition.\n\nThe grin had left the man's face and there was a fanatical light in the\nsolemn eyes when he replied:\n\n\"_Gospodar_, it is known that this man has a book which is called 'The\nBook of All-Power!'\"\n\nMalcolm nodded.\n\n\"So the foolish say,\" he said.\n\n\"It has been seen,\" said the other; \"his own daughter, Sophia Kensky,\nwho has been baptised in the faith of Our Blessed Lord, has told the\nArchbishop of this book. She, herself, has seen it.\"\n\n\"But why should you kill a man because he has a book?\" demanded Malcolm,\nknowing well what the answer would be.\n\n\"Why should we kill him! A thousand reasons, _gospodar_,\" cried the man\npassionately; \"he who has this book understands the black magic of\nKensky and the Jews! By the mysteries in this book he is able to torment\nhis enemies and bring sorrow to the Christians who oppose him. Did not\nthe man Ivan Nickolovitch throw a stone at him, and did not Ivan drop\ndead the next day on his way to mass, aye and turn black before they\ncarried him to the hospital? And did not Mishka Yakov, who spat at him,\nsuffer almost immediately from a great swelling of the throat so that\nshe is not able to speak or swallow to this very day without pain?\"\n\nMalcolm jumped down from the wall and laughed, and it was a helpless\nlittle laugh, the laugh of one who, for four long years, had fought\nagainst the superstitions of the Russian peasantry. He had seen the work\nof his hands brought to naught, and a boring abandoned just short of the\noil because a cross-eyed man, attracted by curiosity, had come and\nlooked at the work. He had seen his wells go up in smoke for some\nimaginary act of witchcraft on the part of his foreman, and, though he\nlaughed, he was in no sense amused.\n\n\"Go with God, little brother,\" he said; \"some day you will have more\nsense and know that men do not practise witchcraft.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am wiser than you,\" said Gleb, getting up and whistling for\nhis donkey, who had strayed up the side lane.\n\nBefore Malcolm could reply there was a clatter of hoofs and two riders\ncame galloping round the bend of the road making for the town. The first\nof these was a girl, and the man who followed behind was evidently the\nservant of an exalted house, for he wore a livery of green and gold.\n\nGleb's ass had come cantering down at his master's whistle and now stood\nbroadside-on in the middle of the road, blocking the way. The girl\npulled up her horse with a jerk and, half-turning her head to her\nattendant, she called. The man rode forward.\n\n\"Get your donkey out of the way, fool,\" he boomed in a deep-chested\nroar.\n\nHe was a big man, broad-shouldered and stout. Like most Russian domestic\nservants, his face was clean-shaven, but Malcolm, watching the scene\nidly, observed only this about him--that he had a crooked nose and that\nhis hair was a fiery red.\n\n\"Gently, gently.\" It was the girl who spoke and she addressed her\nrestive horse in English.\n\nAs for Gleb, the peasant, he stood, his hands clasped before him, his\nhead humbly hung, incapable of movement, and with a laugh Malcolm jumped\ndown from the bank, seized the donkey by his bridle and drew him\nsomewhat reluctantly to the side of the road. The girl's horse had been\ncurveting and prancing nervously, so that it brought her to within a\nfew paces of Malcolm, and he looked up, wondering what rich man's\ndaughter was this who spoke in English to her horse ... only once before\nhad he seen her in the light of day.\n\nThe face was not pale, yet the colour that was in her cheeks so\ndelicately toned with the ivory-white of forehead and neck that she\nlooked pale. The eyes, set wide apart, were so deep a grey that in\ncontrast with the creamy pallor of brow they appeared black.\n\nA firm, red mouth he noticed; thin pencilling of eyebrows, a tangle of\ndark brown hair; but neither sight of her nor sound of her tired\ndrawling voice, gave her such permanence in his mind as the indefinite\nsense of womanliness that clothed her like an aurora.\n\nHe responded wonderfully to some mysterious call she made upon the man\nin him. He felt that his senses played no part in shaping his view. If\nhe had met her in the dark, and had neither seen nor heard; if she had\nbeen a bare-legged peasant girl on her way to the fields; if he had met\nher anywhere, anyhow--she would have been divine.\n\nShe, for her part, saw a tall young man, mahogany faced, leanly made, in\nold shooting-jacket and battered Stetson hat. She saw a good forehead\nand an unruly mop of hair, and beneath two eyes, now awe-stricken by\nher femininity (this she might have guessed) rather than by her exalted\nrank. They were eyes with a capacity for much laughter, she thought, and\nwished Russian men had eyes like those.\n\n\"My horse is afraid of your donkey, I think,\" she smiled.\n\n\"It isn't my donkey,\" he stammered, and she laughed again frankly at his\nembarrassment.\n\nAnd then the unexpected happened. With a frightened neigh her horse\nleapt sideways toward him. He sprang back to avoid the horse's hoofs and\nheard her little exclamation of dismay. In the fraction of a second he\nrealized she was falling and held out his arms to catch her. For a\nmoment she lay on his breast, her soft cheek against his, the\noverpowering fragrance of her presence taking his breath away. Then she\ngently disengaged herself and stepped back. There was colour in her face\nnow and something which might have been mischief, or annoyance, or sheer\namusement, in her eyes.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said.\n\nHer tone was even and did not encourage further advances on his part.\n\n\"I lost my balance. Will you hold my horse's head?\"\n\nShe was back in the saddle and turning, with a proud little inclination\nof her head, was picking a way down the steep hill before he realized\nwhat had happened. He gazed after her, hoping at least that feminine\ncuriosity would induce her to turn and look back, but in this he was\ndisappointed.\n\nThe peasant, Gleb, still stood by the side of the road, his hands\nclasped, his head bent as though in a trance.\n\n\"Wake up, little monkey,\" said Malcolm testily. \"Why did you not hold\nthe horse for the lady whilst I helped her to mount?\"\n\n\"_Dudushka_, it is forbidden, _Zaprestcheno_,\" said the man huskily.\n\"She is _Kaziomne_! The property of the Czar!\"\n\n\"The Czar!\" gasped Malcolm.\n\nHe had lived long enough in Russia to have imbibed some of the awe and\nreverence for that personage.\n\n\"Little master,\" said the man, \"it was her Magnificence, the Grand\nDuchess Irene Yaroslav.\"\n\n\"The Grand----!\" Malcolm gasped. The reality of his dreams and he had\nnot recognized her!\n\nLong after the peasant had departed he stood on the spot where he had\nheld her, like a man in a trance, and he was very thoughtful when he\npicked up the reins of his horse and swung himself into the saddle.\n\nKieff is built upon many hills and it has the beauty and distinction of\npossessing steeper roads than any other city in Europe. He was on his\nway to the Grand Hotel, and this necessitated his passing through Podol,\ncrossing the Hill of the Cliff, and descending into the valley beyond.\n\nConsidering it was a feast day the streets were strangely deserted. He\nmet a few old men and women in festal garb and supposed that the\nmajority of the people were at the shrines in which Kieff abounds. He\npassed through the poorer Jewish quarter, and did not remember the\npeasant's warning not to go into the Street of Black Mud until he had\nturned into that thoroughfare.\n\nLong before he had reached the street he heard the roar of the crowd,\nand knew that some kind of trouble was brewing. The street was filled\nwith knots of men and women, and their faces by common attraction, were\nturned in one direction. The focal point was a densely packed crowd\nwhich swayed toward the gateway of a tall, grim-looking house, which he\nrecognized as the home of the millionaire, Kensky.\n\nThe roar intensified to a continuous shriek of malignant hate. He saw\nsticks and fists brandished and heard above the scream of frenzied women\nthe deep-throated \"Kill! Death to the Jew!\" which was not unfamiliar to\none who knew Kieff in moments of religious excitement. It was no\nbusiness of his, and he drew his horse to the side of the street and\nwatched, wondering what part the black-bearded Russian priests, who were\nin force and who seemed to form the centre of each knot of idlers, were\nplaying in this act of persecution.\n\nOn the outskirts of the crowd he observed a green and gold coat, and,\nits wearer turning his head, he recognized him as the swarthy menial who\nhad ridden behind the Grand Duchess. He was as violent and as energetic\nas the most lawless, and seemed engaged in pushing men into the crowd\nand dragging forward hesitant bystanders to swell the throng which was\npressing about the iron gates of the building.\n\nAnd then Malcolm saw something which brought his heart to his mouth, a\nwhite hand raised from above the bobbing black heads, a hand raised in\nappeal or command. Instinctively he knew its owner and spurred his horse\ninto the throng, sending the people flying in all directions. There was\na small clear space immediately before the door which enabled him to see\nthe two chief actors in the drama long before he was within hailing\ndistance.\n\nThe space was caused by a dead horse, as he afterwards discovered, but,\nfor the moment, his eyes were fixed on the girl who stood with her back\nto the grille, shielding with her frail body a little old man,\nwhite-bearded and bent, who crouched behind her outstretched arms, his\npale face streaming with blood. A broken key in the grille told the\nstory of his foiled attempt to escape. Grimy hands clutched at Malcolm's\nknees as he drove through the press, a stone whistled past his ear and\nshrill voices uttered imprecations at the daring foreigner, but he\nswerved to left and right and made a way until the sight of the dead\nhorse brought his frightened mount to a quivering standstill.\n\nHe leapt from the saddle and sprang to the girl's side, and to his\namazement his appearance seemed to strike consternation into her heart.\n\n\"Why did you come? Get away as quickly as you can,\" she breathed. \"Oh,\nyou were mad to come here!\"\n\n\"But--but you?\" he said.\n\n\"They will not hurt me,\" she said rapidly. \"It is the old man they want.\nCan you smash the lock and get him inside?\"\n\n\"Give us the book, Jew,\" yelled a deep voice above the babel of sound.\n\"Give us the book and you shall live! Lady! Magnificence! Make the old\nman give us the book!\"\n\nMalcolm took a flying kick at the gate and the lock yielded. He half\nlifted, half carried the old man and pushed inside, where another locked\ndoor confronted them.\n\n\"Have you a key?\" demanded Malcolm hurriedly. \"Quick!\"\n\nThe old man felt in his pocket with trembling fingers and in doing so he\ncrept behind his guardian. Malcolm now turned and faced the crowd.\n\n\"Come in, for God's sake,\" he called to the girl, but she shook her\nhead.\n\n\"They will not hurt me,\" she said over her shoulder; \"it is you!\"\n\nAt that moment Malcolm felt something heavy slipped into the loose\npocket of his jacket and a quivering voice, harsh with fear, whispered\nin his ear:\n\n\"Keep it, _gospodar_. To-morrow I will come for it at the Grand Hotel at\nthe middle hour!\"\n\nThe crowd was now surging forward and the girl was being pressed back\ninto the little lobby by their weight. Suddenly the door opened with a\ncrack and the old man slipped through.\n\n\"Come, come,\" he cried.\n\nMalcolm leapt forward, clasped the girl about the waist and swung her\nbehind him.\n\nThe shrieks of the crowd broke and a new note crept into the pandemonium\nof sound, a note of fear. From outside came a clatter of hoofs on the\ncobbled roadway. There was a flash of red and white pennons, the glitter\nof steel lances and a glimpse of bottle-green coats as half a sotnia of\nCossacks swept the street clear.\n\nThey looked at one another, the girl and the man, oblivious to the\nappeal of hand and voice which the old man in the doorway was offering.\n\n\"I think you are very brave,\" said the girl, \"or else very foolish. You\ndo not know our Kieff people.\"\n\n\"I know them very well,\" he said grimly.\n\n\"It was equally foolish of me to interfere,\" she said quickly, \"and I\nought not to blame you. They killed my horse.\"\n\nShe pointed to the dead horse lying before the doorway.\n\n\"Where was your servant?\" he asked, but she made no reply. He repeated\nthe question, thinking she had not heard and being at some loss for any\nother topic of conversation.\n\n\"Let us go out,\" she said, ignoring the query, \"we are safe now.\"\n\nHe was following her when he remembered the packet in his pocket and\nturned to the old man.\n\n\"Here is your----\"\n\n\"No, no, no, keep it,\" whispered Israel Kensky. \"They may come again\nto-night! My daughter told them that I was carrying it. May she roast!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Malcolm curiously.\n\nThe old man's lips parted in a toothless smile.\n\n\"It is the 'Book of All-Power!'\"\n\nHe blinked up at Malcolm, peering into his face expectantly. \"They all\ndesire it, _gospodar_, from the Grand Duke in his beautiful palace to\nthe _moujik_ in his cellar--they all desire my lovely book! I trust you\nwith it for one night, _gospodar_, because you are English. Ah, well,\nyou are not Russian. Guard it closely, for it holds the secret of tears\nand of happiness. You shall learn how to make men and women your slaves\nand how to turn people into Jews, and how to make men and women adore\nyou, ai, ai! There are recipes for beauty in my book which make plain\nwomen lovely and old men young!\"\n\nMalcolm could only stare.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE GRAND DUKE IS AFFABLE\n\n\nThe girl's voice called, and Malcolm left old Kensky without a word and\nwent to her side. \"Will you walk with me to my father's palace?\" she\nsaid. \"I do not think it is safe for you to be alone.\"\n\nA semi-circle of mounted Cossacks surrounded them now, and the\nunfaithful Boolba (such was the servant's name, he learnt) was standing\nwith an impassive face holding his horse's head.\n\n\"One of the soldiers will take your horse,\" she said. \"Boolba, you will\nfollow us.\"\n\nHer voice was stern and she looked the man straight in the eyes, but he\ndid not flinch.\n\n\"_Prikazeno_, Highness, it is ordered,\" he said simply.\n\nShe turned and walked the way she had come, turning into the big square\nfollowed by a small escort of Cossacks.\n\nThey walked in silence for some time, and it was the girl who first\nspoke.\n\n\"What do you think of Russia, Mr. Hay?\" she asked.\n\nHe jerked his head round at her in surprise.\n\n\"You didn't know me on the hill,\" she laughed, \"but I knew you! And\nthere are not so many foreigners in the Kieff region that you should be\nunknown to the Grand Duke,\" she said, \"and besides, you were at the\nreception which my father gave a year ago.\"\n\n\"I did not see your Highness there,\" said Malcolm. \"I came\nespecially----\" he stopped short in confusion.\n\n\"That was probably because I was not visible,\" she replied dryly. \"I\nhave been to Cambridge for a year to finish my education.\"\n\n\"That is why your English is so good,\" he smiled.\n\n\"It's much better than your Russian,\" she said calmly. \"You ought not to\nhave said '_ukhoditzay_' to people--you only say that to beggars, and I\nthink they were rather annoyed with you.\"\n\n\"I should imagine they were,\" he laughed; \"but won't you tell me what\nhappened to your servant? I thought I saw him on the outskirts of the\ncrowd and the impression I formed was----\" he hesitated.\n\n\"I shouldn't form impressions if I were you,\" she said hurriedly. \"Here\nin Russia one ought not to puzzle one's head over such things. When you\nmeet the inexplicable, accept it as such and inquire no further.\"\n\nShe was silent again, and when she spoke she was more serious.\n\n\"The Russian people always impress me as a great sea of lava, boiling\nand spluttering and rolling slowly between frail banks which we have\nbuilt for them,\" said the girl.\n\n\"I often wonder whether those banks will ever break,\" said Malcolm\nquietly; \"if they do----\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"They will burn up Russia,\" said Malcolm.\n\n\"So I think,\" said the girl. \"Father believes that the war----\" she\nstopped short.\n\n\"The war?\"\n\nMalcolm had heard rumours so often of the inevitable war which would be\nfought to establish the hegemony of the Slav over Eastern Europe that\nthe scepticism in his tone was pardonable. She looked at him sharply.\n\n\"You do not think there will be war?\"\n\n\"One has heard so often,\" he began.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" she said, a little impatiently, and changed the\nsubject.\n\nThey talked about the people, the lovable character of the peasants, the\nextraordinary depth of their religious faiths, their amazing\nsuperstitions, and suddenly Malcolm remembered the book in his pocket,\nand was about to speak of it, but stopped himself, feeling that, by so\nspeaking, he was betraying the confidence of the old man who had\nentrusted his treasure to a stranger's care.\n\n\"What is this story of the book of Kensky?\"\n\n\"'The Book of All-Power'?\"\n\nShe did not smile as he had expected her to.\n\n\"Old Israel Kensky is a curious man,\" she said guardedly. \"The people\ncredit him with all sorts of powers which of course he does not possess.\nThey believe he is a wizard, that he can bend people to his will. They\nsay the most terrible things about the religious ceremonies over which\nhe presides.\"\n\nThey were mounting the hill behind which lay the fashionable quarter of\nKieff with its great stone palaces, its wonderful cherry gardens and\nbroad avenues.\n\n\"I like old Kensky,\" she went on; \"he sometimes comes to the palace to\nbring new silks--he is the greatest merchant in Little Russia. He even\ntells me his troubles--he has a terrible daughter: you have heard about\nher?\"\n\n\"I thought she was rather good,\" said Malcolm humorously. \"Isn't she a\nChristian?\"\n\nThe girl shrugged her shoulders. Evidently her Grand Ducal Highness had\nno great opinion of Sophia Kensky's conversion.\n\nThe Grand Ducal palace was built in the Byzantine style and presented,\nfrom the broad carriage drive that led from the road, a confusion of\nroofs, windows and bastions, as though the designer had left the working\nout of his plan to fifty different architects, and each architect had\ninterpreted the scheme of construction in his own way.\n\nThe Grand Duke was standing in the portico as they went through the\ngate, and came down the steps to meet them. He was a mild-looking man of\nmedium height and wore pince-nez. Malcolm remembered that on the one\noccasion he had met his Highness he had been disappointed in his lack of\npersonal grandeur.\n\n\"My child, my child!\" said the Duke, coming to the girl with\noutstretched arms. \"What a terrible misfortune! How came you to be mixed\nup in this matter? The commandant has just telephoned to me. I have\ncalled for his resignation. By St. Inokeste, I will not have the rabble\nbreathing upon you! And this is the good gentleman who came to your\nrescue?\"\n\nHe surveyed Malcolm with his cold blue eyes, but both glance and\nintonation lacked the cordiality which his words implied.\n\n\"I thank you. I am indeed grateful to you. You understand they would not\nhave harmed the Grand Duchess, but this you could not know. As for the\nJew----\"\n\nHe became suddenly thoughtful. He had the air of a man wholly\npreoccupied in his secret thoughts and who now emerged from his shell\nunder the greatest protest. To Malcolm it seemed that he resented even\nthe necessity for communicating his thoughts to his own daughter.\n\n\"I am happy to have been of service to your Grand Ducal Highness,\" said\nMalcolm correctly.\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes,\" interrupted the Grand Duke nervously, \"but you will\nstay and breakfast with me? Come, I insist, Mr.--er--er----\"\n\n\"Mr. Hay, father,\" said the girl.\n\nThe conversation throughout was carried on in English, which was not\nremarkable, remembering that that was the family language of the Court.\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes, Mr. Hay, you must stay to breakfast. You have been very\ngood, very noble, I am sure. Irene, you must persuade this gentleman.\"\nHe held out his hand jerkily and Malcolm took it with a bow.\n\nThen without another word or even so much as a glance at his daughter,\nthe Grand Duke turned and hurried back into the palace, leaving Malcolm\nvery astonished and a little uncomfortable.\n\nThe girl saw his embarrassment.\n\n\"My father does not seem to be very hospitable,\" she smiled, and once\nmore he saw that little gleam of mischief in her eyes, \"but I will give\nyou a warmer invitation.\"\n\nHe spread out his hands in mock dismay and looked down at his untidy\nclothes.\n\n\"Your Highness is very generous,\" he said, \"but how can I come to the\nGrand Duke's table like this?\"\n\n\"You will not see the Grand Duke,\" she laughed; \"father gives these\ninvitations but never accepts them himself! He breakfasts in his own\nroom, so if you can endure me alone----\" she challenged.\n\nHe said nothing but looked much, and her eyes fell before his. All the\ntime he was conscious that red-haired Boolba stood stiffly behind him, a\nspectator, yet, as Malcolm felt, a participant in this small affair of\nthe breakfast invitation. She followed Malcolm's look and beckoned the\nman forward. He had already surrendered the horses to an orderly.\n\n\"Take the lord to a guest-room,\" she said in Russian, \"and send a valet\nto attend to him.\"\n\n\"It is ordered,\" said the man, and with a nod, the girl turned and\nwalked into the house, followed at a more leisurely pace by Malcolm and\nthe man with the crooked nose.\n\nBoolba led the way up a broad flight of stairs, carpeted with thick red\npile, along a corridor pierced at intervals with great windows, to\nanother corridor leading off and through a door which, from its\ndimensions, suggested the entrance to a throne-room, into a suite\ngorgeously furnished and resplendent with silver electroliers. It\nconsisted of a saloon leading into a bedroom, which was furnished in the\nsame exquisite taste. A further door led to a marble-tiled bathroom.\n\n\"Such luxury!\" murmured Malcolm.\n\n\"Has the _gospodar_ any orders?\"\n\nIt was the solemn Boolba who spoke. Malcolm looked at him.\n\n\"Tell me this, Boolba,\" he said, falling into the familiar style of\naddress which experience had taught him was the correct line to follow\nwhen dealing with Russian servants, \"how came it that your mistress was\nalone before the house of Israel Kensky, the Jew, and you were on the\noutskirts of the crowd urging them on?\"\n\nIf the man felt any perturbation at the bluntness of the question he did\nnot show it.\n\n\"Kensky is a Jew,\" he said coolly; \"on the night of the Pentecost he\ntakes the blood of new-born Christian babies and sprinkles his money so\nthat it may be increased in the coming year. This Sophia Kensky, his own\ndaughter, has told me.\"\n\nMalcolm shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"You are no ignorant _moujik_, Boolba,\" he said contemptuously, \"you\nhave travelled with his Highness all over the world.\" (This was a shot\nat a venture, but apparently was not without justification.) \"How can\nyou, an educated man of the people, believe such rubbish?\"\n\n\"He has a book, _gospodar_,\" said Boolba, \"and we people who desire\npower would have that book, for it teaches men how they may command the\nsouls of others, so that when they lift their little fingers, those who\nhate them best shall obey them.\"\n\nMalcolm looked at him in astonishment.\n\n\"Do you believe this?\"\n\nFor the first time a smile crossed the face of the man with the crooked\nnose. It was not a pleasant smile to see, for there was cunning in it\nand a measureless capacity for cruelty.\n\n\"Who knows all the miracles and wonders of the world?\" he said. \"My lord\nknows there is a devil, and has he not his angels on earth? It is best\nto be sure of these things, and we cannot be certain--until we have seen\nthe book which the Jew gave to your lordship.\"\n\nHe paused a little before uttering the last sentence which gave his\nassertion a special significance. Malcolm eyed him narrowly.\n\n\"The Jew did not give me any book, Boolba,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought your lordship----\"\n\n\"You thought wrongly,\" said Malcolm shortly.\n\nBoolba bowed and withdrew.\n\nThe situation was not a particularly pleasant one. Malcolm had in his\npossession a book which men were willing to commit murder to obtain, and\nhe was not at all anxious that his name should be associated with the\npractice of witchcraft.\n\nIt was all ridiculous and absurd, of course, but then in Russia nothing\nwas so absurd that it could be lightly dismissed from consideration. He\nwalked to the door and turned the key, then took from his pocket the\nthing which Israel Kensky had slipped in. It was a thick, stoutly bound\nvolume secured by two brass locks. The binding was of yellow calf, and\nit bore the following inscription in Russian stamped in gold lettering:\n\n\n                     \"THE BOOK OF ALL-POWER.\"\n\n\n\"Herein is the magic of power and the words and symbols which unlock the\nsealed hearts of men and turn their proud wills to water.\"\n\nOn the bottom left-hand corner of the cover was an inscription in\nHebrew, which Malcolm could not read, but which he guessed stood for the\nbirth-name of Israel Kensky. He turned the book over in his hand, and,\ncuriosity overcoming him, he tried to force his thumb-nail into the\nmarbled edge of the leaves that he might secure a glimpse of its\ncontents. But the book was too tightly bound, and after another careful\nexamination, he pulled off his coat and started to make himself\npresentable for breakfast.\n\nThe little meal was wholly delightful. Besides Malcolm and the girl\nthere were present a faded Russian lady, whom he guessed was her\nofficial chaperon, and a sour-visaged Russian priest who ceremoniously\nblessed the food and was apparently the Grand Duke's household chaplain.\nHe did not speak throughout the meal, and seemed to be in a condition of\nrapt contemplation.\n\nBut for all Malcolm knew there might have been a hundred people\npresent--he had eyes and ears only for the girl. She had changed to a\ndark blue costume beneath which was a plain white silk blouse cut deeply\nat the neck.\n\nHe was struck by the fact that she wore no jewels, and he found himself\nrejoicing at the absence of rings in general and of one ring in\nparticular.\n\nOf course, it was all lunacy, sheer clotted madness, as he told himself,\nbut this was a day to riot in illusions, for undreamt-of things had\nhappened, and who could swear that the days of fairies had passed? To\nmeet a dream-Irene on his way to Kieff was unlikely, to rescue her from\nan infuriated mob (for though they insisted that she was in no danger\nhe was no less insistent that he rescued her, since this illusion was\nthe keystone to all others), to be sitting at lunch with such a vision\nof youthful loveliness--all these things were sufficiently outside the\nrange of probabilities to encourage the development of his dream in a\ncomfortable direction.\n\n\"To-night,\" thought he, \"I shall be eating a prosaic dinner at the Grand\nHotel, and the Grand Duchess Irene Yaroslav will be a remote personage\nwhom I shall only see in the picture papers, or possibly over the heads\nof a crowd on her way to the railway station.\"\n\nAnd so he was outrageously familiar. He ceased to \"Highness\" her,\nlaughed at her jokes and in turn provoked her to merriment. The meal\ncame to an end too soon for him, but not too soon for the nodding\ndowager nor the silent, contemplating priest, who had worn through his\nperiod of saintly abstraction and had grown most humanly impatient.\n\nThe girl looked at her watch.\n\n\"Good gracious,\" she said, \"it is four o'clock and I have promised to go\nto tennis.\" (Malcolm loathed tennis from that hour.)\n\nHe took his leave of her with a return to something of the old\nceremonial.\n\n\"Your Grand Ducal Highness has been most gracious,\" he said, but she\narrested his eloquence with a little grimace.\n\n\"Please, remember, Mr. Hay, that I shall be a Grand Ducal Highness for\nquite a long time, so do not spoil a very pleasant afternoon by being\nover-punctilious.\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"Then I will call you----\"\n\nHe came to a dead end, and the moment was embarrassing for both, though\nwhy a Grand Ducal Highness should be embarrassed by a young engineer she\nalone might explain.\n\nHappily there arrived most unexpectedly the Grand Duke himself, and if\nhis appearance was amazing, as it was to judge by the girl's face, his\ngeniality was sensational.\n\nHe crossed the hall and gripped the young man's hand.\n\n\"You're not going, Mr. Hay?\" he asked. \"Come, come, I have been a very\nbad host, but I do not intend to let you go so soon! I have much that I\nwant to talk to you about. You are the engineer in charge of the Ukraine\nOil Field, is it not so? Excellent! Now, I have oil on my estate in the\nUrals but it has never been developed....\"\n\nHe took the young man by the arm and led him through the big doors to\nthe garden, giving him no chance to complete or decently postpone his\nfarewell to the girl, who watched with undisguised amazement this\nstaggering affability on the part of her parent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE HAND AT THE WINDOW\n\n\nAn hour later she came from tennis, to find her father obviously bored\nalmost to the point of tears, yet making an heroic attempt to appear\ninterested in Malcolm's enthusiastic dissertation of the future of the\noil industry. The Grand Duke rose gladly on her appearance, and handed\nhim over.\n\n\"I have persuaded Mr. Hay to dine with us to-night, and I have sent to\nthe hotel for his baggage. He is most entertaining, my little love, most\nentertaining. Persuade him to talk to you about--er--oil and things,\"\nand he hurriedly withdrew.\n\nThe girl sat down on the seat he had vacated.\n\n\"You're a most amazing person, Mr. Hay,\" she smiled.\n\n\"So I have been told,\" said Malcolm, as he filled a glass with tea from\nthe samovar.\n\n\"You have also a good opinion of yourself, it seems,\" she said calmly.\n\n\"Why do you think I am amazing, anyway?\" said he recklessly, returning\nto the relationships they had established at luncheon.\n\n\"Because you have enchanted my father,\" she said.\n\nShe was not smiling now, and a troubled little frown gathered on her\nbrow.\n\n\"Please tell me your magic.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is the book,\" he said jestingly.\n\n\"The book!\" she looked up sharply. \"What book?\"\n\nAnd then, as a light dawned on her, she rose to her feet.\n\n\"You have--you have Israel Kensky's book?\" she whispered in horror.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Here with you?\"\n\n\"Yes, here,\" he slapped his pocket.\n\nShe sat down slowly and reached out her hand, and he thought it shook.\n\n\"I do not know who was the madder--Israel Kensky to give it to you or\nyou to take it,\" she said. \"This is the only house in Kieff where your\nlife is safe, and even here----\" She stopped and shook her head. \"Of\ncourse, you're safe here,\" she smiled, \"but I wish the book were\nsomewhere else.\"\n\nShe made no further reference either to the amazing volume or to her\nfather, and that night, when he came down to dinner, feeling more on\nlevel terms with royalty (though his dress-suit was four years old and\nhis patent shoes, good enough for such mild society functions as came\nhis way, looked horribly cracked and shabby), he dismissed the matter\nfrom his mind. The dinner party was a large one. There were two bishops,\ninnumerable popes, several bejewelled women, an officer or two and the\ninevitable duenna. He was introduced to them all, but remembered only\nColonel Malinkoff, a quiet man whom he was to meet again.\n\nTo his amazement he found that he had been seated in the place of\nhonour, to the right of the Grand Duke, but he derived very little\nsatisfaction from that distinction, since the girl was at the other end\nof the table.\n\nShe looked worried and her conversation, so far as he could hear,\nconsisted of \"yes\" and \"no\" and conventional expressions of agreement\nwith the views of her companions.\n\nBut the duke was loquacious, and at an early stage of the dinner the\nconversation turned on the riot of the morning. There was nothing\nremarkable in the conversation till suddenly the Grand Duke, without\npreliminary, remarked in a matter-of-fact tone:\n\n\"The danger is that Kensky may very well use his evil powers against the\nwelfare of Holy Church.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of agreement from the black-bearded popes, and\nMalcolm opened his eyes in astonishment.\n\n\"But surely your Highness does not believe that this man has any\nsupernatural gift.\"\n\nThe Grand Duke stared at him through his glasses.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"if there are miracles of the Church why should\nthere not be performed miracles by the Powers of Darkness? Here in\nKieff,\" he went on, \"we have no reason to doubt that miracles are\nperformed every day. Who doubts that worship at the shrine of St.\nBarbara in the Church of St. Michael of the Golden Head protects us\nagainst lightning?\"\n\n\"That is undoubtedly the fact, your Imperial Highness,\" said a stout\npope, speaking with his mouth full. \"I have seen houses with lightning\nconductors struck repeatedly, and I have never known any place to be\ntouched by lightning if the master of the house was under the protection\nof St. Barbara.\"\n\n\"And beneath the Church of Exaltation,\" the Grand Duke went on, \"more\nmiracles have been performed than elsewhere in the world.\"\n\nHe peered round the table for contradiction.\n\n\"It was here that the Two Brothers are buried and it was their prayer\nthat they should sleep together in the same grave. One died before the\nother, and when the second had passed away and they carried his body to\nthe tomb, did not the body of the first brother arise to make room? And\nis there not a column in the catacomb to which, if a madman is bound, he\nrecovers his reason? And are there not skulls which exude wonderful oils\nwhich cure men of the most terrible diseases, even though they are on\nthe point of death?\"\n\nMalcolm drew a long breath. He could understand the superstitious\nreverence of the peasant for these relics and miracles, but these were\neducated men. One of them stood near to the throne and was versed in the\nintricacies of European diplomacy. These were no peasants steeped in\nignorance, but intellectuals. He pinched himself to make sure that he\nwas awake as the discussion grew and men swopped miracles in much the\nsame spirit of emulation as store-loafers swop lies. But the\nconversation came back to him, led thereto by the Grand Duke, and once\nmore it centred on that infernal book. The volume in question was not\nsix inches from the Grand Duke, for Malcolm had stuffed it into his tail\npocket before he came down to dinner, and this fact added a certain\npiquancy to the conversation.\n\n\"I do not doubt, your Highness,\" said a stout bishop, who picked his\nteeth throughout the dinner, \"that Kensky's book is identical with a\ncertain volume on devil worship which the blessed Saint Basil publicly\ndenounced and damned. It was a book especially inspired by Satan, and\ncontained exact rules, whereby he who practised the magic could bind in\nearthly and immortal obedience the soul of anybody he chose, thus\ndestroying in this life their chance of happiness and in the life to\ncome their souls' salvation.\"\n\nAll within reach of the bishop's voice crossed themselves three times.\n\n\"It would have been well,\" mused the Grand Duke, \"if the people had\nsucceeded this morning.\"\n\nHe shot a glance at Malcolm, a glance full of suspicious inquiry, but\nthe young man showed no sign either of resentment or agreement. But he\nwas glad when the dinner ended and the chance came to snatch a few words\nwith the girl. The guests were departing early, and kummel and coffee\nwas already being served on a large silver salver by the _buffetschek_,\nwhom Malcolm recognized as the ubiquitous Boolba.\n\n\"I shall not see you again,\" said the girl in a low voice. \"I am going\nto my room. But I want you to promise me something, Mr. Hay.\"\n\n\"The promise is made before you ask,\" said he.\n\n\"I want you to leave as early as you possibly can to-morrow morning for\nyour mine, and if I send you word I want you to leave Russia without\ndelay.\"\n\n\"But this is very astonishing.\"\n\nShe faced him squarely, her hands behind her back.\n\n\"Mr. Hay,\" she said, and her low voice was vibrant with feeling, \"you\nhave entangled yourself in an adventure which cannot possibly end well\nfor you. Whatever happens, you cannot come out with credit and safety,\nand I would rather you came out with credit.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" he said.\n\n\"I will make it plainer,\" said she. \"Unless something happens in the\nnext month or two which will point the minds of the people to other\ndirections, you will be suspect. The fact that you have the book is\nknown.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said.\n\n\"By whom?\" she asked quickly.\n\n\"By Boolba, your servant.\"\n\nShe raised her hand to her lips, as if to suppress a cry. It was an odd\nlittle trick of hers which he had noticed before.\n\n\"Boolba,\" she repeated. \"Of course! That explains!\"\n\nAt that moment the Grand Duke called him. The guests had dwindled away\nto half a dozen.\n\n\"Your coffee, Mr. Hay, and some of our wonderful Russian kummel. You\nwill not find its like in any other part of the world.\"\n\nMalcolm drank the coffee, gulped down the fiery liqueur, and replaced\nthe glass on the tray. He did not see the girl again, and half an hour\nlater he went up to his room, locked the door and undressed himself\nslowly, declining the assistance which had been offered to him by the\ntrained valet.\n\nFrom the open window came the heavy perfume of heliotrope, but it was\nneither the garden scent nor the moderate quantity of wine he had taken,\nnor the languid beauty of the night, which produced this delicious\nsensation of weariness. He undressed and got into his pyjamas, then sat\nat the end of his bed, his head between his hands.\n\nHe had sat for a long time like this, before he realized the strangeness\nof his attitude and getting on to his feet, found himself swaying.\n\n\"Doped,\" he said, and sat down again.\n\nThere was little of his brain that was awake, but that little he worked\nhard. He had been drugged. It was either in the kummel or in the coffee.\nNothing but dope would make him feel as he was feeling now. He fell into\nbed and pulled the clothes about him. He wanted to keep awake to fight\noff the effects of the stuff and, by an absurd perversion of reasoning,\nhe argued that he was in a more favourable position to carry out his\nplan if he made himself comfortable in bed, than if he followed any\nother course.\n\nThe drug worked slowly and erratically. He had moments of complete\nunconsciousness with intervals which, if they were not free from the\neffect of the agent, were at least lucid. One such interval must have\ncome after he had been in bed for about an hour, for he found himself\nwide awake and lay listening to the thumping of his heart, which seemed\nto shake the bed.\n\nThe room was bathed in a soft green light, for it was a night of full\nmoon. He could see dimly the furniture and the subdued gleam of silver\nwall-sconce, that caught the ghostly light and gave it a more mysterious\nvalue. He tried to rise but could not. To roll his head from side to\nside seemed the limitation of conscious effort.\n\nAnd whilst he looked, the door opened noiselessly and closed again.\nSomebody had come into the room, and that somebody passed softly across\nthe foot of the bed, and stood revealed against the window. Had he been\ncapable of speech he would have cried out.\n\nIt was the girl!\n\nHe saw her plainly in a moment. She wore a wrapper over her nightdress,\nand carried a small electric lamp in her hand. She went to the chair\nwhere he had thrown his clothes and made a search. He saw her take\nsomething out and put it under her wrap, then she went back the way she\ncame, pausing for the space of a second at the foot of his bed.\n\nShe stood there undecidedly, and presently she came up to the side of\nthe bed and bent down over him. His eyes were half closed; he had\nneither the power of opening or shutting them, but he could see clearly\nthe white hand that rested on the bed and the book that it held, and the\npolished table by the bedside reflecting the moonlight back to her face\nso that she seemed something as intangible and as shadowy as the night\nitself.\n\nA little smile played upon her pale face, and every whispered word she\nuttered was clear and distinct.\n\n\"Good-bye, poor Mr. Hay,\" she said softly.\n\nShe shook her head as though in pity; then, stopping swiftly, she kissed\nhim on the cheek and passed quickly to the half-open door by which she\nhad entered. She was nearing the door when she stopped dead and shrank\nback toward the bed. Another electric lamp gleamed unexpectedly. He saw\nthe white of her nightdress show as a dazzling strip of light where the\nbeam caught it. Then the unknown intruder touched on the light, and they\nstood revealed, the girl tall, imperious, a look of scorn on her\nbeautiful face, and the stout menial with the crooked nose.\n\nBoolba wore an old dressing-gown girdled about with a soiled rainbow\nsash. His feet were bare, and in his two hands laying from palm to palm\nwas a long thin knife.\n\nAt the sight of the girl he fell back, a grotesque sprawling movement\nwhich was not without its comicality. A look of blank bewilderment\ncreased his big face.\n\n\"You--you, Highness!\" he croaked. \"The Jew, where is he?\"\n\nShe was silent. Malcolm saw the quick rise and fall of her bosom, saw\nthe book clutched closer to her side beneath the filmy silken gown.\n\nBoolba looked from the girl to Malcolm, from Malcolm to the heavy\ncurtains at either side of the open window--curtains which the drugged\nman had not drawn.\n\n\"He has left his quarters, Highness,\" Boolba spoke eagerly; \"he was seen\nto enter the grounds of the palace--where is he?\"\n\nHe took a step toward her.\n\n\"Stand back--you slave!\" she breathed, but with a bound he was upon her.\nThere was a brief struggle, and the book was wrenched from her hand.\n\nMalcolm saw all this, but lay as one dead. He was conscious but\nparalysed by the potion, and could only watch the girl in the grip of\nthe obese monster and feel his heart going like a steam hammer.\n\nBoolba stood gloating over his prize, fondling the book in his big,\ncoarse hands. Malcolm wondered why the girl did not scream--yet how\ncould she? She was in his room in the middle of the night, she, a\ndaughter of emperors.\n\nThe man tried to wrench open the locks which held the covers, but\nfailed. Suddenly he looked up, and glared across at the girl.\n\nHe said nothing, but the suspicion in that scowl was emphasized when he\nmoved to the wall near the window and the light of a bracket lamp.\n\nAgain he examined the book and for the first time spoke:\n\n\"Oh, Highness, was it you who sent for Israel Kensky that the book\nshould be restored----\"\n\nSo far he got when an arm came from behind the curtain--a hand\nblue-veined, and it held a yellow handkerchief.\n\nThe girl saw it, and her hand went to her mouth.\n\nThen the handkerchief struck full across Boolba's face, covering it from\nforehead to the mouth.\n\nFor a moment the man was paralysed, then he pulled the handkerchief away\nand clawed at the clay-like substance which adhered to his face.\n\n\"Mother of God!\"\n\nHe screamed the words and, dropping the book, stumbled forward, rubbing\nat his face, shrieking with pain.\n\nThe girl ran swiftly through the open door, for feet were now pattering\nalong the corridors and the flicker of lights showed through the\ndoorway. Boolba was rolling on the ground in agony when the servants\ncrowded in, followed by the Grand Duke--and he alone was fully dressed.\n\n\"Boolba--what is it?\"\n\n\"The book--the book! It is mine! See ... floor!\"\n\nBut the book had disappeared.\n\n\"Where, Boolba--where, my good Boolba?\" The voice of Boolba's master was\ntremulous. \"Show me--did he strike you--he shall suffer, by the saints!\nLook for it, Boolba!\"\n\n\"Look! Look!\" yelled the writhing man. \"How shall I look? I who am\nblind--blind--blind!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTERROR IN MAKING\n\n\nIn the spring of 1919 Malcolm Hay came out from the Kursky Voksal\ncarrying his own well-worn valise. An indifferent cigar was clenched\nbetween his white teeth, and there was a sparkle of amusement in his\ngrave eyes. He stood seventy inches in his stockings, and an excellent\njudge of men who looked him over, noted the set and width of shoulders,\nthe upward lift of chin, the tanned face and flexibility of body, marked\nhim down \"soldier\"--either American or English.\n\nMalcolm looked up and down the deserted street and then caught the eye\nof the solitary _intooski_, a thoughtful-looking man with a short,\nsquare beard, looking monstrously stout in his padded green coat, the\nlivery of the Moscow drosky driver.\n\nThe man on the sidewalk smiled and walked across the pavement.\n\n\"Little brother,\" he said in fluent Russian, \"would you condescend to\ndrive me to the Hotel du Bazar Slav?\"\n\nThe driver who had noted so approvingly the shape of Malcolm's\nshoulders did not immediately answer; then:\n\n\"British?--I thought you were.\"\n\nHe spoke excellent English, and Malcolm looked up at him bewildered.\n\n\"I seem to know your face, too--let me think.\"\n\nThe cab-driver tapped his bearded chin.\n\n\"I have it--Hay. I met you four years ago at a dinner party in\nKieff--you are the manager of an oil company or something of the sort.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said the astonished young man, \"but--I don't exactly place\nyou.\"\n\nThe drosky driver smiled.\n\n\"And yet I dined with you,\" he said. \"I sat next the Grand Duchess\nIrene--later, when war broke out, I invited you to my headquarters.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" Malcolm's jaw dropped. \"General Malinkoff!\"\n\n\"Commanding the 84th Caucasian Division,\" said the bearded man dryly,\n\"and now commanding one little horse. If you will get into my excellent\ncab I will drive you to a restaurant where we may eat and drink and be\nalmost merry for--fifty roubles.\"\n\nMalcolm stepped into the little drosky like a man in a dream. Malinkoff!\nHe remembered him, a fine figure on a horse, riding through Kieff at\nthe head of a glittering throng of staff officers. There was a function\nat the Grand Hotel to meet the new Commander, a great parade at that\nancient palace in his honour--Malcolm had come in from the oil-fields\npartly to meet him at dinner--partly for news of one who had of a sudden\nvanished from his life.\n\nThe drosky drove furiously through the east end of the town, and the\npassenger noted that the driver was careful to avoid the big\nthoroughfares which led to the Krasnaya Plotzad and that centre of\nMoscow which is the Kremlin.\n\nPresently it drew up before a small eating-house in a poor street, and\nthe driver hoisted himself to the ground. He left his horse unattended\nand, leading the way, pushed open the swing doors of the restaurant and\npassed down a long, low-ceilinged room crowded with diners, to a table\nat the far end.\n\n\"Sit down, Mr. Hay. I can promise you a fair but by no means sybarite\nfeast--good morning, Nicholas Vassilitsky.\"\n\nHe nodded pleasantly to a grey-haired man in a workman's blouse sitting\nat the next table, and the man addressed rose stiffly, bowed and sat\ndown.\n\n\"If you wish your clothes valeted whilst you are in Moscow, I recommend\nmy friend,\" said the driver, snapping his fingers towards a stout\nwaitress. \"Colonel Nicholas Vassilitsky is not only an excellent\nDirector of Military Intelligence but he can press a pair of trousers\nwith any man.\"\n\nHe gave his orders briefly, and turned to his companion.\n\n\"First of all, let me interrogate you. You are on your way to\nPetrograd?\"\n\n\"Yes--I am on my way home. During the war I have been controlling allied\nsupplies in Little Russia--the Revolution stopped that.\"\n\n\"Fortunate man--to have a country,\" said General Malinkoff, and he spoke\nseriously and without bitterness. \"A country and an army--coherent,\ndisciplined comrades in arms.\"\n\nHe shrugged his padded shoulders.\n\n\"Yes--you are on your way to your home? It will take you months to leave\nthe country--if you ever leave it. I tried to leave last month. I am a\nreactionary with a leaning toward discipline. I cannot breathe the air\nof democracy. I used to think I had Liberal ideas. There was a time when\nI thought that a day would dawn when the world would be a great United\nStates of Free People. Ah, well--I am still a reactionary.\"\n\nMalcolm knew that behind those grave eyes was a world of laughter, that\nbeneath the solemn words was a gentle irony, and yet for the while he\ncould not distinguish how much of tragedy there was in the man's fun.\n\n\"But why are you----\"\n\n\"Driving a cab?\" The general finished the sentence. \"Because, my friend,\nI am human. I must eat, for example; I must have a room to sleep in. I\nneed cigarettes, and clean shirts at least three times a week--for God's\nsake never let that be known. I must also have warm clothes for the\nwinter--in fact, I must live.\"\n\n\"But haven't you--money?\" Malcolm felt all a decent man's embarrassment.\n\"Forgive me butting into your affairs, but naturally I'm rather hazed.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" laughed the general. \"A bottle of kavass, my peach of\nTurkistan, and a glass for our comrade.\"\n\n\"Long live the Revolution!\" wheezed the waitress mechanically.\n\n\"Long may it live, little mother!\" responded the general.\n\nWhen the girl had gone he squared round to his companion.\n\n\"I have no shame, Mr. Hay--I'm going to let you pay for your own dinner\nbecause I cannot in these democratic times pauperize you by paying for\nyou. No, I have no money. My balance in the State bank has been\nconfiscated to the sacred cause of the people. My estate, a hundred\nversts or so from Moscow, confiscated to the sacred cause of the\nRevolution, my house in Petrograd is commandeered to the sacred service\nof the Soviet.\"\n\n\"But your command?\"\n\nThe general did not smile now. He laid down his knife and fork and threw\na glance behind him.\n\n\"The men began shooting their officers in March, 1917,\" he said,\nlowering his voice. \"They executed the divisional staff in May--the\ndemocratic spirit was of slow growth. They spared me because I had\nwritten a book in my youth urging popular government and had been\nconfined in the fortess of Vilna for my crime. When the army was\ndisbanded I came to Moscow, and the cab was given to me by a former\ngroom of mine, one Isaac Mosservitch, who is now a judge of the high\ncourt and dispenses pretty good law, though he cannot sign his own\nname.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hay,\" he went on earnestly, \"you did wrong to come to Moscow. Get\nback to Kieff and strike down into the Caucasus. You can reach the\nAmerican posts outside of Tiflis. You'll never leave Russia. The\nBolsheviks have gone mad--blood-mad, murder-mad. Every foreigner is\nsuspect. The Americans and the English are being arrested. I can get you\na passport that will carry you to Odessa, and you can reach Batoum, and\nBaku from there.\"\n\nMalcolm leant back in his chair and looked thoughtfully at the other.\n\n\"Is it so bad?\"\n\n\"Bad! Moscow is a mad-house. Listen--do you hear anything?\"\n\nAbove the hum of conversation Malcolm caught a sound like the cracking\nof whips.\n\n\"Rifle-firing,\" said the general calmly. \"There's a counter-revolution\nin progress. The advanced Anarchists are in revolt against the\nBolsheviks. There is a counter-revolution every morning. We cab-drivers\nmeet after breakfast each day and decide amongst ourselves which of the\nstreets shall be avoided. We are pretty well informed--Prince\nDalgoursky, who was a captain in the Preopojensky Guard, sells\nnewspapers outside the Soviet headquarters, and the comrades give him\ntips. One of these days the comrades will shoot him, but for the moment\nhe is in favour, and makes as much as a hundred roubles a day.\"\n\nThe waitress came to the table, and the conversation momentarily ceased.\nWhen she had gone Malcolm put the question which he had asked so often\nin the past four years.\n\n\"Can you give me any news of the Grand Duke Yaroslav?\"\n\nThe other shook his head.\n\n\"His Highness was in Petrograd when I heard of him last.\"\n\n\"And--and his daughter? She has been with the Russian Red Cross on the\nRiga front, I know.\"\n\nThe bearded man shot a queer glance at his companion.\n\n\"In what circumstances did you see her last?\" he asked.\n\nMalcolm hesitated.\n\nHe could hardly tell a stranger of that tragic scene which was enacted\nin his bedroom. From the moment she had fled through the door he had not\nset eyes upon her. In the morning when he had wakened, feeling sick and\nill, he had been told that the Grand Duke and his daughter had left by\nthe early northern express for the capital. Of Boolba, that hideously\nblinded figure, he heard nothing. When he inquired for Israel Kensky,\nmen shrugged and said that he had \"disappeared.\" His house was closed\nand the old man might be in prison or in hiding. Later he was to learn\nthat Kensky had reappeared in Moscow, apparently without hindrance from\nthe authorities. As for Boolba, he had kept his counsel.\n\n\"You seem embarrassed,\" smiled Malinkoff. \"I will tell you why I ask.\nYou know that her Grand Ducal Highness was banished from Court for\ndisobedience to the royal will?\"\n\nMalcolm shook his head.\n\n\"I know nothing--absolutely nothing. Kieff and Odessa are full of\nrefugees and rumours, but one is as much a suspect as the other.\"\n\n\"She would not marry--that is all. I forget the name of the exalted\npersonage who was chosen for her, though I once helped to carry him up\nto bed--he drank heavily even in those days. God rest him! He died like\na man. They hung him in a sack in Peter and Paul, and he insulted the\nSoviets to the last!\"\n\n\"So--so she is not married?\"\n\nThe general was silent, beckoning the waitress.\n\n\"My little dear,\" he said, \"what shall I pay you?\"\n\nShe gave him the scores and they settled.\n\n\"Which way now?\" asked the general.\n\n\"I hardly know--what must a stranger do before he takes up his abode?\"\n\n\"First find an abode,\" said the general with a meaning smile. \"You asked\nme to drive you to the Hotel Bazar Slav, my simple but misguided friend!\nThat is a Soviet headquarters. You will certainly go to a place adjacent\nto the hotel to register yourself, and afterwards to the Commissary to\nregister all over again, and, if you are regarded with approval, which\nis hardly likely, you will be given a ticket which will enable you to\nsecure the necessities of life--the tickets are easier to get than the\nfood.\"\n\nThe first call at the house near the Bazar Slav gave them neither\ntrouble nor results. The Soviet headquarters was mainly concerned with\npurely administrative affairs, and the organization of its membership.\nIts corridors and doorway were crowded with soldiers wearing the\nfamiliar red armlet, and when Malinkoff secured an interview with a\nweary looking and unkempt official, who sat collarless in his shirt\nsleeves at a table covered with papers, that gentleman could do no more\nthan lean back in his chair and curse the interrupters volubly.\n\n\"We might have dispensed with the headquarters visit,\" said Malinkoff,\n\"but it is absolutely necessary that you should see the Commissary\nunless you want to be pulled out of your bed one night and shot before\nyou're thoroughly awake. By the way, we have an interesting American in\ngaol--by his description I gather he is what you would call a gun-man.\"\n\nMalcolm stared.\n\n\"Here--a gun-man?\"\n\nMalinkoff nodded.\n\n\"He held up the Treasurer-General of the Soviet and relieved him of his\nwealth. I would like to have met him--but I presume he is dead. Justice\nis swift in Moscow, especially for those who hold up the officials of\nthe Revolution.\"\n\n\"What sort of justice do these people administer?\" asked Malcolm\ncuriously.\n\nMalinkoff shrugged his padded shoulders.\n\n\"Sometimes I think that the very habit of justice is dead in this land,\"\nhe said. \"On the whole they are about as just and fair as was the old\nregime--that is not saying much, is it? The cruelty of our rule to-day\nis due rather to ignorance than to ill will. A few of the men higher up\nare working off their old grievances and are profiting enormously, but\nthe rank and file of the movement are labouring for the millennium.\"\n\n\"I think they're mad,\" said Malcolm.\n\n\"All injustice is mad,\" replied Malinkoff philosophically. \"Now get into\nmy little cab, and I will drive you to the Commissary.\"\n\nThe Commissary occupied a large house near the Igerian Gate. It was a\nhouse of such noble proportions that at first Malcolm thought it was one\nof the old public offices, and when Malinkoff had drawn up at the gate\nhe put the question.\n\n\"That is the house of the Grand Duke Yaroslav,\" said Malinkoff quietly.\n\"I think you were inquiring about him a little earlier in the day.\"\n\nThe name brought a little pang to Malcolm's heart, and he asked no\nfurther questions. There was a sentry on the _podyasde_--an untidy,\nunshaven man, smoking a cigarette--and a group of soldiers filled the\nentrance, evidently the remainder of the guard.\n\nThe Commissary was out. When would he be back? Only God knew. He had\ntaken \"the Little Mother\" for a drive in the country, or perhaps he had\ngone to Petrograd--who knew? There was nobody to see but the\nCommissary--on this fact they insisted with such vehemence that Malcolm\ngathered that whoever the gentleman was, he brooked no rivals and\nallowed no possible supplanter to stand near his throne.\n\nThey came back at four o'clock in the afternoon, but the Commissary was\nstill out. It was nine o'clock, after five inquiries, that the sentry\nreplied \"Yes\" to the inevitable question.\n\n\"Now you will see him,\" said Malinkoff, \"and the future depends upon the\npotency of your favourite patron saint.\"\n\nMalcolm stopped in the doorway.\n\n\"General----\" he said.\n\n\"Not that word,\" said Malinkoff quickly. \"Citizen or comrade--comrade\nfor preference.\"\n\n\"I feel that I am leading you into danger--I have been horribly selfish\nand thoughtless. Will it make any difference to you, your seeing him?\"\n\nMalinkoff shook his head.\n\n\"You're quite right, it is always dangerous to attract the attention of\nthe Committee for Combatting the Counter-Revolution,\" he said, \"but\nsince I have taken you in hand I might as well see him as stay outside\non my cab, because he is certain to inquire who brought you here, and it\nmight look suspicious if I did not come in with you. Besides, somebody\nwill have to vouch for you as a good comrade and friend of the Soviet.\"\n\nHe was half in earnest and half joking, but wholly fatalistic.\n\nAs they went up the broad spiral staircase which led to the main floor\nof the Yaroslav Palace, Malcolm had qualms. He heartily cursed himself\nfor bringing this man into danger. So far as he was concerned, as he\ntold himself, there was no risk at all, because he was a British\ntraveller, having no feeling one way or the other toward the Soviet\nGovernment. But Malinkoff would be a marked man, under suspicion all the\ntime. Before the office of the Commissary was a sentry without rifle. He\nsat at a table which completely blocked the doorway, except for about\neight inches at one side. He inquired the business of the visitors, took\ntheir names and handed them to a soldier, and with a sideways jerk of\nhis head invited them to squeeze past him into the bureau.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE COMMISSARY WITH THE CROOKED NOSE\n\n\nThere were a dozen men in the room in stained military overcoats and red\narmlets. One, evidently an officer, who carried a black portfolio under\nhis arm, was leaning against the panelled wall, smoking and snapping his\nfingers to a dingy white terrier that leapt to his repeated invitations.\n\nAt the table, covered with documents, were two people, the man and the\nwoman.\n\nShe, sprawling indolently forward, her head upon her arm, her strong\nbrown face turned to the man, was obviously a Jewess. The papers were\nstreaked and greasy where her thick black ringlets had rested, and the\nashes of her cigarette lay in little untidy heaps on the table.\n\nThe man was burly, with a great breadth of shoulder and big rough hands.\nBut it was his face which arrested the feet of Malcolm and brought him\nto a sudden halt the moment he came near enough to see and recognize the\nCommissary.\n\nIt was not by his bushy red beard nor the stiff, upstanding hair, but\nby the crooked nose, that he recognized Boolba, sometime serving-man to\nthe Grand Duke Yaroslav. Malcolm, looking at the sightless eyes, felt\nhis spine go creepy.\n\nBoolba lifted his head sharply at the sound of an unfamiliar footfall.\n\n\"Who is this?\" he asked. \"Sophia Kensky, you who are my eyes, tell me\nwho is this?\"\n\n\"Oh, a boorjoo,\" said the woman lazily.\n\n\"A foreigner too--who are you, boorjoo?\"\n\n\"A Britisher,\" said Malcolm.\n\nBoolba lifted his chin and turned his face at the voice.\n\n\"A Britisher,\" he repeated slowly. \"The man on the oil-fields. Tell me\nyour name.\"\n\n\"Hay--Malcolm Hay,\" said Malcolm, and Boolba nodded.\n\nHis face was like a mask and he expressed no emotion.\n\n\"And the other?\"\n\n\"Malinkoff!\" snapped the voice at Malcolm's side, and Boolba nodded.\n\n\"Commanding an army--I remember. You drive a cab, comrade. Are there any\ncomplaints against this man?\"\n\nHe turned his face to Sophia Kensky, and she shook her head.\n\n\"Are there any complaints against this man, Sophia?\" he repeated.\n\n\"None that I know. He is an aristocrat and a friend of the Romanoffs.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" The grunt sounded like a note of disappointment. \"What do you\nwant?\"\n\n\"The stranger wishes permission to remain in Moscow until he can find a\ntrain to the north,\" said Malinkoff.\n\nBoolba made no reply. He sat there, his elbows on the table, his fingers\ntwining and untwining the thick red hair of his beard.\n\n\"Where does he sleep to-night?\" he asked after awhile.\n\n\"He sleeps in my stable, near the Vassalli Prospekt,\" said Malinkoff.\n\nBoolba turned to the woman, who was lighting a new cigarette from the\nend of the old one, and said something in a low, growling tone.\n\n\"Do as you wish, my little pigeon,\" she said audibly.\n\nAgain his hand went to his beard and his big mouth opened in meditation.\nThen he said curtly:\n\n\"Sit down.\"\n\nThere was no place to sit, and the two men fell back amongst the\nsoldiers.\n\nAgain the two at the table consulted, and then Sophia Kensky called a\nname. The man in a faded officer's uniform came forward, his big black\nportfolio in his hand, and this he laid on the table, opening the flap\nand taking out a sheaf of papers.\n\n\"Read them to me, Sophia,\" said Boolba. \"Read their names.\"\n\nHe groped about on the table and found first a rubber stamp and then a\nsmall, flat ink-pad. Sophia lifted the first of the papers and spelt out\nthe names.\n\n\"Mishka Sasanoff,\" she said, and the man growled.\n\n\"An upstart woman and very ugly,\" he said. \"I remember her. She used to\nwhip her servants. Tell me, Sophia, my life, what has she done now?\"\n\n\"Plotted to destroy the Revolution,\" said the woman.\n\n\"Huh!\" grunted the man, as he brought his rubber stamp to the paper,\npassing it across to the waiting officer, who replaced it in his\nportfolio. \"And the next?\"\n\n\"Paul Geslkin,\" she said and passed the document to him. \"Plotting to\noverthrow the Revolution.\"\n\n\"A boorjoo, a tricky young man, in league with the priests,\" he said,\nand again his stamp came down upon the paper, and again the paper went\nacross the table into the portfolio of the officer.\n\nThe soldiers about Malcolm and his friend had edged away, and they were\nalone.\n\n\"What are these?\" whispered Malcolm.\n\n\"Death warrants,\" replied Malinkoff laconically, and for the second time\na cold chill ran down Malcolm's spine.\n\nName after name were read out, and the little rubber stamp, which\ncarried death to one and sorrow to so many, thudded down upon the paper.\nMalcolm felt physically ill. The room was close and reeked of vile\ntobacco fumes. There was no ventilation, and the oil lamps made the\napartment insufferably hot. An hour, two hours passed, and no further\nnotice was paid to the two men.\n\n\"I can't understand it quite,\" said Malinkoff in a low voice.\n\"Ordinarily this would mean serious trouble, but if the Commissary had\nany suspicion of you or me, we should have been in prison an hour ago.\"\n\nThen suddenly Boolba rose.\n\n\"What is the hour?\" he said.\n\nA dozen voices replied.\n\n\"Half-past ten? It is time that the sweeper was here.\"\n\nHe threw back his head and laughed, and the men joined in the laughter.\nWith a great yellow handkerchief, which reminded Malcolm of something\nparticularly unpleasant, Boolba wiped the streams from his sightless\neyes and bent down to the woman at his side, and Malcolm heard him say:\n\"What is his name--he told me,\" and then he stood up.\n\n\"Hay,\" he said, \"you are a boorjoo. You have ordered many men to sweep\nyour room. Is it not good that a house should be clean, eh?\"\n\n\"Very good, Boolba,\" said Malcolm quietly.\n\n\"Boolba he calls me. He remembers well. That is good! I stood behind\nhim, comrades, giving wine and coffee and bowing to this great English\nlord! Yes, I, Boolba!\" he struck his chest, \"crawled on my knees to this\nman, and he calls me Boolba now--Boolba!\" he roared ferociously. \"Come\nhere! Do this! Clean my boots, Boolba! Come, little Boolba, bow thy neck\nthat I may rest my foot!\"\n\nA voice from the door interrupted him.\n\n\"Good!\" he said. \"My sweeper has arrived, Hay. Once a day she sweeps my\nroom and once a day she makes my bed. No ordinary woman will satisfy\nBoolba. She must come in her furs, drive in her fine carriage from the\nNijitnkaya--behold!\"\n\nMalcolm looked to the doorway and was struck dumb with amazement.\n\nThe girl who came in was dressed better than he expected any woman to\nbe dressed in Moscow. A sable wrap was about her shoulders, a sable\ntoque was on her head. He could not see the worn shoes nor the shabby\ndress beneath the costly furs; indeed, he saw nothing but the face--the\nface of his dreams--unchanged, unlined, more beautiful than he had\nremembered her. She stood stiffly in her pride, her little chin held up,\nher contemptuous eyes fixed upon the man at the table. Then loosing her\nwrap, she hung it upon a peg, and opening a cupboard, took out a broad\nbroom.\n\n\"Sweep, Irene Yaroslav,\" said the man.\n\nMalcolm winced at the word, and Malinkoff turned to him sharply.\n\n\"You know her?\" he said. \"Of course you do--I remember. Was that why\nBoolba kept us waiting?\"\n\n\"He was butler in the Yaroslav household,\" said Malcolm in the same\ntone.\n\n\"That explains it,\" said Malinkoff. \"All this is for the humiliation of\nthe Grand Duchess.\"\n\n\"Sweep well, little one,\" scoffed Boolba from his table. \"Does it not do\nyour heart good, Sophia Kensky? Oh, if I had only eyes to see! Does she\ngo on her knees? Tell me, Sophia.\"\n\nBut the woman found no amusement in the sight, and she was not smiling.\nHer high forehead was knitted, her dark eyes followed every movement of\nthe girl. As Boolba finished speaking she leant forward and demanded\nharshly:\n\n\"Irene Yaroslav, where is Israel Kensky?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied the girl, not taking her eyes from her work.\n\n\"You lie,\" said the woman. \"You shall tell me where he is and where he\nhas hidden his 'Book of All-Power.' She knows, Boolba.\"\n\n\"Peace, peace!\" he said, laying his big hand on her shoulder. \"Presently\nshe will tell and be glad to tell. Where is your father, Irene\nYaroslav?\"\n\n\"You know best,\" she replied, and the answer seemed to afford him\namusement.\n\n\"He was a religious man,\" he scoffed. \"Did he not believe in miracles?\nWas there any saint in Kieff he did not patronize? He is with the saints\nthis day,\" and then, in a fierce whisper to Sophia--\"How did she look?\nTell me, Sophia. How did she look when I spoke?\"\n\n\"He died three weeks ago,\" said Irene quietly, \"at the Fortress of Peter\nand Paul,\" and Boolba rapped out an oath.\n\n\"Who told you? Who told you?\" he roared. \"Tell me who told you, and I\nwill have his heart out of him! I wanted to tell you that myself!\"\n\n\"The High Commissary Boyaski,\" she replied, and Boolba swallowed his\nrage, for who dared criticize the High Commissaries, who hold power of\nlife and death in their hands, even over their fellow officials? He sank\ndown in his chair again and turned impatiently to Sophia.\n\n\"Have you no tongue in your head, Sophia Kensky!\" he asked irritably.\n\"Tell me all she does. How is she sweeping--where?\"\n\n\"By the men, near the big bookcase,\" said the woman reluctantly.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" and he nodded his great head.\n\nHe rose, walked round the table, and paced slowly to the girl as she\nstood quietly waiting. Malcolm had no weapon in his pocket. He had been\nwarned by Malinkoff that visitors were searched. But on the table lay a\nsheathed sword--possibly the mark of authority which Boolba carried. But\nevidently this ceremony was a nightly occurrence. Boolba did no more\nthan pass his hand over the girl's face.\n\n\"She is cool,\" he said in a disappointed tone. \"You do not work hard\nenough, Irene Yaroslav. To-morrow you shall come with water and shall\nscrub this room.\"\n\nThe girl made no reply, but as he walked back to his seat of authority\nshe continued her work, her eyes fixed on the floor, oblivious of her\nsurroundings. Presently she worked round the room until she came to\nwhere Malcolm stood, and as she did so for the first time she raised her\nhead, and her eyes met his. Again he saw that little trick of hers; her\nhand went to her mouth, then her head went down, and she passed on as\nthough she had never seen him.\n\n\"What did she do, Sophia? Tell me what she did when she came to the\nEnglishman. Did she not see him?\"\n\n\"She was startled,\" grumbled Sophia; \"that is all. Boolba, let the woman\ngo.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, my little pigeon, she must finish her work.\"\n\n\"She has finished,\" said Sophia impatiently; \"how long must this go on,\nBoolba? Is she not an aristocrat and a Romanoff, and are there none of\nyour men who want wives?\"\n\nMalcolm felt rather than saw the head of every soldier in the room lift\nto these words.\n\n\"Wait a little,\" said Boolba. \"You forget the book, my little\npigeon--the 'Book of All-Power.' I would have that rather than that\nIrene Yaroslav found a good husband from our comrades. You may go, Irene\nYaroslav,\" he said. \"Serge!\"\n\nThe officer who had taken the death warrants, and who stood waiting for\ndismissal, came forward.\n\n\"Take our little brother Malinkoff and the Britisher Hay and place them\nboth in the prison of St. Basil. They are proved enemies to the\nRevolution.\"\n\n\"I wonder who will feed my little horse to-night,\" said Malinkoff as,\nhandcuffed to his companion, he marched through the streets in the light\nof dawn, en route, as he believed, to certain death.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nIN THE PRISON OF ST. BASIL\n\n\nThe temporary prison called by Boolba \"St. Basil,\" was made up of four\nblocks of buildings. All save one were built of grey granite, and\npresented, when seen from the courtyard below, tiers of little windows\nset with monotonous regularity in discoloured walls. The fourth was\nevidently also of granite, but at some recent period an attempt had been\nmade to cover its forbidding facade with plaster. The workmen had\nwearied of their good intent and had left off when their labours were\nhalf finished, which gave the building the gruesome appearance of having\nbeen half skinned. Flush with the four sides of the square was an open\nconcrete trench, approached at intervals by flights of half a dozen\nstone steps leading to this alley-way.\n\nMalcolm Hay was pushed down one of these, hurried along the alley-way,\npassing a number of mailed iron doors, and as many barred windows, and\nwas halted before one of the doors whilst the warder who all the time\nsmoked a cigar, produced a key. The door was unlocked, and Hay was\nthrust in. Malinkoff followed. The door slammed behind them, and they\nheard the \"click-clock\" of the steel lock shooting to its socket.\n\nThe room was a medium-sized apartment, innocent of furniture save for a\ntable in the centre of the room and a bench which ran round the walls.\nLight came from a small window giving a restricted view of the courtyard\nand a barred transom above the doorway. An oblong slit of ground glass\nbehind which was evidently an electric globe served for the night.\n\nThere were two occupants of the room, who looked up, one--a grimy,\ndishevelled priest--blankly, the other with the light of interest in his\neyes.\n\nHe sat in his shirt-sleeves, his coat being rolled up to serve as a\npillow. Above the \"bed\" hung a Derby hat--an incongruous object. He was\nshort, stout, and fresh coloured, with a startling black moustache\nelaborately curled at the ends and two grey eyes that were lined around\nwith much laughter. He walked slowly to the party and held out his hand\nto Malcolm.\n\n\"Welcome to the original Bughouse,\" he said, and from his accent it was\nimpossible to discover whether he was American or English. \"On behalf of\nself an' partner, we welcome you to Bughouse Lodge. When do you go to\nthe chair--he's due to-day,\" he jerked his thumb at the crooning priest.\n\"I can't say I'm sorry. So far as I am concerned he's been dead ever\nsince they put him here.\"\n\nMalcolm recognized the little man in a flash. It was his acquaintance of\nLondon.\n\n\"You don't remember me,\" smiled Malcolm, \"but what is your particular\ncrime?\"\n\nThe little man's face creased with laughter.\n\n\"Shootin' up Tcherekin,\" he said tersely, and Malinkoff's eyebrows rose.\n\n\"You're--Beem--is that how you pronounce it?\"\n\n\"Bim,\" said the other, \"B-I-M. Christian name Cherry--Cherry Bim; see\nthe idea? Named after the angels. Say, when I was a kid--I've got a\nphotograph way home in Brooklyn to prove it--I had golden hair in long\nringlets!\"\n\nMalinkoff chuckled softly.\n\n\"This is the American who held up Tcherekin and nearly got away with ten\nmillion roubles,\" he said.\n\nCherry Bim had taken down his Derby and had adjusted it at the angle\ndemanded by the circumstances.\n\n\"That's right--but I didn't know they was roubles. I _should_ excite my\nmentality over waste paper! No, we got word that it was French money.\"\n\n\"There was another man in it?\" said Malinkoff, lighting a\ncigarette--there had been no attempt to search them.\n\n\"Don't let that match go out!\" begged Cherry Bim, and dug a stub from\nhis waistcoat pocket. \"Yes,\" he puffed, \"Isaac Moskava--they killed poor\nold Issy. He was a good feller, but too--too--what's the word when a\nfeller falls to every dame he meets?\"\n\n\"Impressionable?\" suggested Malcolm.\n\n\"That's the word,\" nodded Cherry Bim; \"we'd got away with twenty\nthousand dollars' worth of real sparklers in Petrograd. They used to\nbelong to a princess, and we took 'em off the lady friends of Groobal,\nthe Food Commissioner, and I suggested we should beat it across the\nSwedish frontier. But no, he had a girl in Moscow--he was that kind of\nguy who could smell patchouli a million miles away.\"\n\nMalcolm gazed at the man in wonderment.\n\n\"Do I understand that you are a--a----\" He hesitated to describe his\ncompanion in misfortune, realizing that it was a very delicate position.\n\n\"I'm a cavalier of industry,\" said Cherry Bim, with a flourish.\n\n\"Chevalier is the word you want,\" suggested Malcolm, responding to his\ngeniality.\n\n\"It's all one,\" said the other cheerfully. \"It means crook, I guess?\nDon't think,\" he said seriously, \"don't you think that I'm one of those\ncheap gun-men you can buy for ten dollars, because I'm not. It was the\nlove of guns that brought me into trouble. It wasn't trouble that\nbrought me to the guns. I could use a gun when I was seven,\" he said.\n\"My dad--God love him!--lived in Utah, and I was born at Broke Creek and\ncut my teeth on a '45. I could shoot the tail-feathers off a fly's\nwing,\" he said. \"I could shoot the nose off a mosquito.\"\n\nIt was the deceased Isaac Moskava who had brought him to Russia, he\nsaid. They had been fellow fugitives to Canada, and Isaac, who had\nfriends in a dozen Soviets, had painted an entrancing picture of the\npickings which were to be had in Petrograd. They worked their way across\nCanada and shipped on a Swedish barque, working their passage before the\nmast. At Stockholm Issy had found a friend, who forwarded them carriage\npaid to the capital, whereafter things went well.\n\n\"Have you got any food?\" asked Cherry Bim suddenly. \"They starve you\nhere. Did you ever eat _schie_? It's hot water smelling of cabbage.\"\n\n\"Have you been tried?\" asked Malinkoff, and the man smiled.\n\n\"Tried!\" he said contemptuously. \"Say, what do you think's goin' to\nhappen to you? Do you think you'll go up before a judge and hire a\nlawyer to defend you? Not much. If they try you, it's because they've\ngot something funny to tell you. Look here.\"\n\nHe leapt up on to the bench with surprising agility and stood on tiptoe,\nso that his eyes came level with a little grating in the wall. The\nopening gave a view of another cell.\n\n\"Look,\" said Cherry Bim, stepping aside, and Malcolm peered through the\nopening.\n\nAt first he could see nothing, for the cell was darker than the room he\nwas in, but presently he distinguished a huddled form lying on the\nbench, and even as he looked it was galvanized to life. It was an old\nman who had leaped from the bench mumbling and mouthing in his terror.\n\n\"I am awake! I am awake!\" he screamed in Russian. \"_Gospodar_, observe\nme! I am awake!\"\n\nHis wild yells shrunk to a shrill sobbing, and then, with a long sigh,\nhe climbed back to the bench and turned his back to the wall. Malcolm\nexchanged glances with Malinkoff, who had shared the view.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Come down and I'll tell you. Don't let the old man hear you speak--he's\nfrightened.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" he asked curiously.\n\nMalcolm repeated the words, and Cherry Bim nodded.\n\n\"I see. I thought they were stuffing me when they told me, but it's\nevidently true. He's a Jew,\" he went on. \"Do you think them guys don't\nkill Jews? Don't you make any mistake about that--they'll kill anybody.\nThis old man has a daughter or a granddaughter, and one of the comrades\ngot fresh with him, so poor old Moses--I don't know his name but he\nlooks like the picture of Moses that we had in our Bible at home--shot\nat this fellow and broke his jaw, so they sent him to be killed in his\nsleep.\"\n\n\"In his sleep?\" repeated Malcolm incredulously, and Cherry Bim nodded.\n\n\"That's it,\" he said. \"So long as he's awake they won't kill him--at\nleast they say so. I guess when his time comes they'll settle him,\nasleep or awake. The poor old guy thinks that so long as he's awake he's\nsafe--do you get me?\"\n\n\"It's hellish!\" said Malcolm between his teeth. \"They must be devils.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, they're not,\" said Cherry Bim. \"I've got nothing on the\nSoviets. I bet the fellow that invented that way of torturing the old\nman thinks he's done a grand bit of work. Say, suppose you turned a lot\nof kids loose to govern the United States, why Broadway would be all\ncluttered up with dead nursery maids and murdered governesses. That's\nwhat's happening in Russia. They don't mean any harm. They're doing all\nthey know to govern, only they don't know much--take no notice of his\nreverence, he always gets like this round about meal times.\"\n\nThe voice of the black-coated priest grew louder. He stood before the\nbarred window, crossing himself incessantly.\n\n\"It is the celebration of the Divine Mystery,\" said Malinkoff in a low\nvoice, and removed his cap.\n\n\"For our holy fathers the high priests Basil the Great, Gregory the\nDivine, Nicholas of Myra in Lycia, for Peter and Alexis and Jonas, and\nall holy high priests,\" groaned the man, \"for the holy wonder workers,\nthe disinterested Cosmas and Damiauns, Cyrus and John, Pantaleon and\nHermolaus, and all unmercenary saints...!\n\n\"By the intercession of these, look down upon us, O God!\"\n\nHe walked back to his seat and, taking compassion upon this man with a\nwhite, drawn face, Malcolm went to him.\n\n\"Little father,\" he said, \"is there anything we can do for you?\"\n\nHe produced his cigarette case, but the pope shook his head.\n\n\"There is nothing, my son\" he replied in a weary voice, which he did\nnot raise above one monotonous tone, \"unless you can find the means of\nbringing Boolba to this cell. Oh, for an hour of the old life!\" He\nraised his hand and his voice at the same moment, and the colour came to\nhis cheeks. \"I would take this Boolba,\" he said, \"as holy Ivan took the\ntraitors before the Kremlin, and first I would pour boiling hot water\nupon him and then ice cold water, and then I would flay him, suspending\nhim by the ankles; then before he was dead I would cut him in four\npieces----\"\n\n\"Phew!\" said Malcolm, and walked away.\n\n\"Did you expect to find a penitent soul?\" asked Malinkoff dryly. \"My\ndear fellow, there is very little difference between the Russian of\nto-day and the Russian of twelve months ago, with this exception, that\nthe men who had it easy are now having it hard, and those who had to\nwork and to be judged are now the judges.\"\n\nMalcolm said nothing. He went to the bench and making himself as\ncomfortable as possible he lay down. It was astounding that he could be,\nas he was, accustomed to captivity in the space of a few hours. He might\nhave lived in bondage all his life, and he would be prepared to live for\never so long as--he did not want to think of the girl, that sweeper of\nBoolba's.\n\nAs to his own fate he was indifferent. Somehow he believed that he was\nnot destined to die in this horrible place, and prayed that at least he\nmight see the girl once more before he fell a victim to the malice of\nthe ex-butler.\n\nTo his agony of mind was added a more prosaic distress--he was\nravenously hungry, a sensation which was shared by his two companions.\n\n\"I've never known them to be so late,\" complained Cherry Bim\nregretfully. \"There's usually a bit of black bread, if there's nothing\nelse.\"\n\nHe walked to the window and, leaning his arms on the sill, looked\ndisconsolately forth.\n\n\"Hi, Ruski!\" he yelled at some person unseen, and the other inmates of\nthe room could see him making extravagant pantomime, which produced\nnothing in the shape of food.\n\nIt was three o'clock in the afternoon, and Malcolm was dozing, when they\nheard the grate of the key in the lock and the slipping of bolts, then\nthe door opened slowly. Malcolm leapt forward.\n\n\"Irene--your Highness!\" he gasped.\n\nThe girl walked into the cell without a word, and put the big basket she\nhad been carrying upon the table. There was a faint colour in the face\nshe turned to Malcolm. Her hands were outstretched to him, and he caught\nthem in his own and held them together.\n\n\"Poor little girl!\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"Mr. Hay, you have made good progress in your Russian since I met you\nlast,\" she said. \"General Malinkoff, isn't it?\"\n\nThe general stood strictly to attention, his hand at his cap--a fact\nwhich seemed to afford great amusement to the gaoler who stood in the\ndoorway, and who was an interested spectator.\n\n\"It was Boolba's idea that I should bring you food,\" said the girl, \"and\nI have been ordered to bring it to you every day. I have an idea that he\nthinks\"--she stopped--\"that he thinks I like you,\" she went on frankly,\n\"and of course that is true. I like all people who fly into danger to\nrescue distressed females,\" she smiled.\n\n\"Can anything be done for you?\" asked Malcolm in a low voice. \"Can't you\nget away from this place? Have you no friends?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"I have one friend,\" she said, \"who is in even greater danger than\nI--no, I do not mean you. Mr. Hay\"--she lowered her voice--\"there may be\na chance of getting you out of this horrible place, but it is a very\nfaint chance. Will you promise me that if you get away you will leave\nRussia at once?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"You asked me that once before, your Highness,\" he said. \"I am less\ninclined to leave Russia now than I was in the old days, when the danger\nwas not so evident.\"\n\n\"Highness\"--it was the priest who spoke--\"your magnificence has brought\nme food also? Highness, I served your magnificent father. Do you not\nremember Gregory the priest in the cathedral at Vladimir?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"I have food for you, father,\" she said, \"but I do not recall you.\"\n\n\"Highness\" he spoke eagerly and his eyes were blazing, \"since you go\nfree, will you not say a prayer for me before the miraculous Virgin? Or,\nbetter still, before the tomb of the holy and sainted Dimitry in the\ncathedral of the Archangel! And, lady,\" he seized her hand in entreaty,\n\"before the relics of St. Philip the Martyr in our Holy Cathedral of the\nAssumption.\"\n\nGently the girl disengaged her arm.\n\n\"Father, I will pray for you,\" she said. \"Good-bye!\" she said to\nMalcolm, and again extended both her hands, \"till to-morrow!\"\n\nMalcolm raised the hands to his lips, and stood like a man in a dream,\nlong after the door had slammed behind her.\n\n\"Gee!\" said the voice of Cherry Bim with a long sigh. \"She don't\nremember me, an' I don't know whether to be glad or sorry--some peach!\"\n\nMalcolm turned on him savagely, but it was evident the man had meant no\nharm.\n\n\"She is a friend of mine,\" he said sharply.\n\n\"Sure she is,\" said the placid Cherry, unpacking the basket, \"and the\nright kind of friend. If this isn't caviare! Say, shut your eyes, and\nyou'd think you were at Rectoris.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nCHERRY BIM MAKES A STATEMENT\n\n\nMalcolm was awakened in the night by a scream. He sprang from the bench,\nhis face bathed in perspiration.\n\n\"What was that?\" he asked hoarsely.\n\nMalinkoff was sitting on the edge of the bench rubbing his eyes.\n\n\"I heard something,\" he yawned.\n\nOnly Cheery Bim had not moved. He was lying on his back with his knees\nup and his hands behind his head, wide awake.\n\n\"What was it, Cherry?\" asked Malcolm.\n\nSlowly the little man rose and stretched himself.\n\n\"I wonder what the time is,\" he said evasively.\n\nMalcolm looked at his watch.\n\n\"Half-past three,\" he replied.\n\n\"He's asleep anyway,\" said Cherry, nodding towards the recumbent figure\nof the priest. \"He might have been useful--but I forgot the old man's a\nJew.\"\n\n\"Do you mean----?\" said Malinkoff and glanced at the gate.\n\nCherry nodded again.\n\n\"I never thought they'd carry it out according to programme,\" he said,\n\"but they did. I heard 'em come in.\"\n\nThere was the thud of a door closing.\n\n\"That's the door of his cell. They have taken him out, I guess. The last\nfellow they killed in there they hung on a hook--just put a rope round\nhis neck and pushed him in a bag. He was a long time dying,\" he said\nreflectively, and Malcolm saw that the little man's lower lip was\ntrembling in spite of his calm, matter-of-fact tone.\n\nMalinkoff had walked across to the priest, and had shaken him awake.\n\n\"Father,\" he said, \"a man has just died in the next cell. Would you not\nread the Office of the Dead?\"\n\nThe priest rose with an ill grace.\n\n\"Why should I be awakened from my sleep?\" he complained. \"Who is this\nman?\"\n\n\"I do not know his name,\" said Malinkoff, \"but he is a Jew----\"\n\n\"A Jew!\"\n\nThe priest spat on the ground contemptuously.\n\n\"What, I speak an office for a Jew?\" he demanded, wrath in his face.\n\n\"For a man, for a human fellow creature,\" said Malinkoff sternly, but\nthe priest had gone back to his hard couch, nor would he leave it, and\nMalinkoff, with a shrug of his shoulders, went back to his bed.\n\n\"That is Russia--eternal Russia,\" he said, and he spoke without\nbitterness. \"Neither Czar nor Soviet will alter it.\"\n\nThey did not go to sleep again. Something was speaking to them from the\nnext cell, something that whimpered and raised its hands in appeal, and\nthey welcomed the daylight, but not the diversion which daylight\nbrought. Again the door banged open, and this time a file of soldiers\nstood in the entrance.\n\n\"Boris Michaelovitch,\" said the dark figure in the entrance, \"it is the\nhour!\"\n\nThe priest rose slowly. His face was grey, the hands clasped together\nbefore him shook; nevertheless, he walked firmly to the door.\n\nBefore the soldiers had closed around him he turned and raised his hand\nin blessing, and Malinkoff fell upon his knees.\n\nAgain the door slammed and the bolts shot home, and they waited in\nsilence.\n\nThere was no sound for ten minutes, then came a crash of musketry, so\nunexpected and so loud that it almost deafened them. A second volley\nfollowed, and after an interval a third, and then silence. Cherry Bim\nwiped his forehead.\n\n\"Three this morning,\" he said unsteadily. \"Anyway, it's better than\nhanging.\"\n\nThere was a long pause, and then:\n\n\"Say,\" he said, \"I'm sorry I said I was glad that guy was going.\"\n\nMalcolm understood.\n\nThe day brought Irene at the same hour as on the previous afternoon. She\nlooked around for the priest, and apparently understood, for she made no\nreference to the missing man.\n\n\"If you can get away from here,\" she said, \"go to Preopojenski. That is\na village a few versts from here. I tell you this, but----\"\n\nShe did not complete her sentence, but Malcolm could guess from the\nhopeless despair in her voice.\n\n\"Excuse me, miss,\" interrupted Cherry Bim. \"Ain't there any way of\ngetting a gun for a man? Any old kind of gun,\" he said urgently; \"Colt,\nSmith-Wesson, Browning, Mauser--I can handle 'em all--but Colt\npreferred.\"\n\nShe shook her head sadly.\n\n\"It is impossible,\" she said. \"I am searched every time I come in\nthrough the lodge.\"\n\n\"In a pie,\" urged Cherry. \"I've read in stories how you can get these\nthings in a pie. Couldn't you make----\"\n\n\"It's quite impossible,\" she said. \"Even bread is cut into four pieces.\nThat is done in the lodge.\"\n\nCherry Bim cast envious eyes on the tall guard at the doorway. He had a\nlong revolver.\n\n\"I'll bet,\" said Cherry bitterly, \"he don't know any more about a gun\nthan a school-marm. Why, he couldn't hit a house unless he was inside of\nit.\"\n\n\"I must go now,\" said the girl hastily.\n\n\"Tell me one thing,\" said Malcolm. \"You spoke yesterday of having one\nfriend. Is that friend Israel Kensky?\"\n\n\"Hush!\" she said.\n\nShe took his hand in both of hers.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Hay,\" she said. \"I may not come to-morrow.\"\n\nHer voice was hard and strained, and she seemed anxious to end the\ninterview.\n\n\"Boolba told me this morning,\" she went on, speaking rapidly but little\nabove a whisper, \"that he had----certain plans about me. Good-bye, Mr.\nHay!\"\n\nThis time she shook hands with Malinkoff.\n\n\"Don't forget the village of Preopojensky,\" she repeated. \"There is only\nthe slightest chance, but if God is merciful and you reach the outside\nworld, you will find the house of Ivan Petroff--please remember that.\"\nAnd in a minute she was gone.\n\n\"I wonder what was wrong,\" said Malcolm. \"She was not so frightened\nwhen she came in, then she changed as though----\"\n\nLooking round he had seen, only for the fraction of a second, a hand\nthrough the grating over the bench. Someone had been listening in the\nnext cell, and the girl had seen him. He sprang upon a bench and peered\nthrough, in time to see the man vanish beyond the angle of his vision.\nMalinkoff was lighting his last cigarette.\n\n\"My friend,\" he said, \"I have an idea that in the early hours of the\nmorning you and I will go the same way as the unfortunate priest.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\" asked Malcolm quickly.\n\n\"Not only do I, but the Grand Duchess thinks so also,\" said Malinkoff.\n\"Possibly this is news.\"\n\nAgain the door was opened, and this time it was an officer of the Red\nGuard who appeared. He had evidently been chosen because of his\nknowledge of English.\n\n\"I want the thief,\" he said tersely in that language.\n\n\"That sounds remarkably like me,\" said Cherry.\n\nHe put on his Derby hat slowly and went forth in his shirt-sleeves. They\nwatched him through the window being taken across the courtyard and\nthrough the archway which led to the prison offices and the outer gate.\n\n\"They haven't released him, I suppose?\" asked Malcolm, and Malinkoff\nshook his head.\n\n\"He is to be interrogated,\" he said. \"Evidently there is something which\nBoolba wants to know about us, and which he believes this man will\ntell.\"\n\nMalcolm was silent, turning matters over in his mind.\n\n\"He won't tell anything that will injure us,\" he said.\n\n\"But the man is a crook,\" said Malinkoff; \"that is the word, isn't it?\"\n\n\"That's the word,\" agreed Malcolm grimly, \"but he's also a man of my own\nrace and breed, and whilst I would not trust him with my pocket-book--or\nI should not have trusted him before I came in here--I think I can trust\nhim with my life, supposing that he has my life in his hands.\"\n\nIn twenty minutes Cherry Bim was back, very solemn and mysterious until\nthe gaoler was gone. Then he asked:\n\n\"Who is Israel Kensky, anyway?\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Malcolm quickly.\n\n\"Because I'm going to make a statement about him--a written statement,\"\nhe said cheerfully. \"I'm going to have a room all to myself,\" he spoke\nslowly as though he were repeating something which he had already told\nhimself, \"because I am not a quick writer. Then I am going to tell all\nthat she said about Israel Kensky.\"\n\n\"You can tell that in a second,\" said Malcolm sternly, and the little\nman raised a lofty hand.\n\n\"Don't get up in the air.\"\n\n\"Why have they sent you back now?\"\n\n\"To ask a question or two,\" said Cherry.\n\nHe put on his coat, examined the interior of his hat thoughtfully, and\njammed it down on his head.\n\n\"Ten minutes are supposed to elapse,\" he said melodramatically, \"passed\nin light and airy conversation about a book--the 'Book of--of----\"\n\n\"'All-Power'?\" said Malcolm.\n\n\"That's the fellow. I should say it's the history of this darned place.\nHere they come.\"\n\nHe pulled down his coat, brushed his sleeves and stepped forward briskly\nto meet the English-speaking officer.\n\nThey passed an anxious two hours before he returned, and, if anything,\nhe was more solemn than ever. He made no reply to their questions, but\npaced the room, and then he began to sing, and his tune had more reason\nthan rhyme.\n\n\"Look through the grating,\" he chanted, \"see if anybody is watching or\nlistening, my honey, oh my honey!\"\n\n\"There's nobody there,\" said Malcolm after a brief inspection.\n\n\"He'll be back again in five minutes,\" said Cherry, stopping his song\nand speaking rapidly. \"I told him I wanted to be sure on one point, and\nhe brought me back. I could have done it, but I wouldn't leave you\nalone.\"\n\n\"Done what?\" asked Malcolm.\n\n\"Saved myself. Do you know what I saw when I got into that room for the\nfirst time? The guy in charge was locking away in a desk three guns and\nabout ten packets of shells. It sounds like a fairy story, but it's\ntrue, and it's a desk with a lock that you could open with your teeth!\"\n\nIt was Malinkoff who saw the possibilities of the situation which the\nman described.\n\n\"And they left you alone in the room?\" he asked quickly.\n\n\"Sure,\" said Cherry. \"Lift my hat, and lift it steady.\"\n\nMalcolm pulled his hat up, and the butt of a revolver slipped out.\n\n\"There's a Browning there--be careful,\" said Cherry, ducking his head\nand pulling off his hat in one motion. \"Here's the other under my arm,\"\nhe put his hand beneath his coat and pulled out a Colt.\n\n\"Here are the shells for the automatic. I'll take the long fellow. Now\nlisten, you boys,\" said Cherry. \"Through that gateway at the end of the\nyard, you come to another yard and another gate, which has a guard on\nit. Whether we get away or whether we don't, depends on whether our luck\nis in or out.\"\n\n\"Look!\" he whispered, \"here comes Percy!\"\n\nThe door swung open and the officer beckoned Cherry forward with a lift\nof his chin. Cherry walked toward him and the officer half turned in the\nattitude of one who was showing another out. Cherry's hand shot out,\ncaught the man by the loose of his tunic and swung him into the room.\n\n\"Laugh and the world laughs with you,\" said Cherry, who had an\nassortment of literary quotations culled from heaven knows where. \"Shout\nand you sleep alone!\"\n\nThe muzzle of a long-barrelled '45 was stuck in the man's stomach. He\ndid not see it, but he guessed it, and his hands went up.\n\n\"Tie him up--he wears braces,\" said Cherry. \"I'll take that belt of\ndeadly weapons.\" He pulled one revolver from the man's holster and\nexamined it with an expert's eye. \"Not been cleaned for a month,\" he\ngrowled; \"you don't deserve to be trusted with a gun.\"\n\nHe strapped the belt about his waist and sighed happily.\n\nThey gagged the man with a handkerchief, and threw him ungently upon\nthe bench before they passed through the open door to comparative\nfreedom. Cherry locked and bolted the door behind them, and pulled down\nthe outer shutter, with which, on occasions, the gaoler made life in the\ncells a little more unendurable by excluding the light. The cells were\nbelow the level of the courtyard, and they moved along the trench from\nwhich they opened.\n\nPacing his beat by the gateway was a solitary sentry.\n\n\"Stay here,\" whispered Cherry; \"he has seen me going backward and\nforward, and maybe he thinks I'm one of the official classes.\"\n\nHe mounted the step leading up from the trench, and walked boldly toward\nthe gateway. Nearing the man, he turned to wave a greeting to an\nimaginary companion. In reality he was looking to see whether there were\nany observers of the act which was to follow.\n\nWatching him, they did not see exactly what had happened. Suddenly the\nsoldier doubled up like a jack-knife and fell.\n\nCherry bent over him, lifted the rifle and stood it against the wall,\nthen, exhibiting remarkable strength for so small a man, he picked up\nthe man in his arms and dropped him into the trench which terminated at\nthe gateway. They heard the thud of his body, and, breaking cover, they\nraced across the yard, joining Cherry, who led the way through the deep\narch.\n\nNow they saw the outer barrier. It consisted of a formidable iron\ngrille. To their right was a gloomy building, which Malcolm judged was\nthe bureau of the prison, to the left a high wall. On either side of the\ngateway was a squat lodge, and before these were half a dozen soldiers,\nsome leaning against the gate, some sitting in the doorway of the\nlodges, but all carrying rifles.\n\n\"This way,\" said Cherry under his breath, and turned into the office.\n\nThe door of the room on his left was open, and into this they walked. It\nwas empty, but scarcely had they closed the door than there were\nfootsteps outside. Cherry, with a gun in each hand, a hard and ugly grin\non his fat face, covered the door, but the footsteps passed.\n\nThere was a babble of voices outside and a rattle and creak of gates.\nMalcolm crept to the one window which the office held (he guessed it was\nhere that Cherry had written his \"statement\"), and peeped cautiously\nforth.\n\nA big closed auto was entering the gate, and he pulled his head back.\nCherry was at his side.\n\n\"Somebody visiting--a fellow high up,\" whispered the latter hoarsely;\n\"they'll come in here, the guy we left in the cell told me he'd want\nthis room. Try that door!\"\n\nHe pointed to a tall press and Malinkoff was there in a second. The\npress was evidently used for the storage of stationery. There was one\nshelf, half way up, laden with packages of paper, and Malinkoff lifted\none end. The other slipped and the packets dropped with a crash. But the\npurring of the auto in the yard was noisy enough to drown the sound\nunless somebody was outside the door.\n\n\"Three can squeeze in--you go first, Mr. Hay.\"\n\nIt was more than a squeeze, it was a torture, but the door closed on\nthem.\n\nMalcolm had an insane desire to laugh, but he checked it at the sound of\na voice--for it was the voice of Boolba.\n\n\"I cannot stay very long, comrade,\" he was saying as he entered the\nroom, \"but....\"\n\nThe rest was a mumble.\n\n\"I will see that she is kept by herself,\" said a strange voice,\nevidently of someone in authority at the prison.\n\nMalcolm bit his lips to check the cry that rose.\n\n\"Irene!\"\n\n\"...\" Boolba's deep voice was again a rumble.\n\n\"Yes, comrade, I will bring her in ... let me lead you to a chair.\"\n\nHe evidently went to the door and called, and immediately there was a\ntramp of feet.\n\n\"What does this mean, Boolba?\"\n\nMalcolm knew the voice--he had heard it before--and his relief was such\nthat all sense of his own danger passed.\n\n\"Sophia Kensky,\" Boolba was speaking now, \"you are under arrest by order\nof the Soviet.\"\n\n\"Arrest!\" the word was screamed, \"me----?\"\n\n\"You are plotting against the Revolution, and your wickedness has been\ndiscovered,\" said Boolba. \"_Matinshka!_ Little mama, it is ordered!\"\n\n\"You lie! You lie!\" she screeched. \"You blind devil--I spit on you! You\narrest me because you want the aristocrat Irene Yaroslav! Blind pig!\"\n\n\"_Prekanzeno, dushinka!_ It is ordered, dear little soul,\" murmured\nBoolba. \"I go back alone--listen! My auto is turning. I go back alone,\n_drushka_, and who shall be my eyes now that my little mama is gone?\"\n\nThey heard the chair pushed back as he rose and the scream and flurry as\nshe leapt at him.\n\n\"Keep her away, little comrade,\" roared Boolba. \"Keep her away--I am\nblind; her father blinded me; keep her away!\"\n\nIt was Cherry Bim who slipped first from the cupboard.\n\nUnder the menace of his guns the soldiers fell back.\n\n\"Auto Russki--hold up the guard, Hay,\" he muttered, and Malinkoff jumped\nthrough the doorway to the step of the big car in one bound.\n\nCherry held the room. He spoke no Russian, but his guns were\nmulti-lingual. There was a shot outside before he fired three times into\nthe room. Then he fell back, slamming the door, and jumped into the car\nas it moved through the open gateway.\n\nMalcolm was on one footboard, Malinkoff by the side of the chauffeur on\nthe other.\n\nSo they rocked through the ill-paved streets of Moscow, and rushed the\nsuburban barricade without mishap.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nIN THE HOLY VILLAGE\n\n\n\"Preopojensky, but by a circuitous route,\" said Malinkoff, speaking\nacross the chauffeur. \"What about the wires?\"\n\nHe looked up at the telegraph lines, looping from pole to pole, and\nMalcolm thrust his head into the window of the limousine to communicate\nthis danger to the sybaritic Mr. Bim, who was spraying himself with\nperfume from a bottle he had found in the well-equipped interior of the\ncar.\n\n\"Stop,\" said Cherry. \"We're well away from Moscow.\"\n\nAt a word from Malinkoff the chauffeur brought the car to a standstill\nand Cherry slipped out, revolver in hand.\n\nThen to the amazement of Malcolm and the unfeigned admiration of the\ngeneral, Cherry Bim made good his boast. Four times his gun cracked and\nat each shot a line broke.\n\n\"To be repeated at intervals,\" said Cherry, climbing into the car. \"Wake\nme in half an hour,\" and, curling himself up in the luxurious depths of\nswansdown cushions, he fell asleep.\n\nHappily Malinkoff knew the country to an inch. They were not able to\navoid the villages without avoiding the roads, but they circumnavigated\nthe towns. At nightfall they were in the depths of a wood which ran down\nto the edge of the big lake on which the holy village of Preopojensky\nstands.\n\n\"The chauffeur is not the difficulty I thought he would be,\" reported\nMalinkoff; \"he used to drive Korniloff in the days when he was a\ndivisional general, and he is willing to throw in his lot with ours.\"\n\n\"Can you trust him!\" asked Malcolm.\n\n\"I think so,\" said Malinkoff, \"unless we shoot him we simply must trust\nhim--what do you think, Mr. Bim?\"\n\n\"You can call me Cherry,\" said that worthy. He was eating bread and sour\ncheese which had been bought at a fabulous price in one of the villages\nthrough which they had passed. Here again they might have been compelled\nto an act which would have called attention to their lawless character,\nfor they had no money, had it not been for Cherry. He financed the party\nfrom the lining of his waistcoat (Malcolm remembered that the little man\nhad never discarded this garment, sleeping or waking) and made a casual\nreference to the diamonds which had gone to his account via a\nsoi-disant princess and the favourite of a Commissary.\n\n\"Anyway,\" he said, \"we could have got it from the chauffeur--he's open\nto reason.\"\n\nThey did not ask him what argument he would have employed, but were glad\nsubsequently that these arguments had not been used.\n\nWhat was as necessary as food was petrol. Peter the chauffeur said that\nthere were big army supplies in Preopojensky itself, and undertook to\nsteal sufficient to keep the car running for a week.\n\nThey waited until it was dark before they left the cover of the wood,\nand walked in single file along a cart-track to the half a dozen\nblinking lights that stood for Preopojensky.\n\nThe car they had pulled into deeper cover, marking the place with a\nsplinter of mirror broken from its silver frame.\n\n\"Nothing like a mirror,\" explained Cherry Bim. \"You've only to strike a\nmatch, and it shows a light for you.\"\n\nThe way was a long one, but presently they came to a good road which\ncrossed the track at right angles, but which curved round until it ran\nparallel with the path they had followed.\n\n\"There is the military store,\" whispered the chauffeur. \"I will go now,\nmy little general.\"\n\n\"I trust you, _drushka_,\" said Malinkoff.\n\n\"By the head of my mother I will not betray you,\" said the man, and\ndisappeared in the darkness.\n\nAfter this they held a council of war.\n\n\"So far as I can remember, Petroff is the silk merchant,\" said\nMalinkoff, \"and his house is the first big residence we reach coming\nfrom this direction. I remember it because I was on duty at the\nCoronation of the Emperor, and his Imperial Majesty came to\nPreopojensky, which is a sacred place for the Royal House. Peter the\nGreat lived here.\"\n\nLuck was with them, for they had not gone far before they heard a voice\nbellowing a mournful song, and came up with its owner, a worker in the\nsilk mills (they had long since ceased to work) who was under the\ninfluence of methylated spirit--a favourite tipple since vodka had been\nukased out of existence.\n\n\"Ivan Petroff, son of Ivan?\" he hiccoughed.\n\n\"Yes, my little dove, it is there. He is a boorjoo and an aristocrat,\nand there is no Czar and no God!--_prikanzerio_--it is ordered by the\nSoviet!...\"\n\nAnd he began to weep\n\n\"No Czar and no God! Long live the Revolution! Evivo! No blessed saints\nand no Czar! And I was of the Rasholnik!...\"\n\nThey left him weeping by the roadside.\n\n\"The Rasholniks are the dissenters of Russia--this village was a hotbed\nof them, but they've gone the way of the rest,\" said Malinkoff sadly.\n\nThe house they approached was a big wooden structure ornamented with\nperfectly useless cupolas and domes, so that Malcolm thought at first\nthat this was one of the innumerable churches in which the village\nabounded.\n\nThere was a broad flight of wooden stairs leading to the door, but this\nthey avoided. A handful of gravel at a likely-looking upper window\nseemed a solution. The response was immediate. Though no light appeared,\nthe window swung open and a voice asked softly:\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"We are from Irene,\" answered Malcolm in the same tone.\n\nThe window closed, and presently they heard a door unfastened and\nfollowed the sound along the path which ran close to the house. It was a\nsmall side door that was opened, and Malcolm led the way through.\n\nTheir invisible host closed the door behind them, and they heard the\nclink of a chain.\n\n\"If you have not been here before, keep straight on, touching the wall\nwith your right hand. Where it stops turn sharply to the right,\" said\nthe unknown rapidly.\n\nThey followed his directions, and found the branch passage.\n\n\"Wait,\" said the voice.\n\nThe man passed them. They heard him turn a handle.\n\n\"Straight ahead you will find the door.\"\n\nThey obeyed, and their conductor struck a match and lit an oil lamp.\nThey were in the long room--they guessed that by the glow of the closed\nstove they had seen as they entered.\n\nThe windows were heavily shuttered and curtained, and even the door was\nhidden under a thick porti\u00e8re. The man who had brought them in was\nmiddle-aged and poorly dressed, but then this was a time when everybody\nin Russia was poorly dressed, and his shabbiness did not preclude the\npossibility of his being the proprietor of the house, as indeed he was.\n\nHe was eyeing them with suspicion, not wholly unjustified, for the\npatent respectability of Cherry's Derby hat was no compensation for the\narmoury belted about his rotund middle.\n\nBut when the man's eyes fell upon Malinkoff, his whole demeanour\nchanged, and he advanced with outstretched hand.\n\n\"General Malinkoff,\" he said, \"you remember me; I entertained you\nat----\"\n\n\"At Kieff! Of course!\" smiled Malinkoff. \"I did not know the Ivan\nPetroff of Moscow was the Ivan of the Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, what is your wish?\" asked the man, and Malinkoff\nexplained the object of the visit.\n\nPetroff looked serious.\n\n\"Of course, I will do anything her Highness wishes,\" he said. \"I saw her\nyesterday, and she told me that she had a dear friend in St. Basil.\"\nMalcolm tried to look unconcerned under Malinkoff's swift scrutiny and\nfailed. \"But I think she wished you to meet another--guest.\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"He has gone into Moscow to-night against my wishes,\" he said with\ntrouble in his face; \"such an old man----\"\n\n\"Kensky?\" said Malcolm quickly.\n\n\"Kensky.\" The tone was short. \"I told him that no good would come of\nit--her Highness was married to-night.\"\n\nMalcolm took a step forward, but it was an unsteady step.\n\n\"Married?\" he repeated. \"To whom was she married?\"\n\nPetroff looked down at the floor as though he dare not meet the eye of\nany man and say so monstrous a thing.\n\n\"To the servant Boolba,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE RED BRIDE\n\n\nIrene Yaroslav came back to the home which had always been associated in\nher mind with unhappy memories, to meet the culminating disaster which\nFate had wrought. Whatever thoughts of escape she may have treasured in\nsecret were cut into by the sure knowledge that she was watched day and\nnight, and were now finally terminated by the discovery that the big\napartment house, a suite of which Boolba had taken for her disposal when\nhe had ousted her from her father's house, was practically in possession\nof the Soviet Guard.\n\nShe drove to the palace with an undisguised escort of mounted men, one\non either side of the carriage, one before and one behind, and went up\nthe stairs--those grim stairs which had frightened her as a child and\nhad filled her nights with dreams, passing on her way the now empty\nbureau which it had been Boolba's whim for her to keep.\n\nMaria Badisikaya, an officer of the Committee for the Suppression of\nthe Counter-Revolution, formerly an operative in the Moscow Cigarette\nCompany, was waiting in the small drawing-room which still retained some\nof its ancient splendour. Maria was a short, stumpy woman with a slight\nmoustache and a wart on her chin, and was dressed in green satin, cut\nlow to disclose her generous figure. About her stiff, coal-black hair\nwas a heavy diamond bandeau. She was sitting on a settee, her feet\nhardly touching the ground, cleaning her nails with a little\npocket-knife as the girl entered. Evidently this was her maid of honour,\nand she could have laughed.\n\nThe woman glowered up at her and jumped briskly to her feet, closing the\nknife and slipping it into her corsage.\n\n\"You are late, Irene Yaroslav,\" she said shrilly. \"I have something\nbetter to do than to sit here waiting for a boorjoo. There is a\ncommittee meeting at ten o'clock to-night. How do you imagine I can\nattend that? Come, come!\"\n\nShe bustled into an ante-room.\n\n\"Here is your dress, my little bride. See, there is everything, even to\nstockings--Boolba has thought of all, yet he will not see! La! la! What\na man!\"\n\nNumerous articles of attire were laid out on chairs and on the back of\nthe sofa, and the girl, looking at them, shuddered. It was Boolba's\nidea--nobody but Boolba would have thought of it. Every garment was of\nred, blood red, a red which seemed to fill the room with harsh sound.\nStockings of finest silk, shoes of russian leather, cobweb\nunderwear--but all of the same hideous hue. In Russia the word \"red\" is\nalso the word \"beautiful.\" In a language in which so many delicate\nshades of meaning can be expressed, this word serves a double purpose,\ndoing duty for that which, in the eyes of civilized people, is garish,\nand that which is almost divine.\n\nMaria's manner changed suddenly. From the impatient, slightly pompous\nofficial, conscious of her position, she became obsequious and even\naffectionate. Possibly she remembered that the girl was to become the\nwife of the most powerful man in Moscow, whose word was amply sufficient\nto send even Gregory Prodol to the execution yard, and Gregory's\nposition seemed unassailable.\n\n\"I will help you to dress, my little dear,\" she said. \"Let me take your\nhat, my little dove.\"\n\n\"I would rather be alone,\" said the girl. \"Will you please wait in the\nnext room, Maria Badisikaya?\"\n\n\"But I can help you so, my little darling,\" said the woman, fussing\nabout. \"A bride has no luck for thirty years if she puts on her own\nstockings.\"\n\n\"Go!\" said the girl imperiously, and the woman cringed.\n\n\"Certainly, Excellenz,\" she stammered, and went out without another\nword.\n\nThe girl changed quickly, and surveyed herself in the pier glass at the\nend of the room. It was striking but horrible. There came a tap at the\ndoor and the agitated Maria entered.\n\n\"He has sent for you, my little dove,\" she said. \"Come, take my arm. Do\nnot tremble, my little pretty. Boolba is a good man and the greatest man\nin Moscow.\"\n\nShe would have taken the girl's arm, but Irene waved her aside, and\nwalked swiftly from the drawing-room into the grand saloon. She wanted\nthe ordeal over as soon as possible.\n\nThe room was crowded, and though many of the electric lamps in the great\nglass chandelier were not in working order and a broken fuse had put\nhalf the wall brackets in darkness, the light was almost dazzling. This\nwonderful saloon, where ten Czars had eaten bread and salt with ten\ngenerations of Yaroslavs, was thick with humanity. Some of the men were\nin uniform, some were in a nondescript costume which was the Soviet\ncompromise between evening-dress and diplomatic uniform. One man wore a\ncorrect evening-jacket and a white waistcoat with a perfectly starched\nshirt, over uniform trousers and top-boots. The women were as weirdly\nclothed. Some were shabby to the point of rags, a few wore court dresses\nof the approved pattern, and there was one woman dressed like a man, who\nsmoked all the time. The air was blue with tobacco smoke and buzzing\nwith sound.\n\nAs she came into the saloon somebody shouted her name, and there was\nvigorous applause, not for her, she knew, nor for the name she bore, but\nfor the novelty and the \"beauty\" of her wedding gown.\n\nAt the farther end of the room was a table covered with a red cloth, and\nbehind it sat a man in evening-dress, whom she recognized as one of the\nnewly-appointed magistrates of the city. Nudged behind by Maria, she\nmade her way through the press of people, whose admiring comments were\nspoken loud enough for her to hear.\n\n\"What a little beauty! Too good for a blind man, eh?\"\n\n\"We have knelt for her many times, now she shall kneel for us.\"\n\n\"Such a dress! This Boolba is a wonderful fellow.\"\n\nShe halted before the table, her hands clasped lightly in front of her.\nHer head was high, and she met every glance steadily and disdainfully.\n\nThe clock struck a quarter after ten when Boolba made his entrance\namidst a storm of applause.\n\nThey had never seen him in such a uniform before. Some thought it was a\nnew costume which had been sanctioned by the supreme Soviet for its\nCommissaries; others that it had been planned especially for the\nmarriage. Irene alone knew it, and a cold, disdainful smile lit for a\nmoment her expressionless face.\n\nShe had seen Boolba in knee-breeches and white silk stockings before;\nshe knew the coat of green and gold which the retainers of the house of\nYaroslav wore on state occasions. Boolba was marrying her in his\nbutler's livery--a delicate piece of vengeance.\n\nThe ceremony was short, and, to the girl, unreal. Religious marriages,\nthough they had not altogether been banned, were regarded by the\nofficial Russia as unnecessary, and a new marriage service had been\ndesigned, which confined the ceremony to the space of a few minutes. The\nattempts to abolish marriage altogether had been strenuously opposed,\nnot so much by the public women who were on the innumerable councils and\ncommittees, but by the wives of the more important members of the\norganization.\n\nBoolba was led to her side, and reached out his hand gropingly, and in\nvery pity of his blindness she took it. Questions were asked him, to\nwhich he responded and similar questions were asked her, to which she\nmade no reply. The whole ceremony was a farce, and she had agreed to it\nonly because it gave her a little extra time, and every minute counted.\nFrom the moment the magistrate pronounced the formula which made them,\nin the eyes of the Soviet law at any rate, man and wife, Boolba never\nloosened his hold of her.\n\nHe held her hand in his own big, hot palm, until it was wet and her\nfingers lost all feeling. From group to group they moved, and when they\ncrossed the dancing space of the saloon, the revellers stepped aside to\nallow the man to pass. She noticed that in the main they confined\nthemselves to country dances, some of which were new to her. And all the\ntime Boolba kept up a continuous conversation in an undertone, pinching\nher hand gently whenever he wanted to attract her attention.\n\n\"Tell me, my new eyes, my little pigeon of God, what are they doing now?\nDo you see Mishka Gurki? She is a silly woman. Tell me, my little pet,\nif you see her. Watch her well, and tell me how she looks at me. That\nwoman is an enemy of the Revolution and a friend of Sophia Kensky....\nAh! it is sad about your poor friends.\"\n\nThe girl turned cold and clenched her teeth to take the news which was\ncoming.\n\n\"They tried to escape and they were shot down by our brave guard. I\nwould have pardoned them for your sake, all but the thief, who broke\nthe jaw of comrade Alex Alexandroff. Yes, I would have pardoned them\nto-night, because I am happy. Else they would have died with Sophia\nKensky in the morning.... Do I not please you, that I put away this\nwoman, who was my eyes and saw for me--all for your sake, my little\npigeon, all for your sake!... Do you see a big man with one eye? He has\nhalf my misfortune, yet he sees a million times more than Boolba! That\nis the butcher Kreml--some day he shall see the Kreml[A],\" he\nchuckled.... \"Why do you not speak, my darling little mama? Are you\nthinking of the days when I was Boolba the slave? Na, na, _stoi_! Think\nof to-day, to-night, my little child of Jesus!\"\n\nThere were times when she could have screamed, moments of madness when\nshe longed to pick up one of the champagne bottles which littered the\nfloor, and at intervals were thrown with a crash into a corner of the\nroom, and strike him across that great brutal face. There were times\nwhen she was physically sick and the room spun round and round and she\nwould have fallen but for the man's arm. But the hour she dreaded most\nof all came at last, when, one by one, with coarse jests at her\nexpense, the motley company melted away and left her alone with the\nman.\n\n\"They have all gone?\" he asked eagerly. \"Every one?\"\n\nHe clutched more tightly.\n\n\"To my room. We have a supper for ourselves. They are pigs, all these\nfellows, my little beautiful.\"\n\nThe old carpet was still on the stairs, she noticed dully. Up above used\nto be her own room, at the far end of the long passage. She had a piano\nthere once. She wondered whether it was still there. There used to be a\nservant at the head and at the foot of these stairs--a long,\ngreen-coated Cossack, to pass whom without authority was to court death.\nThe room on the left had been her father's--two big saloons, separated\nby heavy silken curtains; his bureau was at one end, his bedroom at the\nother.\n\nIt was into the bureau that the man groped his way. A table had been\nset, crowded with bottles and glasses, piled with fruit, sweetmeats, and\nat the end the inevitable samovar.\n\n\"I will lock the door,\" said Boolba. \"Now you shall kiss me on the eyes\nand on the mouth and on the cheeks, making the holy cross.\"\n\nShe braced herself for the effort, and wrenched free. In a flash he came\nat her, and his hands caught the silken gown at the shoulder. She\ntwisted under his arm, leaving a length of tattered and torn silk in\nhis hand, and the marks of his finger-nails upon her white shoulder. He\nstopped and laughed--a low, gurgling laugh--and it was to the girl like\nthe roar of some subterranean river heard from afar.\n\n\"Oh, Highness,\" he mocked, \"would you rob a blind man of his bride? Then\nlet us be blind together!\"\n\nHe blundered to the door. There was a click, and the room was in\ndarkness.\n\n\"I am better than you now,\" he said. \"I hear you in the dark; I can\nalmost see you. You are by the corner of the table. Now you are pushing\na chair. Little pigeon, come to me!\"\n\nWhilst he was talking she was safe because she could locate him. It was\nwhen he was silent that she was filled with wild fear. He moved as\nsoftly as a cat, and it seemed that his boast of seeing in the dark was\nalmost justified. Once his hand brushed her and she shrank back only\njust in time. The man was breathing heavily now, and the old, mocking\nterms of endearment had changed.\n\n\"Come to me, Irene Yaroslav!\" he roared. \"Have I not often run to you?\nHave I not waited throughout the night to take your wraps and bring you\ncoffee? Now you shall wait on me by Inokente! You shall be eyes and\nhands for me, and when I am tired of you, you shall go the way of Sophia\nKensky.\"\n\nShe was edging her way to the door. Once she could switch on the light\nshe was safe, at any rate for the time being. There was a long silence,\nand, try as she did, she could not locate him. He must have been\ncrouching near the door, anticipating her move, for as her hand fell on\nthe switch and the lights sprang into being, he leapt at her. She saw\nhim, but too late to avoid his whirling hands. In a second he had her in\nhis arms. The man was half mad. He cursed and blessed her alternately,\ncalled her his little pigeon and his little devil in the same breath.\nShe felt the tickle of his beard against her bare shoulder, and strove\nto push him off.\n\n\"Come, my little peach,\" he said. \"Who shall say that there is no\njustice in Russia, when Yaroslav's daughter is the bride of Boolba!\"\n\nHis back was to the curtain, and he was half lifting, half drawing her\nto the two grey strips which marked its division, when the girl\nscreamed.\n\n\"Again, again, my little dear,\" grinned Boolba. \"That is fine music.\"\n\nBut it was not her own danger which had provoked the cry. It was that\nvision, twice seen in her lifetime, of dead white hands, blue-veined,\ncoming from the curtain and holding this time a scarlet cord.\n\nIt was about Boolba's neck before he realized what had happened. With a\nstrangled cry he released the girl, and she fell back again on the\ntable, overturning it with a crash.\n\n\"This way, Highness,\" said a hollow voice, and she darted through the\ncurtains.\n\nShe heard the shock of Boolba's body as it fell to the ground, and then\nIsrael Kensky darted past her, flung open the door and pushed her\nthrough.\n\n\"The servants' way,\" he said, and she ran to the narrow staircase which\nled below to the kitchen, and above to the attics in which the servants\nslept.\n\nDown the stairs, two at a time, she raced, the old man behind her. The\nstairway ended in a square hall. There was a door, half ajar, leading to\nthe kitchen, which was filled with merrymakers, and a second door\nleading into the street, and this was also open. She knew the way\nblindfolded. They were in what had been the coach-yard of the Palace,\nand she knew there were half a dozen ways into the street. Israel chose\nthe most unlikely, one which led again to the front of the house.\n\nA drosky was waiting, and into this he bundled her, jumping in by her\nside, holding her about the waist as the driver whipped up his two\nhorses and sped through the deserted streets of Moscow.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[A] \"Kreml\" is literally Kremlin, one of the places of\ndetention in Moscow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE BOOK OF ALL-POWER\n\n\nMalcolm was the first to hear the sound of wheels on the roadway, and\nthe party listened in silence till a low whistle sounded and their host\ndarted out of the room.\n\n\"What was that?\" asked Malinkoff. \"Somebody has come to the front door.\"\n\nA few minutes later Petroff staggered through the doorway, carrying the\nlimp figure of Irene. It was Malcolm who took the girl in his arms and\nlaid her upon the sofa.\n\n\"She is not dead,\" said a voice behind him.\n\nHe looked up; it was Israel Kensky. The old man looked white and ill. He\ntook the glass of wine which Ivan brought him with a shaking hand, and\nwiped his beard as he looked down at the girl. There was neither\nfriendliness nor pity in his glance, only the curious tranquillity which\ncomes to the face of a man who has done that which he set out to do.\n\n\"What of Boolba?\" asked Petroff eagerly\n\n\"I think he lives,\" said Kensky, and shook his head. \"I am too weak and\ntoo old a man to have killed him. I put the cord about his neck and\ntwisted it with a stick. If he can loosen the cord he will live; if he\ncannot, he will die. But I think he was too strong a man to die.\"\n\n\"Did he know it was you?\" asked Petroff.\n\nKensky shook his head.\n\n\"What is the hour?\" he asked, and they told him that it was two o'clock.\n\n\"Sophia Kensky dies at four,\" he said, in such a tone of unconcern that\neven Malinkoff stared at him.\n\n\"It is right that she should die,\" said Kensky, and they marvelled that\nhe, who had risked his life to save one of the class which had\npersecuted his people for hundreds of years, should speak in so\nmatter-of-fact tones about the fate of his own blood. \"She betrayed her\nrace and her father. It is the old law of Israel, and it is a good law.\nI am going to sleep.\"\n\n\"Is there a chance that you have been followed?\" asked Malinkoff, and\nKensky pulled at his beard thoughtfully.\n\n\"I passed a watchman at the barricade, and he was awake--that is the\nonly danger.\"\n\nHe beckoned to Malcolm, and, loth as the young man was to leave the\ngirl's side, now that she was showing some signs of recovering\nconsciousness, he accompanied the old man from the room.\n\n\"_Gospodar_,\" said Israel Kensky (it sounded strange to hear that old\ntitle), \"once you carried a book for me.\"\n\n\"I remember.\" Malcolm smiled in spite of himself.\n\n\"'The Book of All-Power,'\" repeated the Jew quietly. \"It is in my room,\nand I shall ask you to repeat your service. That book I would give to\nthe Grand Duchess, for I have neither kith nor child, and she has been\nkind to me.\"\n\n\"But surely, Kensky,\" protested Malcolm, \"you, as an intelligent man, do\nnot believe in the potency of books or charms of incantations?\"\n\n\"I believe in the 'Book of All-Power,'\" said Kensky calmly. \"Remember,\nit is to become the property of the Grand Duchess Irene. I do not think\nI have long to live,\" he added. \"How my death will come I cannot tell,\nbut it is not far off. Will you go with me now and take the book?\"\n\nMalcolm hesitated. He wanted to get back to the girl, but it would have\nbeen an ungracious act not to humour the old man, who had risked so much\nfor the woman he loved. He climbed the stairs to the little bedroom, and\nwaited at the door whilst Kensky went in. Presently the old man\nreturned; the book was now stitched in a canvas wrapping, and Malcolm\nslipped the book into his pocket. The very act recalled another scene\nwhich had been acted a thousand miles away, and, it seemed, a million\nyears ago.\n\n\"Now let us go down,\" said Kensky.\n\n\"Lord,\" he asked, as Malcolm's foot was on the stair, \"do you love this\nyoung woman?\"\n\nIt would have been the sheerest affectation on his part to have evaded\nthe question.\n\n\"Yes, Israel Kensky,\" he replied, \"I love her,\" and the old man bowed\nhis head.\n\n\"You are two Gentiles, and there is less difference in rank than in\nrace,\" he said. \"I think you will be happy. May the Gods of Jacob and of\nAbraham and of David rest upon you and prosper you. Amen!\"\n\nNever had benediction been pronounced upon him that felt so real, or\nthat brought such surprising comfort to the soul of Malcolm Hay. He felt\nas if, in that dingy stairway, he had received the very guerdon of\nmanhood, and he went downstairs spiritually strengthened, and every\ndoubt in his mind set at rest.\n\nThe girl half rose from the couch as he came to her, and in her queer,\nimpulsive way put out both her hands. Five minutes before he might have\nhesitated; he might have been content to feel the warmth of her palms\nupon his. But now he knelt down by her side, and, slipping one arm about\nher, drew her head to his shoulder. He heard the long-drawn sigh of\nhappiness, he felt her arm creep about his neck, and he forgot the world\nand all the evil and menace it held: he forgot the grave Malinkoff, the\ninterested Cherry Bim, still wearing his Derby hat on the back of his\nhead, and girt about with the weapons of his profession. He forgot\neverything except that the world was worth living for. There lay in his\narms a fragrant and a beautiful thing.\n\nIt was Petroff who put an end to the little scene.\n\n\"I have sent food into the wood for you,\" he said, \"and my man has come\nback to tell me that your chauffeur is waiting by the car. He has all\nthe petrol that he requires, and I do not think you should delay too\nlong.\"\n\nThe girl struggled to a sitting position, and looked with dismay at her\nscarlet bridal dress.\n\n\"I cannot go like this,\" she said.\n\n\"I have your trunk in the house, Highness,\" said Petroff, and the girl\njumped up with a little cry of joy.\n\n\"I had forgotten that,\" she said.\n\nShe had forgotten also that she was still weak, for she swayed and would\nhave stumbled, had not Malcolm caught her.\n\n\"Go quickly, Highness,\" said Petroff urgently. \"I do not think it would\nbe safe to stay here--safe for you or for Kensky. I have sent one of my\nmen on a bicycle to watch the Moscow road.\"\n\n\"Is that necessary?\" asked Malinkoff. \"Are you suspect?\"\n\nPetroff nodded.\n\n\"If Boolba learns that Kensky passed this way, he will guess that it is\nto me that he came. I was in the service of the Grand Duke, and if it\nwere not for the fact that a former workman of mine is now Assistant\nMinister of Justice in Petrograd, I should have been arrested long ago.\nIf Boolba finds Israel Kensky here, or the Grand Duchess, nothing can\nsave me. My only hope is to get you away before there is a search.\nUnderstand, little general,\" he said earnestly, \"if you had not the car,\nI would take all risks and let you stay until you were found.\"\n\n\"That seems unnecessary,\" said Malinkoff. \"I quite agree. What do you\nsay, Kensky?\"\n\nThe old man, who had followed Malcolm down the stairs, nodded.\n\n\"I should have shot Boolba,\" he said thoughtfully, \"but it would have\nmade too much noise.\"\n\n\"You should have used the knife, little father,\" said Petroff, but\nKensky shook his head.\n\n\"He wears chain armour under his clothes,\" he said. \"All the\ncommissaries do.\"\n\nPreparations for the journey were hurriedly made. The girl's trunk had\nproved a veritable storehouse, and she came down in a short tweed skirt\nand coat, her glorious hair hidden under a black tam o' shanter, and\nMalcolm could scarcely take his eyes from her.\n\n\"You have a coat,\" said the practical Malinkoff. \"That is good--you may\nneed it.\"\n\nCrash!\n\nIt was the sound of a rifle butt against the door which struck them\ndumb. Muffled by the thick wood, the voice of the knocker yet came\nclearly: \"Open in the name of the Revolution!\"\n\nPetroff blinked twice, and on his face was a look as though he could not\nbelieve his ears. The girl shrank to Malcolm's side, and Malinkoff\nstroked his beard softly. Only Cherry Bim seemed to realize the\nnecessities of the moment, and he pulled both guns simultaneously and\nlaid them noiselessly on the table before him.\n\n\"Open in the name of the Revolution!\"\n\nA hiss from Kensky brought them round. He beckoned them through the door\nby which they had made their original entry to the room, and pointed to\nthe light. He gripped Petroff by the shoulder.\n\n\"Upstairs to your bedroom, friend,\" he said. \"Put on your night-shirt\nand talk to them through the window.\"\n\nDown the two passages they passed and came to the little door, which\nKensky unchained and opened. He put his lips close to Malinkoff's ears.\n\n\"Do you remember the way you came?\" he asked, and the general nodded and\nled the way.\n\nLast but one came Cherry Bim, a '45 in each hand. There were no soldiers\nin view at the back of the house, but Malinkoff could hear their feet on\nsome unknown outside road, and realized that the house was in process of\nbeing surrounded, and had the man who knocked at the door waited until\nthis encirclement had been completed, there would have been no chance of\nescape.\n\nThey struck the main road, and found the cart track leading to the wood,\nand none challenged them. There was no sound from the house, and\napparently their flight had not been discovered.\n\nKensky brought up the rear in spite of Cherry's frenzied injunctions,\ndelivered in the four words of Russian which he knew, to get a move on.\nThey had reached the fringe of the wood when the challenge came. Out of\nthe shadow rode a horseman, and brought his charger across the path.\n\n\"Halt!\" he cried.\n\nThe party halted, all except Cherry, who stepped from the path and\nmoved swiftly forward, crouching low, to give the sentry no background.\n\n\"Who is that?\" asked the man on the horse. \"Speak, or I'll fire!\"\n\nHe had unslung his carbine, and they heard the click of the bolt as the\nbreech opened and closed.\n\n\"We are friends, little father,\" said Malinkoff.\n\n\"Give me your names,\" said the sentry, and Malinkoff recited with glib\nease a list of Russian patronymics.\n\n\"That is a lie,\" said the man calmly. \"You are boorjoos--I can tell by\nyour voices,\" and without further warning he fired into the thick of\nthem.\n\nThe second shot which came from the night followed so quickly upon the\nfirst that for the second time in like circumstances the girl thought\nonly one had been fired. But the soldier on the horse swayed and slid to\nthe earth before she knew what had happened.\n\n\"Go right ahead,\" said the voice of Cherry Bim.\n\nHe had caught the bridle of the frightened horse, and had drawn him\naside. They quickened their steps and came up to the car, which the\nthoughtful chauffeur had already cranked up at the sound of the shots.\n\n\"Where is Kensky?\" asked Malcolm suddenly, \"did you see him, Cherry?\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Why, no,\" said Cherry, \"I didn't see him after the lamented tragedy.\"\n\n\"We can't leave the old man,\" said Malcolm.\n\n\"Wait,\" said the little gun-man. \"I will go back and look for him.\"\n\nFive minutes, ten passed and still there was no sign or sound of Israel\nKensky or of Cherry. Then a shot broke the stillness of the night, and\nanother and another.\n\n\"Two rifles and one revolver,\" said Malinkoff. \"Get into the car,\nHighness. Are you ready, Peter?\"\n\nThere was another shot and then a fusillade. Then came slow footsteps\nalong the cart track, and the sound of a man's windy breathing.\n\n\"Take him, somebody,\" said Cherry.\n\nMalinkoff lifted the inanimate figure from Cherry's shoulder and carried\nhim into the car. A voice from the darkness shouted a command, there was\na flash of fire and the \"zip\" of a bullet.\n\n\"Let her go, Percy,\" said Cherry, and blazed away with both guns into\nthe darkness.\n\nHe leapt for the footboard and made it by a miracle, and only once did\nthey hear him cry as if in pain.\n\n\"Are you hit?\" asked Malcolm anxiously.\n\n\"Naw!\" drawled his voice jerkily, for the road hereabouts was full of\nholes, and even speech was as impossible as even riding. \"Naw,\" he\nsaid. \"I nearly lost my hat.\"\n\nHe spoke only once again that night, except to refuse the offer to ride\ninside the car. He preferred the footboard, he said, and explained that\nas a youth it had been his ambition to be a fireman.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he said suddenly, breaking the silence of nearly an hour.\n\n\"What do you wonder?\" asked Malinkoff, who sat nearest to the window,\nwhere Cherry stood.\n\n\"I wonder what happened to that boy on the bicycle?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nON THE ROAD\n\n\nIsrael Kensky died at five o'clock in the morning. They had made a rough\nattempt to dress the wound in his shoulder, but, had they been the most\nskilful of surgeons with the best appliances which modern surgery had\ninvented at their hands, they could not have saved his life. He died\nliterally in the arms of Irene, and they buried him in a little forest\non the edge of a sluggish stream, and Cherry Bim unconsciously delivered\nthe funeral oration.\n\n\"This poor old guy was a good fellow,\" he said. \"I ain't got nothing on\nthe Jews as a class, except their habit of prosperity, and that just\ngets the goat of people like me, who hate working for a living. He was\nstraight and white, and that's all you can expect any man to be, or any\nwoman either, with due respect to you, miss. If any of you gents would\ncare to utter a few words of prayer, you'll get a patient hearing from\nme, because I am naturally a broad-minded man.\"\n\nIt was the girl who knelt by the grave, the tears streaming down her\ncheeks, but what she said none heard. Cherry Bim, holding his hat crown\noutward across his breast, produced the kind of face which he thought\nadequate to the occasion; and, after the party had left the spot, he\nstayed behind. He rejoined them after a few minutes, and he was putting\naway his pocket-knife as he ran.\n\n\"Sorry to keep you, ladies and gents,\" he said, \"but I am a sentimental\nman in certain matters. I always have been and always shall be.\"\n\n\"What were you doing?\" asked Malcolm, as the car bumped along.\n\nCherry Bim cleared his throat and seemed embarrassed.\n\n\"Well, to tell you the truth,\" he said. \"I made a little cross and stuck\nit over his head.\"\n\n\"But----\" began Malcolm, and the girl's hand closed his mouth.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Bim,\" she said. \"It was very, very kind of you.\"\n\n\"Nothing wrong, I hope?\" asked Cherry in alarm.\n\n\"Nothing wrong at all,\" said the girl gently.\n\nThat cross over the grave of the Jew was to give them a day's respite.\nIsrael Kensky had left behind him in the place where he fell a fur hat\nbearing his name. From the quantity of blood which the pursuers found,\nthey knew that he must have been mortally wounded, and it was for a\ngrave by the wayside that the pursuing party searched and found. It was\nthe cross at his head which deceived them and led them to take the ford\nand try along the main road to the south of the river, on the banks of\nwhich Kensky slept his last dreamless sleep.\n\nThe danger for the fugitives was evident.\n\n\"The most we can hope,\" said Malinkoff, \"is to escape detection for two\ndays, after which we must abandon the car.\"\n\n\"Which way do you suggest?\" asked Malcolm.\n\n\"Poland or the Ukraine,\" replied the general quickly. \"The law of the\nMoscow Soviet does not run in Little Russia or in Poland. We may get to\nOdessa, but obviously we cannot go much farther like this. I have--or\nhad,\" he corrected himself, \"an estate about seventy versts from here,\nand I think I can still depend upon some of my people--if there are any\nleft alive. The car we must get rid of, but that, I think, will be a\nsimple matter.\"\n\nThey were now crossing a wide plain, which reminded Malcolm irresistibly\nof the steppes of the Ukraine, and apparently had recalled the same\nscene to Irene and Malinkoff. There was the same sweep of grass-land,\nthe same riot of flowers; genista, cornflour and clover dabbled the\ngreen, and dwarf oaks and poverty-stricken birches stood in lonely\npatches.\n\n\"Here is a Russia which the plough has never touched,\" said Malinkoff.\n\"Does it not seem to you amazing that the Americans and British who go\nforth to seek new colonies, should lure our simple people to foreign\ncountries, where the mode of living, the atmosphere, is altogether\ndifferent from this, when here at their doors is a new land undiscovered\nand unexploited?\"\n\nHe broke off his homily to look out of the window of the car. He had\ndone that at least a dozen times in the past half-hour.\n\n\"We're going fairly fast,\" said Malcolm. \"You do not think anything will\novertake us?\"\n\n\"On the road--no,\" said Malinkoff, \"but I am rather nervous crossing\nthis plain, where there is practically no cover at all, and the car is\nraising clouds of dust.\"\n\n\"Nervous of what?\"\n\n\"Aeroplanes,\" said Malinkoff. \"Look, there is a pleasant little wood. I\nsuggest that we get under cover until night falls. The next village is\nTruboisk, which is a large market centre and is certain to hold local\nofficers of the Moscow Soviet.\"\n\nBoth his apprehensions and his judgment were justified, for scarcely\nhad the car crept into the cover of green boughs, than a big aeroplane\nwas sighted. It was following the road and at hardly a hundred feet\nabove them. It passed with a roar. They watched it until it was a speck\nin the sky.\n\n\"They are taking a lot of trouble for a very little thing. Russia must\nbe law-abiding if they turn their aeroplanes loose on a party of\nfugitive criminals!\"\n\n\"Boolba has told his story,\" said Malinkoff significantly. \"By this time\nyou are not only enemies of the Revolution, but you are accredited\nagents of capitalistic Governments. You have been sent here by your\nPresident to stir up the bourgeois to cast down the Government, because\nof British investments. Mr. Bim will be described as a secret service\nagent who has been employed to assassinate either Trotsky or Lenin. If\nyou could only tap the official wireless,\" said Malinkoff, \"you would\nlearn that a serious counter-revolutionary plot has been discovered, and\nthat American financiers are deeply involved. Unless, of course,\"\ncorrected Malinkoff, \"America happens to be in favour in Petrograd, in\nwhich case it will be English financiers.\"\n\nMalcolm laughed.\n\n\"Then we are an international incident?\" he said.\n\n\"You are an 'international incident,'\" agreed Malinkoff gravely.\n\nCherry Bim, sitting on the step, smoking a long cigar, a box of which\nPetroff had given him as a parting present--looked up, blowing out a\nblue cloud.\n\n\"A secret service agent?\" he said. \"That's a sort of fly cop, isn't it?\"\n\n\"That's about it, Cherry,\" replied Malcolm.\n\n\"And do you think they'll call me a fly cop?\" said the interested\nCherry.\n\nMalinkoff nodded, and the gun-man chewed on his cigar.\n\n\"Time brings its revenges, don't it?\" he said. \"Never, oh never, did I\nthink that I should be took for a fellow from the Central Office! It\nonly shows you that if a guy continues on the broad path that leadeth to\ndestruction, and only goes enough, he'll find Mrs. Nemesis--I think\nthat's the name of the dame.\"\n\nMalinkoff strolled to the edge of the wood and came back hurriedly.\n\n\"The aeroplane is returning,\" he said, \"and is accompanied by another.\"\n\nThis time neither machine took the direct route. They were sweeping the\ncountry methodically from side to side, and Malinkoff particularly\nnoticed that they circled about a smaller wood two miles away and seemed\nloth to leave it.\n\n\"What colour is the top of this car?\" he asked, and Bim climbed up.\n\n\"White,\" he said. \"Is there time to put on a little of this 'camelflage'\nI've heard so much about?\"\n\nThe party set to work in haste to tear down small branches of trees and\nscraps of bushes, and heap them on to the top of the car. Cherry Bim,\nwho had the instinct of deception, superintending the actual masking of\nthe roof, and as the sun was now setting detected a new danger.\n\n\"Let all the windows down,\" said Cherry. \"Put a coat over the glass\nscreen and sit on anything that shines.\"\n\nThey heard the roar of the aeroplane coming nearer and crouched against\nthe trunk of a tree. Suddenly there was a deafening explosion which\nstunned the girl and threw her against Malcolm. She half-rose to run but\nhe pulled her down.\n\n\"What was it?\" she whispered.\n\n\"A small bomb,\" said Malcolm. \"It is an old trick of airmen when they\nare searching woods for concealed bodies of infantry. Somebody is bound\nto run out and give the others away.\"\n\nCherry Bim, fondling his long Colt, was looking glumly at the cloud of\nsmoke which was billowing forth from the place where the bomb had\ndropped. Round and round circled the aeroplane, but presently, as if\nsatisfied with its scrutiny, it made off, and the drone of the engine\ngrew fainter and fainter.\n\n\"War's hell,\" said Cherry, wiping his pallid face with a hand that\nshook.\n\n\"I can't quite understand it,\" said Malinkoff. \"Even supposing that\nBoolba has told his story, there seems to be a special reason for this\nurgent search. They would, of course, have communicated----\"\n\nHe fell silent.\n\n\"Has Boolba any special reasons, other than those we know?\" he asked.\n\nMalcolm remembered the \"Book of All-Power\" and nodded.\n\n\"Have you something of Kensky's?\" asked Malinkoff quickly. \"Not that\ninfernal book?\"\n\nHe looked so anxious that Malcolm laughed.\n\n\"Yes, I have that infernal book. As a matter of fact, it is the infernal\nbook of the Grand Duchess now.\"\n\n\"Mine?\" she said in surprise.\n\n\"Kensky's last words to me were that this book should become your\nproperty,\" said Malcolm, and she shivered.\n\n\"All my life seems to have been associated with the search for that\ndreadful book,\" she said. \"I wonder if it is one of Kensky's own\nbinding. You know,\" she went on, \"that Israel Kensky bound books for a\nhobby? He bound six for me, and they were most beautifully decorated.\"\n\n\"He was a rich man, was he not?\" asked Malcolm.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"He was penniless when he died,\" she said quietly. \"Every store of his\nwas confiscated and his money was seized by order of the new Government.\nI once asked him definitely why he did not turn to his 'Book of\nAll-Power' for help. He told me the time had not yet come.\"\n\n\"May I see the book?\"\n\nMalcolm took the volume with its canvas cover from his pocket, and the\ngirl looked at it seriously.\n\n\"Do you know, I have half a mind to throw it into the fire?\" she said,\npointing to the smouldering wood where the bomb had fallen. \"There seems\nsomething sinister, something ominous about its possession that fills me\nwith terror.\"\n\nShe looked at it for a moment musingly, then handed it back to Malcolm.\n\n\"Poor Israel!\" she said softly, \"and poor Russia!\"\n\nThey waited until darkness fell before they moved on. Malinkoff had an\nidea that there was a crossroad before the town was reached, and\nprogress was slow in consequence, because he was afraid of passing it.\nHe was determined now not to go through the village, which lay directly\nahead. The fact that the aeroplane had been able to procure a recruit,\npointed to the existence of a camp of considerable dimensions in the\nneighbourhood and he was anxious to keep away from armed authority.\n\nIt was a tense hour they spent--tense for all except Cherry Bim, who had\nimprovised a cushion on the baggage carrier at the back of the car, and\nhad affixed himself so that he could doze without falling off. The side\nroad did not appear, and Malinkoff grew more and more apprehensive.\nThere were no lights ahead, as there should be if he were approaching\nthe village. Once he thought he saw dark figures crouching close to the\nground as the car passed, but put this down to nerves. Five hundred\nyards beyond, he discovered that his eyes had not deceived him. A red\nlight appeared in the centre of the road, and against the skyline--for\nthey were ascending a little incline at the moment--a number of dark\nfigures sprang into view.\n\nThe chauffeur brought the car to a halt with a jerk, only just in time,\nfor his lamps jarred against the pole which had been placed across the\nroad.\n\nMalcolm had drawn his revolver, but the odds were too heavy, besides\nwhich, in bringing his car to a standstill, the driver had shut off his\nengine and the last hope of bunking through had disappeared.\n\nA man carrying a red lamp came to the side of the car, and flashed the\nlight of a torch over the occupants.\n\n\"One, two, three, four,\" he counted. \"There should be five.\"\n\nHe peered at them separately.\n\n\"This is the aristocrat general, this is the American revolutionary,\nthis is the woman. There is also a criminal. Did any man jump out?\" he\nasked somebody in the darkness, and there was a chorus of \"No!\"\n\nFootsteps were coming along the road; the guard which had been waiting\nto close them in from the rear, was now coming up. The man with the\nlamp, who appeared to be an officer, made a circuit of the car and\ndiscovered the carrier seat, but its occupant had vanished.\n\n\"There was a man here, you fools,\" he shouted. \"Search the road; he\ncannot have gone far. Look!\"\n\nHe put the light on the road.\n\n\"There are his boots. You will find him amongst the bushes. Search\nquickly.\"\n\nMalcolm, at the girl's side, put his arm about her shoulder.\n\n\"You are not afraid?\" he said gently, and she shook her head.\n\n\"I do not think I shall ever be afraid again,\" she replied. \"I have\nfaith in God, my dear. Cherry has escaped?\" she asked.\n\n\"I think so,\" he replied in a guarded tone. \"He must have seen the\nsoldiers and jumped. They have just found his boots in the roadway.\"\n\nThe officer came back at that moment.\n\n\"You have weapons,\" he said. \"Give them to me.\"\n\nIt would have been madness to disobey the order, and Malcolm handed over\nhis revolver and Malinkoff followed suit. Not satisfied with this, the\nman turned them out in the road whilst he conducted a search.\n\n\"Get back,\" he said after this was over. \"You must go before the\nCommissary for judgment. The woman is required in Moscow, but we shall\ndeal summarily with the foreigner and Malinkoff, also the little thief,\nwhen we find him.\"\n\nHe addressed the chauffeur.\n\n\"I shall sit by your side, and if you do not carry out my instructions I\nshall shoot you through the head, little pigeon,\" he said. \"Get down and\nstart your machine.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE MONASTERY OF ST. BASIL THE LEPER\n\n\nHe gave an order to the soldiers, and the barrier was removed, then he\nstruck a match and lit a flare which burnt a dazzling red flame for half\na minute.\n\n\"A signal,\" said Malinkoff, \"probably to notify our capture.\"\n\nA few minutes later, with a soldier on either footboard, and the officer\nsitting beside the chauffeur, the car sped through the night, checking\nonly before it came to the cross-roads which Malinkoff had sought for.\nTurning to the left, the car swung into a road narrower and less\ncomfortable for the passengers.\n\n\"I wonder if they will catch our brave friend,\" said the girl.\n\n\"They will be sorry if they do,\" replied Malcolm dryly. \"Cherry will not\nbe caught as we were.\"\n\nAhead of them and to the right apparently, on a hill by their height, a\ndozen fires were burning, and Malinkoff judged that the camp they were\napproaching was one of considerable size. He guessed it was a\nconcentration camp where the Reds were preparing for their periodical\noffensive against the Ukraine. It must be somewhere in this district\nthat the Polish Commissioners were negotiating with the Supreme\nGovernment--an event which had set Moscow agog.\n\nAn eerie experience this, riding through the dark, the figures of the\nsoldier guards on either footboard gripping to the posts of the car.\nBump, bump, bump it went, swaying and jolting, and then one of the\nguards fell off. They expected him to jump on the footboard again, for\nthe auto was going at a slow pace, but to their surprise he did not\nreappear. Then a similar accident happened to the man on the other\nfootboard. He suddenly let go his hold and fell backwards.\n\n\"What on earth----\" said Malcolm.\n\n\"Look, look!\" whispered the girl.\n\nA foot and a leg had appeared opposite the window, and it came from the\nroof of the car. Then another foot, and the bulk of a body against the\nnight.\n\n\"It's Cherry!\" whispered the girl.\n\nSwiftly he passed the window and came to the side of the officer, whose\nhead was turned to the chauffeur.\n\n\"Russki,\" said Cherry, \"_stoi_!\"\n\n\"Stop!\" was one of the four Russian words he knew, and the chauffeur\nobeyed, just at the moment when the car came to where the road split\ninto two, one running to the right and apparently to the camp, the other\nand the older road dipping down to a misty valley.\n\nThe Red officer saw the gun under his nose and took intelligent action.\nHis two hands went up and his revolver fell with a clatter at the\nchauffeur's feet. Deftly Cherry relieved him of the remainder of his\narms.\n\nBy this time Malcolm was out of the car, and a brief council of war was\nheld.\n\nTo leave the man there would be to ask for trouble. To shoot him was\nrepugnant even to Cherry, who had constituted himself the official\nassassin of the party.\n\n\"We shall have to take him along,\" said Malinkoff. \"There are plenty of\nplaces where we can leave him in the night, and so long as he does not\nknow which way we go, I do not think he can do us any harm.\"\n\nThe Red officer took his misfortune with the philosophy which the\nchauffeur had displayed in similar circumstances.\n\n\"I have no malice, little general,\" he said. \"I carry out my orders as a\nsoldier should. For my part I would as soon cry 'Long live the Czar!'\nas 'Long live the Revolution!' If you are leaving Russia I shall be\nglad to go with you, and I may be of service because I know all the\nlatest plans for arresting you. There is a barrier on every road, even\non this which you are taking now, unless,\" he added thoughtfully, \"it is\nremoved for the Commissary Boolba.\"\n\n\"Is he coming this way?\" asked Malcolm.\n\n\"You saw me fire a flare,\" said the man. \"That was a signal to the camp\nthat you were captured. The news will be telegraphed to Moscow, and\nBoolba will come to sentence the men and take back his wife.\"\n\nHe evidently spoke in the terms of his instructions.\n\n\"What road will he take, little soldier?\" asked Malinkoff.\n\n\"The Tver road,\" said the man. \"It is the direct road from Moscow, and\nwe shall cross it very quickly. At the crossing are four soldiers and an\nunder officer, but no barricade. If you will direct me I will tell them\na lie and say that we go to meet Boolba.\"\n\n\"We're in his hands to some extent,\" said Malinkoff, \"and my advice is\nthat we accept his offer. He is not likely to betray us.\"\n\nThe car resumed its journey, and Cherry, who had taken his place inside,\nexplained the miracle which had happened.\n\n\"I saw the first lot of soldiers we passed,\" he said, \"and when the car\nstopped suddenly I knew what had happened. I took off my boots and\nclimbed on to the roof. I only made it just in time. The rest was like\neating pie.\"\n\n\"You didn't shoot the soldiers who were standing on the footboard, did\nyou?\" asked Malcolm. \"I heard no shots.\"\n\nCherry shook his head.\n\n\"Why shoot 'em?\" he said. \"I had only to lean over and hit 'em on the\nbean with the butt end of my gun, and it was a case of 'Where am I,\nnurse?'\"\n\nHalf an hour's drive brought them to the cross-roads, and the four\napathetic sentries who, at the word of the Red officer, stood aside to\nallow the car to pass. They were now doubling back on their tracks,\nrunning parallel with the railroad (according to Malinkoff) which, if\nthe officer's surmise was accurate, was the one on which Boolba was\nrushing by train to meet them. So far their auto had given them no\ntrouble, but twenty miles from the camp both the front tyres punctured\nsimultaneously. This might have been unimportant, for they carried two\nspare wheels, only it was discovered that one of these was also\npunctured and had evidently been taken out of use the day on which they\nsecured the car. There was nothing to do but to push the machine into a\nfield, darken the windows and allow the chauffeur to make his repairs on\nthe least damaged of the tubes. They shut him into the interior of the\ncar with the Red officer who volunteered his help, furnished him with a\nlamp, and walked down the road in the faint hope of discovering some\ncottage or farm where they could replenish their meagre store of food.\n\nHalf an hour's walking brought them to a straggling building which they\napproached with caution.\n\n\"It is too large for a farm,\" said Malinkoff; \"it is probably one of\nthose monasteries which exist in such numbers in the Moscow Government.\"\n\nThe place was in darkness and it was a long time before they found the\nentrance, which proved to be through a small chapel, sited in one corner\nof the walled enclosure. The windows of the chapel were high up, but\nMalcolm thought he detected a faint glow of light in the interior, and\nit was this flicker which guided them to the chapel. The door was half\nopen, and Malinkoff walked boldly in. The building, though small, was\nbeautiful. Green malachite columns held up the groined roof, and the\nwalls were white with the deadly whiteness of alabaster. A tiny altar,\non which burnt the conventional three candles, fronted them as they\nentered, and the screen glittered with gold. A priest knelt before the\naltar, singing in a thin, cracked voice, so unmusically that the girl\nwinced. Save for the priest and the party, the building was empty.\n\nHe rose at the sound of their footsteps, and stood waiting their\napproach. He was a young and singularly ugly man, and suspicion and fear\nwere written plainly on his face.\n\n\"God save you, little brother of saints!\" said Malinkoff.\n\n\"God save you, my son!\" replied the priest mechanically. \"What is it you\nwant?\"\n\n\"We need food and rest for this little lady, also hot coffee, and we\nwill pay well.\"\n\nMalinkoff knew that this latter argument was necessary. The priest shook\nhis head.\n\n\"All the brethren have gone away from the monastery except Father\nJoachim, who is a timid man, Father Nicholas and myself,\" he said. \"We\nhave very little food and none to spare. They have eaten everything we\nhad, and have killed my pretty chickens.\"\n\nHe did not say who \"they\" were, and Malinkoff was not sufficiently\ncurious to inquire. He knew that the priests were no longer the power in\nthe land that they were in the old days, and that there had been\ninnumerable cases where the villagers had risen and slaughtered the men\nwhose words hitherto had been as a law to them. A third of the\nmonasteries in the Moscow Government had been sacked and burnt, and\ntheir congregations and officers dispersed.\n\nHe was surprised to find this beautiful chapel still intact, but he had\nnot failed to notice the absence of the sacred vessels which usually\nadorned the altar, even in the midnight celebration.\n\n\"But can you do nothing for our little mama?\" asked Malinkoff.\n\nThe priest shook his head.\n\n\"Our guests have taken everything,\" he said. \"They have even turned\nBrother Joachim from the refectory.\"\n\n\"Your guests?\" said Malinkoff.\n\nThe priest nodded.\n\n\"It is a great prince,\" he said in awe. \"Terrible things are happening\nin the world, Antichrist is abroad, but we know little of such things in\nthe monastery. The peasants have been naughty and have broken down our\nwall, slain our martyred brother Mathias--we could not find his body,\"\nhe added quickly, \"and Brother Joachim thinks that the Jews have eaten\nhim so that by the consecrated holiness of his flesh they might avert\ntheir eternal damnation.\"\n\n\"Who is your prince?\" asked Malcolm, hope springing in his breast.\n\nThere were still powerful factions in Russia which were grouped about\nthe representatives and relatives of the late reigning house.\n\n\"I do not know his name,\" said the priest, \"but I will lead you to him.\nPerhaps he has food.\"\n\nHe extinguished two of the candles on the altar, crossing himself all\nthe while he was performing this ceremony, then led them through the\nscreen and out at the back of the chapel. Malcolm thought he saw a face\npeering round the door as they approached it, and the shadow of a flying\nform crossing the dark yard. Possibly the timid Father Joachim he\nthought. Running along the wall was a low-roofed building.\n\n\"We are a simple order,\" said the priest, \"and we live simply.\"\n\nHe had taken a candle lantern before he left the chapel, and this he\nheld up to give them a better view. Narrow half-doors, the tops being\nabsent, were set in the face of the building at intervals.\n\n\"Look!\" he said, and pushed the lamp into the black void.\n\n\"A stable?\" said Malinkoff.\n\nHe might have added: \"a particularly draughty and unpleasant stable.\"\nThere were straw-filled mangers and straw littered the floor.\n\n\"Do you keep many horses?\"\n\nThe priest shook his head.\n\n\"Here we sleep,\" he said, \"as directed in a vision granted to our most\nblessed saint and founder, St. Basil the Leper. For to him came an angel\nin the night, saying these words: 'Why sleepest thou in a fine bed when\nour Lord slept lowly in a stable?'\"\n\nHe led the way across the yard to a larger building.\n\n\"His lordship may not wish to be disturbed, and if he is asleep I will\nnot wake him.\"\n\n\"How long has he been here?\" asked Malcolm.\n\n\"Since morning,\" repeated the other.\n\nThey were in a stone hall, and the priest hesitated. Then he opened the\ndoor cautiously, and peeped in. The room was well illuminated; they\ncould see the hanging kerosene lamps from where they stood.\n\n\"Come,\" said the priest's voice in a whisper, \"he is awake.\"\n\nMalcolm went first. The room, though bare, looked bright and warm; a big\nwood fire blazed in an open hearth, and before it stood a man dressed in\na long blue military coat, his hands thrust into his pockets. The hood\nof the coat was drawn over his head, and his attitude was one of\ncontemplation. Malcolm approached him.\n\n\"Excellenz,\" he began, \"we are travellers who desire----\"\n\nSlowly the man turned.\n\n\"Oh, you 'desire'!\" he bellowed. \"What do you desire, Comrade Hay? I\nwill tell you what _I_ desire--my beautiful little lamb, my pretty\nlittle wife!\"\n\nIt was Boolba.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE END OF BOOLBA\n\n\nCherry Bim, the last of the party to enter the room, made a dash for the\ndoor, and came face to face with the levelled rifle held in the hands of\na soldier who had evidently been waiting the summons of Boolba's shout.\nBehind him were three other men. Cherry dropped to the ground as the\nman's rifle went off, shooting as he fell, and the man tumbled down.\nScrambling to his feet, he burst through the doorway like a human cannon\nball, but not even his nimble guns could save him this time. The hall\nwas full of soldiers, and they bore him down by sheer weight.\n\nThey dragged him into the refectory, bleeding, and the diversion at any\nrate had had one good effect. Only Boolba was there, roaring and raging,\ngroping a swift way round the walls, one hand searching, the other\nguiding.\n\n\"Where are they?\" he bellowed. \"Come to me, my little beauty. Hay! I\nwill burn alive. Where are they?\"\n\n\"Little Commissary,\" said the leader of the soldiers, \"she is not here.\nThey did not pass out.\"\n\n\"Search, search!\" shouted Boolba, striking at the man. \"Search, you\npig!\"\n\n\"We have the other boorjoo,\" stammered the man.\n\n\"Search!\" yelled Boolba. \"There is a door near the fire--is it open?\"\n\nThe door lay in the shadow, and the man ran to look.\n\n\"It is open, comrade,\" he said.\n\n\"After them, after them!\"\n\nBoolba howled the words, and in terror they left their prisoner and\nflocked out of the door. Cherry stood in the centre of the room, his\nhands strapped behind his back, his shirt half ripped from his body, and\nlooked up into the big blinded face which came peering towards him as\nthough, by an effort of will, it could glimpse his enemy.\n\n\"You are there?\"\n\nBoolba's hands passed lightly over the gun-man's face, fell upon his\nshoulders, slipped down the arm.\n\n\"Is this the thief? Yes, yes; this is the thief. What is he doing?\"\n\nHe turned, not knowing that the soldiers had left him alone, and again\nhis hands passed lightly over Cherry's face.\n\n\"This is good,\" he said, as he felt the bands on the wrists.\n\"To-morrow, little brother, you will be dead.\"\n\nHe might have spared himself his exercise and his reproaches, because to\nCherry Bim's untutored ear his reviling was a mere jabber of meaningless\nwords. Cherry was looking round to find something sharp enough on which\nto cut the strap which bound him, but there was nothing that looked like\na knife in the room. He knew he had a minute, and probably less, to make\nhis escape. His eyes rested for a moment on the holster at Boolba's\nbelt, and he side-stepped.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\nBoolba's heavy hand rested on his shoulder.\n\n\"Not out of the doorway, my little pigeon. I am blind, but----\"\n\nSo far he had got when Cherry turned in a flash, so that his back was\ntoward Boolba. He stooped, and made a sudden dash backward, colliding\nwith the Commissary, and in that second his hand had gripped the gun at\nBoolba's waist. There was a strap across the butt, but it broke with a\njerk.\n\nThen followed a duel without parallel. Boolba pulled his second gun and\nfired, and, shooting as blindly, Cherry fired backward. He heard a groan\nover his shoulder and saw Boolba fall to his knees. Then he ran for the\nmain door, stumbled past the state-bedroom of the monks, and into the\nchapel. It was his one chance that the priest had returned to his\ndevotions, and he found the man on his knees.\n\n\"Percy,\" said Cherry, \"unfasten that strap.\"\n\nThe priest understood no language but his own. But a gesture, the strap\nabout the wrists, blue and swollen, and the long revolver, needed no\nexplanation. The strap fell off and Cherry rubbed his wrists.\n\nHe opened the breech of his gun; he had four shells left, but he was\nalone against at least twenty men. He guessed that Boolba had made the\nmonastery his advance headquarters whilst he was waiting for news of the\nfugitives, and probably not twenty but two hundred were within call.\n\nHe reached the road and made for the place where the car had been left.\nIf the others had escaped they also would go in that direction. He saw\nno guard or sentry, and heard no sound from the walled enclosure of the\nmonastery. He struck against something in the roadway and stooped and\npicked it up. It was stitched in a canvas cover and it felt like a book.\nHe suddenly remembered the scraps of conversation he had overheard\nbetween the girl and Malcolm.\n\nThis, then, was the \"Book of All-Power.\"\n\n\"Foolishness,\" said Cherry, and put it in his pocket. But the book\nshowed one thing clearly--the others had got away. He had marked the\nplace where they had stopped, but the car was gone!\n\nIt was too dark to see the tracks, but there was no question that it had\nbeen here, for he found an empty petrol tin and the still air reeked of\nrubber solution.\n\nHe had need of all his philosophy. He was in an unknown country, a\nfugitive from justice, and that country was teeming with soldiers. Every\nroad was watched, and he had four cartridges between him and capture.\nThere was only one thing to do, and that was to go back the way the car\nhad come, and he stepped out undauntedly, halting now and again to stoop\nand look along the railway line, for he was enough of an old campaigner\nto know how to secure a skyline.\n\nThen in the distance he saw a regular line of lights, and those lights\nwere moving. It was a railway train, and apparently it was turning a\ncurve, for one by one the lights disappeared and only one flicker, which\nhe judged was on the engine, was visible. He bent down again and saw the\nlevel horizon of a railway embankment less than two hundred yards on his\nleft, and remembered that Malinkoff had spoken of the Warsaw line.\n\nHe ran at full speed, floundering into pools, breaking through bushes,\nand finally scrambled up the steep embankment. How to board the train\nseemed a problem which was insuperable, if the cars were moving at any\nspeed. There was little foothold by the side of the track, and\nundoubtedly the train was moving quickly, for now the noise of it was a\ndull roar, and he, who was not wholly unacquainted with certain\nunauthorized forms of travel, could judge to within a mile an hour the\nrate it was travelling.\n\nHe fumbled in his pocket and found a match. There was no means of making\na bonfire. The undergrowth was wet, and he had not so much as a piece of\npaper in his pocket.\n\n\"The book!\"\n\nHe pulled it out, ripped off the canvas cover with his knife, and tried\nto open it. The book was locked, he discovered, but locks were to Cherry\nlike pie-crusts--made to be broken. A wrench and the covers fell apart.\n\nHe tore out the first three or four pages, struck the match, and the\nflame was touching the corner of the paper when his eyes fell upon the\nprinted words. He stood open-mouthed, the flame still burning, gazing at\nthe torn leaf until the burning match touched his finger and he dropped\nit.\n\nTorn between doubts, and dazed as he was, the train might have passed\nhim, but the light of a match in the still, dark night could be seen for\nmiles, and he heard the jar of the brakes. He pushed the book and the\nloose leaves into his pocket and ran along the embankment to meet the\nslowing special--for special it was.\n\nHe managed to pass the engine unnoticed, then, crouching down until the\nlast carriage was abreast, he leapt up, caught the rail and swung\nhimself on to the rear footboard, up the steel plates which serve as\nsteps, to the roof of the carriage, just as the train stopped.\n\nThere were excited voices demanding explanations, there was a confusion\nof orders, and presently the train moved on, gathering speed, and Cherry\nhad time to think. It was still dark when they ran into a little\njunction, and, peeping over the side, he saw a group of officers descend\nfrom a carriage to stretch their legs. To them came a voluble and\ngesticulating railway official, and again there was a confusion of\nvoices. He was telling them something and his tone was apologetic,\nalmost fearful. Then, to Cherry's amazement, he heard somebody speak in\nEnglish. It was the voice of a stranger, a drawling English voice.\n\n\"Oh, I say! Let them come on, general! I wouldn't leave a dog in this\ncountry--really I wouldn't.\"\n\n\"But it is against all the rules of diplomacy,\" said a gruffer voice in\nthe same language.\n\n\"Moses!\" gasped Cherry.\n\nThe road led into the station-yard and he had seen the car. There was no\ndoubt of it. The lights from one of the train windows were sufficiently\nstrong to reveal it, and behind the stationmaster was another little\ngroup in the shadow.\n\n\"It is a matter of life and death.\" It was Malcolm's voice. \"I must get\nthis lady to the Polish frontier--it is an act of humanity I ask.\"\n\n\"English, eh?\" said the man called the general. \"Get on board.\"\n\nMalcolm took the girl in his arms before them all.\n\n\"Go, darling,\" he said gently.\n\n\"I cannot go without you,\" she said, but he shook his head.\n\n\"Malinkoff and I must wait. We cannot leave Cherry. We are going back to\nfind him. I am certain he has escaped.\"\n\n\"I will not leave without you,\" she said firmly.\n\n\"You'll all have to come or all have to stay,\" said the Englishman\nbriskly. \"We haven't any time to spare, and the train is now going on.\nYou see,\" he said apologetically, \"it isn't our train at all, it belongs\nto the Polish Commission, and we're only running the food end of the\nnegotiations. We have been fixing up terms between the Red Army and the\nPoles, and it is very irregular that we should take refugees from the\ncountry at all.\"\n\n\"_Go!_\"\n\nMalcolm heard the hoarse whisper, and it was as much as he could do to\nstop himself looking up. He remembered the motor-car and Cherry's\nmysterious and providential appearance from the roof, and he could guess\nthe rest.\n\n\"Very well, we will go. Come, Malinkoff, I will explain in the car,\"\nsaid Malcolm.\n\nThey lifted the girl into the carriage and the men followed. A shriek\nfrom the engine, a jerk of the cars, and the train moved on. Before the\nrear carriage had cleared the platform a car rocked into the\nstation-yard, dashing through the frail wooden fencing on to the\nplatform itself.\n\n\"_Stoi! Stoi!_\"\n\nBoolba stood up in the big touring car, his arms outstretched, the white\nbandage about his neck showing clearly in the car lights. Cherry Bim\nrose to his knees and steadied himself. Once, twice, three times he\nfired, and Boolba pitched over the side of the car dead.\n\n\"I had a feeling that we should meet again,\" said Cherry. \"That's not a\nbad gun.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE LAST\n\n\n\"All my life,\" said Cherry Bim, fondling his Derby hat affectionately,\n\"I have been what is called by night-court reporters a human parricide.\"\n\nHe occupied a corner seat in the first-class compartment which had been\nplaced at the disposal of the party. To the Peace Commissioners in their\nsaloon the fugitives had no existence. Officially they were not on the\ntrain, and the hot meal which came back to them from the Commissioner's\nown kitchenette was officially sent to \"extra train-men,\" and was\nentered as such on the books of the chef.\n\nThe girl smiled. There was cause for happiness, for these dreary flats\nwhich were passing the window were the flats of Poland.\n\n\"I have often thought, Mr. Bim, that you were a human angel!\"\n\nCherry beamed.\n\n\"Why, that's what I was named after,\" he said. \"Ain't you heard of the\nCherry Bims? My sister Sarah was named the same way--you've heard of\nSarah Bims?\"\n\n\"Seraphims,\" laughed Malcolm; \"true, it's near enough. But why this\ndissertation on your moral character, Cherry?\"\n\n\"I'm only remarking,\" said Cherry, \"I wouldn't like you gu--fellers to\ngo away thinkin' that high-class female society hadn't brought about a\nchange in what I would describe, for want of a better word, as my\noutlook.\"\n\n\"All our outlooks have been shaken up,\" said the girl, laying her hand\non Cherry's arm.\n\n\"I am a Grand Duchess of Russia and you are--you are----\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm that,\" said Cherry, helping her out. \"I'm one of nature's\nextractors. But I'm through. I hate the idea of workin' and maybe I\nwon't have to, because I've got enough of the--well, any way, I've got\nenough.\"\n\nMalcolm slapped him on the knee.\n\n\"You've brought more from Russia than we have, Cherry,\" he said.\n\n\"But not the greatest prize.\" It was the silent Malinkoff who spoke.\n\"Highness, is there no way of recovering your father's fortune?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"It is gone,\" she said quietly, \"and if Russia were pacified to-morrow I\nshould be poor--you know that, Malcolm!\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"I have not even,\" she smiled, \"poor Israel Kensky's wonderful book.\"\n\n\"I was a careless fool,\" growled Malcolm, \"when we struck the road I was\nso intent upon getting to the auto that I did not realize the book had\ndropped out. We hadn't a second to lose,\" he explained for the third\ntime to Cherry. \"The soldiers were searching in the yard when Malinkoff\nfound the breach in the wall. I hated leaving you----\"\n\n\"Aw!\" said the disgusted Cherry. \"Ain't we settled that? Didn't I hear\nyou tellin' Percy--and say, is it true that the young lady is--is\nbroke?\"\n\n\"'Broke' is exactly the word,\" she said cheerfully. \"I am going to be a\nnice Scottish wife and live within my husband's means--why, Cherry?\"\n\nHe had a book in his hand--the \"Book of All-Power.\"\n\n\"Where----?\"\n\n\"Found it on the road,\" he said. \"I broke the lock an' tore out a couple\nof leaves to light a flare. I wanted to flag the train--but I've got\n'em--the leaves, I mean.\"\n\n\"You found it?\"\n\nShe reached out her hand for the volume, but he did not give it to her.\n\n\"I can't read Russian,\" he said. \"What does this say?\" and he pointed to\nthe inscription on the cover, and she read, translating as she went on:\n\n\n                       \"THE BOOK OF ALL-POWER\n\n     \"Herein is the magic of power and the words and symbols which\n     unlock the sealed hearts of men and turn their proud wills to\n     water.\"\n\n\nCherry was silent.\n\n\"That's a lie,\" he said quietly, \"for it didn't turn my will to\nwater--take it, miss!\"\n\nShe took it from his hand, wondering, and turned the broken cover. She\ncould not believe her eyes ... and turned the leaves quickly. Every page\nwas a Bank of England note worth a thousand pounds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That was how Kensky kept his money evidently,\" said Malinkoff. \"In such\ntroublesome times as the Jews passed through, he must have thought it\nsafest to convert his property into English money, and when he had\nreached the limit of his hoard he bound the notes into a book.\"\n\nThe girl turned her bewildered face to Cherry.\n\n\"Did you know that this was money?\" she asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" he said; \"didn't I start in to burn it?\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Book of All-Power, by Edgar Wallace\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BOOK OF ALL-POWER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 24920-8.txt or 24920-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/9/2/24920/\n\nProduced by D Alexander, Martin Pettit and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This\nfile was produced from images generously made available\nby The Internet Archive)\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
