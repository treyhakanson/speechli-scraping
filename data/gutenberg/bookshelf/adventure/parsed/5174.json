Rider Haggard\n\nFirst Published 1915.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n                             BROTHER JOHN\n\nI do not suppose that anyone who knows the name of Allan Quatermain\nwould be likely to associate it with flowers, and especially with\norchids. Yet as it happens it was once my lot to take part in an orchid\nhunt of so remarkable a character that I think its details should not\nbe lost. At least I will set them down, and if in the after days anyone\ncares to publish them, well--he is at liberty to do so.\n\nIt was in the year--oh! never mind the year, it was a long while ago\nwhen I was much younger, that I went on a hunting expedition to the\nnorth of the Limpopo River which borders the Transvaal. My companion was\na gentleman of the name of Scroope, Charles Scroope. He had come out to\nDurban from England in search of sport. At least, that was one of his\nreasons. The other was a lady whom I will call Miss Margaret Manners,\nthough that was not her name.\n\nIt seems that these two were engaged to be married, and really attached\nto each other. Unfortunately, however, they quarrelled violently about\nanother gentlemen with whom Miss Manners danced four consecutive dances,\nincluding two that were promised to her fianc\u00e9 at a Hunt ball in Essex,\nwhere they all lived. Explanations, or rather argument, followed. Mr.\nScroope said that he would not tolerate such conduct. Miss Manners\nreplied that she would not be dictated to; she was her own mistress and\nmeant to remain so. Mr. Scroope exclaimed that she might so far as he\nwas concerned. She answered that she never wished to see his face again.\nHe declared with emphasis that she never should and that he was going to\nAfrica to shoot elephants.\n\nWhat is more, he went, starting from his Essex home the next day without\nleaving any address. As it transpired afterwards, long afterwards, had\nhe waited till the post came in he would have received a letter that\nmight have changed his plans. But they were high-spirited young people,\nboth of them, and played the fool after the fashion of those in love.\n\nWell, Charles Scroope turned up in Durban, which was but a poor place\nthen, and there we met in the bar of the Royal Hotel.\n\n\"If you want to kill big game,\" I heard some one say, who it was\nI really forget, \"there's the man to show you how to do it--Hunter\nQuatermain; the best shot in Africa and one of the finest fellows, too.\"\n\nI sat still, smoking my pipe and pretending to hear nothing. It is\nawkward to listen to oneself being praised, and I was always a shy man.\n\nThen after a whispered colloquy Mr. Scroope was brought forward and\nintroduced to me. I bowed as nicely as I could and ran my eye over him.\nHe was a tall young man with dark eyes and a rather romantic aspect\n(that was due to his love affair), but I came to the conclusion that I\nliked the cut of his jib. When he spoke, that conclusion was affirmed. I\nalways think there is a great deal in a voice; personally, I judge by it\nalmost as much as by the face. This voice was particularly pleasant and\nsympathetic, though there was nothing very original or striking in the\nwords by which it was, so to speak, introduced to me. These were:\n\n\"How do you do, sir. Will you have a split?\"\n\nI answered that I never drank spirits in the daytime, or at least not\noften, but that I should be pleased to take a small bottle of beer.\n\nWhen the beer was consumed we walked up together to my little house\non which is now called the Berea, the same in which, amongst others, I\nreceived my friends, Curtis and Good, in after days, and there we dined.\nIndeed, Charlie Scroope never left that house until we started on our\nshooting expedition.\n\nNow I must cut all this story short, since it is only incidentally that\nit has to do with the tale I am going to tell. Mr. Scroope was a rich\nman and as he offered to pay all the expenses of the expedition while I\nwas to take all the profit in the shape of ivory or anything else that\nmight accrue, of course I did not decline his proposal.\n\nEverything went well with us on that trip until its unfortunate end.\nWe only killed two elephants, but of other game we found plenty. It was\nwhen we were near Delagoa Bay on our return that the accident happened.\n\nWe were out one evening trying to shoot something for our dinner, when\nbetween the trees I caught sight of a small buck. It vanished round a\nlittle promontory of rock which projected from the side of the kloof,\nwalking quietly, not running in alarm. We followed after it. I was the\nfirst, and had just wriggled round these rocks and perceived the buck\nstanding about ten paces away (it was a bush-bok), when I heard a rustle\namong the bushes on the top of the rock not a dozen feet above my head,\nand Charlie Scroope's voice calling:\n\n\"Look out, Quatermain! He's coming.\"\n\n\"Who's coming?\" I answered in an irritated tone, for the noise had made\nthe buck run away.\n\nThen it occurred to me, all in an instant of course, that a man would\nnot begin to shout like that for nothing; at any rate when his supper\nwas concerned. So I glanced up above and behind me. To this moment I can\nremember exactly what I saw. There was the granite water-worn boulder,\nor rather several boulders, with ferns growing in their cracks of the\nmaiden-hair tribe, most of them, but some had a silver sheen on the\nunder side of their leaves. On one of these leaves, bending it down, sat\na large beetle with red wings and a black body engaged in rubbing its\nantenn\u00e6 with its front paws. And above, just appearing over the top of\nthe rock, was the head of an extremely fine leopard. As I write to\nseem to perceive its square jowl outlined against the arc of the quiet\nevening sky with the saliva dropping from its lips.\n\nThis was the last thing which I did perceive for a little while, since\nat that moment the leopard--we call them tigers in South Africa--dropped\nupon my back and knocked me flat as a pancake. I presume that it also\nhad been stalking the buck and was angry at my appearance on the scene.\nDown I went, luckily for me, into a patch of mossy soil.\n\n\"All up!\" I said to myself, for I felt the brute's weight upon my back\npressing me down among the moss, and what was worse, its hot breath upon\nmy neck as it dropped its jaws to bite me in the head. Then I heard\nthe report of Scroope's rifle, followed by furious snarling from the\nleopard, which evidently had been hit. Also it seemed to think that I\nhad caused its injuries, for it seized me by the shoulder. I felt its\nteeth slip along my skin, but happily they only fastened in the shooting\ncoat of tough corduroy that I was wearing. It began to shake me, then\nlet go to get a better grip. Now, remembering that Scroope only carried\na light, single-barrelled rifle, and therefore could not fire again,\nI knew, or thought I knew, that my time had come. I was not exactly\nafraid, but the sense of some great, impending chance became very\nvivid. I remembered--not my whole life, but one or two odd little things\nconnected with my infancy. For instance, I seemed to see myself seated\non my mother's knee, playing with a little jointed gold-fish which she\nwore upon her watch-chain.\n\nAfter this I muttered a word or two of supplication, and, I think, lost\nconsciousness. If so, it can only have been for a few seconds. Then my\nmind returned to me and I saw a strange sight. The leopard and Scroope\nwere fighting each other. The leopard, standing on one hind leg, for\nthe other was broken, seemed to be boxing Scroope, whilst Scroope was\ndriving his big hunting knife into the brute's carcase. They went down,\nScroope undermost, the leopard tearing at him. I gave a wriggle and came\nout of that mossy bed--I recall the sucking sound my body made as it\nleft the ooze.\n\nClose by was my rifle, uninjured and at full cock as it had fallen from\nmy hand. I seized it, and in another second had shot the leopard through\nthe head just as it was about to seize Scroope's throat.\n\nIt fell stone dead on the top of him. One quiver, one contraction of the\nclaws (in poor Scroope's leg) and all was over. There it lay as though\nit were asleep, and underneath was Scroope.\n\nThe difficulty was to get it off him, for the beast was very heavy, but\nI managed this at last with the help of a thorn bough I found which some\nelephant had torn from a tree. This I used as a lever. There beneath\nlay Scroope, literally covered with blood, though whether his own or\nthe leopard's I could not tell. At first I thought that he was dead,\nbut after I had poured some water over him from the little stream that\ntrickled down the rock, he sat up and asked inconsequently:\n\n\"What am I now?\"\n\n\"A hero,\" I answered. (I have always been proud of that repartee.)\n\nThen, discouraging further conversation, I set to work to get him back\nto the camp, which fortunately was close at hand.\n\nWhen we had proceeded a couple of hundred yards, he still making\ninconsequent remarks, his right arm round my neck and my left arm round\nhis middle, suddenly he collapsed in a dead faint, and as his weight was\nmore than I could carry, I had to leave him and fetch help.\n\nIn the end I got him to the tents by aid of the Kaffirs and a blanket,\nand there made an examination. He was scratched all over, but the only\nserious wounds were a bite through the muscles of the left upper arm and\nthree deep cuts in the right thigh just where it joins the body, caused\nby a stroke of the leopard's claws. I gave him a dose of laudanum to\nsend him to sleep and dressed these hurts as best I could. For three\ndays he went on quite well. Indeed, the wounds had begun to heal\nhealthily when suddenly some kind of fever took him, caused, I suppose,\nby the poison of the leopard's fangs or claws.\n\nOh! what a terrible week was that which followed! He became delirious,\nraving continually of all sorts of things, and especially of Miss\nMargaret Manners. I kept up his strength as well as was possible with\nsoup made from the flesh of game, mixed with a little brandy which I\nhad. But he grew weaker and weaker. Also the wounds in the thigh began\nto suppurate.\n\nThe Kaffirs whom we had with us were of little use in such a case, so\nthat all the nursing fell on me. Luckily, beyond a shaking, the leopard\nhad done me no hurt, and I was very strong in those days. Still the lack\nof rest told on me, since I dared not sleep for more than half an hour\nor so at a time. At length came a morning when I was quite worn out.\nThere lay poor Scroope turning and muttering in the little tent, and\nthere I sat by his side, wondering whether he would live to see another\ndawn, or if he did, for how long I should be able to tend him. I called\nto a Kaffir to bring me my coffee, and just was I was lifting the\npannikin to my lips with a shaking hand, help came.\n\nIt arrived in a very strange shape. In front of our camp were two\nthorn trees, and from between these trees, the rays from the rising\nsun falling full on him, I saw a curious figure walking towards me in\na slow, purposeful fashion. It was that of a man of uncertain age, for\nthough the beard and long hair were white, the face was comparatively\nyouthful, save for the wrinkles round the mouth, and the dark eyes were\nfull of life and vigour. Tattered garments, surmounted by a torn kaross\nor skin rug, hung awkwardly upon his tall, thin frame. On his feet\nwere veld-schoen of untanned hide, on his back a battered tin case was\nstrapped, and in his bony, nervous hand he clasped a long staff made\nof the black and white wood the natives call _unzimbiti_, on the top\nof which was fixed a butterfly net. Behind him were some Kaffirs who\ncarried cases on their heads.\n\nI knew him at once, since we had met before, especially on a certain\noccasion in Zululand, when he calmly appeared out of the ranks of a\nhostile native _impi_. He was one of the strangest characters in all\nSouth Africa. Evidently a gentleman in the true sense of the word, none\nknew his history (although I know it now, and a strange story it is),\nexcept that he was an American by birth, for in this matter at times his\nspeech betrayed him. Also he was a doctor by profession, and to judge\nfrom his extraordinary skill, one who must have seen much practice both\nin medicine and in surgery. For the rest he had means, though where\nthey came from was a mystery, and for many years past had wandered about\nSouth and Eastern Africa, collecting butterflies and flowers.\n\nBy the natives, and I might add by white people also, he was universally\nsupposed to be mad. This reputation, coupled with his medical skill,\nenabled him to travel wherever he would without the slightest fear of\nmolestation, since the Kaffirs look upon the mad as inspired by God.\nTheir name for him was \"Dogeetah,\" a ludicrous corruption of the English\nword \"doctor,\" whereas white folk called him indifferently \"Brother\nJohn,\" \"Uncle Jonathan,\" or \"Saint John.\" The second appellation he got\nfrom his extraordinary likeness (when cleaned up and nicely dressed)\nto the figure by which the great American nation is typified in comic\npapers, as England is typified by John Bull. The first and third arose\nin the well-known goodness of his character and a taste he was supposed\nto possess for living on locusts and wild honey, or their local\nequivalents. Personally, however, he preferred to be addressed as\n\"Brother John.\"\n\nOh! who can tell the relief with which I saw him; an angel from heaven\ncould scarcely have been more welcome. As he came I poured out a second\njorum of coffee, and remembering that he liked it sweet, put in plenty\nof sugar.\n\n\"How do you do, Brother John?\" I said, proffering him the coffee.\n\n\"Greeting, Brother Allan,\" he answered--in those days he affected a kind\nof old Roman way of speaking, as I imagine it. Then he took the coffee,\nput his long finger into it to test the temperature and stir up the\nsugar, drank it off as though it were a dose of medicine, and handed\nback the tin to be refilled.\n\n\"Bug-hunting?\" I queried.\n\nHe nodded. \"That and flowers and observing human nature and the\nwonderful works of God. Wandering around generally.\"\n\n\"Where from last?\" I asked.\n\n\"Those hills nearly twenty miles away. Left them at eight in the\nevening; walked all night.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I said, looking at him.\n\n\"Because it seemed as though someone were calling me. To be plain, you,\nAllan.\"\n\n\"Oh! you heard about my being here and the trouble?\"\n\n\"No, heard nothing. Meant to strike out for the coast this morning.\nJust as I was turning in, at 8.5 exactly, got your message and started.\nThat's all.\"\n\n\"My message----\" I began, then stopped, and asking to see his watch,\ncompared it with mine. Oddly enough, they showed the same time to within\ntwo minutes.\n\n\"It is a strange thing,\" I said slowly, \"but at 8.5 last night I did try\nto send a message for some help because I thought my mate was dying,\"\nand I jerked my thumb towards the tent. \"Only it wasn't to you or any\nother man, Brother John. Understand?\"\n\n\"Quite. Message was expressed on, that's all. Expressed and I guess\nregistered as well.\"\n\nI looked at Brother John and Brother John looked at me, but at the time\nwe made no further remark. The thing was too curious, that is, unless\nhe lied. But nobody had ever known him to lie. He was a truthful person,\npainfully truthful at times. And yet there are people who do not believe\nin prayer.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Mauled by leopard. Wounds won't heal, and fever. I don't think he can\nlast long.\"\n\n\"What do you know about it? Let me see him.\"\n\nWell, he saw him and did wonderful things. That tin box of his was full\nof medicines and surgical instruments, which latter he boiled before he\nused them. Also he washed his hands till I thought the skin would come\noff them, using up more soap than I could spare. First he gave poor\nCharlie a dose of something that seemed to kill him; he said he had that\ndrug from the Kaffirs. Then he opened up those wounds upon his thigh and\ncleaned them out and bandaged them with boiled herbs. Afterwards, when\nScroope came to again, he gave him a drink that threw him into a sweat\nand took away the fever. The end of it was that in two days' time his\npatient sat up and asked for a square meal, and in a week we were able\nto begin to carry him to the coast.\n\n\"Guess that message of yours saved Brother Scroope's life,\" said old\nJohn, as he watched him start.\n\nI made no answer. Here I may state, however, that through my own men I\ninquired a little as to Brother John's movements at the time of what he\ncalled the message. It seemed that he _had_ arranged to march towards\nthe coast on the next morning, but that about two hours after sunset\nsuddenly he ordered them to pack up everything and follow him. This they\ndid and to their intense disgust those Kaffirs were forced to trudge all\nnight at the heels of Dogeetah, as they called him. Indeed, so weary\ndid they become, that had they not been afraid of being left alone in an\nunknown country in the darkness, they said they would have thrown down\ntheir loads and refused to go any further.\n\nThat is as far as I was able to take the matter, which may be explained\nby telepathy, inspiration, instinct, or coincidence. It is one as to\nwhich the reader must form his own opinion.\n\nDuring our week together in camp and our subsequent journey to Delagoa\nBay and thence by ship to Durban, Brother John and I grew very intimate,\nwith limitations. Of his past, as I have said, he never talked, or of\nthe real object of his wanderings which I learned afterwards, but of his\nnatural history and ethnological (I believe that is the word) studies he\nspoke a good deal. As, in my humble way, I also am an observer of such\nmatters and know something about African natives and their habits from\npractical experience, these subjects interested me.\n\nAmongst other things, he showed me many of the specimens that he had\ncollected during his recent journey; insects and beautiful butterflies\nneatly pinned into boxes, also a quantity of dried flowers pressed\nbetween sheets of blotting paper, amongst them some which he told me\nwere orchids. Observing that these attracted me, he asked me if I would\nlike to see the most wonderful orchid in the whole world. Of course I\nsaid yes, whereon he produced out of one of his cases a flat package\nabout two feet six square. He undid the grass mats in which it was\nwrapped, striped, delicately woven mats such as they make in the\nneighbourhood of Zanzibar. Within these was the lid of a packing-case.\nThen came more mats and some copies of _The Cape Journal_ spread out\nflat. Then sheets of blotting paper, and last of all between two pieces\nof cardboard, a flower and one leaf of the plant on which it grew.\n\nEven in its dried state it was a wondrous thing, measuring twenty-four\ninches from the tip of one wing or petal to the tip of the other, by\ntwenty inches from the top of the back sheath to the bottom of the\npouch. The measurement of the back sheath itself I forget, but it must\nhave been quite a foot across. In colour it was, or had been, bright\ngolden, but the back sheath was white, barred with lines of black, and\nin the exact centre of the pouch was a single black spot shaped like the\nhead of a great ape. There were the overhanging brows, the deep recessed\neyes, the surly mouth, the massive jaws--everything.\n\nAlthough at that time I had never seen a gorilla in the flesh, I had\nseen a coloured picture of the brute, and if that picture had been\nphotographed on the flower the likeness could not have been more\nperfect.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, amazed.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Brother John, sometimes he used this formal term when\nexcited, \"it is the most marvellous Cypripedium in the whole earth, and,\nsir, I have discovered it. A healthy root of that plant will be worth\n\u00a320,000.\"\n\n\"That's better than gold mining,\" I said. \"Well, have you got the root?\"\n\nBrother John shook his head sadly as he answered:\n\n\"No such luck.\"\n\n\"How's that as you have the flower?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, Allan. For a year past and more I have been collecting\nin the district back of Kilwa and found some wonderful things, yes,\nwonderful. At last, about three hundred miles inland, I came to a tribe,\nor rather, a people, that no white man had ever visited. They are called\nthe Mazitu, a numerous and warlike people of bastard Zulu blood.\"\n\n\"I have heard of them,\" I interrupted. \"They broke north before the days\nof Senzangakona, two hundred years or more ago.\"\n\n\"Well, I could make myself understood among them because they still\ntalk a corrupt Zulu, as do all the tribes in those parts. At first they\nwanted to kill me, but let me go because they thought that I was mad.\nEveryone thinks that I am mad, Allan; it is a kind of public delusion,\nwhereas I think that I am sane and that most other people are mad.\"\n\n\"A private delusion,\" I suggested hurriedly, as I did not wish to\ndiscuss Brother John's sanity. \"Well, go on about the Mazitu.\"\n\n\"Later they discovered that I had skill in medicine, and their king,\nBausi, came to me to be treated for a great external tumour. I risked\nan operation and cured him. It was anxious work, for if he had died I\nshould have died too, though that would not have troubled me very much,\"\nand he sighed. \"Of course, from that moment I was supposed to be a great\nmagician. Also Bausi made a blood brotherhood with me, transfusing some\nof his blood into my veins and some of mine into his. I only hope he has\nnot inoculated me with his tumours, which are congenital. So I became\nBausi and Bausi became me. In other words, I was as much chief of the\nMazitu as he was, and shall remain so all my life.\"\n\n\"That might be useful,\" I said, reflectively, \"but go on.\"\n\n\"I learned that on the western boundary of the Mazitu territory were\ngreat swamps; that beyond these swamps was a lake called Kirua, and\nbeyond that a large and fertile land supposed to be an island, with\na mountain in its centre. This land is known as Pongo, and so are the\npeople who live there.\"\n\n\"That is a native name for the gorilla, isn't it?\" I asked. \"At least so\na fellow who had been on the West Coast told me.\"\n\n\"Indeed, then that's strange, as you will see. Now these Pongo are\nsupposed to be great magicians, and the god they worship is said to be\na gorilla, which, if you are right, accounts for their name. Or rather,\"\nhe went on, \"they have two gods. The other is that flower you see there.\nWhether the flower with the monkey's head on it was the first god and\nsuggested the worship of the beast itself, or _vice versa_, I don't\nknow. Indeed I know very little, just what I was told by the Mazitu and\na man who called himself a Pongo chief, no more.\"\n\n\"What did they say?\"\n\n\"The Mazitu said that the Pongo people are devils who came by the secret\nchannels through the reeds in canoes and stole their children and women,\nwhom they sacrificed to their gods. Sometimes, too, they made raids upon\nthem at night, 'howling like hyenas.' The men they killed and the women\nand children they took away. The Mazitu want to attack them but cannot\ndo so, because they are not water people and have no canoes, and\ntherefore are unable to reach the island, if it is an island. Also they\ntold me about the wonderful flower which grows in the place where the\nape-god lives, and is worshipped like the god. They had the story of it\nfrom some of their people who had been enslaved and escaped.\"\n\n\"Did you try to get to the island?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, Allan. That is, I went to the edge of the reeds which lie at the\nend of a long slope of plain, where the lake begins. Here I stopped for\nsome time catching butterflies and collecting plants. One night when I\nwas camped there by myself, for none of my men would remain so near the\nPongo country after sunset, I woke up with a sense that I was no longer\nalone. I crept out of my tent and by the light of the moon, which was\nsetting, for dawn drew near, I saw a man who leant upon the handle of a\nvery wide-bladed spear which was taller than himself, a big man over six\nfeet two high, I should say, and broad in proportion. He wore a long,\nwhite cloak reaching from his shoulders almost to the ground. On his\nhead was a tight-fitting cap with lappets, also white. In his ears were\nrings of copper or gold, and on his wrists bracelets of the same metal.\nHis skin was intensely black, but the features were not at all negroid.\nThey were prominent and finely-cut, the nose being sharp and the lips\nquite thin; indeed of an Arab type. His left hand was bandaged, and on\nhis face was an expression of great anxiety. Lastly, he appeared to be\nabout fifty years of age. So still did he stand that I began to wonder\nwhether he were one of those ghosts which the Mazitu swore the Pongo\nwizards send out to haunt their country.\n\n\"For a long while we stared at each other, for I was determined that I\nwould not speak first or show any concern. At last he spoke in a low,\ndeep voice and in Mazitu, or a language so similar that I found it easy\nto understand.\n\n\"'Is not your name Dogeetah, O White Lord, and are you not a master of\nmedicine?'\n\n\"'Yes,' I answered, 'but who are you who dare to wake me from my sleep?'\n\n\"'Lord, I am the Kalubi, the Chief of the Pongo, a great man in my own\nland yonder.'\n\n\"'Then why do you come here alone at night, Kalubi, Chief of the Pongo?'\n\n\"'Why do _you_ come here alone, White Lord?' he answered evasively.\n\n\"'What do you want, anyway?' I asked.\n\n\"'O! Dogeetah, I have been hurt, I want you to cure me,' and he looked\nat his bandaged hand.\n\n\"'Lay down that spear and open your robe that I may see you have no\nknife.'\n\n\"He obeyed, throwing the spear to some distance.\n\n\"'Now unwrap the hand.'\n\n\"He did so. I lit a match, the sight of which seemed to frighten him\ngreatly, although he asked no questions about it, and by its light\nexamined the hand. The first joint of the second finger was gone. From\nthe appearance of the stump which had been cauterized and was tied\ntightly with a piece of flexible grass, I judged that it had been bitten\noff.\n\n\"'What did this?' I asked.\n\n\"'Monkey,' he answered, 'poisonous monkey. Cut off the finger, O\nDogeetah, or tomorrow I die.'\n\n\"'Why do you not tell your own doctors to cut off the finger, you who\nare Kalubi, Chief of the Pongo?'\n\n\"'No, no,' he replied, shaking his head. 'They cannot do it. It is not\nlawful. And I, I cannot do it, for if the flesh is black the hand must\ncome off too, and if the flesh is black at the wrist, then the arm must\nbe cut off.'\n\n\"I sat down on my camp stool and reflected. Really I was waiting for the\nsun to rise, since it was useless to attempt an operation in that light.\nThe man, Kalubi, thought that I had refused his petition and became\nterribly agitated.\n\n\"'Be merciful, White Lord,' he prayed, 'do not let me die. I am afraid\nto die. Life is bad, but death is worse. O! If you refuse me, I will\nkill myself here before you and then my ghost will haunt you till you\ndie also of fear and come to join me. What fee do you ask? Gold or ivory\nor slaves? Say and I will give it.'\n\n\"'Be silent,' I said, for I saw that if he went on thus he would throw\nhimself into a fever, which might cause the operation to prove fatal.\nFor the same reason I did not question him about many things I should\nhave liked to learn. I lit my fire and boiled the instruments--he\nthought I was making magic. By the time that everything was ready the\nsun was up.\n\n\"'Now,' I said, 'let me see how brave you are.'\n\n\"Well, Allan, I performed that operation, removing the finger at the\nbase where it joins the hand, as I thought there might be something in\nhis story of the poison. Indeed, as I found afterwards on dissection,\nand can show you, for I have the thing in spirits, there was, for the\nblackness of which he spoke, a kind of mortification, I presume, had\ncrept almost to the joint, though the flesh beyond was healthy enough.\nCertainly that Kalubi was a plucky fellow. He sat like a rock and never\neven winced. Indeed, when he saw that the flesh was sound he uttered a\ngreat sigh of relief. After it was all over he turned a little faint, so\nI gave him some spirits of wine mixed with water which revived him.\n\n\"'O Lord Dogeetah,' he said, as I was bandaging his hand, 'while I live\nI am your slave. Yet, do me one more service. In my land there is a\nterrible wild beast, that which bit off my finger. It is a devil; it\nkills us and we fear it. I have heard that you white men have magic\nweapons which slay with a noise. Come to my land and kill me that wild\nbeast with your magic weapon. I say, Come, Come, for I am terribly\nafraid,' and indeed he looked it.\n\n\"'No,' I answered, 'I shed no blood; I kill nothing except butterflies,\nand of these only a few. But if you fear this brute why do you not\npoison it? You black people have many drugs.'\n\n\"'No use, no use,' he replied in a kind of wail. 'The beast knows\npoisons, some it swallows and they do not harm it. Others it will not\ntouch. Moreover, no black man can do it hurt. It is white, and it has\nbeen known from of old that if it dies at all, it must be by the hand of\none who is white.'\n\n\"'A very strange animal,' I began, suspiciously, for I felt sure that he\nwas lying to me. But just at that moment I heard the sound of my men's\nvoices. They were advancing towards me through the giant grass, singing\nas they came, but as yet a long way off. The Kalubi heard it also and\nsprang up.\n\n\"'I must be gone,' he said. 'None must see me here. What fee, O Lord of\nmedicine, what fee?'\n\n\"'I take no payment for my medicine,' I said. 'Yet--stay. A wonderful\nflower grows in your country, does it not? A flower with wings and a cup\nbeneath. I would have that flower.'\n\n\"'Who told you of the Flower?' he asked. 'The Flower is holy. Still, O\nWhite Lord, still for you it shall be risked. Oh, return and bring with\nyou one who can kill the beast and I will make you rich. Return and call\nto the reeds for the Kalubi, and the Kalubi will hear and come to you.'\n\n\"Then he ran to his spear, snatched it from the ground and vanished\namong the reeds. That was the last I saw, or am ever likely to see, of\nhim.\"\n\n\"But, Brother John, you got the flower somehow.\"\n\n\"Yes, Allan. About a week later when I came out of my tent one morning,\nthere it was standing in a narrow-mouthed, earthenware pot filled with\nwater. Of course I meant that he was to send me the plant, roots and\nall, but I suppose he understood that I wanted a bloom. Or perhaps he\ndared not send the plant. Anyhow, it is better than nothing.\"\n\n\"Why did you not go into the country and get it for yourself?\"\n\n\"For several reasons, Allan, of which the best is that it was\nimpossible. The Mazitu swear that if anyone sees that flower he is put\nto death. Indeed, when they found that I had a bloom of it, they forced\nme to move to the other side of the country seventy miles away. So I\nthought that I would wait till I met with some companions who would\naccompany me. Indeed, to be frank, Allan, it occurred to me that you\nwere the sort of man who would like to interview this wonderful beast\nthat bites off people's fingers and frightens them to death,\" and\nBrother John stroked his long, white beard and smiled, adding, \"Odd that\nwe should have met so soon afterwards, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Did you?\" I replied, \"now did you indeed? Brother John, people say\nall sorts of things about you, but I have come to the conclusion that\nthere's nothing the matter with your wits.\"\n\nAgain he smiled and stroked his long, white beard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n                           THE AUCTION ROOM\n\nI do not think that this conversion about the Pongo savages who were\nsaid to worship a Gorilla and a Golden Flower was renewed until we\nreached my house at Durban. Thither of course I took Mr. Charles\nScroope, and thither also came Brother John who, as bedroom\naccommodation was lacking, pitched his tent in the garden.\n\nOne night we sat on the step smoking; Brother John's only concession to\nhuman weakness was that he smoked. He drank no wine or spirits; he never\nate meat unless he was obliged, but I rejoice to say that he smoked\ncigars, like most Americans, when he could get them.\n\n\"John,\" said I, \"I have been thinking over that yarn of yours and have\ncome to one or two conclusions.\"\n\n\"What may they be, Allan?\"\n\n\"The first is that you were a great donkey not to get more out of the\nKalubi when you had the chance.\"\n\n\"Agreed, Allan, but, amongst other things, I am a doctor and the\noperation was uppermost in my mind.\"\n\n\"The second is that I believe this Kalubi had charge of the gorilla-god,\nas no doubt you've guessed; also that it was the gorilla which bit off\nhis finger.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because I have heard of great monkeys called _sokos_ that live in\nCentral East Africa which are said to bite off men's toes and fingers. I\nhave heard too that they are very like gorillas.\"\n\n\"Now you mention it, so have I, Allan. Indeed, once I saw a _soko_,\nthough some way off, a huge, brown ape which stood on its hind legs and\ndrummed upon its chest with its fists. I didn't see it for long because\nI ran away.\"\n\n\"The third is that this yellow orchid would be worth a great deal of\nmoney if one could dig it up and take it to England.\"\n\n\"I think I told you, Allan, that I valued it at \u00a320,000, so that\nconclusion of yours is not original.\"\n\n\"The fourth is that I should like to dig up that orchid and get a share\nof the \u00a320,000.\"\n\nBrother John became intensely interested.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"now we are getting to the point. I have been wondering\nhow long it would take you to see it, Allan, but if you are slow, you\nare sure.\"\n\n\"The fifth is,\" I went on, \"that such an expedition to succeed would\nneed a great deal of money, more than you or I could find. Partners\nwould be wanted, active or sleeping, but partners with cash.\"\n\nBrother John looked towards the window of the room in which Charlie\nScroope was in bed, for being still weak he went to rest early.\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"he's had enough of Africa, and you told me yourself that\nit will be two years before he is really strong again. Also there's a\nlady in this case. Now listen. I have taken it on myself to write to\nthat lady, whose address I found out while he didn't know what he was\nsaying. I have said that he was dying, but that I hoped he might live.\nMeanwhile, I added, I thought she would like to know that he did nothing\nbut rave of her; also that he was a hero, with a big H twice underlined.\nMy word! I did lay it on about the hero business with a spoon, a real\nhotel gravy spoon. If Charlie Scroope knows himself again when he sees\nmy description of him, well, I'm a Dutchman, that's all. The letter\ncaught the last mail and will, I hope, reach the lady in due course. Now\nlisten again. Scroope wants me to go to England with him to look after\nhim on the voyage--that's what he says. What he means is that he hopes\nI might put in a word for him with the lady, if I should chance to\nbe introduced to her. He offers to pay all my expenses and to give me\nsomething for my loss of time. So, as I haven't seen England since I was\nthree years old, I think I'll take the chance.\"\n\nBrother John's face fell. \"Then how about the expedition, Allan?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"This is the first of November,\" I answered, \"and the wet season in\nthose parts begins about now and lasts till April. So it would be no use\ntrying to visit your Pongo friends till then, which gives me plenty of\ntime to go to England and come out again. If you'll trust that flower\nto me I'll take it with me. Perhaps I might be able to find someone who\nwould be willing to put down money on the chance of getting the plant on\nwhich it grew. Meanwhile, you are welcome to this house if you care to\nstay here.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Allan, but I can't sit still for so many months. I'll go\nsomewhere and come back.\" He paused and a dreamy look came into his dark\neyes, then went on, \"You see, Brother, it is laid on me to wander and\nwander through all this great land until--I know.\"\n\n\"Until you know what?\" I asked, sharply.\n\nHe pulled himself together with a jerk, as it were, and answered with a\nkind of forced carelessness.\n\n\"Until I know every inch of it, of course. There are lots of tribes I\nhave not yet visited.\"\n\n\"Including the Pongo,\" I said. \"By the way, if I can get the money\ntogether for a trip up there, I suppose you mean to come too, don't\nyou? If not, the thing's off so far as I am concerned. You see, I am\nreckoning on you to get us through the Mazitu and into Pongo-land by the\nhelp of your friends.\"\n\n\"Certainly I mean to come. In fact, if you don't go, I shall start\nalone. I intend to explore Pongo-land even if I never come out of it\nagain.\"\n\nOnce more I looked at him as I answered:\n\n\"You are ready to risk a great deal for a flower, John. Or are you\nlooking for more than a flower? If so, I hope you will tell me the\ntruth.\"\n\nThis I said as I was aware that Brother John had a foolish objection to\nuttering, or even acting lies.\n\n\"Well, Allan, as you put it like that, the truth is that I heard\nsomething more about the Pongo than I told you up country. It was after\nI had operated on that Kalubi, or I would have tried to get in alone.\nBut this I could not do then as I have said.\"\n\n\"And what did you hear?\"\n\n\"I heard that they had a white goddess as well as a white god.\"\n\n\"Well, what of it? A female gorilla, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Nothing, except that goddesses have always interested me. Good night.\"\n\n\"You are an odd old fish,\" I remarked after him, \"and what is more you\nhave got something up your sleeve. Well, I'll have it down one day.\nMeanwhile, I wonder whether the whole thing is a lie, no; not a lie, an\nhallucination. It can't be--because of that orchid. No one can explain\naway the orchid. A queer people, these Pongo, with their white god and\ngoddess and their Holy Flower. But after all Africa is a land of queer\npeople, and of queer gods too.\"\n\n\n\nAnd now the story shifts away to England. (Don't be afraid, my\nadventurous reader, if ever I have one, it is coming back to Africa\nagain in a very few pages.)\n\nMr. Charles Scroope and I left Durban a day or two after my last\nconversation with Brother John. At Cape Town we caught the mail, a\nwretched little boat you would think it now, which after a long and\nwearisome journey at length landed us safe at Plymouth. Our companions\non that voyage were very dull. I have forgotten most of them, but one\nlady I do remember. I imagine that she must have commenced life as a\nbarmaid, for she had the orthodox tow hair and blowsy appearance. At any\nrate, she was the wife of a wine-merchant who had made a fortune at the\nCape. Unhappily, however, she had contracted too great a liking for her\nhusband's wares, and after dinner was apt to become talkative. For some\nreason or other she took a particular aversion to me. Oh! I can see her\nnow, seated in that saloon with the oil lamp swinging over her head (she\nalways chose the position under the oil lamp because it showed off\nher diamonds). And I can hear her too. \"Don't bring any of your\nelephant-hunting manners here, Mr. Allan\" (with an emphasis on the\nAllan) \"Quatermain, they are not fit for polite society. You should go\nand brush your hair, Mr. Quatermain.\" (I may explain that my hair sticks\nup naturally.)\n\nThen would come her little husband's horrified \"Hush! hush! you are\nquite insulting, my dear.\"\n\nOh! why do I remember it all after so many years when I have even\nforgotten the people's names? One of those little things that stick in\nthe mind, I suppose. The Island of Ascension, where we called, sticks\nalso with its long swinging rollers breaking in white foam, its bare\nmountain peak capped with green, and the turtles in the ponds. Those\npoor turtles. We brought two of them home, and I used to look at them\nlying on their backs in the forecastle flapping their fins feebly. One\nof them died, and I got the butcher to save me the shell. Afterwards I\ngave it as a wedding present to Mr. and Mrs. Scroope, nicely polished\nand lined. I meant it for a work-basket, and was overwhelmed with\nconfusion when some silly lady said at the marriage, and in the hearing\nof the bride and bridegroom, that it was the most beautiful cradle\nshe had ever seen. Of course, like a fool, I tried to explain, whereon\neverybody tittered.\n\nBut why do I write of such trifles that have nothing to do with my\nstory?\n\nI mentioned that I had ventured to send a letter to Miss Margaret\nManners about Mr. Charles Scroope, in which I said incidentally that if\nthe hero should happen to live I should probably bring him home by\nthe next mail. Well, we got into Plymouth about eight o'clock in the\nmorning, on a mild, November day, and shortly afterwards a tug arrived\nto take off the passengers and mails; also some cargo. I, being an early\nriser, watched it come and saw upon the deck a stout lady wrapped in\nfurs, and by her side a very pretty, fair-haired young woman clad in a\nneat serge dress and a pork-pie hat. Presently a steward told me that\nsomeone wished to speak to me in the saloon. I went and found these two\nstanding side by side.\n\n\"I believe you are Mr. Allan Quatermain,\" said the stout lady. \"Where is\nMr. Scroope whom I understand you have brought home? Tell me at once.\"\n\nSomething about her appearance and fierce manner of address alarmed me\nso much that I could only answer feebly:\n\n\"Below, madam, below.\"\n\n\"There, my dear,\" said the stout lady to her companion, \"I warned you to\nbe prepared for the worst. Bear up; do not make a scene before all these\npeople. The ways of Providence are just and inscrutable. It is your own\ntemper that was to blame. You should never have sent the poor man off to\nthese heathen countries.\"\n\nThen, turning to me, she added sharply: \"I suppose he is embalmed; we\nshould like to bury him in Essex.\"\n\n\"Embalmed!\" I gasped. \"Embalmed! Why, the man is in his bath, or was a\nfew minutes ago.\"\n\nIn another second that pretty young lady who had been addressed was\nweeping with her head upon my shoulder.\n\n\"Margaret!\" exclaimed her companion (she was a kind of heavy aunt), \"I\ntold you not to make a scene in public. Mr. Quatermain, as Mr. Scroope\nis alive, would you ask him to be so good as to come here.\"\n\nWell, I fetched him, half-shaved, and the rest of the business may be\nimagined. It is a very fine thing to be a hero with a big H. Henceforth\n(thanks to me) that was Charlie Scroope's lot in life. He has\ngrandchildren now, and they all think him a hero. What is more, he does\nnot contradict them. I went down to the lady's place in Essex, a fine\nproperty with a beautiful old house. On the night I arrived there was a\ndinner-party of twenty-four people. I had to make a speech about Charlie\nScroope and the leopard. I think it was a good speech. At any rate\neverybody cheered, including the servants, who had gathered at the back\nof the big hall.\n\nI remember that to complete the story I introduced several other\nleopards, a mother and two three-part-grown cubs, also a wounded\nbuffalo, and told how Mr. Scroope finished them off one after the other\nwith a hunting knife. The thing was to watch his face as the history\nproceeded. Luckily he was sitting next to me and I could kick him under\nthe table. It was all very amusing, and very happy also, for these two\nreally loved each other. Thank God that I, or rather Brother John, was\nable to bring them together again.\n\nIt was during that stay of mine in Essex, by the way, that I first met\nLord Ragnall and the beautiful Miss Holmes with whom I was destined to\nexperience some very strange adventures in the after years.\n\n\n\nAfter this interlude I got to work. Someone told me that there was a\nfirm in the City that made a business of selling orchids by auction,\nflowers which at this time were beginning to be very fashionable among\nrich horticulturists. This, thought I, would be the place for me to\nshow my treasure. Doubtless Messrs. May and Primrose--that was their\nworld-famed style--would be able to put me in touch with opulent\norchidists who would not mind venturing a couple of thousands on the\nchance of receiving a share in a flower that, according to Brother John,\nshould be worth untold gold. At any rate, I would try.\n\nSo on a certain Friday, about half-past twelve, I sought out the place\nof business of Messrs. May and Primrose, bearing with me the golden\nCypripedium, which was now enclosed in a flat tin case.\n\nAs it happened I chose an unlucky day and hour, for on arriving at the\noffice and asking for Mr. May, I was informed that he was away in the\ncountry valuing.\n\n\"Then I would like to see Mr. Primrose,\" I said.\n\n\"Mr. Primrose is round at the Rooms selling,\" replied the clerk, who\nappeared to be very busy.\n\n\"Where are the Rooms?\" I asked.\n\n\"Out of the door, turn to the left, turn to the left again and under the\nclock,\" said the clerk, and closed the shutter.\n\nSo disgusted was I with his rudeness that I nearly gave up the\nenterprise. Thinking better of it, however, I followed the directions\ngiven, and in a minute or two found myself in a narrow passage that led\nto a large room. To one who had never seen anything of the sort before,\nthis room offered a curious sight. The first thing I observed was a\nnotice on the wall to the effect that customers were not allowed to\nsmoke pipes. I thought to myself that orchids must be curious flowers\nif they could distinguish between the smoke of a cigar and a pipe, and\nstepped into the room. To my left was a long table covered with pots of\nthe most beautiful flowers that I had ever seen; all of them orchids.\nAlong the wall and opposite were other tables closely packed with\nwithered roots which I concluded were also those of orchids. To my\ninexperienced eye the whole lot did not look worth five shillings, for\nthey seemed to be dead.\n\nAt the head of the room stood the rostrum, where sat a gentleman with an\nextremely charming face. He was engaged in selling by auction so rapidly\nthat the clerk at his side must have had difficulty in keeping a record\nof the lots and their purchasers. In front of him was a horseshoe table,\nround which sat buyers. The end of this table was left unoccupied so\nthat the porters might exhibit each lot before it was put up for sale.\nStanding under the rostrum was yet another table, a small one, upon\nwhich were about twenty pots of flowers, even more wonderful than\nthose on the large table. A notice stated that these would be sold at\none-thirty precisely. All about the room stood knots of men (such ladies\nas were present sat at the table), many of whom had lovely orchids\nin their buttonholes. These, I found out afterwards, were dealers and\namateurs. They were a kindly-faced set of people, and I took a liking to\nthem.\n\nThe whole place was quaint and pleasant, especially by contrast with\nthe horrible London fog outside. Squeezing my small person into a corner\nwhere I was in nobody's way, I watched the proceedings for a while.\nSuddenly an agreeable voice at my side asked me if I would like a look\nat the catalogue. I glanced at the speaker, and in a sense fell in love\nwith him at once--as I have explained before, I am one of those to whom\na first impression means a great deal. He was not very tall, though\nstrong-looking and well-made enough. He was not very handsome, though\nnone so ill-favoured. He was just an ordinary fair young Englishman,\nfour or five-and-twenty years of age, with merry blue eyes and one of\nthe pleasantest expressions that I ever saw. At once I felt that he\nwas a sympathetic soul and full of the milk of human kindness. He was\ndressed in a rough tweed suit rather worn, with the orchid that seemed\nto be the badge of all this tribe in his buttonhole. Somehow the costume\nsuited his rather pink and white complexion and rumpled fair hair, which\nI could see as he was sitting on his cloth hat.\n\n\"Thank you, no,\" I answered, \"I did not come here to buy. I know nothing\nabout orchids,\" I added by way of explanation, \"except a few I have seen\ngrowing in Africa, and this one,\" and I tapped the tin case which I held\nunder my arm.\n\n\"Indeed,\" he said. \"I should like to hear about the African orchids.\nWhat is it you have in the case, a plant or flowers?\"\n\n\"One flower only. It is not mine. A friend in Africa asked me to--well,\nthat is a long story which might not interest you.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure. I suppose it must be a Cymbidium scape from the size.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"That's not the name my friend mentioned. He called it\na Cypripedium.\"\n\nThe young man began to grow curious. \"One Cypripedium in all that large\ncase? It must be a big flower.\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend said it is the biggest ever found. It measures\ntwenty-four inches across the wings, petals I think he called them, and\nabout a foot across the back part.\"\n\n\"Twenty-four inches across the petals and a foot across the dorsal\nsepal!\" said the young man in a kind of gasp, \"and a Cypripedium! Sir,\nsurely you are joking?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" I answered indignantly, \"I am doing nothing of the sort. Your\nremark is tantamount to telling me that I am speaking a falsehood. But,\nof course, for all I know, the thing may be some other kind of flower.\"\n\n\"Let me see it. In the name of the goddess Flora let me see it!\"\n\nI began to undo the case. Indeed it was already half-open when two other\ngentlemen, who had either overheard some of our conversation or noted my\ncompanion's excited look, edged up to us. I observed that they also wore\norchids in their buttonholes.\n\n\"Hullo! Somers,\" said one of them in a tone of false geniality, \"what\nhave you got there?\"\n\n\"What has your friend got there?\" asked the other.\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied the young man who had been addressed as Somers,\n\"nothing at all; that is--only a case of tropical butterflies.\"\n\n\"Oh! butterflies,\" said No. 1 and sauntered away. But No. 2, a\nkeen-looking person with the eye of a hawk, was not so easily satisfied.\n\n\"Let us see these butterflies,\" he said to me.\n\n\"You can't,\" ejaculated the young man. \"My friend is afraid lest the\ndamp should injure their colours. Ain't you, Brown?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am, Somers,\" I replied, taking his cue and shutting the tin case\nwith a snap.\n\nThen the hawk-eyed person departed, also grumbling, for that story about\nthe damp stuck in his throat.\n\n\"Orchidist!\" whispered the young man. \"Dreadful people, orchidists, so\njealous. Very rich, too, both of them. Mr. Brown--I hope that is your\nname, though I admit the chances are against it.\"\n\n\"They are,\" I replied, \"my name is Allan Quatermain.\"\n\n\"Ah! much better than Brown. Well, Mr. Allan Quatermain, there's a\nprivate room in this place to which I have admittance. Would you mind\ncoming with that----\" here the hawk-eyed gentleman strolled past again,\n\"that case of butterflies?\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" I answered, and followed him out of the auction chamber\ndown some steps through the door to the left, and ultimately into a\nlittle cupboard-like room lined with shelves full of books and ledgers.\n\nHe closed the door and locked it.\n\n\"Now,\" he said in a tone of the villain in a novel who at last has\ncome face to face with the virtuous heroine, \"now we are alone. Mr.\nQuatermain, let me see--those butterflies.\"\n\nI placed the case on a deal table which stood under a skylight in the\nroom. I opened it; I removed the cover of wadding, and there,\npressed between two sheets of glass and quite uninjured after all its\njourneyings, appeared the golden flower, glorious even in death, and by\nits side the broad green leaf.\n\nThe young gentleman called Somers looked at it till I thought his eyes\nwould really start out of his head. He turned away muttering something\nand looked again.\n\n\"Oh! Heavens,\" he said at last, \"oh! Heavens, is it possible that such\na thing can exist in this imperfect world? You haven't faked it, Mr.\nHalf--I mean Quatermain, have you?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" I said, \"for the second time you are making insinuations. Good\nmorning,\" and I began to shut up the case.\n\n\"Don't be offhanded,\" he exclaimed. \"Pity the weaknesses of a poor\nsinner. You don't understand. If only you understood, you would\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I am bothered if I do.\"\n\n\"Well, you will when you begin to collect orchids. I'm not mad, really,\nexcept perhaps on this point, Mr. Quatermain,\"--this in a low and\nthrilling voice--\"that marvellous Cypripedium--your friend is right, it\nis a Cypripedium--is worth a gold mine.\"\n\n\"From my experience of gold mines I can well believe that,\" I said\ntartly, and, I may add, prophetically.\n\n\"Oh! I mean a gold mine in the figurative and colloquial sense, not as\nthe investor knows it,\" he answered. \"That is, the plant on which it\ngrew is priceless. Where is the plant, Mr. Quatermain?\"\n\n\"In a rather indefinite locality in Africa east by south,\" I replied. \"I\ncan't place it to within three hundred miles.\"\n\n\"That's vague, Mr. Quatermain. I have no right to ask it, seeing that\nyou know nothing of me, but I assure you I am respectable, and in short,\nwould you mind telling me the story of this flower?\"\n\n\"I don't think I should,\" I replied, a little doubtfully. Then, after\nanother good look at him, suppressing all names and exact localities,\nI gave him the outline of the tale, explaining that I wanted to find\nsomeone who would finance an expedition to the remote and romantic spot\nwhere this particular Cypripedium was believed to grow.\n\nJust as I finished my narrative, and before he had time to comment on\nit, there came a violent knocking at the door.\n\n\"Mr. Stephen,\" said a voice, \"are you there, Mr. Stephen?\"\n\n\"By Jove! that's Briggs,\" exclaimed the young man. \"Briggs is my\nfather's manager. Shut up the case, Mr. Quatermain. Come in, Briggs,\" he\nwent on, unlocking the door slowly. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"It is a good deal,\" replied a thin and agitated person who thrust\nhimself through the opening door. \"Your father, I mean Sir Alexander,\nhas come to the office unexpectedly and is in a nice taking because he\ndidn't find you there, sir. When he discovered that you had gone to the\norchid sale he grew furious, sir, furious, and sent me to fetch you.\"\n\n\"Did he?\" replied Mr. Somers in an easy and unruffled tone. \"Well, tell\nSir Alexander I am coming at once. Now please go, Briggs, and tell him I\nam coming at once.\"\n\nBriggs departed not too willingly.\n\n\"I must leave you, Mr. Quatermain,\" said Mr. Somers as he shut the door\nbehind him. \"But will you promise me not to show that flower to anyone\nuntil I return? I'll be back within half an hour.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Somers. I'll wait half an hour for you in the sale room, and I\npromise that no one shall see that flower till you return.\"\n\n\"Thank you. You are a good fellow, and I promise you shall lose nothing\nby your kindness if I can help it.\"\n\nWe went together into the sale room, where some thought suddenly struck\nMr. Somers.\n\n\"By Jove!\" he said, \"I nearly forgot about that Odontoglossum. Where's\nWoodden? Oh! come here, Woodden, I want to speak to you.\"\n\nThe person called Woodden obeyed. He was a man of about fifty,\nindefinite in colouring, for his eyes were very light-blue or grey and\nhis hair was sandy, tough-looking and strongly made, with big hands that\nshowed signs of work, for the palms were horny and the nails worn down.\nHe was clad in a suit of shiny black, such as folk of the labouring\nclass wear at a funeral. I made up my mind at once that he was a\ngardener.\n\n\"Woodden,\" said Mr. Somers, \"this gentleman here has got the most\nwonderful orchid in the whole world. Keep your eye on him and see that\nhe isn't robbed. There are people in this room, Mr. Quatermain, who\nwould murder you and throw your body into the Thames for that flower,\"\nhe added, darkly.\n\nOn receipt of this information Woodden rocked a little on his feet as\nthough he felt the premonitory movements of an earthquake. It was a\nhabit of his whenever anything astonished him. Then, fixing his pale\neye upon me in a way which showed that my appearance surprised him, he\npulled a lock of his sandy hair with his thumb and finger and said:\n\n\"'Servant, sir, and where might this horchid be?\"\n\nI pointed to the tin case.\n\n\"Yes, it's there,\" went on Mr. Somers, \"and that's what you've got to\nwatch. Mr. Quatermain, if anyone attempts to rob you, call for Woodden\nand he will knock them down. He's my gardener, you know, and entirely to\nbe trusted, especially if it is a matter of knocking anyone down.\"\n\n\"Aye, I'll knock him down surely,\" said Woodden, doubling his great fist\nand looking round him with a suspicious eye.\n\n\"Now listen, Woodden. Have you looked at that Odontoglossum Pavo, and if\nso, what do you think of it?\" and he nodded towards a plant which stood\nin the centre of the little group that was placed on the small table\nbeneath the auctioneer's desk. It bore a spray of the most lovely white\nflowers. On the top petal (if it is a petal), and also on the lip of\neach of these rounded flowers was a blotch or spot of which the general\neffect was similar to the iridescent eye on the tail feathers of a\npeacock, whence, I suppose, the flower was named \"Pavo,\" or Peacock.\n\n\"Yes, master, and I think it the beautifullest thing that ever I saw.\nThere isn't a 'glossum in England like that there 'glossum Paving,\"\nhe added with conviction, and rocked again as he said the word. \"But\nthere's plenty after it. I say they're a-smelling round that blossom\nlike, like--dawgs round a rat hole. And\" (this triumphantly) \"they don't\ndo that for nothing.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Woodden, you have got a logical mind. But, look here, we must\nhave that 'Pavo' whatever it costs. Now the Governor has sent for me.\nI'll be back presently, but I might be detained. If so, you've got to\nbid on my behalf, for I daren't trust any of these agents. Here's your\nauthority,\" and he scribbled on a card, \"Woodden, my gardener, has\ndirections to bid for me.--S.S.\" \"Now, Woodden,\" he went on, when he\nhad given the card to an attendant who passed it up to the auctioneer,\n\"don't you make a fool of yourself and let that 'Pavo' slip through your\nfingers.\"\n\nIn another instant he was gone.\n\n\"What did the master say, sir?\" asked Woodden of me. \"That I was to get\nthat there 'Paving' whatever it cost?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"that's what he said. I suppose it will fetch a good\ndeal--several pounds.\"\n\n\"Maybe, sir, can't tell. All I know is that I've got to buy it as you\ncan bear me witness. Master, he ain't one to be crossed for money. What\nhe wants, he'll have, that is if it be in the orchid line.\"\n\n\"I suppose you are fond of orchids, too, Mr. Woodden?\"\n\n\"Fond of them, sir? Why, I loves 'em!\" (Here he rocked.) \"Don't feel for\nnothing else in the same way; not even for my old woman\" (then with a\nburst of enthusiasm) \"no, not even for the master himself, and I'm fond\nenough of him, God knows! But, begging your pardon, sir\" (with a pull\nat his forelock), \"would you mind holding that tin of yours a little\ntighter? I've got to keep an eye on that as well as on 'O. Paving,' and\nI just see'd that chap with the tall hat alooking at it suspicious.\"\n\nAfter this we separated. I retired into my corner, while Woodden took\nhis stand by the table, with one eye fixed on what he called the \"O.\nPaving\" and the other on me and my tin case.\n\nAn odd fish truly, I thought to myself. Positive, the old woman;\nComparative, his master; Superlative, the orchid tribe. Those were his\ndegrees of affection. Honest and brave and a good fellow though, I bet.\n\nThe sale languished. There were so many lots of one particular sort of\ndried orchid that buyers could not be found for them at a reasonable\nprice, and many had to be bought in. At length the genial Mr. Primrose\nin the rostrum addressed the audience.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I quite understand that you didn't come here\nto-day to buy a rather poor lot of Cattleya Mossi\u00e6. You came to buy,\nor to bid for, or to see sold the most wonderful Odontoglossum that has\never been flowered in this country, the property of a famous firm of\nimporters whom I congratulate upon their good fortune in having obtained\nsuch a gem. Gentlemen, this miraculous flower ought to adorn a royal\ngreenhouse. But there it is, to be taken away by whoever will pay the\nmost for it, for I am directed to see that it will be sold without\nreserve. Now, I think,\" he added, running his eye over the company,\n\"that most of our great collectors are represented in this room to-day.\nIt is true that I do not see that spirited and liberal young orchidist,\nMr. Somers, but he has left his worthy head-gardener, Mr. Woodden, than\nwhom there is no finer judge of an orchid in England\" (here Woodden\nrocked violently) \"to bid for him, as I hope, for the glorious flower of\nwhich I have been speaking. Now, as it is exactly half-past one, we will\nproceed to business. Smith, hand the 'Odontoglossum Pavo' round, that\neveryone may inspect its beauties, and be careful you don't let it fall.\nGentlemen, I must ask you not to touch it or to defile its purity with\ntobacco smoke. Eight perfect flowers in bloom, gentlemen, and four--no,\nfive more to open. A strong plant in perfect health, six pseudo-bulbs\nwith leaves, and three without. Two black leads which I am advised\ncan be separated off at the proper time. Now, what bids for the\n'Odontoglossum Pavo.' Ah! I wonder who will have the honour of becoming\nthe owner of this perfect, this unmatched production of Nature. Thank\nyou, sir--three hundred. Four. Five. Six. Seven in three places. Eight.\nNine. Ten. Oh! gentlemen, let us get on a little faster. Thank you,\nsir--fifteen. Sixteen. It is against you, Mr Woodden. Ah! thank you,\nseventeen.\"\n\nThere came a pause in the fierce race for \"O. Pavo,\" which I occupied in\nreducing seventeen hundred shillings to pounds sterling.\n\nMy word! I thought to myself, \u00a385 is a goodish price to pay for one\nplant, however rare. Woodden is acting up to his instructions with a\nvengeance.\n\nThe pleading voice of Mr. Primrose broke in upon my meditations.\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen!\" he said, \"surely you are not going to allow the\nmost wondrous production of the floral world, on which I repeat there\nis no reserve, to be knocked down at this miserable figure. Come, come.\nWell, if I must, I must, though after such a disgrace I shall get no\nsleep to-night. One,\" and his hammer fell for the first time. \"Think,\ngentlemen, upon my position, think what the eminent owners, who with\ntheir usual delicacy have stayed away, will say to me when I am obliged\nto tell them the disgraceful truth. Two,\" and his hammer fell a second\ntime. \"Smith, hold up that flower. Let the company see it. Let them know\nwhat they are losing.\"\n\nSmith held up the flower at which everybody glared. The little ivory\nhammer circled round Mr. Primrose's head. It was about to fall, when a\nquiet man with a long beard who hitherto had not joined in the bidding,\nlifted his head and said softly:\n\n\"Eighteen hundred.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Mr. Primrose, \"I thought so. I thought that the owner of\nthe greatest collection in England would not see this treasure slip from\nhis grasp without a struggle. Against you, Mr. Woodden.\"\n\n\"Nineteen, sir,\" said Woodden in a stony voice.\n\n\"Two thousand,\" echoed the gentleman with the long beard.\n\n\"Twenty-one hundred,\" said Woodden.\n\n\"That's right, Mr. Woodden,\" cried Mr. Primrose, \"you are indeed\nrepresenting your principal worthily. I feel sure that you do not mean\nto stop for a few miserable pounds.\"\n\n\"Not if I knows it,\" ejaculated Woodden. \"I has my orders and I acts up\nto them.\"\n\n\"Twenty-two hundred,\" said Long-beard.\n\n\"Twenty-three,\" echoed Woodden.\n\n\"Oh, damn!\" shouted Long-beard and rushed from the room.\n\n\"'Odontoglossum Pavo' is going for twenty-three hundred, only\ntwenty-tree hundred,\" cried the auctioneer. \"Any advance on twenty-three\nhundred? What? None? Then I must do my duty. One. Two. For the last\ntime--no advance? Three. Gone to Mr. Woodden, bidding for his principal,\nMr. Somers.\"\n\nThe hammer fell with a sharp tap, and at this moment my young friend\nsauntered into the room.\n\n\"Well, Woodden,\" he said, \"have they put the 'Pavo' up yet?\"\n\n\"It's up and it's down, sir. I've bought him right enough.\"\n\n\"The deuce you have! What did it fetch?\"\n\nWoodden scratched his head.\n\n\"I don't rightly know, sir, never was good at figures, not having much\nbook learning, but it's twenty-three something.\"\n\n\"\u00a323? No, it would have brought more than that. By Jingo! it must be\n\u00a3230. That's pretty stiff, but still, it may be worth it.\"\n\nAt this moment Mr. Primrose, who, leaning over his desk, was engaged in\nanimated conversation with an excited knot of orchid fanciers, looked\nup:\n\n\"Oh! there you are, Mr. Somers,\" he said. \"In the name of all this\ncompany let me congratulate you on having become the owner of the\nmatchless 'Odontoglossum Pavo' for what, under all the circumstances, I\nconsider the quite moderate price of \u00a32,300.\"\n\nReally that young man took it very well. He shivered slightly and turned\na little pale, that is all. Woodden rocked to and fro like a tree about\nto fall. I and my tin box collapsed together in the corner. Yes, I was\nso surprised that my legs seemed to give way under me. People began to\ntalk, but above the hum of the conversation I heard young Somers say in\na low voice:\n\n\"Woodden, you're a born fool.\" Also the answer: \"That's what my mother\nalways told me, master, and she ought to know if anyone did. But what's\nwrong now? I obeyed orders and bought 'O. Paving.'\"\n\n\"Yes. Don't bother, my good fellow, it's my fault, not yours. I'm the\nborn fool. But heavens above! how am I to face this?\" Then, recovering\nhimself, he strolled up to the rostrum and said a few words to the\nauctioneer. Mr. Primrose nodded, and I heard him answer:\n\n\"Oh, that will be all right, sir, don't bother. We can't expect an\naccount like this to be settled in a minute. A month hence will do.\"\n\nThen he went on with the sale.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n                      SIR ALEXANDER AND STEPHEN\n\nIt was just at this moment that I saw standing by me a fine-looking,\nstout man with a square, grey beard and a handsome, but not very\ngood-tempered face. He was looking about him as one does who finds\nhimself in a place to which he is not accustomed.\n\n\"Perhaps you could tell me, sir,\" he said to me, \"whether a gentleman\ncalled Mr. Somers is in this room. I am rather short-sighted and there\nare a great many people.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"he has just bought the wonderful orchid called\n'Odontoglossum Pavo.' That is what they are all talking about.\"\n\n\"Oh, has he? Has he indeed? And pray what did he pay for the article?\"\n\n\"A huge sum,\" I answered. \"I thought it was two thousand three hundred\nshillings, but it appears it was \u00a32,300.\"\n\nThe handsome, elderly gentleman grew very red in the face, so red that\nI thought he was going to have a fit. For a few moments he breathed\nheavily.\n\n\"A rival collector,\" I thought to myself, and went on with the story\nwhich, it occurred to me, might interest him.\n\n\"You see, the young gentleman was called away to an interview with his\nfather. I heard him instruct his gardener, a man named Woodden, to buy\nthe plant at any price.\"\n\n\"At any price! Indeed. Very interesting; continue, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, the gardener bought it, that's all, after tremendous competition.\nLook, there he is packing it up. Whether his master meant him to go as\nfar as he did I rather doubt. But here he comes. If you know him----\"\n\nThe youthful Mr. Somers, looking a little pale and _distrait_, strolled\nup apparently to speak to me; his hands were in his pockets and an\nunlighted cigar was in his mouth. His eyes fell upon the elderly\ngentleman, a sight that caused him to shape his lips as though to\nwhistle and drop the cigar.\n\n\"Hullo, father,\" he said in his pleasant voice. \"I got your message\nand have been looking for you, but never thought that I should find you\nhere. Orchids aren't much in your line, are they?\"\n\n\"Didn't you, indeed!\" replied his parent in a choked voice. \"No, I\nhaven't much use for--this stinking rubbish,\" and he waved his umbrella\nat the beautiful flowers. \"But it seems that you have, Stephen.\nThis little gentlemen here tells me you have just bought a very fine\nspecimen.\"\n\n\"I must apologize,\" I broke in, addressing Mr. Somers. \"I had not the\nslightest idea that this--big gentleman,\" here the son smiled faintly,\n\"was your intimate relation.\"\n\n\"Oh! pray don't, Mr. Quatermain. Why should you not speak of what will\nbe in all the papers. Yes, father, I have bought a very fine specimen,\nthe finest known, or at least Woodden has on my behalf, while I was\nhunting for you, which comes to the same thing.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Stephen, and what did you pay for this flower? I have heard a\nfigure, but think that there must be some mistake.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you heard, father, but it seems to have been knocked\ndown to me at \u00a32,300. It's a lot more than I can find, indeed, and I was\ngoing to ask you to lend me the money for the sake of the family credit,\nif not for my own. But we can talk about that afterwards.\"\n\n\"Yes, Stephen, we can talk of that afterwards. In fact, as there is no\ntime like the present, we will talk of it now. Come to my office.\nAnd, sir\" (this was to me) \"as you seem to know something of the\ncircumstances, I will ask you to come also; and you too, Blockhead\"\n(this was to Woodden, who just then approached with the plant).\n\nNow, of course, I might have refused an invitation conveyed in such a\nmanner. But, as a matter of fact, I didn't. I wanted to see the thing\nout; also to put in a word for young Somers, if I got the chance. So\nwe all departed from that room, followed by a titter of amusement from\nthose of the company who had overheard the conversation. In the street\nstood a splendid carriage and pair; a powdered footman opened its door.\nWith a ferocious bow Sir Alexander motioned to me to enter, which I did,\ntaking one of the back seats as it gave more room for my tin case. Then\ncame Mr. Stephen, then Woodden bundled in holding the precious plant\nin front of him like a wand of office, and last of all, Sir Alexander,\nhaving seen us safe, entered also.\n\n\"Where to, sir?\" asked the footman.\n\n\"Office,\" he snapped, and we started.\n\nFour disappointed relatives in a funeral coach could not have been more\nsilent. Our feelings seemed to be too deep for words. Sir Alexander,\nhowever, did make one remark and to me. It was:\n\n\"If you will remove the corner of that infernal tin box of yours from my\nribs I shall be obliged to you, sir.\"\n\n\"Your pardon,\" I exclaimed, and in my efforts to be accommodating,\ndropped it on his toe. I will not repeat the remark he made, but I may\nexplain that he was gouty. His son suddenly became afflicted with a\nsense of the absurdity of the situation. He kicked me on the shin, he\neven dared to wink, and then began to swell visibly with suppressed\nlaughter. I was in agony, for if he had exploded I do not know what\nwould have happened. Fortunately, at this moment the carriage stopped at\nthe door of a fine office. Without waiting for the footman Mr. Stephen\nbundled out and vanished into the building--I suppose to laugh in\nsafety. Then I descended with the tin case; then, by command, followed\nWoodden with the flower, and lastly came Sir Alexander.\n\n\"Stop here,\" he said to the coachman; \"I shan't be long. Be so good as\nto follow me, Mr. What's-your-name, and you, too, Gardener.\"\n\nWe followed, and found ourselves in a big room luxuriously furnished\nin a heavy kind of way. Sir Alexander Somers, I should explain, was an\nenormously opulent bullion-broker, whatever a bullion-broker may be. In\nthis room Mr. Stephen was already established; indeed, he was seated on\nthe window-sill swinging his leg.\n\n\"Now we are alone and comfortable,\" growled Sir Alexander with sarcastic\nferocity.\n\n\"As the boa-constrictor said to the rabbit in the cage,\" I remarked.\n\nI did not mean to say it, but I had grown nervous, and the thought leapt\nfrom my lips in words. Again Mr. Stephen began to swell. He turned his\nface to the window as though to contemplate the wall beyond, but I\ncould see his shoulders shaking. A dim light of intelligence shone in\nWoodden's pale eyes. About three minutes later the joke got home. He\ngurgled something about boa-constrictors and rabbits and gave a short,\nloud laugh. As for Sir Alexander, he merely said:\n\n\"I did not catch your remark, sir, would you be so good as to repeat\nit?\"\n\nAs I appeared unwilling to accept the invitation, he went on:\n\n\"Perhaps, then, you would repeat what you told me in that sale-room?\"\n\n\"Why should I?\" I asked. \"I spoke quite clearly and you seemed to\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" replied Sir Alexander; \"to waste time is useless.\" He\nwheeled round on Woodden, who was standing near the door still holding\nthe paper-wrapped plant in front of him. \"Now, Blockhead,\" he shouted,\n\"tell me why you brought that thing.\"\n\nWoodden made no answer, only rocked a little. Sir Alexander reiterated\nhis command. This time Woodden set the plant upon a table and replied:\n\n\"If you're aspeaking to me, sir, that baint my name, and what's more, if\nyou calls me so again, I'll punch your head, whoever you be,\" and very\ndeliberately he rolled up the sleeves on his brawny arms, a sight at\nwhich I too began to swell with inward merriment.\n\n\"Look here, father,\" said Mr. Stephen, stepping forward. \"What's the use\nof all this? The thing's perfectly plain. I did tell Woodden to buy the\nplant at any price. What is more I gave him a written authority which\nwas passed up to the auctioneer. There's no getting out of it. It\nis true it never occurred to me that it would go for anything like\n\u00a32,300--the odd \u00a3300 was more my idea, but Woodden only obeyed his\norders, and ought not to be abused for doing so.\"\n\n\"There's what I call a master worth serving,\" remarked Woodden.\n\n\"Very well, young man,\" said Sir Alexander, \"you have purchased this\narticle. Will you be so good as to tell me how you propose it should be\npaid for.\"\n\n\"I propose, father, that you should pay for it,\" replied Mr. Stephen\nsweetly. \"Two thousand three hundred pounds, or ten times that amount,\nwould not make you appreciably poorer. But if, as is probable, you take\na different view, then I propose to pay for it myself. As you know a\ncertain sum of money came to me under my mother's will in which you have\nonly a life interest. I shall raise the amount upon that security--or\notherwise.\"\n\nIf Sir Alexander had been angry before, now he became like a mad bull\nin a china shop. He pranced round the room; he used language that should\nnot pass the lips of any respectable merchant of bullion; in short, he\ndid everything that a person in his position ought not to do. When he\nwas tired he rushed to a desk, tore a cheque from a book and filled it\nin for a sum of \u00a32,300 to bearer, which cheque he blotted, crumpled up\nand literally threw at the head of his son.\n\n\"You worthless, idle young scoundrel,\" he bellowed. \"I put you in this\noffice here that you may learn respectable and orderly habits and in due\ncourse succeed to a very comfortable business. What happens? You don't\ntake a ha'porth of interest in bullion-broking, a subject of which I\nbelieve you to remain profoundly ignorant. You don't even spend your\nmoney, or rather my money, upon any gentleman-like vice, such as\nhorse-racing, or cards, or even--well, never mind. No, you take to\nflowers, miserable, beastly flowers, things that a cow eats and clerks\ngrow in back gardens.\"\n\n\"An ancient and Arcadian taste. Adam is supposed to have lived in a\ngarden,\" I ventured to interpolate.\n\n\"Perhaps you would ask your friend with the stubbly hair to remain\nquiet,\" snorted Sir Alexander. \"I was about to add, although for the\nsake of my name I meet your debts, that I have had enough of this kind\nof thing. I disinherit you, or will do if I live till 4 p.m. when the\nlawyer's office shuts, for thank God! there are no entailed estates, and\nI dismiss you from the firm. You can go and earn your living in any\nway you please, by orchid-hunting if you like.\" He paused, gasping for\nbreath.\n\n\"Is that all, father?\" asked Mr. Stephen, producing a cigar from his\npocket.\n\n\"No, it isn't, you cold-blooded young beggar. That house you occupy at\nTwickenham is mine. You will be good enough to clear out of it; I wish\nto take possession.\"\n\n\"I suppose, father, I am entitled to a week's notice like any other\ntenant,\" said Mr. Stephen, lighting the cigar. \"In fact,\" he added, \"if\nyou answer no, I think I shall ask you to apply for an ejection order.\nYou will understand that I have arrangements to make before taking a\nfresh start in life.\"\n\n\"Oh! curse your cheek, you--you--cucumber!\" raged the infuriated\nmerchant prince. Then an inspiration came to him. \"You think more of an\nugly flower than of your father, do you? Well, at least I'll put an end\nto that,\" and he made a dash at the plant on the table with the evident\nintention of destroying the same.\n\nBut the watching Woodden saw. With a kind of lurch he interposed his big\nframe between Sir Alexander and the object of his wrath.\n\n\"Touch 'O. Paving' and I knocks yer down,\" he drawled out.\n\nSir Alexander looked at \"O. Paving,\" then he looked at Woodden's\nleg-of-mutton fist, and--changed his mind.\n\n\"Curse 'O. Paving,'\" he said, \"and everyone who has to do with it,\" and\nswung out of the room, banging the door behind him.\n\n\"Well, that's over,\" said Mr. Stephen gently, as he fanned himself with\na pocket-handkerchief. \"Quite exciting while it lasted, wasn't it, Mr.\nQuatermain--but I have been there before, so to speak. And now what do\nyou say to some luncheon? Pym's is close by, and they have very good\noysters. Only I think we'll drive round by the bank and hand in this\ncheque. When he's angry my parent is capable of anything. He might even\nstop it. Woodden, get off down to Twickenham with 'O. Pavo.' Keep it\nwarm, for it feels rather like frost. Put it in the stove for to-night\nand give it a little, just a little tepid water, but be careful not to\ntouch the flower. Take a four-wheeled cab, it's slow but safe, and mind\nyou keep the windows up and don't smoke. I shall be home for dinner.\"\n\nWoodden pulled his forelock, seized the pot in his left hand, and\ndeparted with his right fist raised--I suppose in case Sir Alexander\nshould be waiting for him round the corner.\n\nThen we departed also and, after stopping for a minute at the bank\nto pay in the cheque, which I noted, notwithstanding its amount, was\naccepted without comment, ate oysters in a place too crowded to allow of\nconversation.\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain,\" said my host, \"it is obvious that we cannot talk here,\nand much less look at that orchid of yours, which I want to study at\nleisure. Now, for a week or so at any rate I have a roof over my head,\nand in short, will you be my guest for a night or two? I know nothing\nabout you, and of me you only know that I am the disinherited son of a\nfather, to whom I have failed to give satisfaction. Still it is possible\nthat we might pass a few pleasant hours together talking of flowers and\nother things; that is, if you have no previous engagement.\"\n\n\"I have none,\" I answered. \"I am only a stranger from South Africa\nlodging at an hotel. If you will give me time to call for my bag, I will\npass the night at your house with pleasure.\"\n\nBy the aid of Mr. Somers' smart dog-cart, which was waiting at a city\nmews, we reached Twickenham while there was still half an hour of\ndaylight. The house, which was called Verbena Lodge, was small, a\nsquare, red-brick building of the early Georgian period, but the gardens\ncovered quite an acre of ground and were very beautiful, or must have\nbeen so in summer. Into the greenhouse we did not enter, because it was\ntoo late to see the flowers. Also, just when we came to them, Woodden\narrived in his four-wheeled cab and departed with his master to see to\nthe housing of \"O. Pavo.\"\n\nThen came dinner, a very pleasant meal. My host had that day been turned\nout upon the world, but he did not allow this circumstance to interfere\nwith his spirits in the least. Also he was evidently determined to\nenjoy its good things while they lasted, for his champagne and port were\nexcellent.\n\n\"You see, Mr. Quatermain,\" he said, \"it's just as well we had the row\nwhich has been boiling up for a long while. My respected father has made\nso much money that he thinks I should go and do likewise. Now I don't\nsee it. I like flowers, especially orchids, and I hate bullion-broking.\nTo me the only decent places in London are that sale-room where we met\nand the Horticultural Gardens.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered rather doubtfully, \"but the matter seems a little\nserious. Your parent was very emphatic as to his intentions, and after\nthis kind of thing,\" and I pointed to the beautiful silver and the port,\n\"how will you like roughing it in a hard world?\"\n\n\"Don't think I shall mind a bit; it would be rather a pleasant change.\nAlso, even if my father doesn't alter his mind, as he may, for he likes\nme at bottom because I resemble my dear mother, things ain't so very\nbad. I have got some money that she left me, \u00a36,000 or \u00a37,000, and I'll\nsell that 'Odontoglossum Pavo' for what it will fetch to Sir Joshua\nTredgold--he was the man with the long beard who you tell me ran up\nWoodden to over \u00a32,000--or failing him to someone else. I'll write\nabout it to-night. I don't think I have any debts to speak of, for the\nGovernor has been allowing me \u00a33,000 a year, at least that is my share\nof the profits paid to me in return for my bullion-broking labours, and\nexcept flowers, I have no expensive tastes. So the devil take the past,\nhere's to the future and whatever it may bring,\" and he polished off the\nglass of port he held and laughed in his jolly fashion.\n\nReally he was a most attractive young man, a little reckless, it is\ntrue, but then recklessness and youth mix well, like brandy and soda.\n\nI echoed the toast and drank off my port, for I like a good glass of\nwine when I can get it, as would anyone who has had to live for months\non rotten water, although I admit that agrees with me better than the\nport.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Quatermain,\" he went on, \"if you have done, light your pipe\nand let's go into the other room and study that Cypripedium of yours. I\nshan't sleep to-night unless I see it again first. Stop a bit, though,\nwe'll get hold of that old ass, Woodden, before he turns in.\"\n\n\"Woodden,\" said his master, when the gardener had arrived, \"this\ngentleman, Mr. Quatermain, is going to show you an orchid that is ten\ntimes finer than 'O. Pavo!'\"\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" answered Woodden, \"but if Mr. Quatermain says that,\nhe lies. It ain't in Nature; it don't bloom nowhere.\"\n\nI opened the case and revealed the golden Cypripedium. Woodden stared at\nit and rocked. Then he stared again and felt his head as though to make\nsure it was on his shoulders. Then he gasped.\n\n\"Well, if that there flower baint made up, it's a MASTER ONE! If I could\nsee that there flower ablowing on the plant I'd die happy.\"\n\n\"Woodden, stop talking, and sit down,\" exclaimed his master. \"Yes,\nthere, where you can look at the flower. Now, Mr. Quatermain, will\nyou tell us the story of that orchid from beginning to end. Of course\nomitting its habitat if you like, for it isn't fair to ask that secret.\nWoodden can be trusted to hold his tongue, and so can I.\"\n\nI remarked that I was sure they could, and for the next half-hour talked\nalmost without interruption, keeping nothing back and explaining that\nI was anxious to find someone who would finance an expedition to search\nfor this particular plant; as I believed, the only one of its sort that\nexisted in the world.\n\n\"How much will it cost?\" asked Mr. Somers.\n\n\"I lay it at \u00a32,000,\" I answered. \"You see, we must have plenty of men\nand guns and stores, also trade goods and presents.\"\n\n\"I call that cheap. But supposing, Mr. Quatermain, that the expedition\nproves successful and the plant is secured, what then?\"\n\n\"Then I propose that Brother John, who found it and of whom I have told\nyou, should take one-third of whatever it might sell for, that I as\ncaptain of the expedition should take one-third, and that whoever finds\nthe necessary money should take the remaining third.\"\n\n\"Good! That's settled.\"\n\n\"What's settled?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, that we should divide in the proportions you named, only I bargain\nto be allowed to take my whack in kind--I mean in plant, and to have the\nfirst option of purchasing the rest of the plant at whatever value may\nbe agreed upon.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Somers, do you mean that you wish to find \u00a32,000 and make this\nexpedition in person?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. I thought you understood that. That is, if you will\nhave me. Your old friend, the lunatic, you and I will together seek for\nand find this golden flower. I say that's settled.\"\n\nOn the morrow accordingly, it was settled with the help of a document,\nsigned in duplicate by both of us.\n\nBefore these arrangements were finally concluded, however, I insisted\nthat Mr. Somers should meet my late companion, Charlie Scroope, when\nI was not present, in order that the latter might give him a full\nand particular report concerning myself. Apparently the interview\nwas satisfactory, at least so I judged from the very cordial and even\nrespectful manner in which young Somers met me after it was over. Also I\nthought it my duty to explain to him with much clearness in the presence\nof Scroope as a witness, the great dangers of such an enterprise as that\non which he proposed to embark. I told him straight out that he must be\nprepared to find his death in it from starvation, fever, wild beasts or\nat the hands of savages, while success was quite problematical and very\nlikely would not be attained.\n\n\"_You_ are taking these risks,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"but they are incident to the rough trade I follow,\nwhich is that of a hunter and explorer. Moreover, my youth is past,\nand I have gone through experiences and bereavements of which you know\nnothing, that cause me to set a very slight value on life. I care little\nwhether I die or continue in the world for some few added years. Lastly,\nthe excitement of adventure has become a kind of necessity for me. I\ndo not think that I could live in England for very long. Also I'm a\nfatalist. I believe that when my time comes I must go, that this hour is\nforeordained and that nothing I can do will either hasten or postpone it\nby one moment. Your circumstances are different. You are quite young.\nIf you stay here and approach your father in a proper spirit, I have\nno doubt but that he will forget all the rough words he said to you the\nother day, for which indeed you know you gave him some provocation. Is\nit worth while throwing up such prospects and undertaking such\ndangers for the chance of finding a rare flower? I say this to my own\ndisadvantage, since I might find it hard to discover anyone else who\nwould risk \u00a32,000 upon such a venture, but I do urge you to weigh my\nwords.\"\n\nYoung Somers looked at me for a little while, then he broke into one of\nhis hearty laughs and exclaimed, \"Whatever else you may be, Mr. Allan\nQuatermain, you are a gentleman. No bullion-broker in the City could\nhave put the matter more fairly in the teeth of his own interests.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\n\n\"For the rest,\" he went on, \"I too am tired of England and want to\nsee the world. It isn't the golden Cypripedium that I seek, although I\nshould like to win it well enough. That's only a symbol. What I seek are\nadventure and romance. Also, like you I am a fatalist. God chose His own\ntime to send us here, and I presume that He will choose His own time to\ntake us away again. So I leave the matter of risks to Him.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Somers,\" I replied rather solemnly. \"You may find adventure\nand romance, there are plenty of both in Africa. Or you may find a\nnameless grave in some fever-haunted swamp. Well, you have chosen, and I\nlike your spirit.\"\n\nStill I was so little satisfied about this business, that a week or so\nbefore we sailed, after much consideration, I took it upon myself to\nwrite a letter to Sir Alexander Somers, in which I set forth the whole\nmatter as clearly as I could, not blinking the dangerous nature of our\nundertaking. In conclusion, I asked him whether he thought it wise to\nallow his only son to accompany such an expedition, mainly because of a\nnot very serious quarrel with himself.\n\nAs no answer came to this letter I went on with our preparations.\nThere was money in plenty, since the re-sale of \"O. Pavo\" to Sir Joshua\nTredgold, at some loss, had been satisfactorily carried out, which\nenabled me to invest in all things needful with a cheerful heart. Never\nbefore had I been provided with such an outfit as that which preceded us\nto the ship.\n\nAt length the day of departure came. We stood on the platform at\nPaddington waiting for the Dartmouth train to start, for in those days\nthe African mail sailed from that port. A minute or two before the train\nleft, as we were preparing to enter our carriage I caught sight of\na face that I seemed to recognise, the owner of which was evidently\nsearching for someone in the crowd. It was that of Briggs, Sir\nAlexander's clerk, whom I had met in the sale-room.\n\n\"Mr. Briggs,\" I said as he passed me, \"are you looking for Mr. Somers?\nIf so, he is in here.\"\n\nThe clerk jumped into the compartment and handed a letter to Mr. Somers.\nThen he emerged again and waited. Somers read the letter and tore off a\nblank sheet from the end of it, on which he hastily wrote some words. He\npassed it to me to give to Briggs, and I could not help seeing what was\nwritten. It was: \"Too late now. God bless you, my dear father. I hope\nwe may meet again. If not, try to think kindly of your troublesome and\nfoolish son, Stephen.\"\n\nIn another minute the train had started.\n\n\"By the way,\" he said, as we steamed out of the station, \"I have heard\nfrom my father, who enclosed this for you.\"\n\nI opened the envelope, which was addressed in a bold, round hand that\nseemed to me typical of the writer, and read as follows:\n\n\n \"My Dear Sir,--I appreciate the motives which caused you to write\n  to me and I thank you very heartily for your letter, which shows\n  me that you are a man of discretion and strict honour. As you\n  surmise, the expedition on which my son has entered is not one\n  that commends itself to me as prudent. Of the differences between\n  him and myself you are aware, for they came to a climax in your\n  presence. Indeed, I feel that I owe you an apology for having\n  dragged you into an unpleasant family quarrel. Your letter only\n  reached me to-day having been forwarded to my place in the country\n  from my office. I should have at once come to town, but\n  unfortunately I am laid up with an attack of gout which makes it\n  impossible for me to stir. Therefore, the only thing I can do is\n  to write to my son hoping that the letter which I send by a\n  special messenger will reach him in time and avail to alter his\n  determination to undertake this journey. Here I may add that\n  although I have differed and do differ from him on various points,\n  I still have a deep affection for my son and earnestly desire his\n  welfare. The prospect of any harm coming to him is one upon which\n  I cannot bear to dwell.\n\n \"Now I am aware that any change of his plans at this eleventh hour\n  would involve you in serious loss and inconvenience. I beg to\n  inform you formally, therefore, that in this event I will make\n  good everything and will in addition write off the \u00a32,000 which I\n  understand he has invested in your joint venture. It may be,\n  however, that my son, who has in him a vein of my own obstinacy,\n  will refuse to change his mind. In that event, under a Higher\n  Power I can only commend him to your care and beg that you will\n  look after him as though he were your own child. I can ask and you\n  can do no more. Tell him to write me as opportunity offers, as\n  perhaps you will too; also that, although I hate the sight of\n  them, I will look after the flowers which he has left at the house\n  at Twickenham.--\n\n                        \"Your obliged servant, ALEXANDER SOMERS.\"\n\n\nThis letter touched me much, and indeed made me feel very uncomfortable.\nWithout a word I handed it to my companion, who read it through\ncarefully.\n\n\"Nice of him about the orchids,\" he said. \"My dad has a good heart,\nalthough he lets his temper get the better of him, having had his own\nway all his life.\"\n\n\"Well, what will you do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Go on, of course. I've put my hand to the plough and I am not going\nto turn back. I should be a cur if I did, and what's more, whatever\nhe might say he'd think none the better of me. So please don't try to\npersuade me, it would be no good.\"\n\nFor quite a while afterwards young Somers seemed to be comparatively\ndepressed, a state of mind that in his case was rare indeed. At last,\nhe studied the wintry landscape through the carriage window and\nsaid nothing. By degrees, however, he recovered, and when we reached\nDartmouth was as cheerful as ever, a mood that I could not altogether\nshare.\n\nBefore we sailed I wrote to Sir Alexander telling him exactly how things\nstood, and so I think did his son, though he never showed me the letter.\n\nAt Durban, just as we were about to start up country, I received an\nanswer from him, sent by some boat that followed us very closely. In\nit he said that he quite understood the position, and whatever happened\nwould attribute no blame to me, whom he should always regard with\nfriendly feelings. He told me that, in the event of any difficulty or\nwant of money, I was to draw on him for whatever might be required, and\nthat he had advised the African Bank to that effect. Further, he added,\nthat at least his son had shown grit in this matter, for which he\nrespected him.\n\nAnd now for a long while I must bid good-bye to Sir Alexander Somers and\nall that has to do with England.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n                           MAVOVO AND HANS\n\nWe arrived safely at Durban at the beginning of March and took up our\nquarters at my house on the Berea, where I expected that Brother John\nwould be awaiting us. But no Brother John was to be found. The old, lame\nGriqua, Jack, who looked after the place for me and once had been one of\nmy hunters, said that shortly after I went away in the ship, Dogeetah,\nas he called him, had taken his tin box and his net and walked off\ninland, he knew not where, leaving, as he declared, no message or letter\nbehind him. The cases full of butterflies and dried plants were also\ngone, but these, I found he had shipped to some port in America, by a\nsailing vessel bound for the United States which chanced to put in at\nDurban for food and water. As to what had become of the man himself I\ncould get no clue. He had been seen at Maritzburg and, according to some\nKaffirs whom I knew, afterwards on the borders of Zululand, where, so\nfar as I could learn, he vanished into space.\n\nThis, to say the least of it, was disconcerting, and a question arose\nas to what was to be done. Brother John was to have been our guide. He\nalone knew the Mazitu people; he alone had visited the borders of the\nmysterious Pongo-land, I scarcely felt inclined to attempt to reach that\ncountry without his aid.\n\nWhen a fortnight had gone by and still there were no signs of him,\nStephen and I held a solemn conference. I pointed out the difficulties\nand dangers of the situation to him and suggested that, under the\ncircumstances, it might be wise to give up this wild orchid-chase and go\nelephant-hunting instead in a certain part of Zululand, where in those\ndays these animals were still abundant.\n\nHe was inclined to agree with me, since the prospect of killing\nelephants had attractions for him.\n\n\"And yet,\" I said, after reflection, \"it's curious, but I never remember\nmaking a successful trip after altering plans at the last moment, that\nis, unless one was driven to it.\"\n\n\"I vote we toss up,\" said Somers; \"it gives Providence a chance. Now\nthen, heads for the Golden Cyp, and tails for the elephants.\"\n\nHe spun a half-crown into the air. It fell and rolled under a great,\nyellow-wood chest full of curiosities that I had collected, which\nit took all our united strength to move. We dragged it aside and not\nwithout some excitement, for really a good deal hung upon the chance, I\nlit a match and peered into the shadow. There in the dust lay the coin.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked of Somers, who was stretched on his stomach on the\nchest.\n\n\"Orchid--I mean head,\" he answered. \"Well, that's settled, so we needn't\nbother any more.\"\n\nThe next fortnight was a busy time for me. As it happened there was a\nschooner in the bay of about one hundred tons burden which belonged to\na Portuguese trader named Delgado, who dealt in goods that he carried\nto the various East African ports and Madagascar. He was a\nvillainous-looking person whom I suspected of having dealings with the\nslave traders, who were very numerous and a great power in those days,\nif indeed he were not one himself. But as he was going to Kilwa whence\nwe proposed to start inland, I arranged to make use of him to carry our\nparty and the baggage. The bargain was not altogether easy to strike for\ntwo reasons. First, he did not appear to be anxious that we should hunt\nin the districts at the back of Kilwa, where he assured me there was no\ngame, and secondly, he said that he wanted to sail at once. However, I\novercame his objections with an argument he could not resist--namely,\nmoney, and in the end he agreed to postpone his departure for fourteen\ndays.\n\nThen I set about collecting our men, of whom I had made up my mind there\nmust not be less than twenty. Already I had sent messengers summoning\nto Durban from Zululand and the upper districts of Natal various hunters\nwho had accompanied me on other expeditions. To the number of a dozen or\nso they arrived in due course. I have always had the good fortune to be\non the best of terms with my Kaffirs, and where I went they were ready\nto go without asking any questions. The man whom I had selected to be\ntheir captain under me was a Zulu of the name of Mavovo. He was a\nshort fellow, past middle age, with an enormous chest. His strength was\nproverbial; indeed, it was said that he could throw an ox by the horns,\nand myself I have seen him hold down the head of a wounded buffalo that\nhad fallen, until I could come up and shoot it.\n\nWhen I first knew Mavovo he was a petty chief and witch doctor in\nZululand. Like myself, he had fought for the Prince Umbelazi in the\ngreat battle of the Tugela, a crime which Cetewayo never forgave him.\nAbout a year afterwards he got warning that he had been smelt out as a\nwizard and was going to be killed. He fled with two of his wives and a\nchild. The slayers overtook them before he could reach the Natal border,\nand stabbed the elder wife and the child of the second wife. They were\nfour men, but, made mad by the sight, Mavovo turned on them and killed\nthem all. Then, with the remaining wife, cut to pieces as he was, he\ncrept to the river and through it to Natal. Not long after this wife\ndied also; it was said from grief at the loss of her child. Mavovo did\nnot marry again, perhaps because he was now a man without means, for\nCetewayo had taken all his cattle; also he was made ugly by an assegai\nwound which had cut off his right nostril. Shortly after the death of\nhis second wife he sought me out and told me he was a chief without a\nkraal and wished to become my hunter. So I took him on, a step which I\nnever had any cause to regret, since although morose and at times given\nto the practice of uncanny arts, he was a most faithful servant and\nbrave as a lion, or rather as a buffalo, for a lion is not always brave.\n\nAnother man whom I did not send for, but who came, was an old Hottentot\nnamed Hans, with whom I had been more or less mixed up all my life.\nWhen I was a boy he was my father's servant in the Cape Colony and my\ncompanion in some of those early wars. Also he shared some very terrible\nadventures with me which I have detailed in the history I have written\nof my first wife, Marie Marais. For instance, he and I were the only\npersons who escaped from the massacre of Retief and his companions by\nthe Zulu king, Dingaan. In the subsequence campaigns, including the\nBattle of the Blood River, he fought at my side and ultimately received\na good share of captured cattle. After this he retired and set up a\nnative store at a place called Pinetown, about fifteen miles out of\nDurban. Here I am afraid he got into bad ways and took to drink more or\nless; also to gambling. At any rate, he lost most of his property,\nso much of it indeed that he scarcely knew which way to turn. Thus it\nhappened that one evening when I went out of the house where I had been\nmaking up my accounts, I saw a yellow-faced white-haired old fellow\nsquatted on the verandah smoking a pipe made out of a corn-cob.\n\n\"Good day, Baas,\" he said, \"here am I, Hans.\"\n\n\"So I see,\" I answered, rather coldly. \"And what are you doing here,\nHans? How can you spare time from your drinking and gambling at Pinetown\nto visit me here, Hans, after I have not seen you for three years?\"\n\n\"Baas, the gambling is finished, because I have nothing more to stake,\nand the drinking is done too, because but one bottle of Cape Smoke makes\nme feel quite ill next morning. So now I only take water and as little\nof that as I can, water and some tobacco to cover up its taste.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it, Hans. If my father, the Predikant who baptised\nyou, were alive now, he would have much to say about your conduct as\nindeed I have no doubt he will presently when you have gone into a\nhole (i.e., a grave). For there in the hole he will be waiting for you,\nHans.\"\n\n\"I know, I know, Baas. I have been thinking of that and it troubles me.\nYour reverend father, the Predikant, will be very cross indeed with me\nwhen I join him in the Place of Fires where he sits awaiting me. So I\nwish to make my peace with him by dying well, and in your service, Baas.\nI hear that the Baas is going on an expedition. I have come to accompany\nthe Baas.\"\n\n\"To accompany me! Why, you are old, you are not worth five shillings a\nmonth and your _scoff_ (food). You are a shrunken old brandy cask that\nwill not even hold water.\"\n\nHans grinned right across his ugly face.\n\n\"Oh! Baas, I am old, but I am clever. All these years I have been\ngathering wisdom. I am as full of it as a bee's nest is with honey when\nthe summer is done. And, Baas, I can stop those leaks in the cask.\"\n\n\"Hans, it is no good, I don't want you. I am going into great danger. I\nmust have those about me whom I can trust.\"\n\n\"Well, Baas, and who can be better trusted than Hans? Who warned you\nof the attack of the Quabies on Maraisfontein, and so saved the life\nof----\"\n\n\"Hush!\" I said.\n\n\"I understand. I will not speak the name. It is holy not to be\nmentioned. It is the name of one who stands with the white angels before\nGod; not to be mentioned by poor drunken Hans. Still, who stood at your\nside in that great fight? Ah! it makes me young again to think of it,\nwhen the roof burned; when the door was broken down; when we met the\nQuabies on the spears; when you held the pistol to the head of the Holy\nOne whose name must not be mentioned, the Great One who knew how to die.\nOh! Baas, our lives are twisted up together like the creeper and the\ntree, and where you go, there I must go also. Do not turn me away. I ask\nno wages, only a bit of food and a handful of tobacco, and the light of\nyour face and a word now and again of the memories that belong to both\nof us. I am still very strong. I can shoot well--well, Baas, who was it\nthat put it into your mind to aim at the tails of the vultures on the\nHill of Slaughter yonder in Zululand, and so saved the lives of all the\nBoer people, and of her whose holy name must not be mentioned? Baas, you\nwill not turn me away?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"you can come. But you will swear by the spirit of my\nfather, the Predikant, to touch no liquor on this journey.\"\n\n\"I swear by his spirit and by that of the Holy One,\" and he flung\nhimself forward on to his knees, took my hand and kissed it. Then he\nrose and said in a matter-of-fact tone, \"If the Baas can give me two\nblankets, I shall thank him, also five shillings to buy some tobacco\nand a new knife. Where are the Baas's guns? I must go to oil them. I\nbeg that the Baas will take with him that little rifle which is named\n_Intombi_ (Maiden), the one with which he shot the vultures on the Hill\nof Slaughter, the one that killed the geese in the Goose Kloof when I\nloaded for him and he won the great match against the Boer whom Dingaan\ncalled Two-faces.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said. \"Here are the five shillings. You shall have the\nblankets and a new gun and all things needful. You will find the guns in\nthe little back room and with them those of the Baas, my companion, who\nalso is your master. Go see to them.\"\n\nAt length all was ready, the cases of guns, ammunition, medicines,\npresents and food were on board the _Maria_. So were four donkeys that\nI had bought in the hope that they would prove useful, either to ride\nor as pack beasts. The donkey, be it remembered, and man are the only\nanimals which are said to be immune from the poisonous effects of the\nbite of tsetse fly, except, of course, the wild game. It was our last\nnight at Durban, a very beautiful night of full moon at the end of\nMarch, for the Portugee Delgado had announced his intention of sailing\non the following afternoon. Stephen Somers and I were seated on the\nstoep smoking and talking things over.\n\n\"It is a strange thing,\" I said, \"that Brother John should never have\nturned up. I know that he was set upon making this expedition, not only\nfor the sake of the orchid, but also for some other reason of which he\nwould not speak. I think that the old fellow must be dead.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" answered Stephen (we had become intimate and I called him\nStephen now), \"a man alone among savages might easily come to grief\nand never be heard of again. Hark! What's that?\" and he pointed to some\ngardenia bushes in the shadow of the house near by, whence came a sound\nof something that moved.\n\n\"A dog, I expect, or perhaps it is Hans. He curls up in all sorts of\nplaces near to where I may be. Hans, are you there?\"\n\nA figure arose from the gardenia bushes.\n\n\"_Ja_, I am here, Baas.\"\n\n\"What are you doing, Hans?\"\n\n\"I am doing what the dog does, Baas--watching my master.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I answered. Then an idea struck me. \"Hans, you have heard of the\nwhite Baas with the long beard whom the Kaffirs call Dogeetah?\"\n\n\"I have heard of him and once I saw him, a few moons ago passing\nthrough Pinetown. A Kaffir with him told me that he was going over the\nDrakensberg to hunt for things that crawl and fly, being quite mad,\nBaas.\"\n\n\"Well, where is he now, Hans? He should have been here to travel with\nus.\"\n\n\"Am I a spirit that I can tell the Baas whither a white man has\nwandered. Yet, stay. Mavovo may be able to tell. He is a great doctor,\nhe can see through distance, and even now, this very night his Snake\nof divination has entered into him and he is looking into the future,\nyonder, behind the house. I saw him form the circle.\"\n\nI translated what Hans said to Stephen, for he had been talking in\nDutch, then asked him if he would like to see some Kaffir magic.\n\n\"Of course,\" he answered, \"but it's all bosh, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, all bosh, or so most people say,\" I answered evasively.\n\"Still, sometimes these _Inyangas_ tell one strange things.\"\n\nThen, led by Hans, we crept round the house to where there was a\nfive-foot stone wall at the back of the stable. Beyond this wall, within\nthe circle of some huts where my Kaffirs lived, was an open space with\nan ant-heap floor where they did their cooking. Here, facing us, sat\nMavovo, while in a ring around him were all the hunters who were to\naccompany us; also Jack, the lame Griqua, and the two house-boys. In\nfront of Mavovo burned a number of little wood fires. I counted them and\nfound that there were fourteen, which, I reflected, was the exact\nnumber of our hunters, plus ourselves. One of the hunters was engaged\nin feeding these fires with little bits of stick and handfuls of\ndried grass so as to keep them burning brightly. The others sat round\nperfectly silent and watched with rapt attention. Mavovo himself looked\nlike a man who is asleep. He was crouched on his haunches with his big\nhead resting almost upon his knees. About his middle was a snake-skin,\nand round his neck an ornament that appeared to be made of human teeth.\nOn his right side lay a pile of feathers from the wings of vultures, and\non his left a little heap of silver money--I suppose the fees paid by\nthe hunters for whom he was divining.\n\nAfter we had watched him for some while from our shelter behind the wall\nhe appeared to wake out of his sleep. First he muttered; then he looked\nup to the moon and seemed to say a prayer of which I could not catch\nthe words. Next he shuddered three times convulsively and exclaimed in a\nclear voice:\n\n\"My Snake has come. It is within me. Now I can hear, now I can see.\"\n\nThree of the little fires, those immediately in front of him, were\nlarger than the others. He took up his bundle of vultures' feathers,\nselected one with care, held it towards the sky, then passed it through\nthe flame of the centre one of the three fires, uttering as he did so,\nmy native name, Macumazana. Withdrawing it from the flame he examined\nthe charred edges of the feather very carefully, a proceeding that\ncaused a cold shiver to go down my back, for I knew well that he was\ninquiring of his \"Spirit\" what would be my fate upon this expedition.\nHow it answered, I cannot tell, for he laid the feather down and\ntook another, with which he went through the same process. This time,\nhowever, the name he called out was Mwamwazela, which in its shortened\nform of Wazela, was the Kaffir appellation that the natives had given\nto Stephen Somers. It means a Smile, and no doubt was selected for him\nbecause of his pleasant, smiling countenance.\n\nHaving passed it through the right-hand fire of the three, he examined\nit and laid it down.\n\nSo it went on. One after another he called out the names of the hunters,\nbeginning with his own as captain; passed the feather which represented\neach of them through the particular fire of his destiny, examined\nand laid it down. After this he seemed to go to sleep again for a few\nminutes, then woke up as a man does from a natural slumber, yawned and\nstretched himself.\n\n\"Speak,\" said his audience, with great anxiety. \"Have you seen? Have you\nheard? What does your Snake tell you of me? Of me? Of me? Of me?\"\n\n\"I have seen, I have heard,\" he answered. \"My Snake tells me that this\nwill be a very dangerous journey. Of those who go on it six will die by\nthe bullet, by the spear or by sickness, and others will be hurt.\"\n\n\"_Ow?_\" said one of them, \"but which will die and which will come out\nsafe? Does not your Snake tell you that, O Doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course my Snake tells me that. But my Snake tells me also\nto hold my tongue on the matter, lest some of us should be turned to\ncowards. It tells me further that the first who should ask me more, will\nbe one of those who must die. Now do you ask? Or you? Or you? Or you?\nAsk if you will.\"\n\nStrange to say no one accepted the invitation. Never have I seen a body\nof men so indifferent to the future, at least to every appearance. One\nand all they seemed to come to the conclusion that so far as they were\nconcerned it might be left to look after itself.\n\n\"My Snake told me something else,\" went on Mavovo. \"It is that if among\nthis company there is any jackal of a man who, thinking that he might be\none of the six to die, dreams to avoid his fate by deserting, it will be\nof no use. For then my Snake will point him out and show me how to deal\nwith him.\"\n\nNow with one voice each man present there declared that desertion from\nthe lord Macumazana was the last thing that could possibly occur to him.\nIndeed, I believe that those brave fellows spoke truth. No doubt they\nput faith in Mavovo's magic after the fashion of their race. Still the\ndeath he promised was some way off, and each hoped he would be one of\nthe six to escape. Moreover, the Zulu of those days was too accustomed\nto death to fear its terrors over much.\n\nOne of them did, however, venture to advance the argument, which\nMavovo treated with proper contempt, that the shillings paid for this\ndivination should be returned by him to the next heirs of such of them\nas happened to decease. Why, he asked, should these pay a shilling in\norder to be told that they must die? It seemed unreasonable.\n\nCertainly the Zulu Kaffirs have a queer way of looking at things.\n\n\"Hans,\" I whispered, \"is your fire among those that burn yonder?\"\n\n\"Not so, Baas,\" he wheezed back into my ear. \"Does the Baas think me a\nfool? If I must die, I must die; if I am to live, I shall live. Why\nthen should I pay a shilling to learn what time will declare? Moreover,\nyonder Mavovo takes the shillings and frightens everybody, but tells\nnobody anything. _I_ call it cheating. But, Baas, do you and the Baas\nWazela have no fear. You did not pay shillings, and therefore Mavovo,\nthough without doubt he is a great _Inyanga_, cannot really prophesy\nconcerning you, since his Snake will not work without a fee.\"\n\nThe argument seems remarkably absurd. Yet it must be common, for now\nthat I come to think of it, no gipsy will tell a \"true fortune\" unless\nher hand is crossed with silver.\n\n\"I say, Quatermain,\" said Stephen idly, \"since our friend Mavovo seems\nto know so much, ask him what has become of Brother John, as Hans\nsuggested. Tell me what he says afterwards, for I want to see\nsomething.\"\n\nSo I went through the little gate in the wall in a natural kind of way,\nas though I had seen nothing, and appeared to be struck by the sight of\nthe little fires.\n\n\"Well, Mavovo,\" I said, \"are you doing doctor's work? I thought that it\nhad brought you into enough trouble in Zululand.\"\n\n\"That is so, _Baba_,\" replied Mavovo, who had a habit of calling me\n\"father,\" though he was older than I. \"It cost me my chieftainship and\nmy cattle and my two wives and my son. It made of me a wanderer who\nis glad to accompany a certain Macumazana to strange lands where many\nthings may befall me, yes,\" he added with meaning, \"even the last of all\nthings. And yet a gift is a gift and must be used. You, _Baba_, have a\ngift of shooting and do you cease to shoot? You have a gift of wandering\nand can you cease to wander?\"\n\nHe picked up one of the burnt feathers from the little pile by his side\nand looked at it attentively. \"Perhaps, _Baba_, you have been told--my\nears are very sharp, and I thought I heard some such words floating\nthrough the air just now--that we poor Kaffir _Inyangas_ can prophesy\nnothing true unless we are paid, and perhaps that is a fact so far\nas something of the moment is concerned. And yet the Snake in the\n_Inyanga_, jumping over the little rock which hides the present from it,\nmay see the path that winds far and far away through the valleys, across\nthe streams, up the mountains, till it is lost in the 'heaven above.'\nThus on this feather, burnt in my magic fire, I seem to see something of\nyour future, O my father Macumazana. Far and far your road runs,\" and he\ndrew his finger along the feather. \"Here is a journey,\" and he flicked\naway a carbonised flake, \"here is another, and another, and another,\"\nand he flicked off flake after flake. \"Here is one that is very\nsuccessful, it leaves you rich; and here is yet one more, a wonderful\njourney this in which you see strange things and meet strange people.\nThen\"--and he blew on the feather in such a fashion that all the charred\nfilaments (Brother John says that _laminae_ is the right word for them)\nfell away from it--\"then, there is nothing left save such a pole as some\nof my people stick upright on a grave, the Shaft of Memory they call it.\nO, my father, you will die in a distant land, but you will leave a great\nmemory behind you that will live for hundreds of years, for see how\nstrong is this quill over which the fire has had no power. With some of\nthese others it is quite different,\" he added.\n\n\"I daresay,\" I broke in, \"but, Mavovo, be so good as to leave me out of\nyour magic, for I don't at all want to know what is going to happen to\nme. To-day is enough for me without studying next month and next year.\nThere is a saying in our holy book which runs: 'Sufficient to the day is\nits evil.'\"\n\n\"Quite so, O Macumazana. Also that is a very good saying as some of\nthose hunters of yours are thinking now. Yet an hour ago they were\nforcing their shillings on me that I might tell them of the future. And\n_you_, too, want to know something. You did not come through that gate\nto quote to me the wisdom of your holy book. What is it, _Baba_? Be\nquick, for my Snake is getting very tired. He wishes to go back to his\nhole in the world beneath.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" I answered in rather a shamefaced fashion, for Mavovo had\nan uncanny way of seeing into one's secret motives, \"I should like to\nknow, if you can tell me, which you can't, what has become of the white\nman with the long beard whom you black people call Dogeetah? He should\nhave been here to go on this journey with us; indeed, he was to be our\nguide and we cannot find him. Where is he and why is he not here?\"\n\n\"Have you anything about you that belonged to Dogeetah, Macumazana?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered; \"that is, yes,\" and from my pocket I produced the\nstump of pencil that Brother John had given me, which, being economical,\nI had saved up ever since. Mavovo took it, and after considering it\ncarefully as he had done in the case of the feathers, swept up a pile\nof ashes with his horny hand from the edge of the largest of the little\nfires, that indeed which had represented myself. These ashes he patted\nflat. Then he drew on them with the point of the pencil, tracing what\nseemed to me to be the rough image of a man, such as children scratch\nupon whitewashed walls. When he had finished he sat up and contemplated\nhis handiwork with all the satisfaction of an artist. A breeze had risen\nfrom the sea and was blowing in little gusts, so that the fine ashes\nwere disturbed, some of the lines of the picture being filled in and\nothers altered or enlarged.\n\nFor a while Mavovo sat with his eyes shut. Then he opened them, studied\nthe ashes and what remained of the picture, and taking a blanket that\nlay near by, threw it over his own head and over the ashes. Withdrawing\nit again presently he cast it aside and pointed to the picture which\nwas now quite changed. Indeed, in the moonlight, it looked more like a\nlandscape than anything else.\n\n\"All is clear, my father,\" he said in a matter-of-fact voice. \"The white\nwanderer, Dogeetah, is not dead. He lives, but he is sick. Something is\nthe matter with one of his legs so that he cannot walk. Perhaps a bone\nis broken or some beast has bitten him. He lies in a hut such as Kaffirs\nmake, only this hut has a verandah round it like your stoep, and there\nare drawings on the wall. The hut is a long way off, I don't know\nwhere.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" I asked, for he paused.\n\n\"No, not all. Dogeetah is recovering. He will join us in that country\nwhither we journey, at a time of trouble. That is all, and the fee is\nhalf-a-crown.\"\n\n\"You mean one shilling,\" I suggested.\n\n\"No, my father Macumazana. One shilling for simple magic such as\nforetelling the fate of common black people. Half-a-crown for very\ndifficult magic that has to do with white people, magic of which only\ngreat doctors, like me, Mavovo, are the masters.\"\n\nI gave him the half-crown and said:\n\n\"Look here, friend Mavovo, I believe in you as a fighter and a hunter,\nbut as a magician I think you are a humbug. Indeed, I am so sure of it\nthat if ever Dogeetah turns up at a time of trouble in that land whither\nwe are journeying, I will make you a present of that double-barrelled\nrifle of mine which you admired so much.\"\n\nOne of his rare smiles appeared upon Mavovo's ugly face.\n\n\"Then give it to me now, _Baba_,\" he said, \"for it is already earned. My\nSnake cannot lie--especially when the fee is half-a-crown.\"\n\nI shook my head and declined, politely but with firmness.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mavovo, \"you white men are very clever and think that you\nknow everything. But it is not so, for in learning so much that is new,\nyou have forgotten more that is old. When the Snake that is in you,\nMacumazana, dwelt in a black savage like me a thousand thousand years\nago, you could have done and did what I do. But now you can only mock\nand say, 'Mavovo the brave in battle, the great hunter, the loyal man,\nbecomes a liar when he blows the burnt feather, or reads what the wind\nwrites upon the charmed ashes.'\"\n\n\"I do not say that you are a liar, Mavovo, I say that you are deceived\nby your own imaginings. It is not possible that man can know what is\nhidden from man.\"\n\n\"Is it indeed so, O Macumazana, Watcher by Night? Am I, Mavovo, the\npupil of Zikali, the Opener of Roads, the greatest of wizards, indeed\ndeceived by my own imaginings? And has man no other eyes but those in\nhis head, that he cannot see what is hidden from man? Well, you say so\nand all we black people know that you are very clever, and why should I,\na poor Zulu, be able to see what you cannot see? Yet when to-morrow one\nsends you a message from the ship in which we are to sail, begging you\nto come fast because there is trouble on the ship, then bethink you of\nyour words and my words, and whether or no man can see what is hidden\nfrom man in the blackness of the future. Oh! that rifle of yours is mine\nalready, though you will not give it to me now, you who think that I\nam a cheat. Well, my father Macumazana, because you think I am a cheat,\nnever again will I blow the feather or read what the wind writes upon\nthe ashes for you or any who eat your food.\"\n\nThen he rose, saluted me with uplifted right hand, collected his little\npile of money and bag of medicines and marched off to the sleeping hut.\n\nOn our way round the house we met my old lame caretaker, Jack.\n\n\"_Inkoosi_,\" he said, \"the white chief Wazela bade me say that he and\nthe cook, Sam, have gone to sleep on board the ship to look after the\ngoods. Sam came up just now and fetched him away; he says he will show\nyou why to-morrow.\"\n\nI nodded and passed on, wondering to myself why Stephen had suddenly\ndetermined to stay the night on the _Maria_.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n                                HASSAN\n\nI suppose it must have been two hours after dawn on the following\nmorning that I was awakened by knocks upon the door and the voice of\nJack saying that Sam, the cook, wanted to speak to me.\n\nWondering what he could be doing there, as I understood he was sleeping\non the ship, I called out that he was to come in. Now this Sam, I should\nsay, hailed from the Cape, and was a person of mixed blood. The original\nstock, I imagine, was Malay which had been crossed with Indian coolie.\nAlso, somewhere or other, there was a dash of white and possibly, but of\nthis I am not sure, a little Hottentot. The result was a person of\nfew vices and many virtues. Sammy, I may say at once, was perhaps the\nbiggest coward I ever met. He could not help it, it was congenital,\nthough, curiously enough, this cowardice of his never prevented him from\nrushing into fresh danger. Thus he knew that the expedition upon which\nI was engaged would be most hazardous; remembering his weakness I\nexplained this to him very clearly. Yet that knowledge did not deter him\nfrom imploring that he might be allowed to accompany me. Perhaps this\nwas because there was some mutual attachment between us, as in the case\nof Hans. Once, a good many years before, I had rescued Sammy from a\nsomewhat serious scrape by declining to give evidence against him. I\nneed not enter into the details, but a certain sum of money over which\nhe had control had disappeared. I will merely say, therefore, that at\nthe time he was engaged to a coloured lady of very expensive tastes,\nwhom in the end he never married.\n\nAfter this, as it chanced, he nursed me through an illness. Hence the\nattachment of which I have spoken.\n\nSammy was the son of a native Christian preacher, and brought up upon\nwhat he called \"The Word.\" He had received an excellent education for a\nperson of his class, and in addition to many native dialects with which\na varied career had made him acquainted, spoke English perfectly, though\nin the most bombastic style. Never would he use a short word if a long\none came to his hand, or rather to his tongue. For several years of his\nlife he was, I believe, a teacher in a school at Capetown where coloured\npersons received their education; his \"department,\" as he called it,\nbeing \"English Language and Literature.\"\n\nWearying of or being dismissed from his employment for some reason that\nhe never specified, he had drifted up the coast to Zanzibar, where he\nturned his linguistic abilities to the study of Arabic and became the\nmanager or head cook of an hotel. After a few years he lost this billet,\nI know not how or why, and appeared at Durban in what he called a\n\"reversed position.\" Here it was that we met again, just before my\nexpedition to Pongo-land.\n\nIn manners he was most polite, in disposition most religious; I believe\nhe was a Baptist by faith, and in appearance a small, brown dandy of\na man of uncertain age, who wore his hair parted in the middle and,\nwhatever the circumstances, was always tidy in his garments.\n\nI took him on because he was in great distress, an excellent cook, the\nbest of nurses, and above all for the reason that, as I have said,\nwe were in a way attached to each other. Also, he always amused me\nintensely, which goes for something on a long journey of the sort that I\ncontemplated.\n\nSuch in brief was Sammy.\n\nAs he entered the room I saw that his clothes were very wet and asked\nhim at once if it were raining, or whether he had got drunk and been\nsleeping in the damp grass.\n\n\"No, Mr. Quatermain,\" he answered, \"the morning is extremely fine, and\nlike the poor Hottentot, Hans, I have abjured the use of intoxicants.\nThough we differ on much else, in this matter we agree.\"\n\n\"Then what the deuce is up?\" I interrupted, to cut short his flow of\nfine language.\n\n\"Sir, there is trouble on the ship\" (remembering Mavovo I started at\nthese words) \"where I passed the night in the company of Mr. Somers at\nhis special request.\" (It was the other way about really.) \"This\nmorning before the dawn, when he thought that everybody was asleep, the\nPortuguese captain and some of his Arabs began to weigh the anchor quite\nquietly; also to hoist the sails. But Mr. Somers and I, being very much\nawake, came out of the cabin and he sat upon the capstan with a revolver\nin his hand, saying--well, sir, I will not repeat what he said.\"\n\n\"No, don't. What happened then?\"\n\n\"Then, sir, there followed much noise and confusion. The Portugee and\nthe Arabs threatened Mr. Somers, but he, sir, continued to sit upon\nthe capstan with the stern courage of a rock in a rushing stream, and\nremarked that he would see them all somewhere before they touched it.\nAfter this, sir, I do not know what occurred, since while I watched from\nthe bulwarks someone knocked me head over heels into the sea and being\nfortunately, a good swimmer, I gained the shore and hurried here to\nadvise you.\"\n\n\"And did you advise anyone else, you idiot?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir. As I sped along I communicated to an officer of the port that\nthere was the devil of a mess upon the _Maria_ which he would do well to\ninvestigate.\"\n\nBy this time I was in my shirt and trousers and shouting to Mavovo and\nthe others. Soon they arrived, for as the costume of Mavovo and his\ncompany consisted only of a moocha and a blanket, it did not take them\nlong to dress.\n\n\"Mavovo,\" I began, \"there is trouble on the ship----\"\n\n\"O _Baba_,\" he interrupted with something resembling a grin, \"it is very\nstrange, but last night I dreamed that I told you----\"\n\n\"Curse your dreams,\" I said. \"Gather the men and go down--no, that won't\nwork, there would be murder done. Either it is all over now or it is\nall right. Get the hunters ready; I come with them. The luggage can be\nfetched afterwards.\"\n\nWithin less than an hour we were at that wharf off which the _Maria_\nlay in what one day will be the splendid port of Durban, though in\nthose times its shipping arrangements were exceedingly primitive. A\nstrange-looking band we must have been. I, who was completely dressed,\nand I trust tidy, marched ahead. Next came Hans in the filthy wide-awake\nhat which he usually wore and greasy corduroys and after him the\noleaginous Sammy arrayed in European reach-me-downs, a billy-cock and a\nbright blue tie striped with red, garments that would have looked very\nsmart had it not been for his recent immersion. After him followed the\nfierce-looking Mavovo and his squad of hunters, all of whom wore the\n\"ring\" or _isicoco_, as the Zulus call it; that is, a circle of polished\nblack wax sewn into their short hair. They were a grim set of fellows,\nbut as, according to a recent law it was not allowable for them to\nappear armed in the town, their guns had already been shipped, while\ntheir broad stabbing spears were rolled up in their sleeping mats, the\nblades wrapped round with dried grass.\n\nEach of them, however, bore in his hand a large knobkerry of red-wood,\nand they marched four by four in martial fashion. It is true that when\nwe embarked on the big boat to go to the ship much of their warlike\nardour evaporated, since these men, who feared nothing on the land, were\nterribly afraid of that unfamiliar element, the water.\n\nWe reached the _Maria_, an unimposing kind of tub, and climbed aboard.\nOn looking aft the first thing that I saw was Stephen seated on the\ncapstan with a pistol in his hand, as Sammy had said. Near by, leaning\non the bulwark was the villainous-looking Portugee, Delgado, apparently\nin the worst of tempers and surrounded by a number of equally\nvillainous-looking Arab sailors clad in dirty white. In front was the\nCaptain of the port, a well-known and esteemed gentleman of the name\nof Cato, like myself a small man who had gone through many adventures.\nAccompanied by some attendants, he was seated on the after-skylight,\nsmoking, with his eyes fixed upon Stephen and the Portugee.\n\n\"Glad to see you, Quatermain,\" he said. \"There's some row on here, but\nI have only just arrived and don't understand Portuguese, and the\ngentleman on the capstan won't leave it to explain.\"\n\n\"What's up, Stephen?\" I asked, after shaking Mr. Cato by the hand.\n\n\"What's up?\" replied Somers. \"This man,\" and he pointed to Delgado,\n\"wanted to sneak out to sea with all our goods, that's all, to say\nnothing of me and Sammy, whom, no doubt, he'd have chucked overboard,\nas soon as he was out of sight of land. However, Sammy, who knows\nPortuguese, overheard his little plans and, as you see, I objected.\"\n\nWell, Delgado was asked for his version of the affair, and, as I\nexpected, explained that he only intended to get a little nearer to the\nbar and there wait till we arrived. Of course he lied and knew that we\nwere aware of the fact and that his intention had been to slip out to\nsea with all our valuable property, which he would sell after having\nmurdered or marooned Stephen and the poor cook. But as nothing could be\nproved, and we were now in strong enough force to look after ourselves\nand our belongings, I did not see the use of pursuing the argument. So I\naccepted the explanation with a smile, and asked everybody to join in a\nmorning nip.\n\nAfterwards Stephen told me that while I was engaged with Mavovo on the\nprevious night, a message had reached him from Sammy who was on board\nthe ship in charge of our belongings, saying that he would be glad of\nsome company. Knowing the cook's nervous nature, fortunately enough\nhe made up his mind at once to go and sleep upon the _Maria_. In the\nmorning trouble arose as Sammy had told me. What he did not tell me was\nthat he was not knocked overboard, as he said, but took to the water of\nhis own accord, when complications with Delgado appeared imminent.\n\n\"I understand the position,\" I said, \"and all's well that ends well. But\nit's lucky you thought of coming on board to sleep.\"\n\nAfter this everything went right. I sent some of the men back in the\ncharge of Stephen for our remaining effects, which they brought safely\naboard, and in the evening we sailed. Our voyage up to Kilwa was\nbeautiful, a gentle breeze driving us forward over a sea so calm that\nnot even Hans, who I think was one of the worst sailors in the world,\nor the Zulu hunters were really sick, though as Sammy put it, they\n\"declined their food.\"\n\nI think it was on the fifth night of our voyage, or it may have been\nthe seventh, that we anchored one afternoon off the island of Kilwa, not\nvery far from the old Portuguese fort. Delgado, with whom we had little\nto do during the passage, hoisted some queer sort of signal. In response\na boat came off containing what he called the Port officials, a band of\ncut-throat, desperate-looking, black fellows in charge of a\npock-marked, elderly half-breed who was introduced to us as the Bey\nHassan-ben-Mohammed. That Mr. Hassan-ben-Mohammed entirely disapproved\nof our presence on the ship, and especially of our proposed landing\nat Kilwa, was evident to me from the moment that I set eyes upon his\nill-favoured countenance. After a hurried conference with Delgado, he\ncame forward and addressed me in Arabic, of which I could not understand\na word. Luckily, however, Sam the cook, who, as I think I said, was a\ngreat linguist, had a fair acquaintance with this tongue, acquired, it\nappears, while at the Zanzibar hotel; so, not trusting Delgado, I called\non him to interpret.\n\n\"What is he saying, Sammy?\" I asked.\n\nHe began to talk to Hassan and replied presently:\n\n\"Sir, he makes you many compliments. He says that he has heard what a\ngreat man who are from his friend, Delgado, also that you and Mr. Somers\nare English, a nation which he adores.\"\n\n\"Does he?\" I exclaimed. \"I should never have thought it from his looks.\nThank him for his kind remarks and tell him that we are going to land\nhere and march up country to shoot.\"\n\nSammy obeyed, and the conversation went on somewhat as follows:\n\n\"With all humility I (i.e. Hassan) request you not to land. This country\nis not a fit place for such noble gentlemen. There is nothing to eat and\nno head of game has been seen for years. The people in the interior\nare savages of the worst sort, whom hunger has driven to take to\ncannibalism. I would not have your blood upon my head. I beg of you,\ntherefore, to go on in this ship to Delagoa Bay, where you will find a\ngood hotel, or to any other place you may select.\"\n\nA.Q.: \"Might I ask you, noble sir, what is your position at Kilwa, that\nyou consider yourself responsible for our safety?\"\n\nH.: \"Honoured English lord, I am a trader here of Portuguese\nnationality, but born of an Arab mother of high birth and brought up\namong that people. I have gardens on the mainland, tended by my native\nservants who are as children to me, where I grow palms and cassava\nand ground nuts and plantains and many other kinds of produce. All\nthe tribes in this district look upon me as their chief and venerated\nfather.\"\n\nA.Q.: \"Then, noble Hassan, you will be able to pass us through them,\nseeing that we are peaceful hunters who wish to harm no one.\"\n\n(A long consultation between Hassan and Delgado, during which I ordered\nMavovo to bring his Zulus on deck with their guns.)\n\nH.: \"Honoured English lord, I cannot allow you to land.\"\n\nA.Q.: \"Noble son of the Prophet, I intend to land with my friend, my\nfollowers, my donkeys and my goods early to-morrow morning. If I can\ndo so with your leave I shall be glad. If not----\" and I glanced at the\nfierce group of hunters behind me.\n\nH.: \"Honoured English lord, I shall be grieved to use force, but let me\ntell you that in my peaceful village ashore I have at least a hundred\nmen armed with rifles, whereas here I see under twenty.\"\n\nA.Q., after reflection and a few words with Stephen Somers: \"Can you\ntell me, noble sir, if from your peaceful village you have yet sighted\nthe English man-of-war, _Crocodile_; I mean the steamer that is engaged\nin watching for the dhows of wicked slavers? A letter from her captain\ninformed me that he would be in these waters by yesterday. Perhaps,\nhowever, he has been delayed for a day or two.\"\n\nIf I had exploded a bomb at the feet of the excellent Hassan its effect\ncould scarcely have been more remarkable than that of this question. He\nturned--not pale, but a horrible yellow, and exclaimed:\n\n\"English man-of-war! _Crocodile_! I thought she had gone to Aden to\nrefit and would not be back at Zanzibar for four months.\"\n\nA.Q.: \"You have been misinformed, noble Hassan. She will not refit till\nOctober. Shall I read you the letter?\" and I produced a piece of paper\nfrom my pocket. \"It may be interesting since my friend, the captain,\nwhom you remember is named Flowers, mentions you in it. He says----\"\n\nHassan waved his hand. \"It is enough. I see, honoured lord, that you are\na man of mettle not easily to be turned from your purpose. In the name\nof God the Compassionate, land and go wheresoever you like.\"\n\nA.Q.: \"I think that I had almost rather wait until the _Crocodile_ comes\nin.\"\n\nH.: \"Land! Land! Captain Delgado, get up the cargo and man your boat.\nMine too is at the service of these lords. You, Captain, will like to\nget away by this night's tide. There is still light, Lord Quatermain,\nand such hospitality as I can offer is at your service.\"\n\nA.Q.: \"Ah! I knew Bey Hassan, that you were only joking with me when you\nsaid that you wished us to go elsewhere. An excellent jest, truly, from\none whose hospitality is so famous. Well, to fall in with your wishes,\nwe will come ashore this evening, and if the Captain Delgado chances to\nsight the Queen's ship _Crocodile_ before he sails, perhaps he will be\nso good as to signal to us with a rocket.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" interrupted Delgado, who up to this time had\npretended that he understood no English, the tongue in which I was\nspeaking to the interpreter, Sammy.\n\nThen he turned and gave orders to his Arab crew to bring up our\nbelongings from the hold and to lower the _Maria's_ boat.\n\nNever did I see goods transferred in quicker time. Within half an hour\nevery one of our packages was off that ship, for Stephen Somers kept a\ncount of them. Our personal baggage went into the _Maria's_ boat, and\nthe goods together with the four donkeys which were lowered on to the\ntop of them, were rumbled pell-mell into the barge-like punt belonging\nto Hassan. Here also I was accommodated, with about half of our people,\nthe rest taking their seats in the smaller boat under the charge of\nStephen.\n\nAt length all was ready and we cast off.\n\n\"Farewell, Captain,\" I cried to Delgado. \"If you should sight the\n_Crocodile_----\"\n\nAt this point Delgado broke into such a torrent of bad language in\nPortuguese, Arabic and English that I fear the rest of my remarks never\nreached him.\n\nAs we rowed shorewards I observed that Hans, who was seated near to me\nunder the stomach of a jackass, was engaged in sniffing at the sides and\nbottom of the barge, as a dog might do, and asked him what he was about.\n\n\"Very odd smell in this boat,\" he whispered back in Dutch. \"It stinks of\nKaffir man, just like the hold of the _Maria_. I think this boat is used\nto carry slaves.\"\n\n\"Be quiet,\" I whispered back, \"and stop nosing at those planks.\" But to\nmyself I thought, Hans is right, we are in a nest of slave-traders, and\nthis Hassan is their leader.\n\nWe rowed past the island, on which I observed the ruins of an old\nPortuguese fort and some long grass-roofed huts, where, I reflected, the\nslaves were probably kept until they could be shipped away. Observing my\nglance fixed upon these, Hassan hastened to explain, through Sammy, that\nthey were storehouses in which he dried fish and hides, and kept goods.\n\n\"How interesting!\" I answered. \"Further south we dry hides in the sun.\"\n\nCrossing a narrow channel we arrived at a rough jetty where we\ndisembarked, whence we were led by Hassan not to the village which I now\nsaw upon our left, but to a pleasant-looking, though dilapidated\nhouse that stood a hundred yards from the shore. Something about the\nappearance of this house impressed me with the idea that it was never\nbuilt by slavers; the whole look of the place with its verandah and\ngarden suggested taste and civilisation. Evidently educated people had\ndesigned it and resided here. I glanced about me and saw, amidst a grove\nof neglected orange trees that were surrounded with palms of some\nage, the ruins of a church. About this there was no doubt, for there,\nsurmounted by a stone cross, was a little pent-house in which still hung\nthe bell that once summoned the worshippers to prayer.\n\n\"Tell the English lord,\" said Hassan to Sammy, \"that these buildings\nwere a mission station of the Christians, who abandoned them more than\ntwenty years ago. When I came here I found them empty.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I answered, \"and what were the names of those who dwelt in\nthem?\"\n\n\"I never heard,\" said Hassan; \"they had been gone a long while when I\ncame.\"\n\nThen we went up to the house, and for the next hour and more were\nengaged with our baggage which was piled in a heap in what had been the\ngarden and in unpacking and pitching two tents for the hunters which I\ncaused to be placed immediately in front of the rooms that were assigned\nto us. Those rooms were remarkable in their way. Mine had evidently\nbeen a sitting chamber, as I judged from some such broken articles of\nfurniture, that appeared to be of American make. That which Stephen\noccupied had once served as a sleeping-place, for the bedstead of iron\nstill remained there. Also there were a hanging bookcase, now fallen,\nand some tattered remnants of books. One of these, that oddly enough was\nwell-preserved, perhaps because the white ants or other creatures did\nnot like the taste of its morocco binding, was a Keble's _Christian\nYear_, on the title-page of which was written, \"To my dearest Elizabeth\non her birthday, from her husband.\" I took the liberty to put it in my\npocket. On the wall, moreover, still hung the small watercolour picture\nof a very pretty young woman with fair hair and blue eyes, in the corner\nof which picture was written in the same handwriting as that in the\nbook, \"Elizabeth, aged twenty.\" This also I annexed, thinking that it\nmight come in useful as a piece of evidence.\n\n\"Looks as if the owners of this place had left it in a hurry,\nQuatermain,\" said Stephen.\n\n\"That's it, my boy. Or perhaps they didn't leave; perhaps they stopped\nhere.\"\n\n\"Murdered?\"\n\nI nodded and said, \"I dare say friend Hassan could tell us something\nabout the matter. Meanwhile as supper isn't ready yet, let us have a\nlook at that church while it is light.\"\n\nWe walked through the palm and orange grove to where the building stood\nfinely placed upon a mound. It was well-constructed of a kind of coral\nrock, and a glance showed us that it had been gutted by fire; the\ndiscoloured walls told their own tale. The interior was now full of\nshrubs and creepers, and an ugly, yellowish snake glided from what had\nbeen the stone altar. Without, the graveyard was enclosed by a broken\nwall, only we could see no trace of graves. Near the gateway, however,\nwas a rough mound.\n\n\"If we could dig into that,\" I said, \"I expect we should find the bones\nof the people who inhabited this place. Does that suggest anything to\nyou, Stephen?\"\n\n\"Nothing, except that they were probably killed.\"\n\n\"You should learn to draw inferences. It is a useful art, especially in\nAfrica. It suggests to me that, if you are right, the deed was not done\nby natives, who would never take the trouble to bury the dead. Arabs,\non the contrary, might do so, especially if there were any bastard\nPortuguese among them who called themselves Christians. But whatever\nhappened must have been a long while ago,\" and I pointed to a self-sown\nhardwood tree growing from the mound which could scarcely have been less\nthan twenty years old.\n\nWe returned to the house to find that our meal was ready. Hassan had\nasked us to dine with him, but for obvious reasons I preferred that\nSammy should cook our food and that he should dine with us. He appeared\nfull of compliments, though I could see hate and suspicion in his eye,\nand we fell to on the kid that we had bought from him, for I did not\nwish to accept any gifts from this fellow. Our drink was square-face\ngin, mixed with water that I sent Hans to fetch with his own hands from\nthe stream that ran by the house, lest otherwise it should be drugged.\n\nAt first Hassan, like a good Mohammedan, refused to touch any spirits,\nbut as the meal went on he politely relented upon this point, and I\npoured him out a liberal tot. The appetite comes in eating, as the\nFrenchman said, and the same thing applies to drinking. So at least it\nwas in Hassan's case, who probably thought that the quantity swallowed\nmade no difference to his sin. After the third dose of square-face he\ngrew quite amiable and talkative. Thinking the opportunity a good one,\nI sent for Sammy, and through him told our host that we were anxious to\nhire twenty porters to carry our packages. He declared that there was\nnot such a thing as a porter within a hundred miles, whereon I gave him\nsome more gin. The end of it was that we struck a bargain, I forget for\nhow much, he promising to find us twenty good men who were to stay with\nus for as long as we wanted them.\n\nThen I asked him about the destruction of the mission station, but\nalthough he was half-drunk, on this point he remained very close. All he\nwould say was that he had heard that twenty years ago the people called\nthe Mazitu, who were very fierce, had raided right down to the coast and\nkilled those who dwelt there, except a white man and his wife who had\nfled inland and never been seen again.\n\n\"How many of them were buried in that mound by the church?\" I asked\nquickly.\n\n\"Who told you they were buried there?\" he replied, with a start, but\nseeing his mistake, went on, \"I do not know what you mean. I never heard\nof anyone being buried. Sleep well, honoured lords, I must go and see to\nthe loading of my goods upon the _Maria_.\" Then rising, he salaamed and\nwalked, or rather rolled, away.\n\n\"So the _Maria_ hasn't sailed after all,\" I said, and whistled in a\ncertain fashion. Instantly Hans crept into the room out of the darkness,\nfor this was my signal to him.\n\n\"Hans,\" I said, \"I hear sounds upon that island. Slip down to the shore\nand spy out what is happening. No one will see you if you are careful.\"\n\n\"No, Baas,\" he answered with a grin, \"I do not think that anyone will\nsee Hans if he is careful, especially at night,\" and he slid away as\nquietly as he had come.\n\nNow I went out and spoke to Mavovo, telling him to keep a good watch\nand to be sure that every man had his gun ready, as I thought that these\npeople were slave-traders and might attack us in the night.\n\nIn that event, I said, they were to fall back upon the stoep, but not to\nfire until I gave the word.\n\n\"Good, my father,\" he answered. \"This is a lucky journey; I never\nthought there would be hope of war so soon. My Snake forgot to mention\nit the other night. Sleep safe, Macumazana. Nothing that walks shall\nreach you while we live.\"\n\n\"Don't be so sure,\" I answered, and we lay down in the bedroom with our\nclothes on and our rifles by our sides.\n\nThe next thing I remember was someone shaking me by the shoulder. I\nthought it was Stephen, who had agreed to keep awake for the first part\nof the night and to call me at one in the morning. Indeed, he was awake,\nfor I could see the glow from the pipe he smoked.\n\n\"Baas,\" whispered the voice of Hans, \"I have found out everything. They\nare loading the _Maria_ with slaves, taking them in big boats from the\nisland.\"\n\n\"So,\" I answered. \"But how did you get here? Are the hunters asleep\nwithout?\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"No, they are not asleep; they look with all their eyes and\nlisten with all their ears, yet old Hans passed through them; even the\nBaas Somers did not hear him.\"\n\n\"That I didn't,\" said Stephen; \"thought a rat was moving, no more.\"\n\nI stepped through the place where the door had been on to the stoep.\nBy the light of the fire which the hunters had lit without I could see\nMavovo sitting wide awake, his gun upon his knees, and beyond him two\nsentries. I called him and pointed to Hans.\n\n\"See,\" I said, \"what good watchmen you are when one can step over your\nheads and enter my room without your knowing it!\"\n\nMavovo looked at the Hottentot and felt his clothes and boots to see\nwhether they were wet with the night dew.\n\n\"_Ow!_\" he exclaimed in a surly voice, \"I said that nothing which walks\ncould reach you, Macumazana, but this yellow snake has crawled between\nus on his belly. Look at the new mud that stains his waistcoat.\"\n\n\"Yet snakes can bite and kill,\" answered Hans with a snigger. \"Oh! you\nZulus think that you are very brave, and shout and flourish spears and\nbattleaxes. One poor Hottentot dog is worth a whole impi of you after\nall. No, don't try to strike me, Mavovo the warrior, since we both serve\nthe same master in our separate ways. When it comes to fighting I will\nleave the matter to you, but when it is a case of watching or spying,\ndo you leave it to Hans. Look here, Mavovo,\" and he opened his hand in\nwhich was a horn snuff-box such as Zulus sometimes carry in their ears.\n\"To whom does this belong?\"\n\n\"It is mine,\" said Mavovo, \"and you have stolen it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" jeered Hans, \"it is yours. Also I stole it from your ear as I\npassed you in the dark. Don't you remember that you thought a gnat had\ntickled you and hit up at your face?\"\n\n\"It is true,\" growled Mavovo, \"and you, snake of a Hottentot, are great\nin your own low way. Yet next time anything tickles me, I shall strike,\nnot with my hand, but with a spear.\"\n\nThen I turned them both out, remarking to Stephen that this was a good\nexample of the eternal fight between courage and cunning. After this, as\nI was sure that Hassan and his friends were too busy to interfere with\nus that night, we went to bed and slept the sleep of the just.\n\nWhen I got up the next morning I found that Stephen Somers had already\nrisen and gone out, nor did he appear until I was half through my\nbreakfast.\n\n\"Where on earth have you been?\" I asked, noting that his clothes were\ntorn and covered with wet moss.\n\n\"Up the tallest of those palm trees, Quatermain. Saw an Arab climbing\none of them with a rope and got another Arab to teach me the trick. It\nisn't really difficult, though it looks alarming.\"\n\n\"What in the name of goodness----\" I began.\n\n\"Oh!\" he interrupted, \"my ruling passion. Looking through the glasses I\nthought I caught sight of an orchid growing near the crown, so went\nup. It wasn't an orchid after all, only a mass of yellow pollen. But I\nlearned something for my pains. Sitting in the top of that palm I saw\nthe _Maria_ working out from under the lee of the island. Also, far\naway, I noted a streak of smoke, and watching it through the glasses,\nmade out what looked to me uncommonly like a man-of-war steaming slowly\nalong the coast. In fact, I am sure it was, and English too. Then the\nmist came up and I lost sight of them.\"\n\n\"My word!\" I said, \"that will be the _Crocodile_. What I told our host,\nHassan, was not altogether bunkum. Mr. Cato, the port officer at Durban,\nmentioned to me that the _Crocodile_ was expected to call there within\nthe next fortnight to take in stores after a slave-hunting cruise down\nthe coast. Now it would be odd if she chanced to meet the _Maria_ and\nasked to have a look at her cargo, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Not at all, Quatermain, for unless one or the other of them changes her\ncourse that is just what she must do within the next hour or so, and I\njolly well hope she will. I haven't forgiven that beast, Delgado, the\ntrick he tried to play on us by slipping away with our goods, to say\nnothing of those poor devils of slaves. Pass the coffee, will you?\"\n\nFor the next ten minutes we ate in silence, for Stephen had an excellent\nappetite and was hungry after his morning climb.\n\nJust as we finished our meal Hassan appeared, looking even more\nvillainous than he had done the previous day. I saw also that he was\nin a truculent mood, induced perhaps by the headache from which he was\nevidently suffering as a result of his potations. Or perhaps the fact\nthat the _Maria_ had got safe away with the slaves, as he imagined\nunobserved by us, was the cause of the change of his demeanour. A third\nalternative may have been that he intended to murder us during the\nprevious night and found no safe opportunity of carrying out his amiable\nscheme.\n\nWe saluted him courteously, but without salaaming in reply he asked me\nbluntly through Sammy when we intended to be gone, as such \"Christian\ndogs defiled his house,\" which he wanted for himself.\n\nI answered, as soon as the twenty bearers whom he had promised us\nappeared, but not before.\n\n\"You lie,\" he said. \"I never promised you bearers; I have none here.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you shipped them all away in the _Maria_ with the\nslaves last night?\" I asked, sweetly.\n\nMy reader, have you ever taken note of the appearance and proceedings\nof a tom-cat of established age and morose disposition when a little\ndog suddenly disturbs it on the prowl? Have you observed how it contorts\nitself into arched but unnatural shapes, how it swells visibly to almost\ntwice its normal size, how its hair stands up and its eyes flash, and\nthe stream of unmentionable language that proceeds from its open mouth?\nIf so, you will have a very good idea of the effect produced upon Hassan\nby this remark of mine. The fellow looked as though he were going to\nburst with rage. He rolled about, his bloodshot eyes seemed to protrude,\nhe cursed us horribly, he put his hand upon the hilt of the great knife\nhe wore, and finally he did what the tom-cat does, he spat.\n\nNow, Stephen was standing with me, looking as cool as a cucumber and\nvery much amused, and being, as it chanced, a little nearer to Hassan\nthan I was, received the full benefit of this rude proceeding. My word!\ndidn't it wake him up. He said something strong, and the next second\nflew at the half-breed like a tiger, landing him a beauty straight upon\nthe nose. Back staggered Hassan, drawing his knife as he did so, but\nStephen's left in the eye caused him to drop it, as he dropped himself.\nI pounced upon the knife, and since it was too late to interfere, for\nthe mischief had been done, let things take their course and held back\nthe Zulus who had rushed up at the noise.\n\nHassan rose and, to do him credit, came on like a man, head down. His\ngreat skull caught Stephen, who was the lighter of the two, in the chest\nand knocked him over, but before the Arab could follow up the advantage,\nhe was on his feet again. Then ensued a really glorious mill. Hassan\nfought with head and fists and feet, Stephen with fists alone. Dodging\nhis opponent's rushes, he gave it to him as he passed, and soon his\ncoolness and silence began to tell. Once he was knocked over by a hooked\none under the jaw, but in the next round he sent the Arab literally\nflying head over heels. Oh! how those Zulus cheered, and I, too, danced\nwith delight. Up Hassan came again, spitting out several teeth and,\nadopting new tactics, grabbed Stephen round the middle. To and fro they\nswung, the Arab trying to kick the Englishman with his knees and to bite\nhim also, till the pain reminded him of the absence of his front teeth.\nOnce he nearly got him down--nearly, but not quite, for the collar by\nwhich he had gripped him (his object was to strangle) burst and, at that\njuncture, Hassan's turban fell over his face, blinding him for a moment.\n\nThen Stephen gripped him round the middle with his left arm and with his\nright pommelled him unmercifully till he sank in a sitting position to\nthe ground and held up his hand in token of surrender.\n\n\"The noble English lord has beaten me,\" he gasped.\n\n\"Apologise!\" yelled Stephen, picking up a handful of mud, \"or I shove\nthis down your dirty throat.\"\n\nHe seemed to understand. At any rate, he bowed till his forehead touched\nthe ground, and apologised very thoroughly.\n\n\"Now that is over,\" I said cheerfully to him, \"so how about those\nbearers?\"\n\n\"I have no bearers,\" he answered.\n\n\"You dirty liar,\" I exclaimed; \"one of my people has been down to your\nvillage there and says it is full of men.\"\n\n\"Then go and take them for yourself,\" he replied, viciously, for he knew\nthat the place was stockaded.\n\nNow I was in a fix. It was all very well to give a slave-dealer the\nthrashing he deserved, but if he chose to attack us with his Arabs we\nshould be in a poor way. Watching me with the eye that was not bunged\nup, Hassan guessed my perplexity.\n\n\"I have been beaten like a dog,\" he said, his rage returning to him with\nhis breath, \"but God is compassionate and just, He will avenge in due\ntime.\"\n\nThe words had not left his lips for one second when from somewhere out\nat sea there floated the sullen boom of a great gun. At this moment,\ntoo, an Arab rushed up from the shore, crying:\n\n\"Where is the Bey Hassan?\"\n\n\"Here,\" I said, pointing at him.\n\nThe Arab stared until I thought his eyes would drop out, for the Bey\nHassan was indeed a sight to see. Then he gabbled in a frightened voice:\n\n\"Captain, an English man-of-war is chasing the _Maria_.\"\n\nBoom went the great gun for the second time. Hassan said nothing, but\nhis jaw dropped, and I saw that he had lost exactly three teeth.\n\n\"That is the _Crocodile_,\" I remarked slowly, causing Sammy to\ntranslate, and as I spoke, produced from my inner pocket a Union Jack\nwhich I had placed there after I heard that the ship was sighted.\n\"Stephen,\" I went on as I shook it out, \"if you have got your wind,\nwould you mind climbing up that palm tree again and signalling with this\nto the _Crocodile_ out at sea?\"\n\n\"By George! that's a good idea,\" said Stephen, whose jovial face,\nalthough swollen, was now again wreathed in smiles. \"Hans, bring me a\nlong stick and a bit of string.\"\n\nBut Hassan did not think it at all a good idea.\n\n\"English lord,\" he gasped, \"you shall have the bearers. I will go to\nfetch them.\"\n\n\"No, you won't,\" I said, \"you will stop here as a hostage. Send that\nman.\"\n\nHassan uttered some rapid orders and the messenger sped away, this time\ntowards the stockaded village on the right.\n\nAs he went another messenger arrived, who also stared amazedly at the\ncondition of his chief.\n\n\"Bey--if you are the Bey,\" he said, in a doubtful voice, for by now\nthe amiable face of Hassan had begun to swell and colour, \"with the\ntelescope we have seen that the English man-of-war has sent a boat and\nboarded the _Maria_.\"\n\n\"God is great!\" muttered the discomfited Hassan, \"and Delgado, who is a\nthief and a traitor from his mother's breast, will tell the truth. The\nEnglish sons of Satan will land here. All is finished; nothing is left\nbut flight. Bid the people fly into the bush and take the slaves--I mean\ntheir servants. I will join them.\"\n\n\"No, you won't,\" I interrupted, through Sammy; \"at any rate, not at\npresent. You will come with us.\"\n\nThe miserable Hassan reflected, then he asked:\n\n\"Lord Quatermain\" (I remember the title, because it is the nearest I\never got, or am likely to get, to the peerage), \"if I furnish you with\nthe twenty bearers and accompany you for some days on your journey\ninland, will you promise not to signal to your countrymen on the ship\nand bring them ashore?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" I asked of Stephen.\n\n\"Oh!\" he answered, \"I think I'd agree. This scoundrel has had a pretty\ngood dusting, and if once the _Crocodile_ people land, there'll be an\nend of our expedition. As sure as eggs are eggs they will carry us off\nto Zanzibar or somewhere to give evidence before a slave court. Also\nnothing will be gained, for by the time the sailors get here, all these\nrascals will have bolted, except our friend, Hassan. You see it isn't\nas though we were sure he would be hung. He'd probably escape after all.\nInternational law, subject of a foreign Power, no direct proof--that\nkind of thing, you know.\"\n\n\"Give me a minute or two,\" I said, and began to reflect very deeply.\n\nWhilst I was thus engaged several things happened. I saw twenty natives\nbeing escorted towards us, doubtless the bearers who had been promised;\nalso I saw many others, accompanied by other natives, flying from the\nvillage into the bush. Lastly, a third messenger arrived, who announced\nthat the _Maria_ was sailing away, apparently in charge of a prize-crew,\nand that the man-of-war was putting about as though to accompany her.\nEvidently she had no intention of effecting a landing upon what was,\nnominally at any rate, Portuguese territory. Therefore, if anything was\nto be done, we must act at once.\n\nWell, the end of it was that, like a fool, I accepted Stephen's advice\nand did nothing, always the easiest course and generally that which\nleads to most trouble. Ten minutes afterwards I changed my mind, but\nthen it was too late; the _Crocodile_ was out of signalling distance.\nThis was subsequent to a conversation with Hans.\n\n\"Baas,\" said that worthy, in his leery fashion, \"I think you have made a\nmistake. You forget that these yellow devils in white robes who have\nrun away will come back again, and that when you return from up country,\nthey may be waiting for you. Now if the English man-of-war had destroyed\ntheir town, and their slave-sheds, they might have gone somewhere else.\nHowever,\" he added, as an afterthought, glancing at the disfigured\nHassan, \"we have their captain, and of course you mean to hang him,\nBaas. Or if you don't like to, leave it to me. I can hang men very well.\nOnce, when I was young, I helped the executioner at Cape Town.\"\n\n\"Get out,\" I said, but, nevertheless, I knew that Hans was right.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n                            THE SLAVE ROAD\n\nThe twenty bearers having arrived, in charge of five or six Arabs armed\nwith guns, we went to inspect them, taking Hassan with us, also\nthe hunters. They were a likely lot of men, though rather thin and\nscared-looking, and evidently, as I could see from their physical\nappearance and varying methods of dressing the hair, members of\ndifferent tribes. Having delivered them, the Arabs, or rather one of\nthem, entered into excited conversation with Hassan. As Sammy was not\nat hand I do not know what was said, although I gathered that they were\ncontemplating his rescue. If so, they gave up the idea and began to run\naway as their companions had done. One of them, however, a bolder fellow\nthan the rest, turned and fired at me. He missed by some yards, as I\ncould tell from the sing of the bullet, for these Arabs are execrable\nshots. Still his attempt at murder irritated me so much that I\ndetermined he should not go scot-free. I was carrying the little rifle\ncalled \"Intombi,\" that with which, as Hans had reminded me, I shot the\nvultures at Dingaan's kraal many years before. Of course, I could have\nkilled the man, but this I did not wish to do. Or I could have shot him\nthrough the leg, but then we should have had to nurse him or leave him\nto die! So I selected his right arm, which was outstretched as he fled,\nand at about fifty paces put a bullet through it just above the elbow.\n\n\"There,\" I said to the Zulus as I saw it double up, \"that low fellow\nwill never shoot at anyone again.\"\n\n\"Pretty, Macumazana, very pretty!\" said Mavovo, \"but as you can aim so\nwell, why not have chosen his head? That bullet is half-wasted.\"\n\nNext I set to work to get into communication with the bearers, who\nthought, poor devils, that they had been but sold to a new master. Here\nI may explain that they were slaves not meant for exportation, but men\nkept to cultivate Hassan's gardens. Fortunately I found that two of them\nbelonged to the Mazitu people, who it may be remembered are of the\nsame blood as the Zulus, although they separated from the parent stock\ngenerations ago. These men talked a dialect that I could understand,\nthough at first not very easily. The foundation of it was Zulu, but it\nhad become much mixed with the languages of other tribes whose women the\nMazitu had taken to wife.\n\nAlso there was a man who could speak some bastard Arabic, sufficiently\nwell for Sammy to converse with him.\n\nI asked the Mazitus if they knew the way back to their country. They\nanswered yes, but it was far off, a full month's journey. I told them\nthat if they would guide us thither, they should receive their freedom\nand good pay, adding that if the other men served us well, they also\nshould be set free when we had done with them. On receiving this\ninformation the poor wretches smiled in a sickly fashion and looked at\nHassan-ben-Mohammed, who glowered at them and us from the box on which\nhe was seated in charge of Mavovo.\n\nHow can we be free while that man lives, their look seemed to say. As\nthough to confirm their doubts Hassan, who understood or guessed what\nwas passing, asked by what right we were promising freedom to his\nslaves.\n\n\"By right of that,\" I answered, pointing to the Union Jack which Stephen\nstill had in his hand. \"Also we will pay you for them when we return,\naccording as they have served us.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he muttered, \"you will pay me for them when you return, or\nperhaps before that, Englishman.\"\n\nIt was three o'clock in the afternoon before we were able to make a\nstart. There was so much to be arranged that it might have been wiser\nto wait till the morrow, had we not determined that if we could help it\nnothing would induce us to spend another night in that place. Blankets\nwere served out to each of the bearers who, poor naked creatures, seemed\nquite touched at the gift of them; the loads were apportioned, having\nalready been packed at Durban in cases such as one man could carry. The\npack saddles were put upon the four donkeys which proved to be none the\nworse for their journey, and burdens to a weight of about 100 lbs. each\nfixed on them in waterproof hide bags, besides cooking calabashes and\nsleeping mats which Hans produced from somewhere. Probably he stole them\nout of the deserted village, but as they were necessary to us I confess\nI asked no questions. Lastly, six or eight goats which were wandering\nabout were captured to take with us for food till we could find game.\nFor these I offered to pay Hassan, but when I handed him the money he\nthrew it down in a rage, so I picked it up and put it in my pocket again\nwith a clear conscience.\n\nAt length everything was more or less ready, and the question arose as\nto what was to be done with Hassan. The Zulus, like Hans, wished to kill\nhim, as Sammy explained to him in his best Arabic. Then this murderous\nfellow showed what a coward he was at heart. He flung himself upon his\nknees, he wept, he invoked us in the name of the Compassionate Allah\nwho, he explained, was after all the same God that we worshipped, till\nMavovo, growing impatient of the noise, threatened him with his kerry,\nwhereon he became silent. The easy-natured Stephen was for letting him\ngo, a plan that seemed to have advantages, for then at least we should\nbe rid of his abominable company. After reflection, however, I decided\nthat we had better take him along with us, at any rate for a day or so,\nto hold as a hostage in case the Arabs should follow and attack us. At\nfirst he refused to stir, but the assegai of one of the Zulu hunters\npressed gently against what remained of his robe, furnished an argument\nthat he could not resist.\n\nAt length we were off. I with the two guides went ahead. Then came the\nbearers, then half of the hunters, then the four donkeys in charge of\nHans and Sammy, then Hassan and the rest of the hunters, except Mavovo,\nwho brought up the rear with Stephen. Needless to say, all our rifles\nwere loaded, and generally we were prepared for any emergency. The only\npath, that which the guides said we must follow, ran by the seashore\nfor a few hundred yards and then turned inland through Hassan's village\nwhere he lived, for it seemed that the old mission house was not used by\nhim. As we marched along a little rocky cliff--it was not more than ten\nfeet high--where a deep-water channel perhaps fifty yards in breadth\nseparated the mainland from the island whence the slaves had been loaded\non to the _Maria_, some difficulty arose about the donkeys. One of these\nslipped its load and another began to buck and evinced an inclination to\nleap into the sea with its precious burden. The rearguard of hunters ran\nto get hold of it, when suddenly there was a splash.\n\nThe brute's in! I thought to myself, till a shout told me that not\nthe ass, but Hassan had departed over the cliff's edge. Watching his\nopportunity and being, it was clear, a first-rate swimmer, he had flung\nhimself backwards in the midst of the confusion and falling into deep\nwater, promptly dived. About twenty yards from the shore he came up for\na moment, then dived again heading for the island. I dare say I could\nhave potted him through the head with a snap shot, but somehow I did\nnot like to kill a man swimming for his life as though he were a\nhippopotamus or a crocodile. Moreover, the boldness of the manoeuvre\nappealed to me. So I refrained from firing and called to the others to\ndo likewise.\n\nAs our late host approached the shore of the island I saw Arabs running\ndown the rocks to help him out of the water. Either they had not left\nthe place, or had re-occupied it as soon as H.M.S. _Crocodile_ had\nvanished with her prize. As it was clear that to recapture Hassan would\ninvolve an attack upon the garrison of the island which we were in no\nposition to carry out, I gave orders for the march to be resumed. These,\nthe difficulty with the donkey having been overcome, were obeyed at\nonce.\n\nIt was fortunate that we did not delay, for scarcely had the caravan got\ninto motion when the Arabs on the island began to fire at us. Luckily no\none was hit, and we were soon round a point and under cover; also their\nshooting was as bad as usual. One missile, however, it was a pot-leg,\nstruck a donkey-load and smashed a bottle of good brandy and a tin of\npreserved butter. This made me angry, so motioning to the others to\nproceed I took shelter behind a tree and waited till a torn and dirty\nturban, which I recognised as that of Hassan, poked up above a rock.\nWell, I put a bullet through that turban, for I saw the thing fly, but\nunfortunately, not through the head beneath it. Having left this P.P.C.\ncard on our host, I bolted from the rock and caught up the others.\n\nPresently we passed round the village; through it I would not go for\nfear of an ambuscade. It was quite a big place, enclosed with a strong\nfence, but hidden from the sea by a rise in the intervening land. In the\ncentre was a large eastern-looking house, where doubtless Hassan\ndwelt with his harem. After we had gone a little way further, to my\nastonishment I saw flames breaking out from the palm-leaf roof of this\nhouse. At the time I could not imagine how this happened, but when,\na day or two later, I observed Hans wearing a pair of large and very\nhandsome gold pendants in his ears and a gold bracelet on his wrist, and\nfound that he and one of the hunters were extremely well set up in the\nmatter of British sovereigns--well, I had my doubts. In due course\nthe truth came out. He and the hunter, an adventurous spirit, slipped\nthrough a gate in the fence without being observed, ran across the\ndeserted village to the house, stole the ornaments and money from the\nwomen's apartments and as they departed, fired the place \"in exchange\nfor the bottle of good brandy,\" as Hans explained.\n\nI was inclined to be angry, but after all, as we had been fired on,\nHans's exploit became an act of war rather than a theft. So I made him\nand his companion divide the gold equally with the rest of the hunters,\nwho no doubt had kept their eyes conveniently shut, not forgetting\nSammy, and said no more. They netted \u00a38 apiece, which pleased them very\nmuch. In addition to this I gave \u00a31 each, or rather goods to that value,\nto the bearers as their share of the loot.\n\nHassan, I remarked, was evidently a great agriculturist, for the gardens\nwhich he worked by slave labour were beautiful, and must have brought\nhim in a large revenue.\n\nPassing through these gardens we came to sloping land covered with bush.\nHere the track was not too good, for the creepers hampered our progress.\nIndeed, I was very glad when towards sunset we reached the crest of a\nhill and emerged upon a tableland which was almost clear of trees and\nrose gradually till it met the horizon. In that bush we might easily\nhave been attacked, but in this open country I was not so much afraid,\nsince the loss to the Arabs would have been great before we were\noverpowered. As a matter of fact, although spies dogged us for days no\nassault was ever attempted.\n\nFinding a convenient place by a stream we camped for the night, but as\nit was so fine, did not pitch the tents. Afterwards I was sorry that\nwe had not gone further from the water, since the mosquitoes bred by\nmillions in the marshes bordering the stream gave us a dreadful time. On\npoor Stephen, fresh from England, they fell with peculiar ferocity, with\nthe result that in the morning what between the bruises left by Hassan\nand their bites, he was a spectacle for men and angels. Another thing\nthat broke our rest was the necessity of keeping a strict watch in case\nthe slave-traders should elect to attack us in the hours of darkness;\nalso to guard against the possibility of our bearers running away and\nperhaps stealing the goods. It is true that before they went to sleep I\nexplained to them very clearly that any of them who attempted to give us\nthe slip would certainly be seen and shot, whereas if they remained with\nus they would be treated with every kindness. They answered through the\ntwo Mazitu that they had nowhere to go, and did not wish to fall again\ninto the power of Hassan, of whom they spoke literally with shudders,\npointing the while to their scarred backs and the marks of the slave\nyokes upon their necks. Their protestations seemed and indeed proved to\nbe sincere, but of this of course we could not then be sure.\n\nAs I was engaged at sunrise in making certain that the donkeys had not\nstrayed and generally that all was well, I noted through the thin mist\na little white object, which at first I thought was a small bird sitting\non an upright stick about fifty yards from the camp. I went towards it\nand discovered that it was not a bird but a folded piece of paper stuck\nin a cleft wand, such as natives often use for the carrying of letters.\nI opened the paper and with great difficulty, for the writing within was\nbad Portuguese, read as follows:\n\n\n \"English Devils.--Do not think that you have escaped me. I know\n  where you are going, and if you live through the journey it will\n  be but to die at my hands after all. I tell you that I have at my\n  command three hundred brave men armed with guns who worship Allah\n  and thirst for the blood of Christian dogs. With these I will\n  follow, and if you fall into my hands alive, you shall learn what\n  it is to die by fire or pinned over ant-heaps in the sun. Let us\n  see if your English man-of-war will help you then, or your false\n  God either. Misfortune go with you, white-skinned robbers of\n  honest men!\"\n\n\nThis pleasing epistle was unsigned, but its anonymous author was not\nhard to identify. I showed it to Stephen who was so infuriated at its\ncontents that he managed to dab some ammonia with which he was treating\nhis mosquito bites into his eye. When at length the pain was soothed by\nbathing, we concocted this answer:\n\n\n \"Murderer, known among men as Hassan-ben-Mohammed--Truly we sinned\n  in not hanging you when you were in our power. Oh! wolf who grows\n  fat upon the blood of the innocent, this is a fault that we shall\n  not commit again. Your death is near to you and we believe at our\n  hands. Come with all your villains whenever you will. The more\n  there are of them the better we shall be pleased, who would rather\n  rid the world of many fiends than of a few,\n\n                           \"Till we meet again, Allan Quatermain,\n                                                  Stephen Somers.\"\n\n\n\"Neat, if not Christian,\" I said when I had read the letter over.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Stephen, \"but perhaps just a little bombastic in tone. If\nthat gentleman did arrive with three hundred armed men--eh?\"\n\n\"Then, my boy,\" I answered, \"in this way or in that we shall thrash him.\nI don't often have an inspiration, but I've got one now, and it is to\nthe effect that Mr. Hassan has not very long to live and that we shall\nbe intimately connected with his end. Wait till you have seen a slave\ncaravan and you will understand my feelings. Also I know these gentry.\nThat little prophecy of ours will get upon his nerves and give him a\nforetaste of things. Hans, go and set this letter in that cleft stick.\nThe postman will call for it before long.\"\n\n\n\nAs it happened, within a few days we did see a slave caravan, some of\nthe merchandise of the estimable Hassan.\n\nWe had been making good progress through a beautiful and healthy\ncountry, steering almost due west, or rather a little to the north of\nwest. The land was undulating and rich, well-watered and only bush-clad\nin the neighbourhood of the streams, the higher ground being open, of\na park-like character, and dotted here and there with trees. It was\nevident that once, and not very long ago, the population had been dense,\nfor we came to the remains of many villages, or rather towns with large\nmarket-places. Now, however, these were burned with fire, or deserted,\nor occupied only by a few old bodies who got a living from the overgrown\ngardens. These poor people, who sat desolate and crooning in the sun, or\nperhaps worked feebly at the once fertile fields, would fly screaming\nat our approach, for to them men armed with guns must of necessity be\nslave-traders.\n\nStill from time to time we contrived to catch some of them, and through\none member of our party or the other to get at their stories. Really it\nwas all one story. The slaving Arabs, on this pretext or on that, had\nset tribe against tribe. Then they sided with the stronger and conquered\nthe weaker by aid of their terrible guns, killing out the old folk and\ntaking the young men, women and children (except the infants whom they\nbutchered) to be sold as slaves. It seemed that the business had begun\nabout twenty years before, when Hassan-ben-Mohammed and his companions\narrived at Kilwa and drove away the missionary who had built a station\nthere.\n\nAt first this trade was extremely easy and profitable, since the\nraw material lay near at hand in plenty. By degrees, however, the\nneighbouring communities had been worked out. Countless numbers of them\nwere killed, while the pick of the population passed under the slave\nyoke, and those of them who survived, vanished in ships to unknown\nlands. Thus it came about that the slavers were obliged to go further\nafield and even to conduct their raids upon the borders of the territory\nof the great Mazitu people, the inland race of Zulu origin of whom I\nhave spoken. According to our informants, it was even rumoured that they\nproposed shortly to attack these Mazitus in force, relying on their guns\nto give them the victory and open to them a new and almost inexhaustible\nstore of splendid human merchandise. Meanwhile they were cleaning out\ncertain small tribes which hitherto had escaped them, owing to the fact\nthat they had their residence in bush or among difficult hills.\n\nThe track we followed was the recognised slave road. Of this we soon\nbecame aware by the numbers of skeletons which we found lying in the\ntall grass at its side, some of them with heavy slave-sticks still upon\ntheir wrists. These, I suppose, had died from exhaustion, but others, as\ntheir split skulls showed had been disposed of by their captors.\n\nOn the eighth day of our march we struck the track of a slave caravan.\nIt had been travelling towards the coast, but for some reason or other\nhad turned back. This may have been because its leaders had been warned\nof the approach of our party. Or perhaps they had heard that another\ncaravan, which was at work in a different district, was drawing near,\nbringing its slaves with it, and wished to wait for its arrival in order\nthat they might join forces.\n\nThe spoor of these people was easy to follow. First we found the body\nof a boy of about ten. Then vultures revealed to us the remains of two\nyoung men, one of whom had been shot and the other killed by a blow from\nan axe. Their corpses were roughly hidden beneath some grass, I know not\nwhy. A mile or two further on we heard a child wailing and found it by\nfollowing its cries. It was a little girl of about four who had been\npretty, though now she was but a living skeleton. When she saw us she\nscrambled away on all fours like a monkey. Stephen followed her, while\nI, sick at heart, went to get a tin of preserved milk from our\nstores. Presently I heard him call to me in a horrified voice. Rather\nreluctantly, for I knew that he must have found something dreadful,\nI pushed my way through the bush to where he was. There, bound to the\ntrunk of a tree, sat a young woman, evidently the mother of the child,\nfor it clung to her leg.\n\nThank God she was still living, though she must have died before another\nday dawned. We cut her loose, and the Zulu hunters, who are kind folk\nenough when they are not at war, carried her to camp. In the end with\nmuch trouble we saved the lives of that mother and child. I sent for the\ntwo Mazitus, with whom I could by now talk fairly well, and asked them\nwhy the slavers did these things.\n\nThey shrugged their shoulders and one of them answered with a rather\ndreadful laugh:\n\n\"Because, Chief, these Arabs, being black-hearted, kill those who can\nwalk no more, or tie them up to die. If they let them go they might\nrecover and escape, and it makes the Arabs sad that those who have been\ntheir slaves should live to be free and happy.\"\n\n\"Does it? Does it indeed?\" exclaimed Stephen with a snort of rage that\nreminded me of his father. \"Well, if ever I get a chance I'll make them\nsad with a vengeance.\"\n\nStephen was a tender-hearted young man, and for all his soft and\nindolent ways, an awkward customer when roused.\n\nWithin forty-eight hours he got his chance, thus: That day we camped\nearly for two reasons. The first was that the woman and child we had\nrescued wee so weak they could not walk without rest, and we had no men\nto spare to carry them; the second that we came to an ideal spot to\npass the night. It was, as usual, a deserted village through which ran a\nbeautiful stream of water. Here we took possession of some outlying huts\nwith a fence round them, and as Mavovo had managed to shoot a fat eland\ncow and her half-grown calf, we prepared to have a regular feast. Whilst\nSammy was making some broth for the rescued woman, and Stephen and I\nsmoked our pipes and watched him, Hans slipped through the broken gate\nof the thorn fence, or _boma_, and announced that Arabs were coming, two\nlots of them with many slaves.\n\nWe ran out to look and saw that, as he had said, two caravans were\napproaching, or rather had reached the village, but at some distance\nfrom us, and were now camping on what had once been the market-place.\nOne of these was that whose track we had followed, although during the\nlast few hours of our march we had struck away from it, chiefly because\nwe could not bear such sights as I have described. It seemed to comprise\nabout two hundred and fifty slaves and over forty guards, all black men\ncarrying guns, and most of them by their dress Arabs, or bastard Arabs.\nIn the second caravan, which approached from another direction, were not\nmore than one hundred slaves and about twenty or thirty captors.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"let us eat our dinner and then, if you like, we will\ngo to call upon those gentlemen, just to show that we are not afraid\nof them. Hans, get the flag and tie it to the top of that tree; it will\nshow them to what country we belong.\"\n\nUp went the Union Jack duly, and presently through our glasses we saw\nthe slavers running about in a state of excitement; also we saw the poor\nslaves turn and stare at the bit of flapping bunting and then begin to\ntalk to each other. It struck me as possible that someone among their\nnumber had seen a Union Jack in the hands of an English traveller, or\nhad heard of it as flying upon ships or at points on the coast, and what\nit meant to slaves. Or they may have understood some of the remarks of\nthe Arabs, which no doubt were pointed and explanatory. At any rate,\nthey turned and stared till the Arabs ran among them with sjambocks,\nthat is, whips of hippopotamus hide, and suppressed their animated\nconversation with many blows.\n\nAt first I thought that they would break camp and march away; indeed,\nthey began to make preparations to do this, then abandoned the idea,\nprobably because the slaves were exhausted and there was no other water\nthey could reach before nightfall. In the end they settled down and lit\ncooking fires. Also, as I observed, they took precautions against attack\nby stationing sentries and forcing the slaves to construct a _boma_ of\nthorns about their camp.\n\n\"Well,\" said Stephen, when we had finished our dinner, \"are you ready\nfor that call?\"\n\n\"No!\" I answered, \"I do not think that I am. I have been considering\nthings, and concluded that we had better leave well alone. By this time\nthose Arabs will know all the story of our dealings with their worthy\nmaster, Hassan, for no doubt he has sent messengers to them. Therefore,\nif we go to their camp, they may shoot us at sight. Or, if they receive\nus well, they may offer hospitality and poison us, or cut our throats\nsuddenly. Our position might be better, still it is one that I believe\nthey would find difficult to take. So, in my opinion, we had better stop\nstill and await developments.\"\n\nStephen grumbled something about my being over-cautious, but I took no\nheed of him. One thing I did do, however. Sending for Hans, I told him\nto take one of the Mazitu--I dared not risk them both for they were our\nguides--and another of the natives whom we had borrowed from Hassan,\na bold fellow who knew all the local languages, and creep down to the\nslavers' camp as soon as it was quite dark. There I ordered him to find\nout what he could, and if possible to mix with the slaves and explain\nthat we were their friends. Hans nodded, for this was exactly the kind\nof task that appealed to him, and went off to make his preparations.\n\nStephen and I also made some preparations in the way of strengthening\nour defences, building large watch-fires and setting sentries.\n\nThe night fell, and Hans with his companions departed stealthily as\nsnakes. The silence was intense, save for the occasional wailings of\nthe slaves, which now and again broke out in bursts of melancholy sound,\n\"_La-lu-La-lua!_\" and then died away, to be followed by horrid screams\nas the Arabs laid their lashes upon some poor wretch. Once too, a shot\nwas fired.\n\n\"They have seen Hans,\" said Stephen.\n\n\"I think not,\" I answered, \"for if so there would have been more than\none shot. Either it was an accident or they were murdering a slave.\"\n\nAfter this nothing more happened for a long while, till at length Hans\nseemed to rise out of the ground in front of me, and behind him I saw\nthe figures of the Mazitu and the other man.\n\n\"Tell your story,\" I said.\n\n\"Baas, it is this. Between us we have learned everything. The Arabs know\nall about you and what men you have. Hassan has sent them orders to kill\nyou. It is well that you did not go to visit them, for certainly you\nwould have been murdered. We crept near and overheard their talk. They\npurpose to attack us at dawn to-morrow morning unless we leave this\nplace before, which they will know of as we are being watched.\"\n\n\"And if so, what then?\" I asked.\n\n\"Then, Baas, they will attack as we are making up the caravan, or\nimmediately afterwards as we begin to march.\"\n\n\"Indeed. Anything more, Hans?\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas. These two men crept among the slaves and spoke with\nthem. They are very sad, those slaves, and many of them have died of\nheart-pain because they have been taken from their homes and do not know\nwhere they are going. I saw one die just now; a young woman. She\nwas talking to another woman and seemed quite well, only tired, till\nsuddenly she said in a loud voice, 'I am going to die, that I may come\nback as a spirit and bewitch these devils till they are spirits too.'\nThen she called upon the fetish of her tribe, put her hands to her\nbreast and fell down dead. At least,\" added Hans, spitting reflectively,\n\"she did not fall quite down because the slave-stick held her head off\nthe ground. The Arabs were very angry, both because she had cursed them\nand was dead. One of them came and kicked her body and afterwards shot\nher little boy who was sick, because the mother had cursed them. But\nfortunately he did not see us, because we were in the dark far from the\nfire.\"\n\n\"Anything more, Hans?\"\n\n\"One thing, Baas. These two men lent the knives you gave them to two\nof the boldest among the slaves that they might cut the cords of the\nslave-sticks and the other cords with which they were tied, and then\npass them down the lines, that their brothers might do the same. But\nperhaps the Arabs will find it out, and then the Mazitu and the other\nmust lose their knives. That is all. Has the Baas a little tobacco?\"\n\n\"Now, Stephen,\" I said when Hans had gone and I had explained\neverything, \"there are two courses open to us. Either we can try to give\nthese gentlemen the slip at once, in which case we must leave the woman\nand child to their fate, or we can stop where we are and wait to be\nattacked.\"\n\n\"I won't run,\" said Stephen sullenly; \"it would be cowardly to desert\nthat poor creature. Also we should have a worse chance marching.\nRemember Hans said that they are watching us.\"\n\n\"Then you would wait to be attacked?\"\n\n\"Isn't there a third alternative, Quatermain? To attack them?\"\n\n\"That's the idea,\" I said. \"Let us send for Mavovo.\"\n\nPresently he came and sat down in front of us, while I set out the case\nto him.\n\n\"It is the fashion of my people to attack rather than to be attacked,\nand yet, my father, in this case my heart is against it. Hans\" (he\ncalled him _Inblatu_, a Zulu word which means Spotted Snake, that was\nthe Hottentot's Kaffir name) \"says that there are quite sixty of the\nyellow dogs, all armed with guns, whereas we have not more than fifteen,\nfor we cannot trust the slave men. Also he says that they are within a\nstrong fence and awake, with spies out, so that it will be difficult to\nsurprise them. But here, father, we are in a strong fence and cannot be\nsurprised. Also men who torture and kill women and children, except in\nwar must, I think, be cowards, and will come on faintly against good\nshooting, if indeed they come at all. Therefore, I say, 'Wait till\nthe buffalo shall either charge or run.' But the word is with you,\nMacumazana, wise Watcher-by-Night, not with me, your hunter. Speak, you\nwho are old in war, and I will obey.\"\n\n\"You argue well,\" I answered; \"also another reason comes to my mind.\nThose Arab brutes may get behind the slaves, of whom we should butcher\na lot without hurting them. Stephen, I think we had better see the thing\nthrough here.\"\n\n\"All right, Quatermain. Only I hope that Mavovo is wrong in thinking\nthat those blackguards may change their minds and run away.\"\n\n\"Really, young man, you are becoming very blood-thirsty--for an orchid\ngrower,\" I remarked, looking at him. \"Now, for my part, I devoutly hope\nthat Mavovo is right, for let me tell you, if he isn't it may be a nasty\njob.\"\n\n\"I've always been peaceful enough up to the present,\" replied Stephen.\n\"But the sight of those unhappy wretches of slaves with their heads cut\nopen, and of the woman tied to a tree to starve----\"\n\n\"Make you wish to usurp the functions of God Almighty,\" I said. \"Well,\nit is a natural impulse and perhaps, in the circumstances, one that will\nnot displease Him. And now, as we have made up our minds what we are\ngoing to do, let's get to business so that these Arab gentlemen may find\ntheir breakfast ready when they come to call.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n                        THE RUSH OF THE SLAVES\n\nWell, we did all that we could in the way of making ready. After we had\nstrengthened the thorn fence of our _boma_ as much as possible and lit\nseveral large fires outside of it to give us light, I allotted his place\nto each of the hunters and saw that their rifles were in order and that\nthey had plenty of ammunition. Then I made Stephen lie down to sleep,\ntelling him that I would wake him to watch later on. This, however,\nI had no intention of doing as I wanted him to rise fresh and with a\nsteady nerve on the occasion of his first fight.\n\nAs soon as I saw that his eyes were shut I sat down on a box to think.\nTo tell the truth, I was not altogether happy in my mind. To begin with\nI did not know how the twenty bearers would behave under fire. They\nmight be seized with panic and rush about, in which case I determined to\nlet them out of the _boma_ to take their chance, for panic is a catching\nthing.\n\nA worse matter was our rather awkward position. There were a good many\ntrees round the camp among which an attacking force could take cover.\nBut what I feared much more than this, or even than the reedy banks of\nthe stream along which they could creep out of reach of our bullets, was\na sloping stretch of land behind us, covered with thick grass and scrub\nand rising to a crest about two hundred yards away. Now if the Arabs got\nround to this crest they would fire straight into our _boma_ and make it\nuntenable. Also if the wind were in their favour, they might burn us out\nor attack under the clouds of smoke. As a matter of fact, by the special\nmercy of Providence, none of these things happened, for a reason which I\nwill explain presently.\n\nIn the case of a night, or rather a dawn attack, I have always found\nthat hour before the sky begins to lighten very trying indeed. As a rule\neverything that can be done is done, so that one must sit idle. Also\nit is then that both the physical and the moral qualities are at their\nlowest ebb, as is the mercury in the thermometer. The night is dying,\nthe day is not yet born. All nature feels the influence of that hour.\nThen bad dreams come, then infants wake and call, then memories of\nthose who are lost to us arise, then the hesitating soul often takes its\nplunge into the depths of the Unknown. It is not wonderful, therefore,\nthat on this occasion the wheels of Time drave heavily for me. I knew\nthat the morning was at hand by many signs. The sleeping bearers turned\nand muttered in their sleep, a distant lion ceased its roaring and\ndeparted to its own place, an alert-minded cock crew somewhere, and our\ndonkeys rose and began to pull at their tether-ropes. As yet, however,\nit was quite dark. Hans crept up to me; I saw his wrinkled, yellow face\nin the light of the watch-fire.\n\n\"I smell the dawn,\" he said and vanished again.\n\nMavovo appeared, his massive frame silhouetted against the blackness.\n\n\"Watcher-by-Night, the night is done,\" he said. \"If they come at all,\nthe enemy should soon be here.\"\n\nSaluting, he too passed away into the dark, and presently I heard the\nsounds of spear-blades striking together and of rifles being cocked.\n\nI went to Stephen and woke him. He sat up yawning, muttered something\nabout greenhouses; then remembering, said:\n\n\"Are those Arabs coming? We are in for a fight at last. Jolly, old\nfellow, isn't it?\"\n\n\"You are a jolly old fool!\" I answered inconsequently; and marched off\nin a rage.\n\nMy mind was uneasy about this inexperienced young man. If anything\nshould happen to him, what should I say to his father? Well, in that\nevent, it was probable that something would happen to me too. Very\npossibly we should both be dead in an hour. Certainly I had no intention\nof allowing myself to be taken alive by those slaving devils. Hassan's\nremarks about fires and ant-heaps and the sun were too vividly impressed\nupon my memory.\n\nIn another five minutes everybody was up, though it required kicks to\nrouse most of the bearers from their slumbers. They, poor men, were\naccustomed to the presence of Death and did not suffer him to disturb\ntheir sleep. Still I noted that they muttered together and seemed\nalarmed.\n\n\"If they show signs of treachery, you must kill them,\" I said to Mavovo,\nwho nodded in his grave, silent fashion.\n\nOnly we left the rescued slave-woman and her child plunged in the stupor\nof exhaustion in a corner of the camp. What was the use of disturbing\nher?\n\nSammy, who seemed far from comfortable, brought two pannikins of coffee\nto Stephen and myself.\n\n\"This is a momentous occasion, Messrs. Quatermain and Somers,\" he said\nas he gave us the coffee, and I noted that his hand shook and his teeth\nchattered. \"The cold is extreme,\" he went on in his copybook English by\nway of explaining these physical symptoms which he saw I had observed.\n\"Mr. Quatermain, it is all very well for you to paw the ground and smell\nthe battle from afar, as is written in the Book of Job. But I was not\nbrought up to the trade and take it otherwise. Indeed I wish I was back\nat the Cape, yes, even within the whitewashed walls of the Place of\nDetention.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" I muttered, keeping my right foot on the ground with\ndifficulty.\n\nBut Stephen laughed outright and asked:\n\n\"What will you do, Sammy, when the fighting begins?\"\n\n\"Mr. Somers,\" he answered, \"I have employed some wakeful hours in making\na hole behind that tree-trunk, through which I hope bullets will not\npass. There, being a man of peace, I shall pray for our success.\"\n\n\"And if the Arabs get in, Sammy?\"\n\n\"Then, sir, under Heaven, I shall trust to the fleetness of my legs.\"\n\nI could stand it no longer, my right foot flew up and caught Sammy in\nthe place at which I had aimed. He vanished, casting a reproachful look\nbehind him.\n\nJust then a terrible clamour arose in the slavers' camp which hitherto\nhad been very silent, and just then also the first light of dawn glinted\non the barrels of our guns.\n\n\"Look out!\" I cried, as I gulped down the last of my coffee, \"there's\nsomething going on there.\"\n\nThe clamour grew louder and louder till it seemed to fill the skies with\na concentrated noise of curses and shrieking. Distinct from it, as it\nwere, I heard shouts of alarm and rage, and then came the sounds of\ngunshots, yells of agony and the thud of many running feet. By now\nthe light was growing fast, as it does when once it comes in these\nlatitudes. Three more minutes, and through the grey mist of the dawn\nwe saw dozens of black figures struggling up the slope towards us. Some\nseemed to have logs of wood tied behind them, others crawled along on\nall fours, others dragged children by the hand, and all yelled at the\ntop of their voices.\n\n\"The slaves are attacking us,\" said Stephen, lifting his rifle.\n\n\"Don't shoot,\" I cried. \"I think they have broken loose and are taking\nrefuge with us.\"\n\nI was right. These unfortunates had used the two knives which our men\nsmuggled to them to good purpose. Having cut their bonds during the\nnight they were running to seek the protection of the Englishmen and\ntheir flag. On they surged, a hideous mob, the slave-sticks still fast\nto the necks of many of them, for they had not found time or opportunity\nto loose them all, while behind came the Arabs firing. The position\nwas clearly very serious, for if they burst into our camp, we should\nbe overwhelmed by their rush and fall victims to the bullets of their\ncaptors.\n\n\"Hans,\" I cried, \"take the men who were with you last night and try\nto lead those slaves round behind us. Quick! Quick now before we are\nstamped flat.\"\n\nHans darted away, and presently I saw him and the two other men running\ntowards the approaching crowd, Hans waving a shirt or some other white\nobject to attract their attention. At the time the foremost of them had\nhalted and were screaming, \"Mercy, English! Save us, English!\" having\ncaught sight of the muzzles of our guns.\n\nThis was a fortunate occurrence indeed, for otherwise Hans and his\ncompanions could never have stopped them. The next thing I saw was the\nwhite shirt bearing away to the left on a line which led past the fence\nof our _boma_ into the scrub and high grass behind the camp. After it\nstruggled and scrambled the crowd of slaves like a flock of sheep after\nthe bell-wether. To them Hans's shirt was a kind of \"white helmet of\nNavarre.\"\n\nSo that danger passed by. Some of the slaves had been struck by the Arab\nbullets or trodden down in the rush or collapsed from weakness, and at\nthose of them who still lived the pursuers were firing. One woman, who\nhad fallen under the weight of the great slave-stick which was fastened\nabout her throat, was crawling forward on her hands and knees. An Arab\nfired at her and the bullet struck the ground under her stomach but\nwithout hurting her, for she wriggled forward more quickly. I was sure\nthat he would shoot again, and watched. Presently, for by now the light\nwas good, I saw him, a tall fellow in a white robe, step from behind the\nshelter of a banana-tree about a hundred and fifty yards away, and take\na careful aim at the woman. But I too took aim and--well, I am not bad\nat this kind of snap-shooting when I try. That Arab's gun never went\noff. Only he went up two feet or more into the air and fell backwards,\nshot through the head which was the part of his person that I had\ncovered.\n\nThe hunters uttered a low \"_Ow!_\" of approval, while Stephen, in a sort\nof ecstasy, exclaimed:\n\n\"Oh! what a heavenly shot!\"\n\n\"Not bad, but I shouldn't have fired it,\" I answered, \"for they haven't\nattacked us yet. It is a kind of declaration of war, and,\" I added, as\nStephen's sun-helmet leapt from his head, \"there's the answer. Down, all\nof you, and fire through the loopholes.\"\n\nThen the fight began. Except for its grand finale it wasn't really\nmuch of a fight when compared with one or two we had afterwards on this\nexpedition. But, on the other hand, its character was extremely awkward\nfor us. The Arabs made one rush at the beginning, shouting on Allah as\nthey came. But though they were plucky villains they did not repeat that\nexperiment. Either by good luck or good management Stephen knocked\nover two of them with his double-barrelled rifle, and I also emptied\nmy large-bore breech-loader--the first I ever owned--among them, not\nwithout results, while the hunters made a hit or two.\n\nAfter this the Arabs took cover, getting behind trees and, as I had\nfeared, hiding in the reeds on the banks of the stream. Thence they\nharassed us a great deal, for amongst them were some very decent shots.\nIndeed, had we not taken the precaution of lining the thorn fence with a\nthick bank of earth and sods, we should have fared badly. As it was, one\nof the hunters was killed, the bullet passing through the loophole\nand striking him in the throat as he was about to fire, while the\nunfortunate bearers who were on rather higher ground, suffered a good\ndeal, two of them being dispatched outright and four wounded. After this\nI made the rest of them lie flat on the ground close against the fence,\nin such a fashion that we could fire over their bodies.\n\nSoon it became evident that there were more of these Arabs than we had\nthought, for quite fifty of them were firing from different places.\nMoreover, by slow degrees they were advancing with the evident object\nof outflanking us and gaining the high ground behind. Some of them, of\ncourse, we stopped as they rushed from cover to cover, but this kind of\nshooting was as difficult as that at bolting rabbits across a woodland\nride, and to be honest, I must say that I alone was much good at the\ngame, for here my quick eye and long practice told.\n\nWithin an hour the position had grown very serious indeed, so much so\nthat we found it necessary to consider what should be done. I pointed\nout that with our small number a charge against the scattered riflemen,\nwho were gradually surrounding us, would be worse than useless, while\nit was almost hopeless to expect to hold the _boma_ till nightfall.\nOnce the Arabs got behind us, they could rake us from the higher ground.\nIndeed, for the last half-hour we had directed all our efforts to\npreventing them from passing this _boma_, which, fortunately, the stream\non the one side and a stretch of quite open land on the other made it\nvery difficult for them to do without more loss than they cared to face.\n\n\"I fear there is only one thing for it,\" I said at length, during\na pause in the attack while the Arabs were either taking counsel or\nwaiting for more ammunition, \"to abandon the camp and everything and\nbolt up the hill. As those fellows must be tired and we are all good\nrunners, we may save our lives in that way.\"\n\n\"How about the wounded,\" asked Stephen, \"and the slave-woman and child?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I answered, looking down.\n\nOf course I did know very well, but here, in an acute form, arose the\nancient question: Were we to perish for the sake of certain individuals\nin whom we had no great interest and whom we could not save by remaining\nwith them? If we stayed where we were our end seemed fairly certain,\nwhereas if we ran for it, we had a good chance of escape. But this\ninvolved the desertion of several injured bearers and a woman and\nchild whom we had picked up starving, all of whom would certainly be\nmassacred, save perhaps the woman and child.\n\nAs these reflections flitted through my brain I remembered that a\ndrunken Frenchman named Leblanc, whom I had known in my youth and who\nhad been a friend of Napoleon, or so he said, told me that the great\nemperor when he was besieging Acre in the Holy Land, was forced to\nretreat. Being unable to carry off his wounded men, he left them in\na monastery on Mount Carmel, each with a dose of poison by his side.\nApparently they did not take the poison, for according to Leblanc, who\nsaid he was present there (not as a wounded man), the Turks came and\nbutchered them. So Napoleon chose to save his own life and that of his\narmy at the expense of his wounded. But, after all, I reflected, he\nwas no shining example to Christian men and I hadn't time to find any\npoison. In a few words I explained the situation to Mavovo, leaving out\nthe story of Napoleon, and asked his advice.\n\n\"We must run,\" he answered. \"Although I do not like running, life is\nmore than stores, and he who lives may one day pay his debts.\"\n\n\"But the wounded, Mavovo; we cannot carry them.\"\n\n\"I will see to them, Macumazana; it is the fortune of war. Or if they\nprefer it, we can leave them--to be nursed by the Arabs,\" which of\ncourse was just Napoleon and his poison over again.\n\nI confess that I was about to assent, not wishing that I and Stephen,\nespecially Stephen, should be potted in an obscure engagement with some\nmiserable slave-traders, when something happened.\n\nIt will be remembered that shortly after dawn Hans, using a shirt for a\nflag, had led the fugitive slaves past the camp up to the hill behind.\nThere he and they had vanished, and from that moment to this we had seen\nnothing of him or them. Now of a sudden he reappeared still waving the\nshirt. After him rushed a great mob of naked men, two hundred of them\nperhaps, brandishing slave-sticks, stones and the boughs of trees. When\nthey had almost reached the _boma_ whence we watched them amazed, they\nsplit into two bodies, half of them passing to our left, apparently\nunder the command of the Mazitu who had accompanied Hans to the\nslave-camp, and the other half to the right following the old Hottentot\nhimself. I stared at Mavovo, for I was too thunderstruck to speak.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mavovo, \"that Spotted Snake of yours\" (he referred to Hans),\n\"is great in his own way, for he has even been able to put courage into\nthe hearts of slaves. Do you not understand, my father, that they are\nabout to attack those Arabs, yes, and to pull them down, as wild dogs do\na buffalo calf?\"\n\nIt was true: this was the Hottentot's superb design. Moreover, it\nsucceeded. Up on the hillside he had watched the progress of the fight\nand seen how it must end. Then, through the interpreter who was with\nhim, he harangued those slaves, pointing out to them that we, their\nwhite friends, were about to be overwhelmed, and that they must either\nstrike for themselves, or return to the yoke. Among them were some who\nhad been warriors in their own tribes, and through these he stirred the\nothers. They seized the slave-sticks from which they had been freed,\npieces of rock, anything that came to their hands, and at a given signal\ncharged, leaving only the women and children behind them.\n\nSeeing them come the scattered Arabs began to fire at them, killing\nsome, but thereby revealing their own hiding-places. At these the slaves\nrushed. They hurled themselves upon the Arabs; they tore them, they\ndashed out their brains in such fashion that within another five minutes\nquite two-thirds of them were dead; and the rest, of whom we took some\ntoll with our rifles as they bolted from cover, were in full flight.\n\nIt was a terrible vengeance. Never did I witness a more savage scene\nthan that of these outraged men wreaking their wrongs upon their\ntormentors. I remember that when most of the Arabs had been killed and\na few were escaped, the slaves found one, I think it was the captain of\nthe gang, who had hidden himself in a little patch of dead reeds washed\nup by the stream. Somehow they managed to fire these; I expect that\nHans, who had remained discreetly in the background after the fighting\nbegan, emerged when it was over and gave them a match. In due course out\ncame the wretched Arab. Then they flung themselves on him as marching\nants do upon a caterpillar, and despite his cries for mercy, tore him to\nfragments, literally to fragments. Being what they were, it was hard\nto blame them. If we had seen our parents shot, our infants pitilessly\nbutchered, our homes destroyed and our women and children marched off\nin the slave-sticks to be sold into bondage, should we not have done the\nsame? I think so, although we are not ignorant savages.\n\nThus our lives were saved by those whom we had tried to save, and for\nonce justice was done even in those dark parts of Africa, for in that\ntime they were dark indeed. Had it not been for Hans and the courage\nwhich he managed to inspire into the hearts of these crushed blacks, I\nhave little doubt but that before nightfall we should have been dead,\nfor I do not think that any attempt at retreat would have proved\nsuccessful. And if it had, what would have happened to us in that wild\ncountry surrounded by enemies and with only the few rounds of ammunition\nthat we could have carried in our flight?\n\n\"Ah! Baas,\" said the Hottentot a little while later, squinting at me\nwith his bead-like eyes, \"after all you did well to listen to my prayer\nand bring me with you. Old Hans is a drunkard, yes, or at least he used\nto be, and old Hans gambles, yes, and perhaps old Hans will go to hell.\nBut meanwhile old Hans can think, as he thought one day before the\nattack on Maraisfontein, as he thought one day on the Hill of Slaughter\nby Dingaan's kraal, and as he thought this morning up there among the\nbushes. Oh! he knew how it must end. He saw that those dogs of Arabs\nwere cutting down a tree to make a bridge across that deep stream and\nget round to the high ground at the back of you, whence they would\nhave shot you all in five minutes. And now, Baas, my stomach feels very\nqueer. There was no breakfast on the hillside and the sun was very\nhot. I think that just one tot of brandy--oh! I know, I promised not to\ndrink, but if _you_ give it me the sin is yours, not mine.\"\n\nWell, I gave him the tot, a stiff one, which he drank quite neat,\nalthough it was against my principles, and locked up the bottle\nafterwards. Also I shook the old fellow's hand and thanked him, which\nseemed to please him very much, for he muttered something to the effect\nthat it was nothing, since if I had died he would have died too, and\ntherefore he was thinking of himself, not of me. Also two big tears\ntrickled down his snub nose, but these may have been produced by the\nbrandy.\n\nWell, we were the victors and elated as may be imagined, for we knew\nthat the few slavers who had escaped would not attack us again. Our\nfirst thought was for food, for it was now past midday and we were\nstarving. But dinner presupposed a cook, which reminded us of Sammy.\nStephen, who was in such a state of jubilation that he danced rather\nthan walked, the helmet with a bullet-hole through it stuck ludicrously\nupon the back of his head, started to look for him, and presently called\nto me in an alarmed voice. I went to the back of the camp and, staring\ninto a hole like a small grave, that had been hollowed behind a solitary\nthorn tree, at the bottom of which lay a huddled heap, I found him. It\nwas Sammy to all appearance. We got hold of him, and up he came, limp,\nsenseless, but still holding in his hand a large, thick Bible, bound in\nboards. Moreover, in the exact centre of this Bible was a bullet-hole,\nor rather a bullet which had passed through the stout cover and buried\nitself in the paper behind. I remember that the point of it reached to\nthe First Book of Samuel.\n\nAs for Sammy himself, he seemed to be quite uninjured, and indeed after\nwe had poured some water on him--he was never fond of water--he revived\nquickly enough. Then we found out what had happened.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I was seated in my place of refuge, being as I\nhave told you a man of peace, enjoying the consolation of religion\"--he\nwas very pious in times of trouble. \"At length the firing slackened, and\nI ventured to peep out, thinking that perhaps the foe had fled, holding\nthe Book in front of my face in case of accidents. After that I remember\nno more.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Stephen, \"for the bullet hit the Bible and the Bible hit your\nhead and knocked you silly.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Sammy, \"how true is what I was taught that the Book shall be\na shield of defence to the righteous. Now I understand why I was moved\nto bring the thick old Bible that belonged to my mother in heaven,\nand not the little thin one given to me by the Sunday school teacher,\nthrough which the ball of the enemy would have passed.\"\n\nThen he went off to cook the dinner.\n\nCertainly it was a wonderful escape, though whether this was a direct\nreward of his piety, as he thought, is another matter.\n\nAs soon as we had eaten, we set to work to consider our position, of\nwhich the crux was what to do with the slaves. There they sat in groups\noutside the fence, many of them showing traces of the recent conflict,\nand stared at us stupidly. Then of a sudden, as though with one voice,\nthey began to clamour for food.\n\n\"How are we to feed several hundred people?\" asked Stephen.\n\n\"The slavers must have done it somehow,\" I answered. \"Let's go and\nsearch their camp.\"\n\nSo we went, followed by our hungry clients, and, in addition to many\nmore things, to our delight found a great store of rice, mealies and\nother grain, some of which was ground into meal. Of this we served out\nan ample supply together with salt, and soon the cooking pots were full\nof porridge. My word! how those poor creatures did eat, nor, although\nit was necessary to be careful, could we find it in our hearts to stint\nthem of the first full meal that had passed their lips after weeks\nof starvation. When at length they were satisfied we addressed them,\nthanking them for their bravery, telling them that they were free and\nasking what they meant to do.\n\nUpon this point they seemed to have but one idea. They said that they\nwould come with us who were their protectors. Then followed a great\n_indaba_, or consultation, which really I have not time to set out.\nThe end of it was that we agreed that so many of them as wished should\naccompany us till they reached country that they knew, when they would\nbe at liberty to depart to their own homes. Meanwhile we divided up the\nblankets and other stores of the Arabs, such as trade goods and beads,\namong them, and then left them to their own devices, after placing a\nguard over the foodstuffs. For my part I hoped devoutly that in the\nmorning we should find them gone.\n\nAfter this we returned to our _boma_ just in time to assist at a sad\nceremony, that of the burial of my hunter who had been shot through the\nhead. His companions had dug a deep hole outside the fence and within\na few yards of where he fell. In this they placed him in a sitting\nposition with his face turned towards Zululand, setting by his side two\ngourds that belonged to him, one filled with water and the other with\ngrain. Also they gave him a blanket and his two assegais, tearing the\nblanket and breaking the handles of the spears, to \"kill\" them as they\nsaid. Then quietly enough they threw in the earth about him and filled\nthe top of the hole with large stones to prevent the hyenas from digging\nhim up. This done, one by one, they walked past the grave, each man\nstopping to bid him farewell by name. Mavovo, who came last, made a\nlittle speech, telling the deceased to _namba kachle_, that is, go\ncomfortably to the land of ghosts, as, he added, no doubt he would do\nwho had died as a man should. He requested him, moreover, if he returned\nas a spirit, to bring good and not ill-fortune on us, since otherwise\nwhen he, Mavovo, became a spirit in his turn, he would have words to say\nto him on the matter. In conclusion, he remarked that as his, Mavovo's\nSnake, had foretold this event at Durban, a fact with which the deceased\nwould now be acquainted he, the said deceased, could never complain of\nnot having received value for the shilling he had paid as a divining\nfee.\n\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed one of the hunters with a note of anxiety in his voice,\n\"but your Snake mentioned six of us to you, O doctor!\"\n\n\"It did,\" replied Mavovo, drawing a pinch of snuff up his uninjured\nnostril, \"and our brother there was the first of the six. Be not afraid,\nthe other five will certainly join him in due course, for my Snake must\nspeak the truth. Still, if anyone is in a hurry,\" and he glared round\nthe little circle, \"let him stop and talk with me alone. Perhaps I could\narrange that his turn----\" here he stopped, for they were all gone.\n\n\"Glad _I_ didn't pay a shilling to have my fortune told by Mavovo,\" said\nStephen, when we were back in the _boma_, \"but why did they bury his\npots and spears with him?\"\n\n\"To be used by the spirit on its journey,\" I answered. \"Although they do\nnot quite know it, these Zulus believe, like all the rest of the world,\nthat man lives on elsewhere.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n                           THE MAGIC MIRROR\n\nI did not sleep very well that night, for now that the danger was over\nI found that the long strain of it had told upon my nerves. Also there\nwere many noises. Thus, the bearers who were shot had been handed over\nto their companions, who disposed of them in a simple fashion, namely by\nthrowing them into the bush where they attracted the notice of hyenas.\nThen the four wounded men who lay near to me groaned a good deal, or\nwhen they were not groaning uttered loud prayers to their local gods.\nWe had done the best we could for these unlucky fellows. Indeed, that\nkind-hearted little coward, Sammy, who at some time in his career served\nas a dresser in a hospital, had tended their wounds, none of which were\nmortal, very well indeed, and from time to time rose to minister to\nthem.\n\nBut what disturbed me most was the fearful hubbub which came from\nthe camp below. Many of the tropical African tribes are really\nsemi-nocturnal in their habits, I suppose because there the night is\ncooler than the day, and on any great occasion this tendency asserts\nitself.\n\nThus every one of these freed slaves seemed to be howling his loudest to\nan accompaniment of clashing iron pots or stones, which, lacking their\nnative drums, they beat with sticks.\n\nMoreover, they had lit large fires, about which they flitted in an\nominous and unpleasant fashion, that reminded me of some mediaeval\npictures of hell, which I had seen in an old book.\n\nAt last I could stand it no longer, and kicking Hans who, curled up like\na dog, slept at my feet, asked him what was going on. His answer caused\nme to regret the question.\n\n\"Plenty of those slaves cannibal men, Baas. Think they eat the Arabs and\nlike them very much,\" he said with a yawn, then went to sleep again.\n\nI did not continue the conversation.\n\nWhen at length we made a start on the following morning the sun was high\nover us. Indeed, there was a great deal to do. The guns and ammunition\nof the dead Arabs had to be collected; the ivory, of which they carried\na good store, must be buried, for to take it with us was impossible, and\nthe loads apportioned.[*] Also it was necessary to make litters for the\nwounded, and to stir up the slaves from their debauch, into the nature\nof which I made no further inquiries, was no easy task. On mustering\nthem I found that a good number had vanished during the night, where\nto I do not know. Still a mob of well over two hundred people, a\nconsiderable portion of whom were women and children, remained, whose\none idea seemed to be to accompany us wherever we might wander. So with\nthis miscellaneous following at length we started.\n\n[*] To my sorrow we never saw this ivory again.--A.Q.\n\nTo describe our adventures during the next month would be too long if\nnot impossible, for to tell the truth, after the lapse of so many years,\nthese have become somewhat entangled in my mind. Our great difficulty\nwas to feed such a multitude, for the store of rice and grain, upon\nwhich we were quite unable to keep a strict supervision, they soon\ndevoured. Fortunately the country through which we passed, at this time\nof the year (the end of the wet season) was full of game, of which,\ntravelling as we did very slowly, we were able to shoot a great deal.\nBut this game killing, delightful as it may be to the sportsman,\nsoon palled on us as a business. To say nothing of the expenditure of\nammunition, it meant incessant work.\n\nAgainst this the Zulu hunters soon began to murmur, for, as Stephen and\nI could rarely leave the camp, the burden of it fell on them. Ultimately\nI hit upon this scheme. Picking out thirty or forty of the likeliest men\namong the slaves, I served out to each of them ammunition and one of the\nArab guns, in the use of which we drilled them as best we could. Then\nI told them that they must provide themselves and their companions with\nmeat. Of course accidents happened. One man was accidentally shot and\nthree others were killed by a cow elephant and a wounded buffalo. But in\nthe end they learned to handle their rifles sufficiently well to supply\nthe camp. Moreover, day by day little parties of the slaves disappeared,\nI presume to seek their own homes, so that when at last we entered the\nborders of the Mazitu country there were not more than fifty of them\nleft, including seventeen of those whom we had taught to shoot.\n\nThen it was that our real adventures began.\n\nOne evening, after three days' march through some difficult bush in\nwhich lions carried off a slave woman, killed one of the donkeys and\nmauled another so badly that it had to be shot, we found ourselves upon\nthe edge of a great grassy plateau that, according to my aneroid, was\n1,640 feet above sea level.\n\n\"What place is this?\" I asked of the two Mazitu guides, those same men\nwhom we had borrowed from Hassan.\n\n\"The land of our people, Chief,\" they answered, \"which is bordered on\none side by the bush and on the other by the great lake where live the\nPongo wizards.\"\n\nI looked about me at the bare uplands that already were beginning to\nturn brown, on which nothing was visible save vast herds of buck such as\nwere common further south. A dreary prospect it was, for a slight rain\nwas falling, accompanied by mist and a cold wind.\n\n\"I do not see your people or their kraals,\" I said; \"I only see grass\nand wild game.\"\n\n\"Our people will come,\" they replied, rather nervously. \"No doubt even\nnow their spies watch us from among the tall grass or out of some hole.\"\n\n\"The deuce they do,\" I said, or something like it, and thought no more\nof the matter. When one is in conditions in which anything _may_ happen,\nsuch as, so far as I am concerned, have prevailed through most of my\nlife, one grows a little careless as to what _will_ happen. For my part\nI have long been a fatalist, to a certain extent. I mean I believe that\nthe individual, or rather the identity which animates him, came out from\nthe Source of all life a long while, perhaps hundreds of thousands or\nmillions of years ago, and when his career is finished, perhaps hundreds\nof thousands or millions of years hence, or perhaps to-morrow, will\nreturn perfected, but still as an individual, to dwell in or with that\nSource of Life. I believe also that his various existences, here or\nelsewhere, are fore-known and fore-ordained, although in a sense he may\nshape them by the action of his free will, and that nothing which he can\ndo will lengthen or shorten one of them by a single hour. Therefore, so\nfar as I am concerned, I have always acted up to the great injunction of\nour Master and taken no thought for the morrow.\n\nHowever, in this instance, as in many others of my experience, the\nmorrow took plenty of thought for itself. Indeed, before the dawn, Hans,\nwho never seemed really to sleep any more than a dog does, woke me up\nwith the ominous information that he heard a sound which he thought was\ncaused by the tramp of hundreds of marching men.\n\n\"Where?\" I asked, after listening without avail--to look was useless,\nfor the night was dark as pitch.\n\nHe put his ear to the ground and said:\n\n\"There.\"\n\nI put _my_ ear to the ground, but although my senses are fairly acute,\ncould hear nothing.\n\nThen I sent for the sentries, but these, too, could hear nothing. After\nthis I gave the business up and went to sleep again.\n\nHowever, as it proved, Hans was quite right; in such matters he\ngenerally was right, for his senses were as keen as those of any wild\nbeast. At dawn I was once more awakened, this time by Mavovo, who\nreported that we were being surrounded by a regiment, or regiments. I\nrose and looked out through the mist. There, sure enough, in dim and\nsolemn outline, though still far off, I perceived rank upon rank of men,\narmed men, for the light glimmered faintly upon their spears.\n\n\"What is to be done, Macumazana?\" asked Mavovo.\n\n\"Have breakfast, I think,\" I answered. \"If we are going to be killed\nit may as well be after breakfast as before,\" and calling the trembling\nSammy, I instructed him to make the coffee. Also I awoke Stephen and\nexplained the situation to him.\n\n\"Capital!\" he answered. \"No doubt these are the Mazitu, and we have\nfound them much more easily than we expected. People generally take such\na lot of hunting for in this confounded great country.\"\n\n\"That's not such a bad way of looking at things,\" I answered, \"but would\nyou be good enough to go round the camp and make it clear that not on\nany account is anyone to fire without orders. Stay, collect all the guns\nfrom those slaves, for heaven knows what they will do with them if they\nare frightened!\"\n\nStephen nodded and sauntered off with three or four of the hunters.\nWhile he was gone, in consultation with Mavovo, I made certain little\narrangements of my own, which need not be detailed. They were designed\nto enable us to sell our lives as dearly as possible, should things come\nto the worst. One should always try to make an impression upon the enemy\nin Africa, for the sake of future travellers if for no other reason.\n\nIn due course Stephen and the hunters returned with the guns, or most of\nthem, and reported that the slave people were in great state of terror,\nand showed a disposition to bolt.\n\n\"Let them bolt,\" I answered. \"They would be of no use to us in a row\nand might even complicate matters. Call in the Zulus who are watching at\nonce.\"\n\nHe nodded, and a few minutes later I heard--for the mist which hung\nabout the bush to the east of the camp was still too dense to allow\nof my seeing anything--a clamour of voices, followed by the sound of\nscuttling feet. The slave people, including our bearers, had gone, every\none of them. They even carried away the wounded. Just as the soldiers\nwho surrounded us were completing their circle they bolted between the\ntwo ends of it and vanished into the bush out of which we had marched\non the previous evening. Often since then I have wondered what became\nof them. Doubtless some perished, and the rest worked their way back\nto their homes or found new ones among other tribes. The experiences of\nthose who escaped must be interesting to them if they still live. I can\nwell imagine the legends in which these will be embodied two or three\ngenerations hence.\n\nDeducting the slave people and the bearers whom we had wrung out of\nHassan, we were now a party of seventeen, namely eleven Zulu hunters\nincluding Mavovo, two white men, Hans and Sammy, and the two Mazitus\nwho had elected to remain with us, while round us was a great circle of\nsavages which closed in slowly.\n\nAs the light grew--it was long in coming on that dull morning--and\nthe mist lifted, I examined these people, without seeming to take any\nparticular notice of them. They were tall, much taller than the average\nZulu, and slighter in their build, also lighter in colour. Like the\nZulus they carried large hide shields and one very broad-bladed spear.\nThrowing assegais seemed to be wanting, but in place of them I saw\nthat they were armed with short bows, which, together with a quiver\nof arrows, were slung upon their backs. The officers wore a short\nskin cloak or kaross, and the men also had cloaks, which I found out\nafterwards were made from the inner bark of trees.\n\nThey advanced in the most perfect silence and very slowly. Nobody said\nanything, and if orders were given this must have been done by signs. I\ncould not see that any of them had firearms.\n\n\"Now,\" I said to Stephen, \"perhaps if we shot and killed some of those\nfellows, they might be frightened and run away. Or they might not; or if\nthey did they might return.\"\n\n\"Whatever happened,\" he remarked sagely, \"we should scarcely be welcome\nin their country afterwards, so I think we had better do nothing unless\nwe are obliged.\"\n\nI nodded, for it was obvious that we could not fight hundreds of\nmen, and told Sammy, who was perfectly livid with fear, to bring the\nbreakfast. No wonder he was afraid, poor fellow, for we were in great\ndanger. These Mazitu had a bad name, and if they chose to attack us we\nshould all be dead in a few minutes.\n\nThe coffee and some cold buck's flesh were put upon our little\ncamp-table in front of the tent which we had pitched because of the\nrain, and we began to eat. The Zulu hunters also ate from a bowl of\nmealie porridge which they had cooked on the previous night, each of\nthem with his loaded rifle upon his knees. Our proceedings appeared\nto puzzle the Mazitu very much indeed. They drew quite near to us, to\nwithin about forty yards, and halted there in a dead circle, staring at\nus with their great round eyes. It was like a scene in a dream; I shall\nnever forget it.\n\nEverything about us appeared to astonish them, our indifference, the\ncolour of Stephen and myself (as a matter of fact at that date Brother\nJohn was the only white man they had ever seen), our tent and our two\nremaining donkeys. Indeed, when one of these beasts broke into a bray,\nthey showed signs of fright, looking at each other and even retreating a\nfew paces.\n\nAt length the position got upon my nerves, especially as I saw that\nsome of them were beginning to fiddle with their bows, and that their\nGeneral, a tall, one-eyed old fellow, was making up his mind to do\nsomething. I called to one of the two Mazitus, whom I forgot to say we\nhad named Tom and Jerry, and gave him a pannikin of coffee.\n\n\"Take that to the captain there with my good wishes, Jerry, and ask him\nif he will drink with us,\" I said.\n\nJerry, who was a plucky fellow, obeyed. Advancing with the steaming\ncoffee, he held it under the Captain's nose. Evidently he knew the man's\nname, for I heard him say:\n\n\"O Babemba, the white lords, Macumazana and Wazela, ask if you will\nshare their holy drink with them?\"\n\nI could perfectly understand the words, for these people spoke a dialect\nso akin to Zulu that by now it had no difficulty for me.\n\n\"Their holy drink!\" exclaimed the old fellow, starting back. \"Man, it is\nhot red-water. Would these white wizards poison me with _mwavi_?\"\n\nHere I should explain that _mwavi_ or _mkasa_, as it is sometimes\ncalled, is the liquor distilled from the inner bark of a sort of\nmimosa tree or sometimes from a root of the strychnos tribe, which is\nadministered by the witch-doctors to persons accused of crime. If it\nmakes them sick they are declared innocent. If they are thrown into\nconvulsions or stupor they are clearly guilty and die, either from the\neffects of the poison or afterwards by other means.\n\n\"This is no _mwavi_, O Babemba,\" said Jerry. \"It is the divine liquor\nthat makes the white lords shoot straight with their wonderful guns\nwhich kill at a thousand paces. See, I will swallow some of it,\" and he\ndid, though it must have burnt his tongue.\n\nThus encouraged, old Babemba sniffed at the coffee and found it\nfragrant. Then he called a man, who from his peculiar dress I took to be\na doctor, made him drink some, and watched the results, which were that\nthe doctor tried to finish the pannikin. Snatching it away indignantly\nBabemba drank himself, and as I had half-filled the cup with sugar,\nfound the mixture good.\n\n\"It is indeed a holy drink,\" he said, smacking his lips. \"Have you any\nmore of it?\"\n\n\"The white lords have more,\" said Jerry. \"They invite you to eat with\nthem.\"\n\nBabemba stuck his finger into the tin, and covering it with the sediment\nof sugar, sucked and reflected.\n\n\"It's all right,\" I whispered to Stephen. \"I don't think he'll kill us\nafter drinking our coffee, and what's more, I believe he is coming to\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"This may be a snare,\" said Babemba, who now began to lick the sugar out\nof the pannikin.\n\n\"No,\" answered Jerry with creditable resource; \"though they could easily\nkill you all, the white lords do not hurt those who have partaken of\ntheir holy drink, that is unless anyone tries to harm them.\"\n\n\"Cannot you bring some more of the holy drink here?\" he asked, giving a\nfinal polish to the pannikin with his tongue.\n\n\"No,\" said Jerry, \"if you want it you must go there. Fear nothing. Would\nI, one of your own people, betray you?\"\n\n\"True!\" exclaimed Babemba. \"By your talk and your face you are a Mazitu.\nHow came you--well, we will speak of that afterwards. I am very thirsty.\nI will come. Soldiers, sit down and watch, and if any harm happens to\nme, avenge it and report to the king.\"\n\nNow, while all this was going on, I had made Hans and Sammy open one of\nthe boxes and extract therefrom a good-sized mirror in a wooden\nframe with a support at the back so that it could be stood anywhere.\nFortunately it was unbroken; indeed, our packing had been so careful\nthat none of the looking-glasses or other fragile things were injured.\nTo this mirror I gave a hasty polish, then set it upright upon the\ntable.\n\nOld Babemba came along rather suspiciously, his one eye rolling over us\nand everything that belonged to us. When he was quite close it fell\nupon the mirror. He stopped, he stared, he retreated, then drawn by his\novermastering curiosity, came on again and again stood still.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" called his second in command from the ranks.\n\n\"The matter is,\" he answered, \"that here is great magic. Here I see\nmyself walking towards myself. There can be no mistake, for one eye is\ngone in my other self.\"\n\n\"Advance, O Babemba,\" cried the doctor who had tried to drink all\nthe coffee, \"and see what happens. Keep your spear ready, and if your\nwitch-self attempts to harm you, kill it.\"\n\nThus encouraged, Babemba lifted his spear and dropped it again in a\ngreat hurry.\n\n\"That won't do, fool of a doctor,\" he shouted back. \"My other self lifts\na spear also, and what is more all of you who should be behind are in\nfront of me. The holy drink has made me drunk; I am bewitched. Save me!\"\n\nNow I saw that the joke had gone too far, for the soldiers were\nbeginning to string their bows in confusion. Luckily at this moment, the\nsun at length came out almost opposite to us.\n\n\"O Babemba,\" I said in a solemn voice, \"it is true that this magic\nshield, which we have brought as a gift to you, gives you another self.\nHenceforth your labours will be halved, and your pleasures doubled, for\nwhen you look into this shield you will be not one but two. Also it\nhas other properties--see,\" and lifting the mirror I used it as a\nheliograph, flashing the reflected sunlight into the eyes of the long\nhalf-circle of men in front of us. My word! didn't they run.\n\n\"Wonderful!\" exclaimed old Babemba, \"and can I learn to do that also,\nwhite lord?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I answered, \"come and try. Now, hold it so while I say\nthe spell,\" and I muttered some hocus-pocus, then directed it towards\ncertain of the Mazitu who were gathering again. \"There! Look! Look!\nYou have hit them in the eye. You are a master of magic. They run,\nthey run!\" and run they did indeed. \"Is there anyone yonder whom you\ndislike?\"\n\n\"Yes, plenty,\" answered Babemba with emphasis, \"especially that\nwitch-doctor who drank nearly all the holy drink.\"\n\n\"Very well; by-and-by I will show you how you can burn a hole in him\nwith this magic. No, not now, not now. For a while this mocker of the\nsun is dead. Look,\" and dipping the glass beneath the table I produced\nit back first. \"You cannot see anything, can you?\"\n\n\"Nothing except wood,\" replied Babemba, staring at the deal slip with\nwhich it was lined.\n\nThen I threw a dish-cloth over it and, to change the subject, offered\nhim another pannikin of the \"holy drink\" and a stool to sit on.\n\nThe old fellow perched himself very gingerly upon the stool, which was\nof the folding variety, stuck the iron-tipped end of his great spear in\nthe ground between his knees and took hold of the pannikin. Or rather\nhe took hold of a pannikin and not the right one. So ridiculous was his\nappearance that the light-minded Stephen, who, forgetting the perils\nof the situation, had for the last minute or two been struggling with\ninward laughter, clapped down his coffee on the table and retired into\nthe tent, where I heard him gurgling in unseemly merriment. It was this\ncoffee that in the confusion of the moment Sammy gave to old Babemba.\nPresently Stephen reappeared, and to cover his confusion seized the\npannikin meant for Babemba and drank it, or most of it. Then Sammy,\nseeing his mistake, said:\n\n\"Mr. Somers, I regret that there is an error. You are drinking from the\ncup which that stinking savage has just licked clean.\"\n\nThe effect was dreadful and instantaneous, for then and there Stephen\nwas violently sick.\n\n\"Why does the white lord do that?\" asked Babemba. \"Now I see that you\nare truly deceiving me, and that what you are giving me to swallow is\nnothing but hot _mwavi_, which in the innocent causes vomiting, but that\nin those who mean evil, death.\"\n\n\"Stop that foolery, you idiot,\" I muttered to Stephen, kicking him on\nthe shins, \"or you'll get our throats cut.\" Then, collecting myself with\nan effort, I said:\n\n\"Oh! not at all, General. This white lord is the priest of the holy\ndrink and--what you see is a religious rite.\"\n\n\"Is it so,\" said Babemba. \"Then I hope that the rite is not catching.\"\n\n\"Never,\" I replied, proffering him a biscuit. \"And now, General Babemba,\ntell me, why do you come against us with about five hundred armed men?\"\n\n\"To kill you, white lords--oh! how hot is this holy drink, yet pleasant.\nYou said that it was not catching, did you not? For I feel----\"\n\n\"Eat the cake,\" I answered. \"And why do you wish to kill us? Be so good\nas to tell me the truth now, or I shall read it in the magic shield\nwhich portrays the inside as well as the out,\" and lifting the cloth I\nstared at the glass.\n\n\"If you can read my thoughts, white lord, why trouble me to tell them?\"\nasked Babemba sensibly enough, his mouth full of biscuit. \"Still, as\nthat bright thing may lie, I will set them out. Bausi, king of our\npeople, has sent me to kill you, because news has reached him that you\nare great slave dealers who come hither with guns to capture the Mazitus\nand take them away to the Black Water to be sold and sent across it\nin big canoes that move of themselves. Of this he has been warned by\nmessengers from the Arab men. Moreover, we know that it is true, for\nlast night you had with you many slaves who, seeing our spears, ran away\nnot an hour ago.\"\n\nNow I stared hard at the looking-glass and answered coolly:\n\n\"This magic shield tells a somewhat different story. It says that your\nking, Bausi, for whom by the way we have many things as presents, told\nyou to lead us to him with honour, that we might talk over matters with\nhim.\"\n\nThe shot was a good one. Babemba grew confused.\n\n\"It is true,\" he stammered, \"that--I mean, the king left it to my\njudgment. I will consult the witch-doctor.\"\n\n\"If he left it to your judgment, the matter is settled,\" I said, \"since\ncertainly, being so great a noble, you would never try to murder those\nof whose holy drink you have just partaken. Indeed if you did so,\" I\nadded in a cold voice, \"you would not live long yourself. One secret\nword and that drink will turn to _mwavi_ of the worst sort inside of\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, white lord, it is settled,\" exclaimed Babemba, \"it is settled.\nDo not trouble the secret word. I will lead you to the king and you\nshall talk with him. By my head and my father's spirit you are safe from\nme. Still, with your leave, I will call the great doctor, Imbozwi,\nand ratify the agreement in his presence, and also show him the magic\nshield.\"\n\nSo Imbozwi was sent for, Jerry taking the message. Presently he arrived.\nHe was a villainous-looking person of uncertain age, humpbacked like\nthe picture of Punch, wizened and squint-eyed. His costume was of\nthe ordinary witch-doctor type being set off with snake skins, fish\nbladders, baboon's teeth and little bags of medicine. To add to his\ncharms a broad strip of pigment, red ochre probably, ran down his\nforehead and the nose beneath, across the lips and chin, ending in a red\nmark the size of a penny where the throat joins the chest. His woolly\nhair also, in which was twisted a small ring of black gum, was soaked\nwith grease and powdered blue. It was arranged in a kind of horn,\ncoming to a sharp point about five inches above the top of the skull.\nAltogether he looked extremely like the devil. What was more, he was a\ndevil in a bad temper, for the first words he said embodied a reproach\nto us for not having asked him to partake of our \"holy drink\" with\nBabemba.\n\nWe offered to make him some more, but he refused, saying that we should\npoison him.\n\nThen Babemba set the matter out, rather nervously I thought, for\nevidently he was afraid of this old wizard, who listened in complete\nsilence. When Babemba explained that without the king's direct order it\nwould be foolish and unjustifiable to put to death such magicians as\nwe were, Imbozwi spoke for the first time, asking why he called us\nmagicians.\n\nBabemba instanced the wonders of the shining shield that showed\npictures.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Imbozwi, \"does not calm water or polished iron show\npictures?\"\n\n\"But this shield will make fire,\" said Babemba. \"The white lords say it\ncan burn a man up.\"\n\n\"Then let it burn me up,\" replied Imbozwi with ineffable contempt, \"and\nI will believe that these white men are magicians worthy to be kept\nalive, and not common slave-traders such as we have often heard of.\"\n\n\"Burn him, white lords, and show him that I am right,\" exclaimed the\nexasperated Babemba, after which they fell to wrangling. Evidently they\nwere rivals, and by this time both of them had lost their tempers.\n\nThe sun was now very hot, quite sufficiently so to enable us to give\nMr. Imbozwi a taste of our magic, which I determined he should have.\nNot being certain whether an ordinary mirror would really reflect enough\nheat to scorch, I drew from my pocket a very powerful burning-glass\nwhich I sometimes used for the lighting of fires in order to save\nmatches, and holding the mirror in one hand and the burning-glass in\nthe other, I worked myself into a suitable position for the experiment.\nBabemba and the witch-doctor were arguing so fiercely that neither\nof them seemed to notice what I was doing. Getting the focus right,\nI directed the concentrated spark straight on to Imbozwi's greased\ntop-knot, where I knew he would feel nothing, my plan being to char\na hole in it. But as it happened this top-knot was built up round\nsomething of a highly inflammable nature, reed or camphor-wood, I\nexpect. At any rate, about thirty seconds later the top-knot was burning\nlike a beautiful torch.\n\n\"_Ow!_\" said the Kaffirs who were watching. \"My Aunt!\" exclaimed\nStephen. \"Look, look!\" shouted Babemba in tones of delight. \"Now will\nyou believe, O blown-out bladder of a man, that there are greater\nmagicians than yourself in the world?\"\n\n\"What is the matter, son of a dog, that you make a mock of me?\"\nscreeched the unfuriated Imbozwi, who alone was unaware of anything\nunusual.\n\nAs he spoke some suspicion rose in his mind which caused him to put his\nhand to his top-knot, and withdraw it with a howl. Then he sprang up and\nbegan to dance about, which of course only fanned the fire that had now\ngot hold of the grease and gum. The Zulus applauded; Babemba clapped his\nhands; Stephen burst into one of his idiotic fits of laughter. For my\npart I grew frightened. Near at hand stood a large wooden pot such as\nthe Kaffirs make, from which the coffee kettle had been filled, that\nfortunately was still half-full of water. I seized it and ran to him.\n\n\"Save me, white lord!\" he howled. \"You are the greatest of magicians and\nI am your slave.\"\n\nHere I cut him short by clapping the pot bottom upwards on his burning\nhead, into which it vanished as a candle does into an extinguisher.\nSmoke and a bad smell issued from beneath the pot, the water from which\nran all over Imbozwi, who stood quite still. When I was sure the fire\nwas out, I lifted the pot and revealed the discomfited wizard, but\nwithout his elaborate head-dress. Beyond a little scorching he was not\nin the least hurt, for I had acted in time; only he was bald, for when\ntouched the charred hair fell off at the roots.\n\n\"It is gone,\" he said in an amazed voice after feeling at his scalp.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"quite. The magic shield worked very well, did it\nnot?\"\n\n\"Can you put it back again, white lord?\" he asked.\n\n\"That will depend upon how you behave,\" I replied.\n\nThen without another word he turned and walked back to the soldiers,\nwho received him with shouts of laughter. Evidently Imbozwi was not a\npopular character, and his discomfiture delighted them.\n\nBabemba also was delighted. Indeed, he could not praise our magic\nenough, and at once began to make arrangements to escort us to the king\nat his head town, which was called Beza, vowing that we need fear no\nharm at his hands or those of his soldiers. In fact, the only person who\ndid not appreciate our black arts was Imbozwi himself. I caught a look\nin his eye as he marched off which told me that he hated us bitterly,\nand reflected to myself that perhaps I had been foolish to use that\nburning-glass, although in truth I had not intended to set his head on\nfire.\n\n\"My father,\" said Mavovo to me afterwards, \"it would have been better to\nlet that snake burn to death, for then you would have killed his poison.\nI am something of a doctor myself, and I tell you there is nothing our\nbrotherhood hates so much as being laughed at. You have made a fool of\nhim before all his people and he will not forget it, Macumazana.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n                            BAUSI THE KING\n\nAbout midday we made a start for Beza Town where King Bausi lived, which\nwe understood we ought to reach on the following evening. For some hours\nthe regiment marched in front, or rather round us, but as we complained\nto Babemba of the noise and dust, with a confidence that was quite\ntouching, he sent it on ahead. First, however, he asked us to pass our\nword \"by our mothers,\" which was the most sacred of oaths among many\nAfrican peoples, that we would not attempt to escape. I confess that I\nhesitated before giving an answer, not being entirely enamoured of the\nMazitu and of our prospects among them, especially as I had discovered\nthrough Jerry that the discomfited Imbozwi had departed from the\nsoldiers on some business of his own. Had the matter been left to me,\nindeed, I should have tried to slip back into the bush over the border,\nand there put in a few months shooting during the dry season, while\nworking my way southwards. This, too, was the wish of the Zulu hunters,\nof Hans, and I need not add of Sammy. But when I mentioned the matter to\nStephen, he implored me to abandon the idea.\n\n\"Look here, Quatermain,\" he said, \"I have come to this God-forsaken\ncountry to get that great Cypripedium, and get it I will or die in the\nattempt. Still,\" he added after surveying our rather blank faces, \"I\nhave no right to play with your lives, so if you think the thing\ntoo dangerous I will go on alone with this old boy, Babemba. Putting\neverything else aside, I think that one of us ought to visit Bausi's\nkraal in case the gentleman who you call Brother John should turn up\nthere. In short, I have made up my mind, so it is no use talking.\"\n\nI lit my pipe, and for quite a time contemplated this obstinate young\nman while considering the matter from every point of view. Finally, I\ncame to the conclusion that he was right and I was wrong. It was true\nthat by bribing Babemba, or otherwise, there was still an excellent\nprospect of effecting a masterly retreat and of avoiding many perils. On\nthe other hand, we had not come to this wild place in order to retreat.\nFurther, at whose expense had we come here? At that of Stephen Somers\nwho wished to proceed. Lastly, to say nothing of the chance of meeting\nBrother John, to whom I felt no obligation since he had given us the\nslip at Durban, I did not like the idea of being beaten. We had started\nout to visit some mysterious savages who worshipped a monkey and a\nflower, and we might as well go on till circumstances were too much for\nus. After all, dangers are everywhere; those who turn back because of\ndangers will never succeed in any life that we can imagine.\n\n\"Mavovo,\" I said presently, pointing to Stephen with my pipe, \"the\n_inkoosi_ Wazela does not wish to try to escape. He wishes to go on\nto the country of the Pongo people if we can get there. And, Mavovo,\nremember that he has paid for everything; we are his hired servants.\nAlso that he says that if we run back he will walk forward alone with\nthese Mazitus. Still, if any of you hunters desire to slip off, he will\nnot look your way, nor shall I. What say you?\"\n\n\"I say, Macumazana, that, though young, Wazela is a chief with a great\nheart, and that where you and he go, I shall go also, as I think will\nthe rest of us. I do not like these Mazitu, for if their fathers were\nZulus their mothers were low people. They are bastards, and of the Pongo\nI hear nothing but what is evil. Still, no good ox ever turns in the\nyoke because of a mud-hole. Let us go on, for if we sink in the swamp\nwhat does it matter? Moreover, my Snake tells me that we shall not sink,\nat least not all of us.\"\n\nSo it was arranged that no effort should be made to return. Sammy, it is\ntrue, wished to do so, but when it came to the point and he was offered\none of the remaining donkeys and as much food and ammunition as he could\ncarry, he changed his mind.\n\n\"I think it better, Mr. Quatermain,\" he said, \"to meet my end in the\ncompany of high-born, lofty souls than to pursue a lonely career towards\nthe inevitable in unknown circumstances.\"\n\n\"Very well put, Sammy,\" I answered; \"so while waiting for the\ninevitable, please go and cook the dinner.\"\n\nHaving laid aside our doubts, we proceeded on the journey comfortably\nenough, being well provided with bearers to take the place of those who\nhad run away. Babemba, accompanied by a single orderly, travelled with\nus, and from him we collected much information. It seemed that the\nMazitu were a large people who could muster from five to seven thousand\nspears. Their tradition was that they came from the south and were of\nthe same stock as the Zulus, of whom they had heard vaguely. Indeed,\nmany of their customs, to say nothing of their language, resembled\nthose of that country. Their military organisation, however, was not\nso thorough, and in other ways they struck me as a lower race. In one\nparticular, it is true, that of their houses, they were more advanced,\nfor these, as we saw in the many kraals that we passed, were better\nbuilt, with doorways through which one could walk upright, instead of\nthe Kaffir bee-holes.\n\nWe slept in one of these houses on our march, and should have found\nit very comfortable had it not been for the innumerable fleas which at\nlength drove us out into the courtyard. For the rest, these Mazitu much\nresembled the Zulus. They had kraals and were breeders of cattle; they\nwere ruled by headmen under the command of a supreme chief or king; they\nbelieved in witchcraft and offered sacrifice to the spirits of their\nancestors, also in some kind of a vague and mighty god who dominated the\naffairs of the world and declared his will through the doctors. Lastly,\nthey were, and I dare say still are, a race of fighting men who loved\nwar and raided the neighbouring peoples upon any and every pretext,\nkilling their men and stealing their women and cattle. They had their\nvirtues, too, being kindly and hospitable by nature, though cruel enough\nto their enemies. Moreover, they detested dealing in slaves and those\nwho practised it, saying that it was better to kill a man than to\ndeprive him of his freedom. Also they had a horror of the cannibalism\nwhich is so common in the dark regions of Africa, and for this reason,\nmore than any other, loathed the Pongo folk who were supposed to be\neaters of men.\n\nOn the evening of the second day of our march, during which we had\npassed through a beautiful and fertile upland country, very well\nwatered, and except in the valleys, free from bush, we arrived at Beza.\nThis town was situated on a wide plain surrounded by low hills and\nencircled by a belt of cultivated land made beautiful by the crops\nof maize and other cereals which were then ripe to harvest. It was\nfortified in a way. That is, a tall, unclimbable palisade of timber\nsurrounded the entire town, which fence was strengthened by prickly\npears and cacti planted on its either side.\n\nWithin this palisade the town was divided into quarters more or\nless devoted to various trades. Thus one part of it was called the\nIronsmiths' Quarter; another the Soldiers' Quarter; another the Quarter\nof the Land-tillers; another that of the Skin-dressers, and so on. The\nking's dwelling and those of his women and dependents were near the\nNorth gate, and in front of these, surrounded by semi-circles of huts,\nwas a wide space into which cattle could be driven if necessary. This,\nhowever, at the time of our visit, was used as a market and a drilling\nground.\n\nWe entered the town, that must in all have contained a great number of\ninhabitants, by the South gate, a strong log structure facing a wooded\nslope through which ran a road. Just as the sun was setting we marched\nto the guest-huts up a central street lined with the population of the\nplace who had gathered to stare at us. These huts were situated in the\nSoldiers' Quarter, not far from the king's house and surrounded by an\ninner fence to keep them private.\n\nNone of the people spoke as we passed them, for the Mazitu are polite by\nnature; also it seemed to me that they regarded us with awe tempered\nby curiosity. They only stared, and occasionally those of them who were\nsoldiers saluted us by lifting their spears. The huts into which we were\nintroduced by Babemba, with whom we had grown very friendly, were good\nand clean.\n\nHere all our belongings, including the guns which we had collected just\nbefore the slaves ran away, were placed in one of the huts over which\na Mazitu mounted guard, the donkeys being tied to the fence at a little\ndistance. Outside this fence stood another armed Mazitu, also on guard.\n\n\"Are we prisoners here?\" I asked of Babemba.\n\n\"The king watches over his guests,\" he answered enigmatically. \"Have\nthe white lords any message for the king whom I am summoned to see this\nnight?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered. \"Tell the king that we are the brethren of him who\nmore than a year ago cut a swelling from his body, whom we have arranged\nto meet here. I mean the white lord with a long beard who among you\nblack people is called Dogeetah.\"\n\nBabemba started. \"You are the brethren of Dogeetah! How comes it then\nthat you never mentioned his name before, and when is he going to meet\nyou here? Know that Dogeetah is a great man among us, for with him alone\nof all men the king has made blood-brotherhood. As the king is, so is\nDogeetah among the Mazitu.\"\n\n\"We never mentioned him because we do not talk about everything at once,\nBabemba. As to when Dogeetah will meet us I am not sure; I am only sure\nthat he is coming.\"\n\n\"Yes, lord Macumazana, but when, when? That is what the king will want\nto know and that is what you must tell him. Lord,\" he added, dropping\nhis voice, \"you are in danger here where you have many enemies, since it\nis not lawful for white men to enter this land. If you would save your\nlives, be advised by me and be ready to tell the king to-morrow when\nDogeetah, whom he loves, will appear here to vouch for you, and see that\nhe does appear very soon and by the day you name. Since otherwise when\nhe comes, if come he does, he may not find you able to talk to him. Now\nI, your friend, have spoken and the rest is with you.\"\n\nThen without another word he rose, slipped through the door of the hut\nand out by the gateway of the fence from which the sentry moved aside\nto let him pass. I, too, rose from the stool on which I sat and danced\nabout the hut in a perfect fury.\n\n\"Do you understand what that infernal (I am afraid I used a stronger\nword) old fool told me?\" I exclaimed to Stephen. \"He says that we must\nbe prepared to state exactly when that other infernal old fool, Brother\nJohn, will turn up at Beza Town, and that if we don't we shall have our\nthroats cut as indeed has already been arranged.\"\n\n\"Rather awkward,\" replied Stephen. \"There are no express trains to Beza,\nand if there were we couldn't be sure that Brother John would take one\nof them. I suppose there _is_ a Brother John?\" he added reflectively.\n\"To me he seems to be--intimately connected with Mrs. Harris.\"\n\n\"Oh! there is, or there was,\" I explained. \"Why couldn't the confounded\nass wait quietly for us at Durban instead of fooling off butterfly\nhunting to the north of Zululand and breaking his leg or his neck there\nif he has done anything of the sort?\"\n\n\"Don't know, I am sure. It's hard enough to understand one's own\nmotives, let alone Brother John's.\"\n\nThen we sat down on our stools again and stared at each other. At this\nmoment Hans crept into the hut and squatted down in front of us. He\nmight have walked in as there was a doorway, but he preferred to creep\non his hands and knees, I don't know why.\n\n\"What is it, you ugly little toad?\" I asked viciously, for that was just\nwhat he looked like; even the skin under his jaw moved like a toad's.\n\n\"The Baas is in trouble?\" remarked Hans.\n\n\"I should think he was,\" I answered, \"and so will you be presently when\nyou are wriggling on the point of a Mazitu spear.\"\n\n\"They are broad spears that would make a big hole,\" remarked Hans\nagain, whereupon I rose to kick him out, for his ideas were, as usual,\nunpleasant.\n\n\"Baas,\" he went on, \"I have been listening--there is a very good hole in\nthis hut for listening if one lies against the wall and pretends to\nbe asleep. I have heard all and understood most of your talk with that\none-eyed savage and the Baas Stephen.\"\n\n\"Well, you little sneak, what of it?\"\n\n\"Only, Baas, that if we do not want to be killed in this place from\nwhich there is no escape, it is necessary that you should find out\nexactly on what day and at what hour Dogeetah is going to arrive.\"\n\n\"Look here, you yellow idiot,\" I exclaimed, \"if you are beginning\nthat game too, I'll----\" then I stopped, reflecting that my temper was\ngetting the better of me and that I had better hear what Hans had to say\nbefore I vented it on him.\n\n\"Baas, Mavovo is a great doctor; it is said that his Snake is the\nstraightest and the strongest in all Zululand save that of his master,\nZikali, the old slave. He told you that Dogeetah was laid up somewhere\nwith a hurt leg and that he was coming to meet you here; no doubt\ntherefore he can tell you also _when_ he is coming. I would ask him, but\nhe won't set his Snake to work for me. So you must ask him, Baas, and\nperhaps he will forget that you laughed at his magic and that he swore\nyou would never see it again.\"\n\n\"Oh! blind one,\" I answered, \"how do I know that Mavovo's story about\nDogeetah was not all nonsense?\"\n\nHans stared at me amazed.\n\n\"Mavovo's story nonsense! Mavovo's Snake a liar! Oh! Baas, that is what\ncomes of being too much a Christian. Now, thanks to your father the\nPredikant, I am a Christian too, but not so much that I have forgotten\nhow to know good magic from bad. Mavovo's Snake a liar, and after he\nwhom we buried yonder was the first of the hunters whom the feathers\nnamed to him at Durban!\" and he began to chuckle in intense amusement,\nthen added, \"Well, Baas, there it is. You must either ask Mavovo, and\nvery nicely, or we shall all be killed. _I_ don't mind much, for I\nshould rather like to begin again a little younger somewhere else, but\njust think what a noise Sammy will make!\" and turning he crept out as he\nhad crept in.\n\n\"Here's a nice position,\" I groaned to Stephen when he had gone. \"I,\na white man, who, in spite of some coincidences with which I am\nacquainted, know that all this Kaffir magic is bosh am to beg a savage\nto tell me something of which he _must_ be ignorant. That is, unless we\neducated people have got hold of the wrong end of the stick altogether.\nIt is humiliating; it isn't Christian, and I'm hanged if I'll do it!\"\n\n\"I dare say you will be--hanged I mean--whether you do it or whether you\ndon't,\" replied Stephen with his sweet smile. \"But I say, old fellow,\nhow do you know it is all bosh? We are told about lots of miracles which\nweren't bosh, and if miracles ever existed, why can't they exist now?\nBut there, I know what you mean and it is no use arguing. Still, if\nyou're proud, I ain't. I'll try to soften the stony heart of Mavovo--we\nare rather pals, you know--and get him to unroll the book of his occult\nwisdom,\" and he went.\n\nA few minutes later I was called out to receive a sheep which, with\nmilk, native beer, some corn, and other things, including green forage\nfor the donkeys, Bausi had sent for us to eat. Here I may remark that\nwhile we were among the Mazitu we lived like fighting cocks. There was\nnone of that starvation which is, or was, so common in East Africa where\nthe traveller often cannot get food for love or money--generally because\nthere is none.\n\nWhen this business was settled by my sending a message of thanks to the\nking with an intimation that we hoped to wait upon him on the morrow\nwith a few presents, I went to seek Sammy in order to tell him to kill\nand cook the sheep. After some search I found, or rather heard him\nbeyond a reed fence which divided two of the huts. He was acting as\ninterpreter between Stephen Somers and Mavovo.\n\n\"This Zulu man declares, Mr. Somers,\" he said, \"that he quite\nunderstands everything you have been explaining, and that it is probable\nthat we shall all be butchered by this savage Bausi, if we cannot tell\nhim when the white man, Dogeetah, whom he loves, will arrive here. He\nsays also that he thinks that by his magic he could learn when this will\nhappen--if it is to happen at all--(which of course, Mr. Somers, for\nyour private information only, is a mighty lie of the ignorant heathen).\nHe adds, however, that he does not care one brass farthing--his actual\nexpression, Mr. Somers, is 'one grain of corn on a mealie-cob'--about\nhis or anybody else's life, which from all I have heard of his\nproceedings I can well believe to be true. He says in his vulgar\nlanguage that there is no difference between the belly of a Mazitu-land\nhyena and that of any other hyena, and that the earth of Mazitu-land\nis as welcome to his bones as any other earth, since the earth is the\nwickedest of all hyenas, in that he has observed that soon or late it\ndevours everlastingly everything which once it bore. You must forgive me\nfor reproducing his empty and childish talk, Mr. Somers, but you bade me\nto render the words of this savage with exactitude. In fact, Mr. Somers,\nthis reckless person intimates, in short that some power with which he\nis not acquainted--he calls it the 'Strength that makes the Sun to\nshine and broiders the blanket of the night with stars' (forgive me for\nrepeating his silly words), caused him 'to be born into this world, and,\nat an hour already appointed, will draw him from this world back into\nits dark, eternal bosom, there to be rocked in sleep, or nursed to life\nagain, according to its unknown will'--I translate exactly, Mr. Somers,\nalthough I do not know what it all means--and that he does not care a\ncurse when this happens. Still, he says that whereas he is growing old\nand has known many sorrows--he alludes here, I gather, to some nigger\nwives of his whom another savage knocked on the head; also to a child to\nwhom he appears to have been attached--you are young with all your days\nand, he hopes, joys, before you. Therefore he would gladly do anything\nin his power to save your life, because although you are white and he\nis black he has conceived an affection for you and looks on you as his\nchild. Yes, Mr. Somers, although I blush to repeat it, this black\nfellow says he looks upon you as his child. He adds, indeed, that if the\nopportunity arises, he will gladly give his life to save your life,\nand that it cuts his heart in two to refuse you anything. Still he must\nrefuse this request of yours, that he will ask the creature he calls his\nSnake--what he means by that, I don't know, Mr. Somers--to declare\nwhen the white man, named Dogeetah, will arrive in this place. For this\nreason, that he told Mr. Quatermain when he laughed at him about his\ndivinations that he would make no more magic for him or any of you, and\nthat he will die rather than break his word. That's all, Mr. Somers, and\nI dare say you will think--quite enough, too.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" replied Stephen. \"Tell the chief, Mavovo\" (I observed he\nlaid an emphasis on the word, _chief_) \"that I _quite_ understand, and\nthat I thank him very much for explaining things to me so fully. Then\nask him whether, as the matter is so important, there is no way out of\nthis trouble?\"\n\nSammy translated into Zulu, which he spoke perfectly, as I noted without\ninterpolations or additions.\n\n\"Only one way,\" answered Mavovo in the intervals of taking snuff. \"It is\nthat Macumazana himself shall ask me to do this thing, Macumazana is my\nold chief and friend, and for his sake I will forget what in the case\nof others I should always remember. If he will come and ask me, without\nmockery, to exercise my skill on behalf of all of us, I will try to\nexercise it, although I know very well that he believes it to be but as\nan idle little whirlwind that stirs the dust, that raises the dust and\nlets it fall again without purpose or meaning, forgetting, as the wise\nwhite men forget, that even the wind which blows the dust is the same\nthat breathes in our nostrils, and that to it, we also are as is the\ndust.\"\n\nNow I, the listener, thought for a moment or two. The words of this\nfighting savage, Mavovo, even those of them of which I had heard only\nthe translation, garbled and beslavered by the mean comments of the\nunutterable Sammy, stirred my imagination. Who was I that I should dare\nto judge of him and his wild, unknown gifts? Who was I that I should\nmock at him and by my mockery intimate that I believed him to be a\nfraud?\n\nStepping through the gateway of the fence, I confronted him.\n\n\"Mavovo,\" I said, \"I have overheard your talk. I am sorry if I laughed\nat you in Durban. I do not understand what you call your magic. It is\nbeyond me and may be true or may be false. Still, I shall be grateful to\nyou if you will use your power to discover, if you can, whether Dogeetah\nis coming here, and if so, when. Now, do as it may please you; I have\nspoken.\"\n\n\"And I have heard, Macumazana, my father. To-night I will call upon my\nSnake. Whether it will answer or what it will answer, I cannot say.\"\n\nWell, he did call upon his Snake with due and portentous ceremony and,\naccording to Stephen, who was present, which I declined to be, that\nmystic reptile declared that Dogeetah, alias Brother John, would arrive\nin Beza Town precisely at sunset on the third day from that night. Now\nas he had divined on Friday, according to our almanac, this meant that\nwe might hope to see him--hope exactly described my state of mind on the\nmatter--on the Monday evening in time for supper.\n\n\"All right,\" I said briefly. \"Please do not talk to me any more about\nthis impious rubbish, for I want to go to sleep.\"\n\nNext morning early we unpacked our boxes and made a handsome selection\nof gifts for the king, Bausi, hoping thus to soften his royal heart.\nIt included a bale of calico, several knives, a musical box, a cheap\nAmerican revolver, and a bundle of tooth-picks; also several pounds\nof the best and most fashionable beads for his wives. This truly noble\npresent we sent to the king by our two Mazitu servants, Tom and Jerry,\nwho were marched off in the charge of several sentries, for I hoped\nthat these men would talk to their compatriots and tell them what good\nfellows we were. Indeed I instructed them to do so.\n\nImagine our horror, therefore, when about an hour later, just as we were\ntidying ourselves up after breakfast, there appeared through the gate,\nnot Tom and Jerry, for they had vanished, but a long line of Mazitu\nsoldiers each of whom carried one of the articles that we had sent.\nIndeed the last of them held the bundle of toothpicks on his fuzzy head\nas though it were a huge faggot of wood. One by one they set them down\nupon the lime flooring of the verandah of the largest hut. Then their\ncaptain said solemnly:\n\n\"Bausi, the Great Black One, has no need of the white men's gifts.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I replied, for my dander was up. \"Then he won't get another\nchance at them.\"\n\nThe men turned away without more words, and presently Babemba turned up\nwith a company of about fifty soldiers.\n\n\"The king is waiting to see you, white lords,\" he said in a voice of\nvery forced jollity, \"and I have come to conduct you to him.\"\n\n\"Why would he not accept our presents?\" I asked, pointing to the row of\nthem.\n\n\"Oh! that is because of Imbozwi's story of the magic shield. He said he\nwanted no gifts to burn his hair off. But, come, come. He will explain\nfor himself. If the Elephant is kept waiting he grows angry and\ntrumpets.\"\n\n\"Does he?\" I said. \"And how many of us are to come?\"\n\n\"All, all, white lord. He wishes to see every one of you.\"\n\n\"Not me, I suppose?\" said Sammy, who was standing close by. \"I must stop\nto make ready the food.\"\n\n\"Yes, you too,\" replied Babemba. \"The king would look on the mixer of\nthe holy drink.\"\n\nWell, there was no way out of it, so off we marched, all well armed as I\nneed not say, and were instantly surrounded by the soldiers. To give an\nunusual note to the proceedings I made Hans walk first, carrying on his\nhead the rejected musical box from which flowed the touching melody of\n\"Home, Sweet Home.\" Then came Stephen bearing the Union Jack on a pole,\nthen I in the midst of the hunters and accompanied by Babemba, then the\nreluctant Sammy, and last of all the two donkeys led by Mazitus, for it\nseemed that the king had especially ordered that these should be brought\nalso.\n\nIt was a truly striking cavalcade, the sight of which under any other\ncircumstances would have made me laugh. Nor did it fail in its effect,\nfor even the silent Mazitu people through whom we wended our way, were\nmoved to something like enthusiasm. \"Home, Sweet Home\" they evidently\nthought heavenly, though perhaps the two donkeys attracted them most,\nespecially when these brayed.\n\n\"Where are Tom and Jerry?\" I asked of Babemba.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered; \"I think they have been given leave to go\nto see their friends.\"\n\nImbozwi is suppressing evidence in our favour, I thought to myself, and\nsaid no more.\n\nPresently we reached the gate of the royal enclosure. Here to my dismay\nthe soldiers insisted on disarming us, taking away our rifles, our\nrevolvers, and even our sheath knives. In vain did I remonstrate, saying\nthat we were not accustomed to part with these weapons. The answer was\nthat it was not lawful for any man to appear before the king armed even\nwith so much as a dancing-stick. Mavovo and the Zulus showed signs of\nresisting and for a minute I thought there was going to be a row, which\nof course would have ended in our massacre, for although the Mazitus\nfeared guns very much, what could we have done against hundreds of\nthem? I ordered him to give way, but for once he was on the point of\ndisobeying me. Then by a happy thought I reminded him that, according to\nhis Snake, Dogeetah was coming, and that therefore all would be well. So\nhe submitted with an ill grace, and we saw our precious guns borne off\nwe knew not where.\n\nThen the Mazitu soldiers piled their spears and bows at the gate of the\nkraal and we proceeded with only the Union Jack and the musical box,\nwhich was now discoursing \"Britannia rules the waves.\"\n\nAcross the open space we marched to where several broad-leaved trees\ngrew in front of a large native house. Not far from the door of this\nhouse a fat, middle-aged and angry-looking man was seated on a stool,\nnaked except for a moocha of catskins about his loins and a string of\nlarge blue beads round his neck.\n\n\"Bausi, the King,\" whispered Babemba.\n\nAt his side squatted a little hunchbacked figure, in whom I had no\ndifficulty in recognising Imbozwi, although he had painted his scorched\nscalp white with vermillion spots and adorned his snub nose with a\npurple tip, his dress of ceremony I presume. Round and behind there were\na number of silent councillors. At some signal or on reaching a given\nspot, all the soldiers, including old Babemba, fell upon their hands and\nknees and began to crawl. They wanted us to do the same, but here I drew\nthe line, feeling that if once we crawled we must always crawl.\n\nSo at my word we advanced upright, but with slow steps, in the midst of\nall this wriggling humanity and at length found ourselves in the august\npresence of Bausi, \"the Beautiful Black One,\" King of the Mazitu.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n                             THE SENTENCE\n\nWe stared at Bausi and Bausi stared at us.\n\n\"I am the Black Elephant Bausi,\" he exclaimed at last, worn out by our\nsolid silence, \"and I trumpet! I trumpet! I trumpet!\" (It appeared that\nthis was the ancient and hallowed formula with which a Mazitu king was\nwont to open a conversation with strangers.)\n\nAfter a suitable pause I replied in a cold voice:\n\n\"We are the white lions, Macumazana and Wazela, and we roar! we roar! we\nroar!\"\n\n\"I can trample,\" said Bausi.\n\n\"And we can bite,\" I said haughtily, though how we were to bite or do\nanything else effectual with nothing but a Union Jack, I did not in the\nleast know.\n\n\"What is that thing?\" asked Bausi, pointing to the flag.\n\n\"That which shadows the whole earth,\" I answered proudly, a remark that\nseemed to impress him, although he did not at all understand it, for he\nordered a soldier to hold a palm leaf umbrella over him to prevent it\nfrom shadowing _him_.\n\n\"And that,\" he asked again, pointing to the music box, \"which is not\nalive and yet makes a noise?\"\n\n\"That sings the war-song of our people,\" I said. \"We sent it to you as a\npresent and you returned it. Why do you return our presents, O Bausi?\"\n\nThen of a sudden this potentate grew furious.\n\n\"Why do you come here, white men,\" he asked, \"uninvited and against\nthe law of my land, where only one white man is welcome, my brother\nDogeetah, who cured me of sickness with a knife? I know who you are. You\nare dealers in men. You come here to steal my people and sell them into\nslavery. You had many slaves with you on the borders of my country,\nbut you sent them away. You shall die, you shall die, you who call\nyourselves lions, and the painted rag which you say shadows the world,\nshall rot with your bones. As for that box which sings a war-song, I\nwill smash it; it shall not bewitch me as your magic shield bewitched my\ngreat doctor, Imbozwi, burning off his hair.\"\n\nThen springing up with wonderful agility for one so fat, he knocked the\nmusical box from Hans' head, so that it fell to the ground and after a\nlittle whirring grew silent.\n\n\"That is right,\" squeaked Imbozwi. \"Trample on their magic, O Elephant.\nKill them, O Black One; burn them as they burned my hair.\"\n\nNow things were, I felt, very serious, for already Bausi was looking\nabout him as though to order his soldiers to make an end of us. So I\nsaid in desperation:\n\n\"O King, you mentioned a certain white man, Dogeetah, a doctor of\ndoctors, who cured you of sickness with a knife, and called him your\nbrother. Well, he is our brother also, and it was by his invitation that\nwe have come to visit you here, where he will meet us presently.\"\n\n\"If Dogeetah is your friend, then you are my friends,\" answered Bausi,\n\"for in this land he rules as I rule, he whose blood flows in my veins,\nas my blood flows in his veins. But you lie. Dogeetah is no brother of\nslave-dealers, his heart is good and yours are evil. You say that he\nwill meet you here. When will he meet you? Tell me, and if it is soon, I\nwill hold my hand and wait to hear his report of you before I put you to\ndeath, for if he speaks well of you, you shall not die.\"\n\nNow I hesitated, as well I might, for I felt that looking at our case\nfrom his point of view, Bausi, believing us to be slave-traders, was\nnot angry without cause. While I was racking my brains for a reply that\nmight be acceptable to him and would not commit us too deeply, to my\nastonishment Mavovo stepped forward and confronted the king.\n\n\"Who are you, fellow?\" shouted Bausi.\n\n\"I am a warrior, O King, as my scars show,\" and he pointed to the\nassegai wounds upon his breast and to his cut nostril. \"I am a chief of\na people from whom your people sprang and my name is Mavovo, Mavovo who\nis ready to fight you or any man whom you may name, and to kill him or\nyou if you will. Is there one here who wishes to be killed?\"\n\nNo one answered, for the mighty-chested Zulu looked very formidable.\n\n\"I am a doctor also,\" went on Mavovo, \"one of the greatest of doctors\nwho can open the 'Gates of Distance' and read that which is hid in the\nwomb of the Future. Therefore I will answer your questions which you\nput to the lord Macumazana, the great and wise white man whom I serve,\nbecause we have fought together in many battles. Yes, I will be his\nMouth, I will answer. The white man Dogeetah, who is your blood-brother\nand whose word is your word among the Mazitu, will arrive here at sunset\non the second day from now. I have spoken.\"\n\nBausi looked at me in question.\n\n\"Yes,\" I exclaimed, feeling that I must say something and that it did\nnot much matter what I said, \"Dogeetah will arrive here on the second\nday from now within half an hour after sunset.\"\n\nSomething, I know not what, prompted me to allow that extra half-hour,\nwhich in the event, saved all our lives. Now Bausi consulted a while\nwith the execrable Imbozwi and also with the old one-eyed General\nBabemba while we watched, knowing that our fate hung upon the issue.\n\nAt length he spoke.\n\n\"White men,\" he said, \"Imbozwi, the head of the witch-finders here,\nwhose hair you burnt off by your evil magic, says that it would be\nbetter to kill you at once as your hearts are bad and you are planning\nmischief against my people. So I think also. But Babemba my General,\nwith whom I am angry because he did not obey my orders and put you\nto death on the borders of my country when he met you there with your\ncaravan of slaves, thinks otherwise. He prays me to hold my hand, first\nbecause you have bewitched him into liking you and secondly because if\nyou should happen to be speaking the truth--which we do not believe--and\nto have come here at the invitation of my brother Dogeetah, he,\nDogeetah, would be pained if he arrived and found you dead, nor could\neven he bring you to life again. This being so, since it matters little\nwhether you die now or later, my command is that you be kept prisoners\ntill sunset of the second day from this, and that then you will be\nled out and tied to stakes in the market-place, there to wait till\nthe approach of darkness, by when you say Dogeetah will be here. If\nhe arrives and owns you as his brethren, well and good; if he does not\narrive, or disowns you--better still, for then you shall be shot to\ndeath with arrows as a warning to all other stealers of men not to cross\nthe borders of the Mazitu.\"\n\nI listened to this atrocious sentence with horror, then gasped out:\n\n\"We are not stealers of men, O King, we are freers of men, as Tom and\nJerry of your own people could tell you.\"\n\n\"Who are Tom and Jerry?\" he asked, indifferently. \"Well, it does not\nmatter, for doubtless they are liars like the rest of you. I have\nspoken. Take them away, feed them well and keep them safe till within an\nhour of sunset on the second day from this.\"\n\nThen, without giving us any further opportunity of speaking, Bausi rose,\nand followed by Imbozwi and his councillors, marched off into his big\nhut. We too, were marched off, this time under a double guard commanded\nby someone whom I had not seen before. At the gate of the kraal we\nhalted and asked for the arms that had been taken from us. No answer was\ngiven; only the soldiers put their hands upon our shoulders and thrust\nus along.\n\n\"This is a nice business,\" I whispered to Stephen.\n\n\"Oh! it doesn't matter,\" he answered. \"There are lots more guns in the\nhuts. I am told that these Mazitus are dreadfully afraid of bullets. So\nall we have to do is just to break out and shoot our way through them,\nfor of course they will run when we begin to fire.\"\n\nI looked at him but did not answer, for to tell the truth I felt in no\nmood for argument.\n\nPresently we arrived at our quarters, where the soldiers left us, to\ncamp outside. Full of his warlike plan, Stephen went at once to the hut\nin which the slavers' guns had been stored with our own spare rifles and\nall the ammunition. I saw him emerge looking very blank indeed and asked\nhim what was the matter.\n\n\"Matter!\" he answered in a voice that for once really was full of\ndismay. \"The matter is that those Mazitu have stolen all the guns\nand all the ammunition. There's not enough powder left to make a blue\ndevil.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I replied, with the kind of joke one perpetrates under such\ncircumstances, \"we shall have plenty of blue devils without making any\nmore.\"\n\nTruly ours was a dreadful situation. Let the reader imagine it. Within\na little more than forty-eight hours we were to be shot to death with\narrows if an erratic old gentleman who, for aught I knew might be\ndead, did not turn up at what was then one of the remotest and most\ninaccessible spots in Central Africa. Moreover, our only hope that such\na thing would happen, if hope it could be called, was the prophecy of a\nKaffir witch-doctor.\n\nTo rely on this in any way was so absurd that I gave up thinking of\nit and set my mind to considering if there were any possible means of\nescape. After hours of reflection I could find none. Even Hans, with\nall his experience and nearly superhuman cunning, could suggest none.\nWe were unarmed and surrounded by thousands of savages, all of whom\nsave perhaps Babemba, believed us to be slave-traders, a race that very\nproperly they held in abhorrence, who had visited the country with the\nobject of stealing their women and children. The king, Bausi, a very\nprejudiced fellow, was dead against us. Also by a piece of foolishness\nwhich I now bitterly regretted, as indeed I regretted the whole\nexpedition, or at any rate entering on it in the absence of Brother\nJohn, we had made an implacable enemy of the head medicine-man, who to\nthese folk was a sort of Archbishop of Canterbury. Short of a miracle,\nthere was no hope for us. All that we could do was to say our prayers\nand prepare for the end.\n\nMavovo, it is true, remained cheerful. His faith in his \"Snake\" was\nreally touching. He offered to go through that divination process again\nin our presence and demonstrate that there was no mistake. I declined\nbecause I had no faith in divinations, and Stephen also declined, for\nanother reason, namely that the result might prove to be different,\nwhich, he held, would be depressing. The other Zulus oscillated between\nbelief and scepticism, as do the unstable who set to work to study the\nevidences of Christianity. But Sammy did not oscillate, he literally\nhowled, and prepared the food which poured in upon us so badly that I\nhad to turn on Hans to do the cooking, for however little appetite we\nmight have, it was necessary that we should keep up our strength by\neating.\n\n\"What, Mr. Quatermain,\" asked Sammy between his tears, \"is the use of\ndressing viands that our systems will never have time to thoroughly\nassimilate?\"\n\nThe first night passed somehow, and so did the next day and the next\nnight which heralded our last morning. I got up quite early and watched\nthe sunrise. Never, I think, had I realised before what a beautiful\nthing the sunrise is, at least not to the extent I did now when I was\nsaying good-bye to it for ever. Unless indeed there should prove to be\nstill lovelier sunrises beyond the dark of death! Then I went into\nour hut, and as Stephen, who had the nerves of a rhinoceros, was still\nsleeping like a tortoise in winter, I said my prayers earnestly enough,\nmourned over my sins which proved to be so many that at last I gave up\nthe job in despair, and then tried to occupy myself by reading the Old\nTestament, a book to which I have always been extremely attached.\n\nAs a passage that I lit on described how the prophet Samuel for whom I\ncould not help reading \"Imbozwi,\" hewed Agag in pieces after Bausi--I\nmean Saul--had relented and spared his life, I cannot say that it\nconsoled me very much. Doubtless, I reflected, these people believe that\nI, like Agag, had \"made women childless\" by my sword, so there remained\nnothing save to follow the example of that unhappy king and walk\n\"delicately\" to doom.\n\nThen, as Stephen was still sleeping--how _could_ he do it, I wondered--I\nset to work to make up the accounts of the expedition to date. It had\nalready cost \u00a31,423. Just fancy expending \u00a31,423 in order to be tied to\na post and shot to death with arrows. And all to get a rare orchid! Oh!\nI reflected to myself, if by some marvel I should escape, or if I should\nlive again in any land where these particular flowers flourish, I would\nnever even look at them. And as a matter of fact I never have.\n\nAt length Stephen did wake up and, as criminals are reported to do in\nthe papers before execution, made an excellent breakfast.\n\n\"What's the good of worrying?\" he said presently. \"I shouldn't if it\nweren't for my poor old father. It must have come to this one day, and\nthe sooner it is over the sooner to sleep, as the song says. When one\ncomes to think of it there are enormous advantages in sleep, for that's\nthe only time one is quite happy. Still, I should have liked to see that\nCypripedium first.\"\n\n\"Oh! drat the Cypripedium!\" I exclaimed, and blundered from the hut to\ntell Sammy that if he didn't stop his groaning I would punch his head.\n\n\"Jumps! Regular jumps! Who'd have thought it of Quatermain?\" I heard\nStephen mutter in the intervals of lighting his pipe.\n\nThe morning went \"like lightning that is greased,\" as Sammy remarked.\nThree o'clock came and Mavovo and his following sacrificed a kid to\nthe spirits of their ancestors, which, as Sammy remarked again, was \"a\nhorrible, heathen ceremony much calculated to prejudice our cause with\nPowers Above.\"\n\nWhen it was over, to my delight, Babemba appeared. He looked so pleasant\nthat I jumped to the conclusion that he brought the best of news\nwith him. Perhaps that the king had pardoned us, or perhaps--blessed\nthought--that Brother John had really arrived before his time.\n\nBut not a bit of it! All he had to say was that he had caused inquiries\nto be made along the route that ran to the coast and that certainly\nfor a hundred miles there was at present no sign of Dogeetah. So as the\nBlack Elephant was growing more and more enraged under the stirrings\nup of Imbozwi, it was obvious that that evening's ceremony must be\nperformed. Indeed, as it was part of his duty to superintend the\nerection of the posts to which we were to be tied and the digging of\nour graves at their bases, he had just come to count us again to be sure\nthat he had not made any mistake as to the number. Also, if there were\nany articles that we would like buried with us, would we be so kind as\nto point them out and he would be sure to see to the matter. It would be\nsoon over, and not painful, he added, as he had selected the very best\narchers in Beza Town who rarely missed and could, most of them, send an\narrow up to the feather into a buffalo.\n\nThen he chatted a little about other matters, as to where he should\nfind the magic shield I had given him, which he would always value as a\nsouvenir, etc., took a pinch of snuff with Mavovo and departed, saying\nthat he would be sure to return again at the proper time.\n\nIt was now four o'clock, and as Sammy was quite beyond it, Stephen made\nhimself some tea. It was very good tea, especially as we had milk to put\nin it, although I did not remember what it tasted like till afterwards.\n\nNow, having abandoned hope, I went into a hut alone to compose myself\nto meet my end like a gentleman, and seated there in silence and\nsemi-darkness my spirit grew much calmer. After all, I reflected, why\nshould I cling to life? In the country whither I travelled, as the\nreader who has followed my adventures will know, were some whom I\nclearly longed to see again, notably my father and my mother, and two\nnoble women who were even more to me. My boy, it is true, remained (he\nwas alive then), but I knew that he would find friends, and as I was not\nso badly off at that time, I had been able to make a proper provision\nfor him. Perhaps it was better that I should go, seeing that if I lived\non it would only mean more troubles and more partings.\n\nWhat was about to befall me of course I could not tell, but I knew then\nas I know now, that it was not extinction or even that sleep of which\nStephen had spoken. Perhaps I was passing to some place where at length\nthe clouds would roll away and I should understand; whence, too, I\nshould see all the landscape of the past and future, as an eagle does\nwatching from the skies, and be no longer like one struggling through\ndense bush, wild-beast and serpent haunted, beat upon by the storms of\nheaven and terrified with its lightnings, nor knowing whither I hewed\nmy path. Perhaps in that place there would be no longer what St. Paul\ndescribes as another law in my members warring against the law of my\nmind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin. Perhaps there\nthe past would be forgiven by the Power which knows whereof we are made,\nand I should become what I have always longed to be--good in every sense\nand even find open to me new and better roads of service. I take these\nthoughts from a note that I made in my pocket-book at the time.\n\nThus I reflected and then wrote a few lines of farewell in the fond\nand foolish hope that somehow they might find those to whom they were\naddressed (I have those letters still and very oddly they read to-day).\nThis done, I tried to throw out my mind towards Brother John if he still\nlived, as indeed I had done for days past, so that I might inform him of\nour plight and, I am afraid, reproach him for having brought us to such\nan end by his insane carelessness or want of faith.\n\nWhilst I was still engaged thus Babemba arrived with his soldiers to\nlead us off to execution. It was Hans who came to tell me that he was\nthere. The poor old Hottentot shook me by the hand and wiped his eyes\nwith his ragged coat-sleeve.\n\n\"Oh! Baas, this is our last journey,\" he said, \"and you are going to\nbe killed, Baas, and it is all my fault, Baas, because I ought to have\nfound a way out of the trouble which is what I was hired to do. But\nI can't, my head grows so stupid. Oh! if only I could come even with\nImbozwi I shouldn't mind, and I will, I _will_, if I have to return as a\nghost to do it. Well, Baas, you know the Predikant, your father, told\nus that we don't go out like a fire, but burn again for always\nelsewhere----\"\n\n(\"I hope not,\" I thought to myself.)\n\n\"And that quite easily without anything to pay for the wood. So I hope\nthat we shall always burn together, Baas. And meanwhile, I have brought\nyou a little something,\" and he produced what looked like a peculiarly\nobnoxious horseball. \"You swallow this now and you will never feel\nanything; it is a very good medicine that my grandfather's grandfather\ngot from the Spirit of his tribe. You will just go to sleep as nicely\nas though you were very drunk, and wake up in the beautiful fire which\nburns without any wood and never goes out for ever and ever, Amen.\"\n\n\"No, Hans,\" I said, \"I prefer to die with my eyes open.\"\n\n\"And so would I, Baas, if I thought there was any good in keeping them\nopen, but I don't, for I can't believe any more in the Snake of that\nblack fool, Mavovo. If it had been a good Snake, it would have told him\nto keep clear of Beza Town, so I will swallow one of these pills and\ngive the other to the Baas Stephen,\" and he crammed the filthy mess into\nhis mouth and with an effort got it down, as a young turkey does a ball\nof meal that is too big for its throat.\n\nThen, as I heard Stephen calling me, I left him invoking a most\ncomprehensive and polyglot curse upon the head of Imbozwi, to whom he\nrightly attributed all our woes.\n\n\"Our friend here says it is time to start,\" said Stephen, rather\nshakily, for the situation seemed to have got a hold of him at last,\nand nodding towards old Babemba, who stood there with a cheerful smile\nlooking as though he were going to conduct us to a wedding.\n\n\"Yes, white lord,\" said Babemba, \"it is time, and I have hurried so as\nnot to keep you waiting. It will be a very fine show, for the 'Black\nElephant' himself is going to do you the honour to be present, as will\nall the people of Beza Town and those for many miles round.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you old idiot,\" I said, \"and stop your grinning. If\nyou had been a man and not a false friend you would have got us out of\nthis trouble, knowing as you do very well that we are no sellers of men,\nbut rather the enemy of those who do such things.\"\n\n\"Oh! white lord,\" said Babemba, in a changed voice, \"believe me I only\nsmile to make you happy up to the end. My lips smile, but I am crying\ninside. I know that you are good and have told Bausi so, but he will\nnot believe me, who thinks that I have been bribed by you. What can I\ndo against that evil-hearted Imbozwi, the head of the witch-doctors, who\nhates you because he thinks you have better magic than he has and who\nwhispers day and night into the king's ear, telling him that if he does\nnot kill you, all our people will be slain or sold for slaves, as\nyou are only the scouts or a big army that is coming. Only last night\nImbozwi held a great divination _indaba_, and read this and a great\ndeal more in the enchanted water, making the king think he saw it in\npictures, whereas I, looking over his shoulder, could see nothing at\nall, except the ugly face of Imbozwi reflected in the water. Also he\nswore that his spirit told me that Dogeetah, the king's blood-brother,\nbeing dead, would never come to Beza Town again. I have done my best.\nKeep your heart white towards me, O Macumazana, and do not haunt me,\nfor I tell you I have done my best, and if ever I should get a chance\nagainst Imbozwi, which I am afraid I shan't, as he will poison me first,\nI will pay him back. Oh! he shall not die quickly as you will.\"\n\n\"I wish I could get a chance at him,\" I muttered, for even in this\nsolemn moment I could cultivate no Christian spirit towards Imbozwi.\n\nFeeling that he was honest after all, I shook old Babemba's hand and\ngave him the letters I had written, asking him to try and get them to\nthe coast. Then we started on our last walk.\n\nThe Zulu hunters were already outside the fence, seated on the ground,\nchatting and taking snuff. I wondered if this was because they really\nbelieved in Mavovo's confounded Snake, or from bravado, inspired by the\ninnate courage of their race. When they saw me they sprang to their\nfeet and, lifting their right hands, gave me a loud and hearty salute\nof \"Inkoosi! Baba! Inkoosi! Macumazana!\" Then, at a signal from Mavovo,\nthey broke into some Zulu war-chant, which they kept up till we reached\nthe stakes. Sammy, too, broke into a chant, but one of quite a different\nnature.\n\n\"Be quiet!\" I said to him. \"Can't you die like a man?\"\n\n\"No, indeed I cannot, Mr. Quatermain,\" he answered, and went on howling\nfor pity in about twenty different languages.\n\nStephen and I walked together, he still carrying the Union Jack, of\nwhich no one tried to deprive him. I think the Mazitu believed it was\nhis fetish. We didn't talk much, though once he said:\n\n\"Well, the love of orchids has brought many a man to a bad end. I wonder\nwhether the Governor will keep my collection or sell it.\"\n\nAfter this he relapsed into silence, and not knowing and indeed not\ncaring what would happen to his collection, I made no answer.\n\nWe had not far to go; personally I could have preferred a longer walk.\nPassing with our guards down a kind of by-street, we emerged suddenly at\nthe head of the market-place, to find that it was packed with thousands\nof people gathered there to see our execution. I noticed that they were\narranged in orderly companies and that a broad open roadway was left\nbetween them, running to the southern gate of the market, I suppose to\nfacilitate the movements of so large a crowd.\n\nAll this multitude received us in respectful silence, though Sammy's\nhowls caused some of them to smile, while the Zulu war-chant appeared to\nexcite their wonder, or admiration. At the head of the market-place, not\nfar from the king's enclosure, fifteen stout posts had been planted on\nas many mounds. These mounds were provided so that everyone might see\nthe show and, in part at any rate, were made of soil hollowed from\nfifteen deep graves dug almost at the foot of the mounds. Or rather\nthere were seventeen posts, an extra large one being set at each end of\nthe line in order to accommodate the two donkeys, which it appeared were\nalso to be shot to death. A great number of soldiers kept a space\nclear in front of the posts. On this space were gathered Bausi, his\ncouncillors, some of his head wives, Imbozwi more hideously painted than\nusual, and perhaps fifty or sixty picked archers with strung bows and an\nample supply of arrows, whose part in the ceremony it was not difficult\nfor us to guess.\n\n\"King Bausi,\" I said as I was led past that potentate, \"you are a\nmurderer and Heaven Above will be avenged upon you for this crime. If\nour blood is shed, soon you shall die and come to meet us where _we_\nhave power, and your people shall be destroyed.\"\n\nMy words seemed to frighten the man, for he answered:\n\n\"I am no murderer. I kill you because you are robbers of men. Moreover,\nit is not I who have passed sentence on you. It is Imbozwi here, the\nchief of the doctors, who has told me all about you, and whose spirit\nsays you must die unless my brother Dogeetah appears to save you. If\nDogeetah comes, which he cannot do because he is dead, and vouches for\nyou, then I shall know that Imbozwi is a wicked liar, and as you were to\ndie, so he shall die.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" screeched Imbozwi. \"If Dogeetah comes, as that false wizard\nprophesies,\" and he pointed to Mavovo, \"then I shall be ready to die in\nyour place, white slave-dealers. Yes, yes, then you may shoot _me_ with\narrows.\"\n\n\"King, take note of those words, and people, take note of those words,\nthat they may be fulfilled if Dogeetah comes,\" said Mavovo in a great,\ndeep voice.\n\n\"I take note of them,\" answered Bausi, \"and I swear by my mother on\nbehalf of all the people, that they shall be fulfilled--if Dogeetah\ncomes.\"\n\n\"Good,\" exclaimed Mavovo, and stalked on to the stake which had been\npointed out to him.\n\nAs he went he whispered something into Imbozwi's ear that seemed to\nfrighten that limb of Satan, for I saw him start and shiver. However, he\nsoon recovered, for in another minute he was engaged in superintending\nthose whose business it was to lash us to the posts.\n\nThis was done simply and effectively by tying our wrists with a grass\nrope behind these posts, each of which was fitted with two projecting\npieces of wood that passed under our arms and practically prevented\nus from moving. Stephen and I were given the places of honour in the\nmiddle, the Union Jack being fixed, by his own request, to the top of\nStephen's stake. Mavovo was on my right, and the other Zulus were ranged\non either side of us. Hans and Sammy occupied the end posts respectively\n(except those to which the poor jackasses were bound). I noted that Hans\nwas already very sleepy and that shortly after he was fixed up, his head\ndropped forward on his breast. Evidently his medicine was working, and\nalmost I regretted that I had not taken some while I had the chance.\n\nWhen we were all fastened, Imbozwi came round to inspect. Moreover, with\na piece of white chalk he made a round mark on the breast of each of us;\na kind of bull's eye for the archers to aim at.\n\n\"Ah! white man,\" he said to me as he chalked away at my shooting coat,\n\"you will never burn anyone's hair again with your magic shield. Never,\nnever, for presently I shall be treading down the earth upon you in that\nhole, and your goods will belong to me.\"\n\nI did not answer, for what was the use of talking to this vile brute\nwhen my time was so short. So he passed on to Stephen and began to chalk\nhim. Stephen, however, in whom the natural man still prevailed, shouted:\n\n\"Take your filthy hands off me,\" and lifting his leg, which was\nunfettered, gave the painted witch-doctor such an awful kick in the\nstomach, that he vanished backwards into the grave beneath him.\n\n\"_Ow!_ Well done, Wazela!\" said the Zulus, \"we hope that you have killed\nhim.\"\n\n\"I hope so too,\" said Stephen, and the multitude of spectators gasped to\nsee the sacred person of the head witch-doctor, of whom they evidently\nwent in much fear, treated in such a way. Only Babemba grinned, and even\nthe king Bausi did not seem displeased.\n\nBut Imbozwi was not to be disposed of so easily, for presently, with the\nhelp of sundry myrmidons, minor witch-doctors, he scrambled out of the\ngrave, cursing and covered with mud, for it was wet down there. After\nthat I took no more heed of him or of much else. Seeing that I had only\nhalf an hour to live, as may be imagined, I was otherwise engaged.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n                        THE COMING OF DOGEETAH\n\nThe sunset that day was like the sunrise, particularly fine, although\nas in the case of the tea, I remembered little of it till afterwards.\nIn fact, thunder was about, which always produces grand cloud effects in\nAfrica.\n\nThe sun went down like a great red eye, over which there dropped\nsuddenly a black eyelid of cloud with a fringe of purple lashes.\n\nThere's the last I shall see of you, my old friend, thought I to myself,\nunless I catch you up presently.\n\nThe gloom began to gather. The king looked about him, also at the sky\noverhead, as though he feared rain, then whispered something to Babemba,\nwho nodded and strolled up to my post.\n\n\"White lord,\" he said, \"the Elephant wishes to know if you are ready, as\npresently the light will be very bad for shooting?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered with decision, \"not till half an hour after sundown as\nwas agreed.\"\n\nBabemba went to the king and returned to me.\n\n\"White lord, the king says that a bargain is a bargain, and he will keep\nto his word. Only you must not then blame him if the shooting is bad,\nsince of course he did not know that the night would be so cloudy, which\nis not usual at this time of year.\"\n\nIt grew darker and darker, till at length we might have been lost in a\nLondon fog. The dense masses of the people looked like banks, and the\narchers, flitting to and fro as they made ready, might have been shadows\nin Hades. Once or twice lightning flashed and was followed after a pause\nby the distant growling of thunder. The air, too, grew very oppressive.\nDense silence reigned. In all those multitudes no one spoke or stirred;\neven Sammy ceased his howling, I suppose because he had become exhausted\nand fainted away, as people often do just before they are hanged. It was\na most solemn time. Nature seemed to be adapting herself to the mood of\nsacrifice and making ready for us a mighty pall.\n\nAt length I heard the sound of arrows being drawn from their quivers,\nand then the squeaky voice of Imbozwi, saying:\n\n\"Wait a little, the cloud will lift. There is light behind it, and it\nwill be nicer if they can see the arrows coming.\"\n\nThe cloud did begin to lift, very slowly, and from beneath it flowed a\ngreen light like that in a cat's eye.\n\n\"Shall we shoot, Imbozwi?\" asked the voice of the captain of the\narchers.\n\n\"Not yet, not yet. Not till the people can watch them die.\"\n\nThe edge of cloud lifted a little more; the green light turned to a\nfiery red thrown by the sunk sun and reflected back upon the earth from\nthe dense black cloud above. It was as though all the landscape had\nburst into flames, while the heaven over us remained of the hue of ink.\nAgain the lightning flashed, showing the faces and staring eyes of the\nthousands who watched, and even the white teeth of a great bat that\nflittered past. That flash seemed to burn off an edge of the lowering\ncloud and the light grew stronger and stronger, and redder and redder.\n\nImbozwi uttered a hiss like a snake. I heard a bow-string twang, and\nalmost at the same moment the thud of an arrow striking my post just\nabove my head. Indeed, by lifting myself I could touch it. I shut my\neyes and began to see all sorts of queer things that I had forgotten\nfor years and years. My brain swam and seemed to melt into a kind of\nconfusion. Through the intense silence I thought I heard the sound of\nsome animal running heavily, much as a fat bull eland does when it is\nsuddenly disturbed. Someone uttered a startled exclamation, which caused\nme to open my eyes again. The first thing I saw was the squad of savage\narchers lifting their bows--evidently that first arrow had been a kind\nof trial shot. The next, looking absolutely unearthly in that terrible\nand ominous light, was a tall figure seated on a white ox shambling\nrapidly towards us along the open roadway that ran from the southern\ngate of the market-place.\n\nOf course, I knew that I dreamed, for this figure exactly resembled\nBrother John. There was his long, snowy beard. There in his hand was his\nbutterfly net, with the handle of which he seemed to be prodding the ox.\nOnly he was wound about with wreaths of flowers as were the great horns\nof the ox, and on either side of him and before and behind him ran\ngirls, also wreathed with flowers. It was a vision, nothing else, and I\nshut my eyes again awaiting the fatal arrow.\n\n\"Shoot!\" screamed Imbozwi.\n\n\"Nay, shoot not!\" shouted Babemba. \"_Dogeetah is come!_\"\n\nA moment's pause, during which I heard arrows falling to the ground;\nthen from all those thousands of throats a roar that shaped itself to\nthe words:\n\n\"Dogeetah! Dogeetah is come to save the white lords.\"\n\nI must confess that after this my nerve, which is generally pretty good,\ngave out to such an extent that I think I fainted for a few minutes.\nDuring that faint I seemed to be carrying on a conversation with Mavovo,\nthough whether it ever took place or I only imagined it I am not sure,\nsince I always forgot to ask him.\n\nHe said, or I thought he said, to me:\n\n\"And now, Macumazana, my father, what have you to say? Does my Snake\nstand upon its tail or does it not? Answer, I am listening.\"\n\nTo which I replied, or seemed to reply:\n\n\"Mavovo, my child, certainly it appears as though your Snake _does_\nstand upon its tail. Still, I hold that all this is a phantasy; that\nwe live in a land of dream in which nothing is real except those things\nwhich we cannot see or touch or hear. That there is no me and no you\nand no Snake at all, nothing but a Power in which we move, that shows us\npictures and laughs when we think them real.\"\n\nWhereon Mavovo said, or seemed to say:\n\n\"Ah! at last you touch the truth, O Macumazana, my father. All things\nare a shadow and we are shadows in a shadow. But what throws the shadow,\nO Macumazana, my father? Why does Dogeetah appear to come hither riding\non a white ox and why do all these thousands think that my Snake stands\nso very stiff upon its tail?\"\n\n\"I'm hanged if I know,\" I replied and woke up.\n\nThere, without doubt, _was_ old Brother John with a wreath of flowers--I\nnoted in disgust that they were orchids--hanging in a bacchanalian\nfashion from his dinted sun-helmet over his left eye. He was in a\nfurious rage and reviling Bausi, who literally crouched before him, and\nI was in a furious rage and reviling him. What I said I do not remember,\nbut he said, his white beard bristling with indignation while he\nthreatened Bausi with the handle of the butterfly net:\n\n\"You dog! You savage, whom I saved from death and called Brother. What\nwere you doing to these white men who are in truth my brothers, and to\ntheir followers? Were you about to kill them? Oh! if so, I will forget\nmy vow, I will forget the bond that binds us and----\"\n\n\"Don't, pray don't,\" said Bausi. \"It is all a horrible mistake; I am\nnot to be blamed at all. It is that witch-doctor, Imbozwi, whom by the\nancient law of the land I must obey in such matters. He consulted his\nSpirit and declared that you were dead; also that these white lords\nwere the most wicked of men, slave-traders with spotted hearts, who came\nhither to spy out the Mazitu people and to destroy them with magic and\nbullets.\"\n\n\"Then he lied,\" thundered Brother John, \"and he knew that he lied.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, it is evident that he lied,\" answered Bausi. \"Bring him here,\nand with him those who serve him.\"\n\nNow by the light of the moon which was shining brightly in the heavens,\nfor the thunder-clouds had departed with the last glow of sunset,\nsoldiers began an active search for Imbozwi and his confederates. Of\nthese they caught eight or ten, all wicked-looking fellows hideously\npainted and adorned like their master, but Imbozwi himself they could\nnot find.\n\nI began to think that in the confusion he had given us the slip, when\npresently from the far end of the line, for we were still all tied to\nour stakes, I heard the voice of Sammy, hoarse, it is true, but quite\ncheerful now, saying:\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain, in the interests of justice, will you inform his\nMajesty that the treacherous wizard for whom he is seeking, is now\npeeping and muttering at the bottom of the grave which was dug to\nreceive my mortal remains.\"\n\nI did inform his Majesty, and in double-quick time our friend Imbozwi\nwas once more fished out of a grave by the strong arms of Babemba and\nhis soldiers, and dragged into the presence of the irate Bausi.\n\n\"Loose the white lords and their followers,\" said Bausi, \"and let them\ncome here.\"\n\nSo our bonds were undone and we walked to where the king and Brother\nJohn stood, the miserable Imbozwi and his attendant doctors huddled in a\nheap before them.\n\n\"Who is this?\" said Bausi to him, pointing at Brother John. \"Is it not\nhe whom you vowed was dead?\"\n\nImbozwi did not seem to think that the question required an answer, so\nBausi continued:\n\n\"What was the song that you sang in our ears just now--that if Dogeetah\ncame you would be ready to be shot to death with arrows in the place of\nthese white lords whose lives you swore away, was it not?\"\n\nAgain Imbozwi made no answer, although Babemba called his attention to\nthe king's query with a vigorous kick. Then Bausi shouted:\n\n\"By your own mouth are you condemned, O liar, and that shall be done\nto you which you have yourself decreed,\" adding almost in the words of\nElijah after he had triumphed over the priests of Baal, \"Take away these\nfalse prophets. Let none of them escape. Say you not so, O people?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" roared the multitude fiercely, \"take them away.\"\n\n\"Not a popular character, Imbozwi,\" Stephen remarked to me in a\nreflective voice. \"Well, he is going to be served hot on his own toast\nnow, and serve the brute right.\"\n\n\"Who is the false doctor now?\" mocked Mavovo in the silence\nthat followed. \"Who is about to sup on arrow-heads, O\nPainter-of-white-spots?\" and he pointed to the mark that Imbozwi had\nso gleefully chalked over his heart as a guide to the arrows of the\narchers.\n\nNow, seeing that all was lost, the little humpbacked villain with a\nsudden twist caught me by the legs and began to plead for mercy. So\npiteously did he plead, that being already softened by the fact of our\nwonderful escape from those black graves, my heart was melted in me. I\nturned to ask the king to spare his life, though with little hope that\nthe prayer would be granted, for I saw that Bausi feared and hated the\nman and was only too glad of the opportunity to be rid of him. Imbozwi,\nhowever, interpreted my movement differently, since among savages the\nturning of the back always means that a petition is refused. Then, in\nhis rage and despair, the venom of his wicked heart boiled over. He\nleapt to his feet, and drawing a big, carved knife from among his\nwitch-doctor's trappings, sprang at me like a wild cat, shouting:\n\n\"At least you shall come too, white dog!\"\n\nMost mercifully Mavovo was watching him, for that is a good Zulu saying\nwhich declares that \"Wizard is Wizard's fate.\" With one bound he was on\nhim. Just as the knife touched me--it actually pricked my skin\nthough without drawing blood, which was fortunate as probably it was\npoisoned--he gripped Imbozwi's arm in his grasp of iron and hurled him\nto the ground as though he were but a child.\n\nAfter this of course all was over.\n\n\"Come away,\" I said to Stephen and Brother John; \"this is no place for\nus.\"\n\nSo we went and gained our huts without molestation and indeed quite\nunobserved, for the attention of everyone in Beza Town was fully\noccupied elsewhere. From the market-place behind us rose so hideous a\nclamour that we rushed into my hut and shut the door to escape or lessen\nthe sound. It was dark in the hut, for which I was really thankful, for\nthe darkness seemed to soothe my nerves. Especially was this so when\nBrother John said:\n\n\"Friend, Allan Quatermain, and you, young gentleman, whose name I don't\nknow, I will tell you what I think I never mentioned to you before,\nthat, in addition to being a doctor, I am a clergyman of the American\nEpiscopalian Church. Well, as a clergyman, I will ask your leave to\nreturn thanks for your very remarkable deliverance from a cruel death.\"\n\n\"By all means,\" I muttered for both of us, and he did so in a most\nearnest and beautiful prayer. Brother John may or may not have been\na little touched in the head at this time of his life, but he was\ncertainly an able and a good man.\n\nAfterwards, as the shrieks and shouting had now died down to a confused\nmurmur of many voices, we went and sat outside under the projecting\neaves of the hut, where I introduced Stephen Somers to Brother John.\n\n\"And now,\" I said, \"in the name of goodness, where do you come from tied\nup in flowers like a Roman priest at sacrifice, and riding on a bull\nlike the lady called Europa? And what on earth do you mean by playing\nus such a scurvy trick down there in Durban, leaving us without a word\nafter you had agreed to guide us to this hellish hole?\"\n\nBrother John stroked his long beard and looked at me reproachfully.\n\n\"I guess, Allan,\" he said in his American fashion, \"there is a mistake\nsomewhere. To answer the last part of your question first, I did not\nleave you without a word; I gave a letter to that lame old Griqua\ngardener of yours, Jack, to be handed to you when you arrived.\"\n\n\"Then the idiot either lost it and lied to me, as Griquas will, or he\nforgot all about it.\"\n\n\"That is likely. I ought to have thought of that, Allan, but I didn't.\nWell, in that letter I said that I would meet you here, where I should\nhave been six weeks ago awaiting you. Also I sent a message to Bausi to\nwarn him of your coming in case I should be delayed, but I suppose that\nsomething happened to it on the road.\"\n\n\"Why did you not wait and come with us like a sensible man?\"\n\n\"Allan, as you ask me straight out, I will tell you, although the\nsubject is one of which I do not care to speak. I knew that you were\ngoing to journey by Kilwa; indeed it was your only route with a lot\nof people and so much baggage, and I did not wish to visit Kilwa.\" He\npaused, then went on: \"A long while ago, nearly twenty-three years to be\naccurate, I went to live at Kilwa as a missionary with my young wife. I\nbuilt a mission station and a church there, and we were happy and fairly\nsuccessful in our work. Then on one evil day the Swahili and other Arabs\ncame in dhows to establish a slave-dealing station. I resisted them, and\nthe end of it was that they attacked us, killed most of my people and\nenslaved the rest. In that attack I received a cut from a sword on the\nhead--look, here is the mark of it,\" and drawing his white hair apart he\nshowed us a long scar that was plainly visible in the moonlight.\n\n\"The blow knocked me senseless just about sunset one evening. When\nI came to myself again it was broad daylight and everybody was gone,\nexcept one old woman who was tending me. She was half-crazed with grief\nbecause her husband and two sons had been killed, and another son, a\nboy, and a daughter had been taken away. I asked her where my young wife\nwas. She answered that she, too, had been taken away eight or ten hours\nbefore, because the Arabs had seen the lights of a ship out at sea, and\nthought they might be those of a British man-of-war that was known to be\ncruising on the coast. On seeing these they had fled inland in a hurry,\nleaving me for dead, but killing the wounded before they went. The old\nwoman herself had escaped by hiding among some rocks on the seashore,\nand after the Arabs had gone had crept back to the house and found me\nstill alive.\n\n\"I asked her where my wife had been taken. She said she did not know,\nbut some others of our people told her that they had heard the Arabs\nsay they were going to some place a hundred miles inland, to join their\nleader, a half-bred villain named Hassan-ben-Mohammed, to whom they were\ncarrying my wife as a present.\n\n\"Now we knew this wretch, for after the Arabs landed at Kilwa, but\nbefore actual hostilities broke out between us, he had fallen sick of\nsmallpox and my wife had helped to nurse him. Had it not been for her,\nindeed, he would have died. However, although the leader of the band,\nhe was not present at the attack, being engaged in some slave-raiding\nbusiness in the interior.\n\n\"When I learned this terrible news, the shock of it, or the loss of\nblood, brought on a return of insensibility, from which I only awoke\ntwo days later to find myself on board a Dutch trading vessel that was\nsailing for Zanzibar. It was the lights of this ship that the Arabs had\nseen and mistaken for those of an English man-of-war. She had put into\nKilwa for water, and the sailors, finding me on the verandah of the\nhouse and still living, in the goodness of their hearts carried me on\nboard. Of the old woman they had seen nothing; I suppose that at their\napproach she ran away.\n\n\"At Zanzibar, in an almost dying condition, I was handed over to a\nclergyman of our mission, in whose house I lay desperately ill for a\nlong while. Indeed six months went by before I fully recovered my right\nmind. Some people say that I have never recovered it; perhaps you are\none of them, Allan.\n\n\"At last the wound in my skull healed, after a clever English naval\nsurgeon had removed some bits of splintered bone, and my strength came\nback to me. I was and still am an American subject, and in those days we\nhad no consul at Zanzibar, if there is one there now, of which I am not\nsure, and of course no warship. The English made what inquiries they\ncould for me, but could find out little or nothing, since all the\ncountry about Kilwa was in possession of Arab slave-traders who were\nsupported by a ruffian who called himself the Sultan of Zanzibar.\"\n\nAgain he paused, as though overcome by the sadness of his recollections.\n\n\"Did you never hear any more of your wife?\" asked Stephen.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Somers; I heard at Zanzibar from a slave whom our mission\nbought and freed, that he had seen a white woman who answered to her\ndescription alive and apparently well, at some place I was unable to\nidentify. He could only tell me that it was fifteen days' journey from\nthe coast. She was then in charge of some black people, he did not know\nof what tribe, who, he believed, had found her wandering in the bush.\nHe noted that the black people seemed to treat her with the greatest\nreverence, although they could not understand what she said. On the\nfollowing day, whilst searching for six lost goats, he was captured by\nArabs who, he heard afterwards, were out looking for this white woman.\nThe day after the man had told me this, he was seized with inflammation\nof the lungs, of which, being in a weak state from his sufferings in\nthe slave gang, he quickly died. Now you will understand why I was not\nparticularly anxious to revisit Kilwa.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"we understand that, and a good deal more of which we\nwill talk later. But, to change the subject, where do you come from now,\nand how did you happen to turn up just in the nick of time?\"\n\n\"I was journeying here across country by a route I will show you on my\nmap,\" he answered, \"when I met with an accident to my leg\" (here Stephen\nand I looked at each other) \"which kept me laid up in a Kaffir hut for\nsix weeks. When I got better, as I could not walk very well I rode upon\noxen that I had trained. That white beast you saw is the last of them;\nthe others died of the bite of the tsetse fly. A fear which I could\nnot define caused me to press forward as fast as possible; for the last\ntwenty-four hours I have scarcely stopped to eat or sleep. When I got\ninto the Mazitu country this morning I found the kraals empty, except\nfor some women and girls, who knew me again, and threw these flowers\nover me. They told me that all the men had gone to Beza Town for a great\nfeast, but what the feast was they either did not know or would not\nreveal. So I hurried on and arrived in time--thank God in time! It is a\nlong story; I will tell you the details afterwards. Now we are all too\ntired. What's that noise?\"\n\nI listened and recognised the triumphant song of the Zulu hunters, who\nwere returning from the savage scene in the market-place. Presently\nthey arrived, headed by Sammy, a very different Sammy from the wailing\ncreature who had gone out to execution an hour or two before. Now he\nwas the gayest of the gay, and about his neck were strung certain weird\nornaments which I identified as the personal property of Imbozwi.\n\n\"Virtue is victorious and justice has been done, Mr. Quatermain. These\nare the spoils of war,\" he said, pointing to the trappings of the late\nwitch-doctor.\n\n\"Oh! get out, you little cur! We want to know nothing more,\" I said.\n\"Go, cook us some supper,\" and he went, not in the least abashed.\n\nThe hunters were carrying between them what appeared to be the body\nof Hans. At first I was frightened, thinking that he must be dead, but\nexamination showed that he was only in a state of insensibility such as\nmight be induced by laudanum. Brother John ordered him to be wrapped up\nin a blanket and laid by the fire, and this was done.\n\nPresently Mavovo approached and squatted down in front of us.\n\n\"Macumazana, my father,\" he said quietly, \"what words have you for me?\"\n\n\"Words of thanks, Mavovo. If you had not been so quick, Imbozwi would\nhave finished me. As it is, the knife only touched my skin without\nbreaking it, for Dogeetah has looked to see.\"\n\nMavovo waved his hand as though to sweep this little matter aside, and\nasked, looking me straight in the eyes:\n\n\"And what other words, Macumazana? As to my Snake I mean.\"\n\n\"Only that you were right and I was wrong,\" I answered shamefacedly.\n\"Things have happened as you foretold, how or why I do not understand.\"\n\n\"No, my father, because you white men are so vain\" (\"blown out\" was his\nword), \"that you think you have all wisdom. Now you have learned that\nthis is not so. I am content. The false doctors are all dead, my father,\nand I think that Imbozwi----\"\n\nI held up my hand, not wishing to hear details. Mavovo rose, and with a\nlittle smile, went about his business.\n\n\"What does he mean about his Snake?\" inquired Brother John curiously.\n\nI told him as briefly as I could, and asked him if he could explain the\nmatter. He shook his head.\n\n\"The strangest example of native vision that I have ever heard of,\" he\nanswered, \"and the most useful. Explain! There is no explanation, except\nthe old one that there are more things in heaven and earth, etc., and\nthat God gives different gifts to different men.\"\n\nThen we ate our supper; I think one of the most joyful meals of which I\nhave ever partaken. It is wonderful how good food tastes when one never\nexpected to swallow another mouthful. After it was finished the others\nwent to bed but, with the still unconscious Hans for my only companion,\nI sat for a while smoking by the fire, for on this high tableland the\nair was chilly. I felt that as yet I could not sleep; if for no other\nreason because of the noise that the Mazitu were making in the town, I\nsuppose in celebration of the execution of the terrible witch-doctors\nand the return of Dogeetah.\n\nSuddenly Hans awoke, and sitting up, stared at me through the bright\nflame which I had recently fed with dry wood.\n\n\"Baas,\" he said in a hollow voice, \"there you are, here I am, and there\nis the fire which never goes out, a very good fire. But, Baas, why are\nwe not inside of it as your father the Predikant promised, instead of\noutside here in the cold?\"\n\n\"Because you are still in the world, you old fool, and not where you\ndeserve to be,\" I answered. \"Because Mavovo's Snake was a snake with a\ntrue tongue after all, and Dogeetah came as it foretold. Because we are\nall alive and well, and it is Imbozwi with his spawn who are dead upon\nthe posts. That is why, Hans, as you would have seen for yourself if you\nhad kept awake, instead of swallowing filthy medicine like a frightened\nwoman, just because you were afraid of death, which at your age you\nought to have welcomed.\"\n\n\"Oh! Baas,\" broke in Hans, \"don't tell me that things are so and that\nwe are really alive in what your honoured father used to call this gourd\nfull of tears. Don't tell me, Baas, that I made a coward of myself and\nswallowed that beastliness--if you knew what it was made of you would\nunderstand, Baas--for nothing but a bad headache. Don't tell me that\nDogeetah came when my eyes were not open to see him, and worst of all,\nthat Imbozwi and his children were tied to those poles when I was not\nable to help them out of the bottle of tears into the fire that burns\nfor ever and ever. Oh! it is too much, and I swear, Baas, that however\noften I have to die, henceforward it shall always be with my eyes open,\"\nand holding his aching head between his hands he rocked himself to and\nfro in bitter grief.\n\nWell might Hans be sad, seeing that he never heard the last of the\nincident. The hunters invented a new and gigantic name for him, which\nmeant \"The little-yellow-mouse-who-feeds-on-sleep-while-the-black-rats\neat-up-their-enemies.\" Even Sammy made a mock of him, showing him the\nspoils which he declared he had wrenched unaided from the mighty master\nof magic, Imbozwi. As indeed he had--after the said Imbozwi was stone\ndead at the stake.\n\nIt was very amusing until things grew so bad that I feared Hans would\nkill Sammy, and had to put a stop to the joke.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n                         BROTHER JOHN'S STORY\n\nAlthough I went to bed late I was up before sunrise. Chiefly because I\nwished to have some private conversation with Brother John, whom I knew\nto be a very early riser. Indeed, he slept less than any man I ever met.\n\nAs I expected, I found him astir in his hut; he was engaged in pressing\nflowers by candlelight.\n\n\"John,\" I said, \"I have brought you some property which I think you\nhave lost,\" and I handed him the morocco-bound _Christian Year_ and the\nwater-colour drawing which we had found in the sacked mission house at\nKilwa.\n\nHe looked first at the picture and then at the book; at least, I suppose\nhe did, for I went outside the hut for a while--to observe the sunrise.\nIn a few minutes he called me, and when the door was shut, said in an\nunsteady voice:\n\n\"How did you come by these relics, Allan?\"\n\nI told him the story from beginning to end. He listened without a word,\nand when I had finished said:\n\n\"I may as well tell what perhaps you have guessed, that the picture is\nthat of my wife, and the book is her book.\"\n\n\"Is!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, Allan. I say _is_ because I do not believe that she is dead. I\ncannot explain why, any more than I could explain last night how that\ngreat Zulu savage was able to prophesy my coming. But sometimes we can\nwring secrets from the Unknown, and I believe that I have won this truth\nin answer to my prayers, that my wife still lives.\"\n\n\"After twenty years, John?\"\n\n\"Yes, after twenty years. Why do you suppose,\" he asked almost fiercely,\n\"that for two-thirds of a generation I have wandered about among African\nsavages, pretending to be crazy because these wild people revere the mad\nand always let them pass unharmed?\"\n\n\"I thought it was to collect butterflies and botanical specimens.\"\n\n\"Butterflies and botanical specimens! These were the pretext. I have\nbeen and am searching for my wife. You may think it a folly, especially\nconsidering what was her condition when we separated--she was expecting\na child, Allan--but I do not. I believe that she is hidden away among\nsome of these wild peoples.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps it would be as well not to find her,\" I answered,\nbethinking me of the fate which had overtaken sundry white women in the\nold days, who had escaped from shipwrecks on the coast and become the\nwives of Kaffirs.\n\n\"Not so, Allan. On that point I fear nothing. If God has preserved my\nwife, He has also protected her from every harm. And now,\" he went on,\n\"you will understand why I wish to visit these Pongo--the Pongo who\nworship a white goddess!\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I said and left him, for having learned all there was to\nknow, I thought it best not to prolong a painful conversation. To me\nit seemed incredible that this lady should still live, and I feared\nthe effect upon him of the discovery that she was no more. How full\nof romance is this poor little world of ours! Think of Brother John\n(Eversley was his real name as I discovered afterwards), and what his\nlife had been. A high-minded educated man trying to serve his Faith in\nthe dark places of the earth, and taking his young wife with him,\nwhich for my part I have never considered a right thing to do. Neither\ntradition nor Holy Writ record that the Apostles dragged their wives and\nfamilies into the heathen lands where they went to preach, although I\nbelieve that some of them were married. But this is by the way.\n\nThen falls the blow; the mission house is sacked, the husband escapes by\na miracle and the poor young lady is torn away to be the prey of a vile\nslave-trader. Lastly, according to the quite unreliable evidence of\nsome savage already in the shadow of death, she is seen in the charge of\nother unknown savages. On the strength of this the husband, playing the\npart of a mad botanist, hunts for her for a score of years, enduring\nincredible hardships and yet buoyed up by a high and holy trust. To my\nmind it was a beautiful and pathetic story. Still, for reasons which I\nhave suggested, I confess that I hoped that long ago she had returned\ninto the hands of the Power which made her, for what would be the state\nof a young white lady who for two decades had been at the mercy of these\nblack brutes?\n\nAnd yet, and yet, after my experience of Mavovo and his Snake, I did not\nfeel inclined to dogmatise about anything. Who and what was I, that I\nshould venture not only to form opinions, but to thrust them down the\nthroats of others? After all, how narrow are the limits of the knowledge\nupon which we base our judgments. Perhaps the great sea of intuition\nthat surrounds us is safer to float on than are these little islets of\nindividual experience, whereon we are so wont to take our stand.\n\nMeanwhile my duty was not to speculate on the dreams and mental\nattitudes of others, but like a practical hunter and trader, to carry to\na successful issue an expedition that I was well paid to manage, and to\ndig up a certain rare flower root, if I could find it, in the marketable\nvalue of which I had an interest. I have always prided myself upon my\nentire lack of imagination and all such mental phantasies, and upon an\naptitude for hard business and an appreciation of the facts of life,\nthat after all are the things with which we have to do. This is the\ntruth; at least, I hope it is. For if I were to be _quite_ honest, which\nno one ever has been, except a gentleman named Mr. Pepys, who, I think,\nlived in the reign of Charles II, and who, to judge from his memoirs,\nwhich I have read lately, did not write for publication, I should have\nto admit that there is another side to my nature. I sternly suppress it,\nhowever, at any rate for the present.\n\nWhile we were at breakfast Hans who, still suffering from headache and\nremorse, was lurking outside the gateway far from the madding crowd\nof critics, crept in like a beaten dog and announced that Babemba was\napproaching followed by a number of laden soldiers. I was about to\nadvance to receive him. Then I remembered that, owing to a queer native\ncustom, such as that which caused Sir Theophilus Shepstone, whom I used\nto know very well, to be recognised as the holder of the spirit of the\ngreat Chaka and therefore as the equal of the Zulu monarchs, Brother\nJohn was the really important man in our company. So I gave way and\nasked him to be good enough to take my place and to live up to that\nstation in savage life to which it had pleased God to call him.\n\nI am bound to say he rose to the occasion very well, being by nature\nand appearance a dignified old man. Swallowing his coffee in a hurry,\nhe took his place at a little distance from us, and stood there in a\nstatuesque pose. To him entered Babemba crawling on his hands and knees,\nand other native gentlemen likewise crawling, also the burdened soldiers\nin as obsequious an attitude as their loads would allow.\n\n\"O King Dogeetah,\" said Babemba, \"your brother king, Bausi, returns the\nguns and fire-goods of the white men, your children, and sends certain\ngifts.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear it, General Babemba,\" said Brother John, \"although it\nwould be better if he had never taken them away. Put them down and get\non to your feet. I do not like to see men wriggling on their stomachs\nlike monkeys.\"\n\nThe order was obeyed, and we checked the guns and ammunition; also\nour revolvers and the other articles that had been taken away from us.\nNothing was missing or damaged; and in addition there were four fine\nelephant's tusks, an offering to Stephen and myself, which, as a\nbusiness man, I promptly accepted; some karosses and Mazitu weapons,\npresents to Mavovo and the hunters, a beautiful native bedstead with\nivory legs and mats of finely-woven grass, a gift to Hans in testimony\nto his powers of sleep under trying circumstances (the Zulus roared when\nthey heard this, and Hans vanished cursing behind the huts), and for\nSammy a weird musical instrument with a request that in future he would\nuse it in public instead of his voice.\n\nSammy, I may add, did not see the joke any more than Hans had done, but\nthe rest of us appreciated the Mazitu sense of humour very much.\n\n\"It is very well, Mr. Quatermain,\" he said, \"for these black babes and\nsucklings to sit in the seat of the scornful. On such an occasion silent\nprayers would have been of little use, but I am certain that my loud\ncrying to Heaven delivered you all from the bites of the heathen\narrows.\"\n\n\"O Dogeetah and white lords,\" said Babemba, \"the king invites your\npresence that he may ask your forgiveness for what has happened,\nand this time there will be no need for you to bring arms, since\nhenceforward no hurt can come to you from the Mazitu people.\"\n\nSo presently we set out once more, taking with us the gifts that had\nbeen refused. Our march to the royal quarters was a veritable triumphal\nprogress. The people prostrated themselves and clapped their hands\nslowly in salutation as we passed, while the girls and children pelted\nus with flowers as though we were brides going to be married. Our road\nran by the place of execution where the stakes, at which I confess I\nlooked with a shiver, were still standing, though the graves had been\nfilled in.\n\nOn our arrival Bausi and his councillors rose and bowed to us. Indeed,\nthe king did more, for coming forward he seized Brother John by the\nhand, and insisted upon rubbing his ugly black nose against that of this\nrevered guest. This, it appeared, was the Mazitu method of embracing,\nan honour which Brother John did not seem at all to appreciate. Then\nfollowed long speeches, washed down with draughts of thick native beer.\nBausi explained that his evil proceedings were entirely due to the\nwickedness of the deceased Imbozwi and his disciples, under whose\ntyranny the land had groaned for long, since the people believed them to\nspeak \"with the voice of 'Heaven Above.'\"\n\nBrother John, on our behalf, accepted the apology, and then read a\nlecture, or rather preached a sermon, that took exactly twenty-five\nminutes to deliver (he is rather long in the wind), in which he\ndemonstrated the evils of superstition and pointed to a higher and a\nbetter path. Bausi replied that he would like to hear more of that path\nanother time which, as he presumed that we were going to spend the rest\nof our lives in his company, could easily be found--say during the next\nspring when the crops had been sown and the people had leisure on their\nhands.\n\nAfter this we presented our gifts, which now were eagerly accepted. Then\nI took up my parable and explained to Bausi that so far from stopping in\nBeza Town for the rest of our lives, we were anxious to press forward\nat once to Pongo-land. The king's face fell, as did those of his\ncouncillors.\n\n\"Listen, O lord Macumazana, and all of you,\" he said. \"These Pongo are\nhorrible wizards, a great and powerful people who live by themselves\namidst the swamps and mix with none. If the Pongo catch Mazitu or folk\nof any other tribe, either they kill them or take them as prisoners to\ntheir own land where they enslave them, or sometimes sacrifice them to\nthe devils they worship.\"\n\n\"That is so,\" broke in Babemba, \"for when I was a lad I was a slave\nto the Pongo and doomed to be sacrificed to the White Devil. It was in\nescaping from them that I lost this eye.\"\n\nNeedless to say, I made a note of this remark, though I did not think\nthe moment opportune to follow the matter up. If Babemba has once been\nto Pongo-land, I reflected to myself, Babemba can go again or show us\nthe way there.\n\n\"And if we catch any of the Pongo,\" went on Bausi, \"as sometimes we do\nwhen they come to hunt for slaves, we kill them. Ever since the Mazitu\nhave been in this place there has been hate and war between them and\nthe Pongo, and if I could wipe out those evil ones, then I should die\nhappily.\"\n\n\"That you will never do, O King, while the White Devil lives,\" said\nBabemba. \"Have you not heard the Pongo prophecy, that while the White\nDevil lives and the Holy Flower blooms, they will live. But when the\nWhite Devil dies and the Holy Flower ceases to bloom, then their women\nwill become barren and their end will be upon them.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose that this White Devil will die some day,\" I said.\n\n\"Not so, Macumazana. It will never die of itself. Like its wicked\nPriest, it has been there from the beginning and will always be there\nunless it is killed. But who is there that can kill the White Devil?\"\n\nI thought to myself that I would not mind trying, but again I did not\npursue the point.\n\n\"My brother Dogeetah and lords,\" exclaimed Bausi, \"it is not possible\nthat you should visit these wizards except at the head of an army.\nBut how can I send an army with you, seeing that the Mazitu are a land\npeople and have no canoes in which to cross the great lake, and no trees\nwhereof to make them?\"\n\nWe answered that we did not know but would think the matter over, as we\nhad come from our own place for this purpose and meant to carry it out.\n\nThen the audience came to an end, and we returned to our huts, leaving\nDogeetah to converse with his \"brother Bausi\" on matters connected with\nthe latter's health. As I passed Babemba I told him that I should like\nto see him alone, and he said that he would visit me that evening after\nsupper. The rest of the day passed quietly, for we had asked that people\nmight be kept away from our encampment.\n\nWe found Hans, who had not accompanied us, being a little shy of\nappearing in public just then, engaged in cleaning the rifles, and this\nreminded me of something. Taking the double-barrelled gun of which I\nhave spoken, I called Mavovo and handed it to him, saying:\n\n\"It is yours, O true prophet.\"\n\n\"Yes, my father,\" he answered, \"it is mine for a little while, then\nperhaps it will be yours again.\"\n\nThe words struck me, but I did not care to ask their meaning. Somehow I\nwanted to hear no more of Mavovo's prophecies.\n\nThen we dined, and for the rest of that afternoon slept, for all of us,\nincluding Brother John, needed rest badly. In the evening Babemba came,\nand we three white men saw him alone.\n\n\"Tell us about the Pongo and this white devil they worship,\" I said.\n\n\"Macumazana,\" he answered, \"fifty years have gone by since I was in that\nland and I see things that happened to me there as through a mist. I\nwent to fish amongst the reeds when I was a boy of twelve, and tall\nmen robed in white came in a canoe and seized me. They led me to a town\nwhere there were many other such men, and treated me very well, giving\nme sweet things to eat till I grew fat and my skin shone. Then in the\nevening I was taken away, and we marched all night to the mouth of a\ngreat cave. In this cave sat a horrible old man about whom danced robed\npeople, performing the rites of the White Devil.\n\n\"The old man told me that on the following morning I was to be cooked\nand eaten, for which reason I had been made so fat. There was a canoe at\nthe mouth of the cave, beyond which lay water. While all were asleep I\ncrept to the canoe. As I loosed the rope one of the priests woke up and\nran at me. But I hit him on the head with the paddle, for though only a\nboy I was bold and strong, and he fell into the water. He came up again\nand gripped the edge of the canoe, but I struck his fingers with the\npaddle till he let go. A great wind was blowing that night, tearing off\nboughs from the trees which grew upon the other shore of the water. It\nwhirled the canoe round and round and one of the boughs struck me in the\neye. I scarcely felt it at the time, but afterwards the eye withered.\nOr perhaps it was a spear or a knife that struck me in the eye, I do\nnot know. I paddled till I lost my senses and always that wind blew. The\nlast thing that I remember was the sound of the canoe being driven\nby the gale through reeds. When I woke up again I found myself near a\nshore, to which I waded through the mud, scaring great crocodiles. But\nthis must have been some days later, for now I was quite thin. I fell\ndown upon the shore, and there some of our people found me and nursed me\ntill I recovered. That is all.\"\n\n\"And quite enough too,\" I said. \"Now answer me. How far was the town\nfrom the place where you were captured in Mazitu-land?\"\n\n\"A whole day's journey in the canoe, Macumazana. I was captured in the\nmorning early and we reached the harbour in the evening at a place where\nmany canoes were tied up, perhaps fifty of them, some of which would\nhold forty men.\"\n\n\"And how far was the town from this harbour?\"\n\n\"Quite close, Macumazana.\"\n\nNow Brother John asked a question.\n\n\"Did you hear anything about the land beyond the water by the cave?\"\n\n\"Yes, Dogeetah. I heard then, or afterwards--for from time to time\nrumours reach us concerning these Pongo--that it is an island where\ngrows the Holy Flower, of which you know, for when last you were here\nyou had one of its blooms. I heard, too, that this Holy Flower was\ntended by a priestess named Mother of the Flower, and her servants, all\nof whom were virgins.\"\n\n\"Who was the priestess?\"\n\n\"I do not know, but I heave heard that she was one of those people\nwho, although their parents are black, are born white, and that if any\nfemales among the Pongo are born white, or with pink eyes, or deaf and\ndumb, they are set apart to be the servants of the priestess. But this\npriestess must now be dead, seeing that when I was a boy she was already\nold, very, very old, and the Pongo were much concerned because there was\nno one of white skin who could be appointed to succeed her. Indeed she\n_is_ dead, since many years ago there was a great feast in Pongo-land\nand numbers of slaves were eaten, because the priests had found\na beautiful new princess who was white with yellow hair and had\nfinger-nails of the right shape.\"\n\nNow I bethought me that this finding of the priestess named \"Mother\nof the Flower,\" who must be distinguished by certain personal\npeculiarities, resembled not a little that of the finding of the Apis\nbull-god, which also must have certain prescribed and holy markings,\nby the old Egyptians, as narrated by Herodotus. However, I said nothing\nabout it at the time, because Brother John asked sharply:\n\n\"And is this priestess also dead?\"\n\n\"I do not know, Dogeetah, but I think not. If she were dead I think that\nwe should have heard some rumour of the Feast of the eating of the dead\nMother.\"\n\n\"Eating the dead mother!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, Macumazana. It is the law among the Pongo that, for a certain\nsacred reason, the body of the Mother of the Flower, when she dies, must\nbe partaken of by those who are privileged to the holy food.\"\n\n\"But the White Devil neither dies nor is eaten?\" I said.\n\n\"No, as I have told you, he never dies. It is he who causes others to\ndie, as if you go to Pongo-land doubtless you will find out,\" Babemba\nadded grimly.\n\nUpon my word, thought I to myself, as the meeting broke up because\nBabemba had nothing more to say, if I had my way I would leave\nPongo-land and its white devil alone. Then I remembered how Brother John\nstood in reference to this matter, and with a sigh resigned myself to\nfate. As it proved it, I mean Fate, was quite equal to the occasion. The\nvery next morning, early, Babemba turned up again.\n\n\"Lords, lords,\" he said, \"a wonderful thing has happened! Last night we\nspoke of the Pongo and now behold! an embassy from the Pongo is here; it\narrived at sunrise.\"\n\n\"What for?\" I asked.\n\n\"To propose peace between their people and the Mazitu. Yes, they ask\nthat Bausi should send envoys to their town to arrange a lasting peace.\nAs if anyone would go!\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps some might dare to,\" I answered, for an idea occurred to me,\n\"but let us go to see Bausi.\"\n\nHalf an hour later we were seated in the king's enclosure, that is,\nStephen and I were, for Brother John was already in the royal hut,\ntalking to Bausi. As we went a few words had passed between us.\n\n\"Has it occurred to you, John,\" I asked, \"that if you really wish to\nvisit Pongo-land here is perhaps what you would call a providential\nopportunity. Certainly none of these Mazitu will go, since they fear\nlest they should find a permanent peace--inside of the Pongo. Well, you\nare a blood-brother to Bausi and can offer to play the part of Envoy\nExtraordinary, with us as the members of your staff.\"\n\n\"I have already thought of it, Allan,\" he replied, stroking his long\nbeard.\n\nWe sat down among a few of the leading councillors, and presently Bausi\ncame out of his hut accompanied by Brother John, and having greeted us,\nordered the Pongo envoys to be admitted. They were led in at once, tall,\nlight-coloured men with regular and Semitic features, who were clothed\nin white linen like Arabs, and wore circles of gold or copper upon their\nnecks and wrists.\n\nIn short, they were imposing persons, quite different from ordinary\nCentral African natives, though there was something about their\nappearance which chilled and repelled me. I should add that their spears\nhad been left outside, and that they saluted the king by folding their\narms upon their breasts and bowing in a dignified fashion.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Bausi, \"and what do you want?\"\n\n\"I am Komba,\" answered their spokesman, quite a young man with flashing\neyes, \"the Accepted-of-the-Gods, who, in a day to come that perhaps is\nnear, will be the Kalubi of the Pongo people, and these are my servants.\nI have come here bearing gifts of friendship which are without, by the\ndesire of the holy Motombo, the High Priest of the gods----\"\n\n\"I thought that the Kalubi was the priest of your gods,\" interrupted\nBausi.\n\n\"Not so. The Kalubi is the King of the Pongo as you are the King of the\nMazitu. The Motombo, who is seldom seen, is King of the spirits and the\nMouth of the gods.\"\n\nBausi nodded in the African fashion, that is by raising the chin, not\ndepressing it, and Komba went on:\n\n\"I have placed myself in your power, trusting to your honour. You can\nkill me if you wish, though that will avail nothing, since there are\nothers waiting to become Kalubi in my place.\"\n\n\"Am I a Pongo that I should wish to kill messengers and eat them?\" asked\nBausi, with sarcasm, a speech at which I noticed the Pongo envoys winced\na little.\n\n\"King, you are mistaken. The Pongo only eat those whom the White God\nhas chosen. It is a religious rite. Why should they who have cattle in\nplenty desire to devour men?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" grunted Bausi, \"but there is one here who can tell a\ndifferent story,\" and he looked at Babemba, who wriggled uncomfortably.\n\nKomba also looked at him with his fierce eyes.\n\n\"It is not conceivable,\" he said, \"that anybody should wish to eat one\nso old and bony, but let that pass. I thank you, King, for your promise\nof safety. I have come here to ask that you should send envoys to confer\nwith the Kalubi and the Motombo, that a lasting peace may be arranged\nbetween our peoples.\"\n\n\"Why do not the Kalubi and the Motombo come here to confer?\" asked\nBausi.\n\n\"Because it is not lawful that they should leave their land, O King.\nTherefore they have sent me who am the Kalubi-to-come. Hearken. There\nhas been war between us for generations. It began so long ago that only\nthe Motombo knows of its beginning which he has from the gods. Once the\nPongo people owned all this land and only had their sacred places beyond\nthe water. Then your forefathers came and fell on them, killing many,\nenslaving many and taking their women to wife. Now, say the Motombo and\nthe Kalubi, in the place of war let there be peace; where there is but\nbarren sand, there let corn and flowers grow; let the darkness, wherein\nmen lose their way and die, be changed to pleasant light in which they\ncan sit in the sun holding each other's hands.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" I muttered, quite moved by this eloquence. But Bausi was\nnot at all moved; indeed, he seemed to view these poetic proposals with\nthe darkest suspicion.\n\n\"Give up killing our people or capturing them to be sacrificed to your\nWhite Devil, and then in a year or two we may listen to your words that\nare smeared with honey,\" he said. \"As it is, we think that they are\nbut a trap to catch flies. Still, if there are any of our councillors\nwilling to visit your Motombo and your Kalubi and hear what they have to\npropose, taking the risk of whatever may happen to them there, I do not\nforbid it. Now, O my Councillors, speak, not altogether, but one by\none, and be swift, since to the first that speaks shall be given this\nhonour.\"\n\nI think I never heard a denser silence than that which followed this\ninvitation. Each of the _indunas_ looked at his neighbour, but not one\nof them uttered a single word.\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Bausi, in affected surprise. \"Do none speak? Well,\nwell, you are lawyers and men of peace. What says the great general,\nBabemba?\"\n\n\"I say, O King, that I went once to Pongo-land when I was young, taken\nby the hair of my head, to leave an eye there and that I do not wish to\nvisit it again walking on the soles of my feet.\"\n\n\"It seems, O Komba, that since none of my people are willing to act as\nenvoys, if there is to be talk of peace between us, the Motombo and the\nKalubi must come here under safe conduct.\"\n\n\"I have said that cannot be, O King.\"\n\n\"If so, all is finished, O Komba. Rest, eat of our food and return to\nyour own land.\"\n\nThen Brother John rose and said:\n\n\"We are blood-brethren, Bausi, and therefore I can speak for you. If you\nand your councillors are willing, and these Pongos are willing, I and\nmy friends do not fear to visit the Motombo and the Kalubi, to talk with\nthem of peace on behalf of your people, since we love to see new lands\nand new races of mankind. Say, Komba, if the king allows, will you\naccept us as ambassadors?\"\n\n\"It is for the king to name his own ambassadors,\" answered Komba. \"Yet\nthe Kalubi has heard of the presence of you white lords in Mazitu-land\nand bade me say that if it should be your pleasure to accompany the\nembassy and visit him, he would give you welcome. Only when the matter\nwas laid before the Motombo, the oracle spoke thus:\n\n\"'Let the white men come if come they will, or let them stay away. But\nif they come, let them bring with them none of those iron tubes, great\nor small, whereof the land has heard, that vomit smoke with a noise and\ncause death from afar. They will not need them to kill meat, for meat\nshall be given to them in plenty; moreover, among the Pongo they will be\nsafe, unless they offer insult to the god.'\"\n\nThese words Komba spoke very slowly and with much emphasis, his piercing\neyes fixed upon my face as though to read the thoughts it hid. As I\nheard them my courage sank into my boots. Well, I knew that the Kalubi\nwas asking us to Pongo-land that we might kill this Great White Devil\nthat threatened his life, which, I took it, was a monstrous ape. And how\ncould we face that or some other frightful brute without firearms? My\nmind was made up in a minute.\n\n\"O Komba,\" I said, \"my gun is my father, my mother, my wife and all my\nother relatives. I do not stir from here without it.\"\n\n\"Then, white lord,\" answered Komba, \"you will do well to stop in this\nplace in the midst of your family, since, if you try to bring it with\nyou to Pongo-land, you will be killed as you set foot upon the shore.\"\n\nBefore I could find an answer Brother John spoke, saying:\n\n\"It is natural that the great hunter, Macumazana, should not wish to be\nparted from what which to him is as a stick to a lame man. But with me\nit is different. For years I have used no gun, who kill nothing that\nGod made, except a few bright-winged insects. I am ready to visit\nyour country with naught save this in my hand,\" and he pointed to the\nbutterfly net that leaned against the fence behind him.\n\n\"Good, you are welcome,\" said Komba, and I thought that I saw his eyes\ngleam with unholy joy. There followed a pause, during which I explained\neverything to Stephen, showing that the thing was madness. But here, to\nmy horror, that young man's mulish obstinacy came in.\n\n\"I say, you know, Quatermain,\" he said, \"we can't let the old boy go\nalone, or at least I can't. It's another matter for you who have a son\ndependent on you. But putting aside the fact that I mean to get----\"\nhe was about to add, \"the orchid,\" when I nudged him. Of course, it was\nridiculous, but an uneasy fear took me lest this Komba should in some\nmysterious way understand what he was saying. \"What's up? Oh! I see,\nbut the beggar can't understand English. Well, putting aside everything\nelse, it isn't the game, and there you are, you know. If Mr. Brother\nJohn goes, I'll go too, and indeed if he doesn't go, I'll go alone.\"\n\n\"You unutterable young ass,\" I muttered in a stage aside.\n\n\"What is it the young white lord says he wishes in our country?\" asked\nthe cold Komba, who with diabolical acuteness had read some of Stephen's\nmeaning in his face.\n\n\"He says that he is a harmless traveller who would like to study the\nscenery and to find out if you have any gold there,\" I answered.\n\n\"Indeed. Well, he shall study the scenery and we have gold,\" and he\ntouched the bracelets on his arm, \"of which he shall be given as much\nas he can carry away. But perchance, white lords, you would wish to talk\nthis matter over alone. Have we your leave to withdraw a while, O King?\"\n\nFive minutes later we were seated in the king's \"great house\" with Bausi\nhimself and Babemba. Here there was a mighty argument. Bausi implored\nBrother John not to go, and so did I. Babemba said that to go would be\nmadness, as he smelt witchcraft and murder in the air, he who knew the\nPongo.\n\nBrother John replied sweetly that he certainly intended to avail himself\nof this heaven-sent opportunity to visit one of the few remaining\ndistricts in this part of Africa through which he had not yet wandered.\nStephen yawned and fanned himself with a pocket-handkerchief, for the\nhut was hot, and remarked that having come so far after a certain rare\nflower he did not mean to return empty-handed.\n\n\"I perceive, Dogeetah,\" said Bausi at last, \"that you have some reason\nfor this journey which you are hiding from me. Still, I am minded to\nhold you here by force.\"\n\n\"If you do, it will break our brotherhood,\" answered Brother John. \"Seek\nnot to know what I would hide, Bausi, but wait till the future shall\ndeclare it.\"\n\nBausi groaned and gave in. Babemba said that Dogeetah and Wazela were\nbewitched, and that I, Macumazana, alone retained my senses.\n\n\"Then that's settled,\" exclaimed Stephen. \"John and I are to go as\nenvoys to the Pongo, and you, Quatermain, will stop here to look after\nthe hunters and the stores.\"\n\n\"Young man,\" I replied, \"do you wish to insult me? After your father\nput you in my charge, too! If you two are going, I shall come also, if I\nhave to do so mother-naked. But let me tell you once and for all in the\nmost emphatic language I can command, that I consider you a brace of\nconfounded lunatics, and that if the Pongo don't eat you, it will be\nmore than you deserve. To think that at my age I should be dragged among\na lot of cannibal savages without even a pistol, to fight some unknown\nbrute with my bare hands! Well, we can only die once--that is, so far as\nwe know at present.\"\n\n\"How true,\" remarked Stephen; \"how strangely and profoundly true!\"\n\nOh! I could have boxed his ears.\n\nWe went into the courtyard again, whither Komba was summoned with his\nattendants. This time they came bearing gifts, or having them borne\nfor them. These consisted, I remember, of two fine tusks of ivory which\nsuggested to me that their country could not be entirely surrounded by\nwater, since elephants would scarcely live upon an island; gold dust\nin a gourd and copper bracelets, which showed that it was mineralized;\nwhite native linen, very well woven, and some really beautiful decorated\npots, indicating that the people had artistic tastes. Where did they\nget them from, I wonder, and what was the origin of their race? I cannot\nanswer the question, for I never found out with any certainty. Nor do I\nthink they knew themselves.\n\nThe _indaba_ was resumed. Bausi announced that we three white men with\na servant apiece (I stipulated for this) would visit Pongo-land as his\nenvoys, taking no firearms with us, there to discuss terms of peace\nbetween the two peoples, and especially the questions of trade and\nintermarriage. Komba was very insistent that this should be included;\nat the time I wondered why. He, Komba, on behalf of the Motombo and the\nKalubi, the spiritual and temporal rulers of his land, guaranteed\nus safe conduct on the understanding that we attempted no insult or\nviolence to the gods, a stipulation from which there was no escape,\nthough I liked it little. He swore also that we should be delivered safe\nand sound in the Mazitu country within six days of our having left its\nshores.\n\nBausi said that it was good, adding that he would send five hundred\narmed men to escort us to the place where we were to embark, and to\nreceive us on our return; also that if any hurt came to us he would wage\nwar upon the Pongo people for ever until he found means to destroy them.\n\nSo we parted, it being agreed that we were to start upon our journey on\nthe following morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n                              RICA TOWN\n\nAs a matter of fact we did not leave Beza Town till twenty-four hours\nlater than had been arranged, since it took some time for old Babemba,\nwho was to be in charge of it, to collect and provision our escort of\nfive hundred men.\n\nHere, I may mention, that when we got back to our huts we found the two\nMazitu bearers, Tom and Jerry, eating a hearty meal, but looking\nrather tired. It appeared that in order to get rid of their favourable\nevidence, the ceased witch-doctor, Imbozwi, who for some reason or other\nhad feared to kill them, caused them to be marched off to a distant part\nof the land where they were imprisoned. On the arrival of the news of\nthe fall and death of Imbozwi and his subordinates, they were set at\nliberty, and at once returned to us at Beza Town.\n\nOf course it became necessary to explain to our servants what we were\nabout to do. When they understood the nature of our proposed expedition\nthey shook their heads, and when they learned that we had promised to\nleave our guns behind us, they were speechless with amazement.\n\n\"_Kransick! Kransick!_\" which means \"ill in the skull,\" or \"mad,\"\nexclaimed Hans to the others as he tapped his forehead significantly.\n\"They have caught it from Dogeetah, one who lives on insects which he\nentangles in a net, and carries no gun to kill game. Well, I knew they\nwould.\"\n\nThe hunters nodded in assent, and Sammy lifted his arms to Heaven as\nthough in prayer. Only Mavovo seemed indifferent. Then came the question\nof which of them was to accompany us.\n\n\"So far as I am concerned that is soon settled,\" said Mavovo. \"I go with\nmy father, Macumazana, seeing that even without a gun I am still strong\nand can fight as my male ancestors fought with a spear.\"\n\n\"And I, too, go with the Baas Quatermain,\" grunted Hans, \"seeing that\neven without a gun I am cunning, as _my_ female ancestors were before\nme.\"\n\n\"Except when you take medicine, Spotted Snake, and lose yourself in the\nmist of sleep,\" mocked one of the Zulus. \"Does that fine bedstead which\nthe king sent you go with you?\"\n\n\"No, son of a fool!\" answered Hans. \"I'll lend it to you who do not\nunderstand that there is more wisdom within me when I am asleep than\nthere is in you when you are awake.\"\n\nIt remained to be decided who the third man should be. As neither\nof Brother John's two servants, who had accompanied him on his\ncross-country journey, was suitable, one being ill and the other afraid,\nStephen suggested Sammy as the man, chiefly because he could cook.\n\n\"No, Mr. Somers, no,\" said Sammy, with earnestness. \"At this proposal\nI draw the thick rope. To ask one who can cook to visit a land where he\nwill be cooked, is to seethe the offspring in its parent's milk.\"\n\nSo we gave him up, and after some discussion fixed upon Jerry, a smart\nand plucky fellow, who was quite willing to accompany us. The rest of\nthat day we spent in making our preparations which, if simple, required\na good deal of thought. To my annoyance, at the time I wanted to find\nHans to help me, he was not forthcoming. When at length he appeared I\nasked him where he had been. He answered, to cut himself a stick in\nthe forest, as he understood we should have to walk a long way. Also he\nshowed me the stick, a long, thick staff of a hard and beautiful kind of\nbamboo which grows in Mazitu-land.\n\n\"What do you want that clumsy thing for,\" I said, \"when there are plenty\nof sticks about?\"\n\n\"New journey, new stick! Baas. Also this kind of wood is full of air and\nmight help me to float if we are upset into the water.\"\n\n\"What an idea!\" I exclaimed, and dismissed the matter from my mind.\n\nAt dawn, on the following day, we started, Stephen and I riding on the\ntwo donkeys, which were now fat and lusty, and Brother John upon his\nwhite ox, a most docile beast that was quite attached to him. All the\nhunters, fully armed, came with us to the borders of the Mazitu country,\nwhere they were to await our return in company with the Mazitu regiment.\nThe king himself went with us to the west gate of the town, where he\nbade us all, and especially Brother John, an affectionate farewell.\nMoreover, he sent for Komba and his attendants, and again swore to him\nthat if any harm happened to us, he would not rest till he had found a\nway to destroy the Pongo, root and branch.\n\n\"Have no fear,\" answered the cold Komba, \"in our holy town of Rica we do\nnot tie innocent guests to stakes to be shot to death with arrows.\"\n\nThe repartee, which was undoubtedly neat, irritated Bausi, who was not\nfond of allusions to this subject.\n\n\"If the white men are so safe, why do you not let them take their guns\nwith them?\" he asked, somewhat illogically.\n\n\"If we meant evil, King, would their guns help them, they being but few\namong so many. For instance, could we not steal them, as you did when\nyou plotted the murder of these white lords. It is a law among the Pongo\nthat no such magic weapon shall be allowed to enter their land.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, to change the conversation, for I saw that Bausi was\ngrowing very wrath and feared complications.\n\n\"Because, my lord Macumazana, there is a prophecy among us that when a\ngun is fired in Pongo-land, its gods will desert us, and the Motombo,\nwho is their priest, will die. That saying is very old, but until a\nlittle while ago none knew what it meant, since it spoke of 'a hollow\nspear that smoked,' and such a weapon was not known to us.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I said, mourning within myself that we should not be in a\nposition to bring about the fulfilment of that prophecy, which, as Hans\nsaid, shaking his head sadly, \"was a great pity, a very great pity!\"\n\nThree days' march over country that gradually sloped downwards from the\nhigh tableland on which stood Beza Town, brought us to the lake called\nKirua, a word which, I believe, means The Place of the Island. Of the\nlake itself we could see nothing, because of the dense brake of tall\nreeds which grew out into the shallow water for quite a mile from\nthe shore and was only pierced here and there with paths made by the\nhippopotami when they came to the mainland at night to feed. From a high\nmound which looked exactly like a tumulus and, for aught I know, may\nhave been one, however, the blue waters beyond were visible, and in the\nfar distance what, looked at through glasses, appeared to be a tree-clad\nmountain top. I asked Komba what it might be, and he answered that it\nwas the Home of the gods in Pongo-land.\n\n\"What gods?\" I asked again, whereon he replied like a black Herodotus,\nthat of these it was not lawful to speak.\n\nI have rarely met anyone more difficult to pump than that frigid and\nun-African Komba.\n\nOn the top of this mound we planted the Union Jack, fixed to the tallest\npole that we could find. Komba asked suspiciously why we did so, and\nas I was determined to show this unsympathetic person that there were\nothers as unpumpable as himself, I replied that it was the god of our\ntribe, which we set up there to be worshipped, and that anyone who\ntried to insult or injure it, would certainly die, as the witch-doctor,\nImbozwi, and his children had found out. For once Komba seemed a little\nimpressed, and even bowed to the bunting as he passed by.\n\nWhat I did not inform him was that we had set the flag there to be a\nsign and a beacon to us in case we should ever be forced to find our way\nback to this place unguided and in a hurry. As a matter of fact, this\npiece of forethought, which oddly enough originated with the most\nreckless of our party, Stephen, proved our salvation, as I shall tell\nlater on. At the foot of the mound we set our camp for the night, the\nMazitu soldiers under Babemba, who did not mind mosquitoes, making\ntheirs nearer to the lake, just opposite to where a wide hippopotamus\nlane pierced the reeds, leaving a little canal of clear water.\n\nI asked Komba when and how we were to cross the lake. He said that we\nmust start at dawn on the following morning when, at this time of the\nyear, the wind generally blew off shore, and that if the weather were\nfavourable, we should reach the Pongo town of Rica by nightfall. As to\nhow we were to do this, he would show me if I cared to follow him. I\nnodded, and he led me four or five hundred yards along the edge of the\nreeds in a southerly direction.\n\nAs we went, two things happened. The first of these was that a very\nlarge, black rhinoceros, which was sleeping in some bushes, suddenly got\nour wind and, after the fashion of these beasts, charged down on us from\nabout fifty yards away. Now I was carrying a heavy, single-barrelled\nrifle, for as yet we and our weapons were not parted. On came the\nrhinoceros, and Komba, small blame to him for he only had a spear,\nstarted to run. I cocked the rifle and waited my chance.\n\nWhen it was not more than fifteen paces away the rhinoceros threw up its\nhead, at which, of course, it was useless to fire because of the horn,\nand I let drive at the throat. The bullet hit it fair, and I suppose\npenetrated to the heart. At any rate, it rolled over and over like a\nshot rabbit, and with a single stretch of its limbs, expired almost at\nmy feet.\n\nKomba was much impressed. He returned; he stared at the dead rhinoceros\nand at the hole in its throat; he stared at me; he stared at the still\nsmoking rifle.\n\n\"The great beast of the plains killed with a noise!\" he muttered.\n\"Killed in an instant by this little monkey of a white man\" (I thanked\nhim for that and made a note of it) \"and his magic. Oh! the Motombo was\nwise when he commanded----\" and with an effort he stopped.\n\n\"Well, friend, what is the matter?\" I asked. \"You see there was no need\nfor you to run. If you had stepped behind me you would have been as safe\nas you are now--after running.\"\n\n\"It is so, lord Macumazana, but the thing is strange to me. Forgive me\nif I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Oh! I forgive you, my lord Kalubi--that is--to be. It is clear that you\nhave a good deal to learn in Pongo-land.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord Macumazana, and so perhaps have you,\" he replied dryly,\nhaving by this time recovered his nerve and sarcastic powers.\n\nThen after telling Mavovo, who appeared mysteriously at the sound of the\nshot--I think he was stalking us in case of accidents--to fetch men to\ncut up the rhinoceros, Komba and I proceeded on our walk.\n\nA little further on, just by the edge of the reeds, I caught sight of\na narrow, oblong trench dug in a patch of stony soil, and of a rusted\nmustard tin half-hidden by some scanty vegetation.\n\n\"What is that?\" I asked, in seeming astonishment, though I knew well\nwhat it must be.\n\n\"Oh!\" replied Komba, who evidently was not yet quite himself, \"that is\nwhere the white lord Dogeetah, Bausi's blood-brother, set his little\ncanvas house when he was here over twelve moons ago.\"\n\n\"Really!\" I exclaimed, \"he never told me he was here.\" (This was a lie,\nbut somehow I was not afraid of lying to Komba.) \"How do you know that\nhe was here?\"\n\n\"One of our people who was fishing in the reeds saw him.\"\n\n\"Oh! that explains it, Komba. But what an odd place for him to fish in;\nso far from home; and I wonder what he was fishing for. When you have\ntime, Komba, you must explain to me what it is that you catch amidst the\nroots of thick reeds in such shallow water.\"\n\nKomba replied that he would do so with pleasure--when he had time. Then,\nas though to avoid further conversation he ran forward, and thrusting\nthe reeds apart, showed me a great canoe, big enough to hold thirty or\nforty men, which with infinite labour had been hollowed out of the trunk\nof a single, huge tree. This canoe differed from the majority of those\nthat personally I have seen used on African lakes and rivers, in that it\nwas fitted for a mast, now unshipped. I looked at it and said it was a\nfine boat, whereon Komba replied that there were a hundred such at Rica\nTown, though not all of them were so large.\n\nAh! thought I to myself as we walked back to the camp. Then, allowing an\naverage of twenty to a canoe, the Pongo tribe number about two\nthousand males old enough to paddle, an estimate which turned out to be\nsingularly correct.\n\nNext morning at dawn we started, with some difficulty. To begin with,\nin the middle of the night old Babemba came to the canvas shelter under\nwhich I was sleeping, woke me up and in a long speech implored me not to\ngo. He said he was convinced that the Pongo intended foul play of some\nsort and that all this talk of peace was a mere trick to entrap us white\nmen into the country, probably in order to sacrifice us to its gods for\na religious reason.\n\nI answered that I quite agreed with him, but that as my companions\ninsisted upon making this journey, I could not desert them. All that\nI could do was to beg him to keep a sharp look-out so that he might be\nable to help us in case we got into trouble.\n\n\"Here I will stay and watch for you, lord Macumazana,\" he answered, \"but\nif you fall into a snare, am I able to swim through the water like a\nfish, or to fly through the air like a bird to free you?\"\n\nAfter he had gone one of the Zulu hunters arrived, a man named Ganza,\na sort of lieutenant to Mavovo, and sang the same song. He said that\nit was not right that I should go without guns to die among devils and\nleave him and his companions wandering alone in a strange land.\n\nI answered that I was much of the same opinion, but that Dogeetah\ninsisted upon going and that I had no choice.\n\n\"Then let us kill Dogeetah, or at any rate tie him up, so that he can\ndo no more mischief in his madness,\" Ganza suggested blandly, whereon I\nturned him out.\n\nLastly Sammy arrived and said:\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain, before you plunge into this deep well of foolishness,\nI beg that you will consider your responsibilities to God and man, and\nespecially to us, your household, who are now but lost sheep far from\nhome, and further, that you will remember that if anything disagreeable\nshould overtake you, you are indebted to me to the extent of two months'\nwages which will probably prove unrecoverable.\"\n\nI produced a little leather bag from a tin box and counted out to Sammy\nthe wages due to him, also those for three months in advance.\n\nTo my astonishment he began to weep. \"Sir,\" he said, \"I do not seek\nfilthy lucre. What I mean is that I am afraid you will be killed by\nthese Pongo, and, alas! although I love you, sir, I am too great a\ncoward to come and be killed with you, for God made me like that. I pray\nyou not to go, Mr. Quatermain, because I repeat, I love you, sir.\"\n\n\"I believe you do, my good fellow,\" I answered, \"and I also am afraid of\nbeing killed, who only seem to be brave because I must. However, I hope\nwe shall come through all right. Meanwhile, I am going to give this\nbox and all the gold in it, of which there is a great deal, into your\ncharge, Sammy, trusting to you, if anything happens to us, to get it\nsafe back to Durban if you can.\"\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Quatermain,\" he exclaimed, \"I am indeed honoured, especially\nas you know that once I was in jail for--embezzlement--with extenuating\ncircumstances, Mr. Quatermain. I tell you that although I am a coward, I\nwill die before anyone gets his fingers into that box.\"\n\n\"I am sure that you will, Sammy my boy,\" I said. \"But I hope, although\nthings look queer, that none of us will be called upon to die just yet.\"\n\n\n\nThe morning came at last, and the six of us marched down to the canoe\nwhich had been brought round to the open waterway. Here we had to\nundergo a kind of customs-house examination at the hands of Komba\nand his companions, who seemed terrified lest we should be smuggling\nfirearms.\n\n\"You know what rifles are like,\" I said indignantly. \"Can you see any in\nour hands? Moreover, I give you my word that we have none.\"\n\nKomba bowed politely, but suggested that perhaps some \"little guns,\" by\nwhich he meant pistols, remained in our baggage--by accident. Komba was\na most suspicious person.\n\n\"Undo all the loads,\" I said to Hans, who obeyed with an enthusiasm\nwhich I confess struck me as suspicious.\n\nKnowing his secretive and tortuous nature, this sudden zeal for openness\nseemed almost unnatural. He began by unrolling his own blanket, inside\nof which appeared a miscellaneous collection of articles. I remember\namong them a spare pair of very dirty trousers, a battered tin cup, a\nwooden spoon such as Kaffirs use to eat their _scoff_ with, a bottle\nfull of some doubtful compound, sundry roots and other native medicines,\nan old pipe I had given him, and last but not least, a huge head of\nyellow tobacco in the leaf, of a kind that the Mazitu, like the Pongos,\ncultivate to some extent.\n\n\"What on earth do you want so much tobacco for, Hans?\" I asked.\n\n\"For us three black people to smoke, Baas, or to take as snuff, or to\nchew. Perhaps where we are going we may find little to eat, and then\ntobacco is a food on which one can live for days. Also it brings sleep\nat nights.\"\n\n\"Oh! that will do,\" I said, fearing lest Hans, like a second Walter\nRaleigh, was about to deliver a long lecture upon the virtue of tobacco.\n\n\"There is no need for the yellow man to take this weed to our land,\"\ninterrupted Komba, \"for there we have plenty. Why does he cumber himself\nwith the stuff?\" and he stretched out his hand idly as though to take\nhold of and examine it closely.\n\nAt this moment, however, Mavovo called attention to his bundle which\nhe had undone, whether on purpose or by accident, I do not know, and\nforgetting the tobacco, Komba turned to attend to him. With a marvellous\ncelerity Hans rolled up his blanket again. In less than a minute the\nlashings were fast and it was hanging on his back. Again suspicion took\nme, but an argument which had sprung up between Brother John and Komba\nabout the former's butterfly net, which Komba suspected of being a\nnew kind of gun or at least a magical instrument of a dangerous sort,\nattracted my notice. After this dispute, another arose over a common\ngarden trowel that Stephen had thought fit to bring with him. Komba\nasked what it was for. Stephen replied through Brother John that it was\nto dig up flowers.\n\n\"Flowers!\" said Komba. \"One of our gods is a flower. Does the white lord\nwish to dig up our god?\"\n\nOf course this was exactly what Stephen did desire to do, but not\nunnaturally he kept the fact to himself. The squabble grew so hot that\nfinally I announced that if our little belongings were treated with so\nmuch suspicion, it might be better that we should give up the journey\naltogether.\n\n\"We have passed our word that we have no firearms,\" I said in the most\ndignified manner that I could command, \"and that should be enough for\nyou, O Komba.\"\n\nThen Komba, after consultation with his companions, gave way. Evidently\nhe was anxious that we should visit Pongo-land.\n\nSo at last we started. We three white men and our servants seated\nourselves in the stern of the canoe on grass cushions that had been\nprovided. Komba went to the bows and his people, taking the broad\npaddles, rowed and pushed the boat along the water-way made by the\nhippopotami through the tall and matted reeds, from which ducks and\nother fowl rose in multitudes with a sound like thunder. A quarter of an\nhour or so of paddling through these weed-encumbered shallows brought\nus to the deep and open lake. Here, on the edge of the reeds a tall\npole that served as a mast was shipped, and a square sail, made of\nclosely-woven mats, run up. It filled with the morning off-land breeze\nand presently we were bowling along at a rate of quite eight miles\nthe hour. The shore grew dim behind us, but for a long while above the\nclinging mists I could see the flag that we had planted on the mound. By\ndegrees it dwindled till it became a mere speck and vanished. As it grew\nsmaller my spirits sank, and when it was quite gone, I felt very low\nindeed.\n\nAnother of your fool's errands, Allan my boy, I said to myself. I wonder\nhow many more you are destined to survive.\n\nThe others, too, did not seem in the best of spirits. Brother John\nstared at the horizon, his lips moving as though he were engaged in\nprayer, and even Stephen was temporarily depressed. Jerry had fallen\nasleep, as a native generally does when it is warm and he has nothing\nto do. Mavovo looked very thoughtful. I wondered whether he had been\nconsulting his Snake again, but did not ask him. Since the episode of\nour escape from execution by bow and arrow I had grown somewhat afraid\nof that unholy reptile. Next time it might foretell our immediate doom,\nand if it did I knew that I should believe.\n\nAs for Hans, he looked much disturbed, and was engaged in wildly hunting\nfor something in the flap pockets of an antique corduroy waistcoat\nwhich, from its general appearance, must, I imagine, years ago have\nadorned the person of a British game-keeper.\n\n\"Three,\" I heard him mutter. \"By my great grandfather's spirit! only\nthree left.\"\n\n\"Three what?\" I asked in Dutch.\n\n\"Three charms, Baas, and there ought to have been quite twenty-four. The\nrest have fallen out through a hole that the devil himself made in this\nrotten stuff. Now we shall not die of hunger, and we shall not be shot,\nand we shall not be drowned, at least none of those things will happen\nto me. But there are twenty-one other things that may finish us, as I\nhave lost the charms to ward them off. Thus----\"\n\n\"Oh! stop your rubbish,\" I said, and fell again into the depths of my\nuncomfortable reflections. After this I, too, went to sleep. When I woke\nit was past midday and the wind was falling. However, it held while\nwe ate some food we had brought with us, after which it died away\naltogether, and the Pongo people took to their paddles. At my suggestion\nwe offered to help them, for it occurred to me that we might just as\nwell learn how to manage these paddles. So six were given to us, and\nKomba, who now I noted was beginning to speak in a somewhat imperious\ntone, instructed us in their use. At first we made but a poor hand at\nthe business, but three or four hours' steady practice taught us a good\ndeal. Indeed, before our journey's end, I felt that we should be quite\ncapable of managing a canoe, if ever it became necessary for us to do\nso.\n\nBy three in the afternoon the shores of the island we were\napproaching--if it really was an island, a point that I never cleared\nup--were well in sight, the mountain top that stood some miles inland\nhaving been visible for hours. In fact, through my glasses, I had been\nable to make out its configuration almost from the beginning of the\nvoyage. About five we entered the mouth of a deep bay fringed on\neither side with forests, in which were cultivated clearings with small\nvillages of the ordinary African stamp. I observed from the smaller size\nof the trees adjacent to these clearings, that much more land had once\nbeen under cultivation here, probably within the last century, and asked\nKomba why this was so.\n\nHe answered in an enigmatic sentence which impressed me so much that I\nfind I entered it verbatim in my notebook.\n\n\"When man dies, corn dies. Man is corn, and corn is man.\"\n\nUnder this entry I see that I wrote \"Compare the saying, 'Bread is the\nstaff of life.'\"\n\nI could not get any more out of him. Evidently he referred, however, to\na condition of shrinking in the population, a circumstance which he did\nnot care to discuss.\n\nAfter the first few miles the bay narrowed sharply, and at its end came\nto a point where a stream of no great breadth fell into it. On either\nside of this stream that was roughly bridged in many places stood the\ntown of Rica. It consisted of a great number of large huts roofed with\npalm leaves and constructed apparently of whitewashed clay, or rather,\nas we discovered afterwards, of lake mud mixed with chopped straw or\ngrass.\n\nReaching a kind of wharf which was protected from erosion by piles\nformed of small trees driven into the mud, to which were tied a fleet\nof canoes, we landed just as the sun was beginning to sink. Our approach\nhad doubtless been observed, for as we drew near the wharf a horn was\nblown by someone on the shore, whereon a considerable number of men\nappeared. I suppose out of the huts, and assisted to make the canoe\nfast. I noted that these all resembled Komba and his companions in\nbuild and features; they were so like each other that, except for the\ndifference of their ages, it was difficult to tell them apart. They\nmight all have been members of one family; indeed, this was practically\nthe case, owing to constant intermarriage carried on for generations.\n\nThere was something in the appearance of these tall, cold,\nsharp-featured, white-robed men that chilled my blood, something\nunnatural and almost inhuman. Here was nothing of the usual African\njollity. No one shouted, no one laughed or chattered. No one crowded on\nus, trying to handle our persons or clothes. No one appeared afraid\nor even astonished. Except for a word or two they were silent, merely\ncontemplating us in a chilling and distant fashion, as though the\narrival of three white men in a country where before no white man had\never set foot were an everyday occurrence.\n\nMoreover, our personal appearance did not seem to impress them, for\nthey smiled faintly at Brother John's long beard and at my stubbly hair,\npointing these out to each other with their slender fingers or with the\nhandles of their big spears. I remarked that they never used the blade\nof the spear for this purpose, perhaps because they thought that we\nmight take this for a hostile or even a warlike demonstration. It is\nhumiliating to have to add that the only one of our company who seemed\nto move them to wonder or interest was Hans. His extremely ugly and\nwrinkled countenance, it was clear, did appeal to them to some extent,\nperhaps because they had never seen anything in the least like it\nbefore, or perhaps for another reason which the reader may guess in due\ncourse.\n\nAt any rate, I heard one of them, pointing to Hans, ask Komba whether\nthe ape-man was our god or only our captain. The compliment seemed to\nplease Hans, who hitherto had never been looked on either as a god or\na captain. But the rest of us were not flattered; indeed, Mavovo was\nindignant, and told Hans outright that if he heard any more such talk he\nwould beat him before these people, to show them that he was neither a\ncaptain nor a god.\n\n\"Wait till I claim to be either, O butcher of a Zulu, before you\nthreaten to treat me thus!\" ejaculated Hans, indignantly. Then he added,\nwith his peculiar Hottentot snigger, \"Still, it is true that before all\nthe meat is eaten (i.e. before all is done) you may think me both,\" a\ndark saying which at the time we did not understand.\n\nWhen we had landed and collected our belongings, Komba told us to follow\nhim, and led us up a wide street that was very tidily kept and bordered\non either side by the large huts whereof I have spoken. Each of these\nhuts stood in a fenced garden of its own, a thing I have rarely seen\nelsewhere in Africa. The result of this arrangement was that although as\na matter of fact it had but a comparatively small population, the area\ncovered by Rica was very great. The town, by the way, was not surrounded\nwith any wall or other fortification, which showed that the inhabitants\nfeared no attack. The waters of the lake were their defence.\n\nFor the rest, the chief characteristic of this place was the silence\nthat brooded there. Apparently they kept no dogs, for none barked, and\nno poultry, for I never heard a cock crow in Pongo-land. Cattle and\nnative sheep they had in abundance, but as they did not fear any enemy,\nthese were pastured outside the town, their milk and meat being brought\nin as required. A considerable number of people were gathered to\nobserve us, not in a crowd, but in little family groups which collected\nseparately at the gates of the gardens.\n\nFor the most part these consisted of a man and one or more wives, finely\nformed and handsome women. Sometimes they had children with them, but\nthese were very few; the most I saw with any one family was three, and\nmany seemed to possess none at all. Both the women and the children,\nlike the men, were decently clothed in long, white garments, another\npeculiarity which showed that these natives were no ordinary African\nsavages.\n\nOh! I can see Rica Town now after all these many years: the wide street\nswept and garnished, the brown-roofed, white-walled huts in their\nfertile, irrigated gardens, the tall, silent folk, the smoke from the\ncooking fires rising straight as a line in the still air, the graceful\npalms and other tropical trees, and at the head of the street, far away\nto the north, the rounded, towering shape of the forest-clad mountain\nthat was called House of the Gods. Often that vision comes back to me in\nmy sleep, or at times in my waking hours when some heavy odour reminds\nme of the overpowering scent of the great trumpet-like blooms which hung\nin profusion upon broad-leaved bushes that were planted in almost every\ngarden.\n\nOn we marched till at last we reached a tall, live fence that was\ncovered with brilliant scarlet flowers, arriving at its gate just as the\nlast red glow of day faded from the sky and night began to fall. Komba\npushed open the gate, revealing a scene that none of us are likely to\nforget. The fence enclosed about an acre of ground of which the back\npart was occupied by two large huts standing in the usual gardens.\n\nIn front of these, not more than fifteen paces from the gate, stood\nanother building of a totally different character. It was about fifty\nfeet in length by thirty broad and consisted only of a roof supported\nupon carved pillars of wood, the spaces between the pillars being filled\nwith grass mats or blinds. Most of these blinds were pulled down, but\nfour exactly opposite the gate were open. Inside the shed forty or fifty\nmen, who wore white robes and peculiar caps and who were engaged in\nchanting a dreadful, melancholy song, were gathered on three sides of a\nhuge fire that burned in a pit in the ground. On the fourth side, that\nfacing the gate, a man stood alone with his arms outstretched and his\nback towards us.\n\nOf a sudden he heard our footsteps and turned round, springing to the\nleft, so that the light might fall on us. Now we saw by the glow of the\ngreat fire, that over it was an iron grid not unlike a small bedstead,\nand that on this grid lay some fearful object. Stephen, who was a little\nahead, stared, then exclaimed in a horrified voice:\n\n\"My God! it is a woman!\"\n\nIn another second the blinds fell down, hiding everything, and the\nsinging ceased.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n                          THE KALUBI'S OATH\n\n\"Be silent!\" I whispered, and all understood my tone if they did not\ncatch the words. Then steadying myself with an effort, for this hideous\nvision, which might have been a picture from hell, made me feel faint, I\nglanced at Komba, who was a pace or two in front of us. Evidently he was\nmuch disturbed--the motions of his back told me this--by the sense of\nsome terrible mistake that he had made. For a moment he stood still,\nthen wheeled round and asked me if we had seen anything.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered indifferently, \"we saw a number of men gathered round\na fire, nothing more.\"\n\nHe tried to search our faces, but luckily the great moon, now almost\nat her full, was hidden behind a thick cloud, so that he could not read\nthem well. I heard him sigh in relief as he said:\n\n\"The Kalubi and the head men are cooking a sheep; it is their custom to\nfeast together on those nights when the moon is about to change. Follow\nme, white lords.\"\n\nThen he led us round the end of the long shed at which we did not even\nlook, and through the garden on its farther side to the two fine huts I\nhave mentioned. Here he clapped his hands and a woman appeared, I know\nnot whence. To her he whispered something. She went away and presently\nreturned with four or five other women who carried clay lamps filled\nwith oil in which floated a wick of palm fibre. These lamps were set\ndown in the huts that proved to be very clean and comfortable places,\nfurnished after a fashion with wooden stools and a kind of low table of\nwhich the legs were carved to the shape of antelope's feet. Also there\nwas a wooden platform at the end of the hut whereon lay beds covered\nwith mats and stuffed with some soft fibre.\n\n\"Here you may rest safe,\" he said, \"for, white lords, are you not the\nhonoured guests of the Pongo people? Presently food\" (I shuddered at the\nword) \"will be brought to you, and after you have eaten well, if it is\nyour pleasure, the Kalubi and his councillors will receive you in yonder\nfeast-house and you can talk with them before you sleep. If you need\naught, strike upon that jar with a stick,\" and he pointed to what looked\nlike a copper cauldron that stood in the garden of the hut near the\nplace where the women were already lighting a fire, \"and some will wait\non you. Look, here are your goods; none are missing, and here comes\nwater in which you may wash. Now I must go to make report to the\nKalubi,\" and with a courteous bow he departed.\n\nSo after a while did the silent, handsome women--to fetch our meal, I\nunderstood one of them to say, and at length we were alone.\n\n\"My aunt!\" said Stephen, fanning himself with his pocket-handkerchief,\n\"did you see that lady toasting? I have often heard of cannibals, those\nslaves, for instance, but the actual business! Oh! my aunt!\"\n\n\"It is no use addressing your absent aunt--if you have got one. What did\nyou expect if you would insist on coming to a hell like this?\" I asked\ngloomily.\n\n\"Can't say, old fellow. Don't trouble myself much with expectations as\na rule. That's why I and my poor old father never could get on. I always\nquoted the text 'Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof' to him,\nuntil at length he sent for the family Bible and ruled it out with red\nink in a rage. But I say, do you think that we shall be called upon to\nunderstudy St. Lawrence on that grid?\"\n\n\"Certainly, I do,\" I replied, \"and, as old Babemba warned you, you can't\ncomplain.\"\n\n\"Oh! but I will and I can. And so will you, won't you, Brother John?\"\n\nBrother John woke up from a reverie and stroked his long beard.\n\n\"Since you ask me, Mr. Somers,\" he said, reflectively, \"if it were a\ncase of martyrdom for the Faith, like that of the saint to whom you have\nalluded, I should not object--at any rate in theory. But I confess that,\nspeaking from a secular point of view, I have the strongest dislike to\nbeing cooked and eaten by these very disagreeable savages. Still, I\nsee no reason to suppose that we shall fall victims to their domestic\ncustoms.\"\n\nI, being in a depressed mood, was about to argue to the contrary, when\nHans poked his head into the hut and said:\n\n\"Dinner coming, Baas, very fine dinner!\"\n\nSo we went out into the garden where the tall, impassive ladies were\narranging many wooden dishes on the ground. Now the moon was clear of\nclouds, and by its brilliant light we examined their contents. Some\nwere cooked meat covered with a kind of sauce that made its nature\nindistinguishable. As a matter of fact, I believe it was mutton,\nbut--who could say? Others were evidently of a vegetable nature. For\ninstance, there was a whole platter full of roasted mealie cobs and\na great boiled pumpkin, to say nothing of some bowls of curdled milk.\nRegarding this feast I became aware of a sudden and complete conversion\nto those principles of vegetarianism which Brother John was always\npreaching to me.\n\n\"I am sure you are quite right,\" I said to him, nervously, \"in holding\nthat vegetables are the best diet in a hot climate. At any rate I have\nmade up my mind to try the experiment for a few days,\" and throwing\nmanners to the winds, I grabbed four of the upper mealie cobs and the\ntop of the pumpkin which I cut off with a knife. Somehow I did not seem\nto fancy that portion of it which touched the platter, for who knew what\nthose dishes might have contained and how often they were washed.\n\nStephen also appeared to have found salvation on this point, for he,\ntoo, patronized the mealie cobs and the pumpkin; so did Mavovo, and so\ndid even that inveterate meat-eater, Hans. Only the simple Jerry tackled\nthe fleshpots of Egypt, or rather of Pongo-land, with appetite, and\ndeclared that they were good. I think that he, being the last of us\nthrough the gateway, had not realized what it was which lay upon the\ngrid.\n\nAt length we finished our simple meal--when you are very hungry it takes\na long time to fill oneself with squashy pumpkin, which is why I suppose\nruminants and other grazing animals always seem to be eating--and washed\nit down with water in preference to the sticky-looking milk which we\nleft to the natives.\n\n\"Allan,\" said Brother John to me in a low voice as we lit our pipes,\n\"that man who stood with his back to us in front of the gridiron was the\nKalubi. Against the firelight I saw the gap in his hand where I cut away\nthe finger.\"\n\n\"Well, if we want to get any further, you must cultivate him,\" I\nanswered. \"But the question is, shall we get further than--that grid? I\nbelieve we have been trapped here to be eaten.\"\n\nBefore Brother John could reply, Komba arrived, and after inquiring\nwhether our appetites had been good, intimated that the Kalubi and\nhead men were ready to receive us. So off we went with the exception of\nJerry, whom we left to watch our things, taking with us the presents we\nhad prepared.\n\nKomba led us to the feast-house, where the fire in the pit was out,\nor had been covered over, and the grid and its horrible burden had\ndisappeared. Also now all the mats were rolled up, so that the clear\nmoonlight flowed into and illuminated the place. Seated in a semicircle\non wooden stools with their faces towards the gateway were the Kalubi,\nwho occupied the centre, and eight councillors, all of them grey-haired\nmen. This Kalubi was a tall, thin individual of middle age with, I\nthink, the most nervous countenance that I ever saw. His features\ntwitched continually and his hands were never still. The eyes, too, as\nfar as I could see them in that light, were full of terrors.\n\nHe rose and bowed, but the councillors remained seated, greeting us with\na long-continued and soft clapping of the hands, which, it seemed, was\nthe Pongo method of salute.\n\nWe bowed in answer, then seated ourselves on three stools that had been\nplaced for us, Brother John occupying the middle stool. Mavovo and Hans\nstood behind us, the latter supporting himself with his large bamboo\nstick. As soon as these preliminaries were over the Kalubi\ncalled upon Komba, whom he addressed in formal language as\n\"You-who-have-passed-the-god,\" and \"You-the-Kalubi-to-be\" (I thought I\nsaw him wince as he said these words), to give an account of his mission\nand of how it came about that they had the honour of seeing the white\nlords there.\n\nKomba obeyed. After addressing the Kalubi with every possible title\nof honour, such as \"Absolute Monarch,\" \"Master whose feet I kiss,\"\n\"He whose eyes are fire and whose tongue is a sword,\" \"He at whose nod\npeople die,\" \"Lord of the Sacrifice, first Taster of the Sacred meat,\"\n\"Beloved of the gods\" (here the Kalubi shrank as though he had been\npricked with a spear), \"Second to none on earth save the Motombo the\nmost holy, the most ancient, who comes from heaven and speaks with the\nvoice of heaven,\" etc., etc., he gave a clear but brief account of all\nthat had happened in the course of his mission to Beza Town.\n\nEspecially did he narrate how, in obedience to a message which he had\nreceived from the Motombo, he had invited the white lords to Pongo-land,\nand even accepted them as envoys from the Mazitu when none would respond\nto King Bausi's invitation to fill that office. Only he had stipulated\nthat they should bring with them none of their magic weapons which\nvomited out smoke and death, as the Motombo had commanded. At this\ninformation the expressive countenance of the Kalubi once more betrayed\nmental disturbance that I think Komba noted as much as we did. However,\nhe said nothing, and after a pause, Komba went on to explain that no\nsuch weapons had been brought, since, not satisfied with our word that\nthis was so, he and his companions had searched our baggage before we\nleft Mazitu-land.\n\nTherefore, he added, there was no cause to fear that we should bring\nabout the fulfilment of the old prophecy that when a gun was fired among\nthe Pongo the gods would desert the land and the people cease to be a\npeople.\n\nHaving finished his speech, he sat down in a humble place behind us.\nThen the Kalubi, after formally accepting us as ambassadors from Bausi,\nKing of the Mazitu, discoursed at length upon the advantages which would\nresult to both peoples from a lasting peace between them. Finally he\npropounded the articles of such a peace. These, it was clear, had been\ncarefully prepared, but to set them out would be useless, since they\nnever came to anything, and I doubt whether it was intended that they\nshould. Suffice it to say that they provided for intermarriage, free\ntrade between the countries, blood-brotherhood, and other things that\nI have forgotten, all of which was to be ratified by Bausi taking a\ndaughter of the Kalubi to wife, and the Kalubi taking a daughter of\nBausi.\n\nWe listened in silence, and when he had finished, after a pretended\nconsultation between us, I spoke as the Mouth of Brother John, who,\nI explained, was too grand a person to talk himself, saying that the\nproposals seemed fair and reasonable, and that we should be happy to\nsubmit them to Bausi and his council on our return.\n\nThe Kalubi expressed great satisfaction at this statement, but remarked\nincidentally that first of all the whole matter must be laid before the\nMotombo for his opinion, without which no State transaction had legal\nweight among the Pongo. He added that with our approval he proposed that\nwe should visit his Holiness on the morrow, starting when the sun was\nthree hours old, as he lived at a distance of a day's journey from Rica.\nAfter further consultation we replied that although we had little time\nto spare, as we understood that the Motombo was old and could not\nvisit us, we, the white lords, would stretch a point and call on him.\nMeanwhile we were tired and wished to go to bed. Then we presented our\ngifts, which were gracefully accepted, with an intimation that return\npresents would be made to us before we left Pongo-land.\n\nAfter this the Kalubi took a little stick and broke it, to intimate that\nthe conference was at an end, and having bade him and his councillors\ngood night we retired to our huts.\n\nI should add, because it has a bearing on subsequent events, that\non this occasion we were escorted, not by Komba, but by two of the\ncouncillors. Komba, as I noted for the first time when we rose to say\ngood-bye, was no longer present at the council. When he left it I cannot\nsay, since it will be remembered that his seat was behind us in the\nshadow, and none of us saw him go.\n\n\n\n\"What do you make of all that?\" I asked the others when the door was\nshut.\n\nBrother John merely shook his head and said nothing, for in those days\nhe seemed to be living in a kind of dreamland.\n\nStephen answered. \"Bosh! Tommy rot! All my eye and my elbow! Those\nman-eating Johnnies have some game up their wide sleeves, and whatever\nit may be, it isn't peace with the Mazitu.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" I said. \"If the real object were peace they would have\nhaggled more, stood out for better terms, or hostages, or something.\nAlso they would have got the consent of this Motombo beforehand. Clearly\nhe is the master of the situation, not the Kalubi, who is only his tool;\nif business were meant he should have spoken first, always supposing\nthat he exists and isn't a myth. However, if we live we shall learn, and\nif we don't, it doesn't matter, though personally I think we should be\nwise to leave Motombo alone and to clear out to Mazitu-land by the first\ncanoe to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"I intend to visit this Motombo,\" broke in Brother John with decision.\n\n\"Ditto, ditto,\" exclaimed Stephen, \"but it's no use arguing that all\nover again.\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied with irritation. \"It is, as you remark, of no use\narguing with lunatics. So let's go to bed, and as it will probably be\nour last, have a good night's sleep.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said Stephen, taking off his coat and placing it doubled\nup on the bed to serve as a pillow. \"I say,\" he added, \"stand clear a\nminute while I shake this blanket. It's covered with bits of something,\"\nand he suited the action to the word.\n\n\"Bits of something?\" I said suspiciously. \"Why didn't you wait a minute\nto let me see them. I didn't notice any bits before.\"\n\n\"Rats running about the roof, I expect,\" said Stephen carelessly.\n\nNot being satisfied, I began to examine this roof and the clay walls,\nwhich I forgot to mention were painted over in a kind of pattern with\nwhorls in it, by the feeble light of the primitive lamps. While I was\nthus engaged there was a knock on the door. Forgetting all about the\ndust, I opened it and Hans appeared.\n\n\"One of these man-eating devils wants to speak to you, Baas. Mavovo\nkeeps him without.\"\n\n\"Let him in,\" I said, since in this place fearlessness seemed our best\ngame, \"but watch well while he is with us.\"\n\nHans whispered a word over his shoulder, and next moment a tall man\nwrapped from head to foot in white cloth, so that he looked like a\nghost, came or rather shot into the hut and closed the door behind him.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.\n\nBy way of answer he lifted or unwrapped the cloth from about his face,\nand I saw that the Kalubi himself stood before us.\n\n\"I wish to speak alone with the white lord, Dogeetah,\" he said in\na hoarse voice, \"and it must be now, since afterwards it will be\nimpossible.\"\n\nBrother John rose and looked at him.\n\n\"How are you, Kalubi, my friend?\" he asked. \"I see that your wound has\nhealed well.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but I would speak with you alone.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" replied Brother John. \"If you have anything to say, you must\nsay it to all of us, or leave it unsaid, since these lords and I are\none, and that which I hear, they hear.\"\n\n\"Can I trust them?\" muttered the Kalubi.\n\n\"As you can trust me. Therefore speak, or go. Yet, first, can we be\noverheard in this hut?\"\n\n\"No, Dogeetah. The walls are thick. There is no one on the roof, for I\nhave looked all round, and if any strove to climb there, we should hear.\nAlso your men who watch the door would see him. None can hear us save\nperhaps the gods.\"\n\n\"Then we will risk the gods, Kalubi. Go on; my brothers know your\nstory.\"\n\n\"My lords,\" he began, rolling his eyes about him like a hunted creature,\n\"I am in a terrible pass. Once, since I saw you, Dogeetah, I should have\nvisited the White God that dwells in the forest on the mountain yonder,\nto scatter the sacred seed. But I feigned to be sick, and Komba, the\nKalubi-to-be, 'who has passed the god,' went in my place and returned\nunharmed. Now to-morrow, the night of the full moon, as Kalubi, I must\nvisit the god again and once more scatter the seed and--Dogeetah, he\nwill kill me whom he has once bitten. He will certainly kill me unless\nI can kill him. Then Komba will rule as Kalubi in my stead, and he will\nkill you in a way you can guess, by the 'Hot death,' as a sacrifice to\nthe gods, that the women of the Pongo may once more become the mothers\nof many children. Yes, yes, unless we can kill the god who dwells in\nthe forest, we all must die,\" and he paused, trembling, while the sweat\ndropped from him to the floor.\n\n\"That's pleasant,\" said Brother John, \"but supposing that we kill the\ngod how would that help us or you to escape from the Motombo and these\nmurdering people of yours? Surely they would slay us for the sacrilege.\"\n\n\"Not so, Dogeetah. If the god dies, the Motombo dies. It is known from\nof old, and therefore the Motombo watches over the god as a mother over\nher child. Then, until a new god is found, the Mother of the Holy Flower\nrules, she who is merciful and will harm none, and I rule under her and\nwill certainly put my enemies to death, especially that wizard Komba.\"\n\nHere I thought I heard a faint sound in the air like the hiss of a\nsnake, but as it was not repeated and I could see nothing, concluded\nthat I was mistaken.\n\n\"Moreover,\" he went on, \"I will load you with gold dust and any gifts\nyou may desire, and set you safe across the water among your friends,\nthe Mazitu.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" I broke in, \"let us understand matters clearly, and, John,\ndo you translate to Stephen. Now, friend Kalubi, first of all, who and\nwhat is this god you talk of?\"\n\n\"Lord Macumazana, he is a huge ape white with age, or born white, I know\nnot which. He is twice as big as any man, and stronger than twenty men,\nwhom he can break in his hands, as I break a reed, or whose heads he can\nbite off in his mouth, as he bit off my finger for a warning. For that\nis how he treats the Kalubis when he wearies of them. First he bites off\na finger and lets them go, and next he breaks them like a reed, as also\nhe breaks those who are doomed to sacrifice before the fire.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I said, \"a great ape! I thought as much. Well, and how long has\nthis brute been a god among you?\"\n\n\"I do not know how long. From the beginning. He was always there, as the\nMotombo was always there, for they are one.\"\n\n\"That's a lie any way,\" I said in English, then went on. \"And who is\nthis Mother of the Holy Flower? Is she also always there, and does she\nlive in the same place as the ape god?\"\n\n\"Not so, lord Macumazana. She dies like other mortals, and is succeeded\nby one who takes her place. Thus the present Mother is a white woman of\nyour race, now of middle age. When she dies she will be succeeded by her\ndaughter, who also is a white woman and very beautiful. After she dies\nanother who is white will be found, perhaps one who is of black parents\nbut born white.\"\n\n\"How old is this daughter?\" interrupted Brother John in a curiously\nintent voice, \"and who is her father?\"\n\n\"The daughter was born over twenty years ago, Dogeetah, after the Mother\nof the Flower was captured and brought here. She says that the father\nwas a white man to whom she was married, but who is dead.\"\n\nBrother John's head dropped upon his chest, and his eyes shut as though\nhe had gone to sleep.\n\n\"As for where the Mother lives,\" went on the Kalubi, \"it is on the\nisland in the lake at the top of the mountain that is surrounded by\nwater. She has nothing to do with the White God, but those women who\nserve her go across the lake at times to tend the fields where grows the\nseed that the Kalubi sows, of which the corn is the White God's food.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said, \"now we understand--not much, but a little. Tell us next\nwhat is your plan? How are we to come into the place where this great\nape lives? And if we come there, how are we to kill the beast, seeing\nthat your successor, Komba, was careful to prevent us from bringing our\nfirearms to your land?\"\n\n\"Aye, lord Macumazana, may the teeth of the god meet in his brain for\nthat trick; yes, may he die as I know how to make him die. That prophecy\nof which he told you is no prophecy from of old. It arose in the land\nwithin the last moon only, though whether it came from Komba or from\nthe Motombo I know not. None save myself, or at least very few here, had\nheard of the iron tubes that throw out death, so how should there be a\nprophecy concerning them?\"\n\n\"I am sure I don't know, Kalubi, but answer the rest of the question.\"\n\n\"As to your coming into the forest--for the White God lives in a forest\non the slopes of the mountain, lords--that will be easy since the\nMotombo and the people will believe that I am trapping you there to be a\nsacrifice, such as they desire for sundry reasons,\" and he looked at the\nplump Stephen in a very suggestive way. \"As to how you are to kill the\ngod without your tubes of iron, that I do not know. But you are very\nbrave and great magicians. Surely you can find a way.\"\n\nHere Brother John seemed to wake up again.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"we shall find a way. Have no fear of that, O Kalubi. We\nare not afraid of the big ape whom you call a god. Yet it must be at a\nprice. We will not kill this beast and try to save your life, save at a\nprice.\"\n\n\"What price?\" asked the Kalubi nervously. \"There are wives and\ncattle--no, you do not want the wives, and the cattle cannot be taken\nacross the lake. There are gold dust and ivory. I have already promised\nthese, and there is nothing more that I can give.\"\n\n\"The price is, O Kalubi, that you hand over to us to be taken away\nthe white woman who is called Mother of the Holy Flower, with her\ndaughter----\"\n\n\"And,\" interrupted Stephen, to whom I had been interpreting, \"the Holy\nFlower itself, all of it dug up by the roots.\"\n\nWhen he heard these modest requests the poor Kalubi became like one upon\nthe verge of madness.\n\n\"Do you understand,\" he gasped, \"do you understand that you are asking\nfor the gods of my country?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" replied Brother John with calmness; \"for the gods of your\ncountry--nothing more nor less.\"\n\nThe Kalubi made as though he would fly from the hut, but I caught him by\nthe arm and said:\n\n\"See, friend, things are thus. You ask us, at great danger to ourselves,\nto kill one of the gods of your country, the highest of them, in order\nto save your life. Well, in payment we ask you to make a present of the\nremaining gods of your country, and to see us and them safe across the\nlake. Do you accept or refuse?\"\n\n\"I refuse,\" answered the Kalubi sullenly. \"To accept would mean the last\ncurse upon my spirit; that is too horrible to tell.\"\n\n\"And to refuse means the first curse upon your body; namely, that in a\nfew hours it must be broken and chewed by a great monkey which you call\na god. Yes, broken and chewed, and afterwards, I think, cooked and eaten\nas a sacrifice. Is it not so?\"\n\nThe Kalubi nodded his head and groaned.\n\n\"Yet,\" I went on, \"for our part we are glad that you have refused, since\nnow we shall be rid of a troublesome and dangerous business and return\nin safety to Mazitu land.\"\n\n\"How will you return in safety, O lord Macumazana, you who are doomed to\nthe 'Hot Death' if you escape the fangs of the god?\"\n\n\"Very easily, O Kalubi, by telling Komba, the Kalubi-to-be, of your\nplots against this god of yours, and how we have refused to listen to\nyour wickedness. In fact, I think this may be done at once while you are\nhere with us, O Kalubi, where perhaps you do not expect to be found.\nI will go strike upon the pot without the door; doubtless though it is\nlate, some will hear. Nay, man, stand you still; we have knives and our\nservants have spears,\" and I made as though to pass him.\n\n\"Lord,\" he said, \"I will give you the Mother of the Holy Flower and her\ndaughter; aye, and the Holy Flower itself dug up by the roots, and I\nswear that if I can, I will set you and them safe across the lake, only\nasking that I may come with you, since here I dare not stay. Yet the\ncurse will come too, but if so, it is better to die of a curse in a day\nto be, than to-morrow at the fangs of the god. Oh! why was I born! Why\nwas I born!\" and he began to weep.\n\n\"That is a question many have asked and none have been able to answer, O\nfriend Kalubi, though mayhap there is an answer somewhere,\" I replied in\na kind voice.\n\nFor my heart was stirred with pity of this poor wretch mazed and lost in\nhis hell of superstition; this potentate who could not escape from the\ntrappings of a hateful power, save by the door of a death too horrible\nto contemplate; this priest whose doom it was to be slain by the very\nhands of his god, as those who went before him had been slain, and as\nthose who came after him would be slain.\n\n\"Yet,\" I went on, \"I think you have chosen wisely, and we hold you to\nyour word. While you are faithful to us, we will say nothing. But\nof this be sure--that if you attempt to betray us, we who are not so\nhelpless as we seem, will betray you, and it shall be you who die, not\nus. Is it a bargain?\"\n\n\"It is a bargain, white lord, although blame me not if things go wrong,\nsince the gods know all, and they are devils who delight in human woe\nand mock at bargains and torment those who would injure them. Yet, come\nwhat will, I swear to keep faith with you thus, by the oath that may not\nbe broken,\" and drawing a knife from his girdle, he thrust out the tip\nof his tongue and pricked it. From the puncture a drop of blood fell to\nthe floor.\n\n\"If I break my oath,\" he said, \"may my flesh grow cold as that blood\ngrows cold, and may it rot as that blood rots! Aye, and may my spirit\nwaste and be lost in the world of ghosts as that blood wastes into the\nair and is lost in the dust of the world!\"\n\nIt was a horrible scene and one that impressed me very much, especially\nas even then there fell upon me a conviction that this unfortunate man\nwas doomed, that a fate which he could not escape was upon him.\n\nWe said nothing, and in another moment he had thrown his white wrappings\nover his face and slipped through the door.\n\n\"I am afraid we are playing it rather low down on that jumpy old boy,\"\nsaid Stephen remorsefully.\n\n\"The white woman, the white woman and her daughter,\" muttered Brother\nJohn.\n\n\"Yes,\" reflected Stephen aloud. \"One is justified in doing anything to\nget two white women out of this hell, if they exist. So one may as well\nhave the orchid also, for they'd be lonely without it, poor things,\nwouldn't they? Glad I thought of that, it's soothing to the conscience.\"\n\n\"I hope you'll find it so when we are all on that iron grid which I\nnoticed is wide enough for three,\" I remarked sarcastically. \"Now be\nquiet, I want to go to sleep.\"\n\nI am sorry to have to add that for the most of that night Want remained\nmy master. But if I couldn't sleep, I could, or rather was obliged to,\nthink, and I thought very hard indeed.\n\nFirst I reflected on the Pongo and their gods. What were these and why\ndid they worship them? Soon I gave it up, remembering that the problem\nwas one which applied equally to dozens of the dark religions of this\nvast African continent, to which none could give an answer, and least\nof all their votaries. That answer indeed must be sought in the horrible\nfears of the unenlightened human heart, which sees death and terror\nand evil around it everywhere and, in this grotesque form or in that,\npersonifies them in gods, or rather in devils who must be propitiated.\nFor always the fetish or the beast, or whatever it may be, is not\nthe real object of worship. It is only the thing or creature which is\ninhabited by the spirit of the god or devil, the temple, as it were,\nthat furnishes it with a home, which temple is therefore holy. And these\nspirits are diverse, representing sundry attributes or qualities.\n\nThus the great ape might be Satan, a prince of evil and blood. The Holy\nFlower might symbolise fertility and the growth of the food of man from\nthe bosom of the earth. The Mother of the Flower might represent mercy\nand goodness, for which reason it was necessary that she should be\nwhite in colour, and dwell, not in the shadowed forest, but on a soaring\nmountain, a figure of light, in short, as opposed to darkness. Or she\nmight be a kind of African Ceres, a goddess of the corn and harvest\nwhich were symbolised in the beauteous bloom she tended. Who could tell?\nNot I, either then or afterwards, for I never found out.\n\nAs for the Pongo themselves, their case was obvious. They were a dying\ntribe, the last descendants of some higher race, grown barren from\nintermarriage. Probably, too, they were at first only cannibals\noccasionally and from religious reasons. Then in some time of dearth\nthey became very religious in that respect, and the habit overpowered\nthem. Among cannibals, at any rate in Africa, as I knew, this dreadful\nfood is much preferred to any other meat. I had not the slightest doubt\nthat although the Kalubi himself had brought us here in the wild\nhope that we might save him from a terrible death at the hands of the\nBeelzebub he served, Komba and the councillors, inspired thereto by the\nprophet called Motombo, designed that we should be murdered and eaten as\nan offering to the gods. How we were to escape this fate, being unarmed,\nI could not imagine, unless some special protection were vouchsafed to\nus. Meanwhile, we must go on to the end, whatever it might be.\n\nBrother John, or to give him his right name, the Reverend John Eversley,\nwas convinced that the white woman imprisoned in the mountain was none\nother than the lost wife for whom he had searched for twenty weary\nyears, and that the second white woman of whom we had heard that night\nwas, strange as it might seem, her daughter and his own. Perhaps he\nwas right and perhaps he was wrong. But even in the latter case, if two\nwhite persons were really languishing in this dreadful land, our path\nwas clear. We must go on in faith until we saved them or until we died.\n\n \"Our life is granted, not in Pleasure's round,\n    Or even Love's sweet dream, to lapse, content;\n  Duty and Faith are words of solemn sound,\n    And to their echoes must the soul be bent,\"\n\nas some one or other once wrote, very nobly I think. Well, there was but\nlittle of \"Pleasure's round\" about the present entertainment, and any\nhope of \"Love's sweet dream\" seemed to be limited to Brother John (here\nI was quite mistaken, as I so often am). Probably the \"echoes\" would be\nmy share; indeed, already I seemed to hear their ominous thunder.\n\nAt last I did go to sleep and dreamed a very curious dream. It seemed to\nme that I was disembodied, although I retained all my powers of thought\nand observation; in fact, dead and yet alive. In this state I hovered\nover the people of the Pongo who were gathered together on a great plain\nunder an inky sky. They were going about their business as usual, and\nvery unpleasant business it often was. Some of them were worshipping a\ndim form that I knew was the devil; some were committing murders; some\nwere feasting--at that on which they feasted I would not look; some were\nlabouring or engaged in barter; some were thinking. But I, who had\nthe power of looking into them, saw within the breast of each a tiny\nlikeness of the man or woman or child as it might be, humbly bent\nupon its knees with hands together in an attitude of prayer, and with\nimploring, tear-stained face looking upwards to the black heaven.\n\nThen in that heaven there appeared a single star of light, and from this\nstar flowed lines of gentle fire that spread and widened till all the\nimmense arc was one flame of glory. And now from the pulsing heart of\nthe Glory, which somehow reminded me of moving lips, fell countless\nflakes of snow, each of which followed an appointed path till it lit\nupon the forehead of one of the tiny, imploring figures hidden within\nthose savage breasts, and made it white and clean.\n\nThen the Glory shrank and faded till there remained of it only\nthe similitude of two transparent hands stretched out as though in\nblessing--and I woke up wondering how on earth I found the fancy to\ninvent such a vision, and whether it meant anything or nothing.\n\nAfterwards I repeated it to Brother John, who was a very spiritually\nminded as well as a good man--the two things are often quite\ndifferent--and asked him to be kind enough to explain. At the time he\nshook his head, but some days later he said to me:\n\n\"I think I have read your riddle, Allan; the answer came to me quite of\na sudden. In all those sin-stained hearts there is a seed of good and\nan aspiration towards the right. For every one of them also there is at\nlast mercy and forgiveness, since how could they learn who never had a\nteacher? Your dream, Allan, was one of the ultimate redemption of even\nthe most evil of mankind, by gift of the Grace that shall one day glow\nthrough the blackness of the night in which they wander.\"\n\nThat is what he said, and I only hope that he was right, since at\npresent there is something very wrong with the world, especially in\nAfrica.\n\nAlso we blame the blind savage for many things, but on the balance are\nwe so much better, considering our lights and opportunities? Oh!\nthe truth is that the devil--a very convenient word that--is a good\nfisherman. He has a large book full of flies of different sizes and\ncolours, and well he knows how to suit them to each particular fish. But\nwhite or black, every fish takes one fly or the other, and then comes\nthe question--is the fish that has swallowed the big gaudy lure so much\nworse or more foolish than that which has fallen to the delicate white\nmoth with the same sharp barb in its tail?\n\nIn short, are we not all miserable sinners as the Prayer Book says, and\nin the eye of any judge who can average up the elemental differences of\nthose waters wherein we were bred and are called upon to swim, is there\nso much to choose between us? Do we not all need those outstretched\nHands of Mercy which I saw in my dream?\n\nBut there, there! What right has a poor old hunter to discuss things\nthat are too high for him?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n                             THE MOTOMBO\n\nAfter my dream I went to sleep again, till I was finally aroused by a\nstrong ray of light hitting me straight in the eye.\n\nWhere the dickens does that come from? thought I to myself, for these\nhuts had no windows.\n\nThen I followed the ray to its source, which I perceived was a small\nhole in the mud wall some five feet above the floor. I rose and examined\nthe said hole, and noted that it appeared to have been freshly made, for\nthe clay at the sides of it was in no way discoloured. I reflected that\nif anyone wanted to eavesdrop, such an aperture would be convenient, and\nwent outside the hut to pursue my investigations. Its wall, I found, was\nsituated about four feet from the eastern part of the encircling reed\nfence, which showed no signs of disturbance, although there, in the\nouter face of the wall, was the hole, and beneath it on the lime\nflooring lay some broken fragments of plaster. I called Hans and asked\nhim if he had kept watch round the hut when the wrapped-up man visited\nus during the night. He answered yes, and that he could swear that no\none had come near it, since several times he had walked to the back and\nlooked.\n\nSomewhat comforted, though not satisfied, I went in to wake up the\nothers, to whom I said nothing of this matter since it seemed foolish\nto alarm them for no good purpose. A few minutes later the tall, silent\nwomen arrived with our hot water. It seemed curious to have hot water\nbrought to us in such a place by these very queer kind of housemaids,\nbut so it was. The Pongo, I may add, were, like the Zulus, very clean in\ntheir persons, though whether they all used hot water, I cannot say. At\nany rate, it was provided for us.\n\nHalf an hour later they returned with breakfast, consisting chiefly of\na roasted kid, of which, as it was whole, and therefore unmistakable,\nwe partook thankfully. A little later the Majestic Komba appeared.\nAfter many compliments and inquiries as to our general health, he asked\nwhether we were ready to start on our visit to the Motombo who, he\nadded, was expecting us with much eagerness. I inquired how he knew\nthat, since we had only arranged to call on him late on the previous\nnight, and I understood that he lived a day's journey away. But Komba\nput the matter by with a smile and a wave of his hand.\n\nSo in due course off we went, taking with us all our baggage, which now\nthat it had been lightened by the delivery of the presents, was of no\ngreat weight.\n\nFive minutes' walk along the wide, main street led us to the northern\ngate of Rica Town. Here we found the Kalubi himself with an escort of\nthirty men armed with spears; I noted that unlike the Mazitu they had no\nbows and arrows. He announced in a loud voice that he proposed to do us\nthe special honour of conducting us to the sanctuary of the Holy One, by\nwhich we understood him to mean the Motombo. When we politely begged him\nnot to trouble, being in an irritable mood, or assuming it, he told us\nrudely to mind our own business. Indeed, I think this irritability was\nreal enough, which, in the circumstances known to the reader, was not\nstrange. At any rate, an hour or so later it declared itself in an act\nof great cruelty which showed us how absolute was this man's power in\nall temporal matters.\n\nPassing through a little clump of bush we came to some gardens\nsurrounded by a light fence through which a number of cattle of a small\nand delicate breed--they were not unlike Jerseys in appearance--had\nbroken to enjoy themselves by devouring the crops. This garden, it\nappeared, belonged to the Kalubi for the time being, who was furious at\nthe destruction of its produce by the cattle which also belonged to him.\n\n\"Where is the herd?\" he shouted.\n\nA hunt began--and presently the poor fellow--he was no more than a lad,\nwas discovered asleep behind a bush. When he was dragged before him the\nKalubi pointed, first to the cattle, then to the broken fence and the\ndevastated garden. The lad began to mutter excuses and pray for mercy.\n\n\"Kill him!\" said the Kalubi, whereon the herd flung himself to the\nground, and clutching him by the ankles, began to kiss his feet, crying\nout that he was afraid to die. The Kalubi tried to kick himself free,\nand failing in this, lifted his big spear and made an end of the poor\nboy's prayers and life at a single stroke.\n\nThe escort clapped their hands in salute or approval, after which four\nof them, at a sign, took up the body and started with it at a trot for\nRica Town, where probably that night it appeared upon the grid. Brother\nJohn saw, and his big white beard bristled with indignation like the\nhair on the back of an angry cat, while Stephen spluttered something\nbeginning with \"You brute,\" and lifted his fist as though to knock the\nKalubi down. This, had I not caught hold of him, I have no doubt he\nwould have done.\n\n\"O Kalubi!\" gasped Brother John, \"do you not know that blood calls for\nblood? In the hour of your own death remember this death.\"\n\n\"Would you bewitch me, white man?\" said the Kalubi, glaring at him\nangrily. \"If so----\" and once more he lifted the spear, but as John\nnever stirred, held it poised irresolutely. Komba thrust himself between\nthem, crying:\n\n\"Back, Dogeetah, who dare to meddle with our customs! Is not the Kalubi\nLord of life and death?\"\n\nBrother John was about to answer, but I called to him in English:\n\n\"For Heaven's sake be silent, unless you want to follow the boy. We are\nin these men's power.\"\n\nThen he remembered and walked away, and presently we marched forward as\nthough nothing had happened. Only from that moment I do not think that\nany of us worried ourselves about the Kalubi and what might befall him.\nStill, looking back on the thing, I think that there was this excuse to\nbe made for the man. He was mad with the fear of death and knew not what\nhe did.\n\nAll that day we travelled on through a rich, flat country that, as we\ncould tell from various indications, had once been widely cultivated.\nNow the fields were few and far between, and bush, for the most part a\nkind of bamboo scrub, was reoccupying the land. About midday we halted\nby a water-pool to eat and rest, for the sun was hot, and here the four\nmen who had carried off the boy's body rejoined us and made some report.\nThen we went forward once more towards what seemed to be a curious\nand precipitous wall of black cliff, beyond which the volcanic-looking\nmountain towered in stately grandeur. By three o'clock we were near\nenough to this cliff, which ran east and west as far as the eye could\nreach, to see a hole in it, apparently where the road terminated, that\nappeared to be the mouth of a cave.\n\nThe Kalubi came up to us, and in a shy kind of way tried to make\nconversation. I think that the sight of this mountain, drawing ever\nnearer, vividly recalled his terrors and caused him to desire to efface\nthe bad impression he knew he had made on us, to whom he looked for\nsafety. Among other things he told us that the hole we saw was the door\nof the House of the Motombo.\n\nI nodded my head, but did not answer, for the presence of this murderous\nking made me feel sick. So he went away again, looking at us in a humble\nand deprecatory manner.\n\nNothing further happened until we reached the remarkable wall of rock\nthat I have mentioned, which I suppose is composed of some very\nhard stone that remained when the softer rock in which it lay was\ndisintegrated by millions of years of weather or washings by the water\nof the lake. Or perhaps its substance was thrown out of the bowels of\nthe volcano when this was active. I am no geologist, and cannot say,\nespecially as I lacked time to examine the place. At any rate there it\nwas, and there in it appeared the mouth of a great cave that I presume\nwas natural, having once formed a kind of drain through which the lake\noverflowed when Pongo-land was under water.\n\nWe halted, staring dubiously at this darksome hole, which no doubt was\nthe same that Babemba had explored in his youth. Then the Kalubi gave\nan order, and some of the soldiers went to huts that were built near the\nmouth of the cave, where I suppose guardians or attendants lived,\nthough of these we saw nothing. Presently they returned with a number of\nlighted torches that were distributed among us. This done, we plunged,\nshivering (at least, I shivered), into the gloomy recesses of that great\ncavern, the Kalubi going before us with half of our escort, and Komba\nfollowing behind us with the remainder.\n\nThe floor of the place was made quite smooth, doubtless by the action of\nwater, as were the walls and roof, so far as we could see them, for it\nwas very wide and lofty. It did not run straight, but curved about in\nthe thickness of the cliff. At the first turn the Pongo soldiers set up\na low and eerie chant which they continued during its whole length, that\naccording to my pacings was something over three hundred yards. On we\nwound, the torches making stars of light in the intense blackness, till\nat length we rounded a last corner where a great curtain of woven grass,\nnow drawn, was stretched across the cave. Here we saw a very strange\nsight.\n\nOn either side of it, near to the walls, burned a large wood fire that\ngave light to the place. Also more light flowed into it from its further\nmouth that was not more than twenty paces from the fires. Beyond the\nmouth was water which seemed to be about two hundred yards wide, and\nbeyond the water rose the slopes of the mountain that was covered with\nhuge trees. Moreover, a little bay penetrated into the cavern, the point\nof which bay ended between the two fires. Here the water, which was not\nmore than six or eight feet wide, and shallow, formed the berthing place\nof a good-sized canoe that lay there. The walls of the cavern, from\nthe turn to the point of the tongue of water, were pierced with four\ndoorways, two on either side, which led, I presume, to chambers hewn in\nthe rock. At each of these doorways stood a tall woman clothed in\nwhite, who held in her hand a burning torch. I concluded that these were\nattendants set there to guide and welcome us, for after we had passed,\nthey vanished into the chambers.\n\nBut this was not all. Set across the little bay of water just above the\ncanoe that floated there was a wooden platform, eight feet or so square,\non either side of which stood an enormous elephant's tusk, bigger indeed\nthan any I have seen in all my experience, which tusks seemed to be\nblack with age. Between the tusks, squatted upon rugs of some kind of\nrich fur, was what from its shape and attitude I at first took to be a\nhuge toad. In truth, it had all the appearance of a very bloated toad.\nThere was the rough corrugated skin, there the prominent backbone (for\nits back was towards us), and there were the thin, splayed-out legs.\n\nWe stared at this strange object for quite a long while, unable to make\nit out in that uncertain light, for so long indeed, that I grew nervous\nand was about to ask the Kalubi what it might be. As my lips opened,\nhowever, it stirred, and with a slow, groping, circular movement turned\nitself towards us very slowly. At length it was round, and as the head\ncame in view all the Pongo from the Kalubi down ceased their low, weird\nchant and flung themselves upon their faces, those who had torches still\nholding them up in their right hands.\n\nOh! what a thing appeared! It was not a toad, but a man that moved upon\nall fours. The large, bald head was sunk deep between the shoulders,\neither through deformity or from age, for this creature was undoubtedly\nvery old. Looking at it, I wondered how old, but could form no answer in\nmy mind. The great, broad face was sunken and withered, like to leather\ndried in the sun; the lower lip hung pendulously upon the prominent and\nbony jaw. Two yellow, tusk-like teeth projected one at each corner of\nthe great mouth; all the rest were gone, and from time to time it licked\nthe white gums with a red-pointed tongue as a snake might do. But the\nchief wonder of the Thing lay in its eyes that were large and round,\nperhaps because the flesh had shrunk away from them, which gave them\nthe appearance of being set in the hollow orbits of a skull. These eyes\nliterally shone like fire; indeed, at times they seemed positively to\nblaze, as I have seen a lion's eyes do in the dark. I confess that the\naspect of the creature terrified and for a while paralysed me; to think\nthat it was human was awful.\n\nI glanced at the others and saw that they, too, were frightened. Stephen\nturned very white. I thought that he was going to be sick again, as\nhe was after he drank the coffee out of the wrong bowl on the day we\nentered Mazitu-land. Brother John stroked his white beard and muttered\nsome invocation to Heaven to protect him. Hans exclaimed in his\nabominable Dutch:\n\n\"_Oh! keek, Baas, da is je lelicher oud deel!_\" (\"Oh! look, Baas, there\nis the ugly old devil himself!\")\n\nJerry went flat on his face among the Pongo, muttering that he saw Death\nbefore him. Only Mavovo stood firm; perhaps because as a witch-doctor of\nrepute he felt that it did not become him to show the white feather in\nthe presence of an evil spirit.\n\nThe toad-like creature on the platform swayed its great head slowly as\na tortoise does, and contemplated us with its flaming eyes. At length\nit spoke in a thick, guttural voice, using the tongue that seemed to\nbe common to this part of Africa and indeed to that branch of the Bantu\npeople to which the Zulus belong, but, as I thought, with a foreign\naccent.\n\n\"So _you_ are the white men come back,\" it said slowly. \"Let me count!\"\nand lifting one skinny hand from the ground, it pointed with the\nforefinger and counted. \"One. Tall, with a white beard. Yes, that is\nright. Two. Short, nimble like a monkey, with hair that wants no comb;\nclever, too, like a father of monkeys. Yes, that is right. Three.\nSmooth-faced, young and stupid, like a fat baby that laughs at the sky\nbecause he is full of milk, and thinks that the sky is laughing at him.\nYes, that is right. All three of you are just the same as you used to\nbe. Do you remember, White Beard, how, while we killed you, you said\nprayers to One Who sits above the world, and held up a cross of bone to\nwhich a man was tied who wore a cap of thorns? Do you remember how you\nkissed the man with the cap of thorns as the spear went into you? You\nshake your head--oh! you are a clever liar, but I will show you that you\nare a liar, for I have the thing yet,\" and snatching up a horn which lay\non the kaross beneath him, he blew.\n\nAs the peculiar, wailing note that the horn made died away, a woman\ndashed out of one of the doorways that I have described and flung\nherself on her knees before him. He muttered something to her and she\ndashed back again to re-appear in an instant holding in her hand a\nyellow ivory crucifix.\n\n\"Here it is, here it is,\" he said. \"Take it, White Beard, and kiss it\nonce more, perhaps for the last time,\" and he threw the crucifix\nto Brother John, who caught it and stared at it amazed. \"And do you\nremember, Fat Baby, how we caught you? You fought well, very well,\nbut we killed you at last, and you were good, very good; we got much\nstrength from you.\n\n\"And do you remember, Father of Monkeys, how you escaped from us by your\ncleverness? I wonder where you went to and how you died. I shall not\nforget you, for you gave me this,\" and he pointed to a big white scar\nupon his shoulder. \"You would have killed me, but the stuff in that iron\ntube of yours burned slowly when you held the fire to it, so that I had\ntime to jump aside and the iron ball did not strike me in the heart as\nyou meant that it should. Yet, it is still here; oh! yes, I carry it\nwith me to this day, and now that I have grown thin I can feel it with\nmy finger.\"\n\nI listened astonished to this harangue, which if it meant anything,\nmeant that we had all met before, in Africa at some time when men used\nmatchlocks that were fired with a fuse--that is to say, about the year\n1700, or earlier. Reflection, however, showed me the interpretation of\nthis nonsense. Obviously this old priest's forefather, or, if one put\nhim at a hundred and twenty years of age, and I am sure that he was not\na day less, perhaps his father, as a young man, was mixed up with\nsome of the first Europeans who penetrated to the interior of Africa.\nProbably these were Portuguese, of whom one may have been a priest\nand the other two an elderly man and his son, or young brother, or\ncompanion. The manner of the deaths of these people and of what happened\nto them generally would of course be remembered by the descendants of\nthe chief or head medicine-man of the tribe.\n\n\"Where did we meet, and when, O Motombo?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not in this land, not in this land, Father of Monkeys,\" he replied in\nhis low rumbling voice, \"but far, far away towards the west where the\nsun sinks in the water; and not in this day, but long, long ago. Twenty\nKalubis have ruled the Pongo since that day; some have ruled for many\nyears and some have ruled for a few years--that depends upon the will\nof my brother, the god yonder,\" and he chuckled horribly and jerked his\nthumb backwards over his shoulder towards the forest on the mountain.\n\"Yes, twenty have ruled, some for thirty years and none for less than\nfour.\"\n\n\"Well, you _are_ a large old liar,\" I thought to myself, for, taking the\naverage rule of the Kalubis at ten years, this would mean that we met\nhim two centuries ago at least.\n\n\"You were clothed otherwise then,\" he went on, \"and two of you wore\nhats of iron on the head, but that of White Beard was shaven. I caused a\npicture of you to be beaten by the master-smith upon a plate of copper.\nI have it yet.\"\n\nAgain he blew upon his horn; again a woman darted out, to whom he\nwhispered; again she went to one of the chambers and returned bearing an\nobject which he cast to us.\n\nWe looked at it. It was a copper or bronze plaque, black, apparently\nwith age, which once had been nailed on something for there were the\nholes. It represented a tall man with a long beard and a tonsured head\nwho held a cross in his hand; and two other men, both short, who wore\nround metal caps and were dressed in queer-looking garments and boots\nwith square toes. These man carried big and heavy matchlocks, and in the\nhand of one of them was a smoking fuse. That was all we could make out\nof the thing.\n\n\"Why did you leave the far country and come to this land, O Motombo?\" I\nasked.\n\n\"Because we were afraid that other white men would follow on your steps\nand avenge you. The Kalubi of that day ordered it, though I said No,\nwho knew that none can escape by flight from what must come when it must\ncome. So we travelled and travelled till we found this place, and here\nwe have dwelt from generation to generation. The gods came with us also;\nmy brother that dwells in the forest came, though we never saw him on\nthe journey, yet he was here before us. The Holy Flower came too, and\nthe white Mother of the Flower--she was the wife of one of you, I know\nnot which.\"\n\n\"Your brother the god?\" I said. \"If the god is an ape as we have heard,\nhow can he be the brother of a man?\"\n\n\"Oh! you white men do not understand, but we black people understand. In\nthe beginning the ape killed my brother who was Kalubi, and his spirit\nentered into the ape, making him as a god, and so he kills every other\nKalubi and their spirits enter also into him. Is it not so, O Kalubi of\nto-day, you without a finger?\" and he laughed mockingly.\n\nThe Kalubi, who was lying on his stomach, groaned and trembled, but made\nno other answer.\n\n\"So all has come about as I foresaw,\" went on the toad-like creature.\n\"You have returned, as I knew you would, and now we shall learn whether\nWhite Beard yonder spoke true words when he said that his god would be\navenged upon our god. You shall go to be avenged on him if you can,\nand then we shall learn. But this time you have none of your iron tubes\nwhich alone we fear. For did not the god declare to us through me that\nwhen the white men came back with an iron tube, then he, the god, would\ndie, and I, the Motombo, the god's Mouth, would die, and the Holy Flower\nwould be torn up, and the Mother of the Flower would pass away, and the\npeople of the Pongo would be dispersed and become wanderers and slaves?\nAnd did he not declare that if the white men came again without their\niron tubes, then certain secret things would happen--oh! ask them not,\nin time they shall be known to you, and the people of the Pongo who were\ndwindling would again become fruitful and very great? And that is why we\nwelcome you, white men, who arise again from the land of ghosts, because\nthrough you we, the Pongo, shall become fruitful and very great.\"\n\nOf a sudden he ceased his rumbling talk, his head sank back between his\nshoulders and he sat silent for a long while, his fierce, sparkling\neyes playing on us as though he would read our very thoughts. If he\nsucceeded, I hope that mine pleased him. To tell the truth, I was filled\nwith mixed fear, fury and loathing. Although, of course, I did not\nbelieve a word of all the rubbish he had been saying, which was akin to\nmuch that is evolved by these black-hearted African wizards, I hated the\ncreature whom I felt to be only half-human. My whole nature sickened at\nhis aspect and talk. And yet I was dreadfully afraid of him. I felt as\na man might who wakes up to find himself alone with some peculiarly\ndisgusting Christmas-story kind of ghost. Moreover I was quite sure that\nhe meant us ill, fearful and imminent ill. Suddenly he spoke again:\n\n\"Who is that little yellow one,\" he said, \"that old one with a face like\na skull,\" and he pointed to Hans, who had kept as much out of sight as\npossible behind Mavovo, \"that wizened, snub-nosed one who might be a\nchild of my brother the god, if ever he had a child? And why, being so\nsmall, does he need so large a staff?\" Here he pointed again to Hans's\nbig bamboo stick. \"I think he is as full of guile as a new-filled gourd\nwith water. The big black one,\" and he looked at Mavovo, \"I do not fear,\nfor his magic is less than my magic,\" (he seemed to recognise a brother\ndoctor in Mavovo) \"but the little yellow one with the big stick and the\npack upon his back, I fear him. I think he should be killed.\"\n\nHe paused and we trembled, for if he chose to kill the poor Hottentot,\nhow could we prevent him? But Hans, who saw the great danger, called his\ncunning to his aid.\n\n\"O Motombo,\" he squeaked, \"you must not kill me for I am the servant of\nan ambassador. You know well that all the gods of every land hate and\nwill be revenged upon those who touch ambassadors or their servants,\nwhom they, the gods, alone may harm. If you kill me I shall haunt you.\nYes, I shall sit on your shoulder at night and jibber into your ear so\nthat you cannot sleep, until you die. For though you are old you must\ndie at last, Motombo.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said the Motombo. \"Did I not tell you that he was full of\ncunning? All the gods will be avenged upon those who kill ambassadors\nor their servants. That\"--here he laughed again in his dreadful way--\"is\nthe rights of the gods alone. Let the gods of the Pongo settle it.\"\n\nI uttered a sigh of relief, and he went on in a new voice, a dull,\nbusiness-like voice if I may so describe it:\n\n\"Say, O Kalubi, on what matter have you brought these white men to speak\nwith me, the Mouth of the god? Did I dream that it was a matter of a\ntreaty with the King of the Mazitu? Rise and speak.\"\n\nSo the Kalubi rose and with a humble air set out briefly and clearly the\nreason of our visit to Pongo-land as the envoys of Bausi and the heads\nof the treaty that had been arranged subject to the approval of the\nMotombo and Bausi. We noted that the affair did not seem to interest the\nMotombo at all. Indeed, he appeared to go to sleep while the speech was\nbeing delivered, perhaps because he was exhausted with the invention\nof his outrageous falsehoods, or perhaps for other reasons. When it was\nfinished he opened his eyes and pointed to Komba, saying:\n\n\"Arise, Kalubi-that-is-to-be.\"\n\nSo Komba rose, and in his cold, precise voice narrated his share in the\ntransaction, telling how he had visited Bausi, and all that had happened\nin connection with the embassy. Again the Motombo appeared to go to\nsleep, only opening his eyes once as Komba described how we had been\nsearched for firearms, whereon he nodded his great head in approval and\nlicked his lips with his thin red tongue. When Komba had done, he said:\n\n\"The gods tell me that the plan is wise and good, since without new\nblood the people of the Pongo will die, but of the end of the matter the\ngod knows alone, if even he can read the future.\"\n\nHe paused, then asked sharply:\n\n\"Have you anything more to say, O Kalubi-that-is-to-be? Now of a sudden\nthe god puts it into my mouth to ask if you have anything more to say?\"\n\n\"Something, O Motombo. Many moons ago the god bit _off_ the finger of\nour High Lord, the Kalubi. The Kalubi, having heard that a white man\nskilled in medicine who could cut off limbs with knives, was in the\ncountry of the Mazitu and camped on the borders of the great lake, took\na canoe and rowed to where the white man was camped, he with the beard,\nwho is named Dogeetah, and who stands before you. I followed him in\nanother canoe, because I wished to know what he was doing, also to see\na white man. I hid my canoe and those who went with me in the reeds far\nfrom the Kalubi's canoe. I waded through the shallow water and concealed\nmyself in some thick reeds quite near to the white man's linen house.\nI saw the white man cut off the Kalubi's finger and I heard the Kalubi\npray the white man to come to our country with the iron tubes that\nsmoke, and to kill the god of whom he was afraid.\"\n\nNow from all the company went up a great gasp, and the Kalubi fell down\nupon his face again, and lay still. Only the Motombo seemed to show no\nsurprise, perhaps because he already knew the story.\n\n\"Is that all?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, O Mouth of the god. Last night, after the council of which you have\nheard, the Kalubi wrapped himself up like a corpse and visited the white\nmen in their hut. I thought that he would do so, and had made ready.\nWith a sharp spear I bored a hole in the wall of the hut, working from\noutside the fence. Then I thrust a reed through from the fence across\nthe passage between the fence and the wall, and through the hole in the\nhut, and setting my ear to the end of the reed, I listened.\"\n\n\"Oh! clever, clever!\" muttered Hans in involuntary admiration, \"and\nto think that I looked and looked too low, beneath the reed. Oh! Hans,\nthough you are old, you have much to learn.\"\n\n\"Among much else I heard this,\" went on Komba in sentences so clear and\ncold that they reminded me of the tinkle of falling ice, \"which I\nthink is enough, though I can tell you the rest if you wish, O Mouth.\nI heard,\" he said, in the midst of a silence that was positively awful,\n\"our lord, the Kalubi, whose name is Child of the god, agree with the\nwhite men that they should kill the god--how I do not know, for it was\nnot said--and that in return they should receive the persons of the\nMother of the Holy Flower and of her daughter, the Mother-that-is-to-be,\nand should dig up the Holy Flower itself by the roots and take it away\nacross the water, together with the Mother and the Mother-that-is-to-be.\nThat is all, O Motombo.\"\n\nStill in the midst of an intense silence, the Motombo glared at the\nprostrate figure of the Kalubi. For a long while he glared. Then the\nsilence was broken, for the wretched Kalubi sprang from the floor,\nseized a spear and tried to kill himself. Before the blade touched\nhim it was snatched from his hand, so that he remained standing, but\nweaponless.\n\nAgain there was silence and again it was broken, this time by the\nMotombo, who rose from his seat before which he stood, a huge, bloated\nobject, and roared aloud in his rage. Yes, he roared like a wounded\nbuffalo. Never would I have believed that such a vast volume of sound\ncould have proceeded from the lungs of a single aged man. For fully a\nminute his furious bellowings echoed down that great cave, while all\nthe Pongo soldiers, rising from their recumbent position, pointed their\nhands, in some of which torches still burned, at the miserable Kalubi\non whom their wrath seemed to be concentrated, rather than on us, and\nhissed like snakes.\n\nReally it might have been a scene in hell with the Motombo playing the\npart of Satan. Indeed, his swollen, diabolical figure supported on the\nthin, toad-like legs, the great fires burning on either side, the lurid\nlights of evening reflected from the still water beyond and glowering\namong the tree tops of the mountain, the white-robed forms of the tall\nPongo, bending, every one of them, towards the wretched culprit and\nhissing like so many fierce serpents, all suggested some uttermost deep\nin the infernal regions as one might conceive them in a nightmare.\n\nIt went on for some time, I don't know how long, till at length the\nMotombo picked up his fantastically shaped horn and blew. Thereon the\nwomen darted from the various doorways, but seeing that they were not\nwanted, checked themselves in their stride and remained standing so, in\nthe very attitude of runners about to start upon a race. As the blast\nof the horn died away the turmoil was suddenly succeeded by an utter\nstillness, broken only by the crackling of the fires whose flames,\nof all the living things in that place, alone seemed heedless of the\ntragedy which was being played.\n\n\"All up now, old fellow!\" whispered Stephen to me in a shaky voice.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"all up high as heaven, where I hope we are going.\nNow back to back, and let's make the best fight we can. We've got the\nspears.\"\n\nWhile we were closing in the Motombo began to speak.\n\n\"So you plotted to kill the god, Kalubi-who-_was_,\" he screamed, \"with\nthese white ones whom you would pay with the Holy Flower and her who\nguards it. Good! You shall go, all of you, and talk with the god. And I,\nwatching here, will learn who dies--you or the god. Away with them!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n                               THE GODS\n\nWith a roar the Pongo soldiers leapt on us. I think that Mavovo managed\nto get his spear up and kill a man, for I saw one of them fall backwards\nand lie still. But they were too quick for the rest of us. In half a\nminute we were seized, the spears were wrenched from our hands and we\nwere thrown headlong into the canoe, all six of us, or rather seven\nincluding the Kalubi. A number of the soldiers, including Komba, who\nacted as steersman, also sprang into the canoe that was instantly pushed\nout from beneath the bridge or platform on which the Motombo sat and\ndown the little creek into the still water of the canal or estuary,\nor whatever it may be, that separates the wall of rock which the cave\npierces from the base of the mountain.\n\nAs we floated out of the mouth of the cave the toad-like Motombo, who\nhad wheeled round upon his stool, shouted an order to Komba.\n\n\"O Kalubi,\" he said, \"set the Kalubi-who-_was_ and the three white men\nand their three servants on the borders of the forest that is named\nHouse-of-the-god and leave them there. Then return and depart, for here\nI would watch alone. When all is finished I will summon you.\"\n\nKomba bowed his handsome head and at a sign two of the men got out\npaddles, for more were not needed, and with slow and gentle strokes\nrowed us across the water. The first thing I noted about this water at\nthe time was that its blackness was inky, owing, I suppose, to its depth\nand the shadows of the towering cliff on one side and of the tall trees\non the other. Also I observed--for in this emergency, or perhaps because\nof it, I managed to keep my wits about me--that its banks on either side\nwere the home of great numbers of crocodiles which lay there like logs.\nI saw, further, that a little lower down where the water seemed to\nnarrow, jagged boughs projected from its surface as though great trees\nhad fallen, or been thrown into it. I recalled in a numb sort of way\nthat old Babemba had told us that when he was a boy he had escaped in a\ncanoe down this estuary, and reflected that it would not be possible for\nhim to do so now because of those snags. Unless, indeed, he had floated\nover them in a time of great flood.\n\nA couple of minutes or so of paddling brought us to the further shore\nwhich, as I think I have said, was only about two hundred yards from the\nmouth of the cave. The bow of the canoe grated on the bank, disturbing a\nhuge crocodile that vanished into the depths with an angry plunge.\n\n\"Land, white lords, land,\" said Komba with the utmost politeness, \"and\ngo, visit the god who doubtless is waiting for you. And now, as we shall\nmeet no more--farewell. You are wise and I am foolish, yet hearken to my\ncounsel. If ever you should return to the Earth again, be advised by me.\nCling to your own god if you have one, and do not meddle with those of\nother peoples. Again farewell.\"\n\nThe advice was excellent, but at that moment I felt a hate for Komba\nwhich was really superhuman. To me even the Motombo seemed an angel of\nlight as compared with him. If wishes could have killed, our farewell\nwould indeed have been complete.\n\nThen, admonished by the spear points of the Pongo, we landed in the\nslimy mud. Brother John went first with a smile upon his handsome\ncountenance that I thought idiotic under the circumstances, though\ndoubtless he knew best when he ought to smile, and the wretched Kalubi\ncame last. Indeed, so great was his shrinking from that ominous\nshore, that I believe he was ultimately propelled from the boat by his\nsuccessor in power, Komba. Once he had trodden it, however, a spark of\nspirit returned to him, for he wheeled round and said to Komba,\n\n\"Remember, O Kalubi, that my fate to-day will be yours also in a day to\ncome. The god wearies of his priests. This year, next year, or the year\nafter; he always wearies of his priests.\"\n\n\"Then, O Kalubi-that-was,\" answered Komba in a mocking voice as the\ncanoe was pushed off, \"pray to the god for me, that it may be the year\nafter; pray it as your bones break in his embrace.\"\n\nWhile we watched that craft depart there came into my mind the memory\nof a picture in an old Latin book of my father's, which represented the\nsouls of the dead being paddled by a person named Charon across a river\ncalled the Styx. The scene before us bore a great resemblance to that\npicture. There was Charon's boat floating on the dreadful Styx. Yonder\nglowed the lights of the world, here was the gloomy, unknown shore. And\nwe, we were the souls of the dead awaiting the last destruction at the\nteeth and claws of some unknown monster, such as that which haunts the\nrecesses of the Egyptian hell. Oh! the parallel was painfully exact. And\nyet, what do you think was the remark of that irrepressible young man\nStephen?\n\n\"Here we are at last, Allan, my boy,\" he said, \"and after all without\nany trouble on our own part. I call it downright providential. Oh! isn't\nit jolly! Hip, hip, hooray!\"\n\nYes, he danced about in that filthy mud, threw up his cap and cheered!\n\nI withered, or rather tried to wither him with a look, muttering the\nsingle word: \"Lunatic.\"\n\nProvidential! Jolly! Well, it's fortunate that some people's madness\ntakes a cheerful turn. Then I asked the Kalubi where the god was.\n\n\"Everywhere,\" he replied, waving his trembling hand at the illimitable\nforest. \"Perhaps behind this tree, perhaps behind that, perhaps a long\nway off. Before morning we shall know.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" I inquired savagely.\n\n\"Die,\" he answered.\n\n\"Look here, fool,\" I exclaimed, shaking him, \"you can die if you like,\nbut we don't mean to. Take us to some place where we shall be safe from\nthis god.\"\n\n\"One is never safe from the god, lord, especially in his own House,\" and\nhe shook his silly head and went on, \"How can we be safe when there is\nnowhere to go and even the trees are too big to climb?\"\n\nI looked at them, it was true. They were huge and ran up for fifty\nor sixty feet without a bough. Moreover, it was probable that the god\nclimbed better than we could. The Kalubi began to move inland in an\nindeterminate fashion, and I asked him where he was going.\n\n\"To the burying-place,\" he answered. \"There are spears yonder with the\nbones.\"\n\nI pricked up my ears at this--for when one has nothing but some clasp\nknives, spears are not to be despised--and ordered him to lead on. In\nanother minute we were walking uphill through the awful wood where the\ngloom at this hour of approaching night was that of an English fog.\n\nThree or four hundred paces brought us to a kind of clearing, where\nI suppose some of the monster trees had fallen down in past years and\nnever been allowed to grow up again. Here, placed upon the ground, were\na number of boxes made of imperishable ironwood, and on the top of each\nbox sat, or rather lay, a mouldering and broken skull.\n\n\"Kalubi-that-were!\" murmured our guide in explanation. \"Look, Komba has\nmade my box ready,\" and he pointed to a new case with the lid off.\n\n\"How thoughtful of him!\" I said. \"But show us the spears before it gets\nquite dark.\" He went to one of the newer coffins and intimated that we\nshould lift off the lid as he was afraid to do so.\n\nI shoved it aside. There within lay the bones, each of them separate\nand wrapped up in something, except of course the skull. With these were\nsome pots filled apparently with gold dust, and alongside of the pots\ntwo good spears that, being made of copper, had not rusted much. We went\non to other coffins and extracted from them more of these weapons that\nwere laid there for the dead man to use upon his journey through the\nShades, until we had enough. The shafts of most of them were somewhat\nrotten from the damp, but luckily they were furnished with copper\nsockets from two and a half to three feet long, into which the wood of\nthe shaft fitted, so that they were still serviceable.\n\n\"Poor things these to fight a devil with,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, Baas,\" said Hans in a cheerful voice, \"very poor. It is lucky that\nI have got a better.\"\n\nI stared at him; we all stared at him.\n\n\"What do you mean, Spotted Snake?\" asked Mavovo.\n\n\"What do you mean, child of a hundred idiots? Is this a time to jest? Is\nnot one joker enough among us?\" I asked, and looked at Stephen.\n\n\"Mean, Baas? Don't you know that I have the little rifle with me, that\nwhich is called _Intombi_, that with which you shot the vultures at\nDingaan's kraal? I never told you because I was sure you knew; also\nbecause if you didn't know it was better that you should not know, for\nif _you_ had known, those Pongo _skellums_ (that is, vicious ones) might\nhave come to know also. And if _they_ had known----\"\n\n\"Mad!\" interrupted Brother John, tapping his forehead, \"quite mad, poor\nfellow! Well, in these depressing circumstances it is not wonderful.\"\n\nI inspected Hans again, for I agreed with John. Yet he did not look mad,\nonly rather more cunning than usual.\n\n\"Hans,\" I said, \"tell us where this rifle is, or I will knock you down\nand Mavovo shall flog you.\"\n\n\"Where, Baas! Why, cannot you see it when it is before your eyes?\"\n\n\"You are right, John,\" I said, \"he's off it\"; but Stephen sprang at Hans\nand began to shake him.\n\n\"Leave go, Baas,\" he said, \"or you may hurt the rifle.\"\n\nStephen obeyed in sheer astonishment. Then, oh! then Hans did something\nto the end of his great bamboo stick, turned it gently upside down and\nout of it slid the barrel of a rifle neatly tied round with greased\ncloth and stoppered at the muzzle with a piece of tow!\n\nI could have kissed him. Yes, such was my joy that I could have kissed\nthat hideous, smelly old Hottentot.\n\n\"The stock?\" I panted. \"The barrel isn't any use without the stock,\nHans.\"\n\n\"Oh! Baas,\" he answered, grinning, \"do you think that I have shot with\nyou all these years without knowing that a rifle must have a stock to\nhold it by?\"\n\nThen he slipped off the bundle from his back, undid the lashings of the\nblanket, revealing the great yellow head of tobacco that had excited my\nown and Komba's interest on the shores of the lake. This head he tore\napart and produced the stock of the rifle nicely cleaned, a cap set\nready on the nipple, on to which the hammer was let down, with a little\npiece of wad between to prevent the cap from being fired by any sudden\njar.\n\n\"Hans,\" I exclaimed, \"Hans, you are a hero and worth your weight in\ngold!\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, though you never told me so before. Oh! I made up my mind\nthat I wouldn't go to sleep in the face of the Old Man (death). Oh!\nwhich of you ought to sleep now upon that bed that Bausi sent me?\" he\nasked as he put the gun together. \"_You_, I think, you great stupid\nMavovo. _You_ never brought a gun. If you were a wizard worth the name\nyou would have sent the rifles on and had them ready to meet us here.\nOh! will you laugh at me any more, you thick-head of a Zulu?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Mavovo candidly. \"I will give you _sibonga_. Yes, I will\nmake for you Titles of Praise, O clever Spotted Snake.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" went on Hans, \"I am not all a hero; I am worth but half my\nweight in gold. For, Baas, although I have plenty of powder and bullets\nin my pocket, I lost the caps out of a hole in my waistcoat. You\nremember, Baas, I told you it was charms I lost. But three remain; no,\nfour, for there is one on the nipple. There, Baas, there is _Intombi_\nall ready and loaded. And now when the white devil comes you can shoot\nhim in the eye, as you how to do up to a hundred yards, and send him to\nthe other devils down in hell. Oh! won't your holy father the Predikant\nbe glad to see him there.\"\n\nThen with a self-satisfied smirk he half-cocked the rifle and handed it\nto me ready for action.\n\n\"I thank God!\" said Brother John solemnly, \"who has taught this poor\nHottentot how to save us.\"\n\n\"No, Baas John, God never taught me, I taught myself. But, see, it grows\ndark. Had we not better light a fire,\" and forgetting the rifle he began\nto look about for wood.\n\n\"Hans,\" called Stephen after him, \"if ever we get out of this, I will\ngive you \u00a3500, or at least my father will, which is the same thing.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Baas, thank you, though just now I'd rather have a drop of\nbrandy and--I don't see any wood.\"\n\nHe was right. Outside of the graveyard clearing lay, it is true, some\nhuge fallen boughs. But these were too big for us to move or cut.\nMoreover, they were so soaked with damp, like everything in this forest,\nthat it would be impossible to fire them.\n\nThe darkness closed in. It was not absolute blackness, because presently\nthe moon rose, but the sky was rainy and obscured it; moreover, the huge\ntrees all about seemed to suck up whatever light there was. We crouched\nourselves upon the ground back to back as near as possible to the centre\nof the place, unrolled such blankets as we had to protect us from the\ndamp and cold, and ate some biltong or dried game flesh and parched\ncorn, of which fortunately the boy Jerry carried a bagful that had\nremained upon his shoulders when he was thrown into the canoe. Luckily I\nhad thought of bringing this food with us; also a flask of spirits.\n\nThen it was that the first thing happened. Far away in the forest\nresounded a most awful roar, followed by a drumming noise, such a roar\nas none of us had ever heard before, for it was quite unlike that of a\nlion or any other beast.\n\n\"What is that?\" I asked.\n\n\"The god,\" groaned the Kalubi, \"the god praying to the moon with which\nhe always rises.\"\n\nI said nothing, for I was reflecting that four shots, which was all\nwe had, was not many, and that nothing should tempt me to waste one of\nthem. Oh! why had Hans put on that rotten old waistcoat instead of the\nnew one I gave him in Durban?\n\nSince we heard no more roars Brother John began to question the Kalubi\nas to where the Mother of the Flower lived.\n\n\"Lord,\" answered the man in a distracted way, \"there, towards the East.\nYou walk for a quarter of the sun's journey up the hill, following\na path that is marked by notches cut upon the trees, till beyond\nthe garden of the god at the top of the mountain more water is found\nsurrounding an island. There on the banks of the water a canoe is hidden\nin the bushes, by which the water may be crossed to the island, where\ndwells the Mother of the Holy Flower.\"\n\nBrother John did not seem to be quite satisfied with the information,\nand remarked that he, the Kalubi, would be able to show us the road on\nthe morrow.\n\n\"I do not think that I shall ever show you the road,\" groaned the\nshivering wretch.\n\nAt that moment the god roared again much nearer. Now the Kalubi's nerve\ngave out altogether, and quickened by some presentiment, he began to\nquestion Brother John, whom he had learned was a priest of an unknown\nsort, as to the possibility of another life after death.\n\nBrother John, who, be it remembered, was a very earnest missionary by\ncalling, proceeded to administer some compressed religious consolations,\nwhen, quite near to us, the god began to beat upon some kind of very\nlarge and deep drum. He didn't roar this time, he only worked away at\na massed-band military drum. At least that is what it sounded like, and\nvery unpleasant it was to hear in that awful forest with skulls arranged\non boxes all round us, I can assure you, my reader.\n\nThe drumming ceased, and pulling himself together, Brother John\ncontinued his pious demonstrations. Also just at that time a thick\nrain-cloud quite obscured the moon, so that the darkness grew dense. I\nheard John explaining to the Kalubi that he was not really a Kalubi,\nbut an immortal soul (I wonder whether he understood him). Then I became\naware of a horrible shadow--I cannot describe it in any other\nway--that was blacker than the blackness, which advanced towards us at\nextraordinary speed from the edge of the clearing.\n\nNext second there was a kind of scuffle a few feet from me, followed by\na stifled yell, and I saw the shadow retreating in the direction from\nwhich it had come.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked.\n\n\"Strike a match,\" answered Brother John; \"I think something has\nhappened.\"\n\nI struck a match, which burnt up very well, for the air was quite still.\nIn the light of it I saw first the anxious faces of our party--how\nghastly they looked!--and next the Kalubi who had risen and was waving\nhis right arm in the air, a right arm that was bloody and _lacked the\nhand_.\n\n\"The god has visited me and taken away my hand!\" he moaned in a wailing\nvoice.\n\nI don't think anybody spoke; the thing was beyond words, but we tried to\nbind the poor fellow's arm up by the light of matches. Then we sat down\nagain and watched.\n\nThe darkness grew still denser as the thick of the cloud passed over the\nmoon, and for a while the silence, that utter silence of the tropical\nforest at night, was broken only by the sound of our breathing, the buzz\nof a few mosquitoes, the distant splash of a plunging crocodile and the\nstifled groans of the mutilated man.\n\nAgain I saw, or thought I saw--this may have been half an hour\nlater--that black shadow dart towards us, as a pike darts at a fish in\na pond. There was another scuffle, just to my left--Hans sat between me\nand the Kalubi--followed by a single prolonged wail.\n\n\"The king-man has gone,\" whispered Hans. \"I felt him go as though a wind\nhad blown him away. Where he was there is nothing but a hole.\"\n\nOf a sudden the moon shone out from behind the clouds. In its sickly\nlight about half-way between us and the edge of the clearing, say thirty\nyards off, I saw--oh! what did I see! The devil destroying a lost soul.\nAt least, that is what it looked like. A huge, grey-black creature,\ngrotesquely human in its shape, had the thin Kalubi in its grip. The\nKalubi's head had vanished in its maw and its vast black arms seemed to\nbe employed in breaking him to pieces.\n\nApparently he was already dead, though his feet, that were lifted off\nthe ground, still moved feebly.\n\nI sprang up and covered the beast with the rifle which was cocked,\ngetting full on to its head which showed the clearest, though this was\nrather guesswork, since I could not see distinctly the fore-sight. I\npulled, but either the cap or the powder had got a little damp on\nthe journey and hung fire for the fraction of a second. In that\ninfinitesimal time the devil--it is the best name I can give the\nthing--saw me, or perhaps it only saw the light gleaming on the barrel.\nAt any rate it dropped the Kalubi, and as though some intelligence\nwarned it what to expect, threw up its massive right arm--I remember how\nextraordinarily long the limb seemed and that it looked thick as a man's\nthigh--in such a fashion as to cover its head.\n\nThen the rifle exploded and I heard the bullet strike. By the light of\nthe flash I saw the great arm tumble down in a dead, helpless kind of\nway, and next instant the whole forest began to echo with peal upon peal\nof those awful roarings that I have described, each of which ended with\na dog-like _yowp_ of pain.\n\n\"You have hit him, Baas,\" said Hans, \"and he isn't a ghost, for he\ndoesn't like it. But he's still very lively.\"\n\n\"Close up,\" I answered, \"and hold out the spears while I reload.\"\n\nMy fear was that the brute would rush on us. But it did not. For all\nthat dreadful night we saw or heard it no more. Indeed, I began to hope\nthat after all the bullet had reached some mortal part and that the\ngreat ape was dead.\n\nAt length, it seemed to be weeks afterwards, the dawn broke and revealed\nus sitting white and shivering in the grey mist; that is, all except\nStephen, who had gone comfortably to sleep with his head resting on\nMavovo's shoulder. He is a man so equably minded and so devoid of\nnerves, that I feel sure he will be one of the last to be disturbed by\nthe trump of the archangel. At least, so I told him indignantly when at\nlength we roused him from his indecent slumbers.\n\n\"You should judge things by results, Allan,\" he said with a yawn. \"I'm\nas fresh as a pippin while you all look as though you had been to a ball\nwith twelve extras. Have you retrieved the Kalubi yet?\"\n\nShortly afterwards, when the mist lifted a little, we went out in a\nline to \"retrieve the Kalubi,\" and found--well, I won't describe what we\nfound. He was a cruel wretch, as the incident of the herd-boy had told\nus, but I felt sorry for him. Still, his terrors were over, or at least\nI hope so.\n\nWe deposited him in the box that Komba had kindly provided in\npreparation for this inevitable event, and Brother John said a prayer\nover his miscellaneous remains. Then, after consultation and in the very\nworst of spirits, we set out to seek the way to the home of the Mother\nof the Flower. The start was easy enough, for a distinct, though very\nfaint path led from the clearing up the slope of the hill. Afterwards it\nbecame more difficult for the denser forest began. Fortunately very\nfew creepers grew in this forest, but the flat tops of the huge trees\nmeeting high above entirely shut out the sky, so that the gloom was\ngreat, in places almost that of night.\n\nOh! it was a melancholy journey as, filled with fears, we stole, a\npallid throng, from trunk to trunk, searching them for the notches that\nindicated our road, and speaking only in whispers, lest the sound of our\nvoices should attract the notice of the dreadful god. After a mile or\ntwo of this we became aware that its notice was attracted despite our\nprecautions, for at times we caught glimpses of some huge grey thing\nslipping along parallel to us between the boles of the trees. Hans\nwanted me to try a shot, but I would not, knowing that the chances of\nhitting it were small indeed. With only three charges, or rather three\ncaps left, it was necessary to be saving.\n\nWe halted and held a consultation, as a result of which we decided\nthat there was no more danger in going on than in standing still or\nattempting to return. So we went on, keeping close together. To me, as\nI was the only one with a rifle, was accorded what I did not at all\nappreciate, the honour of heading the procession.\n\nAnother half-mile and again we heard that strange rolling sound which\nwas produced, I believe, by the great brute beating upon its breast, but\nnoted that it was not so continuous as on the previous night.\n\n\"Ha!\" said Hans, \"he can only strike his drum with one stick now. Your\nbullet broke the other, Baas.\"\n\nA little farther and the god roared quite close, so loudly that the air\nseemed to tremble.\n\n\"The drum is all right, whatever may have happened to the sticks,\" I\nsaid.\n\nA hundred yards or so more and the catastrophe occurred. We had reached\na spot in the forest where one of the great trees had fallen down,\nletting in a little light. I can see it to this hour. There lay the\nenormous tree, its bark covered with grey mosses and clumps of a giant\nspecies of maidenhair fern. On our side of it was the open space\nwhich may have measured forty feet across, where the light fell in a\nperpendicular ray, as it does through the smoke-hole of a hut. Looking\nat this prostrate trunk, I saw first two lurid and fiery eyes that\nglowed red in the shadow; and then, almost in the same instant, made\nout what looked like the head of a fiend enclosed in a wreath of the\ndelicate green ferns. I can't describe it, I can only repeat that it\nlooked like the head of a very large fiend with a pallid face, huge\noverhanging eyebrows and great yellow tushes on either side of the\nmouth.\n\nBefore I had even time to get the rifle up, with one terrific roar the\nbrute was on us. I saw its enormous grey shape on the top of the trunk,\nI saw it pass me like a flash, running upright as a man does, but with\nthe head held forward, and noted that the arm nearest to me was swinging\nas though broken. Then as I turned I heard a scream of terror and\nperceived that it had gripped the poor Mazitu, Jerry, who walked last\nbut one of our line which was ended by Mavovo. Yes, it had gripped him\nand was carrying him off, clasped to its breast with its sound arm.\nWhen I say that Jerry, although a full-grown man and rather inclined to\nstoutness, looked like a child in that fell embrace, it will give some\nidea of the creature's size.\n\nMavovo, who had the courage of a buffalo, charged at it and drove the\ncopper spear he carried into its side. They all charged like berserkers,\nexcept myself, for even then, thank Heaven! I knew a trick worth two of\nthat. In three seconds there was a struggling mass in the centre of the\nclearing. Brother John, Stephen, Mavovo and Hans were all stabbing at\nthe enormous gorilla, for it was a gorilla, although their blows seemed\nto do it no more harm than pinpricks. Fortunately for them, for its\npart, the beast would not let go of Jerry, and having only one sound\narm, could but snap at its assailants, for if it had lifted a foot to\nrend them, its top-heavy bulk would have caused it to tumble over.\n\nAt length it seemed to realise this, and hurled Jerry away, knocking\ndown Brother John and Hans with his body. Then it leapt on Mavovo, who,\nseeing it come, placed the copper socket of the spear against his own\nbreast, with the result that when the gorilla tried to crush him, the\npoint of the spear was driven into its carcase. Feeling the pain,\nit unwound its arm from about Mavovo, knocking Stephen over with the\nbackward sweep. Then it raised its great hand to crush Mavovo with a\nblow, as I believe gorillas are wont to do.\n\nThis was the chance for which I was waiting. Up till that moment I had\nnot dared to fire, fearing lest I should kill one of my companions. Now\nfor an instant it was clear of them all, and steadying myself, I aimed\nat the huge head and let drive. The smoke thinned, and through it I\nsaw the gigantic ape standing quite still, like a creature lost in\nmeditation.\n\nThen it threw up its sound arm, turned its fierce eyes to the sky, and\nuttering one pitiful and hideous howl, sank down dead. The bullet had\nentered just behind the ear and buried itself in the brain.\n\nThe great silence of the forest flowed in over us, as it were; for quite\na while no one did or said anything. Then from somewhere down amidst the\nmosses I heard a thin voice, the sound of which reminded me of air being\nsqueezed out of an indiarubber cushion.\n\n\"Very good shot, Baas,\" it piped up, \"as good as that which killed the\nking-vulture at Dingaan's kraal, and more difficult. But if the Baas\ncould pull the god off me I should say--Thank you.\"\n\nThe \"thank you\" was almost inaudible, and no wonder, for poor Hans had\nfainted. There he lay under the huge bulk of the gorilla, just his nose\nand mouth appearing between the brute's body and its arm. Had it not\nbeen for the soft cushion of wet moss in which he reclined, I think that\nhe would have been crushed flat.\n\nWe rolled the creature off him somehow and poured a little brandy down\nhis throat, which had a wonderful effect, for in less than a minute he\nsat up, grasping like a dying fish, and asked for more.\n\nLeaving Brother John to examine Hans to see if he was really injured,\nI bethought me of poor Jerry and went to look at him. One glance was\nenough. He was quite dead. Indeed, he seemed to be crushed out of shape\nlike a buck that has been enveloped in the coils of a boa-constrictor.\nBrother John told me afterwards that both his arms and nearly all\nhis ribs had been broken in that terrible embrace. Even his spine was\ndislocated.\n\nI have often wondered why the gorilla ran down the line without touching\nme or the others, to vent his rage upon Jerry. I can only suggest that\nit was because the unlucky Mazitu had sat next to the Kalubi on the\nprevious night, which may have caused the brute to identify him by smell\nwith the priest whom he had learned to hate and killed. It is true that\nHans had sat on the other side of the Kalubi, but perhaps the odour of\nthe Pongo had not clung to him so much, or perhaps it meant to deal with\nhim after it had done with Jerry.\n\nWhen we knew that the Mazitu was past human help and had discovered\nto our joy that, save for a few bruises, no one else was really\nhurt, although Stephen's clothes were half-torn off him, we made an\nexamination of the dead god. Truly it was a fearful creature.\n\nWhat its exact weight or size may have been we had no means of\nascertaining, but I never saw or heard of such an enormous ape, if a\ngorilla is really an ape. It needed the united strength of the five of\nus to lift the carcase with a great effort off the fainting Hans and\neven to roll it from side to side when subsequently we removed the skin.\nI would never have believed that so ancient an animal of its stature,\nwhich could not have been more than seven feet when it stood erect,\ncould have been so heavy. For ancient undoubtedly it was. The long,\nyellow, canine tusks were worn half-away with use; the eyes were sunken\nfar into the skull; the hair of the head, which I am told is generally\nred or brown, was quite white, and even the bare breast, which should\nbe black, was grey in hue. Of course, it was impossible to say, but one\nmight easily have imagined that this creature was two hundred years or\nmore old, as the Motombo had declared it to be.\n\nStephen suggested that it should be skinned, and although I saw little\nprospect of our being able to carry away the hide, I assented and helped\nin the operation on the mere chance of saving so great a curiosity.\nAlso, although Brother John was restless and murmured something about\nwasting time, I thought it necessary that we should have a rest after\nour fearful anxieties and still more fearful encounter with this\nconsecrated monster. So we set to work, and as a result of more than an\nhour's toil, dragged off the hide, which was so tough and thick that,\nas we found, the copper spears had scarcely penetrated to the flesh.\nThe bullet that I had put into it on the previous night struck,\nwe discovered, upon the bone of the upper arm, which it shattered\nsufficiently to render that limb useless, if it did not break it\naltogether. This, indeed, was fortunate for us, for had the creature\nretained both its arms uninjured, it would certainly have killed more\nof us in its attack. We were saved only by the fact that when it was\nhugging Jerry it had no limb left with which it could strike, and\nluckily did not succeed in its attempts to get hold with its tremendous\njaws that had nipped off the Kalubi's hand as easily as a pair of\nscissors severs the stalk of a flower.\n\nWhen the skin was removed, except that of the hands, which we did not\nattempt to touch, we pegged it out, raw side uppermost, to dry in the\ncentre of the open place where the sun struck. Then, having buried poor\nJerry in the hollow trunk of the great fallen tree, we washed ourselves\nwith the wet mosses and ate some of the food that remained to us.\n\nAfter this we started forward again in much better spirits. Jerry, it\nwas true, was dead, but so was the god, leaving us happily still alive\nand practically untouched. Never more would the Kalubis of Pongo-land\nshiver out their lives at the feet of this dreadful divinity who soon or\nlate must become their executioner, for I believe, with the exception of\ntwo who committed suicide through fear, that no Kalubi was ever known to\nhave died except by the hand--or teeth--of the god.\n\nWhat would I not give to know that brute's history? Could it possibly,\nas the Motombo said, have accompanied the Pongo people from their home\nin Western or Central Africa, or perhaps have been brought here by them\nin a state of captivity? I am unable to answer the question, but it\nshould be noted that none of the Mazitu or other natives had ever heard\nof the existence of more true gorillas in this part of Africa. The\ncreature, if it had its origin in the locality, must either have been\nsolitary in its habits or driven away from its fellows, as sometimes\nhappens to old elephants, which then, like this gorilla, become\nfearfully ferocious.\n\nThat is all I can say about the brute, though of course the Pongo had\ntheir own story. According to them it was an evil spirit in the shape\nof an ape, which evil spirit had once inhabited the body of an early\nKalubi, and had been annexed by the ape when it killed the said Kalubi.\nAlso they declared that the reason the creature put all the Kalubis to\ndeath, as well as a number of other people who were offered up to it,\nwas that it needed \"to refresh itself with the spirits of men,\" by which\nmeans it was enabled to avoid the effects of age. It will be remembered\nthat the Motombo referred to this belief, of which afterwards I heard\nin more detail from Babemba. But if this god had anything supernatural\nabout it, at least its magic was no shield against a bullet from a\nPurdey rifle.\n\nOnly a little way from the fallen tree we came suddenly upon a large\nclearing, which we guessed at once must be that \"Garden of the god\"\nwhere twice a year the unfortunate Kalubis were doomed to scatter the\n\"sacred seed.\" It was a large garden, several acres of it, lying on a\nshelf, as it were, of the mountain and watered by a stream. Maize grew\nin it, also other sorts of corn, while all round was a thick belt of\nplantain trees. Of course these crops had formed the food of the god\nwho, whenever it was hungry, came to this place and helped itself, as we\ncould see by many signs. The garden was well kept and comparatively free\nfrom weeds. At first we wondered how this could be, till I remembered\nthat the Kalubi, or someone, had told me that it was tended by the\nservants of the Mother of the Flower, who were generally albinos or\nmutes.\n\nWe crossed it and pushed on rapidly up the mountain, once more following\nan easy and well-beaten path, for now we saw that we were approaching\nwhat we thought must be the edge of a crater. Indeed, our excitement was\nso extreme that we did not speak, only scrambled forward, Brother John,\nnotwithstanding his lame leg, leading at a greater pace than we could\nequal. He was the first to reach our goal, closely followed by Stephen.\nWatching, I saw him sink down as though in a swoon. Stephen also\nappeared astonished, for he threw up his hands.\n\nI rushed to them, and this was what I saw. Beneath us was a steep slope\nquite bare of forest, which ceased at its crest. This slope stretched\ndownwards for half a mile or more to the lip of a beautiful lake, of\nwhich the area was perhaps two hundred acres. Set in the centre of\nthe deep blue water of this lake, which we discovered afterwards to\nbe unfathomable, was an island not more than five and twenty or thirty\nacres in extent, that seemed to be cultivated, for on it we could see\nfields, palms and other fruit-bearing trees. In the middle of the island\nstood a small, near house thatched after the fashion of the country, but\ncivilized in its appearance, for it was oblong, not round, and encircled\nby a verandah and a reed fence. At a distance from this house were a\nnumber of native huts, and in front of it a small enclosure surrounded\nby a high wall, on the top of which mats were fixed on poles as though\nto screen something from wind or sun.\n\n\"The Holy Flower lives there, you bet,\" gasped Stephen excitedly--he\ncould think of nothing but that confounded orchid. \"Look, the mats\nare up on the sunny side to prevent its scorching, and those palms are\nplanted round to give it shade.\"\n\n\"The Mother of the Flower lives there,\" whispered Brother John, pointing\nto the house. \"Who is she? Who is she? Suppose I should be mistaken\nafter all. God, let me not be mistaken, for it would be more than I can\nbear.\"\n\n\"We had better try to find out,\" I remarked practically, though I am\nsure I sympathised with his suspense, and started down the slope at a\nrun.\n\nIn five minutes or less we reached the foot of it, and, breathless and\nperspiring though we were, began to search amongst the reeds and bushes\ngrowing at the edge of the lake for the canoe of which we had been told\nby the Kalubi. What if there were none? How could we cross that\nwide stretch of deep water? Presently Hans, who, following certain\nindications which caught his practised eye, had cast away to the left,\nheld up his hand and whistled. We ran to him.\n\n\"Here it is, Baas,\" he said, and pointed to something in a tiny\nbush-fringed inlet, that at first sight looked like a heap of dead\nreeds. We tore away at the reeds, and there, sure enough, was a canoe of\nsufficient size to hold twelve or fourteen people, and in it a number of\npaddles.\n\nAnother two minutes and we were rowing across that lake.\n\nWe came safely to the other side, where we found a little landing-stage\nmade of poles sunk into the lake. We tied up the canoe, or rather I did,\nfor nobody else remembered to take that precaution, and presently were\non a path which led through the cultivated fields to the house. Here I\ninsisted upon going first with the rifle, in case we should be suddenly\nattacked. The silence and the absence of any human beings suggested to\nme that this might very well happen, since it would be strange if we had\nnot been seen crossing the lake.\n\nAfterwards I discovered why the place seemed so deserted. It was owing\nto two reasons. First, it was now noontime, an hour at which these poor\nslaves retired to their huts to eat and sleep through the heat of the\nday. Secondly, although the \"Watcher,\" as she was called, had seen\nthe canoe on the water, she concluded that the Kalubi was visiting the\nMother of the Flower and, according to practice on these occasions,\nwithdrew herself and everybody else, since the rare meetings of the\nKalubi and the Mother of the Flower partook of the nature of a religious\nceremony and must be held in private.\n\nFirst we came to the little enclosure that was planted about with palms\nand, as I have described, screened with mats. Stephen ran at it and,\nscrambling up the wall, peeped over the top.\n\nNext instant he was sitting on the ground, having descended from the\nwall with the rapidity of one shot through the head.\n\n\"Oh! by Jingo!\" he ejaculated, \"oh! by Jingo!\" and that was all I could\nget out of him, though it is true I did not try very hard at the time.\n\nNot five paces from this enclosure stood a tall reed fence that\nsurrounded the house. It had a gate also of reeds, which was a little\najar. Creeping up to it very cautiously, for I thought I heard a voice\nwithin, I peeped through the half-opened gate. Four or five feet away\nwas the verandah from which a doorway led into one of the rooms of the\nhouse where stood a table on which was food.\n\nKneeling on mats upon this verandah were--_two white women_--clothed in\ngarments of the purest white adorned with a purple fringe, and wearing\nbracelets and other ornaments of red native gold. One of these appeared\nto be about forty years of age. She was rather stout, fair in colouring,\nwith blue eyes and golden hair that hung down her back. The other might\nhave been about twenty. She also was fair, but her eyes were grey and\nher long hair was of a chestnut hue. I saw at once that she was tall and\nvery beautiful. The elder woman was praying, while the other, who knelt\nby her side, listened and looked up vacantly at the sky.\n\n\"O God,\" prayed the woman, \"for Christ's sake look in pity upon us two\npoor captives, and if it be possible, send us deliverance from this\nsavage land. We thank Thee Who hast protected us unharmed and in health\nfor so many years, and we put our trust in Thy mercy, for Thou alone\ncanst help us. Grant, O God, that our dear husband and father may still\nlive, and that in Thy good time we may be reunited to him. Or if he be\ndead and there is no hope for us upon the earth, grant that we, too, may\ndie and find him in Thy Heaven.\"\n\nThus she prayed in a clear, deliberate voice, and I noticed that as she\ndid so the tears ran down her cheeks. \"Amen,\" she said at last, and\nthe girl by her side, speaking with a strange little accent, echoed the\n\"Amen.\"\n\nI looked round at Brother John. He had heard something and was utterly\novercome. Fortunately enough he could not move or even speak.\n\n\"Hold him,\" I whispered to Stephen and Mavovo, \"while I go in and talk\nto these ladies.\"\n\nThen, handing the rifle to Hans, I took off my hat, pushed the gate\na little wider open, slipped through it and called attention to my\npresence by coughing.\n\nThe two women, who had risen from their knees, stared at me as though\nthey saw a ghost.\n\n\"Ladies,\" I said, bowing, \"pray do not be alarmed. You see God Almighty\nsometimes answers prayers. In short, I am one of--a party--of white\npeople who, with some trouble, have succeeded in getting to this place\nand--and--would you allow us to call on you?\"\n\nStill they stared. At length the elder woman opened her lips.\n\n\"Here I am called the Mother of the Holy Flower, and for a stranger to\nspeak with the Mother is death. Also if you are a man, how did you reach\nus alive?\"\n\n\"That's a long story,\" I answered cheerfully. \"May we come in? We will\ntake the risks, we are accustomed to them and hope to be able to do you\na service. I should explain that three of us are white men, two English\nand one--American.\"\n\n\"American!\" she gasped, \"American! What is he like, and how is he\nnamed?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I replied, for my nerve was giving out and I grew confused, \"he is\noldish, with a white beard, rather like Father Christmas in short, and\nhis Christian name (I didn't dare to give it all at once) is--er--John,\nBrother John, we call him. Now I think of it,\" I added, \"he has some\nresemblance to your companion there.\"\n\nI thought that the lady was going to die, and cursed myself for my\nawkwardness. She flung her arm about the girl to save herself from\nfalling--a poor prop, for she, too, looked as though she were going\nto die, having understood some, if not all, of my talk. It must be\nremembered that this poor young thing had never even seen a white man\nbefore.\n\n\"Madam, madam,\" I expostulated, \"I pray you to bear up. After living\nthrough so much sorrow it would be foolish to decease of--joy. May\nI call in Brother John? He is a clergyman and might be able to say\nsomething appropriate, which I, who am only a hunter, cannot do.\"\n\nShe gathered herself together, opened her eyes and whispered:\n\n\"Send him here.\"\n\nI pushed open the gate behind which the others were clustered. Catching\nBrother John, who by now had recovered somewhat, by the arm, I dragged\nhim forward. The two stood staring at each other, and the young lady\nalso looked with wide eyes and open mouth.\n\n\"Elizabeth!\" said John.\n\nShe uttered a faint scream, then with a cry of \"_Husband!_\" flung\nherself upon his breast.\n\nI slipped through the gate and shut it fast.\n\n\n\n\"I say, Allan,\" said Stephen, when we had retreated to a little\ndistance, \"did you see her?\"\n\n\"Her? Who? Which?\" I asked.\n\n\"The young lady in the white clothes. She is lovely.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you donkey!\" I answered. \"Is this a time to talk of\nfemale looks?\"\n\nThen I went away behind the wall and literally wept for joy. It was one\nof the happiest moments of my life, for how seldom things happen as they\nshould!\n\nAlso I wanted to put up a little prayer of my own, a prayer of\nthankfulness and for strength and wit to overcome the many dangers that\nyet awaited us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n                     THE HOME OF THE HOLY FLOWER\n\nHalf an hour or so passed, during which I was engaged alternately in\nthinking over our position and in listening to Stephen's rhapsodies.\nFirst he dilated on the loveliness of the Holy Flower that he had caught\na glimpse of when he climbed the wall, and secondly, on the beauty of\nthe eyes of the young lady in white. Only by telling him that he might\noffend her did I persuade him not to attempt to break into the sacred\nenclosure where the orchid grew. As we were discussing the point, the\ngate opened and she appeared.\n\n\"Sirs,\" she said, with a reverential bow, speaking slowly and in\nthe drollest halting English, \"the mother and the father--yes, the\nfather--ask, will you feed?\"\n\nWe intimated that we would \"feed\" with much pleasure, and she led the\nway to the house, saying:\n\n\"Be not astonished at them, for they are very happy too, and please\nforgive our unleavened bread.\"\n\nThen in the politest way possible she took me by the hand, and followed\nby Stephen, we entered the house, leaving Mavovo and Hans to watch\noutside.\n\nIt consisted of but two rooms, one for living and one for sleeping. In\nthe former we found Brother John and his wife seated on a kind of couch\ngazing at each other in a rapt way. I noted that they both looked as\nthough they had been crying--with happiness, I suppose.\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" said John as we entered, \"this is Mr. Allan Quatermain,\nthrough whose resource and courage we have come together again, and this\nyoung gentleman is his companion, Mr. Stephen Somers.\"\n\nShe bowed, for she seemed unable to speak, and held out her hand, which\nwe shook.\n\n\"What be 'resource and courage'?\" I heard her daughter whisper to\nStephen, \"and why have you none, O Stephen Somers?\"\n\n\"It would take a long time to explain,\" he said with his jolly laugh,\nafter which I listened to no more of their nonsense.\n\nThen we sat down to the meal, which consisted of vegetables and a large\nbowl of hard-boiled ducks' eggs, of which eatables an ample supply was\ncarried out to Hans and Mavovo by Stephen and Hope. This, it seemed, was\nthe name that her mother had given to the girl when she was born in the\nhour of her black despair.\n\nIt was an extraordinary story that Mrs. Eversley had to tell, and yet a\nshort one.\n\nShe _had_ escaped from Hassan-ben-Mohammed and the slave-traders, as the\nrescued slave told her husband at Zanzibar before he died, and, after\ndays of wandering, been captured by some of the Pongo who were scouring\nthe country upon dark business of their own, probably in search of\ncaptives. They brought her across the lake to Pongo-land and, the former\nMother of the Flower, an albino, having died at a great age, installed\nher in the office on this island, which from that day she had never\nleft. Hither she was led by the Kalubi of the time and some others who\nhad \"passed the god.\" This brute, however, she had never seen, although\nonce she heard him roar, for it did not molest them or even appear upon\ntheir journey.\n\nShortly after her arrival on the island her daughter was born, on which\noccasion some of the women \"servants of the Flower\" nursed her. From\nthat moment both she and the child were treated with the utmost care and\nveneration, since the Mother of the Flower and the Flower itself being\nin some strange way looked upon as embodiments of the natural forces of\nfertility, this birth was held to be the best of omens for the dwindling\nPongo race. Also it was hoped that in due course the \"Child of the\nFlower\" would succeed the Mother in her office. So here they dwelt\nabsolutely helpless and alone, occupying themselves with superintending\nthe agriculture of the island. Most fortunately also when she was\ncaptured, Mrs. Eversley had a small Bible in her possession which she\nhad never lost. From this she was able to teach her child to read and\nall that is to be learned in the pages of Holy Writ.\n\nOften I have thought that if I were doomed to solitary confinement\nfor life and allowed but one book, I would choose the Bible, since,\nin addition to all its history and the splendour of its language,\nit contains the record of the hope of man, and therefore should be\nsufficient for him. So at least it had proved to be in this case.\n\nOddly enough, as she told us, like her husband, Mrs. Eversley during all\nthose endless years had never lost some kind of belief that she would\none day be saved otherwise than by death.\n\n\"I always thought that you still lived and that we should meet again,\nJohn,\" I heard her say to him.\n\nAlso her own and her daughter's spirits were mysteriously supported,\nfor after the first shock and disturbance of our arrival we found them\ncheerful people; indeed, Miss Hope was quite a merry soul. But then\nshe had never known any other life, and human nature is very adaptable.\nFurther, if I may say so, she had grown up a lady in the true sense of\nthe word. After all, why should she not, seeing that her mother,\nthe Bible and Nature had been her only associates and sources of\ninformation, if we except the poor slaves who waited on them, most of\nwhom were mutes.\n\nWhen Mrs. Eversley's story was done, we told ours, in a compressed form.\nIt was strange to see the wonder with which these two ladies listened to\nits outlines, but on that I need not dwell. When it was finished I heard\nMiss Hope say:\n\n\"So it would seem, O Stephen Somers, that it is you who are saviour to\nus.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered Stephen, \"but why?\"\n\n\"Because you see the dry Holy Flower far away in England, and you say,\n'I must be Holy Father to that Flower.' Then you pay down shekels (here\nher Bible reading came in) for the cost of journey and hire brave hunter\nto kill devil-god and bring my old white-head parent with you. Oh yes,\nyou are saviour,\" and she nodded her head at him very prettily.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Stephen with enthusiasm; \"that is, not exactly,\nbut it is all the same thing, as I will explain later. But, Miss Hope,\nmeanwhile could you show us the Flower?\"\n\n\"Oh! Holy Mother must do that. If you look thereon without her, you\ndie.\"\n\n\"Really!\" said Stephen, without alluding to his little feat of wall\nclimbing.\n\nWell, the end of it was that after a good deal of hesitation, the Holy\nMother obliged, saying that as the god was dead she supposed nothing\nelse mattered. First, however, she went to the back of the house and\nclapped her hands, whereon an old woman, a mute and a very perfect\nspecimen of an albino native, appeared and stared at us wonderingly.\nTo her Mrs. Eversley talked upon her fingers, so rapidly that I could\nscarcely follow her movements. The woman bowed till her forehead nearly\ntouched the ground, then rose and ran towards the water.\n\n\"I have sent her to fetch the paddles from the canoe,\" said Mrs.\nEversley, \"and to put my mark upon it. Now none will dare to use it to\ncross the lake.\"\n\n\"That is very wise,\" I replied, \"as we don't want news of our\nwhereabouts to get to the Motombo.\"\n\nNext we went to the enclosure, where Mrs. Eversley with a native knife\ncut a string of palm fibres that was sealed with clay on to the door\nand one of its uprights in such a fashion that none could enter without\nbreaking the string. The impression was made with a rude seal that she\nwore round her neck as a badge of office. It was a very curious object\nfashioned of gold and having deeply cut upon its face a rough image of\nan ape holding a flower in its right paw. As it was also ancient, this\nseemed to show that the monkey god and the orchid had been from the\nbeginning jointly worshipped by the Pongo.\n\nWhen she had opened the door, there appeared, growing in the centre of\nthe enclosure, the most lovely plant, I should imagine, that man ever\nsaw. It measured some eight feet across, and the leaves were dark green,\nlong and narrow. From its various crowns rose the scapes of bloom. And\noh! those blooms, of which there were about twelve, expanded now in the\nflowering season. The measurements made from the dried specimen I have\ngiven already, so I need not repeat them. I may say here, however, that\nthe Pongo augured the fertility or otherwise of each succeeding year\nfrom the number of the blooms on the Holy Flower. If these were many\nthe season would prove very fruitful; if few, less so; while if, as\nsometimes happened, the plant failed to flower, draught and famine were\nalways said to follow. Truly those were glorious blossoms, standing as\nhigh as a man, with their back sheaths of vivid white barred with black,\ntheir great pouches of burnished gold and their wide wings also of gold.\nThen in the centre of each pouch appeared the ink-mark that did indeed\nexactly resemble the head of a monkey. But if this orchid astonished me,\nits effect upon Stephen, with whom this class of flower was a mania, may\nbe imagined. Really he went almost mad. For a long while he glared at\nthe plant, and finally flung himself upon his knees, causing Miss Hope\nto exclaim:\n\n\"What, O Stephen Somers! do you also make sacrifice to the Holy Flower?\"\n\n\"Rather,\" he answered; \"I'd--I'd--die for it!\"\n\n\"You are likely to before all is done,\" I remarked with energy, for I\nhate to see a grown man make a fool of himself. There's only one thing\nin the world which justifies _that_, and it isn't a flower.\n\nMavovo and Hans had followed us into the enclosure, and I overheard a\nconversation between them which amused me. The gist of it was that Hans\nexplained to Mavovo that the white people admired this weed--he called\nit a weed--because it was like gold, which was the god they really\nworshipped, although that god was known among them by many names.\nMavovo, who was not at all interested in the affair, replied with a\nshrug that it might be so, though for his part he believed the true\nreason to be that the plant produced some medicine which gave courage or\nstrength. Zulus, I may say, do not care for flowers unless they bear a\nfruit that is good to eat.\n\nWhen I had satisfied myself with the splendour of these magnificent\nblooms, I asked Mrs. Eversley what certain little mounds might be that\nwere dotted about the enclosure, beyond the circle of cultivated peaty\nsoil which surrounded the orchid's roots.\n\n\"They are the graves of the Mothers of the Holy Flower,\" she answered.\n\"There are twelve of them, and here is the spot chosen for the\nthirteenth, which was to have been mine.\"\n\nTo change the subject I asked another question, namely: If there were\nmore such orchids growing in the country?\n\n\"No,\" she replied, \"or at least I never heard of any. Indeed, I have\nalways been told that this one was brought from far away generations\nago. Also, under an ancient law, it is never allowed to increase. Any\nshoots it sends up beyond this ring must be cut off by me and destroyed\nwith certain ceremonies. You see that seed-pod which has been left to\ngrow on the stalk of one of last year's blooms. It is now ripe, and on\nthe night of the next new moon, when the Kalubi comes to visit me,\nI must with much ritual burn it in his presence, unless it has burst\nbefore he arrives, in which case I must burn any seedlings that may\nspring up with almost the same ritual.\"\n\n\"I don't think the Kalubi will come any more; at least, not while you\nare here. Indeed, I am sure of it,\" I said.\n\nAs we were leaving the place, acting on my general principle of making\nsure of anything of value when I get the chance, I broke off that ripe\nseed-pod, which was of the size of an orange. No one was looking at the\ntime, and as it went straight into my pocket, no one missed it.\n\nThen, leaving Stephen and the young lady to admire this Cypripedium--or\neach other--in the enclosure, we three elders returned to the house to\ndiscuss matters.\n\n\"John and Mrs. Eversley,\" I said, \"by Heaven's mercy you are reunited\nafter a terrible separation of over twenty years. But what is to be\ndone now? The god, it is true, is dead, and therefore the passage of the\nforest will be easy. But beyond it is the water which we have no means\nof crossing and beyond the water that old wizard, the Motombo, sits in\nthe mouth of his cave watching like a spider in its web. And beyond\nthe Motombo and his cave are Komba, the new Kalubi and his tribe of\ncannibals----\"\n\n\"Cannibals!\" interrupted Mrs. Eversley, \"I never knew that they were\ncannibals. Indeed, I know little about the Pongo, whom I scarcely ever\nsee.\"\n\n\"Then, madam, you must take my word for it that they are; also, as I\nbelieve, that they have every expectation of eating _us_. Now, as I\npresume that you do not wish to spend the rest of your lives, which\nwould probably be short, upon this island, I want to ask how you propose\nto escape safely out of the Pongo country?\"\n\nThey shook their heads, which were evidently empty of ideas. Only John\nstroked his white beard, and inquired mildly:\n\n\"What have you arranged, Allan? My dear wife and I are quite willing to\nleave the matter to you, who are so resourceful.\"\n\n\"Arranged!\" I stuttered. \"Really, John, under any other\ncircumstances----\" Then after a moment's reflection I called to Hans and\nMavovo, who came and squatted down upon the verandah.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, after I had put the case to them, \"what have _you_\narranged?\" Being devoid of any feasible suggestions, I wished to pass on\nthat intolerable responsibility.\n\n\"My father makes a mock of us,\" said Mavovo solemnly. \"Can a rat in a\npit arrange how it is to get out with the dog that is waiting at the\ntop? So far we have come in safety, as the rat does into the pit. Now I\nsee nothing but death.\"\n\n\"That's cheerful,\" I said. \"Your turn, Hans.\"\n\n\"Oh! Baas,\" replied the Hottentot, \"for a while I grew clever again when\nI thought of putting the gun _Intombi_ into the bamboo. But now my head\nis like a rotten egg, and when I try to shake wisdom out of it my brain\nmelts and washes from side to side like the stuff in the rotten egg.\nYet, yet, I have a thought--let us ask the Missie. Her brain is young\nand not tired, it may hit on something: to ask the Baas Stephen is no\ngood, for already he is lost in other things,\" and Hans grinned feebly.\n\nMore to give myself time than for any other reason I called to Miss\nHope, who had just emerged from the sacred enclosure with Stephen, and\nput the riddle to her, speaking very slowly and clearly, so that she\nmight understand me. To my surprise she answered at once.\n\n\"What is a god, O Mr. Allen? Is it not more than man? Can a god be bound\nin a pit for a thousand years, like Satan in Bible? If a god want to\nmove, see new country and so on, who can say no?\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand,\" I said, to draw her out further, although,\nin fact, I had more than a glimmering of what she meant.\n\n\"O Allan, Holy Flower there a god, and my mother priestess. If Holy\nFlower tired of this land, and want to grow somewhere else, why\npriestess not carry it and go too?\"\n\n\"Capital idea,\" I said, \"but you see, Miss Hope, there are, or were, two\ngods, one of which cannot travel.\"\n\n\"Oh! that very easy, too. Put skin of god of the woods on to this man,\"\nand she pointed to Hans, \"and who know difference? They like as two\nbrothers already, only he smaller.\"\n\n\"She's got it! By Jingo, she's got it!\" exclaimed Stephen in admiration.\n\n\"What Missie say?\" asked Hans, suspiciously.\n\nI told him.\n\n\"Oh! Baas,\" exclaimed Hans, \"think of the smell inside of that god's\nskin when the sun shines on it. Also the god was a very big god, and I\nam small.\"\n\nThen he turned and made a proposal to Mavovo, explaining that his\nstature was much better suited to the job.\n\n\"First will I die,\" answered the great Zulu. \"Am I, who have high blood\nin my veins and who am a warrior, to defile myself by wrapping the skin\nof a dead brute about me and appear as an ape before men? Propose it to\nme again, Spotted Snake, and we shall quarrel.\"\n\n\"See here, Hans,\" I said. \"Mavovo is right. He is a soldier and very\nstrong in battle. You also are very strong in your wits, and by doing\nthis you will make fools of all the Pongo. Also, Hans, it is better that\nyou should wear the skin of a gorilla for a few hours than that I, your\nmaster, and all these should be killed.\"\n\n\"Yes, Baas, it is true, Baas; though for myself I almost think that,\nlike Mavovo, I would rather die. Yet it would be sweet to deceive those\nPongo once again, and, Baas, I won't see you killed just to save myself\nanother bad smell or two. So, if you wish it, I will become a god.\"\n\nThus through the self-sacrifice of that good fellow, Hans, who is the\nreal hero of this history, that matter was settled, if anything could\nbe looked on as settled in our circumstances. Then we arranged that\nwe would start upon our desperate adventure at dawn on the following\nmorning.\n\nMeanwhile, much remained to be done. First, Mrs. Eversley summoned her\nattendants, who, to the number of twelve, soon appeared in front of\nthe verandah. It was very sad to see these poor women, all of whom were\nalbinos and unpleasant to look on, while quite half appeared to be deaf\nand dumb. To these, speaking as a priestess, she explained that the god\nwho dwelt in the woods was dead, and that therefore she must take the\nHoly Flower, which was called \"Wife of the god\" and make report to the\nMotombo of this dreadful catastrophe. Meanwhile, they must remain on the\nisland and continue to cultivate the fields.\n\nThis order threw the poor creatures, who were evidently much attached\nto their mistress and her daughter, into a great state of consternation.\nThe eldest of them all, a tall, thin old lady with white wool and pink\neyes who looked, as Stephen said, like an Angora rabbit, prostrated\nherself and kissing the Mother's foot, asked when she would return,\nsince she and the \"Daughter of the Flower\" were all they had to love,\nand without them they would die of grief.\n\nSuppressing her evident emotion as best she could, the Mother replied\nthat she did not know; it depended on the will of Heaven and the\nMotombo. Then to prevent further argument she bade them bring their\npicks with which they worked the land; also poles, mats, and\npalmstring, and help to dig up the Holy Flower. This was done under\nthe superintendence of Stephen, who here was thoroughly in his element,\nalthough the job proved far from easy. Also it was sad, for all these\nwomen wept as they worked, while some of them who were not dumb, wailed\naloud.\n\nEven Miss Hope cried, and I could see that her mother was affected with\na kind of awe. For twenty years she had been guardian of this plant,\nwhich I think she had at last not unnaturally come to look upon with\nsome of the same veneration that was felt for it by the whole Pongo\npeople.\n\n\"I fear,\" she said, \"lest this sacrilege should bring misfortune upon\nus.\"\n\nBut Brother John, who held very definite views upon African\nsuperstitions, quoted the second commandment to her, and she became\nsilent.\n\nWe got the thing up at last, or most of it, with a sufficiency of\nearth to keep it alive, injuring the roots as little as possible in the\nprocess. Underneath it, at a depth of about three feet, we found several\nthings. One of these was an ancient stone fetish that was rudely shaped\nto the likeness of a monkey and wore a gold crown. This object, which\nwas small, I still have. Another was a bed of charcoal, and amongst the\ncharcoal were some partially burnt bones, including a skull that was\nvery little injured. This may have belonged to a woman of a low type,\nperhaps the first Mother of the Flower, but its general appearance\nreminded me of that of a gorilla. I regret that there was neither time\nnor light to enable me to make a proper examination of these remains,\nwhich we found it impossible to bring away.\n\nMrs. Eversley told me afterwards, however, that the Kalubis had a\ntradition that the god once possessed a wife which died before the Pongo\nmigrated to their present home. If so, these may have been the bones of\nthat wife. When it was finally clear of the ground on which it had grown\nfor so many generations, the great plant was lifted on to a large mat,\nand after it had been packed with wet moss by Stephen in a most skilful\nway, for he was a perfect artist at this kind of work, the mat was\nbound round the roots in such a fashion that none of the contents could\nescape. Also each flower scape was lashed to a thin bamboo so as to\nprevent it from breaking on the journey. Then the whole bundle was\nlifted on to a kind of bamboo stretcher that we made and firmly secured\nto it with palm-fibre ropes.\n\nBy this time it was growing dark and all of us were tired.\n\n\"Baas,\" said Hans to me, as we were returning to the house, \"would it\nnot be well that Mavovo and I should take some food and go sleep in the\ncanoe? These women will not hurt us there, but if we do not, I, who have\nbeen watching them, fear lest in the night they should make paddles of\nsticks and row across the lake to warn the Pongo.\"\n\nAlthough I did not like separating our small party, I thought the idea\nso good that I consented to it, and presently Hans and Mavovo, armed\nwith spears and carrying an ample supply of food, departed to the lake\nside.\n\nOne more incident has impressed itself upon my memory in connection with\nthat night. It was the formal baptism of Hope by her father. I never saw\na more touching ceremony, but it is one that I need not describe.\n\nStephen and I slept in the enclosure by the packed flower, which he\nwould not leave out of his sight. It was as well that we did so, since\nabout twelve o'clock by the light of the moon I saw the door in the wall\nopen gently and the heads of some of the albino women appear through\nthe aperture. Doubtless, they had come to steal away the holy plant they\nworshipped. I sat up, coughed, and lifted the rifle, whereon they fled\nand returned no more.\n\nLong before dawn Brother John, his wife and daughter were up and making\npreparations for the march, packing a supply of food and so forth.\nIndeed, we breakfasted by moonlight, and at the first break of day,\nafter Brother John had first offered up a prayer for protection,\ndeparted on our journey.\n\nIt was a strange out-setting, and I noted that both Mrs. Eversley and\nher daughter seemed sad at bidding good-bye to the spot where they had\ndwelt in utter solitude and peace for so many years; where one of them,\nindeed, had been born and grown up to womanhood. However, I kept on\ntalking to distract their thoughts, and at last we were off.\n\nI arranged that, although it was heavy for them, the two ladies, whose\nwhite robes were covered with curious cloaks made of soft prepared bark,\nshould carry the plant as far as the canoe, thinking it was better that\nthe Holy Flower should appear to depart in charge of its consecrated\nguardians. I went ahead with the rifle, then came the stretcher and the\nflower, while Brother John and Stephen, carrying the paddles, brought up\nthe rear. We reached the canoe without accident, and to our great relief\nfound Mavovo and Hans awaiting us. I learned, however, that it was\nfortunate they had slept in the boat, since during the night the albino\nwomen arrived with the evident object of possessing themselves of it,\nand only ran away when they saw that it was guarded. As we were making\nready the canoe those unhappy slaves appeared in a body and throwing\nthemselves upon their faces with piteous words, or those of them who\ncould not speak, by signs, implored the Mother not to desert them, till\nboth she and Hope began to cry. But there was no help for it, so we\npushed off as quickly as we could, leaving the albinos weeping and\nwailing upon the bank.\n\nI confess that I, too, felt compunction at abandoning them thus, but\nwhat could we do? I only trust that no harm came to them, but of course\nwe never heard anything as to their fate.\n\nOn the further side of the lake we hid away the canoe in the bushes\nwhere we had found it, and began our march. Stephen and Mavovo, being\nthe two strongest among us, now carried the plant, and although Stephen\nnever murmured at its weight, how the Zulu did swear after the first few\nhours! I could fill a page with his objurgations at what he considered\nan act of insanity, and if I had space, should like to do so, for really\nsome of them were most amusing. Had it not been for his friendship for\nStephen I think that he would have thrown it down.\n\nWe crossed the Garden of the god, where Mrs. Eversley told me the Kalubi\nmust scatter the sacred seed twice a year, thus confirming the story\nthat we had heard. It seems that it was then, as he made his long\njourney through the forest, that the treacherous and horrid brute which\nwe had killed, would attack the priest of whom it had grown weary. But,\nand this shows the animal's cunning, the onslaught always took place\n_after_ he had sown the seed which would in due season produce the food\nit ate. Our Kalubi, it is true, was killed before we had reached the\nGarden, which seems an exception to the rule. Perhaps, however, the\ngorilla knew that his object in visiting it was not to provide for its\nneeds. Or perhaps our presence excited it to immediate action.\n\nWho can analyse the motives of a gorilla?\n\nThese attacks were generally spread over a year and a half. On the first\noccasion the god which always accompanied the priest to the garden and\nback again, would show animosity by roaring at him. On the second he\nwould seize his hand and bite off one of the fingers, as happened to our\nKalubi, a wound that generally caused death from blood poisoning. If,\nhowever, the priest survived, on the third visit it killed him, for the\nmost part by crushing his head in its mighty jaws. When making these\nvisits the Kalubi was accompanied by certain dedicated youths, some of\nwhom the god always put to death. Those who had made the journey six\ntimes without molestation were selected for further special trials,\nuntil at last only two remained who were declared to have \"passed\" or\n\"been accepted by\" the god. These youths were treated with great honour,\nas in the instance of Komba and on the destruction of the Kalubi, one of\nthem took his office, which he generally filled without much accident,\nfor a minimum of ten years, and perhaps much longer.\n\nMrs. Eversley knew nothing of the sacramental eating of the remains of\nthe Kalubi, or of the final burial of his bones in the wooden coffins\nthat we had seen, for such things, although they undoubtedly happened,\nwere kept from her. She added, that each of the three Kalubis whom she\nhad known, ultimately went almost mad through terror at his approaching\nend, especially after the preliminary roarings and the biting off of the\nfinger. In truth uneasy lay the head that wore a crown in Pongo-land,\na crown that, mind you, might not be refused upon pain of death by\ntorture. Personally, I can imagine nothing more terrible than the\nhaunted existence of these poor kings whose pomp and power must\nterminate in such a fashion.\n\nI asked her whether the Motombo ever visited the god. She answered, Yes,\nonce in every five years. Then after many mystic ceremonies he spent a\nweek in the forest at a time of full moon. One of the Kalubis had told\nher that on this occasion he had seen the Motombo and the god sitting\ntogether under a tree, each with his arm round the other's neck and\napparently talking \"like brothers.\" With the exception of certain tales\nof its almost supernatural cunning, this was all that I could learn\nabout the god of the Pongos which I have sometimes been tempted to\nbelieve was really a devil hid in the body of a huge and ancient ape.\n\nNo, there was one more thing which I quote because it bears out\nBabemba's story. It seems that captives from other tribes were sometimes\nturned into the forest that the god might amuse itself by killing them.\nThis, indeed, was the fate to which we ourselves had been doomed in\naccordance with the hateful Pongo custom.\n\nCertainly, thought I to myself when she had done, I did a good deed in\nsending that monster to whatever dim region it was destined to inhabit,\nwhere I sincerely trust it found all the dead Kalubis and its other\nvictims ready to give it an appropriate welcome.\n\n\n\nAfter crossing the god's garden, we came to the clearing of the Fallen\nTree, and found the brute's skin pegged out as we had left it, though\nshrunken in size. Only it had evidently been visited by a horde of the\nforest ants which, fortunately for Hans, had eaten away every particle\nof flesh, while leaving the hide itself absolutely untouched, I suppose\nbecause it was too tough for them. I never saw a neater job. Moreover,\nthese industrious little creatures had devoured the beast itself.\nNothing remained of it except the clean, white bones lying in the exact\nposition in which we had left the carcase. Atom by atom that marching\nmyriad army had eaten all and departed on its way into the depths of the\nforest, leaving this sign of their passage.\n\nHow I wished that we could carry off the huge skeleton to add to my\ncollection of trophies, but this was impossible. As Brother John said,\nany museum would have been glad to purchase it for hundreds of pounds,\nfor I do not suppose that its like exists in the world. But it was too\nheavy; all I could do was to impress its peculiarities upon my mind by\na close study of the mighty bones. Also I picked out of the upper right\narm, and kept the bullet I had fired when it carried off the Kalubi.\nThis I found had sunk into and shattered the bone, but without\nabsolutely breaking it.\n\nOn we went again bearing with us the god's skin, having first stuffed\nthe head, hands and feet (these, I mean the hands and feet, had been\ncleaned out by the ants) with wet moss in order to preserve their shape.\nIt was no light burden, at least so declared Brother John and Hans, who\nbore it between them upon a dead bough from the fallen tree.\n\nOf the rest of our journey to the water's edge there is nothing to tell,\nexcept that notwithstanding our loads, we found it easier to walk down\nthat steep mountain side than it had been to ascend the same. Still our\nprogress was but slow, and when at length we reached the burying-place\nonly about an hour remained to sunset. There we sat down to rest and\neat, also to discuss the situation.\n\nWhat was to be done? The arm of stagnant water lay near to us, but we\nhad no boat with which to cross to the further shore. And what was that\nshore? A cave where a creature who seemed to be but half-human, sat\nwatching like a spider in its web. Do not let it be supposed that this\nquestion of escape had been absent from our minds. On the contrary, we\nhad even thought of trying to drag the canoe in which we crossed to\nand from the island of the Flower through the forest. The idea was\nabandoned, however, because we found that being hollowed from a single\nlog with a bottom four or five inches thick, it was impossible for us to\ncarry it so much as fifty yards. What then could we do without a boat?\nSwimming seemed to be out of the question because of the crocodiles.\nAlso on inquiry I discovered that of the whole party Stephen and I alone\ncould swim. Further there was no wood of which to make a raft.\n\nI called to Hans and leaving the rest in the graveyard where we knew\nthat they were safe, we went down to the edge of the water to study the\nsituation, being careful to keep ourselves hidden behind the reeds and\nbushes of the mangrove tribe with which it was fringed. Not that there\nwas much fear of our being seen, for the day, which had been very hot,\nwas closing in and a great storm, heralded by black and bellying\nclouds, was gathering fast, conditions which must render us practically\ninvisible at a distance.\n\nWe looked at the dark, slimy water--also at the crocodiles which\nsat upon its edge in dozens waiting, eternally waiting, for what, I\nwondered. We looked at the sheer opposing cliff, but save where a black\nhole marked the cave mouth, far as the eye could see, the water came\nup against it, as that of a moat does against the wall of a castle.\nObviously, therefore, the only line of escape ran through this cave,\nfor, as I have explained, the channel by which I presume Babemba reached\nthe open lake, was now impracticable. Lastly, we searched to see if\nthere was any fallen log upon which we could possibly propel ourselves\nto the other side, and found--nothing that could be made to serve, no,\nnor, as I have said, any dry reeds or brushwood out of which we might\nfashion a raft.\n\n\"Unless we can get a boat, here we must stay,\" I remarked to Hans, who\nwas seated with me behind a screen of rushes at the water's edge.\n\nHe made no answer, and as I thought, in a sort of subconscious way,\nI engaged myself in watching a certain tragedy of the insect world.\nBetween two stout reeds a forest spider of the very largest sort had\nspun a web as big as a lady's open parasol. There in the midst of this\nweb of which the bottom strands almost touched the water, sat the spider\nwaiting for its prey, as the crocodiles were waiting on the banks, as\nthe great ape had waited for the Kalubis, as Death waits for Life, as\nthe Motombo was waiting for God knows what.\n\nIt rather resembled the Motombo in his cave, did that huge, black\nspider with just a little patch of white upon its head, or so I thought\nfancifully enough. Then came the tragedy. A great, white moth of the\nHawk species began to dart to and fro between the reeds, and presently\nstruck the web on its lower side some three inches above the water. Like\na flash that spider was upon it. It embraced the victim with its long\nlegs to still its tremendous battlings. Next, descending below, it began\nto make the body fast, when something happened. From the still surface\nof the water beneath poked up the mouth of a very large fish which quite\nquietly closed upon the spider and sank again into the depths, taking\nwith it a portion of the web and thereby setting the big moth free.\nWith a struggle it loosed itself, fell on to a piece of wood and floated\naway, apparently little the worse for the encounter.\n\n\"Did you see that, Baas?\" said Hans, pointing to the broken and empty\nweb. \"While you were thinking, I was praying to your reverend father the\nPredikant, who taught me how to do it, and he has sent us a sign from\nthe Place of Fire.\"\n\nEven then I could not help laughing to myself as I pictured what my\ndear father's face would be like if he were able to hear his convert's\nremarks. An analysis of Hans's religious views would be really\ninteresting, and I only regret that I never made one. But sticking to\nbusiness I merely asked:\n\n\"What sign?\"\n\n\"Baas, this sign: That web is the Motombo's cave. The big spider is the\nMotombo. The white moth is us, Baas, who are caught in the web and going\nto be eaten.\"\n\n\"Very pretty, Hans,\" I said, \"but what is the fish that came up and\nswallowed the spider so that the moth fell on the wood and floated\naway?\"\n\n\"Baas, _you_ are the fish, who come up softly, softly out of the water\nin the dark, and shoot the Motombo with the little rifle, and then the\nrest of us, who are the moth, fall into the canoe and float away. There\nis a storm about to break, Baas, and who will see you swim the stream in\nthe storm and the night?\"\n\n\"The crocodiles,\" I suggested.\n\n\"Baas, I didn't see a crocodile eat the fish. I think the fish is\nlaughing down there with the fat spider in its stomach. Also when\nthere is a storm crocodiles go to bed because they are afraid lest the\nlightning should kill them for their sins.\"\n\nNow I remembered that I had often heard, and indeed to some extent\nnoted, that these great reptiles do vanish in disturbed weather,\nprobably because their food hides away. However that might be, in an\ninstant I made up my mind.\n\nAs soon as it was quite dark I would swim the water, holding the little\nrifle, _Intombi_, above my head, and try to steal the canoe. If the old\nwizard was watching, which I hoped might not be the case, well, I\nmust deal with him as best I could. I knew the desperate nature of the\nexpedient, but there was no other way. If we could not get a boat we\nmust remain in that foodless forest until we starved. Or if we returned\nto the island of the Flower, there ere long we should certainly be\nattacked and destroyed by Komba and the Pongos when they came to look\nfor our bodies.\n\n\"I'll try it, Hans,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, Baas, I thought you would. I'd come, too, only I can't swim and\nwhen I was drowning I might make a noise, because one forgets oneself\nthen, Baas. But it will be all right, for if it were otherwise I am sure\nthat your reverend father would have shown us so in the sign. The moth\nfloated off quite comfortably on the wood, and just now I saw it spread\nits wings and fly away. And the fish, ah! how he laughs with that fat\nold spider in his stomach!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n                              FATE STABS\n\nWe went back to the others whom we found crouched on the ground among\nthe coffins, looking distinctly depressed. No wonder; night was closing\nin, the thunder was beginning to growl and echo through the forest and\nrain to fall in big drops. In short, although Stephen remarked that\nevery cloud has a silver lining, a proverb which, as I told him, I\nseemed to have heard before, in no sense could the outlook be considered\nbright.\n\n\"Well, Allan, what have you arranged?\" asked Brother John, with a faint\nattempt at cheerfulness as he let go of his wife's hand. In those days\nhe always seemed to be holding his wife's hand.\n\n\"Oh!\" I answered, \"I am going to get the canoe so that we can all row\nover comfortably.\"\n\nThey stared at me, and Miss Hope, who was seated by Stephen, asked in\nher usual Biblical language:\n\n\"Have you the wings of a dove that you can fly, O Mr. Allan?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"but I have the fins of a fish, or something like\nthem, and I can swim.\"\n\nNow there arose a chorus of expostulation.\n\n\"You shan't risk it,\" said Stephen, \"I can swim as well as you and I'm\nyounger. I'll go, I want a bath.\"\n\n\"That you will have, O Stephen,\" interrupted Miss Hope, as I thought in\nsome alarm. \"The latter rain from heaven will make you clean.\" (By now\nit was pouring.)\n\n\"Yes, Stephen, you can swim,\" I said, \"but you will forgive me for\nsaying that you are not particularly deadly with a rifle, and clean\nshooting may be the essence of this business. Now listen to me, all of\nyou. I am going. I hope that I shall succeed, but if I fail it does not\nso very much matter, for you will be no worse off than you were before.\nThere are three pairs of you. John and his wife; Stephen and Miss Hope;\nMavovo and Hans. If the odd man of the party comes to grief, you will\nhave to choose a new captain, that is all, but while I lead I mean to be\nobeyed.\"\n\nThen Mavovo, to whom Hans had been talking, spoke.\n\n\"My father Macumazana is a brave man. If he lives he will have done his\nduty. If he dies he will have done his duty still better, and, on the\nearth or in the under-world among the spirits of our fathers, his name\nshall be great for ever; yes, his name shall be a song.\"\n\nWhen Brother John had translated these words, which I thought fine,\nthere was silence.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"come with me to the water's edge, all of you. You will\nbe in less danger from the lightning there, where are no tall trees.\nAnd while I am gone, do you ladies dress up Hans in that gorilla-skin\nas best you can, lacing it on to him with some of that palm-fibre string\nwhich we brought with us, and filling out the hollows and the head with\nleaves or reeds. I want him to be ready when I come back with the canoe.\n\nHans groaned audibly, but made no objection and we started with our\nimpedimenta down to the edge of the estuary where we hid behind a clump\nof mangrove bushes and tall, feathery reeds. Then I took off some of my\nclothes, stripping in fact to my flannel shirt and the cotton pants I\nwore, both of which were grey in colour and therefore almost invisible\nat night.\n\nNow I was ready and Hans handed me the little rifle.\n\n\"It is at full cock, Baas, with the catch on,\" he said, \"and carefully\nloaded. Also I have wrapped the lining of my hat, which is very full of\ngrease, for the hair makes grease especially in hot weather, Baas, round\nthe lock to keep away the wet from the cap and powder. It is not tied,\nBaas, only twisted. Give the rifle a shake and it will fall off.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I said, and gripped the gun with my left hand by the\ntongue just forward of the hammer, in such a fashion that the horrid\ngreased rag from Hans's hat was held tight over the lock and cap. Then\nI shook hands with the others and when I came to Miss Hope I am proud to\nadd that she spontaneously and of her own accord imprinted a kiss upon\nmy mediaeval brow. I felt inclined to return it, but did not.\n\n\"It is the kiss of peace, O Allan,\" she said. \"May you go and return in\npeace.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said, \"but get on with dressing Hans in his new clothes.\"\n\nStephen muttered something about feeling ashamed of himself. Brother\nJohn put up a vigorous and well-directed prayer. Mavovo saluted with the\ncopper assegai and began to give me _sibonga_ or Zulu titles of praise\nbeneath his breath, and Mrs. Eversley said:\n\n\"Oh! I thank God that I have lived to see a brave English gentleman\nagain,\" which I thought a great compliment to my nation and myself,\nthough when I afterwards discovered that she herself was English by\nbirth, it took off some of the polish.\n\nNext, just after a vivid flash of lightning, for the storm had broken in\nearnest now, I ran swiftly to the water's edge, accompanied by Hans, who\nwas determined to see the last of me.\n\n\"Get back, Hans, before the lightning shows you,\" I said, as I slid\ngently from a mangrove-root into that filthy stream, \"and tell them to\nkeep my coat and trousers dry if they can.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Baas,\" he murmured, and I heard that he was sobbing. \"Keep a\ngood heart, O Baas of Baases. After all, this is nothing to the vultures\nof the Hill of Slaughter. _Intombi_ pulled us through then, and so she\nwill again, for she knows who can hold her straight!\"\n\nThat was the last I heard of Hans, for if he said any more, the hiss of\nthe torrential rain smothered his words.\n\nOh! I had tried to \"keep a good heart\" before the others, but it is\nbeyond my powers to describe the deadly fright I felt, perhaps the worst\nof all my life, which is saying a great deal. Here I was starting on one\nof the maddest ventures that was ever undertaken by man. I needn't put\nits points again, but that which appealed to me most at the moment\nwas the crocodiles. I have always hated crocodiles since--well, never\nmind--and the place was as full of them as the ponds at Ascension are of\nturtles.\n\nStill I swam on. The estuary was perhaps two hundred yards wide, not\nmore, no great distance for a good swimmer as I was in those days. But\nthen I had to hold the rifle above the water with my left hand at\nall cost, for if once it went beneath it would be useless. Also I was\ndesperately afraid of being seen in the lightning flashes, although to\nminimise this risk I had kept my dark-coloured cloth hat upon my head.\nLastly there was the lightning itself to fear, for it was fearful and\ncontinuous and seemed to be striking along the water. It was a fact that\na fire-ball or something of the sort hit the surface within a few yards\nof me, as though it had aimed at the rifle-barrel and just missed. Or so\nI thought, though it may have been a crocodile rising at the moment.\n\nIn one way, or rather, in two, however, I was lucky. The first was the\ncomplete absence of wind which must have raised waves that might have\nswamped me and would at any rate have wetted the rifle. The second was\nthat there was no fear of my losing my path for in the mouth of the cave\nI could see the glow of the fires which burned on either side of the\nMotombo's seat. They served the same purpose to me as did the lamp of\nthe lady called Hero to her lover Leander when he swam the Hellespont\nto pay her clandestine visits at night. But he had something pleasant to\nlook forward to, whereas I----! Still, there was another point in common\nbetween us. Hero, if I remember right, was a priestess of the Greek\ngoddess of love, whereas the party who waited me was also in a religious\nline of business. Only, as I firmly believe, he was a priest of the\ndevil.\n\nI suppose that swim took me about a quarter-of-an-hour, for I went\nslowly to save my strength, although the crocodiles suggested haste. But\nthank Heaven they never appeared to complicate matters. Now I was quite\nnear the cave, and now I was beneath the overhanging roof and in the\nshallow water of the little bay that formed a harbour for the canoe. I\nstood upon my feet on the rock bottom, the water coming up to my breast,\nand peered about me, while I rested and worked my left arm, stiff with\nthe up-holding of the gun, to and fro. The fires had burnt somewhat low\nand until my eyes were freed from the raindrops and grew accustomed to\nthe light of the place I could not see clearly.\n\nI took the rag from round the lock of the rifle, wiped the wet off the\nbarrel with it and let it fall. Then I loosed the catch and by touching\na certain mechanism, made the rifle hair-triggered. Now I looked again\nand began to make out things. There was the platform and there, alas! on\nit sat the toad-like Motombo. But his back was to me; he was gazing\nnot towards the water, but down the cave. I hesitated for one fateful\nmoment. Perhaps the priest was asleep, perhaps I could get the canoe\naway without shooting. I did not like the job; moreover, his head was\nheld forward and invisible, and how was I to make certain of killing him\nwith a shot in the back? Lastly, if possible, I wished to avoid firing\nbecause of the report.\n\nAt that instant the Motombo wheeled round. Some instinct must have\nwarned him of my presence, for the silence was gravelike save for the\nsoft splash of the rain without. As he turned the lightning blazed and\nhe saw me.\n\n\"It is the white man,\" he muttered to himself in his hissing whisper,\nwhile I waited through the following darkness with the rifle at my\nshoulder, \"the white man who shot me long, long ago, and again he has a\ngun! Oh! Fate stabs, doubtless the god is dead and I too must die!\"\n\nThen as if some doubt struck him he lifted the horn to summon help.\n\nAgain the lightning flashed and was accompanied by a fearful crack of\nthunder. With a prayer for skill, I covered his head and fired by the\nglare of it just as the trumpet touched his lips. It fell from his hand.\nHe seemed to shrink together, and moved no more.\n\nOh! thank God, thank God! in this supreme moment of trial the art of\nwhich I am a master had not failed me. If my hand had shaken ever so\nlittle, if my nerves, strained to breaking point, had played me false\nin the least degree, if the rag from Hans's hat had not sufficed to keep\naway the damp from the cap and powder! Well, this history would never\nhave been written and there would have been some more bones in the\ngraveyard of the Kalubis, that is all!\n\nFor a moment I waited, expecting to see the women attendants dart from\nthe doorways in the sides of the cave, and to hear them sound a shrill\nalarm. None appeared, and I guessed that the rattle of the thunder had\nswallowed up the crack of the rifle, a noise, be it remembered, that\nnone of them had ever heard. For an unknown number of years this ancient\ncreature, I suppose, had squatted day and night upon that platform,\nwhence, I daresay, it was difficult for him to move. So after they had\nwrapped his furs round him at sunset and made up the fires to keep him\nwarm, why should his women come to disturb him unless he called them\nwith his horn? Probably it was not even lawful that they should do so.\n\nSomewhat reassured I waded forward a few paces and loosed the canoe\nwhich was tied by the prow. Then I scrambled into it, and laying down\nthe rifle, took one of the paddles and began to push out of the creek.\nJust then the lightning flared once more, and by it I caught sight of\nthe Motombo's face that was now within a few feet of my own. It seemed\nto be resting almost on his knees, and its appearance was dreadful. In\nthe centre of the forehead was a blue mark where the bullet had entered,\nfor I had made no mistake in that matter. The deep-set round eyes were\nopen and, all their fire gone, seemed to stare at me from beneath the\noverhanging brows. The massive jaw had fallen and the red tongue hung\nout upon the pendulous lip. The leather-like skin of the bloated cheeks\nhad assumed an ashen hue still streaked and mottled with brown.\n\nOh! the thing was horrible, and sometimes when I am out of sorts, it\nhaunts me to this day. Yet that creature's blood does not lie heavy on\nmy mind, of it my conscience is not afraid. His end was necessary to\nsave the innocent and I am sure that it was well deserved. For he was a\ndevil, akin to the great god ape I had slain in the forest, to whom, by\nthe way, he bore a most remarkable resemblance in death. Indeed if their\nheads had been laid side by side at a little distance, it would not have\nbeen too easy to tell them apart with their projecting brows, beardless,\nretreating chins and yellow tushes at the corners of the mouth.\n\nPresently I was clear of the cave. Still for a while I lay to at one\nside of it against the towering cliff, both to listen in case what I\nhad done should be discovered, and for fear lest the lightning which was\nstill bright, although the storm centre was rapidly passing away, should\nreveal me to any watchers.\n\nFor quite ten minutes I hid thus, and then, determining to risk it,\npaddled softly towards the opposite bank keeping, however, a little\nto the west of the cave and taking my line by a certain very tall tree\nwhich, as I had noted, towered up against the sky at the back of the\ngraveyard.\n\nAs it happened my calculations were accurate and in the end I directed\nthe bow of the canoe into the rushes behind which I had left my\ncompanions. Just then the moon began to struggle out through the\nthinning rain-clouds, and by its light they saw me, and I saw what for\na moment I took to be the gorilla-god himself waddling forward to seize\nthe boat. There was the dreadful brute exactly as he had appeared in the\nforest, except that it seemed a little smaller.\n\nThen I remembered and laughed and that laugh did me a world of good.\n\n\"Is that you, Baas?\" said a muffled voice, speaking apparently from the\nmiddle of the gorilla. \"Are you safe, Baas?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I answered, \"or how should I be here?\" adding cheerfully,\n\"Are you comfortable in that nice warm skin on this wet night, Hans?\"\n\n\"Oh! Baas,\" answered the voice, \"tell me what happened. Even in this\nstink I burn to know.\"\n\n\"Death happened to the Motombo, Hans. Here, Stephen, give me your hand\nand my clothes, and, Mavovo, hold the rifle and the canoe while I put\nthem on.\"\n\nThen I landed and stepping into the reeds, pulled off my wet shirt and\npants, which I stuffed away into the big pockets of my shooting coat,\nfor I did not want to lose them, and put on the dry things that,\nalthough scratchy, were quite good enough clothing in that warm climate.\nAfter this I treated myself to a good sup of brandy from the flask, and\nate some food which I seemed to require. Then I told them the story, and\ncutting short their demonstrations of wonder and admiration, bade them\nplace the Holy Flower in the canoe and get in themselves. Next with the\nhelp of Hans who poked out his fingers through the skin of the gorilla's\narms, I carefully re-loaded the rifle, setting the last cap on the\nnipple. This done, I joined them in the canoe, taking my seat in the\nprow and bidding Brother John and Stephen paddle.\n\nMaking a circuit to avoid observation as before, in a very short time\nwe reached the mouth of the cave. I leant forward and peeped round the\nwestern wall of rock. Nobody seemed to be stirring. There the fires\nburned dimly, there the huddled shape of the Motombo still crouched\nupon the platform. Silently, silently we disembarked, and I formed our\nprocession while the others looked askance at the horrible face of the\ndead Motombo.\n\nI headed it, then came the Mother of the Flower, followed by Hans,\nplaying his part of the god of the forest; then Brother John and Stephen\ncarrying the Holy Flower. After it walked Hope, while Mavovo brought up\nthe rear. Near to one of the fires, as I had noted on our first passage\nof the cave, lay a pile of the torches which I have already mentioned.\nWe lit some of them, and at a sign from me, Mavovo dragged the canoe\nback into its little dock and tied the cord to its post. Its appearance\nthere, apparently undisturbed, might, I thought, make our crossing of\nthe water seem even more mysterious. All this while I watched the doors\nin the sides of the cave, expecting every moment to see the women rush\nout. But none came. Perhaps they slept, or perhaps they were absent; I\ndo not know to this day.\n\nWe started, and in solemn silence threaded our way down the windings\nof the cave, extinguishing our torches as soon as we saw light at its\ninland outlet. At a few paces from its mouth stood a sentry. His\nback was towards the cave, and in the uncertain gleams of the moon,\nstruggling with the clouds, for a thin rain still fell, he never noted\nus till we were right on to him. Then he turned and saw, and at the\nawful sight of this procession of the gods of his land, threw up his\narms, and without a word fell senseless. Although I never asked, I think\nthat Mavovo took measures to prevent his awakening. At any rate when I\nlooked back later on, I observed that he was carrying a big Pongo spear\nwith a long shaft, instead of the copper weapon which he had taken from\none of the coffins.\n\nOn we marched towards Rica Town, following the easy path by which we had\ncome. As I have said, the country was very deserted and the inhabitants\nof such huts as we passed were evidently fast asleep. Also there were no\ndogs in this land to awake them with their barking. Between the cave and\nRica we were not, I think, seen by a single soul.\n\nThrough that long night we pushed on as fast was we could travel, only\nstopping now and again for a few minutes to rest the bearers of the Holy\nFlower. Indeed at times Mrs. Eversley relieved her husband at this\ntask, but Stephen, being very strong, carried his end of the stretcher\nthroughout the whole journey.\n\nHans, of course, was much oppressed by the great weight of the gorilla\nskin, which, although it had shrunk a good deal, remained as heavy as\never. But he was a tough old fellow, and on the whole got on better than\nmight have been expected, though by the time we reached the town he\nwas sometimes obliged to follow the example of the god itself and\nhelp himself forward with his hands, going on all fours, as a gorilla\ngenerally does.\n\nWe reached the broad, long street of Rica about half an hour before\ndawn, and proceeded down it till we were past the Feast-house still\nquite unobserved, for as yet none were stirring on that wet morning.\nIndeed it was not until we were within a hundred yards of the harbour\nthat a woman possessed of the virtue, or vice, of early rising, who\nhad come from a hut to work in her garden, saw us and raised an awful,\npiercing scream.\n\n\"The gods!\" she screamed. \"The gods are leaving the land and taking the\nwhite men with them.\"\n\nInstantly there arose a hubbub in the houses. Heads were thrust out of\nthe doors and people ran into the gardens, every one of whom began to\nyell till one might have thought that a massacre was in progress. But as\nyet no one came near us, for they were afraid.\n\n\"Push on,\" I cried, \"or all is lost.\"\n\nThey answered nobly. Hans struggled forward on all fours, for he was\nnearly done and his hideous garment was choking him, while Stephen and\nBrother John, exhausted though they were with the weight of the great\nplant, actually broke into a feeble trot. We came to the harbour and\nthere, tied to the wharf, was the same canoe in which we had crossed\nto Pongo-land. We sprang into it and cut the fastenings with my knife,\nhaving no time to untie them, and pushed off from the wharf.\n\nBy now hundreds of people, among them many soldiers were hard upon and\nindeed around us, but still they seemed too frightened to do anything.\nSo far the inspiration of Hans' disguise had saved us. In the midst of\nthem, by the light of the rising sun, I recognised Komba, who ran up, a\ngreat spear in his hand, and for a moment halted amazed.\n\nThen it was that the catastrophe happened which nearly cost us all our\nlives.\n\nHans, who was in the stern of the canoe, began to faint from exhaustion,\nand in his efforts to obtain air, for the heat and stench of the skin\nwere overpowering him, thrust his head out through the lacings of the\nhide beneath the reed-stuffed mask of the gorilla, which fell over\nlanguidly upon his shoulder. Komba saw his ugly little face and knew it\nagain.\n\n\"It is a trick!\" he roared. \"These white devils have killed the god and\nstolen the Holy Flower and its priestess. The yellow man is wrapped in\nthe skin of the god. To the boats! To the boats!\"\n\n\"Paddle,\" I shouted to Brother John and Stephen, \"paddle for your lives!\nMavovo, help me get up the sail.\"\n\nAs it chanced on that stormy morning the wind was blowing strongly\ntowards the mainland.\n\nWe laboured at the mast, shipped it and hauled up the mat sail, but\nslowly for we were awkward at the business. By the time that it began\nto draw the paddles had propelled us about four hundred yards from the\nwharf, whence many canoes, with their sails already set, were starting\nin pursuit. Standing in the prow of the first of these, and roaring\ncurses and vengeance at us, was Komba, the new Kalubi, who shook a great\nspear above his head.\n\nAn idea occurred to me, who knew that unless something were done we\nmust be overtaken and killed by these skilled boatmen. Leaving Mavovo\nto attend to the sail, I scrambled aft, and thrusting aside the fainting\nHans, knelt down in the stern of the canoe. There was still one charge,\nor rather one cap, left, and I meant to use it. I put up the largest\nflapsight, lifted the little rifle and covered Komba, aiming at the\npoint of his chin. _Intombi_ was not sighted for or meant to use at this\ngreat distance, and only by this means of allowing for the drop of the\nbullet, could I hope to hit the man in the body.\n\nThe sail was drawing well now and steadied the boat, also, being still\nunder the shelter of the land, the water was smooth as that of a pond,\nso really I had a very good firing platform. Moreover, weary though I\nwas, my vital forces rose to the emergency and I felt myself grow rigid\nas a statue. Lastly, the light was good, for the sun rose behind me, its\nlevel rays shining full on to my mark. I held my breath and touched the\ntrigger. The charge exploded sweetly and almost at the instant; as\nthe smoke drifted to one side, I saw Komba throw up his arms and fall\nbackwards into the canoe. Then, quite a long while afterwards, or so it\nseemed, the breeze brought the faint sound of the thud of that fateful\nbullet to our ears.\n\nThough perhaps I ought not to say so, it was really a wonderful shot\nin all the circumstances, for, as I learned afterwards, the ball struck\njust where I hoped that it might, in the centre of the breast, piercing\nthe heart. Indeed, taking everything into consideration, I think that\nthose four shots which I fired in Pongo-land are the real record of my\ncareer as a marksman. The first at night broke the arm of the gorilla\ngod and would have killed him had not the charge hung fire and given\nhim time to protect his head. The second did kill him in the midst of\na great scrimmage when everything was moving. The third, fired by the\nglare of lightning after a long swim, slew the Motombo, and the fourth,\nloosed at this great distance from a moving boat, was the bane of that\ncold-blooded and treacherous man, Komba, who thought that he had trapped\nus to Pongo-land to be murdered and eaten as a sacrifice. Lastly there\nwas always the consciousness that no mistake must be made, since with\nbut four percussion caps it could not be retrieved.\n\nI am sure that I could not have done so well with any other rifle,\nhowever modern and accurate it might be. But to this little Purdey\nweapon I had been accustomed from my youth, and that, as any marksman\nwill know, means a great deal. I seemed to know it and it seemed to know\nme. It hangs on my wall to this day, although of course I never use it\nnow in our breech-loading era. Unfortunately, however, a local gunsmith\nto whom I sent it to have the lock cleaned, re-browned it and scraped\nand varnished the stock, etc., without authority, making it look almost\nnew again. I preferred it in its worn and scratched condition.\n\nTo return: the sound of the shot, like that of John Peel's horn, aroused\nHans from his sleep. He thrust his head between my legs and saw Komba\nfall.\n\n\"Oh! beautiful, Baas, beautiful!\" he said faintly. \"I am sure that the\nghost of your reverend father cannot kill his enemies more nicely down\nthere among the Fires. Beautiful!\" and the silly old fellow fell to\nkissing my boots, or what remained of them, after which I gave him the\nlast of the brandy.\n\nThis quite brought him to himself again, especially when he was free\nfrom that filthy skin and had washed his head and hands.\n\nThe effect of the death of Komba upon the Pongos was very strange. All\nthe other canoes clustered round that in which he lay. Then, after a\nhurried consultation, they hauled down their sails and paddled back to\nthe wharf. Why they did this I cannot tell. Perhaps they thought that\nhe was bewitched, or only wounded and required the attentions of a\nmedicine-man. Perhaps it was not lawful for them to proceed except under\nthe guidance of some reserve Kalubi who had \"passed the god\" and who was\non shore. Perhaps it was necessary, according to their rites, that the\nbody of their chief should be landed with certain ceremonies. I do not\nknow. It is impossible to be sure as to the mysterious motives that\nactuate many of these remote African tribes.\n\nAt any rate the result was that it gave us a great start and a chance\nof life, who must otherwise have died upon the spot. Outside the bay the\nbreeze blew merrily, taking us across the lake at a spanking pace, until\nabout midday when it began to fall. Fortunately, however, it did\nnot altogether drop till three o'clock by which time the coast of\nMazitu-land was comparatively near; we could even distinguish a speck\nagainst the skyline which we knew was the Union Jack that Stephen had\nset upon the crest of a little hill.\n\nDuring those hours of peace we ate the food that remained to us, washed\nourselves as thoroughly as we could and rested. Well was it, in view of\nwhat followed, that we had this time of repose. For just as the breeze\nwas failing I looked aft and there, coming up behind us, still holding\nthe wind, was the whole fleet of Pongo canoes, thirty or forty of them\nperhaps, each carrying an average of about twenty men. We sailed on\nfor as long as we could, for though our progress was but slow, it was\nquicker than what we could have made by paddling. Also it was necessary\nthat we should save our strength for the last trial.\n\nI remember that hour very well, for in the nervous excitement of it\nevery little thing impressed itself upon my mind. I remember even the\nshape of the clouds that floated over us, remnants of the storm of the\nprevious night. One was like a castle with a broken-down turret showing\na staircase within; another had a fantastic resemblance to a wrecked\nship with a hole in her starboard bow, two of her masts broken and one\nstanding with some fragments of sails flapping from it, and so forth.\n\nThen there was the general aspect of the great lake, especially at a\nspot where two currents met, causing little waves which seemed to fight\nwith each other and fall backwards in curious curves. Also there were\nshoals of small fish, something like chub in shape, with round mouths\nand very white stomachs, which suddenly appeared upon the surface,\njumping at invisible flies. These attracted a number of birds that\nresembled gulls of a light build. They had coal-black heads, white\nbacks, greyish wings, and slightly webbed feet, pink as coral, with\nwhich they seized the small fish, uttering as they did so, a peculiar\nand plaintive cry that ended in a long-drawn _e-e-\u00e9_. The father of the\nflock, whose head seemed to be white like his back, perhaps from age,\nhung above them, not troubling to fish himself, but from time to\ntime forcing one of the company to drop what he had caught, which he\nretrieved before it reached the water. Such are some of the small things\nthat come back to me, though there were others too numerous and trivial\nto mention.\n\nWhen the breeze failed us at last we were perhaps something over three\nmiles from the shore, or rather from the great bed of reeds which at\nthis spot grow in the shallows off the Mazitu coast to a breadth of\nseven or eight hundred yards, where the water becomes too deep for them.\nThe Pongos were then about a mile and a half behind. But as the wind\nfavoured them for a few minutes more and, having plenty of hands, they\ncould help themselves on by paddling, when at last it died to a complete\ncalm, the distance between us was not more than one mile. This meant\nthat they must cover four miles of water, while we covered three.\n\nLetting down our now useless sail and throwing it and the mast overboard\nto lighten the canoe, since the sky showed us that there was no more\nhope of wind, we began to paddle as hard as we could. Fortunately the\ntwo ladies were able to take their share in this exercise, since they\nhad learned it upon the Lake of the Flower, where it seemed they kept\na private canoe upon the other side of the island which was used for\nfishing. Hans, who was still weak, we set to steer with a paddle aft,\nwhich he did in a somewhat erratic fashion.\n\nA stern chase is proverbially a long chase, but still the enemy with\ntheir skilled rowers came up fast. When we were a mile from the reeds\nthey were within half a mile of us, and as we tired the proportion of\ndistance lessened. When we were two hundred yards from the reeds they\nwere not more than fifty or sixty yards behind, and then the real\nstruggle began.\n\nIt was short but terrible. We threw everything we could overboard,\nincluding the ballast stones at the bottom of the canoe and the heavy\nhide of the gorilla. This, as it proved, was fortunate, since the thing\nsank but slowly and the foremost Pongo boats halted a minute to recover\nso precious a relic, checking the others behind them, a circumstance\nthat helped us by twenty or thirty yards.\n\n\"Over with the plant!\" I said.\n\nBut Stephen, looking quite old from exhaustion and with the sweat\nstreaming from him as he laboured at his unaccustomed paddle, gasped:\n\n\"For Heaven's sake, no, after all we have gone through to get it.\"\n\nSo I didn't insist; indeed there was neither time nor breath for\nargument.\n\nNow we were in the reeds, for thanks to the flag which guided us, we had\nstruck the big hippopotamus lane exactly, and the Pongos, paddling\nlike demons, were about thirty yards behind. Thankful was I that those\ninteresting people had never learned the use of bows and arrows, and\nthat their spears were too heavy to throw. By now, or rather some time\nbefore, old Babemba and the Mazitu had seen us, as had our Zulu hunters.\nCrowds of them were wading through the shallows towards us, yelling\nencouragements as they came. The Zulus, too, opened a rather wild fire,\nwith the result that one of the bullets struck our canoe and another\ntouched the brim of my hat. A third, however, killed a Pongo, which\ncaused some confusion in the ranks of Tusculum.\n\nBut we were done and they came on remorselessly. When their leading boat\nwas not more than ten yards from us and we were perhaps two hundred from\nthe shore, I drove my paddle downwards and finding that the water was\nless than four feet deep, shouted:\n\n\"Overboard, all, and wade. It's our last chance!\"\n\nWe scrambled out of that canoe the prow of which, as I left it the last,\nI pushed round across the water-lane to obstruct those of the Pongo. Now\nI think all would have gone well had it not been for Stephen, who after\nhe had floundered forward a few paces in the mud, bethought him of his\nbeloved orchid. Not only did he return to try to rescue it, he also\nactually persuaded his friend Mavovo to accompany him. They got back to\nthe boat and began to lift the plant out when the Pongo fell upon them,\nstriking at them with their spears over the width of our canoe. Mavovo\nstruck back with the weapon he had taken from the Pongo sentry at the\ncave mouth, and killed or wounded one of them. Then some one hurled\na ballast stone at him which caught him on the side of the head and\nknocked him down into the water, whence he rose and reeled back, almost\nsenseless, till some of our people got hold of him and dragged him to\nthe shore.\n\nSo Stephen was left alone, dragging at the great orchid, till a Pongo\nreaching over the canoe drove a spear through his shoulder. He let go of\nthe orchid because he must and tried to retreat. Too late! Half a dozen\nor more of the Pongo pushed themselves between the stern or bow of our\ncanoe and the reeds, and waded forward to kill him. I could not help,\nfor to tell the truth at the moment I was stuck in a mud-hole made by\nthe hoof of a hippopotamus, while the Zulu hunters and the Mazitu were\nas yet too far off. Surely he must have died had it not been for the\ncourage of the girl Hope, who, while wading shorewards a little in front\nof me, had turned and seen his plight. Back she came, literally bounding\nthrough the water like a leopard whose cubs are in danger.\n\nReaching Stephen before the Pongo she thrust herself between him and\nthem and proceeded to address them with the utmost vigour in their own\nlanguage, which of course she had learned from those of the albinos who\nwere not mutes.\n\nWhat she said I could not exactly catch because of the shouts of the\nadvancing Mazitu. I gathered, however, that she was anathematizing them\nin the words of some old and potent curse that was only used by the\nguardians of the Holy Flower, which consigned them, body and spirit,\nto a dreadful doom. The effect of this malediction, which by the way\nneither the young lady nor her mother would repeat to me afterwards, was\ncertainly remarkable. Those men who heard it, among them the would-be\nslayers of Stephen, stayed their hands and even inclined their heads\ntowards the young priestess, as though in reverence or deprecation, and\nthus remained for sufficient time for her to lead the wounded Stephen\nout of danger. This she did wading backwards by his side and keeping her\neyes fixed full upon the Pongo. It was perhaps the most curious rescue\nthat I ever saw.\n\nThe Holy Flower, I should add, they recaptured and carried off, for I\nsaw it departing in one of their canoes. That was the end of my orchid\nhunt and of the money which I hoped to make by the sale of this floral\ntreasure. I wonder what became of it. I have good reason to believe that\nit was never replanted on the Island of the Flower, so perhaps it was\nborne back to the dim and unknown land in the depths of Africa whence\nthe Pongo are supposed to have brought it when they migrated.\n\nAfter this incident of the wounding and the rescue of Stephen by the\nintrepid Miss Hope, whose interest in him was already strong enough\nto induce her to risk her life upon his behalf, all we fugitives were\ndragged ashore somehow by our friends. Here, Hans, I and the ladies\ncollapsed exhausted, though Brother John still found sufficient strength\nto do what he could for the injured Stephen and Mavovo.\n\nThen the Battle of the Reeds began, and a fierce fray it was. The Pongos\nwho were about equal in numbers to our people, came on furiously, for\nthey were mad at the death of their god with his priest, the Motombo,\nof which I think news had reached them and at the carrying off of the\nMother of the Flower. Springing from their canoes because the waterway\nwas too narrow for more than one of these to travel at a time, they\nplunged into the reeds with the intention of wading ashore. Here their\nhereditary enemies, the Mazitu, attacked them under the command of old\nBabemba. The struggle that ensued partook more of the nature of a series\nof hand-to-hand fights than of a set battle. It was extraordinary to see\nthe heads of the combatants moving among the reeds as they stabbed at\neach other with the great spears, till one went down. There were few\nwounded in that fray, for those who fell sank in the mud and water and\nwere drowned.\n\nOn the whole the Pongo, who were operating in what was almost their\nnative element, were getting the best of it, and driving the Mazitu\nback. But what decided the day against them were the guns of our Zulu\nhunters. Although I could not lift a rifle myself I managed to collect\nthese men round me and to direct their fire, which proved so terrifying\nto the Pongos that after ten or a dozen of them had been knocked over,\nthey began to give back sullenly and were helped into their canoes by\nthose men who were left in charge of them.\n\nThen at length at a signal they got out their paddles, and, still\nshouting curses and defiance at us, rowed away till they became but\nspecks upon the bosom of the great lake and vanished.\n\nTwo of the canoes we captured, however, and with them six or seven\nPongos. These the Mazitu wished to put to death, but at the bidding\nof Brother John, whose orders, it will be remembered, had the same\nauthority in Mazitu-land as those of the king, they bound their arms and\nmade them prisoners instead.\n\nIn about half an hour it was all over, but of the rest of that day I\ncannot write, as I think I fainted from utter exhaustion, which was not,\nperhaps, wonderful, considering all that we had undergone in the four\nand a half days that had elapsed since we first embarked upon the Great\nLake. For constant strain, physical and mental, I recall no such four\ndays during the whole of my adventurous life. It was indeed wonderful\nthat we came through them alive.\n\nThe last thing I remember was the appearance of Sammy, looking very\nsmart, in his blue cotton smock, who, now that the fighting was over,\nemerged like a butterfly when the sun shines after rain.\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Quatermain,\" he said, \"I welcome you home again after arduous\nexertions and looking into the eyes of bloody war. All the days of\nabsence, and a good part of the nights, too, while the mosquitoes hunted\nslumber, I prayed for your safety like one o'clock, and perhaps, Mr.\nQuatermain, that helped to do the trick, for what says poet? Those who\nserve and wait are almost as good as those who cook dinner.\"\n\nSuch were the words which reached and, oddly enough, impressed\nthemselves upon my darkening brain. Or rather they were part of the\nwords, excerpts from a long speech that there is no doubt Sammy had\ncarefully prepared during our absence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n                         THE TRUE HOLY FLOWER\n\nWhen I came to myself again it was to find that I had slept fifteen or\nsixteen hours, for the sun of a new day was high in the heavens. I was\nlying in a little shelter of boughs at the foot of that mound on which\nwe flew the flag that guided us back over the waters of the Lake Kirua.\nNear by was Hans consuming a gigantic meal of meat which he had cooked\nover a neighbouring fire. With him, to my delight, I saw Mavovo, his\nhead bound up, though otherwise but little the worse. The stone, which\nprobably would have killed a thin-skulled white man, had done no more\nthan knock him stupid and break the skin of his scalp, perhaps because\nthe force of it was lessened by the gum man's-ring which, like most\nZulus of a certain age or dignity, he wore woven in his hair.\n\nThe two tents we had brought with us to the lake were pitched not far\naway and looked quite pretty and peaceful there in the sunlight.\n\nHans, who was watching me out of the corner of his eye, ran to me with\na large pannikin of hot coffee which Sammy had made ready against my\nawakening; for they knew that my sleep was, or had become of a natural\norder. I drank it to the last drop, and in all my life never did I enjoy\nanything more. Then while I began upon some pieces of the toasted meat,\nI asked him what had happened.\n\n\"Not much, Baas,\" he answered, \"except that we are alive, who should be\ndead. The Maam and the Missie are still asleep in that tent, or at least\nthe Maam is, for the Missie is helping Dogeetah, her father, to nurse\nBaas Stephen, who has an ugly wound. The Pongos have gone and I think\nwill not return, for they have had enough of the white man's guns. The\nMazitu have buried those of their dead whom they could recover, and have\nsent their wounded, of whom there were only six, back to Beza Town on\nlitters. That is all, Baas.\"\n\nThen while I washed, and never did I need a bath more, and put on my\nunderclothes, in which I had swum on the night of the killing of the\nMotombo, that Hans had wrung out and dried in the sun, I asked that\nworthy how he was after his adventures.\n\n\"Oh! well enough, Baas,\" he answered, \"now that my stomach is full,\nexcept that my hands and wrists are sore with crawling along the ground\nlike a babyan (baboon), and that I cannot get the stink of that god's\nskin out of my nose. Oh! you don't know what it was: if I had been a\nwhite man it would have killed me. But, Baas, perhaps you did well to\ntake drunken old Hans with you on this journey after all, for I was\nclever about the little gun, wasn't I? Also about your swimming of the\nCrocodile Water, though it is true that the sign of the spider and the\nmoth which your reverend father sent, taught me that. And now we have\ngot back safe, except for the Mazitu, Jerry, who doesn't matter,\nfor there are plenty more like him, and the wound in Baas Stephen's\nshoulder, and that heavy flower which he thought better than brandy.\"\n\n\"Yes, Hans,\" I said, \"I did well to take you and you are clever, for had\nit not been for you, we should now be cooked and eaten in Pongo-land. I\nthank you for your help, old friend. But, Hans, another time please sew\nup the holes in your waistcoat pocket. Four caps wasn't much, Hans.\"\n\n\"No, Baas, but it was enough; as they were all good ones. If there had\nbeen forty you could not have done much more. Oh! your reverend father\nknew all that\" (my departed parent had become a kind of patron saint to\nHans) \"and did not wish this poor old Hottentot to have more to carry\nthan was needed. He knew you wouldn't miss, Baas, and that there were\nonly one god, one devil, and one man waiting to be killed.\"\n\nI laughed, for Hans's way of putting things was certainly original, and\nhaving got on my coat, went to see Stephen. At the door of the tent I\nmet Brother John, whose shoulder was dreadfully sore from the rubbing of\nthe orchid stretcher, as were his hands with paddling, but who otherwise\nwas well enough and of course supremely happy.\n\nHe told me that he had cleansed and sewn up Stephen's wound, which\nappeared to be doing well, although the spear had pierced right through\nthe shoulder, luckily without cutting any artery. So I went in to see\nthe patient and found him cheerful enough, though weak from weariness\nand loss of blood, with Miss Hope feeding him with broth from a wooden\nnative spoon. I didn't stop very long, especially after he got on to\nthe subject of the lost orchid, about which he began to show signs of\nexcitement. This I allayed as well as I could by telling him that I had\npreserved a pod of the seed, news at which he was delighted.\n\n\"There!\" he said. \"To think that you, Allan, should have remembered to\ntake that precaution when I, an orchidist, forgot all about it!\"\n\n\"Ah! my boy,\" I answered, \"I have lived long enough to learn never to\nleave anything behind that I can possibly carry away. Also, although not\nan orchidist, it occurred to me that there are more ways of propagating\na plant than from the original root, which generally won't go into one's\npocket.\"\n\nThen he began to give me elaborate instructions as to the preservation\nof the seed-pod in a perfectly dry and air-tight tin box, etc., at which\npoint Miss Hope unceremoniously bundled me out of the tent.\n\nThat afternoon we held a conference at which it was agreed that we\nshould begin our return journey to Beza Town at once, as the place where\nwe were camped was very malarious and there was always a risk of the\nPongo paying us another visit.\n\nSo a litter was made with a mat stretched over it in which Stephen could\nbe carried, since fortunately there were plenty of bearers, and our\nother simple preparations were quickly completed. Mrs. Eversley and Hope\nwere mounted on the two donkeys; Brother John, whose hurt leg showed\nsigns of renewed weakness, rode his white ox, which was now quite fat\nagain; the wounded hero, Stephen, as I have said, was carried; and I\nwalked, comparing notes with old Babemba on the Pongo, their manners,\nwhich I am bound to say were good, and their customs, that, as the\nsaying goes, were \"simply beastly.\"\n\nHow delighted that ancient warrior was to hear again about the sacred\ncave, the Crocodile Water, the Mountain Forest and its terrible god,\nof the death of which and of the Motombo he made me tell him the\nstory three times over. At the conclusion of the third recital he said\nquietly:\n\n\"My lord Macumazana, you are a great man, and I am glad to have lived if\nonly to know you. No one else could have done these deeds.\"\n\nOf course I was complimented, but felt bound to point out Hans's share\nin our joint achievement.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he answered, \"the Spotted Snake, Inhlatu, has the cunning to\nscheme, but you have the power to do, and what is the use of a brain to\nplot without the arm to strike? The two do not go together because the\nplotter is not a striker. His mind is different. If the snake had\nthe strength and brain of the elephant, and the fierce courage of the\nbuffalo, soon there would be but one creature left in the world. But\nthe Maker of all things knew this and kept them separate, my lord\nMacumazana.\"\n\nI thought, and still think, that there was a great deal of wisdom in\nthis remark, simple as it seems. Oh! surely many of these savages whom\nwe white men despise, are no fools.\n\nAfter about an hour's march we camped till the moon rose which it did\nat ten o'clock, when we went on again till near dawn, as it was thought\nbetter that Stephen should travel in the cool of the night. I remember\nthat our cavalcade, escorted before, behind and on either flank by\nthe Mazitu troops with their tall spears, looked picturesque and even\nimposing as it wound over those wide downs in the lovely and peaceful\nlight of the moon.\n\nThere is no need for me to set out the details of the rest of our\njourney, which was not marked by any incident of importance.\n\nStephen bore it very well, and Brother John, who was one of the best\ndoctors I ever met, gave good reports of him, but I noted that he did\nnot seem to get any stronger, although he ate plenty of food. Also, Miss\nHope, who nursed him, for her mother seemed to have no taste that way,\ninformed me that he slept but little, as indeed I found out for myself.\n\n\"O Allan,\" she said, just before we reached Beza Town, \"Stephen, your\nson\" (she used to call him my son, I don't know why) \"is sick. The\nfather says it is only the spear-hurt, but I tell you it is more than\nthe spear-hurt. He is sick in himself,\" and the tears that filled her\ngrey eyes showed me that she spoke what she believed. As a matter of\nfact she was right, for on the night after we reached the town, Stephen\nwas seized with an attack of some bad form of African fever, which in\nhis weak state nearly cost him his life, contracted, no doubt, at that\nunhealthy Crocodile Water.\n\nOur reception at Beza was most imposing, for the whole population,\nheaded by old Bausi himself, came out to meet us with loud shouts of\nwelcome, from which we had to ask them to desist for Stephen's sake.\n\nSo in the end we got back to our huts with gratitude of heart. Indeed,\nwe should have been very happy there for a while, had it not been for\nour anxiety about Stephen. But it is always thus in the world; who was\never allowed to eat his pot of honey without finding a fly or perhaps a\ncockroach in his mouth?\n\nIn all, Stephen was really ill for about a month. On the tenth day after\nour arrival at Beza, according to my diary, which, having little else\nto do, I entered up fully at this time, we thought that he would surely\ndie. Even Brother John, who attended him with the most constant skill,\nand who had ample quinine and other drugs at his command, for these we\nhad brought with us from Durban in plenty, gave up the case. Day and\nnight the poor fellow raved and always about that confounded orchid, the\nloss of which seemed to weigh upon his mind as though it were a whole\nsackful of unrepented crimes.\n\nI really think that he owed his life to a subterfuge, or rather to a\nbold invention of Hope's. One evening, when he was at his very worst and\ngoing on like a mad creature about the lost plant--I was present in the\nhut at the time alone with him and her--she took his hand and pointing\nto a perfectly open space on the floor, said:\n\n\"Look, O Stephen, the flower has been brought back.\"\n\nHe stared and stared, and then to my amazement answered:\n\n\"By Jove, so it has! But those beggars have broken off all the blooms\nexcept one.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she echoed, \"but one remains and it is the finest of them all.\"\n\nAfter this he went quietly to sleep and slept for twelve hours, then\ntook some food and slept again and, what is more, his temperature went\ndown to, or a little below, normal. When he finally woke up, as it\nchanced, I was again present in the hut with Hope, who was standing\non the spot which she had persuaded him was occupied by the orchid. He\nstared at this spot and he stared at her--me he could not see, for I was\nbehind him--then said in a weak voice:\n\n\"Didn't you tell me, Miss Hope, that the plant was where you are and\nthat the most beautiful of the flowers was left?\"\n\nI wondered what on earth her answer would be. However, she rose to the\noccasion.\n\n\"O Stephen,\" she replied, in her soft voice and speaking in a way so\nnatural that it freed her words from any boldness, \"it is here, for am\nI not its child\"--her native appellation, it will be remembered, was\n\"Child of the Flower.\" \"And the fairest of the flowers is here, too, for\nI am that Flower which you found in the island of the lake. O Stephen, I\npray you to trouble no more about a lost plant of which you have seed\nin plenty, but make thanks that you still live and that through you\nmy mother and I still live, who, if you had died, would weep our eyes\naway.\"\n\n\"Through me,\" he answered. \"You mean through Allan and Hans. Also it was\nyou who saved my life there in the water. Oh! I remember it all now. You\nare right, Hope; although I didn't know it, you are the true Holy Flower\nthat I saw.\"\n\nShe ran to him and kneeling by his side, gave him her hand, which he\npressed to his pale lips.\n\nThen I sneaked out of that hut and left them to discuss the lost flower\nthat was found again. It was a pretty scene, and one that to my mind\ngave a sort of spiritual meaning to the whole of an otherwise rather\ninsane quest. He sought an ideal flower, he found--the love of his life.\n\nAfter this, Stephen recovered rapidly, for such love is the best of\nmedicines--if it be returned.\n\nI don't know what passed between the pair and Brother John and his wife,\nfor I never asked. But I noted that from this day forward they began to\ntreat him as a son. The new relationship between Stephen and Hope seemed\nto be tacitly accepted without discussion. Even the natives accepted it,\nfor old Mavovo asked me when they were going to be married and how many\ncows Stephen had promised to pay Brother John for such a beautiful wife.\n\"It ought to be a large herd,\" he said, \"and of a big breed of cattle.\"\n\nSammy, too, alluded to the young lady in conversation with me, as \"Mr.\nSomers's affianced spouse.\" Only Hans said nothing. Such a trivial\nmatter as marrying and giving in marriage did not interest him.\nOr, perhaps, he looked upon the affair as a foregone conclusion and\ntherefore unworthy of comment.\n\nWe stayed at Bausi's kraal for a full month longer whilst Stephen\nrecovered his strength. I grew thoroughly bored with the place and so\ndid Mavovo and the Zulus, but Brother John and his wife did not seem to\nmind. Mrs. Eversley was a passive creature, quite content to take things\nas they came and after so long an absence from civilization, to bide a\nlittle longer among savages. Also she had her beloved John, at whom she\nwould sit and gaze by the hour like a cat sometimes does at a person to\nwhom it is attached. Indeed, when she spoke to him, her voice seemed\nto me to resemble a kind of blissful purr. I think it made the old boy\nrather fidgety sometimes, for after an hour or two of it he would rise\nand go to hunt for butterflies.\n\nTo tell the truth, the situation got a little on my nerves at last, for\nwherever I looked I seemed to see there Stephen and Hope making love\nto each other, or Brother John and his wife admiring each other, which\ndidn't leave me much spare conversation. Evidently they thought that\nMavovo, Hans, Sammy, Bausi, Babemba and Co. were enough for me--that is,\nif they reflected on the matter at all. So they were, in a sense, for\nthe Zulu hunters began to get out of hand in the midst of this idleness\nand plenty, eating too much, drinking too much native beer, smoking too\nmuch of the intoxicating _dakka_, a mischievous kind of help, and making\ntoo much love to the Mazitu women, which of course resulted in the usual\nrows that I had to settle.\n\nAt last I struck and said that we must move on as Stephen was now fit to\ntravel.\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Brother John, mildly. \"What have you arranged, Allan?\"\n\nWith some irritation, for I hated that sentence of Brother John's, I\nreplied that I had arranged nothing, but that as none of them seemed to\nhave any suggestions to make, I would go out and talk the matter over\nwith Hans and Mavovo, which I did.\n\nI need not chronicle the results of our conference since other\narrangements were being made for us at which I little guessed.\n\nIt all came very suddenly, as great things in the lives of men and\nnations sometimes do. Although the Mazitu were of the Zulu family, their\nmilitary organization had none of the Zulu thoroughness. For instance,\nwhen I remonstrated with Bausi and old Babemba as to their not keeping\nup a proper system of outposts and intelligence, they laughed at me and\nanswered that they never had been attacked and now that the Pongo had\nlearnt a lesson, were never likely to be.\n\nBy the way, I see that I have not yet mentioned that at Brother John's\nrequest those Pongos who had been taken prisoners at the Battle of\nthe Reeds were conducted to the shores of the lake, given one of the\ncaptured canoes and told that they might return to their own happy land.\nTo our astonishment about three weeks later they reappeared at Beza Town\nwith this story.\n\nThey said that they had crossed the lake and found Rica still standing,\nbut utterly deserted. They then wandered through the country and even\nexplored the Motombo's cave. There they discovered the remains of the\nMotombo, still crouched upon his platform, but nothing more. In one hut\nof a distant village, however, they came across an old and dying woman\nwho informed them with her last breath that the Pongos, frightened by\nthe iron tubes that vomited death and in obedience to some prophecy,\n\"had all gone back whence they came in the beginning,\" taking with them\nthe recaptured \"Holy Flower.\" She had been left with a supply of food\nbecause she was too weak to travel. So, perhaps, that flower grows\nagain in some unknown place in Africa, but its worshippers will have to\nprovide themselves with another god of the forest, another Mother of the\nFlower, and another high-priest to fill the office of the late Motombo.\n\nThese Pongo prisoners, having now no home, and not knowing where their\npeople had gone except that it was \"towards the north,\" asked for\nleave to settle among the Mazitu, which was granted them. Their story\nconfirmed me in my opinion that Pongo-land is not really an island, but\nis connected on the further side with the continent by some ridge or\nswamp. If we had been obliged to stop much longer among the Mazitu, I\nwould have satisfied myself as to this matter by going to look. But\nthat chance never came to me until some years later when, under curious\ncircumstances, I was again destined to visit this part of Africa.\n\nTo return to my story. On the day following this discussion as to our\ndeparture we all breakfasted very early as there was a great deal to\nbe done. There was a dense mist that morning such as in these Mazitu\nuplands often precedes high, hot wind from the north at this season of\nthe year, so dense indeed that it was impossible to see for more than\na few yards. I suppose that this mist comes up from the great lake in\ncertain conditions of the weather. We had just finished our breakfast\nand rather languidly, for the thick, sultry air left me unenergetic, I\ntold one of the Zulus to see that the two donkeys and the white ox which\nI had caused to be brought into the town in view of our near departure\nand tied up by our huts, were properly fed. Then I went to inspect all\nthe rifles and ammunition, which Hans had got out to be checked\nand overhauled. It was at this moment that I heard a far-away and\nunaccustomed sound, and asked Hans what he thought it was.\n\n\"A gun, Baas,\" he answered anxiously.\n\nWell might he be anxious, for as we both knew, no one in the\nneighbourhood had guns except ourselves, and all ours were accounted\nfor. It is true that we had promised to give the majority of those we\nhad taken from the slavers to Bausi when we went away, and that I had\nbeen instructing some of his best soldiers in the use of them, but not\none of these had as yet been left in their possession.\n\nI stepped to a gate in the fence and ordered the sentry there to run to\nBausi and Babemba and make report and inquiries, also to pray them to\nsummon all the soldiers, of whom, as it happened, there were at the time\nnot more than three hundred in the town. As perfect peace prevailed,\nthe rest, according to their custom, had been allowed to go to their\nvillages and attend to their crops. Then, possessed by a rather\nundefined nervousness, at which the others were inclined to laugh, I\ncaused the Zulus to arm and generally make a few arrangements to meet\nany unforeseen crisis. This done I sat down to reflect what would be the\nbest course to take if we should happen to be attacked by a large force\nin that straggling native town, of which I had often studied all the\nstrategic possibilities. When I had come to my own conclusion I asked\nHans and Mavovo what they thought, and found that they agreed with me\nthat the only defensible place was outside the town where the road to\nthe south gate ran down to a rocky wooded ridge with somewhat steep\nflanks. It may be remembered that it was by this road and over this\nridge that Brother John had appeared on his white ox when we were about\nto be shot to death with arrows at the posts in the market-place.\n\nWhilst we were still talking two of the Mazitu captains appeared,\nrunning hard and dragging between them a wounded herdsman, who had\nevidently been hit in the arm by a bullet.\n\nThis was his story. That he and two other boys were out herding the\nking's cattle about half a mile to the north of the town, when suddenly\nthere appeared a great number of men dressed in white robes, all of whom\nwere armed with guns. These men, of whom he thought there must be three\nor four hundred, began to take the cattle and seeing the three herds,\nfired on them, wounding him and killing his two companions. He then\nran for his life and brought the news. He added that one of the men had\ncalled after him to tell the white people that they had come to kill\nthem and the Mazitu who were their friends and to take away the white\nwomen.\n\n\"Hassan-ben-Mohammed and his slavers!\" I said, as Babemba appeared at\nthe head of a number of soldiers, crying out:\n\n\"The slave-dealing Arabs are here, lord Macumazana. They have crept\non us through the mist. A herald of theirs has come to the north gate\ndemanding that we should give up you white people and your servants,\nand with you a hundred young men and a hundred young women to be sold as\nslaves. If we do not do this they say that they will kill all of us save\nthe unmarried boys and girls, and that you white people they will take\nand put to death by burning, keeping only the two women alive. One\nHassan sends this message.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I answered quietly, for in this fix I grew quite cool as was\nusual with me. \"And does Bausi mean to give us up?\"\n\n\"How can Bausi give up Dogeetah who is his blood brother, and you, his\nfriend?\" exclaimed the old general, indignantly. \"Bausi sends me to\nhis brother Dogeetah that he may receive the orders of the white man's\nwisdom, spoken through your mouth, lord Macumazana.\"\n\n\"Then there's a good spirit in Bausi,\" I replied, \"and these are\nDogeetah's orders spoken through my mouth. Go to Hassan's messengers and\nask him whether he remembers a certain letter which two white men left\nfor him outside their camp in a cleft stick. Tell him that the time has\nnow come for those white men to fulfil the promise they made in that\nletter and that before to-morrow he will be hanging on a tree. Then,\nBabemba, gather your soldiers and hold the north gate of the town for as\nlong as you can, defending it with bows and arrows. Afterwards retreat\nthrough the town, joining us among the trees on the rocky slope that is\nopposite the south gate. Bid some of your men clear the town of all the\naged and women and children and let them pass though the south gate and\ntake refuge in the wooded country beyond the slope. Let them not tarry.\nLet them go at once. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand everything, lord Macumazana. The words of Dogeetah shall\nbe obeyed. Oh! would that we had listened to you and kept a better\nwatch!\"\n\nHe rushed off, running like a young man and shouting orders as he went.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"we must be moving.\"\n\nWe collected all the rifles and ammunition, with some other things, I\nam sure I forget what they were, and with the help of a few guards whom\nBabemba had left outside our gate started through the town, leading\nwith us the two donkeys and the white ox. I remember by an afterthought,\ntelling Sammy, who was looking very uncomfortable, to return to the huts\nand fetch some blankets and a couple of iron cooking-pots which might\nbecome necessities to us.\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Quatermain,\" he answered, \"I will obey you, though with fear\nand trembling.\"\n\nHe went and when a few hours afterwards I noted that he had never\nreappeared, I came to the conclusion, with a sigh, for I was very fond\nof Sammy in a way, that he had fallen into trouble and been killed.\nProbably, I thought, \"his fear and trembling\" had overcome his reason\nand caused him to run in the wrong direction with the cooking-pots.\n\nThe first part of our march through the town was easy enough, but after\nwe had crossed the market-place and emerged into the narrow way that ran\nbetween many lines of huts to the south gate it became more difficult,\nsince this path was already crowded with hundreds of terrified\nfugitives, old people, sick being carried, little boys, girls, and women\nwith infants at the breast. It was impossible to control these poor\nfolk; all we could do was to fight our way through them. However, we got\nout at last and climbing the slope, took up the best position we could\non and just beneath its crest where the trees and scattered boulders\ngave us very fair cover, which we improved upon in every way feasible in\nthe time at our disposal, by building little breastworks of stone and so\nforth. The fugitives who had accompanied us, and those who followed, a\nmultitude in all, did not stop here, but flowed on along the road and\nvanished into the wooded country behind.\n\nI suggested to Brother John that he should take his wife and daughter\nand the three beasts and go with them. He seemed inclined to accept the\nidea, needless to say for their sakes, not for his own, for he was a\nvery fearless old fellow. But the two ladies utterly refused to budge.\nHope said that she would stop with Stephen, and her mother declared that\nshe had every confidence in me and preferred to remain where she was.\nThen I suggested that Stephen should go too, but at this he grew so\nangry that I dropped the subject.\n\nSo in the end we established them in a pleasant little hollow by a\nspring just over the crest of the rise, where unless our flank were\nturned or we were rushed, they would be out of the reach of bullets.\nMoreover, without saying anything more we gave to each of them a\ndouble-barrelled and loaded pistol.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n                        THE BATTLE OF THE GATE\n\nBy now heavy firing had begun at the north gate of the town, accompanied\nby much shouting. The mist was still too thick to enable us to see\nanything at first. But shortly after the commencement of the firing\na strong, hot wind, which always followed these mists, got up and\ngradually gathered to a gale, blowing away the vapours. Then from the\ntop of the crest, Hans, who had climbed a tree there, reported that the\nArabs were advancing on the north gate, firing as they came, and that\nthe Mazitu were replying with their bows and arrows from behind the\npalisade that surrounded the town. This palisade, I should state,\nconsisted of an earthen bank on the top of which tree trunks were set\nclose together. Many of these had struck in that fertile soil, so that\nin general appearance this protective work resembled a huge live fence,\non the outer and inner side of which grew great masses of prickly pear\nand tall, finger-like cacti. A while afterwards Hans reported that the\nMazitu were retreating and a few minutes later they began to arrive\nthrough the south gate, bringing several wounded with them. Their\ncaptain said that they could not stand against the fire of the guns and\nhad determined to abandon the town and make the best fight they could\nupon the ridge.\n\nA little later the rest of the Mazitu came, driving before them all the\nnon-combatants who remained in the town. With these was King Bausi, in a\nterrible state of excitement.\n\n\"Was I not wise, Macumazana,\" he shouted, \"to fear the slave-traders and\ntheir guns? Now they have come to kill those who are old and to take the\nyoung away in their gangs to sell them.\"\n\n\"Yes, King,\" I could not help answering, \"you were wise. But if you had\ndone what I said and kept a better look-out Hassan could not have crept\non you like a leopard on a goat.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" he groaned; \"but who knows the taste of a fruit till he\nhas bitten it?\"\n\nThen he went to see to the disposal of his soldiers along the ridge,\nplacing, by my advice, the most of them at each end of the line\nto frustrate any attempt to out-flank us. We, for our part, busied\nourselves in serving out those guns which we had taken in the first\nfight with the slavers to the thirty or forty picked men whom I had been\ninstructing in the use of firearms. If they did not do much damage, at\nleast, I thought, they could make a noise and impress the enemy with the\nidea that we were well armed.\n\nTen minutes or so later Babemba arrived with about fifty men, all the\nMazitu soldiers who were left in the town. He reported that he had held\nthe north gate as long as he could in order to gain time, and that the\nArabs were breaking it in. I begged him to order the soldiers to pile\nup stones as a defence against the bullets and to lie down behind them.\nThis he went to do.\n\nThen, after a pause, we saw a large body of the Arabs who had effected\nan entry, advancing down the central street towards us. Some of them\nhad spears as well as guns, on which they carried a dozen or so of human\nheads cut from the Mazitus who had been killed, waving them aloft and\nshouting in triumph. It was a sickening sight, and one that made me\ngrind my teeth with rage. Also I could not help reflecting that ere long\nour heads might be upon those spears. Well, if the worst came to the\nworst I was determined that I would not be taken alive to be burned in\na slow fire or pinned over an ant-heap, a point upon which the others\nagreed with me, though poor Brother John had scruples as to suicide,\neven in despair.\n\nIt was just then that I missed Hans and asked where he had gone.\nSomebody said that he thought he had seen him running away, whereon\nMavovo, who was growing excited, called out:\n\n\"Ah! Spotted Snake has sought his hole. Snakes hiss, but they do not\ncharge.\"\n\n\"No, but sometimes they bite,\" I answered, for I could not believe that\nHans had showed the white feather. However, he was gone and clearly we\nwere in no state to send to look for him.\n\nNow our hope was that the slavers, flushed with victory, would advance\nacross the open ground of the market-place, which we could sweep with\nour fire from our position on the ridge. This, indeed, they began to do,\nwhereon, without orders, the Mazitu to whom we had given the guns, to\nmy fury and dismay, commenced to blaze away at a range of about four\nhundred yards, and after a good deal of firing managed to kill or wound\ntwo or three men. Then the Arabs, seeing their danger, retreated and,\nafter a pause, renewed their advance in two bodies. This time, however,\nthey followed the streets of huts that were built thickly between the\nouter palisade of the town and the market-place, which, as it had been\ndesigned to hold cattle in time of need, was also surrounded with a\nwooden fence strong enough to resist the rush of horned beasts. On that\nday, I should add, as the Mazitu never dreamed of being attacked, all\ntheir stock were grazing on some distant veldt. In this space between\nthe two fences were many hundreds of huts, wattle and grass built, but\nfor the most part roofed with palm leaves, for here, in their separate\nquarters, dwelt the great majority of the inhabitants of Beza Town, of\nwhich the northern part was occupied by the king, the nobles and the\ncaptains. This ring of huts, which entirely surrounded the market-place\nexcept at the two gateways, may have been about a hundred and twenty\nyards in width.\n\nDown the paths between these huts, both on the eastern and the western\nside, advanced the Arabs and half-breeds, of whom there appeared to\nbe about four hundred, all armed with guns and doubtless trained to\nfighting. It was a terrible force for us to face, seeing that although\nwe may have had nearly as many men, our guns did not total more\nthan fifty, and most of those who held them were quite unused to the\nmanagement of firearms.\n\nSoon the Arabs began to open fire on us from behind the huts, and a very\naccurate fire it was, as our casualties quickly showed, notwithstanding\nthe stone _schanzes_ we had constructed. The worst feature of the thing\nalso was that we could not reply with any effect, as our assailants, who\ngradually worked nearer, were effectively screened by the huts, and we\nhad not enough guns to attempt organised volley firing. Although I tried\nto keep a cheerful countenance I confess that I began to fear the worst\nand even to wonder if we could possibly attempt to retreat. This idea\nwas abandoned, however, since the Arabs would certainly overtake and\nshoot us down.\n\nOne thing I did. I persuaded Babemba to send about fifty men to build\nup the southern gate, which was made of trunks of trees and opened\noutwards, with earth and the big stones that lay about in plenty. While\nthis was being done quickly, for the Mazitu soldiers worked at the task\nlike demons and, being sheltered by the palisade, could not be shot, all\nof a sudden I caught sight of four or five wisps of smoke that arose\nin quick succession at the north end of the town and were instantly\nfollowed by as many bursts of flame which leapt towards us in the strong\nwind.\n\nSomeone was firing Beza Town! In less than an hour the flames, driven by\nthe gale through hundreds of huts made dry as tinder by the heat, would\nreduce Beza to a heap of ashes. It was inevitable, nothing could save\nthe place! For an instant I thought that the Arabs must have done\nthis thing. Then, seeing that new fires continually arose in different\nplaces, I understood that no Arabs, but a friend or friends were at\nwork, who had conceived the idea of _destroying the Arabs with fire_.\n\nMy mind flew to Sammy. Without doubt Sammy had stayed behind to carry\nout this terrible and masterly scheme, of which I am sure none of the\nMazitu would have thought, since it involved the absolute destruction\nof their homes and property. Sammy, at whom we had always mocked, was,\nafter all, a great man, prepared to perish in the flames in order to\nsave his friends!\n\nBabemba rushed up, pointing with a spear to the rising fire. Now my\ninspiration came.\n\n\"Take all your men,\" I said, \"except those who are armed with guns.\nDivide them, encircle the town, guard the north gate, though I think\nnone can win back through the flames, and if any of the Arabs succeed in\nbreaking through the palisade, kill them.\"\n\n\"It shall be done,\" shouted Babemba, \"but oh! for the town of Beza where\nI was born! Oh! for the town of Beza!\"\n\n\"Drat the town of Beza!\" I holloaed after him, or rather its native\nequivalent. \"It is of all our lives that I'm thinking.\"\n\nThree minutes later the Mazitu, divided into two bodies, were running\nlike hares to encircle the town, and though a few were shot as they\ndescended the slope, the most of them gained the shelter of the palisade\nin safety, and there at intervals halted by sections, for Babemba\nmanaged the matter very well.\n\nNow only we white people, with the Zulu hunters under Mavovo, of whom\nthere were twelve in all, and the Mazitu armed with guns, numbering\nabout thirty, were left upon the slope.\n\nFor a little while the Arabs did not seem to realise what had happened,\nbut engaged themselves in peppering at the Mazitu, who, I think, they\nconcluded were in full flight. Presently, however, they either heard or\nsaw.\n\nOh! what a hubbub ensued. All the four hundred of them began to shout\nat once. Some of them ran to the palisade and began to climb it, but as\nthey reached the top of the fence were pinned by the Mazitu arrows and\nfell backwards, while a few who got over became entangled in the prickly\npears on the further side and were promptly speared. Giving up this\nattempt, they rushed back along the lane with the intention of escaping\nat the north-gate. But before ever they reached the head of the\nmarket-place the roaring, wind-swept flames, leaping from hut to hut,\nhad barred their path. They could not face that awful furnace.\n\nNow they took another counsel and in a great confused body charged down\nthe market-place to break out at the south gate, and our turn came. How\nwe raked them as they sped across the open, an easy mark! I know that\nI fired as fast as I could using two rifles, swearing the while at Hans\nbecause he was not there to load for me. Stephen was better off in this\nrespect, for, looking round, to my astonishment I saw Hope, who had\nleft her mother on the other side of the hill, in the act of capping his\nsecond gun. I should explain that during our stay in Beza Town we had\ntaught her how to use a rifle.\n\nI called to him to send her away, but again she would not go, even after\na bullet had pierced her dress.\n\nStill, all our shooting could not stop that rush of men, made desperate\nby the fear of a fiery death. Leaving many stretched out behind them,\nthe first of the Arabs drew near to the south gate.\n\n\"My father,\" said Mavovo in my ear, \"now the real fighting is going to\nbegin. The gate will soon be down. _We_ must be the gate.\"\n\nI nodded, for if the Arabs once got through, there were enough of them\nleft to wipe us out five times over. Indeed, I do not suppose that up\nto this time they had actually lost more than forty men. A few words\nexplained the situation to Stephen and Brother John, whom I told to\ntake his daughter to her mother and wait there with them. The Mazitu I\nordered to throw down their guns, for if they kept these I was sure they\nwould shoot some of us, and to accompany us, bringing their spears only.\n\nThen we rushed down the slope and took up our position in a little open\nspace in front of the gate, that now was tottering to its fall beneath\nthe blows and draggings of the Arabs. At this time the sight was\nterrible and magnificent, for the flames had got hold of the two\nhalf-circles of huts that embraced the market-place, and, fanned by\nthe blast, were rushing towards us like a thing alive. Above us swept\na great pall of smoke in which floated flakes of fire, so thick that it\nhid the sky, though fortunately the wind did not suffer it to sink\nand choke us. The sounds also were almost inconceivable, for to the\ncrackling roar of the conflagration as it devoured hut after hut, were\nadded the coarse, yelling voices of the half-bred Arabs, as in mingled\nrage and terror they tore at the gateway or each other, and the reports\nof the guns which many of them were still firing, half at hazard.\n\nWe formed up before the gate, the Zulus with Stephen and myself in front\nand the thirty picked Mazitu, commanded by no less a person than Bausi,\nthe king, behind. We had not long to wait, for presently down the thing\ncame and over it and the mound of earth and stones we had built beyond,\nbegan to pour a mob of white-robed and turbaned men whose mixed and\ntumultuous exit somehow reminded me of the pips and pulp being squeezed\nout of a grenadilla fruit.\n\nI gave the word, and we fired into that packed mass with terrible\neffect. Really I think that each bullet must have brought down two or\nthree of them. Then, at a command from Mavovo, the Zulus threw down\ntheir guns and charged with their broad spears. Stephen, who had got\nhold of an assegai somehow, went with them, firing a Colt's revolver as\nhe ran, while at their backs came Bausi and his thirty tall Mazitu.\n\nI will confess at once that I did not join in this terrific onslaught. I\nfelt that I had not weight enough for a scrimmage of the sort, also that\nI should perhaps be better employed using my wits outside and watching\nfor a chance to be of service, like a half-back in a football field,\nthan in getting my brains knocked out in a general row. Or mayhap my\nheart failed me and I was afraid. I dare say, for I have never pretended\nto great courage. At any rate, I stopped outside and shot whenever I got\nthe chance, not without effect, filling a humble but perhaps a useful\npart.\n\nIt was really magnificent, that fray. How those Zulus did go in. For\nquite a long while they held the narrow gateway and the mound against\nall the howling, thrusting mob, much as the Roman called Horatius and\nhis two friends held the entrance to some bridge or other long ago at\nRome against a great force of I forget whom. They shouted their Zulu\nbattle-cry of _Laba! Laba!_ that of their regiment, I suppose, for\nmost of them were men of about the same age, and stabbed and fought and\nstruggled and went down one by one.\n\nBack the rest of them were swept; then, led by Mavovo, Stephen and\nBausi, charged again, reinforced with the thirty Mazitu. Now the tongues\nof flame met almost over them, the growing fence of prickly pear and\ncacti withered and crackled, and still they fought on beneath that arch\nof fire.\n\nBack they were driven again by the mere weight of numbers. I saw Mavovo\nstab a man and go down. He rose and stabbed another, then fell again for\nhe was hard hit.\n\nTwo Arabs rushed to kill him. I shot them both with a right and left,\nfor fortunately my rifle was just reloaded. He rose once more and killed\na third man. Stephen came to his support and grappling with an Arab,\ndashed his head against the gate-post so that he fell. Old Bausi,\npanting like a grampus, plunged in with his remaining Mazitu and the\ncombatants became so confused in the dark gloom of the overhanging smoke\nthat I could scarcely tell one from the other. Yet the maddened Arabs\nwere winning, as they must, for how could our small and ever-lessening\ncompany stand against their rush?\n\nWe were in a little circle now of which somehow I found myself the\ncentre, and they were attacking us on all sides. Stephen got a knock\non the head from the butt end of a gun, and tumbled against me, nearly\nupsetting me. As I recovered myself I looked round in despair.\n\nNow it was that I saw a very welcome sight, namely Hans, yes, the lost\nHans himself, with his filthy hat whereof I noticed even then the frayed\nostrich feathers were smouldering, hanging by a leather strap at the\nback of his head. He was shambling along in a sly and silent sort\nof way, but at a great rate with his mouth open, beckoning over his\nshoulder, and behind him came about one hundred and fifty Mazitu.\n\nThose Mazitu soon put another complexion upon the affair, for charging\nwith a roar, they drove back the Arabs, who had no space to develop\ntheir line, straight into the jaws of that burning hell. A little later\nthe rest of the Mazitu returned with Babemba and finished the job. Only\nquite a few of the Arabs got out and were captured after they had thrown\ndown their guns. The rest retreated into the centre of the market-place,\nwhither our people followed them. In this crisis the blood of these\nMazitu told, and they stuck to the enemy as Zulus themselves would\ncertainly have done.\n\nIt was over! Great Heaven! it was over, and we began to count\nour losses. Four of the Zulus were dead and two others were badly\nwounded--no, three, including Mavovo. They brought him to me leaning on\nthe shoulder of Babemba and another Mazitu captain. He was a shocking\nsight, for he was shot in three places, and badly cut and battered as\nwell. He looked at me a little while, breathing heavily, then spoke.\n\n\"It was a very good fight, my father,\" he said. \"Of all that I have\nfought I can remember none better, although I have been in far greater\nbattles, which is well as it is my last. I foreknew it, my father, for\nthough I never told it you, the first death lot that I drew down yonder\nin Durban was my own. Take back the gun you gave me, my father. You did\nbut lend it me for a little while, as I said to you. Now I go to the\nUnderworld to join the spirits of my ancestors and of those who have\nfallen at my side in many wars, and of those women who bore my children.\nI shall have a tale to tell them there, my father, and together we will\nwait for you--till you, too, die in war!\"\n\nThen he lifted up his arm from the neck of Babemba, and saluted me with\na loud cry of _Baba! Inkosi!_ giving me certain great titles which I\nwill not set down, and having done so sank to the earth.\n\nI sent one of the Mazitu to fetch Brother John, who arrived presently\nwith his wife and daughter. He examined Mavovo and told him straight out\nthat nothing could help him except prayer.\n\n\"Make no prayers for me, Dogeetah,\" said the old heathen; \"I have\nfollowed my star,\" (i.e. lived according to my lights) \"and am ready to\neat the fruit that I have planted. Or if the tree prove barren, then to\ndrink of its sap and sleep.\"\n\nWaving Brother John aside he beckoned to Stephen.\n\n\"O Wazela!\" he said, \"you fought very well in that fight; if you go on\nas you have begun in time you will make a warrior of whom the Daughter\nof the Flower and her children will sing songs after you have come to\njoin me, your friend. Meanwhile, farewell! Take this assegai of mine and\nclean it not, that the red rust thereon may put you in mind of Mavovo,\nthe old Zulu doctor and captain with whom you stood side by side in the\nBattle of the Gate, when, as though they were winter grass, the fire\nburnt up the white-robed thieves of men who could not pass our spears.\"\n\nThen he waved his hand again, and Stephen stepped aside muttering\nsomething, for he and Mavovo had been very intimate and his voice choked\nin his throat with grief. Now the old Zulu's glazing eye fell upon Hans,\nwho was sneaking about, I think with a view of finding an opportunity of\nbidding him a last good-bye.\n\n\"Ah! Spotted Snake,\" he cried, \"so you have come out of your hole now\nthat the fire has passed it, to eat the burnt frogs in the cinders. It\nis a pity that you who are so clever should be a coward, since our lord\nMacumazana needed one to load for him on the hill and would have killed\nmore of the hyenas had you been there.\"\n\n\"Yes, Spotted Snake, it is so,\" echoed an indignant chorus of the other\nZulus, while Stephen and I and even the mild Brother John looked at him\nreproachfully.\n\nNow Hans, who generally was as patient under affront as a Jew, for once\nlost his temper. He dashed his hat upon the ground, and danced on it; he\nspat towards the surviving Zulu hunters; he even vituperated the dying\nMavovo.\n\n\"O son of a fool!\" he said, \"you pretend that you can see what is hid\nfrom other men, but I tell you that there is a lying spirit in your\nlips. You called me a coward because I am not big and strong as you\nwere, and cannot hold an ox by the horns, but at least there is more\nbrain in my stomach than in all your head. Where would all of you be now\nhad it not been for poor Spotted Snake the 'coward,' who twice this day\nhas saved every one of you, except those whom the Baas's father, the\nreverend Predikant, has marked upon the forehead to come and join him in\na place that is even hotter and brighter than that burning town?\"\n\nNow we looked at Hans, wondering what he meant about saving us twice,\nand Mavovo said:\n\n\"Speak on quickly, O Spotted Snake, for I would hear the end of your\nstory. How did you help us in your hole?\"\n\nHans began to grub about in his pockets, from which finally he produced\na match-box wherein there remained but one match.\n\n\"With this,\" he said. \"Oh! could none of you see that the men of\nHassan had all walked into a trap? Did none of you know that fire burns\nthatched houses, and that a strong wind drives it fast and far? While\nyou sat there upon the hill with your heads together, like sheep waiting\nto be killed, I crept away among the bushes and went about my business.\nI said nothing to any of you, not even to the Baas, lest he should\nanswer me, 'No, Hans, there may be an old woman sick in one of those\nhuts and therefore you must not fire them.' In such matters who does\nnot know that white people are fools, even the best of them, and in fact\nthere were several old women, for I saw them running for the gateway.\nWell, I crept up by the green fence which I knew would not burn and I\ncame to the north gate. There was an Arab sentry left there to watch.\n\n\"He fired at me, look! Well for Hans his mother bore him short\"; and he\npointed to a hole in the filthy hat. \"Then before that Arab could load\nagain, poor coward Hans got his knife into him from behind. Look!\" and\nhe produced a big blade, which was such as butchers use, from his belt\nand showed it to us. \"After that it was easy, since fire is a wonderful\nthing. You make it small and it grows big of itself, like a child, and\nnever gets tired, and is always hungry, and runs fast as a horse. I lit\nsix of them where they would burn quickest. Then I saved the last match,\nsince we have few left, and came through the gate before the fire ate me\nup; me, its father, me the Sower of the Red Seed!\"\n\nWe stared at the old Hottentot in admiration, even Mavovo lifted his\ndying head and stared. But Hans, whose annoyance had now evaporated,\nwent on in a jog-trot mechanical voice:\n\n\"As I was returning to find the Baas, if he still lived, the heat of the\nfire forced me to the high ground to the west of the fence, so that I\nsaw what was happening at the south gate, and that the Arab men must\nbreak through there because you who held it were so few. So I ran down\nto Babemba and the other captains very quickly, telling them there was\nno need to guard the fence any more, and that they must get to the south\ngate and help you, since otherwise you would all be killed, and they,\ntoo, would be killed afterwards. Babemba listened to me and started\nsending out messengers to collect the others and we got here just in\ntime. Such is the hole I hid in during the Battle of the Gate, O Mavovo.\nThat is all the story which I pray that you will tell to the Baas's\nreverend father, the Predikant, presently, for I am sure that it will\nplease him to learn that he did not teach me to be wise and help all\nmen and always to look after the Baas Allan, to no purpose. Still, I am\nsorry that I wasted so many matches, for where shall we get any more now\nthat the camp is burnt?\" and he gazed ruefully at the all but empty box.\n\nMavovo spoke once more in a slow, gasping voice.\n\n\"Never again,\" he said, addressing Hans, \"shall you be called Spotted\nSnake, O little yellow man who are so great and white of heart. Behold!\nI give you a new name, by which you shall be known with honour from\ngeneration to generation. It is 'Light in Darkness.' It is 'Lord of the\nFire.'\"\n\nThen he closed his eyes and fell back insensible. Within a few minutes\nhe was dead. But those high names with which he christened Hans with his\ndying breath, clung to the old Hottentot for all his days. Indeed from\nthat day forward no native would ever have ventured to call him by any\nother. Among them, far and wide, they became his titles of honour.\n\nThe roar of the flames grew less and the tumult within their fiery\ncircle died away. For now the Mazitu were returning from the last fight\nin the market-place, if fight it could be called, bearing in their arms\ngreat bundles of the guns which they had collected from the dead Arabs,\nmost of whom had thrown down their weapons in a last wild effort to\nescape. But between the spears of the infuriated savages on the one hand\nand the devouring fire on the other what escape was there for them?\nThe blood-stained wretches who remained in the camps and towns of the\nslave-traders, along the eastern coast of Africa, or in the Isle of\nMadagascar, alone could tell how many were lost, since of those who went\nout from them to make war upon the Mazitu and their white friends, none\nreturned again with the long lines of expected captives. They had gone\nto their own place, of which sometimes that flaming African city has\nseemed to me a symbol. They were wicked men indeed, devils stalking the\nearth in human form, without pity, without shame. Yet I could not help\nfeeling sorry for them at the last, for truly their end was awful.\n\nThey brought the prisoners up to us, and among them, his white\nrobe half-burnt off him, I recognised the hideous pock-marked\nHassan-ben-Mohammed.\n\n\"I received your letter, written a while ago, in which you promised\nto make us die by fire, and, this morning, I received your message,\nHassan,\" I said, \"brought by the wounded lad who escaped from you when\nyou murdered his companions, and to both I sent you an answer. If none\nreached you, look around, for there is one written large in a tongue\nthat all can read.\"\n\nThe monster, for he was no less, flung himself upon the ground, praying\nfor mercy. Indeed, seeing Mrs. Eversley, he crawled to her and catching\nhold of her white robe, begged her to intercede for him.\n\n\"You made a slave of me after I had nursed you in the spotted sickness,\"\nshe answered, \"and tried to kill my husband for no fault. Through you,\nHassan, I have spent all the best years of my life among savages, alone\nand in despair. Still, for my part, I forgive you, but oh! may I never\nsee your face again.\"\n\nThen she wrenched herself free from his grasp and went away with her\ndaughter.\n\n\"I, too, forgive you, although you murdered my people and for twenty\nyears made my time a torment,\" said Brother John, who was one of the\ntruest Christians I have ever known. \"May God forgive you also\"; and he\nfollowed his wife and daughter.\n\nThen the old king, Bausi, who had come through that battle with a slight\nwound, spoke, saying:\n\n\"I am glad, Red Thief, that these white people have granted you what\nyou asked--namely, their forgiveness--since the deed is greatly to their\nhonour and causes me and my people to think them even nobler than we did\nbefore. But, O murderer of men and woman and trafficker in children, I\nam judge here, not the white people. Look on your work!\" and he pointed\nfirst to the lines of Zulu and Mazitu dead, and then to his burning\ntown. \"Look and remember the fate you promised to us who have never\nharmed you. Look! Look! Look! O Hyena of a man!\"\n\nAt this point I too went away, nor did I ever ask what became of Hassan\nand his fellow-captives. Moreover, whenever any of the natives or Hans\ntried to inform me, I bade them hold their tongues.\n\n\n\n                               EPILOGUE\n\nI have little more to add to this record, which I fear has grown into\nquite a long book. Or, at any rate, although the setting of it down has\namused me during the afternoons and evenings of this endless English\nwinter, now that the spring is come again I seem to have grown weary of\nwriting. Therefore I shall leave what remains untold to the imagination\nof anyone who chances to read these pages.\n\n\n\nWe were victorious, and had indeed much cause for gratitude who still\nlived to look upon the sun. Yet the night that followed the Battle of\nthe Gate was a sad one, at least for me, who felt the death of my friend\nthe foresighted hero, Mavovo, of the bombastic but faithful Sammy, and\nof my brave hunters more than I can say. Also the old Zulu's prophecy\nconcerning me, that I too should die in battle, weighed upon me, who\nseemed to have seen enough of such ends in recent days and to desire one\nmore tranquil.\n\nLiving here in peaceful England as I do now, with no present prospect\nof leaving it, it does not appear likely that it will be fulfilled. Yet,\nafter my experience of the divining powers of Mavovo's \"Snake\"--well,\nthose words of his make me feel uncomfortable. For when all is said\nand done, who can know the future? Moreover, it is the improbable that\ngenerally happens[*]\n\n[*] As the readers of \"Allan Quatermain\" will be aware, this prophecy\nof the dying Zulu was fulfilled. Mr. Quatermain died at Zuvendis as a\nresult of the wound he received in the battle between the armies of the\nrival Queens.--Editor.\n\nFurther, the climatic conditions were not conducive to cheerfulness, for\nshortly after sunset it began to rain and poured for most of the night,\nwhich, as we had little shelter, was inconvenient both to us and to all\nthe hundreds of the homeless Mazitu.\n\nHowever, the rain ceased in due time, and on the following morning\nthe welcome sun shone out of a clear sky. When we had dried and warmed\nourselves a little in its rays, someone suggested that we should visit\nthe burned-out town where, except for some smouldering heaps that\nhad been huts, the fire was extinguished by the heavy rain. More from\ncuriosity than for any other reason I consented and accompanied by\nBausi, Babemba and many of the Mazitu, all of us, except Brother John,\nwho remained behind to attend to the wounded, climbed over the debris\nof the south gate and walked through the black ruins of the huts, across\nthe market-place that was strewn with dead, to what had been our own\nquarters.\n\nThese were a melancholy sight, a mere heap of sodden and still smoking\nashes. I could have wept when I looked at them, thinking of all the\ntrade goods and stores that were consumed beneath, necessities for the\nmost part, the destruction of which must make our return journey one of\ngreat hardship.\n\nWell, there was nothing to be said or done, so after a few minutes of\ncontemplation we turned to continue our walk through what had been the\nroyal quarters to the north gate. Hans, who, I noted, had been ferreting\nabout in his furtive way as though he were looking for something, and I\nwere the last to leave. Suddenly he laid his hand upon my arm and said:\n\n\"Baas, listen! I hear a ghost. I think it is the ghost of Sammy asking\nus to bury him.\"\n\n\"Bosh!\" I answered, and then listened as hard as I could.\n\nNow I also seemed to hear something coming from I knew not where, words\nwhich were frequently repeated and which seemed to be:\n\n\"_O Mr. Quatermain, I beg you to be so good as to open the door of this\noven._\"\n\nFor a while I thought I must be cracked. However, I called back the\nothers and we all listened. Of a sudden Hans made a pounce, like a\nterrier does at the run of a mole that he hears working underground, and\nbegan to drag, or rather to shovel, at a heap of ashes in front of us,\nusing a bit of wood as they were still too hot for his hands. Then we\nlistened again and this time heard the voice quite clearly coming from\nthe ground.\n\n\"Baas,\" said Hans, \"it is Sammy in the corn-pit!\"\n\nNow I remembered that such a pit existed in front of the huts which,\nalthough empty at the time, was, as is common among the Bantu natives,\nused to preserve corn that would not immediately be needed. Once I\nmyself went through a very tragic experience in one of these pits,\nas any who may read the history of my first wife, that I have called\n_Marie_, can see for themselves.\n\nSoon we cleared the place and had lifted the stone, with ventilating\nholes in it--well was it for Sammy that those ventilating holes existed;\nalso that the stone did not fit tight. Beneath was a bottle-shaped and\ncemented structure about ten feet deep by, say, eight wide. Instantly\nthrough the mouth of this structure appeared the head of Sammy with his\nmouth wide open like that of a fish gasping for air. We pulled him out,\na process that caused him to howl, for the heat had made his skin\nvery tender, and gave him water which one of the Mazitu fetched from\na spring. Then I asked him indignantly what he was doing in that hole,\nwhile we wasted our tears, thinking that he was dead.\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Quatermain,\" he said, \"I am a victim of too faithful service.\nTo abandon all these valuable possessions of yours to a rapacious enemy\nwas more than I could bear. So I put every one of them in the pit, and\nthen, as I thought I heard someone coming, got in myself and pulled down\nthe stone. But, Mr. Quatermain, soon afterwards the enemy added arson to\nmurder and pillage, and the whole place began to blaze. I could hear the\nfire roaring above and a little later the ashes covered the exit so that\nI could no longer lift the stone, which indeed grew too hot to touch.\nHere, then, I sat all night in the most suffocating heat, very much\nafraid, Mr. Quatermain, lest the two kegs of gunpowder that were with me\nshould explode, till at last, just as I had abandoned hope and prepared\nto die like a tortoise baked alive by a bushman, I heard your welcome\nvoice. And Mr. Quatermain, if there is any soothing ointment to spare, I\nshall be much obliged, for I am scorched all over.\"\n\n\"Ah! Sammy, Sammy,\" I said, \"you see what comes of cowardice? On the\nhill with us you would not have been scorched, and it is only by the\nmerest chance of owing to Hans's quick hearing that you were not left to\nperish miserably in that hole.\"\n\n\"That is so, Mr. Quatermain. I plead guilty to the hot impeachment. But\non the hill I might have been shot, which is worse than being scorched.\nAlso you gave me charge of your goods and I determined to preserve them\neven at the risk of personal comfort. Lastly, the angel who watches me\nbrought you here in time before I was quite cooked through. So all's\nwell that ends well, Mr. Quatermain, though it is true that for my\npart I have had enough of bloody war, and if I live to regain civilized\nregions I propose henceforth to follow the art of food-dressing in the\nsafe kitchen of an hotel; that is, if I cannot obtain a berth as an\ninstructor in the English tongue!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"all's well that ends well, Sammy my boy, and at any\nrate you have saved the stores, for which we should be thankful to you.\nSo go along with Mr. Stephen and get doctored while we haul them out of\nthat grain-pit.\"\n\nThree days later we bid farewell to old Bausi, who almost wept at\nparting with us, and the Mazitu, who were already engaged in the\nre-building of their town. Mavovo and the other Zulus who died in the\nBattle of the Gate, we buried on the ridge opposite to it, raising\na mound of earth over them that thereby they might be remembered in\ngenerations to come, and laying around them the Mazitu who had fallen\nin the fight. As we passed that mound on our homeward journey, the\nZulus who remained alive, including two wounded men who were carried\nin litters, stopped and saluted solemnly, praising the dead with loud\nsongs. We white people too saluted, but in silence, by raising our hats.\n\nBy the way, I should add that in this matter also Mavovo's \"Snake\" did\nnot lie. He had said that six of his company would be killed upon our\nexpedition, and six were killed, neither more nor less.\n\nAfter much consulting we determined to take the overland route back\nto Natal, first because it was always possible that the slave-trading\nfraternity, hearing of their terrible losses, might try to attack us\nagain on the coast, and secondly for the reason that even if they did\nnot, months or perhaps years might pass before we found a ship at Kilwa,\nthen a port of ill repute, to carry us to any civilized place. Moreover,\nBrother John, who had travelled it, knew the inland road well and had\nestablished friendly relations with the tribes through whose country we\nmust pass, till we reached the brothers of Zululand, where I was always\nwelcome. So as the Mazitu furnished us with an escort and plenty\nof bearers for the first part of the road and, thanks to Sammy's\nstewardship in the corn-pit, we had ample trade goods left to hire\nothers later on, we made up our minds to risk the longer journey.\n\nAs it turned out this was a wise conclusion, since although it took\nfour weary months, in the end we accomplished it without any accident\nwhatsoever, if I except a slight attack of fever from which both Miss\nHope and I suffered for a while. Also we got some good shooting on the\nroad. My only regret was that this change of plan obliged us to abandon\nthe tusks of ivory we had captured from the slavers and buried where we\nalone could find them.\n\nStill, it was a dull time for me, who, for obvious reasons, of which I\nhave already spoken, was literally a fifth wheel to the coach. Hans was\nan excellent fellow, and, as the reader knows, quite a genius in his\nown way, but night after night in Hans's society began to pall on me at\nlast, while even his conversation about my \"reverend father,\" who seemed\npositively to haunt him, acquired a certain sameness. Of course, we\nhad other subjects in common, especially those connected with Retief's\nmassacre, whereof we were the only two survivors, but of these I seldom\ncared to speak. They were and still remain too painful.\n\nTherefore, for my part I was thankful when at last, in Zululand, we fell\nin with some traders whom I knew, who hired us one of their wagons. In\nthis vehicle, abandoning the worn-out donkeys and the white ox, which\nwe presented to a chief of my acquaintance, Brother John and the ladies\nproceeded to Durban, Stephen attending them on a horse that we had\nbought, while I, with Hans, attached myself to the traders.\n\nAt Durban a surprise awaited us since, as we trekked into the town,\nwhich at that time was still a small place, whom should we meet but Sir\nAlexander Somers, who, hearing that wagons were coming from Zululand,\nhad ridden out in the hope of obtaining news of us. It seemed that the\ncholeric old gentleman's anxiety concerning his son had so weighed on\nhis mind that at length he made up his mind to proceed to Africa to hunt\nfor him. So there he was. The meeting between the two was affectionate\nbut peculiar.\n\n\"Hullo, dad!\" said Stephen. \"Whoever would have thought of seeing you\nhere?\"\n\n\"Hullo, Stephen,\" said his father. \"Whoever would have expected to find\nyou alive and looking well--yes, very well? It is more than you deserve,\nyou young ass, and I hope you won't do it again.\"\n\nHaving delivered himself thus, the old boy seized Stephen by the hair\nand solemnly kissed him on the brow.\n\n\"No, dad,\" answered his son, \"I don't mean to do it again, but thanks\nto Allan there we've come through all right. And, by the way, let me\nintroduce you to the lady I am going to marry, also to her father and\nmother.\"\n\nWell, all the rest may be imagined. They were married a fortnight later\nin Durban and a very pleasant affair it was, since Sir Alexander, who\nby the way, treated me most handsomely from a business point of\nview, literally entertained the whole town on that festive occasion.\nImmediately afterwards Stephen, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Eversley\nand his father, took his wife home \"to be educated,\" though what that\nprocess consisted of I never heard. Hans and I saw them off at the Point\nand our parting was rather sad, although Hans went back the richer\nby the \u00a3500 which Stephen had promised him. He bought a farm with the\nmoney, and on the strength of his exploits, established himself as a\nkind of little chief. Of whom more later--as they say in the pedigree\nbooks.\n\nSammy, too, was set up as the proprietor of a small hotel, where\nhe spent most of his time in the bar dilating to the customers in\nmagnificent sentences that reminded me of the style of a poem called\n\"The Essay on Man\" (which I once tried to read and couldn't), about\nhis feats as a warrior among the wild Mazitu and the man-eating,\ndevil-worshipping Pongo tribes.\n\nTwo years or less afterwards I received a letter, from which I must\nquote a passage:\n\n\n \"As I told you, my father has given a living which he owns to Mr.\n  Eversley, a pretty little place where there isn't much for a\n  parson to do. I think it rather bores my respected parents-in-law.\n  At any rate, 'Dogeetah' spends a lot of his time wandering about\n  the New Forest, which is near by, with a butterfly-net and trying\n  to imagine that he is back in Africa. The 'Mother of the Flower'\n  (who, after a long course of boot-kissing mutes, doesn't get on\n  with English servants) has another amusement. There is a small\n  lake in the Rectory grounds in which is a little island. Here she\n  has put up a reed fence round a laurustinus bush which flowers at\n  the same time of year as did the Holy Flower, and within this reed\n  fence she sits whenever the weather will allow, as I believe going\n  through 'the rites of the Flower.' At least when I called upon her\n  there one day, in a boat, I found her wearing a white robe and\n  singing some mystical native song.\"\n\n\nMany years have gone by since then. Both Brother John and his wife have\ndeparted to their rest and their strange story, the strangest almost of\nall stories, is practically forgotten. Stephen, whose father has also\ndeparted, is a prosperous baronet and rather heavy member of Parliament\nand magistrate, the father of many fine children, for the Miss Hope\nof old days has proved as fruitful as a daughter of the Goddess of\nFertility, for that was the \"Mother's\" real office, ought to be.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" she said to me one day with a laugh, as she surveyed a\nlarge (and noisy) selection of her numerous offspring, \"sometimes, O\nAllan\"--she still retains that trick of speech--\"I wish that I were back\nin the peace of the Home of the Flower. Ah!\" she added with something of\na thrill in her voice, \"never can I forget the blue of the sacred lake\nor the sight of those skies at dawn. Do you think that I shall see them\nagain when I die, O Allan?\"\n\nAt the time I thought it rather ungrateful of her to speak thus, but\nafter all human nature is a queer thing and we are all of us attached to\nthe scenes of our childhood and long at times again to breathe our natal\nair.\n\nI went to see Sir Stephen the other day, and in his splendid greenhouses\nthe head gardener, Woodden, an old man now, showed me three noble,\nlong-leaved plants which sprang from the seed of the Holy Flower that I\nhad saved in my pocket.\n\nBut they have not yet bloomed.\n\nSomehow I wonder what will happen when they do. It seems to me as though\nwhen once more the glory of that golden bloom is seen of the eyes of\nmen, the ghosts of the terrible god of the Forest, of the hellish and\nmysterious Motombo, and perhaps of the Mother of the Flower herself,\nwill be there to do it reverence. If so, what gifts will they bring to\nthose who stole and reared the sacred seed?\n\n\n\nP.S.--I shall know ere long, for just as I laid down my pen a triumphant\nepistle from Stephen was handed to me in which he writes excitedly that\nat length two of the three plants are _showing for flower_.\n\n                                                 Allan Quatermain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Allan and the Holy Flower, by H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
