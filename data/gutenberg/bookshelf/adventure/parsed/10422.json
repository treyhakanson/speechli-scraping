IN THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR COMMODUS\n\n\n\nGolden Antioch lay like a jewel at a mountain's throat.  Wide,\nintersecting streets, each nearly four miles long, granite-paved, and\nmarble-colonnaded, swarmed with fashionable loiterers.  The gay\nAntiochenes, whom nothing except frequent earthquakes interrupted from\npursuit of pleasure, were taking the air in chariots, in litters, and on\nfoot;  their linen clothes were as riotously picturesque as was the\nfruit displayed in open shop-fronts under the colonnades, or as the\nblossom on the trees in public gardens, which made of the city, as seen\nfrom the height of the citadel, a mosaic of green and white.\n\nThe crowd on the main thoroughfares was aristocratic;  opulence was\naccented by groups of slaves in close attendance on their owners;  but\nthe aristocracy was sharply differentiated.  The Romans, frequently less\nwealthy (because those who had made money went to Rome to spend it)--\nfrequently less educated and, in general, not less dissolute--despised\nthe Antiochenes, although the Romans loved Antioch.  The cosmopolitan\nAntiochenes returned the compliment, regarding Romans as mere duffers in\ndepravity, philistines in art, but capable in war and government, and\nconsequently to be feared, if not respected.  So there was not much\nmingling of the groups, whose slaves took example from their masters,\naffecting in public a scorn that they did not feel but were careful to\nassert.  The Romans were intensely dignified and wore the toga, pallium\nand tunic;  the Antiochenes affected to think dignity was stupid and its\ntrappings (forbidden to them) hideous;  so they carried the contrary\npose to extremes. Patterning herself on Alexandria, the city had become\nto all intents and purposes the eastern capital of Roman empire.  North,\nsouth, east and west, the trade-routes intersected, entering the city\nthrough the ornate gates in crenelated limestone walls. From miles away\nthe approaching caravans were overlooked by legionaries brought from\nGaul and Britain, quartered in the capitol on Mount Silpius at the\ncity's southern limit.  The riches of the East, and of Egypt, flowed\nthrough, leaving their deposit as a river drops its silt;  were ever-\nincreasing.  One quarter, walled off, hummed with foreign traders from\nas far away as India, who lodged at the travelers' inns or haunted the\ntemples, the wine-shops and the lupanars.  In that quarter, too, there\nwere barracks, with compounds and open-fronted booths, where slaves were\nexposed for sale;  and there, also, were the caravanserais within whose\nwalls the kneeling camels grumbled and the blossomy spring air grew\nfetid with the reek of dung.  There was a market-place for elephants and\nother oriental beasts.\n\nEach of Antioch's four divisions had its own wall, pierced by arched\ngates.  Those were necessary.  No more turbulent and fickle population\nlived in the known world--not even in Alexandria.  Whenever an\nearthquake shook down blocks of buildings--and that happened nearly as\nfrequently as the hysterical racial riots--the Romans rebuilt with a\nview to making communications easier from the citadel, where the great\ntemple of Jupiter Capitolinus frowned over the gridironed streets.\n\nRoman officials and the wealthier Macedonian Antiochenes lived on an\nisland, formed by a curve of the River Orontes at the northern end\nwithin the city wall.  The never-neglected problem of administration was\nto keep a clear route along which troops could move from citadel to\nisland when the rioting began.\n\nOn the island was the palace, glittering with gilt and marble, gay with\ncolored awnings, where kings had lived magnificently until Romans saved\nthe city from them, substituting a proconsular paternal kind of tyranny\noriginating in the Roman patria potestas.  There was not much sentiment\nabout it.  Rome became the foster-parent, the possessor of authority.\nThere was duty, principally exacted from the governed in the form of\ntaxes and obedience;  and there were privileges, mostly reserved for the\nrulers and their parasites, who were much more numerous than anybody\nliked.  Competition made the parasites as discontented as their prey.\n\nBut there were definite advantages of Roman rule, which no Antiochene\ndenied, although their comic actors and the slaves who sang at private\nentertainments mocked the Romans and invented accusations of injustice\nand extortion that were even more outrageous than the truth.  Not since\nthe days when Antioch inherited the luxury and vices of the Greeks and\nSyrians, had pleasure been so organized or its commercial pursuit so\nprofitable.  Taxes were collected rigorously.  The demands of Rome,\nincreased by the extravagance of Commodus, were merciless. But trade was\ngood.  Obedience and flattery were well rewarded. Citizens who yielded\nto extortion and refrained from criticism within hearing of informers\nlived in reasonable expectation of surviving the coming night.\n\nBut the informers were ubiquitous and unknown, which was another reason\nwhy the Romans and Antiochenes refrained from mixing socially more than\ncould be helped.  A secret charge of treason, based on nothing more than\nan informer's malice, might set even a Roman citizen outside the pale of\nordinary law and make him liable to torture.  If convicted, death and\nconfiscation followed.  Since the deification of the emperors it had\nbecome treason even to use a coarse expression near their images or\nstatues;  images were on the coins;  statues were in the streets.\nCommodus, to whom all confiscated property accrued, was in ever-\nincreasing need of funds to defray the titanic expense of the games that\nhe lavished on Rome and the \"presents\" with which he studiously nursed\nthe army's loyalty.  So it was wise to be taciturn;   expedient to\nchoose one's friends deliberately; not far removed from madness to be\nseen in company with those whose antecedents might suggest the\npossibility of a political intrigue.  But it was also unwise to woo\nsolitude;  a solitary man might perish by the rack and sword for lack of\nwitnesses, if charged with some serious offense.\n\nSo there were comradeships more loyal the more that treachery stalked\nabroad.  Because seriousness drew attention from the spies, the deepest\nthoughts were masked beneath an air of levity, and merrymaking hid such\ncounsels as might come within the vaguely defined boundaries of treason.\n\nSextus, son of Maximus, rode not alone.  Norbanus rode beside him, and\nbehind them Scylax on the famous Arab mare that Sextus had won from\nArtaxes the Persian in a wager on the recent chariot races.  Scylax was\na slave but no less, for that reason, Sextus' friend.\n\nNorbanus rode a skewbald Cappadocian that kicked out sidewise at\npedestrians;  so there was opportunity for private conversation, even on\nthe road to Daphne of an afternoon in spring, when nearly all of\nfashionable Antioch was beginning to flow in that direction.  Horses,\nlitters and chariots, followed by crowds of slaves on foot with the\nprovisions for moonlight banquets, poured toward the northern gate, some\novertaking and passing the three but riding wide of the skewbald\nCappadocian stallion's heels.\n\n\"If Pertinax should really come,\" said Sextus.\n\n\"He will have a girl with him,\" Norbanus interrupted.  He had an\nannoying way of finishing the sentences that other folk began.\n\n\"True.  When he is not campaigning Pertinax finds a woman irresistible.\"\n\n\"And naturally, also, none resists a general in the field!\" Norbanus\nadded.  \"So our handsome Pertinax performs his vows to Aphrodite with a\nconstancy that the goddess rewards by forever putting lovely women in\nhis way!  Whereas Stoics like you, Sextus, and unfortunates like me, who\ndon't know how to amuse a woman, are made notorious by one least lapse\nfrom our austerity. The handsome, dissolute ones have all the luck.  The\nroisterers at Daphne will invent such scandalous tales of us tonight as\nwill pursue us for a lustrum, and yet there isn't a chance in a thousand\nthat we shall even enjoy ourselves!\"\n\n\"Yes.  I wish now we had chosen any other meeting place than Daphne,\"\nSextus answered gloomily.  \"What odds?  Had we gone into the desert\nPertinax would have brought his own last desperate adorer, and a couple\nmore to bore us while he makes himself ridiculous.  Strange--that a man\nso firm in war and wise in government should lose his head the moment a\nwoman smiles at him.\"\n\n\"He doesn't lose his head--much,\" Sextus answered.  \"But his father was\na firewood seller in a village in Liguria. That is why he so loves money\nand the latest fashions.  Poverty and rags--austerity inflicted on him\nin his youth--great Jupiter!  If you and I had risen from the charcoal-\nburning to be consul twice and a grammarian and the friend of Marcus\nAurelius;  if you and I were as handsome as he is, and had experienced a\ntriumph after restoring discipline in Britain and conducting two or\nthree successful wars;  and if either of us had such a wife as Flavia\nTitiana, I believe we could besmirch ourselves more constantly than\nPertinax does!  It is not that he delights in women so much as that he\nthinks debauch is aristocratic.  Flavia Titiana is unfaithful to him.\nShe is also a patrician and unusually clever. He has never understood\nher, but she is witty, so he thinks her wonderful and tries to imitate\nher immorality.  But the only woman who really sways him is the proudish\nCornificia, who is almost as incapable of treachery as Pertinax himself.\nHe is the best governor the City of Rome has had in our generation.  Can\nyou imagine what Rome would be like without him?  Call to mind what it\nwas like when Fuscianus was the governor!\"\n\n\"These are strange times, Sextus!\"\n\n\"Aye!  And it is a strange beast we have for emperor!\"\n\n\"Be careful!\"\n\nSextus glanced over his shoulder to make sure that Scylax followed\nclosely and prevented any one from overhearing.  There was an endless\nprocession now, before and behind, all bound for Daphne.  As the riders\npassed under the city gate, where the golden cherubim that Titus took\nfrom the Jews' temple in Jerusalem gleamed in the westering sun, Sextus\nnoticed a slave of the municipium who wrote down the names of\nindividuals who came and went.\n\n\"There are new proscriptions brewing,\" he remarked.  \"Some friends of\nours will not see sunrise.  Well--I am in a mood to talk and I will not\nbe silenced.\"\n\n\"Better laugh then!\" Norbanus advised.  \"The deadliest crime nowadays is\nto have the appearance of being serious.  None suspects a drunken or a\ngay man.\"\n\nSextus, however, was at no pains to appear gay.  He inherited the\nmoribund traditions that the older Cato had typified some centuries ago.\nHis young face had the sober, chiseled earnestness that had been\ntypically Roman in the sterner days of the Republic.  He had blue-gray\neyes that challenged destiny, and curly brown hair, that suggested\nflames as the westering sun brought out its redness.  Such mirth as\nhaunted his rebellious lips was rather cynical than genial.  There was\nno weakness visible.  He had a pugnacious neck and shoulders.\n\n\"I am the son of my father Maximus,\" he said, \"and of my grandsire\nSextus, and of his father Maximus, and of my great-great-grandsire\nSextus.  It offends my dignity that men should call a hog like Commodus\na god.  I will not.  I despise Rome for submission to him.\"\n\n\"Yet what else is there in the world except to be a Roman citizen?\"\nNorbanus asked.\n\n\"As for being, there is nothing else,\" said Sextus.  \"I would like to\nspeak of doing.  It is what I do that answers what I am.\"\n\n\"Then let it answer now!\" Norbanus laughed.  He pointed to a little\nshrine beside the road, beneath a group of trees, where once the image\nof a local deity had smiled its blessing on the passer-by.  The bust of\nCommodus, as insolent as the brass of which the artist-slaves had cast\nit, had replaced the old benign divinity.  There was an attendant near\nby, costumed as a priest, whose duty was to see that travelers by that\nroad did their homage to the image of the human god who ruled the Roman\nworld. He struck a gong.  He gave fair warning of the deference\nrequired.  There was a little guard-house, fifty paces distant, just\naround the corner of the clump of trees, where the police were ready to\nexecute summary justice, and floggings were inflicted on offenders who\ncould not claim citizenship or who had no coin with which to buy the\nalternative reprimand.  Roman citizens were placed under arrest, to be\nsubmitted to all manner of indignities and to think themselves fortunate\nif they should escape with a heavy fine from a judge who had bought his\noffice from an emperor's favorite.\n\nMost of the riders ahead dismounted and walked past the image, saluting\nit with right hands raised.  Many of them tossed coins to the priest's\nattendant slave.  Sextus remained in the saddle, his brow clouded with\nan angry scowl.  He drew rein, making no obeisance, but sent Scylax to\npresent an offering of money to the priest, then rode on.\n\n\"Your dignity appears to me expensive!\" Norbanus remarked, grinning.\n\"Gold?\"\n\n\"He may have my gold, if I may keep my self-respect!\"\n\n\"Incorrigible stoic!  He will take that also before long!\"\n\n\"I think not.  Commodus has lost his own and destroyed Rome's, but mine\nnot yet.  I wish, though, that my father were in Antioch.  He, too, is\nno cringer to images of beasts in purple. I wrote to my father recently\nand warned him to leave Rome before Commodus's spies could invent an\nexcuse for confiscating our estates.  I said, an absent man attracts\nless notice, and our estates are well worth plundering.  I also hinted\nthat Commodus can hardly live forever, and reminded him that tides flow\nin and out--by which I meant him to understand that the next emperor may\nbe another such as Aurelius, who will persecute the Christians but let\nhonest men live in peace, instead of favoring the Christians and ridding\nRome of honest men.\"\n\nNorbanus made a gesture with his right hand that sent the Cappadocian\ncavorting to the road's edge, scattering a little crowd that was trying\nto pass.\n\n\"Why be jealous of the Christians?\" he laughed.  \"Isn't it their turn\nfor a respite?  Think of what Nero did to them;  and Marcus Aurelius did\nlittle less.  They will catch it again when Commodus turns on his\nmistress Marcia;  he will harry them all the more when that day comes--\nas it is sure to.  Marcia is a Christian; when he tires of her he will\nuse her Christianity for the excuse and throw the Christians to the\nlions by the thousand in order to justify himself for murdering the only\ndecent woman of his acquaintance.  Sic semper tyrannus.  Say what you\nwill about Marcia, she has done her best to keep Commodus from making a\npublic exhibition of himself.\"\n\n\"With what result?  He boasts he has killed no less than twelve hundred\npoor devils with his own hand in the arena.  True, he takes the\npseudonym of Paulus when he kills lions with his javelin and drives a\nchariot in the races like a vulgar slave. But everybody knows, and he\npicks slaves for his ministers--consider that vile beast Cleander, whom\neven the rabble refused to endure another day.  I don't see that\nMarcia's influence amounts to much.\"\n\n\"But Cleander was executed finally.  You are in a glum mood, Sextus.\nWhat has happened to upset you?\"\n\n\"It is the nothing that has happened.  There has come no answer to that\nletter I wrote to my father in Rome.  Commodus's informers may have\nintercepted it.\"\n\nNorbanus whistled softly.  The skewbald Cappadocian mistook that for a\nsignal to exert himself and for a minute there were ructions while his\nmaster reined him in.\n\n\"When did you write?\" he demanded, when he had the horse under control\nagain.\n\n\"A month ago.\"\n\nNorbanus lapsed into a moody silence, critically staring at his friend\nwhen he was sure the other was not looking.  Sextus had always puzzled\nhim by running risks that other men (himself, for instance) steadfastly\navoided, and avoiding risks that other men thought insignificant.  To\nwrite a letter critical of Commodus was almost tantamount to suicide,\nsince every Roman port and every rest-house on the roads that led to\nRome had become infested with informers who were paid on a percentage\nbasis.\n\n\"Are you weary of life?\" he asked after a while.\n\n\"I am weary of Commodus--weary of tyranny--weary of lies and hypocrisy--\nweary of wondering what is to happen to Rome that submits to such\nbestial government--weary of shame and of the insolence of bribe-fat\nmagistrates--\"\n\n\"Weary of your friends?\" Norbanus asked.  \"Don't you realize that if\nyour letter fell into the hands of spies, not only will you be\nproscribed and your father executed, but whoever is known to have been\nintimate with you or with your father will be in almost equal danger?\nYou should have gone to Rome in person to consult your father.\"\n\n\"He ordered me to stay here to protect his interests.  We are rich,\nNorbanus.  We have much property in Antioch and many tenants to oversee.\nI am not one of these modern irreligious wastrels;  I obey my father--\"\n\n\"And betray him in an idiotic letter!\"\n\n\"Very well! Desert me while there is time!\" said Sextus angrily.\n\n\"Don't be a fool!  You are not the only proud man in the empire, Sextus.\nI don't desert my friend for such a coward's reason as that he acted\nthoughtlessly.  But I will tell you what I think, whether or not that\npleases you, if only because I am your true friend.  You are a rash,\nimpatient lover of the days gone by, possessed of genius that you betray\nby your arrogant hastiness. So now you know what I think, and what all\nyour other friends think.  We admire--we love our Sextus, son of\nMaximus.  And we confess to ourselves that our lives are in danger\nbecause of that same Sextus, son of Maximus, whom we prefer above our\nsafety. After this, if you continue to deceive yourself, none can blame\nme for it!\"\n\nSextus smiled and waved a hand to him.  It was no new revelation. He\nunderstood the attitude of all his friends far better than he did his\nown strange impulses that took possession of him as a rule when\ncircumstances least provided an excuse.\n\n\"My theory of loyalty to friendship,\" he remarked, \"is that a man should\ndare to do what he perceives is right, and thus should prove himself\nentitled to respect.\"\n\n\"And your friends are, in consequence, to enjoy the privilege of\nattending your crucifixion one of these days!\" said Norbanus.\n\n\"Nonsense.  Only slaves and highwaymen are crucified.\"\n\n\"They call any one a highwayman who is a fugitive from what our 'Roman\nHercules' calls justice,\" Norbanus answered with a gesture of\nirritation.  His own trick of finishing people's sentences did not annoy\nSextus nearly as much as Sextus's trick of pounding on inaccuracies\nirritated him.  He pressed his horse into a canter and for a while they\nrode beside the stream called the \"Donkey-drowner\" without further\nconversation, each man striving to subdue the ill-temper that was on the\nverge of outbreak.\n\nRomans of the old school valued inner calm as highly as they did the\nouter semblances of dignity;  even the more modern Romans imitated that\ndistinctive attitude, pretending to Augustan calmness that had actually\nceased to be a part of public life. But with Sextus and Norbanus the\ninner struggle to be self-controlled was genuine;  they bridled\nirritation in the same way that they forced their horses to obey them--\ncaptains of their own souls, as it were, and scornful of changefulness.\n\nSextus, being the only son of a great landowner, and raised in the\ntraditions of a secluded valley fifty leagues away from Rome, was almost\nhalf a priest by privilege of ancestry.  He had been educated in the\nlocal priestly college, had himself performed the daily sacrifices that\ntradition imposed on the heads of families and, in his father's frequent\nabsence, had attended to all the details and responsibilities of\nmanaging a large estate.  The gods of wood and stream and dale were very\nreal to him.  The daily offering, from each meal, to the manes of his\nancestors, whose images in wax and wood and marble were preserved in the\nlittle chapel attached to the old brick homestead, had inspired in him a\nfeeling that the past was forever present and a man's thoughts were as\nimportant as his deeds.\n\nNorbanus, on the other hand, a younger son of a man less amply dowered\nwith wealth and traditional authority, had other reasons for adopting,\nrather than inheriting, an attitude toward life not dissimilar from that\nof Sextus.  Gods of wood and stream to him meant very little, and he had\nnot family estates to hold him to the ancient views.  To him the future\nwas more real than the past, which he regarded as a state of ignorance\nfrom which the world was tediously struggling.  But inherently he loved\nlife's decencies, although he mocked their sentimental imitations;  and\nhe followed Sextus--squandered hours with him, neglecting his own\ninterests (which after all were nothing too important and were well\nenough looked after by a Syracusan slave), simply because Sextus was a\nmanly sort of fellow whose friendship stirred in him emotions that he\nfelt were satisfying.  He was a born follower. His ugly face and rather\nmirth-provoking blue eyes, the loose, beautifully balanced seat on\nhorseback and the cavalry-like carriage of his shoulders, served their\nnotice to the world at large that he would stick to friends of his own\nchoosing and for purely personal reasons, in spite of, and in the teeth\nof anything.\n\n\"As I said,\" remarked Sextus, \"if Pertinax comes--\"\n\n\"He will show us how foolish a soldier can be in the arms of a woman,\"\nNorbanus remarked, laughing again, glad the long silence was broken.\n\n\"Orcus (the messenger of Dis, who carried dead souls to the underworld.\nThe masked slaves who dragged dead gladiators out of the arena were\ndisguised to represent Orcus) take his women! What I was going to say\nwas, we shall learn from him the real news from Rome.\"\n\n\"All the names of the popular dancers!\"\n\n\"And if Galen is there we shall learn--\"\n\n\"About Commodus' health.  That is more to the point.  Now if we could\nget into Galen's chest of medicines and substitute--\"\n\n\"Galen is an honest doctor,\" Sextus interrupted.  \"If Galen is there we\nwill find out what the philosophers are discussing in Rome when spies\naren't listening.  Pertinax dresses himself like a strutting peacock and\npretends that women and money are his only interests, but what the wise\nones said yesterday, Pertinax does today;  and what they say today, he\nwill do tomorrow.  He can look more like a popinjay and act more like a\nman than any one in Rome.\"\n\n\"Who cares how they behave in Rome?  The city has gone mad,\" Norbanus\nanswered.  \"Nowadays the best a man can do is to preserve his own goods\nand his own health.  Ride to a conference do we?  Well, nothing but\nwords will come of it, and words are dangerous.  I like my danger\ntangible and in the open where it can be faced.  Three times last week I\nwas approached by Glyco--you remember him?--that son of Cocles and the\nJewess--asking me to join a secret mystery of which he claims to be the\nunextinguishable lamp.  But there are too many mysteries and not enough\nplain dealing.  The only mystery about Glyco is how he avoids indictment\nfor conspiracy--what with his long nose and sly eyes, and his way of\nhinting that he knows enough to turn the world upside down.  If Pertinax\ntalks mystery I will class him with the other foxes who slink into holes\nwhen the agenda look like becoming acta.  Show me only a raised standard\nin an open field and I will take my chance beside it.  But I sicken of\nall this talk of what we might do if only somebody had the courage to\nstick a dagger into Commodus.\"\n\n\"The men who could persuade themselves to do that, are persuaded that a\nworse brute might succeed him,\" Sextus answered.  \"It is no use killing\na Commodus to find a Nero in his shoes.  If the successor were in sight\n--and visibly a man not a monster--there are plenty of men brave enough\nto give the dagger-thrust.  But the praetorian guard, that makes and\nunmakes emperors, has been tasting the sweets of tyranny ever since\nMarcus Aurelius died. They despise their 'Roman Hercules' (Commodus'\nfavorite name for himself)--who doesn't?  But they grow fat and enjoy\nthemselves under his tyranny, so they would never consent to leaving him\nunguarded, as happened to Nero, for instance, or to replacing him with\nany one of the caliber of Aurelius, if such a man could be found.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what do we go to talk about?\" Norbanus asked.\n\n\"We go for information.\"\n\n\"Dea dia! (the most mysterious of all the Roman deities)  We inform\nourselves that Rome has been renamed 'The City of Commodus'--that\noffices are bought and sold--that there were forty consuls in a year,\neach of whom paid for the office in turn--that no man's life is safe--\nthat it is wiser to take a cold in the head to Galen than to kiss a\nmule's nose (it was a common superstition that a cold in the head could\nbe cured by kissing a mule's nose)--and then what?  I begin to think\nthat Pertinax is wiser to amuse himself with women after all!\"\n\nSextus edged his horse a little closer to the skewbald and for more than\na minute appeared to be studying Norbanus' face, the other grinning at\nhim and making the stallion prance.\n\n\"Are you never serious?\" asked Sextus.\n\n\"Always and forever, melancholy friend of mine!  I seriously dread the\nconsequences of that letter that you wrote to Rome! Unlike you, I have\nnot much more than life to lose, but I value it all the more for being\nless encumbered.  Like Apollonius, I pray for few possessions and no\nneeds!  But what I have, I treasure;  I propose to live long and make\nuse of life!\"\n\n\"And I!\" retorted Sextus.\n\nWith a gesture of disgust, he turned to stare behind him at the crowd on\nits way to Daphne, making such a business of pleasure as reduced the\npleasure to a toil of Sisyphus (who had to roll a heavy stone\nperpetually up a steep hill in the underworld. Before he reached the top\nthe stone always rolled down again).\n\n\"I have more than gold,\" said Sextus, \"which it seems to me that any\ncrooked-minded fool may have.  I have a spirit in me and a taste for\nphilosophies;  I have a feeling that a man's life is a gift entrusted to\nhim by the gods--for use--to be preserved--\"\n\n\"By writing foolish letters, doubtless!\" said Norbanus.  \"Come along,\nlet us gallop.  I am weary of the backs of all these roisterers.\"\n\nAnd so they rode to Daphne full pelt, greatly to the anger of the too\nwell dressed Antiochenes, who cursed them for the mud they splashed from\nwayside pools and for the dung and dust they kicked up into plucked and\npenciled faces.\n\n\n\n\nII.  A CONFERENCE AT DAPHNE\n\n\n\nIt was not yet dusk.  The sun shone on the bronze roof of the temple of\nApollo, making such a contrast to, and harmony with, marble and the\ngreen of giant cypresses as only music can suggest.  The dying breeze\nstirred hardly a ripple on the winding ponds, so marble columns, trees\nand statuary were reflected amid shadows of the swans in water tinted by\nthe colors of the sinking sun.  There was a murmur of wind in the tops\nof the trees and a stirring of linen-clad girls near the temple\nentrance--voices droning from the near-by booths behind the shrubbery--\none flute, like the plaint of Orpheus summoning Eurydice--a blossom-\nscented air and an enfolding mystery of silence.\n\nPertinax, the governor of Rome, had merely hinted at Olympian desire,\nwhereat some rich Antiochenes, long privileged, had been ejected with\nscant ceremony from a small marble pavilion on an islet, formed by a\nbranch of the River Ladon that had been guided twenty years ago by\nHadrian's engineers in curves of exquisitely studied beauty.  From\nbetween Corinthian columns was a view of nearly all the temple precincts\nand of the lawns where revelers would presently forget restraint.  The\nfirst night of the Daphne season usually was the wildest night of all\nthe year, but they began demurely, and for the present there was the\nrestraint of expectation.\n\nBecause there was yet snow on mountain-tops and the balmy air would\ncarry a suggestion of a chill at sunset, there were cunningly wrought\ncharcoal braziers set near the gilded couches, grouped around a\nsemicircular low table so as to give each guest an unobstructed view\nfrom the pavilion.  Pertinax--neither guest nor host, but a god, as it\nwere, who had arrived and permitted the city of Antioch to ennoble\nitself by paying his expenses--stretched his long length on the middle\ncouch, with Galen the physician on his right hand, Sextus on his left.\nBeyond Galen lay Tarquinius Divius and Sulpicius Glabrio, friends of\nPertinax; and on Sextus' left was Norbanus, and beyond him Marcus Fabius\na young tribune on Pertinax' staff.  There was only one couch\nunoccupied.\n\nGalen was an older man than Pertinax, who was already graying at the\ntemples.  Galen had the wrinkled, smiling, shrewd face of an old\nphilosopher who understood the trick of making himself socially\nprominent in order to pursue his calling unimpeded by the bitter\njealousies of rivals.  He understood all about charlatanry, mocked it in\nall its disguises and knew how to defeat it with sarcastic wit.  He wore\nnone of the distinguishing insignia that practising physicians usually\nfavored;  the studied plainness of his attire was a notable contrast to\nthe costly magnificence of Pertinax, whose double-purple-bordered and\nfringed toga, beautifully woven linen and jeweled ornaments seemed\nchosen to combine suggestions of the many public offices he had\nsucceeded to.\n\nHe was a tall, lean, handsome veteran with naturally curly fair hair and\na beard that, had it been dark, would have made him look like an\nAssyrian.  There was a world of humor in his eyes, and an expression on\nhis weathered face of wonder at the ways of men--an almost comical\nconfession of his own inferiority of birth, combined with matter-of-fact\nability to do whatever called for strength, endurance and mere ordinary\ncommon sense.\n\n\"You are almost ashamed of your own good fortune,\" Galen told him.  \"You\nwear all that jewelry, and swagger like the youngest tribune, to conceal\nyour diffidence.  Being honest, you are naturally frugal;  but you are\nashamed of your own honesty, so you imitate the court's extravagance and\nmade up for it with little meannesses that comfort your sense of\nextremes.  The truth is, Pertinax, you are a man with a boy's\nenthusiasms, a boy with a man's experience.\"\n\n\"You ought to know,\" said Pertinax.  \"You tutored Commodus. Whoever\ncould take a murderer at the age of twelve and keep him from breaking\nthe heart of a Marcus Aurelius knows more about men and boys than I do.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I failed,\" said Galen.  \"The young Commodus was like a nibbling\nfish;  you thought you had him, but he always took the bait and left the\nhook.  The wisdom I fed to him fattened his wickedness.  If I had known\nthen what I have learned from teaching Commodus and others, not even\nMarcus Aurelius could have persuaded me to undertake the task--medical\nproblem though it was, and promotion though it was, and answer though it\nwas to all the doctors who denounced me as a charlatan.  I bought my\nfashionable practise at the cost of knowing it was I who taught young\nCommodus the technique of wickedness by revealing to him all its\nsinuosities and how, and why, it floods a man's mind.\"\n\n\"He was a beast in any case,\" said Pertinax.\n\n\"Yes, but a baffled, blind beast.  I removed the bandage from his eyes.\"\n\n\"He would have pulled it off himself.\"\n\n\"I did it.  I turned a mere golden-haired savage into a criminal who\nknows what he is doing.\"\n\n\"Well, drink and forget it!\" said Pertinax.  \"I, too, have done things\nthat are best forgotten.  We attain success by learning from defeat, and\nwe forget defeat in triumph.  I know of no triumph that did not blot out\nscores of worse things than defeat. When I was in Britain I subdued\nrebellion and restored the discipline of mutinying legions.  How?  I am\nnot such a fool as to tell you all that happened!  When I was in Africa\nmen called me a great proconsul.  So I was.  They would welcome me back\nthere, if all I hear about the present man is true.  But do you suppose\nI did not fail in certain instances?  They praise me for the aqueducts I\nbuilt, and for the peace I left along the border. But I also left dry\nbones, and sons of dead men who will teach their grandsons how to hate\nthe name of Rome!  I sent a hundred thousand slaves from Africa.\nSometimes, when I have dined unwisely and there is no Galen near to\nfreshen up my belly juices, I have nightmares, in which men and women\ncry to me for water that I took from them to pour into the cities.  I\nhave learned this, Galen:  Do one thing wisely and you will commit ten\nfollies.  You are lucky if you have but ten failures to detract from one\nsuccess--as lucky as a man who has but ten mistresses to interfere with\nhis enjoyment of his wife!\"\n\nHe spoke of mistresses because the girls were coming down the temple\nsteps to take part in the sunset ceremony.  The torches they carried\nwere unlighted yet;  their figures, draped in linen, looked almost\nsuper-humanly lovely in the deepening twilight, and as they laid their\ngarlands on the marble altar near the temple steps and grouped\nthemselves again on either side of it their movements suggested a\nphantasmagoria fading away into infinite distance, as if all the\nuniverse were filled with women without age or blemish.  There began to\nbe a scent of incense in the air.\n\n\"We only imitate this kind of thing in Rome,\" said Pertinax.  \"A larger\nscale, a coarser effect.  What I find thrilling is the sensation they\ncontrive here of unseen mysteries.  Whereas--\"\n\n\"There won't be any mystery left presently!  They'll strip your last\nveil from imagination!\" Sextus interrupted, laughing.  \"Men say Hadrian\ntried to chasten this place, but he only made them realize the artistic\nvalue of an appearance of chastity, that can be thrown off.  Hark!  The\nevening hymn.\"\n\nThe torches suddenly were lighted by attendant slaves.  The stirring,\nshaken sistra wrought a miracle of sound that set the nerves all\ntingling as the high priest, followed by his boys with swinging censers\nand the members of the priestly college, four by four, came chanting\ndown the temple steps.  To an accompanying pleading, sobbing note of\nflutes the high priest laid an offering of fruit, milk, wine and honey\nin the midst of the heaped-up garlands (for Apollo was the god of all\nfertility as well as of healing and war and flocks and oracles).  Then\ncame the grand Homeric hymn to Glorious Apollo, men's and boys' and\nwomen's voices blending in a surging paean like an ocean's music.\n\nThe last notes died away in distant echoes.  There was silence for a\nhundred breaths;  then music of flute and lyre and sistra as the priests\nretreated up the temple steps followed by fanfare on a dozen trumpets as\nthe door swung to behind the priests. Instantly, then, shouts of\nlaughter--torchlight scattering the shadows amid gloom--green cypresses\n--fire--color splurging on the bosom of the water--babel of hundreds of\nvoices as the gay Antiochenes swarmed out from behind the trees--and a\ncheer, as the girls by the altar threw their garments off and scampered\nnaked along the river-bank toward a bridge that joined the temple island\nto the sloping lawns, where the crowd ran to await them.\n\n\"Apollo having healed the world of sin, we now do what we like!\" said\nSextus.  \"Pertinax, I pledge you continence for this one night!  Good\nGalen, may Apollo's wisdom ooze from you like sweat; for all our sakes,\nbe you the arbiter of what we drink, lest drunkenness deprive us of our\nreason!  Comites, let us eat like warriors--one course, and then\ndiscussion of tomorrow's plan.\"\n\n\"Your military service should have taught you more respect for your\nseniors, as well as how to eat and drink temperately,\" said Pertinax.\n\"Will you teach your grandmother to suck eggs?  I was the first\ngrammarian in Rome before you were born and a tribune before you felt\ndown on your cheek.  I am the governor of Rome, my boy.  Who are you,\nthat you should lecture me?\"\n\n\"If you call that a lecture, concede that I dared,\" Sextus answered.  \"I\ndid not flatter you by coming here, or come to flatter you.  I came\nbecause my father tells me you are a Roman beyond praise.  I am a Roman.\nI believe praise is worthless unless proven to the hilt--as for\ninstance:  I have come to bare my thoughts to you, which is a bold\ncompliment in these days of treachery.\"\n\n\"Keep your thoughts under cover,\" said Pertinax, glancing at the steward\nand the slaves who were beginning to carry in the meal. But he was\nevidently pleased, and Sextus's next words pleased him more:\n\n\"I am ready to do more than think about you, I will follow where you\nlead--except into licentiousness!\"\n\nHe lay on both elbows and stared at the scene with disgust. Naked girls,\nagainst a background of the torchlit water and the green and purple\ngloom of cypresses, was nothing to complain of; statuary, since it could\nnot move, was not as pleasing to the eye;  but shrieks of idiotic\nlaughter and debauchery of beauty sickened him.\n\nThere came a series of sounds at the pavilion entrance, where a litter\nwas set down on marble pavement and a eunuch's shrill voice criticized\nthe slow unrolling of a carpet.\n\n\"What did I warn you?\" Norbanus whispered, laughing in Sextus's ear.\n\nPertinax got to his feet, long-leggedly statuesque, and strode toward\nthe antechamber on his right, whence presently he returned with a woman\non his arm, he stroking her hand as it rested on his.  He introduced\nSextus and Norbanus;  the others knew her; Galen greeted her with a\nwrinkled grin that seemed to imply confidence.\n\n\"Now that Cornificia has come, not even Sextus need worry about our\nbehavior!\" said Galen, and everybody except Sextus grinned. It was\nnotorious that Cornificia refined and restrained Pertinax, whereas his\nlawful wife Flavia Titiana merely drove him to extremes.\n\nThis Roman Aspasia had an almost Grecian face, beneath a coiled\nextravagance of dark brown hair.  Her violet eyes were quietly\nintelligent;  her dress plain white and not elaborately fringed, with\nhardly any jewelry.  She cultivated modesty and all the older graces\nthat had grown unfashionable since the Emperor Marcus Aurelius died.  In\nall ways, in fact, she was the opposite of Flavia Titiana--it was hard\nto tell whether from natural preference or because the contrast to his\nwife's extremes of noisy gaiety and shameless license gave her a\nstronger hold on Pertinax.  Rome's readiest slanderers had nothing\nscandalous to tell of Cornificia, whereas Flavia Titiana's inconstancies\nwere a by-word.\n\nShe refused to let Galen yield the couch on Pertinax's right hand but\ntook the vacant one at the end of the half-moon table, saying she\npreferred it--which was likely true enough;  it gave her a view of all\nthe faces without turning her head or appearing to stare.\n\nFor a long time there was merely desultory conversation while the feast,\nrestricted within moderate proportions by request of Pertinax, was\nbrought on.\n\nThere were eels, for which Daphne was famous;  alphests and callichthys;\npompilos, a purple fish, said to have been born from sea-foam at the\nbirth of Aphrodite;  boops and bedradones; gray mullet;  cuttle-fish;\ntunny-fish and mussels.  Followed in their order pheasants, grouse,\nswan, peacock and a large pig stuffed with larks and mincemeat.  Then\nthere were sweetmeats of various kinds, and a pudding invented in\nPersia, made with honey and dates, with a sauce of frozen cream and\nstrawberries.  By Galen's order only seven sorts of wine were served, so\nwhen the meal was done the guests were neither drunk nor too well fed to\ncarry on a conference.\n\nNo entertainers were provided.  Normally the space between the table and\nthe front of the pavilion would have been occupied by acrobats, dancers\nand jugglers;  but Pertinax dismissed even the impudent women who came\nto lean elbows on the marble railing and sing snatches of suggestive\nsong.  He sent slaves to stand outside and keep the crowd away, his\nlictor and his personal official bodyguard being kept out of sight in a\nsmall stone house near the pavilion kitchen at the rear among the trees,\nin order not to arouse unwelcome comment.  It was known he was in\nDaphne; there was even a subdued expectation in Antioch that his\nunannounced visit portended the extortion of extra tribute.  The Emperor\nCommodus was known to be in his usual straits for money. Given a\nsufficient flow of wine, the sight of bodyguard and lictor might have\nbeen enough to start a riot, the Antiochenes being prone to outbreak\nwhen their passions were aroused by drink and women.\n\nThere was a long silence after Pertinax had dismissed the steward.\nGalen's old personal attendant took charge of the amphora of snow-cooled\nFalernian;  he poured for each in turn and then retired into a corner to\nbe out of earshot, or at any rate to emphasize that what he might hear\nwould not concern him. Pertinax strolled to the front of the pavilion\nand looked out to make sure there were no eavesdroppers, staring for a\nlong time at the revelry that was warming up into an orgy.  They were\ndancing in rings under the moon, their shadowy figures rendered weird by\nsmoky torchlight.  Cornificia at last broke on his reverie:\n\n\"You wish to join them, Pertinax?  That would dignify even our Roman\nHercules--to say nothing of you!\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders, but his eyes were glittering.\n\n\"If Marcia could govern Commodus as you rule me, he would be safer on\nthe throne!\" he answered, coming to sit upright on the couch beside her.\nIt was evident that he intended that speech to release all tongues;  he\nlooked from face to face expectantly, but no one spoke until Cornificia\nurged him to protect himself against the night breeze.  He threw a\npurple-bordered cloak over his shoulders.  It became him;  he looked so\nofficial in it, and majestic, that even Sextus--rebel that he was\nagainst all modern trumpery--forebore to break the silence.  It was\nGalen who spoke next:\n\n\"Pertinax, if you might choose an emperor, whom would you nominate?\nRemember:  He must be a soldier, used to the stench of marching legions.\nNone could govern Rome whose nose goes up in the air at the smell of\nsweat and garlic.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of approval.  Cornificia stroked the long, strong\nfingers of the man she idolized.  Sextus gave rein to his impulse then,\nbrushing aside Norbanus' hand that warned him to bide his time:\n\n\"Many more than I,\" he said, \"are ready to throw in our lot with you,\nPertinax--aye, unto death!  You would restore Rome's honor. I believe my\nfather could persuade a hundred noblemen to take your part, if you would\nlead.  I can answer for five or six men of wealth and influence, not\nreckoning a friend or two who--\"\n\n\"Why talk foolishness!\" said Pertinax.  \"The legions will elect\nCommodus' successor.  They will sell Rome to the highest bidder,\nprobably;  and though they like me as a soldier they dislike my\ndiscipline.  I am the governor of Rome and still alive in spite of it\nbecause even Commodus' informers know it would be silly to accuse me of\nintrigue.  Not even Commodus would listen to such talk.  I lead the gay\nlife, for my own life's sake.  All know me as a roisterer.  I am said to\nhave no ambition other than to live life sensuously.\"\n\nGalen laughed.\n\n\"That may deceive Commodus,\" he said.  \"The thoughtful Romans know you\nas a frugal governor, who stamped out plague and--\"\n\n\"You did that,\" said Pertinax.\n\n\"Who enabled me?\"\n\n\"It was a simple thing to have the tenements burned.  Besides, it\nprofited the city--new streets;  and there was twice the amount of tax\non the new tenements they raised.  I, personally, made a handsome profit\non the purchase of a few burned houses.\"\n\n\"And as the governor who broke the famine,\" Galen continued.\n\n\"That was simple enough, but you may as well thank Cornificia. She found\nout through the women who the men were who were holding corn for\nspeculation.  All I did was to hand their names to Commodus;  he\nconfiscated all the corn and sold it--at a handsome profit to himself,\nsince it had cost him nothing!\"\n\n\"While we sit here and cackle like Asian birds, Commodus renames Rome\nthe City of Commodus and still lives!\" Sextus grumbled.\n\n\"Nor can he be easily got rid of,\" remarked Daedalus the tribune. \"He\ngoes to and fro from the palace through underground tunnels. Men sleep\nin his room who are all involved with him in cruelties and infamy, so\nthey guard him carefully.  Besides, whoever tried to murder him would\nprobably kill Paulus by mistake!  The praetorian guard is contented,\nbeing well paid and permitted all sorts of privileges.  Who can get past\nthe praetorian guard?\"\n\n\"Any one!\" said Pertinax.  \"The point is not, who shall kill Commodus?\nBut who shall be raised in his place?  There are thirty thousand ways to\nkill a man.  Ask Galen!\"\n\nOld Galen laughed at that.\n\n\"As many ways as there are stars in heaven;  but the stars have their\nsay in the matter!  None can kill a man until his destiny says yes to\nit.  Not even a doctor,\" he added, chuckling. \"Otherwise the doctors\nwould have killed me long ago with jealousy!  A man dies when his inner\nman grows sick and weary of him.  Then a pin-prick does it, or a sudden\nterror.  Until that time comes you may break his skull, and do not more\nthan spoil his temper!  As a philosopher I have learned two things:\nrespect many, but trust few.  But as a doctor I have learned only one\nthing for certain:  that no man actually dies until his soul is tired of\nhim.\"\n\n\"Whose soul should grow sick sooner than that of Commodus?\" asked\nSextus.\n\n\"Not if his soul is evil and delights in evil--as his does!\" Galen\nretorted.  \"If he should turn virtuous, then perhaps, yes. But in that\ncase we should wish him to live, although his soul would prefer the\ncontrary and leave him to die by the first form of death that should\nappear--in spite of all the doctors and the guards and tasters of the\nroyal food.\"\n\n\"Some one should convert him then!\" said Sextus.  \"Cornificia, can't\nMarcia make a Christian of him;  Christians pretend to oppose all the\ninfamies he practises.  It would be a merry joke to have a Christian\nemperor, who died because his soul was sick of him!  It would be a\nchoice jest--he being the one who has encouraged Christianity by\nreversing all Marcus Aurelius' wise precautions against their seditious\nblasphemy!\"\n\n\"You speak fanatically, but you have touched the heart of the problem,\"\nsaid Cornificia.  \"It is Marcia who makes life possible for Commodus--\nMarcia and her Christians.  They help Marcia protect him because he is\nthe only emperor who never persecuted them, and because Marcia sees to\nit that they are free to meet together without having even to bribe the\npolice.  There is only one way to get rid of Commodus:  Persuade Marcia\nthat her own life is in danger from him, and that she will have a full\nvoice in nominating his successor.\"\n\n\"Probably true,\" remarked Pertinax.  \"Whom would she nominate? That is\nthe point.\"\n\n\"It would be simpler to kill Marcia,\" said Daedalus.  \"Thereafter let\nthings take their course.  Without Marcia to protect him--\"\n\n\"No man knows much,\" Galen interrupted.  \"Marcia's soul may be all the\nsoul Commodus has!  If she should grow sick of him--!\"\n\n\"She grew sick long ago,\" said Cornificia.  \"But she is forever thinking\nof her Christians and knows no other way to protect them than to make\nCommodus love her.  Ugh!  It is like the story of Andromeda.  Who is to\nact Perseus?\"\n\n(In the fable, Andromeda had to be chained to a cliff to be devoured by\na monster, in order to save her people from the anger of the god\nPoseidon.  Perseus slew the monster.)\n\n\"There are thirty thousand ways of killing,\" Pertinax repeated, \"but if\nwe kill one monster, four or five others will fight for his place,\nunless, like Perseus, we have the head of a Medusa with which to freeze\nthem into stone!  There is no substitute for Commodus in sight.  The\nonly man whose face would freeze all rivals is Severus the\nCarthaginian!\"\n\n\"We are none of us blind,\" said Cornificia.\n\n\"You mean me?  I am too old,\" answered Pertinax.  \"I don't like tyranny,\nand people know it.  It is something they should not know.  An old man\nmay be all very well when he has reigned for twenty years and men are\nused to him, and he used to the task, as was Augustus;  but an old man\nnew to the throne lacks energy. And besides, they would never endure a\nman whose father was a charcoal-seller, as mine was.  I have made my way\nin life by looking at facts and refusing to deceive myself;  with the\nexception of that, I have no especial wisdom, nor any unusual ability.\"\n\n\"If wisdom were all that is needed,\" said Sextus, \"we should put good\nGalen on the throne!\"\n\n\"He is too old and wise to let you try to do it!\"  Galen answered.  \"But\nyou spoke about the head of a Medusa, Pertinax, and mentioned Lucius\nSeptimius Severus.  He commands three legions at Caruntum in Pannonia.\n(Roughly speaking, the S.W. portion of modern Hungary whose frontiers\nwere then occupied by very warlike tribes.)  If there is one man living\nwho can freeze men's blood by scowling at them, it is he!  And he is not\nas old as you are.\"\n\n\"I have thought of him only to hate him,\" said Pertinax.  \"He would not\nfollow me, nor I him.  He is one of three men who would fight for the\nthrone if somebody slew Commodus, although he would not run the risk of\nslaying him himself, and he would betray us if we should take him into\nconfidence.  I know him well.  He is a lawyer and a Carthaginian.  He\nwould never ask for the nomination;  he is too crafty.  He would say his\nlegions nominated him against his will and that to have disobeyed them\nwould have laid him open to the punishment for treason.  (This is what\nSeverus actually did, later on, after Pertinax's death.) The other two\nare Pescennius Niger, who commands the legions in Syria, and Clodius\nAlbinus who commands in Britain.  We must find a man who can forestall\nall three of them by winning, first, the praetorian guard, and then the\nsenate and the Romans by dint of sound reforms and justice.\"\n\n\"You are he!  Rome trusts you.  So does the senate,\" said Cornificia.\n\"Marcia trusts me.  The praetorian guard trusts her. If I can persuade\nMarcia that her life is in danger from Commodus--\"\n\n\"But how?\" Daedalus interrupted.\n\n\"We can take the praetorian guard by surprise,\" Cornificia went on,\nignoring him.  \"They can be tricked into declaring for the man whom\nMarcia's friends nominate.  Having once declared for him they will be\ntoo proud of having made an emperor, and too unwilling to seem\nvacillating, to reverse themselves in any man's favor, even though he\nshould command six legions.  The senate will gladly accept one who has\ngoverned Rome as frugally as Pertinax has done.  If the senate confirms\nthe nominee of the praetorian guard, the Roman populace will do the rest\nby acclamation.  Then, three months of upright government--deification\nby the senate--\"\n\nPertinax laughed explosively--an honest, chesty laugh, unqualified by\nany subtleties, suggesting a trace of the peasantry from which he\nsprang.  It made Cornificia wince.\n\n\"Can you imagine me a god?\" he asked.\n\n\"I can imagine you an emperor,\" said Sextus.  \"It is true;  you have no\nfollowing among the legions just at present.  But I make one, and there\nare plenty of energetic men who think as I do.  My friend Norbanus here\nwill follow me.  My father--\"\n\n\nNoises near the open window interrupted him.  An argument seemed to be\ngoing on between the slaves whom Pertinax had set to keep the roisterers\naway and some one who demanded admission.  Near at hand was a woman's\nvoice, shrilling and scolding.  Then another voice--Scylax, the slave\nwho had ridden the red mare.  Pertinax strode to the window again and\nleaned out.  Cornificia whispered to Galen:\n\n\"If the truth were known, he is afraid of Flavia Titiana.  As a wife she\nis bad enough, but as an empress--\"\n\nGalen nodded.\n\n\"If you love your Pertinax,\" he answered, \"keep him off the throne!  He\nhas too many scruples.\"\n\nShe frowned, having few, which were firm and entirely devoted to\nPertinax' fortune.\n\n\"Love him?  I would give him up to see him deified!\" she whispered;  and\nagain Galen nodded, deeply understanding.\n\n\"That is because you have never had children,\" he assured her, smiling.\n\"You mother Pertinax, who is more than twice your age--just as Marcia\nhas mothered that monster Commodus until her heart is breaking.\"\n\n\"But I thought you were Pertinax' friend?\"\n\n\"So I am.\"\n\n\"And his urgent adviser to--\"\n\n\"Yes, so I was.  I have changed my opinion;  only the maniacs never do\nthat.  Pertinax would make a splendid minister for Lucius Severus;  and\nthe two of them could bring back the Augustan days.  Persuade him to it.\nHe must forget he hates him.\"\n\n\"Let him come!\" said the voice of Pertinax.  He was still leaning out,\nwith one hand on a marble pillar, much more interested in the moonlit\nview of revelry than in the altercation between slaves.  He strolled\nback and stood smiling at Cornificia, his handsome face expressing\nsatisfaction but a rather humorous amusement at his inability to\nunderstand her altogether.\n\n\"Are you like all other women?\" he asked.  \"I just saw a naked woman\nstab a man with her hairpin and kick his corpse into the shrubbery\nbefore the breath was out of it!\"\n\n\"Galen has deserted you,\" said Cornificia.  The murder was\nuninteresting;  nobody made any comment.\n\n\"Not he!\" Pertinax answered, and went and sat on Galen's couch. \"You\nfind me not man enough for the senate to make a god of me--is that it,\nGalen?\"\n\n\"Too much of a man to be an emperor,\" said Galen, smiling amid wrinkles.\n\"By observing a man's virtues one may infer what his faults are.  You\nwould try to rule the empire honestly, which is impossible.  A more\ndishonest man would let it rule itself and claim the credit, whereas you\nwould give the praise to others, who would shoulder off the work and all\nthe blame on to you.  An empire is like a human body, which heals itself\nif the head will let it.  Too many heads--a conference of doctors--and\nthe patient dies!  One doctor, doing nothing with an air of confidence,\nand the patient gets well!  There, I have told you more than all the\nsenate knows!\"\n\n\nCame Scylax, out of breath, less menial than most men's slaves, his head\nand shoulders upright and the hand that held a letter thrust well\nforward as if what he had to do were more important than the way he did\nit.\n\n\"This came,\" he said, standing beside Sextus' couch.  \"Cadmus brought\nit, running all the way from Antioch.\"\n\nHis hand was trembling;  evidently Cadmus had by some means learned the\ncontents of the letter and had told.\n\n\"I and Cadmus--\" he said, and then hesitated.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"--are faithful, no matter what happens.\"\n\nScylax stood erect with closed lips.  Sextus broke the seal, merely\nglancing at Pertinax, taking permission for granted.  He frowned as he\nread, bit his lip, his face growing crimson and white alternately.  When\nhe had mastered himself he handed the letter to Pertinax.\n\n\"I always supposed you protected my father,\" he said, struggling to\nappear calm.  But his eyes gave the story away--grieved, mortified,\nindignant.  Scylax offered him his arm to lean on. Norbanus, setting\nboth hands on his shoulders from behind, obliged him to sit down.\n\n\"Calm!\" Norbanus whispered, \"Calm!  Your friends are your friends.  What\nhas happened?\"\n\nPertinax read the letter and passed it to Cornificia, then paced the\nfloor with hands behind him.\n\n\"Is that fellow to be trusted?\" he asked with a jerk of his head toward\nScylax.  He seemed nearly as upset as Sextus was.\n\nSextus nodded, not trusting himself to speak, knowing that if he did he\nwould insult a man who might be guiltless in spite of appearances.\n\n\"Commodus commanded me to visit Antioch, as he said, for a rest,\" said\nPertinax.  \"The public excuse was, that I should look into the\npossibility of holding the Olympic games here.  Strangely enough, I\nsuspected nothing.  He has been flatteringly friendly of late.  Those\nwhom I requested him to spare, he spared, even though their names were\non his proscription list and I had not better excuse than that they had\ndone no wrong!  The day before I left I brought a list to him of names\nthat I commended to his favor--your father's name among them, Sextus.\"\n\nPertinax turned his back again and strode toward the window, where he\nstood like a statue framed in the luminous gloom.  The only part of him\nthat moved was his long fingers, weaving together behind him until the\nknuckles cracked.\n\nCornificia, subduing her contralto voice, read the letter aloud:\n\n\n\"To Nimius Secundus Sextus, son of Galienus Maximus, the freedman Rufus\nGlabrio sends humble greeting.\n\n\"May the gods give solace and preserve you.  Notwithstanding all your\nnoble father's piety--his respect for elders and superiors--he was\naccused of treason and of blasphemy toward the emperor, by whose orders\nhe was seized yesterday and beheaded the same day. The estates have\nalready been seized.  It is said they will be sold to Asinus Sejanus,\nwho is probably the source of the accusation against your father.\n\n\"I and three other freedmen made our escape and will attempt to reach\nTarentum, where we will await instructions from you. Titus, the son of\nthe freedman Paulinus, will convey this letter to Brundisium and thence\nby boat to Dyrrachium, whence he will send it by post in the charge of a\nJew whom he says he can trust.\n\n\"It is a certainty that orders will go forth to seize yourself, since\nthe estates in Antioch are known to be of great value. Therefore, we\nyour true friends and devoted servants, urge you to make all speed in\nescaping.  Stay not to make provision for yourself, but travel without\nencumbrances.  Hide!  Hasten!\n\n\"We commend this letter to you as a sure proof that we ourselves are to\nbe trusted, since, if it should fall into the hands of an informer by\nthe way, our lives undoubtedly would pay the forfeit. We have not much\nmoney, but enough for the expenses of a journey to a foreign land.  The\nplace where we will hide near Tarentum is known to you.  In deep\nanxiety, and not without such sacrifices to the gods and to the manes of\nyour noble ancestors as means permit, we will await your coming.\"\n--RUFUS GLABRIO \"Freedman of the illustrious Galienus Maximus.\"\n\nPertinax turned from the window.  \"The Jews have a saying,\" he said,\n\"that who keepeth his mouth and his tongue, keepeth his soul from\ntrouble.  Often I warned Maximus that he was too free with his speech.\nHe counted too much on my protection.  Now it remains to be seen whether\nCommodus has not proscribed me!\"\n\nSextus and Norbanus stood together, Scylax behind them, Norbanus\nwhispering;  plainly enough Norbanus was urging patience--discretion--\ndeliberate thought, whereas Sextus could hardly think at all for anger\nthat reddened his eyes.\n\n\"What can I do for you?  What can I do?\" wondered Pertinax.\n\nThen Cornificia was on her feet.\n\n\"There is nothing--nothing you can do!\" she insisted.  She avoided\nGalen's eyes;  the old philosopher was watching her as if she were the\nsubject of some new experiment.  \"Let Commodus learn as much as that\nSextus was here in this pavilion and--\"\n\nSextus interrupted, very proudly:\n\n\"I will not endanger my friends.  Who will lend me a dagger? This toy\nthat I wear is too short and not sharp.  You may forget me, Pertinax.\nMy slaves will bury me.  But play you the man and save Rome!\"\n\nThen the tribune spoke up.  He was younger than all of them.\n\n\"Sextus is right.  They will know he was here.  They will probably\ntorture his slaves and learn about that letter that has reached him.  If\nhe runs and hides, we shall all be accused of having helped him to\nescape;  whereas--\"\n\n\"What?\"  Galen asked him as he hesitated.\n\n\"If he dies by his own hand, he will not only save all his slaves from\nthe torture but remove the suspicion from us and we will still be free\nto mature our--\"\n\n\"Cowardice!\"  Norbanus finished the sentence for him.\n\n\"Aye, some of us would hardly feel like noble Romans!\" Pertinax said\ngrimly.  \"Possibly I can protect you, Sextus.  Let us think of some\ngreat favor you can do the emperor, providing an excuse for me to\ninterfere.  I might even take you to Rome with me and--\"\n\nGalen laughed, and Cornificia drew in her breath, bit her lip.\n\n\"Why do you laugh, Galen?\" Pertinax strode over to him and stood\nstaring.\n\n\"Because,\" said Galen, \"I know so little after all.  I cannot tell a\nbeast's blood from a man's.  Our Commodus would kill you with all the\nmore peculiar enjoyment because he has flattered you so often publicly\nand called you 'father Pertinax.'  He poisoned his own father;  why not\nyou?  They will tell him you have frequently befriended Sextus.  They\nwill show him Sextus' father's name on that list of names that you\ncommended to his favor.  Do you follow me?\"\n\n\"By Jupiter, not I!\" said Pertinax.\n\n\"He is sure to learn about this letter that has come.\" said Galen.  \"If\nyou, in fearful loyalty to Commodus, should instantly attempt to make a\nprisoner of Sextus;  if, escaping, he is killed, and you bear witness--\nthat would please Commodus almost as much as to see gladiators killed in\nthe arena.  If you wept over the death of Sextus, that would please him\neven more.  He would enjoy your feelings.  Do you remember how he picked\ntwo gladiators who were brothers twins they were--and when the slayer of\nhis twin-brother saluted, Commodus got down into the arena and kissed\nhim?  You yourself must announce to him the news of Sextus' death, and\nhe will kiss you also!\"\n\n\"Vale!\" remarked Sextus.  \"I die willingly enough.\"\n\n\"You are dead already,\" Galen answered.  \"Didn't Pertinax see some one's\nbody kicked into the bushes?\"\n\nThere was silence.  They all glanced at one another.  Only Galen,\nsipping at his wine, seemed philosophically calm.\n\n\"I personally should not be an eye-witness,\" Galen remarked.  \"I am a\ndoctor, whose certificate of death not even Commodus would doubt.  In\nthe dark I might recognize Sextus' garments, even though I could not see\nhis features.  And--\" he added pointedly--\"neither I nor any one can\ntell a beast's blood from a man's.\"\n\n\"Daedalus!\" said Pertinax with sudden resolution.  \"Get my purse. My\nslave has it.  Sextus shall not go empty-handed.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII.  MATERNUS-LATRO\n\n\n\nSorbanus brought the skewbald stallion.  Not far away a group of women\ndanced around a dozen drunken men, who sang uproariously. Seen against\nthe background of purple and dark-green gloom, with crimson torchlight\nflaring on the quiet water and the moon descending behind trees beyond\nthem, they were mystically beautiful--seemed not to belong to earth, any\nmore than the pan-pipe music did.\n\n\"Ride into their midst!\" Norbanus urged, pointing.  \"Tickle the stallion\nthus.\"\n\nThe Cappadocian lashed out savagely.\n\n\"Here is a bottle of goat's blood.  I will bring weapons, and I will\njoin you as soon as possible after I have made sure that the temple\npriests, and all Daphne, are positive about your death. Now mount and\nride!\"\n\nSextus swung on to the stallion's back as if a catapult had thrown him.\nUntil then he had let others do the ordering;  he had preferred to let\nthem take their own precautions, form their own plans and subject\nhimself to any course they wished, after which he should be free to face\nhis destiny and fight it without feeling he had handicapped his friends\nby wilfulness.  He had not even issued a direct command to Scylax, his\nown slave.  That was characteristic of him.  Nor was it at his\nsuggestion that Norbanus volunteered to share his outlawry.  But it was\nalso characteristic that he made no gesture of dissent;  he accepted\nNorbanus' loyalty with a quiet smile that rather scorned words as\nunnecessary.\n\nNow he drove his heels into the Cappadocian with vigor, for the die was\ncast.  The stallion, impatient of new mastery, reared and plunged,\nsnorted, came back on the bit in an attempt to get it in his teeth, and\nbolted straight for the group of roisterers, who scattered away, men\nswearing, women screaming.  Throwing back his weight against the reins,\nhe brought the stallion to a plunging, snorting, wheeling halt in the\nmidst of men and women--a terrifying monster blowing clouds of mist out\nof his nostrils! As they ran he let the brute rear--pulled him over--\nrolled from under him, and lay still, with goat's blood from the broken\nbottle splashed around his face and seeming to flow from his mouth.  One\nwoman stooped to look, groped for a purse or anything of value, screamed\nand ran.\n\n\"Sextus!\" she yelled.  \"Sextus who was dining in the white pavilion!\"\n\nSextus crawled among the oleanders.  Presently Norbanus came, hurrying\nout of gloom, accompanied by Cadmus, the slave who had brought from\nAntioch the letter that came from Rome.  They were dragging a body\nbetween them.  They laid it down exactly where Sextus had fallen from\nthe horse.  There was a sickening thwack as Cadmus made the face\nunrecognizable.  Then came the lanky, hurrying figure of Pertinax\nleading a group of people, Cornificia among them--Galen last.\n\nSextus lay still until all their backs were toward him.  Then he crept\nout of the oleanders and walked along the river-bank in no haste,\nmasking his face with a fold of his toga.  He chose a path that wound\namid the shrubbery, where marble satyrs grinned in colored lantern\nlight.  He had to avoid couples here and there. A woman followed him,\nlaying a hand on his arm;  he struck her, and she ran off, screaming for\nher bully.\n\nPresently he reached the winding track that led toward the high-road,\nwith the gloom of cypresses on either hand and, beyond that, the glow of\nthe lights in the caterers' booths.  He was as safe now as if he were\nfifty miles away;  none noticed him except the beggars at the bridges,\nwho exposed maimed limbs and whined for charity.  A leper, banking on\nhis only stock in trade--the dread men had of his affliction--cursed\nhim.\n\n\"You waste breath,\" said Sextus and passed on.  He was smiling to\nhimself--sardonically.  \"Lepers live by threats--\" he thought.\n\nNo more than any leper now could he expect protection from society\nbeyond what he could force society to yield.  He had no name, for he was\ndead;  that thought amused him.  Suddenly it dawned on him how safe he\nwas, since none in Antioch would dare to question the word of Pertinax,\nbacked by Galen and all the witnesses whom Pertinax would be sure to\nsummon.  He remembered then to protect the honest freedmen who had sent\nhim warning--strode to a fire near a caterer's booth and burned the\nletter, stared at by the slaves who warmed their shins around the\nembers.\n\nOne of those might have recognized him, in spite of the toga drawn over\nhis face.\n\n\"If any one should ask which way Maternus went, say I have gone home,\"\nhe commanded, and strode away into the gloom.\n\nHe wondered why he had chosen the name Maternus.  Not even his remotest\nancestor had borne it, yet it came to his lips as naturally, instantly,\nas if it were his own by right.  But as he walked away it came to mind\nthat ten, or possibly twelve, nights ago he and his friends had all been\ntalking of a highwayman Maternus, who had robbed the caravans on the\nmountain road from Tarsus.  For the moment that thought scared him.\nShould he change the name?  The slaves by the embers had stared;  they\nshowed him respect, but there was a distinct sensation mingled with it--\nhardly to be wondered at!  Where was it he heard--who told him--that\nMaternus had been caught?  He could not remember.\n\nIt dawned on him how difficult it is to decide what to do when the old\nfamiliar conditions and the expectations on which we habitually base\ndecisions are all suddenly stripped away.  He understood now how a\ngeneral in the field can fail when suddenly confronted with the unknown.\nShall he do this, or do that? There was not a habit or a circumstance to\nguide him.  He must choose, the while the gods looked on and laughed!\n\nMaternus.  It was a strange name to adopt, and yet he liked the sound of\nit, nor would it pass out of his mind.  He tried to think of other\nnames, but either they had all been borne by slaves, and were\ndistasteful, or else by famous men or by his friends, whom he did not\npropose to wrong;  he only had to imagine his case reversed to realize\nhow bitterly he would resent it if an outlawed man should take his own\nname and make it notorious.\n\nYet he perceived that notoriety would be his only refuge, paradox though\nthat might be.  As a mere fugitive, anonymous and having no more object\nthan to live and avoid recognition, he would soon reach the end of his\ntether;  there was little mercy in the world for men without a home or\nmeans.  Whether recognized or not, he would become like a hunted animal\n--might, in fact, end as a slave unless he should prefer to prove his\nidentity and submit to Commodus's executioners.  Suicide would be\npreferable to that; but it seemed almost as if the gods themselves had\nvetoed self-destruction by providing that roisterer's corpse at the\ncritical moment and putting the plan for its use into Galen's wise old\nhead.\n\nHe must take the field like Spartacus of old;  but he must have a goal\nmore definite and more attainable than Spartacus had had. He must avoid\nthe mistake that weakened Spartacus, of accepting for the sake of\nnumbers any ally who might offer himself.  He would have nothing\nwhatever to do with the rabble of runaway slaves, whose only guiding\nimpulse would be loot and license, although he knew how easy it would be\nto raise such an army if he should choose to do it.  Out of any hundred\noutlaws in the records of a hundred years, some ninety-nine had come to\ngrief through the increasing numbers of their following and lack of\ndiscipline;  he could think of a dozen who had been betrayed by paid\ninformers of the government, posing as friendly brigands.\n\nAnd besides, he had no intention of adopting brigandry as a profession,\nthough he realized that he must make a reputation as a brigand if he\nhoped to be anything else than a helpless fugitive.  As a rebel against\nCommodus it might be possible to raise a good-sized army in a month or\ntwo, but that would only serve to bring the Roman armies out of camp,\nled by generals eager for cheap victories.  He must be too resourceful\nto be taken by police--too insignificant to tempt the legions out of\ncamp.  Brigandry was as distasteful to him and as far beneath his\ndignity as the pursuit of brigands was beneath the dignity of any of\nthose Roman generals who owed their rank to Commodus.  For them, as for\nhimself, the pettiness of brigandry led nowhither. Only one object\nappealed to them--fame and its perquisites.  Only one object appealed to\nhimself:  to redeem his estates and to avenge his father.  That could be\naccomplished only by the death of Commodus:  He laughed, as he thought\nof himself pitted alone against Commodus the deified, mad monster who\ncould marshal the resources of the Roman empire!\n\nSuch thoughts filled his mind until he reached the lonely cross-road,\nwhere the narrower, tree-lined road to Daphne met the great main highway\nleading northward over the mountains.  There was the usual row of\ngibbets reared on rising ground against the sky by way of grim reminder\nto slaves and other would-be outlaws that the arm of Rome was long, not\nmerciful.  Five of the gibbets were vacant, except for an arm on one of\nthem, that swayed in the wind as it hung by a cord from the wrist.  The\nsixth had a man on it--dead.\n\n\nScylax, who was waiting for him, rode out of the gloom on the mare,\nleading the Cappadocian, and reined in near the gibbet, not quite sure\nyet who it was who strode toward him.  Scared by the stench, the horses\nbecame difficult to manage.  The leading-rein passed around one of the\ngibbets.  Sextus ran forward to help. The Cappadocian broke the rein and\nScylax galloped after him.\n\nSo Sextus stood alone beside the rough-hewn tree-trunk, to which was\ntied the body of a man who had been dead, perhaps, since sunset.  He had\nnot been torn yet by the vultures.  Morbid curiosity--a fellow feeling\nfor a victim, as the man might well be, of the same injustice that had\nmade an outlaw of himself--impelled Sextus to step closer.  He could not\nsee the face, which was drooped forward;  but there was a parchment,\nheld spread on a stick, like a sail on a spar, suspended from the man's\nneck by a string.  He snatched it off and held it toward the moon, now\nlow on the horizon.  There were only two words, smeared with red paint\nby a forefinger, underneath the official letters S.P.Q.R.:\n\n\"Maternus-Latro.\"\n\nHe began to wonder who Maternus might have been, and how he took the\nfirst step that had led to crucifixion.  It was hard to believe that any\nman would run that risk unless impelled to it by some injustice that had\nchanged pride into savagery or else shot off all opportunity for decent\nliving.  The cruelty of the form of execution hardly troubled him;  the\npossible injustice of it stirred him to his depths.  He felt a sort of\nsuperstitious reverence for the victim, increased by the strange\ncoincidence that he had made use, without previous reflection, of\nMaternus' name.\n\nPresently he saw Norbanus riding the horse that he himself had ridden\nthat afternoon from Antioch to Daphne, followed on a mule by Cadmus, the\nslave who had brought the letter which had pulled the trigger that set\nthe catapults of destiny in motion.  Making a wide circuit, they helped\nScylax catch the Cappadocian.\n\nNorbanus came cantering back.  He was dressed for the road in a brown\nwoolen tunic contributed by some one in Pertinax' suite. He shook a bag\nof money.\n\n\"Cornificia was generous,\" he said. \"Old Pertinax thought he had done\nwell enough by you.  She cried shame on him and threatened to send for\nher jewelry.  So he borrowed money from the priests. You are as dead as\nthat.\"  He looked up at the tortured body of the robber.  \"What name\nwill you take?  We had better begin to get used to it.\"\n\n\"It is written here,\" said Sextus, showing him the parchment. But the\nmoon had gone down in a smother of silvery cloud; Norbanus could not see\nto read.  \"I am Maternus-Latro.\"\n\n\"I was told they had crucified that fellow.\"\n\n\"This is Maternus.  Being dead, he will hardly grudge me the use of his\nname!  However, I will pay him for it.  He shall have fair burial.  Help\nme down with him.\"\n\nNorbanus beckoned to the slaves, who tied the horses to a near-by tree.\nThey sought in the dark for a hole that would do for a grave, since they\nhad no burying tools, stumbling on a limestone slab at last, that lay\namid rank weeds near a tomb hollowed out of the rock that had been\nrifled, very likely, centuries ago. They lowered the already stiffened\nbody into it, with a coin in its fingers for Charon's ferry-fare across\nthe Styx, then set the heavy slab in place, all four of them using their\nutmost strength.\n\nThen Sextus, having poured a little water from his hollowed hands on to\nthe slab, because he had no oil, and having murmured fragments of a\nritual as old as Rome, bidding the gods of earth and air and the unseen\nre-absorb into themselves what man no longer could perceive or cherish\nor destroy, turned to the two slaves.\n\n\"Scylax,\" he said, \"Cadmus--he who was your master is as dead as that\nman we have buried.  I am not Sextus, son of Maximus.  I fare forth like\na dead man on an unknown road, now being without honor on the lips of\nmen.  Nor have I any claim on you, being now an outlaw, whom the law\nwould crucify if ill-luck should betray my feet.  Nor can I set you\nfree, since all my household doubtless is already confiscated;  ye\nbelong by law to whomsoever Commodus may have appointed to receive my\ngoods.  Do then at your own risk, of your own will, what seems good to\nyou.\"\n\nBeing slaves, they knelt.  He bade them rise.\n\n\"We follow you,\" said Scylax, Cadmus murmuring assent.\n\n\"Then the night bear witness!\" Sextus turned toward the row of gibbets,\npointing at them.  \"That is the risk we take together. If we escape\nthat, you shall not go unrewarded from the fortune I redeem.  Norbanus,\nyou accept my leadership?\"\n\nNorbanus chuckled.\n\n\"I insist on it!\" he answered.  He, too, pointed at the row of gibbets.\n\"To be frightened will provide us with no armor against destiny!  There\nwas little I had to lose;  lo, I have left that for the mice to nibble!\nLet us see what destiny can do to bold men!  Lead on, Sextus!\"\n\n\n\n\nIV.  THE GOVERNORS OF ROME AND ANTIOCH\n\n\n\nDawn was sparkling on the mountain peaks;  the misty violet of half-\nlight crept into the passes and the sun already bathed the copper roofs\nof Antioch in gleaming gold above a miracle of greenery and marble.\nLike a sluggish, muddy stream with camel's heads afloat in it, the\nsouth-bound caravan poured up against the city gate and spread itself to\nawait inspection by the tax-gatherers, the governor's representatives\nand the police.  There was a tedious procedure of examination, hindered\nby the swarms of gossipers, the merchants' agents, smugglers, and the\nmen to whom the latest news meant livelihood, who streamed out of the\ncity gate and mingled with the new-comers from Asia, Bythinia, Pontus,\nPisidia, Galatia and Cappadocia.\n\nThe caravan guards piled their spears and breakfasted apart, their duty\ndone.  They had the air of men to whom the constantly repeated marches\nto and fro on the selfsame stage of a mountainous road had grown\ndispleasing and devoid of all romance. Two were wounded.  One, with a\ndent in the helmet that hung from his arm by the chin-strap, lay leaning\nagainst a rock;  refused food, and slowly bled to death, his white face\nalmost comically disappointed.\n\nA military tribune, followed by a slave with tablets, and by a mounted\ntrooper for the sake of his official dignity, rode out from the city and\ntook the report from the guards' decurion, a half-breed Dacian-Italian,\nblack-bearded and taciturn, who dictated it to the slave in curt,\nstaccato sentences, grudging the very gesture that he made toward the\nwounded men.  The tribune glanced at the report, signed it, turned his\nhorse and rode into the city, disregarding the decurion's salute, his\nmilitary cloak a splash of very bright red, seen against the limestone\nand above the predominant brown of the camels and coats of their owners.\nHe cantered his horse when he passed through the gate, and there went up\na clamor of newsy excitement behind him as group after group loosed\ntongues in competition of exaggeration.\n\nBeing bad, the news spread swiftly.  The quadruple lines of columns all\nalong the Corso, as the four-mile-long main thoroughfare was called,\nbegan to look like pier-piles in a flowing tide of men.  Yellow, blue,\nred, striped and parti-colored costumes, restless as the flotsam on a\nmill-race, swirled into patterns, and broke, and reblended.  The long\nportico of Caesar's baths resounded to the hollow hum of voices.\nStreaming lines of slaves in the midst of the street were delayed by the\ncrowd, and abused for obstructing it.  Gossip went up like the voice of\nthe sea to the cliffs and startled clouds of spray-white pigeons,\nfaintly edged with pink against an azure sky;  then ceased as suddenly.\nThe news was known.   Whatever Antioch knew, bored it.  Nine days'\nwonders were departed long ago into the limbo of the days of Xerxes.\nNine hours had come to be the limit of men's interest--nine minutes the\ncrucial phase of excitement, during which the balance of emotion hovered\nbetween rioting or laughter.\n\nAntioch grew quiet, conscious of the sunny weather and the springtime\nlassitude that is a luxury to masters but that slaves must overcome.\nThe gangs went forth to clear the watercourses in advance of floods,\nwhips cracking to inspire zeal.  Wagon-loads of flowers, lowing milk-\nwhite oxen, white goats--even a white horse, a white ass--oil and wine\nin painted carts, whose solid wooden wheels screamed on their axles like\ndemons in agony-threaded the streets to the temples, lest the gods\nforget convenience and send the floods too soon.\n\nThe Forum--gilt-edged marble, tinted statuary, a mosaic pavement like a\nrich-hued carpet from the looms of Babylon--began to overflow with\nleisured men of business.  Their slaves did all the worrying.  The\nmoney-changers' clerks sat by the bags of coin, with scales and shovel\nand the tables of exchange.  The chaffering began in corn-shops, where\nthe lawless agreements for delivery of unsown harvests changed hands ten\ntimes in the hour, and bills on Rome, scrawled over with endorsements,\noutsped currency as well as outwitted the revenue men.  No tax-farmer's\nslave could keep track of the flow of intangible wealth when the bills\nfor a million sesterces passed to and fro like cards in an Egyptian\ngame.  Men richer than the fabled Croesus carried all their wealth in\nleather wallets in the form of mortgages on gangs of slaves,\ncertificates of ownership of cargoes, promises to pay and contracts for\ndelivery of merchandise.\n\nNine-tenths of all the clamor was the voice of slaves, each one of them\nan expert in his master's business and often richer than the owners of\nthe men he dealt with, saving his peculium--the personal savings which\nslaves were sometimes encouraged to accumulate--to buy his freedom when\na more than usually profitable deal should put his master in a good\nmood.\n\nThe hall of the basilica was almost as much a place of fashion as the\nbaths of Julius Caesar, except that there were some admitted into the\nbasilica whose presence, later in the day, within the precincts of the\nbaths would have led to a riot.  Whoever had wealth and could afford to\nmatch wits with the sharpest traders in the world might enter the\nbasilica and lounge amid the statuary.  Thither well dressed slaves came\nhurrying with contracts and the news of changing prices.  There, on\nmarble benches, spread with colored cushions, at the rear under the\nbalcony, the richer men of business sat chattering to mask their real\nthoughts--Jews, Alexandrians, Athenians--a Roman here and there,\ncupidity more frankly written on his face, his eyes a little harder and\nless subtle, more abrupt in gesture and less patient with delays.\n\n\n\"That is a tale which is all very well for the slaves to believe, and\nfor the priests, if they wish, to repeat.  As for me, I was born in\nTarsus, where no man in his senses believes anything except a bill of\nsale.\"\n\n\"But I tell you, Maternus was scourged, and then crucified at the place\nof execution nearest to where he committed his last crime. That is,\nwhere the crossroad leads to Daphne.  There is no doubt about that\nwhatever.  He was nearly four days dying, and the sentries stood guard\nover him until he ceased to breathe, a little after sunset yesterday\nevening.  So they say, at all events.  A little before midnight, in\nDaphne, near one of those booths where the caterers prepare hot meals, a\nman strode up to where some slaves were seated around a fire.  He burned\na piece of parchment.  All nine slaves agree that he was about Maternus'\nheight and build;  that he strode like a man who had been hurt; that he\nhad mud and grass stains on his knees, and covered his face with a toga.\nThey also swear he said he was Maternus, and that he was gone before\nthey could recover their wits.  They say his voice was sepulchral.  One\nof the slaves, who can read, declares that the words on the parchment he\nburned were \"Maternus Latro,\" and that it was the identical parchment he\nhad seen hanging from Maternus' neck on the cross.  They tortured that\nslave at once, of course, to get the truth out of him, and on the rack\nhe contradicted himself at least a dozen times, so they whipped him and\nlet him go, because his owner said he was a valuable cook;  but the fact\nremains that the story hasn't been disproved.\n\n\"And there is absolutely no doubt whatever about this:  The caravan from\nAsia came in just a little after dawn, having traveled the last stage by\nnight, as usual, in order to arrive early and get the formalities over\nwith.  They came past the place of execution before sunrise.  They had\nheard the news of the execution from the north-bound caravan that passed\nthem in the mountains.  They had all been afraid of Maternus because he\nhad robbed so many wayfarers, so naturally they were interested to see\nhis dead body.  It was gone!\"\n\n\"What of it?  Probably the women took it down for burial. Robbers always\nhave a troupe of women.  Maternus never had to steal one, so they say.\nThey flocked to him like Bacchanalians.\"\n\n\"No matter.  Now listen to this:  between the time when they learned of\nMaternus' execution and their passing the place of execution that is to\nsay at the narrowest part of the pass, where it curves and begins to\ndescend on this side of the mountain--they were attacked by robbers who\nmade use of Maternus' war-cry. The robbers were beaten off, although\nthey wounded two men of the guard and got away with half-a-dozen horses\nand a slave-girl.\"\n\n\"That means nothing--Pardon me a moment while I see what my man has been\ndoing.  What is it, Stilchio?  Are you mad?  You have contracted to\ndeliver fifty bales at yesterday's price?  You want to ruin me?  Oh.\nYou are quite sure?  Very well:  A good man, that--went out and met the\ncaravan--bought low--sold high, and the price is falling.  But as I was\nsaying, your story is simply a string of coincidences.  All the robbers\nuse Maternus' war-cry, because of the terror his name inspires;  they\nprobably had not heard he had been crucified.\"\n\n\"Well, that was what the caravan folk thought, until they passed the\nplace of execution and saw no body there.\"\n\n\"The robbers possibly themselves removed it and were seeking to avenge\nMaternus.\"\n\n\"Much more likely somebody was bribed to let him escape!  We all know\nMaternus was scourged, for that was done in Antioch;  but they did not\nscourge him very badly, for fear he might die on the way to the place of\nexecution.  There is no doubt he was crucified, but he was only tied,\nnot nailed.  It would have been perfectly simple to substitute some\nother criminal that first night--somebody who looked a little like him;\nthey would give the substitute poppy juice to keep him from crying out\nto passers-by.\"\n\n\"Substitution has often been done, of course.  But it takes a lot of\nmoney and considerable influence to bribe the guard.  They are under the\nauthority of a centurion, who would have to look out for informers.  And\nbesides, you can't persuade me that a man who had been scourged, and\ncrucified, if only for one day, could walk into Daphne two or three\nnights afterward and carry on a conversation.  Why should he visit\nDaphne?  Why should he choose that place, of all places in the world,\nand midnight, to destroy the identification parchment?  Having destroyed\nit, why did he then tell the slaves who he was?  It sounds like a tale\nout of Egypt to me.\"\n\n\"Well, the priests are saying--\"\n\n\"Tchutt-tchutt!  Priests say anything.\"   \"Nevertheless, the priests are\nsaying that Maternus, after he was captured, managed to convey a message\nto his followers commanding them to offer sacrifices to Apollo, who\naccordingly intervened in his behalf. And they say he undoubtedly went\nto Daphne to return thanks at the temple threshold.\"\n\n\"Hah-Hah!  Excellent!  Let us go to the baths.  You need to sweat the\nsuperstition out of you!  Better leave word where we are going, so that\nour factors will know where to find us in case any important business\nturns up.\"\n\n\nIn the palace, in the office of the governor, where the lapping of water\nand irises could be heard through the opened windows, Pertinax sat\nfacing the governor of Antioch across a table heaped with parchment\nrolls.  A dozen secretaries labored in the next room, but the door\nbetween was closed;  the only witnesses were leisurely, majestic swans,\nseen down a vista of well pruned shrubbery that flanked the narrow lawn.\nAn awning crimsoned and subdued the sunlight, concealing the lines on\nthe governor's face and suggesting color on his pale cheeks.\n\nHe was a fat man, pouched under the eyes and growing bald--an almost\ntotal contrast to the lean and active, although older Pertinax.  His\nsmile was cynical.  His mouth curved downward.  He had large, fat hands\nand cold, dark calculating eyes.\n\n\"I would feel more satisfied,\" he said, \"if I could have Norbanus'\nevidence.\"\n\n\"Find him then!\" Pertinax answered irritably.  \"What is the matter with\nyour police?  In Rome, if I propose to find a man he is brought before\nme instantly.\"\n\n\"This is not Rome,\" said the governor, \"as you would very soon discover\nif you occupied my office.  I sent a lictor and a dozen men to Norbanus'\nhouse, but he is missing and has not been seen, although it is known,\nand you admit, that he dined with you last night at Daphne.  He has no\nproperty worth mentioning.  His house is under lien to money-lenders.\nHe is well known to have been Sextus' friend, and the moment this order\narrived proscribing Sextus I added to it the name of Norbanus in my own\nhandwriting, on the principle that treason keeps bad company.\n\n\"My own well known allegiance to the emperor obliges me to tear out the\nvery roots of treason at the first suggestion of its presence in our\nmidst.  I have long suspected Sextus, who was a cross-grained,\nobstinate, quick-witted, proud young man--a lot too critical.  I am\nconvinced now that he and Norbanus were hatching some kind of plot\nbetween them--possibly against the sacred person of our emperor--a\nfrightful sacrilege!--the suggestion of it makes me shudder!  There is,\nof course, no doubt about Sextus;  the emperor's own proscription brands\nhim as a miscreant unfit to live, and he was lucky to have died by\naccident instead of being torn apart by tongs.  It seems to me\nunquestionable that Norbanus shared his guilt and took care to escape\nbefore he could be seized and brought to justice.  What is in doubt,\nmost noble Pertinax, is how you can excuse yourself to our sacred\nemperor for having let Sextus escape from your clutches, after you had\nseen that letter!  How can you excuse yourself for not pouncing the\nletter, to be used as evidence against rascally freedmen who forewarned\nthe miscreant Sextus about the emperor's intentions?--and for not\nrealizing that Norbanus was undoubtedly in league with him?  How can you\nexplain your having let Norbanus get away is something I confess I am\nunable to imagine.\"\n\n\"Conjure your imagination!\" Pertinax retorted.  \"I am to inquire into\nthe suitability of Antioch or Daphne as the site of the Olympic games\nthat the emperor proposed to preside over in person.  You can imagine, I\nsuppose, how profitable that would be for Antioch--and you.  Am I to\ntell the emperor that robbers in the mountains and the laxity of local\ngovernment make the selection of Antioch unwise?\"\n\nThey stared at each other silently across the table, Pertinax erect and\ndefinite, the governor of Antioch indefinite and stroking his chin with\nfat, white fingers.\n\n\"It would be simplest,\" said the governor of Antioch at last, \"to have\nNorbanus executed.\"\n\n\"Some one should always be executed when the emperor signs proscription\nlists!\" said Pertinax.  \"Has it ever occurred to you to wonder how many\nsoldiers in the legions in the distant provinces were certified as dead\nbefore they left Rome?\"\n\nThe governor of Antioch smiled meanly.  He resented the suggestions that\nthere might be tricks he did not understand.\n\n\"I have a prisoner,\" he said, \"who might be Norbanus.  He has been\ntortured.  He refused to identify himself.\"\n\n\"Does he look like him?\"\n\n\"That would be difficult to say.  He broke into a jeweler's and was very\nbadly beaten by the slaves, who slashed his face, which is heavily\nbandaged.  He appears to be a Roman and is certainly a thief, but beyond\nthat--\"\n\n\"Much depends on who is interested in him,\" Pertinax suggested. \"Usually\na man's relatives--\"\n\nBut the governor of Antioch's fat hand made a disparaging careless\ngesture.  \"He has no friends.  He has been in the carceres (the cells in\nwhich prisoners were kept who had been sentenced to death.  Under Roman\nlaw there was practically no imprisonment for crime.  Fines, flogging,\nbanishment were the substitutes for execution.) more than a month.  I\nwas reserving him for execution by the lions at the next public games.\nTruth to tell, I had almost forgotten him.  I will write out a warrant\nfor Norbanus' execution and it shall be attended to this morning. And by\nthe way--regarding the Olympic games--\"\n\n\"The emperor, I think, would like to see them held in Antioch,\" said\nPertinax.\n\n\nThe merchants strolling to the baths stood curiously for a while to\nwatch one of the rapidly increasing sect of Christians, who leaned from\na balcony over the street and exhorted a polyglot crowd of freedmen,\nslaves and idlers.  He was bearded, brown-skinned from exposure, brown-\nrobed, scrawny, vehement.\n\n\"Peculiar times!\" one merchant said.  \"If you and I should cause a crowd\nto gather while we prated about refusal to do homage to the gods--of\nwhom mind you, the emperor is one, and not the least--\"\n\n\"But let us listen,\" said the other.\n\nThe man's voice was resonant.  He used no tricks of oratory such as\nRomans over-valued, and was not too careful in the choice of phrases.\nThe Greek idiom he used was unadorned--the language of the market-place\nand harbor-front.  He made his points directly, earnestly, not arguing\nbut like a guide to far-off countries giving information:\n\n\"Slaves--freedmen--masters--all are equal before God, and on the last\nday all shall rise up from the dead--\"\n\nA loiterer heckled him:\n\n\"Hah!  The crucified too?--what about Maternus?\"\n\nThe preacher, throwing up his right hand, snatched at opportunity:\n\n\"There were two thieves crucified, one on either hand, as I have told\nyou.  To the one was said:  'This day shalt thou be with me in\nparadise';  but to the other nothing.  Nevertheless, all shall rise up\nfrom the dead on the last day--you, and your friends, and the wise and\nthe fools, and the slave and the free--aye, and Maternus also--\"\n\nOne merchant grinned to the other:\n\n\"Yet I think it was on the first night that Maternus rose up! They\nstiffen if they stay a whole night on the cross.  If he could walk to\nDaphne three nights later, he had not been crucified many hours.  Come,\nlet us go to the baths before the crowd gets there.  If one is late\nthose insolent attendants lose one's clothing, and there is no chance\nwhatever of getting a good soft-handed slave to rub one down.  Don't you\nhate to be currycombed by a rascal with corns on his fingers?\"\n\n\n\n\nV.  ROME--THE THERMAE OF TITUS\n\n\n\nThere were even birds, to fill the air with music.  All the known world,\nand the far-away mysterious lands of which Alexander's followers had\nstarted legends multiplying centuries ago, had contributed to Rome's\nadornment;  plunder and trade goods drifted through in spite of\ndistances.  The city had become the vortex of the energy, virility and\nvice of east and west--a glory of marble and gilded cornices, of domes\nand spires, of costumes, habits, faces, languages--of gorgeousness and\nsqualor--license, privilege and rigid formalism--extravagance--and of\ninnumerable gods.\n\nThere was nobility and love of virtue, cheek by jowl with beastliness,\nnor was it always easy to discover which was which; but the birds sang\nblithely in the cages in the portico, where the long seat was on which\nphilosophers discoursed to any one who cared to listen.  The baths that\nthe Emperor Titus built were the supreme, last touch of all.  From\nfurnaces below-ground, where the whipped slaves sweated in the dark, to\ndomed roof where the doves changed hue amid the gleam of gold and\ncolored glass, they typified Rome, as the city herself was of the\nessence of the world.\n\nThe approach to the Thermae of Titus was blocked by litters, some heavy\nenough to be borne by eight matched slaves and large enough for company.\nWomen oftener than men shared litters with friends; then the troupe of\nattendants was doubled;  slaves were in droves, flocks, hordes around\nthe building, making a motley sight of it in their liveries, which were\nadaptations of the every-day costumes of almost all the countries of the\nknown world.\n\nUnder the entrance portico, between the double row of marble columns,\nsat a throng of fortune-tellers of both sexes, privileged because the\naedile of that year had superstitious leanings, but as likely as not to\nbe driven away, and even whipped, when the next man should succeed to\noffice.  In and out among the crowd ran tipsters, touts for gambling\ndens and sellers of charms;  most of them found ready customers among\nthe slaves, who had nothing to do but wait, and stare, and yawn until\ntheir masters came out from the baths.  They were raw, inexperienced\nslaves who had not a coin or two to spend.\n\nWithin the entrance of the Thermae was a marble court, where better\nknown philosophers discoursed on topics of the day, each to his own\ngroup of admirers.  A Christian, dressed like any other Roman, held one\ncorner with a crowd around him.  There was a tremendous undercurrent of\nreaction against the prevalent cynical materialism and the vortex of\nfashion was also the cauldron of new aspirations and the battle-ground\nof wits.\n\nBeyond the inner entrance were the two disrobing rooms--women to the\nleft, men to the right where slaves, whose insolence had grown into a\ncultivated art, exchanged the folded garments for a bracelet with a\nnumber.  Thence, stark-naked, through the bronze doors set in green-\nveined marble, bathers passed into the vast frigidarium, whose marble\nplunge was surrounded by a mosaic promenade beneath a bronze and marble\nbalcony.\n\nThere men and women mingled indiscriminately, watching the divers,\nconversing, matching wits, exchanging gossip, some walking briskly\naround the promenade while others lounged on the marble seats that were\ninterspaced against the wall between the statues.\n\nThere was not one gesture of indecency.  A man who had stared at a woman\nwould have been thrown out, execrated and forever more refused\nadmission.  But out in the street, where the litter-bearers and\nattendants whiled away the time, there were tales told that spread to\nthe ends of the earth.\n\n\nOn a bench of black marble, between two statues of the Grecian Muses,\nPertinax sat talking with Bultius Livius, sub-prefect of the palace.\nThey were both pink-skinned from plunging in the pool, and the white\nscars, won in frontier wars, showed all the more distinctly. Boltius\nLivius was a clean-shaven, sharp-looking man with a thin-lipped air of\nkeenness.\n\n\"This dependence on Marcia can easily be overdone,\" he remarked. His\neyes moved restlessly left and right.  He lowered his voice. \"Nobody\nknows how long her hold over Caesar will last.  She owns him at present\nowns him absolutely--owns Rome.  He delights in letting her revoke his\norders;  it's a form of self-debauchery; he does things purposely to\nhave her overrule him.  But that has already lasted longer than I\nthought it would.\"\n\n\"It will last as long as she and her Christians spy for him and make\nlife pleasant,\" said Pertinax.\n\n\"Exactly.  But that is the difficulty,\" Livius answered, moving his eyes\nagain restlessly.  There was not much risk of informers in the Thermae,\nbut a man never knew who his enemies were. \"Marcia represents the\nChristians, and the idiots won't let well enough alone.  By Hercules,\nthey have it all their own way, thanks to Marcia.  They are allowed to\nhold their meetings.  All the statutes against them are ignored.  They\neven go unpunished if they don't salute Caesar's image!  They are\nallowed to preach against slavery.  It has got so now that if a man\ncondemned to death pretends he is a Christian they're even allowed to\nrescue him out of the carceres!  That's Juno's truth:  I know of a dozen\ninstances.  But it's the old story:  Put a beggar on a horse and he will\ndemand your house next.  There's no satisfying them.  I am told they\npropose to abolish the gladiatorial combats!  Laugh if you like.  I have\nit from unquestionable sources.  They intend to begin by abolishing the\nexecution of criminals in the arena. Shades of Nero!  They keep after\nMarcia day and night to dissuade Caesar from taking part in the\nspectacles, on the theory that he helps to make them popular.\"\n\n\"What do they propose to substitute in popular esteem?\" asked Pertinax.\n\n\"I don't know.  They're mad enough for anything, and their hold over\nMarcia is beyond belief.  The next thing you'll know, they'll persuade\nher it's against religion to be Caesar's mistress!  They're quite\ncapable of sawing off the branch they're sitting on.  By Hercules, I\nhope they do it!  Some of us might go down in the scramble, but--\"\n\n\"Does Marcia give Christian reasons to the emperor?\" asked Pertinax, his\nforehead puzzled.\n\n\"No, no.  No, by Hercules. No, no.  Marcia is as skillful at managing\nCommodus as he is at hurling a javelin or driving horses.  She talks\nabout the dignity of Caesar and the glory of Rome--uses truth adroitly\nfor her own ends--argues that if he continues to keep company with\ngladiators and jockeys, and insists on taking part in the combats, Rome\nmay begin to despise him.\"\n\n\"Rome does!\" murmured Pertinax, his eyes and lips suggesting a mere\nflicker of a smile.  \"But only let Commodus once wake up to the fact\nand--\"\n\nBultius Livius nodded.\n\n\"He will return the compliment and show us how to despise at wholesale,\neh?  Marcia's life and yours and mine wouldn't be worth an hour's\npurchase.  The problem is, who shall warn Marcia? She grows intolerant\nof friendly hints.  I made her a present the other day of eight matched\nGerman' litter-bearers--beauties--they cost a fortune--and I took the\nopportunity to have a chat with her.  She told me to go home and try to\nmanage my own wife! Friendly enough--she laughed--she meant no enmity;\nbut shrewd though she is, and far-seeing though she is, the wine of\ninfluence is going to her head.  You know what that portends. Few men,\nand fewer women, can drink deeply of that wine and--\"\n\n\"She comes,\" said Pertinax.\n\nThere was a stir near the bronze door leading to the women's disrobing\nhall.  Six women in a group were answering greetings, Marcia in their\nmidst, but no man in the Thermae looked at them a moment longer than was\nnecessary to return the wave of the hand with which Marcia greeted every\none before walking down the steps into the plunge.  She did not even\nwear the customary bracelet with its numbered metal disk;  not even the\nattendants at the Thermae would presume to lose the clothing of the\nmistress of the emperor.  Commodus, who at the age of twelve had flung a\nslave into the furnace because the water was too hot, would have made\nshort work of any one who mislaid Marcia's apparel.\n\nShe did not belie her reputation.  It was no wonder that the sculptors\nclaimed that every new Venus they turned out was Marcia's portrait.  Her\nbeauty, as her toes touched water, was like that of Aphrodite rising\nfrom the wave.  The light from the dome shone golden on her brown hair\nand her glossy skin.  She was a thing of sensuous delight, incapable of\ncoarseness, utterly untouched by the suggestion of vulgarity, and yet--\n\n\"It is strange she should take up with fancy religions,\" said Pertinax\nunder his breath.\n\nShe was pagan in every gesture, and not a patrician.  That was\nindefinable but evident to trained eyes.  Neither he, who knew her\nintimately, nor the newest, newly shaven son of a provincial for the\nfirst time exploring the wonders of Rome, could have imagined her as\nanything except a rich man's mistress.\n\nShe plunged into the pool and swam like a mermaid, her companions\nfollowing, climbed out at the farther end, where the diving-boards\nprojected in tiers, one above the other, and passed through a bronze\ndoor into the first of the sweating rooms, evidently conscious of the\nmurmur of comment that followed her, but taking no overt notice of it.\n\n\"Who is to be the next to try to reason with her--you?\" asked Boltius\nLivius.\n\n\"No, not I.  I have shot my bolt,\" said Pertinax and closed his eyes, as\nif to shut out something from his memory--or possibly to banish thoughts\nhe did not relish.  There came a definite, hard glint into Livius's\neyes;  he had a name for being sharper to detect intrigue and its\nramifications than even the sharp outline of his face would indicate.\n\n\"You have heard of her latest indiscretion?\" he asked, narrowly watching\nPertinax.  \"There is a robber at large, named Maternus--you have heard\nof him?  The man appears and disappears.  Some say he is the same\nMaternus who was crucified near Antioch at about the time when you were\nthere;  some say he isn't.  He is reported to visit Rome in various\ndisguises, and to be able to conduct himself so well that he can pass\nfor a patrician.  Some say he has a large band;  some say, hardly any\nfollowers.  Some say it was he who robbed the emperor's own mail a month\nago.  He is reported to be here, there, everywhere;  but there came at\nlast reliable information that he lives in a cave in the woods on an\nestate that fell to the fiscus (the government department into which all\npayments were made, corresponding roughly to a modern treasury\ndepartment) at the time when Maximus and his son Sextus were\nproscribed.\"\n\nPertinax looked bored. He yawned.\n\n\"I think I will go in and sweat a while,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Not yet.  Let me finish,\" said Livius.  \"It was reported to Caesar that\nthe highwayman Maternus lives in a cave on this Aventine estate, and\nthat the slaves and tenants on the place, who, of course, all passed to\nthe new owner when the estate was sold, not only tolerate him but supply\nhim with victuals and news.  Caesar went into one of his usual frenzies,\ncursed half the senators by name, and ordered out a cohort from a legion\ngetting ready to embark at Ostia.  He ordered them to lay waste the\nestate, burn all the woods and if necessary torture the slaves and\ntenants, until they had Maternus.  Dead or alive, they were not to dare\nto come without him, and meanwhile the rest of the legion was kept\nwaiting at Ostia, with all the usual nuisance of desertions and\ndrunkenness and what not else.\"\n\n\"Everybody knows about that,\" said Pertinax.  \"As governor of Rome it\nwas my duty to point out to the emperor the inconvenience of keeping\nthat legion waiting under arms so near the city.  I was snubbed for my\npains, but I did my duty.\"\n\n\"Your duty?  There were plenty of people more concerned than you,\" said\nLivius, looking again as if he thought he had detected an intrigue.\n\"There were the Ostian authorities, for instance, but I did not hear of\ntheir complaining.\"\n\n\"Naturally not,\" said Pertinax, suppressing irritation.  \"Every day the\nlegion lingered there meant money for the enterprising city fathers.  I\nam opposed to all the petty pouching of commissions that goes on.\"\n\n\"Doubtless.  Being governor of Rome, you naturally--\"\n\n\"I have heard of peculations at the palace,\" Pertinax interrupted.\n\n\"Be that as it may, Commodus ordered out the cohort, sent it marching\nand amused himself inventing new ingenious torments for Maternus.\nAlternatively, he proposed to himself to have the cohort slaughtered in\nthe arena, officers and all, if they should fail of their mission;  so\nit was safe to wager they were going to bring back some one said to be\nMaternus, whether or not they caught the right man.  Commodus was\nindulging in one of his storms of imperial righteousness.  He was going\nto stamp out lawlessness.  He was going to make it safe for any one to\ncome or go along the Roman roads.  Oh, he was in a fine Augustan mood.\nIt wasn't safe for any one but Marcia to come within a mile of him.\nScowl--you know that scowl of his--it freezes the very sentries on the\nwall if he looks at their backs through the window!  I don't suppose\nthere was a woman in Rome just then who would have cared to change\nplaces with Marcia!  He sent for her, and half the palace betted she was\nripe for banishment to one of those island retreats where Crispina (the\nwife of Commodus who was banished to the isle of Capreae and there\nsecretly put to death) lived less than a week!  But Marcia is fertile of\nsurprises.  She won't surprise me if she outlives Commodus--by Hercules,\nshe won't surprise me if--\"\n\nHe stared at Pertinax with impudently keen eyes.  Pertinax looked at the\nbronze door leading to the sweating room, shrugging himself as if the\nfrigidarium had grown too cool for comfort.\n\n\"Marcia actually persuaded Commodus to countermand the order!\" Livius\nsaid, emphasizing each word.  \"Almighty Jove can only guess what\nargument she used, but if Maternus had been one of her pet Christians\nshe couldn't have saved him more successfully. Commodus sent a messenger\npost-haste that night to recall the cohort.\"\n\n\"And a good thing too,\" Pertinax remarked.  \"It isn't a legion's\nbusiness to supply cohorts to do the work of the district police. There\nwere five thousand raw men on the verge of mutiny in Ostia--\"\n\n\"And--wait a minute--and,\" said Livius, \"don't go yet--this is\ninteresting:  Marcia, that same night, sent a messenger of her own to\nfind Maternus and to warn him.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" Pertinax let a sign of nervousness escape him.\n\n\"In the palace, those of us who value our lives and our fortunes make it\na business to know what goes on,\" Livius answered with a dry laugh,\n\"just as you take care to know what goes on in the city, Pertinax.\"\n\nThe older man looked worried.\n\n\"Do you mean it is common gossip in the palace?\" he demanded.\n\n\"You are the first man I have spoken with.  There are therefore only\nthree who know, if you count the slave whom Marcia employed; four if you\ncount Marcia.  I had the great good luck not long ago to catch that\nslave in flagrante delicto--never mind what he was doing;  that is\nanother story altogether--and he gave me an insight into a number of\nuseful secrets.  The point is, that particular slave takes care not to\nrun errands nowadays without informing me.  There is not much that\nMarcia does that I don't know about.\"  Livius' eyes suggested gimlets\nboring holes into Pertinax's face.  Not a change of the other's\nexpression escaped him.  Pertinax covered his mouth with his hand,\npretending to yawn.  He slapped his thighs to suggest that his\ninvoluntary shudder was due to having sat too long.  But he did not\ndeceive Livius.  \"It is known to me,\" said Livius, \"that you and Marcia\nare in each other's confidence.\"\n\n\"That makes me doubt your other information,\" Pertinax retorted. \"No man\ncan jump to such a ridiculous conclusion and call it knowledge without\nmaking me doubt him on all points.  You bore me, Livius.  I have\nimportant business waiting;  I must make haste into the sweating room\nand get that over with.\"\n\nBut Livius' sharp, nervous laugh arrested him.\n\n\"Not yet, friend Pertinax!  Let Rome wait!  Rome's affairs will outlive\nboth of us.  I suspect you intend to tell Marcia to have my name\nincluded in the next proscription list!  But I am not quite such a\nsimpleton as that.  Sit down and listen.  I have proof that you plotted\nwith the governor of Antioch to have an unknown criminal executed in\nplace of a certain Norbanus, who escaped with your connivance and has\nsince become a follower of the highwayman Maternus.  That involves you\nrather seriously, doesn't it!  You see, I made sure of my facts before\napproaching you.  And now--admit that I approached you tactfully!  Come,\nPertinax, I made no threats until you let me see I was in danger. I\nadmire you.  I regard you as a brave and an honorable Roman.  I propose\nthat you and I shall understand each other.  You must take me into\nconfidence, or I must take steps to protect myself.\"\n\nThere was a long pause while a group of men and women came and chattered\nnear by, laughing while one of the men tried to win a wager by climbing\na marble pillar.  Pertinax frowned.  Livius did his best to look\ndependable and friendly, but his eyes were not those of a boon\ncompanion.\n\n\"You are incapable of loyalty to any one except yourself,\" said Pertinax\nat last.  \"What pledge do you propose to offer me?\"\n\n\"A white bull to Jupiter Capitolinus!  I am willing to go with you to\nthe temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and to swear on the altar whatever\nsolemn oath you wish.\"\n\nPertinax smiled cynically.\n\n\"The men who slew Julius Caesar were under oath to him,\" he remarked.\n\"Most solemn oaths they swore, then turned on one another like a pack of\nwolves!  Octavian and Anthony were under oath;  and how long did that\nlast?  My first claim to renown was based on having rewon the allegiance\nof our troops in Britain, who had broken the most solemn oath a man can\ntake--of loyalty to Rome.  An oath binds nobody.  It simply is an\nemphasis of what a man intends that minute.  It expresses an emotion.  I\nbelieve the gods smile when they hear men pledge themselves.  I\npersonally, who am far less than a god and far less capable of reading\nmen's minds, never trust a man unless I like him, or unless he gives me\npledges that make doubt impossible.\"\n\n\"Then you don't like me?\" asked Livius.\n\n\"I would like you better if I knew that I could trust you.\"\n\n\"You shall, Pertinax!  Bring witnesses!  I will commit myself before\nyour witnesses to do my part in--\"\n\nHis restless eyes glanced right and left.  Then he lowered his voice.\n\n\"--in bringing about the political change you contemplate.\"\n\n\"Let us go to the sweating room,\" Pertinax answered.  \"Keep near me.  I\nwill think this matter over.  If I see you holding speech not audible to\nme, with any one--\"\n\n\"I am already pledged.  You may depend on me,\" said Livius.  \"I trust\nyou more because you use caution.  Come.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI. THE EMPEROR COMMODUS\n\n\n\nThe imperial palace was a maze of splendor such as Babylon had never\nseen.  It had its own great aqueducts to carry water for its fountains,\nfor the gardens and for the imperial baths that were as magnificent, if\nnot so large, as the Thermae of Titus. Palace after palace had been\nwrecked, remodeled and included in the whole, under the succeeding\nemperors, until the imperial quarters on the Palatine had grown into a\ncity within a city.\n\nThere were barracks for the praetorian guard that lacked not much of\nbeing a fortress.  Rooms and stairways for the countless slaves were\nlike honeycomb cells in the dark foundations.  There were underground\npassages, some of them secret, some notorious, connecting wing with\nwing;  and there was one, for the emperor's private use, that led to the\ngreat arena where the games were held, so that he might come and go with\nless risk of assassination.\n\nEven temples had been taken over and included within the surrounding\nwall to make room for the ever-multiplying suites of state apartments,\nas each Caesar strove to outdo the magnificence of his predecessor.\nOriental marble, gold-leaf, exotic trees, silk awnings, fountains, the\nmajestic figures of the guards, the bronze doors and the huge height of\nthe buildings, awed even the Romans who were used to them.\n\nThe throne-room was a place of such magnificence that it was said that\neven Caesar himself felt small in it.  The foreign kings, ambassadors\nand Roman citizens admitted there to audience were disciplined without\nthe slightest difficulty;  there was no unseemliness, no haste, no\ncrowding;  horribly uncomfortable in the heavy togas that court\netiquette prescribed, reminded of their dignity by colossal statues of\nthe noblest Romans of antiquity, and ushered by magnificently uniformed\npast masters of the art of ceremony, all who entered felt that they were\ninsignificant intruders into a golden mystery.  The palace prefect in\nhis cloak of cloth of gold, with his ivory wand of office, seemed a high\npriest of eternity;  subprefects, standing in the marble antechamber to\nexamine visitors' credentials and see that none passed in improperly\nattired, were keepers of Olympus.\n\nThe gilded marble throne was on a dais approached by marble steps,\nbeneath a balcony to which a stair ascended from behind a carved screen.\nTrumpets announced the approach of Caesar, who could enter unobserved\nthrough a door at the side of the dais. From the moment that the trumpet\nsounded, and the guards grew as rigid as the basalt statues in the\nniches of the columned walls, it was a punishable crime to speak or even\nto move until Caesar appeared and was seated.\n\nNor was Caesar himself an anticlimax.  Even Nero, nerveless in his\nlatter days, when self-will and debauchery had pouched his eyes and\nstomach, had possessed the Roman gift of standing like a god.  Vespasian\nand Titus, each in turn, was Mars personified. Aurelius had typified a\ngentler phase of Rome, a subtler dignity, but even he, whose worst\nseverity was tempered by the philosophical regret that he could not kill\ncrime with kindliness, had worn the imperial purple like Olympus'\ndelegate.\n\nCommodus, in the minutes that he spared from his amusements to accept\nthe glamor of the throne, was perfect.  Handsomest of all the Caesars,\nhe could act his part with such consummate majesty that men who knew him\nintimately half-believed he was a hero after all.  Athletic, muscular\nand systematically trained, his vigor, that was purely physical, passed\nreadily for spiritual quality within that golden hall, where the\nresources of the world were all put under tribute to provide a royal\nsetting.  He emerged.  He smiled, as if the sun shone.  He observed the\nrolled petitions, greetings, testimonials of flattery from private\ncitizens and addresses of adulation from distant cities, being heaped\ninto a gilded basket as the silent throng filed by beneath him.  He\nnodded.  Now and then he scowled, his irritation growing as the minutes\npassed.  At each gesture of impatience the subprefects quietly impelled\nthe crowd to quicker movement. But at the end of fifteen minutes\nCommodus grew tired of dignity and his ferocious scowl clouded his face\nlike a thunderstorm.\n\n\"Am I to sit here while the whole world makes itself ridiculous by\nstaring at me?\" he demanded, in a harsh voice.  It was loud enough to\nfill the throne-room, but none knew whether it was meant for an aside or\nnot and none dared answer him.  The crowd continued flowing by, each\nraising his right hand and bowing as he reached the square of carpet\nthat was placed exactly in front of Caesar's throne.\n\nCommodus rose to his feet.  All movement ceased then and there was utter\nsilence.  For a moment he stood scowling at the crowd, one hand resting\non the golden lion's head that flanked the throne.  Then he laughed.\n\n\"Too many petitions!\" he sneered, pointing at the overflowing basket;\nand in another moment he had vanished through the door behind the marble\nscreen.  Met and escorted up the stairs by groups of cringing slaves, he\nreached a columned corridor.  Rich carpets lay on the mosaic floor;\nsunlight, from under;  the awnings of a balcony glorious with potted\nflowers, shone on the colored statuary and the Grecian paintings.\n\n\"What are all these women doing?\" he demanded.  There were girls, half-\nhidden behind the statues, each one trying, as he passed her, to divine\nhis mood and to pose attractively.\n\n\"Where is Marcia?  What will she do to me next?  Is this some new scheme\nof hers to keep me from enjoying my manhood?  Send them away!  The next\ngirl I catch in the corridor shall be well whipped.  Where is Marcia?\"\n\nThrowing away his toga for a slave to catch and fold he turned between\ngilded columns, through a bronze door, into the antechamber of the royal\nsuite.  There a dozen gladiators greeted him as if he were the sun\nshining out of the clouds after a month of rainy weather.\n\n\"This is better!\" he exclaimed.  \"Ho, there, Narcissus!  Ho, there,\nHoratius!  Ha!  So you recover, Albinus?  What a skull the man has!  Not\nmany could take what I gave him and be on their feet again within the\nweek!  You may follow me, Narcissus.  But where is Marcia?\"\n\nMarcia called to him through the curtained door that led to the next\nroom--\n\n\"I am waiting, Commodus.\"\n\n\"By Jupiter, when she calls me Commodus it means an argument! Are some\nmore of her Christians in the carceres, I wonder?  Or has some new\nhighwayman--By Juno's breasts, I tremble when she calls me Commodus!\"\n\nThe gladiators laughed.  He made a pass at one of them, tripped him,\nscuffled a moment and raised him struggling in the air, then flung him\ninto the nearest group, who broke his fall and set him on his feet\nagain.\n\n\"Am I strong enough to face my Marcia?\" he asked and, laughing, passed\ninto the other room, where half a dozen women grouped themselves around\nthe imperial mistress.\n\n\"What now?\" he demanded.  \"Why am I called Commodus?\"\n\nHe stood magnificent, with folded arms, confronting her, play-acting the\npart of a guiltless man arraigned before the magistrate.\n\n\"O Roman Hercules,\" she said, \"I spoke in haste, you came so much sooner\nthan expected.  What woman can remember you are anything but Caesar when\nyou smile at her?  I am in love, and being loved, I am--\"\n\n\"Contriving some new net for me, I'll wager!  Come and watch the new men\ntraining with the caestus;  I will listen to your plan for ruling me and\nRome while the sight of a good set-to stirs my genius to resist your\nblandishments!\"\n\n\"Caesar,\" she said, \"speak first with me alone.\"  Instantly his manner\nchanged.  He made a gesture of impatience.  His sudden scowl frightened\nthe women standing behind Marcia, although she appeared not to notice\nit, with the same peculiar trick of seeming not to see what she did not\nwish to seem to see that she had used when she walked naked through the\nThermae.\n\n\"Send your scared women away then,\" he retorted.  \"I trust Narcissus.\nYou may speak before him.\"\n\nHer women vanished, hurrying into another room, the last one drawing a\ncord that closed a jingling curtain.\n\n\"Do you not trust me?\" asked Marcia.  \"And is it seemly, Commodus, that\nI should speak to you before a gladiator?\"\n\n\"Speak or be silent!\" he grumbled, giving her a black look, but she did\nnot seem to notice it.  Her genius--the secret of her power--was to seem\nforever imperturbable and loving.\n\n\"Let Narcissus bear witness then;  since Caesar bids me, I obey! Again\nand again I have warned you, Caesar.  If I were less your slave and more\nyour sycophant I would have tired of warning you. But none shall say of\nMarcia that her Caesar met Nero's fate, whose women ran away and left\nhim.  Not while Marcia lives shall Commodus declare he has no friends.\"\n\n\"Who now?\" he demanded angrily.  \"Get me my tablet!  Come now, name me\nyour conspirators and they shall die before the sun sets!\"\n\nWhen he scowled his beauty vanished, his eyes seeming to grow closer\nlike an ape's.  The mania for murder that obsessed him tautened his\nsinews.  Cheeks, neck, forearms swelled with knotted strength.\nUngovernable passion shook him.\n\n\"Name them!\" he repeated, beckoning unconsciously for the tablet that\nnone dared thrust into his hand.\n\n\"Shall I name all Rome?\" asked Marcia, stepping closer, pressing herself\nagainst him.  \"O Hercules, my Roman Hercules--does love, that makes us\nwomen see, put bandages on men's eyes?  You have turned your back upon\nthe better part of Rome to--\"\n\n\"Better part?\" He shook her by the shoulders, snorting.  \"Liars,\ncowards, ingrates, strutting peacocks, bladders of wind boring me and\none another with their empty phrases, cringing lick-spittles--they make\nme sick to look at them!  They fawn on me like hungry dogs.  By Jupiter,\nI make myself ridiculous too often, pandering to a lot of courtiers!  If\nthey despise me then as I despise myself, I am in a bad way!  I must\nmake haste and live again!  I will get the stench of them out of my\nnostrils and the sickening sight of them out of my eyes by watching true\nmen fight!  When I slay lions with a javelin, or gladiators--\"\n\n\"You but pander to the rabble,\" Marcia interrupted.  \"So did Nero.  Did\nthey come to his aid when the senate and his friends deserted him?\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt me, woman!  Senate!  Court!\" he snorted.  \"I can rout\nthe senate with a gesture!  I will fill my court with gladiators!  I can\nchange my ministers as often as I please--aye, and my mistress too,\" he\nadded, glaring at her.  \"Out with the names of these new conspirators\nwho have set you trembling for my destiny!\"\n\n\"I know none--not yet,\" she said.  \"I can feel, though.  I hear the\nwhispers in the Thermae--\"\n\n\"By Jupiter, then I will close the Thermae.\"\n\n\"When I pass through the streets I read men's faces--\"\n\n\"Snarled, have they?  My praetorian guard shall show them what it is to\nbe bitten!  Mobs are no new things in Rome.  The old way is the proper\nway to deal with mobs!  Blood, corn and circuses, but principally blood!\nBy the Dioscuri, I grow weary of your warnings, Marcia!\"\n\nHe thrust her away from him and went growling like a bear into his own\napartment, where his voice could be heard cursing the attendants whose\ndangerous duty it was to divine in an instant what clothes he would wear\nand to help him into them.  He came out naked through the door, saw\nMarcia talking to Narcissus, laughed and disappeared again.  Marcia\nraised her voice:\n\n\"Telamonion!  Oh, Telamonion!\"\n\nA curly-headed Greek boy hardly eight years old came running from the\nouter corridor--all laughter--one of those spoiled favorites of fortune\nwhom it was the fashion to keep as pets.  Their usefulness consisted\nmainly in retention of their innocence.\n\n\"Telamonion, go in and play with him.  Go in and make him laugh. He is\nbad tempered.\"\n\nConfident of everybody's good-will, the child vanished through the\ncurtains where Commodus roared him a greeting.  Marcia continued talking\nto Narcissus in a low voice.\n\n\"When did you see Sextus last?\" she asked.\n\n\"But yesterday.\"\n\n\"And what has he done, do you say?  Tell me that again.\"\n\n\"He has found out the chiefs of the party of Lucius Septimius Severus.\nHe has also discovered the leaders of Pescennius Niger's party.  He\nsays, too, there is a smaller group that looks toward Clodius Albinus,\nwho commands the troops in Britain.\"\n\n\"Did he tell you names?\"\n\n\"No.  He said he knew I would tell you, and you might tell Commodus, who\nwould write all the names on his proscription list. Sextus, I tell you,\nreckons his own life nothing, but he is extremely careful for his\nfriends.\"\n\n\"It would be easy to set a trap and catch him.  He is insolent. He has\nhad too much rein,\" said Marcia.  \"But what would be the use?\" Narcissus\nanswered.  \"There would be Norbanus, too, to reckon with.  Each plays\ninto the other's hands.  Each knows the other's secrets.  Kill one, and\nthere remains the other--doubly dangerous because alarmed.  They take\nturns to visit Rome, the other remaining in hiding with their following\nof freedmen and educated slaves.  They only commit just enough robbery\nto gain themselves an enviable reputation on the countryside.  They\nvisit their friends in Rome in various disguises, and they travel all\nover Italy to plot with the adherents of this faction or the other.\nSextus favors Pertinax--says he would make a respectable emperor--\nanother Marcus Aurelius.  But Pertinax knows next to nothing of Sextus'\ndoings, although he protects Sextus as far as he can and sees him now\nand then.  Sextus' plan is to keep all three rival factions by the ears,\nso that if anything should happen--\" he nodded toward the curtain, from\nbehind which came the sounds of childish laughter and the crashing voice\nof Commodus encouraging in some piece of mischief--\"they would be all\nat odds and Pertinax could seize the throne.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether I was mad that I protected Sextus!\" exclaimed Marcia.\n\"He has served us well.  If I had let them catch and crucify him as\nMaternus, we would have had no one to keep us informed of all these\ncross-conspiracies.  But are you sure he favors Pertinax?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.  He even risked an interview with Flavia Titiana, to\nimplore her influence with her husband.  Sextus would be all for\nstriking now, this instant;  he has assured himself that the world is\ntired of Commodus, and that no faction is strong enough to stand in the\nway of Pertinax;  but he knows how difficult it will be to persuade\nPertinax to assert himself.  Pertinax will not hear of murdering Caesar;\nhe says:  'Let us see what happens--if the Fates intend me to be Caesar,\nlet the Fates show how!'\"\n\n\"Aye, that is Pertinax!\" said Marcia.  \"Why is it that the honest men\nare all such delayers!  As for me, I will save my Commodus if he will\nlet me.  If not, the praetorian guard shall put Pertinax on the throne\nbefore any other faction has a chance to move. Otherwise we all die--all\nof us!  Severus--Pescennius Niger--Clodius Albinus--any of the others\nwould include us in a general proscription.  Pertinax is friendly.  He\nprotects his friends. He is the safest man in all ways.  Let Pertinax be\nacclaimed by all the praetorian guard and the senate would accept him\neagerly enough.  They would feel sure of his mildness.  Pertinax would\ndo no wholesale murdering to wipe out opposition;  he would try to\npacify opponents by the institution of reforms and decent government.\"\n\n\"You must beware you are not forestalled,\" Narcissus warned her. \"Sextus\ntells me there is more than one man ready to slay Commodus at the first\nchance.  Severus, Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus keep themselves\ninformed as to what is going on; their messengers are in constant\nmovement.  If Commodus should lift a hand against either of those three,\nthat would be the signal for civil war.  All three would march on Rome.\"\n\n\"Caesar is much more likely to learn of the plotting through his own\ninformers, and to try to terrify the generals by killing their\nsupporters here in Rome,\" said Marcia.  \"What does Sextus intend?  To\nkill Caesar himself?\"\n\nNarcissus nodded.\n\n\"Well, when Sextus thinks that time has come, you kill him!  Let that be\nyour task.  We must save the life of Commodus as long as possible.  When\nnothing further can be done, we must involve Pertinax so that he won't\ndare to back out.  It was he, you know, who persuaded me to save\nMaternus the highwayman's life;  it was he who told me Maternus is\nreally Sextus, son of Maximus.  His knowledge of that secret gives me a\ncertain hold on Pertinax! Caesar would have his head off at a word from\nme.  But the best way with Pertinax is to stroke the honest side of him\n--the charcoal-burner side of him--the peasant side, if that can be done\nwithout making him too diffident.  He is perfectly capable of offering\nthe throne to some one else at the last minute!\"\n\nA step sounded on the other side of the curtain.  \"Caesar!\" Narcissus\nwhispered.  As excuse for being seen in conversation with her he began\nto show her a charm against all kinds of treachery that he had bought\nfrom an Egyptian.  She snatched it from him.\n\n\"Caesar!\" she exclaimed, bounding toward Commodus and standing in his\nway.  Not even she dared lay a hand on him when he was in that volcanic\nmood.  \"As you love me, will you wear this?\"\n\n\"For love of you, what have I not done?\" he retorted, smiling at her.\n\"What now?\"\n\nShe advanced another half-step, but no nearer.  There was laughter on\nhis lips, but in his eye cold cruelty.\n\n\"My Caesar, wear it!  It protects against conspiracy.\"\n\nHe showed her a new sword that he had girded on along with the short\ntunic of a gladiator.\n\n\"Against the bellyache, use Galen's pills;  but this is the right\nmedicine against conspiracy!\" he answered.  Then he took the little\ngolden charm into his left hand, tossing it on his palm and looked at\nher, still smiling.\n\n\"Where did you get this bauble?\"\n\n\"Not I.  One of those magicians who frequent that Forum sold it to\nNarcissus.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"  He flung it through the window.  \"Who is the magician? Name him!\nI will have him thrown into the carceres.  We'll see whether the charms\nhe sells so cheap are any good!  Or is he a Christian?\" he asked,\nsneering.\n\n\"The Christians, you know, don't approve of charms,\" Marcia answered.\n\n\"By Jupiter, there's not much that they do approve of!\" he retorted.  \"I\nbegin to weary of your Christians.  I begin to think Nero was right, and\nmy father, too!  There was a wisdom in treating Christians as vermin!\nIt might not be a bad thing, Marcia, to warn your Christians to procure\nthemselves a charm or two against my weariness of their perpetual\nefforts to govern me! The Christians, I suppose, have been telling you\nto keep me out of the arena?  Hence this living statuary in the\ncorridor, and all this talk about the dignity of Rome!  Tscharr-rrh!\nThere's more dignity about one gladiator's death than in all Rome\noutside the arena!  Woman, you forget you are only a woman.  I remember\nthat!  I am a god!  I have the blood of Caesar in my veins.  And like\nthe unseen gods, I take my pleasure watching men and women die!  I loose\nmy javelins like thunderbolts--like Jupiter himself!  Like Hercules--\"\n\nHe paused.  He noticed Marcia was laughing.  Only she, in all the Roman\nempire, dared to mock him when he boasted.  Not even she knew why he let\nher do it.  He began to smile again, the frightful frown that rode over\nhis eyes dispersing, leaving his forehead as smooth as marble.\n\n\"If I should marry you and make you empress,\" he said, \"how long do you\nthink I should last after that?  You are clever enough to rule the fools\nwho squawk and jabber in the senate and the Forum. You are beautiful\nenough to start another siege of Troy!  But remember:  You are Caesar's\nconcubine, not empress!  Just remember that, will you!  When I find a\nwoman lovelier than you, and wiser, I will give you and your Christians\na taste of Nero's policy.  Now--do you love me?\"\n\n\"If I did not, could I stand before you and receive these insults?\" she\nretorted, trusting to the inspiration of the moment;  for she had no\nmethod with him.\n\n\"I would willingly die,\" she said, \"if you would give the love you have\nbestowed on me to Rome instead, and use your godlike energy in ruling\nwisely, rather than in killing men and winning chariot races.  One\nMarcia does not matter much.  One Commodus can--\"\n\n\"Can love his Marcia!\" he interrupted, with a high-pitched laugh. He\nseized her, nearly crushing out her breath.  \"A Caius and a Caia we have\nbeen!  By Jupiter, if not for you and Paulus I would have left Rome long\nago to march in Alexander's wake!  I would have carved me a new empire\nthat did not stink so of politicians!\"\n\nHe strode into the anteroom where all the gladiators waited and\nNarcissus had to follow him--well named enough, for he was lithe and\nmuscular and beautiful, but, nonetheless, though taller, not to be\ncompared with Commodus--even as the women, chosen for their good looks\nand intelligence, who hastened to reappear the moment the emperor's back\nwas turned, were nothing like so beautiful as Marcia.\n\nIn all the known world there were no two finer specimens of human\nshapeliness than the tyrant who ruled and the woman whose wits and\ndaring had so long preserved him from his enemies.\n\n\"Come to the arena,\" he called back to her.  \"Come and see how Hercules\nthrows javelins from a chariot at full pelt!\"\n\nBut Marcia did not answer, and he forgot her almost before he reached\nthe entrance of the private tunnel through which he passed to the arena.\nShe had more accurately aimed and nicely balanced work to do than even\nCommodus could do with javelins against a living target.\n\n\n\n\nVII.  MARCIA\n\n\n\nIn everything but title and security of tenure Marcia was empress of the\nworld, and she had what empresses most often lack--the common touch.\nShe had been born in slavery.  She had ascended step by step to fortune,\nby her own wits, learning by experience. Each layer of society was known\nto her--its virtues, prejudices, limitations and peculiar tricks of\nthought.  Being almost incredibly beautiful, she had learned very early\nin life that the desired (not always the desirable) is powerful to sway\nmen;  the possessed begins to lose its sway;  the habit of possession\neasily succumbs to boredom, and then power ceases.  Even Commodus,\naccordingly, had never owned her in the sense that men own slaves;  she\nhad reserved to herself self-mastery, which called for cunning, courage\nand a certain ruthlessness, albeit tempered by a reckless generosity.\n\nShe saw life skeptically, undeceived by the fawning flattery that Rome\nserved up to her, enjoying it as a cat likes being stroked. They said of\nher that she slept with one eye open.\n\nLivius had complained in the Thermae to Pertinax that the wine of\ninfluence was going to Marcia's head, but he merely expressed the\nopinion of one man, who would have liked to feel himself superior to her\nand to use her for his own ends.  She was not deceived by Livius, or by\nanybody else.  She knew that Livius was keeping watch on her, and how he\ndid it, having shrewdly guessed that a present of eight matched litter-\nbearers was too extravagant not to mask ulterior designs.  She watched\nhim much more artfully than he watched her.  Her secret knowledge that\nhe knew her secret was more dangerous to him than anything that he had\nfound out could be dangerous to her.\n\nThe eight matched litter-bearers waited with the gilded litter near a\nflight of marble steps that descended from the door of Marcia's\napartments in the palace to a sunlit garden with a fountain in the\nmidst.  There was a crowd of servants and four Syrian eunuchs, sleek\noffensive menials in yellow robes;  two lictors besides, with fasces and\nthe Roman civic uniform--a scandalous abuse of ancient ceremony--ready\nto conduct a progress through the city.  But they all yawned.  Marcia\nand her usual companion did not come;  there was delay--and gossip,\nnaturally.\n\nA yawning eunuch rearranged the bowknot of his girdle.\n\n\"What does she want with Livius?  He usually gets sent for when somebody\nneeds punishing.  Who do you suppose has fallen foul of her?\"\n\n\"Himself!  He sent her messenger back with word he was engaged on palace\nbusiness.  I heard her tell the slave to go again and not return without\nhim!  Bacchus!  But it wouldn't worry me if Livius should lose his head!\nFor an aristocrat he has more than his share of undignified curiosity--\nforever poking his sharp nose into other people's business.  Marcia may\nhave found him out. Let's hope!\"\n\nAt the foot of the marble stairway, in the hall below Marcia's\napartment, Livius stood remonstrating, growing nervous.  Marcia, dressed\nin the dignified robes of a Roman matron, that concealed even her ankles\nand suggested the demure, self-conscious rectitude of olden times, kept\ntouching his breast with her ivory fan, he flinching from the touch,\nsubduing irritation.\n\n\"If the question is, what I want with you, Livius, the answer is, that I\ninvite you.  Order your litter brought.\"\n\n\"But Marcia, I am subprefect.  I am responsible to--\"\n\n\"Did you hear?\"\n\n\"But if you will tell where we are going, I might feel justified in\nneglecting the palace business.  I assure you I have important work to\ndo.\"\n\n\"There are plenty who can attend to it,\" said Marcia.  \"The most\nimportant thing in your life, Livius, is my good-will.  You are delaying\nme.\"\n\nLivius glared at Caia Poppeia, the lady-in-waiting, who was smiling,\nstanding a little behind Marcia.  He hoped she would take the hint and\nwithdraw out of earshot, but she had had instructions, and came half a\nstep closer.\n\n\"Will you let me go back to my office and--\"\n\n\"No!\" answered Marcia.\n\nHe yielded with a nervous gesture, that implored her not to make an\nindiscretion.  A subprefect, in the nature of his calling, had too many\nenemies to relish repetition in the palace precincts of a threat from\nMarcia, however baseless it might be.  And besides, it might be\nsomething serious that almost had escaped her lips. Untrue or true, it\nwould be known all over the palace in an hour; within the day all Rome\nwould know of it.  There were two slaves by the front door, two more on\nthe last step of the stairs.\n\n\"I will come, of course,\" he said.  \"I am delighted.  I am honored.  I\nam fortunate!\"\n\nShe nodded.  She sent one of her own slaves to order his private litter\nbrought, while Livius attempted to look comfortable, cudgeling his\nbrains to know what mischief she had found out.  It was nothing unusual\nthat his litter should follow hers through the streets of Rome;  in\nfact, it was an honor coveted by all officials of the palace, that fell\nto his share rather frequently because of his distinguished air of a\nlatter-day man of the world and his intimate knowledge of everybody's\nbusiness and ancestry. He was often ordered to go with her at a moment's\nnotice.  But this was the first time she had refused to say where they\nwere going, or why, and there was a hint of malice in her smile that\nmade his blood run cold.  He was a connoisseur of malice.\n\nMarcia leaned on his arm as she went down the steps to her litter.  She\npermitted him to help her in.  But then, while her companion was\nfollowing through the silken curtains, she leaned out at the farther\nside and whispered to the nearest eunuch. Livius, climbing into his own\ngilt vehicle and lifted shoulder-high by eight Numidians, became aware\nthat Marcia's eunuchs had been told to keep an eye on him;  two yellow-\nrobed, insufferably impudent inquisitors strode in among his own\nattendants.\n\nAn escort of twenty praetorian guards and a decurion was waiting at the\ngate to take its place between the lictors and Marcia's litter, but that\ndid not in any way increase Livius' sense of security.  The praetorian\nguard regarded Marcia as the source of its illegal privileges.  It\nlooked to her far more than to the emperor for favors, buying them with\nlawless loyalty to her.  She ruined discipline by her support of every\nplea for increased perquisites.  No outraged citizen had any hope of\nredress so long as Marcia's ear could be reached (although Commodus got\nthe blame for it).  It was the key to Marcia's system of insurance\nagainst unforeseen contingencies.  The only regularly drilled and armed\ntroops in the city were as loyal to her, secretly and openly, as Livius\nhimself was to the principle of cynical self-help.\n\nHe began to feel thoroughly frightened, as he told himself that the\nescort and their decurion would swear to any statement Marcia might\nmake.  If she had learned that he was in the habit of receiving secret\ninformation from her slave, there were a thousand ways she might take to\navenge herself;  a very simple way would be to charge him with improper\novertures and have him killed by the praetorians--a way that might\nparticularly interest her, since it would presumably increase her\nreputation for constancy to Commodus.\n\nThe eunuchs watched him.  The lictors and praetorians cleared the way,\nso there were no convenient halts that could enable him to slip\nunnoticed through the crowd.  His own attendants seemed to have divined\nthat there was something ominous about the journey, and he was not the\nkind of man whose servants are devotedly attached to him.  He knew it.\nHe noticed sullenness already in the answers his servant gave him\nthrough the litter curtains, when he asked whether the man knew their\ndestination.\n\n\"None knows.  All I know is, we must follow Marcia.\"\n\nThe slave's voice was almost patronizing.  Livius made up his mind, if\nhe should live the day out, to sell the rascal to some farmer who would\nteach him with a whip what service meant.  But he said nothing.  He\npreferred to spring surprises, only hoping he himself might not be\noverwhelmed in one.\n\nBy the time they reached Cornificia's house he was in such a state of\nnervousness, and so blanched, that he had to summon his servant into the\nlitter to rub cosmetic on his cheeks.  He took one of Galen's famous\nstrychnine pills before he could prevent his limbs from trembling.  Even\nso, when he rolled out of the litter and advanced with his courtliest\nbow to escort Marcia into the house, she recognized his fear and mocked\nhim:\n\n\"You are bilious?  Or has some handsomer Adonis won your Venus from you?\nIs it jealousy?\"\n\nHe pretended that the litter-bearers needed whipping for having shaken\nhim.  It made him more than ever ill at ease that she should mock him\nbefore all the slaves who grouped themselves in Cornificia's forecourt.\nHers was one of those houses set back from the street, combining an air\nof seclusion with such elegance as could not possibly escape the notice\nof the passer-by.  The forecourt was adorned with statuary and the gate\nleft wide, affording a glimpse of sunlit greenery and marble that\nentirely changed the aspect of the narrow street.  There were never less\nthan twenty tradesmen at the gate, imploring opportunity to show their\nwares, which were in baskets and boxes, with slaves squatting beside\nthem.  All Rome would know within the hour that Marcia had called on\nCornificia, and that Livius, the subprefect, had been mocked by Marcia\nin public.\n\nA small crowd gathered to watch the picturesque ceremony of reception--\nCornificia's house steward marshaling his staff, the brightly colored\ncostumes blending in the sunlight with the hues of flowers and the rich,\nsoft sheen of marble in the shadow of tall cypresses.  The praetorians\nhad to form a cordon in front of the gate, and the street became choked\nby the impeded traffic. Rome loved pageantry;  it filled its eyes before\nits belly, which was nine-tenths of the secret of the Caesar's power.\n\nWithin the house, however, there was almost a stoical calm--a sensation\nof cloistered chastity produced by the restraint of ornament and the\nsubdued light on gloriously painted frescoes representing evening\nbenediction at a temple altar, a gathering of the Muses, sacrifice\nbefore a shrine of Aesculapius and Jason's voyage to Colchis for the\nGolden Fleece.  The inner court, where Cornificia received her guests,\nwas like a sanctuary dedicated to the decencies, its one extravagance\nthe almost ostentatious restfulness, accentuated by the cooing of white\npigeons and the drip and splash of water in the fountain in the midst.\n\nThe dignity of drama was the essence of all Roman ceremony.  The\nformalities of greeting were observed as elegantly, and with far more\nevident sincerity, in Cornificia's house than in Caesar's palace.\nCornificia, dressed in white and wearing very little jewelry, received\nher guests more like an old-time patrician matron than a notorious\nmodern concubine.  Her notoriety, in fact, was due to Flavia Titiana,\nrather than to any indiscretions of her own.  To justify her\ninfidelities, which were a byword, Pertinax' lawful wife went to\ningenious lengths to blacken Cornificia's reputation, regaling all\nsociety with her invented tales about the lewd attractions Cornificia\nstaged to keep Pertinax held in her toils.\n\nThat Cornificia did exercise a sway over the governor of Rome was\nundeniable.  He worshiped her and made no secret of it.  But she held\nhim by a method diametrically contrary to that which rumor, stirred by\nFlavia Titiana, indicated;  Cornificia's house was a place where he\ncould lay aside the feverish activities of public life and revel in the\nintellectual and philosophical amusements that he genuinely loved.\n\nBut Livius loathed her.  Among other things, he suspected her of being\nin league with Marcia to protect the Christians.  To him she represented\nthe idealism that his cynicism bitterly rejected. The mere fact of her\nunshakable fidelity to Pertinax was an offense in his eyes;  she\npresented what he considered an impudent pose of morality, more impudent\nbecause it was sustained.  He might have liked her well enough if she\nhad been a hypocrite, complaisant to himself.\n\nShe understood him perfectly--better, in fact, than she understood\nMarcia, whose visits usually led to intricate entanglements for\nPertinax.  When she had sent the slaves away and they four lay at ease\non couches in the shade of three exotic potted palms, she turned her\nback toward Livius, suspecting he would bring his motives to the surface\nif she gave him time; whereas Marcia would hide hers and employ a dozen\nartifices to make them undiscoverable.\n\n\n\"You have not brought Livius because you think he loves me!\" she said,\nlaughing.  \"Nor have you come, my Marcia, for nothing, since you might\nhave sent for me and saved yourself trouble.  I anticipate intrigue!\nWhat plot have you discovered now?  Is Pertinax its victim?  You can\nalways interest me if you talk of Pertinax.\"\n\n\"We will talk of Livius,\" said Marcia.\n\nLeaning on his elbows, Livius glared at Caia Poppeia, Marcia's\ncompanion.  He coughed, to draw attention to her, but Marcia refused to\ntake the hint.  \"Livius has information for us,\" she remarked.\n\nLivius rose from the couch and came and stood before her, knitting his\nfingers together behind his back, compelling himself to smile.  His\npallor made the hastily applied cosmetics look ridiculous.\n\n\"Marcia,\" he said, \"you make it obvious that you suspect me of some\nindiscretion.\"\n\n\"Never!\" she retorted, mocking.  \"You indiscreet?  Who would believe it?\nGive us an example of discretion;  you are Paris in the presence of\nthree goddesses.  Select your destiny!\"\n\nHe smiled, attempted to regain his normal air of tolerant importance--\nglanced about him--saw the sunlight making iridescent pools of fire\nwithin a crystal ball set on the fountain's edge--took up the ball and\nbrought it to her, holding it in both hands.\n\n\"What choice is there than that which Paris made?\" he asked, kneeling on\none knee, laughing.  \"Venus rules men's hearts.  She must prevail.  So\ninto your most lovely hands I give my destiny.\"\n\n\"You mean, you leave it there!\" said Marcia.  \"Could you ever afford to\nignore me and intrigue behind my back?\"\n\n\"I am the least intriguing person of your acquaintance, Marcia,\" he\nanswered, rising because the hard mosaic pavement hurt his knee, and the\nposition made him feel undignified.  But more than dignity he loved\ndiscretion;  he wished there were eyes in the back of his head, to see\nwhether slaves were watching from the curtained windows opening on the\ninner court.  \"It is my policy,\" he went on, \"to know much and say\nlittle;  to observe much, and do nothing!  I am much too lazy for\nintrigue, which is hard work, judging by what I have seen of those who\nindulge in it.\"\n\n\"Is that why you sacrificed a white bull recently?\" asked Marcia.\n\nLivius glanced at Cornificia, but her patrician face gave no hint.  Caia\nPoppeia's was less under control, for she was younger and had nothing to\nconceal;  she was inquisitively enjoying the entertainment and evidently\ndid not know what was coming.\n\n\"I sacrificed a white bull to Jupiter Capitolinus, as is customary, to\nconfirm a sacred oath,\" he answered.\n\n\"Very well, suppose you break the oath!\" said Marcia.\n\nHe managed to look scandalized--then chuckled foolishly, remembering\nwhat Pertinax had said about the value of an oath; but his own dignity\nobliged him to protest.\n\n\"I am not one of your Christians,\" he answered, stiffening himself.  \"I\nam old-fashioned enough to hold that an oath made at the altar of our\nRoman Jupiter is sacred and inviolable.\"\n\n\"When you took your oath of office you swore to be in all things true to\nCaesar,\" Marcia retorted.  \"Do you prefer to tell Caesar how true you\nhave been to that oath?  Which oath holds the first one or the second?\"\n\n\"I could ask to be released from the second one,\" said Livius. \"If you\nwill give me time--\"\n\nMarcia's laugh interrupted him.  It was soft, melodious, like wavelets\non a calm sea, hinting unseen reefs.\n\n\"Time,\" she said, \"Is all that death needs!  Death does not wait on\noaths;  it comes to us.  I wish to know just how far I can trust you,\nLivius.\"\n\nNine Roman nobles out of ten in Livius' position would have recognized\nat once the deadliness of the alternatives she offered and, preserving\nsomething of the shreds of pride, would have accepted suicide as\npreferable.  Livius had no such stamina.  He seized the other horn of\nthe dilemma.\n\n\"I perceive Pertinax has betrayed me,\" he sneered, looking sharply at\nCornificia;  but she was watching Marcia and did not seem conscious of\nhis glance.  \"If Pertinax has broken his oath, mine no longer binds me.\nThis is the fact then:  I discovered how he helped Sextus, son of\nMaximus, to avoid execution by a ruse, making believe to be killed.\nPertinax was also privy to the execution of an unknown thief in place of\nNorbanus, a friend of Sextus, also implicated in conspiracy.  Pertinax\nhas been secretly negotiating with Sextus ever since.  Sextus now calls\nhimself Maternus and is notorious as a highwayman.\"\n\n\"What else do you know about Maternus?\" Marcia inquired.  There was a\ntrace at last of sharpness in her voice.  A hint conveyed itself that\nshe could summon the praetorians if he did not answer swiftly.\n\n\"He plots against Caesar.\"\n\n\"You know too little or too much!\" said Marcia.  \"What else?\"\n\nHe closed his lips tight.  \"I know nothing else.\"\n\n\"Have you had any dealings with Sextus?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\nHe was shifting now from one foot to the other, hardly noticeably, but\nenough to make Marcia smile.  \"Shall we hear what Sextus has to say to\nthat?\" asked Cornificia, so confidently that there was no doubt Marcia\nhad given her the signal.\n\nMarcia moved her melting, lazy, laughing eyes and Cornificia clapped her\nhands.  A slave came.\n\n\"Bring the astrologer.\"\n\nSextus must have been listening, he appeared so instantly.  He stood\nwith folded arms confronting them, his weathered face in sunlight.\nPigment was not needed to produce the healthy bronze hue of his skin;\nhis curly hair, bound by a fillet, was unruly from the outdoor life he\nhad been leading; the strong sinews of his arms and legs belied the ease\nof his pretended calling and the starry cloak he wore was laughable in\nits failure to disguise the man of action.  He saluted the three women\nwith a gesture of the raised right hand that no man unaccustomed to the\nuse of arms could imitate, then turning slightly toward Livius,\nacknowledged his nod with a humorous grin.\n\n\"So we meet again, Bultius Livius.\"\n\n\"Again?\" asked Marcia.\n\n\"Why yes, I met him in the house of Pertinax.  It is three days since we\nspoke together.  Three, or is it four, Livius?  I have been busy.  I\nforget.\"\n\n\"Can Livius have lied?\" asked Marcia.  She seemed to be enjoying the\nentertainment.\n\nLivius threw caution to the winds.\n\n\"Is this a tribunal?\" he demanded.  \"If so, of what am I accused?\"  He\ntried to speak indignantly, but something caught in his throat.  The\ncough became a sob and in a moment he was half-hysterical.  \"By\nHercules, what judges!  What a witness!  Is he a two-headed witness who\nshall swear my life away?  I understand you, Marcia!\"\n\n(At least two witnesses were necessary under Roman law.)\n\n\"You?\" she laughed.  \"You understand me?\"\n\nHe recovered something of his self-possession, a wave of virility\nreturning.  High living and the feverish excitement of the palace regime\nhad ruined his nerves but there were traces still of his original\nastuteness.  He resumed his air of dignity.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" he said.  \"I have been overworked of late.  I must see\nGalen about this jumpiness.  When I said I understand you I meant, I\nrealize that you are joking.  Naturally you would not receive a\nhighwayman in Cornificia's house, and at the same time accuse me of\ntreason!  Pray excuse my outburst--set it to the score of ill-health.  I\nwill see Galen.\"\n\n\"You shall see him now!\" laughed Marcia, and Cornificia clapped her\nhands.\n\nLess suddenly than Sextus had appeared, because his age was beginning to\ntell on him, Galen entered the court through a door behind the palm-\ntrees and stood smiling, making his old-world, slow salute to Marcia.\nHis bright eyes moved alertly amid wrinkles.  He looked something like\nthe statues of the elder Cato, only with a kindlier humor and less\nobstinacy at the corners of the mouth.  Two slaves brought out a couch\nfor him and vanished when he had taken his ease on it after fussing a\nlittle because the sun was in his eyes.\n\n\"My trade is to oppose death diplomatically,\" he remarked.  \"I am a poor\ndiplomatist.  I only gain a little here and there.  Death wins\ninevitably.  Nevertheless, they only summon me for consultation when\nthey hope to gain a year or two for somebody. Marcia, unless you let\nBultius Livius use that couch he will swoon.  I warn you.  The man's\nheart is weak.  He has more brain than heart,\" he added.  \"How is our\nastrologer?\"\n\nHe greeted Sextus with a wrinkled grin and beckoned him to share his\ncouch.  Sextus sat down and began chafing the old doctor's legs.  Marcia\ntook her time about letting Livius be seated.\n\n\"You heard Galen?\" she asked.  \"We are here to cheat death\ndiplomatically.\"\n\n\"Whose death?\" Livius demanded.\n\n\"Rome's!\" said Marcia, her eyes intently on his face.  \"If Rome should\nsplit in three parts it would fall asunder.  None but Commodus can save\nus from a civil war.  We are here to learn what Bultius Livius can do to\npreserve the life of Commodus.\"\n\nLivius' face, grotesque already with its hastily smeared carmine,\nassumed new bewilderment.\n\n\"I have seen men tortured who were less ready to betray themselves,\"\nsaid Galen.  \"Give him wine--strong wine, that is my advice.\"\n\nBut Marcia preferred her victim thoroughly subjected.\n\n\"Fill your eyes with sunlight, Livius.  Breathe deep!  You look and\nbreathe your last, unless you satisfy me!  This astrologer, who is not\nSextus--mark that!  I have said he is not Sextus. Galen certified to\nSextus' death and there were twenty other witnesses.  Nor is he Maternus\nthe highwayman.  Maternus was crucified.  That other Maternus, who is\nrumored to live in the Aventine Hills, is an imaginary person--a mere\nname used by runaways who take to robbery.  This astrologer, I say,\nreports that you know all the secrets of the factions that are\nseparately plotting to destroy our Commodus.\"\n\nLivius did not answer, although she paused to give him time.\n\n\"You said you understood me, Livius.  But it is I who understand you--\nutterly!  To you any price is satisfactory if your own skin and\nperquisites are safe.  You are as crafty a spy as any rat in the palace\ncellars.  You have kept yourself informed in order to get the pickings\nwhen you see at last which side to take. Careful, very clever of you,\nLivius!  But have you ever seen an eagle rob a fish-hawk of its catch?\"\n\n\"Why waste time?\" Cornificia asked impatiently.  \"He forced himself on\nPertinax, who should have had him murdered, only Pertinax is too\nindifferent to his own--\"\n\n\"Too philosophical!\" corrected Galen.\n\nThen Caia Poppeia spoke up, in a young, hard voice that had none of\nMarcia's honeyed charm.  No doubt of her was possible;  she could be\ncruel for the sake of cruelty and loyal for the sake of pride.  Her\nbeauty was a mere means to an end--the end intrigue, for the\nimpassionate excitement of it.  She was straight-lipped, with a smile\nthat flickered, and a hard light in her blue eyes.\n\n\"It was I who learned you spy on Marcia.  I know, too, that you keep a\nspy in Britain,--one in Gaul, another in Severus' camp.  I read the last\nnine letters they sent you.  I showed them to Marcia.\"\n\n\"I kept one,\" Marcia added.  \"It came yesterday.  It compromises you\nbeyond--\"\n\n\"I yield!\" said Livius, his knees beginning to look weak.\n\n\"To whom?  To me?\" asked Sextus, standing up abruptly and confronting\nhim with folded arms.  \"Who stole the list I sent to Pertinax, of names\nof the important men who are intriguing for Severus, and for Pescennius\nNiger, and for Clodius Albinus?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" Livius shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"None knew of that list but you!\" said Sextus.  \"You heard me speak of\nit to Pertinax.  You heard me promise I would send it to him.  None but\nyou and he and I knew who the messenger would be. Where is the\nmessenger?\"\n\n\"In the sewers probably!\" said Marcia.  \"The list is more important.\"\n\n\"If it isn't in the sewers, too,\" said Livius, snatching at a straw.\n\"By Hercules, I know nothing of a list.\"\n\n\"Then you shall drown with Sextus' slave in the Cloaca Maxima, the great\nsewer of Rome,\" said Marcia.  \"Not that I need the list.  I know what\nnames are written on it.  But if it should have fallen into Caesar's\nhands--\"\n\nShe shuddered, acting horror perfectly, and Livius, like a drowning man\nwho thinks he sees the shore, struck out and sank!\n\n\"You threaten me, but I am no such fool as you imagine!  I know all\nabout you!  I perceive you have crossed your Rubicon.  Well--\"\n\n\"Summon the decurion and two men!\" Marcia interrupted, glancing at\nCornificia.  But she made a gesture with her hand that Cornificia\ninterpreted to mean \"do nothing of the kind!\"\n\nLivius did not see the gesture.  Rage, shame, terror overwhelmed him and\nhe blurted out the information Marcia was seeking--hurled it at her in\nthe form of silly, useless threats:\n\n\"You wanton!  You can kill me but my journal is in safe hands! Harm me--\ncause me to be missing from the palace for a few hours, and they may\nlight your funeral fires!  My journal, with the names of the\nconspirators, and all the details of your daily intriguing, goes\nstraight into Caesar's hands!\"\n\nThe climax he expected failed.  There was no excitement.  Nobody seemed\nastonished.  Marcia settled herself more comfortably on the couch and\nGalen began whispering to Sextus.  The two other women looked amused.\nReaction sweeping over him, his senses reeled and Livius stepped\nbackward, staggering to the fountain, where he sat down.\n\n\"Bona dea!  But the man took time to tell his secret!\" Marcia exclaimed.\n\"Popeia, you had better take my litter to the palace and bring that minx\nCornelia.  I suspected it was she but wasn't sure of it.  Don't give her\nan inkling of what you know.  Go with her to her apartment and watch her\ndress;  then make an excuse to keep her waiting in your room while you\ngo back and search hers. Have help if you need it;  take two of my\neunuchs, but watch that they don't read the journal.  Look under her\nmattress.  Look everywhere.  If you can't find the journal, bring\nCornelia without it.  I will soon make her tell us where it is.\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII.  NARCISSUS\n\n\n\n\"A gladiator's life is not so bad if he behaves himself, and while it\nlasts,\" Narcissus said.\n\nHe was sitting beside Sextus, son of Maximus, in the ergastulum beneath\nthe training school of Bruttius Marius, which was well known to be the\nemperor's establishment, although maintained in the name of a citizen.\nThere was a stone seat at the end where sunlight poured through a barred\nwindow high up in the wall.  To right and left facing a central corridor\nwere cells with doors of latticed iron.  Each cell had its own barred\nwindow, hardly a foot square, set high out of reach and the light,\npiercing the latticed doors, made criss-cross patterns on the white wall\nof the corridor.  Narcissus got up, glanced into each cell and sat down\nagain beside Sextus.\n\n\"The trouble is, they don't,\" he went on.  \"If you let them out, they\ndrink and get into poor condition;  and if you keep them in, they kill\nthemselves unless they're watched.  These men are reserved for Paulus,\nand they know they haven't a chance against him.\"\n\n\"Paulus' luck won't last forever,\" Sextus remarked grimly.\n\n\"No, nor his skill, I suppose.  But he doesn't debauch himself, so he's\nalways in perfect condition.\"\n\n\"Haven't you a man in here who might be made nervy enough to kill him?\"\nSextus asked.  \"They would kill the man himself, of course, directly\nafterward, but we might undertake to enrich his relatives.\"\n\nNarcissus shook his head.\n\n\"One might have a chance with the sword or with the net and trident,\nthough I doubt it.  But Paulus uses a javelin and his aim is like\nlightning.  Only yesterday at practise they loosed eleven lions at him\nfrom eleven directions at the same moment. He slew them with eleven\njavelins, and each one stone dead.  Some of these men saw him do it,\nwhich hasn't encouraged them, I can tell you.  In the second place, they\nknow Paulus is Commodus.  He might just as well go into the arena\nfrankly as the emperor, for all the secret it is.  That substitute who\noccupies the royal pavilion when Commodus himself is in the arena no\nlonger looks very much like him;  he is getting too loose under the\nchin, although a year ago you could hardly tell the two apart.  Even the\nmob knows Paulus is Commodus, although nobody dares to acclaim him\nopenly.  Send a gladiator in against another gladiator and even though\nhe may know that the other man can split a stick at twenty yards, he\nwill do his best.  But let him know he goes against the emperor and he\nhas no nerve to start with;  he can't aim straight;  he suspects his own\nthree javelins and his shield and helmet have been tampered with.  I\nmyself would be afraid to face Paulus, being not much good with the\njavelin in any case, besides being superstitious about killing emperors,\nwho are gods, not men, or the senate and priests wouldn't say so.  It is\nthe same in the races:  setting aside Caesar's skill, which is simply\nphenomenal, the other charioteers are all afraid of him.\"\n\n\"If he isn't killed soon, Severus or one of the others will forestall us\nall,\" said Sextus.  \"Pertinax has only one chance: to be on the throne\nbefore the other candidates know what is happening.\"\n\nNarcissus' bronze face lighted with a sudden smile that rippled all\naround the corners of his mouth, so that he looked like a genial satyr.\n\n\"Speaking of killing,\" he said, \"Marcia has ordered me to kill you the\nmoment you make up your mind the time has come to strike!\"\n\n\"You promised her, of course?\"\n\n\"No, as it happens we were interrupted.  But she relies on me and if she\never begins to suspect me I would rather die in the arena than be racked\nand burned!\"\n\n\"Why not then?  How is this for a proposal?\"  Sextus touched him on the\nshoulder.  \"Substitute yourself and me for two of these men!  Send me in\nagainst him first.  If he kills me, you next. One of us might get him.\nI am lucky.  I believe the gods are interested in me, I have had so many\nescapes from death.\"\n\n\"I haven't much faith in the gods,\" said Narcissus.  \"They may be all\nlike Commodus.  I heard Galen say that men created gods in their own\nimage.\"\n\nSextus smiled at him.\n\n\"You have been listening, I suppose, to Marcia and her Christians.\"\n\n\"Listening, yes, but I don't lean either way.  It doesn't seem to me\nthat Christianity can do much for a man when javelins are in the air.\nAnd besides, to be frank with you, Sextus, I rather hope to make a\nlittle something for myself.  God though he is said to be, I would like\nto see Commodus killed for I loathe him. But I hope to survive him and\nobtain my freedom.  Pertinax would manumit me.  That is why I applied\nfor the post of trainer in this beastly ergastulum.  It is bad enough to\nhave to endure the gloom of men virtually condemned to death and looking\nfor a chance to kill themselves, but it is better than treading the sand\nto have one's liver split, one's throat cut, and be dragged out with the\nhooks.  I have fought many a fight, but I liked each one less than the\nlast.\"\n\nHe got up and strode again along the corridor, glancing into the cells,\nwhere gladiators sat fettered to the wall.\n\n\"This whole business is getting too confused for me,\" he grumbled,\nsitting down again.  \"You want to kill Commodus, as is reasonable.\nMarcia has ordered me to kill you, which is unreasonable!  Yet for the\npresent she protects you.  Why?  She knows you are Commodus' enemy.  She\nseems anxious to save Commodus.  Yet she encourages Pertinax, who\ndoesn't want to be emperor;  he only dallies with the thought because\nMarcia helps Cornificia to persuade him!  Isn't that a confusion for\nyou?  And now there's Bultius Livius.  As I understand it, Marcia caught\nhim spying on her.  No woman in her senses would trust Livius; the man\nhas snowbroth in his veins and slow fire in his head. Yet Marcia now\nheaps favors on him!\"\n\n\"That is my doing,\" said Sextus.\n\n\"Are you mad then, too?\"\n\n\"Maybe!  I have persuaded Marcia that, now she has possession of the\njournal Livius was keeping, she can henceforth hold that over him and\nuse him to advantage.  She can win his gratitude--\"\n\n\"He has none!\"\n\n\"--and at the same time hold over him the threat of exposure for\nconnection with the Severus faction, and the Pescennius faction, and the\nClodius Albinus faction.  He had it all down in his journal.  He can\neasily be involved in those conspiracies if Marcia isn't satisfied with\nhis spying in her behalf.\"\n\n\"Gemini!  The man will break down under the strain.  He has no stamina.\nHe will denounce us all.\"\n\n\"Let us hope so,\" Sextus answered.  \"I am counting on it. Nothing but\nsudden danger will ever bring Pertinax up to the mark!  I gave a bond to\nMarcia for Livius' life.\"\n\n\"Jupiter!  What kind of bond?  And what has come over Marcia that she\naccepted it?\"\n\n\"I guaranteed to her that I will not denounce herself to Commodus!  She\nsaw the point.  She could never clear herself.\"\n\n\"But how could you denounce her?  She can have you seized and silenced\nany time!  Weren't you in Cornificia's house, with the guard at the\ngate?  Why didn't she summon the praetorians and hand you over to them?\"\n\n\"Because Galen was there, too.  She loves him, trusts him, and Galen is\nmy friend.  Besides, Pertinax would turn on her if she should have me\nkilled.  Pertinax was my father's friend, and is mine.  Marcia's only\nchance, if Commodus should lose his life, is for Pertinax to seize the\nthrone and continue to be her friend and protect her.  Any other\npossible successor to Commodus would have her head off in the same\nhour.\"\n\n\"Well, Sextus, that argument won't keep her from having you murdered.  I\nam only hoping she won't order me to do it, because the cat will be out\nof the bag then.  I will not refuse, but I will certainly not kill you,\nand that will mean--\"\n\n\"You forget Norbanus and my freedmen,\" Sextus interrupted.  \"She knows\nvery well that they know all my secrets.  They would avenge me instantly\nby sending Commodus full information of the plot, involving Marcia head\nover heels.  She is ready to betray Commodus if that should seem the\nsafest course.  If she is capable of treachery to him, she is equally\nsure to betray all her friends if she thought her own life were in\ndanger!\"\n\n\"Now listen, Sextus, and don't speak too loud or they'll hear you in the\ncells;  any of these poor devils would jump at a chance to save his own\nskin by betraying you and me.  Talk softly.  I say, listen!  There isn't\nany safety anywhere with all these factions plotting each against the\nother, none knowing which will strike first and Commodus likely to\npounce on all of them at any minute. I don't know why he hasn't heard of\nit already.\"\n\n\"He is too busy training his body to have time to use his brain,\" said\nSextus.  \"However, go on.\"\n\n\"I think Commodus is quite likely to have the best of it!\" Narcissus\nsaid, screwing up his eyes as if he gazed at an antagonist across the\ndazzling sand of the arena.  \"Somebody--some spy--is sure to inform him.\nThere will be wholesale proscriptions.  Commodus will try to scare\nSeverus, Niger and Albinus by slaughtering their supporters here in\nRome.  I can see what is coming.\"\n\n\"Are you, too, a god--like Commodus--that you can see so shrewdly?\"\n\n\"Never mind.  I can see.  And I can see a better way for you, and for me\nalso.  You have made yourself a great name as Maternus, less, possibly,\nin Rome than on the countryside.  You have more to begin with than ever\nSpartacus had--\"\n\n\"Aye, and less, too,\" Sextus interrupted.  \"For I lack his confidence\nthat Rome can be brought to her knees by an army of slaves.  I lack his\nwillingness to try to do it.  Rome must be saved by honorable Romans,\nwho have Rome at heart and not their own personal ambition.  No army of\nrunaway slaves can ever do it. Nothing offends me more than that\nCommodus makes slaves his ministers, and I mean by that no offense to\nyou, Narcissus, who are fit to rank with Spartacus himself.  But I am a\nrepublican. It is not vengeance that I seek.  I will reckon I have lived\nif I have ridded Rome of Commodus and helped to replace him with a man\nwho will restore our ancient liberties.\"\n\n\"Liberties?\"  Narcissus wore his satyr-smile again.  \"It makes small\ndifference to slaves and gladiators how much liberty the free men have!\nThe more for them, the less for us!  Let us live while the living is\ngood, Sextus!  Let us take to the mountains and help ourselves to what\nwe need while Pertinax and all these others fight for too much!  Let\nthem have their too much and grow sick of it!  What do you and I need\nbeyond clothing, a weapon, armor, a girl or two and a safe place for\nretreat?  I have heard Sardinia is wonderful.  But if you still think\nyou would rather haunt your old estates, where you know the people and\nthey know you, so that you will be warned of any attempt to catch you,\nthat will be all right with me.  We can swoop down on the inns along the\nmain roads now and then, rob whom it is convenient to rob, and live like\nnoblemen!\"\n\n\"Three years I have lived an outlaw's life,\" Sextus answered, \"sneaking\ninto Rome to borrow money from my father's friends to save me the\nnecessity of stealing.  It is one thing to pretend to be a robber, and\nanother thing to rob.  The robber's name makes nine men out of ten your\nsecret well-wishers;  the deed makes you all men's enemy.  How do you\nsuppose I have escaped capture?  It was simple enough.  Every robber in\nItaly has called himself Maternus, so that I have seemed to be here,\nthere, everywhere, aye, and often in three or four places at once!  I\nhave been caught and killed at least a dozen times!  But all the while\nmy men and I were safe because we took care to harm nobody.  We let\nothers do the murdering and robbing.  We have lived like hermits,\nshowing ourselves only often enough to keep alive the Maternus legend.\"\n\n\"Well, isn't that better than risking your neck trying to make and\nunmake emperors?\" Narcissus asked.\n\n\"I risk my neck each hour I linger in Rome!\"\n\n\"Well then, by Hercules, take payment for the risk, and cut the risk and\nvanish!\" exclaimed Narcissus.  \"Help yourself once and for all to a bag\nfull of gold in exchange for your father's estates that were confiscated\nwhen they cut his head off.  Then leave Italy, and let us be outlaws in\nSardinia.\"\n\nSextus laughed.\n\n\"That probably sounds glorious to one in your position.  I, too, rather\nenjoyed the prospect when I first made my escape from Antioch and\ndiscovered how easy the life was.  But though I owe it to my father's\nmemory to win back his estates, even that, and present outlawry is small\ncompared to the zeal I have for restoring Rome's ancient liberties.  But\nI don't deceive myself; I am not the man who can accomplish that;  I can\nonly help the one who can, and will.  That one is Pertinax.  He will\nreverse the process that has been going on since Julius Caesar overthrew\nthe old republic.  He will use a Caesar's power to destroy the edifice\nof Caesar and rebuild what Caesar wrecked!\"\n\nNarcissus pondered that, his head between his hands.\n\n\"I haven't Rome at heart,\" he said at last.  \"Why should I have? There\nare girls, whom I have forgotten, whom I loved more than I love Rome.  I\nam a slave gladiator.  I have been applauded by the crowds, but know\nwhat that means, having seen other men go the same route.  I am an\nemperor's favorite, and I know what that means too;  I saw Cleander die;\nI have seen man after man, and woman after woman lose his favor\nsuddenly.  Banishment, death, the ergastulum, torture--and, what is much\nworse, the insults the brute heaps on any one he turns against--I am too\nwise to give that--\" he spat on the flag-stones--\"for the friendship of\nCommodus.  And Commodus is Rome;  you can't persuade me he isn't. Rome\nturns on its favorites as he does--scorns them, insults them, throws\nthem on dung-heaps.  That for Rome!\"  He spat again. \"They even break\nthe noses off the statues of the men they used to idolize!  They even\nthrow the statues on a dung-heap to insult the dead!  Why should I set\nRome above my own convenience?\"\n\n\"Well, for instance, you could almost certainly buy your freedom by\nbetraying me,\" said Sextus.  \"Why don't you?\"\n\n\"Jupiter!  How shall a man answer that?  I suppose I don't betray you\nbecause if I did I should loathe myself.  And I prefer to like myself,\nwhich I contrive to do at intervals.  Also, I enjoy the company of\nhonest men, and I think you are honest, although I think you are also an\nidealist--which, I take it, is the same thing as a born fool, or so I\nhave begun to think, since I attend on the emperor and have to hear so\nmuch talk of philosophy.  Look you what philosophy has made of Commodus!\nDidn't Marcus Aurelius beget him from his own loins, and wasn't Marcus\nAurelius the greatest of all philosophers?  Didn't he surround young\nCommodus with all the learned idealists he could find?  That is what I\nam told he did.  And look at Commodus!  Our Roman Commodus!  God\nCommodus!  I haven't murdered him because I am afraid, and because I\ndon't see how I could gain by it.  I don't betray you because I would\ndespise myself if I did.\"\n\n\"I would despise myself if I should be untrue to Rome,\" Sextus answered\nafter a moment.  \"Commodus is not Rome.  Neither is the mob Rome.\"\n\n\"What is then?\" Narcissus asked.  \"The bricks and mortar?  The marble\nthat the slaves must haul under the lash?  The ponds where they feed\ntheir lampreys on dead gladiators?  The arena where a man salutes a\ndummy emperor before a disguised one kills him? The senate, where they\nbuy and sell the consulates and praetorships and guaestorships?  The\ntribunals where justice goes by privilege?  The temples where as many\ngods as there are, Romans yell for sacrifices to enrich the priests?\nThe farms where the slave-gangs labor like poor old Sysyphus and are\nsold off in their old age to the contractors who clear the latrines, or\nto the galleys, or, if they're lucky, to the lime-kilns where they dry\nup like sticks and die soon?  There is a woman in a side-street near the\nfish-market, who is very rich and looks like Rome to me.  She has so\nmany gold rings on her fingers that you can't see the dirt underneath;\nand she owns so many brothels and wine-shops that she can even buy off\nthe tax-collectors.  Do I love her?  Do I love Rome?  No! I love you,\nSextus, son of Maximus, and I will go with you to the world's end if you\nwill lead the way.\"\n\n\"I love Rome,\" Sextus answered.  \"Possibly I want to see her liberties\nrestored because I love my own liberty and can't imagine myself\nhonorable unless Rome herself is honored first. When you and I are sick\nwe need a Galen.  Rome needs Pertinax. You ask me what is Rome?  She is\nthe cradle of my manhood.\"\n\n\"A befouled nest!\" said Narcissus.\n\n\"An Augean stable with a Hercules who doesn't do his work, I grant you!\nBut we can substitute another Hercules.\"\n\n\"Pertinax is too old,\" Narcissus objected, weakening, a trifle sulkily.\n\n\"He is old enough to wish to die in honor rather than dishonor. You and\nI, Narcissus, have no honor--you a slave and I an outlaw. Let us win,\nthen, honor for ourselves by helping to heal Rome of her dishonor!\"\n\n\"Oh well, have it your own way,\" said Narcissus, unconvinced.  \"A brass\nas for your honor!  The alternative is death or liberty in either case,\nand as for me, I prefer friendship to religion, so I will follow you,\nwhichever road you take.  Now go.  These fellows mustn't recognize you.\nIt is time to take them one by one into the exercising yard.  I daren't\ntake more than one at a time or they'd kill me even with the blunted\npractise-weapons.  I wish they might face Commodus as boldly as they\ntackle me!  I am a weary man, and many times a bruised one, I can tell\nyou, when the night comes, after putting twenty of them through their\npaces.\"\n\n\n\n\nIX.  STEWED EELS\n\n\n\nThe training arena where Commodus worked off energy and kept his\nHerculean muscles in condition was within the palace grounds, but the\ntunnel by which he reached it continued on and downward to the Circus\nMaximus, so that he could attend the public spectacles without much\ndanger of assassination.\n\nNevertheless, a certain danger still existed.  One of his worst frenzies\nof proscription had been started by a man who waited for him in the\ntunnel, and lost his nerve and then, instead of killing him, pretended\nto deliver an insulting message from the senate.  Since that time the\ntunnel had been lined with guards at regular intervals, and when\nCommodus passed through his mysterious \"double\" was obliged to walk in\nfront of him surrounded by enough attendants to make any one not in the\nsecret believe the double was the emperor himself.\n\nNo man in the known world was less incapable than Commodus of self-\ndefense against an armed man.  There was no deception about his feats of\nstrength and skill;  he was undoubtedly the most terrific fighter and\nconsummate athlete Rome had ever seen, and he was as proud of it as Nero\nonce was of his \"golden voice.\" But, as he explained to the fawning\ncourtiers who shouldered one another for a place beside him as he\nhurried down the tunnel:\n\n\"How could Rome replace me?  Yesterday I had to order a slave beaten to\ndeath for breaking a vase of Greek glass.  I can buy a hundred slaves\nfor half what that glass cost Hadrian.  And I could have a thousand\nbetter senators tomorrow than the fools who belch and stammer in the\ncuria, the senate house.  But where would you find another Commodus if\nsome lurking miscreant should stab me from behind?  It was the geese\nthat saved the capitol. You cacklers can preserve your Commodus.\"\n\nThey agreed in chorus, it would be Rome's irreparable loss if he should\ndie, and certain senators, more fertile than the others in expedients\nfor drawing his attention to themselves, paused ostentatiously to hold a\nlittle conversation with the guards and promise them rewards if they\nshould catch a miscreant lurking in wait to attack \"our beloved, our\nglorious emperor.\"\n\nCommodus overheard them, as they meant he should.\n\n\"And such fulsome idiots as those expect me to believe they can frame\nlaws!\"  He scowled over-shoulder.  \"Write down their names for me,\nsomebody.  The senate needs pruning!  I will purge it the way Galen used\nto purge me when I had the colic!  Cioscuri!  But these leaky babblers\nsuffocate me!\"\n\nHe was true to the Caesarian tradition.  He believed himself a god.  He\nmore than half-persuaded other men.  His almost superhuman energy and\nskill with weapons, his terrific storms of anger and his magnetism\noverawed courtiers and politicians as they did the gladiators whom he\nslew in the arena.  The strain of madness in his blood provided cunning\nthat could mask itself beneath a princely bluster of indifference to\nconsequences.  He could fear with an extravagance coequal to the fury of\nhis love of danger, and his fear struck terror into men's hearts, as it\nstirred his mad brain into frenzies.\n\nHe made no false claim when he called Rome the City of Commodus and\nhimself the Roman Hercules.  The vast majority of Romans were unfit to\nchallenge his contempt of them, and his contempt was never under cover\nfor a moment.\n\nDebauchery, of wine and women, entered not at all into his private life\nalthough, in public, he encouraged it in others for the simple reason\nthat it weakened men who otherwise might turn on him.  He was never\nguilty of excesses that might undermine his strength or shake his\nnerves;  there was an almost superhuman purity about his worship of\nathletic powers.  He outdid the Greeks in that respect.  But he allowed\nthe legend of his monstrous orgies in the palace to gain currency,\npartly because that encouraged the Romans to debauch themselves and\nrender themselves incapable of overthrowing him, and partly because it\nhelped to cover up his trick of employing a substitute to occupy the\nroyal pavilion at the games when he himself drove chariots in the races\nor fought in the arena as the gladiator Paulus.\n\nMen who had let wine and women ruin their own nerves knew it was\nimpossible that any one, who lived as Commodus was said to do, could\ndrive a chariot and wield a javelin as Paulus did.  Whoever faced a\nRoman gladiator under the critical gaze of a crowd that knew all the\npoints of fighting and could instantly detect, and did instantly resent\npretense, fraud, trickery, the poor condition of one combatant or the\nunwillingness of one man to have at another in deadly earnest, had to be\nnot only in the pink of bodily condition but a fighter such as no\ndrunken sensualist could ever hope to be.  So it was easy to suppress\nthe scandal that the gladiator Paulus was the emperor himself, although\nhalf Rome half-believed it;  and the substitute who occupied the seat of\nhonor at the games--ageing a little, growing a little pouchy under eyes\nand chin--was pointed to as proof that Commodus was being ruined by the\nlife he led.\n\nThe trick of making use of the same substitute to save the emperor the\nboredom of official ceremony, whenever there was no risk of the public\ncoming close enough to detect the fraud, materially helped to strengthen\nthe officially fostered argument that Commodus could not be Paulus.\n\nSo the mystery of the identity of Paulus was like all court secrets and\nmost secrets of intriguing governments, no mystery at all to hundreds,\nbut to thousands an insoluble conundrum.  The official propagandists of\nthe court news, absolutely in control of all the channels through which\nfacts could reach the public, easily offset the constant leakage from\nthe lips of slaves and gladiators by disseminating artfully concocted\nnews.  Those actually in the secret, flattered by the confidence and\nfearful for their own skins, steadfastly denied the story when it\ncropped up.  Last, but not least, was the law, that made it sacrilege to\nspeak in terms derogatory to the emperor.  A gladiator, though the crowd\nmight almost deify him, was a casteless individual, unprivileged before\nthe law, whom any franchised citizen would rate as socially far beneath\nhimself.  To have identified the emperor with Paulus in a voice above a\nwhisper would have made the culprit liable to death and confiscation of\nhis goods.\n\nThe substitute himself, a man of mystery, was kept in virtual\nimprisonment.  He was known as \"Pavonius Nasor,\" not because that was\nhis real name, which was known to very few people, but because of an old\nlegend that the ghost of a certain Pavonius Nasor, murdered centuries\nago and never buried, still walked in the neighborhood of that part of\nthe palace where the emperor's substitute now led his mysterious, secret\nexistence.\n\nThere were plenty of whispered stories current as to his true identity.\nSome said he was an impoverished landholder whom Commodus had met by\naccident when traveling in Northern Italy. But it was much more commonly\nbelieved he was the emperor's twin brother, spirited away at birth by\nmidwives, and the stories told to account for that were as remarkably\nunlikely as the tale itself;  as for instance, that a soothsayer had\nprophesied how Commodus should one day mount the throne and that he and\nhis twin brother would wreck Rome in civil war--a warning hardly likely\nto have had much weight with the father, Marcus Aurelius, although the\nmother was more likely to have given credence to it.\n\nWhatever the truth of his origin, Pavonius Nasor never ran the risk of\ntelling it.  He kept his sinecure by mastering his tongue, preserving\nalmost bovine speechlessness.  When he and Commodus met face to face he\nnever seemed to see the joke of the resemblance, never laughed at\nCommodus' obscenely vivid jibes at his expense, nor once complained of\nhis anomalous position.  He appeared to be a man of no ambition other\nthan to get through life as easily as might be--of no personal dignity,\nno ruling habits, but possessed of imitative talent that enabled him,\nwithout the slightest trouble, to adopt the very gait and gesture of the\nemperor whom he impersonated.\n\n\nAs he strode ahead along the tunnel he received the guards' salute with\nmerely enough nod of recognition to deceive an onlooker not in the\nsecret.  (It was Pavonius Nasor's half-indulgent, rather lazy smile that\nhad persuaded Rome and even the praetorian guards that Commodus was an\neasy-going, sensual, good humored man.)\n\nThere was a box at one end of the private arena, over the gate where the\nhorses entered, so placed as to avoid the sun's direct rays.  It was\nreached by a short stairway from an anteroom that opened on the tunnel.\nThere was no other means of access to the box.  It's wooden sidewalls,\nfinished to resemble gilded eagle's wings, projected over the arena so\nthat it was well screened and in shadow.  There was none, observing from\nbelow, who could have sworn it had not been the emperor himself who sat\nin the box and watched Paulus the gladiator showing off his skill.\n\nThe assembled gladiators, perfectly aware of Paulus' true identity, went\nthrough the farce of solemnly saluting as the emperor the man who stared\ndown at them from beneath an awning's shadow between golden eagle's\nwings, and who returned the salute with a wave of the arm that all Rome\ncould have recognized.\n\nCommodus, nearly as naked as when he was born, came running from a\ndressing room and pranced and leaped over the sand to bring the sweat-\nbeads to his skin;  then, snatching at the nearest gladiator, wrestled\nwith him until the breathless victim cried for mercy;  dropped him then,\nas crushed as if a python had left a job half-finished, and shouted for\nthe ashen sword-sticks.  In a minute, with a leather buckler on his left\narm, he was parrying the thrusts and blows of six men, driving and so\ncrowding them on one another's toes that only two could seriously answer\nthe terrific flailing of his own ash stick.  He named them, named his\nblow, and laid them one by one, half-stunned and bleeding on the sand,\nuntil the last one by a quick feint landed on him, raising a great\ncrimson welt across his shoulders.\n\n\"Well done!\" Commodus exclaimed and smote him on the skull so fiercely\nthat he broke the sword-stick.  \"You have killed him,\" said a senator as\ntwo men promptly seized the victim's arms to drag him out.\n\n\"Possibly,\" said Commodus.  \"That blow I landed on him would have killed\na horse.  But he is fortunate.  He dies proud--prouder than you ever\nwill, Varronius!  He got past Paulus' guard!  Would you like to attempt\nit?  Woman!  How I loathe you soft, effeminate, sleek senators!  You\nfear death and you fear life equally!  Where is Narcissus?  Where are\nthose men who are to try to kill me at my birthday games?\"\n\nThere was no answer from Narcissus.  Commodus forgot him in a moment,\ncalled for javelins and hurled them at a target, then at half-a-dozen\ntargets, hitting all six marks exactly in the middle as he spun himself\non one heel.\n\n\"I am in fettle!\" he exclaimed, clapping the back of the senator whom he\nhad scurrilously insulted a moment ago.  If he was conscious of applause\nfrom the group of courtiers and gladiators he gave no sign of it.  What\npleased him was his own ability, not their praises.\n\n\"Lions!\" he said.  \"Loose that big one!\"\n\n\"Paulus,\" a scarred veteran answered (they were all forbidden to address\nhim by any other name in that arena), \"you have ordered us to keep that\nfellow for the birthday games.  If you keep killing all the best ones\noff at practise, what shall we do when the day comes?  The last ship-\nload has arrived from Africa and already you have used up nearly half of\nthem.  There is no chance of another cargo arriving in time for the\ngames.  And besides, we have lacked corpses recently;  that big one\nhasn't tasted man's flesh.  He is hungry now.  He will eat whatever we\nthrow in, so let him taste the right meat that will make him savage.\"\n\n\"Loose a leopard then.\"\n\nThe veteran went off without a word to give his orders to the men below-\nground, whose duty it was to drag the cages to the openings of tunnels\nin the masonry through which the animals emerged into the sunlight.\nThere were ten such openings on either side of the arena, closed by\ntrapdoors, set in grooves, that could be raised by ropes from overhead.\n\nCommodus picked up one javelin and poised it.  Half-a-dozen gladiators\nwatched him, paying no attention to the doors, through any one of which\nthe animal might come.  They knew their Paulus, and were trained,\nbesides, to look at death or danger with a curious, contemptuous calm.\nBut the courtiers were nervous, grouping themselves where the sunlight\nthrew a V-shaped shadow on the sand, as if they thought that semi-\ntwilight would protect them.\n\nA wooden door rose squeaking in its grooves but Commodus kept his back\ntoward it.\n\n\"Women!\" he exclaimed.\n\nHis sudden scowl transformed his handsome face into a thing of horror.\nHe began to mutter savagely obscene abuse.  A leopard crept into the\nsunlight, tried to turn again but was prevented by the closing trap, and\ncrouched against the arena wall.\n\n\"Beware!  The beast comes!\" said a gladiator.\n\n\"Hold your presumptuous tongue, you slave-born rascal!\" Commodus\nretorted.  \"Take that yapping dog away and have him whipped!\"\n\nA man stepped from the entrance gate to beckon the offending gladiator,\nwho walked out with a look of hatred on his face.  He paused once,\nhesitating whether to ask mercy, and thought better of it, shrugging his\nfine bronzed shoulders.  The leopard left the wall and crept toward the\ncenter of the sand, his black and yellow beauty rippling in the sunlight\nand his shadow looking like death's trailing cloak.  The courtiers\nseemed doubtful which of the two beasts to watch, leopard or emperor.\n\n\"A spear!\" said Commodus.  A gladiator put it in his hand.\n\n\"Varronius!  It irks me to have cowards in the senate!  Let me see you\ntry to kill that leopard!\"\n\nDecadent and grown effeminate though Rome was, there was no patrician\nwho had not received some training in the use of arms. Varronius took\nthe spear at once, his white hands closing on the shaft with military\nfirmness.  But his white face gave the lie to the alacrity with which he\nstrode out of the shadow.\n\n\"Kill him, and you shall have the consulate next year!\" said Commodus.\n\"Be killed, and there will be one useless bastard less to clutter up the\ncuria!\"\n\nA flush of anger swept over the senator's pale face.  For a moment he\nlooked almost capable of lunging with the spear at Commodus--but\nCommodus was toying with the javelin.  Varronius strode out to face the\nleopard, and the lithe beast did not wait to feel the spear-point.  It\nbegan to stalk its adversary in irregular swift curves.  Its body almost\npressed the sand.  Its eyes were spots of sunlit topaz.  Commodus' frown\nvanished.  He began to gloat over the leopard's subtlety and strength.\n\n\"He is a lovelier thing than you, Varronius!  He is a better fighter!\nHe is manlier!  He is worth more!  He has kept his body stronger and his\nwits more nimble!  He will get you!  By the Dioscuri, he will get you!\nI will bet a talent that he gets you--and I hope he does!  You hold your\nspear the way a woman holds a distaff--but observe the way he gathers\nall his strength in readiness to leap instantly in any direction!  Ah!\"\n\nThe leopard made a feint, perhaps to test the swiftness of the spear-\npoint.  Leaping like a flash of light, he seemed to change direction in\nmid-air, the point missing him by half a hand's breadth.  One terrific\nclaw, outreaching as he turned, ripped open Varronius' tunic and brought\na little stream of crimson trickling down his left arm.\n\n\"Good!\" Commodus remarked.  \"First blood to the braver!  Who would like\nto bet with me?\"\n\n\"I!\" Varronius retorted from between set teeth, his eyes fixed on the\nleopard that had recommenced his swift strategic to-and-fro stalking\nmovement.\n\n\"I have betted you the consulship already.  Who else wants to bet?\"\nasked Commodus.\n\nBefore any one could answer the leopard sprang in again at Varronius,\nwho stepped aside and drove his spear with very well timed accuracy.\nOnly force enough was lacking.  The point slit the leopard's skin and\nmade a stinging wound along the beast's ribs, turning him the way a\nspur-prick turns a horse.  His snarl made Varronius step back another\npace or two, neglecting his chance to attack and drive the spear-point\nhome.  The infuriated leopard watched him for a moment, ears back, tail\nspasmodically twitching, then shot to one side and charged straight at\nthe group of courtiers.\n\nThey scattered.  They were almost unarmed.  There were three of them who\nstumbled, interfering with each other.  The nearest to the leopard drew\na dagger with a jeweled hilt, a mere toy with a light blade hardly\nlonger than his hand.   He threw his toga over his left forearm and\nstood firm to make a fight for it, his white face rigid and his eyes\nablaze.  The leopard leaped--and fell dead, hardly writhing.  Commodus'\nlong javelin had caught him in the middle of his spring, exactly at the\npoint behind the shoulder-bone that leaves a clear course to the heart.\n\n\n\"I would not have done that for a coward, Tullius!  If you had run I\nwould have let him kill you!\"\n\nCommodus strode up and pulled out the javelin, setting one foot on the\nleopard and exerting all his strength.\n\n\"Look here, Varronius.  Do you see how deep my blade went?  Pin-pricks\nare no use against man or animal.  Kill when you strike, like great Jove\nwith his thunderbolts!  Life isn't a game between Maltese kittens;  it's\na spectacle in which the strong devour the weak and all the gods look\non!  Loose another leopard there! I'll show you!\"\n\nHe took the spear from Varronius, balanced it a moment, discarded it and\nchose another, feeling its point with his thumb.  There was a squeak of\npulleys as they loosed a leopard near the end of the arena.  He charged\nthe animal, leaping from foot to foot.  He made prodigious leaps;  there\nwas no guessing which way he would jump next.  He was not like a human\nbeing.  The leopard, snarling, slunk away, attempting to avoid him, but\nhe crowded it against the wall.  He forced it to turn at bay.  No eye\nwas quick enough to see exactly how he killed it, save that he struck\nwhen the leopard sprang.  The next thing that anybody actually saw, he\nhad the writhing creature on the spear, in air, like a legion's\nstandard.\n\nThen the madness surged into his brain.\n\n\"So I rule Rome!\" he exclaimed, and threw the leopard at the gladiators'\nfeet.  \"Because I pity Rome that could not find another Paulus!  I\nstrike first, before they strike me!\"\n\nThey flattered him--fawned on him, but he was much too genuinely mad for\nflattery to take effect.  \"If you were worth a barrelful of rats I'd\nhave a senate that might save me trouble!  Then like Tiberius I might\nremain away from Rome and live more like a god. I've more than half a\nmind to let my dummy stay here to amuse you wastrels!\"  He glanced up at\nthe box, where his substitute lolled and yawned and smiled.  \"All you\ndegenerates need is some one you can rub yourselves against like fat\ncats mewing for a bowl of milk!  By Hercules, now I'll show you\nsomething that will make your blood leap.  Bring out the new Spanish\nteam.\"\n\nWith an imperious gesture he sent senators and gladiators to scatter\nthemselves all over the arena.  Not yet satisfied, he ordered all the\nguards fetched from the tunnel and arranged them in a similar disorder,\nso that finally no stretch of fifty yards was left without a man\nobstructing it.  There was no spina down the midst, nor anything except\nthe surrounding wall to suggest to a team of horses which the course\nmight be.\n\n\"Let none move!\" he commanded.  \"I will crush the foot of any man who\nstirs!\"\n\nAttendants, clinging to the heads of four gray stallions that fought and\nkicked, brought out his chariot and others shut the gate behind it.\nCommodus admired the team a minute, then examined the new high wheels of\nthe gilded chariot, that was hardly wider than a coffin--a thing that a\nman could upset with a shove and built to look as flimsy as an egg\nshell.  Suddenly he seized the reins and leaped in, throwing up his\nright hand.\n\nIf he could have ruled his empire as he drove that chariot he would have\nfar outshone Augustus, for whose memory men sighed. He managed them with\none hand.  There was magnetism sent along the reins to play with the\ndynamic energy of four mad stallions as gods amuse themselves with men.\nIf empire had amused him as athleticism did there would have been no\nequal in all history to Commodus.\n\nIn a chariot no other athlete could have balanced, on a course providing\nnot one unobstructed stretch of fifty yards, he drove like Phoebus\nbreaking in the horses of the Sun, careering this and that way, weaving\npatterns in among the frightened men who stood like posts for him to\ndrive around.  He missed them by a hand's breadth--less!  He took\ndelight in driving at them, turning in the last half-second, smiling at\na blanched face as he wheeled and wove new figures down another zigzag\navenue of men. The frenzy of the team inspired him;  the rebellion of\nthe stallions, made mad by the persistent, sudden turns, aroused his own\nastonishing enthusiasm.  He accomplished the impossible!  He made new\nlaws of motion, breaking them, inventing others!  He became a god in\naction, mastering the team until it had no consciousness of any self-\nwill, or of any impulse but to loose its full strength under the\ndirecting will of genius.\n\nThe team tired first.  It was its waning speed that wearied him at last.\nThe mania that owned him could not tolerate the anticlimax of declining\neffort, so his mood changed.  He became morose--indifferent.  He reined\nin, tossed the reins to an attendant and began to walk toward the tunnel\nentrance, clothed as he was in nothing but the practise loin-cloth of a\ngladiator.\n\nA dozen senators implored him to wait and clothe himself.  He would not\nwait.  He ordered them to bring his cloak and overtake him.  Then he\nobserved Narcissus, standing near the horse-gate, waiting to summon his\ntrained gladiators for an exhibition:\n\n\"Not this time, Narcissus.  Next time.  Follow me.\"  He waited for a\nmoment for Narcissus.  That gave the substitute time to come down from\nthe box and go hurrying ahead into the tunnel-mouth;  he went so fast\n(for he knew the emperor's moods) that the attendants found it hard to\nkeep up;  most of them were half a dozen paces in the rear.  A senator\ngave Commodus his cloak. He took Narcissus by the arm and strode ahead\ninto the tunnel, muttering, ignoring noisy protests from the senators,\nwho warned him that the guards were not yet there.\n\n\nThen there was sudden silence;  possibly a consequence of Caesar's mood,\nor the reaction caused by chill and tunnel-darkness after sunlit sand.\nOr it might have been the shadow of impending tragedy.  A long scream\nbroke the silence, thrice repeated, horrible, like something from an\nunseen world. Instantly Narcissus leaped ahead into the darkness,\nweaponless but armed by nature with the muscles of a panther.  Commodus\nleaped after him;  his mood reversed again.  Now emulation had him;  he\nwould not be beaten to a scene of action by a gladiator. He let his\ncloak fall and a senator tripped over it.\n\nThere were no lamps.  Something less than twilight, deepened here and\nthere by shadow, filled the tunnel.  By a niche intended for a sentry\nthe attendants were standing helplessly around the body of a man who lay\nwith head and shoulders propped against the wall.  Narcissus and\nanother, like knotted snakes, were writhing near by.  There was a sound\nof choking.  Pavonius Nasor was silent.  He appeared already dead.\n\n\"Pluto!  Is there no light?\" Commodus demanded.  \"What has happened?\"\n\n\"They have killed your shadow, sire!\"\n\n\"Who killed him?\"\n\n\"Men who sprang out of the darkness suddenly.\"\n\n\"One man.  Only one.  I have him here.  He lives yet, but he dies!\"\nNarcissus said.\n\nHe dragged a writhing body on the flagstones, holding it by one wrist.\n\n\"He was armed.  I had to throttle him to save my liver from his knife.\nI think I broke his neck.  He is certainly dying,\" said Narcissus.\n\nSome one had gone for a lamp and came along the tunnel with it.\n\n\"Let me look,\" said Commodus.  \"Here, give me that lamp!\"\n\nHe looked first at Pavonius Nasor, who gazed back, at him with stupid,\npassionless, already dimming eyes.  A stream of blood was gushing from\nbelow his left arm.\n\n\"Now the gods of heaven and hell, and all the strange gods that have no\nresting place, and all the spirits of the air and earth and sea, defile\nyour spirit!\" Commodus exploded.  \"Careless, irresponsible, ungrateful\nfool!  You have deprived me of my liberty!  You let yourself be killed\nlike any sow under the butcher's knife, and dare to leave me shadowless?\nThen die like carrion and rot unburied!\"\n\nHe began to kick him, but the stricken man's lips moved. Commodus bent\ndown and tried to   listen--tried again, mastered impatience and at last\nstood upright, shaking both fists at the tunnel roof.\n\n\"Omnipotent Progenitor of Lightnings!\" he exploded.  \"He says he should\nhave had stewed eels tonight!\"\n\nThe watching senators mistook that for a cue to laugh.  Their laughter\ntouched off all the magazines of Caesar's rage.  He turned into a mania.\nHe tore at his own hair.  He tore off his loin-cloth and stood naked.\nHe tried to kill Narcissus, because Narcissus was the nearest to him.\nHis crashing centurion's parade voice filled the tunnel.\n\n\"Dogs!  Dogs' ullage!  Vipers!\" he yelled.  \"Who slew my shadow? Who did\nit?  This is a conspiracy!  Who hatched it?  Bring my tablets!  Warn the\nexecutioners!  What is Commodus without his dummy?  Vultures!  Better\nhave killed me than that poor obliging fool!  You cursed, stupid idiots!\nYou have killed my dummy!  I must sit as he did and look on.  I must\nswallow stinking air of throne-rooms.  I must watch sluggards fight--you\nmiserable, wanton imbeciles!  It is Paulus you have killed!  Do you\nappreciate that?  Jupiter, but I will make Rome pay for this! Who did\nit?  Who did it, I say?\"\n\nRage blinded him.  He did not see the choking wretch whose wrist\nNarcissus twisted, until he struck at Narcissus again and, trying to\nfollow him, stumbled over the assassin.\n\n\"Who is this?  Give me a sword, somebody!  Is this the murderer? Bring\nthat lamp here!\"\n\nBolder than the others, having recently been praised, the senator\nTullius brought the lamp and, kneeling, held it near the culprit's face.\nThe murderer was beyond speech, hardly breathing, with his eyes half-\nbursting from the sockets and his tongue thrust forward through his\nteeth because Narcissus' thumbs had almost strangled him.\n\n\"A Christian,\" said Tullius.\n\nThere was a note of quiet exultation in his voice.  The privileges of\nthe Christians were a sore point with the majority of senators.\n\n\"A what?\" demanded Commodus.\n\n\"A Christian.  See--he has a cross and a fish engraved on bone and wears\nit hung from his neck beneath his tunic.  Besides, I think I recognize\nthe man.  I think he is the one who waylaid Pertinax the other day and\nspoke strange stuff about a whore on seven hills whose days are\nnumbered.\"\n\nHe had raised up the man's head by the hair.  Commodus stamped on the\nface with the flat of his sandal, crushing the head on the flagstones.\n\n\"Christian!\" he shouted.  \"Is this Marcia's doing?  Is this Marcia's\nexpedient to keep me out of the arena?  Too long have I endured that\nrabble!  I will rid Rome of the brood!  They kill the shadow--they shall\nfeel the substance!\"\n\nSuddenly he turned on his attendants--pointed at the murderer and his\nvictim:\n\n\"Throw those two into the sewer!  Strip them--strip them now--let none\nidentify them.  Seize those spineless fools who let the murder happen.\nTie them.  You, Narcissus--march them back to the arena.  Have them\nthrown into the lions' cages.  Stay there and see it done, then come and\ntell me.\"\n\nThe courtiers backed away from him as far out of the circle of the\nlamplight as the tunnel-wall would let them.  He had snatched the lamp\nfrom Tullius.  He held it high.\n\n\"Two parts of me are dead;  the shadow that was satisfied with eels for\nsupper and the immortal Paulus whom an empire worshiped. Remains me--the\nthird part--Commodus!  You shall regret those two dead parts of me!\"\n\nHe hurled the lighted lamp into the midst of them and smashed it, then,\nin darkness, strode along the tunnel muttering and cursing as he went--\nstark naked.\n\n\n\n\nX.  \"ROME IS TOO MUCH RULED BY WOMEN!\"\n\n\n\n\"He is in the bath,\" said Marcia.  She and Galen were alone with\nPertinax, who looked splendid in his official toga.  She was herself in\ndisarray.  Her woman had tried to dress her hair on the way in the\nlitter;  one long coil of it was tumbling on her shoulder.  She looked\nalmost drunken.\n\n\"Where is Flavia Titiana?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Out,\" said Pertinax and shut his lips.  He never let himself discuss\nhis wife's activities.  The peasant in him, and the orthodox grammarian,\npreferred less scandalous subjects.\n\nMarcia stared long at him, her liquid, lazy eyes, suggesting banked\nfires in their depths, looking for signs of spirit that should rise to\nthe occasion.  But Pertinax preferred to choose his own occasions.\n\n\"Commodus is in the bath,\" Marcia repeated.  \"He will stay there until\nnight comes.  He is sulking.  He has his tablets with him--writes and\nwrites, then scratches out.  He has shown what he writes to nobody, but\nhe has sent for Livius.\"\n\n\"We should have killed that dog,\" said Pertinax, which brought a sudden\nlaugh from Galen.\n\n\"A dog's death never saved an empire,\" Galen volunteered.  \"If you had\nmurdered Livius the crisis would have come a few days sooner, that is\nall.\"\n\n\"It is the crisis.  It has come,\" said Marcia.  \"Commodus came storming\ninto my apartment, and I thought he meant to kill me with his own hands.\nUsually I am not afraid of him.  This time he turned my strength to\nwater.  He yelled 'Christians!' at me, 'Christians!  You and your\nChristians!'  He was unbathed.  He was half-naked.  He was sweaty from\nhis exercise.  His hair was ruffled;  he had torn out some of it.  His\nscowl was frightful--it was freezing.\"\n\n\"He is quite mad,\" Galen commented.\n\n\"I tried to make him understand this could not be a plot or I would\ncertainly have heard of it,\" Marcia went on with suppressed excitement.\n\"I said it was the madness of one fanatic, that nobody could foresee.\nHe wouldn't listen.  He out-roared me.  He even raised his fist to\nstrike.  He swore it was another of my plans to keep him out of the\narena.  I began to think it might be wiser to admit that.  Even in his\nworst moods he is sometimes softened by the thought that I take care of\nhim and love him enough to risk his anger.  But not this time!  He flew\ninto the worst passion I have ever seen.  He returned to his first\nobsession, that the Christians plotted it and that I knew all about it.\nHe swore he will butcher the Christians.  He will rid Rome of them.  He\nsays, since he can not play Paulus any longer he will out-play Nero.\"\n\n\"Where is Sextus?\" Pertinax asked.\n\n\"Aye! Where is Sextus!\"\n\nMarcia glared at Galen.\n\n\"We have to thank you for Sextus!  You persuaded Pertinax to shield\nSextus.  Pertinax persuaded me.\"\n\n\"You did it!\" Galen answered dryly.  \"It is what we do that matters.\nSquealing like a pig under a gate won't remedy the matter.  You foresaw\nthe crisis long ago.  Sextus has been very useful to you.  He has kept\nyou informed, so don't lower yourself by turning on him now.  What is\nthe latest news about the other factions?\"\n\nMarcia restrained herself, biting her lip.  She loved old Galen, but she\ndid not relish being told the whole responsibility was hers, although\nshe knew it.\n\n\"There is no news,\" she answered.  \"Nobody has heard a word about the\nmurder yet.  Commodus has had the bodies thrown into the sewer.  But\nthere are spies in the palace--\"\n\n\"To say nothing of Bultius Livius,\" Pertinax added.  He was clicking the\nrings on his fingers--symptom of irresolution that made Marcia grit her\nteeth.\n\n\"The other factions are watching one another,\" Marcia went on. \"They are\nirresolute because they have no leader near enough to Rome to strike\nwithout warning.  Why are you irresolute?\"  She looked so hard at\nPertinax that he got up and began to pace the floor.  \"Severus and his\ntroops are in Pannonia.  Pescennius Niger is in Syria.  Clodius Albinus\nis in Britain.  The senators are all so jealous and afraid for their own\nskins that they are as likely as not to betray one another to Commodus\nthe minute they learn that a crisis exists.  If they hear that Commodus\nis writing out proscription lists they will vie with one another to\ndenounce their own pet enemies--including you--and me!\" she added.\n\n\"There is one chance yet,\" said Pertinax.  \"Bultius Livius may have\nenough wisdom to denounce the leaders of the other factions and to clear\nus.  None of the others would be grateful to him. That Carthaginian\nSeverus, for instance, is invariably spiteful to the men who do him\nfavors.  Bultius Livius may see that to protect us is his safest course,\nas well as best for Rome.\"\n\nHe had more to say, but Marcia's scorn interrupted him.  Galen chuckled.\n\n\"Rome!  He cares only for Bultius Livius.  It is now or never,\nPertinax!\"\n\nMarcia's intense emotion made her appear icily indifferent, but she did\nnot deceive Galen, although Pertinax welcomed her calmness as excusing\nunenthusiasm in herself.\n\n\"Marcia is right,\" said Galen.  \"It is now or never.  Marcia ought to\nknow Commodus!\"\n\n\"Know him?\" she exploded.  \"I can tell you step by step what he will do!\nHe will come out of the bath and eat a light meal, but he will drink\nnothing, for fear of poison.  Presently he will be thirsty and lonely,\nand will send for me;  and whatever he feels, he will pretend he loves\nme.  When the raging fear is on him he will never drink from any one but\nme.  He will take a cup of wine from my hands, making me taste it first.\nThen he will go alone into his own room, where only that child\nTelamonion will dare to follow.  Everything depends then on the child.\nIf the child should happen to amuse him he will turn sentimental and I\nwill dare to go in and talk to him.  If not--\"\n\nGalen interrupted.\n\n\"Madness,\" he said, \"resembles many other maladies, there being symptoms\nfrequently for many years before the slow fire bursts into a blaze.\nSome die before the outbreak, being burned up by the generating process,\nwhich is like a slow fire.  But if they survive until the explosion, it\nis more violent the longer it has been delayed.  And in the case of\nCommodus that means that other men will die.  And women,\" he added,\nlooking straight at Marcia.\n\n\"If he even pretends he loves me--I am a woman,\" said Marcia.  \"I love\nhim in spite of his frenzies.  If I only had myself to think of--\"\n\n\"Think then!\" Galen interrupted.  \"If you can't think for yourself, do\nyou expect to benefit the world by thinking?\"\n\nMarcia buried her face in her hands and lay face downward on the couch.\nShe was trembling in a struggle for self-mastery. Pertinax chewed at his\nfinger-nails, which were the everlasting subject of his proud wife's\nindignation;  he never kept his fine hands properly;  the peasant in him\nthought such refinements effeminate, unsoldierly.  Cornificia, who could\nhave made him submit even to a manicure, understood him too well to\ninsist.\n\n\"Galen!\" said Marcia, sitting up suddenly.\n\nThe old man blinked.  He recognized decision sudden and irrevocable.  He\nclenched his fingers and his lower lip came forward by the fraction of\nan inch.\n\n\"I must save my Christians.  What do you know about poisons?\" she\ndemanded.\n\n\"Less than many people,\" Galen answered.  \"I have studied antidotes.  I\nam a doctor.  Those I poisoned thought as I did, that I gave them\nsomething for their health.  My methods have changed with experience.\nDoctoring is like statesmanship--which is to say, groping in the dark\nthrough mazes of misinformation.\"\n\n\"Know you a poison,\" asked Marcia, \"that will not harm one who merely\ntastes it, but will kill whoever drinks a quantity? Something without\nflavor?  Something colorless that can be mixed with wine?  Know you a\nsafe poison, Galen?\"\n\n\"Aye--irresolution!\" Galen answered.  \"I will not be made a victim of\nit.  Who shall aspire to the throne if Commodus dies?\"\n\n\"Pertinax!\"\n\nPertinax looked startled, stroking his beard, uncrossing his knees.\n\n\"Then let Pertinax do his own work,\" said Galen.  \"Rome is full of\npoisoners, but hasn't Pertinax a sword?\"\n\n\"Aye.  And it has been the emperor's until this minute,\" Pertinax said\ngrimly.  \"Galen tells us Commodus is mad.  And I agree that Rome\ndeserves a better emperor.  But whether I am fit to be that emperor is\nsomething not yet clear to me.  I doubt it.  Whom the Fates select for\nsuch a purpose, they compel, and he is unwise who resists them.  I will\nnot resist.  But let there be no doubt on this point:  I will not slay\nCommodus.  I will not draw sword against the man to whom I owe my\nfortune.  I am not an ingrate. Sextus lives for his revenge.  If you\nshould ask me I would answer, Sextus planned this murder in the tunnel\nand the blow was meant for Commodus himself.  I am inclined to deal with\nSextus firmly.  It is not too late.  There is a chance that Commodus,\ndeprived now of his opportunities to make himself a spectacle, may bend\nhis energies to government.  Madman though he is, he is the emperor, and\nif he is disposed now to govern well, with capable advisers, I would be\nthe last to turn on him.\"\n\n\"If he will be advised by you?\" suggested Marcia, her accent tart with\nsarcasm.  \"What will you advise him about Sextus?\"\n\n\"There are plenty of ways of getting rid of Sextus without killing him,\"\nsaid Pertinax.  \"He is a young man needing outlets for his energy and\nfuel for his pride.  If he were sent to Parthia, in secret, as an agent\nauthorized to penetrate that country and report on military,\ngeographical and economic facts--\"\n\n\"He would refuse to go!\" said Galen.  \"And if made to go, he would\nreturn!  O Pertinax--!\"\n\n\"Be quiet!\" Pertinax retorted irritably.  \"I will not submit to being\nlectured.  I am Governor of Rome--though you are Galen the philosopher.\nAnd I remember many of your adages this minute, as for instance:  'It is\nhe who acts who is responsible.'  To kill an emperor is easy, Galen.  To\nreplace him is as difficult as to fit a new head to a body.  We have\ntalked a lot of treason, most of it nonsense.  I have listened to too\nmuch of it.  I am as guilty as the others.  But when it comes to slaying\nCommodus and standing in his shoes--\"\n\nMarcia interrupted.\n\n\"By the great Twin Brethren, Pertinax!  Who can be surprised that Flavia\nTitiana seeks amusement in the arms of other men!  Does Cornificia\nendure such peasant talk?  Or do you keep it to impose on us as a relief\nfrom her more noble conversation?  Dea Dia! Had I known how spineless\nyou can be I would have set my cap at Lucius Severus long ago.  It may\nbe it is not too late.\"\n\nShe had him!  She had pricked him in the one place where he could be\nstirred to spitefulness.  His whole face crimsoned suddenly.\n\n\"That Carthaginian!\"  He came and stood in front of her.  \"If you had\nfavored him you should have foregone my friendship, Marcia! Commodus is\nbad enough.  Severus would be ten times worse!  Where Commodus is merely\ncrazy, Lucius Severus is a calculating, ice-cold monster of cruelty!  He\nhas no emotions except those aroused by venom!  He would tear out your\nheart just as swiftly as mine! As for plotting with him, he would let\nyou do it all and then denounce you to the senate after he was on the\nthrone!\"\n\n\"Either it must be Severus, or else you!\" said Marcia.  \"Which is it to\nbe?\"\n\nPertinax folded his arms.\n\n\"I would feel it my duty to preserve Rome from Severus.  But you go too\nfast.  Our Commodus is on the throne--\"\n\n\"And writes proscription lists!\" said Marcia.  \"Who knows what names are\non the lists already?  Who knows what Bultius Livius may have told him?\nWho knows which of us will be alive tomorrow morning?  Who knows what\nSextus is doing?  If Sextus has heard of this crisis he will seize the\nmoment and either arouse the praetorian guard to mutiny or else reach\nCommodus himself and slay him with his own hand! Sextus is a man!  Are\nyou no more than Flavia Titiana's cuckold and Cornificia's plaything?\"\n\n\"I am a Roman,\" Pertinax retorted angrily.  \"I think of Rome before\nmyself.  You women only think of passion and ambition. Rome--city of a\nthousand triumphs!\"  He turned away, pacing the floor again, knitting\nhis fingers behind him.  \"Pertinax would offer up himself if he might\nbring back the Augustan days--if he might win the warfare that Tiberius\nlost.  One Pertinax is nothing in the life of Rome.  One life, three-\nquarters spent, is but a poor pledge to the gods--yet too much to be\nthrown away in vain.  The auguries are all mixed nowadays.  I doubt\nthem.  I mistrust the shaven priests who dole out answers in return for\nminted money.  I have knelt before the holy shrine of Vesta, but the\nVirgins were as vague as the Egyptian who prophesied--\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"What?\" demanded Marcia.\n\n\"That I should serve Rome and receive ingratitude.  What else does any\nman receive who serves Rome?  They who cheat her are the ones who\nprosper!\"\n\n\"Send for Cornificia,\" said Marcia.  \"She keeps your resolution. Let her\ncome and loose it!\"  Pertinax turned sharply on her.\n\n\"Flavia Titiana shall not suffer that indignity.  Cornificia can not\nenter this house.\"\n\nBut the mention of Cornificia's name wrought just as swift a change in\nhim as had the name of Lucius Severus.  He began to bite his finger-\nnails, then clenched his hands again behind him, Galen and Marcia\nwatching.\n\n\"You are the only one who can replace Commodus without drenching Rome in\nblood,\" said Marcia, remembering a phrase of Cornificia's.  And since\nthe words were Cornificia's, and stirred the chords of many memories,\nthey produced a sort of half-way resolution.\n\n\"It is now or never,\" Marcia said, goading him.  But Pertinax shook his\nhead.\n\n\"I am not convinced, though I would do my best to save Rome from\nSeverus.  Dioscuri!--do you realize, this plot to make me emperor is\nknown to not more than a dozen--\"\n\n\"Therein safety lies,\" said Marcia.  \"Yourself included there can only\nbe a dozen traitors!\"\n\n\"Rome is too much ruled by women!  I will not kill Commodus, and I will\ngive him this one chance,\" said Pertinax.  \"I will protect him, unless\nand until I shall discover proof that he intends to turn on you, or me,\nor any of my friends.\"\n\n\"You may discover that too late!\" said Marcia;  but she seemed to\nunderstand him and looked satisfied.  \"Come tonight to the palace--\nGalen,\" she added, \"come you also--and bring poison!\"\n\nGalen met her gaze and shut his lips tight.\n\n\"Galen,\" she said, \"either you will do this or--I have been your friend.\nNow be you mine!  It is too risky to send one of my slaves to fetch a\npoison.  You are to come tonight and bring the poison with you.\nOtherwise--you understand?\"\n\n\"You are extremely comprehensible!\" said Galen, pursing up his lips.\n\n\"You will obey?\"\n\n\"I must,\" said Galen.  But he did not say whether he would obey her or\nhis inclination.  Pertinax, eyeing him doubtfully, seemed torn between\nsuspicion of him and respect for long-tried friendship.\n\n\"May we depend on you?\" he asked.  He laid a hand on Galen's shoulder,\nbending over him.\n\n\"I am an old man,\" Galen answered.  \"In any event I have not long to\nlive.  I will do my best--for you.\"\n\nPertinax nodded, but there was still a question in his mind.  He bade\nfarewell to Marcia, turning his back toward Galen.  Marcia whispered:\n\n\"Be a man now, Pertinax!  If we should lose this main, we two can drink\nthe stuff that Galen brings.\"\n\n\"There was a falling star last night,\" said Pertinax.  \"Whose was it?\"\n\nMarcia studied his face a moment.  Then:\n\n\"There will be a rising sun tomorrow!\" she retorted.  \"Whose will it be?\nYours!  Play the man!\"\n\n\n\n\nXI.  GALEN\n\n\n\nGalen's house was one he rented from a freedman of the emperor--a wise\nmeans of retaining favor at the palace.  Landlords having influence were\ncareful to protect good tenants.  Furthermore, whoever rented, rather\nthan possessed, escaped more easily from persecution.  Galen, like\nTyanan Apollonius, reduced his private needs, maintaining that\nphilosophy went hand in hand with medicine, but wealth with neither.\n\nIt was a pleasant little house, not far away from Cornificia's, within a\nprecinct that was rebuilt after all that part of Rome burned under\nNero's fascinated gaze.  The street was crescent-shaped, not often\ncrowded, though a score of passages like wheel-spokes led to it;  and to\nthe rear of Galen's house was a veritable maze of alleys.  There were\ntwo gates to the house: one wide, with decorated posts, that faced the\ncrescent street, where Galen's oldest slave sat on a stool and blinked\nat passers-by;  the other narrow, leading from a little high-walled\ncourtyard at the rear into an alley between stables in which milch-asses\nwere kept.  That alley led into another where a dozen midwives had their\nnames and claims to excellency painted on the doors--an alley carefully\nto be avoided, because women of that trade, like barbers, vied for\ncustom by disseminating gossip.\n\nSo Sextus used a passage running parallel to that one, leading between\nworkshops where the burial-urn makers' slaves engraved untruthful\nepitaphs in baked clay or inlaid them on the marble tomb-slabs--to be\ngilded presently with gold-leaf (since a gilded lie, though costlier, is\nno worse than the same lie unadorned.)\n\nHe drummed a signal with his knuckles on the panel of a narrow door of\nolive-wood, set deep into the wall under a projecting arch.  An\noverleaning tree increased the shadow, and a visitor could wait without\nattracting notice.  A slave nearly as old as Galen presently admitted\nhim into a paved yard in which a fish-pond had been built around an\nancient well.  A few old fruit-trees grew against the wall, and there\nwere potted shrubs, but little evidence of gardening, most of Galen's\nslaves being too old for that kind of work.  There were a dozen of them\nloafing in the yard;  some were so fat that they wheezed, and some so\nthin with age that they resembled skeletons.  There was a rumor that the\nfatness and the thinness were accounted for by Galen's fondness for\nexperiments.  Old Galen had a hundred jealous rivals and they even said\nhe fed the dead slaves to the fish;  but it was Roman custom to give no\nman credit for humaneness if an unclean accusation could be made to\nstick.\n\nAnother fat old slave led Sextus to a porch behind the house and through\nthat to a library extremely bare of furniture but lined with shelves on\nwhich rolled manuscripts were stacked in tagged and numbered order;\nthey were dusty, as if Galen used them very little nowadays.  There were\ntwo doors in addition to the one that opened on the porch;  the old\nslave pointed to the smaller one and Sextus, stooping and turning\nsidewise because of the narrowness between the posts, went down a step\nand entered without knocking.\n\nFor a moment he could not see Galen, there was such confusion of shadow\nand light.  High shelves around the walls of a long, shed-like room were\ncrowded with retorts and phials.  An enormous, dusty human skeleton,\narticulated on concealed wire, moved as if annoyed by the intrusion.\nThere were many kinds of skulls of animals and men on brackets fastened\nto the wall, and there were jars containing dead things soaked in\nspirit.  Some of the jars were enormous, having once held olive oil.  On\na table down the midst were instruments, a scale for weighing chemicals,\nsome measures and a charcoal furnace with a blow-pipe;  and across the\nwhole of one end of the room was a system of wooden pigeon-holes,\nstacked with chemicals and herbs, for the most part wrapped in\nparchment.\n\nSunlight streaming through narrow windows amid dust of drugs and spices\nmade a moving mystery;  the room seemed under water. Galen, stooping\nover a crucible with an unrolled parchment on the table within reach,\nwas not distinguishable until he moved;  when he ceased moving he faded\nout again, and Sextus had to go and stand where he could touch him, to\nbelieve that he was really there.\n\n\"You told me you had ceased experiments.\"\n\n\"I lied.  The universe is an experiment,\" said Galen.  \"Such gods as\nthere are perhaps are looking to evolve a decent man, or possibly a\nwoman, from the mess we see around us.  Let us hope they fail.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"There appears to be hope in failure.  Should the gods fail, they will\nstill be gods and go on trying.  If they ever made a decent man or woman\nall the rest of us would turn on their creation and destroy it.  Then\nthe gods would turn into devils and destroy us.\"\n\n\"What has happened to you, Galen?  Why the bitter mood?\"\n\n\"I discover I am like the rest of you--like all Rome.  At my age such a\ndiscovery makes for bitterness.\"  For a minute or two Galen went on\nscraping powder from the crucible, then suddenly he looked up at Sextus,\nstepping backward so as to see the young man's face more clearly in a\nshaft of sunlight.\n\n\"Did you send that Christian into the tunnel to kill Commodus?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"I?  You know me better than that, Galen!  When the time comes to slay\nCommodus--but is Commodus dead?  Speak, don't stand there looking at me!\nSpeak, man!\"\n\nGalen appeared satisfied.\n\n\"No, not Commodus.  The blow miscarried.  Somebody slew Nasor.  A\nmistake.  A coward's blow.  If you had been responsible--\"\n\n\"When--if--I slay, it shall be openly with my own hand,\" said Sextus.\n\"Not I alone, but Rome herself must vomit out that monster.  Why are you\nvexed?\"\n\n\"That wanton blow that missed its mark has stripped some friends of mine\ntoo naked.  It has also stripped me and revealed me to myself.  Last\nnight I saw a falling star--a meteor that blazed out of the night and\nvanished.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" said Sextus.  \"All Rome saw it.  The cheap sorcerers are doing\na fine trade.  They declare it portends evil.\"\n\n\"Evil--but for whom?\"  Old Galen poured the powder he had scraped into a\ndish and blinked at him.  \"Affiliations in the realm of substance are\nconfined to like ingredients.  That law is universal.  Like seeks like,\nbegetting its own like.  As for instance, sickness flows in channels of\nunwholesomeness, like water seeping through a marsh.  Evil?  What is\nevil but the likeness of a deed--its echo--its result--its aftermath?\nYou see this powder?  Marcia has ordered me to poison Commodus!  What\nkind of aftermath should that deed have?\"\n\nSextus stared at him astonished.  Galen went on mixing.\n\n\"Colorless it must be--flavorless--without smell--indetectible. These\nsaviors of Rome prepare too much to save themselves!  And I take trouble\nto save myself.  Why?\"\n\nHe stopped and blinked again at Sextus, waiting for an answer.\n\n\"You are worth preserving, Galen.\"\n\n\"I dispute that.  I am sentimental, which is idiocy in a man of my age.\nBut I will not kill him who is superior to any man in Rome.\"\n\n\"Idiocy?  You?  And you admire that monster?\"\n\n\"As a monster, yes.  He is at least wholehearted.  As a monster he lacks\nneither strength of will nor sinew nor good looks;  he is magnificent;\nhe has the fear, the frenzy and the resolution of a splendid animal.  We\nhave only cowardice, the unenthusiasm and the indecision of base men.\nIf we had the virtue of Commodus, no Commodus could ever have ruled Rome\nfor half a day. But I am senile.  I am sentimental.  Rather than betray\nMarcia--and Pertinax--who would betray me for their own sakes;  rather\nthan submit my own old carcass to the slave whom Marcia would send to\nkill me, I am doing what you see.\"\n\n\"Poison for Commodus?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Not for yourself, Galen?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"For whom then?\"\n\n\"For Pertinax.\"\n\nSextus seized the plate on which the several ingredients were being\nmixed.\n\n\"Put that down,\" said Galen.  \"I will poison part of him--the mean\npart.\"\n\n\"Speak in plain words, Galen!\"\n\n\"I will slay his indecision.  He and Marcia propose;  that I shall kill\ntheir monster.  I shall mix a draught for Marcia to take to him--in case\nthis, and in case that, and perhaps.  In plain words, Commodus has sent\nfor Livius and none knows how much Livius has told.  Their monster\nwrites and scratches out and rewrites long proscription lists, and\nMarcia trembles for her Christians.  For herself she does not tremble.\nShe has ten times Pertinax' ability to rule.  If Marcia were a man she\nshould be emperor!  Our Pertinax is hesitating between inertia and doubt\nand dread of Cornificia's ambition for him;  between admiration of his\nown wife and contempt for her;  between the subtleties of auguries and\ncommon sense;  between trust and mistrust of us all, including Marcia\nand you and me;  between the easy dignity of being governor of Rome and\nthe uneasy palace--slavery of being Caesar;  between doubt of his own\nability to rule and the will to restore the republic.\"\n\n\"We all know Pertinax,\" said Sextus.  \"He is diffident, that is all.  He\nis modest.  Once he has made his decision--\"\n\nGalen interrupted him\n\n\"Then let us pray the gods to make the rest of us immodest!  The\ndecision that he makes is this:  If Commodus has heard of the\nconspiracy;  if Commodus intends to kill him, he will then allow\nsomebody else to kill Commodus!  He will permit me, who am a killer only\nby professional mistake and not by intention, to be made to kill my\nformer pupil with a poisoned drink!  You understand, not even then will\nPertinax take resolution by the throat and do his own work.\"\n\n\"So Pertinax shall drink this?\"\n\n\"It is meant that Commodus shall drink it.  That is, unless Commodus\nemerges from his sulks too soon and butchers all of us--as we deserve!\"\n\n\"Have done with riddles, Galen!  How will that affect Pertinax, except\nto make him emperor?\"\n\n\"Nothing will make him emperor unless he makes himself,\" said Galen.\n\"You will know tonight.  We lack a hero, Sextus.  All conspirators\nresemble rats that gnaw and run, until one rat at last discovers himself\nCaesar of the herd by accident.  Caius Julius Caesar was a hero.  He was\none mind bold and above and aloof.  He saw.  He considered.  He took.\nHis murderers were all conspirators, who ran like rats and turned on one\nanother.  So are we!  Can you imagine Caius Julius Caesar threatening an\nold philosopher like me with death unless he mixed the poison for a\nwoman to take to his enemy's bedside?  Can you imagine the great Julius\nhesitating to destroy a friend or spare an enemy?\"\n\n\"Do you mean, they strike tonight, and haven't warned me?\"\n\n\"I have warned you.\"\n\n\"Marcia has been prepared these many days to kill me if I meant to\nstrike,\" said Sextus.  \"I can understand that;  it is no more than a\nwoman's method to protect her bully.  She accuses and defends him, fears\nand loves him, hates him and hates more the man who sets her free.  But\nPertinax--did he not bid you warn me?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Galen.  \"Are you looking for nobility?  I tell you there is\nnothing noble in conspiracies.  Pertinax and Marcia have used you.  They\nwill try to use me.  They will blame me.  They will certainly blame you.\nI advise you to run to your friends in the Aventine Hills.  Thence\nhasten out of Italy.  If Pertinax should fail and Commodus survives this\nnight--\"\n\n\"No, Galen.  He must not fail!  Rome needs Pertinax.  That poison--\nphaugh!  Is no sword left in Rome?  Has Pertinax no iron in him?  Better\none of Marcia's long pins than that unmanly stuff.  Where is Narcissus?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Galen.  \"Narcissus is another who will do well to\nprotect himself.  Commodus is well disposed toward him. Commodus might\nsend for him--as he will surely send for me if belly-burning sets in.\nHe and I would make a good pair to be blamed for murdering an emperor.\"\n\n\"You run!\" urged Sextus.  \"Go now!  Go to my camp in the Aventines.  You\nwill find Norbanus and two freedmen waiting near the Porta Capena;  they\nare wearing farmers' clothes and look as if they came from Sicily.  They\nknow you.  Say I bade them take you into hiding.\"\n\nGalen smiled at him.  \"And you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Narcissus shall smuggle me into the palace.  It is I who will slay\nCommodus, lest Pertinax should stain his hands.  If they prefer to turn\non me, what matter?  Pertinax, if he is to be Caesar, will do better not\nto mount the throne all bloody.  Let him blame me and then execute me.\nRome will reap the benefit. Marcia has the praetorian guard well under\ncontrol, what with her bribes and all the license she has begged for\nthem.  Let Marcia proclaim that Pertinax is Caesar, the praetorian guard\nwill follow suit, and the senate will confirm it so soon after daybreak\nthat the citizens will find themselves obeying a new Caesar before they\nknow the old one is dead!  Then let Pertinax make new laws and restore\nthe ancient liberties.  I will die happy.\"\n\n\"O youth--insolence of youth!\" said Galen, smiling.  He resumed his\nmixing of the powders, adding new ingredients.  \"I was young once--young\nand insolent.  I dared to try to tutor Commodus!  But never in my long\nlife was I insolent enough to claim all virtue for myself and bid my\nelders go and hide!  You think you will slay Commodus?  I doubt it.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\nSextus was annoyed.  The youth in him resented that his altruism should\nbe mocked.\n\n\"Pertinax should do it,\" Galen answered.  \"If Rome needed no more than\nphilosophy and grammar, better make me Caesar!  I was mixing my\nphilosophy with surgery and medicine while Pertinax was sucking at his\nmother's breast in a Ligurian hut. Rome, my son, is sick of too much\nmixed philosophy.  She needs a man of iron--a riser to occasion--a\ncutter of Gordian knots, precisely as a sick man needs a surgeon.  The\nsenate will vote, as you say, at the praetorian guard's dictation.  You\nhave been clever, my Sextus, with your stirring of faction against\nfaction.  They are mean men, all so full of mutual suspicion as to heave\na huge sigh when they know that Pertinax is Caesar, knowing he will\noverlook their plotting and rule without bloodshed if that can be done.\nBut it can't be!  Unless Pertinax is man enough to strike the blow that\nshall restore the ancient liberties, then he is better dead before he\ntries to play the savior!  We have a tyrant now.  Shall we exchange him\nfor a weak-kneed theorist?\"\n\n\"Are you ready to die, Galen?\"\n\n\"Why not?  Are you the only Roman?  I am not so old I have no virtue\nleft.  A little wisdom comes with old age, Sextus.  It is better to live\nfor one's country than to die for it, but since no way has been invented\nof avoiding death, it is wiser to die usefully than like a sandal thrown\non to the rubbish-heap because the fashion changes.\"\n\n\"I wish you would speak plainly, Galen.  I have told you all my secrets.\nYou have seen me risk my life a thousand times in the midst of Commodus'\ninformers, coming and going, interviewing this and that one, urging\nhere, restraining there, denying myself even hope of personal reward.\nYou know I have been whole-hearted in the cause of Pertinax.  Is it\nright, in a crisis, to put me off with subtleties?\"\n\n\"Life is subtle.  So is virtue.  So is this stuff,\" Galen answered,\npoking at the mixture with a bronze spoon.  \"Every man must choose his\nown way in a crisis.  Some one's star has fallen. Commodus'?  I think\nnot.  That star blazed out of obscurity, and Commodus is not obscure.\nMine?  I am unimportant;  I shall make no splendor in the heavens when\nmy hour comes.  Marcia's?  Is she obscure?  Yours?  You are like me, not\nborn to the purple;  when a sparrow dies, however diligently he has\nlabored in the dirt, no meteors announce his fall.  No, not Maternus,\nthe outlaw, to say nothing of Sextus, the legally dead man, can command\nsuch notice from the sky.  That meteor was some one's who shall blaze\ninto fame and then die.\"\n\n\"Dark words, Galen!\"\n\n\"Dark deeds!\" the old man answered.  \"And a path to be chosen in\ndarkness!  Shall I poison the man whom I taught as a boy?  Shall I\nrefuse, and be drowned in the sewer by Marcia's slaves?  Shall I betray\nmy friends to save my own old carcass?  Shall I run away and hide, at my\nage, and live hounded by my own thoughts, fearful of my shadow, eating\ncharity from peasants?  I can easily say no to all those things.  What\nthen?  It is not what a man does not, but what he does that makes him or\nunmakes him.  There is nothing left but subtlety, my Sextus.  What will\nyou do?  Go and do it now.  Tomorrow may be too late.\"\n\nSextus shrugged his shoulders, baffled and irritated.  He had always\nlooked to Galen for advice in a predicament.  It was Galen, in fact, who\nhad kept him from playing much more than the part of a spy-listening,\ntalking, suggesting, but forever doing nothing violent.\n\n\"You know as well as I do, there is nothing ready,\" he retorted. \"Long\nago I could have had a thousand armed men waiting for a moment such as\nthis to rally behind Pertinax.  But I listened to you--\"\n\n\"And are accordingly alive, not crucified!\" said Galen.  \"The praetorian\nguard is well able to slaughter any thousand men, to uphold Commodus or\nto put Pertinax in the place of Commodus. Your thousand men would only\ndecorate a thousand gibbets, whether Pertinax should win or lose.  If he\nshould win, and become Caesar, he would have to make them an example of\nhis love of law and order, proving his impartiality by blaming them for\nwhat he never invited them to do.  For mark this:  Pertinax has never\nnamed himself as Commodus' successor.  I warn you:  there is far less\nsafety for his friends than for his enemies, unless he, with his own\nhand, strikes the blow that makes him emperor.\"\n\n\"If Marcia should do it--?\"\n\n\"That would be the end of Marcia.\"\n\n\"If I should do it?\"\n\n\"That would be the end of you, my Sextus.\"\n\n\"Let us say farewell, then, Galen!  This right hand shall do it. It will\nsave my friends.  It will provide a culprit on whom Pertinax may lay the\nblame.  He will ascend the throne unguilty of his predecessor's blood--\"\n\n\"And you?\" asked Galen.\n\n\"I will take my own life.  I will gladly die when I have ridded Rome of\nCommodus.\"\n\nHe paused, awaiting a reply, but Galen appeared almost rudely\nunconcerned.\n\n\"You will not say farewell?\"\n\n\"It is too soon,\" Galen answered, folding up his powder in a sheet of\nparchment, tying it, at great pains to arrange the package neatly.\n\n\"Will you not wish me success?\"\n\n\"That is something, my Sextus, that I have no powders for.  I have\noccasionally cured men.  I can set most kinds of fractures with\nconsiderable skill, old though I am.  And I can divert a man's attention\nsometimes, so that he lets nature heal him of mysterious diseases.  But\nsuccess is something you have already wished for and have already made\nor unmade.  What you did, my Sextus, is the scaffolding of what you do\nnow;  this, in turn, of what you will do next.  I gave you my advice.  I\nbade you run away--in which case I would bid you farewell, but not\notherwise.\"\n\n\"I will not run.\"\n\n\"I heard you.\"\n\n\"And you said you are sentimental, Galen!\"\n\n\"I have proved it to you.  If I were not, I myself would run!\"\n\nGalen led the way out of the room into the hall where the mosaic floor\nand plastered walls presented colored temple scenes--priests burning\nincense at the shrine of Aesculapius, the sick and maimed arriving and\nthe cured departing, giving praise.\n\n\"There will be no hero left in Rome when they have slain our Roman\nHercules,\" said Galen.  \"He has been a triton in a pond of minnows.  You\nand I and all the other little men may not regret him afterward, since\nheroes, and particularly mad ones, are not madly loved.  But we will not\nenjoy the rivalry of minnows.\"\n\nHe led Sextus to the porch and stood there for a minute holding to his\narm.\n\n\"There will be no rivals who will dare to raise their heads,\" said\nSextus, \"once our Pertinax has made his bid for power.\"\n\n\"But he will not,\" Galen answered.  \"He will hesitate and let others do\nthe bidding.  Too many scruples!  He who would govern an empire might\nbetter have fetters on feet and hands!  Now go. But go not to the palace\nif you hope to see a heroism--or tomorrow's dawn!\"\n\n\n\n\nXII.-LONG LIVE CAESAR!\n\n\n\nThat night it rained.  The wind blew yelling squalls along the streets.\nAt intervals the din of hail on cobble-stones and roofs became a\nstinging sea of sound.  The wavering oil lanterns died out one by one\nand left the streets in darkness in which now and then a slave-borne\nlitter labored like a boat caught spreading too much sail.  The\noverloaded sewers backed up and made pools of foulness, difficult to\nford.  Along the Tiber banks there was panic where the river-boats were\nplunging and breaking adrift on the rising flood and miserable, drenched\nslaves labored with the bales of merchandize, hauling the threatened\nstuff to higher ground.\n\nBut the noisiest, dismalest place was the palace, the heart of all Rome,\nwhere the rain and hail dinned down on marble.  There was havoc in the\nclumps of ornamental trees--crashing of pots blown down from balconies--\nthunder of rent awnings and the splashing of countless cataracts where\noverloaded gutters spilled their surplus on mosaic pavement fifty or a\nhundred feet below. No light showed, saving at the guard-house by the\nmain gate, where a group of sentries shrugged themselves against the\nwall--ill-tempered, shivering, alert.  However mutinous a Roman army, or\na legion, or a guard might be, its individuals were loyal to the routine\nwork of military duty.\n\nA decurion stepped out beneath a splashing arch, the lamplight gleaming\non his wetted bronze and crimson.\n\n\"Narcissus?  Yes, I recognize you.  Who is this?\" Narcissus and Sextus\nwere shrouded in loose, hooded cloaks of raw wool, under which they\nhugged a change of footgear.  Sextus had his face well covered.\nNarcissus pushed him forward under the guard-room arch, out of the rain.\n\n\"This is a man from Antioch, whom Caesar told me to present to him,\" he\nsaid.  \"I know him well.  His names is Marius.\"\n\n\"I have no orders to admit a man of that name.\" Narcissus waxed\nconfidential.\n\n\"Do you wish to get both of us into trouble?\" he asked.  \"You know\nCaesar's way.  He said bring him and forgot, I suppose, to tell his\nsecretary to write the order for admission.  Tonight he will remember my\nspeaking to him about this expert with a javelin, and if I have to tell\nhim--\"\n\n\"Speak with the centurion.\"\n\nThe decurion beckoned them into the guard-house, where a fire burned in\na bronze tripod, casting a warm glow on walls hung with shields and\nweapons.  A centurion, munching oily seed and wiping his mouth with the\nback of his hand, came out of an inner office. He was not the type that\nhad made Roman arms invincible.  He lacked the self-reliant dignity of\nan old campaigner, substituting for it self-assertiveness and flashy\nmanners.  He was annoyed because he could not get the seed out of his\nmouth with his finger in time to look aristocratic.\n\n\"What now, Narcissus?  By Bacchus, no!  No irregularities tonight!  The\nvery gods themselves are imitating Caesar's ill-humor!  Who is it you\nhave brought?\"\n\nNarcissus beckoned the centurion toward the corner, between fire and\nwall, where he could whisper without risk of being overheard.\n\n\"Marcia told me to bring this man tonight in hope of making Caesar\nchange his mood.  He is a javelin-thrower--an expert.\"\n\n\"Has he a javelin under the cloak?\" the centurion asked suspiciously.\n\n\"He is unarmed, of course.  Do you take us for madmen?\"\n\n\"All Rome is mad tonight,\" said the centurion, \"or I wouldn't be arguing\nwith a gladiator!  Tell me what you know.  A sentry said you saw the\ndeath of Pavonius Nasor.  All the sentries who were in the tunnel at the\ntime are under lock and key, and I expect to be ordered to have the poor\ndevils killed to silence them.  And now Bultius Livius--have you heard\nabout it?\"\n\n\"I have heard Caesar sent for him.\"\n\n\"Well, if Caesar has sent for this friend of yours, he had better first\nmade sacrifices to his gods and pray for something better than befell\npoor Livius!  Yourself too!  They say Livius is being racked--doubtless\nto make him tell more than he knows.  I smell panic in the air.  With\nall these palace slaves coming and going you can't check rumor and I'll\nwager there is already an exodus from Rome.  Gods!  What a night for\ntravel!  Morning will see the country roads all choked with the\nconveyances of bogged up senators!  Let us pray this friend of yours may\nsoften Caesar's mood.  Where is his admission paper?\"\n\n\"As I told the decurion, I have none.\"\n\n\"That settles it then;  he can't enter.  No risks--not when I know the\nmood our Commodus is in!  The commander might take the responsibility,\nbut not I.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Narcissus.\n\n\"Where any lucky fellow is on such a night--in bed.  I wouldn't dare to\nsend for him for less than riots, mutiny and all Rome burning!  Let your\nman wait here.  Go you into the palace and get a written permit for\nhim.\"\n\nBut nothing was more probable than that such a permit would be\nunobtainable.\n\nSextus stepped into the firelight, pulling back the hood to let the\ncenturion see his face.\n\n\"By Mars' red plume!  Are you the man they call Maternus?\"\n\nSextus retorted with a challenge:\n\n\"Now will you send for your commander?  He knows me well.\"\n\n\"Dioscuri!  Doubtless!  Probably you robbed him of his purse!  By\nRomulus and Remus, what is happening to Rome?  That falling star last\nnight portended, did it, that a highwayman should dare to try to enter\nCaesar's palace!  Ho there, decurion!  Bring four men!\"\n\nThe decurion clanked in.  His men surrounded Sextus at a gesture.\n\n\"I ought to put you both in cells,\" said the centurion.  \"But you shall\nhave a chance to justify yourself, Narcissus.  Go on in. Bring Caesar's\nwritten order to release this man Maternus--if you can!\"\n\nNarcissus, like all gladiators, had been trained in facial control lest\nan antagonist should be forewarned by his expression.  Nevertheless, he\nwas hard put to it to hide the fear that seized him.  He supposed not\neven Marcia would dare openly to come to Sextus' rescue.\n\n\"That man is my only friend,\" he said.  \"Let me have word with him\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Not one word!\"\n\nThe centurion made a gesture with his head.  The guards took Sextus by\nthe arms and marched him out into the night, he knowing better than to\nwaste energy or arouse anger by resisting.\n\n\"Then I will go to the commander!  I go straight to him,\" Narcissus\nstammered.  \"Idiot!  Don't you know that Marcia protects Maternus?\nOtherwise, how should an outlaw whose face is so well known that you\nrecognized him instantly--how should he dare to approach the palace?\"\n\nThe centurion touched his forehead.\n\n\"Mad, I daresay!  Go on in.  Get Marcia's protection for him. Bring me\nher command in writing!  Wait, though--let me look at you.\"\n\nHe made Narcissus throw his heavy cloak off, clean his legs and change\ninto his other foot-gear.  Then he examined his costume.\n\n\"Even on a night like this they'd punish me for letting a man pass who\nwasn't dressed right.  Let me see, you're not free yet; you don't have\nto wear a toga.  I spend half my days teaching clodhoppers how to fold\nhired togas properly behind the neck. It's the only way you can tell a\nslave from a citizen these days! The praetorian guard ought to be\nrecruited from the tailors' shops!  Lace up your sandal properly.  Now--\nany weapons underneath that tunic?\"\n\nSullenly Narcissus held his arms up and submitted to be searched. He\nusually came and went unchallenged, being known as one of Caesar's\nfavorites, but the centurion's suspicions were aroused. They were almost\nconfirmed a moment later.  The decurion returned and laid a long, lean\ndagger on the table.\n\n\"Taken from the prisoner,\" he reported.  \"It was hidden beneath his\ntunic.  He looks desperate enough to kill himself, so I left two men to\nkeep an eye on him.\"\n\nThe centurion scratched his chin again, his mouth half-open.\n\n\"Whom do you propose to visit in the palace?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Marcia,\" said Narcissus.\n\nThe centurion turned to the decurion.\n\n\"Go you with him.  Hand him over to the hall-attendants.  Bid them pass\nhim from hand to hand into Marcia's presence.  Don't return until you\nhave word he has reached her.\"\n\nTo all intents and purposes a prisoner, Narcissus was marched along the\nmosaic pavement of a bronze-roofed colonnade, whose marble columns\nflanked the approach to the palace steps. Drenched guards, posted near\nthe eaves where water splashed on them clanged their shields in darkness\nas the decurion passed; there was not a square yard of the palace\ngrounds unwatched.\n\nThere was a halt beside the little marble pavilion near the palace\nsteps, where the decurion turned Narcissus over to an attendant in\npalace uniform, but no comment;  the palace was too used to seeing\nfavorites of one day in disgrace the next.\n\nWithin the palace there was draughtily lighted gloom, a sensation of\ndread and mysterious restlessness.  The bronze doors leading to the\nemperor's apartments were shut and guards posted outside them who\ndemanded extremely definite reasons for admitting any one;  even when\nthe centurion's message was delivered some one had to be sent in first\nto find out whether Marcia was willing, and for nearly half an hour\nNarcissus waited, biting his lip with impatience.\n\nWhen he was sent for at last, and accompanied in, he found Marcia,\nPertinax and Galen seated unattended in the gorgeous, quiet anteroom\nnext to the emperor's bedchamber.  The outer storm was hardly audible\nthrough the window-shutters, but there was an atmosphere of impending\nclimax, like the hush and rumble that precedes eruptions.\n\nMarcia nodded and dismissed the attendant who had brought Narcissus.\nThere was a strained look about her eyes, a tightening at the corners of\nthe mouth.  Her voice was almost hoarse:\n\n\"What is it?  You bring bad news, Narcissus!  What has happened?\"\n\n\"Sextus has been arrested by the main gate guard!\"\n\nGalen came out of a reverie.  Pertinax bit at his nails and looked\nstartled;  worry had made him look as old as Galen, but his shoulders\nwere erect and he was very splendid in his jeweled full dress.  None\nspoke;  they waited on Marcia, who turned the news over in her mind a\nminute.\n\n\"When?  Why?\" she asked at last.\n\n\"He proposed I should smuggle him in, that he might be of service to\nyou.  He was stormy-minded.  He said Rome may need a determined man\ntonight.  But the centurion of the guard recognized him--knew he is\nMaternus.  He refused to summon the commander.  Sextus is locked in a\ncell, and there is no knowing what the guards may do to him.  They may\ntry to make him talk. Please write and order him released.\"\n\n\"Yes, order him released,\" said Pertinax.\n\nBut Marcia's strained lips flickered with the vestige of a smile.\n\n\"A determined man!\" she said, her eyes on Pertinax.  \"By morning a\ndetermined man might give his own commands.  Sextus is safe where he is.\nLet him stay there until you have power to release him!  Go and wait in\nthe outer room, Narcissus!\"\n\nNarcissus had no alternative.  Though he could sense the climax with the\nmarrow of his bones, he did not dare to disobey.  He might have rushed\ninto the emperor's bedroom to denounce the whole conspiracy and offer\nhimself as bodyguard in the emergency. That might have won Commodus'\ngratitude;  it might have opened up a way for liberating Sextus.  But\nthere was irresolution in the air.  And besides, he knew that Sextus\nwould reckon it a treason to himself to be made beholden for his life to\nCommodus, nor would he forgive betrayal of his friends, Pertinax, and\nMarcia and Galen.\n\nSo Narcissus, who cared only for Sextus, reckoning no other man on earth\nhis friend, went and sat beyond the curtains in the smaller, outer room,\nstraining his ears to catch the conversation and wondering what tragedy\nthe gods might have in store.  As gladiator his philosophy was mixed of\nfatalism, cynical irreverence, a semi-military instinct of obedience,\nshort-sightedness and self-will.  He reckoned Marcia no better than\nhimself because she, too, was born in slavery--and Pertinax not vastly\nbetter than himself because he was a charcoal-burner's son.  But it did\nnot enter his head just then that he might be capable of making history.\n\nMarcia well understood him.  Knowing that he could not escape to confer\nwith the slaves in the corridor, because the door leading to the\ncorridor from the smaller anteroom was locked, she was at no pains to\nprevent his overhearing anything.  He could be dealt with either way, at\nher convenience;  a reward might seal his lips, or she could have him\nkilled the instant that his usefulness was ended, which was possibly not\nyet.\n\n\"Sextus,\" she said, \"must be dealt with.  Pertinax, you are the one who\nshould attend to it.  As governor of Rome you can--\"\n\n\"He is thoroughly faithful,\" said Pertinax.  \"He has been very useful to\nus.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Marcia, \"but usefulness has limits.  Time comes when wine\njars need resealing, else the wine spills.  Galen, go in and see the\nemperor.\"\n\nGalen shook his head.\n\n\"He is a sick man,\" said Marcia.  \"I think he has a fever.\"\n\nGalen shook his head again.\n\n\"I will not have it said I poisoned him.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  Who knows that you mixed any poison?\"\n\n\"Sextus, for one,\" Galen answered.\n\n\"Dea dia!  There you are!\" said Marcia.  \"I tell you, Pertinax, your\nSextus may prove to be another Livius!  He has been as ubiquitous as the\nplague.  He knows everything.  What if he should turn around and secure\nhimself and his estates by telling Commodus all he knows?  It was you\nwho trusted Livius.  Do you never learn by your mistakes?\"\n\n\"We don't know yet what Livius has told,\" said Pertinax.  \"If he had\nbeen tortured--but he was not.  Commodus slew him with his own hand.  I\nknow that is true;  it was told me by the steward of the bedchamber, who\nsaw it, and who helped to dispose of the body.  Commodus swore that such\na creeping spy as Livius, who could be true to nobody but scribbled,\nscribbled, scribbled in a journal all the scandal he could learn in\norder to betray anybody when it suited him, was unfit to live.  I take\nthat for a sign that Commodus has had a change of heart.  It was a manly\nthing to slay that wretch.\"\n\n\"He will have a change of governors of Rome before the day dawns!\"\nMarcia retorted.  \"If it weren't that he might change his mistress at\nthe same time--\"\n\n\"You would betray me--eh?\"  Pertinax smiled at her tolerantly.\n\n\"No,\" said Marcia, \"I would let you have your own way and be executed!\nYou deserve it, Pertinax.\"  Pertinax stood up and paced the floor with\nhands behind him.\n\n\"I will have my own way.  I will have it, Marcia!\" he said, calmly,\ncoming to a stand in front of her.  \"He who plots against his emperor\nmay meet the like fate!  If Commodus has no designs against me, then I\nharbor none against him.  I am not sure I am fitted to be Caesar.  I\nhave none to rally to me, to rely on, except the praetorian guard, which\nis a two-horned weapon;  they could turn on me as easily and put a man\nof their own choosing on the throne.  And furthermore, I don't wish to\nbe Caesar. Glabrio, for instance, is a better man than I am for the\ntask.  I will only consent to your desperate course, for the sake of\nRome, if you can prove to me that Commodus designs a wholesale massacre.\nAnd even so, if your name and Galen's and mine are not on his\nproscription list--if he only intends, that is, to punish Christians and\nweaken the faction of that Carthaginian Severus, I will observe my oath\nof loyalty.  I will counsel moderation but--\"\n\n\"You are less than half a man without your mistress!\" Marcia exploded.\n\"Don't stand trying to impress me with your dignity. I don't believe in\nit!  I will send for Cornificia.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" Pertinax showed instant resolution.  \"Cornificia shall not be\ndragged in.  The responsibility is yours and mine.  Let us not lessen\nour dignity by involving an innocent woman.\"\n\nFor a moment that made Marcia breathless.  She was staggered by his\ninnocence, not his assertion of Cornificia's--bemused by the man's\nability to believe what he chose to believe, as if Cornificia had not\nbeen the very first who plotted to make him Caesar.  Cornificia more\nthan any one had contrived to suggest to the praetorian guard that their\ninterest might best be served some day by befriending Pertinax;  she\nmore than any one had disarmed Commodus' suspicion by complaining to him\nabout Pertinax' lack of self-assertiveness, which had become Commodus'\nchief reason for not mistrusting him.  By pretending to report to\nCommodus the private doings of Pertinax and a number of other important\npeople, Cornificia had undermined Commodus' faith in his secret\ninformers who might else have been dangerous.\n\n\"Your Cornificia,\" Marcia began then changed her mind. Disillusionment\nwould do no good.  She must play on the man's illusion that he was the\nmaster of his own will.  \"Very well,\" she went on,  \"Yours be the\ndecision!  No woman can decide such issues.  We are all in your hands--\nCornificia and Galen--all of us--aye, and Rome, too--and even Sextus and\nhis friends.  But you will never have another such opportunity.  It is\ntonight or never, Pertinax!\"\n\nHe winced.  He was about to speak, but something interrupted him. The\ngreat door carved with cupids leading to the emperor's bedchamber opened\ninch by inch and Telamonion came out, closing it softly behind him.\n\n\"Caesar sleeps,\" said the child, \"and the wind blew out the lamp. He was\nvery cross.  It is dark.  It is cold and lonely in there.\"\n\nIn his hand he held a sheet of parchment, covered with writing and\ncreased from his attempts to make a parchment helmet, \"Show me,\" he\nsaid, holding out the sheet to Marcia.\n\nShe took him on her knee and began reading what was written, putting him\ndown when he tugged at the parchment to make her show him how to fold\nit. She found him another sheet to play with and told him to take it to\nPertinax who was a soldier and knew more about helmets.  Then she went\non reading, clutching at the sheet so tightly that her nails blanched\nwhite under the dye.\n\n\"Pertinax!\" she said, shaking the parchment, speaking in a strained\nvoice, \"this is his final list!  He has copied the names from his\ntablets.  Whose name do you guess comes first?\"\n\nPertinax was playing with Telamonion and did not look at her.\n\n\"Severus!\" he answered, morbid jealousy, amounting to obsession,\nstirring that cynical hope in him.\n\n\"Severus isn't mentioned.  The first six names are in this order: Galen,\nMarcia, Cornificia, Pertinax, Narcissus, Sextus alias Maternus.  Do you\nrealize what that means?  It is now or never! Why has he put Galen\nfirst, I wonder?\"\n\nGalen did not appear startled.  His interest was philosophical--\nimpersonal.\n\n\"I should be first.  I am guiltiest.  I taught him in his youth,\" he\nremarked, smiling thinly.  \"I taught him how to loose the beast that\nlives in him, not intending that, of course, but it is what we do that\ncounts.  I should come first!  The state would have been better for the\ndeath of many a man whom I cured;  but I did not cure Commodus, I\nrevealed him to himself, and he fell in love with himself and--\"\n\n\"Now will you poison him?\" said Marcia.\n\n\"No,\" said Galen.  \"Let him kill me.  It is better.\"\n\n\"Gods!  Has Rome no iron left?  You, Pertinax!\" said Marcia, \"Go in and\nkill him!\"\n\nPertinax stood up and stared at her.  The child Telamonion pressed close\nto him holding his righthand, gazing at Marcia.\n\n\"Telamonion, go in and play with Narcissus,\" said Marcia.  She pointed\nat the curtains and the child obeyed.\n\n\"Go in and kill him, Pertinax!\"  Marcia shook the list of names, then\nstood still suddenly, like a woman frozen, ash-white under the carmine\non her cheeks.\n\nThere came a voice from the emperor's bedroom, more like the roar of an\nangry beast than human speech:\n\n\"Marcia!  Do you hear me, Marcia?  By all Olympus--Marcia!\"\n\nShe opened the door.  The inner room was in darkness.  There came a gust\nof chill wet wind that made all the curtains flutter and there was a\ncomfortless noise of cataracts of rain downpouring from the over-loaded\ngutters on to marble balconies.  Then the emperor's voice again:\n\n\"Is that you, Marcia?  You leave your Commodus to die of thirst! I\nparch--I have a fever--bring my wine-cup!\"\n\n\"At once, Commodus.\"\n\nShe glanced at the golden cup on an onyx table.  On a stand beside it\nwas an unpierced wine jar set in an enormous bowl of snow.  She looked\nat Pertinax--and shrugged her shoulders, possibly because the wind blew\nthrough the opened door.  She glanced at Galen.\n\n\"If you have a fever, shouldn't I bring Galen?\"\n\n\"No!\" roared Commodus.  \"The man might poison me!  Bring me the cup, and\nyou fill it yourself!  Make haste before I die of thirst!  Then bring me\nanother lamp and dose the shutters!  No slaves--I can't bear the sight\nof them!\"\n\n\"Instantly, Commodus.  I am coming with it now.  Only wait while I\npierce the amphora.\"\n\nShe closed the door and looked swiftly once again at Pertinax. He\nfrowned over the list of names and did not look at her.  She walked\nstraight up to Galen.\n\n\"Give me!\" she demanded, holding out her hand.  He drew a little\nparchment package from his bosom and she clutched it, saying nothing.\nGalen was the one who spoke:\n\n\"Responsibility is his who orders.  May the gods see that it falls where\nit belongs.\"\n\nShe took no notice of his speech but stood for a moment untying the\nstrings of the package, frowning to herself, then bit the string through\nand, clutching the little package in her fist, took a gilded tool from\nbeside the snow-bowl and pierced the seal of the amphora.  Then she put\nthe poison in the bottom of the golden cup and poured the wine--with\ndifficulty, since the jar was heavy, but Pertinax, who watched intently,\nmade no movement to assist.  She stirred the wine with one of her long\nhair-pins.\n\n\"Marcia!\" roared Commodus.\n\n\"I am coming now.\"\n\nShe went into the bedroom, leaving the door not quite closed behind her.\nPertinax began to stare at Galen critically.  Galen blinked at him.\nCommodus' voice came very distinctly from the inner room:\n\n\"Taste first, Marcia!  Olympus!  I can't see you in the dark. Come\nclose.  Are your lips wet?  Let me feel them!\"\n\n\"I drank a whole mouthful, Commodus.  How hot your hand is! Feel--feel\nthe cup--you can feel with your finger how much I have tasted.  I broke\nthe seal of a fresh jar of Falernian.\"\n\n\"Some of your Christians might have tampered with it!\"\n\n\"No, no, Commodus.  That jar has been in the cellar since before you\nwere born and the seal was intact.  I washed the cup myself.\"\n\n\"Well, taste again.  Sit here on the bed where I can feel your heart-\nbeats.\"\n\nPresently he gave a gasp and belched, as always after he had swallowed a\nwhole cupful at one draught.\n\n\"Now close the shutters and bolt them on the inside;  there might be\nsome of your Christians lurking on the balcony.\"\n\n\"In this storm, Commodus?  And there are guards on duty.\"\n\n\"Close them, I say!  Who trusts the guards!  Did they guard the tunnel?\nI will rid Rome of all Christians tomorrow!  Aye, and of many another\nreptile!  They have robbed me of my fun in the arena--I will find\nanother way to interest myself!  Now bring me a fresh lamp in here, and\nset the tablets by the bed.\"\n\nShe came out, shutting the door behind her, then stood listening. She\ndid not tremble.  Her wrist was red where Commodus had held it.\n\n\"How long?\" she whispered, looking at Galen.\n\n\"Only a very little time,\" he answered.  \"How much did you drink?\"\n\nShe put her hand to her stomach, as if pain had stabbed her.\n\n\"Drink pure wine,\" said Galen.  \"Swiftly.  Drink a lot of it.\"\n\nShe went to the amphora.  Before she could reach it there came a roar\nlike a furious beast's from the bedroom.\n\n\"I am poisoned!  Marcia!  Marcia!  My belly burns!  I am on fire inside!\nI faint!  Marcia!--Marcia!\"  Then groans and a great creaking of the\nbed.\n\nMarcia--she was trembling now--drank wine, and Pertinax began to pace\nthe floor.\n\n\"You, Galen, you had better go in to him,\" said Marcia.\n\n\"If I do go, I must heal him,\" Galen answered.\n\nThe groans in the bedroom ceased.  The shouts began again--terrific\nimprecations--curses hurled at Marcia--the struggles of a strong man in\nthe throes of cramp--and, at last, the sound of vomiting.\n\n\"If he vomits he will not die!\" Marcia exclaimed.  Galen nodded. He\nappeared immensely satisfied--expectant.\n\n\"Galen, have you--will that poison kill him?\" Marcia demanded.\n\n\"No,\" said Galen.  \"Pertinax must kill him.  I promised I would do my\nbest for Pertinax.  Behold your opportunity!\"\n\nPertinax strode toward him, clutching at a dagger underneath his tunic.\n\n\"Kill me if you wish,\" said Galen, \"but if you have any resolution you\nhad better do first what you wanted me to do.  And you will need me\nafterward.\"\n\nCommodus was vomiting and in the pauses roaring like a mad beast. Marcia\nseized Pertinax by the arm.  \"I have done my part,\" she said.  \"Now\nnerve yourself!  Go in now and finish it!\"\n\n\"He may die yet.  Let us wait and see,\" said Pertinax.\n\nA howl rising to a scream--terror and anger mingled--came from the\nbedroom;  then again the noise of vomiting and the creaking of the bed\nas Commodus writhed in the spasms of cramp.\n\n\"He will feel better presently,\" said Galen.\n\n\"If so, you die first!  You have betrayed us all!\"  Pertinax shook off\nMarcia and scowled at Galen, raising his right arm as if about to strike\nthe old man.  \"False to your emperor!  False to us!\"\n\n\"And quite willing to die, if first I may see you play the man!\" said\nGalen, blinking up at him.\n\n\"Hush!\" exclaimed Marcia.  \"Listen!  Gods!  He is up off the bed! He\nwill be in here in a minute!  Pertinax!\"\n\nAlarm subsided.  They could hear the thud and creak as Commodus threw\nhimself back on the bed--then writhing again and groans of agony.\nBetween the spasms Commodus began to frame connected sentences:\n\n\"Guards!  Your emperor is being murdered!  Rescue your Commodus!\"\n\n\"He is recovering,\" said Galen.\n\n\"Give me your dagger!\" said Marcia and clutched at Pertinax' tunic,\nfeeling for it.\n\nBut she was not even strong enough to resist the half-contemptuous shrug\nwith which Pertinax thrust her away.\n\n\"You disgust me.  There is neither dignity nor decency in this,\" he\nmuttered.  \"Nothing but evil can come of it.\"\n\n\"Whose was the star that fell?\" asked Galen.\n\nThere came more noise from the bedroom.  Commodus seemed to be trying to\nget to his feet again.  Marcia ran toward the smaller anteroom and\ndragged the curtains back.\n\n\"Narcissus!\"\n\nHe came out, carrying Telamonion.  The child lay asleep in his arms.\n\n\"Go and put that child down.  Now earn your freedom--go in and kill the\nemperor!  He has poisoned himself, and he thinks we did it.  Give him\nyour dagger, Pertinax!\"\n\n\"I am only a slave,\" Narcissus answered.  \"It is not right that a slave\nshould kill an emperor.\"\n\nMarcia seized the gladiator by the shoulders, scanned his face, saw what\nshe looked for and bargained for it instantly.\n\n\"Your freedom!  Manumission and a hundred thousand sesterces!\"\n\n\"In writing!\" said Narcissus.\n\n\"Dog!\" growled Pertinax.  \"Go in and do as you are told!\"\n\nBut Narcissus only grinned at him and squared his shoulders.\n\n\"Death means little to a gladiator,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Leave him to me!\" ordered Marcia.\n\n\"Go and sit down at that table, Pertinax.  Take pen and parchment.  Now\nthen--what do you want in writing?  Make haste!\"\n\n\"Freedom--you may keep your money--I shall not wait to receive it.\nFreedom for me and for Sextus and for all of Sextus' friends and\nfreedmen.  An order releasing Sextus from the guard-house instantly.\nPermission to leave Rome and Italy by any route we choose.\"\n\n\"Write, Pertinax!\" said Marcia.  Narcissus glanced at Galen.\n\n\"Galen,\" he said, \"is one of Sextus' friends, so set his name down.\"\n\n\"Never mind me,\" said Galen.  \"They will need me.\"\n\nMarcia stood over Pertinax, watching him write.  She snatched the\ndocument and sanded it, then watched him write the order to the guard,\nreleasing Sextus.\n\n\"There!\" she exclaimed.  \"You have your price.  Go in and kill him!\nGive him your dagger, Pertinax.\"\n\n\"I hoped for heroism, not expecting it,\" said Galen.  \"I expected\ncunning.  Is it absent, too?  If he should use a dagger--many men have\nheard me say that Caesar has a tendency to apoplexy--\"\n\n\"Strangle him!\" commanded Marcia.\n\nShe thrust the palms of her hands against Narcissus' back and pushed him\ntoward the bedroom door, now almost at the end of her reserves of self-\ncontrol.  Her mouth trembled.  She was fighting against hysteria.\n\n\"Light!  Lamp!  Guards!\" roared Commodus, and again the ebony-posted bed\ncreaked under him.  Narcissus stepped into the darkened room.  He left\nthe door open, to have light to do his work by, but Marcia closed it,\nclinging to the gilded satyr's head that served for knob with both\nhands, her lips drawn tight against her teeth, her whole face tortured\nwith anticipation.\n\n\"It is better that a gladiator did it,\" remarked Pertinax, attempting to\nlook calm.  \"I never killed a man.  As general, and as governor of Rome,\nas consul and proconsul, I have spared whom I might.  Some had to die\nbut--my own hands are clean.\"\n\nThere came an awful sound of struggle from the inner room.  A monstrous\nroar was shut off suddenly, half-finished, smothered under bedclothes.\nThen the bed-frame cracked under the strain of Titans fighting--cracked\n--creaked--and utter silence fell.  It lasted several minutes. Then the\ndoor opened and Narcissus came striding out.\n\n\"He was strong,\" he remarked.  \"Look at this.\"\n\nHe bared his arm and showed where Commodus had gripped him;  the lithe\nmuscle looked as if it had been gripped in an iron vise. He chafed it,\nwincing with pain.\n\n\"Go in and observe that I have taken nothing.  Don't be afraid,\" he\nadded scornfully.  \"He fought like the god that he was, but he died--\"\n\n\"Of apoplexy,\" Galen interrupted.  \"That is to say, of a surging of\nblood to the brain and a cerebral rupture.  It is fortunate you have a\ndoctor on the scene who knew of his liability to--\"\n\n\"We must go and see,\" said Marcia.  \"Come with me, Pertinax. Then we\nmust tidy the bed and make haste and summon the officers of the\npraetorian guard.  Let them hear Galen say he died of apoplexy.\"\n\nShe picked up a lamp from the table and Pertinax moved to follow her,\nbut Narcissus stepped in his way.\n\n\"Ave, Caesar!\" he said, throwing up his right hand.\n\n\"You may go,\" said Pertinax.  \"Go in silence.  Not a word to a soul in\nthe corridors.  Leave Rome.  Leave Italy.  Take Sextus with you.\"\n\n\"You will let him go?\" asked Marcia.  \"Pertinax, what will become of\nyou?  Send to the guard at the gate and command them to seize him!\nSextus and Narcissus--\"\n\n\"Have my promise!\" he retorted.  \"If the fates intend me to be Caesar,\nit shall not be said I slew the men who set me on the throne.\"\n\n\"You are Caesar,\" she answered.  \"How long will you last?  All omens\nfavored you--the murder in the tunnel--now this storm, like a veil to\nact behind, and--\"\n\n\"And last night a falling star!\" said Galen.  \"Give me parchment. I will\nwrite the cause of death.  Then let me go too, or else kill me.  I am no\nmore use.  This is the second time that I have failed to serve the world\nby tutoring a Caesar.  Commodus the hero, and now you the--\"\n\n\"Silence!\" Marcia commanded.  \"Or even Pertinax may rise above his\nscruples!  Write a death certificate at once, and go your way and follow\nSextus!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Caesar Dies, by Talbot Mundy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CAESAR DIES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 10422.txt or 10422.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/4/2/10422/\n\nProduced by Jake Jaqua\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n"}
