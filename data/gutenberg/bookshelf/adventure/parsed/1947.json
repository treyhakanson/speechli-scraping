THE REPUBLICAN\n\nHe was born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad.\nAnd that was all his patrimony. His very paternity was obscure, although\nthe village of Gavrillac had long since dispelled the cloud of mystery\nthat hung about it. Those simple Brittany folk were not so simple as to\nbe deceived by a pretended relationship which did not even possess\nthe virtue of originality. When a nobleman, for no apparent reason,\nannounces himself the godfather of an infant fetched no man knew whence,\nand thereafter cares for the lad's rearing and education, the most\nunsophisticated of country folk perfectly understand the situation. And\nso the good people of Gavrillac permitted themselves no illusions on the\nscore of the real relationship between Andre-Louis Moreau--as the lad had\nbeen named--and Quintin de Kercadiou, Lord of Gavrillac, who dwelt in the\nbig grey house that dominated from its eminence the village clustering\nbelow.\n\nAndre-Louis had learnt his letters at the village school, lodged the\nwhile with old Rabouillet, the attorney, who in the capacity of fiscal\nintendant, looked after the affairs of M. de Kercadiou. Thereafter, at\nthe age of fifteen, he had been packed off to Paris, to the Lycee of\nLouis Le Grand, to study the law which he was now returned to practise\nin conjunction with Rabouillet. All this at the charges of his\ngodfather, M. de Kercadiou, who by placing him once more under the\ntutelage of Rabouillet would seem thereby quite clearly to be making\nprovision for his future.\n\nAndre-Louis, on his side, had made the most of his opportunities. You\nbehold him at the age of four-and-twenty stuffed with learning enough\nto produce an intellectual indigestion in an ordinary mind. Out of\nhis zestful study of Man, from Thucydides to the Encyclopaedists, from\nSeneca to Rousseau, he had confirmed into an unassailable conviction\nhis earliest conscious impressions of the general insanity of his own\nspecies. Nor can I discover that anything in his eventful life ever\nafterwards caused him to waver in that opinion.\n\nIn body he was a slight wisp of a fellow, scarcely above middle height,\nwith a lean, astute countenance, prominent of nose and cheek-bones, and\nwith lank, black hair that reached almost to his shoulders. His mouth\nwas long, thin-lipped, and humorous. He was only just redeemed from\nugliness by the splendour of a pair of ever-questing, luminous eyes, so\ndark as to be almost black. Of the whimsical quality of his mind and\nhis rare gift of graceful expression, his writings--unfortunately but too\nscanty--and particularly his Confessions, afford us very ample evidence.\nOf his gift of oratory he was hardly conscious yet, although he had\nalready achieved a certain fame for it in the Literary Chamber of\nRennes--one of those clubs by now ubiquitous in the land, in which the\nintellectual youth of France foregathered to study and discuss the\nnew philosophies that were permeating social life. But the fame he had\nacquired there was hardly enviable. He was too impish, too caustic,\ntoo much disposed--so thought his colleagues--to ridicule their sublime\ntheories for the regeneration of mankind. Himself he protested that\nhe merely held them up to the mirror of truth, and that it was not his\nfault if when reflected there they looked ridiculous.\n\nAll that he achieved by this was to exasperate; and his expulsion from a\nsociety grown mistrustful of him must already have followed but for\nhis friend, Philippe de Vilmorin, a divinity student of Rennes, who,\nhimself, was one of the most popular members of the Literary Chamber.\n\nComing to Gavrillac on a November morning, laden with news of the\npolitical storms which were then gathering over France, Philippe found\nin that sleepy Breton village matter to quicken his already lively\nindignation. A peasant of Gavrillac, named Mabey, had been shot dead\nthat morning in the woods of Meupont, across the river, by a gamekeeper\nof the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr. The unfortunate fellow had been caught\nin the act of taking a pheasant from a snare, and the gamekeeper had\nacted under explicit orders from his master.\n\nInfuriated by an act of tyranny so absolute and merciless, M. de\nVilmorin proposed to lay the matter before M. de Kercadiou. Mabey was a\nvassal of Gavrillac, and Vilmorin hoped to move the Lord of Gavrillac to\ndemand at least some measure of reparation for the widow and the three\norphans which that brutal deed had made.\n\nBut because Andre-Louis was Philippe's dearest friend--indeed, his almost\nbrother--the young seminarist sought him out in the first instance. He\nfound him at breakfast alone in the long, low-ceilinged, white-panelled\ndining-room at Rabouillet's--the only home that Andre-Louis had ever\nknown--and after embracing him, deafened him with his denunciation of M.\nde La Tour d'Azyr.\n\n\"I have heard of it already,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"You speak as if the thing had not surprised you,\" his friend reproached\nhim.\n\n\"Nothing beastly can surprise me when done by a beast. And La Tour\nd'Azyr is a beast, as all the world knows. The more fool Mabey for\nstealing his pheasants. He should have stolen somebody else's.\"\n\n\"Is that all you have to say about it?\"\n\n\"What more is there to say? I've a practical mind, I hope.\"\n\n\"What more there is to say I propose to say to your godfather, M. de\nKercadiou. I shall appeal to him for justice.\"\n\n\"Against M. de La Tour d'Azyr?\" Andre-Louis raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"My dear ingenuous Philippe, dog doesn't eat dog.\"\n\n\"You are unjust to your godfather. He is a humane man.\"\n\n\"Oh, as humane as you please. But this isn't a question of humanity.\nIt's a question of game-laws.\"\n\nM. de Vilmorin tossed his long arms to Heaven in disgust. He was a tall,\nslender young gentleman, a year or two younger than Andre-Louis. He was\nvery soberly dressed in black, as became a seminarist, with white bands\nat wrists and throat and silver buckles to his shoes. His neatly clubbed\nbrown hair was innocent of powder.\n\n\"You talk like a lawyer,\" he exploded.\n\n\"Naturally. But don't waste anger on me on that account. Tell me what\nyou want me to do.\"\n\n\"I want you to come to M. de Kercadiou with me, and to use your\ninfluence to obtain justice. I suppose I am asking too much.\"\n\n\"My dear Philippe, I exist to serve you. I warn you that it is a futile\nquest; but give me leave to finish my breakfast, and I am at your\norders.\"\n\nM. de Vilmorin dropped into a winged armchair by the well-swept hearth,\non which a piled-up fire of pine logs was burning cheerily. And whilst\nhe waited now he gave his friend the latest news of the events in\nRennes. Young, ardent, enthusiastic, and inspired by Utopian ideals, he\npassionately denounced the rebellious attitude of the privileged.\n\nAndre-Louis, already fully aware of the trend of feeling in the ranks of\nan order in whose deliberations he took part as the representative of\na nobleman, was not at all surprised by what he heard. M. de Vilmorin\nfound it exasperating that his friend should apparently decline to share\nhis own indignation.\n\n\"Don't you see what it means?\" he cried. \"The nobles, by disobeying the\nKing, are striking at the very foundations of the throne. Don't they\nperceive that their very existence depends upon it; that if the throne\nfalls over, it is they who stand nearest to it who will be crushed?\nDon't they see that?\"\n\n\"Evidently not. They are just governing classes, and I never heard of\ngoverning classes that had eyes for anything but their own profit.\"\n\n\"That is our grievance. That is what we are going to change.\"\n\n\"You are going to abolish governing classes? An interesting experiment.\nI believe it was the original plan of creation, and it might have\nsucceeded but for Cain.\"\n\n\"What we are going to do,\" said M. de Vilmorin, curbing his\nexasperation, \"is to transfer the government to other hands.\"\n\n\"And you think that will make a difference?\"\n\n\"I know it will.\"\n\n\"Ah! I take it that being now in minor orders, you already possess the\nconfidence of the Almighty. He will have confided to you His intention\nof changing the pattern of mankind.\"\n\nM. de Vilmorin's fine ascetic face grew overcast. \"You are profane,\nAndre,\" he reproved his friend.\n\n\"I assure you that I am quite serious. To do what you imply would\nrequire nothing short of divine intervention. You must change man, not\nsystems. Can you and our vapouring friends of the Literary Chamber\nof Rennes, or any other learned society of France, devise a system of\ngovernment that has never yet been tried? Surely not. And can they say\nof any system tried that it proved other than a failure in the end? My\ndear Philippe, the future is to be read with certainty only in the\npast. Ab actu ad posse valet consecutio. Man never changes. He is always\ngreedy, always acquisitive, always vile. I am speaking of Man in the\nbulk.\"\n\n\"Do you pretend that it is impossible to ameliorate the lot of the\npeople?\" M. de Vilmorin challenged him.\n\n\"When you say the people you mean, of course, the populace. Will you\nabolish it? That is the only way to ameliorate its lot, for as long as\nit remains populace its lot will be damnation.\"\n\n\"You argue, of course, for the side that employs you. That is natural, I\nsuppose.\" M. de Vilmorin spoke between sorrow and indignation.\n\n\"On the contrary, I seek to argue with absolute detachment. Let us\ntest these ideas of yours. To what form of government do you aspire? A\nrepublic, it is to be inferred from what you have said. Well, you have\nit already. France in reality is a republic to-day.\"\n\nPhilippe stared at him. \"You are being paradoxical, I think. What of the\nKing?\"\n\n\"The King? All the world knows there has been no king in France since\nLouis XIV. There is an obese gentleman at Versailles who wears the\ncrown, but the very news you bring shows for how little he really\ncounts. It is the nobles and clergy who sit in the high places, with the\npeople of France harnessed under their feet, who are the real rulers.\nThat is why I say that France is a republic; she is a republic built\non the best pattern--the Roman pattern. Then, as now, there were great\npatrician families in luxury, preserving for themselves power and\nwealth, and what else is accounted worth possessing; and there was\nthe populace crushed and groaning, sweating, bleeding, starving, and\nperishing in the Roman kennels. That was a republic; the mightiest we\nhave seen.\"\n\nPhilippe strove with his impatience. \"At least you will admit--you have,\nin fact, admitted it--that we could not be worse governed than we are?\"\n\n\"That is not the point. The point is should we be better governed if we\nreplaced the present ruling class by another? Without some guarantee of\nthat I should be the last to lift a finger to effect a change. And what\nguarantees can you give? What is the class that aims at government? I\nwill tell you. The bourgeoisie.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That startles you, eh? Truth is so often disconcerting. You hadn't\nthought of it? Well, think of it now. Look well into this Nantes\nmanifesto. Who are the authors of it?\"\n\n\"I can tell you who it was constrained the municipality of Nantes to\nsend it to the King. Some ten thousand workmen--shipwrights, weavers,\nlabourers, and artisans of every kind.\"\n\n\"Stimulated to it, driven to it, by their employers, the wealthy traders\nand shipowners of that city,\" Andre-Louis replied. \"I have a habit of\nobserving things at close quarters, which is why our colleagues of the\nLiterary Chamber dislike me so cordially in debate. Where I delve they\nbut skim. Behind those labourers and artisans of Nantes, counselling\nthem, urging on these poor, stupid, ignorant toilers to shed their blood\nin pursuit of the will o' the wisp of freedom, are the sail-makers, the\nspinners, the ship-owners and the slave-traders. The slave-traders! The\nmen who live and grow rich by a traffic in human flesh and blood in\nthe colonies, are conducting at home a campaign in the sacred name\nof liberty! Don't you see that the whole movement is a movement of\nhucksters and traders and peddling vassals swollen by wealth into envy\nof the power that lies in birth alone? The money-changers in Paris\nwho hold the bonds in the national debt, seeing the parlous financial\ncondition of the State, tremble at the thought that it may lie in\nthe power of a single man to cancel the debt by bankruptcy. To secure\nthemselves they are burrowing underground to overthrow a state and build\nupon its ruins a new one in which they shall be the masters. And to\naccomplish this they inflame the people. Already in Dauphiny we have\nseen blood run like water--the blood of the populace, always the blood of\nthe populace. Now in Brittany we may see the like. And if in the end the\nnew ideas prevail? if the seigneurial rule is overthrown, what then?\nYou will have exchanged an aristocracy for a plutocracy. Is that worth\nwhile? Do you 'think that under money-changers and slave-traders and\nmen who have waxed rich in other ways by the ignoble arts of buying\nand selling, the lot of the people will be any better than under their\npriests and nobles? Has it ever occurred to you, Philippe, what it\nis that makes the rule of the nobles so intolerable? Acquisitiveness.\nAcquisitiveness is the curse of mankind. And shall you expect less\nacquisitiveness in men who have built themselves up by acquisitiveness?\nOh, I am ready to admit that the present government is execrable,\nunjust, tyrannical--what you will; but I beg you to look ahead, and to\nsee that the government for which it is aimed at exchanging it may be\ninfinitely worse.\"\n\nPhilippe sat thoughtful a moment. Then he returned to the attack.\n\n\"You do not speak of the abuses, the horrible, intolerable abuses of\npower under which we labour at present.\"\n\n\"Where there is power there will always be the abuse of it.\"\n\n\"Not if the tenure of power is dependent upon its equitable\nadministration.\"\n\n\"The tenure of power is power. We cannot dictate to those who hold it.\"\n\n\"The people can--the people in its might.\"\n\n\"Again I ask you, when you say the people do you mean the populace? You\ndo. What power can the populace wield? It can run wild. It can burn\nand slay for a time. But enduring power it cannot wield, because power\ndemands qualities which the populace does not possess, or it would\nnot be populace. The inevitable, tragic corollary of civilization is\npopulace. For the rest, abuses can be corrected by equity; and equity,\nif it is not found in the enlightened, is not to be found at all. M.\nNecker is to set about correcting abuses, and limiting privileges. That\nis decided. To that end the States General are to assemble.\"\n\n\"And a promising beginning we have made in Brittany, as Heaven hears\nme!\" cried Philippe.\n\n\"Pooh! That is nothing. Naturally the nobles will not yield without a\nstruggle. It is a futile and ridiculous struggle--but then... it is human\nnature, I suppose, to be futile and ridiculous.\"\n\nM. de Vilmorin became witheringly sarcastic. \"Probably you will also\nqualify the shooting of Mabey as futile and ridiculous. I should even be\nprepared to hear you argue in defence of the Marquis de La Tour\nd'Azyr that his gamekeeper was merciful in shooting Mabey, since the\nalternative would have been a life-sentence to the galleys.\"\n\nAndre-Louis drank the remainder of his chocolate; set down his cup, and\npushed back his chair, his breakfast done.\n\n\"I confess that I have not your big charity, my dear Philippe. I am\ntouched by Mabey's fate. But, having conquered the shock of this news to\nmy emotions, I do not forget that, after all, Mabey was thieving when he\nmet his death.\"\n\nM. de Vilmorin heaved himself up in his indignation.\n\n\"That is the point of view to be expected in one who is the assistant\nfiscal intendant of a nobleman, and the delegate of a nobleman to the\nStates of Brittany.\"\n\n\"Philippe, is that just? You are angry with me!\" he cried, in real\nsolicitude.\n\n\"I am hurt,\" Vilmorin admitted. \"I am deeply hurt by your attitude. And\nI am not alone in resenting your reactionary tendencies. Do you know\nthat the Literary Chamber is seriously considering your expulsion?\"\n\nAndre-Louis shrugged. \"That neither surprises nor troubles me.\"\n\nM. de Vilmorin swept on, passionately: \"Sometimes I think that you have\nno heart. With you it is always the law, never equity. It occurs to me,\nAndre, that I was mistaken in coming to you. You are not likely to be of\nassistance to me in my interview with M. de Kercadiou.\" He took up his\nhat, clearly with the intention of departing.\n\nAndre-Louis sprang up and caught him by the arm.\n\n\"I vow,\" said he, \"that this is the last time ever I shall consent to\ntalk law or politics with you, Philippe. I love you too well to quarrel\nwith you over other men's affairs.\"\n\n\"But I make them my own,\" Philippe insisted vehemently.\n\n\"Of course you do, and I love you for it. It is right that you should.\nYou are to be a priest; and everybody's business is a priest's business.\nWhereas I am a lawyer--the fiscal intendant of a nobleman, as you\nsay--and a lawyer's business is the business of his client. That is the\ndifference between us. Nevertheless, you are not going to shake me off.\"\n\n\"But I tell you frankly, now that I come to think of it, that I should\nprefer you did not see M. de Kercadiou with me. Your duty to your client\ncannot be a help to me.\"\n\nHis wrath had passed; but his determination remained firm, based upon\nthe reason he gave.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Andre-Louis. \"It shall be as you please. But nothing\nshall prevent me at least from walking with you as far as the chateau,\nand waiting for you while you make your appeal to M. de Kercadiou.\"\n\nAnd so they left the house good friends, for the sweetness of M. de\nVilmorin's nature did not admit of rancour, and together they took their\nway up the steep main street of Gavrillac.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE ARISTOCRAT\n\nThe sleepy village of Gavrillac, a half-league removed from the main\nroad to Rennes, and therefore undisturbed by the world's traffic, lay\nin a curve of the River Meu, at the foot, and straggling halfway up the\nslope, of the shallow hill that was crowned by the squat manor. By the\ntime Gavrillac had paid tribute to its seigneur--partly in money and\npartly in service--tithes to the Church, and imposts to the King, it was\nhard put to it to keep body and soul together with what remained. Yet,\nhard as conditions were in Gavrillac, they were not so hard as in many\nother parts of France, not half so hard, for instance, as with the\nwretched feudatories of the great Lord of La Tour d'Azyr, whose vast\npossessions were at one point separated from this little village by the\nwaters of the Meu.\n\nThe Chateau de Gavrillac owed such seigneurial airs as might be claimed\nfor it to its dominant position above the village rather than to any\nfeature of its own. Built of granite, like all the rest of Gavrillac,\nthough mellowed by some three centuries of existence, it was a squat,\nflat-fronted edifice of two stories, each lighted by four windows with\nexternal wooden shutters, and flanked at either end by two square towers\nor pavilions under extinguisher roofs. Standing well back in a garden,\ndenuded now, but very pleasant in summer, and immediately fronted by a\nfine sweep of balustraded terrace, it looked, what indeed it was, and\nalways had been, the residence of unpretentious folk who found more\ninterest in husbandry than in adventure.\n\nQuintin de Kercadiou, Lord of Gavrillac--Seigneur de Gavrillac was all\nthe vague title that he bore, as his forefathers had borne before him,\nderived no man knew whence or how--confirmed the impression that his\nhouse conveyed. Rude as the granite itself, he had never sought the\nexperience of courts, had not even taken service in the armies of his\nKing. He left it to his younger brother, Etienne, to represent the\nfamily in those exalted spheres. His own interests from earliest years\nhad been centred in his woods and pastures. He hunted, and he cultivated\nhis acres, and superficially he appeared to be little better than any of\nhis rustic metayers. He kept no state, or at least no state commensurate\nwith his position or with the tastes of his niece Aline de Kercadiou.\nAline, having spent some two years in the court atmosphere of Versailles\nunder the aegis of her uncle Etienne, had ideas very different from\nthose of her uncle Quintin of what was befitting seigneurial dignity.\nBut though this only child of a third Kercadiou had exercised, ever\nsince she was left an orphan at the early age of four, a tyrannical rule\nover the Lord of Gavrillac, who had been father and mother to her, she\nhad never yet succeeded in beating down his stubbornness on that\nscore. She did not yet despair--persistence being a dominant note in\nher character--although she had been assiduously and fruitlessly at work\nsince her return from the great world of Versailles some three months\nago.\n\nShe was walking on the terrace when Andre-Louis and M. de Vilmorin\narrived. Her slight body was wrapped against the chill air in a white\npelisse; her head was encased in a close-fitting bonnet, edged with\nwhite fur. It was caught tight in a knot of pale-blue ribbon on the\nright of her chin; on the left a long ringlet of corn-coloured hair had\nbeen permitted to escape. The keen air had whipped so much of her cheeks\nas was presented to it, and seemed to have added sparkle to eyes that\nwere of darkest blue.\n\nAndre-Louis and M. de Vilmorin had been known to her from childhood. The\nthree had been playmates once, and Andre-Louis--in view of his spiritual\nrelationship with her uncle--she called her cousin. The cousinly\nrelations had persisted between these two long after Philippe de\nVilmorin had outgrown the earlier intimacy, and had become to her\nMonsieur de Vilmorin.\n\nShe waved her hand to them in greeting as they advanced, and stood--an\nentrancing picture, and fully conscious of it--to await them at the end\nof the terrace nearest the short avenue by which they approached.\n\n\"If you come to see monsieur my uncle, you come inopportunely,\nmessieurs,\" she told them, a certain feverishness in her air. \"He is\nclosely--oh, so very closely--engaged.\"\n\n\"We will wait, mademoiselle,\" said M. de Vilmorin, bowing gallantly over\nthe hand she extended to him. \"Indeed, who would haste to the uncle that\nmay tarry a moment with the niece?\"\n\n\"M. l'abbe,\" she teased him, \"when you are in orders I shall take you\nfor my confessor. You have so ready and sympathetic an understanding.\"\n\n\"But no curiosity,\" said Andre-Louis. \"You haven't thought of that.\"\n\n\"I wonder what you mean, Cousin Andre.\"\n\n\"Well you may,\" laughed Philippe. \"For no one ever knows.\" And then,\nhis glance straying across the terrace settled upon a carriage that was\ndrawn up before the door of the chateau. It was a vehicle such as was\noften to be seen in the streets of a great city, but rarely in the\ncountry. It was a beautifully sprung two-horse cabriolet of walnut,\nwith a varnish upon it like a sheet of glass and little pastoral scenes\nexquisitely painted on the panels of the door. It was built to carry two\npersons, with a box in front for the coachman, and a stand behind for\nthe footman. This stand was empty, but the footman paced before the\ndoor, and as he emerged now from behind the vehicle into the range of M.\nde Vilmorin's vision, he displayed the resplendent blue-and-gold livery\nof the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr.\n\n\"Why!\" he exclaimed. \"Is it M. de La Tour d'Azyr who is with your\nuncle?\"\n\n\"It is, monsieur,\" said she, a world of mystery in voice and eyes, of\nwhich M. de Vilmorin observed nothing.\n\n\"Ah, pardon!\" he bowed low, hat in hand. \"Serviteur, mademoiselle,\" and\nhe turned to depart towards the house.\n\n\"Shall I come with you, Philippe?\" Andre-Louis called after him.\n\n\"It would be ungallant to assume that you would prefer it,\" said M. de\nVilmorin, with a glance at mademoiselle. \"Nor do I think it would serve.\nIf you will wait...\"\n\nM. de Vilmorin strode off. Mademoiselle, after a moment's blank pause,\nlaughed ripplingly. \"Now where is he going in such a hurry?\"\n\n\"To see M. de La Tour d'Azyr as well as your uncle, I should say.\"\n\n\"But he cannot. They cannot see him. Did I not say that they are\nvery closely engaged? You don't ask me why, Andre.\" There was an arch\nmysteriousness about her, a latent something that may have been elation\nor amusement, or perhaps both. Andre-Louis could not determine it.\n\n\"Since obviously you are all eagerness to tell, why should I ask?\" quoth\nhe.\n\n\"If you are caustic I shall not tell you even if you ask. Oh, yes, I\nwill. It will teach you to treat me with the respect that is my due.\"\n\n\"I hope I shall never fail in that.\"\n\n\"Less than ever when you learn that I am very closely concerned in the\nvisit of M. de La Tour d'Azyr. I am the object of this visit.\" And she\nlooked at him with sparkling eyes and lips parted in laughter.\n\n\"The rest, you would seem to imply, is obvious. But I am a dolt, if you\nplease; for it is not obvious to me.\"\n\n\"Why, stupid, he comes to ask my hand in marriage.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" said Andre-Louis, and stared at her, chapfallen.\n\nShe drew back from him a little with a frown and an upward tilt of her\nchin. \"It surprises you?\"\n\n\"It disgusts me,\" said he, bluntly. \"In fact, I don't believe it. You\nare amusing yourself with me.\"\n\nFor a moment she put aside her visible annoyance to remove his doubts.\n\"I am quite serious, monsieur. There came a formal letter to my uncle\nthis morning from M. de La Tour d'Azyr, announcing the visit and its\nobject. I will not say that it did not surprise us a little...\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" cried Andre-Louis, in relief. \"I understand. For a moment I\nhad almost feared...\" He broke off, looked at her, and shrugged.\n\n\"Why do you stop? You had almost feared that Versailles had been wasted\nupon me. That I should permit the court-ship of me to be conducted like\nthat of any village wench. It was stupid of you. I am being sought in\nproper form, at my uncle's hands.\"\n\n\"Is his consent, then, all that matters, according to Versailles?\"\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"There is your own.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"I am a dutiful niece... when it suits me.\"\n\n\"And will it suit you to be dutiful if your uncle accepts this monstrous\nproposal?\"\n\n\"Monstrous!\" She bridled. \"And why monstrous, if you please?\"\n\n\"For a score of reasons,\" he answered irritably.\n\n\"Give me one,\" she challenged him.\n\n\"He is twice your age.\"\n\n\"Hardly so much,\" said she.\n\n\"He is forty-five, at least.\"\n\n\"But he looks no more than thirty. He is very handsome--so much you will\nadmit; nor will you deny that he is very wealthy and very powerful; the\ngreatest nobleman in Brittany. He will make me a great lady.\"\n\n\"God made you that, Aline.\"\n\n\"Come, that's better. Sometimes you can almost be polite.\" And she moved\nalong the terrace, Andre-Louis pacing beside her.\n\n\"I can be more than that to show reason why you should not let this\nbeast befoul the beautiful thing that God has made.\"\n\nShe frowned, and her lips tightened. \"You are speaking of my future\nhusband,\" she reproved him.\n\nHis lips tightened too; his pale face grew paler.\n\n\"And is it so? It is settled, then? Your uncle is to agree? You are to\nbe sold thus, lovelessly, into bondage to a man you do not know. I had\ndreamed of better things for you, Aline.\"\n\n\"Better than to be Marquise de La Tour d'Azyr?\"\n\nHe made a gesture of exasperation. \"Are men and women nothing more than\nnames? Do the souls of them count for nothing? Is there no joy in life,\nno happiness, that wealth and pleasure and empty, high-sounding titles\nare to be its only aims? I had set you high--so high, Aline--a thing\nscarce earthly. There is joy in your heart, intelligence in your mind;\nand, as I thought, the vision that pierces husks and shams to claim the\ncore of reality for its own. Yet you will surrender all for a parcel of\nmake-believe. You will sell your soul and your body to be Marquise de La\nTour d'Azyr.\"\n\n\"You are indelicate,\" said she, and though she frowned her eyes laughed.\n\"And you go headlong to conclusions. My uncle will not consent to more\nthan to allow my consent to be sought. We understand each other, my\nuncle and I. I am not to be bartered like a turnip.\"\n\nHe stood still to face her, his eyes glowing, a flush creeping into his\npale cheeks.\n\n\"You have been torturing me to amuse yourself!\" he cried. \"Ah, well, I\nforgive you out of my relief.\"\n\n\"Again you go too fast, Cousin Andre I have permitted my uncle to\nconsent that M. le Marquis shall make his court to me. I like the look\nof the gentleman. I am flattered by his preference when I consider his\neminence. It is an eminence that I may find it desirable to share. M. le\nMarquis does not look as if he were a dullard. It should be interesting\nto be wooed by him. It may be more interesting still to marry him, and\nI think, when all is considered, that I shall probably--very\nprobably--decide to do so.\"\n\nHe looked at her, looked at the sweet, challenging loveliness of that\nchildlike face so tightly framed in the oval of white fur, and all the\nlife seemed to go out of his own countenance.\n\n\"God help you, Aline!\" he groaned.\n\nShe stamped her foot. He was really very exasperating, and something\npresumptuous too, she thought.\n\n\"You are insolent, monsieur.\"\n\n\"It is never insolent to pray, Aline. And I did no more than pray, as I\nshall continue to do. You'll need my prayers, I think.\"\n\n\"You are insufferable!\" She was growing angry, as he saw by the\ndeepening frown, the heightened colour.\n\n\"That is because I suffer. Oh, Aline, little cousin, think well of what\nyou do; think well of the realities you will be bartering for these\nshams--the realities that you will never know, because these cursed shams\nwill block your way to them. When M. de La Tour d'Azyr comes to make his\ncourt, study him well; consult your fine instincts; leave your own noble\nnature free to judge this animal by its intuitions. Consider that...\"\n\n\"I consider, monsieur, that you presume upon the kindness I have always\nshown you. You abuse the position of toleration in which you stand. Who\nare you? What are you, that you should have the insolence to take this\ntone with me?\"\n\nHe bowed, instantly his cold, detached self again, and resumed the\nmockery that was his natural habit.\n\n\"My congratulations, mademoiselle, upon the readiness with which you\nbegin to adapt yourself to the great role you are to play.\"\n\n\"Do you adapt yourself also, monsieur,\" she retorted angrily, and turned\nher shoulder to him.\n\n\"To be as the dust beneath the haughty feet of Madame la Marquise. I\nhope I shall know my place in future.\"\n\nThe phrase arrested her. She turned to him again, and he perceived that\nher eyes were shining now suspiciously. In an instant the mockery in him\nwas quenched in contrition.\n\n\"Lord, what a beast I am, Aline!\" he cried, as he advanced. \"Forgive me\nif you can.\"\n\nAlmost had she turned to sue forgiveness from him. But his contrition\nremoved the need.\n\n\"I'll try,\" said she, \"provided that you undertake not to offend again.\"\n\n\"But I shall,\" said he. \"I am like that. I will fight to save you, from\nyourself if need be, whether you forgive me or not.\"\n\nThey were standing so, confronting each other a little breathlessly, a\nlittle defiantly, when the others issued from the porch.\n\nFirst came the Marquis of La Tour d'Azyr, Count of Solz, Knight of the\nOrders of the Holy Ghost and Saint Louis, and Brigadier in the armies\nof the King. He was a tall, graceful man, upright and soldierly of\ncarriage, with his head disdainfully set upon his shoulders. He was\nmagnificently dressed in a full-skirted coat of mulberry velvet that was\nlaced with gold. His waistcoat, of velvet too, was of a golden\napricot colour; his breeches and stockings were of black silk, and his\nlacquered, red-heeled shoes were buckled in diamonds. His powdered hair\nwas tied behind in a broad ribbon of watered silk; he carried a little\nthree-cornered hat under his arm, and a gold-hilted slender dress-sword\nhung at his side.\n\nConsidering him now in complete detachment, observing the magnificence\nof him, the elegance of his movements, the great air, blending in so\nextraordinary a manner disdain and graciousness, Andre-Louis trembled\nfor Aline. Here was a practised, irresistible wooer, whose bonnes\nfortunes were become a by-word, a man who had hitherto been the despair\nof dowagers with marriageable daughters, and the desolation of husbands\nwith attractive wives.\n\nHe was immediately followed by M. de Kercadiou, in completest contrast.\nOn legs of the shortest, the Lord of Gavrillac carried a body that at\nforty-five was beginning to incline to corpulence and an enormous head\ncontaining an indifferent allotment of intelligence. His countenance\nwas pink and blotchy, liberally branded by the smallpox which had almost\nextinguished him in youth. In dress he was careless to the point\nof untidiness, and to this and to the fact that he had never\nmarried--disregarding the first duty of a gentleman to provide himself\nwith an heir--he owed the character of misogynist attributed to him by\nthe countryside.\n\nAfter M. de Kercadiou came M. de Vilmorin, very pale and self-contained,\nwith tight lips and an overcast brow.\n\nTo meet them, there stepped from the carriage a very elegant young\ngentleman, the Chevalier de Chabrillane, M. de La Tour d'Azyr's\ncousin, who whilst awaiting his return had watched with considerable\ninterest--his own presence unsuspected--the perambulations of Andre-Louis\nand mademoiselle.\n\nPerceiving Aline, M. de La Tour d'Azyr detached himself from the others,\nand lengthening his stride came straight across the terrace to her.\n\nTo Andre-Louis the Marquis inclined his head with that mixture of\ncourtliness and condescension which he used. Socially, the young lawyer\nstood in a curious position. By virtue of the theory of his birth, he\nranked neither as noble nor as simple, but stood somewhere between the\ntwo classes, and whilst claimed by neither he was used familiarly\nby both. Coldly now he returned M. de La Tour d'Azyr's greeting, and\ndiscreetly removed himself to go and join his friend.\n\nThe Marquis took the hand that mademoiselle extended to him, and bowing\nover it, bore it to his lips.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he said, looking into the blue depths of her eyes, that\nmet his gaze smiling and untroubled, \"monsieur your uncle does me the\nhonour to permit that I pay my homage to you. Will you, mademoiselle,\ndo me the honour to receive me when I come to-morrow? I shall have\nsomething of great importance for your ear.\"\n\n\"Of importance, M. le Marquis? You almost frighten me.\" But there was\nno fear on the serene little face in its furred hood. It was not\nfor nothing that she had graduated in the Versailles school of\nartificialities.\n\n\"That,\" said he, \"is very far from my design.\"\n\n\"But of importance to yourself, monsieur, or to me?\"\n\n\"To us both, I hope,\" he answered her, a world of meaning in his fine,\nardent eyes.\n\n\"You whet my curiosity, monsieur; and, of course, I am a dutiful niece.\nIt follows that I shall be honoured to receive you.\"\n\n\"Not honoured, mademoiselle; you will confer the honour. To-morrow at\nthis hour, then, I shall have the felicity to wait upon you.\"\n\nHe bowed again; and again he bore her fingers to his lips, what time she\ncurtsied. Thereupon, with no more than this formal breaking of the ice,\nthey parted.\n\nShe was a little breathless now, a little dazzled by the beauty of the\nman, his princely air, and the confidence of power he seemed to radiate.\nInvoluntarily almost, she contrasted him with his critic--the lean and\nimpudent Andre-Louis in his plain brown coat and steel-buckled shoes--and\nshe felt guilty of an unpardonable offence in having permitted even one\nword of that presumptuous criticism. To-morrow M. le Marquis would\ncome to offer her a great position, a great rank. And already she had\nderogated from the increase of dignity accruing to her from his very\nintention to translate her to so great an eminence. Not again would\nshe suffer it; not again would she be so weak and childish as to permit\nAndre-Louis to utter his ribald comments upon a man by comparison with\nwhom he was no better than a lackey.\n\nThus argued vanity and ambition with her better self and to her vast\nannoyance her better self would not admit entire conviction.\n\nMeanwhile, M. de La Tour d'Azyr was climbing into his carriage. He had\nspoken a word of farewell to M. de Kercadiou, and he had also had a\nword for M. de Vilmorin in reply to which M. de Vilmorin had bowed in\nassenting silence. The carriage rolled away, the powdered footman in\nblue-and-gold very stiff behind it, M. de La Tour d'Azyr bowing to\nmademoiselle, who waved to him in answer.\n\nThen M. de Vilmorin put his arm through that of Andre Louis, and said to\nhim, \"Come, Andre.\"\n\n\"But you'll stay to dine, both of you!\" cried the hospitable Lord of\nGavrillac. \"We'll drink a certain toast,\" he added, winking an eye that\nstrayed towards mademoiselle, who was approaching. He had no subtleties,\ngood soul that he was.\n\nM. de Vilmorin deplored an appointment that prevented him doing himself\nthe honour. He was very stiff and formal.\n\n\"And you, Andre?\"\n\n\"I? Oh, I share the appointment, godfather,\" he lied, \"and I have a\nsuperstition against toasts.\" He had no wish to remain. He was angry\nwith Aline for her smiling reception of M. de La Tour d'Azyr and the\nsordid bargain he saw her set on making. He was suffering from the loss\nof an illusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE ELOQUENCE OF M. DE VILMORIN\n\nAs they walked down the hill together, it was now M. de Vilmorin who\nwas silent and preoccupied, Andre-Louis who was talkative. He had\nchosen Woman as a subject for his present discourse. He claimed--quite\nunjustifiably--to have discovered Woman that morning; and the things he\nhad to say of the sex were unflattering, and occasionally almost gross.\nM. de Vilmorin, having ascertained the subject, did not listen. Singular\nthough it may seem in a young French abbe of his day, M. de Vilmorin was\nnot interested in Woman. Poor Philippe was in several ways exceptional.\nOpposite the Breton arme--the inn and posting-house at the entrance of\nthe village of Gavrillac--M. de Vilmorin interrupted his companion just\nas he was soaring to the dizziest heights of caustic invective, and\nAndre-Louis, restored thereby to actualities, observed the carriage of\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr standing before the door of the hostelry.\n\n\"I don't believe you've been listening to me,\" said he.\n\n\"Had you been less interested in what you were saying, you might have\nobserved it sooner and spared your breath. The fact is, you disappoint\nme, Andre. You seem to have forgotten what we went for. I have an\nappointment here with M. le Marquis. He desires to hear me further in\nthe matter. Up there at Gavrillac I could accomplish nothing. The time\nwas ill-chosen as it happened. But I have hopes of M. le Marquis.\"\n\n\"Hopes of what?\"\n\n\"That he will make what reparation lies in his power. Provide for the\nwidow and the orphans. Why else should he desire to hear me further?\"\n\n\"Unusual condescension,\" said Andre-Louis, and quoted \"Timeo Danaos et\ndona ferentes.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Philippe.\n\n\"Let us go and discover--unless you consider that I shall be in the way.\"\n\nInto a room on the right, rendered private to M. le Marquis for so long\nas he should elect to honour it, the young men were ushered by the host.\nA fire of logs was burning brightly at the room's far end, and by\nthis sat now M. de La Tour d'Azyr and his cousin, the Chevalier de\nChabrillane. Both rose as M. de Vilmorin came in. Andre-Louis following,\npaused to close the door.\n\n\"You oblige me by your prompt courtesy, M. de Vilmorin,\" said the\nMarquis, but in a tone so cold as to belie the politeness of his words.\n\"A chair, I beg. Ah, Moreau?\" The note was frigidly interrogative. \"He\naccompanies you, monsieur?\" he asked.\n\n\"If you please, M. le Marquis.\"\n\n\"Why not? Find yourself a seat, Moreau.\" He spoke over his shoulder as\nto a lackey.\n\n\"It is good of you, monsieur,\" said Philippe, \"to have offered me this\nopportunity of continuing the subject that took me so fruitlessly, as it\nhappens, to Gavrillac.\"\n\nThe Marquis crossed his legs, and held one of his fine hands to the\nblaze. He replied, without troubling to turn to the young man, who was\nslightly behind him.\n\n\"The goodness of my request we will leave out of question for the\nmoment,\" said he, darkly, and M. de Chabrillane laughed. Andre-Louis\nthought him easily moved to mirth, and almost envied him the faculty.\n\n\"But I am grateful,\" Philippe insisted, \"that you should condescend to\nhear me plead their cause.\"\n\nThe Marquis stared at him over his shoulder. \"Whose cause?\" quoth he.\n\n\"Why, the cause of the widow and orphans of this unfortunate Mabey.\"\n\nThe Marquis looked from Vilmorin to the Chevalier, and again the\nChevalier laughed, slapping his leg this time.\n\n\"I think,\" said M. de La Tour d'Azyr, slowly, \"that we are at\ncross-purposes. I asked you to come here because the Chateau de\nGavrillac was hardly a suitable place in which to carry our discussion\nfurther, and because I hesitated to incommode you by suggesting that you\nshould come all the way to Azyr. But my object is connected with certain\nexpressions that you let fall up there. It is on the subject of those\nexpressions, monsieur, that I would hear you further--if you will honour\nme.\"\n\nAndre-Louis began to apprehend that there was something sinister in the\nair. He was a man of quick intuitions, quicker far than those of M. de\nVilmorin, who evinced no more than a mild surprise.\n\n\"I am at a loss, monsieur,\" said he. \"To what expressions does monsieur\nallude?\"\n\n\"It seems, monsieur, that I must refresh your memory.\" The Marquis\ncrossed his legs, and swung sideways on his chair, so that at last he\ndirectly faced M. de Vilmorin. \"You spoke, monsieur--and however mistaken\nyou may have been, you spoke very eloquently, too eloquently almost, it\nseemed to me--of the infamy of such a deed as the act of summary justice\nupon this thieving fellow Mabey, or whatever his name may be. Infamy was\nthe precise word you used. You did not retract that word when I had the\nhonour to inform you that it was by my orders that my gamekeeper Benet\nproceeded as he did.\"\n\n\"If,\" said M. de Vilmorin, \"the deed was infamous, its infamy is not\nmodified by the rank, however exalted, of the person responsible. Rather\nis it aggravated.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said M. le Marquis, and drew a gold snuffbox from his pocket. \"You\nsay, 'if the deed was infamous,' monsieur. Am I to understand that you\nare no longer as convinced as you appeared to be of its infamy?\"\n\nM. de Vilmorin's fine face wore a look of perplexity. He did not\nunderstand the drift of this.\n\n\"It occurs to me, M. le Marquis, in view of your readiness to assume\nresponsibility, that you must believe justification for the deed which\nis not apparent to myself.\"\n\n\"That is better. That is distinctly better.\" The Marquis took snuff\ndelicately, dusting the fragments from the fine lace at his throat. \"You\nrealize that with an imperfect understanding of these matters, not being\nyourself a landowner, you may have rushed to unjustifiable conclusions.\nThat is indeed the case. May it be a warning to you, monsieur. When\nI tell you that for months past I have been annoyed by similar\ndepredations, you will perhaps understand that it had become necessary\nto employ a deterrent sufficiently strong to put an end to them. Now\nthat the risk is known, I do not think there will be any more prowling\nin my coverts. And there is more in it than that, M. de Vilmorin. It is\nnot the poaching that annoys me so much as the contempt for my absolute\nand inviolable rights. There is, monsieur, as you cannot fail to have\nobserved, an evil spirit of insubordination in the air, and there is\none only way in which to meet it. To tolerate it, in however slight\na degree, to show leniency, however leniently disposed, would entail\nhaving recourse to still harsher measures to-morrow. You understand me,\nI am sure, and you will also, I am sure, appreciate the condescension\nof what amounts to an explanation from me where I cannot admit that any\nexplanations were due. If anything in what I have said is still obscure\nto you, I refer you to the game laws, which your lawyer friend there\nwill expound for you at need.\"\n\nWith that the gentleman swung round again to face the fire. It appeared\nto convey the intimation that the interview was at an end. And yet this\nwas not by any means the intimation that it conveyed to the watchful,\npuzzled, vaguely uneasy Andre-Louis. It was, thought he, a very curious,\na very suspicious oration. It affected to explain, with a politeness of\nterms and a calculated insolence of tone; whilst in fact it could only\nserve to stimulate and goad a man of M. de Vilmorin's opinions. And that\nis precisely what it did. He rose.\n\n\"Are there in the world no laws but game laws?\" he demanded, angrily.\n\"Have you never by any chance heard of the laws of humanity?\"\n\nThe Marquis sighed wearily. \"What have I to do with the laws of\nhumanity?\" he wondered.\n\nM. de Vilmorin looked at him a moment in speechless amazement.\n\n\"Nothing, M. le Marquis. That is--alas!--too obvious. I hope you will\nremember it in the hour when you may wish to appeal to those laws which\nyou now deride.\"\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr threw back his head sharply, his high-bred face\nimperious.\n\n\"Now what precisely shall that mean? It is not the first time to-day\nthat you have made use of dark sayings that I could almost believe to\nveil the presumption of a threat.\"\n\n\"Not a threat, M. le Marquis--a warning. A warning that such deeds as\nthese against God's creatures... Oh, you may sneer, monsieur, but they\nare God's creatures, even as you or I--neither more nor less, deeply\nthough the reflection may wound your pride, In His eyes...\"\n\n\"Of your charity, spare me a sermon, M. l'abbe!\"\n\n\"You mock, monsieur. You laugh. Will you laugh, I wonder, when God\npresents His reckoning to you for the blood and plunder with which your\nhands are full?\"\n\n\"Monsieur!\" The word, sharp as the crack of a whip, was from M.\nde Chabrillane, who bounded to his feet. But instantly the Marquis\nrepressed him.\n\n\"Sit down, Chevalier. You are interrupting M. l'abbe, and I should like\nto hear him further. He interests me profoundly.\"\n\nIn the background Andre-Louis, too, had risen, brought to his feet by\nalarm, by the evil that he saw written on the handsome face of M. de La\nTour d'Azyr. He approached, and touched his friend upon the arm.\n\n\"Better be going, Philippe,\" said he.\n\nBut M. de Vilmorin, caught in the relentless grip of passions long\nrepressed, was being hurried by them recklessly along.\n\n\"Oh, monsieur,\" said he, \"consider what you are and what you will be.\nConsider how you and your kind live by abuses, and consider the harvest\nthat abuses must ultimately bring.\"\n\n\"Revolutionist!\" said M. le Marquis, contemptuously. \"You have the\neffrontery to stand before my face and offer me this stinking cant of\nyour modern so-called intellectuals!\"\n\n\"Is it cant, monsieur? Do you think--do you believe in your soul--that\nit is cant? Is it cant that the feudal grip is on all things that live,\ncrushing them like grapes in the press, to its own profit? Does it not\nexercise its rights upon the waters of the river, the fire that bakes\nthe poor man's bread of grass and barley, on the wind that turns the\nmill? The peasant cannot take a step upon the road, cross a crazy bridge\nover a river, buy an ell of cloth in the village market, without meeting\nfeudal rapacity, without being taxed in feudal dues. Is not that enough,\nM. le Marquis? Must you also demand his wretched life in payment for the\nleast infringement of your sacred privileges, careless of what widows\nor orphans you dedicate to woe? Will naught content you but that your\nshadow must lie like a curse upon the land? And do you think in your\npride that France, this Job among the nations, will suffer it forever?\"\n\nHe paused as if for a reply. But none came. The Marquis considered him,\nstrangely silent, a half smile of disdain at the corners of his lips, an\nominous hardness in his eyes.\n\nAgain Andre-Louis tugged at his friend's sleeve.\n\n\"Philippe.\"\n\nPhilippe shook him off, and plunged on, fanatically.\n\n\"Do you see nothing of the gathering clouds that herald the coming of\nthe storm? You imagine, perhaps, that these States General summoned\nby M. Necker, and promised for next year, are to do nothing but devise\nfresh means of extortion to liquidate the bankruptcy of the State?\nYou delude yourselves, as you shall find. The Third Estate, which you\ndespise, will prove itself the preponderating force, and it will find\na way to make an end of this canker of privilege that is devouring the\nvitals of this unfortunate country.\"\n\nM. le Marquis shifted in his chair, and spoke at last.\n\n\"You have, monsieur,\" said he, \"a very dangerous gift of eloquence. And\nit is of yourself rather than of your subject. For after all, what\ndo you offer me? A rechauffe of the dishes served to out-at-elbow\nenthusiasts in the provincial literary chambers, compounded of the\neffusions of your Voltaires and Jean-Jacques and such dirty-fingered\nscribblers. You have not among all your philosophers one with the wit to\nunderstand that we are an order consecrated by antiquity, that for our\nrights and privileges we have behind us the authority of centuries.\"\n\n\"Humanity, monsieur,\" Philippe replied, \"is more ancient than nobility.\nHuman rights are contemporary with man.\"\n\nThe Marquis laughed and shrugged.\n\n\"That is the answer I might have expected. It has the right note of cant\nthat distinguishes the philosophers.\"\n\nAnd then M. de Chabrillane spoke.\n\n\"You go a long way round,\" he criticized his cousin, on a note of\nimpatience.\n\n\"But I am getting there,\" he was answered. \"I desired to make quite\ncertain first.\"\n\n\"Faith, you should have no doubt by now.\"\n\n\"I have none.\" The Marquis rose, and turned again to M. de Vilmorin, who\nhad understood nothing of that brief exchange. \"M. l'abbe,\" said he once\nmore, \"you have a very dangerous gift of eloquence. I can conceive of\nmen being swayed by it. Had you been born a gentleman, you would not so\neasily have acquired these false views that you express.\"\n\nM. de Vilmorin stared blankly, uncomprehending.\n\n\"Had I been born a gentleman, do you say?\" quoth he, in a slow,\nbewildered voice. \"But I was born a gentleman. My race is as old, my\nblood as good as yours, monsieur.\"\n\nFrom M. le Marquis there was a slight play of eyebrows, a vague,\nindulgent smile. His dark, liquid eyes looked squarely into the face of\nM. de Vilmorin.\n\n\"You have been deceived in that, I fear.\"\n\n\"Deceived?\"\n\n\"Your sentiments betray the indiscretion of which madame your mother\nmust have been guilty.\"\n\nThe brutally affronting words were sped beyond recall, and the lips that\nhad uttered them, coldly, as if they had been the merest commonplace,\nremained calm and faintly sneering.\n\nA dead silence followed. Andre-Louis' wits were numbed. He stood aghast,\nall thought suspended in him, what time M. de Vilmorin's eyes continued\nfixed upon M. de La Tour d'Azyr's, as if searching there for a meaning\nthat eluded him. Quite suddenly he understood the vile affront. The\nblood leapt to his face, fire blazed in his gentle eyes. A convulsive\nquiver shook him. Then, with an inarticulate cry, he leaned forward, and\nwith his open hand struck M. le Marquis full and hard upon his sneering\nface.\n\nIn a flash M. de Chabrillane was on his feet, between the two men.\n\nToo late Andre-Louis had seen the trap. La Tour d'Azyr's words were but\nas a move in a game of chess, calculated to exasperate his opponent into\nsome such counter-move as this--a counter-move that left him entirely at\nthe other's mercy.\n\nM. le Marquis looked on, very white save where M. de Vilmorin's\nfinger-prints began slowly to colour his face; but he said nothing more.\nInstead, it was M. de Chabrillane who now did the talking, taking up his\npreconcerted part in this vile game.\n\n\"You realize, monsieur, what you have done,\" said he, coldly, to\nPhilippe. \"And you realize, of course, what must inevitably follow.\"\n\nM. de Vilmorin had realized nothing. The poor young man had acted upon\nimpulse, upon the instinct of decency and honour, never counting the\nconsequences. But he realized them now at the sinister invitation of M.\nde Chabrillane, and if he desired to avoid these consequences, it was\nout of respect for his priestly vocation, which strictly forbade such\nadjustments of disputes as M. de Chabrillane was clearly thrusting upon\nhim.\n\nHe drew back. \"Let one affront wipe out the other,\" said he, in a dull\nvoice. \"The balance is still in M. le Marquis's favour. Let that content\nhim.\"\n\n\"Impossible.\" The Chevalier's lips came together tightly. Thereafter he\nwas suavity itself, but very firm. \"A blow has been struck, monsieur. I\nthink I am correct in saying that such a thing has never happened before\nto M. le Marquis in all his life. If you felt yourself affronted, you\nhad but to ask the satisfaction due from one gentleman to another. Your\naction would seem to confirm the assumption that you found so\noffensive. But it does not on that account render you immune from the\nconsequences.\"\n\nIt was, you see, M. de Chabrillane's part to heap coals upon this fire,\nto make quite sure that their victim should not escape them.\n\n\"I desire no immunity,\" flashed back the young seminarist, stung by\nthis fresh goad. After all, he was nobly born, and the traditions of his\nclass were strong upon him--stronger far than the seminarist schooling in\nhumility. He owed it to himself, to his honour, to be killed rather than\navoid the consequences of the thing he had done.\n\n\"But he does not wear a sword, messieurs!\" cried Andre Louis, aghast.\n\n\"That is easily amended. He may have the loan of mine.\"\n\n\"I mean, messieurs,\" Andre-Louis insisted, between fear for his friend\nand indignation, \"that it is not his habit to wear a sword, that he has\nnever worn one, that he is untutored in its uses. He is a seminarist--a\npostulant for holy orders, already half a priest, and so forbidden from\nsuch an engagement as you propose.\"\n\n\"All that he should have remembered before he struck a blow,\" said M. de\nChabrillane, politely.\n\n\"The blow was deliberately provoked,\" raged Andre-Louis. Then he\nrecovered himself, though the other's haughty stare had no part in\nthat recovery. \"O my God, I talk in vain! How is one to argue against a\npurpose formed! Come away, Philippe. Don't you see the trap...\"\n\nM. de Vilmorin cut him short, and flung him off. \"Be quiet, Andre. M. le\nMarquis is entirely in the right.\"\n\n\"M. le Marquis is in the right?\" Andre-Louis let his arms fall\nhelplessly. This man he loved above all other living men was caught in\nthe snare of the world's insanity. He was baring his breast to the knife\nfor the sake of a vague, distorted sense of the honour due to himself.\nIt was not that he did not see the trap. It was that his honour\ncompelled him to disdain consideration of it. To Andre-Louis in that\nmoment he seemed a singularly tragic figure. Noble, perhaps, but very\npitiful.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE HERITAGE\n\nIt was M. de Vilmorin's desire that the matter should be settled out\nof hand. In this he was at once objective and subjective. A prey to\nemotions sadly at conflict with his priestly vocation, he was above\nall in haste to have done, so that he might resume a frame of mind more\nproper to it. Also he feared himself a little; by which I mean that his\nhonour feared his nature. The circumstances of his education, and the\ngoal that for some years now he had kept in view, had robbed him of much\nof that spirited brutality that is the birthright of the male. He had\ngrown timid and gentle as a woman. Aware of it, he feared that once the\nheat of his passion was spent he might betray a dishonouring weakness,\nin the ordeal.\n\nM. le Marquis, on his side, was no less eager for an immediate\nsettlement; and since they had M. de Chabrillane to act for his cousin,\nand Andre-Louis to serve as witness for M. de Vilmorin, there was\nnothing to delay them.\n\nAnd so, within a few minutes, all arrangements were concluded, and you\nbehold that sinisterly intentioned little group of four assembled in\nthe afternoon sunshine on the bowling-green behind the inn. They were\nentirely private, screened more or less from the windows of the house by\na ramage of trees, which, if leafless now, was at least dense enough to\nprovide an effective lattice.\n\nThere were no formalities over measurements of blades or selection\nof ground. M. le Marquis removed his sword-belt and scabbard, but\ndeclined--not considering it worth while for the sake of so negligible an\nopponent--to divest himself either of his shoes or his coat. Tall, lithe,\nand athletic, he stood to face the no less tall, but very delicate and\nfrail, M. de Vilmorin. The latter also disdained to make any of the\nusual preparations. Since he recognized that it could avail him nothing\nto strip, he came on guard fully dressed, two hectic spots above the\ncheek-bones burning on his otherwise grey face.\n\nM. de Chabrillane, leaning upon a cane--for he had relinquished his sword\nto M. de Vilmorin--looked on with quiet interest. Facing him on the\nother side of the combatants stood Andre-Louis, the palest of the four,\nstaring from fevered eyes, twisting and untwisting clammy hands.\n\nHis every instinct was to fling himself between the antagonists, to\nprotest against and frustrate this meeting. That sane impulse was\ncurbed, however, by the consciousness of its futility. To calm him, he\nclung to the conviction that the issue could not really be very serious.\nIf the obligations of Philippe's honour compelled him to cross swords\nwith the man he had struck, M. de La Tour d'Azyr's birth compelled him\nno less to do no serious hurt to the unfledged lad he had so grievously\nprovoked. M. le Marquis, after all, was a man of honour. He could intend\nno more than to administer a lesson; sharp, perhaps, but one by which\nhis opponent must live to profit. Andre-Louis clung obstinately to that\nfor comfort.\n\nSteel beat on steel, and the men engaged. The Marquis presented to his\nopponent the narrow edge of his upright body, his knees slightly flexed\nand converted into living springs, whilst M. de Vilmorin stood squarely,\na full target, his knees wooden. Honour and the spirit of fair play\nalike cried out against such a match.\n\nThe encounter was very short, of course. In youth, Philippe had received\nthe tutoring in sword-play that was given to every boy born into his\nstation of life. And so he knew at least the rudiments of what was\nnow expected of him. But what could rudiments avail him here? Three\ndisengages completed the exchanges, and then without any haste the\nMarquis slid his right foot along the moist turf, his long, graceful\nbody extending itself in a lunge that went under M. de Vilmorin's clumsy\nguard, and with the utmost deliberation he drove his blade through the\nyoung man's vitals.\n\nAndre-Louis sprang forward just in time to catch his friend's body under\nthe armpits as it sank. Then, his own legs bending beneath the weight of\nit, he went down with his burden until he was kneeling on the damp turf.\nPhilippe's limp head lay against Andre-Louis' left shoulder; Philippe's\nrelaxed arms trailed at his sides; the blood welled and bubbled from the\nghastly wound to saturate the poor lad's garments.\n\nWith white face and twitching lips, Andre-Louis looked up at M. de La\nTour d'Azyr, who stood surveying his work with a countenance of grave\nbut remorseless interest.\n\n\"You have killed him!\" cried Andre-Louis.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nThe Marquis ran a lace handkerchief along his blade to wipe it. As he\nlet the dainty fabric fall, he explained himself. \"He had, as I told\nhim, a too dangerous gift of eloquence.\"\n\nAnd he turned away, leaving completest understanding with Andre-Louis.\nStill supporting the limp, draining body, the young man called to him.\n\n\"Come back, you cowardly murderer, and make yourself quite safe by\nkilling me too!\"\n\nThe Marquis half turned, his face dark with anger. Then M. de\nChabrillane set a restraining hand upon his arm. Although a party\nthroughout to the deed, the Chevalier was a little appalled now that it\nwas done. He had not the high stomach of M. de La Tour d'Azyr, and he\nwas a good deal younger.\n\n\"Come away,\" he said. \"The lad is raving. They were friends.\"\n\n\"You heard what he said?\" quoth the Marquis.\n\n\"Nor can he, or you, or any man deny it,\" flung back Andre-Louis.\n\"Yourself, monsieur, you made confession when you gave me now the reason\nwhy you killed him. You did it because you feared him.\"\n\n\"If that were true--what, then?\" asked the great gentleman.\n\n\"Do you ask? Do you understand of life and humanity nothing but how to\nwear a coat and dress your hair--oh, yes, and to handle weapons against\nboys and priests? Have you no mind to think, no soul into which you can\nturn its vision? Must you be told that it is a coward's part to kill the\nthing he fears, and doubly a coward's part to kill in this way? Had you\nstabbed him in the back with a knife, you would have shown the courage\nof your vileness. It would have been a vileness undisguised. But you\nfeared the consequences of that, powerful as you are; and so you shelter\nyour cowardice under the pretext of a duel.\"\n\nThe Marquis shook off his cousin's hand, and took a step forward,\nholding now his sword like a whip. But again the Chevalier caught and\nheld him.\n\n\"No, no, Gervais! Let be, in God's name!\"\n\n\"Let him come, monsieur,\" raved Andre-Louis, his voice thick and\nconcentrated. \"Let him complete his coward's work on me, and thus make\nhimself safe from a coward's wages.\"\n\nM. de Chabrillane let his cousin go. He came white to the lips, his eyes\nglaring at the lad who so recklessly insulted him. And then he checked.\nIt may be that he remembered suddenly the relationship in which this\nyoung man was popularly believed to stand to the Seigneur de Gavrillac,\nand the well-known affection in which the Seigneur held him. And so he\nmay have realized that if he pushed this matter further, he might find\nhimself upon the horns of a dilemma. He would be confronted with the\nalternatives of shedding more blood, and so embroiling himself with the\nLord of Gavrillac at a time when that gentleman's friendship was of the\nfirst importance to him, or else of withdrawing with such hurt to his\ndignity as must impair his authority in the countryside hereafter.\n\nBe it so or otherwise, the fact remains that he stopped short; then,\nwith an incoherent ejaculation, between anger and contempt, he tossed\nhis arms, turned on his heel and strode off quickly with his cousin.\n\nWhen the landlord and his people came, they found Andre-Louis, his arms\nabout the body of his dead friend, murmuring passionately into the deaf\near that rested almost against his lips:\n\n\"Philippe! Speak to me, Philippe! Philippe... Don't you hear me? O God\nof Heaven! Philippe!\"\n\nAt a glance they saw that here neither priest nor doctor could avail.\nThe cheek that lay against Andre-Louis's was leaden-hued, the half-open\neyes were glazed, and there was a little froth of blood upon the\nvacuously parted lips.\n\nHalf blinded by tears Andre-Louis stumbled after them when they bore the\nbody into the inn. Upstairs in the little room to which they conveyed\nit, he knelt by the bed, and holding the dead man's hand in both his\nown, he swore to him out of his impotent rage that M. de La Tour d'Azyr\nshould pay a bitter price for this.\n\n\"It was your eloquence he feared, Philippe,\" he said. \"Then if I can\nget no justice for this deed, at least it shall be fruitless to him. The\nthing he feared in you, he shall fear in me. He feared that men might be\nswayed by your eloquence to the undoing of such things as himself. Men\nshall be swayed by it still. For your eloquence and your arguments shall\nbe my heritage from you. I will make them my own. It matters nothing\nthat I do not believe in your gospel of freedom. I know it--every word of\nit; that is all that matters to our purpose, yours and mine. If all else\nfails, your thoughts shall find expression in my living tongue. Thus\nat least we shall have frustrated his vile aim to still the voice he\nfeared. It shall profit him nothing to have your blood upon his soul.\nThat voice in you would never half so relentlessly have hounded him and\nhis as it shall in me--if all else fails.\"\n\nIt was an exulting thought. It calmed him; it soothed his grief, and he\nbegan very softly to pray. And then his heart trembled as he considered\nthat Philippe, a man of peace, almost a priest, an apostle of\nChristianity, had gone to his Maker with the sin of anger on his soul.\nIt was horrible. Yet God would see the righteousness of that anger. And\nin no case--be man's interpretation of Divinity what it might--could that\none sin outweigh the loving good that Philippe had ever practised, the\nnoble purity of his great heart. God after all, reflected Andre-Louis,\nwas not a grand-seigneur.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE LORD OF GAVRILLAC\n\nFor the second time that day Andre-Louis set out for the chateau,\nwalking briskly, and heeding not at all the curious eyes that followed\nhim through the village, and the whisperings that marked his passage\nthrough the people, all agog by now with that day's event in which he\nhad been an actor.\n\nHe was ushered by Benoit, the elderly body-servant, rather\ngrandiloquently called the seneschal, into the ground-floor room known\ntraditionally as the library. It still contained several shelves of\nneglected volumes, from which it derived its title, but implements\nof the chase--fowling-pieces, powder-horns, hunting-bags,\nsheath-knives--obtruded far more prominently than those of study. The\nfurniture was massive, of oak richly carved, and belonging to another\nage. Great massive oak beams crossed the rather lofty whitewashed\nceiling.\n\nHere the squat Seigneur de Gavrillac was restlessly pacing when\nAndre-Louis was introduced. He was already informed, as he announced at\nonce, of what had taken place at the Breton arme. M. de Chabrillane\nhad just left him, and he confessed himself deeply grieved and deeply\nperplexed.\n\n\"The pity of it!\" he said. \"The pity of it!\" He bowed his enormous head.\n\"So estimable a young man, and so full of promise. Ah, this La Tour\nd'Azyr is a hard man, and he feels very strongly in these matters.\nHe may be right. I don't know. I have never killed a man for holding\ndifferent views from mine. In fact, I have never killed a man at all.\nIt isn't in my nature. I shouldn't sleep of nights if I did. But men are\ndifferently made.\"\n\n\"The question, monsieur my godfather,\" said Andre-Louis, \"is what is to\nbe done.\" He was quite calm and self-possessed, but very white.\n\nM. de Kercadiou stared at him blankly out of his pale eyes.\n\n\"Why, what the devil is there to do? From what I am told, Vilmorin went\nso far as to strike M. le Marquis.\"\n\n\"Under the very grossest provocation.\"\n\n\"Which he himself provoked by his revolutionary language. The poor\nlad's head was full of this encyclopaedist trash. It comes of too much\nreading. I have never set much store by books, Andre; and I have never\nknown anything but trouble to come out of learning. It unsettles a man.\nIt complicates his views of life, destroys the simplicity which makes\nfor peace of mind and happiness. Let this miserable affair be a warning\nto you, Andre. You are, yourself, too prone to these new-fashioned\nspeculations upon a different constitution of the social order. You\nsee what comes of it. A fine, estimable young man, the only prop of\nhis widowed mother too, forgets himself, his position, his duty to that\nmother--everything; and goes and gets himself killed like this. It is\ninfernally sad. On my soul it is sad.\" He produced a handkerchief, and\nblew his nose with vehemence.\n\nAndre-Louis felt a tightening of his heart, a lessening of the hopes,\nnever too sanguine, which he had founded upon his godfather.\n\n\"Your criticisms,\" he said, \"are all for the conduct of the dead, and\nnone for that of the murderer. It does not seem possible that you should\nbe in sympathy with such a crime.\"\n\n\"Crime?\" shrilled M. de Kercadiou. \"My God, boy, you are speaking of M.\nde La Tour d'Azyr.\"\n\n\"I am, and of the abominable murder he has committed...\"\n\n\"Stop!\" M. de Kercadiou was very emphatic. \"I cannot permit that you\napply such terms to him. I cannot permit it. M. le Marquis is my friend,\nand is likely very soon to stand in a still closer relationship.\"\n\n\"Notwithstanding this?\" asked Andre-Louis.\n\nM. de Kercadiou was frankly impatient.\n\n\"Why, what has this to do with it? I may deplore it. But I have no\nright to condemn it. It is a common way of adjusting differences between\ngentlemen.\"\n\n\"You really believe that?\"\n\n\"What the devil do you imply, Andre? Should I say a thing that I don't\nbelieve? You begin to make me angry.\"\n\n\"'Thou shalt not kill,' is the King's law as well as God's.\"\n\n\"You are determined to quarrel with me, I think. It was a duel...\"\n\nAndre-Louis interrupted him. \"It is no more a duel than if it had been\nfought with pistols of which only M. le Marquis's was loaded. He invited\nPhilippe to discuss the matter further, with the deliberate intent of\nforcing a quarrel upon him and killing him. Be patient with me, monsieur\nmy god-father. I am not telling you of what I imagine but what M. le\nMarquis himself admitted to me.\"\n\nDominated a little by the young man's earnestness, M. de Kercadiou's\npale eyes fell away. He turned with a shrug, and sauntered over to the\nwindow.\n\n\"It would need a court of honour to decide such an issue. And we have no\ncourts of honour,\" he said.\n\n\"But we have courts of justice.\"\n\nWith returning testiness the seigneur swung round to face him again.\n\"And what court of justice, do you think, would listen to such a plea as\nyou appear to have in mind?\"\n\n\"There is the court of the King's Lieutenant at Rennes.\"\n\n\"And do you think the King's Lieutenant would listen to you?\"\n\n\"Not to me, perhaps, Monsieur. But if you were to bring the plaint...\"\n\n\"I bring the plaint?\" M. de Kercadiou's pale eyes were wide with horror\nof the suggestion.\n\n\"The thing happened here on your domain.\"\n\n\"I bring a plaint against M. de La Tour d'Azyr! You are out of your\nsenses, I think. Oh, you are mad; as mad as that poor friend of yours\nwho has come to this end through meddling in what did not concern him.\nThe language he used here to M. le Marquis on the score of Mabey was\nof the most offensive. Perhaps you didn't know that. It does not at all\nsurprise me that the Marquis should have desired satisfaction.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Andre-Louis, on a note of hopelessness.\n\n\"You see? What the devil do you see?\"\n\n\"That I shall have to depend upon myself alone.\"\n\n\"And what the devil do you propose to do, if you please?\"\n\n\"I shall go to Rennes, and lay the facts before the King's Lieutenant.\"\n\n\"He'll be too busy to see you.\" And M. de Kercadiou's mind swung a\ntrifle inconsequently, as weak minds will. \"There is trouble enough in\nRennes already on the score of these crazy States General, with which\nthe wonderful M. Necker is to repair the finances of the kingdom. As\nif a peddling Swiss bank-clerk, who is also a damned Protestant, could\nsucceed where such men as Calonne and Brienne have failed.\"\n\n\"Good-afternoon, monsieur my godfather,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" was the querulous demand.\n\n\"Home at present. To Rennes in the morning.\"\n\n\"Wait, boy, wait!\" The squat little man rolled forward, affectionate\nconcern on his great ugly face, and he set one of his podgy hands on\nhis godson's shoulder. \"Now listen to me, Andre,\" he reasoned. \"This is\nsheer knight-errantry--moonshine, lunacy. You'll come to no good by it if\nyou persist. You've read 'Don Quixote,' and what happened to him when\nhe went tilting against windmills. It's what will happen to you, neither\nmore nor less. Leave things as they are, my boy. I wouldn't have a\nmischief happen to you.\"\n\nAndre-Louis looked at him, smiling wanly.\n\n\"I swore an oath to-day which it would damn my soul to break.\"\n\n\"You mean that you'll go in spite of anything that I may say?\" Impetuous\nas he was inconsequent, M. de Kercadiou was bristling again. \"Very well,\nthen, go... Go to the devil!\"\n\n\"I will begin with the King's Lieutenant.\"\n\n\"And if you get into the trouble you are seeking, don't come whimpering\nto me for assistance,\" the seigneur stormed. He was very angry now.\n\"Since you choose to disobey me, you can break your empty head against\nthe windmill, and be damned to you.\"\n\nAndre-Louis bowed with a touch of irony, and reached the door.\n\n\"If the windmill should prove too formidable,\" said he, from the\nthreshold, \"I may see what can be done with the wind. Good-bye, monsieur\nmy godfather.\"\n\nHe was gone, and M. de Kercadiou was alone, purple in the face, puzzling\nout that last cryptic utterance, and not at all happy in his mind,\neither on the score of his godson or of M. de La Tour d'Azyr. He was\ndisposed to be angry with them both. He found these headstrong, wilful\nmen who relentlessly followed their own impulses very disturbing and\nirritating. Himself he loved his ease, and to be at peace with his\nneighbours; and that seemed to him so obviously the supreme good of life\nthat he was disposed to brand them as fools who troubled to seek other\nthings.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE WINDMILL\n\nThere was between Nantes and Rennes an established service of three\nstage-coaches weekly in each direction, which for a sum of twenty-four\nlivres--roughly, the equivalent of an English guinea--would carry you the\nseventy and odd miles of the journey in some fourteen hours. Once a week\none of the diligences going in each direction would swerve aside\nfrom the highroad to call at Gavrillac, to bring and take letters,\nnewspapers, and sometimes passengers. It was usually by this coach\nthat Andre-Louis came and went when the occasion offered. At present,\nhowever, he was too much in haste to lose a day awaiting the passing of\nthat diligence. So it was on a horse hired from the Breton arme that he\nset out next morning; and an hour's brisk ride under a grey wintry sky,\nby a half-ruined road through ten miles of flat, uninteresting country,\nbrought him to the city of Rennes.\n\nHe rode across the main bridge over the Vilaine, and so into the upper\nand principal part of that important city of some thirty thousand\nsouls, most of whom, he opined from the seething, clamant crowds that\neverywhere blocked his way, must on this day have taken to the streets.\nClearly Philippe had not overstated the excitement prevailing there.\n\nHe pushed on as best he could, and so came at last to the Place Royale,\nwhere he found the crowd to be most dense. From the plinth of the\nequestrian statue of Louis XV, a white-faced young man was excitedly\naddressing the multitude. His youth and dress proclaimed the student,\nand a group of his fellows, acting as a guard of honour to him, kept the\nimmediate precincts of the statue.\n\nOver the heads of the crowd Andre-Louis caught a few of the phrases\nflung forth by that eager voice.\n\n\"It was the promise of the King... It is the King's authority they\nflout... They arrogate to themselves the whole sovereignty in Brittany.\nThe King has dissolved them... These insolent nobles defying their\nsovereign and the people...\"\n\nHad he not known already, from what Philippe had told him, of the events\nwhich had brought the Third Estate to the point of active revolt, those\nfew phrases would fully have informed him. This popular display of\ntemper was most opportune to his need, he thought. And in the hope that\nit might serve his turn by disposing to reasonableness the mind of the\nKing's Lieutenant, he pushed on up the wide and well-paved Rue Royale,\nwhere the concourse of people began to diminish. He put up his hired\nhorse at the Come de Cerf, and set out again, on foot, to the Palais de\nJustice.\n\nThere was a brawling mob by the framework of poles and scaffoldings\nabout the building cathedral, upon which work had been commenced a year\nago. But he did not pause to ascertain the particular cause of that\ngathering. He strode on, and thus came presently to the handsome\nItalianate palace that was one of the few public edifices that had\nsurvived the devastating fire of sixty years ago.\n\nHe won through with difficulty to the great hall, known as the Salle\ndes Pas Perdus, where he was left to cool his heels for a full half-hour\nafter he had found an usher so condescending as to inform the god who\npresided over that shrine of Justice that a lawyer from Gavrillac humbly\nbegged an audience on an affair of gravity.\n\nThat the god condescended to see him at all was probably due to the\ngrave complexion of the hour. At long length he was escorted up the\nbroad stone staircase, and ushered into a spacious, meagrely furnished\nanteroom, to make one of a waiting crowd of clients, mostly men.\n\nThere he spent another half-hour, and employed the time in considering\nexactly what he should say. This consideration made him realize the\nweakness of the case he proposed to set before a man whose views of law\nand morality were coloured by his social rank.\n\nAt last he was ushered through a narrow but very massive and richly\ndecorated door into a fine, well-lighted room furnished with enough gilt\nand satin to have supplied the boudoir of a lady of fashion.\n\nIt was a trivial setting for a King's Lieutenant, but about the King's\nLieutenant there was--at least to ordinary eyes--nothing trivial. At the\nfar end of the chamber, to the right of one of the tall windows that\nlooked out over the inner court, before a goat-legged writing-table with\nWatteau panels, heavily encrusted with ormolu, sat that exalted being.\nAbove a scarlet coat with an order flaming on its breast, and a billow\nof lace in which diamonds sparkled like drops of water, sprouted the\nmassive powdered head of M. de Lesdiguieres. It was thrown back to scowl\nupon this visitor with an expectant arrogance that made Andre-Louis\nwonder almost was a genuflexion awaited from him.\n\nPerceiving a lean, lantern-jawed young man, with straight, lank black\nhair, in a caped riding-coat of brown cloth, and yellow buckskin\nbreeches, his knee-boots splashed with mud, the scowl upon that august\nvisage deepened until it brought together the thick black eyebrows above\nthe great hooked nose.\n\n\"You announce yourself as a lawyer of Gavrillac with an important\ncommunication,\" he growled. It was a peremptory command to make this\ncommunication without wasting the valuable time of a King's Lieutenant,\nof whose immense importance it conveyed something more than a hint. M.\nde Lesdiguieres accounted himself an imposing personality, and he had\nevery reason to do so, for in his time he had seen many a poor devil\nscared out of all his senses by the thunder of his voice.\n\nHe waited now to see the same thing happen to this youthful lawyer from\nGavrillac. But he waited in vain.\n\nAndre-Louis found him ridiculous. He knew pretentiousness for the\nmask of worthlessness and weakness. And here he beheld pretentiousness\nincarnate. It was to be read in that arrogant poise of the head, that\nscowling brow, the inflexion of that reverberating voice. Even more\ndifficult than it is for a man to be a hero to his valet--who has\nwitnessed the dispersal of the parts that make up the imposing whole--is\nit for a man to be a hero to the student of Man who has witnessed the\nsame in a different sense.\n\nAndre-Louis stood forward boldly--impudently, thought M. de Lesdiguieres.\n\n\"You are His Majesty's Lieutenant here in Brittany,\" he said--and it\nalmost seemed to the august lord of life and death that this fellow had\nthe incredible effrontery to address him as one man speaking to another.\n\"You are the dispenser of the King's high justice in this province.\"\n\nSurprise spread on that handsome, sallow face under the heavily powdered\nwig.\n\n\"Is your business concerned with this infernal insubordination of the\ncanaille?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is not, monsieur.\"\n\nThe black eyebrows rose. \"Then what the devil do you mean by intruding\nupon me at a time when all my attention is being claimed by the obvious\nurgency of this disgraceful affair?\"\n\n\"The affair that brings me is no less disgraceful and no less urgent.\"\n\n\"It will have to wait!\" thundered the great man in a passion, and\ntossing back a cloud of lace from his hand, he reached for the little\nsilver bell upon his table.\n\n\"A moment, monsieur!\" Andre-Louis' tone was peremptory. M. de\nLesdiguieres checked in sheer amazement at its impudence. \"I can state\nit very briefly...\"\n\n\"Haven't I said already...\"\n\n\"And when you have heard it,\" Andre-Louis went on, relentlessly,\ninterrupting the interruption, \"you will agree with me as to its\ncharacter.\"\n\nM. de Lesdiguieres considered him very sternly.\n\n\"What is your name?\" he asked.\n\n\"Andre-Louis Moreau.\"\n\n\"Well, Andre-Louis Moreau, if you can state your plea briefly, I will\nhear you. But I warn you that I shall be very angry if you fail to\njustify the impertinence of this insistence at so inopportune a moment.\"\n\n\"You shall be the judge of that, monsieur,\" said Andre-Louis, and he\nproceeded at once to state his case, beginning with the shooting of\nMabey, and passing thence to the killing of M. de Vilmorin. But he\nwithheld until the end the name of the great gentleman against whom he\ndemanded justice, persuaded that did he introduce it earlier he would\nnot be allowed to proceed.\n\nHe had a gift of oratory of whose full powers he was himself hardly\nconscious yet, though destined very soon to become so. He told his story\nwell, without exaggeration, yet with a force of simple appeal that was\nirresistible. Gradually the great man's face relaxed from its forbidding\nseverity. Interest, warming almost to sympathy, came to be reflected on\nit.\n\n\"And who, sir, is the man you charge with this?\"\n\n\"The Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr.\"\n\nThe effect of that formidable name was immediate. Dismayed anger, and an\narrogance more utter than before, took the place of the sympathy he had\nbeen betrayed into displaying.\n\n\"Who?\" he shouted, and without waiting for an answer, \"Why, here's\nimpudence,\" he stormed on, \"to come before me with such a charge against\na gentleman of M. de La Tour d'Azyr's eminence! How dare you speak of\nhim as a coward....\"\n\n\"I speak of him as a murderer,\" the young man corrected. \"And I demand\njustice against him.\"\n\n\"You demand it, do you? My God, what next?\"\n\n\"That is for you to say, monsieur.\"\n\nIt surprised the great gentleman into a more or less successful effort\nof self-control.\n\n\"Let me warn you,\" said he, acidly, \"that it is not wise to make\nwild accusations against a nobleman. That, in itself, is a punishable\noffence, as you may learn. Now listen to me. In this matter of\nMabey--assuming your statement of it to be exact--the gamekeeper may have\nexceeded his duty; but by so little that it is hardly worth comment.\nConsider, however, that in any case it is not a matter for the King's\nLieutenant, or for any court but the seigneurial court of M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr himself. It is before the magistrates of his own appointing that\nsuch a matter must be laid, since it is matter strictly concerning his\nown seigneurial jurisdiction. As a lawyer you should not need to be told\nso much.\"\n\n\"As a lawyer, I am prepared to argue the point. But, as a lawyer I also\nrealize that if that case were prosecuted, it could only end in the\nunjust punishment of a wretched gamekeeper, who did no more than carry\nout his orders, but who none the less would now be made a scapegoat,\nif scapegoat were necessary. I am not concerned to hang Benet on the\ngallows earned by M. de La Tour d'Azyr.\"\n\nM. de Lesdiguieres smote the table violently. \"My God!\" he cried out, to\nadd more quietly, on a note of menace, \"You are singularly insolent, my\nman.\"\n\n\"That is not my intention, sir, I assure you. I am a lawyer, pleading a\ncase--the case of M. de Vilmorin. It is for his assassination that I have\ncome to beg the King's justice.\"\n\n\"But you yourself have said that it was a duel!\" cried the Lieutenant,\nbetween anger and bewilderment.\n\n\"I have said that it was made to appear a duel. There is a distinction,\nas I shall show, if you will condescend to hear me out.\"\n\n\"Take your own time, sir!\" said the ironical M. de Lesdiguieres, whose\ntenure of office had never yet held anything that remotely resembled\nthis experience.\n\nAndre-Louis took him literally. \"I thank you, sir,\" he answered,\nsolemnly, and submitted his argument. \"It can be shown that M. de\nVilmorin never practised fencing in all his life, and it is notorious\nthat M. de La Tour d'Azyr is an exceptional swordsman. Is it a duel,\nmonsieur, where one of the combatants alone is armed? For it amounts to\nthat on a comparison of their measures of respective skill.\"\n\n\"There has scarcely been a duel fought on which the same trumpery\nargument might not be advanced.\"\n\n\"But not always with equal justice. And in one case, at least, it was\nadvanced successfully.\"\n\n\"Successfully? When was that?\"\n\n\"Ten years ago, in Dauphiny. I refer to the case of M. de Gesvres,\na gentleman of that province, who forced a duel upon M. de la Roche\nJeannine, and killed him. M. de Jeannine was a member of a powerful\nfamily, which exerted itself to obtain justice. It put forward just\nsuch arguments as now obtain against M. de La Tour d'Azyr. As you will\nremember, the judges held that the provocation had proceeded of intent\nfrom M. de Gesvres; they found him guilty of premeditated murder, and he\nwas hanged.\"\n\nM. de Lesdiguieres exploded yet again. \"Death of my life!\" he cried.\n\"Have you the effrontery to suggest that M. de La Tour d'Azyr should be\nhanged? Have you?\"\n\n\"But why not, monsieur, if it is the law, and there is precedent for it,\nas I have shown you, and if it can be established that what I state is\nthe truth--as established it can be without difficulty?\"\n\n\"Do you ask me, why not? Have you temerity to ask me that?\"\n\n\"I have, monsieur. Can you answer me? If you cannot, monsieur, I shall\nunderstand that whilst it is possible for a powerful family like that\nof La Roche Jeannine to set the law in motion, the law must remain inert\nfor the obscure and uninfluential, however brutally wronged by a great\nnobleman.\"\n\nM. de Lesdiguieres perceived that in argument he would accomplish\nnothing against this impassive, resolute young man. The menace of him\ngrew more fierce.\n\n\"I should advise you to take yourself off at once, and to be thankful\nfor the opportunity to depart unscathed.\"\n\n\"I am, then, to understand, monsieur, that there will be no inquiry into\nthis case? That nothing that I can say will move you?\"\n\n\"You are to understand that if you are still there in two minutes it\nwill be very much the worse for you.\" And M. de Lesdiguieres tinkled the\nsilver hand-bell upon his table.\n\n\"I have informed you, monsieur, that a duel--so-called--has been fought,\nand a man killed. It seems that I must remind you, the administrator of\nthe King's justice, that duels are against the law, and that it is\nyour duty to hold an inquiry. I come as the legal representative of the\nbereaved mother of M. de Vilmorin to demand of you the inquiry that is\ndue.\"\n\nThe door behind Andre-Louis opened softly. M. de Lesdiguieres, pale with\nanger, contained himself with difficulty.\n\n\"You seek to compel us, do you, you impudent rascal?\" he growled. \"You\nthink the King's justice is to be driven headlong by the voice of any\nimpudent roturier? I marvel at my own patience with you. But I give you\na last warning, master lawyer; keep a closer guard over that insolent\ntongue of yours, or you will have cause very bitterly to regret its\nglibness.\" He waved a jewelled, contemptuous hand, and spoke to the\nusher standing behind Andre. \"To the door!\" he said, shortly.\n\nAndre-Louis hesitated a second. Then with a shrug he turned. This was\nthe windmill, indeed, and he a poor knight of rueful countenance. To\nattack it at closer quarters would mean being dashed to pieces. Yet on\nthe threshold he turned again.\n\n\"M. de Lesdiguieres,\" said he, \"may I recite to you an interesting fact\nin natural history? The tiger is a great lord in the jungle, and was\nfor centuries the terror of lesser beasts, including the wolf. The wolf,\nhimself a hunter, wearied of being hunted. He took to associating\nwith other wolves, and then the wolves, driven to form packs for\nself-protection, discovered the power of the pack, and took to hunting\nthe tiger, with disastrous results to him. You should study Buffon, M.\nde Lesdiguieres.\"\n\n\"I have studied a buffoon this morning, I think,\" was the punning sneer\nwith which M. de Lesdiguieres replied. But that he conceived himself\nwitty, it is probable he would not have condescended to reply at all. \"I\ndon't understand you,\" he added.\n\n\"But you will, M. de Lesdiguieres. You will,\" said Andre-Louis, and so\ndeparted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE WIND\n\nHe had broken his futile lance with the windmill--the image suggested by\nM. de Kercadiou persisted in his mind--and it was, he perceived, by sheer\ngood fortune that he had escaped without hurt. There remained the wind\nitself--the whirlwind. And the events in Rennes, reflex of the graver\nevents in Nantes, had set that wind blowing in his favour.\n\nHe set out briskly to retrace his steps towards the Place Royale, where\nthe gathering of the populace was greatest, where, as he judged, lay the\nheart and brain of this commotion that was exciting the city.\n\nBut the commotion that he had left there was as nothing to the commotion\nwhich he found on his return. Then there had been a comparative hush\nto listen to the voice of a speaker who denounced the First and Second\nEstates from the pedestal of the statue of Louis XV. Now the air was\nvibrant with the voice of the multitude itself, raised in anger. Here\nand there men were fighting with canes and fists; everywhere a\nfierce excitement raged, and the gendarmes sent thither by the King's\nLieutenant to restore and maintain order were so much helpless flotsam\nin that tempestuous human ocean.\n\nThere were cries of \"To the Palais! To the Palais! Down with the\nassassins! Down with the nobles! To the Palais!\"\n\nAn artisan who stood shoulder to shoulder with him in the press\nenlightened Andre-Louis on the score of the increased excitement.\n\n\"They've shot him dead. His body is lying there where it fell at the\nfoot of the statue. And there was another student killed not an hour ago\nover there by the cathedral works. Pardi! If they can't prevail in one\nway they'll prevail in another.\" The man was fiercely emphatic. \"They'll\nstop at nothing. If they can't overawe us, by God, they'll assassinate\nus. They are determined to conduct these States of Brittany in their own\nway. No interests but their own shall be considered.\"\n\nAndre-Louis left him still talking, and clove himself a way through that\nhuman press.\n\nAt the statue's base he came upon a little cluster of students about the\nbody of the murdered lad, all stricken with fear and helplessness.\n\n\"You here, Moreau!\" said a voice.\n\nHe looked round to find himself confronted by a slight, swarthy man\nof little more than thirty, firm of mouth and impertinent of nose,\nwho considered him with disapproval. It was Le Chapelier, a lawyer\nof Rennes, a prominent member of the Literary Chamber of that city, a\nforceful man, fertile in revolutionary ideas and of an exceptional gift\nof eloquence.\n\n\"Ah, it is you, Chapelier! Why don't you speak to them? Why don't you\ntell them what to do? Up with you, man!\" And he pointed to the plinth.\n\nLe Chapelier's dark, restless eyes searched the other's impassive face\nfor some trace of the irony he suspected. They were as wide asunder\nas the poles, these two, in their political views; and mistrusted as\nAndre-Louis was by all his colleagues of the Literary Chamber of Rennes,\nhe was by none mistrusted so thoroughly as by this vigorous republican.\nIndeed, had Le Chapelier been able to prevail against the influence of\nthe seminarist Vilmorin, Andre-Louis would long since have found himself\nexcluded from that assembly of the intellectual youth of Rennes, which\nhe exasperated by his eternal mockery of their ideals.\n\nSo now Le Chapelier suspected mockery in that invitation, suspected it\neven when he failed to find traces of it on Andre-Louis' face, for he\nhad learnt by experience that it was a face not often to be trusted for\nan indication of the real thoughts that moved behind it.\n\n\"Your notions and mine on that score can hardly coincide,\" said he.\n\n\"Can there be two opinions?\" quoth Andre-Louis.\n\n\"There are usually two opinions whenever you and I are together,\nMoreau--more than ever now that you are the appointed delegate of a\nnobleman. You see what your friends have done. No doubt you approve\ntheir methods.\" He was coldly hostile.\n\nAndre-Louis looked at him without surprise. So invariably opposed to\neach other in academic debates, how should Le Chapelier suspect his\npresent intentions?\n\n\"If you won't tell them what is to be done, I will,\" said he.\n\n\"Nom de Dieu! If you want to invite a bullet from the other side, I\nshall not hinder you. It may help to square the account.\"\n\nScarcely were the words out than he repented them; for as if in answer\nto that challenge Andre-Louis sprang up on to the plinth. Alarmed now,\nfor he could only suppose it to be Andre-Louis' intention to speak\non behalf of Privilege, of which he was a publicly appointed\nrepresentative, Le Chapelier clutched him by the leg to pull him down\nagain.\n\n\"Ah, that, no!\" he was shouting. \"Come down, you fool. Do you think we\nwill let you ruin everything by your clowning? Come down!\"\n\nAndre-Louis, maintaining his position by clutching one of the legs of\nthe bronze horse, flung his voice like a bugle-note over the heads of\nthat seething mob.\n\n\"Citizens of Rennes, the motherland is in danger!\"\n\nThe effect was electric. A stir ran, like a ripple over water, across\nthat froth of upturned human faces, and completest silence followed.\nIn that great silence they looked at this slim young man, hatless,\nlong wisps of his black hair fluttering in the breeze, his neckcloth in\ndisorder, his face white, his eyes on fire.\n\nAndre-Louis felt a sudden surge of exaltation as he realized by instinct\nthat at one grip he had seized that crowd, and that he held it fast in\nthe spell of his cry and his audacity.\n\nEven Le Chapelier, though still clinging to his ankle, had ceased to\ntug. The reformer, though unshaken in his assumption of Andre-Louis'\nintentions, was for a moment bewildered by the first note of his appeal.\n\nAnd then, slowly, impressively, in a voice that travelled clear to the\nends of the square, the young lawyer of Gavrillac began to speak.\n\n\"Shuddering in horror of the vile deed here perpetrated, my voice\ndemands to be heard by you. You have seen murder done under your\neyes--the murder of one who nobly, without any thought of self, gave\nvoice to the wrongs by which we are all oppressed. Fearing that voice,\nshunning the truth as foul things shun the light, our oppressors sent\ntheir agents to silence him in death.\"\n\nLe Chapelier released at last his hold of Andre-Louis' ankle, staring\nup at him the while in sheer amazement. It seemed that the fellow was in\nearnest; serious for once; and for once on the right side. What had come\nto him?\n\n\"Of assassins what shall you look for but assassination? I have a\ntale to tell which will show that this is no new thing that you have\nwitnessed here to-day; it will reveal to you the forces with which you\nhave to deal. Yesterday...\"\n\nThere was an interruption. A voice in the crowd, some twenty paces,\nperhaps, was raised to shout:\n\n\"Yet another of them!\"\n\nImmediately after the voice came a pistol-shot, and a bullet flattened\nitself against the bronze figure just behind Andre-Louis.\n\nInstantly there was turmoil in the crowd, most intense about the spot\nwhence the shot had been fired. The assailant was one of a considerable\ngroup of the opposition, a group that found itself at once beset on\nevery side, and hard put to it to defend him.\n\nFrom the foot of the plinth rang the voice of the students making chorus\nto Le Chapelier, who was bidding Andre-Louis to seek shelter.\n\n\"Come down! Come down at once! They'll murder you as they murdered La\nRiviere.\"\n\n\"Let them!\" He flung wide his arms in a gesture supremely theatrical,\nand laughed. \"I stand here at their mercy. Let them, if they will, add\nmine to the blood that will presently rise up to choke them. Let them\nassassinate me. It is a trade they understand. But until they do so,\nthey shall not prevent me from speaking to you, from telling you what\nis to be looked for in them.\" And again he laughed, not merely in\nexaltation as they supposed who watched him from below, but also in\namusement. And his amusement had two sources. One was to discover how\nglibly he uttered the phrases proper to whip up the emotions of a crowd:\nthe other was in the remembrance of how the crafty Cardinal de Retz, for\nthe purpose of inflaming popular sympathy on his behalf, had been in the\nhabit of hiring fellows to fire upon his carriage. He was in just such\ncase as that arch-politician. True, he had not hired the fellow to fire\nthat pistol-shot; but he was none the less obliged to him, and ready to\nderive the fullest, advantage from the act.\n\nThe group that sought to protect that man was battling on, seeking to\nhew a way out of that angry, heaving press.\n\n\"Let them go!\" Andre-Louis called down...\"What matters one assassin more\nor less? Let them go, and listen to me, my countrymen!\"\n\nAnd presently, when some measure of order was restored, he began his\ntale. In simple language now, yet with a vehemence and directness\nthat drove home every point, he tore their hearts with the story of\nyesterday's happenings at Gavrillac. He drew tears from them with\nthe pathos of his picture of the bereaved widow Mabey and her three\nstarving, destitute children--\"orphaned to avenge the death of a\npheasant\"--and the bereaved mother of that M. de Vilmorin, a student of\nRennes, known here to many of them, who had met his death in a noble\nendeavour to champion the cause of an esurient member of their afflicted\norder.\n\n\"The Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr said of him that he had too dangerous a\ngift of eloquence. It was to silence his brave voice that he killed\nhim. But he has failed of his object. For I, poor Philippe de Vilmorin's\nfriend, have assumed the mantle of his apostleship, and I speak to you\nwith his voice to-day.\"\n\nIt was a statement that helped Le Chapelier at last to understand, at\nleast in part, this bewildering change in Andre-Louis, which rendered\nhim faithless to the side that employed him.\n\n\"I am not here,\" continued Andre-Louis, \"merely to demand at your hands\nvengeance upon Philippe de Vilmorin's murderers. I am here to tell you\nthe things he would to-day have told you had he lived.\"\n\nSo far at least he was frank. But he did not add that they were things\nhe did not himself believe, things that he accounted the cant by which\nan ambitious bourgeoisie--speaking through the mouths of the lawyers, who\nwere its articulate part--sought to overthrow to its own advantage the\npresent state of things. He left his audience in the natural belief that\nthe views he expressed were the views he held.\n\nAnd now in a terrible voice, with an eloquence that amazed himself,\nhe denounced the inertia of the royal justice where the great are the\noffenders. It was with bitter sarcasm that he spoke of their King's\nLieutenant, M. de Lesdiguieres.\n\n\"Do you wonder,\" he asked them, \"that M. de Lesdiguieres should\nadminister the law so that it shall ever be favourable to our great\nnobles? Would it be just, would it be reasonable that he should\notherwise administer it?\" He paused dramatically to let his sarcasm sink\nin. It had the effect of reawakening Le Chapelier's doubts, and checking\nhis dawning conviction in Andre-Louis' sincerity. Whither was he going\nnow?\n\nHe was not left long in doubt. Proceeding, Andre-Louis spoke as he\nconceived that Philippe de Vilmorin would have spoken. He had so often\nargued with him, so often attended the discussions of the Literary\nChamber, that he had all the rant of the reformers--that was yet true in\nsubstance--at his fingers' ends.\n\n\"Consider, after all, the composition of this France of ours. A million\nof its inhabitants are members of the privileged classes. They compose\nFrance. They are France. For surely you cannot suppose the remainder\nto be anything that matters. It cannot be pretended that twenty-four\nmillion souls are of any account, that they can be representative of\nthis great nation, or that they can exist for any purpose but that of\nservitude to the million elect.\"\n\nBitter laughter shook them now, as he desired it should. \"Seeing their\nprivileges in danger of invasion by these twenty-four millions--mostly\ncanailles; possibly created by God, it is true, but clearly so created\nto be the slaves of Privilege--does it surprise you that the dispensing\nof royal justice should be placed in the stout hands of these\nLesdiguieres, men without brains to think or hearts to be touched?\nConsider what it is that must be defended against the assault of us\nothers--canaille. Consider a few of these feudal rights that are in\ndanger of being swept away should the Privileged yield even to the\ncommands of their sovereign; and admit the Third Estate to an equal vote\nwith themselves.\n\n\"What would become of the right of terrage on the land, of parciere on\nthe fruit-trees, of carpot on the vines? What of the corvees by which\nthey command forced labour, of the ban de vendage, which gives them the\nfirst vintage, the banvin which enables them to control to their own\nadvantage the sale of wine? What of their right of grinding the last\nliard of taxation out of the people to maintain their own opulent\nestate; the cens, the lods-et-ventes, which absorb a fifth of the value\nof the land, the blairee, which must be paid before herds can feed on\ncommunal lands, the pulverage to indemnify them for the dust raised on\ntheir roads by the herds that go to market, the sextelage on everything\noffered for sale in the public markets, the etalonnage, and all the\nrest? What of their rights over men and animals for field labour, of\nferries over rivers, and of bridges over streams, of sinking wells, of\nwarren, of dovecot, and of fire, which last yields them a tax on\nevery peasant hearth? What of their exclusive rights of fishing and of\nhunting, the violation of which is ranked as almost a capital offence?\n\n\"And what of other rights, unspeakable, abominable, over the lives and\nbodies of their people, rights which, if rarely exercised, have never\nbeen rescinded. To this day if a noble returning from the hunt were to\nslay two of his serfs to bathe and refresh his feet in their blood, he\ncould still claim in his sufficient defence that it was his absolute\nfeudal right to do so.\n\n\"Rough-shod, these million Privileged ride over the souls and bodies\nof twenty-four million contemptible canaille existing but for their own\npleasure. Woe betide him who so much as raises his voice in protest\nin the name of humanity against an excess of these already excessive\nabuses. I have told you of one remorselessly slain in cold blood for\ndoing no more than that. Your own eyes have witnessed the assassination\nof another here upon this plinth, of yet another over there by the\ncathedral works, and the attempt upon my own life.\n\n\"Between them and the justice due to them in such cases stand these\nLesdiguieres, these King's Lieutenants; not instruments of justice, but\nwalls erected for the shelter of Privilege and Abuse whenever it exceeds\nits grotesquely excessive rights.\n\n\"Do you wonder that they will not yield an inch; that they will resist\nthe election of a Third Estate with the voting power to sweep all these\nprivileges away, to compel the Privileged to submit themselves to a just\nequality in the eyes of the law with the meanest of the canaille they\ntrample underfoot, to provide that the moneys necessary to save this\nstate from the bankruptcy into which they have all but plunged it shall\nbe raised by taxation to be borne by themselves in the same proportion\nas by others?\n\n\"Sooner than yield to so much they prefer to resist even the royal\ncommand.\"\n\nA phrase occurred to him used yesterday by Vilmorin, a phrase to which\nhe had refused to attach importance when uttered then. He used it now.\n\"In doing this they are striking at the very foundations of the throne.\nThese fools do not perceive that if that throne falls over, it is they\nwho stand nearest to it who will be crushed.\"\n\nA terrific roar acclaimed that statement. Tense and quivering with the\nexcitement that was flowing through him, and from him out into that\ngreat audience, he stood a moment smiling ironically. Then he waved\nthem into silence, and saw by their ready obedience how completely he\npossessed them. For in the voice with which he spoke each now recognized\nthe voice of himself, giving at last expression to the thoughts that for\nmonths and years had been inarticulately stirring in each simple mind.\n\nPresently he resumed, speaking more quietly, that ironic smile about the\ncorner of his mouth growing more marked:\n\n\"In taking my leave of M. de Lesdiguieres I gave him warning out of a\npage of natural history. I told him that when the wolves, roaming singly\nthrough the jungle, were weary of being hunted by the tiger, they banded\nthemselves into packs, and went a-hunting the tiger in their turn. M. de\nLesdiguieres contemptuously answered that he did not understand me. But\nyour wits are better than his. You understand me, I think? Don't you?\"\n\nAgain a great roar, mingled now with some approving laughter, was his\nanswer. He had wrought them up to a pitch of dangerous passion, and they\nwere ripe for any violence to which he urged them. If he had failed with\nthe windmill, at least he was now master of the wind.\n\n\"To the Palais!\" they shouted, waving their hands, brandishing canes,\nand--here and there--even a sword. \"To the Palais! Down with M. de\nLesdiguieres! Death to the King's Lieutenant!\"\n\nHe was master of the wind, indeed. His dangerous gift of oratory--a\ngift nowhere more powerful than in France, since nowhere else are men's\nemotions so quick to respond to the appeal of eloquence--had given him\nthis mastery. At his bidding now the gale would sweep away the\nwindmill against which he had flung himself in vain. But that, as he\nstraightforwardly revealed it, was no part of his intent.\n\n\"Ah, wait!\" he bade them. \"Is this miserable instrument of a corrupt\nsystem worth the attention of your noble indignation?\"\n\nHe hoped his words would be reported to M. de Lesdiguieres. He thought\nit would be good for the soul of M. de Lesdiguieres to hear the\nundiluted truth about himself for once.\n\n\"It is the system itself you must attack and overthrow; not a mere\ninstrument--a miserable painted lath such as this. And precipitancy will\nspoil everything. Above all, my children, no violence!\"\n\nMy children! Could his godfather have heard him!\n\n\"You have seen often already the result of premature violence elsewhere\nin Brittany, and you have heard of it elsewhere in France. Violence on\nyour part will call for violence on theirs. They will welcome the chance\nto assert their mastery by a firmer grip than heretofore. The military\nwill be sent for. You will be faced by the bayonets of mercenaries. Do\nnot provoke that, I implore you. Do not put it into their power, do not\nafford them the pretext they would welcome to crush you down into the\nmud of your own blood.\"\n\nOut of the silence into which they had fallen anew broke now the cry of\n\n\"What else, then? What else?\"\n\n\"I will tell you,\" he answered them. \"The wealth and strength of\nBrittany lies in Nantes--a bourgeois city, one of the most prosperous in\nthis realm, rendered so by the energy of the bourgeoisie and the toil of\nthe people. It was in Nantes that this movement had its beginning, and\nas a result of it the King issued his order dissolving the States as now\nconstituted--an order which those who base their power on Privilege and\nAbuse do not hesitate to thwart. Let Nantes be informed of the precise\nsituation, and let nothing be done here until Nantes shall have given us\nthe lead. She has the power--which we in Rennes have not--to make her will\nprevail, as we have seen already. Let her exert that power once more,\nand until she does so do you keep the peace in Rennes. Thus shall you\ntriumph. Thus shall the outrages that are being perpetrated under your\neyes be fully and finally avenged.\"\n\nAs abruptly as he had leapt upon the plinth did he now leap down from\nit. He had finished. He had said all--perhaps more than all--that could\nhave been said by the dead friend with whose voice he spoke. But it was\nnot their will that he should thus extinguish himself. The thunder of\ntheir acclamations rose deafeningly upon the air. He had played upon\ntheir emotions--each in turn--as a skilful harpist plays upon the strings\nof his instrument. And they were vibrant with the passions he had\naroused, and the high note of hope on which he had brought his symphony\nto a close.\n\nA dozen students caught him as he leapt down, and swung him to their\nshoulders, where again he came within view of all the acclaiming crowd.\n\nThe delicate Le Chapelier pressed alongside of him with flushed face and\nshining eyes.\n\n\"My lad,\" he said to him, \"you have kindled a fire to-day that will\nsweep the face of France in a blaze of liberty.\" And then to the\nstudents he issued a sharp command. \"To the Literary Chamber--at once. We\nmust concert measures upon the instant, a delegate must be dispatched\nto Nantes forthwith, to convey to our friends there the message of the\npeople of Rennes.\"\n\nThe crowd fell back, opening a lane through which the students bore\nthe hero of the hour. Waving his hands to them, he called upon them to\ndisperse to their homes, and await there in patience what must follow\nvery soon.\n\n\"You have endured for centuries with a fortitude that is a pattern to\nthe world,\" he flattered them. \"Endure a little longer yet. The end, my\nfriends, is well in sight at last.\"\n\nThey carried him out of the square and up the Rue Royale to an old\nhouse, one of the few old houses surviving in that city that had risen\nfrom its ashes, where in an upper chamber lighted by diamond-shaped\npanes of yellow glass the Literary Chamber usually held its meetings.\nThither in his wake the members of that chamber came hurrying, summoned\nby the messages that Le Chapelier had issued during their progress.\n\nBehind closed doors a flushed and excited group of some fifty men, the\nmajority of whom were young, ardent, and afire with the illusion of\nliberty, hailed Andre-Louis as the strayed sheep who had returned to the\nfold, and smothered him in congratulations and thanks.\n\nThen they settled down to deliberate upon immediate measures, whilst the\ndoors below were kept by a guard of honour that had improvised itself\nfrom the masses. And very necessary was this. For no sooner had the\nChamber assembled than the house was assailed by the gendarmerie of M.\nde Lesdiguieres, dispatched in haste to arrest the firebrand who was\ninciting the people of Rennes to sedition. The force consisted of fifty\nmen. Five hundred would have been too few. The mob broke their carbines,\nbroke some of their heads, and would indeed have torn them into pieces\nhad they not beaten a timely and well-advised retreat before a form of\nhorseplay to which they were not at all accustomed.\n\nAnd whilst that was taking place in the street below, in the room\nabovestairs the eloquent Le Chapelier was addressing his colleagues\nof the Literary Chamber. Here, with no bullets to fear, and no one\nto report his words to the authorities, Le Chapelier could permit his\noratory a full, unintimidated flow. And that considerable oratory was as\ndirect and brutal as the man himself was delicate and elegant.\n\nHe praised the vigour and the greatness of the speech they had heard\nfrom their colleague Moreau. Above all he praised its wisdom. Moreau's\nwords had come as a surprise to them. Hitherto they had never known\nhim as other than a bitter critic of their projects of reform and\nregeneration; and quite lately they had heard, not without misgivings,\nof his appointment as delegate for a nobleman in the States of Brittany.\nBut they held the explanation of his conversion. The murder of their\ndear colleague Vilmorin had produced this change. In that brutal deed\nMoreau had beheld at last in true proportions the workings of that evil\nspirit which they were vowed to exorcise from France. And to-day he had\nproven himself the stoutest apostle among them of the new faith. He had\npointed out to them the only sane and useful course. The illustration he\nhad borrowed from natural history was most apt. Above all, let them pack\nlike the wolves, and to ensure this uniformity of action in the people\nof all Brittany, let a delegate at once be sent to Nantes, which had\nalready proved itself the real seat of Brittany's power. It but remained\nto appoint that delegate, and Le Chapelier invited them to elect him.\n\nAndre-Louis, on a bench near the window, a prey now to some measure of\nreaction, listened in bewilderment to that flood of eloquence.\n\nAs the applause died down, he heard a voice exclaiming:\n\n\"I propose to you that we appoint our leader here, Le Chapelier, to be\nthat delegate.\"\n\nLe Chapelier reared his elegantly dressed head, which had been bowed\nin thought, and it was seen that his countenance was pale. Nervously he\nfingered a gold spy-glass.\n\n\"My friends,\" he said, slowly, \"I am deeply sensible of the honour\nthat you do me. But in accepting it I should be usurping an honour\nthat rightly belongs elsewhere. Who could represent us better, who more\ndeserving to be our representative, to speak to our friends of Nantes\nwith the voice of Rennes, than the champion who once already to-day has\nso incomparably given utterance to the voice of this great city? Confer\nthis honour of being your spokesman where it belongs--upon Andre-Louis\nMoreau.\"\n\nRising in response to the storm of applause that greeted the proposal,\nAndre-Louis bowed and forthwith yielded. \"Be it so,\" he said, simply.\n\"It is perhaps fitting that I should carry out what I have begun, though\nI too am of the opinion that Le Chapelier would have been a worthier\nrepresentative. I will set out to-night.\"\n\n\"You will set out at once, my lad,\" Le Chapelier informed him, and now\nrevealed what an uncharitable mind might account the true source of his\ngenerosity. \"It is not safe after what has happened for you to linger an\nhour in Rennes. And you must go secretly. Let none of you allow it to\nbe known that he has gone. I would not have you come to harm over this,\nAndre-Louis. But you must see the risks you run, and if you are to be\nspared to help in this work of salvation of our afflicted motherland,\nyou must use caution, move secretly, veil your identity even. Or else\nM. de Lesdiguieres will have you laid by the heels, and it will be\ngood-night for you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. OMNES OMNIBUS\n\nAndre-Louis rode forth from Rennes committed to a deeper adventure than\nhe had dreamed of when he left the sleepy village of Gavrillac. Lying\nthe night at a roadside inn, and setting out again early in the morning,\nhe reached Nantes soon after noon of the following day.\n\nThrough that long and lonely ride through the dull plains of Brittany,\nnow at their dreariest in their winter garb, he had ample leisure in\nwhich to review his actions and his position. From one who had taken\nhitherto a purely academic and by no means friendly interest in the new\nphilosophies of social life, exercising his wits upon these new ideas\nmerely as a fencer exercises his eye and wrist with the foils, without\never suffering himself to be deluded into supposing the issue a real\none, he found himself suddenly converted into a revolutionary firebrand,\ncommitted to revolutionary action of the most desperate kind. The\nrepresentative and delegate of a nobleman in the States of Brittany, he\nfound himself simultaneously and incongruously the representative and\ndelegate of the whole Third Estate of Rennes.\n\nIt is difficult to determine to what extent, in the heat of passion and\nswept along by the torrent of his own oratory, he might yesterday have\nsucceeded in deceiving himself. But it is at least certain that, looking\nback in cold blood now, he had no single delusion on the score of what\nhe had done. Cynically he had presented to his audience one side only of\nthe great question that he propounded.\n\nBut since the established order of things in France was such as to make\na rampart for M. de La Tour d'Azyr, affording him complete immunity for\nthis and any other crimes that it pleased him to commit, why, then the\nestablished order must take the consequences of its wrong-doing. Therein\nhe perceived his clear justification.\n\nAnd so it was without misgivings that he came on his errand of sedition\ninto that beautiful city of Nantes, rendered by its spacious streets and\nsplendid port the rival in prosperity of Bordeaux and Marseilles.\n\nHe found an inn on the Quai La Fosse, where he put up his horse, and\nwhere he dined in the embrasure of a window that looked out over the\ntree-bordered quay and the broad bosom of the Loire, on which argosies\nof all nations rode at anchor. The sun had again broken through the\nclouds, and shed its pale wintry light over the yellow waters and the\ntall-masted shipping.\n\nAlong the quays there was a stir of life as great as that to be seen\non the quays of Paris. Foreign sailors in outlandish garments and of\nharsh-sounding, outlandish speech, stalwart fishwives with baskets of\nherrings on their heads, voluminous of petticoat above bare legs and\nbare feet, calling their wares shrilly and almost inarticulately,\nwatermen in woollen caps and loose trousers rolled to the knees,\npeasants in goatskin coats, their wooden shoes clattering on the\nround kidney-stones, shipwrights and labourers from the dockyards,\nbellows-menders, rat-catchers, water-carriers, ink-sellers, and other\nitinerant pedlars. And, sprinkled through this proletariat mass that\ncame and went in constant movement, Andre-Louis beheld tradesmen in\nsober garments, merchants in long, fur-lined coats; occasionally\na merchant-prince rolling along in his two-horse cabriolet to the\nwhip-crackings and shouts of \"Gare!\" from his coachman; occasionally a\ndainty lady carried past in her sedan-chair, with perhaps a mincing abbe\nfrom the episcopal court tripping along in attendance; occasionally an\nofficer in scarlet riding disdainfully; and once the great carriage of\na nobleman, with escutcheoned panels and a pair of white-stockinged,\npowdered footmen in gorgeous liveries hanging on behind. And there were\nCapuchins in brown and Benedictines in black, and secular priests in\nplenty--for God was well served in the sixteen parishes of Nantes--and\nby way of contrast there were lean-jawed, out-at-elbow adventurers, and\ngendarmes in blue coats and gaitered legs, sauntering guardians of the\npeace.\n\nRepresentatives of every class that went to make up the seventy thousand\ninhabitants of that wealthy, industrious city were to be seen in\nthe human stream that ebbed and flowed beneath the window from which\nAndre-Louis observed it.\n\nOf the waiter who ministered to his humble wants with soup and bouilli,\nand a measure of vin gris, Andre-Louis enquired into the state of public\nfeeling in the city. The waiter, a staunch supporter of the privileged\norders, admitted regretfully that an uneasiness prevailed. Much would\ndepend upon what happened at Rennes. If it was true that the King had\ndissolved the States of Brittany, then all should be well, and the\nmalcontents would have no pretext for further disturbances. There had\nbeen trouble and to spare in Nantes already. They wanted no repetition\nof it. All manner of rumours were abroad, and since early morning there\nhad been crowds besieging the portals of the Chamber of Commerce for\ndefinite news. But definite news was yet to come. It was not even known\nfor a fact that His Majesty actually had dissolved the States.\n\nIt was striking two, the busiest hour of the day upon the Bourse, when\nAndre-Louis reached the Place du Commerce. The square, dominated by the\nimposing classical building of the Exchange, was so crowded that he\nwas compelled almost to fight his way through to the steps of the\nmagnificent Ionic porch. A word would have sufficed to have opened a way\nfor him at once. But guile moved him to keep silent. He would come upon\nthat waiting multitude as a thunderclap, precisely as yesterday he\nhad come upon the mob at Rennes. He would lose nothing of the surprise\neffect of his entrance.\n\nThe precincts of that house of commerce were jealously kept by a line\nof ushers armed with staves, a guard as hurriedly assembled by the\nmerchants as it was evidently necessary. One of these now effectively\nbarred the young lawyer's passage as he attempted to mount the steps.\n\nAndre-Louis announced himself in a whisper.\n\nThe stave was instantly raised from the horizontal, and he passed and\nwent up the steps in the wake of the usher. At the top, on the threshold\nof the chamber, he paused, and stayed his guide.\n\n\"I will wait here,\" he announced. \"Bring the president to me.\"\n\n\"Your name, monsieur?\"\n\nAlmost had Andre-Louis answered him when he remembered Le Chapelier's\nwarning of the danger with which his mission was fraught, and Le\nChapelier's parting admonition to conceal his identity.\n\n\"My name is unknown to him; it matters nothing; I am the mouthpiece of a\npeople, no more. Go.\"\n\nThe usher went, and in the shadow of that lofty, pillared portico\nAndre-Louis waited, his eyes straying out ever and anon to survey that\nspread of upturned faces immediately below him.\n\nSoon the president came, others following, crowding out into the\nportico, jostling one another in their eagerness to hear the news.\n\n\"You are a messenger from Rennes?\"\n\n\"I am the delegate sent by the Literary Chamber of that city to inform\nyou here in Nantes of what is taking place.\"\n\n\"Your name?\"\n\nAndre-Louis paused. \"The less we mention names perhaps the better.\"\n\nThe president's eyes grew big with gravity. He was a corpulent, florid\nman, purse-proud, and self-sufficient.\n\nHe hesitated a moment. Then--\"Come into the Chamber,\" said he.\n\n\"By your leave, monsieur, I will deliver my message from here--from these\nsteps.\"\n\n\"From here?\" The great merchant frowned.\n\n\"My message is for the people of Nantes, and from here I can speak\nat once to the greatest number of Nantais of all ranks, and it is my\ndesire--and the desire of those whom I represent--that as great a number\nas possible should hear my message at first hand.\"\n\n\"Tell me, sir, is it true that the King has dissolved the States?\"\n\nAndre-Louis looked at him. He smiled apologetically, and waved a hand\ntowards the crowd, which by now was straining for a glimpse of this slim\nyoung man who had brought forth the president and more than half the\nnumbers of the Chamber, guessing already, with that curious instinct of\ncrowds, that he was the awaited bearer of tidings.\n\n\"Summon the gentlemen of your Chamber, monsieur,\" said he, \"and you\nshall hear all.\"\n\n\"So be it.\"\n\nA word, and forth they came to crowd upon the steps, but leaving clear\nthe topmost step and a half-moon space in the middle.\n\nTo the spot so indicated, Andre-Louis now advanced very deliberately.\nHe took his stand there, dominating the entire assembly. He removed\nhis hat, and launched the opening bombshell of that address which\nis historic, marking as it does one of the great stages of France's\nprogress towards revolution.\n\n\"People of this great city of Nantes, I have come to summon you to\narms!\"\n\nIn the amazed and rather scared silence that followed he surveyed them\nfor a moment before resuming.\n\n\"I am a delegate of the people of Rennes, charged to announce to you\nwhat is taking place, and to invite you in this dreadful hour of our\ncountry's peril to rise and march to her defence.\"\n\n\"Name! Your name!\" a voice shouted, and instantly the cry was taken up\nby others, until the multitude rang with the question.\n\nHe could not answer that excited mob as he had answered the president.\nIt was necessary to compromise, and he did so, happily. \"My name,\" said\nhe, \"is Omnes Omnibus--all for all. Let that suffice you now. I am a\nherald, a mouthpiece, a voice; no more. I come to announce to you that\nsince the privileged orders, assembled for the States of Brittany in\nRennes, resisted your will--our will--despite the King's plain hint to\nthem, His Majesty has dissolved the States.\"\n\nThere was a burst of delirious applause. Men laughed and shouted, and\ncries of \"Vive le Roi!\" rolled forth like thunder. Andre-Louis waited,\nand gradually the preternatural gravity of his countenance came to be\nobserved, and to beget the suspicion that there might be more to follow.\nGradually silence was restored, and at last Andre Louis was able to\nproceed.\n\n\"You rejoice too soon. Unfortunately, the nobles, in their insolent\narrogance, have elected to ignore the royal dissolution, and in despite\nof it persist in sitting and in conducting matters as seems good to\nthem.\"\n\nA silence of utter dismay greeted that disconcerting epilogue to\nthe announcement that had been so rapturously received. Andre-Louis\ncontinued after a moment's pause:\n\n\"So that these men who were already rebels against the people, rebels,\nagainst justice and equity, rebels against humanity itself, are now\nalso rebels against their King. Sooner than yield an inch of the\nunconscionable privileges by which too long already they have\nflourished, to the misery of a whole nation, they will make a mock\nof royal authority, hold up the King himself to contempt. They are\ndetermined to prove that there is no real sovereignty in France but the\nsovereignty of their own parasitic faineantise.\"\n\nThere was a faint splutter of applause, but the majority of the audience\nremained silent, waiting.\n\n\"This is no new thing. Always has it been the same. No minister in\nthe last ten years, who, seeing the needs and perils of the State,\ncounselled the measures that we now demand as the only means of\narresting our motherland in its ever-quickening progress to the abyss,\nbut found himself as a consequence cast out of office by the influence\nwhich Privilege brought to bear against him. Twice already has M. Necker\nbeen called to the ministry, to be twice dismissed when his insistent\ncounsels of reform threatened the privileges of clergy and nobility. For\nthe third time now has he been called to office, and at last it seems\nwe are to have States General in spite of Privilege. But what the\nprivileged orders can no longer prevent, they are determined to\nstultify. Since it is now a settled thing that these States General are\nto meet, at least the nobles and the clergy will see to it--unless we\ntake measures to prevent them--by packing the Third Estate with their\nown creatures, and denying it all effective representation, that they\nconvert the States General into an instrument of their own will for the\nperpetuation of the abuses by which they live. To achieve this end they\nwill stop at nothing. They have flouted the authority of the King, and\nthey are silencing by assassination those who raise their voices to\ncondemn them. Yesterday in Rennes two young men who addressed the people\nas I am addressing you were done to death in the streets by assassins at\nthe instigation of the nobility. Their blood cries out for vengeance.\"\n\nBeginning in a sullen mutter, the indignation that moved his hearers\nswelled up to express itself in a roar of anger.\n\n\"Citizens of Nantes, the motherland is in peril. Let us march to her\ndefence. Let us proclaim it to the world that we recognize that the\nmeasures to liberate the Third Estate from the slavery in which for\ncenturies it has groaned find only obstacles in those orders whose\nphrenetic egotism sees in the tears and suffering of the unfortunate\nan odious tribute which they would pass on to their generations still\nunborn. Realizing from the barbarity of the means employed by our\nenemies to perpetuate our oppression that we have everything to fear\nfrom the aristocracy they would set up as a constitutional principle for\nthe governing of France, let us declare ourselves at once enfranchised\nfrom it.\n\n\"The establishment of liberty and equality should be the aim of every\ncitizen member of the Third Estate; and to this end we should stand\nindivisibly united, especially the young and vigorous, especially those\nwho have had the good fortune to be born late enough to be able to\ngather for themselves the precious fruits of the philosophy of this\neighteenth century.\"\n\nAcclamations broke out unstintedly now. He had caught them in the snare\nof his oratory. And he pressed his advantage instantly.\n\n\"Let us all swear,\" he cried in a great voice, \"to raise up in the name\nof humanity and of liberty a rampart against our enemies, to oppose to\ntheir bloodthirsty covetousness the calm perseverance of men whose cause\nis just. And let us protest here and in advance against any tyrannical\ndecrees that should declare us seditious when we have none but pure and\njust intentions. Let us make oath upon the honour of our motherland that\nshould any of us be seized by an unjust tribunal, intending against us\none of those acts termed of political expediency--which are, in effect,\nbut acts of despotism--let us swear, I say, to give a full expression\nto the strength that is in us and do that in self-defence which nature,\ncourage, and despair dictate to us.\"\n\nLoud and long rolled the applause that greeted his conclusion, and he\nobserved with satisfaction and even some inward grim amusement that the\nwealthy merchants who had been congregated upon the steps, and who now\ncame crowding about him to shake him by the hand and to acclaim him,\nwere not merely participants in, but the actual leaders of, this\ndelirium of enthusiasm.\n\nIt confirmed him, had he needed confirmation, in his conviction that\njust as the philosophies upon which this new movement was based had\ntheir source in thinkers extracted from the bourgeoisie, so the need\nto adopt those philosophies to the practical purposes of life was most\nacutely felt at present by those bourgeois who found themselves debarred\nby Privilege from the expansion their wealth permitted them. If it might\nbe said of Andre-Louis that he had that day lighted the torch of the\nRevolution in Nantes, it might with even greater truth be said that the\ntorch itself was supplied by the opulent bourgeoisie.\n\nI need not dwell at any length upon the sequel. It is a matter of\nhistory how that oath which Omnes Omnibus administered to the citizens\nof Nantes formed the backbone of the formal protest which they drew up\nand signed in their thousands. Nor were the results of that powerful\nprotest--which, after all, might already be said to harmonize with the\nexpressed will of the sovereign himself--long delayed. Who shall say how\nfar it may have strengthened the hand of Necker, when on the 27th of\nthat same month of November he compelled the Council to adopt the most\nsignificant and comprehensive of all those measures to which clergy and\nnobility had refused their consent? On that date was published the royal\ndecree ordaining that the deputies to be elected to the States General\nshould number at least one thousand, and that the deputies of the\nThird Estate should be fully representative by numbering as many as the\ndeputies of clergy and nobility together.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE AFTERMATH\n\nDusk of the following day was falling when the homing Andre-Louis\napproached Gavrillac. Realizing fully what a hue and cry there would\npresently be for the apostle of revolution who had summoned the people\nof Nantes to arms, he desired as far as possible to conceal the fact\nthat he had been in that maritime city. Therefore he made a wide detour,\ncrossing the river at Bruz, and recrossing it a little above Chavagne,\nso as to approach Gavrillac from the north, and create the impression\nthat he was returning from Rennes, whither he was known to have gone two\ndays ago.\n\nWithin a mile or so of the village he caught in the fading light his\nfirst glimpse of a figure on horseback pacing slowly towards him. But\nit was not until they had come within a few yards of each other, and he\nobserved that this cloaked figure was leaning forward to peer at him,\nthat he took much notice of it. And then he found himself challenged\nalmost at once by a woman's voice.\n\n\"It is you, Andre--at last!\"\n\nHe drew rein, mildly surprised, to be assailed by another question,\nimpatiently, anxiously asked.\n\n\"Where have you been?\"\n\n\"Where have I been, Cousin Aline? Oh... seeing the world.\"\n\n\"I have been patrolling this road since noon to-day waiting for\nyou.\" She spoke breathlessly, in haste to explain. \"A troop of the\nmarechaussee from Rennes descended upon Gavrillac this morning in quest\nof you. They turned the chateau and the village inside out, and at\nlast discovered that you were due to return with a horse hired from the\nBreton arme. So they have taken up their quarters at the inn to wait\nfor you. I have been here all the afternoon on the lookout to warn you\nagainst walking into that trap.\"\n\n\"My dear Aline! That I should have been the cause of so much concern and\ntrouble!\"\n\n\"Never mind that. It is not important.\"\n\n\"On the contrary; it is the most important part of what you tell me. It\nis the rest that is unimportant.\"\n\n\"Do you realize that they have come to arrest you?\" she asked him, with\nincreasing impatience. \"You are wanted for sedition, and upon a warrant\nfrom M. de Lesdiguieres.\"\n\n\"Sedition?\" quoth he, and his thoughts flew to that business at Nantes.\nIt was impossible they could have had news of it in Rennes and acted\nupon it in so short a time.\n\n\"Yes, sedition. The sedition of that wicked speech of yours at Rennes on\nWednesday.\"\n\n\"Oh, that!\" said he. \"Pooh!\" His note of relief might have told her,\nhad she been more attentive, that he had to fear the consequences of a\ngreater wickedness committed since. \"Why, that was nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing?\"\n\n\"I almost suspect that the real intentions of these gentlemen of the\nmarechaussee have been misunderstood. Most probably they have come to\nthank me on M. de Lesdiguieres' behalf. I restrained the people when\nthey would have burnt the Palais and himself inside it.\"\n\n\"After you had first incited them to do it. I suppose you were afraid of\nyour work. You drew back at the last moment. But you said things of\nM. de Lesdiguieres, if you are correctly reported, which he will never\nforgive.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Andre-Louis, and he fell into thought.\n\nBut Mlle. de Kercadiou had already done what thinking was necessary, and\nher alert young mind had settled all that was to be done.\n\n\"You must not go into Gavrillac,\" she told him, \"and you must get down\nfrom your horse, and let me take it. I will stable it at the chateau\nto-night. And sometime to-morrow afternoon, by when you should be well\naway, I will return it to the Breton arme.\"\n\n\"Oh, but that is impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible? Why?\"\n\n\"For several reasons. One of them is that you haven't considered what\nwill happen to you if you do such a thing.\"\n\n\"To me? Do you suppose I am afraid of that pack of oafs sent by M.\nLesdiguieres? I have committed no sedition.\"\n\n\"But it is almost as bad to give aid to one who is wanted for the crime.\nThat is the law.\"\n\n\"What do I care for the law? Do you imagine that the law will presume to\ntouch me?\"\n\n\"Of course there is that. You are sheltered by one of the abuses I\ncomplained of at Rennes. I was forgetting.\"\n\n\"Complain of it as much as you please, but meanwhile profit by it. Come,\nAndre, do as I tell you. Get down from your horse.\" And then, as he\nstill hesitated, she stretched out and caught him by the arm. Her voice\nwas vibrant with earnestness. \"Andre, you don't realize how serious is\nyour position. If these people take you, it is almost certain that you\nwill be hanged. Don't you realize it? You must not go to Gavrillac.\nYou must go away at once, and lie completely lost for a time until this\nblows over. Indeed, until my uncle can bring influence to bear to obtain\nyour pardon, you must keep in hiding.\"\n\n\"That will be a long time, then,\" said Andre-Louis. \"M. de Kercadiou has\nnever cultivated friends at court.\"\n\n\"There is M. de La Tour d'Azyr,\" she reminded him, to his astonishment.\n\n\"That man!\" he cried, and then he laughed. \"But it was chiefly against\nhim that I aroused the resentment of the people of Rennes. I should have\nknown that all my speech was not reported to you.\"\n\n\"It was, and that part of it among the rest.\"\n\n\"Ah! And yet you are concerned to save me, the man who seeks the life of\nyour future husband at the hands either of the law or of the people? Or\nis it, perhaps, that since you have seen his true nature revealed in the\nmurder of poor Philippe, you have changed your views on the subject of\nbecoming Marquise de La Tour d'Azyr?\"\n\n\"You often show yourself without any faculty of deductive reasoning.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. But hardly to the extent of imagining that M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr will ever lift a finger to do as you suggest.\"\n\n\"In which, as usual, you are wrong. He will certainly do so if I ask\nhim.\"\n\n\"If you ask him?\" Sheer horror rang in his voice.\n\n\"Why, yes. You see, I have not yet said that I will be Marquise de\nLa Tour d'Azyr. I am still considering. It is a position that has\nits advantages. One of them is that it ensures a suitor's complete\nobedience.\"\n\n\"So, so. I see the crooked logic of your mind. You might go so far as\nto say to him: 'Refuse me this, and I shall refuse to be your marquise.'\nYou would go so far as that?\"\n\n\"At need, I might.\"\n\n\"And do you not see the converse implication? Do you not see that\nyour hands would then be tied, that you would be wanting in honour if\nafterwards you refused him? And do you think that I would consent to\nanything that could so tie your hands? Do you think I want to see you\ndamned, Aline?\"\n\nHer hand fell away from his arm.\n\n\"Oh, you are mad!\" she exclaimed, quite out of patience.\n\n\"Possibly. But I like my madness. There is a thrill in it unknown to\nsuch sanity as yours. By your leave, Aline, I think I will ride on to\nGavrillac.\"\n\n\"Andre, you must not! It is death to you!\" In her alarm she backed her\nhorse, and pulled it across the road to bar his way.\n\nIt was almost completely night by now; but from behind the wrack of\nclouds overhead a crescent moon sailed out to alleviate the darkness.\n\n\"Come, now,\" she enjoined him. \"Be reasonable. Do as I bid you. See,\nthere is a carriage coming up behind you. Do not let us be found here\ntogether thus.\"\n\nHe made up his mind quickly. He was not the man to be actuated by false\nheroics about dying, and he had no fancy whatever for the gallows of M.\nde Lesdiguieres' providing. The immediate task that he had set himself\nmight be accomplished. He had made heard--and ringingly--the voice that\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr imagined he had silenced. But he was very far from\nhaving done with life.\n\n\"Aline, on one condition only.\"\n\n\"And that?\"\n\n\"That you swear to me you will never seek the aid of M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr on my behalf.\"\n\n\"Since you insist, and as time presses, I consent. And now ride on with\nme as far as the lane. There is that carriage coming up.\"\n\nThe lane to which she referred was one that branched off the road some\nthree hundred yards nearer the village and led straight up the hill\nto the chateau itself. In silence they rode together towards it, and\ntogether they turned into that thickly hedged and narrow bypath. At a\ndepth of fifty yards she halted him.\n\n\"Now!\" she bade him.\n\nObediently he swung down from his horse, and surrendered the reins to\nher.\n\n\"Aline,\" he said, \"I haven't words in which to thank you.\"\n\n\"It isn't necessary,\" said she.\n\n\"But I shall hope to repay you some day.\"\n\n\"Nor is that necessary. Could I do less than I am doing? I do not want\nto hear of you hanged, Andre; nor does my uncle, though he is very angry\nwith you.\"\n\n\"I suppose he is.\"\n\n\"And you can hardly be surprised. You were his delegate, his\nrepresentative. He depended upon you, and you have turned your coat. He\nis rightly indignant, calls you a traitor, and swears that he will never\nspeak to you again. But he doesn't want you hanged, Andre.\"\n\n\"Then we are agreed on that at least, for I don't want it myself.\"\n\n\"I'll make your peace with him. And now--good-bye, Andre. Send me a word\nwhen you are safe.\"\n\nShe held out a hand that looked ghostly in the faint light. He took it\nand bore it to his lips.\n\n\"God bless you, Aline.\"\n\nShe was gone, and he stood listening to the receding clopper-clop of\nhooves until it grew faint in the distance. Then slowly, with shoulders\nhunched and head sunk on his breast, he retraced his steps to the\nmain road, cogitating whither he should go. Quite suddenly he checked,\nremembering with dismay that he was almost entirely without money. In\nBrittany itself he knew of no dependable hiding-place, and as long as\nhe was in Brittany his peril must remain imminent. Yet to leave the\nprovince, and to leave it as quickly as prudence dictated, horses would\nbe necessary. And how was he to procure horses, having no money beyond a\nsingle louis d'or and a few pieces of silver?\n\nThere was also the fact that he was very weary. He had had little sleep\nsince Tuesday night, and not very much then; and much of the time had\nbeen spent in the saddle, a wearing thing to one so little accustomed\nto long rides. Worn as he was, it was unthinkable that he should go far\nto-night. He might get as far as Chavagne, perhaps. But there he must\nsup and sleep; and what, then, of to-morrow?\n\nHad he but thought of it before, perhaps Aline might have been able to\nassist him with the loan of a few louis. His first impulse now was to\nfollow her to the chateau. But prudence dismissed the notion. Before he\ncould reach her, he must be seen by servants, and word of his presence\nwould go forth.\n\nThere was no choice for him; he must tramp as far as Chavagne, find a\nbed there, and leave to-morrow until it dawned. On the resolve he set\nhis face in the direction whence he had come. But again he paused.\nChavagne lay on the road to Rennes. To go that way was to plunge further\ninto danger. He would strike south again. At the foot of some meadows on\nthis side of the village there was a ferry that would put him across the\nriver. Thus he would avoid the village; and by placing the river between\nhimself and the immediate danger, he would obtain an added sense of\nsecurity.\n\nA lane, turning out of the highroad, a quarter of a mile this side of\nGavrillac, led down to that ferry. By this lane some twenty minutes\nlater came Andre-Louis with dragging feet. He avoided the little cottage\nof the ferryman, whose window was alight, and in the dark crept down to\nthe boat, intending if possible to put himself across. He felt for the\nchain by which the boat was moored, and ran his fingers along this to\nthe point where it was fastened. Here to his dismay he found a padlock.\n\nHe stood up in the gloom and laughed silently. Of course he might have\nknown it. The ferry was the property of M. de La Tour d'Azyr, and not\nlikely to be left unfastened so that poor devils might cheat him of\nseigneurial dues.\n\nThere being no possible alternative, he walked back to the cottage, and\nrapped on the door. When it opened, he stood well back, and aside, out\nof the shaft of light that issued thence.\n\n\"Ferry!\" he rapped out, laconically.\n\nThe ferryman, a burly scoundrel well known to him, turned aside to pick\nup a lantern, and came forth as he was bidden. As he stepped from the\nlittle porch, he levelled the lantern so that its light fell on the face\nof this traveller.\n\n\"My God!\" he ejaculated.\n\n\"You realize, I see, that I am pressed,\" said Andre-Louis, his eyes on\nthe fellow's startled countenance.\n\n\"And well you may be with the gallows waiting for you at Rennes,\"\ngrowled the ferryman. \"Since you've been so foolish as to come back to\nGavrillac, you had better go again as quickly as you can. I will say\nnothing of having seen you.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Fresnel. Your advice accords with my intention. That is\nwhy I need the boat.\"\n\n\"Ah, that, no,\" said Fresnel, with determination. \"I'll hold my peace,\nbut it's as much as my skin is worth to help you.\n\n\"You need not have seen my face. Forget that you have seen it.\"\n\n\"I'll do that, monsieur. But that is all I will do. I cannot put you\nacross the river.\"\n\n\"Then give me the key of the boat, and I will put myself across.\"\n\n\"That is the same thing. I cannot. I'll hold my tongue, but I will not--I\ndare not--help you.\"\n\nAndre-Louis looked a moment into that sullen, resolute face, and\nunderstood. This man, living under the shadow of La Tour d'Azyr, dared\nexercise no will that might be in conflict with the will of his dread\nlord.\n\n\"Fresnel,\" he said, quietly, \"if, as you say, the gallows claim me, the\nthing that has brought me to this extremity arises out of the shooting\nof Mabey. Had not Mabey been murdered there would have been no need\nfor me to have raised my voice as I have done. Mabey was your friend, I\nthink. Will you for his sake lend me the little help I need to save my\nneck?\"\n\nThe man kept his glance averted, and the cloud of sullenness deepened on\nhis face.\n\n\"I would if I dared, but I dare not.\" Then, quite suddenly he became\nangry. It was as if in anger he sought support. \"Don't you understand\nthat I dare not? Would you have a poor man risk his life for you? What\nhave you or yours ever done for me that you should ask that? You do not\ncross to-night in my ferry. Understand that, monsieur, and go at once--go\nbefore I remember that it may be dangerous even to have talked to you\nand not give information. Go!\"\n\nHe turned on his heel to reenter his cottage, and a wave of hopelessness\nswept over Andre-Louis.\n\nBut in a second it was gone. The man must be compelled, and he had the\nmeans. He bethought him of a pistol pressed upon him by Le Chapelier at\nthe moment of his leaving Rennes, a gift which at the time he had almost\ndisdained. True, it was not loaded, and he had no ammunition. But how\nwas Fresnel to know that?\n\nHe acted quickly. As with his right hand he pulled it from his pocket,\nwith his left he caught the ferryman by the shoulder, and swung him\nround.\n\n\"What do you want now?\" Fresnel demanded angrily. \"Haven't I told you\nthat I...\"\n\nHe broke off short. The muzzle of the pistol was within a foot of his\neyes.\n\n\"I want the key of the boat. That is all, Fresnel. And you can either\ngive it me at once, or I'll take it after I have burnt your brains. I\nshould regret to kill you, but I shall not hesitate. It is your life\nagainst mine, Fresnel; and you'll not find it strange that if one of us\nmust die I prefer that it shall be you.\"\n\nFresnel dipped a hand into his pocket, and fetched thence a key. He held\nit out to Andre-Louis in fingers that shook--more in anger than in fear.\n\n\"I yield to violence,\" he said, showing his teeth like a snarling dog.\n\"But don't imagine that it will greatly profit you.\"\n\nAndre-Louis took the key. His pistol remained levelled.\n\n\"You threaten me, I think,\" he said. \"It is not difficult to read your\nthreat. The moment I am gone, you will run to inform against me. You\nwill set the marechaussee on my heels to overtake me.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" cried the other. He perceived his peril. He read his doom in\nthe cold, sinister note on which Andre-Louis addressed him, and grew\nafraid. \"I swear to you, monsieur, that I have no such intention.\"\n\n\"I think I had better make quite sure of you.\"\n\n\"O my God! Have mercy, monsieur!\" The knave was in a palsy of terror. \"I\nmean you no harm--I swear to Heaven I mean you no harm. I will not say a\nword. I will not...\"\n\n\"I would rather depend upon your silence than your assurances.\nStill, you shall have your chance. I am a fool, perhaps, but I have a\nreluctance to shed blood. Go into the house, Fresnel. Go, man. I follow\nyou.\"\n\nIn the shabby main room of that dwelling, Andre-Louis halted him again.\n\"Get me a length of rope,\" he commanded, and was readily obeyed.\n\nFive minutes later Fresnel was securely bound to a chair, and\neffectively silenced by a very uncomfortable gag improvised out of a\nblock of wood and a muffler.\n\nOn the threshold the departing Andre-Louis turned.\n\n\"Good-night, Fresnel,\" he said. Fierce eyes glared mute hatred at him.\n\"It is unlikely that your ferry will be required again to-night. But\nsome one is sure to come to your relief quite early in the morning.\nUntil then bear your discomfort with what fortitude you can,\nremembering that you have brought it entirely upon yourself by your\nuncharitableness. If you spend the night considering that, the lesson\nshould not be lost upon you. By morning you may even have grown so\ncharitable as not to know who it was that tied you up. Good-night.\"\n\nHe stepped out and closed the door.\n\nTo unlock the ferry, and pull himself across the swift-running waters,\non which the faint moonlight was making a silver ripple, were matters\nthat engaged not more than six or seven minutes. He drove the nose of\nthe boat through the decaying sedges that fringed the southern bank\nof the stream, sprang ashore, and made the little craft secure. Then,\nmissing the footpath in the dark, he struck out across a sodden meadow\nin quest of the road.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II: THE BUSKIN\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. THE TRESPASSERS\n\nComing presently upon the Redon road, Andre-Louis, obeying instinct\nrather than reason, turned his face to the south, and plodded wearily\nand mechanically forward. He had no clear idea of whither he was going,\nor of whither he should go. All that imported at the moment was to put\nas great a distance as possible between Gavrillac and himself.\n\nHe had a vague, half-formed notion of returning to Nantes; and there, by\nemploying the newly found weapon of his oratory, excite the people into\nsheltering him as the first victim of the persecution he had foreseen,\nand against which he had sworn them to take up arms. But the idea was\none which he entertained merely as an indefinite possibility upon which\nhe felt no real impulse to act.\n\nMeanwhile he chuckled at the thought of Fresnel as he had last seen him,\nwith his muffled face and glaring eyeballs. \"For one who was anything\nbut a man of action,\" he writes, \"I felt that I had acquitted myself\nnone so badly.\" It is a phrase that recurs at intervals in his sketchy\n\"Confessions.\" Constantly is he reminding you that he is a man of mental\nand not physical activities, and apologizing when dire necessity\ndrives him into acts of violence. I suspect this insistence upon\nhis philosophic detachment--for which I confess he had justification\nenough--to betray his besetting vanity.\n\nWith increasing fatigue came depression and self-criticism. He had\nstupidly overshot his mark in insultingly denouncing M. de Lesdiguieres.\n\"It is much better,\" he says somewhere, \"to be wicked than to be stupid.\nMost of this world's misery is the fruit not as priests tell us of\nwickedness, but of stupidity.\" And we know that of all stupidities he\nconsidered anger the most deplorable. Yet he had permitted himself to\nbe angry with a creature like M. de Lesdiguieres--a lackey, a fribble,\na nothing, despite his potentialities for evil. He could perfectly have\ndischarged his self-imposed mission without arousing the vindictive\nresentment of the King's Lieutenant.\n\nHe beheld himself vaguely launched upon life with the riding-suit in\nwhich he stood, a single louis d'or and a few pieces of silver for all\ncapital, and a knowledge of law which had been inadequate to preserve\nhim from the consequences of infringing it.\n\nHe had, in addition--but these things that were to be the real salvation\nof him he did not reckon--his gift of laughter, sadly repressed of late,\nand the philosophic outlook and mercurial temperament which are the\nstock-in-trade of your adventurer in all ages.\n\nMeanwhile he tramped mechanically on through the night, until he felt\nthat he could tramp no more. He had skirted the little township of\nGuichen, and now within a half-mile of Guignen, and with Gavrillac a\ngood seven miles behind him, his legs refused to carry him any farther.\n\nHe was midway across the vast common to the north of Guignen when\nhe came to a halt. He had left the road, and taken heedlessly to\nthe footpath that struck across the waste of indifferent pasture\ninterspersed with clumps of gorse. A stone's throw away on his right the\ncommon was bordered by a thorn hedge. Beyond this loomed a tall building\nwhich he knew to be an open barn, standing on the edge of a long stretch\nof meadowland. That dark, silent shadow it may have been that had\nbrought him to a standstill, suggesting shelter to his subconsciousness.\nA moment he hesitated; then he struck across towards a spot where a gap\nin the hedge was closed by a five-barred gate. He pushed the gate open,\nwent through the gap, and stood now before the barn. It was as big as\na house, yet consisted of no more than a roof carried upon half a dozen\ntall, brick pillars. But densely packed under that roof was a great\nstack of hay that promised a warm couch on so cold a night. Stout\ntimbers had been built into the brick pillars, with projecting ends to\nserve as ladders by which the labourer might climb to pack or withdraw\nhay. With what little strength remained him, Andre-Louis climbed by one\nof these and landed safely at the top, where he was forced to kneel, for\nlack of room to stand upright. Arrived there, he removed his coat and\nneckcloth, his sodden boots and stockings. Next he cleared a trough for\nhis body, and lying down in it, covered himself to the neck with the hay\nhe had removed. Within five minutes he was lost to all worldly cares and\nsoundly asleep.\n\nWhen next he awakened, the sun was already high in the heavens, from\nwhich he concluded that the morning was well advanced; and this before\nhe realized quite where he was or how he came there. Then to his\nawakening senses came a drone of voices close at hand, to which at first\nhe paid little heed. He was deliciously refreshed, luxuriously drowsy\nand luxuriously warm.\n\nBut as consciousness and memory grew more full, he raised his head clear\nof the hay that he might free both ears to listen, his pulses faintly\nquickened by the nascent fear that those voices might bode him no good.\nThen he caught the reassuring accents of a woman, musical and silvery,\nthough laden with alarm.\n\n\"Ah, mon Dieu, Leandre, let us separate at once. If it should be my\nfather...\"\n\nAnd upon this a man's voice broke in, calm and reassuring:\n\n\"No, no, Climene; you are mistaken. There is no one coming. We are quite\nsafe. Why do you start at shadows?\"\n\n\"Ah, Leandre, if he should find us here together! I tremble at the very\nthought.\"\n\nMore was not needed to reassure Andre-Louis. He had overheard enough to\nknow that this was but the case of a pair of lovers who, with less to\nfear of life, were yet--after the manner of their kind--more timid of\nheart than he. Curiosity drew him from his warm trough to the edge of\nthe hay. Lying prone, he advanced his head and peered down.\n\nIn the space of cropped meadow between the barn and the hedge stood a\nman and a woman, both young. The man was a well-set-up, comely fellow,\nwith a fine head of chestnut hair tied in a queue by a broad bow of\nblack satin. He was dressed with certain tawdry attempts at ostentatious\nembellishments, which did not prepossess one at first glance in his\nfavour. His coat of a fashionable cut was of faded plum-coloured velvet\nedged with silver lace, whose glory had long since departed. He affected\nruffles, but for want of starch they hung like weeping willows over\nhands that were fine and delicate. His breeches were of plain black\ncloth, and his black stockings were of cotton--matters entirely out of\nharmony with his magnificent coat. His shoes, stout and serviceable,\nwere decked with buckles of cheap, lack-lustre paste. But for his\nengaging and ingenuous countenance, Andre-Louis must have set him down\nas a knight of that order which lives dishonestly by its wits. As it\nwas, he suspended judgment whilst pushing investigation further by a\nstudy of the girl. At the outset, be it confessed that it was a study\nthat attracted him prodigiously. And this notwithstanding the fact that,\nbookish and studious as were his ways, and in despite of his years, it\nwas far from his habit to waste consideration on femininity.\n\nThe child--she was no more than that, perhaps twenty at the\nmost--possessed, in addition to the allurements of face and shape that\nwent very near perfection, a sparkling vivacity and a grace of movement\nthe like of which Andre-Louis did not remember ever before to have\nbeheld assembled in one person. And her voice too--that musical, silvery\nvoice that had awakened him--possessed in its exquisite modulations an\nallurement of its own that must have been irresistible, he thought, in\nthe ugliest of her sex. She wore a hooded mantle of green cloth, and the\nhood being thrown back, her dainty head was all revealed to him. There\nwere glints of gold struck by the morning sun from her light nut-brown\nhair that hung in a cluster of curls about her oval face. Her complexion\nwas of a delicacy that he could compare only with a rose petal. He could\nnot at that distance discern the colour of her eyes, but he guessed them\nblue, as he admired the sparkle of them under the fine, dark line of\neyebrows.\n\nHe could not have told you why, but he was conscious that it aggrieved\nhim to find her so intimate with this pretty young fellow, who was\npartly clad, as it appeared, in the cast-offs of a nobleman. He could\nnot guess her station, but the speech that reached him was cultured in\ntone and word. He strained to listen.\n\n\"I shall know no peace, Leandre, until we are safely wedded,\" she was\nsaying. \"Not until then shall I count myself beyond his reach. And yet\nif we marry without his consent, we but make trouble for ourselves, and\nof gaining his consent I almost despair.\"\n\nEvidently, thought Andre-Louis, her father was a man of sense, who saw\nthrough the shabby finery of M. Leandre, and was not to be dazzled by\ncheap paste buckles.\n\n\"My dear Climene,\" the young man was answering her, standing squarely\nbefore her, and holding both her hands, \"you are wrong to despond. If I\ndo not reveal to you all the stratagem that I have prepared to win the\nconsent of your unnatural parent, it is because I am loath to rob you of\nthe pleasure of the surprise that is in store. But place your faith in\nme, and in that ingenious friend of whom I have spoken, and who should\nbe here at any moment.\"\n\nThe stilted ass! Had he learnt that speech by heart in advance, or was\nhe by nature a pedantic idiot who expressed himself in this set and\nformal manner? How came so sweet a blossom to waste her perfumes on such\na prig? And what a ridiculous name the creature owned!\n\nThus Andre-Louis to himself from his observatory. Meanwhile, she was\nspeaking.\n\n\"That is what my heart desires, Leandre, but I am beset by fears lest\nyour stratagem should be too late. I am to marry this horrible Marquis\nof Sbrufadelli this very day. He arrives by noon. He comes to sign the\ncontract--to make me the Marchioness of Sbrufadelli. Oh!\" It was a cry of\npain from that tender young heart. \"The very name burns my lips. If it\nwere mine I could never utter it--never! The man is so detestable. Save\nme, Leandre. Save me! You are my only hope.\"\n\nAndre-Louis was conscious of a pang of disappointment. She failed to\nsoar to the heights he had expected of her. She was evidently infected\nby the stilted manner of her ridiculous lover. There was an atrocious\nlack of sincerity about her words. They touched his mind, but left his\nheart unmoved. Perhaps this was because of his antipathy to M. Leandre\nand to the issue involved.\n\nSo her father was marrying her to a marquis! That implied birth on\nher side. And yet she was content to pair off with this dull young\nadventurer in the tarnished lace! It was, he supposed, the sort of thing\nto be expected of a sex that all philosophy had taught him to regard as\nthe maddest part of a mad species.\n\n\"It shall never be!\" M. Leandre was storming passionately. \"Never! I\nswear it!\" And he shook his puny fist at the blue vault of heaven--Ajax\ndefying Jupiter. \"Ah, but here comes our subtle friend...\" (Andre-Louis\ndid not catch the name, M. Leandre having at that moment turned to face\nthe gap in the hedge.) \"He will bring us news, I know.\"\n\nAndre-Louis looked also in the direction of the gap. Through it emerged\na lean, slight man in a rusty cloak and a three-cornered hat worn well\ndown over his nose so as to shade his face. And when presently he\ndoffed this hat and made a sweeping bow to the young lovers, Andre-Louis\nconfessed to himself that had he been cursed with such a hangdog\ncountenance he would have worn his hat in precisely such a manner, so\nas to conceal as much of it as possible. If M. Leandre appeared to\nbe wearing, in part at least, the cast-offs of nobleman, the newcomer\nappeared to be wearing the cast-offs of M. Leandre. Yet despite his vile\nclothes and viler face, with its three days' growth of beard, the\nfellow carried himself with a certain air; he positively strutted as he\nadvanced, and he made a leg in a manner that was courtly and practised.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said he, with the air of a conspirator, \"the time for action\nhas arrived, and so has the Marquis... That is why.\"\n\nThe young lovers sprang apart in consternation; Climene with clasped\nhands, parted lips, and a bosom that raced distractingly under its white\nfichu-menteur; M. Leandre agape, the very picture of foolishness and\ndismay.\n\nMeanwhile the newcomer rattled on. \"I was at the inn an hour ago when\nhe descended there, and I studied him attentively whilst he was at\nbreakfast. Having done so, not a single doubt remains me of our success.\nAs for what he looks like, I could entertain you at length upon the\nfashion in which nature has designed his gross fatuity. But that is no\nmatter. We are concerned with what he is, with the wit of him. And I\ntell you confidently that I find him so dull and stupid that you may be\nconfident he will tumble headlong into each and all of the traps I have\nso cunningly prepared for him.\"\n\n\"Tell me, tell me! Speak!\" Climene implored him, holding out her hands\nin a supplication no man of sensibility could have resisted. And then\non the instant she caught her breath on a faint scream. \"My father!\" she\nexclaimed, turning distractedly from one to the other of those two. \"He\nis coming! We are lost!\"\n\n\"You must fly, Climene!\" said M. Leandre.\n\n\"Too late!\" she sobbed. \"Too late! He is here.\"\n\n\"Calm, mademoiselle, calm!\" the subtle friend was urging her. \"Keep calm\nand trust to me. I promise you that all shall be well.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried M. Leandre, limply. \"Say what you will, my friend, this is\nruin--the end of all our hopes. Your wits will never extricate us from\nthis. Never!\"\n\nThrough the gap strode now an enormous man with an inflamed moon\nface and a great nose, decently dressed after the fashion of a solid\nbourgeois. There was no mistaking his anger, but the expression that it\nfound was an amazement to Andre-Louis.\n\n\"Leandre, you're an imbecile! Too much phlegm, too much phlegm! Your\nwords wouldn't convince a ploughboy! Have you considered what they mean\nat all? Thus,\" he cried, and casting his round hat from him in a broad\ngesture, he took his stand at M. Leandre's side, and repeated the very\nwords that Leandre had lately uttered, what time the three observed him\ncoolly and attentively.\n\n\"Oh, say what you will, my friend, this is ruin--the end of all our\nhopes. Your wits will never extricate us from this. Never!\"\n\nA frenzy of despair vibrated in his accents. He swung again to face M.\nLeandre. \"Thus,\" he bade him contemptuously. \"Let the passion of your\nhopelessness express itself in your voice. Consider that you are not\nasking Scaramouche here whether he has put a patch in your breeches. You\nare a despairing lover expressing...\"\n\nHe checked abruptly, startled. Andre-Louis, suddenly realizing what was\nafoot, and how duped he had been, had loosed his laughter. The sound\nof it pealing and booming uncannily under the great roof that so\nimmediately confined him was startling to those below.\n\nThe fat man was the first to recover, and he announced it after his own\nfashion in one of the ready sarcasms in which he habitually dealt.\n\n\"Hark!\" he cried, \"the very gods laugh at you, Leandre.\" Then he\naddressed the roof of the barn and its invisible tenant. \"Hi! You\nthere!\"\n\nAndre-Louis revealed himself by a further protrusion of his tousled\nhead.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" said he, pleasantly. Rising now on his knees, his\nhorizon was suddenly extended to include the broad common beyond the\nhedge. He beheld there an enormous and very battered travelling chaise,\na cart piled up with timbers partly visible under the sheet of oiled\ncanvas that covered them, and a sort of house on wheels equipped with\na tin chimney, from which the smoke was slowly curling. Three heavy\nFlemish horses and a couple of donkeys--all of them hobbled--were\ncontentedly cropping the grass in the neighbourhood of these vehicles.\nThese, had he perceived them sooner, must have given him the clue to the\nqueer scene that had been played under his eyes. Beyond the hedge other\nfigures were moving. Three at that moment came crowding into the\ngap--a saucy-faced girl with a tip-tilted nose, whom he supposed to be\nColumbine, the soubrette; a lean, active youngster, who must be the\nlackey Harlequin; and another rather loutish youth who might be a zany\nor an apothecary.\n\nAll this he took in at a comprehensive glance that consumed no more\ntime than it had taken him to say good-morning. To that good-morning\nPantaloon replied in a bellow:\n\n\"What the devil are you doing up there?\"\n\n\"Precisely the same thing that you are doing down there,\" was the\nanswer. \"I am trespassing.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Pantaloon, and looked at his companions, some of the\nassurance beaten out of his big red face. Although the thing was one\nthat they did habitually, to hear it called by its proper name was\ndisconcerting.\n\n\"Whose land is this?\" he asked, with diminishing assurance.\n\nAndre-Louis answered, whilst drawing on his stockings. \"I believe it to\nbe the property of the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr.\"\n\n\"That's a high-sounding name. Is the gentleman severe?\"\n\n\"The gentleman,\" said Andre-Louis, \"is the devil; or rather, I should\nprefer to say upon reflection, that the devil is a gentleman by\ncomparison.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" interposed the villainous-looking fellow who played\nScaramouche, \"by your own confessing you don't hesitate, yourself, to\ntrespass upon his property.\"\n\n\"Ah, but then, you see, I am a lawyer. And lawyers are notoriously\nunable to observe the law, just as actors are notoriously unable to act.\nMoreover, sir, Nature imposes her limits upon us, and Nature conquers\nrespect for law as she conquers all else. Nature conquered me last night\nwhen I had got as far as this. And so I slept here without regard for\nthe very high and puissant Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr. At the same time,\nM. Scaramouche, you'll observe that I did not flaunt my trespass quite\nas openly as you and your companions.\"\n\nHaving donned his boots, Andre-Louis came nimbly to the ground in his\nshirt-sleeves, his riding-coat over his arm. As he stood there to don\nit, the little cunning eyes of the heavy father conned him in detail.\nObserving that his clothes, if plain, were of a good fashion, that his\nshirt was of fine cambric, and that he expressed himself like a man\nof culture, such as he claimed to be, M. Pantaloon was disposed to be\ncivil.\n\n\"I am very grateful to you for the warning, sir...\" he was beginning.\n\n\"Act upon it, my friend. The gardes-champetres of M. d'Azyr have orders\nto fire on trespassers. Imitate me, and decamp.\"\n\nThey followed him upon the instant through that gap in the hedge to the\nencampment on the common. There Andre-Louis took his leave of them.\nBut as he was turning away he perceived a young man of the company\nperforming his morning toilet at a bucket placed upon one of the wooden\nsteps at the tail of the house on wheels. A moment he hesitated, then he\nturned frankly to M. Pantaloon, who was still at his elbow.\n\n\"If it were not unconscionable to encroach so far upon your hospitality,\nmonsieur,\" said he, \"I would beg leave to imitate that very excellent\nyoung gentleman before I leave you.\"\n\n\"But, my dear sir!\" Good-nature oozed out of every pore of the fat\nbody of the master player. \"It is nothing at all. But, by all means.\nRhodomont will provide what you require. He is the dandy of the company\nin real life, though a fire-eater on the stage. Hi, Rhodomont!\"\n\nThe young ablutionist straightened his long body from the right angle in\nwhich it had been bent over the bucket, and looked out through a foam\nof soapsuds. Pantaloon issued an order, and Rhodomont, who was indeed as\ngentle and amiable off the stage as he was formidable and terrible upon\nit, made the stranger free of the bucket in the friendliest manner.\n\nSo Andre-Louis once more removed his neckcloth and his coat, and rolled\nup the sleeves of his fine shirt, whilst Rhodomont procured him soap,\na towel, and presently a broken comb, and even a greasy hair-ribbon,\nin case the gentleman should have lost his own. This last Andre-Louis\ndeclined, but the comb he gratefully accepted, and having presently\nwashed himself clean, stood, with the towel flung over his left\nshoulder, restoring order to his dishevelled locks before a broken piece\nof mirror affixed to the door of the travelling house.\n\nHe was standing thus, the gentle Rhodomont babbled aimlessly at his\nside, when his ears caught the sound of hooves. He looked over his\nshoulder carelessly, and then stood frozen, with uplifted comb and\nloosened mouth. Away across the common, on the road that bordered it, he\nbeheld a party of seven horsemen in the blue coats with red facings of\nthe marechaussee.\n\nNot for a moment did he doubt what was the quarry of this prowling\ngendarmerie. It was as if the chill shadow of the gallows had fallen\nsuddenly upon him.\n\nAnd then the troop halted, abreast with them, and the sergeant leading\nit sent his bawling voice across the common.\n\n\"Hi, there! Hi!\" His tone rang with menace.\n\nEvery member of the company--and there were some twelve in all--stood at\ngaze. Pantaloon advanced a step or two, stalking, his head thrown back,\nhis manner that of a King's Lieutenant.\n\n\"Now, what the devil's this?\" quoth he, but whether of Fate or Heaven or\nthe sergeant, was not clear.\n\nThere was a brief colloquy among the horsemen, then they came trotting\nacross the common straight towards the players' encampment.\n\nAndre-Louis had remained standing at the tail of the travelling\nhouse. He was still passing the comb through his straggling hair,\nbut mechanically and unconsciously. His mind was all intent upon the\nadvancing troop, his wits alert and gathered together for a leap in\nwhatever direction should be indicated.\n\nStill in the distance, but evidently impatient, the sergeant bawled a\nquestion.\n\n\"Who gave you leave to encamp here?\"\n\nIt was a question that reassured Andre-Louis not at all. He was not\ndeceived by it into supposing or even hoping that the business of these\nmen was merely to round up vagrants and trespassers. That was no part of\ntheir real duty; it was something done in passing--done, perhaps, in the\nhope of levying a tax of their own. It was very long odds that they\nwere from Rennes, and that their real business was the hunting down of\na young lawyer charged with sedition. Meanwhile Pantaloon was shouting\nback.\n\n\"Who gave us leave, do you say? What leave? This is communal land, free\nto all.\"\n\nThe sergeant laughed unpleasantly, and came on, his troop following.\n\n\"There is,\" said a voice at Pantaloon's elbow, \"no such thing as\ncommunal land in the proper sense in all M. de La Tour d'Azyr's vast\ndomain. This is a terre censive, and his bailiffs collect his dues from\nall who send their beasts to graze here.\"\n\nPantaloon turned to behold at his side Andre-Louis in his shirt-sleeves,\nand without a neckcloth, the towel still trailing over his left\nshoulder, a comb in his hand, his hair half dressed.\n\n\"God of God!\" swore Pantaloon. \"But it is an ogre, this Marquis de La\nTour d'Azyr!\"\n\n\"I have told you already what I think of him,\" said Andre-Louis. \"As for\nthese fellows you had better let me deal with them. I have experience\nof their kind.\" And without waiting for Pantaloon's consent, Andre-Louis\nstepped forward to meet the advancing men of the marechaussee. He had\nrealized that here boldness alone could save him.\n\nWhen a moment later the sergeant pulled up his horse alongside of this\nhalf-dressed young man, Andre-Louis combed his hair what time he looked\nup with a half smile, intended to be friendly, ingenuous, and disarming.\n\nIn spite of it the sergeant hailed him gruffly: \"Are you the leader of\nthis troop of vagabonds?\"\n\n\"Yes... that is to say, my father, there, is really the leader.\" And he\njerked a thumb in the direction of M. Pantaloon, who stood at gaze out\nof earshot in the background. \"What is your pleasure, captain?\"\n\n\"My pleasure is to tell you that you are very likely to be gaoled for\nthis, all the pack of you.\" His voice was loud and bullying. It carried\nacross the common to the ears of every member of the company, and\nbrought them all to stricken attention where they stood. The lot of\nstrolling players was hard enough without the addition of gaolings.\n\n\"But how so, my captain? This is communal land free to all.\"\n\n\"It is nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"Where are the fences?\" quoth Andre-Louis, waving the hand that held the\ncomb, as if to indicate the openness of the place.\n\n\"Fences!\" snorted the sergeant. \"What have fences to do with the matter?\nThis is terre censive. There is no grazing here save by payment of dues\nto the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr.\"\n\n\"But we are not grazing,\" quoth the innocent Andre-Louis.\n\n\"To the devil with you, zany! You are not grazing! But your beasts are\ngrazing!\"\n\n\"They eat so little,\" Andre-Louis apologized, and again essayed his\ningratiating smile.\n\nThe sergeant grew more terrible than ever. \"That is not the point. The\npoint is that you are committing what amounts to a theft, and there's\nthe gaol for thieves.\"\n\n\"Technically, I suppose you are right,\" sighed Andre-Louis, and fell to\ncombing his hair again, still looking up into the sergeant's face. \"But\nwe have sinned in ignorance. We are grateful to you for the warning.\"\nHe passed the comb into his left hand, and with his right fumbled in\nhis breeches' pocket, whence there came a faint jingle of coins. \"We are\ndesolated to have brought you out of your way. Perhaps for their trouble\nyour men would honour us by stopping at the next inn to drink the health\nof... of this M. de La Tour d' Azyr, or any other health that they think\nproper.\"\n\nSome of the clouds lifted from the sergeant's brow. But not yet all.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said he, gruffly. \"But you must decamp, you understand.\"\nHe leaned from the saddle to bring his recipient hand to a convenient\ndistance. Andre-Louis placed in it a three-livre piece.\n\n\"In half an hour,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"Why in half an hour? Why not at once?\"\n\n\"Oh, but time to break our fast.\"\n\nThey looked at each other. The sergeant next considered the broad piece\nof silver in his palm. Then at last his features relaxed from their\nsternness.\n\n\"After all,\" said he, \"it is none of our business to play the tipstaves\nfor M. de La Tour d'Azyr. We are of the marechaussee from Rennes.\"\nAndre-Louis' eyelids played him false by flickering. \"But if you linger,\nlook out for the gardes-champetres of the Marquis. You'll find them not\nat all accommodating. Well, well--a good appetite to you, monsieur,\" said\nhe, in valediction.\n\n\"A pleasant ride, my captain,\" answered Andre-Louis.\n\nThe sergeant wheeled his horse about, his troop wheeled with him. They\nwere starting off, when he reined up again.\n\n\"You, monsieur!\" he called over his shoulder. In a bound Andre-Louis was\nbeside his stirrup. \"We are in quest of a scoundrel named Andre-Louis\nMoreau, from Gavrillac, a fugitive from justice wanted for the gallows\non a matter of sedition. You've seen nothing, I suppose, of a man whose\nmovements seemed to you suspicious?\"\n\n\"Indeed, we have,\" said Andre-Louis, very boldly, his face eager with\nconsciousness of the ability to oblige.\n\n\"You have?\" cried the sergeant, in a ringing voice. \"Where? When?\"\n\n\"Yesterday evening in the neighbourhood of Guignen...\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" the sergeant felt himself hot upon the trail.\n\n\"There was a fellow who seemed very fearful of being recognized ... a\nman of fifty or thereabouts...\"\n\n\"Fifty!\" cried the sergeant, and his face fell. \"Bah! This man of ours\nis no older than yourself, a thin wisp of a fellow of about your own\nheight and of black hair, just like your own, by the description. Keep a\nlookout on your travels, master player. The King's Lieutenant in Rennes\nhas sent us word this morning that he will pay ten louis to any one\ngiving information that will lead to this scoundrel's arrest. So there's\nten louis to be earned by keeping your eyes open, and sending word to\nthe nearest justices. It would be a fine windfall for you, that.\"\n\n\"A fine windfall, indeed, captain,\" answered Andre-Louis, laughing.\n\nBut the sergeant had touched his horse with the spur, and was already\ntrotting off in the wake of his men. Andre-Louis continued to laugh,\nquite silently, as he sometimes did when the humour of a jest was\npeculiarly keen.\n\nThen he turned slowly about, and came back towards Pantaloon and the\nrest of the company, who were now all grouped together, at gaze.\n\nPantaloon advanced to meet him with both hands out-held. For a moment\nAndre-Louis thought he was about to be embraced.\n\n\"We hail you our saviour!\" the big man declaimed. \"Already the shadow\nof the gaol was creeping over us, chilling us to the very marrow. For\nthough we be poor, yet are we all honest folk and not one of us has ever\nsuffered the indignity of prison. Nor is there one of us would survive\nit. But for you, my friend, it might have happened. What magic did you\nwork?\"\n\n\"The magic that is to be worked in France with a King's portrait. The\nFrench are a very loyal nation, as you will have observed. They love\ntheir King--and his portrait even better than himself, especially when it\nis wrought in gold. But even in silver it is respected. The sergeant\nwas so overcome by the sight of that noble visage--on a three-livre\npiece--that his anger vanished, and he has gone his ways leaving us to\ndepart in peace.\"\n\n\"Ah, true! He said we must decamp. About it, my lads! Come, come...\"\n\n\"But not until after breakfast,\" said Andre-Louis. \"A half-hour for\nbreakfast was conceded us by that loyal fellow, so deeply was he\ntouched. True, he spoke of possible gardes-champetres. But he knows as\nwell as I do that they are not seriously to be feared, and that if\nthey came, again the King's portrait--wrought in copper this time--would\nproduce the same melting effect upon them. So, my dear M. Pantaloon,\nbreak your fast at your ease. I can smell your cooking from here,\nand from the smell I argue that there is no need to wish you a good\nappetite.\"\n\n\"My friend, my saviour!\" Pantaloon flung a great arm about the young\nman's shoulders. \"You shall stay to breakfast with us.\"\n\n\"I confess to a hope that you would ask me,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE SERVICE OF THESPIS\n\nThey were, thought Andre-Louis, as he sat down to breakfast with them\nbehind the itinerant house, in the bright sunshine that tempered the\ncold breath of that November morning, an odd and yet an attractive crew.\nAn air of gaiety pervaded them. They affected to have no cares, and made\nmerry over the trials and tribulations of their nomadic life. They\nwere curiously, yet amiably, artificial; histrionic in their manner\nof discharging the most commonplace of functions; exaggerated in their\ngestures; stilted and affected in their speech. They seemed, indeed, to\nbelong to a world apart, a world of unreality which became real only\non the planks of their stage, in the glare of their footlights.\nGood-fellowship bound them one to another; and Andre-Louis reflected\ncynically that this harmony amongst them might be the cause of their\napparent unreality. In the real world, greedy striving and the emulation\nof acquisitiveness preclude such amity as was present here.\n\nThey numbered exactly eleven, three women and eight men; and they\naddressed each other by their stage names: names which denoted their\nseveral types, and never--or only very slightly--varied, no matter what\nmight be the play that they performed.\n\n\"We are,\" Pantaloon informed him, \"one of those few remaining staunch\nbands of real players, who uphold the traditions of the old Italian\nCommedia dell' Arte. Not for us to vex our memories and stultify our\nwit with the stilted phrases that are the fruit of a wretched author's\nlucubrations. Each of us is in detail his own author in a measure as he\ndevelops the part assigned to him. We are improvisers--improvisers of the\nold and noble Italian school.\"\n\n\"I had guessed as much,\" said Andre-Louis, \"when I discovered you\nrehearsing your improvisations.\"\n\nPantaloon frowned.\n\n\"I have observed, young sir, that your humour inclines to the pungent,\nnot to say the acrid. It is very well. It is I suppose, the humour that\nshould go with such a countenance. But it may lead you astray, as\nin this instance. That rehearsal--a most unusual thing with us--was\nnecessitated by the histrionic rawness of our Leandre. We are seeking\nto inculcate into him by training an art with which Nature neglected to\nendow him against his present needs. Should he continue to fail in doing\njustice to our schooling... But we will not disturb our present harmony\nwith the unpleasant anticipation of misfortunes which we still hope\nto avert. We love our Leandre, for all his faults. Let me make you\nacquainted with our company.\"\n\nAnd he proceeded to introduction in detail. He pointed out the long and\namiable Rhodomont, whom Andre-Louis already knew.\n\n\"His length of limb and hooked nose were his superficial qualifications\nto play roaring captains,\" Pantaloon explained. \"His lungs have\njustified our choice. You should hear him roar. At first we called him\nSpavento or Epouvapte. But that was unworthy of so great an artist. Not\nsince the superb Mondor amazed the world has so thrasonical a bully been\nseen upon the stage. So we conferred upon him the name of Rhodomont\nthat Mondor made famous; and I give you my word, as an actor and a\ngentleman--for I am a gentleman, monsieur, or was--that he has justified\nus.\"\n\nHis little eyes beamed in his great swollen face as he turned their gaze\nupon the object of his encomium. The terrible Rhodomont, confused by so\nmuch praise, blushed like a schoolgirl as he met the solemn scrutiny of\nAndre-Louis.\n\n\"Then here we have Scaramouche, whom also you already know. Sometimes he\nis Scapin and sometimes Coviello, but in the main Scaramouche, to which\nlet me tell you he is best suited--sometimes too well suited, I think.\nFor he is Scaramouche not only on the stage, but also in the world. He\nhas a gift of sly intrigue, an art of setting folk by the ears, combined\nwith an impudent aggressiveness upon occasion when he considers himself\nsafe from reprisals. He is Scaramouche, the little skirmisher, to the\nvery life. I could say more. But I am by disposition charitable and\nloving to all mankind.\"\n\n\"As the priest said when he kissed the serving-wench,\" snarled\nScaramouche, and went on eating.\n\n\"His humour, like your own, you will observe, is acrid,\" said Pantaloon.\nHe passed on. \"Then that rascal with the lumpy nose and the grinning\nbucolic countenance is, of course, Pierrot. Could he be aught else?\"\n\n\"I could play lovers a deal better,\" said the rustic cherub.\n\n\"That is the delusion proper to Pierrot,\" said Pantaloon,\ncontemptuously. \"This heavy, beetle-browed ruffian, who has grown old in\nsin, and whose appetite increases with his years, is Polichinelle. Each\none, as you perceive, is designed by Nature for the part he plays. This\nnimble, freckled jackanapes is Harlequin; not your spangled Harlequin\ninto which modern degeneracy has debased that first-born of Momus,\nbut the genuine original zany of the Commedia, ragged and patched, an\nimpudent, cowardly, blackguardly clown.\"\n\n\"Each one of us, as you perceive,\" said Harlequin, mimicking the leader\nof the troupe, \"is designed by Nature for the part he plays.\"\n\n\"Physically, my friend, physically only, else we should not have so much\ntrouble in teaching this beautiful Leandre to become a lover. Then\nwe have Pasquariel here, who is sometimes an apothecary, sometimes a\nnotary, sometimes a lackey--an amiable, accommodating fellow. He is also\nan excellent cook, being a child of Italy, that land of gluttons. And\nfinally, you have myself, who as the father of the company very properly\nplay as Pantaloon the roles of father. Sometimes, it is true, I am a\ndeluded husband, and sometimes an ignorant, self-sufficient doctor.\nBut it is rarely that I find it necessary to call myself other than\nPantaloon. For the rest, I am the only one who has a name--a real name.\nIt is Binet, monsieur.\n\n\"And now for the ladies... First in order of seniority we have Madame\nthere.\" He waved one of his great hands towards a buxom, smiling blonde\nof five-and-forty, who was seated on the lowest of the steps of the\ntravelling house. \"She is our Duegne, or Mother, or Nurse, as the case\nrequires. She is known quite simply and royally as Madame. If she ever\nhad a name in the world, she has long since forgotten it, which is\nperhaps as well. Then we have this pert jade with the tip-tilted nose\nand the wide mouth, who is of course our soubrette Columbine, and\nlastly, my daughter Climene, an amoureuse of talents not to be matched\noutside the Comedie Francaise, of which she has the bad taste to aspire\nto become a member.\"\n\nThe lovely Climene--and lovely indeed she was--tossed her nut-brown\ncurls and laughed as she looked across at Andre-Louis. Her eyes, he had\nperceived by now, were not blue, but hazel.\n\n\"Do not believe him, monsieur. Here I am queen, and I prefer to be queen\nhere rather than a slave in Paris.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Andre-Louis, quite solemnly, \"will be queen\nwherever she condescends to reign.\"\n\nHer only answer was a timid--timid and yet alluring--glance from under\nfluttering lids. Meanwhile her father was bawling at the comely young\nman who played lovers--\"You hear, Leandre! That is the sort of speech you\nshould practise.\"\n\nLeandre raised languid eyebrows. \"That?\" quoth he, and shrugged. \"The\nmerest commonplace.\"\n\nAndre-Louis laughed approval. \"M. Leandre is of a readier wit than you\nconcede. There is subtlety in pronouncing it a commonplace to call Mlle.\nClimene a queen.\"\n\nSome laughed, M. Binet amongst them, with good-humoured mockery.\n\n\"You think he has the wit to mean it thus? Bah! His subtleties are all\nunconscious.\"\n\nThe conversation becoming general, Andre-Louis soon learnt what yet\nthere was to learn of this strolling band. They were on their way to\nGuichen, where they hoped to prosper at the fair that was to open on\nMonday next. They would make their triumphal entry into the town at\nnoon, and setting up their stage in the old market, they would give\ntheir first performance that same Saturday night, in a new canevas--or\nscenario--of M. Binet's own, which should set the rustics gaping. And\nthen M. Binet fetched a sigh, and addressed himself to the elderly,\nswarthy, beetle-browed Polichinelle, who sat on his left.\n\n\"But we shall miss Felicien,\" said he. \"Indeed, I do not know what we\nshall do without him.\"\n\n\"Oh, we shall contrive,\" said Polichinelle, with his mouth full.\n\n\"So you always say, whatever happens, knowing that in any case the\ncontriving will not fall upon yourself.\"\n\n\"He should not be difficult to replace,\" said Harlequin.\n\n\"True, if we were in a civilized land. But where among the rustics\nof Brittany are we to find a fellow of even his poor parts?\" M. Binet\nturned to Andre-Louis. \"He was our property-man, our machinist, our\nstage-carpenter, our man of affairs, and occasionally he acted.\"\n\n\"The part of Figaro, I presume,\" said Andre-Louis, which elicited a\nlaugh.\n\n\"So you are acquainted with Beaumarchais!\" Binet eyed the young man with\nfresh interest.\n\n\"He is tolerably well known, I think.\"\n\n\"In Paris, to be sure. But I had not dreamt his fame had reached the\nwilds of Brittany.\"\n\n\"But then I was some years in Paris--at the Lycee of Louis le Grand. It\nwas there I made acquaintance with his work.\"\n\n\"A dangerous man,\" said Polichinelle, sententiously.\n\n\"Indeed, and you are right,\" Pantaloon agreed. \"Clever--I do not deny him\nthat, although myself I find little use for authors. But of a sinister\ncleverness responsible for the dissemination of many of these subversive\nnew ideas. I think such writers should be suppressed.\"\n\n\"M. de La Tour d'Azyr would probably agree with you--the gentleman who\nby the simple exertion of his will turns this communal land into his own\nproperty.\" And Andre-Louis drained his cup, which had been filled with\nthe poor vin gris that was the players' drink.\n\nIt was a remark that might have precipitated an argument had it not also\nreminded M. Binet of the terms on which they were encamped there, and\nof the fact that the half-hour was more than past. In a moment he was on\nhis feet, leaping up with an agility surprising in so corpulent a man,\nissuing his commands like a marshal on a field of battle.\n\n\"Come, come, my lads! Are we to sit guzzling here all day? Time flees,\nand there's a deal to be done if we are to make our entry into Guichen\nat noon. Go, get you dressed. We strike camp in twenty minutes. Bestir,\nladies! To your chaise, and see that you contrive to look your best.\nSoon the eyes of Guichen will be upon you, and the condition of your\ninterior to-morrow will depend upon the impression made by your exterior\nto-day. Away! Away!\"\n\nThe implicit obedience this autocrat commanded set them in a whirl.\nBaskets and boxes were dragged forth to receive the platters and remains\nof their meagre feast. In an instant the ground was cleared, and the\nthree ladies had taken their departure to the chaise, which was set\napart for their use. The men were already climbing into the house on\nwheels, when Binet turned to Andre-Louis.\n\n\"We part here, sir,\" said he, dramatically, \"the richer by your\nacquaintance; your debtors and your friends.\" He put forth his podgy\nhand.\n\nSlowly Andre-Louis took it in his own. He had been thinking swiftly in\nthe last few moments. And remembering the safety he had found from his\npursuers in the bosom of this company, it occurred to him that nowhere\ncould he be better hidden for the present, until the quest for him\nshould have died down.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"the indebtedness is on my side. It is not every day\none has the felicity to sit down with so illustrious and engaging a\ncompany.\"\n\nBinet's little eyes peered suspiciously at the young man, in quest of\nirony. He found nothing but candour and simple good faith.\n\n\"I part from you reluctantly,\" Andre-Louis continued. \"The more\nreluctantly since I do not perceive the absolute necessity for parting.\"\n\n\"How?\" quoth Binet, frowning, and slowly withdrawing the hand which the\nother had already retained rather longer than was necessary.\n\n\"Thus,\" Andre-Louis explained himself. \"You may set me down as a sort\nof knight of rueful countenance in quest of adventure, with no fixed\npurpose in life at present. You will not marvel that what I have seen of\nyourself and your distinguished troupe should inspire me to desire your\nbetter acquaintance. On your side you tell me that you are in need of\nsome one to replace your Figaro--your Felicien, I think you called him.\nWhilst it may be presumptuous of me to hope that I could discharge an\noffice so varied and so onerous...\"\n\n\"You are indulging that acrid humour of yours again, my friend,\" Binet\ninterrupted him. \"Excepting for that,\" he added, slowly, meditatively,\nhis little eyes screwed up, \"we might discuss this proposal that you\nseem to be making.\"\n\n\"Alas! we can except nothing. If you take me, you take me as I am. What\nelse is possible? As for this humour--such as it is--which you decry, you\nmight turn it to profitable account.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"In several ways. I might, for instance, teach Leandre to make love.\"\n\nPantaloon burst into laughter. \"You do not lack confidence in your\npowers. Modesty does not afflict you.\"\n\n\"Therefore I evince the first quality necessary in an actor.\"\n\n\"Can you act?\"\n\n\"Upon occasion, I think,\" said Andre-Louis, his thoughts upon his\nperformance at Rennes and Nantes, and wondering when in all his\nhistrionic career Pantaloon's improvisations had so rent the heart of\nmobs.\n\nM. Binet was musing. \"Do you know much of the theatre?\" quoth he.\n\n\"Everything,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"I said that modesty will prove no obstacle in your career.\"\n\n\"But consider. I know the work of Beaumarchais, Eglantine, Mercier,\nChenier, and many others of our contemporaries. Then I have read, of\ncourse, Moliere, Racine, Corneille, besides many other lesser French\nwriters. Of foreign authors, I am intimate with the works of Gozzi,\nGoldoni, Guarini, Bibbiena, Machiavelli, Secchi, Tasso, Ariosto,\nand Fedini. Whilst of those of antiquity I know most of the work of\nEuripides, Aristophanes, Terence, Plautus...\"\n\n\"Enough!\" roared Pantaloon.\n\n\"I am not nearly through with my list,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"You may keep the rest for another day. In Heaven's name, what can have\ninduced you to read so many dramatic authors?\"\n\n\"In my humble way I am a student of man, and some years ago I made the\ndiscovery that he is most intimately to be studied in the reflections of\nhim provided for the theatre.\"\n\n\"That is a very original and profound discovery,\" said Pantaloon, quite\nseriously. \"It had never occurred to me. Yet is it true. Sir, it is a\ntruth that dignifies our art. You are a man of parts, that is clear to\nme. It has been clear since first I met you. I can read a man. I knew\nyou from the moment that you said 'good-morning.' Tell me, now: Do\nyou think you could assist me upon occasion in the preparation of a\nscenario? My mind, fully engaged as it is with a thousand details of\norganization, is not always as clear as I would have it for such work.\nCould you assist me there, do you think?\"\n\n\"I am quite sure I could.\"\n\n\"Hum, yes. I was sure you would be. The other duties that were\nFelicien's you would soon learn. Well, well, if you are willing, you may\ncome along with us. You'd want some salary, I suppose?\"\n\n\"If it is usual,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"What should you say to ten livres a month?\"\n\n\"I should say that it isn't exactly the riches of Peru.\"\n\n\"I might go as far as fifteen,\" said Binet, reluctantly. \"But times are\nbad.\"\n\n\"I'll make them better for you.\"\n\n\"I've no doubt you believe it. Then we understand each other?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said Andre-Louis, dryly, and was thus committed to the\nservice of Thespis.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE COMIC MUSE\n\nThe company's entrance into the township of Guichen, if not exactly\ntriumphal, as Binet had expressed the desire that it should be, was at\nleast sufficiently startling and cacophonous to set the rustics gaping.\nTo them these fantastic creatures appeared--as indeed they were--beings\nfrom another world.\n\nFirst went the great travelling chaise, creaking and groaning on its\nway, drawn by two of the Flemish horses. It was Pantaloon who drove it,\nan obese and massive Pantaloon in a tight-fitting suit of scarlet under\na long brown bed-gown, his countenance adorned by a colossal cardboard\nnose. Beside him on the box sat Pierrot in a white smock, with sleeves\nthat completely covered his hands, loose white trousers, and a black\nskull-cap. He had whitened his face with flour, and he made hideous\nnoises with a trumpet.\n\nOn the roof of the coach were assembled Polichinelle, Scaramouche,\nHarlequin, and Pasquariel. Polichinelle in black and white, his doublet\ncut in the fashion of a century ago, with humps before and behind, a\nwhite frill round his neck and a black mask upon the upper half of his\nface, stood in the middle, his feet planted wide to steady him, solemnly\nand viciously banging a big drum. The other three were seated each at\none of the corners of the roof, their legs dangling over. Scaramouche,\nall in black in the Spanish fashion of the seventeenth century, his\nface adorned with a pair of mostachios, jangled a guitar discordantly.\nHarlequin, ragged and patched in every colour of the rainbow, with his\nleather girdle and sword of lath, the upper half of his face smeared\nin soot, clashed a pair of cymbals intermittently. Pasquariel, as an\napothecary in skull-cap and white apron, excited the hilarity of the\nonlookers by his enormous tin clyster, which emitted when pumped a\ndolorous squeak.\n\nWithin the chaise itself, but showing themselves freely at the windows,\nand exchanging quips with the townsfolk, sat the three ladies of the\ncompany. Climene, the amoureuse, beautifully gowned in flowered satin,\nher own clustering ringlets concealed under a pumpkin-shaped wig, looked\nso much the lady of fashion that you might have wondered what she was\ndoing in that fantastic rabble. Madame, as the mother, was also dressed\nwith splendour, but exaggerated to achieve the ridiculous. Her headdress\nwas a monstrous structure adorned with flowers, and superimposed by\nlittle ostrich plumes. Columbine sat facing them, her back to the\nhorses, falsely demure, in milkmaid bonnet of white muslin, and a\nstriped gown of green and blue.\n\nThe marvel was that the old chaise, which in its halcyon days may have\nserved to carry some dignitary of the Church, did not founder instead of\nmerely groaning under that excessive and ribald load.\n\nNext came the house on wheels, led by the long, lean Rhodomont, who\nhad daubed his face red, and increased the terror of it by a pair of\nformidable mostachios. He was in long thigh-boots and leather jerkin,\ntrailing an enormous sword from a crimson baldrick. He wore a broad\nfelt hat with a draggled feather, and as he advanced he raised his great\nvoice and roared out defiance, and threats of blood-curdling butchery\nto be performed upon all and sundry. On the roof of this vehicle sat\nLeandre alone. He was in blue satin, with ruffles, small sword,\npowdered hair, patches and spy-glass, and red-heeled shoes: the\ncomplete courtier, looking very handsome. The women of Guichen ogled\nhim coquettishly. He took the ogling as a proper tribute to his personal\nendowments, and returned it with interest. Like Climene, he looked out\nof place amid the bandits who composed the remainder of the company.\n\nBringing up the rear came Andre-Louis leading the two donkeys that\ndragged the property-cart. He had insisted upon assuming a false nose,\nrepresenting as for embellishment that which he intended for disguise.\nFor the rest, he had retained his own garments. No one paid\nany attention to him as he trudged along beside his donkeys, an\ninsignificant rear guard, which he was well content to be.\n\nThey made the tour of the town, in which the activity was already\nabove the normal in preparation for next week's fair. At intervals\nthey halted, the cacophony would cease abruptly, and Polichinelle would\nannounce in a stentorian voice that at five o'clock that evening in the\nold market, M. Binet's famous company of improvisers would perform a new\ncomedy in four acts entitled, \"The Heartless Father.\"\n\nThus at last they came to the old market, which was the groundfloor of\nthe town hall, and open to the four winds by two archways on each\nside of its length, and one archway on each side of its breadth. These\narchways, with two exceptions, had been boarded up. Through those\ntwo, which gave admission to what presently would be the theatre, the\nragamuffins of the town, and the niggards who were reluctant to spend\nthe necessary sous to obtain proper admission, might catch furtive\nglimpses of the performance.\n\nThat afternoon was the most strenuous of Andre-Louis' life, unaccustomed\nas he was to any sort of manual labour. It was spent in erecting and\npreparing the stage at one end of the market-hall; and he began to\nrealize how hard-earned were to be his monthly fifteen livres. At first\nthere were four of them to the task--or really three, for Pantaloon did\nno more than bawl directions. Stripped of their finery, Rhodomont and\nLeandre assisted Andre-Louis in that carpentering. Meanwhile the other\nfour were at dinner with the ladies. When a half-hour or so later they\ncame to carry on the work, Andre-Louis and his companions went to dine\nin their turn, leaving Polichinelle to direct the operations as well as\nassist in them.\n\nThey crossed the square to the cheap little inn where they had taken up\ntheir quarters. In the narrow passage Andre-Louis came face to face\nwith Climene, her fine feathers cast, and restored by now to her normal\nappearance.\n\n\"And how do you like it?\" she asked him, pertly.\n\nHe looked her in the eyes. \"It has its compensations,\" quoth he, in that\ncurious cold tone of his that left one wondering whether he meant or not\nwhat he seemed to mean.\n\nShe knit her brows. \"You... you feel the need of compensations already?\"\n\n\"Faith, I felt it from the beginning,\" said he. \"It was the perception\nof them allured me.\"\n\nThey were quite alone, the others having gone on into the room set apart\nfor them, where food was spread. Andre-Louis, who was as unlearned in\nWoman as he was learned in Man, was not to know, upon feeling himself\nsuddenly extraordinarily aware of her femininity, that it was she who in\nsome subtle, imperceptible manner so rendered him.\n\n\"What,\" she asked him, with demurest innocence, \"are these\ncompensations?\"\n\nHe caught himself upon the brink of the abyss.\n\n\"Fifteen livres a month,\" said he, abruptly.\n\nA moment she stared at him bewildered. He was very disconcerting. Then\nshe recovered.\n\n\"Oh, and bed and board,\" said she. \"Don't be leaving that from the\nreckoning, as you seem to be doing; for your dinner will be going cold.\nAren't you coming?\"\n\n\"Haven't you dined?\" he cried, and she wondered had she caught a note of\neagerness.\n\n\"No,\" she answered, over her shoulder. \"I waited.\"\n\n\"What for?\" quoth his innocence, hopefully.\n\n\"I had to change, of course, zany,\" she answered, rudely. Having dragged\nhim, as she imagined, to the chopping-block, she could not refrain from\nchopping. But then he was of those who must be chopping back.\n\n\"And you left your manners upstairs with your grand-lady clothes,\nmademoiselle. I understand.\"\n\nA scarlet flame suffused her face. \"You are very insolent,\" she said,\nlamely.\n\n\"I've often been told so. But I don't believe it.\" He thrust open the\ndoor for her, and bowing with an air which imposed upon her, although it\nwas merely copied from Fleury of the Comedie Francaise, so often visited\nin the Louis le Grand days, he waved her in. \"After you, ma demoiselle.\"\nFor greater emphasis he deliberately broke the word into its two\ncomponent parts.\n\n\"I thank you, monsieur,\" she answered, frostily, as near sneering as was\npossible to so charming a person, and went in, nor addressed him again\nthroughout the meal. Instead, she devoted herself with an unusual and\ndevastating assiduity to the suspiring Leandre, that poor devil who\ncould not successfully play the lover with her on the stage because of\nhis longing to play it in reality.\n\nAndre-Louis ate his herrings and black bread with a good appetite\nnevertheless. It was poor fare, but then poor fare was the common lot of\npoor people in that winter of starvation, and since he had cast in his\nfortunes with a company whose affairs were not flourishing, he must\naccept the evils of the situation philosophically.\n\n\"Have you a name?\" Binet asked him once in the course of that repast and\nduring a pause in the conversation.\n\n\"It happens that I have,\" said he. \"I think it is Parvissimus.\"\n\n\"Parvissimus?\" quoth Binet. \"Is that a family name?\"\n\n\"In such a company, where only the leader enjoys the privilege of a\nfamily name, the like would be unbecoming its least member. So I take\nthe name that best becomes in me. And I think it is Parvissimus--the very\nleast.\"\n\nBinet was amused. It was droll; it showed a ready fancy. Oh, to be sure,\nthey must get to work together on those scenarios.\n\n\"I shall prefer it to carpentering,\" said Andre-Louis. Nevertheless he\nhad to go back to it that afternoon, and to labour strenuously until\nfour o'clock, when at last the autocratic Binet announced himself\nsatisfied with the preparations, and proceeded, again with the help of\nAndre-Louis, to prepare the lights, which were supplied partly by tallow\ncandles and partly by lamps burning fish-oil.\n\nAt five o'clock that evening the three knocks were sounded, and the\ncurtain rose on \"The Heartless Father.\"\n\nAmong the duties inherited by Andre-Louis from the departed Felicien\nwhom he replaced, was that of doorkeeper. This duty he discharged\ndressed in a Polichinelle costume, and wearing a pasteboard nose. It was\nan arrangement mutually agreeable to M. Binet and himself. M. Binet--who\nhad taken the further precaution of retaining Andre-Louis' own\ngarments--was thereby protected against the risk of his latest recruit\nabsconding with the takings. Andre-Louis, without illusions on the score\nof Pantaloon's real object, agreed to it willingly enough, since it\nprotected him from the chance of recognition by any acquaintance who\nmight possibly be in Guichen.\n\nThe performance was in every sense unexciting; the audience meagre and\nunenthusiastic. The benches provided in the front half of the market\ncontained some twenty-seven persons: eleven at twenty sous a head and\nsixteen at twelve. Behind these stood a rabble of some thirty others at\nsix sous apiece. Thus the gross takings were two louis, ten livres, and\ntwo sous. By the time M. Binet had paid for the use of the market, his\nlights, and the expenses of his company at the inn over Sunday, there\nwas not likely to be very much left towards the wages of his players. It\nis not surprising, therefore, that M. Binet's bonhomie should have been\na trifle overcast that evening.\n\n\"And what do you think of it?\" he asked Andre-Louis, as they were\nwalking back to the inn after the performance.\n\n\"Possibly it could have been worse; probably it could not,\" said he.\n\nIn sheer amazement M. Binet checked in his stride, and turned to look at\nhis companion.\n\n\"Huh!\" said he. \"Dieu de Dien! But you are frank.\"\n\n\"An unpopular form of service among fools, I know.\"\n\n\"Well, I am not a fool,\" said Binet.\n\n\"That is why I am frank. I pay you the compliment of assuming\nintelligence in you, M. Binet.\"\n\n\"Oh, you do?\" quoth M. Binet. \"And who the devil are you to assume\nanything? Your assumptions are presumptuous, sir.\" And with that he\nlapsed into silence and the gloomy business of mentally casting up his\naccounts.\n\nBut at table over supper a half-hour later he revived the topic.\n\n\"Our latest recruit, this excellent M. Parvissimus,\" he announced, \"has\nthe impudence to tell me that possibly our comedy could have been worse,\nbut that probably it could not.\" And he blew out his great round cheeks\nto invite a laugh at the expense of that foolish critic.\n\n\"That's bad,\" said the swarthy and sardonic Polichinelle. He was\ngrave as Rhadamanthus pronouncing judgment. \"That's bad. But what is\ninfinitely worse is that the audience had the impudence to be of the\nsame mind.\"\n\n\"An ignorant pack of clods,\" sneered Leandre, with a toss of his\nhandsome head.\n\n\"You are wrong,\" quoth Harlequin. \"You were born for love, my dear, not\ncriticism.\"\n\nLeandre--a dull dog, as you will have conceived--looked contemptuously\ndown upon the little man. \"And you, what were you born for?\" he\nwondered.\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" was the candid admission. \"Nor yet why. It is the case\nof many of us, my dear, believe me.\"\n\n\"But why\"--M. Binet took him up, and thus spoilt the beginnings of a very\npretty quarrel--\"why do you say that Leandre is wrong?\"\n\n\"To be general, because he is always wrong. To be particular, because I\njudge the audience of Guichen to be too sophisticated for 'The Heartless\nFather.'\"\n\n\"You would put it more happily,\" interposed Andre-Louis--who was the\ncause of this discussion--\"if you said that 'The Heartless Father' is too\nunsophisticated for the audience of Guichen.\"\n\n\"Why, what's the difference?\" asked Leandre.\n\n\"I didn't imply a difference. I merely suggested that it is a happier\nway to express the fact.\"\n\n\"The gentleman is being subtle,\" sneered Binet.\n\n\"Why happier?\" Harlequin demanded.\n\n\"Because it is easier to bring 'The Heartless Father' to the\nsophistication of the Guichen audience, than the Guichen audience to the\nunsophistication of 'The Heartless Father.'\"\n\n\"Let me think it out,\" groaned Polichinelle, and he took his head in his\nhands.\n\nBut from the tail of the table Andre-Louis was challenged by Climene who\nsat there between Columbine and Madame.\n\n\"You would alter the comedy, would you, M. Parvissimus?\" she cried.\n\nHe turned to parry her malice.\n\n\"I would suggest that it be altered,\" he corrected, inclining his head.\n\n\"And how would you alter it, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I? Oh, for the better.\"\n\n\"But of course!\" She was sleekest sarcasm. \"And how would you do it?\"\n\n\"Aye, tell us that,\" roared M. Binet, and added: \"Silence, I pray you,\ngentlemen and ladies. Silence for M. Parvissimus.\"\n\nAndre-Louis looked from father to daughter, and smiled. \"Pardi!\" said\nhe. \"I am between bludgeon and dagger. If I escape with my life, I shall\nbe fortunate. Why, then, since you pin me to the very wall, I'll tell\nyou what I should do. I should go back to the original and help myself\nmore freely from it.\"\n\n\"The original?\" questioned M. Binet--the author.\n\n\"It is called, I believe, 'Monsieur de Pourceaugnac,' and was written by\nMoliere.\"\n\nSomebody tittered, but that somebody was not M. Binet. He had been\ntouched on the raw, and the look in his little eyes betrayed the fact\nthat his bonhomme exterior covered anything but a bonhomme.\n\n\"You charge me with plagiarism,\" he said at last; \"with filching the\nideas of Moliere.\"\n\n\"There is always, of course,\" said Andre-Louis, unruffled, \"the\nalternative possibility of two great minds working upon parallel lines.\"\n\nM. Binet studied the young man attentively a moment. He found him bland\nand inscrutable, and decided to pin him down.\n\n\"Then you do not imply that I have been stealing from Moliere?\"\n\n\"I advise you to do so, monsieur,\" was the disconcerting reply.\n\nM. Binet was shocked.\n\n\"You advise me to do so! You advise me, me, Antoine Binet, to turn thief\nat my age!\"\n\n\"He is outrageous,\" said mademoiselle, indignantly.\n\n\"Outrageous is the word. I thank you for it, my dear. I take you on\ntrust, sir. You sit at my table, you have the honour to be included in\nmy company, and to my face you have the audacity to advise me to\nbecome a thief--the worst kind of thief that is conceivable, a thief of\nspiritual things, a thief of ideas! It is insufferable, intolerable! I\nhave been, I fear, deeply mistaken in you, monsieur; just as you appear\nto have been mistaken in me. I am not the scoundrel you suppose me, sir,\nand I will not number in my company a man who dares to suggest that I\nshould become one. Outrageous!\"\n\nHe was very angry. His voice boomed through the little room, and the\ncompany sat hushed and something scared, their eyes upon Andre-Louis,\nwho was the only one entirely unmoved by this outburst of virtuous\nindignation.\n\n\"You realize, monsieur,\" he said, very quietly, \"that you are insulting\nthe memory of the illustrious dead?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Binet.\n\nAndre-Louis developed his sophistries.\n\n\"You insult the memory of Moliere, the greatest ornament of our stage,\none of the greatest ornaments of our nation, when you suggest that there\nis vileness in doing that which he never hesitated to do, which no great\nauthor yet has hesitated to do. You cannot suppose that Moliere ever\ntroubled himself to be original in the matter of ideas. You cannot\nsuppose that the stories he tells in his plays have never been told\nbefore. They were culled, as you very well know--though you seem\nmomentarily to have forgotten it, and it is therefore necessary that\nI should remind you--they were culled, many of them, from the Italian\nauthors, who themselves had culled them Heaven alone knows where.\nMoliere took those old stories and retold them in his own language. That\nis precisely what I am suggesting that you should do. Your company is a\ncompany of improvisers. You supply the dialogue as you proceed, which\nis rather more than Moliere ever attempted. You may, if you prefer\nit--though it would seem to me to be yielding to an excess of scruple--go\nstraight to Boccaccio or Sacchetti. But even then you cannot be sure\nthat you have reached the sources.\"\n\nAndre-Louis came off with flying colours after that. You see what a\ndebater was lost in him; how nimble he was in the art of making white\nlook black. The company was impressed, and no one more that M. Binet,\nwho found himself supplied with a crushing argument against those who in\nfuture might tax him with the impudent plagiarisms which he undoubtedly\nperpetrated. He retired in the best order he could from the position he\nhad taken up at the outset.\n\n\"So that you think,\" he said, at the end of a long outburst of\nagreement, \"you think that our story of 'The Heartless Father' could be\nenriched by dipping into 'Monsieur de Pourceaugnac,' to which I confess\nupon reflection that it may present certain superficial resemblances?\"\n\n\"I do; most certainly I do--always provided that you do so judiciously.\nTimes have changed since Moliere.\" It was as a consequence of this that\nBinet retired soon after, taking Andre-Louis with him. The pair sat\ntogether late that night, and were again in close communion throughout\nthe whole of Sunday morning.\n\nAfter dinner M. Binet read to the assembled company the amended and\namplified canevas of \"The Heartless Father,\" which, acting upon the\nadvice of M. Parvissimus, he had been at great pains to prepare. The\ncompany had few doubts as to the real authorship before he began to\nread; none at all when he had read. There was a verve, a grip about this\nstory; and, what was more, those of them who knew their Moliere realized\nthat far from approaching the original more closely, this canevas had\ndrawn farther away from it. Moliere's original part--the title role--had\ndwindled into insignificance, to the great disgust of Polichinelle, to\nwhom it fell. But the other parts had all been built up into importance,\nwith the exception of Leandre, who remained as before. The two\ngreat roles were now Scaramouche, in the character of the intriguing\nSbrigandini, and Pantaloon the father. There was, too, a comical part\nfor Rhodomont, as the roaring bully hired by Polichinelle to cut Leandre\ninto ribbons. And in view of the importance now of Scaramouche, the play\nhad been rechristened \"Figaro-Scaramouche.\"\n\nThis last had not been without a deal of opposition from M. Binet. But\nhis relentless collaborator, who was in reality the real author--drawing\nshamelessly, but practically at last upon his great store of reading--had\noverborne him.\n\n\"You must move with the times, monsieur. In Paris Beaumarchais is the\nrage. 'Figaro' is known to-day throughout the world. Let us borrow a\nlittle of his glory. It will draw the people in. They will come to\nsee half a 'Figaro' when they will not come to see a dozen 'Heartless\nFathers.' Therefore let us cast the mantle of Figaro upon some one, and\nproclaim it in our title.\"\n\n\"But as I am the head of the company...\" began M. Binet, weakly.\n\n\"If you will be blind to your interests, you will presently be a head\nwithout a body. And what use is that? Can the shoulders of Pantaloon\ncarry the mantle of Figaro? You laugh. Of course you laugh. The notion\nis absurd. The proper person for the mantle of Figaro is Scaramouche,\nwho is naturally Figaro's twin-brother.\"\n\nThus tyrannized, the tyrant Binet gave way, comforted by the reflection\nthat if he understood anything at all about the theatre, he had for\nfifteen livres a month acquired something that would presently be\nearning him as many louis.\n\nThe company's reception of the canevas now confirmed him, if we\nexcept Polichinelle, who, annoyed at having lost half his part in the\nalterations, declared the new scenario fatuous.\n\n\"Ah! You call my work fatuous, do you?\" M. Binet hectored him.\n\n\"Your work?\" said Polichinelle, to add with his tongue in his cheek:\n\"Ah, pardon. I had not realized that you were the author.\"\n\n\"Then realize it now.\"\n\n\"You were very close with M. Parvissimus over this authorship,\" said\nPolichinelle, with impudent suggestiveness.\n\n\"And what if I was? What do you imply?\"\n\n\"That you took him to cut quills for you, of course.\"\n\n\"I'll cut your ears for you if you're not civil,\" stormed the infuriated\nBinet.\n\nPolichinelle got up slowly, and stretched himself.\n\n\"Dieu de Dieu!\" said he. \"If Pantaloon is to play Rhodomont, I think\nI'll leave you. He is not amusing in the part.\" And he swaggered out\nbefore M. Binet had recovered from his speechlessness.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. EXIT MONSIEUR PARVISSIMUS\n\nAr four o'clock on Monday afternoon the curtain rose on\n\"Figaro-Scaramouche\" to an audience that filled three quarters of the\nmarket-hall. M. Binet attributed this good attendance to the influx of\npeople to Guichen for the fair, and to the magnificent parade of his\ncompany through the streets of the township at the busiest time of\nthe day. Andre-Louis attributed it entirely to the title. It was the\n\"Figaro\" touch that had fetched in the better-class bourgeoisie, which\nfilled more than half of the twenty-sous places and three quarters\nof the twelve-sous seats. The lure had drawn them. Whether it was to\ncontinue to do so would depend upon the manner in which the canevas\nover which he had laboured to the glory of Binet was interpreted by\nthe company. Of the merits of the canevas itself he had no doubt. The\nauthors upon whom he had drawn for the elements of it were sound, and he\nhad taken of their best, which he claimed to be no more than the justice\ndue to them.\n\nThe company excelled itself. The audience followed with relish the sly\nintriguings of Scaramouche, delighted in the beauty and freshness of\nClimene, was moved almost to tears by the hard fate which through four\nlong acts kept her from the hungering arms of the so beautiful Leandre,\nhowled its delight over the ignominy of Pantaloon, the buffooneries of\nhis sprightly lackey Harlequin, and the thrasonical strut and bellowing\nfierceness of the cowardly Rhodomont.\n\nThe success of the Binet troupe in Guichen was assured. That night the\ncompany drank Burgundy at M. Binet's expense. The takings reached the\nsum of eight louis, which was as good business as M. Binet had ever done\nin all his career. He was very pleased. Gratification rose like steam\nfrom his fat body. He even condescended so far as to attribute a share\nof the credit for the success to M. Parvissimus.\n\n\"His suggestion,\" he was careful to say, by way of properly delimiting\nthat share, \"was most valuable, as I perceived at the time.\"\n\n\"And his cutting of quills,\" growled Polichinelle. \"Don't forget that.\nIt is most important to have by you a man who understands how to cut a\nquill, as I shall remember when I turn author.\"\n\nBut not even that gibe could stir M. Binet out of his lethargy of\ncontent.\n\nOn Tuesday the success was repeated artistically and augmented\nfinancially. Ten louis and seven livres was the enormous sum that\nAndre-Louis, the doorkeeper, counted over to M. Binet after the\nperformance. Never yet had M. Binet made so much money in one\nevening--and a miserable little village like Guichen was certainly the\nlast place in which he would have expected this windfall.\n\n\"Ah, but Guichen in time of fair,\" Andre-Louis reminded him. \"There are\npeople here from as far as Nantes and Rennes to buy and sell. To-morrow,\nbeing the last day of the fair, the crowds will be greater than ever. We\nshould better this evening's receipts.\"\n\n\"Better them? I shall be quite satisfied if we do as well, my friend.\"\n\n\"You can depend upon that,\" Andre-Louis assured him. \"Are we to have\nBurgundy?\"\n\nAnd then the tragedy occurred. It announced itself in a succession of\nbumps and thuds, culminating in a crash outside the door that brought\nthem all to their feet in alarm.\n\nPierrot sprang to open, and beheld the tumbled body of a man lying\nat the foot of the stairs. It emitted groans, therefore it was alive.\nPierrot went forward to turn it over, and disclosed the fact that\nthe body wore the wizened face of Scaramouche, a grimacing, groaning,\ntwitching Scaramouche.\n\nThe whole company, pressing after Pierrot, abandoned itself to laughter.\n\n\"I always said you should change parts with me,\" cried Harlequin.\n\"You're such an excellent tumbler. Have you been practising?\"\n\n\"Fool!\" Scaramouche snapped. \"Must you be laughing when I've all but\nbroken my neck?\"\n\n\"You are right. We ought to be weeping because you didn't break it.\nCome, man, get up,\" and he held out a hand to the prostrate rogue.\n\nScaramouche took the hand, clutched it, heaved himself from the ground,\nthen with a scream dropped back again.\n\n\"My foot!\" he complained.\n\nBinet rolled through the group of players, scattering them to right and\nleft. Apprehension had been quick to seize him. Fate had played him such\ntricks before.\n\n\"What ails your foot?\" quoth he, sourly.\n\n\"It's broken, I think,\" Scaramouche complained.\n\n\"Broken? Bah! Get up, man.\" He caught him under the armpits and hauled\nhim up.\n\nScaramouche came howling to one foot; the other doubled under him when\nhe attempted to set it down, and he must have collapsed again but that\nBinet supported him. He filled the place with his plaint, whilst Binet\nswore amazingly and variedly.\n\n\"Must you bellow like a calf, you fool? Be quiet. A chair here, some\none.\"\n\nA chair was thrust forward. He crushed Scaramouche down into it.\n\n\"Let us look at this foot of yours.\"\n\nHeedless of Scaramouche's howls of pain, he swept away shoe and\nstocking.\n\n\"What ails it?\" he asked, staring. \"Nothing that I can see.\" He seized\nit, heel in one hand, instep in the other, and gyrated it. Scaramouche\nscreamed in agony, until Climene caught Binet's arm and made him stop.\n\n\"My God, have you no feelings?\" she reproved her father. \"The lad has\nhurt his foot. Must you torture him? Will that cure it?\"\n\n\"Hurt his foot!\" said Binet. \"I can see nothing the matter with his\nfoot--nothing to justify all this uproar. He has bruised it, maybe...\"\n\n\"A man with a bruised foot doesn't scream like that,\" said Madame over\nClimene's shoulder. \"Perhaps he has dislocated it.\"\n\n\"That is what I fear,\" whimpered Scaramouche.\n\nBinet heaved himself up in disgust.\n\n\"Take him to bed,\" he bade them, \"and fetch a doctor to see him.\"\n\nIt was done, and the doctor came. Having seen the patient, he reported\nthat nothing very serious had happened, but that in falling he had\nevidently sprained his foot a little. A few days' rest and all would be\nwell.\n\n\"A few days!\" cried Binet. \"God of God! Do you mean that he can't walk?\"\n\n\"It would be unwise, indeed impossible for more than a few steps.\"\n\nM. Binet paid the doctor's fee, and sat down to think. He filled himself\na glass of Burgundy, tossed it off without a word, and sat thereafter\nstaring into the empty glass.\n\n\"It is of course the sort of thing that must always be happening to me,\"\nhe grumbled to no one in particular. The members of the company were all\nstanding in silence before him, sharing his dismay. \"I might have known\nthat this--or something like it--would occur to spoil the first vein of\nluck that I have found in years. Ah, well, it is finished. To-morrow we\npack and depart. The best day of the fair, on the crest of the wave of\nour success--a good fifteen louis to be taken, and this happens! God of\nGod!\"\n\n\"Do you mean to abandon to-morrow's performance?\"\n\nAll turned to stare with Binet at Andre-Louis.\n\n\"Are we to play 'Figaro-Scaramouche' without Scaramouche?\" asked Binet,\nsneering.\n\n\"Of course not.\" Andre-Louis came forward. \"But surely some\nrearrangement of the parts is possible. For instance, there is a fine\nactor in Polichinelle.\"\n\nPolichinelle swept him a bow. \"Overwhelmed,\" said he, ever sardonic.\n\n\"But he has a part of his own,\" objected Binet.\n\n\"A small part, which Pasquariel could play.\"\n\n\"And who will play Pasquariel?\"\n\n\"Nobody. We delete it. The play need not suffer.\"\n\n\"He thinks of everything,\" sneered Polichinelle. \"What a man!\"\n\nBut Binet was far from agreement. \"Are you suggesting that Polichinelle\nshould play Scaramouche?\" he asked, incredulously.\n\n\"Why not? He is able enough!\"\n\n\"Overwhelmed again,\" interjected Polichinelle.\n\n\"Play Scaramouche with that figure?\" Binet heaved himself up to point a\ndenunciatory finger at Polichinelle's sturdy, thick-set shortness.\n\n\"For lack of a better,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"Overwhelmed more than ever.\" Polichinelle's bow was superb this time.\n\"Faith, I think I'll take the air to cool me after so much blushing.\"\n\n\"Go to the devil,\" Binet flung at him.\n\n\"Better and better.\" Polichinelle made for the door. On the threshold he\nhalted and struck an attitude. \"Understand me, Binet. I do not now play\nScaramouche in any circumstances whatever.\" And he went out. On the\nwhole, it was a very dignified exit.\n\nAndre-Louis shrugged, threw out his arms, and let them fall to his sides\nagain. \"You have ruined everything,\" he told M. Binet. \"The matter could\neasily have been arranged. Well, well, it is you are master here;\nand since you want us to pack and be off, that is what we will do, I\nsuppose.\"\n\nHe went out, too. M. Binet stood in thought a moment, then followed him,\nhis little eyes very cunning. He caught him up in the doorway. \"Let us\ntake a walk together, M. Parvissimus,\" said he, very affably.\n\nHe thrust his arm through Andre-Louis', and led him out into the street,\nwhere there was still considerable movement. Past the booths that ranged\nabout the market they went, and down the hill towards the bridge. \"I\ndon't think we shall pack to-morrow,\" said M. Binet, presently. \"In\nfact, we shall play to-morrow night.\"\n\n\"Not if I know Polichinelle. You have...\"\n\n\"I am not thinking of Polichinelle.\"\n\n\"Of whom, then?\"\n\n\"Of yourself.\"\n\n\"I am flattered, sir. And in what capacity are you thinking of me?\"\nThere was something too sleek and oily in Binet's voice for Andre-Louis'\ntaste.\n\n\"I am thinking of you in the part of Scaramouche.\"\n\n\"Day-dreams,\" said Andre-Louis. \"You are amusing yourself, of course.\"\n\n\"Not in the least. I am quite serious.\"\n\n\"But I am not an actor.\"\n\n\"You told me that you could be.\"\n\n\"Oh, upon occasion... a small part, perhaps...\"\n\n\"Well, here is a big part--the chance to arrive at a single stride. How\nmany men have had such a chance?\"\n\n\"It is a chance I do not covet, M. Binet. Shall we change the subject?\"\nHe was very frosty, as much perhaps because he scented in M. Binet's\nmanner something that was vaguely menacing as for any other reason.\n\n\"We'll change the subject when I please,\" said M. Binet, allowing a\nglimpse of steel to glimmer through the silk of him. \"To-morrow night\nyou play Scaramouche. You are ready enough in your wits, your figure is\nideal, and you have just the kind of mordant humour for the part. You\nshould be a great success.\"\n\n\"It is much more likely that I should be an egregious failure.\"\n\n\"That won't matter,\" said Binet, cynically, and explained himself.\n\"The failure will be personal to yourself. The receipts will be safe by\nthen.\"\n\n\"Much obliged,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"We should take fifteen louis to-morrow night.\"\n\n\"It is unfortunate that you are without a Scaramouche,\" said\nAndre-Louis.\n\n\"It is fortunate that I have one, M. Parvissimus.\"\n\nAndre-Louis disengaged his arm. \"I begin to find you tiresome,\" said he.\n\"I think I will return.\"\n\n\"A moment, M. Parvissimus. If I am to lose that fifteen louis... you'll\nnot take it amiss that I compensate myself in other ways?\"\n\n\"That is your own concern, M. Binet.\"\n\n\"Pardon, M. Parvissimus. It may possibly be also yours.\" Binet took his\narm again. \"Do me the kindness to step across the street with me. Just\nas far as the post-office there. I have something to show you.\"\n\nAndre-Louis went. Before they reached that sheet of paper nailed upon\nthe door, he knew exactly what it would say. And in effect it was, as he\nhad supposed, that twenty louis would be paid for information leading to\nthe apprehension of one Andre-Louis Moreau, lawyer of Gavrillac, who was\nwanted by the King's Lieutenant in Rennes upon a charge of sedition.\n\nM. Binet watched him whilst he read. Their arms were linked, and Binet's\ngrip was firm and powerful.\n\n\"Now, my friend,\" said he, \"will you be M. Parvissimus and play\nScaramouche to-morrow, or will you be Andre-Louis Moreau of Gavrillac\nand go to Rennes to satisfy the King's Lieutenant?\"\n\n\"And if it should happen that you are mistaken?\" quoth Andre-Louis, his\nface a mask.\n\n\"I'll take the risk of that,\" leered M. Binet. \"You mentioned, I think,\nthat you were a lawyer. An indiscretion, my dear. It is unlikely that\ntwo lawyers will be in hiding at the same time in the same district. You\nsee it is not really clever of me. Well, M. Andre-Louis Moreau, lawyer\nof Gavrillac, what is it to be?\"\n\n\"We will talk it over as we walk back,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"What is there to talk over?\"\n\n\"One or two things, I think. I must know where I stand. Come, sir, if\nyou please.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said M. Binet, and they turned up the street again, but M.\nBinet maintained a firm hold of his young friend's arm, and kept himself\non the alert for any tricks that the young gentleman might be disposed\nto play. It was an unnecessary precaution. Andre-Louis was not the man\nto waste his energy futilely. He knew that in bodily strength he was no\nmatch at all for the heavy and powerful Pantaloon.\n\n\"If I yield to your most eloquent and seductive persuasions, M. Binet,\"\nsaid he, sweetly, \"what guarantee do you give me that you will not sell\nme for twenty louis after I shall have served your turn?\"\n\n\"You have my word of honour for that.\" M. Binet was emphatic.\n\nAndre-Louis laughed. \"Oh, we are to talk of honour, are we? Really, M.\nBinet? It is clear you think me a fool.\"\n\nIn the dark he did not see the flush that leapt to M. Binet's round\nface. It was some moments before he replied.\n\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" he growled. \"What guarantee do you want?\"\n\n\"I do not know what guarantee you can possibly give.\"\n\n\"I have said that I will keep faith with you.\"\n\n\"Until you find it more profitable to sell me.\"\n\n\"You have it in your power to make it more profitable always for me\nto keep faith with you. It is due to you that we have done so well in\nGuichen. Oh, I admit it frankly.\"\n\n\"In private,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\nM. Binet left the sarcasm unheeded.\n\n\"What you have done for us here with 'Figaro-Scaramouche,' you can do\nelsewhere with other things. Naturally, I shall not want to lose you.\nThat is your guarantee.\"\n\n\"Yet to-night you would sell me for twenty louis.\"\n\n\"Because--name of God!--you enrage me by refusing me a service well within\nyour powers. Don't you think, had I been entirely the rogue you think\nme, I could have sold you on Saturday last? I want you to understand me,\nmy dear Parvissimus.\"\n\n\"I beg that you'll not apologize. You would be more tiresome than ever.\"\n\n\"Of course you will be gibing. You never miss a chance to gibe. It'll\nbring you trouble before you're done with life. Come; here we are back\nat the inn, and you have not yet given me your decision.\"\n\nAndre-Louis looked at him. \"I must yield, of course. I can't help\nmyself.\"\n\nM. Binet released his arm at last, and slapped him heartily upon the\nback. \"Well declared, my lad. You'll never regret it. If I know anything\nof the theatre, I know that you have made the great decision of your\nlife. To-morrow night you'll thank me.\"\n\nAndre-Louis shrugged, and stepped out ahead towards the inn. But M.\nBinet called him back.\n\n\"M. Parvissimus!\"\n\nHe turned. There stood the man's great bulk, the moonlight beating down\nupon that round fat face of his, and he was holding out his hand.\n\n\"M. Parvissimus, no rancour. It is a thing I do not admit into my life.\nYou will shake hands with me, and we will forget all this.\"\n\nAndre-Louis considered him a moment with disgust. He was growing\nangry. Then, realizing this, he conceived himself ridiculous, almost as\nridiculous as that sly, scoundrelly Pantaloon. He laughed and took the\noutstretched hand. \"No rancour?\" M. Binet insisted.\n\n\"Oh, no rancour,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. ENTER SCARAMOUCHE\n\nDressed in the close-fitting suit of a bygone age, all black, from flat\nvelvet cap to rosetted shoes, his face whitened and a slight up-curled\nmoustache glued to his upper lip, a small-sword at his side and a guitar\nslung behind him, Scaramouche surveyed himself in a mirror, and was\ndisposed to be sardonic--which was the proper mood for the part.\n\nHe reflected that his life, which until lately had been of a stagnant,\ncontemplative quality, had suddenly become excessively active. In the\ncourse of one week he had been lawyer, mob-orator, outlaw, property-man,\nand finally buffoon. Last Wednesday he had been engaged in moving\nan audience of Rennes to anger; on this Wednesday he was to move an\naudience of Guichen to mirth. Then he had been concerned to draw tears;\nto-day it was his business to provoke laughter. There was a difference,\nand yet there was a parallel. Then as now he had been a comedian; and\nthe part that he had played then was, when you came to think of it, akin\nto the part he was to play this evening. For what had he been at Rennes\nbut a sort of Scaramouche--the little skirmisher, the astute intriguer,\nspattering the seed of trouble with a sly hand? The only difference\nlay in the fact that to-day he went forth under the name that properly\ndescribed his type, whereas last week he had been disguised as a\nrespectable young provincial attorney.\n\nHe bowed to his reflection in the mirror.\n\n\"Buffoon!\" he apostrophized it. \"At last you have found yourself. At\nlast you have come into your heritage. You should be a great success.\"\n\nHearing his new name called out by M. Binet, he went below to find the\ncompany assembled, and waiting in the entrance corridor of the inn.\n\nHe was, of course, an object of great interest to all the company. Most\ncritically was he conned by M. Binet and mademoiselle; by the former\nwith gravely searching eyes, by the latter with a curl of scornful lip.\n\n\"You'll do,\" M. Binet commended his make-up. \"At least you look the\npart.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately men are not always what they look,\" said Climene, acidly.\n\n\"That is a truth that does not at present apply to me,\" said\nAndre-Louis. \"For it is the first time in my life that I look what I\nam.\"\n\nMademoiselle curled her lip a little further, and turned her shoulder\nto him. But the others thought him very witty--probably because he was\nobscure. Columbine encouraged him with a friendly smile that displayed\nher large white teeth, and M. Binet swore yet once again that he would\nbe a great success, since he threw himself with such spirit into the\nundertaking. Then in a voice that for the moment he appeared to have\nborrowed from the roaring captain, M. Binet marshalled them for the\nshort parade across to the market-hall.\n\nThe new Scaramouche fell into place beside Rhodomont. The old one,\nhobbling on a crutch, had departed an hour ago to take the place of\ndoorkeeper, vacated of necessity by Andre-Louis. So that the exchange\nbetween those two was a complete one.\n\nHeaded by Polichinelle banging his great drum and Pierrot blowing his\ntrumpet, they set out, and were duly passed in review by the ragamuffins\ndrawn up in files to enjoy so much of the spectacle as was to be\nobtained for nothing.\n\nTen minutes later the three knocks sounded, and the curtains were drawn\naside to reveal a battered set that was partly garden, partly forest, in\nwhich Climene feverishly looked for the coming of Leandre. In the wings\nstood the beautiful, melancholy lover, awaiting his cue, and immediately\nbehind him the unfledged Scaramouche, who was anon to follow him.\n\nAndre-Louis was assailed with nausea in that dread moment. He attempted\nto take a lightning mental review of the first act of this scenario of\nwhich he was himself the author-in-chief; but found his mind a complete\nblank. With the perspiration starting from his skin, he stepped back to\nthe wall, where above a dim lantern was pasted a sheet bearing the\nbrief outline of the piece. He was still studying it, when his arm\nwas clutched, and he was pulled violently towards the wings. He had a\nglimpse of Pantaloon's grotesque face, its eyes blazing, and he caught a\nraucous growl:\n\n\"Climene has spoken your cue three times already.\"\n\nBefore he realized it, he had been bundled on to the stage, and stood\nthere foolishly, blinking in the glare of the footlights, with their tin\nreflectors. So utterly foolish and bewildered did he look that volley\nupon volley of laughter welcomed him from the audience, which this\nevening packed the hall from end to end. Trembling a little, his\nbewilderment at first increasing, he stood there to receive that rolling\ntribute to his absurdity. Climene was eyeing him with expectant\nmockery, savouring in advance his humiliation; Leandre regarded him in\nconsternation, whilst behind the scenes, M. Binet was dancing in fury.\n\n\"Name of a name,\" he groaned to the rather scared members of the company\nassembled there, \"what will happen when they discover that he isn't\nacting?\"\n\nBut they never did discover it. Scaramouche's bewildered paralysis\nlasted but a few seconds. He realized that he was being laughed at, and\nremembered that his Scaramouche was a creature to be laughed with, and\nnot at. He must save the situation; twist it to his own advantage as\nbest he could. And now his real bewilderment and terror was succeeded by\nacted bewilderment and terror far more marked, but not quite so funny.\nHe contrived to make it clearly appear that his terror was of some one\noff the stage. He took cover behind a painted shrub, and thence, the\nlaughter at last beginning to subside, he addressed himself to Climene\nand Leandre.\n\n\"Forgive me, beautiful lady, if the abrupt manner of my entrance\nstartled you. The truth is that I have never been the same since that\nlast affair of mine with Almaviva. My heart is not what it used to be.\nDown there at the end of the lane I came face to face with an elderly\ngentleman carrying a heavy cudgel, and the horrible thought entered my\nmind that it might be your father, and that our little stratagem to get\nyou safely married might already have been betrayed to him. I think it\nwas the cudgel put such notion in my head. Not that I am afraid. I am\nnot really afraid of anything. But I could not help reflecting that, if\nit should really have been your father, and he had broken my head with\nhis cudgel, your hopes would have perished with me. For without me, what\nshould you have done, my poor children?\"\n\nA ripple of laughter from the audience had been steadily enheartening\nhim, and helping him to recover his natural impudence. It was clear they\nfound him comical. They were to find him far more comical than ever he\nhad intended, and this was largely due to a fortuitous circumstance upon\nwhich he had insufficiently reckoned. The fear of recognition by some\none from Gavrillac or Rennes had been strong upon him. His face was\nsufficiently made up to baffle recognition; but there remained his\nvoice. To dissemble this he had availed himself of the fact that Figaro\nwas a Spaniard. He had known a Spaniard at Louis le Grand who spoke\na fluent but most extraordinary French, with a grotesque excess of\nsibilant sounds. It was an accent that he had often imitated, as youths\nwill imitate characteristics that excite their mirth. Opportunely he had\nbethought him of that Spanish student, and it was upon his speech\nthat to-night he modelled his own. The audience of Guichen found it as\nlaughable on his lips as he and his fellows had found it formerly on the\nlips of that derided Spaniard.\n\nMeanwhile, behind the scenes, Binet--listening to that glib impromptu of\nwhich the scenario gave no indication--had recovered from his fears.\n\n\"Dieu de Dieu!\" he whispered, grinning. \"Did he do it, then, on\npurpose?\"\n\nIt seemed to him impossible that a man who had been so terror-stricken\nas he had fancied Andre-Louis, could have recovered his wits so quickly\nand completely. Yet the doubt remained.\n\nTo resolve it after the curtain had fallen upon a first act that had\ngone with a verve unrivalled until this hour in the annals of the\ncompany, borne almost entirely upon the slim shoulders of the new\nScaramouche, M. Binet bluntly questioned him.\n\nThey were standing in the space that did duty as green-room, the company\nall assembled there, showering congratulations upon their new recruit.\nScaramouche, a little exalted at the moment by his success, however\ntrivial he might consider it to-morrow, took then a full revenge upon\nClimene for the malicious satisfaction with which she had regarded his\nmomentary blank terror.\n\n\"I do not wonder that you ask,\" said he. \"Faith, I should have warned\nyou that I intended to do my best from the start to put the audience\nin a good humour with me. Mademoiselle very nearly ruined everything by\nrefusing to reflect any of my terror. She was not even startled.\nAnother time, mademoiselle, I shall give you full warning of my every\nintention.\"\n\nShe crimsoned under her grease-paint. But before she could find an\nanswer of sufficient venom, her father was rating her soundly for her\nstupidity--the more soundly because himself he had been deceived by\nScaramouche's supreme acting.\n\nScaramouche's success in the first act was more than confirmed as\nthe performance proceeded. Completely master of himself by now, and\nstimulated as only success can stimulate, he warmed to his work.\nImpudent, alert, sly, graceful, he incarnated the very ideal of\nScaramouche, and he helped out his own native wit by many a remembered\nline from Beaumarchais, thereby persuading the better informed among the\naudience that here indeed was something of the real Figaro, and bringing\nthem, as it were, into touch with the great world of the capital.\n\nWhen at last the curtain fell for the last time, it was Scaramouche\nwho shared with Climene the honours of the evening, his name that was\ncoupled with hers in the calls that summoned them before the curtains.\n\nAs they stepped back, and the curtains screened them again from the\ndeparting audience, M. Binet approached them, rubbing his fat hands\nsoftly together. This runagate young lawyer, whom chance had blown into\nhis company, had evidently been sent by Fate to make his fortune for\nhim. The sudden success at Guichen, hitherto unrivalled, should be\nrepeated and augmented elsewhere. There would be no more sleeping under\nhedges and tightening of belts. Adversity was behind him. He placed a\nhand upon Scaramouche's shoulder, and surveyed him with a smile whose\noiliness not even his red paint and colossal false nose could dissemble.\n\n\"And what have you to say to me now?\" he asked him. \"Was I wrong when\nI assured you that you would succeed? Do you think I have followed my\nfortunes in the theatre for a lifetime without knowing a born actor when\nI see one? You are my discovery, Scaramouche. I have discovered you\nto yourself. I have set your feet upon the road to fame and fortune. I\nawait your thanks.\"\n\nScaramouche laughed at him, and his laugh was not altogether pleasant.\n\n\"Always Pantaloon!\" said he.\n\nThe great countenance became overcast. \"I see that you do not yet\nforgive me the little stratagem by which I forced you to do justice to\nyourself. Ungrateful dog! As if I could have had any purpose but to make\nyou; and I have done so. Continue as you have begun, and you will end in\nParis. You may yet tread the stage of the Comedie Francaise, the rival\nof Talma, Fleury, and Dugazon. When that happens to you perhaps you will\nfeel the gratitude that is due to old Binet, for you will owe it all to\nthis soft-hearted old fool.\"\n\n\"If you were as good an actor on the stage as you are in private,\" said\nScaramouche, \"you would yourself have won to the Comedie Francaise long\nsince. But I bear no rancour, M. Binet.\" He laughed, and put out his\nhand.\n\nBinet fell upon it and wrung it heartily.\n\n\"That, at least, is something,\" he declared. \"My boy, I have great plans\nfor you--for us. To-morrow we go to Maure; there is a fair there to the\nend of this week. Then on Monday we take our chances at Pipriac, and\nafter that we must consider. It may be that I am about to realize the\ndream of my life. There must have been upwards of fifteen louis taken\nto-night. Where the devil is that rascal Cordemais?\"\n\nCordemais was the name of the original Scaramouche, who had so\nunfortunately twisted his ankle. That Binet should refer to him by his\nsecular designation was a sign that in the Binet company at least he had\nfallen for ever from the lofty eminence of Scaramouche.\n\n\"Let us go and find him, and then we'll away to the inn and crack a\nbottle of the best Burgundy, perhaps two bottles.\"\n\nBut Cordemais was not readily to be found. None of the company had\nseen him since the close of the performance. M. Binet went round to the\nentrance. Cordemais was not there. At first he was annoyed; then as he\ncontinued in vain to bawl the fellow's name, he began to grow uneasy;\nlastly, when Polichinelle, who was with them, discovered Cordemais'\ncrutch standing discarded behind the door, M. Binet became alarmed.\nA dreadful suspicion entered his mind. He grew visibly pale under his\npaint.\n\n\"But this evening he couldn't walk without the crutch!\" he exclaimed.\n\"How then does he come to leave it there and take himself off?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he has gone on to the inn,\" suggested some one.\n\n\"But he couldn't walk without his crutch,\" M. Binet insisted.\n\nNevertheless, since clearly he was not anywhere about the market-hall,\nto the inn they all trooped, and deafened the landlady with their\ninquiries.\n\n\"Oh, yes, M. Cordemais came in some time ago.\"\n\n\"Where is he now?\"\n\n\"He went away again at once. He just came for his bag.\"\n\n\"For his bag!\" Binet was on the point of an apoplexy. \"How long ago was\nthat?\"\n\nShe glanced at the timepiece on the overmantel. \"It would be about half\nan hour ago. It was a few minutes before the Rennes diligence passed\nthrough.\"\n\n\"The Rennes diligence!\" M. Binet was almost inarticulate. \"Could he...\ncould he walk?\" he asked, on a note of terrible anxiety.\n\n\"Walk? He ran like a hare when he left the inn. I thought, myself, that\nhis agility was suspicious, seeing how lame he had been since he fell\ndownstairs yesterday. Is anything wrong?\"\n\nM. Binet had collapsed into a chair. He took his head in his hands, and\ngroaned.\n\n\"The scoundrel was shamming all the time!\" exclaimed Climene. \"His fall\ndownstairs was a trick. He was playing for this. He has swindled us.\"\n\n\"Fifteen louis at least--perhaps sixteen!\" said M. Binet. \"Oh, the\nheartless blackguard! To swindle me who have been as a father to him--and\nto swindle me in such a moment.\"\n\nFrom the ranks of the silent, awe-stricken company, each member of\nwhich was wondering by how much of the loss his own meagre pay would be\nmulcted, there came a splutter of laughter.\n\nM. Binet glared with blood-injected eyes.\n\n\"Who laughs?\" he roared. \"What heartless wretch has the audacity to\nlaugh at my misfortune?\"\n\nAndre-Louis, still in the sable glories of Scaramouche, stood forward.\nHe was laughing still.\n\n\"It is you, is it? You may laugh on another note, my friend, if I choose\na way to recoup myself that I know of.\"\n\n\"Dullard!\" Scaramouche scorned him. \"Rabbit-brained elephant! What if\nCordemais has gone with fifteen louis? Hasn't he left you something\nworth twenty times as much?\"\n\nM. Binet gaped uncomprehending.\n\n\"You are between two wines, I think. You've been drinking,\" he\nconcluded.\n\n\"So I have--at the fountain of Thalia. Oh, don't you see? Don't you see\nthe treasure that Cordemais has left behind him?\"\n\n\"What has he left?\"\n\n\"A unique idea for the groundwork of a scenario. It unfolds itself all\nbefore me. I'll borrow part of the title from Moliere. We'll call it\n'Les Fourberies de Scaramouche,' and if we don't leave the audiences of\nMaure and Pipriac with sides aching from laughter I'll play the dullard\nPantaloon in future.\"\n\nPolichinelle smacked fist into palm. \"Superb!\" he said, fiercely. \"To\ncull fortune from misfortune, to turn loss into profit, that is to have\ngenius.\"\n\nScaramouche made a leg. \"Polichinelle, you are a fellow after my own\nheart. I love a man who can discern my merit. If Pantaloon had half\nyour wit, we should have Burgundy to-night in spite of the flight of\nCordemais.\"\n\n\"Burgundy?\" roared M. Binet, and before he could get farther Harlequin\nhad clapped his hands together.\n\n\"That is the spirit, M. Binet. You heard him, landlady. He called for\nBurgundy.\"\n\n\"I called for nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"But you heard him, dear madame. We all heard him.\"\n\nThe others made chorus, whilst Scaramouche smiled at him, and patted his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Up, man, a little courage. Did you not say that fortune awaits us? And\nhave we not now the wherewithal to constrain fortune? Burgundy, then,\nto... to toast 'Les Fourberies de Scaramouche.'\"\n\nAnd M. Binet, who was not blind to the force of the idea, yielded, took\ncourage, and got drunk with the rest.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. CLIMENE\n\nDiligent search among the many scenarios of the improvisers which have\nsurvived their day, has failed to bring to light the scenario of \"Les\nFourberies de Scaramouche,\" upon which we are told the fortunes of the\nBinet troupe came to be soundly established. They played it for the\nfirst time at Maure in the following week, with Andre-Louis--who was\nknown by now as Scaramouche to all the company, and to the public\nalike--in the title-role. If he had acquitted himself well as\nFigaro-Scaramouche, he excelled himself in the new piece, the scenario\nof which would appear to be very much the better of the two.\n\nAfter Maure came Pipriac, where four performances were given, two\nof each of the scenarios that now formed the backbone of the Binet\nrepertoire. In both Scaramouche, who was beginning to find himself,\nmaterially improved his performances. So smoothly now did the two pieces\nrun that Scaramouche actually suggested to Binet that after Fougeray,\nwhich they were to visit in the following week, they should tempt\nfortune in a real theatre in the important town of Redon. The notion\nterrified Binet at first, but coming to think of it, and his ambition\nbeing fanned by Andre-Louis, he ended by allowing himself to succumb to\nthe temptation.\n\nIt seemed to Andre-Louis in those days that he had found his real\nmetier, and not only was he beginning to like it, but actually to look\nforward to a career as actor-author that might indeed lead him in the\nend to that Mecca of all comedians, the Comedie Francaise. And there\nwere other possibilities. From the writing of skeleton scenarios for\nimprovisers, he might presently pass to writing plays of dialogue, plays\nin the proper sense of the word, after the manner of Chenier, Eglantine,\nand Beaumarchais.\n\nThe fact that he dreamed such dreams shows us how very kindly he had\ntaken to the profession into which Chance and M. Binet between them had\nconspired to thrust him. That he had real talent both as author and\nas actor I do not doubt, and I am persuaded that had things fallen out\ndifferently he would have won for himself a lasting place among French\ndramatists, and thus fully have realized that dream of his.\n\nNow, dream though it was, he did not neglect the practical side of it.\n\n\"You realize,\" he told M. Binet, \"that I have it in my power to make\nyour fortune for you.\"\n\nHe and Binet were sitting alone together in the parlour of the inn at\nPipriac, drinking a very excellent bottle of Volnay. It was on the night\nafter the fourth and last performance there of \"Les Feurberies.\" The\nbusiness in Pipriac had been as excellent as in Maure and Guichen. You\nwill have gathered this from the fact that they drank Volnay.\n\n\"I will concede it, my dear Scaramouche, so that I may hear the sequel.\"\n\n\"I am disposed to exercise this power if the inducement is sufficient.\nYou will realize that for fifteen livres a month a man does not sell\nsuch exceptional gifts as mine.\n\n\"There is an alternative,\" said M. Binet, darkly.\n\n\"There is no alternative. Don't be a fool, Binet.\"\n\nBinet sat up as if he had been prodded. Members of his company did not\ntake this tone of direct rebuke with him.\n\n\"Anyway, I make you a present of it,\" Scaramouche pursued, airily.\n\"Exercise it if you please. Step outside and inform the police that they\ncan lay hands upon one Andre-Louis Moreau. But that will be the end of\nyour fine dreams of going to Redon, and for the first time in your life\nplaying in a real theatre. Without me, you can't do it, and you know\nit; and I am not going to Redon or anywhere else, in fact I am not even\ngoing to Fougeray, until we have an equitable arrangement.\"\n\n\"But what heat!\" complained Binet, \"and all for what? Why must you\nassume that I have the soul of a usurer? When our little arrangement was\nmade, I had no idea how could I?--that you would prove as valuable to me\nas you are? You had but to remind me, my dear Scaramouche. I am a just\nman. As from to-day you shall have thirty livres a month. See, I double\nit at once. I am a generous man.\"\n\n\"But you are not ambitious. Now listen to me, a moment.\"\n\nAnd he proceeded to unfold a scheme that filled Binet with a paralyzing\nterror.\n\n\"After Redon, Nantes,\" he said. \"Nantes and the Theatre Feydau.\"\n\nM. Binet choked in the act of drinking. The Theatre Feydau was a sort\nof provincial Comedie Francaise. The great Fleury had played there to\nan audience as critical as any in France. The very thought of Redon,\ncherished as it had come to be by M. Binet, gave him at moments a cramp\nin the stomach, so dangerously ambitious did it seem to him. And Redon\nwas a puppet-show by comparison with Nantes. Yet this raw lad whom\nhe had picked up by chance three weeks ago, and who in that time had\nblossomed from a country attorney into author and actor, could talk of\nNantes and the Theatre Feydau without changing colour.\n\n\"But why not Paris and the Comedie Francaise?\" wondered M. Binet, with\nsarcasm, when at last he had got his breath.\n\n\"That may come later,\" says impudence.\n\n\"Eh? You've been drinking, my friend.\"\n\nBut Andre-Louis detailed the plan that had been forming in his mind.\nFougeray should be a training-ground for Redon, and Redon should be a\ntraining-ground for Nantes. They would stay in Redon as long as Redon\nwould pay adequately to come and see them, working hard to perfect\nthemselves the while. They would add three or four new players of talent\nto the company; he would write three or four fresh scenarios, and these\nshould be tested and perfected until the troupe was in possession of at\nleast half a dozen plays upon which they could depend; they would lay\nout a portion of their profits on better dresses and better scenery, and\nfinally in a couple of months' time, if all went well, they should be\nready to make their real bid for fortune at Nantes. It was quite true\nthat distinction was usually demanded of the companies appearing at\nthe Feydau, but on the other hand Nantes had not seen a troupe of\nimprovisers for a generation and longer. They would be supplying a\nnovelty to which all Nantes should flock provided that the work were\nreally well done, and Scaramouche undertook--pledged himself--that\nif matters were left in his own hands, his projected revival of\nthe Commedia dell' Arte in all its glories would exceed whatever\nexpectations the public of Nantes might bring to the theatre.\n\n\"We'll talk of Paris after Nantes,\" he finished, supremely\nmatter-of-fact, \"just as we will definitely decide on Nantes after\nRedon.\"\n\nThe persuasiveness that could sway a mob ended by sweeping M. Binet off\nhis feet. The prospect which Scaramouche unfolded, if terrifying, was\nalso intoxicating, and as Scaramouche delivered a crushing answer to\neach weakening objection in a measure as it was advanced, Binet ended by\npromising to think the matter over.\n\n\"Redon will point the way,\" said Andre-Louis, \"and I don't doubt which\nway Redon will point.\"\n\nThus the great adventure of Redon dwindled to insignificance. Instead\nof a terrifying undertaking in itself, it became merely a rehearsal for\nsomething greater. In his momentary exaltation Binet proposed another\nbottle of Volnay. Scaramouche waited until the cork was drawn before he\ncontinued.\n\n\"The thing remains possible,\" said he then, holding his glass to the\nlight, and speaking casually, \"as long as I am with you.\"\n\n\"Agreed, my dear Scaramouche, agreed. Our chance meeting was a fortunate\nthing for both of us.\"\n\n\"For both of us,\" said Scaramouche, with stress. \"That is as I would\nhave it. So that I do not think you will surrender me just yet to the\npolice.\"\n\n\"As if I could think of such a thing! My dear Scaramouche, you amuse\nyourself. I beg that you will never, never allude to that little joke of\nmine again.\"\n\n\"It is forgotten,\" said Andre-Louis. \"And now for the remainder of my\nproposal. If I am to become the architect of your fortunes, if I am to\nbuild them as I have planned them, I must also and in the same degree\nbecome the architect of my own.\"\n\n\"In the same degree?\" M. Binet frowned.\n\n\"In the same degree. From to-day, if you please, we will conduct\nthe affairs of this company in a proper manner, and we will keep\naccount-books.\"\n\n\"I am an artist,\" said M. Binet, with pride. \"I am not a merchant.\"\n\n\"There is a business side to your art, and that shall be conducted in\nthe business manner. I have thought it all out for you. You shall not\nbe troubled with details that might hinder the due exercise of your art.\nAll that you have to do is to say yes or no to my proposal.\"\n\n\"Ah? And the proposal?\"\n\n\"Is that you constitute me your partner, with an equal share in the\nprofits of your company.\"\n\nPantaloon's great countenance grew pale, his little eyes widened to\ntheir fullest extent as he conned the face of his companion. Then he\nexploded.\n\n\"You are mad, of course, to make me a proposal so monstrous.\"\n\n\"It has its injustices, I admit. But I have provided for them. It would\nnot, for instance, be fair that in addition to all that I am proposing\nto do for you, I should also play Scaramouche and write your scenarios\nwithout any reward outside of the half-profit which would come to me as\na partner. Thus before the profits come to be divided, there is a salary\nto be paid me as actor, and a small sum for each scenario with which I\nprovide the company; that is a matter for mutual agreement. Similarly,\nyou shall be paid a salary as Pantaloon. After those expenses are\ncleared up, as well as all the other salaries and disbursements, the\nresidue is the profit to be divided equally between us.\"\n\nIt was not, as you can imagine, a proposal that M. Binet would swallow\nat a draught. He began with a point-blank refusal to consider it.\n\n\"In that case, my friend,\" said Scaramouche, \"we part company at once.\nTo-morrow I shall bid you a reluctant farewell.\"\n\nBinet fell to raging. He spoke of ingratitude in feeling terms; he\neven permitted himself another sly allusion to that little jest of his\nconcerning the police, which he had promised never again to mention.\n\n\"As to that, you may do as you please. Play the informer, by all\nmeans. But consider that you will just as definitely be deprived of\nmy services, and that without me you are nothing--as you were before I\njoined your company.\"\n\nM. Binet did not care what the consequences might be. A fig for the\nconsequences! He would teach this impudent young country attorney that\nM. Binet was not the man to be imposed upon.\n\nScaramouche rose. \"Very well,\" said he, between indifference and\nresignation. \"As you wish. But before you act, sleep on the matter. In\nthe cold light of morning you may see our two proposals in their proper\nproportions. Mine spells fortune for both of us. Yours spells ruin for\nboth of us. Good-night, M. Binet. Heaven help you to a wise decision.\"\n\nThe decision to which M. Binet finally came was, naturally, the only one\npossible in the face of so firm a resolve as that of Andre-Louis, who\nheld the trumps. Of course there were further discussions, before all\nwas settled, and M. Binet was brought to an agreement only after an\ninfinity of haggling surprising in one who was an artist and not a\nman of business. One or two concessions were made by Andre-Louis; he\nconsented, for instance, to waive his claim to be paid for scenarios,\nand he also consented that M. Binet should appoint himself a salary that\nwas out of all proportion to his deserts.\n\nThus in the end the matter was settled, and the announcement duly\nmade to the assembled company. There were, of course, jealousies and\nresentments. But these were not deep-seated, and they were readily\nswallowed when it was discovered that under the new arrangement the lot\nof the entire company was to be materially improved from the point\nof view of salaries. This was a matter that had met with considerable\nopposition from M. Binet. But the irresistible Scaramouche swept away\nall objections.\n\n\"If we are to play at the Feydau, you want a company of self-respecting\ncomedians, and not a pack of cringing starvelings. The better we pay\nthem in reason, the more they will earn for us.\"\n\nThus was conquered the company's resentment of this too swift promotion\nof its latest recruit. Cheerfully now--with one exception--they accepted\nthe dominance of Scaramouche, a dominance soon to be so firmly\nestablished that M. Binet himself came under it.\n\nThe one exception was Climene. Her failure to bring to heel this\ninteresting young stranger, who had almost literally dropped into their\nmidst that morning outside Guichen, had begotten in her a malice which\nhis persistent ignoring of her had been steadily inflaming. She had\nremonstrated with her father when the new partnership was first formed.\nShe had lost her temper with him, and called him a fool, whereupon M.\nBinet--in Pantaloon's best manner--had lost his temper in his turn and\nboxed her ears. She piled it up to the account of Scaramouche, and\nspied her opportunity to pay off some of that ever-increasing score. But\nopportunities were few. Scaramouche was too occupied just then. During\nthe week of preparation at Fougeray, he was hardly seen save at the\nperformances, whilst when once they were at Redon, he came and went like\nthe wind between the theatre and the inn.\n\nThe Redon experiment had justified itself from the first. Stimulated and\nencouraged by this, Andre-Louis worked day and night during the month\nthat they spent in that busy little town. The moment had been well\nchosen, for the trade in chestnuts of which Redon is the centre was just\nthen at its height. And every afternoon the little theatre was packed\nwith spectators. The fame of the troupe had gone forth, borne by the\nchestnut-growers of the district, who were bringing their wares to Redon\nmarket, and the audiences were made up of people from the surrounding\ncountry, and from neighbouring villages as far out as Allaire,\nSaint-Perrieux and Saint-Nicholas. To keep the business from slackening,\nAndre-Louis prepared a new scenario every week. He wrote three in\naddition to those two with which he had already supplied the company;\nthese were \"The Marriage of Pantaloon,\" \"The Shy Lover,\" and \"The\nTerrible Captain.\" Of these the last was the greatest success. It was\nbased upon the \"Miles Gloriosus\" of Plautus, with great opportunities\nfor Rhodomont, and a good part for Scaramouche as the roaring captain's\nsly lieutenant. Its success was largely due to the fact that Andre-Louis\namplified the scenario to the extent of indicating very fully in places\nthe lines which the dialogue should follow, whilst here and there he\nhad gone so far as to supply some of the actual dialogue to be spoken,\nwithout, however, making it obligatory upon the actors to keep to the\nletter of it.\n\nAnd meanwhile as the business prospered, he became busy with tailors,\nimproving the wardrobe of the company, which was sorely in need of\nimprovement. He ran to earth a couple of needy artists, lured them into\nthe company to play small parts--apothecaries and notaries--and set them\nto beguile their leisure in painting new scenery, so as to be ready\nfor what he called the conquest of Nantes, which was to come in the new\nyear. Never in his life had he worked so hard; never in his life had he\nworked at all by comparison with his activities now. His fund of energy\nand enthusiasm was inexhaustible, like that of his good humour. He came\nand went, acted, wrote, conceived, directed, planned, and executed,\nwhat time M. Binet took his ease at last in comparative affluence, drank\nBurgundy every night, ate white bread and other delicacies, and began\nto congratulate himself upon his astuteness in having made this\nindustrious, tireless fellow his partner. Having discovered how idle\nhad been his fears of performing at Redon, he now began to dismiss the\nterrors with which the notion of Nantes had haunted him.\n\nAnd his happiness was reflected throughout the ranks of his company,\nwith the single exception always of Climene. She had ceased to sneer at\nScaramouche, having realized at last that her sneers left him untouched\nand recoiled upon herself. Thus her almost indefinable resentment of him\nwas increased by being stifled, until, at all costs, an outlet for it\nmust be found.\n\nOne day she threw herself in his way as he was leaving the theatre after\nthe performance. The others had already gone, and she had returned upon\npretence of having forgotten something.\n\n\"Will you tell me what I have done to you?\" she asked him, point-blank.\n\n\"Done to me, mademoiselle?\" He did not understand.\n\nShe made a gesture of impatience. \"Why do you hate me?\"\n\n\"Hate you, mademoiselle? I do not hate anybody. It is the most stupid of\nall the emotions. I have never hated--not even my enemies.\"\n\n\"What Christian resignation!\"\n\n\"As for hating you, of all people! Why... I consider you adorable. I\nenvy Leandre every day of my life. I have seriously thought of setting\nhim to play Scaramouche, and playing lovers myself.\"\n\n\"I don't think you would be a success,\" said she.\n\n\"That is the only consideration that restrains me. And yet, given\nthe inspiration that is given Leandre, it is possible that I might be\nconvincing.\"\n\n\"Why, what inspiration do you mean?\"\n\n\"The inspiration of playing to so adorable a Climene.\"\n\nHer lazy eyes were now alert to search that lean face of his.\n\n\"You are laughing at me,\" said she, and swept past him into the theatre\non her pretended quest. There was nothing to be done with such a fellow.\nHe was utterly without feeling. He was not a man at all.\n\nYet when she came forth again at the end of some five minutes, she found\nhim still lingering at the door.\n\n\"Not gone yet?\" she asked him, superciliously.\n\n\"I was waiting for you, mademoiselle. You will be walking to the inn. If\nI might escort you...\"\n\n\"But what gallantry! What condescension!\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would prefer that I did not?\"\n\n\"How could I prefer that, M. Scaramouche? Besides, we are both going the\nsame way, and the streets are common to all. It is that I am overwhelmed\nby the unusual honour.\"\n\nHe looked into her piquant little face, and noted how obscured it was by\nits cloud of dignity. He laughed.\n\n\"Perhaps I feared that the honour was not sought.\"\n\n\"Ah, now I understand,\" she cried. \"It is for me to seek these honours.\nI am to woo a man before he will pay me the homage of civility. It must\nbe so, since you, who clearly know everything, have said so. It remains\nfor me to beg your pardon for my ignorance.\"\n\n\"It amuses you to be cruel,\" said Scaramouche. \"No matter. Shall we\nwalk?\"\n\nThey set out together, stepping briskly to warm their blood against\nthe wintry evening air. Awhile they went in silence, yet each furtively\nobserving the other.\n\n\"And so, you find me cruel?\" she challenged him at length, thereby\nbetraying the fact that the accusation had struck home.\n\nHe looked at her with a half smile. \"Will you deny it?\"\n\n\"You are the first man that ever accused me of that.\"\n\n\"I dare not suppose myself the first man to whom you have been cruel.\nThat were an assumption too flattering to myself. I must prefer to think\nthat the others suffered in silence.\"\n\n\"Mon Dieu! Have you suffered?\" She was between seriousness and raillery.\n\n\"I place the confession as an offering on the altar of your vanity.\"\n\n\"I should never have suspected it.\"\n\n\"How could you? Am I not what your father calls a natural actor? I was\nan actor long before I became Scaramouche. Therefore I have laughed. I\noften do when I am hurt. When you were pleased to be disdainful, I acted\ndisdain in my turn.\"\n\n\"You acted very well,\" said she, without reflecting.\n\n\"Of course. I am an excellent actor.\"\n\n\"And why this sudden change?\"\n\n\"In response to the change in you. You have grown weary of your part of\ncruel madam--a dull part, believe me, and unworthy of your talents. Were\nI a woman and had I your loveliness and your grace, Climene, I should\ndisdain to use them as weapons of offence.\"\n\n\"Loveliness and grace!\" she echoed, feigning amused surprise. But the\nvain baggage was mollified. \"When was it that you discovered this beauty\nand this grace, M. Scaramouche?\"\n\nHe looked at her a moment, considering the sprightly beauty of her, the\nadorable femininity that from the first had so irresistibly attracted\nhim.\n\n\"One morning when I beheld you rehearsing a love-scene with Leandre.\"\n\nHe caught the surprise that leapt to her eyes, before she veiled them\nunder drooping lids from his too questing gaze.\n\n\"Why, that was the first time you saw me.\"\n\n\"I had no earlier occasion to remark your charms.\"\n\n\"You ask me to believe too much,\" said she, but her tone was softer than\nhe had ever known it yet.\n\n\"Then you'll refuse to believe me if I confess that it was this grace\nand beauty that determined my destiny that day by urging me to join your\nfather's troupe.\"\n\nAt that she became a little out of breath. There was no longer any\nquestion of finding an outlet for resentment. Resentment was all\nforgotten.\n\n\"But why? With what object?\"\n\n\"With the object of asking you one day to be my wife.\"\n\nShe halted under the shock of that, and swung round to face him. Her\nglance met his own without, shyness now; there was a hardening glitter\nin her eyes, a faint stir of colour in her cheeks. She suspected him of\nan unpardonable mockery.\n\n\"You go very fast, don't you?\" she asked him, with heat.\n\n\"I do. Haven't you observed it? I am a man of sudden impulses. See what\nI have made of the Binet troupe in less than a couple of months. Another\nmight have laboured for a year and not achieved the half of it. Shall I\nbe slower in love than in work? Would it be reasonable to expect it? I\nhave curbed and repressed myself not to scare you by precipitancy. In\nthat I have done violence to my feelings, and more than all in using the\nsame cold aloofness with which you chose to treat me. I have waited--oh!\nso patiently--until you should tire of that mood of cruelty.\"\n\n\"You are an amazing man,\" said she, quite colourlessly.\n\n\"I am,\" he agreed with her. \"It is only the conviction that I am not\ncommonplace that has permitted me to hope as I have hoped.\"\n\nMechanically, and as if by tacit consent, they resumed their walk.\n\n\"And I ask you to observe,\" he said, \"when you complain that I go very\nfast, that, after all, I have so far asked you for nothing.\"\n\n\"How?\" quoth she, frowning.\n\n\"I have merely told you of my hopes. I am not so rash as to ask at once\nwhether I may realize them.\"\n\n\"My faith, but that is prudent,\" said she, tartly.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nIt was his self-possession that exasperated her; for after that she\nwalked the short remainder of the way in silence, and so, for the\nmoment, the matter was left just there.\n\nBut that night, after they had supped, it chanced that when Climene was\nabout to retire, he and she were alone together in the room abovestairs\nthat her father kept exclusively for his company. The Binet Troupe, you\nsee, was rising in the world.\n\nAs Climene now rose to withdraw for the night, Scaramouche rose with her\nto light her candle. Holding it in her left hand, she offered him her\nright, a long, tapering, white hand at the end of a softly rounded arm\nthat was bare to the elbow.\n\n\"Good-night, Scaramouche,\" she said, but so softly, so tenderly, that he\ncaught his breath, and stood conning her, his dark eyes aglow.\n\nThus a moment, then he took the tips of her fingers in his grasp, and\nbowing over the hand, pressed his lips upon it. Then he looked at\nher again. The intense femininity of her lured him on, invited him,\nsurrendered to him. Her face was pale, there was a glitter in her eyes,\na curious smile upon her parted lips, and under its fichu-menteur her\nbosom rose and fell to complete the betrayal of her.\n\nBy the hand he continued to hold, he drew her towards him. She came\nunresisting. He took the candle from her, and set it down on the\nsideboard by which she stood. The next moment her slight, lithe body was\nin his arms, and he was kissing her, murmuring her name as if it were a\nprayer.\n\n\"Am I cruel now?\" she asked him, panting. He kissed her again for only\nanswer. \"You made me cruel because you would not see,\" she told him next\nin a whisper.\n\nAnd then the door opened, and M. Binet came in to have his paternal eyes\nregaled by this highly indecorous behaviour of his daughter.\n\nHe stood at gaze, whilst they quite leisurely, and in a self-possession\ntoo complete to be natural, detached each from the other.\n\n\"And what may be the meaning of this?\" demanded M. Binet, bewildered and\nprofoundly shocked.\n\n\"Does it require explaining?\" asked Scaramouche. \"Doesn't it speak for\nitself--eloquently? It means that Climene and I have taken it into our\nheads to be married.\"\n\n\"And doesn't it matter what I may take into my head?\"\n\n\"Of course. But you could have neither the bad taste nor the bad heart\nto offer any obstacle.\"\n\n\"You take that for granted? Aye, that is your way, to be sure--to take\nthings for granted. But my daughter is not to be taken for granted.\nI have very definite views for my daughter. You have done an unworthy\nthing, Scaramouche. You have betrayed my trust in you. I am very angry\nwith you.\"\n\nHe rolled forward with his ponderous yet curiously noiseless gait.\nScaramouche turned to her, smiling, and handed her the candle.\n\n\"If you will leave us, Climene, I will ask your hand of your father in\nproper form.\"\n\nShe vanished, a little fluttered, lovelier than ever in her mixture\nof confusion and timidity. Scaramouche closed the door and faced the\nenraged M. Binet, who had flung himself into an armchair at the head\nof the short table, faced him with the avowed purpose of asking for\nClimene's hand in proper form. And this was how he did it:\n\n\"Father-in-law,\" said he, \"I congratulate you. This will certainly mean\nthe Comedie Francaise for Climene, and that before long, and you shall\nshine in the glory she will reflect. As the father of Madame Scaramouche\nyou may yet be famous.\"\n\nBinet, his face slowly empurpling, glared at him in speechless\nstupefaction. His rage was the more utter from his humiliating\nconviction that whatever he might say or do, this irresistible fellow\nwould bend him to his will. At last speech came to him.\n\n\"You're a damned corsair,\" he cried, thickly, banging his ham-like fist\nupon the table. \"A corsair! First you sail in and plunder me of half my\nlegitimate gains; and now you want to carry off my daughter. But I'll be\ndamned if I'll give her to a graceless, nameless scoundrel like you, for\nwhom the gallows are waiting already.\"\n\nScaramouche pulled the bell-rope, not at all discomposed. He smiled.\nThere was a flush on his cheeks and a gleam in his eyes. He was very\npleased with the world that night. He really owed a great debt to M. de\nLesdiguieres.\n\n\"Binet,\" said he, \"forget for once that you are Pantaloon, and behave\nas a nice, amiable father-in-law should behave when he has secured a\nson-in-law of exceptionable merits. We are going to have a bottle of\nBurgundy at my expense, and it shall be the best bottle of Burgundy\nto be found in Redon. Compose yourself to do fitting honour to it.\nExcitations of the bile invariably impair the fine sensitiveness of the\npalate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE CONQUEST OF NANTES\n\nThe Binet Troupe opened in Nantes--as you may discover in surviving\ncopies of the \"Courrier Nantais\"--on the Feast of the Purification with\n\"Les Fourberies de Scaramouche.\" But they did not come to Nantes\nas hitherto they had gone to little country villages and townships,\nunheralded and depending entirely upon the parade of their entrance\nto attract attention to themselves. Andre-Louis had borrowed from the\nbusiness methods of the Comedie Francaise. Carrying matters with a high\nhand entirely in his own fashion, he had ordered at Redon the printing\nof playbills, and four days before the company's descent upon Nantes,\nthese bills were pasted outside the Theatre Feydau and elsewhere\nabout the town, and had attracted--being still sufficiently unusual\nannouncements at the time--considerable attention. He had entrusted the\nmatter to one of the company's latest recruits, an intelligent young man\nnamed Basque, sending him on ahead of the company for the purpose.\n\nYou may see for yourself one of these playbills in the Carnavalet\nMuseum. It details the players by their stage names only, with the\nexception of M. Binet and his daughter, and leaving out of account that\nhe who plays Trivelin in one piece appears as Tabarin in another, it\nmakes the company appear to be at least half as numerous again as it\nreally was. It announces that they will open with \"Les Fourberies de\nScaramouche,\" to be followed by five other plays of which it gives the\ntitles, and by others not named, which shall also be added should the\npatronage to be received in the distinguished and enlightened city of\nNantes encourage the Binet Troupe to prolong its sojourn at the Theatre\nFeydau. It lays great stress upon the fact that this is a company of\nimprovisers in the old Italian manner, the like of which has not been\nseen in France for half a century, and it exhorts the public of Nantes\nnot to miss this opportunity of witnessing these distinguished mimes who\nare reviving for them the glories of the Comedie de l'Art. Their visit\nto Nantes--the announcement proceeds--is preliminary to their visit to\nParis, where they intend to throw down the glove to the actors of the\nComedie Francaise, and to show the world how superior is the art of the\nimproviser to that of the actor who depends upon an author for what he\nshall say, and who consequently says always the same thing every time\nthat he plays in the same piece.\n\nIt is an audacious bill, and its audacity had scared M. Binet out of\nthe little sense left him by the Burgundy which in these days he could\nafford to abuse. He had offered the most vehement opposition. Part of\nthis Andre-Louis had swept aside; part he had disregarded.\n\n\"I admit that it is audacious,\" said Scaramouche. \"But at your time of\nlife you should have learnt that in this world nothing succeeds like\naudacity.\"\n\n\"I forbid it; I absolutely forbid it,\" M. Binet insisted.\n\n\"I knew you would. Just as I know that you'll be very grateful to me\npresently for not obeying you.\"\n\n\"You are inviting a catastrophe.\"\n\n\"I am inviting fortune. The worst catastrophe that can overtake you\nis to be back in the market-halls of the country villages from which I\nrescued you. I'll have you in Paris yet in spite of yourself. Leave this\nto me.\"\n\nAnd he went out to attend to the printing. Nor did his preparations\nend there. He wrote a piquant article on the glories of the Comedie de\nl'Art, and its resurrection by the improvising troupe of the great mime\nFlorimond Binet. Binet's name was not Florimond; it was just Pierre.\nBut Andre-Louis had a great sense of the theatre. That article was an\namplification of the stimulating matter contained in the playbills;\nand he persuaded Basque, who had relations in Nantes, to use all the\ninfluence he could command, and all the bribery they could afford, to\nget that article printed in the \"Courrier Nantais\" a couple of days\nbefore the arrival of the Binet Troupe.\n\nBasque had succeeded, and, considering the undoubted literary merits and\nintrinsic interest of the article, this is not at all surprising.\n\nAnd so it was upon an already expectant city that Binet and his company\ndescended in that first week of February. M. Binet would have made his\nentrance in the usual manner--a full-dress parade with banging drums and\ncrashing cymbals. But to this Andre-Louis offered the most relentless\nopposition.\n\n\"We should but discover our poverty,\" said he. \"Instead, we will creep\ninto the city unobserved, and leave ourselves to the imagination of the\npublic.\"\n\nHe had his way, of course. M. Binet, worn already with battling against\nthe strong waters of this young man's will, was altogether unequal to\nthe contest now that he found Climene in alliance with Scaramouche,\nadding her insistence to his, and joining with him in reprobation of her\nfather's sluggish and reactionary wits. Metaphorically, M. Binet threw\nup his arms, and cursing the day on which he had taken this young man\ninto his troupe, he allowed the current to carry him whither it would.\nHe was persuaded that he would be drowned in the end. Meanwhile he\nwould drown his vexation in Burgundy. At least there was abundance of\nBurgundy. Never in his life had he found Burgundy so plentiful. Perhaps\nthings were not as bad as he imagined, after all. He reflected that,\nwhen all was said, he had to thank Scaramouche for the Burgundy. Whilst\nfearing the worst, he would hope for the best.\n\nAnd it was very much the worst that he feared as he waited in the wings\nwhen the curtain rose on that first performance of theirs at the Theatre\nFeydau to a house that was tolerably filled by a public whose curiosity\nthe preliminary announcements had thoroughly stimulated.\n\nAlthough the scenario of \"Lee Fourberies de Scaramouche\" has not\napparently survived, yet we know from Andre-Louis' \"Confessions\" that it\nis opened by Polichinelle in the character of an arrogant and fiercely\njealous lover shown in the act of beguiling the waiting-maid, Columbine,\nto play the spy upon her mistress, Climene. Beginning with cajolery, but\nfailing in this with the saucy Columbine, who likes cajolers to be at\nleast attractive and to pay a due deference to her own very piquant\ncharms, the fierce humpbacked scoundrel passes on to threats of the\nterrible vengeance he will wreak upon her if she betrays him or neglects\nto obey him implicitly; failing here, likewise, he finally has recourse\nto bribery, and after he has bled himself freely to the very expectant\nColumbine, he succeeds by these means in obtaining her consent to spy\nupon Climene, and to report to him upon her lady's conduct.\n\nThe pair played the scene well together, stimulated, perhaps, by their\nvery nervousness at finding themselves before so imposing an audience.\nPolichinelle was everything that is fierce, contemptuous, and insistent.\nColumbine was the essence of pert indifference under his cajolery,\nsaucily mocking under his threats, and finely sly in extorting the very\nmaximum when it came to accepting a bribe. Laughter rippled through\nthe audience and promised well. But M. Binet, standing trembling in the\nwings, missed the great guffaws of the rustic spectators to whom they\nhad played hitherto, and his fears steadily mounted.\n\nThen, scarcely has Polichinelle departed by the door than Scaramouche\nbounds in through the window. It was an effective entrance, usually\nperformed with a broad comic effect that set the people in a roar. Not\nso on this occasion. Meditating in bed that morning, Scaramouche had\ndecided to present himself in a totally different aspect. He would cut\nout all the broad play, all the usual clowning which had delighted\ntheir past rude audiences, and he would obtain his effects by subtlety\ninstead. He would present a slyly humorous rogue, restrained, and of a\ncertain dignity, wearing a countenance of complete solemnity, speaking\nhis lines drily, as if unconscious of the humour with which he intended\nto invest them. Thus, though it might take the audience longer to\nunderstand and discover him, they would like him all the better in the\nend.\n\nTrue to that resolve, he now played his part as the friend and hired\nally of the lovesick Leandre, on whose behalf he came for news of\nClimene, seizing the opportunity to further his own amour with Columbine\nand his designs upon the money-bags of Pantaloon. Also he had taken\ncertain liberties with the traditional costume of Scaramouche; he had\ncaused the black doublet and breeches to be slashed with red, and the\ndoublet to be cut more to a peak, a la Henri III. The conventional black\nvelvet cap he had replaced by a conical hat with a turned-up brim, and a\ntuft of feathers on the left, and he had discarded the guitar.\n\nM. Binet listened desperately for the roar of laughter that usually\ngreeted the entrance of Scaramouche, and his dismay increased when\nit did not come. And then he became conscious of something alarmingly\nunusual in Scaramouche's manner. The sibilant foreign accent was there,\nbut none of the broad boisterousness their audiences had loved.\n\nHe wrung his hands in despair. \"It is all over!\" he said. \"The fellow\nhas ruined us! It serves me right for being a fool, and allowing him to\ntake control of everything!\"\n\nBut he was profoundly mistaken. He began to have an inkling of this when\npresently himself he took the stage, and found the public attentive,\nremarked a grin of quiet appreciation on every upturned face. It was\nnot, however, until the thunders of applause greeted the fall of the\ncurtain on the first act that he felt quite sure they would be allowed\nto escape with their lives.\n\nHad the part of Pantaloon in \"Les Fourberies\" been other than that of\na blundering, timid old idiot, Binet would have ruined it by his\napprehensions. As it was, those very apprehensions, magnifying as they\ndid the hesitancy and bewilderment that were the essence of his part,\ncontributed to the success. And a success it proved that more than\njustified all the heralding of which Scaramouche had been guilty.\n\nFor Scaramouche himself this success was not confined to the public. At\nthe end of the play a great reception awaited him from his companions\nassembled in the green-room of the theatre. His talent, resource, and\nenergy had raised them in a few weeks from a pack of vagrant mountebanks\nto a self-respecting company of first-rate players. They acknowledged it\ngenerously in a speech entrusted to Polichinelle, adding the tribute to\nhis genius that, as they had conquered Nantes, so would they conquer the\nworld under his guidance.\n\nIn their enthusiasm they were a little neglectful of the feelings of\nM. Binet. Irritated enough had he been already by the overriding of\nhis every wish, by the consciousness of his weakness when opposed\nto Scaramouche. And, although he had suffered the gradual process of\nusurpation of authority because its every step had been attended by\nhis own greater profit, deep down in him the resentment abode to stifle\nevery spark of that gratitude due from him to his partner. To-night\nhis nerves had been on the rack, and he had suffered agonies of\napprehension, for all of which he blamed Scaramouche so bitterly that\nnot even the ultimate success--almost miraculous when all the elements\nare considered--could justify his partner in his eyes.\n\nAnd now, to find himself, in addition, ignored by this company--his own\ncompany, which he had so laboriously and slowly assembled and selected\namong the men of ability whom he had found here and there in the\ndregs of cities--was something that stirred his bile, and aroused the\nmalevolence that never did more than slumber in him. But deeply though\nhis rage was moved, it did not blind him to the folly of betraying it.\nYet that he should assert himself in this hour was imperative unless he\nwere for ever to become a thing of no account in this troupe over which\nhe had lorded it for long months before this interloper came amongst\nthem to fill his purse and destroy his authority.\n\nSo he stepped forward now when Polichinelle had done. His make-up\nassisting him to mask his bitter feelings, he professed to add his own\nto Polichinelle's acclamations of his dear partner. But he did it in\nsuch a manner as to make it clear that what Scaramouche had done, he\nhad done by M. Binet's favour, and that in all M. Binet's had been the\nguiding hand. In associating himself with Polichinelle, he desired to\nthank Scaramouche, much in the manner of a lord rendering thanks to his\nsteward for services diligently rendered and orders scrupulously carried\nout.\n\nIt neither deceived the troupe nor mollified himself. Indeed, his\nconsciousness of the mockery of it but increased his bitterness. But at\nleast it saved his face and rescued him from nullity--he who was their\nchief.\n\nTo say, as I have said, that it did not deceive them, is perhaps to say\ntoo much, for it deceived them at least on the score of his feelings.\nThey believed, after discounting the insinuations in which he took all\ncredit to himself, that at heart he was filled with gratitude, as they\nwere. That belief was shared by Andre-Louis himself, who in his brief,\ngrateful answer was very generous to M. Binet, more than endorsing the\nclaims that M. Binet had made.\n\nAnd then followed from him the announcement that their success in Nantes\nwas the sweeter to him because it rendered almost immediately attainable\nthe dearest wish of his heart, which was to make Climene his wife.\nIt was a felicity of which he was the first to acknowledge his utter\nunworthiness. It was to bring him into still closer relations with\nhis good friend M. Binet, to whom he owed all that he had achieved for\nhimself and for them. The announcement was joyously received, for the\nworld of the theatre loves a lover as dearly as does the greater world.\nSo they acclaimed the happy pair, with the exception of poor Leandre,\nwhose eyes were more melancholy than ever.\n\nThey were a happy family that night in the upstairs room of their inn on\nthe Quai La Fosse--the same inn from which Andre-Louis had set out some\nweeks ago to play a vastly different role before an audience of Nantes.\nYet was it so different, he wondered? Had he not then been a sort of\nScaramouche--an intriguer, glib and specious, deceiving folk, cynically\nmisleading them with opinions that were not really his own? Was it at\nall surprising that he should have made so rapid and signal a success\nas a mime? Was not this really all that he had ever been, the thing for\nwhich Nature had designed him?\n\nOn the following night they played \"The Shy Lover\" to a full house, the\nfame of their debut having gone abroad, and the success of Monday was\nconfirmed. On Wednesday they gave \"Figaro-Scaramouche,\" and on Thursday\nmorning the \"Courrier Nantais\" came out with an article of more than\na column of praise of these brilliant improvisers, for whom it claimed\nthat they utterly put to shame the mere reciters of memorized parts.\n\nAndre-Louis, reading the sheet at breakfast, and having no delusions\non the score of the falseness of that statement, laughed inwardly. The\nnovelty of the thing, and the pretentiousness in which he had swaddled\nit, had deceived them finely. He turned to greet Binet and Climene, who\nentered at that moment. He waved the sheet above his head.\n\n\"It is settled,\" he announced, \"we stay in Nantes until Easter.\"\n\n\"Do we?\" said Binet, sourly. \"You settle everything, my friend.\"\n\n\"Read for yourself.\" And he handed him the paper.\n\nMoodily M. Binet read. He set the sheet down in silence, and turned his\nattention to his breakfast.\n\n\"Was I justified or not?\" quoth Andre-Louis, who found M. Binet's\nbehaviour a thought intriguing.\n\n\"In what?\"\n\n\"In coming to Nantes?\"\n\n\"If I had not thought so, we should not have come,\" said Binet, and he\nbegan to eat.\n\nAndre-Louis dropped the subject, wondering.\n\nAfter breakfast he and Climene sallied forth to take the air upon the\nquays. It was a day of brilliant sunshine and less cold than it had\nlately been. Columbine tactlessly joined them as they were setting out,\nthough in this respect matters were improved a little when Harlequin\ncame running after them, and attached himself to Columbine.\n\nAndre-Louis, stepping out ahead with Climene, spoke of the thing that\nwas uppermost in his mind at the moment.\n\n\"Your father is behaving very oddly towards me,\" said he. \"It is almost\nas if he had suddenly become hostile.\"\n\n\"You imagine it,\" said she. \"My father is very grateful to you, as we\nall are.\"\n\n\"He is anything but grateful. He is infuriated against me; and I think I\nknow the reason. Don't you? Can't you guess?\"\n\n\"I can't, indeed.\"\n\n\"If you were my daughter, Climene, which God be thanked you are not, I\nshould feel aggrieved against the man who carried you away from me. Poor\nold Pantaloon! He called me a corsair when I told him that I intend to\nmarry you.\"\n\n\"He was right. You are a bold robber, Scaramouche.\"\n\n\"It is in the character,\" said he. \"Your father believes in having\nhis mimes play upon the stage the parts that suit their natural\ntemperaments.\"\n\n\"Yes, you take everything you want, don't you?\" She looked up at him,\nhalf adoringly, half shyly.\n\n\"If it is possible,\" said he. \"I took his consent to our marriage by\nmain force from him. I never waited for him to give it. When, in fact,\nhe refused it, I just snatched it from him, and I'll defy him now to win\nit back from me. I think that is what he most resents.\"\n\nShe laughed, and launched upon an animated answer. But he did not hear\na word of it. Through the bustle of traffic on the quay a cabriolet, the\nupper half of which was almost entirely made of glass, had approached\nthem. It was drawn by two magnificent bay horses and driven by a\nsuperbly livened coachman.\n\nIn the cabriolet alone sat a slight young girl wrapped in a lynx-fur\npelisse, her face of a delicate loveliness. She was leaning forward, her\nlips parted, her eyes devouring Scaramouche until they drew his gaze.\nWhen that happened, the shock of it brought him abruptly to a dumfounded\nhalt.\n\nClimene, checking in the middle of a sentence, arrested by his own\nsudden stopping, plucked at his sleeve.\n\n\"What is it, Scaramouche?\"\n\nBut he made no attempt to answer her, and at that moment the coachman,\nto whom the little lady had already signalled, brought the carriage to a\nstandstill beside them. Seen in the gorgeous setting of that coach with\nits escutcheoned panels, its portly coachman and its white-stockinged\nfootman--who swung instantly to earth as the vehicle stopped--its dainty\noccupant seemed to Climene a princess out of a fairy-tale. And this\nprincess leaned forward, with eyes aglow and cheeks aflush, stretching\nout a choicely gloved hand to Scaramouche.\n\n\"Andre-Louis!\" she called him.\n\nAnd Scaramouche took the hand of that exalted being, just as he might\nhave taken the hand of Climene herself, and with eyes that reflected the\ngladness of her own, in a voice that echoed the joyous surprise of hers,\nhe addressed her familiarly by name, just as she had addressed him.\n\n\"Aline!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE DREAM\n\n\"The door,\" Aline commanded her footman, and \"Mount here beside me,\" she\ncommanded Andre-Louis, in the same breath.\n\n\"A moment, Aline.\"\n\nHe turned to his companion, who was all amazement, and to Harlequin\nand Columbine, who had that moment come up to share it. \"You permit\nme, Climene?\" said he, breathlessly. But it was more a statement than\na question. \"Fortunately you are not alone. Harlequin will take care of\nyou. Au revoir, at dinner.\"\n\nWith that he sprang into the cabriolet without waiting for a reply. The\nfootman closed the door, the coachman cracked his whip, and the regal\nequipage rolled away along the quay, leaving the three comedians staring\nafter it, open-mouthed... Then Harlequin laughed.\n\n\"A prince in disguise, our Scaramouche!\" said he.\n\nColumbine clapped her hands and flashed her strong teeth. \"But what a\nromance for you, Climene! How wonderful!\"\n\nThe frown melted from Climene's brow. Resentment changed to\nbewilderment.\n\n\"But who is she?\"\n\n\"His sister, of course,\" said Harlequin, quite definitely.\n\n\"His sister? How do you know?\"\n\n\"I know what he will tell you on his return.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Because you wouldn't believe him if he said she was his mother.\"\n\nFollowing the carriage with their glance, they wandered on in the\ndirection it had taken. And in the carriage Aline was considering\nAndre-Louis with grave eyes, lips slightly compressed, and a tiny frown\nbetween her finely drawn eyebrows.\n\n\"You have taken to queer company, Andre,\" was the first thing she said\nto him. \"Or else I am mistaken in thinking that your companion was Mlle.\nBinet of the Theatre Feydau.\"\n\n\"You are not mistaken. But I had not imagined Mlle. Binet so famous\nalready.\"\n\n\"Oh, as to that...\" mademoiselle shrugged, her tone quietly scornful.\nAnd she explained. \"It is simply that I was at the play last night. I\nthought I recognized her.\"\n\n\"You were at the Feydau last night? And I never saw you!\"\n\n\"Were you there, too?\"\n\n\"Was I there!\" he cried. Then he checked, and abruptly changed his tone.\n\"Oh, yes, I was there,\" he said, as commonplace as he could, beset by a\nsudden reluctance to avow that he had so willingly descended to depths\nthat she must account unworthy, and grateful that his disguise of face\nand voice should have proved impenetrable even to one who knew him so\nvery well.\n\n\"I understand,\" said she, and compressed her lips a little more tightly.\n\n\"But what do you understand?\"\n\n\"The rare attractions of Mlle. Binet. Naturally you would be at the\ntheatre. Your tone conveyed it very clearly. Do you know that you\ndisappoint me, Andre? It is stupid of me, perhaps; it betrays, I\nsuppose, my imperfect knowledge of your sex. I am aware that most young\nmen of fashion find an irresistible attraction for creatures who parade\nthemselves upon the stage. But I did not expect you to ape the ways of\na man of fashion. I was foolish enough to imagine you to be different;\nrather above such trivial pursuits. I conceived you something of an\nidealist.\"\n\n\"Sheer flattery.\"\n\n\"So I perceive. But you misled me. You talked so much morality of a\nkind, you made philosophy so readily, that I came to be deceived. In\nfact, your hypocrisy was so consummate that I never suspected it. With\nyour gift of acting I wonder that you haven't joined Mlle. Binet's\ntroupe.\"\n\n\"I have,\" said he.\n\nIt had really become necessary to tell her, making choice of the lesser\nof the two evils with which she confronted him.\n\nHe saw first incredulity, then consternation, and lastly disgust\noverspread her face.\n\n\"Of course,\" said she, after a long pause, \"that would have the\nadvantage of bringing you closer to your charmer.\"\n\n\"That was only one of the inducements. There was another. Finding myself\nforced to choose between the stage and the gallows, I had the incredible\nweakness to prefer the former. It was utterly unworthy of a man of my\nlofty ideals, but--what would you? Like other ideologists, I find it\neasier to preach than to practise. Shall I stop the carriage and remove\nthe contamination of my disgusting person? Or shall I tell you how it\nhappened?\"\n\n\"Tell me how it happened first. Then we will decide.\"\n\nHe told her how he met the Binet Troupe, and how the men of the\nmarechaussee forced upon him the discovery that in its bosom he could\nlie safely lost until the hue and cry had died down. The explanation\ndissolved her iciness.\n\n\"My poor Andre, why didn't you tell me this at first?\"\n\n\"For one thing, you didn't give me time; for another, I feared to shock\nyou with the spectacle of my degradation.\"\n\nShe took him seriously. \"But where was the need of it? And why did you\nnot send us word as I required you of your whereabouts?\"\n\n\"I was thinking of it only yesterday. I have hesitated for several\nreasons.\"\n\n\"You thought it would offend us to know what you were doing?\"\n\n\"I think that I preferred to surprise you by the magnitude of my\nultimate achievements.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are to become a great actor?\" She was frankly scornful.\n\n\"That is not impossible. But I am more concerned to become a great\nauthor. There is no reason why you should sniff. The calling is an\nhonourable one. All the world is proud to know such men as Beaumarchais\nand Chenier.\"\n\n\"And you hope to equal them?\"\n\n\"I hope to surpass them, whilst acknowledging that it was they who\ntaught me how to walk. What did you think of the play last night?\"\n\n\"It was amusing and well conceived.\"\n\n\"Let me present you to the author.\"\n\n\"You? But the company is one of the improvisers.\"\n\n\"Even improvisers require an author to write their scenarios. That is\nall I write at present. Soon I shall be writing plays in the modern\nmanner.\"\n\n\"You deceive yourself, my poor Andre. The piece last night would\nhave been nothing without the players. You are fortunate in your\nScaramouche.\"\n\n\"In confidence--I present you to him.\"\n\n\"You--Scaramouche? You?\" She turned to regard him fully. He smiled his\nclose-lipped smile that made wrinkles like gashes in his cheeks. He\nnodded. \"And I didn't recognize you!\"\n\n\"I thank you for the tribute. You imagined, of course, that I was a\nscene-shifter. And now that you know all about me, what of Gavrillac?\nWhat of my godfather?\"\n\nHe was well, she told him, and still profoundly indignant with\nAndre-Louis for his defection, whilst secretly concerned on his behalf.\n\n\"I shall write to him to-day that I have seen you.\"\n\n\"Do so. Tell him that I am well and prospering. But say no more. Do not\ntell him what I am doing. He has his prejudices too. Besides, it might\nnot be prudent. And now the question I have been burning to ask ever\nsince I entered your carriage. Why are you in Nantes, Aline?\"\n\n\"I am on a visit to my aunt, Mme. de Sautron. It was with her that I\ncame to the play yesterday. We have been dull at the chateau; but\nit will be different now. Madame my aunt is receiving several guests\nto-day. M. de La Tour d'Azyr is to be one of them.\"\n\nAndre-Louis frowned and sighed. \"Did you ever hear, Aline, how poor\nPhilippe de Vilmorin came by his end?\"\n\n\"Yes; I was told, first by my uncle; then by M. de La Tour d'Azyr,\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Did not that help you to decide this marriage question?\"\n\n\"How could it? You forget that I am but a woman. You don't expect me to\njudge between men in matters such as these?\"\n\n\"Why not? You are well able to do so. The more since you have heard two\nsides. For my godfather would tell you the truth. If you cannot judge,\nit is that you do not wish to judge.\" His tone became harsh. \"Wilfully\nyou close your eyes to justice that might check the course of your\nunhealthy, unnatural ambition.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" she exclaimed, and considered him with amusement and\nsomething else. \"Do you know that you are almost droll? You rise\nunblushing from the dregs of life in which I find you, and shake off the\narm of that theatre girl, to come and preach to me.\"\n\n\"If these were the dregs of life I might still speak from them to\ncounsel you out of my respect and devotion, Aline.\" He was very, stiff\nand stern. \"But they are not the dregs of life. Honour and virtue are\npossible to a theatre girl; they are impossible to a lady who sells\nherself to gratify ambition; who for position, riches, and a great title\nbarters herself in marriage.\"\n\nShe looked at him breathlessly. Anger turned her pale. She reached for\nthe cord.\n\n\"I think I had better let you alight so that you may go back to practise\nvirtue and honour with your theatre wench.\"\n\n\"You shall not speak so of her, Aline.\"\n\n\"Faith, now we are to have heat on her behalf. You think I am too\ndelicate? You think I should speak of her as a...\"\n\n\"If you must speak of her at all,\" he interrupted, hotly, \"you'll speak\nof her as my wife.\"\n\nAmazement smothered her anger. Her pallor deepened. \"My God!\" she said,\nand looked at him in horror. And in horror she asked him presently: \"You\nare married--married to that--?\"\n\n\"Not yet. But I shall be, soon. And let me tell you that this girl whom\nyou visit with your ignorant contempt is as good and pure as you are,\nAline. She has wit and talent which have placed her where she is and\nshall carry her a deal farther. And she has the womanliness to be guided\nby natural instincts in the selection of her mate.\"\n\nShe was trembling with passion. She tugged the cord.\n\n\"You will descend this instant!\" she told him fiercely. \"That you should\ndare to make a comparison between me and that...\"\n\n\"And my wife-to-be,\" he interrupted, before she could speak the infamous\nword. He opened the door for himself without waiting for the footman,\nand leapt down. \"My compliments,\" said he, furiously, \"to the assassin\nyou are to marry.\" He slammed the door. \"Drive on,\" he bade the\ncoachman.\n\nThe carriage rolled away up the Faubourg Gigan, leaving him standing\nwhere he had alighted, quivering with rage. Gradually, as he walked back\nto the inn, his anger cooled. Gradually, as he cooled, he perceived her\npoint of view, and in the end forgave her. It was not her fault that she\nthought as she thought. Her rearing had been such as to make her look\nupon every actress as a trull, just as it had qualified her calmly\nto consider the monstrous marriage of convenience into which she was\ninvited.\n\nHe got back to the inn to find the company at table. Silence fell when\nhe entered, so suddenly that of necessity it must be supposed he was\nhimself the subject of the conversation. Harlequin and Columbine had\nspread the tale of this prince in disguise caught up into the chariot\nof a princess and carried off by her; and it was a tale that had lost\nnothing in the telling.\n\nClimene had been silent and thoughtful, pondering what Columbine had\ncalled this romance of hers. Clearly her Scaramouche must be vastly\nother than he had hitherto appeared, or else that great lady and he\nwould never have used such familiarity with each other. Imagining him\nno better than he was, Climene had made him her own. And now she was to\nreceive the reward of disinterested affection.\n\nEven old Binet's secret hostility towards Andre-Louis melted before\nthis astounding revelation. He had pinched his daughter's ear quite\nplayfully. \"Ah, ah, trust you to have penetrated his disguise, my\nchild!\"\n\nShe shrank resentfully from that implication.\n\n\"But I did not. I took him for what he seemed.\"\n\nHer father winked at her very solemnly and laughed. \"To be sure, you\ndid. But like your father, who was once a gentleman, and knows the ways\nof gentlemen, you detected in him a subtle something different from\nthose with whom misfortune has compelled you hitherto to herd. You knew\nas well as I did that he never caught that trick of haughtiness, that\ngrand air of command, in a lawyer's musty office, and that his speech\nhad hardly the ring or his thoughts the complexion of the bourgeois that\nhe pretended to be. And it was shrewd of you to have made him yours. Do\nyou know that I shall be very proud of you yet, Climene?\"\n\nShe moved away without answering. Her father's oiliness offended her.\nScaramouche was clearly a great gentleman, an eccentric if you please,\nbut a man born. And she was to be his lady. Her father must learn to\ntreat her differently.\n\nShe looked shyly--with a new shyness--at her lover when he came into the\nroom where they were dining. She observed for the first time that proud\ncarriage of the head, with the chin thrust forward, that was a trick of\nhis, and she noticed with what a grace he moved--the grace of one who in\nyouth has had his dancing-masters and fencing-masters.\n\nIt almost hurt her when he flung himself into a chair and exchanged\na quip with Harlequin in the usual manner as with an equal, and it\noffended her still more that Harlequin, knowing what he now knew, should\nuse him with the same unbecoming familiarity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE AWAKENING\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Climene, \"that I am waiting for the explanation\nwhich I think you owe me?\"\n\nThey were alone together, lingering still at the table to which\nAndre-Louis had come belatedly, and Andre-Louis was loading himself a\npipe. Of late--since joining the Binet Troupe--he had acquired the habit\nof smoking. The others had gone, some to take the air and others, like\nBinet and Madame, because they felt that it were discreet to leave\nthose two to the explanations that must pass. It was a feeling that\nAndre-Louis did not share. He kindled a light and leisurely applied it\nto his pipe. A frown came to settle on his brow.\n\n\"Explanation?\" he questioned presently, and looked at her. \"But on what\nscore?\"\n\n\"On the score of the deception you have practised on us--on me.\"\n\n\"I have practised none,\" he assured her.\n\n\"You mean that you have simply kept your own counsel, and that in\nsilence there is no deception. But it is deceitful to withhold facts\nconcerning yourself and your true station from your future wife. You\nshould not have pretended to be a simple country lawyer, which, of\ncourse, any one could see that you are not. It may have been very\nromantic, but... Enfin, will you explain?\"\n\n\"I see,\" he said, and pulled at his pipe. \"But you are wrong, Climene.\nI have practised no deception. If there are things about me that I have\nnot told you, it is that I did not account them of much importance.\nBut I have never deceived you by pretending to be other than I am. I am\nneither more nor less than I have represented myself.\"\n\nThis persistence began to annoy her, and the annoyance showed on her\nwinsome face, coloured her voice.\n\n\"Ha! And that fine lady of the nobility with whom you are so intimate,\nwho carried you off in her cabriolet with so little ceremony towards\nmyself? What is she to you?\"\n\n\"A sort of sister,\" said he.\n\n\"A sort of sister!\" She was indignant. \"Harlequin foretold that you\nwould say so; but he was amusing himself. It was not very funny. It\nis less funny still from you. She has a name, I suppose, this sort of\nsister?\"\n\n\"Certainly she has a name. She is Mlle. Aline de Kercadiou, the niece of\nQuintin de Kercadiou, Lord of Gavrillac.\"\n\n\"Oho! That's a sufficiently fine name for your sort of sister. What sort\nof sister, my friend?\"\n\nFor the first time in their relationship he observed and deplored the\ntaint of vulgarity, of shrewishness, in her manner.\n\n\"It would have been more accurate in me to have said a sort of reputed\nleft-handed cousin.\"\n\n\"A reputed left-handed cousin! And what sort of relationship may that\nbe? Faith, you dazzle me with your lucidity.\"\n\n\"It requires to be explained.\"\n\n\"That is what I have been telling you. But you seem very reluctant with\nyour explanations.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. It is only that they are so unimportant. But be you the judge.\nHer uncle, M. de Kercadiou, is my godfather, and she and I have been\nplaymates from infancy as a consequence. It is popularly believed in\nGavrillac that M. de Kercadiou is my father. He has certainly cared for\nmy rearing from my tenderest years, and it is entirely owing to him\nthat I was educated at Louis le Grand. I owe to him everything that I\nhave--or, rather, everything that I had; for of my own free will I have\ncut myself adrift, and to-day I possess nothing save what I can earn for\nmyself in the theatre or elsewhere.\"\n\nShe sat stunned and pale under that cruel blow to her swelling pride.\nHad he told her this but yesterday, it would have made no impression\nupon her, it would have mattered not at all; the event of to-day coming\nas a sequel would but have enhanced him in her eyes. But coming now,\nafter her imagination had woven for him so magnificent a background,\nafter the rashly assumed discovery of his splendid identity had made\nher the envied of all the company, after having been in her own eyes and\ntheirs enshrined by marriage with him as a great lady, this disclosure\ncrushed and humiliated her. Her prince in disguise was merely the\noutcast bastard of a country gentleman! She would be the laughing-stock\nof every member of her father's troupe, of all those who had so lately\nenvied her this romantic good fortune.\n\n\"You should have told me this before,\" she said, in a dull voice that\nshe strove to render steady.\n\n\"Perhaps I should. But does it really matter?\"\n\n\"Matter?\" She suppressed her fury to ask another question. \"You say\nthat this M. de Kercadiou is popularly believed to be your father. What\nprecisely do you mean?\"\n\n\"Just that. It is a belief that I do not share. It is a matter of\ninstinct, perhaps, with me. Moreover, once I asked M. de Kercadiou\npoint-blank, and I received from him a denial. It is not, perhaps,\na denial to which one would attach too much importance in all the\ncircumstances. Yet I have never known M de Kercadiou for other than\na man of strictest honour, and I should hesitate to disbelieve\nhim--particularly when his statement leaps with my own instincts. He\nassured me that he did not know who my father was.\"\n\n\"And your mother, was she equally ignorant?\" She was sneering, but he\ndid not remark it. Her back was to the light.\n\n\"He would not disclose her name to me. He confessed her to be a dear\nfriend of his.\"\n\nShe startled him by laughing, and her laugh was not pleasant.\n\n\"A very dear friend, you may be sure, you simpleton. What name do you\nbear?\"\n\nHe restrained his own rising indignation to answer her question calmly:\n\"Moreau. It was given me, so I am told, from the Brittany village in\nwhich I was born. But I have no claim to it. In fact I have no name,\nunless it be Scaramouche, to which I have earned a title. So that you\nsee, my dear,\" he ended with a smile, \"I have practised no deception\nwhatever.\"\n\n\"No, no. I see that now.\" She laughed without mirth, then drew a deep\nbreath and rose. \"I am very tired,\" she said.\n\nHe was on his feet in an instant, all solicitude. But she waved him\nwearily back.\n\n\"I think I will rest until it is time to go to the theatre.\" She moved\ntowards the door, dragging her feet a little. He sprang to open it, and\nshe passed out without looking at him.\n\nHer so brief romantic dream was ended. The glorious world of fancy which\nin the last hour she had built with such elaborate detail, over which it\nshould be her exalted destiny to rule, lay shattered about her feet, its\ndebris so many stumbling-blocks that prevented her from winning back to\nher erstwhile content in Scaramouche as he really was.\n\nAndre-Louis sat in the window embrasure, smoking and looking idly out\nacross the river. He was intrigued and meditative. He had shocked her.\nThe fact was clear; not so the reason. That he should confess himself\nnameless should not particularly injure him in the eyes of a girl\nreared amid the surroundings that had been Climene's. And yet that his\nconfession had so injured him was fully apparent.\n\nThere, still at his brooding, the returning Columbine discovered him a\nhalf-hour later.\n\n\"All alone, my prince!\" was her laughing greeting, which suddenly threw\nlight upon his mental darkness. Climene had been disappointed of hopes\nthat the wild imagination of these players had suddenly erected upon the\nincident of his meeting with Aline. Poor child! He smiled whimsically at\nColumbine.\n\n\"I am likely to be so for some little time,\" said he, \"until it becomes\na commonplace that I am not, after all, a prince.\n\n\"Not a prince? Oh, but a duke, then--at least a marquis.\"\n\n\"Not even a chevalier, unless it be of the order of fortune. I am just\nScaramouche. My castles are all in Spain.\"\n\nDisappointment clouded the lively, good-natured face.\n\n\"And I had imagined you...\"\n\n\"I know,\" he interrupted. \"That is the mischief.\" He might have gauged\nthe extent of that mischief by Climene's conduct that evening towards\nthe gentlemen of fashion who clustered now in the green-room between the\nacts to pay their homage to the incomparable amoureuse. Hitherto she had\nreceived them with a circumspection compelling respect. To-night she was\nrecklessly gay, impudent, almost wanton.\n\nHe spoke of it gently to her as they walked home together, counselling\nmore prudence in the future.\n\n\"We are not married yet,\" she told him, tartly. \"Wait until then before\nyou criticize my conduct.\"\n\n\"I trust that there will be no occasion then,\" said he.\n\n\"You trust? Ah, yes. You are very trusting.\"\n\n\"Climene, I have offended you. I am sorry.\"\n\n\"It is nothing,\" said she. \"You are what you are.\" Still was he not\nconcerned. He perceived the source of her ill-humour; understood, whilst\ndeploring it; and, because he understood, forgave. He perceived also\nthat her ill-humour was shared by her father, and by this he was frankly\namused. Towards M. Binet a tolerant contempt was the only feeling that\ncomplete acquaintance could beget. As for the rest of the company, they\nwere disposed to be very kindly towards Scaramouche. It was almost as\nif in reality he had fallen from the high estate to which their own\nimaginations had raised him; or possibly it was because they saw the\neffect which that fall from his temporary and fictitious elevation had\nproduced upon Climene.\n\nLeandre alone made himself an exception. His habitual melancholy\nseemed to be dispelled at last, and his eyes gleamed now with malicious\nsatisfaction when they rested upon Scaramouche, whom occasionally he\ncontinued to address with sly mockery as \"mon prince.\"\n\nOn the morrow Andre-Louis saw but little of Climene. This was not\nin itself extraordinary, for he was very hard at work again, with\npreparations now for \"Figaro-Scaramouche\" which was to be played on\nSaturday. Also, in addition to his manifold theatrical occupations, he\nnow devoted an hour every morning to the study of fencing in an academy\nof arms. This was done not only to repair an omission in his education,\nbut also, and chiefly, to give him added grace and poise upon the stage.\nHe found his mind that morning distracted by thoughts of both Climene\nand Aline. And oddly enough it was Aline who provided the deeper\nperturbation. Climene's attitude he regarded as a passing phase which\nneed not seriously engage him. But the thought of Aline's conduct\ntowards him kept rankling, and still more deeply rankled the thought of\nher possible betrothal to M. de La Tour d'Azyr.\n\nThis it was that brought forcibly to his mind the self-imposed but by\nnow half-forgotten mission that he had made his own. He had boasted that\nhe would make the voice which M. de La Tour d'Azyr had sought to silence\nring through the length and breadth of the land. And what had he done of\nall this that he had boasted? He had incited the mob of Rennes and the\nmob of Nantes in such terms as poor Philippe might have employed, and\nthen because of a hue and cry he had fled like a cur and taken shelter\nin the first kennel that offered, there to lie quiet and devote himself\nto other things--self-seeking things. What a fine contrast between the\npromise and the fulfilment!\n\nThus Andre-Louis to himself in his self-contempt. And whilst he trifled\naway his time and played Scaramouche, and centred all his hopes in\npresently becoming the rival of such men as Chenier and Mercier, M. de\nLa Tour d'Azyr went his proud ways unchallenged and wrought his will.\nIt was idle to tell himself that the seed he had sown was bearing fruit.\nThat the demands he had voiced in Nantes for the Third Estate had\nbeen granted by M. Necker, thanks largely to the commotion which his\nanonymous speech had made. That was not his concern or his mission. It\nwas no part of his concern to set about the regeneration of mankind, or\neven the regeneration of the social structure of France. His concern\nwas to see that M. de La Tour d'Azyr paid to the uttermost liard for the\nbrutal wrong he had done Philippe de Vilmorin. And it did not increase\nhis self-respect to find that the danger in which Aline stood of\nbeing married to the Marquis was the real spur to his rancour and to\nremembrance of his vow. He was--too unjustly, perhaps--disposed to dismiss\nas mere sophistries his own arguments that there was nothing he could\ndo; that, in fact, he had but to show his head to find himself going to\nRennes under arrest and making his final exit from the world's stage by\nway of the gallows.\n\nIt is impossible to read that part of his \"Confessions\" without feeling\na certain pity for him. You realize what must have been his state of\nmind. You realize what a prey he was to emotions so conflicting, and\nif you have the imagination that will enable you to put yourself in his\nplace, you will also realize how impossible was any decision save the\none to which he says he came, that he would move, at the first moment\nthat he perceived in what direction it would serve his real aims to\nmove.\n\nIt happened that the first person he saw when he took the stage on\nthat Thursday evening was Aline; the second was the Marquis de La Tour\nd'Azyr. They occupied a box on the right of, and immediately above, the\nstage. There were others with them--notably a thin, elderly, resplendent\nlady whom Andre-Louis supposed to be Madame la Comtesse de Sautron. But\nat the time he had no eyes for any but those two, who of late had\nso haunted his thoughts. The sight of either of them would have been\nsufficiently disconcerting. The sight of both together very nearly made\nhim forget the purpose for which he had come upon the stage. Then he\npulled himself together, and played. He played, he says, with an unusual\nnerve, and never in all that brief but eventful career of his was he\nmore applauded.\n\nThat was the evening's first shock. The next came after the second act.\nEntering the green-room he found it more thronged than usual, and at the\nfar end with Climene, over whom he was bending from his fine height, his\neyes intent upon her face, what time his smiling lips moved in talk, M.\nde La Tour d'Azyr. He had her entirely to himself, a privilege none of\nthe men of fashion who were in the habit of visiting the coulisse\nhad yet enjoyed. Those lesser gentlemen had all withdrawn before the\nMarquis, as jackals withdraw before the lion.\n\nAndre-Louis stared a moment, stricken. Then recovering from his surprise\nhe became critical in his study of the Marquis. He considered the\nbeauty and grace and splendour of him, his courtly air, his complete\nand unshakable self-possession. But more than all he considered the\nexpression of the dark eyes that were devouring Climene's lovely face,\nand his own lips tightened.\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr never heeded him or his stare; nor, had he done\nso, would he have known who it was that looked at him from behind the\nmake-up of Scaramouche; nor, again, had he known, would he have been in\nthe least troubled or concerned.\n\nAndre-Louis sat down apart, his mind in turmoil. Presently he found a\nmincing young gentleman addressing him, and made shift to answer as\nwas expected. Climene having been thus sequestered, and Columbine being\nalready thickly besieged by gallants, the lesser visitors had to content\nthemselves with Madame and the male members of the troupe. M. Binet,\nindeed, was the centre of a gay cluster that shook with laughter at his\nsallies. He seemed of a sudden to have emerged from the gloom of the\nlast two days into high good-humour, and Scaramouche observed how\npersistently his eyes kept flickering upon his daughter and her splendid\ncourtier.\n\nThat night there, were high words between Andre-Louis and Climene, the\nhigh words proceeding from Climene. When Andre-Louis again, and more\ninsistently, enjoined prudence upon his betrothed, and begged her to\nbeware how far she encouraged the advances of such a man as M. de La\nTour d'Azyr, she became roundly abusive. She shocked and stunned him\nby her virulently shrewish tone, and her still more unexpected force of\ninvective.\n\nHe sought to reason with her, and finally she came to certain terms with\nhim.\n\n\"If you have become betrothed to me simply to stand as an obstacle in my\npath, the sooner we make an end the better.\"\n\n\"You do not love me then, Climene?\"\n\n\"Love has nothing to do with it. I'll not tolerate your insensate\njealousy. A girl in the theatre must make it her business to accept\nhomage from all.\"\n\n\"Agreed; and there is no harm, provided she gives nothing in exchange.\"\n\nWhite-faced, with flaming eyes she turned on him at that.\n\n\"Now, what exactly do you mean?\"\n\n\"My meaning is clear. A girl in your position may receive all the homage\nthat is offered, provided she receives it with a dignified aloofness\nimplying clearly that she has no favours to bestow in return beyond the\nfavour of her smile. If she is wise she will see to it that the homage\nis always offered collectively by her admirers, and that no single one\namongst them shall ever have the privilege of approaching her alone. If\nshe is wise she will give no encouragement, nourish no hopes that it may\nafterwards be beyond her power to deny realization.\"\n\n\"How? You dare?\"\n\n\"I know my world. And I know M. de La Tour d'Azyr,\" he answered her. \"He\nis a man without charity, without humanity almost; a man who takes what\nhe wants wherever he finds it and whether it is given willingly or\nnot; a man who reckons nothing of the misery he scatters on his\nself-indulgent way; a man whose only law is force. Ponder it, Climene,\nand ask yourself if I do you less than honour in warning you.\"\n\nHe went out on that, feeling a degradation in continuing the subject.\n\nThe days that followed were unhappy days for him, and for at least\none other. That other was Leandre, who was cast into the profoundest\ndejection by M. de La Tour d'Azyr's assiduous attendance upon Climene.\nThe Marquis was to be seen at every performance; a box was perpetually\nreserved for him, and invariably he came either alone or else with his\ncousin M. de Chabrillane.\n\nOn Tuesday of the following week, Andre-Louis went out alone early in\nthe morning. He was out of temper, fretted by an overwhelming sense of\nhumiliation, and he hoped to clear his mind by walking. In turning\nthe corner of the Place du Bouffay he ran into a slightly built,\nsallow-complexioned gentleman very neatly dressed in black, wearing a\ntie-wig under a round hat. The man fell back at sight of him, levelling\na spy-glass, then hailed him in a voice that rang with amazement.\n\n\"Moreau! Where the devil have you been hiding your-self these months?\"\n\nIt was Le Chapelier, the lawyer, the leader of the Literary Chamber of\nRennes.\n\n\"Behind the skirts of Thespis,\" said Scaramouche.\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"I didn't intend that you should. What of yourself, Isaac? And what of\nthe world which seems to have been standing still of late?\"\n\n\"Standing still!\" Le Chapelier laughed. \"But where have you been, then?\nStanding still!\" He pointed across the square to a caf\u00e9 under the shadow\nof the gloomy prison. \"Let us go and drink a bavaroise. You are of\nall men the man we want, the man we have been seeking everywhere,\nand--behold!--you drop from the skies into my path.\"\n\nThey crossed the square and entered the caf\u00e9.\n\n\"So you think the world has been standing still! Dieu de Dieu! I suppose\nyou haven't heard of the royal order for the convocation of the States\nGeneral, or the terms of them--that we are to have what we demanded, what\nyou demanded for us here in Nantes! You haven't heard that the order has\ngone forth for the primary elections--the elections of the electors. You\nhaven't heard of the fresh uproar in Rennes, last month. The order was\nthat the three estates should sit together at the States General of\nthe bailliages, but in the bailliage of Rennes the nobles must ever be\nrecalcitrant. They took up arms actually--six hundred of them with their\nvaletaille, headed by your old friend M. de La Tour d'Azyr, and they\nwere for slashing us--the members of the Third Estate--into ribbons so as\nto put an end to our insolence.\" He laughed delicately. \"But, by God, we\nshowed them that we, too, could take up arms. It was what you yourself\nadvocated here in Nantes, last November. We fought them a pitched\nbattle in the streets, under the leadership of your namesake Moreau, the\nprovost, and we so peppered them that they were glad to take shelter in\nthe Cordelier Convent. That is the end of their resistance to the royal\nauthority and the people's will.\"\n\nHe ran on at great speed detailing the events that had taken place, and\nfinally came to the matter which had, he announced, been causing him to\nhunt for Andre-Louis until he had all but despaired of finding him.\n\nNantes was sending fifty delegates to the assembly of Rennes which was\nto select the deputies to the Third Estate and edit their cahier of\ngrievances. Rennes itself was being as fully represented, whilst such\nvillages as Gavrillac were sending two delegates for every two hundred\nhearths or less. Each of these three had clamoured that Andre-Louis\nMoreau should be one of its delegates. Gavrillac wanted him because he\nbelonged to the village, and it was known there what sacrifices he had\nmade in the popular cause; Rennes wanted him because it had heard\nhis spirited address on the day of the shooting of the students; and\nNantes--to whom his identity was unknown--asked for him as the speaker who\nhad addressed them under the name of Omnes Omnibus and who had framed\nfor them the memorial that was believed so largely to have influenced M.\nNecker in formulating the terms of the convocation.\n\nSince he could not be found, the delegations had been made up without\nhim. But now it happened that one or two vacancies had occurred in\nthe Nantes representation; and it was the business of filling these\nvacancies that had brought Le Chapelier to Nantes.\n\nAndre-Louis firmly shook his head in answer to Le Chapelier's proposal.\n\n\"You refuse?\" the other cried. \"Are you mad? Refuse, when you are\ndemanded from so many sides? Do you realize that it is more than\nprobable you will be elected one of the deputies, that you will be sent\nto the States General at Versailles to represent us in this work of\nsaving France?\"\n\nBut Andre-Louis, we know, was not concerned to save France. At the\nmoment he was concerned to save two women, both of whom he loved, though\nin vastly different ways, from a man he had vowed to ruin. He stood firm\nin his refusal until Le Chapelier dejectedly abandoned the attempt to\npersuade him.\n\n\"It is odd,\" said Andre-Louis, \"that I should have been so deeply\nimmersed in trifles as never to have perceived that Nantes is being\npolitically active.\"\n\n\"Active! My friend, it is a seething cauldron of political emotions. It\nis kept quiet on the surface only by the persuasion that all goes well.\nAt a hint to the contrary it would boil over.\"\n\n\"Would it so?\" said Scaramouche, thoughtfully. \"The knowledge may be\nuseful.\" And then he changed the subject. \"You know that La Tour d'Azyr\nis here?\"\n\n\"In Nantes? He has courage if he shows himself. They are not a docile\npeople, these Nantais, and they know his record and the part he played\nin the rising at Rennes. I marvel they haven't stoned him. But they\nwill, sooner or later. It only needs that some one should suggest it.\"\n\n\"That is very likely,\" said Andre-Louis, and smiled. \"He doesn't show\nhimself much; not in the streets, at least. So that he has not the\ncourage you suppose; nor any kind of courage, as I told him once. He has\nonly insolence.\"\n\nAt parting Le Chapelier again exhorted him to give thought to what he\nproposed. \"Send me word if you change your mind. I am lodged at the\nCerf, and I shall be here until the day after to-morrow. If you have\nambition, this is your moment.\"\n\n\"I have no ambition, I suppose,\" said Andre-Louis, and went his way.\n\nThat night at the theatre he had a mischievous impulse to test what Le\nChapelier had told him of the state of public feeling in the city. They\nwere playing \"The Terrible Captain,\" in the last act of which the empty\ncowardice of the bullying braggart Rhodomont is revealed by Scaramouche.\n\nAfter the laughter which the exposure of the roaring captain invariably\nproduced, it remained for Scaramouche contemptuously to dismiss him in a\nphrase that varied nightly, according to the inspiration of the moment.\nThis time he chose to give his phrase a political complexion:\n\n\"Thus, O thrasonical coward, is your emptiness exposed. Because of your\nlong length and the great sword you carry and the angle at which you\ncock your hat, people have gone in fear of you, have believed in you,\nhave imagined you to be as terrible and as formidable as you insolently\nmake yourself appear. But at the first touch of true spirit you crumple\nup, you tremble, you whine pitifully, and the great sword remains in\nyour scabbard. You remind me of the Privileged Orders when confronted by\nthe Third Estate.\"\n\nIt was audacious of him, and he was prepared for anything--a laugh,\napplause, indignation, or all together. But he was not prepared for what\ncame. And it came so suddenly and spontaneously from the groundlings and\nthe body of those in the amphitheatre that he was almost scared by it--as\na boy may be scared who has held a match to a sun-scorched hayrick. It\nwas a hurricane of furious applause. Men leapt to their feet, sprang up\non to the benches, waving their hats in the air, deafening him with\nthe terrific uproar of their acclamations. And it rolled on and on, nor\nceased until the curtain fell.\n\nScaramouche stood meditatively smiling with tight lips. At the last\nmoment he had caught a glimpse of M. de La Tour d'Azyr's face thrust\nfarther forward than usual from the shadows of his box, and it was a\nface set in anger, with eyes on fire.\n\n\"Mon Dieu!\" laughed Rhodomont, recovering from the real scare that had\nsucceeded his histrionic terror, \"but you have a great trick of tickling\nthem in the right place, Scaramouche.\"\n\nScaramouche looked up at him and smiled. \"It can be useful upon\noccasion,\" said he, and went off to his dressing-room to change.\n\nBut a reprimand awaited him. He was delayed at the theatre by matters\nconcerned with the scenery of the new piece they were to mount upon the\nmorrow. By the time he was rid of the business the rest of the company\nhad long since left. He called a chair and had himself carried back\nto the inn in solitary state. It was one of many minor luxuries his\ncomparatively affluent present circumstances permitted.\n\nComing into that upstairs room that was common to all the troupe, he\nfound M. Binet talking loudly and vehemently. He had caught sounds of\nhis voice whilst yet upon the stairs. As he entered Binet broke off\nshort, and wheeled to face him.\n\n\"You are here at last!\" It was so odd a greeting that Andre-Louis did\nno more than look his mild surprise. \"I await your explanations of the\ndisgraceful scene you provoked to-night.\"\n\n\"Disgraceful? Is it disgraceful that the public should applaud me?\"\n\n\"The public? The rabble, you mean. Do you want to deprive us of the\npatronage of all gentlefolk by vulgar appeals to the low passions of the\nmob?\"\n\nAndre-Louis stepped past M. Binet and forward to the table. He shrugged\ncontemptuously. The man offended him, after all.\n\n\"You exaggerate grossly--as usual.\"\n\n\"I do not exaggerate. And I am the master in my own theatre. This is the\nBinet Troupe, and it shall be conducted in the Binet way.\"\n\n\"Who are the gentlefolk the loss of whose patronage to the Feydau will\nbe so poignantly felt?\" asked Andre-Louis.\n\n\"You imply that there are none? See how wrong you are. After the play\nto-night M. le Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr came to me, and spoke to me\nin the severest terms about your scandalous outburst. I was forced to\napologize, and...\"\n\n\"The more fool you,\" said Andre-Louis. \"A man who respected himself\nwould have shown that gentleman the door.\" M. Binet's face began to\nempurple. \"You call yourself the head of the Binet Troupe, you boast\nthat you will be master in your own theatre, and you stand like a\nlackey to take the orders of the first insolent fellow who comes to your\ngreen-room to tell you that he does not like a line spoken by one of\nyour company! I say again that had you really respected yourself you\nwould have turned him out.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of approval from several members of the company, who,\nhaving heard the arrogant tone assumed by the Marquis, were filled with\nresentment against the slur cast upon them all.\n\n\"And I say further,\" Andre-Louis went on, \"that a man who respects\nhimself, on quite other grounds, would have been only too glad to have\nseized this pretext to show M. de La Tour d'Azyr the door.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" There was a rumble of thunder in the\nquestion.\n\nAndre-Louis' eyes swept round the company assembled at the supper-table.\n\"Where is Climene?\" he asked, sharply.\n\nLeandre leapt up to answer him, white in the face, tense and quivering\nwith excitement.\n\n\"She left the theatre in the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr's carriage\nimmediately after the performance. We heard him offer to drive her to\nthis inn.\"\n\nAndre-Louis glanced at the timepiece on the overmantel. He seemed\nunnaturally calm.\n\n\"That would be an hour ago--rather more. And she has not yet arrived?\"\n\nHis eyes sought M. Binet's. M. Binet's eyes eluded his glance. Again it\nwas Leandre who answered him.\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Andre-Louis sat down, and poured himself wine. There was an\noppressive silence in the room. Leandre watched him expectantly,\nColumbine commiseratingly. Even M. Binet appeared to be waiting for a\ncue from Scaramouche. But Scaramouche disappointed him. \"Have you left\nme anything to eat?\" he asked.\n\nPlatters were pushed towards him. He helped himself calmly to food,\nand ate in silence, apparently with a good appetite. M. Binet sat\ndown, poured himself wine, and drank. Presently he attempted to\nmake conversation with one and another. He was answered curtly, in\nmonosyllables. M. Binet did not appear to be in favour with his troupe\nthat night.\n\nAt long length came a rumble of wheels below and a rattle of halting\nhooves. Then voices, the high, trilling laugh of Climene floating\nupwards. Andre-Louis went on eating unconcernedly.\n\n\"What an actor!\" said Harlequin under his breath to Polichinelle, and\nPolichinelle nodded gloomily.\n\nShe came in, a leading lady taking the stage, head high, chin thrust\nforward, eyes dancing with laughter; she expressed triumph and\narrogance. Her cheeks were flushed, and there was some disorder in\nthe mass of nut-brown hair that crowned her head. In her left hand she\ncarried an enormous bouquet of white camellias. On its middle finger a\ndiamond of great price drew almost at once by its effulgence the eyes of\nall.\n\nHer father sprang to meet her with an unusual display of paternal\ntenderness. \"At last, my child!\"\n\nHe conducted her to the table. She sank into a chair, a little wearily,\na little nervelessly, but the smile did not leave her face, not even\nwhen she glanced across at Scaramouche. It was only Leandre, observing\nher closely, with hungry, scowling stare, who detected something as of\nfear in the hazel eyes momentarily seen between the fluttering of her\nlids.\n\nAndre-Louis, however, still went on eating stolidly, without so much as\na look in her direction. Gradually the company came to realize that\njust as surely as a scene was brooding, just so surely would there be no\nscene as long as they remained. It was Polichinelle, at last, who\ngave the signal by rising and withdrawing, and within two minutes none\nremained in the room but M. Binet, his daughter, and Andre-Louis. And\nthen, at last, Andre-Louis set down knife and fork, washed his throat\nwith a draught of Burgundy, and sat back in his chair to consider\nClimene.\n\n\"I trust,\" said he, \"that you had a pleasant ride, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Most pleasant, monsieur.\" Impudently she strove to emulate his\ncoolness, but did not completely succeed.\n\n\"And not unprofitable, if I may judge that jewel at this distance.\nIt should be worth at least a couple of hundred louis, and that is a\nformidable sum even to so wealthy a nobleman as M. de La Tour d'Azyr.\nWould it be impertinent in one who has had some notion of becoming your\nhusband, to ask you, mademoiselle, what you have given him in return?\"\n\nM. Binet uttered a gross laugh, a queer mixture of cynicism and\ncontempt.\n\n\"I have given nothing,\" said Climene, indignantly.\n\n\"Ah! Then the jewel is in the nature of a payment in advance.\"\n\n\"My God, man, you're not decent!\" M. Binet protested.\n\n\"Decent?\" Andre-Louis' smouldering eyes turned to discharge upon M.\nBinet such a fulmination of contempt that the old scoundrel shifted\nuncomfortably in his chair. \"Did you mention decency, Binet? Almost\nyou make me lose my temper, which is a thing that I detest above all\nothers!\" Slowly his glance returned to Climene, who sat with elbows on\nthe table, her chin cupped in her palms, regarding him with something\nbetween scorn and defiance. \"Mademoiselle,\" he said, slowly, \"I desire\nyou purely in your own interests to consider whither you are going.\"\n\n\"I am well able to consider it for myself, and to decide without advice\nfrom you, monsieur.\"\n\n\"And now you've got your answer,\" chuckled Binet. \"I hope you like it.\"\n\nAndre-Louis had paled a little; there was incredulity in his great\nsombre eyes as they continued steadily to regard her. Of M. Binet he\ntook no notice.\n\n\"Surely, mademoiselle, you cannot mean that willingly, with open\neyes and a full understanding of what you do, you would exchange an\nhonourable wifehood for... for the thing that such men as M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr may have in store for you?\"\n\nM. Binet made a wide gesture, and swung to his daughter. \"You hear him,\nthe mealy-mouthed prude! Perhaps you'll believe at last that marriage\nwith him would be the ruin of you. He would always be there the\ninconvenient husband--to mar your every chance, my girl.\"\n\nShe tossed her lovely head in agreement with her father. \"I begin to\nfind him tiresome with his silly jealousies,\" she confessed. \"As a\nhusband I am afraid he would be impossible.\"\n\nAndre-Louis felt a constriction of the heart. But--always the actor--he\nshowed nothing of it. He laughed a little, not very pleasantly, and\nrose.\n\n\"I bow to your choice, mademoiselle. I pray that you may not regret it.\"\n\n\"Regret it?\" cried M. Binet. He was laughing, relieved to see his\ndaughter at last rid of this suitor of whom he had never approved, if we\nexcept those few hours when he really believed him to be an eccentric\nof distinction. \"And what shall she regret? That she accepted the\nprotection of a nobleman so powerful and wealthy that as a mere trinket\nhe gives her a jewel worth as much as an actress earns in a year at the\nComedie Francaise?\" He got up, and advanced towards Andre-Louis. His\nmood became conciliatory. \"Come, come, my friend, no rancour now. What\nthe devil! You wouldn't stand in the girl's way? You can't really blame\nher for making this choice? Have you thought what it means to her? Have\nyou thought that under the protection of such a gentleman there are no\nheights which she may not reach? Don't you see the wonderful luck of\nit? Surely, if you're fond of her, particularly being of a jealous\ntemperament, you wouldn't wish it otherwise?\"\n\nAndre-Louis looked at him in silence for a long moment. Then he laughed\nagain. \"Oh, you are fantastic,\" he said. \"You are not real.\" He turned\non his heel and strode to the door.\n\nThe action, and more the contempt of his look, laugh, and words stung M.\nBinet to passion, drove out the conciliatoriness of his mood.\n\n\"Fantastic, are we?\" he cried, turning to follow the departing\nScaramouche with his little eyes that now were inexpressibly evil.\n\"Fantastic that we should prefer the powerful protection of this great\nnobleman to marriage with a beggarly, nameless bastard. Oh, we are\nfantastic!\"\n\nAndre-Louis turned, his hand upon the door-handle. \"No,\" he said, \"I was\nmistaken. You are not fantastic. You are just vile--both of you.\" And he\nwent out.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. CONTRITION\n\nMlle. de Kercadiou walked with her aunt in the bright morning sunshine\nof a Sunday in March on the broad terrace of the Chateau de Sautron.\n\nFor one of her natural sweetness of disposition she had been oddly\nirritable of late, manifesting signs of a cynical worldliness, which\nconvinced Mme. de Sautron more than ever that her brother Quintin\nhad scandalously conducted the child's education. She appeared to be\ninstructed in all the things of which a girl is better ignorant, and\nignorant of all the things that a girl should know. That at least was\nthe point of view of Mme. de Sautron.\n\n\"Tell me, madame,\" quoth Aline, \"are all men beasts?\" Unlike her\nbrother, Madame la Comtesse was tall and majestically built. In the days\nbefore her marriage with M. de Sautron, ill-natured folk described her\nas the only man in the family. She looked down now from her noble height\nupon her little niece with startled eyes.\n\n\"Really, Aline, you have a trick of asking the most disconcerting and\nimproper questions.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is because I find life disconcerting and improper.\"\n\n\"Life? A young girl should not discuss life.\"\n\n\"Why not, since I am alive? You do not suggest that it is an impropriety\nto be alive?\"\n\n\"It is an impropriety for a young unmarried girl to seek to know too\nmuch about life. As for your absurd question about men, when I remind\nyou that man is the noblest work of God, perhaps you will consider\nyourself answered.\"\n\nMme. de Sautron did not invite a pursuance of the subject. But Mlle. de\nKercadiou's outrageous rearing had made her headstrong.\n\n\"That being so,\" said she, \"will you tell me why they find such an\noverwhelming attraction in the immodest of our sex?\"\n\nMadame stood still and raised shocked hands. Then she looked down her\nhandsome, high-bridged nose.\n\n\"Sometimes--often, in fact, my dear Aline--you pass all understanding.\nI shall write to Quintin that the sooner you are married the better it\nwill be for all.\"\n\n\"Uncle Quintin has left that matter to my own deciding,\" Aline reminded\nher.\n\n\"That,\" said madame with complete conviction, \"is the last and most\noutrageous of his errors. Who ever heard of a girl being left to decide\nthe matter of her own marriage? It is... indelicate almost to expose her\nto thoughts of such things.\" Mme. de Sautron shuddered. \"Quintin is a\nboor. His conduct is unheard of. That M. de La Tour d'Azyr should parade\nhimself before you so that you may make up your mind whether he is the\nproper man for you!\" Again she shuddered. \"It is of a grossness, of...\nof a prurience almost... Mon Dieu! When I married your uncle, all this\nwas arranged between our parents. I first saw him when he came to sign\nthe contract. I should have died of shame had it been otherwise. And\nthat is how these affairs should be conducted.\"\n\n\"You are no doubt right, madame. But since that is not how my own case\nis being conducted, you will forgive me if I deal with it apart from\nothers. M. de La Tour d'Azyr desires to marry me. He has been permitted\nto pay his court. I should be glad to have him informed that he may\ncease to do so.\"\n\nMme. de Sautron stood still, petrified by amazement. Her long face\nturned white; she seemed to breathe with difficulty.\n\n\"But... but... what are you saying?\" she gasped.\n\nQuietly Aline repeated her statement.\n\n\"But this is outrageous! You cannot be permitted to play fast-and-loose\nwith a gentleman of M. le Marquis' quality! Why, it is little more than\na week since you permitted him to be informed that you would become his\nwife!\"\n\n\"I did so in a moment of... rashness. Since then M. le Marquis' own\nconduct has convinced me of my error.\"\n\n\"But--mon Dieu!\" cried the Countess. \"Are you blind to the great honour\nthat is being paid you? M. le Marquis will make you the first lady in\nBrittany. Yet, little fool that you are, and greater fool that Quintin\nis, you trifle with this extraordinary good fortune! Let me warn you.\"\nShe raised an admonitory forefinger. \"If you continue in this stupid\nhumour M. de La Tour d'Azyr may definitely withdraw his offer and depart\nin justified mortification.\"\n\n\"That, madame, as I am endeavouring to convey to you, is what I most\ndesire.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are mad.\"\n\n\"It may be, madame, that I am sane in preferring to be guided by my\ninstincts. It may be even that I am justified in resenting that the man\nwho aspires to become my husband should at the same time be paying such\nassiduous homage to a wretched theatre girl at the Feydau.\"\n\n\"Aline!\"\n\n\"Is it not true? Or perhaps you do not find it strange that M. de La\nTour d'Azyr should so conduct himself at such a time?\"\n\n\"Aline, you are so extraordinary a mixture. At moments you shock me by\nthe indecency of your expressions; at others you amaze me by the excess\nof your prudery. You have been brought up like a little bourgeoise, I\nthink. Yes, that is it--a little bourgeoise. Quintin was always something\nof a shopkeeper at heart.\"\n\n\"I was asking your opinion on the conduct of M. de La Tour d'Azyr,\nmadame. Not on my own.\"\n\n\"But it is an indelicacy in you to observe such things. You should be\nignorant of them, and I can't think who is so... so unfeeling as to\ninform you. But since you are informed, at least you should be modestly\nblind to things that take place outside the... orbit of a properly\nconducted demoiselle.\"\n\n\"Will they still be outside my orbit when I am married?\"\n\n\"If you are wise. You should remain without knowledge of them. It... it\ndeflowers your innocence. I would not for the world that M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr should know you so extraordinarily instructed. Had you been\nproperly reared in a convent this would never have happened to you.\"\n\n\"But you do not answer me, madame!\" cried Aline in despair. \"It is not\nmy chastity that is in question; but that of M. de La Tour d'Azyr.\"\n\n\"Chastity!\" Madame's lips trembled with horror. Horror overspread her\nface. \"Wherever did you learn that dreadful, that so improper word?\"\n\nAnd then Mme. de Sautron did violence to her feelings. She realized that\nhere great calm and prudence were required. \"My child, since you know so\nmuch that you ought not to know, there can be no harm in my adding that\na gentleman must have these little distractions.\"\n\n\"But why, madame? Why is it so?\"\n\n\"Ah, mon Dieu, you are asking me riddles of nature. It is so because it\nis so. Because men are like that.\"\n\n\"Because men are beasts, you mean--which is what I began by asking you.\"\n\n\"You are incorrigibly stupid, Aline.\"\n\n\"You mean that I do not see things as you do, madame. I am not\nover-expectant as you appear to think; yet surely I have the right to\nexpect that whilst M. de La Tour d'Azyr is wooing me, he shall not be\nwooing at the same time a drab of the theatre. I feel that in this there\nis a subtle association of myself with that unspeakable creature which\nsoils and insults me. The Marquis is a dullard whose wooing takes the\nform at best of stilted compliments, stupid and unoriginal. They gain\nnothing when they fall from lips still warm from the contamination of\nthat woman's kisses.\"\n\nSo utterly scandalized was madame that for a moment she remained\nspeechless. Then--\n\n\"Mon Dieu!\" she exclaimed. \"I should never have suspected you of so\nindelicate an imagination.\"\n\n\"I cannot help it, madame. Each time his lips touch my fingers I find\nmyself thinking of the last object that they touched. I at once retire\nto wash my hands. Next time, madame, unless you are good enough to\nconvey my message to him, I shall call for water and wash them in his\npresence.\"\n\n\"But what am I to tell him? How... in what words can I convey such a\nmessage?\" Madame was aghast.\n\n\"Be frank with him, madame. It is easiest in the end. Tell him that\nhowever impure may have been his life in the past, however impure he\nintend that it shall be in the future, he must at least study purity\nwhilst approaching with a view to marriage a virgin who is herself pure\nand without stain.\"\n\nMadame recoiled, and put her hands to her ears, horror stamped on her\nhandsome face. Her massive bosom heaved.\n\n\"Oh, how can you?\" she panted. \"How can you make use of such terrible\nexpressions? Wherever have you learnt them?\"\n\n\"In church,\" said Aline.\n\n\"Ah, but in church many things are said that... that one would not dream\nof saying in the world. My dear child, how could I possibly say such a\nthing to M. le Marquis? How could I possibly?\"\n\n\"Shall I say it?\"\n\n\"Aline!\"\n\n\"Well, there it is,\" said Aline. \"Something must be done to shelter me\nfrom insult. I am utterly disgusted with M. le Marquis--a disgusting man.\nAnd however fine a thing it may be to become Marquise de La Tour d'Azyr,\nwhy, frankly, I'd sooner marry a cobbler who practised decency.\"\n\nSuch was her vehemence and obvious determination that Mme. de Sautron\nfetched herself out of her despair to attempt persuasion. Aline was her\nniece, and such a marriage in the family would be to the credit of the\nwhole of it. At all costs nothing must frustrate it.\n\n\"Listen, my dear,\" she said. \"Let us reason. M. le Marquis is away and\nwill not be back until to-morrow.\"\n\n\"True. And I know where he has gone--or at least whom he has gone with.\nMon Dieu, and the drab has a father and a lout of a fellow who intends\nto make her his wife, and neither of them chooses to do anything. I\nsuppose they agree with you, madame, that a great gentleman must have\nhis little distractions.\" Her contempt was as scorching as a thing of\nfire. \"However, madame, you were about to say?\"\n\n\"That on the day after to-morrow you are returning to Gavrillac. M. de\nLa Tour d'Azyr will most likely follow at his leisure.\"\n\n\"You mean when this dirty candle is burnt out?\"\n\n\"Call it what you will.\" Madame, you see, despaired by now of\ncontrolling the impropriety of her niece's expressions. \"At Gavrillac\nthere will be no Mlle. Binet. This thing will be in the past. It is\nunfortunate that he should have met her at such a moment. The chit is\nvery attractive, after all. You cannot deny that. And you must make\nallowances.\"\n\n\"M. le Marquis formally proposed to me a week ago. Partly to satisfy the\nwishes of the family, and partly...\" She broke off, hesitating a moment,\nto resume on a note of dull pain, \"Partly because it does not seem\ngreatly to matter whom I marry, I gave him my consent. That consent,\nfor the reasons I have given you, madame, I desire now definitely to\nwithdraw.\"\n\nMadame fell into agitation of the wildest. \"Aline, I should never\nforgive you! Your uncle Quintin would be in despair. You do not know\nwhat you are saying, what a wonderful thing you are refusing. Have you\nno sense of your position, of the station into which you were born?\"\n\n\"If I had not, madame, I should have made an end long since. If I have\ntolerated this suit for a single moment, it is because I realize the\nimportance of a suitable marriage in the worldly sense. But I ask of\nmarriage something more; and Uncle Quintin has placed the decision in my\nhands.\"\n\n\"God forgive him!\" said madame. And then she hurried on: \"Leave this\nto me now, Aline. Be guided by me--oh, be guided by me!\" Her tone was\nbeseeching. \"I will take counsel with your uncle Charles. But do not\ndefinitely decide until this unfortunate affair has blown over. Charles\nwill know how to arrange it. M. le Marquis shall do penance, child,\nsince your tyranny demands it; but not in sackcloth and ashes. You'll\nnot ask so much?\"\n\nAline shrugged. \"I ask nothing at all,\" she said, which was neither\nassent nor dissent.\n\nSo Mme. de Sautron interviewed her husband, a slight, middle-aged man,\nvery aristocratic in appearance and gifted with a certain shrewd sense.\nShe took with him precisely the tone that Aline had taken with herself\nand which in Aline she had found so disconcertingly indelicate. She even\nborrowed several of Aline's phrases.\n\nThe result was that on the Monday afternoon when at last M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr's returning berline drove up to the chateau, he was met by M. le\nComte de Sautron who desired a word with him even before he changed.\n\n\"Gervais, you're a fool,\" was the excellent opening made by M. le Comte.\n\n\"Charles, you give me no news,\" answered M. le Marquis. \"Of what\nparticular folly do you take the trouble to complain?\"\n\nHe flung himself wearily upon a sofa, and his long graceful body\nsprawling there he looked up at his friend with a tired smile on that\nnobly handsome pale face that seemed to defy the onslaught of age.\n\n\"Of your last. This Binet girl.\"\n\n\"That! Pooh! An incident; hardly a folly.\"\n\n\"A folly--at such a time,\" Sautron insisted. The Marquis looked a\nquestion. The Count answered it. \"Aline,\" said he, pregnantly. \"She\nknows. How she knows I can't tell you, but she knows, and she is deeply\noffended.\"\n\nThe smile perished on the Marquis' face. He gathered himself up.\n\n\"Offended?\" said he, and his voice was anxious.\n\n\"But yes. You know what she is. You know the ideals she has formed. It\nwounds her that at such a time--whilst you are here for the purpose of\nwooing her--you should at the same time be pursuing this affair with that\nchit of a Binet girl.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" asked La Tour d'Azyr.\n\n\"She has confided in her aunt. And the poor child seems to have some\nreason. She says she will not tolerate that you should come to kiss her\nhand with lips that are still contaminated from... Oh, you understand.\nYou appreciate the impression of such a thing upon a pure, sensitive\ngirl such as Aline. She said--I had better tell you--that the next\ntime you kiss her hand, she will call for water and wash it in your\npresence.\"\n\nThe Marquis' face flamed scarlet. He rose. Knowing his violent,\nintolerant spirit, M. de Sautron was prepared for an outburst. But no\noutburst came. The Marquis turned away from him, and paced slowly to\nthe window, his head bowed, his hands behind his back. Halted there he\nspoke, without turning, his voice was at once scornful and wistful.\n\n\"You are right, Charles, I am a fool--a wicked fool! I have just enough\nsense left to perceive it. It is the way I have lived, I suppose. I have\nnever known the need to deny myself anything I wanted.\" Then suddenly he\nswung round, and the outburst came. \"But, my God, I want Aline as I\nhave never wanted anything yet! I think I should kill myself in rage if\nthrough my folly I should have lost her.\" He struck his brow with his\nhand. \"I am a beast!\" he said. \"I should have known that if that sweet\nsaint got word of these petty devilries of mine she would despise me;\nand I tell you, Charles, I'd go through fire to regain her respect.\"\n\n\"I hope it is to be regained on easier terms,\" said Charles; and then\nto ease the situation which began to irk him by its solemnity, he made\na feeble joke. \"It is merely asked of you that you refrain from going\nthrough certain fires that are not accounted by mademoiselle of too\npurifying a nature.\"\n\n\"As to that Binet girl, it is finished--finished,\" said the Marquis.\n\n\"I congratulate you. When did you make that decision?\"\n\n\"This moment. I would to God I had made it twenty-four hours ago. As it\nis--\" he shrugged--\"why, twenty-four hours of her have been enough for\nme as they would have been for any man--a mercenary, self-seeking little\nbaggage with the soul of a trull. Bah!\" He shuddered in disgust of\nhimself and her.\n\n\"Ah! That makes it easier for you,\" said M. de Sautron, cynically.\n\n\"Don't say it, Charles. It is not so. Had you been less of a fool, you\nwould have warned me sooner.\"\n\n\"I may prove to have warned you soon enough if you'll profit by the\nwarning.\"\n\n\"There is no penance I will not do. I will prostrate myself at her feet.\nI will abase myself before her. I will make confession in the proper\nspirit of contrition, and Heaven helping me, I'll keep to my purpose of\namendment for her sweet sake.\" He was tragically in earnest.\n\nTo M. de Sautron, who had never seen him other than self-contained,\nsupercilious, and mocking, this was an amazing revelation. He shrank\nfrom it almost; it gave him the feeling of prying, of peeping through a\nkeyhole. He slapped his friend's shoulder.\n\n\"My dear Gervais, here is a magnificently romantic mood. Enough said.\nKeep to it, and I promise you that all will presently be well. I will be\nyour ambassador, and you shall have no cause to complain.\"\n\n\"But may I not go to her myself?\"\n\n\"If you are wise you will at once efface yourself. Write to her if you\nwill--make your act of contrition by letter. I will explain why you have\ngone without seeing her. I will tell her that you did so upon my advice,\nand I will do it tactfully. I am a good diplomat, Gervais. Trust me.\"\n\nM. le Marquis raised his head, and showed a face that pain was searing.\nHe held out his hand. \"Very well, Charles. Serve me in this, and count\nme your friend in all things.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. THE FRACAS AT THE THEATRE FEYDAU\n\nLeaving his host to act as his plenipotentiary with Mademoiselle de\nKercadiou, and to explain to her that it was his profound contrition\nthat compelled him to depart without taking formal leave of her, the\nMarquis rolled away from Sautron in a cloud of gloom. Twenty-four hours\nwith La Binet had been more than enough for a man of his fastidious\nand discerning taste. He looked back upon the episode with nausea--the\ninevitable psychological reaction--marvelling at himself that until\nyesterday he should have found her so desirable, and cursing himself\nthat for the sake of that ephemeral and worthless gratification he\nshould seriously have imperilled his chances of winning Mademoiselle de\nKercadiou to wife. There is, after all, nothing very extraordinary in\nhis frame of mind, so that I need not elaborate it further. It resulted\nfrom the conflict between the beast and the angel that go to make up the\ncomposition of every man.\n\nThe Chevalier de Chabrillane--who in reality occupied towards the Marquis\na position akin to that of gentleman-in-waiting--sat opposite to him in\nthe enormous travelling berline. A small folding table had been erected\nbetween them, and the Chevalier suggested piquet. But M. le Marquis was\nin no humour for cards. His thoughts absorbed him. As they were rattling\nover the cobbles of Nantes' streets, he remembered a promise to La Binet\nto witness her performance that night in \"The Faithless Lover.\" And now\nhe was running away from her. The thought was repugnant to him on two\nscores. He was breaking his pledged word, and he was acting like a\ncoward. And there was more than that. He had led the mercenary little\nstrumpet--it was thus he thought of her at present, and with some\njustice--to expect favours from him in addition to the lavish awards\nwhich already he had made her. The baggage had almost sought to drive a\nbargain with him as to her future. He was to take her to Paris, put her\ninto her own furniture--as the expression ran, and still runs--and under\nthe shadow of his powerful protection see that the doors of the great\ntheatres of the capital should be opened to her talents. He had not--he\nwas thankful to reflect--exactly committed himself. But neither had\nhe definitely refused her. It became necessary now to come to an\nunderstanding, since he was compelled to choose between his trivial\npassion for her--a passion quenched already--and his deep, almost\nspiritual devotion to Mademoiselle de Kercadiou.\n\nHis honour, he considered, demanded of him that he should at once\ndeliver himself from a false position. La Binet would make a scene, of\ncourse; but he knew the proper specific to apply to hysteria of that\nnature. Money, after all, has its uses.\n\nHe pulled the cord. The carriage rolled to a standstill; a footman\nappeared at the door.\n\n\"To the Theatre Feydau,\" said he.\n\nThe footman vanished and the berline rolled on. M. de Chabrillane\nlaughed cynically.\n\n\"I'll trouble you not to be amused,\" snapped the Marquis. \"You\ndon't understand.\" Thereafter he explained himself. It was a rare\ncondescension in him. But, then, he could not bear to be misunderstood\nin such a matter. Chabrillane grew serious in reflection of the Marquis'\nextreme seriousness.\n\n\"Why not write?\" he suggested. \"Myself, I confess that I should find it\neasier.\"\n\nNothing could better have revealed M. le Marquis' state of mind than his\nanswer.\n\n\"Letters are liable both to miscarriage and to misconstruction. Two\nrisks I will not run. If she did not answer, I should never know which\nhad been incurred. And I shall have no peace of mind until I know that I\nhave set a term to this affair. The berline can wait while we are at\nthe theatre. We will go on afterwards. We will travel all night if\nnecessary.\"\n\n\"Peste!\" said M. de Chabrillane with a grimace. But that was all.\n\nThe great travelling carriage drew up at the lighted portals of the\nFeydau, and M. le Marquis stepped out. He entered the theatre with\nChabrillane, all unconsciously to deliver himself into the hands of\nAndre-Louis.\n\nAndre-Louis was in a state of exasperation produced by Climene's long\nabsence from Nantes in the company of M. le Marquis, and fed by the\nunspeakable complacency with which M. Binet regarded that event of quite\nunmistakable import.\n\nHowever much he might affect the frame of mind of the stoics, and\nseek to judge with a complete detachment, in the heart and soul of him\nAndre-Louis was tormented and revolted. It was not Climene he blamed.\nHe had been mistaken in her. She was just a poor weak vessel driven\nhelplessly by the first breath, however foul, that promised her\nadvancement. She suffered from the plague of greed; and he congratulated\nhimself upon having discovered it before making her his wife. He felt\nfor her now nothing but a deal of pity and some contempt. The pity was\nbegotten of the love she had lately inspired in him. It might be likened\nto the dregs of love, all that remained after the potent wine of it had\nbeen drained off. His anger he reserved for her father and her seducer.\n\nThe thoughts that were stirring in him on that Monday morning, when it\nwas discovered that Climene had not yet returned from her excursion\nof the previous day in the coach of M. le Marquis, were already wicked\nenough without the spurring they received from the distraught Leandre.\n\nHitherto the attitude of each of these men towards the other had been\none of mutual contempt. The phenomenon has frequently been observed in\nlike cases. Now, what appeared to be a common misfortune brought them\ninto a sort of alliance. So, at least, it seemed to Leandre when he went\nin quest of Andre-Louis, who with apparent unconcern was smoking a pipe\nupon the quay immediately facing the inn.\n\n\"Name of a pig!\" said Leandre. \"How can you take your ease and smoke at\nsuch a time?\"\n\nScaramouche surveyed the sky. \"I do not find it too cold,\" said he. \"The\nsun is shining. I am very well here.\"\n\n\"Do I talk of the weather?\" Leandre was very excited.\n\n\"Of what, then?\"\n\n\"Of Climene, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh! The lady has ceased to interest me,\" he lied.\n\nLeandre stood squarely in front of him, a handsome figure handsomely\ndressed in these days, his hair well powdered, his stockings of silk.\nHis face was pale, his large eyes looked larger than usual.\n\n\"Ceased to interest you? Are you not to marry her?\"\n\nAndre-Louis expelled a cloud of smoke. \"You cannot wish to be offensive.\nYet you almost suggest that I live on other men's leavings.\"\n\n\"My God!\" said Leandre, overcome, and he stared awhile. Then he burst\nout afresh. \"Are you quite heartless? Are you always Scaramouche?\"\n\n\"What do you expect me to do?\" asked Andre-Louis, evincing surprise in\nhis own turn, but faintly.\n\n\"I do not expect you to let her go without a struggle.\"\n\n\"But she has gone already.\" Andre-Louis pulled at his pipe a moment,\nwhat time Leandre clenched and unclenched his hands in impotent rage.\n\"And to what purpose struggle against the inevitable? Did you struggle\nwhen I took her from you?\"\n\n\"She was not mine to be taken from me. I but aspired, and you won the\nrace. But even had it been otherwise where is the comparison? That was a\nthing in honour; this--this is hell.\"\n\nHis emotion moved Andre-Louis. He took Leandre's arm. \"You're a good\nfellow, Leandre. I am glad I intervened to save you from your fate.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't love her!\" cried the other, passionately. \"You never did.\nYou don't know what it means to love, or you'd not talk like this. My\nGod! if she had been my affianced wife and this had happened, I should\nhave killed the man--killed him! Do you hear me? But you... Oh, you, you\ncome out here and smoke, and take the air, and talk of her as another\nman's leavings. I wonder I didn't strike you for the word.\"\n\nHe tore his arm from the other's grip, and looked almost as if he would\nstrike him now.\n\n\"You should have done it,\" said Andre-Louis. \"It's in your part.\"\n\nWith an imprecation Leandre turned on his heel to go. Andre-Louis\narrested his departure.\n\n\"A moment, my friend. Test me by yourself. Would you marry her now?\"\n\n\"Would I?\" The young man's eyes blazed with passion. \"Would I? Let her\nsay that she will marry me, and I am her slave.\"\n\n\"Slave is the right word--a slave in hell.\"\n\n\"It would never be hell to me where she was, whatever she had done. I\nlove her, man, I am not like you. I love her, do you hear me?\"\n\n\"I have known it for some time,\" said Andre-Louis. \"Though I didn't\nsuspect your attack of the disease to be quite so violent. Well, God\nknows I loved her, too, quite enough to share your thirst for killing.\nFor myself, the blue blood of La Tour d'Azyr would hardly quench this\nthirst. I should like to add to it the dirty fluid that flows in the\nveins of the unspeakable Binet.\"\n\nFor a second his emotion had been out of hand, and he revealed to\nLeandre in the mordant tone of those last words something of the fires\nthat burned under his icy exterior. The young man caught him by the\nhand.\n\n\"I knew you were acting,\" said he. \"You feel--you feel as I do.\"\n\n\"Behold us, fellows in viciousness. I have betrayed myself, it seems.\nWell, and what now? Do you want to see this pretty Marquis torn limb\nfrom limb? I might afford you the spectacle.\"\n\n\"What?\" Leandre stared, wondering was this another of Scaramouche's\ncynicisms.\n\n\"It isn't really difficult provided I have aid. I require only a little.\nWill you lend it me?\"\n\n\"Anything you ask,\" Leandre exploded. \"My life if you require it.\"\n\nAndre-Louis took his arm again. \"Let us walk,\" he said. \"I will instruct\nyou.\"\n\nWhen they came back the company was already at dinner. Mademoiselle had\nnot yet returned. Sullenness presided at the table. Columbine and Madame\nwore anxious expressions. The fact was that relations between Binet and\nhis troupe were daily growing more strained.\n\nAndre-Louis and Leandre went each to his accustomed place. Binet's\nlittle eyes followed them with a malicious gleam, his thick lips pouted\ninto a crooked smile.\n\n\"You two are grown very friendly of a sudden,\" he mocked.\n\n\"You are a man of discernment, Binet,\" said Scaramouche, the cold\nloathing of his voice itself an insult. \"Perhaps you discern the\nreason?\"\n\n\"It is readily discerned.\"\n\n\"Regale the company with it!\" he begged; and waited. \"What? You\nhesitate? Is it possible that there are limits to your shamelessness?\"\n\nBinet reared his great head. \"Do you want to quarrel with me,\nScaramouche?\" Thunder was rumbling in his deep voice.\n\n\"Quarrel? You want to laugh. A man doesn't quarrel with creatures like\nyou. We all know the place held in the public esteem by complacent\nhusbands. But, in God's name, what place is there at all for complacent\nfathers?\"\n\nBinet heaved himself up, a great towering mass of manhood. Violently he\nshook off the restraining hand of Pierrot who sat on his left.\n\n\"A thousand devils!\" he roared; \"if you take that tone with me, I'll\nbreak every bone in your filthy body.\"\n\n\"If you were to lay a finger on me, Binet, you would give me the only\nprovocation I still need to kill you.\" Andre-Louis was as calm as ever,\nand therefore the more menacing. Alarm stirred the company. He protruded\nfrom his pocket the butt of a pistol--newly purchased. \"I go armed,\nBinet. It is only fair to give you warning. Provoke me as you have\nsuggested, and I'll kill you with no more compunction than I should kill\na slug, which after all is the thing you most resemble--a slug, Binet; a\nfat, slimy body; foulness without soul and without intelligence. When I\ncome to think of it I can't suffer to sit at table with you. It turns my\nstomach.\"\n\nHe pushed away his platter and got up. \"I'll go and eat at the ordinary\nbelow stairs.\"\n\nThereupon up jumped Columbine.\n\n\"And I'll come with you, Scaramouche!\" cried she.\n\nIt acted like a signal. Had the thing been concerted it couldn't\nhave fallen out more uniformly. Binet, in fact, was persuaded of a\nconspiracy. For in the wake of Columbine went Leandre, in the wake of\nLeandre, Polichinelle and then all the rest together, until Binet found\nhimself sitting alone at the head of an empty table in an empty room--a\nbadly shaken man whose rage could afford him no support against the\ndread by which he was suddenly invaded.\n\nHe sat down to think things out, and he was still at that melancholy\noccupation when perhaps a half-hour later his daughter entered the room,\nreturned at last from her excursion.\n\nShe looked pale, even a little scared--in reality excessively\nself-conscious now that the ordeal of facing all the company awaited\nher.\n\nSeeing no one but her father in the room, she checked on the threshold.\n\n\"Where is everybody?\" she asked, in a voice rendered natural by effort.\n\nM. Binet reared his great head and turned upon her eyes that were\nblood-injected. He scowled, blew out his thick lips and made harsh\nnoises in his throat. Yet he took stock of her, so graceful and comely\nand looking so completely the lady of fashion in her long fur-trimmed\ntravelling coat of bottle green, her muff and her broad hat adorned by\na sparkling Rhinestone buckle above her adorably coiffed brown hair. No\nneed to fear the future whilst he owned such a daughter, let Scaramouche\nplay what tricks he would.\n\nHe expressed, however, none of these comforting reflections.\n\n\"So you're back at last, little fool,\" he growled in greeting. \"I was\nbeginning to ask myself if we should perform this evening. It wouldn't\ngreatly have surprised me if you had not returned in time. Indeed,\nsince you have chosen to play the fine hand you held in your own way and\nscorning my advice, nothing can surprise me.\"\n\nShe crossed the room to the table, and leaning against it, looked down\nupon him almost disdainfully.\n\n\"I have nothing to regret,\" she said.\n\n\"So every fool says at first. Nor would you admit it if you had. You\nare like that. You go your own way in spite of advice from older heads.\nDeath of my life, girl, what do you know of men?\"\n\n\"I am not complaining,\" she reminded him.\n\n\"No, but you may be presently, when you discover that you would have\ndone better to have been guided by your old father. So long as your\nMarquis languished for you, there was nothing you could not have done\nwith the fool. So long as you let him have no more than your fingertips\nto kiss... ah, name of a name! that was the time to build your future.\nIf you live to be a thousand you'll never have such a chance again, and\nyou've squandered it, for what?\"\n\nMademoiselle sat down.--\"You're sordid,\" she said, with disgust.\n\n\"Sordid, am I?\" His thick lips curled again. \"I have had enough of the\ndregs of life, and so I should have thought have you. You held a hand\non which to have won a fortune if you had played it as I bade you. Well,\nyou've played it, and where's the fortune? We can whistle for that as\na sailor whistles for wind. And, by Heaven, we'll need to whistle\npresently if the weather in the troupe continues as it's set in. That\nscoundrel Scaramouche has been at his ape's tricks with them. They've\nsuddenly turned moral. They won't sit at table with me any more.\" He\nwas spluttering between anger and sardonic mirth. \"It was your friend\nScaramouche set them the example of that. He threatened my life\nactually. Threatened my life! Called me... Oh, but what does that\nmatter? What matters is that the next thing to happen to us will be that\nthe Binet Troupe will discover it can manage without M. Binet and his\ndaughter. This scoundrelly bastard I've befriended has little by little\nrobbed me of everything. It's in his power to-day to rob me of my\ntroupe, and the knave's ungrateful enough and vile enough to make use of\nhis power.\n\n\"Let him,\" said mademoiselle contemptuously.\n\n\"Let him?\" He was aghast. \"And what's to become of us?\"\n\n\"In no case will the Binet Troupe interest me much longer,\" said she. \"I\nshall be going to Paris soon. There are better theatres there than the\nFeydau. There's Mlle. Montansier's theatre in the Palais Royal; there's\nthe Ambigu Comique; there's the Comedie Francaise; there's even a\npossibility I may have a theatre of my own.\"\n\nHis eyes grew big for once. He stretched out a fat hand, and placed it\non one of hers. She noticed that it trembled.\n\n\"Has he promised that? Has he promised?\"\n\nShe looked at him with her head on one side, eyes sly and a queer little\nsmile on her perfect lips.\n\n\"He did not refuse me when I asked it,\" she answered, with conviction\nthat all was as she desired it.\n\n\"Bah!\" He withdrew his hand, and heaved himself up. There was disgust\non his face. \"He did not refuse!\" he mocked her; and then with passion:\n\"Had you acted as I advised you, he would have consented to anything\nthat you asked, and what is more he would have provided anything\nthat you asked--anything that lay within his means, and they are\ninexhaustible. You have changed a certainty into a possibility, and\nI hate possibilities--God of God! I have lived on possibilities, and\ninfernally near starved on them.\"\n\nHad she known of the interview taking place at that moment at the\nChateau de Sautron she would have laughed less confidently at her\nfather's gloomy forebodings. But she was destined never to know, which\nindeed was the cruellest punishment of all. She was to attribute all the\nevil that of a sudden overwhelmed her, the shattering of all the future\nhopes she had founded upon the Marquis and the sudden disintegration\nof the Binet Troupe, to the wicked interference of that villain\nScaramouche.\n\nShe had this much justification that possibly, without the warning\nfrom M. de Sautron, the Marquis would have found in the events of\nthat evening at the Theatre Feydau a sufficient reason for ending an\nentanglement that was fraught with too much unpleasant excitement,\nwhilst the breaking-up of the Binet Troupe was most certainly the result\nof Andre-Louis' work. But it was not a result that he intended or even\nforesaw.\n\nSo much was this the case that in the interval after the second act,\nhe sought the dressing-room shared by Polichinelle and Rhodomont.\nPolichinelle was in the act of changing.\n\n\"I shouldn't trouble to change,\" he said. \"The piece isn't likely to go\nbeyond my opening scene of the next act with Leandre.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You'll see.\" He put a paper on Polichinelle's table amid the\ngrease-paints. \"Cast your eye over that. It's a sort of last will and\ntestament in favour of the troupe. I was a lawyer once; the document\nis in order. I relinquish to all of you the share produced by my\npartnership in the company.\"\n\n\"But you don't mean that you are leaving us?\" cried Polichinelle in\nalarm, whilst Rhodomont's sudden stare asked the same question.\n\nScaramouche's shrug was eloquent. Polichinelle ran on gloomily: \"Of\ncourse it was to have been foreseen. But why should you be the one to\ngo? It is you who have made us; and it is you who are the real head\nand brains of the troupe; it is you who have raised it into a real\ntheatrical company. If any one must go, let it be Binet--Binet and his\ninfernal daughter. Or if you go, name of a name! we all go with you!\"\n\n\"Aye,\" added Rhodomont, \"we've had enough of that fat scoundrel.\"\n\n\"I had thought of it, of course,\" said Andre-Louis. \"It was not vanity,\nfor once; it was trust in your friendship. After to-night we may\nconsider it again, if I survive.\"\n\n\"If you survive?\" both cried.\n\nPolichinelle got up. \"Now, what madness have you in mind?\" he asked.\n\n\"For one thing I think I am indulging Leandre; for another I am pursuing\nan old quarrel.\"\n\nThe three knocks sounded as he spoke.\n\n\"There, I must go. Keep that paper, Polichinelle. After all, it may not\nbe necessary.\"\n\nHe was gone. Rhodomont stared at Polichinelle. Polichinelle stared at\nRhodomont.\n\n\"What the devil is he thinking of?\" quoth the latter.\n\n\"That is most readily ascertained by going to see,\" replied\nPolichinelle. He completed changing in haste, and despite what\nScaramouche had said; and then followed with Rhodomont.\n\nAs they approached the wings a roar of applause met them coming from\nthe audience. It was applause and something else; applause on an unusual\nnote. As it faded away they heard the voice of Scaramouche ringing clear\nas a bell:\n\n\"And so you see, my dear M. Leandre, that when you speak of the Third\nEstate, it is necessary to be more explicit. What precisely is the Third\nEstate?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Leandre.\n\nThere was a gasp from the audience, audible in the wings, and then\nswiftly followed Scaramouche's next question:\n\n\"True. Alas! But what should it be?\"\n\n\"Everything,\" said Leandre.\n\nThe audience roared its acclamations, the more violent because of the\nunexpectedness of that reply.\n\n\"True again,\" said Scaramouche. \"And what is more, that is what it will\nbe; that is what it already is. Do you doubt it?\"\n\n\"I hope it,\" said the schooled Leandre.\n\n\"You may believe it,\" said Scaramouche, and again the acclamations\nrolled into thunder.\n\nPolichinelle and Rhodomont exchanged glances: indeed, the former winked,\nnot without mirth.\n\n\"Sacred name!\" growled a voice behind them. \"Is the scoundrel at his\npolitical tricks again?\"\n\nThey turned to confront M. Binet. Moving with that noiseless tread of\nhis, he had come up unheard behind them, and there he stood now in his\nscarlet suit of Pantaloon under a trailing bedgown, his little eyes\nglaring from either side of his false nose. But their attention was held\nby the voice of Scaramouche. He had stepped to the front of the stage.\n\n\"He doubts it,\" he was telling the audience. \"But then this M. Leandre\nis himself akin to those who worship the worm-eaten idol of Privilege,\nand so he is a little afraid to believe a truth that is becoming\napparent to all the world. Shall I convince him? Shall I tell him how a\ncompany of noblemen backed by their servants under arms--six hundred men\nin all--sought to dictate to the Third Estate of Rennes a few short weeks\nago? Must I remind him of the martial front shown on that occasion by\nthe Third Estate, and how they swept the streets clean of that rabble of\nnobles--cette canaille noble...\"\n\nApplause interrupted him. The phrase had struck home and caught. Those\nwho had writhed under that infamous designation from their betters leapt\nat this turning of it against the nobles themselves.\n\n\"But let me tell you of their leader--le pins noble de cette canaille,\nou bien le plus canaille de ces nobles! You know him--that one. He fears\nmany things, but the voice of truth he fears most. With such as him the\neloquent truth eloquently spoken is a thing instantly to be silenced.\nSo he marshalled his peers and their valetailles, and led them out to\nslaughter these miserable bourgeois who dared to raise a voice. But\nthese same miserable bourgeois did not choose to be slaughtered in the\nstreets of Rennes. It occurred to them that since the nobles decreed\nthat blood should flow, it might as well be the blood of the nobles.\nThey marshalled themselves too--this noble rabble against the rabble of\nnobles--and they marshalled themselves so well that they drove M. de La\nTour d'Azyr and his warlike following from the field with broken\nheads and shattered delusions. They sought shelter at the hands of\nthe Cordeliers; and the shavelings gave them sanctuary in their\nconvent--those who survived, among whom was their proud leader, M. de La\nTour d'Azyr. You have heard of this valiant Marquis, this great lord of\nlife and death?\"\n\nThe pit was in an uproar a moment. It quieted again as Scaramouche\ncontinued:\n\n\"Oh, it was a fine spectacle to see this mighty hunter scuttling to\ncover like a hare, going to earth in the Cordelier Convent. Rennes has\nnot seen him since. Rennes would like to see him again. But if he is\nvalorous, he is also discreet. And where do you think he has taken\nrefuge, this great nobleman who wanted to see the streets of Rennes\nwashed in the blood of its citizens, this man who would have butchered\nold and young of the contemptible canaille to silence the voice of\nreason and of liberty that presumes to ring through France to-day? Where\ndo you think he hides himself? Why, here in Nantes.\"\n\nAgain there was uproar.\n\n\"What do you say? Impossible? Why, my friends, at this moment he is here\nin this theatre--skulking up there in that box. He is too shy to\nshow himself--oh, a very modest gentleman. But there he is behind the\ncurtains. Will you not show yourself to your friends, M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr, Monsieur le Marquis who considers eloquence so very dangerous a\ngift? See, they would like a word with you; they do not believe me when\nI tell them that you are here.\"\n\nNow, whatever he may have been, and whatever the views held on the\nsubject by Andre-Louis, M. de La Tour d'Azyr was certainly not a coward.\nTo say that he was hiding in Nantes was not true. He came and went\nthere openly and unabashed. It happened, however, that the Nantais were\nignorant until this moment of his presence among them. But then he\nwould have disdained to have informed them of it just as he would have\ndisdained to have concealed it from them.\n\nChallenged thus, however, and despite the ominous manner in which the\nbourgeois element in the audience had responded to Scaramouche's appeal\nto its passions, despite the attempts made by Chabrillane to restrain\nhim, the Marquis swept aside the curtain at the side of the box, and\nsuddenly showed himself, pale but self-contained and scornful as he\nsurveyed first the daring Scaramouche and then those others who at sight\nof him had given tongue to their hostility.\n\nHoots and yells assailed him, fists were shaken at him, canes were\nbrandished menacingly.\n\n\"Assassin! Scoundrel! Coward! Traitor!\"\n\nBut he braved the storm, smiling upon them his ineffable contempt. He\nwas waiting for the noise to cease; waiting to address them in his turn.\nBut he waited in vain, as he very soon perceived.\n\nThe contempt he did not trouble to dissemble served but to goad them on.\n\nIn the pit pandemonium was already raging. Blows were being freely\nexchanged; there were scuffling groups, and here and there swords were\nbeing drawn, but fortunately the press was too dense to permit of their\nbeing used effectively. Those who had women with them and the timid by\nnature were making haste to leave a house that looked like becoming a\ncockpit, where chairs were being smashed to provide weapons, and parts\nof chandeliers were already being used as missiles.\n\nOne of these hurled by the hand of a gentleman in one of the boxes\nnarrowly missed Scaramouche where he stood, looking down in a sort of\ngrim triumph upon the havoc which his words had wrought. Knowing of\nwhat inflammable material the audience was composed, he had deliberately\nflung down amongst them the lighted torch of discord, to produce this\nconflagration.\n\nHe saw men falling quickly into groups representative of one side or the\nother of this great quarrel that already was beginning to agitate the\nwhole of France. Their rallying cries were ringing through the theatre.\n\n\"Down with the canaille!\" from some.\n\n\"Down with the privileged!\" from others.\n\nAnd then above the general din one cry rang out sharply and insistently:\n\n\"To the box! Death to the butcher of Rennes! Death to La Tour d'Azyr who\nmakes war upon the people!\"\n\nThere was a rush for one of the doors of the pit that opened upon the\nstaircase leading to the boxes.\n\nAnd now, whilst battle and confusion spread with the speed of fire,\noverflowing from the theatre into the street itself, La Tour d'Azyr's\nbox, which had become the main object of the attack of the bourgeoisie,\nhad also become the rallying ground for such gentlemen as were present\nin the theatre and for those who, without being men of birth themselves,\nwere nevertheless attached to the party of the nobles.\n\nLa Tour d'Azyr had quitted the front of the box to meet those who came\nto join him. And now in the pit one group of infuriated gentlemen, in\nattempting to reach the stage across the empty orchestra, so that they\nmight deal with the audacious comedian who was responsible for this\nexplosion, found themselves opposed and held back by another group\ncomposed of men to whose feelings Andre-Louis had given expression.\n\nPerceiving this, and remembering the chandelier, he turned to Leandre,\nwho had remained beside him.\n\n\"I think it is time to be going,\" said he.\n\nLeandre, looking ghastly under his paint, appalled by the storm which\nexceeded by far anything that his unimaginative brain could have\nconjectured, gurgled an inarticulate agreement. But it looked as if\nalready they were too late, for in that moment they were assailed from\nbehind.\n\nM. Binet had succeeded at last in breaking past Polichinelle and\nRhodomont, who in view of his murderous rage had been endeavouring to\nrestrain him. Half a dozen gentlemen, habitues of the green-room, had\ncome round to the stage to disembowel the knave who had created this\nriot, and it was they who had flung aside those two comedians who hung\nupon Binet. After him they came now, their swords out; but after them\nagain came Polichinelle, Rhodomont, Harlequin, Pierrot, Pasquariel,\nand Basque the artist, armed with such implements as they could hastily\nsnatch up, and intent upon saving the man with whom they sympathized in\nspite of all, and in whom now all their hopes were centred.\n\nWell ahead rolled Binet, moving faster than any had ever seen him move,\nand swinging the long cane from which Pantaloon is inseparable.\n\n\"Infamous scoundrel!\" he roared. \"You have ruined me! But, name of a\nname, you shall pay!\"\n\nAndre-Louis turned to face him. \"You confuse cause with effect,\" said\nhe. But he got no farther... Binet's cane, viciously driven, descended\nand broke upon his shoulder. Had he not moved swiftly aside as the blow\nfell it must have taken him across the head, and possibly stunned him.\nAs he moved, he dropped his hand to his pocket, and swift upon the\ncracking of Binet's breaking cane came the crack of the pistol with\nwhich Andre-Louis replied.\n\n\"You had your warning, you filthy pander!\" he cried. And on the word he\nshot him through the body.\n\nBinet went down screaming, whilst the fierce Polichinelle, fiercer than\never in that moment of fierce reality, spoke quickly into Andre-Louis'\near:\n\n\"Fool! So much was not necessary! Away with you now, or you'll leave\nyour skin here! Away with you!\"\n\nAndre-Louis thought it good advice, and took it. The gentlemen who had\nfollowed Binet in that punitive rush upon the stage, partly held in\ncheck by the improvised weapons of the players, partly intimidated by\nthe second pistol that Scaramouche presented, let him go. He gained\nthe wings, and here found himself faced by a couple of sergeants of the\nwatch, part of the police that was already invading the theatre with a\nview to restoring order. The sight of them reminded him unpleasantly\nof how he must stand towards the law for this night's work, and more\nparticularly for that bullet lodged somewhere in Binet's obese body. He\nflourished his pistol.\n\n\"Make way, or I'll burn your brains!\" he threatened them, and\nintimidated, themselves without firearms, they fell back and let him\npass. He slipped by the door of the green-room, where the ladies of the\ncompany had shut themselves in until the storm should be over, and so\ngained the street behind the theatre. It was deserted. Down this he went\nat a run, intent on reaching the inn for clothes and money, since it was\nimpossible that he should take the road in the garb of Scaramouche.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III: THE SWORD\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. TRANSITION\n\n\"You may agree,\" wrote Andre-Louis from Paris to Le Chapelier, in a\nletter which survives, \"that it is to be regretted I should definitely\nhave discarded the livery of Scaramouche, since clearly there could be\nno livery fitter for my wear. It seems to be my part always to stir up\nstrife and then to slip away before I am caught in the crash of the\nwarring elements I have aroused. It is a humiliating reflection. I seek\nconsolation in the reminder of Epictetus (do you ever read Epictetus?)\nthat we are but actors in a play of such a part as it may please the\nDirector to assign us. It does not, however, console me to have been\ncast for a part so contemptible, to find myself excelling ever in the\nart of running away. But if I am not brave, at least I am prudent; so\nthat where I lack one virtue I may lay claim to possessing another\nalmost to excess. On a previous occasion they wanted to hang me for\nsedition. Should I have stayed to be hanged? This time they may want to\nhang me for several things, including murder; for I do not know whether\nthat scoundrel Binet be alive or dead from the dose of lead I pumped\ninto his fat paunch. Nor can I say that I very greatly care. If I have a\nhope at all in the matter it is that he is dead--and damned. But I am\nreally indifferent. My own concerns are troubling me enough. I have all\nbut spent the little money that I contrived to conceal about me before I\nfled from Nantes on that dreadful night; and both of the only two\nprofessions of which I can claim to know anything--the law and the\nstage--are closed to me, since I cannot find employment in either without\nrevealing myself as a fellow who is urgently wanted by the hangman. As\nthings are it is very possible that I may die of hunger, especially\nconsidering the present price of victuals in this ravenous city. Again I\nhave recourse to Epictetus for comfort. 'It is better,' he says, 'to die\nof hunger having lived without grief and fear, than to live with a\ntroubled spirit amid abundance.' I seem likely to perish in the estate\nthat he accounts so enviable. That it does not seem exactly enviable to\nme merely proves that as a Stoic I am not a success.\"\n\nThere is also another letter of his written at about the same time\nto the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr--a letter since published by M. Emile\nQuersac in his \"Undercurrents of the Revolution in Brittany,\" unearthed\nby him from the archives of Rennes, to which it had been consigned by\nM. de Lesdiguieres, who had received it for justiciary purposes from the\nMarquis.\n\n\"The Paris newspapers,\" he writes in this, \"which have reported in\nconsiderable detail the fracas at the Theatre Feydau and disclosed the\ntrue identity of the Scaramouche who provoked it, inform me also that\nyou have escaped the fate I had intended for you when I raised that\nstorm of public opinion and public indignation. I would not have you\ntake satisfaction in the thought that I regret your escape. I do not. I\nrejoice in it. To deal justice by death has this disadvantage that the\nvictim has no knowledge that justice has overtaken him. Had you died,\nhad you been torn limb from limb that night, I should now repine in the\nthought of your eternal and untroubled slumber. Not in euthanasia, but\nin torment of mind should the guilty atone. You see, I am not sure that\nhell hereafter is a certainty, whilst I am quite sure that it can be a\ncertainty in this life; and I desire you to continue to live yet awhile\nthat you may taste something of its bitterness.\n\n\"You murdered Philippe de Vilmorin because you feared what you described\nas his very dangerous gift of eloquence, I took an oath that day that\nyour evil deed should be fruitless; that I would render it so; that the\nvoice you had done murder to stifle should in spite of that ring like\na trumpet through the land. That was my conception of revenge. Do you\nrealize how I have been fulfilling it, how I shall continue to fulfil\nit as occasion offers? In the speech with which I fired the people of\nRennes on the very morrow of that deed, did you not hear the voice of\nPhilippe de Vilmorin uttering the ideas that were his with a fire and a\npassion greater than he could have commanded because Nemesis lent me\nher inflaming aid? In the voice of Omnes Omnibus at Nantes my voice\nagain--demanding the petition that sounded the knell of your hopes of\ncoercing the Third Estate, did you not hear again the voice of Philippe\nde Vilmorin? Did you not reflect that it was the mind of the man you had\nmurdered, resurrected in me his surviving friend, which made necessary\nyour futile attempt under arms last January, wherein your order, finally\nbeaten, was driven to seek sanctuary in the Cordelier Convent? And\nthat night when from the stage of the Feydau you were denounced to the\npeople, did you not hear yet again, in the voice of Scaramouche, the\nvoice of Philippe de Vilmorin, using that dangerous gift of eloquence\nwhich you so foolishly imagined you could silence with a sword-thrust?\nIt is becoming a persecution--is it not?--this voice from the grave that\ninsists upon making itself heard, that will not rest until you have been\ncast into the pit. You will be regretting by now that you did not kill\nme too, as I invited you on that occasion. I can picture to myself\nthe bitterness of this regret, and I contemplate it with satisfaction.\nRegret of neglected opportunity is the worst hell that a living soul can\ninhabit, particularly such a soul as yours. It is because of this that\nI am glad to know that you survived the riot at the Feydau, although at\nthe time it was no part of my intention that you should. Because of this\nI am content that you should live to enrage and suffer in the shadow of\nyour evil deed, knowing at last--since you had not hitherto the wit to\ndiscern it for yourself--that the voice of Philippe de Vilmorin will\nfollow you to denounce you ever more loudly, ever more insistently,\nuntil having lived in dread you shall go down in blood under the just\nrage which your victim's dangerous gift of eloquence is kindling against\nyou.\"\n\nI find it odd that he should have omitted from this letter all mention\nof Mlle. Binet, and I am disposed to account it at least a partial\ninsincerity that he should have assigned entirely to his self-imposed\nmission, and not at all to his lacerated feelings in the matter of\nClimene, the action which he had taken at the Feydau.\n\nThose two letters, both written in April of that year 1789, had for only\nimmediate effect to increase the activity with which Andre-Louis Moreau\nwas being sought.\n\nLe Chapelier would have found him so as to lend him assistance, to\nurge upon him once again that he should take up a political career. The\nelectors of Nantes would have found him--at least, they would have\nfound Omnes Omnibus, of whose identity with himself they were still in\nignorance--on each of the several occasions when a vacancy occurred in\ntheir body. And the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr and M. de Lesdiguieres\nwould have found him that they might send him to the gallows.\n\nWith a purpose no less vindictive was he being sought by M. Binet, now\nunhappily recovered from his wound to face completest ruin. His troupe\nhad deserted him during his illness, and reconstituted under the\ndirection of Polichinelle it was now striving with tolerable success to\ncontinue upon the lines which Andre-Louis had laid down. M. le Marquis,\nprevented by the riot from expressing in person to Mlle. Binet his\npurpose of making an end of their relations, had been constrained to\nwrite to her to that effect from Azyr a few days later. He tempered the\nblow by enclosing in discharge of all liabilities a bill on the Caisse\nd'Escompte for a hundred louis. Nevertheless it almost crushed the\nunfortunate and it enabled her father when he recovered to enrage her\nby pointing out that she owed this turn of events to the premature\nsurrender she had made in defiance of his sound worldly advice. Father\nand daughter alike were left to assign the Marquis' desertion, naturally\nenough, to the riot at the Feydau. They laid that with the rest to the\naccount of Scaramouche, and were forced in bitterness to admit that the\nscoundrel had taken a superlative revenge. Climene may even have come\nto consider that it would have paid her better to have run a straight\ncourse with Scaramouche and by marrying him to have trusted to his\nundoubted talents to place her on the summit to which her ambition\nurged her, and to which it was now futile for her to aspire. If so, that\nreflection must have been her sufficient punishment. For, as Andre-Louis\nso truly says, there is no worse hell than that provided by the regrets\nfor wasted opportunities.\n\nMeanwhile the fiercely sought Andre-Louis Moreau had gone to earth\ncompletely for the present. And the brisk police of Paris, urged on by\nthe King's Lieutenant from Rennes, hunted for him in vain. Yet he might\nhave been found in a house in the Rue du Hasard within a stone's throw\nof the Palais Royal, whither purest chance had conducted him.\n\nThat which in his letter to Le Chapelier he represents as a contingency\nof the near future was, in fact, the case in which already he found\nhimself. He was destitute. His money was exhausted, including that\nprocured by the sale of such articles of adornment as were not of\nabsolute necessity.\n\nSo desperate was his case that strolling one gusty April morning down\nthe Rue du Hasard with his nose in the wind looking for what might be\npicked up, he stopped to read a notice outside the door of a house on\nthe left side of the street as you approach the Rue de Richelieu. There\nwas no reason why he should have gone down the Rue du Hasard. Perhaps\nits name attracted him, as appropriate to his case.\n\nThe notice written in a big round hand announced that a young man of\ngood address with some knowledge of swordsmanship was required by M.\nBertrand des Amis on the second floor. Above this notice was a black\noblong board, and on this a shield, which in vulgar terms may be\ndescribed as red charged with two swords crossed and four fleurs de lys,\none in each angle of the saltire. Under the shield, in letters of gold,\nran the legend:\n\n\n                     BERTRAND DES AMIS\n\n        Maitre en fait d'Armes des Academies du Roi\n\nAndre-Louis stood considering. He could claim, he thought, to possess\nthe qualifications demanded. He was certainly young and he believed of\ntolerable address, whilst the fencing-lessons he had received in Nantes\nhad given him at least an elementary knowledge of swordsmanship. The\nnotice looked as if it had been pinned there some days ago, suggesting\nthat applicants for the post were not very numerous. In that case\nperhaps M. Bertrand des Amis would not be too exigent. And anyway,\nAndre-Louis had not eaten for four-and-twenty hours, and whilst the\nemployment here offered--the precise nature of which he was yet to\nascertain--did not appear to be such as Andre-Louis would deliberately\nhave chosen, he was in no case now to be fastidious.\n\nThen, too, he liked the name of Bertrand des Amis. It felicitously\ncombined suggestions of chivalry and friendliness. Also the man's\nprofession being of a kind that is flavoured with romance it was\npossible that M. Bertrand des Amis would not ask too many questions.\n\nIn the end he climbed to the second floor. On the landing he paused\noutside a door, on which was written \"Academy of M. Bertrand des\nAmis.\" He pushed this open, and found himself in a sparsely furnished,\nuntenanted antechamber. From a room beyond, the door of which was\nclosed, came the stamping of feet, the click and slither of steel upon\nsteel, and dominating these sounds a vibrant sonorous voice speaking a\nlanguage that was certainly French; but such French as is never heard\noutside a fencing-school.\n\n\"Coulez! Mais, coulez donc!.... So! Now the flanconnade--en carte.... And\nhere is the riposte.... Let us begin again. Come! The ward of fierce....\nMake the coupe, and then the quinte par dessus les armes.... O, mais\nallongez! Allongez! Allez au fond!\" the voice cried in expostulation.\n\"Come, that was better.\" The blades ceased.\n\n\"Remember: the hand in pronation, the elbow not too far out. That will\ndo for to-day. On Wednesday we shall see you tirer au mur. It is more\ndeliberate. Speed will follow when the mechanism of the movements is\nmore assured.\"\n\nAnother voice murmured in answer. The steps moved aside. The lesson was\nat an end. Andre-Louis tapped on the door.\n\nIt was opened by a tall, slender, gracefully proportioned man of perhaps\nforty. Black silk breeches and stockings ending in light shoes clothed\nhim from the waist down. Above he was encased to the chin in a closely\nfitting plastron of leather, His face was aquiline and swarthy, his eyes\nfull and dark, his mouth firm and his clubbed hair was of a lustrous\nblack with here and there a thread of silver showing.\n\nIn the crook of his left arm he carried a fencing-mask, a thing of\nleather with a wire grating to protect the eyes. His keen glance played\nover Andre-Louis from head to foot.\n\n\"Monsieur?\" he inquired, politely.\n\nIt was clear that he mistook Andre-Louis' quality, which is not\nsurprising, for despite his sadly reduced fortunes, his exterior was\nirreproachable, and M. des Amis was not to guess that he carried upon\nhis back the whole of his possessions.\n\n\"You have a notice below, monsieur,\" he said, and from the swift\nlighting of the fencing-master's eyes he saw that he had been correct\nin his assumption that applicants for the position had not been jostling\none another on his threshold. And then that flash of satisfaction was\nfollowed by a look of surprise.\n\n\"You are come in regard to that?\"\n\nAndre-Louis shrugged and half smiled. \"One must live,\" said he.\n\n\"But come in. Sit down there. I shall be at your.... I shall be free to\nattend to you in a moment.\"\n\nAndre-Louis took a seat on the bench ranged against one of the\nwhitewashed walls. The room was long and low, its floor entirely bare.\nPlain wooden forms such as that which he occupied were placed here and\nthere against the wall. These last were plastered with fencing trophies,\nmasks, crossed foils, stuffed plastrons, and a variety of swords,\ndaggers, and targets, belonging to a variety of ages and countries.\nThere was also a portrait of an obese, big-nosed gentleman in an\nelaborately curled wig, wearing the blue ribbon of the Saint Esprit,\nin whom Andre-Louis recognized the King. And there was a framed\nparchment--M. des Amis' certificate from the King's Academy. A bookcase\noccupied one corner, and near this, facing the last of the four windows\nthat abundantly lighted the long room, there was a small writing-table\nand an armchair. A plump and beautifully dressed young gentleman stood\nby this table in the act of resuming coat and wig. M. des Amis sauntered\nover to him--moving, thought Andre-Louis, with extraordinary grace and\nelasticity--and stood in talk with him whilst also assisting him to\ncomplete his toilet.\n\nAt last the young gentleman took his departure, mopping himself with\na fine kerchief that left a trail of perfume on the air. M. des Amis\nclosed the door, and turned to the applicant, who rose at once.\n\n\"Where have you studied?\" quoth the fencing-master abruptly.\n\n\"Studied?\" Andre-Louis was taken aback by the question. \"Oh, at Louis Le\nGrand.\"\n\nM. des Amis frowned, looking up sharply as if to see whether his\napplicant was taking the liberty of amusing himself.\n\n\"In Heaven's name! I am not asking you where you did your humanities,\nbut in what academy you studied fencing.\"\n\n\"Oh--fencing!\" It had hardly ever occurred to Andre-Louis that the sword\nranked seriously as a study. \"I never studied it very much. I had some\nlessons in... in the country once.\"\n\nThe master's eyebrows went up. \"But then?\" he cried. \"Why trouble to\ncome up two flights of stairs?\" He was impatient.\n\n\"The notice does not demand a high degree of proficiency. If I am not\nproficient enough, yet knowing the rudiments I can easily improve. I\nlearn most things readily,\" Andre-Louis commended himself. \"For the\nrest: I possess the other qualifications. I am young, as you observe:\nand I leave you to judge whether I am wrong in assuming that my address\nis good. I am by profession a man of the robe, though I realize that the\nmotto here is cedat toga armis.\"\n\nM. des Amis smiled approvingly. Undoubtedly the young man had a good\naddress, and a certain readiness of wit, it would appear. He ran a\ncritical eye over his physical points. \"What is your name?\" he asked.\n\nAndre-Louis hesitated a moment. \"Andre-Louis,\" he said.\n\nThe dark, keen eyes conned him more searchingly.\n\n\"Well? Andre-Louis what?\"\n\n\"Just Andre-Louis. Louis is my surname.\"\n\n\"Oh! An odd surname. You come from Brittany by your accent. Why did you\nleave it?\"\n\n\"To save my skin,\" he answered, without reflecting. And then made haste\nto cover the blunder. \"I have an enemy,\" he explained.\n\nM. des Amis frowned, stroking his square chin. \"You ran away?\"\n\n\"You may say so.\n\n\"A coward, eh?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\" And then he lied romantically. Surely a man who\nlived by the sword should have a weakness for the romantic. \"You see, my\nenemy is a swordsman of great strength--the best blade in the province,\nif not the best blade in France. That is his repute. I thought I would\ncome to Paris to learn something of the art, and then go back and kill\nhim. That, to be frank, is why your notice attracted me. You see, I have\nnot the means to take lessons otherwise. I thought to find work here in\nthe law. But I have failed. There are too many lawyers in Paris as it\nis, and whilst waiting I have consumed the little money that I had, so\nthat... so that, enfin, your notice seemed to me something to which a\nspecial providence had directed me.\"\n\nM. des Amis gripped him by the shoulders, and looked into his face.\n\n\"Is this true, my friend?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not a word of it,\" said Andre-Louis, wrecking his chances on an\nirresistible impulse to say the unexpected. But he didn't wreck them.\nM. des Amis burst into laughter; and having laughed his fill, confessed\nhimself charmed by his applicant's fundamental honesty.\n\n\"Take off your coat,\" he said, \"and let us see what you can do. Nature,\nat least, designed you for a swordsman. You are light, active, and\nsupple, with a good length of arm, and you seem intelligent. I may make\nsomething of you, teach you enough for my purpose, which is that you\nshould give the elements of the art to new pupils before I take them in\nhand to finish them. Let us try. Take that mask and foil, and come over\nhere.\"\n\nHe led him to the end of the room, where the bare floor was scored with\nlines of chalk to guide the beginner in the management of his feet.\n\nAt the end of a ten minutes' bout, M. des Amis offered him the\nsituation, and explained it. In addition to imparting the rudiments\nof the art to beginners, he was to brush out the fencing-room every\nmorning, keep the foils furbished, assist the gentlemen who came for\nlessons to dress and undress, and make himself generally useful. His\nwages for the present were to be forty livres a month, and he might\nsleep in an alcove behind the fencing-room if he had no other lodging.\n\nThe position, you see, had its humiliations. But, if Andre-Louis would\nhope to dine, he must begin by eating his pride as an hors d'oeuvre.\n\n\"And so,\" he said, controlling a grimace, \"the robe yields not only to\nthe sword, but to the broom as well. Be it so. I stay.\"\n\nIt is characteristic of him that, having made that choice, he should\nhave thrown himself into the work with enthusiasm. It was ever his way\nto do whatever he did with all the resources of his mind and energies\nof his body. When he was not instructing very young gentlemen in\nthe elements of the art, showing them the elaborate and intricate\nsalute--which with a few days' hard practice he had mastered to\nperfection--and the eight guards, he was himself hard at work on those\nsame guards, exercising eye, wrist, and knees.\n\nPerceiving his enthusiasm, and seeing the obvious possibilities it\nopened out of turning him into a really effective assistant, M. des Amis\npresently took him more seriously in hand.\n\n\"Your application and zeal, my friend, are deserving of more than forty\nlivres a month,\" the master informed him at the end of a week. \"For\nthe present, however, I will make up what else I consider due to you by\nimparting to you secrets of this noble art. Your future depends upon\nhow you profit by your exceptional good fortune in receiving instruction\nfrom me.\"\n\nThereafter every morning before the opening of the academy, the master\nwould fence for half an hour with his new assistant. Under this really\nexcellent tuition Andre-Louis improved at a rate that both astounded\nand flattered M. des Amis. He would have been less flattered and more\nastounded had he known that at least half the secret of Andre-Louis'\namazing progress lay in the fact that he was devouring the contents of\nthe master's library, which was made up of a dozen or so treatises on\nfencing by such great masters as La Bessiere, Danet, and the syndic\nof the King's Academy, Augustin Rousseau. To M. des Amis, whose\nswordsmanship was all based on practice and not at all on theory, who\nwas indeed no theorist or student in any sense, that little library\nwas merely a suitable adjunct to a fencing-academy, a proper piece of\ndecorative furniture. The books themselves meant nothing to him in any\nother sense. He had not the type of mind that could have read them with\nprofit nor could he understand that another should do so. Andre-Louis,\non the contrary, a man with the habit of study, with the acquired\nfaculty of learning from books, read those works with enormous profit,\nkept their precepts in mind, critically set off those of one master\nagainst those of another, and made for himself a choice which he\nproceeded to put into practice.\n\nAt the end of a month it suddenly dawned upon M. des Amis that his\nassistant had developed into a fencer of very considerable force, a man\nin a bout with whom it became necessary to exert himself if he were to\nescape defeat.\n\n\"I said from the first,\" he told him one day, \"that Nature designed you\nfor a swordsman. See how justified I was, and see also how well I have\nknown how to mould the material with which Nature has equipped you.\"\n\n\"To the master be the glory,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\nHis relations with M. des Amis had meanwhile become of the friendliest,\nand he was now beginning to receive from him other pupils than mere\nbeginners. In fact Andre-Louis was becoming an assistant in a much\nfuller sense of the word. M. des Amis, a chivalrous, open-handed fellow,\nfar from taking advantage of what he had guessed to be the young man's\ndifficulties, rewarded his zeal by increasing his wages to four louis a\nmonth.\n\nFrom the earnest and thoughtful study of the theories of others, it\nfollowed now--as not uncommonly happens--that Andre-Louis came to develop\ntheories of his own. He lay one June morning on his little truckle bed\nin the alcove behind the academy, considering a passage that he had read\nlast night in Danet on double and triple feints. It had seemed to him\nwhen reading it that Danet had stopped short on the threshold of a great\ndiscovery in the art of fencing. Essentially a theorist, Andre-Louis\nperceived the theory suggested, which Danet himself in suggesting it\nhad not perceived. He lay now on his back, surveying the cracks in the\nceiling and considering this matter further with the lucidity that early\nmorning often brings to an acute intelligence. You are to remember that\nfor close upon two months now the sword had been Andre-Louis' daily\nexercise and almost hourly thought. Protracted concentration upon\nthe subject was giving him an extraordinary penetration of vision.\nSwordsmanship as he learnt and taught and saw it daily practised\nconsisted of a series of attacks and parries, a series of disengages\nfrom one line into another. But always a limited series. A half-dozen\ndisengages on either side was, strictly speaking, usually as far as any\nengagement went. Then one recommenced. But even so, these disengages\nwere fortuitous. What if from first to last they should be calculated?\n\nThat was part of the thought--one of the two legs on which his theory was\nto stand; the other was: what would happen if one so elaborated Danet's\nideas on the triple feint as to merge them into a series of actual\ncalculated disengages to culminate at the fourth or fifth or even sixth\ndisengage? That is to say, if one were to make a series of attacks\ninviting ripostes again to be countered, each of which was not intended\nto go home, but simply to play the opponent's blade into a line that\nmust open him ultimately, and as predetermined, for an irresistible\nlunge. Each counter of the opponent's would have to be preconsidered in\nthis widening of his guard, a widening so gradual that he should himself\nbe unconscious of it, and throughout intent upon getting home his own\npoint on one of those counters.\n\nAndre-Louis had been in his time a chess-player of some force, and at\nchess he had excelled by virtue of his capacity for thinking ahead. That\nvirtue applied to fencing should all but revolutionize the art. It\nwas so applied already, of course, but only in an elementary and very\nlimited fashion, in mere feints, single, double, or triple. But even the\ntriple feint should be a clumsy device compared with this method upon\nwhich he theorized.\n\nHe considered further, and the conviction grew that he held the key of a\ndiscovery. He was impatient to put his theory to the test.\n\nThat morning he was given a pupil of some force, against whom usually\nhe was hard put to it to defend himself. Coming on guard, he made up his\nmind to hit him on the fourth disengage, predetermining the four passes\nthat should lead up to it. They engaged in tierce, and Andre-Louis\nled the attack by a beat and a straightening of the arm. Came the\ndemi-contre he expected, which he promptly countered by a thrust in\nquinte; this being countered again, he reentered still lower, and being\nagain correctly parried, as he had calculated, he lunged swirling his\npoint into carte, and got home full upon his opponent's breast. The ease\nof it surprised him.\n\nThey began again. This time he resolved to go in on the fifth disengage,\nand in on that he went with the same ease. Then, complicating the matter\nfurther, he decided to try the sixth, and worked out in his mind the\ncombination of the five preliminary engages. Yet again he succeeded as\neasily as before.\n\nThe young gentleman opposed to him laughed with just a tinge of\nmortification in his voice.\n\n\"I am all to pieces this morning,\" he said.\n\n\"You are not of your usual force,\" Andre-Louis politely agreed. And then\ngreatly daring, always to test that theory of his to the uttermost: \"So\nmuch so,\" he added, \"that I could almost be sure of hitting you as and\nwhen I declare.\"\n\nThe capable pupil looked at him with a half-sneer. \"Ah, that, no,\" said\nhe.\n\n\"Let us try. On the fourth disengage I shall touch you. Allons! En\ngarde!\"\n\nAnd as he promised, so it happened.\n\nThe young gentleman who, hitherto, had held no great opinion of\nAndre-Louis' swordsmanship, accounting him well enough for purposes of\npractice when the master was otherwise engaged, opened wide his eyes. In\na burst of mingled generosity and intoxication, Andre-Louis was almost\nfor disclosing his method--a method which a little later was to become a\ncommonplace of the fencing-rooms. Betimes he checked himself. To reveal\nhis secret would be to destroy the prestige that must accrue to him from\nexercising it.\n\nAt noon, the academy being empty, M. des Amis called Andre-Louis to one\nof the occasional lessons which he still received. And for the first\ntime in all his experience with Andre-Louis, M. des Amis received\nfrom him a full hit in the course of the first bout. He laughed, well\npleased, like the generous fellow he was.\n\n\"Aha! You are improving very fast, my friend.\" He still laughed, though\nnot so well pleased, when he was hit in the second bout. After that he\nsettled down to fight in earnest with the result that Andre-Louis\nwas hit three times in succession. The speed and accuracy of the\nfencing-master when fully exerting himself disconcerted Andre-Louis'\ntheory, which for want of being exercised in practice still demanded too\nmuch consideration.\n\nBut that his theory was sound he accounted fully established, and with\nthat, for the moment, he was content. It remained only to perfect by\npractice the application of it. To this he now devoted himself with\nthe passionate enthusiasm of the discoverer. He confined himself to a\nhalf-dozen combinations, which he practised assiduously until each had\nbecome almost automatic. And he proved their infallibility upon the best\namong M. des Amis' pupils.\n\nFinally, a week or so after that last bout of his with des Amis, the\nmaster called him once more to practice.\n\nHit again in the first bout, the master set himself to exert all his\nskill against his assistant. But to-day it availed him nothing before\nAndre-Louis' impetuous attacks.\n\nAfter the third hit, M. des Amis stepped back and pulled off his mask.\n\n\"What's this?\" he asked. He was pale, and his dark brows were contracted\nin a frown. Not in years had he been so wounded in his self-love. \"Have\nyou been taught a secret botte?\"\n\nHe had always boasted that he knew too much about the sword to believe\nany nonsense about secret bottes; but this performance of Andre-Louis'\nhad shaken his convictions on that score.\n\n\"No,\" said Andre-Louis. \"I have been working hard; and it happens that I\nfence with my brains.\"\n\n\"So I perceive. Well, well, I think I have taught you enough, my friend.\nI have no intention of having an assistant who is superior to myself.\"\n\n\"Little danger of that,\" said Andre-Louis, smiling pleasantly. \"You have\nbeen fencing hard all morning, and you are tired, whilst I, having\ndone little, am entirely fresh. That is the only secret of my momentary\nsuccess.\"\n\nHis tact and the fundamental good-nature of M. des Amis prevented the\nmatter from going farther along the road it was almost threatening\nto take. And thereafter, when they fenced together, Andre-Louis, who\ncontinued daily to perfect his theory into an almost infallible system,\nsaw to it that M. des Amis always scored against him at least two hits\nfor every one of his own. So much he would grant to discretion, but no\nmore. He desired that M. des Amis should be conscious of his strength,\nwithout, however, discovering so much of its real extent as would have\nexcited in him an unnecessary degree of jealousy.\n\nAnd so well did he contrive that whilst he became ever of greater\nassistance to the master--for his style and general fencing, too, had\nmaterially improved--he was also a source of pride to him as the most\nbrilliant of all the pupils that had ever passed through his academy.\nNever did Andre-Louis disillusion him by revealing the fact that his\nskill was due far more to M. des Amis' library and his own mother wit\nthan to any lessons received.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. QUOS DEUS VULT PERDERE\n\nOnce again, precisely as he had done when he joined the Binet troupe,\ndid Andre-Louis now settle down whole-heartedly to the new profession\ninto which necessity had driven him, and in which he found effective\nconcealment from those who might seek him to his hurt. This profession\nmight--although in fact it did not--have brought him to consider himself\nat last as a man of action. He had not, however, on that account ceased\nto be a man of thought, and the events of the spring and summer months\nof that year 1789 in Paris provided him with abundant matter for\nreflection. He read there in the raw what is perhaps the most amazing\npage in the history of human development, and in the end he was forced\nto the conclusion that all his early preconceptions had been at fault,\nand that it was such exalted, passionate enthusiasts as Vilmorin who had\nbeen right.\n\nI suspect him of actually taking pride in the fact that he had been\nmistaken, complacently attributing his error to the circumstance that he\nhad been, himself, of too sane and logical a mind to gauge the depths of\nhuman insanity now revealed.\n\nHe watched the growth of hunger, the increasing poverty and distress of\nParis during that spring, and assigned it to its proper cause, together\nwith the patience with which the people bore it. The world of France was\nin a state of hushed, of paralyzed expectancy, waiting for the States\nGeneral to assemble and for centuries of tyranny to end. And because of\nthis expectancy, industry had come to a standstill, the stream of trade\nhad dwindled to a trickle. Men would not buy or sell until they clearly\nsaw the means by which the genius of the Swiss banker, M. Necker, was to\ndeliver them from this morass. And because of this paralysis of affairs\nthe men of the people were thrown out of work and left to starve with\ntheir wives and children.\n\nLooking on, Andre-Louis smiled grimly. So far he was right. The\nsufferers were ever the proletariat. The men who sought to make\nthis revolution, the electors--here in Paris as elsewhere--were men\nof substance, notable bourgeois, wealthy traders. And whilst these,\ndespising the canaille, and envying the privileged, talked largely of\nequality--by which they meant an ascending equality that should confuse\nthemselves with the gentry--the proletariat perished of want in its\nkennels.\n\nAt last with the month of May the deputies arrived, Andre-Louis'\nfriend Le Chapelier prominent amongst them, and the States General were\ninaugurated at Versailles. It was then that affairs began to become\ninteresting, then that Andre-Louis began seriously to doubt the\nsoundness of the views he had held hitherto.\n\nWhen the royal proclamation had gone forth decreeing that the deputies\nof the Third Estate should number twice as many as those of the other\ntwo orders together, Andre-Louis had believed that the preponderance of\nvotes thus assured to the Third Estate rendered inevitable the reforms\nto which they had pledged themselves.\n\nBut he had reckoned without the power of the privileged orders over\nthe proud Austrian queen, and her power over the obese, phlegmatic,\nirresolute monarch. That the privileged orders should deliver battle\nin defence of their privileges, Andre-Louis could understand. Man being\nwhat he is, and labouring under his curse of acquisitiveness, will never\nwillingly surrender possessions, whether they be justly or unjustly\nheld. But what surprised Andre-Louis was the unutterable crassness of\nthe methods by which the Privileged ranged themselves for battle. They\nopposed brute force to reason and philosophy, and battalions of foreign\nmercenaries to ideas. As if ideas were to be impaled on bayonets!\n\nThe war between the Privileged and the Court on one side, and the\nAssembly and the People on the other had begun.\n\nThe Third Estate contained itself, and waited; waited with the patience\nof nature; waited a month whilst, with the paralysis of business now\ncomplete, the skeleton hand of famine took a firmer grip of Paris;\nwaited a month whilst Privilege gradually assembled an army in\nVersailles to intimidate it--an army of fifteen regiments, nine of\nwhich were Swiss and German--and mounted a park of artillery before\nthe building in which the deputies sat. But the deputies refused to be\nintimidated; they refused to see the guns and foreign uniforms; they\nrefused to see anything but the purpose for which they had been brought\ntogether by royal proclamation.\n\nThus until the 10th of June, when that great thinker and metaphysician,\nthe Abbe Sieyes, gave the signal: \"It is time,\" said he, \"to cut the\ncable.\"\n\nAnd the opportunity came soon, at the very beginning of July. M. du\nChatelet, a harsh, haughty disciplinarian, proposed to transfer the\neleven French Guards placed under arrest from the military gaol of the\nAbbaye to the filthy prison of Bicetre reserved for thieves and felons\nof the lowest order. Word of that intention going forth, the people at\nlast met violence with violence. A mob four thousand strong broke into\nthe Abbaye, and delivered thence not only the eleven guardsmen, but all\nthe other prisoners, with the exception of one whom they discovered to\nbe a thief, and whom they put back again.\n\nThat was open revolt at last, and with revolt Privilege knew how to\ndeal. It would strangle this mutinous Paris in the iron grip of the\nforeign regiments. Measures were quickly concerted. Old Marechal de\nBroglie, a veteran of the Seven Years' War, imbued with a soldier's\ncontempt for civilians, conceiving that the sight of a uniform would\nbe enough to restore peace and order, took control with Besenval as his\nsecond-in-command. The foreign regiments were stationed in the\nenvirons of Paris, regiments whose very names were an irritation to the\nParisians, regiments of Reisbach, of Diesbach, of Nassau, Esterhazy, and\nRoehmer. Reenforcements of Swiss were sent to the Bastille between whose\ncrenels already since the 30th of June were to be seen the menacing\nmouths of loaded cannon.\n\nOn the 10th of July the electors once more addressed the King to request\nthe withdrawal of the troops. They were answered next day that the\ntroops served the purpose of defending the liberties of the Assembly!\nAnd on the next day to that, which was a Sunday, the philanthropist Dr.\nGuillotin--whose philanthropic engine of painless death was before very\nlong to find a deal of work--came from the Assembly, of which he was a\nmember, to assure the electors of Paris that all was well, appearances\nnotwithstanding, since Necker was more firmly in the saddle than ever.\nHe did not know that at the very moment in which he was speaking so\nconfidently, the oft-dismissed and oft-recalled M. Necker had just been\ndismissed yet again by the hostile cabal about the Queen. Privilege\nwanted conclusive measures, and conclusive measures it would\nhave--conclusive to itself.\n\nAnd at the same time yet another philanthropist, also a doctor, one\nJean-Paul Mara, of Italian extraction--better known as Marat, the\ngallicized form of name he adopted--a man of letters, too, who had spent\nsome years in England, and there published several works on sociology,\nwas writing:\n\n\"Have a care! Consider what would be the fatal effect of a seditious\nmovement. If you should have the misfortune to give way to that, you\nwill be treated as people in revolt, and blood will flow.\"\n\nAndre-Louis was in the gardens of the Palais Royal, that place of shops\nand puppet-shows, of circus and cafes, of gaming houses and brothels,\nthat universal rendezvous, on that Sunday morning when the news of\nNecker's dismissal spread, carrying with it dismay and fury. Into\nNecker's dismissal the people read the triumph of the party hostile to\nthemselves. It sounded the knell of all hope of redress of their wrongs.\n\nHe beheld a slight young man with a pock-marked face, redeemed from\nutter ugliness by a pair of magnificent eyes, leap to a table outside\nthe Caf\u00e9 de Foy, a drawn sword in his hand, crying, \"To arms!\" And then\nupon the silence of astonishment that cry imposed, this young man\npoured a flood of inflammatory eloquence, delivered in a voice marred at\nmoments by a stutter. He told the people that the Germans on the Champ\nde Mars would enter Paris that night to butcher the inhabitants. \"Let\nus mount a cockade!\" he cried, and tore a leaf from a tree to serve his\npurpose--the green cockade of hope.\n\nEnthusiasm swept the crowd, a motley crowd made up of men and women of\nevery class, from vagabond to nobleman, from harlot to lady of fashion.\nTrees were despoiled of their leaves, and the green cockade was flaunted\nfrom almost every head.\n\n\"You are caught between two fires,\" the incendiary's stuttering voice\nraved on. \"Between the Germans on the Champ de Mars and the Swiss in the\nBastille. To arms, then! To arms!\"\n\nExcitement boiled up and over. From a neighbouring waxworks show came\nthe bust of Necker, and presently a bust of that comedian the Duke\nof Orleans, who had a party and who was as ready as any other of the\nbudding opportunists of those days to take advantage of the moment for\nhis own aggrandizement. The bust of Necker was draped with crepe.\n\nAndre-Louis looked on, and grew afraid. Marat's pamphlet had impressed\nhim. It had expressed what himself he had expressed more than half a\nyear ago to the mob at Rennes. This crowd, he felt must be restrained.\nThat hot-headed, irresponsible stutterer would have the town in a blaze\nby night unless something were done. The young man, a causeless advocate\nof the Palais named Camille Desmoulins, later to become famous, leapt\ndown from his table still waving his sword, still shouting, \"To arms!\nFollow me!\" Andre-Louis advanced to occupy the improvised rostrum, which\nthe stutterer had just vacated, to make an effort at counteracting that\ninflammatory performance. He thrust through the crowd, and came suddenly\nface to face with a tall man beautifully dressed, whose handsome\ncountenance was sternly set, whose great sombre eyes mouldered as if\nwith suppressed anger.\n\nThus face to face, each looking into the eyes of the other, they stood\nfor a long moment, the jostling crowd streaming past them, unheeded.\nThen Andre-Louis laughed.\n\n\"That fellow, too, has a very dangerous gift of eloquence, M. le\nMarquis,\" he said. \"In fact there are a number of such in France to-day.\nThey grow from the soil, which you and yours have irrigated with the\nblood of the martyrs of liberty. Soon it may be your blood instead. The\nsoil is parched, and thirsty for it.\"\n\n\"Gallows-bird!\" he was answered. \"The police will do your affair for\nyou. I shall tell the Lieutenant-General that you are to be found in\nParis.\"\n\n\"My God, man!\" cried Andre-Louis, \"will you never get sense? Will you\ntalk like that of Lieutenant-Generals when Paris itself is likely to\ntumble about your ears or take fire under your feet? Raise your voice,\nM. le Marquis. Denounce me here, to these. You will make a hero of me in\nsuch an hour as this. Or shall I denounce you? I think I will. I think\nit is high time you received your wages. Hi! You others, listen to me!\nLet me present you to...\"\n\nA rush of men hurtled against him, swept him along with them, do what he\nwould, separating him from M. de La Tour d'Azyr, so oddly met. He sought\nto breast that human torrent; the Marquis, caught in an eddy of it,\nremained where he had been, and Andre-Louis' last glimpse of him was of\na man smiling with tight lips, an ugly smile.\n\nMeanwhile the gardens were emptying in the wake of that stuttering\nfirebrand who had mounted the green cockade. The human torrent poured\nout into the Rue de Richelieu, and Andre-Louis perforce must suffer\nhimself to be borne along by it, at least as far as the Rue du Hasard.\nThere he sidled out of it, and having no wish to be crushed to death or\nto take further part in the madness that was afoot, he slipped down\nthe street, and so got home to the deserted academy. For there were no\npupils to-day, and even M. des Amis, like Andre-Louis, had gone out to\nseek for news of what was happening at Versailles.\n\nThis was no normal state of things at the Academy of Bertrand des Amis.\nWhatever else in Paris might have been at a standstill lately, the\nfencing academy had flourished as never hitherto. Usually both the\nmaster and his assistant were busy from morning until dusk, and already\nAndre-Louis was being paid now by the lessons that he gave, the\nmaster allowing him one half of the fee in each case for himself, an\narrangement which the assistant found profitable. On Sundays the\nacademy made half-holiday; but on this Sunday such had been the state of\nsuspense and ferment in the city that no one having appeared by eleven\no'clock both des Amis and Andre-Louis had gone out. Little they thought\nas they lightly took leave of each other--they were very good friends by\nnow--that they were never to meet again in this world.\n\nBloodshed there was that day in Paris. On the Place Vendome a detachment\nof dragoons awaited the crowd out of which Andre-Louis had slipped. The\nhorsemen swept down upon the mob, dispersed it, smashed the waxen effigy\nof M. Necker, and killed one man on the spot--an unfortunate French Guard\nwho stood his ground. That was a beginning. As a consequence Besenval\nbrought up his Swiss from the Champ de Mars and marshalled them in\nbattle order on the Champs Elysees with four pieces of artillery. His\ndragoons he stationed in the Place Louis XV. That evening an enormous\ncrowd, streaming along the Champs Elysees and the Tuileries Gardens,\nconsidered with eyes of alarm that warlike preparation. Some insults\nwere cast upon those foreign mercenaries and some stones were flung.\nBesenval, losing his head, or acting under orders, sent for his dragoons\nand ordered them to disperse the crowd, But that crowd was too dense to\nbe dispersed in this fashion; so dense that it was impossible for the\nhorsemen to move without crushing some one. There were several crushed,\nand as a consequence when the dragoons, led by the Prince de Lambesc,\nadvanced into the Tuileries Gardens, the outraged crowd met them with a\nfusillade of stones and bottles. Lambesc gave the order to fire. There\nwas a stampede. Pouring forth from the Tuileries through the city went\nthose indignant people with their story of German cavalry trampling upon\nwomen and children, and uttering now in grimmest earnest the call to\narms, raised at noon by Desmoulins in the Palais Royal.\n\nThe victims were taken up and borne thence, and amongst them was\nBertrand des Amis, himself--like all who lived by the sword--an ardent\nupholder of the noblesse, trampled to death under hooves of foreign\nhorsemen launched by the noblesse and led by a nobleman.\n\nTo Andre-Louis, waiting that evening on the second floor of No. 13\nRue du Hasard for the return of his friend and master, four men of the\npeople brought that broken body of one of the earliest victims of the\nRevolution that was now launched in earnest.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. PRESIDENT LE CHAPELIER\n\nThe ferment of Paris which, during the two following days, resembled an\narmed camp rather than a city, delayed the burial of Bertrand des Amis\nuntil the Wednesday of that eventful week. Amid events that were shaking\na nation to its foundations the death of a fencing-master passed almost\nunnoticed even among his pupils, most of whom did not come to the\nacademy during the two days that his body lay there. Some few, however,\ndid come, and these conveyed the news to others, with the result that\nthe master was followed to Pere Lachaise by a score of young men at the\nhead of whom as chief mourner walked Andre-Louis.\n\nThere were no relatives to be advised so far as Andre-Louis was aware,\nalthough within a week of M. des Amis' death a sister turned up from\nPassy to claim his heritage. This was considerable, for the master had\nprospered and saved money, most of which was invested in the Compagnie\ndes Eaux and the National Debt. Andre-Louis consigned her to the\nlawyers, and saw her no more.\n\nThe death of des Amis left him with so profound a sense of loneliness\nand desolation that he had no thought or care for the sudden access\nof fortune which it automatically procured him. To the master's sister\nmight fall such wealth as he had amassed, but Andre-Louis succeeded\nto the mine itself from which that wealth had been extracted, the\nfencing-school in which by now he was himself so well established as an\ninstructor that its numerous pupils looked to him to carry it forward\nsuccessfully as its chief. And never was there a season in which\nfencing-academies knew such prosperity as in these troubled days, when\nevery man was sharpening his sword and schooling himself in the uses of\nit.\n\nIt was not until a couple of weeks later that Andre-Louis realized what\nhad really happened to him, and he found himself at the same time an\nexhausted man, for during that fortnight he had been doing the work of\ntwo. If he had not hit upon the happy expedient of pairing-off his\nmore advanced pupils to fence with each other, himself standing by to\ncriticize, correct and otherwise instruct, he must have found the task\nutterly beyond his strength. Even so, it was necessary for him to fence\nsome six hours daily, and every day he brought arrears of lassitude\nfrom yesterday until he was in danger of succumbing under the increasing\nburden of fatigue. In the end he took an assistant to deal with\nbeginners, who gave the hardest work. He found him readily enough\nby good fortune in one of his own pupils named Le Duc. As the summer\nadvanced, and the concourse of pupils steadily increased, it became\nnecessary for him to take yet another assistant--an able young instructor\nnamed Galoche--and another room on the floor above.\n\nThey were strenuous days for Andre-Louis, more strenuous than he had\never known, even when he had been at work to build up the Binet Company;\nbut it follows that they were days of extraordinary prosperity. He\ncomments regretfully upon the fact that Bertrand des Amis should\nhave died by ill-chance on the very eve of so profitable a vogue of\nsword-play.\n\nThe arms of the Academie du Roi, to which Andre-Louis had no title,\nstill continued to be displayed outside his door. He had overcome the\ndifficulty in a manner worthy of Scaramouche. He left the escutcheon and\nthe legend \"Academie de Bertrand des Amis, Maitre en fait d'Armes des\nAcademies du Roi,\" appending to it the further legend: \"Conducted by\nAndre-Louis.\"\n\nWith little time now in which to go abroad it was from his pupils\nand the newspapers--of which a flood had risen in Paris with the\nestablishment of the freedom of the Press--that he learnt of the\nrevolutionary processes around him, following upon, as a measure of\nanticlimax, the fall of the Bastille. That had happened whilst M. des\nAmis lay dead, on the day before they buried him, and was indeed the\nchief reason of the delay in his burial. It was an event that had its\ninspiration in that ill-considered charge of Prince Lambesc in which the\nfencing-master had been killed.\n\nThe outraged people had besieged the electors in the Hotel de Ville,\ndemanding arms with which to defend their lives from these foreign\nmurderers hired by despotism. And in the end the electors had consented\nto give them arms, or, rather--for arms it had none to give--to permit\nthem to arm themselves. Also it had given them a cockade, of red and\nblue, the colours of Paris. Because these colours were also those of the\nliveries of the Duke of Orleans, white was added to them--the white of\nthe ancient standard of France--and thus was the tricolour born. Further,\na permanent committee of electors was appointed to watch over public\norder.\n\nThus empowered the people went to work with such good effect that within\nthirty-six hours sixty thousand pikes had been forged. At nine o'clock\non Tuesday morning thirty thousand men were before the Invalides. By\neleven o'clock they had ravished it of its store of arms amounting to\nsome thirty thousand muskets, whilst others had seized the Arsenal and\npossessed themselves of powder.\n\nThus they prepared to resist the attack that from seven points was to\nbe launched that evening upon the city. But Paris did not wait for the\nattack. It took the initiative. Mad with enthusiasm it conceived the\ninsane project of taking that terrible menacing fortress, the Bastille,\nand, what is more, it succeeded, as you know, before five o'clock that\nnight, aided in the enterprise by the French Guards with cannon.\n\nThe news of it, borne to Versailles by Lambesc in flight with his\ndragoons before the vast armed force that had sprouted from the\npaving-stones of Paris, gave the Court pause. The people were in\npossession of the guns captured from the Bastille. They were erecting\nbarricades in the streets, and mounting these guns upon them. The attack\nhad been too long delayed. It must be abandoned since now it could lead\nonly to fruitless slaughter that must further shake the already sorely\nshaken prestige of Royalty.\n\nAnd so the Court, growing momentarily wise again under the spur of fear,\npreferred to temporize. Necker should be brought back yet once again,\nthe three orders should sit united as the National Assembly demanded. It\nwas the completest surrender of force to force, the only argument. The\nKing went alone to inform the National Assembly of that eleventh-hour\nresolve, to the great comfort of its members, who viewed with pain and\nalarm the dreadful state of things in Paris. \"No force but the force of\nreason and argument\" was their watchword, and it was so to continue for\ntwo years yet, with a patience and fortitude in the face of ceaseless\nprovocation to which insufficient justice has been done.\n\nAs the King was leaving the Assembly, a woman, embracing his knees, gave\ntongue to what might well be the question of all France:\n\n\"Ah, sire, are you really sincere? Are you sure they will not make you\nchange your mind?\"\n\nYet no such question was asked when a couple of days later the King,\nalone and unguarded save by the representatives of the Nation, came to\nParis to complete the peacemaking, the surrender of Privilege. The Court\nwas filled with terror by the adventure. Were they not the \"enemy,\"\nthese mutinous Parisians? And should a King go thus among his enemies?\nIf he shared some of that fear, as the gloom of him might lead us to\nsuppose, he must have found it idle. What if two hundred thousand men\nunder arms--men without uniforms and with the most extraordinary motley\nof weapons ever seen--awaited him? They awaited him as a guard of honour.\n\nMayor Bailly at the barrier presented him with the keys of the city.\n\"These are the same keys that were presented to Henri IV. He had\nreconquered his people. Now the people have reconquered their King.\"\n\nAt the Hotel de Ville Mayor Bailly offered him the new cockade, the\ntricoloured symbol of constitutional France, and when he had given his\nroyal confirmation to the formation of the Garde Bourgeoise and to the\nappointments of Bailly and Lafayette, he departed again for Versailles\namid the shouts of \"Vive le Roi!\" from his loyal people.\n\nAnd now you see Privilege--before the cannon's mouth, as it\nwere--submitting at last, where had they submitted sooner they might have\nsaved oceans of blood--chiefly their own. They come, nobles and clergy,\nto join the National Assembly, to labour with it upon this constitution\nthat is to regenerate France. But the reunion is a mockery--as much a\nmockery as that of the Archbishop of Paris singing the Te Deum for\nthe fall of the Bastille--most grotesque and incredible of all these\ngrotesque and incredible events. All that has happened to the National\nAssembly is that it has introduced five or six hundred enemies to hamper\nand hinder its deliberations.\n\nBut all this is an oft-told tale, to be read in detail elsewhere. I\ngive you here just so much of it as I have found in Andre-Louis' own\nwritings, almost in his own words, reflecting the changes that were\noperated in his mind. Silent now, he came fully to believe in those\nthings in which he had not believed when earlier he had preached them.\n\nMeanwhile together with the change in his fortune had come a change\nin his position towards the law, a change brought about by the other\nchanges wrought around him. No longer need he hide himself. Who in these\ndays would prefer against him the grotesque charge of sedition for\nwhat he had done in Brittany? What court would dare to send him to the\ngallows for having said in advance what all France was saying now? As\nfor that other possible charge of murder, who should concern himself\nwith the death of the miserable Binet killed by him--if, indeed, he had\nkilled him, as he hoped--in self-defence.\n\nAnd so one fine day in early August, Andre-Louis gave himself a holiday\nfrom the academy, which was now working smoothly under his assistants,\nhired a chaise and drove out to Versailles to the Caf\u00e9 d'Amaury, which\nhe knew for the meeting-place of the Club Breton, the seed from which\nwas to spring that Society of the Friends of the Constitution better\nknown as the Jacobins. He went to seek Le Chapelier, who had been one\nof the founders of the club, a man of great prominence now, president of\nthe Assembly in this important season when it was deliberating upon the\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man.\n\nLe Chapelier's importance was reflected in the sudden servility of the\nshirt-sleeved, white-aproned waiter of whom Andre-Louis inquired for the\nrepresentative.\n\nM. Le Chapelier was above-stairs with friends. The waiter desired to\nserve the gentleman, but hesitated to break in upon the assembly in\nwhich M. le Depute found himself.\n\nAndre-Louis gave him a piece of silver to encourage him to make the\nattempt. Then he sat down at a marble-topped table by the window looking\nout over the wide tree-encircled square. There, in that common-room of\nthe caf\u00e9, deserted at this hour of mid-afternoon, the great man came to\nhim. Less than a year ago he had yielded precedence to Andre-Louis in\na matter of delicate leadership; to-day he stood on the heights, one\nof the great leaders of the Nation in travail, and Andre-Louis was deep\ndown in the shadows of the general mass.\n\nThe thought was in the minds of both as they scanned each other, each\nnoting in the other the marked change that a few months had wrought.\nIn Le Chapelier, Andre-Louis observed certain heightened refinements of\ndress that went with certain subtler refinements of countenance. He was\nthinner than of old, his face was pale and there was a weariness in the\neyes that considered his visitor through a gold-rimmed spy-glass. In\nAndre-Louis those jaded but quick-moving eyes of the Breton deputy noted\nchanges even more marked. The almost constant swordmanship of these\nlast months had given Andre-Louis a grace of movement, a poise, and a\ncurious, indefinable air of dignity, of command. He seemed taller by\nvirtue of this, and he was dressed with an elegance which if quiet was\nnone the less rich. He wore a small silver-hilted sword, and wore it as\nif used to it, and his black hair that Le Chapelier had never seen other\nthan fluttering lank about his bony cheeks was glossy now and gathered\ninto a club. Almost he had the air of a petit-maitre.\n\nIn both, however, the changes were purely superficial, as each was\nsoon to reveal to the other. Le Chapelier was ever the same direct and\ndownright Breton, abrupt of manner and of speech. He stood smiling a\nmoment in mingled surprise and pleasure; then opened wide his arms. They\nembraced under the awe-stricken gaze of the waiter, who at once effaced\nhimself.\n\n\"Andre-Louis, my friend! Whence do you drop?\"\n\n\"We drop from above. I come from below to survey at close quarters one\nwho is on the heights.\"\n\n\"On the heights! But that you willed it so, it is yourself might now be\nstanding in my place.\"\n\n\"I have a poor head for heights, and I find the atmosphere too rarefied.\nIndeed, you look none too well on it yourself, Isaac. You are pale.\"\n\n\"The Assembly was in session all last night. That is all. These damned\nPrivileged multiply our difficulties. They will do so until we decree\ntheir abolition.\"\n\nThey sat down. \"Abolition! You contemplate so much? Not that you\nsurprise me. You have always been an extremist.\"\n\n\"I contemplate it that I may save them. I seek to abolish them\nofficially, so as to save them from abolition of another kind at the\nhands of a people they exasperate.\"\n\n\"I see. And the King?\"\n\n\"The King is the incarnation of the Nation. We shall deliver him\ntogether with the Nation from the bondage of Privilege. Our constitution\nwill accomplish it. You agree?\"\n\nAndre-Louis shrugged. \"Does it matter? I am a dreamer in politics, not\na man of action. Until lately I have been very moderate; more moderate\nthan you think. But now almost I am a republican. I have been watching,\nand I have perceived that this King is--just nothing, a puppet who dances\naccording to the hand that pulls the string.\"\n\n\"This King, you say? What other king is possible? You are surely not\nof those who weave dreams about Orleans? He has a sort of party, a\nfollowing largely recruited by the popular hatred of the Queen and the\nknown fact that she hates him. There are some who have thought of making\nhim regent, some even more; Robespierre is of the number.\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Andre-Louis, to whom the name was unknown.\n\n\"Robespierre--a preposterous little lawyer who represents Arras, a\nshabby, clumsy, timid dullard, who will make speeches through his nose\nto which nobody listens--an ultra-royalist whom the royalists and the\nOrleanists are using for their own ends. He has pertinacity, and he\ninsists upon being heard. He may be listened to some day. But that\nhe, or the others, will ever make anything of Orleans... pish! Orleans\nhimself may desire it, but the man is a eunuch in crime; he would, but\nhe can't. The phrase is Mirabeau's.\"\n\nHe broke off to demand Andre-Louis' news of himself.\n\n\"You did not treat me as a friend when you wrote to me,\" he complained.\n\"You gave me no clue to your whereabouts; you represented yourself as on\nthe verge of destitution and withheld from me the means to come to your\nassistance. I have been troubled in mind about you, Andre. Yet to judge\nby your appearance I might have spared myself that. You seem prosperous,\nassured. Tell me of it.\"\n\nAndre-Louis told him frankly all that there was to tell. \"Do you know\nthat you are an amazement to me?\" said the deputy. \"From the robe to the\nbuskin, and now from the buskin to the sword! What will be the end of\nyou, I wonder?\"\n\n\"The gallows, probably.\"\n\n\"Pish! Be serious. Why not the toga of the senator in senatorial France?\nIt might be yours now if you had willed it so.\"\n\n\"The surest way to the gallows of all,\" laughed Andre-Louis.\n\nAt the moment Le Chapelier manifested impatience. I wonder did the\nphrase cross his mind that day four years later when himself he rode in\nthe death-cart to the Greve.\n\n\"We are sixty-six Breton deputies in the Assembly. Should a vacancy\noccur, will you act as suppleant? A word from me together with the\ninfluence of your name in Rennes and Nantes, and the thing is done.\"\n\nAndre-Louis laughed outright. \"Do you know, Isaac, that I never meet you\nbut you seek to thrust me into politics?\"\n\n\"Because you have a gift for politics. You were born for politics.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes--Scaramouche in real life. I've played it on the stage. Let that\nsuffice. Tell me, Isaac, what news of my old friend, La Tour d'Azyr?\"\n\n\"He is here in Versailles, damn him--a thorn in the flesh of the\nAssembly. They've burnt his chateau at La Tour d'Azyr. Unfortunately he\nwasn't in it at the time. The flames haven't even singed his insolence.\nHe dreams that when this philosophic aberration is at an end, there will\nbe serfs to rebuild it for him.\"\n\n\"So there has been trouble in Brittany?\" Andre-Louis had become suddenly\ngrave, his thoughts swinging to Gavrillac.\n\n\"An abundance of it, and elsewhere too. Can you wonder? These delays\nat such a time, with famine in the land? Chateaux have been going up in\nsmoke during the last fortnight. The peasants took their cue from\nthe Parisians, and treated every castle as a Bastille. Order is being\nrestored, there as here, and they are quieter now.\"\n\n\"What of Gavrillac? Do you know?\"\n\n\"I believe all to be well. M. de Kercadiou was not a Marquis de La Tour\nd'Azyr. He was in sympathy with his people. It is not likely that they\nwould injure Gavrillac. But don't you correspond with your godfather?\"\n\n\"In the circumstances--no. What you tell me would make it now more\ndifficult than ever, for he must account me one of those who helped to\nlight the torch that has set fire to so much belonging to his class.\nAscertain for me that all is well, and let me know.\"\n\n\"I will, at once.\"\n\nAt parting, when Andre-Louis was on the point of stepping into his\ncabriolet to return to Paris, he sought information on another matter.\n\n\"Do you happen to know if M. de La Tour d'Azyr has married?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't; which really means that he hasn't. One would have heard of it\nin the case of that exalted Privileged.\"\n\n\"To be sure.\" Andre-Louis spoke indifferently. \"Au revoir, Isaac! You'll\ncome and see me--13 Rue du Hasard. Come soon.\"\n\n\"As soon and as often as my duties will allow. They keep me chained here\nat present.\"\n\n\"Poor slave of duty with your gospel of liberty!\"\n\n\"True! And because of that I will come. I have a duty to Brittany: to\nmake Omnes Omnibus one of her representatives in the National Assembly.\"\n\n\"That is a duty you will oblige me by neglecting,\" laughed Andre-Louis,\nand drove away.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. AT MEUDON\n\nLater in the week he received a visit from Le Chapelier just before\nnoon.\n\n\"I have news for you, Andre. Your godfather is at Meudon. He arrived\nthere two days ago. Had you heard?\"\n\n\"But no. How should I hear? Why is he at Meudon?\" He was conscious of a\nfaint excitement, which he could hardly have explained.\n\n\"I don't know. There have been fresh disturbances in Brittany. It may be\ndue to that.\"\n\n\"And so he has come for shelter to his brother?\" asked Andre-Louis.\n\n\"To his brother's house, yes; but not to his brother. Where do you live\nat all, Andre? Do you never hear any of the news? Etienne de Gavrillac\nemigrated years ago. He was of the household of M. d'Artois, and he\ncrossed the frontier with him. By now, no doubt, he is in Germany with\nhim, conspiring against France. For that is what the emigres are\ndoing. That Austrian woman at the Tuileries will end by destroying the\nmonarchy.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Andre-Louis impatiently. Politics interested him not at\nall this morning. \"But about Gavrillac?\"\n\n\"Why, haven't I told you that Gavrillac is at Meudon, installed in the\nhouse his brother has left? Dieu de Dieu! Don't I speak French or don't\nyou understand the language? I believe that Rabouillet, his intendant,\nis in charge of Gavrillac. I have brought you the news the moment I\nreceived it. I thought you would probably wish to go out to Meudon.\"\n\n\"Of course. I will go at once--that is, as soon as I can. I can't to-day,\nnor yet to-morrow. I am too busy here.\" He waved a hand towards the\ninner room, whence proceeded the click-click of blades, the quick moving\nof feet, and the voice of the instructor, Le Duc.\n\n\"Well, well, that is your own affair. You are busy. I leave you now. Let\nus dine this evening at the Caf\u00e9 de Foy. Kersain will be of the party.\"\n\n\"A moment!\" Andre-Louis' voice arrested him on the threshold. \"Is Mlle.\nde Kercadiou with her uncle?\"\n\n\"How the devil should I know? Go and find out.\"\n\nHe was gone, and Andre-Louis stood there a moment deep in thought.\nThen he turned and went back to resume with his pupil, the Vicomte de\nVilleniort, the interrupted exposition of the demi-contre of Danet,\nillustrating with a small-sword the advantages to be derived from its\nadoption.\n\nThereafter he fenced with the Vicomte, who was perhaps the ablest of his\npupils at the time, and all the while his thoughts were on the heights\nof Meudon, his mind casting up the lessons he had to give that afternoon\nand on the morrow, and wondering which of these he might postpone\nwithout deranging the academy. When having touched the Vicomte three\ntimes in succession, he paused and wrenched himself back to the present,\nit was to marvel at the precision to be gained by purely mechanical\naction. Without bestowing a thought upon what he was doing, his wrist\nand arm and knees had automatically performed their work, like the\naccurate fighting engine into which constant practice for a year and\nmore had combined them.\n\nNot until Sunday was Andre-Louis able to satisfy a wish which the\nimpatience of the intervening days had converted into a yearning.\nDressed with more than ordinary care, his head elegantly coiffed--by one\nof those hairdressers to the nobility of whom so many were being thrown\nout of employment by the stream of emigration which was now flowing\nfreely--Andre-Louis mounted his hired carriage, and drove out to Meudon.\n\nThe house of the younger Kercadiou no more resembled that of the head\nof the family than did his person. A man of the Court, where his brother\nwas essentially a man of the soil, an officer of the household of M.\nle Comte d'Artois, he had built for himself and his family an imposing\nvilla on the heights of Meudon in a miniature park, conveniently\nsituated for him midway between Versailles and Paris, and easily\naccessible from either. M. d'Artois--the royal tennis-player--had been\namongst the very first to emigrate. Together with the Condes, the\nContis, the Polignacs, and others of the Queen's intimate council, old\nMarshal de Broglie and the Prince de Lambesc, who realized that their\nvery names had become odious to the people, he had quitted France\nimmediately after the fall of the Bastille. He had gone to play tennis\nbeyond the frontier--and there consummate the work of ruining the French\nmonarchy upon which he and those others had been engaged in France. With\nhim, amongst several members of his household went Etienne de Kercadiou,\nand with Etienne de Kercadiou went his family, a wife and four children.\nThus it was that the Seigneur de Gavrillac, glad to escape from a\nprovince so peculiarly disturbed as that of Brittany--where the nobles\nhad shown themselves the most intransigent of all France--had come to\noccupy in his brother's absence the courtier's handsome villa at Meudon.\n\nThat he was quite happy there is not to be supposed. A man of his almost\nSpartan habits, accustomed to plain fare and self-help, was a little\nuneasy in this sybaritic abode, with its soft carpets, profusion of\ngilding, and battalion of sleek, silent-footed servants--for Kercadiou\nthe younger had left his entire household behind. Time, which at\nGavrillac he had kept so fully employed in agrarian concerns, here hung\nheavily upon his hands. In self-defence he slept a great deal, and but\nfor Aline, who made no attempt to conceal her delight at this proximity\nto Paris and the heart of things, it is possible that he would have beat\na retreat almost at once from surroundings that sorted so ill with his\nhabits. Later on, perhaps, he would accustom himself and grow resigned\nto this luxurious inactivity. In the meantime the novelty of it fretted\nhim, and it was into the presence of a peevish and rather somnolent\nM. de Kercadiou that Andre-Louis was ushered in the early hours of the\nafternoon of that Sunday in June. He was unannounced, as had ever been\nthe custom at Gavrillac. This because Benoit, M. de Kercadiou's old\nseneschal, had accompanied his seigneur upon this soft adventure, and\nwas installed--to the ceaseless and but half-concealed hilarity of the\nimpertinent valetaille that M. Etienne had left--as his maitre d'hotel\nhere at Meudon.\n\nBenoit had welcomed M. Andre with incoherencies of delight; almost had\nhe gambolled about him like some faithful dog, whilst conducting him to\nthe salon and the presence of the Lord of Gavrillac, who would--in the\nwords of Benoit--be ravished to see M. Andre again.\n\n\"Monseigneur! Monseigneur!\" he cried in a quavering voice, entering a\npace or two in advance of the visitor. \"It is M. Andre... M. Andre, your\ngodson, who comes to kiss your hand. He is here... and so fine that you\nwould hardly know him. Here he is, monseigneur! Is he not beautiful?\"\n\nAnd the old servant rubbed his hands in conviction of the delight that\nhe believed he was conveying to his master.\n\nAndre-Louis crossed the threshold of that great room, soft-carpeted to\nthe foot, dazzling to the eye. It was immensely lofty, and its festooned\nceiling was carried on fluted pillars with gilded capitals. The door by\nwhich he entered, and the windows that opened upon the garden, were of\nan enormous height--almost, indeed, the full height of the room itself.\nIt was a room overwhelmingly gilded, with an abundance of ormolu\nencrustations on the furniture, in which it nowise differed from what\nwas customary in the dwellings of people of birth and wealth. Never,\nindeed, was there a time in which so much gold was employed decoratively\nas in this age when coined gold was almost unprocurable, and paper money\nhad been put into circulation to supply the lack. It was a saying of\nAndre-Louis' that if these people could only have been induced to put\nthe paper on their walls and the gold into their pockets, the finances\nof the kingdom might soon have been in better case.\n\nThe Seigneur--furbished and beruffled to harmonize with his\nsurroundings--had risen, startled by this exuberant invasion on the part\nof Benoit, who had been almost as forlorn as himself since their coming\nto Meudon.\n\n\"What is it? Eh?\" His pale, short-sighted eyes peered at the visitor.\n\"Andre!\" said he, between surprise and sternness; and the colour\ndeepened in his great pink face.\n\nBenoit, with his back to his master, deliberately winked and grinned at\nAndre-Louis to encourage him not to be put off by any apparent hostility\non the part of his godfather. That done, the intelligent old fellow\ndiscreetly effaced himself.\n\n\"What do you want here?\" growled M. de Kercadiou.\n\n\"No more than to kiss your hand, as Benoit has told you, monsieur my\ngodfather,\" said Andre-Louis submissively, bowing his sleek black head.\n\n\"You have contrived without kissing it for two years.\"\n\n\"Do not, monsieur, reproach me with my misfortune.\"\n\nThe little man stood very stiffly erect, his disproportionately large\nhead thrown back, his pale prominent eyes very stern.\n\n\"Did you think to make your outrageous offence any better by vanishing\nin that heartless manner, by leaving us without knowledge of whether you\nwere alive or dead?\"\n\n\"At first it was dangerous--dangerous to my life--to disclose my\nwhereabouts. Then for a time I was in need, almost destitute, and my\npride forbade me, after what I had done and the view you must take of\nit, to appeal to you for help. Later...\"\n\n\"Destitute?\" The Seigneur interrupted. For a moment his lip trembled.\nThen he steadied himself, and the frown deepened as he surveyed this\nvery changed and elegant godson of his, noted the quiet richness of his\napparel, the paste buckles and red heels to his shoes, the sword hilted\nin mother-o'-pearl and silver, and the carefully dressed hair that he\nhad always seen hanging in wisps about his face. \"At least you do not\nlook destitute now,\" he sneered.\n\n\"I am not. I have prospered since. In that, monsieur, I differ from the\nordinary prodigal, who returns only when he needs assistance. I return\nsolely because I love you, monsieur--to tell you so. I have come at the\nvery first moment after hearing of your presence here.\" He advanced.\n\"Monsieur my godfather!\" he said, and held out his hand.\n\nBut M. de Kercadiou remained unbending, wrapped in his cold dignity and\nresentment.\n\n\"Whatever tribulations you may have suffered or consider that you may\nhave suffered, they are far less than your disgraceful conduct deserved,\nand I observe that they have nothing abated your impudence. You think\nthat you have but to come here and say, 'Monsieur my godfather!' and\neverything is to be forgiven and forgotten. That is your error. You have\ncommitted too great a wrong; you have offended against everything by\nwhich I hold, and against myself personally, by your betrayal of my\ntrust in you. You are one of those unspeakable scoundrels who are\nresponsible for this revolution.\"\n\n\"Alas, monsieur, I see that you share the common delusion. These\nunspeakable scoundrels but demanded a constitution, as was promised them\nfrom the throne. They were not to know that the promise was insincere,\nor that its fulfilment would be baulked by the privileged orders. The\nmen who have precipitated this revolution, monsieur, are the nobles and\nthe prelates.\"\n\n\"You dare--and at such a time as this--stand there and tell me such\nabominable lies! You dare to say that the nobles have made the\nrevolution, when scores of them, following the example of M. le Duc\nd'Aiguillon, have flung their privileges, even their title-deeds, into\nthe lap of the people! Or perhaps you deny it?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Having wantonly set fire to their house, they now try to put\nit out by throwing water on it; and where they fail they put the entire\nblame on the flames.\"\n\n\"I see that you have come here to talk politics.\"\n\n\"Far from it. I have come, if possible, to explain myself. To understand\nis always to forgive. That is a great saying of Montaigne's. If I could\nmake you understand...\"\n\n\"You can't. You'll never make me understand how you came to render\nyourself so odiously notorious in Brittany.\"\n\n\"Ah, not odiously, monsieur!\"\n\n\"Certainly, odiously--among those that matter. It is said even that you\nwere Omnes Omnibus, though that I cannot, will not believe.\"\n\n\"Yet it is true.\"\n\nM. de Kercadiou choked. \"And you confess it? You dare to confess it?\"\n\n\"What a man dares to do, he should dare to confess--unless he is a\ncoward.\"\n\n\"Oh, and to be sure you were very brave, running away each time after\nyou had done the mischief, turning comedian to hide yourself, doing more\nmischief as a comedian, provoking a riot in Nantes, and then running\naway again, to become God knows what--something dishonest by the affluent\nlook of you. My God, man, I tell you that in these past two years I have\nhoped that you were dead, and you profoundly disappoint me that you\nare not!\" He beat his hands together, and raised his shrill voice to\ncall--\"Benoit!\" He strode away towards the fireplace, scarlet in the\nface, shaking with the passion into which he had worked himself. \"Dead,\nI might have forgiven you, as one who had paid for his evil, and his\nfolly. Living, I never can forgive you. You have gone too far. God alone\nknows where it will end.\n\n\"Benoit, the door. M. Andre-Louis Moreau to the door!\" The tone argued\nan irrevocable determination. Pale and self-contained, but with a queer\npain at his heart, Andre-Louis heard that dismissal, saw Benoit's\nwhite, scared face and shaking hands half-raised as if he were about\nto expostulate with his master. And then another voice, a crisp, boyish\nvoice, cut in.\n\n\"Uncle!\" it cried, a world of indignation and surprise in its pitch,\nand then: \"Andre!\" And this time a note almost of gladness, certainly of\nwelcome, was blended with the surprise that still remained.\n\nBoth turned, half the room between them at the moment, and beheld Aline\nin one of the long, open windows, arrested there in the act of entering\nfrom the garden, Aline in a milk-maid bonnet of the latest mode, though\nwithout any of the tricolour embellishments that were so commonly to be\nseen upon them.\n\nThe thin lips of Andre's long mouth twisted into a queer smile. Into his\nmind had flashed the memory of their last parting. He saw himself again,\nstanding burning with indignation upon the pavement of Nantes, looking\nafter her carriage as it receded down the Avenue de Gigan.\n\nShe was coming towards him now with outstretched hands, a heightened\ncolour in her cheeks, a smile of welcome on her lips. He bowed low and\nkissed her hand in silence.\n\nThen with a glance and a gesture she dismissed Benoit, and in her\nimperious fashion constituted herself Andre's advocate against that\nharsh dismissal which she had overheard.\n\n\"Uncle,\" she said, leaving Andre and crossing to M. de Kercadiou, \"you\nmake me ashamed of you! To allow a feeling of peevishness to overwhelm\nall your affection for Andre!\"\n\n\"I have no affection for him. I had once. He chose to extinguish it.\nHe can go to the devil; and please observe that I don't permit you to\ninterfere.\"\n\n\"But if he confesses that he has done wrong...\"\n\n\"He confesses nothing of the kind. He comes here to argue with me about\nthese infernal Rights of Man. He proclaims himself unrepentant. He\nannounces himself with pride to have been, as all Brittany says, the\nscoundrel who hid himself under the sobriquet of Omnes Omnibus. Is that\nto be condoned?\"\n\nShe turned to look at Andre across the wide space that now separated\nthem.\n\n\"But is this really so? Don't you repent, Andre--now that you see all the\nharm that has come?\"\n\nIt was a clear invitation to him, a pleading to him to say that he\nrepented, to make his peace with his godfather. For a moment it almost\nmoved him. Then, considering the subterfuge unworthy, he answered\ntruthfully, though the pain he was suffering rang in his voice.\n\n\"To confess repentance,\" he said slowly, \"would be to confess to a\nmonstrous crime. Don't you see that? Oh, monsieur, have patience\nwith me; let me explain myself a little. You say that I am in part\nresponsible for something of all this that has happened. My exhortations\nof the people at Rennes and twice afterwards at Nantes are said to have\nhad their share in what followed there. It may be so. It would be beyond\nmy power positively to deny it. Revolution followed and bloodshed. More\nmay yet come. To repent implies a recognition that I have done wrong.\nHow shall I say that I have done wrong, and thus take a share of the\nresponsibility for all that blood upon my soul? I will be quite frank\nwith you to show you how far, indeed, I am from repentance. What I did,\nI actually did against all my convictions at the time. Because there\nwas no justice in France to move against the murderer of Philippe de\nVilmorin, I moved in the only way that I imagined could make the evil\ndone recoil upon the hand that did it, and those other hands that had\nthe power but not the spirit to punish. Since then I have come to see\nthat I was wrong, and that Philippe de Vilmorin and those who thought\nwith him were in the right.\n\n\"You must realize, monsieur, that it is with sincerest thankfulness\nthat I find I have done nothing calling for repentance; that, on the\ncontrary, when France is given the inestimable boon of a constitution,\nas will shortly happen, I may take pride in having played my part in\nbringing about the conditions that have made this possible.\"\n\nThere was a pause. M. de Kercadiou's face turned from pink to purple.\n\n\"You have quite finished?\" he said harshly.\n\n\"If you have understood me, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Oh, I have understood you, and... and I beg that you will go.\"\n\nAndre-Louis shrugged his shoulders and hung his head. He had come there\nso joyously, in such yearning, merely to receive a final dismissal. He\nlooked at Aline. Her face was pale and troubled; but her wit failed to\nshow her how she could come to his assistance. His excessive honesty had\nburnt all his boats.\n\n\"Very well, monsieur. Yet this I would ask you to remember after I am\ngone. I have not come to you as one seeking assistance, as one driven to\nyou by need. I am no returning prodigal, as I have said. I am one who,\nneeding nothing, asking nothing, master of his own destinies, has come\nto you driven by affection only, urged by the love and gratitude he\nbears you and will continue to bear you.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" cried Aline, turning now to her uncle. Here at least was an\nargument in Andre's favour, thought she. \"That is true. Surely that...\"\n\nInarticulately he hissed her into silence, exasperated.\n\n\"Hereafter perhaps that will help you to think of me more kindly,\nmonsieur.\"\n\n\"I see no occasion, sir, to think of you at all. Again, I beg that you\nwill go.\"\n\nAndre-Louis looked at Aline an instant, as if still hesitating.\n\nShe answered him by a glance at her furious uncle, a faint shrug, and a\nlift of the eyebrows, dejection the while in her countenance.\n\nIt was as if she said: \"You see his mood. There is nothing to be done.\"\n\nHe bowed with that singular grace the fencing-room had given him and\nwent out by the door.\n\n\"Oh, it is cruel!\" cried Aline, in a stifled voice, her hands clenched,\nand she sprang to the window.\n\n\"Aline!\" her uncle's voice arrested her. \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"But we do not know where he is to be found.\"\n\n\"Who wants to find the scoundrel?\"\n\n\"We may never see him again.\"\n\n\"That is most fervently to be desired.\"\n\nAline said \"Ouf!\" and went out by the window.\n\nHe called after her, imperiously commanding her return. But\nAline--dutiful child--closed her ears lest she must disobey him, and\nsped light-footed across the lawn to the avenue there to intercept the\ndeparting Andre-Louis.\n\nAs he came forth wrapped in gloom, she stepped from the bordering trees\ninto his path.\n\n\"Aline!\" he cried, joyously almost.\n\n\"I did not want you to go like this. I couldn't let you,\" she explained\nherself. \"I know him better than you do, and I know that his great soft\nheart will presently melt. He will be filled with regret. He will want\nto send for you, and he will not know where to send.\"\n\n\"You think that?\"\n\n\"Oh, I know it! You arrive in a bad moment. He is peevish and\ncross-grained, poor man, since he came here. These soft surroundings\nare all so strange to him. He wearies himself away from his beloved\nGavrillac, his hunting and tillage, and the truth is that in his mind he\nvery largely blames you for what has happened--for the necessity, or at\nleast, the wisdom, of this change. Brittany, you must know, was becoming\ntoo unsafe. The chateau of La Tour d'Azyr, amongst others, was burnt to\nthe ground some months ago. At any moment, given a fresh excitement, it\nmay be the turn of Gavrillac. And for this and his present discomfort he\nblames you and your friends. But he will come round presently. He will\nbe sorry that he sent you away like this--for I know that he loves you,\nAndre, in spite of all. I shall reason with him when the time comes. And\nthen we shall want to know where to find you.\"\n\n\"At number 13, Rue du Hasard. The number is unlucky, the name of the\nstreet appropriate. Therefore both are easy to remember.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I will walk with you to the gates.\" And side by side now\nthey proceeded at a leisurely pace down the long avenue in the June\nsunshine dappled by the shadows of the bordering trees. \"You are looking\nwell, Andre; and do you know that you have changed a deal? I am glad\nthat you have prospered.\" And then, abruptly changing the subject before\nhe had time to answer her, she came to the matter uppermost in her mind.\n\n\"I have so wanted to see you in all these months, Andre. You were the\nonly one who could help me; the only one who could tell me the truth,\nand I was angry with you for never having written to say where you were\nto be found.\"\n\n\"Of course you encouraged me to do so when last we met in Nantes.\"\n\n\"What? Still resentful?\"\n\n\"I am never resentful. You should know that.\" He expressed one of his\nvanities. He loved to think himself a Stoic. \"But I still bear the scar\nof a wound that would be the better for the balm of your retraction.\"\n\n\"Why, then, I retract, Andre. And now tell me.\"\n\n\"Yes, a self-seeking retraction,\" said he. \"You give me something that\nyou may obtain something.\" He laughed quite pleasantly. \"Well, well;\ncommand me.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Andre.\" She paused, as if in some difficulty, and then went\non, her eyes upon the ground: \"Tell me--the truth of that event at the\nFeydau.\"\n\nThe request fetched a frown to his brow. He suspected at once the\nthought that prompted it. Quite simply and briefly he gave her his\nversion of the affair.\n\nShe listened very attentively. When he had done she sighed; her face was\nvery thoughtful.\n\n\"That is much what I was told,\" she said. \"But it was added that M.\nde La Tour d'Azyr had gone to the theatre expressly for the purpose of\nbreaking finally with La Binet. Do you know if that was so?\"\n\n\"I don't; nor of any reason why it should be so. La Binet provided him\nthe sort of amusement that he and his kind are forever craving...\"\n\n\"Oh, there was a reason,\" she interrupted him. \"I was the reason.\nI spoke to Mme. de Sautron. I told her that I would not continue to\nreceive one who came to me contaminated in that fashion.\" She spoke\nof it with obvious difficulty, her colour rising as he watched her\nhalf-averted face.\n\n\"Had you listened to me...\" he was beginning, when again she interrupted\nhim.\n\n\"M. de Sautron conveyed my decision to him, and afterwards represented\nhim to me as a man in despair, repentant, ready to give proofs--any\nproofs--of his sincerity and devotion to me. He told me that M. de La\nTour d'Azyr had sworn to him that he would cut short that affair, that\nhe would see La Binet no more. And then, on the very next day I heard\nof his having all but lost his life in that riot at the theatre. He\nhad gone straight from that interview with M. de Sautron, straight from\nthose protestations of future wisdom, to La Binet. I was indignant. I\npronounced myself finally. I stated definitely that I would not in any\ncircumstances receive M. de La Tour d'Azyr again! And then they pressed\nthis explanation upon me. For a long time I would not believe it.\"\n\n\"So that you believe it now,\" said Andre quickly. \"Why?\"\n\n\"I have not said that I believe it now. But... but... neither can I\ndisbelieve. Since we came to Meudon M. de La Tour d'Azyr has been here,\nand himself he has sworn to me that it was so.\"\n\n\"Oh, if M. de La Tour d'Azyr has sworn...\" Andre-Louis was laughing on a\nbitter note of sarcasm.\n\n\"Have you ever known him lie?\" she cut in sharply. That checked him.\n\"M. de La Tour d'Azyr is, after all, a man of honour, and men of honour\nnever deal in falsehood. Have you ever known him do so, that you should\nsneer as you have done?\"\n\n\"No,\" he confessed. Common justice demanded that he should admit that\nvirtue at least in his enemy. \"I have not known him lie, it is true. His\nkind is too arrogant, too self-confident to have recourse to untruth.\nBut I have known him do things as vile...\"\n\n\"Nothing is as vile,\" she interrupted, speaking from the code by which\nshe had been reared. \"It is for liars only--who are first cousin to\nthieves--that there is no hope. It is in falsehood only that there is\nreal loss of honour.\"\n\n\"You are defending that satyr, I think,\" he said frostily.\n\n\"I desire to be just.\"\n\n\"Justice may seem to you a different matter when at last you shall\nhave resolved yourself to become Marquise de La Tour d'Azyr.\" He spoke\nbitterly.\n\n\"I don't think that I shall ever take that resolve.\"\n\n\"But you are still not sure--in spite of everything.\"\n\n\"Can one ever be sure of anything in this world?\"\n\n\"Yes. One can be sure of being foolish.\"\n\nEither she did not hear or did not heed him.\n\n\"You do not of your own knowledge know that it was not as M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr asserts--that he went to the Feydau that night?\"\n\n\"I don't,\" he admitted. \"It is of course possible. But does it matter?\"\n\n\"It might matter. Tell me; what became of La Binet after all?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"You don't know?\" She turned to consider him. \"And you can say it with\nthat indifference! I thought... I thought you loved her, Andre.\"\n\n\"So did I, for a little while. I was mistaken. It required a La\nTour d'Azyr to disclose the truth to me. They have their uses, these\ngentlemen. They help stupid fellows like myself to perceive important\ntruths. I was fortunate that revelation in my case preceded marriage. I\ncan now look back upon the episode with equanimity and thankfulness\nfor my near escape from the consequences of what was no more than an\naberration of the senses. It is a thing commonly confused with love. The\nexperience, as you see, was very instructive.\"\n\nShe looked at him in frank surprise.\n\n\"Do you know, Andre, I sometimes think that you have no heart.\"\n\n\"Presumably because I sometimes betray intelligence. And what of\nyourself, Aline? What of your own attitude from the outset where M. de\nLa Tour d'Azyr is concerned? Does that show heart? If I were to tell you\nwhat it really shows, we should end by quarrelling again, and God knows\nI can't afford to quarrel with you now. I... I shall take another way.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, nothing at the moment, for you are not in any danger of marrying\nthat animal.\"\n\n\"And if I were?\"\n\n\"Ah! In that case affection for you would discover to me some means of\npreventing it--unless...\" He paused.\n\n\"Unless?\" she demanded, challengingly, drawn to the full of her short\nheight, her eyes imperious.\n\n\"Unless you could also tell me that you loved him,\" said he simply,\nwhereat she was as suddenly and most oddly softened. And then he added,\nshaking his head: \"But that of course is impossible.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she asked him, quite gently now.\n\n\"Because you are what you are, Aline--utterly good and pure and adorable.\nAngels do not mate with devils. His wife you might become, but never his\nmate, Aline--never.\"\n\nThey had reached the wrought-iron gates at the end of the avenue.\nThrough these they beheld the waiting yellow chaise which had brought\nAndre-Louis. From near at hand came the creak of other wheels, the beat\nof other hooves, and now another vehicle came in sight, and drew to a\nstand-still beside the yellow chaise--a handsome equipage with polished\nmahogany panels on which the gold and azure of armorial bearings flashed\nbrilliantly in the sunlight. A footman swung to earth to throw wide the\ngates; but in that moment the lady who occupied the carriage, perceiving\nAline, waved to her and issued a command.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. MADAME DE PLOUGASTEL\n\nThe postilion drew rein, and the footman opened the door, letting\ndown the steps and proffering his arm to his mistress to assist her to\nalight, since that was the wish she had expressed. Then he opened\none wing of the iron gates, and held it for her. She was a woman of\nsomething more than forty, who once must have been very lovely, who\nwas very lovely still with the refining quality that age brings to some\nwomen. Her dress and carriage alike advertised great rank.\n\n\"I take my leave here, since you have a visitor,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"But it is an old acquaintance of your own, Andre. You remember Mme. la\nComtesse de Plougastel?\"\n\nHe looked at the approaching lady, whom Aline was now hastening forward\nto meet, and because she was named to him he recognized her. He must,\nhe thought, had he but looked, have recognized her without prompting\nanywhere at any time, and this although it was some sixteen years since\nlast he had seen her. The sight of her now brought it all back to him--a\ntreasured memory that had never permitted itself to be entirely overlaid\nby subsequent events.\n\nWhen he was a boy of ten, on the eve of being sent to school at Rennes,\nshe had come on a visit to his godfather, who was her cousin. It\nhappened that at the time he was taken by Rabouillet to the Manor of\nGavrillac, and there he had been presented to Mme. de Plougastel. The\ngreat lady, in all the glory then of her youthful beauty, with her\ngentle, cultured voice--so cultured that she had seemed to speak a\nlanguage almost unknown to the little Breton lad--and her majestic air of\nthe great world, had scared him a little at first. Very gently had she\nallayed those fears of his, and by some mysterious enchantment she had\ncompletely enslaved his regard. He recalled now the terror in which\nhe had gone to the embrace to which he was bidden, and the subsequent\nreluctance with which he had left those soft round arms. He remembered,\ntoo, how sweetly she had smelled and the very perfume she had used, a\nperfume as of lilac--for memory is singularly tenacious in these matters.\n\nFor three days whilst she had been at Gavrillac, he had gone daily to\nthe manor, and so had spent hours in her company. A childless woman with\nthe maternal instinct strong within her, she had taken this precociously\nintelligent, wide-eyed lad to her heart.\n\n\"Give him to me, Cousin Quintin,\" he remembered her saying on the\nlast of those days to his godfather. \"Let me take him back with me to\nVersailles as my adopted child.\"\n\nBut the Seigneur had gravely shaken his head in silent refusal, and\nthere had been no further question of such a thing. And then, when she\nsaid good-bye to him--the thing came flooding back to him now--there had\nbeen tears in her eyes.\n\n\"Think of me sometimes, Andre-Louis,\" had been her last words.\n\nHe remembered how flattered he had been to have won within so short a\ntime the affection of this great lady. The thing had given him a sense\nof importance that had endured for months thereafter, finally to fade\ninto oblivion.\n\nBut all was vividly remembered now upon beholding her again, after\nsixteen years, profoundly changed and matured, the girl--for she had been\nno more in those old days--sunk in this worldly woman with the air of\ncalm dignity and complete self-possession. Yet, he insisted, he must\nhave known her anywhere again.\n\nAline embraced her affectionately, and then answering the questioning\nglance with faintly raised eyebrows that madame was directing towards\nAline's companion--\n\n\"This is Andre-Louis,\" she said. \"You remember Andre-Louis, madame?\"\n\nMadame checked. Andre-Louis saw the surprise ripple over her face,\ntaking with it some of her colour, leaving her for a moment breathless.\n\nAnd then the voice--the well-remembered rich, musical voice--richer and\ndeeper now than of yore, repeated his name:\n\n\"Andre-Louis!\"\n\nHer manner of uttering it suggested that it awakened memories, memories\nperhaps of the departed youth with which it was associated. And she\npaused a long moment, considering him, a little wide-eyed, what time he\nbowed before her.\n\n\"But of course I remember him,\" she said at last, and came towards\nhim, putting out her hand. He kissed it dutifully, submissively,\ninstinctively. \"And this is what you have grown into?\" She appraised\nhim, and he flushed with pride at the satisfaction in her tone. He\nseemed to have gone back sixteen years, and to be again the little\nBreton lad at Gavrillac. She turned to Aline. \"How mistaken Quintin was\nin his assumptions. He was pleased to see him again, was he not?\"\n\n\"So pleased, madame, that he has shown me the door,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"Ah!\" She frowned, conning him still with those dark, wistful eyes of\nhers. \"We must change that, Aline. He is of course very angry with\nyou. But it is not the way to make converts. I will plead for you,\nAndre-Louis. I am a good advocate.\"\n\nHe thanked her and took his leave.\n\n\"I leave my case in your hands with gratitude. My homage, madame.\"\n\nAnd so it happened that in spite of his godfather's forbidding reception\nof him, the fragment of a song was on his lips as his yellow chaise\nwhirled him back to Paris and the Rue du Hasard. That meeting with Mme.\nde Plougastel had enheartened him; her promise to plead his case in\nalliance with Aline gave him assurance that all would be well.\n\nThat he was justified of this was proved when on the following Thursday\ntowards noon his academy was invaded by M. de Kercadiou. Gilles, the\nboy, brought him word of it, and breaking off at once the lesson upon\nwhich he was engaged, he pulled off his mask, and went as he was--in a\nchamois waistcoat buttoned to the chin and with his foil under his arm\nto the modest salon below, where his godfather awaited him.\n\nThe florid little Lord of Gavrillac stood almost defiantly to receive\nhim.\n\n\"I have been over-persuaded to forgive you,\" he announced aggressively,\nseeming thereby to imply that he consented to this merely so as to put\nan end to tiresome importunities.\n\nAndre-Louis was not misled. He detected a pretence adopted by the\nSeigneur so as to enable him to retreat in good order.\n\n\"My blessings on the persuaders, whoever they may have been. You restore\nme my happiness, monsieur my godfather.\"\n\nHe took the hand that was proffered and kissed it, yielding to the\nimpulse of the unfailing habit of his boyish days. It was an act\nsymbolical of his complete submission, reestablishing between himself\nand his godfather the bond of protected and protector, with all the\nmutual claims and duties that it carries. No mere words could more\ncompletely have made his peace with this man who loved him.\n\nM. de Kercadiou's face flushed a deeper pink, his lip trembled, and\nthere was a huskiness in the voice that murmured \"My dear boy!\" Then he\nrecollected himself, threw back his great head and frowned. His voice\nresumed its habitual shrillness. \"You realize, I hope, that you have\nbehaved damnably... damnably, and with the utmost ingratitude?\"\n\n\"Does not that depend upon the point of view?\" quoth Andre-Louis, but\nhis tone was studiously conciliatory.\n\n\"It depends upon a fact, and not upon any point of view. Since I have\nbeen persuaded to overlook it, I trust that at least you have some\nintention of reforming.\"\n\n\"I... I will abstain from politics,\" said Andre-Louis, that being the\nutmost he could say with truth.\n\n\"That is something, at least.\" His godfather permitted himself to be\nmollified, now that a concession--or a seeming concession--had been made\nto his just resentment.\n\n\"A chair, monsieur.\"\n\n\"No, no. I have come to carry you off to pay a visit with me. You owe\nit entirely to Mme. de Plougastel that I consent to receive you again. I\ndesire that you come with me to thank her.\"\n\n\"I have my engagements here...\" began Andre-Louis, and then broke off.\n\"No matter! I will arrange it. A moment.\" And he was turning away to\nreenter the academy.\n\n\"What are your engagements? You are not by chance a fencing-instructor?\"\nM. de Kercadiou had observed the leather waistcoat and the foil tucked\nunder Andre-Louis' arm.\n\n\"I am the master of this academy--the academy of the late Bertrand des\nAmis, the most flourishing school of arms in Paris to-day.\"\n\nM. de Kercadiou's brows went up.\n\n\"And you are master of it?\"\n\n\"Maitre en fait d'Armes. I succeeded to the academy upon the death of\ndes Amis.\"\n\nHe left M. Kercadiou to think it over, and went to make his arrangements\nand effect the necessary changes in his toilet.\n\n\"So that is why you have taken to wearing a sword,\" said M. de\nKercadiou, as they climbed into his waiting carriage.\n\n\"That and the need to guard one's self in these times.\"\n\n\"And do you mean to tell me that a man who lives by what is after all\nan honourable profession, a profession mainly supported by the nobility,\ncan at the same time associate himself with these peddling attorneys and\nlow pamphleteers who are spreading dissension and insubordination?\"\n\n\"You forget that I am a peddling attorney myself, made so by your own\nwishes, monsieur.\"\n\nM. de Kercadiou grunted, and took snuff. \"You say the academy\nflourishes?\" he asked presently.\n\n\"It does. I have two assistant instructors. I could employ a third. It\nis hard work.\"\n\n\"That should mean that your circumstances are affluent.\"\n\n\"I have reason to be satisfied. I have far more than I need.\"\n\n\"Then you'll be able to do your share in paying off this national debt,\"\ngrowled the nobleman, well content that--as he conceived it--some of the\nevil Andre-Louis had helped to sow should recoil upon him.\n\nThen the talk veered to Mme. de Plougastel. M. de Kercadiou, Andre-Louis\ngathered, but not the reason for it, disapproved most strongly of this\nvisit. But then Madame la Comtesse was a headstrong woman whom there was\nno denying, whom all the world obeyed. M. de Plougastel was at present\nabsent in Germany, but would shortly be returning. It was an indiscreet\nadmission from which it was easy to infer that M. de Plougastel was one\nof those intriguing emissaries who came and went between the Queen of\nFrance and her brother, the Emperor of Austria.\n\nThe carriage drew up before a handsome hotel in the Faubourg\nSaint-Denis, at the corner of the Rue Paradis, and they were ushered by\na sleek servant into a little boudoir, all gilt and brocade, that opened\nupon a terrace above a garden that was a park in miniature. Here madame\nawaited them. She rose, dismissing the young person who had been reading\nto her, and came forward with both hands outheld to greet her cousin\nKercadiou.\n\n\"I almost feared you would not keep your word,\" she said. \"It was\nunjust. But then I hardly hoped that you would succeed in bringing\nhim.\" And her glance, gentle, and smiling welcome upon him, indicated\nAndre-Louis.\n\nThe young man made answer with formal gallantry.\n\n\"The memory of you, madame, is too deeply imprinted on my heart for any\npersuasions to have been necessary.\"\n\n\"Ah, the courtier!\" said madame, and abandoned him her hand. \"We are to\nhave a little talk, Andre-Louis,\" she informed him, with a gravity that\nleft him vaguely ill at ease.\n\nThey sat down, and for a while the conversation was of general matters,\nchiefly concerned, however, with Andre-Louis, his occupations and his\nviews. And all the while madame was studying him attentively with those\ngentle, wistful eyes, until again that sense of uneasiness began to\npervade him. He realized instinctively that he had been brought here for\nsome purpose deeper than that which had been avowed.\n\nAt last, as if the thing were concerted--and the clumsy Lord of Gavrillac\nwas the last man in the world to cover his tracks--his godfather rose\nand, upon a pretext of desiring to survey the garden, sauntered through\nthe windows on to the terrace, over whose white stone balustrade the\ngeraniums trailed in a scarlet riot. Thence he vanished among the\nfoliage below.\n\n\"Now we can talk more intimately,\" said madame. \"Come here, and sit\nbeside me.\" She indicated the empty half of the settee she occupied.\n\nAndre-Louis went obediently, but a little uncomfortably. \"You know,\" she\nsaid gently, placing a hand upon his arm, \"that you have behaved very\nill, that your godfather's resentment is very justly founded?\"\n\n\"Madame, if I knew that, I should be the most unhappy, the most\ndespairing of men.\" And he explained himself, as he had explained\nhimself on Sunday to his godfather. \"What I did, I did because it was\nthe only means to my hand in a country in which justice was paralyzed by\nPrivilege to make war upon an infamous scoundrel who had killed my best\nfriend--a wanton, brutal act of murder, which there was no law to punish.\nAnd as if that were not enough--forgive me if I speak with the utmost\nfrankness, madame--he afterwards debauched the woman I was to have\nmarried.\"\n\n\"Ah, mon Dieu!\" she cried out.\n\n\"Forgive me. I know that it is horrible. You perceive, perhaps, what\nI suffered, how I came to be driven. That last affair of which I\nam guilty--the riot that began in the Feydau Theatre and afterwards\nenveloped the whole city of Nantes--was provoked by this.\"\n\n\"Who was she, this girl?\"\n\nIt was like a woman, he thought, to fasten upon the unessential.\n\n\"Oh, a theatre girl, a poor fool of whom I have no regrets. La Binet was\nher name. I was a player at the time in her father's troupe. That was\nafter the Rennes business, when it was necessary to hide from such\njustice as exists in France--the gallows' justice for unfortunates\nwho are not 'born.' This added wrong led me to provoke a riot in the\ntheatre.\"\n\n\"Poor boy,\" she said tenderly. \"Only a woman's heart can realize what\nyou must have suffered; and because of that I can so readily forgive\nyou. But now...\"\n\n\"Ah, but you don't understand, madame. If to-day I thought that I had\nnone but personal grounds for having lent a hand in the holy work\nof abolishing Privilege, I think I should cut my throat. My true\njustification lies in the insincerity of those who intended that the\nconvocation of the States General should be a sham, mere dust in the\neyes of the nation.\"\n\n\"Was it not, perhaps, wise to have been insincere in such a matter?\"\n\nHe looked at her blankly.\n\n\"Can it ever be wise, madame, to be insincere?\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed it can; believe me, who am twice your age, and know my\nworld.\"\n\n\"I should say, madame, that nothing is wise that complicates existence;\nand I know of nothing that so complicates it as insincerity. Consider a\nmoment the complications that have arisen out of this.\"\n\n\"But surely, Andre-Louis, your views have not been so perverted that you\ndo not see that a governing class is a necessity in any country?\"\n\n\"Why, of course. But not necessarily a hereditary one.\"\n\n\"What else?\"\n\nHe answered her with an epigram. \"Man, madame, is the child of his own\nwork. Let there be no inheriting of rights but from such a parent. Thus\na nation's best will always predominate, and such a nation will achieve\ngreatly.\"\n\n\"But do you account birth of no importance?\"\n\n\"Of none, madame--or else my own might trouble me.\" From the deep flush\nthat stained her face, he feared that he had offended by what was almost\nan indelicacy. But the reproof that he was expecting did not come.\nInstead--\n\n\"And does it not?\" she asked. \"Never, Andre?\"\n\n\"Never, madame. I am content.\"\n\n\"You have never... never regretted your lack of parents' care?\"\n\nHe laughed, sweeping aside her sweet charitable concern that was so\nsuperfluous. \"On the contrary, madame, I tremble to think what they\nmight have made of me, and I am grateful to have had the fashioning of\nmyself.\"\n\nShe looked at him for a moment very sadly, and then, smiling, gently\nshook her head.\n\n\"You do not want self-satisfaction... Yet I could wish that you saw\nthings differently, Andre. It is a moment of great opportunities for\na young man of talent and spirit. I could help you; I could help you,\nperhaps, to go very far if you would permit yourself to be helped after\nmy fashion.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he thought, \"help me to a halter by sending me on treasonable\nmissions to Austria on the Queen's behalf, like M. de Plougastel. That\nwould certainly end in a high position for me.\"\n\nAloud he answered more as politeness prompted. \"I am grateful, madame.\nBut you will see that, holding the ideals I have expressed, I could not\nserve any cause that is opposed to their realization.\"\n\n\"You are misled by prejudice, Andre-Louis, by personal grievances. Will\nyou allow them to stand in the way of your advancement?\"\n\n\"If what I call ideals were really prejudices, would it be honest of me\nto run counter to them whilst holding them?\"\n\n\"If I could convince you that you are mistaken! I could help you so much\nto find a worthy employment for the talents you possess. In the\nservice of the King you would prosper quickly. Will you think of it,\nAndre-Louis, and let us talk of this again?\"\n\nHe answered her with formal, chill politeness.\n\n\"I fear that it would be idle, madame. Yet your interest in me is very\nflattering, and I thank you. It is unfortunate for me that I am so\nheadstrong.\"\n\n\"And now who deals in insincerity?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Ah, but you see, madame, it is an insincerity that does not mislead.\"\n\nAnd then M. de Kercadiou came in through the window again, and announced\nfussily that he must be getting back to Meudon, and that he would take\nhis godson with him and set him down at the Rue du Hasard.\n\n\"You must bring him again, Quintin,\" the Countess said, as they took\ntheir leave of her.\n\n\"Some day, perhaps,\" said M. de Kercadiou vaguely, and swept his godson\nout.\n\nIn the carriage he asked him bluntly of what madame had talked.\n\n\"She was very kind--a sweet woman,\" said Andre-Louis pensively.\n\n\"Devil take you, I didn't ask you the opinion that you presume to have\nformed of her. I asked you what she said to you.\"\n\n\"She strove to point out to me the error of my ways. She spoke of great\nthings that I might do--to which she would very kindly help me--if I were\nto come to my senses. But as miracles do not happen, I gave her little\nencouragement to hope.\"\n\n\"I see. I see. Did she say anything else?\"\n\nHe was so peremptory that Andre-Louis turned to look at him.\n\n\"What else did you expect her to say, monsieur my godfather?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.\"\n\n\"Then she fulfilled your expectations.\"\n\n\"Eh? Oh, a thousand devils, why can't you express yourself in a sensible\nmanner that a plain man can understand without having to think about\nit?\"\n\nHe sulked after that most of the way to the Rue du Hasard, or so it\nseemed to Andre-Louis. At least he sat silent, gloomily thoughtful to\njudge by his expression.\n\n\"You may come and see us soon again at Meudon,\" he told Andre-Louis at\nparting. \"But please remember--no revolutionary politics in future, if we\nare to remain friends.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. POLITICIANS\n\nOne morning in August the academy in the Rue du Hasard was invaded by Le\nChapelier accompanied by a man of remarkable appearance, whose\nherculean stature and disfigured countenance seemed vaguely familiar\nto Andre-Louis. He was a man of little, if anything, over thirty, with\nsmall bright eyes buried in an enormous face. His cheek-bones were\nprominent, his nose awry, as if it had been broken by a blow, and his\nmouth was rendered almost shapeless by the scars of another injury. (A\nbull had horned him in the face when he was but a lad.) As if that were\nnot enough to render his appearance terrible, his cheeks were deeply\npock-marked. He was dressed untidily in a long scarlet coat that\ndescended almost to his ankles, soiled buckskin breeches and boots with\nreversed tops. His shirt, none too clean, was open at the throat, the\ncollar hanging limply over an unknotted cravat, displaying fully the\nmuscular neck that rose like a pillar from his massive shoulders. He\nswung a cane that was almost a club in his left hand, and there was a\ncockade in his biscuit-coloured, conical hat. He carried himself with an\naggressive, masterful air, that great head of his thrown back as if he\nwere eternally at defiance.\n\nLe Chapelier, whose manner was very grave, named him to Andre-Louis.\n\n\"This is M. Danton, a brother-lawyer, President of the Cordeliers, of\nwhom you will have heard.\"\n\nOf course Andre-Louis had heard of him. Who had not, by then?\n\nLooking at him now with interest, Andre-Louis wondered how it came that\nall, or nearly all the leading innovators, were pock-marked. Mirabeau,\nthe journalist Desmoulins, the philanthropist Marat, Robespierre the\nlittle lawyer from Arras, this formidable fellow Danton, and several\nothers he could call to mind all bore upon them the scars of smallpox.\nAlmost he began to wonder was there any connection between the two.\nDid an attack of smallpox produce certain moral results which found\nexpression in this way?\n\nHe dismissed the idle speculation, or rather it was shattered by the\nstartling thunder of Danton's voice.\n\n\"This ------ Chapelier has told me of you. He says that you are a patriotic\n------.\"\n\nMore than by the tone was Andre-Louis startled by the obscenities with\nwhich the Colossus did not hesitate to interlard his first speech to a\ntotal stranger. He laughed outright. There was nothing else to do.\n\n\"If he has told you that, he has told you more than the truth! I am a\npatriot. The rest my modesty compels me to disavow.\"\n\n\"You're a joker too, it seems,\" roared the other, but he laughed\nnevertheless, and the volume of it shook the windows. \"There's no\noffence in me. I am like that.\"\n\n\"What a pity,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\nIt disconcerted the king of the markets. \"Eh? what's this, Chapelier?\nDoes he give himself airs, your friend here?\"\n\nThe spruce Breton, a very petit-maitre in appearance by contrast with\nhis companion, but nevertheless of a down-right manner quite equal to\nDanton's in brutality, though dispensing with the emphasis of foulness,\nshrugged as he answered him:\n\n\"It is merely that he doesn't like your manners, which is not at all\nsurprising. They are execrable.\"\n\n\"Ah, bah! You are all like that, you ------ Bretons. Let's come to\nbusiness. You'll have heard what took place in the Assembly yesterday?\nYou haven't? My God, where do you live? Have you heard that this\nscoundrel who calls himself King of France gave passage across French\nsoil the other day to Austrian troops going to crush those who fight for\nliberty in Belgium? Have you heard that, by any chance?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Andre-Louis coldly, masking his irritation before the\nother's hectoring manner. \"I have heard that.\"\n\n\"Oh! And what do you think of it?\" Arms akimbo, the Colossus towered\nabove him.\n\nAndre-Louis turned aside to Le Chapelier.\n\n\"I don't think I understand. Have you brought this gentleman here to\nexamine my conscience?\"\n\n\"Name of a name! He's prickly as a ------ porcupine!\" Danton protested.\n\n\"No, no.\" Le Chapelier was conciliatory, seeking to provide an antidote\nto the irritant administered by his companion. \"We require your help,\nAndre. Danton here thinks that you are the very man for us. Listen\nnow...\"\n\n\"That's it. You tell him,\" Danton agreed. \"You both talk the same\nmincing--sort of French. He'll probably understand you.\"\n\nLe Chapelier went on without heeding the interruption. \"This violation\nby the King of the obvious rights of a country engaged in framing a\nconstitution that shall make it free has shattered every philanthropic\nillusion we still cherished. There are those who go so far as to\nproclaim the King the vowed enemy of France. But that, of course, is\nexcessive.\"\n\n\"Who says so?\" blazed Danton, and swore horribly by way of conveying his\ntotal disagreement.\n\nLe Chapelier waved him into silence, and proceeded.\n\n\"Anyhow, the matter has been more than enough, added to all the rest,\nto set us by the ears again in the Assembly. It is open war between the\nThird Estate and the Privileged.\"\n\n\"Was it ever anything else?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not; but it has assumed a new character. You'll have heard of\nthe duel between Lameth and the Duc de Castries?\"\n\n\"A trifling affair.\"\n\n\"In its results. But it might have been far other. Mirabeau is\nchallenged and insulted now at every sitting. But he goes his way,\ncold-bloodedly wise. Others are not so circumspect; they meet insult\nwith insult, blow with blow, and blood is being shed in private duels.\nThe thing is reduced by these swordsmen of the nobility to a system.\"\n\nAndre-Louis nodded. He was thinking of Philippe de Vilmorin. \"Yes,\" he\nsaid, \"it is an old trick of theirs. It is so simple and direct--like\nthemselves. I wonder only that they didn't hit upon this system sooner.\nIn the early days of the States General, at Versailles, it might have\nhad a better effect. Now, it comes a little late.\"\n\n\"But they mean to make up for lost time--sacred name!\" cried Danton.\n\"Challenges are flying right and left between these bully-swordsmen,\nthese spadassinicides, and poor devils of the robe who have never learnt\nto fence with anything but a quill. It's just ------ murder. Yet if I were\nto go amongst messieurs les nobles and crunch an addled head or two with\nthis stick of mine, snap a few aristocratic necks between these fingers\nwhich the good God has given me for the purpose, the law would send\nme to atone upon the gallows. This in a land that is striving after\nliberty. Why, Dieu me damne! I am not even allowed to keep my hat on in\nthe theatre. But they ------ these ------s!\"\n\n\"He is right,\" said Le Chapelier. \"The thing has become unendurable,\ninsufferable. Two days ago M. d'Ambly threatened Mirabeau with his\ncane before the whole Assembly. Yesterday M. de Faussigny leapt up and\nharangued his order by inviting murder. 'Why don't we fall on these\nscoundrels, sword in hand?' he asked. Those were his very words: 'Why\ndon't we fall on these scoundrels, sword in hand.'\"\n\n\"It is so much simpler than lawmaking,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"Lagron, the deputy from Ancenis in the Loire, said something that\nwe did not hear in answer. As he was leaving the Manege one of these\nbullies grossly insulted him. Lagron no more than used his elbow to push\npast when the fellow cried out that he had been struck, and issued his\nchallenge. They fought this morning early in the Champs Elysees, and\nLagron was killed, run through the stomach deliberately by a man who\nfought like a fencing-master, and poor Lagron did not even own a sword.\nHe had to borrow one to go to the assignation.\"\n\nAndre-Louis--his mind ever on Vilmorin, whose case was here repeated,\neven to the details--was swept by a gust of passion. He clenched his\nhands, and his jaws set. Danton's little eyes observed him keenly.\n\n\"Well? And what do you think of that? Noblesse oblige, eh? The thing is\nwe must oblige them too, these -------s. We must pay them back in the\nsame coin; meet them with the same weapons. Abolish them; tumble these\nassassinateurs into the abyss of nothingness by the same means.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"How? Name of God! Haven't I said it?\"\n\n\"That is where we require your help,\" Le Chapelier put in. \"There must\nbe men of patriotic feeling among the more advanced of your pupils.\nM. Danton's idea is that a little band of these--say a half-dozen, with\nyourself at their head--might read these bullies a sharp lesson.\"\n\nAndre-Louis frowned.\n\n\"And how, precisely, had M. Danton thought that this might be done?\"\n\nM. Danton spoke for himself, vehemently.\n\n\"Why, thus: We post you in the Manege, at the hour when the Assembly is\nrising. We point out the six leading phlebotomists, and let you loose to\ninsult them before they have time to insult any of the representatives.\nThen to-morrow morning, six ------ phlebotomists themselves phlebotomized\nsecundum artem. That will give the others something to think about. It\nwill give them a great deal to think about, by ----! If necessary the dose\nmay be repeated to ensure a cure. If you kill the -------s, so much the\nbetter.\"\n\nHe paused, his sallow face flushed with the enthusiasm of his idea.\nAndre-Louis stared at him inscrutably.\n\n\"Well, what do you say to that?\"\n\n\"That it is most ingenious.\" And Andre-Louis turned aside to look out of\nthe window.\n\n\"And is that all you think of it?\"\n\n\"I will not tell you what else I think of it because you probably would\nnot understand. For you, M. Danton, there is at least this excuse that\nyou did not know me. But you, Isaac--to bring this gentleman here with\nsuch a proposal!\"\n\nLe Chapelier was overwhelmed in confusion. \"I confess I hesitated,\"\nhe apologized. \"But M. Danton would not take my word for it that the\nproposal might not be to your taste.\"\n\n\"I would not!\" Danton broke in, bellowing. He swung upon Le Chapelier,\nbrandishing his great arms. \"You told me monsieur was a patriot.\nPatriotism knows no scruples. You call this mincing dancing-master a\npatriot?\"\n\n\"Would you, monsieur, out of patriotism consent to become an assassin?\"\n\n\"Of course I would. Haven't I told you so? Haven't I told you that\nI would gladly go among them with my club, and crack them like so\nmany--fleas?\"\n\n\"Why not, then?\"\n\n\"Why not? Because I should get myself hanged. Haven't I said so?\"\n\n\"But what of that ------ being a patriot? Why not, like another Curtius,\njump into the gulf, since you believe that your country would benefit by\nyour death?\"\n\nM. Danton showed signs of exasperation. \"Because my country will benefit\nmore by my life.\"\n\n\"Permit me, monsieur, to suffer from a similar vanity.\"\n\n\"You? But where would be the danger to you? You would do your work under\nthe cloak of duelling--as they do.\"\n\n\"Have you reflected, monsieur, that the law will hardly regard a\nfencing-master who kills his opponent as an ordinary combatant,\nparticularly if it can be shown that the fencing-master himself provoked\nthe attack?\"\n\n\"So! Name of a name!\" M. Danton blew out his cheeks and delivered\nhimself with withering scorn. \"It comes to this, then: you are afraid!\"\n\n\"You may think so if you choose--that I am afraid to do slyly and\ntreacherously that which a thrasonical patriot like yourself is afraid\nof doing frankly and openly. I have other reasons. But that one should\nsuffice you.\"\n\nDanton gasped. Then he swore more amazingly and variedly than ever.\n\n\"By ----! you are right,\" he admitted, to Andre-Louis' amazement. \"You\nare right, and I am wrong. I am as bad a patriot as you are, and I am\na coward as well.\" And he invoked the whole Pantheon to witness his\nself-denunciation. \"Only, you see, I count for something: and if they\ntake me and hang me, why, there it is! Monsieur, we must find some other\nway. Forgive the intrusion. Adieu!\" He held out his enormous hand..\n\nLe Chapelier stood hesitating, crestfallen.\n\n\"You understand, Andre? I am sorry that...\"\n\n\"Say no more, please. Come and see me soon again. I would press you to\nremain, but it is striking nine, and the first of my pupils is about to\narrive.\"\n\n\"Nor would I permit it,\" said Danton. \"Between us we must resolve the\nriddle of how to extinguish M. de La Tour d'Azyr and his friends.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nSharp as a pistol-shot came that question, as Danton was turning away.\nThe tone of it brought him up short. He turned again, Le Chapelier with\nhim.\n\n\"I said M. de La Tour d'Azyr.\"\n\n\"What has he to do with the proposal you were making me?\"\n\n\"He? Why, he is the phlebotomist in chief.\"\n\nAnd Le Chapelier added. \"It is he who killed Lagron.\"\n\n\"Not a friend of yours, is he?\" wondered Danton.\n\n\"And it is La Tour d'Azyr you desire me to kill?\" asked Andre-Louis very\nslowly, after the manner of one whose thoughts are meanwhile pondering\nthe subject.\n\n\"That's it,\" said Danton. \"And not a job for a prentice hand, I can\nassure you.\"\n\n\"Ah, but this alters things,\" said Andre-Louis, thinking aloud. \"It\noffers a great temptation.\"\n\n\"Why, then...?\" The Colossus took a step towards him again.\n\n\"Wait!\" He put up his hand. Then with chin sunk on his breast, he paced\naway to the window, musing.\n\nLe Chapelier and Danton exchanged glances, then watched him, waiting,\nwhat time he considered.\n\nAt first he almost wondered why he should not of his own accord have\ndecided upon some such course as this to settle that long-standing\naccount of M. de La Tour d'Azyr. What was the use of this great skill in\nfence that he had come to acquire, unless he could turn it to account\nto avenge Vilmorin, and to make Aline safe from the lure of her own\nambition? It would be an easy thing to seek out La Tour d'Azyr, put a\nmortal affront upon him, and thus bring him to the point. To-day this\nwould be murder, murder as treacherous as that which La Tour d'Azyr\nhad done upon Philippe de Vilmorin; for to-day the old positions were\nreversed, and it was Andre-Louis who might go to such an assignation\nwithout a doubt of the issue. It was a moral obstacle of which he made\nshort work. But there remained the legal obstacle he had expounded to\nDanton. There was still a law in France; the same law which he had\nfound it impossible to move against La Tour d'Azyr, but which would move\nbriskly enough against himself in like case. And then, suddenly, as if\nby inspiration, he saw the way--a way which if adopted would probably\nbring La Tour d'Azyr to a poetic justice, bring him, insolent,\nconfident, to thrust himself upon Andre-Louis' sword, with all the odium\nof provocation on his own side.\n\nHe turned to them again, and they saw that he was very pale, that his\ngreat dark eyes glowed oddly.\n\n\"There will probably be some difficulty in finding a suppleant for this\npoor Lagron,\" he said. \"Our fellow-countrymen will be none so eager to\noffer themselves to the swords of Privilege.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" said Le Chapelier gloomily; and then, as if suddenly\nleaping to the thing in Andre-Louis' mind: \"Andre!\" he cried. \"Would\nyou...\"\n\n\"It is what I was considering. It would give me a legitimate place in\nthe Assembly. If your Tour d'Azyrs choose to seek me out then, why,\ntheir blood be upon their own heads. I shall certainly do nothing to\ndiscourage them.\" He smiled curiously. \"I am just a rascal who tries to\nbe honest--Scaramouche always, in fact; a creature of sophistries. Do you\nthink that Ancenis would have me for its representative?\"\n\n\"Will it have Omnes Omnibus for its representative?\" Le Chapelier was\nlaughing, his countenance eager. \"Ancenis will be convulsed with pride.\nIt is not Rennes or Nantes, as it might have been had you wished it. But\nit gives you a voice for Brittany.\"\n\n\"I should have to go to Ancenis...\"\n\n\"No need at all. A letter from me to the Municipality, and the\nMunicipality will confirm you at once. No need to move from here. In a\nfortnight at most the thing can be accomplished. It is settled, then?\"\n\nAndre-Louis considered yet a moment. There was his academy. But he could\nmake arrangements with Le Duc and Galoche to carry it on for him\nwhilst himself directing and advising. Le Duc, after all, was become a\nthoroughly efficient master, and he was a trustworthy fellow. At need a\nthird assistant could be engaged.\n\n\"Be it so,\" he said at last.\n\nLe Chapelier clasped hands with him and became congratulatorily voluble,\nuntil interrupted by the red-coated giant at the door.\n\n\"What exactly does it mean to our business, anyway?\" he asked. \"Does it\nmean that when you are a representative you will not scruple to skewer\nM. le Marquis?\"\n\n\"If M. le Marquis should offer himself to be skewered, as he no doubt\nwill.\"\n\n\"I perceive the distinction,\" said M. Danton, and sneered. \"You've an\ningenious mind.\" He turned to Le Chapelier. \"What did you say he was to\nbegin with--a lawyer, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was a lawyer, and afterwards a mountebank.\"\n\n\"And this is the result!\"\n\n\"As you say. And do you know that we are after all not so dissimilar,\nyou and I?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Once like you I went about inciting other people to go and kill the man\nI wanted dead. You'll say I was a coward, of course.\"\n\nLe Chapelier prepared to slip between them as the clouds gathered on\nthe giant's brow. Then these were dispelled again, and the great laugh\nvibrated through the long room.\n\n\"You've touched me for the second time, and in the same place. Oh,\nyou can fence, my lad. We should be friends. Rue des Cordeliers is my\naddress. Any--scoundrel will tell you where Danton lodges. Desmoulins\nlives underneath. Come and visit us one evening. There's always a bottle\nfor a friend.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE SPADASSINICIDES\n\nAfter an absence of rather more than a week, M. le Marquis de La Tour\nd'Azyr was back in his place on the Cote Droit of the National Assembly.\nProperly speaking, we should already at this date allude to him as the\nci-devant Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr, for the time was September of 1790,\ntwo months after the passing--on the motion of that downright Breton\nleveller, Le Chapelier--of the decree that nobility should no more be\nhereditary than infamy; that just as the brand of the gallows must not\ndefile the possibly worthy descendants of one who had been convicted\nof evil, neither should the blazon advertising achievement glorify the\npossibly unworthy descendants of one who had proved himself good. And so\nthe decree had been passed abolishing hereditary nobility and consigning\nfamily escutcheons to the rubbish-heap of things no longer to be\ntolerated by an enlightened generation of philosophers. M. le Comte de\nLafayette, who had supported the motion, left the Assembly as plain M.\nMotier, the great tribune Count Mirabeau became plain M. Riquetti, and\nM. le Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr just simple M. Lesarques. The thing was\ndone in one of those exaltations produced by the approach of the great\nNational Festival of the Champ de Mars, and no doubt it was thoroughly\nrepented on the morrow by those who had lent themselves to it. Thus,\nalthough law by now, it was a law that no one troubled just yet to\nenforce.\n\nThat, however, is by the way. The time, as I have said, was September,\nthe day dull and showery, and some of the damp and gloom of it seemed to\nhave penetrated the long Hall of the Manege, where on their eight rows\nof green benches elliptically arranged in ascending tiers about\nthe space known as La Piste, sat some eight or nine hundred of the\nrepresentatives of the three orders that composed the nation.\n\nThe matter under debate by the constitution-builders was whether the\ndeliberating body to succeed the Constituent Assembly should work in\nconjunction with the King, whether it should be periodic or permanent,\nwhether it should govern by two chambers or by one.\n\nThe Abbe Maury, son of a cobbler, and therefore in these days of\nantitheses orator-in-chief of the party of the Right--the Blacks, as\nthose who fought Privilege's losing battles were known--was in the\ntribune. He appeared to be urging the adoption of a two-chambers system\nframed on the English model. He was, if anything, more long-winded and\nprosy even than his habit; his arguments assumed more and more the form\nof a sermon; the tribune of the National Assembly became more and\nmore like a pulpit; but the members, conversely, less and less like\na congregation. They grew restive under that steady flow of pompous\nverbiage, and it was in vain that the four ushers in black satin\nbreeches and carefully powdered heads, chain of office on their breasts,\ngilded sword at their sides, circulated in the Piste, clapping their\nhands, and hissing,\n\n\"Silence! En place!\"\n\nEqually vain was the intermittent ringing of the bell by the president\nat his green-covered table facing the tribune. The Abbe Maury had\ntalked too long, and for some time had failed to interest the members.\nRealizing it at last, he ceased, whereupon the hum of conversation\nbecame general. And then it fell abruptly. There was a silence of\nexpectancy, and a turning of heads, a craning of necks. Even the group\nof secretaries at the round table below the president's dais roused\nthemselves from their usual apathy to consider this young man who was\nmounting the tribune of the Assembly for the first time.\n\n\"M. Andre-Louis Moreau, deputy suppleant, vice Emmanuel Lagron,\ndeceased, for Ancenis in the Department of the Loire.\"\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr shook himself out of the gloomy abstraction in\nwhich he had sat. The successor of the deputy he had slain must, in\nany event, be an object of grim interest to him. You conceive how that\ninterest was heightened when he heard him named, when, looking across,\nhe recognized indeed in this Andre-Louis Moreau the young scoundrel who\nwas continually crossing his path, continually exerting against him a\ndeep-moving, sinister influence to make him regret that he should have\nspared his life that day at Gavrillac two years ago. That he should thus\nhave stepped into the shoes of Lagron seemed to M. de La Tour d'Azyr too\napt for mere coincidence, a direct challenge in itself.\n\nHe looked at the young man in wonder rather than in anger, and looking\nat him he was filled by a vague, almost a premonitory, uneasiness.\n\nAt the very outset, the presence which in itself he conceived to be a\nchallenge was to demonstrate itself for this in no equivocal terms.\n\n\"I come before you,\" Andre-Louis began, \"as a deputy-suppleant to fill\nthe place of one who was murdered some three weeks ago.\"\n\nIt was a challenging opening that instantly provoked an indignant outcry\nfrom the Blacks. Andre-Louis paused, and looked at them, smiling a\nlittle, a singularly self-confident young man.\n\n\"The gentlemen of the Right, M. le President, do not appear to like\nmy words. But that is not surprising. The gentlemen of the Right\nnotoriously do not like the truth.\"\n\nThis time there was uproar. The members of the Left roared with\nlaughter, those of the Right thundered menacingly. The ushers circulated\nat a pace beyond their usual, agitated themselves, clapped their hands,\nand called in vain for silence.\n\nThe President rang his bell.\n\nAbove the general din came the voice of La Tour d'Azyr, who had\nhalf-risen from his seat: \"Mountebank! This is not the theatre!\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, it is becoming a hunting-ground for bully-swordsmen,\" was\nthe answer, and the uproar grew.\n\nThe deputy-suppleant looked round and waited. Near at hand he met the\nencouraging grin of Le Chapelier, and the quiet, approving smile of\nKersain, another Breton deputy of his acquaintance. A little farther off\nhe saw the great head of Mirabeau thrown back, the great eyes regarding\nhim from under a frown in a sort of wonder, and yonder, among all\nthat moving sea of faces, the sallow countenance of the Arras' lawyer\nRobespierre--or de Robespierre, as the little snob now called himself,\nhaving assumed the aristocratic particle as the prerogative of a man of\nhis distinction in the councils of his country. With his tip-tilted nose\nin the air, his carefully curled head on one side, the deputy for Arras\nwas observing Andre-Louis attentively. The horn-rimmed spectacles he\nused for reading were thrust up on to his pale forehead, and it was\nthrough a levelled spy-glass that he considered the speaker, his\nthin-lipped mouth stretched a little in that tiger-cat smile that was\nafterwards to become so famous and so feared.\n\nGradually the uproar wore itself out, and diminished so that at last\nthe President could make himself heard. Leaning forward, he gravely\naddressed the young man in the tribune:\n\n\"Monsieur, if you wish to be heard, let me beg of you not to be\nprovocative in your language.\" And then to the others: \"Messieurs, if\nwe are to proceed, I beg that you will restrain your feelings until the\ndeputy-suppleant has concluded his discourse.\"\n\n\"I shall endeavour to obey, M. le President, leaving provocation to the\ngentlemen of the Right. If the few words I have used so far have been\nprovocative, I regret it. But it was necessary that I should refer to\nthe distinguished deputy whose place I come so unworthily to fill, and\nit was unavoidable that I should refer to the event which has procured\nus this sad necessity. The deputy Lagron was a man of singular nobility\nof mind, a selfless, dutiful, zealous man, inflamed by the high purpose\nof doing his duty by his electors and by this Assembly. He possessed\nwhat his opponents would call a dangerous gift of eloquence.\"\n\nLa Tour d'Azyr writhed at the well-known phrase--his own phrase--the\nphrase that he had used to explain his action in the matter of Philippe\nde Vilmorin, the phrase that from time to time had been cast in his\nteeth with such vindictive menace.\n\nAnd then the crisp voice of the witty Canales, that very rapier of the\nPrivileged party, cut sharply into the speaker's momentary pause.\n\n\"M. le President,\" he asked with great solemnity, \"has the\ndeputy-suppleant mounted the tribune for the purpose of taking part in\nthe debate on the constitution of the legislative assemblies, or for\nthe purpose of pronouncing a funeral oration upon the departed deputy\nLagron?\"\n\nThis time it was the Blacks who gave way to mirth, until checked by the\ndeputy-suppleant.\n\n\"That laughter is obscene!\" In this truly Gallic fashion he flung his\nglove into the face of Privilege, determined, you see, upon no half\nmeasures; and the rippling laughter perished on the instant quenched in\nspeechless fury.\n\nSolemnly he proceeded.\n\n\"You all know how Lagron died. To refer to his death at all requires\ncourage, to laugh in referring to it requires something that I will not\nattempt to qualify. If I have alluded to his decease, it is because my\nown appearance among you seemed to render some such allusion necessary.\nIt is mine to take up the burden which he set down. I do not pretend\nthat I have the strength, the courage, or the wisdom of Lagron; but with\nevery ounce of such strength and courage and wisdom as I possess that\nburden will I bear. And I trust, for the sake of those who might attempt\nit, that the means taken to impose silence upon that eloquent voice will\nnot be taken to impose silence upon mine.\"\n\nThere was a faint murmur of applause from the Left, splutter of\ncontemptuous laughter from the Right.\n\n\"Rhodomont!\" a voice called to him.\n\nHe looked in the direction of that voice, proceeding from the group of\nspadassins amid the Blacks across the Piste, and he smiled. Inaudibly\nhis lips answered:\n\n\"No, my friend--Scaramouche; Scaramouche, the subtle, dangerous fellow\nwho goes tortuously to his ends.\" Aloud, he resumed: \"M. le President,\nthere are those who will not understand that the purpose for which\nwe are assembled here is the making of laws by which France may be\nequitably governed, by which France may be lifted out of the morass of\nbankruptcy into which she is in danger of sinking. For there are some\nwho want, it seems, not laws, but blood; I solemnly warn them that this\nblood will end by choking them, if they do not learn in time to discard\nforce and allow reason to prevail.\"\n\nAgain in that phrase there was something that stirred a memory in\nLa Tour d'Azyr. He turned in the fresh uproar to speak to his cousin\nChabrillane who sat beside him.\n\n\"A daring rogue, this bastard of Gavrillac's,\" said he.\n\nChabrillane looked at him with gleaming eyes, his face white with anger.\n\n\"Let him talk himself out. I don't think he will be heard again after\nto-day. Leave this to me.\"\n\nHardly could La Tour have told you why, but he sank back in his seat\nwith a sense of relief. He had been telling himself that here was matter\ndemanding action, a challenge that he must take up. But despite his rage\nhe felt a singular unwillingness. This fellow had a trick of reminding\nhim, he supposed, too unpleasantly of that young abbe done to death in\nthe garden behind the Breton arme at Gavrillac. Not that the death of\nPhilippe de Vilmorin lay heavily upon M. de La Tour d'Azyr's conscience.\nHe had accounted himself fully justified of his action. It was that the\nwhole thing as his memory revived it for him made an unpleasant picture:\nthat distraught boy kneeling over the bleeding body of the friend he\nhad loved, and almost begging to be slain with him, dubbing the Marquis\nmurderer and coward to incite him.\n\nMeanwhile, leaving now the subject of the death of Lagron, the\ndeputy-suppleant had at last brought himself into order, and was\nspeaking upon the question under debate. He contributed nothing of value\nto it; he urged nothing definite. His speech on the subject was very\nbrief--that being the pretext and not the purpose for which he had\nascended the tribune.\n\nWhen later he was leaving the hall at the end of the sitting, with Le\nChapelier at his side, he found himself densely surrounded by deputies\nas by a body-guard. Most of them were Bretons, who aimed at screening\nhim from the provocations which his own provocative words in the\nAssembly could not fail to bring down upon his head. For a moment the\nmassive form of Mirabeau brought up alongside of him.\n\n\"Felicitations, M. Moreau,\" said the great man. \"You acquitted yourself\nvery well. They will want your blood, no doubt. But be discreet,\nmonsieur, if I may presume to advise you, and do not allow yourself to\nbe misled by any false sense of quixotry. Ignore their challenges. I do\nso myself. I place each challenger upon my list. There are some fifty\nthere already, and there they will remain. Refuse them what they are\npleased to call satisfaction, and all will be well.\" Andre-Louis smiled\nand sighed.\n\n\"It requires courage,\" said the hypocrite.\n\n\"Of course it does. But you would appear to have plenty.\"\n\n\"Hardly enough, perhaps. But I shall do my best.\"\n\nThey had come through the vestibule, and although this was lined\nwith eager Blacks waiting for the young man who had insulted them so\nflagrantly from the rostrum, Andre-Louis' body-guard had prevented any\nof them from reaching him.\n\nEmerging now into the open, under the great awning at the head of the\nCarriere, erected to enable carriages to reach the door under cover,\nthose in front of him dispersed a little, and there was a moment as he\nreached the limit of the awning when his front was entirely uncovered.\nOutside the rain was falling heavily, churning the ground into thick\nmud, and for a moment Andre-Louis, with Le Chapelier ever at his side,\nstood hesitating to step out into the deluge.\n\nThe watchful Chabrillane had seen his chance, and by a detour that\ntook him momentarily out into the rain, he came face to face with the\ntoo-daring young Breton. Rudely, violently, he thrust Andre-Louis back,\nas if to make room for himself under the shelter.\n\nNot for a second was Andre-Louis under any delusion as to the man's\ndeliberate purpose, nor were those who stood near him, who made a\nbelated and ineffectual attempt to close about him. He was grievously\ndisappointed. It was not Chabrillane he had been expecting. His\ndisappointment was reflected on his countenance, to be mistaken for\nsomething very different by the arrogant Chevalier.\n\nBut if Chabrillane was the man appointed to deal with him, he would make\nthe best of it.\n\n\"I think you are pushing against me, monsieur,\" he said, very civilly,\nand with elbow and shoulder he thrust M. de Chabrillane back into the\nrain.\n\n\"I desire to take shelter, monsieur,\" the Chevalier hectored.\n\n\"You may do so without standing on my feet. I have a prejudice against\nany one standing on my feet. My feet are very tender. Perhaps you did\nnot know it, monsieur. Please say no more.\"\n\n\"Why, I wasn't speaking, you lout!\" exclaimed the Chevalier, slightly\ndiscomposed.\n\n\"Were you not? I thought perhaps you were about to apologize.\"\n\n\"Apologize?\" Chabrillane laughed. \"To you! Do you know that you are\namusing?\" He stepped under the awning for the second time, and again in\nview of all thrust Andre-Louis rudely back.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Andre-Louis, with a grimace. \"You hurt me, monsieur. I have\ntold you not to push against me.\" He raised his voice that all might\nhear him, and once more impelled M. de Chabrillane back into the rain.\n\nNow, for all his slenderness, his assiduous daily sword-practice had\ngiven Andre-Louis an arm of iron. Also he threw his weight into the\nthrust. His assailant reeled backwards a few steps, and then his\nheel struck a baulk of timber left on the ground by some workmen that\nmorning, and he sat down suddenly in the mud.\n\nA roar of laughter rose from all who witnessed the fine gentleman's\ndownfall. He rose, mud-bespattered, in a fury, and in that fury sprang\nat Andre-Louis.\n\nAndre-Louis had made him ridiculous, which was altogether unforgivable.\n\n\"You shall meet me for this!\" he spluttered. \"I shall kill you for it.\"\n\nHis inflamed face was within a foot of Andre-Louis'. Andre-Louis\nlaughed. In the silence everybody heard the laugh and the words that\nfollowed.\n\n\"Oh, is that what you wanted? But why didn't you say so before? You\nwould have spared me the trouble of knocking you down. I thought\ngentlemen of your profession invariably conducted these affairs with\ndecency, decorum, and a certain grace. Had you done so, you might have\nsaved your breeches.\"\n\n\"How soon shall we settle this?\" snapped Chabrillane, livid with very\nreal fury.\n\n\"Whenever you please, monsieur. It is for you to say when it will\nsuit your convenience to kill me. I think that was the intention you\nannounced, was it not?\" Andre-Louis was suavity itself.\n\n\"To-morrow morning, in the Bois. Perhaps you will bring a friend.\"\n\n\"Certainly, monsieur. To-morrow morning, then. I hope we shall have fine\nweather. I detest the rain.\"\n\nChabrillane looked at him almost with amazement. Andre-Louis smiled\npleasantly.\n\n\"Don't let me detain you now, monsieur. We quite understand each other.\nI shall be in the Bois at nine o'clock to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"That is too late for me, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Any other hour would be too early for me. I do not like to have my\nhabits disturbed. Nine o'clock or not at all, as you please.\"\n\n\"But I must be at the Assembly at nine, for the morning session.\"\n\n\"I am afraid, monsieur, you will have to kill me first, and I have a\nprejudice against being killed before nine o'clock.\"\n\nNow this was too complete a subversion of the usual procedure for M.\nde Chabrillane's stomach. Here was a rustic deputy assuming with him\nprecisely the tone of sinister mockery which his class usually dealt out\nto their victims of the Third Estate. And to heighten the irritation,\nAndre-Louis--the actor, Scaramouche always--produced his snuffbox, and\nproffered it with a steady hand to Le Chapelier before helping himself.\n\nChabrillane, it seemed, after all that he had suffered, was not even to\nbe allowed to make a good exit.\n\n\"Very well, monsieur,\" he said. \"Nine o'clock, then; and we'll see if\nyou'll talk as pertly afterwards.\"\n\nOn that he flung away, before the jeers of the provincial deputies. Nor\ndid it soothe his rage to be laughed at by urchins all the way down the\nRue Dauphine because of the mud and filth that dripped from his satin\nbreeches and the tails of his elegant, striped coat.\n\nBut though the members of the Third had jeered on the surface, they\ntrembled underneath with fear and indignation. It was too much. Lagron\nkilled by one of these bullies, and now his successor challenged, and\nabout to be killed by another of them on the very first day of his\nappearance to take the dead man's place. Several came now to implore\nAndre-Louis not to go to the Bois, to ignore the challenge and the whole\naffair, which was but a deliberate attempt to put him out of the way.\nHe listened seriously, shook his head gloomily, and promised at last to\nthink it over.\n\nHe was in his seat again for the afternoon session as if nothing\ndisturbed him.\n\nBut in the morning, when the Assembly met, his place was vacant, and so\nwas M. de Chabrillane's. Gloom and resentment sat upon the members\nof the Third, and brought a more than usually acrid note into their\ndebates. They disapproved of the rashness of the new recruit to their\nbody. Some openly condemned his lack of circumspection. Very few--and\nthose only the little group in Le Chapelier's confidence--ever expected\nto see him again.\n\nIt was, therefore, as much in amazement as in relief that at a few\nminutes after ten they saw him enter, calm, composed, and bland, and\nthread his way to his seat. The speaker occupying the rostrum at that\nmoment--a member of the Privileged--stopped short to stare in incredulous\ndismay. Here was something that he could not understand at all. Then\nfrom somewhere, to satisfy the amazement on both sides of the assembly,\na voice explained the phenomenon contemptuously.\n\n\"They haven't met. He has shirked it at the last moment.\"\n\nIt must be so, thought all; the mystification ceased, and men were\nsettling back into their seats. But now, having reached his place,\nhaving heard the voice that explained the matter to the universal\nsatisfaction, Andre-Louis paused before taking his seat. He felt it\nincumbent upon him to reveal the true fact.\n\n\"M. le President, my excuses for my late arrival.\" There was no\nnecessity for this. It was a mere piece of theatricality, such as it\nwas not in Scaramouche's nature to forgo. \"I have been detained by an\nengagement of a pressing nature. I bring you also the excuses of M. de\nChabrillane. He, unfortunately, will be permanently absent from this\nAssembly in future.\"\n\nThe silence was complete. Andre-Louis sat down.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE PALADIN OF THE THIRD\n\nM. Le Chevalier de Chabrillane had been closely connected, you will\nremember, with the iniquitous affair in which Philippe de Vilmorin\nhad lost his life. We know enough to justify a surmise that he had not\nmerely been La Tour d'Azyr's second in the encounter, but actually\nan instigator of the business. Andre-Louis may therefore have felt a\njustifiable satisfaction in offering up the Chevalier's life to the\nManes of his murdered friend. He may have viewed it as an act of\ncommon justice not to be procured by any other means. Also it is to\nbe remembered that Chabrillane had gone confidently to the meeting,\nconceiving that he, a practised ferailleur, had to deal with a bourgeois\nutterly unskilled in swordsmanship. Morally, then, he was little\nbetter than a murderer, and that he should have tumbled into the pit\nhe conceived that he dug for Andre-Louis was a poetic retribution.\nYet, notwithstanding all this, I should find the cynical note on which\nAndre-Louis announced the issue to the Assembly utterly detestable did\nI believe it sincere. It would justify Aline of the expressed opinion,\nwhich she held in common with so many others who had come into close\ncontact with him, that Andre-Louis was quite heartless.\n\nYou have seen something of the same heartlessness in his conduct when he\ndiscovered the faithlessness of La Binet although that is belied by the\nmeasures he took to avenge himself. His subsequent contempt of the woman\nI account to be born of the affection in which for a time he held her.\nThat this affection was as deep as he first imagined, I do not believe;\nbut that it was as shallow as he would almost be at pains to make it\nappear by the completeness with which he affects to have put her from\nhis mind when he discovered her worthlessness, I do not believe; nor,\nas I have said, do his actions encourage that belief. Then, again,\nhis callous cynicism in hoping that he had killed Binet is also an\naffectation. Knowing that such things as Binet are better out of the\nworld, he can have suffered no compunction; he had, you must remember,\nthat rarely level vision which sees things in their just proportions,\nand never either magnifies or reduces them by sentimental\nconsiderations. At the same time, that he should contemplate the\ntaking of life with such complete and cynical equanimity, whatever the\njustification, is quite incredible.\n\nSimilarly now, it is not to be believed that in coming straight from\nthe Bois de Boulogne, straight from the killing of a man, he should be\nsincerely expressing his nature in alluding to the fact in terms of such\noutrageous flippancy. Not quite to such an extent was he the incarnation\nof Scaramouche. But sufficiently was he so ever to mask his true\nfeelings by an arresting gesture, his true thoughts by an effective\nphrase. He was the actor always, a man ever calculating the effect he\nwould produce, ever avoiding self-revelation, ever concerned to overlay\nhis real character by an assumed and quite fictitious one. There was in\nthis something of impishness, and something of other things.\n\nNobody laughed now at his flippancy. He did not intend that anybody\nshould. He intended to be terrible; and he knew that the more flippant\nand casual his tone, the more terrible would be its effect. He produced\nexactly the effect he desired.\n\nWhat followed in a place where feelings and practices had become what\nthey had become is not difficult to surmise. When the session rose,\nthere were a dozen spadassins awaiting him in the vestibule, and this\ntime the men of his own party were less concerned to guard him. He\nseemed so entirely capable of guarding himself; he appeared, for all his\ncircumspection, to have so completely carried the war into the enemy's\ncamp, so completely to have adopted their own methods, that his fellows\nscarcely felt the need to protect him as yesterday.\n\nAs he emerged, he scanned that hostile file, whose air and garments\nmarked them so clearly for what they were. He paused, seeking the man\nhe expected, the man he was most anxious to oblige. But M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr was absent from those eager ranks. This seemed to him odd. La\nTour d'Azyr was Chabrillane's cousin and closest friend. Surely he\nshould have been among the first to-day. The fact was that La Tour\nd'Azyr was too deeply overcome by amazement and grief at the utterly\nunexpected event. Also his vindictiveness was held curiously in leash.\nPerhaps he, too, remembered the part played by Chabrillane in the affair\nat Gavrillac, and saw in this obscure Andre-Louis Moreau, who had\nso persistently persecuted him ever since, an ordained avenger. The\nrepugnance he felt to come to the point, with him, particularly after\nthis culminating provocation, was puzzling even to himself. But it\nexisted, and it curbed him now.\n\nTo Andre-Louis, since La Tour was not one of that waiting pack, it\nmattered little on that Tuesday morning who should be the next. The\nnext, as it happened, was the young Vicomte de La Motte-Royau, one of\nthe deadliest blades in the group.\n\nOn the Wednesday morning, coming again an hour or so late to the\nAssembly, Andre-Louis announced--in much the same terms as he had\nannounced the death of Chabrillane--that M. de La Motte-Royau would\nprobably not disturb the harmony of the Assembly for some weeks to come,\nassuming that he were so fortunate as to recover ultimately from the\neffects of an unpleasant accident with which he had quite unexpectedly\nhad the misfortune to meet that morning.\n\nOn Thursday he made an identical announcement with regard to the Vidame\nde Blavon. On Friday he told them that he had been delayed by M. de\nTroiscantins, and then turning to the members of the Cote Droit, and\nlengthening his face to a sympathetic gravity:\n\n\"I am glad to inform you, messieurs, that M. des Troiscantins is in the\nhands of a very competent surgeon who hopes with care to restore him to\nyour councils in a few weeks' time.\"\n\nIt was paralyzing, fantastic, unreal; and friend and foe in that\nassembly sat alike stupefied under those bland daily announcements. Four\nof the most redoubtable spadassinicides put away for a time, one of\nthem dead--and all this performed with such an air of indifference and\nannounced in such casual terms by a wretched little provincial lawyer!\n\nHe began to assume in their eyes a romantic aspect. Even that group of\nphilosophers of the Cote Gauche, who refused to worship any force\nbut the force of reason, began to look upon him with a respect and\nconsideration which no oratorical triumphs could ever have procured him.\n\nAnd from the Assembly the fame of him oozed out gradually over Paris.\nDesmoulins wrote a panegyric upon him in his paper \"Les Revolutions,\"\nwherein he dubbed him the \"Paladin of the Third Estate,\" a name\nthat caught the fancy of the people, and clung to him for some time.\nDisdainfully was he mentioned in the \"Actes des Apotres,\" the mocking\norgan of the Privileged party, so light-heartedly and provocatively\nedited by a group of gentlemen afflicted by a singular mental myopy.\n\nThe Friday of that very busy week in the life of this young man who even\nthereafter is to persist in reminding us that he is not in any sense a\nman of action, found the vestibule of the Manege empty of swordsmen\nwhen he made his leisurely and expectant egress between Le Chapelier and\nKersain.\n\nSo surprised was he that he checked in his stride.\n\n\"Have they had enough?\" he wondered, addressing the question to Le\nChapelier.\n\n\"They have had enough of you, I should think,\" was the answer. \"They\nwill prefer to turn their attention to some one less able to take care\nof himself.\"\n\nNow this was disappointing. Andre-Louis had lent himself to this\nbusiness with a very definite object in view. The slaying of Chabrillane\nhad, as far as it went, been satisfactory. He had regarded that as a\nsort of acceptable hors d'oeuvre. But the three who had followed were\nno affair of his at all. He had met them with a certain amount of\nrepugnance, and dealt with each as lightly as consideration of his own\nsafety permitted. Was the baiting of him now to cease whilst the man\nat whom he aimed had not presented himself? In that case it would be\nnecessary to force the pace!\n\nOut there under the awning a group of gentlemen stood in earnest talk.\nScanning the group in a rapid glance, Andre-Louis perceived M. de La\nTour d'Azyr amongst them. He tightened his lips. He must afford no\nprovocation. It must be for them to fasten their quarrels upon him.\nAlready the \"Actes des Apotres\" that morning had torn the mask from\nhis face, and proclaimed him the fencing-master of the Rue du Hasard,\nsuccessor to Bertrand des Amis. Hazardous as it had been hitherto for a\nman of his condition to engage in single combat it was rendered doubly\nso by this exposure, offered to the public as an aristocratic apologia.\n\nStill, matters could not be left where they were, or he should have had\nall his pains for nothing. Carefully looking away from that group of\ngentlemen, he raised his voice so that his words must carry to their\nears.\n\n\"It begins to look as if my fears of having to spend the remainder of my\ndays in the Bois were idle.\"\n\nOut of the corner of his eye he caught the stir his words created in\nthat group. Its members had turned to look at him; but for the moment\nthat was all. A little more was necessary. Pacing slowly along between\nhis friends he resumed:\n\n\"But is it not remarkable that the assassin of Lagron should make\nno move against Lagron's successor? Or perhaps it is not remarkable.\nPerhaps there are good reasons. Perhaps the gentleman is prudent.\"\n\nHe had passed the group by now, and he left that last sentence of his to\ntrail behind him, and after it sent laughter, insolent and provoking.\n\nHe had not long to wait. Came a quick step behind him, and a hand\nfalling upon his shoulder, spun him violently round. He was brought face\nto face with M. de La Tour d'Azyr, whose handsome countenance was calm\nand composed, but whose eyes reflected something of the sudden blaze of\npassion stirring in him. Behind him several members of the group\nwere approaching more slowly. The others--like Andre-Louis' two\ncompanions--remained at gaze.\n\n\"You spoke of me, I think,\" said the Marquis quietly.\n\n\"I spoke of an assassin--yes. But to these my friends.\" Andre-Louis'\nmanner was no less quiet, indeed the quieter of the two, for he was the\nmore experienced actor.\n\n\"You spoke loudly enough to be overheard,\" said the Marquis, answering\nthe insinuation that he had been eavesdropping.\n\n\"Those who wish to overhear frequently contrive to do so.\"\n\n\"I perceive that it is your aim to be offensive.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you are mistaken, M. le Marquis. I have no wish to be\noffensive. But I resent having hands violently laid upon me, especially\nwhen they are hands that I cannot consider clean, In the circumstances I\ncan hardly be expected to be polite.\"\n\nThe elder man's eyelids flickered. Almost he caught himself admiring\nAndre-Louis' bearing. Rather, he feared that his own must suffer by\ncomparison. Because of this, he enraged altogether, and lost control of\nhimself.\n\n\"You spoke of me as the assassin of Lagron. I do not affect to\nmisunderstand you. You expounded your views to me once before, and I\nremember.\"\n\n\"But what flattery, monsieur!\"\n\n\"You called me an assassin then, because I used my skill to dispose of a\nturbulent hot-head who made the world unsafe for me. But how much better\nare you, M. the fencing-master, when you oppose yourself to men whose\nskill is as naturally inferior to your own!\"\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr's friends looked grave, perturbed. It was really\nincredible to find this great gentleman so far forgetting himself as to\ndescend to argument with a canaille of a lawyer-swordsman. And what was\nworse, it was an argument in which he was being made ridiculous.\n\n\"I oppose myself to them!\" said Andre-Louis on a tone of amused protest.\n\"Ah, pardon, M. le Marquis; it is they who chose to oppose themselves\nto me--and so stupidly. They push me, they slap my face, they tread on my\ntoes, they call me by unpleasant names. What if I am a fencing-master?\nMust I on that account submit to every manner of ill-treatment from\nyour bad-mannered friends? Perhaps had they found out sooner that I am a\nfencing-master their manners would have been better. But to blame me for\nthat! What injustice!\"\n\n\"Comedian!\" the Marquis contemptuously apostrophized him. \"Does it alter\nthe case? Are these men who have opposed you men who live by the sword\nlike yourself?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, M. le Marquis, I have found them men who died by the\nsword with astonishing ease. I cannot suppose that you desire to add\nyourself to their number.\"\n\n\"And why, if you please?\" La Tour d'Azyr's face had flamed scarlet\nbefore that sneer.\n\n\"Oh,\" Andre-Louis raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips, a man\nconsidering. He delivered himself slowly. \"Because, monsieur, you prefer\nthe easy victim--the Lagrons and Vilmorins of this world, mere sheep for\nyour butchering. That is why.\"\n\nAnd then the Marquis struck him.\n\nAndre-Louis stepped back. His eyes gleamed a moment; the next they were\nsmiling up into the face of his tall enemy.\n\n\"No better than the others, after all! Well, well! Remark, I beg you,\nhow history repeats itself--with certain differences. Because poor\nVilmorin could not bear a vile lie with which you goaded him, he struck\nyou. Because you cannot bear an equally vile truth which I have uttered,\nyou strike me. But always is the vileness yours. And now as then for the\nstriker there is...\" He broke off. \"But why name it? You will remember\nwhat there is. Yourself you wrote it that day with the point of your\ntoo-ready sword. But there. I will meet you if you desire it, monsieur.\"\n\n\"What else do you suppose that I desire? To talk?\"\n\nAndre-Louis turned to his friends and sighed. \"So that I am to go\nanother jaunt to the Bois. Isaac, perhaps you will kindly have a word\nwith one of these friends of M. le Marquis', and arrange for nine\no'clock to-morrow, as usual.\"\n\n\"Not to-morrow,\" said the Marquis shortly to Le Chapeher. \"I have an\nengagement in the country, which I cannot postpone.\"\n\nLe Chapelier looked at Andre-Louis.\n\n\"Then for M. le Marquis' convenience, we will say Sunday at the same\nhour.\"\n\n\"I do not fight on Sunday. I am not a pagan to break the holy day.\"\n\n\"But surely the good God would not have the presumption to damn a\ngentleman of M. le Marquis' quality on that account? Ah, well, Isaac,\nplease arrange for Monday, if it is not a feast-day or monsieur has not\nsome other pressing engagement. I leave it in your hands.\"\n\nHe bowed with the air of a man wearied by these details, and threading\nhis arm through Kersain's withdrew.\n\n\"Ah, Dieu de Dieu! But what a trick of it you have,\" said the Breton\ndeputy, entirely unsophisticated in these matters.\n\n\"To be sure I have. I have taken lessons at their hands.\" He laughed. He\nwas in excellent good-humour. And Kersain was enrolled in the ranks of\nthose who accounted Andre-Louis a man without heart or conscience.\n\nBut in his \"Confessions\" he tells us--and this is one of the glimpses\nthat reveal the true man under all that make-believe--that on that night\nhe went down on his knees to commune with his dead friend Philippe, and\nto call his spirit to witness that he was about to take the last step\nin the fulfilment of the oath sworn upon his body at Gavrillac two years\nago.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. TORN PRIDE\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr's engagement in the country on that Sunday was with\nM. de Kercadiou. To fulfil it he drove out early in the day to Meudon,\ntaking with him in his pocket a copy of the last issue of \"Les Actes des\nApotres,\" a journal whose merry sallies at the expense of the innovators\ngreatly diverted the Seigneur de Gavrillac. The venomous scorn it\npoured upon those worthless rapscallions afforded him a certain solatium\nagainst the discomforts of expatriation by which he was afflicted as a\nresult of their detestable energies.\n\nTwice in the last month, had M. de La Tour d'Azyr gone to visit the Lord\nof Gavrillac at Meudon, and the sight of Aline, so sweet and fresh,\nso bright and of so lively a mind, had caused those embers smouldering\nunder the ashes of the past, embers which until now he had believed\nutterly extinct, to kindle into flame once more. He desired her as we\ndesire Heaven. I believe that it was the purest passion of his life;\nthat had it come to him earlier he might have been a vastly different\nman. The cruelest wound that in all his selfish life he had taken was\nwhen she sent him word, quite definitely after the affair at the Feydau,\nthat she could not again in any circumstances receive him. At one\nblow--through that disgraceful riot--he had been robbed of a mistress he\nprized and of a wife who had become a necessity to the very soul of him.\nThe sordid love of La Binet might have consoled him for the compulsory\nrenunciation of his exalted love of Aline, just as to his exalted love\nof Aline he had been ready to sacrifice his attachment to La Binet. But\nthat ill-timed riot had robbed him at once of both. Faithful to his word\nto Sautron he had definitely broken with La Binet, only to find that\nAline had definitely broken with him. And by the time that he had\nsufficiently recovered from his grief to think again of La Binet, the\ncomedienne had vanished beyond discovery.\n\nFor all this he blamed, and most bitterly blamed, Andre-Louis. That\nlow-born provincial lout pursued him like a Nemesis, was become indeed\nthe evil genius of his life. That was it--the evil genius of his life!\nAnd it was odds that on Monday... He did not like to think of Monday.\nHe was not particularly afraid of death. He was as brave as his kind in\nthat respect, too brave in the ordinary way, and too confident of his\nskill, to have considered even remotely such a possibility as that\nof dying in a duel. It was only that it would seem like a proper\nconsummation of all the evil that he had suffered directly or indirectly\nthrough this Andre-Louis Moreau that he should perish ignobly by his\nhand. Almost he could hear that insolent, pleasant voice making the\nflippant announcement to the Assembly on Monday morning.\n\nHe shook off the mood, angry with himself for entertaining it. It was\nmaudlin. After all Chabrillane and La Motte-Royau were quite exceptional\nswordsmen, but neither of them really approached his own formidable\ncalibre. Reaction began to flow, as he drove out through country\nlanes flooded with pleasant September sunshine. His spirits rose. A\npremonition of victory stirred within him. Far from fearing Monday's\nmeeting, as he had so unreasonably been doing, he began to look forward\nto it. It should afford him the means of setting a definite term to\nthis persecution of which he had been the victim. He would crush\nthis insolent and persistent flea that had been stinging him at every\nopportunity. Borne upward on that wave of optimism, he took presently a\nmore hopeful view of his case with Aline.\n\nAt their first meeting a month ago he had used the utmost frankness with\nher. He had told her the whole truth of his motives in going that night\nto the Feydau; he had made her realize that she had acted unjustly\ntowards him. True he had gone no farther.\n\nBut that was very far to have gone as a beginning. And in their\nlast meeting, now a fortnight old, she had received him with frank\nfriendliness. True, she had been a little aloof. But that was to be\nexpected until he quite explicitly avowed that he had revived the hope\nof winning her. He had been a fool not to have returned before to-day.\n\nThus in that mood of new-born confidence--a confidence risen from the\nvery ashes of despondency--came he on that Sunday morning to Meudon. He\nwas gay and jovial with M. de Kercadiou what time he waited in the salon\nfor mademoiselle to show herself. He pronounced with confidence on\nthe country's future. There were signs already--he wore the rosiest\nspectacles that morning--of a change of opinion, of a more moderate note.\nThe Nation began to perceive whither this lawyer rabble was leading it.\nHe pulled out \"The Acts of the Apostles\" and read a stinging paragraph.\nThen, when mademoiselle at last made her appearance, he resigned the\njournal into the hands of M. de Kercadiou.\n\nM. de Kercadiou, with his niece's future to consider, went to read the\npaper in the garden, taking up there a position whence he could keep the\ncouple within sight--as his obligations seemed to demand of him--whilst\nbeing discreetly out of earshot.\n\nThe Marquis made the most of an opportunity that might be brief. He\nquite frankly declared himself, and begged, implored to be taken back\ninto Aline's good graces, to be admitted at least to the hope that one\nday before very long she would bring herself to consider him in a nearer\nrelationship.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he told her, his voice vibrating with a feeling that\nadmitted of no doubt, \"you cannot lack conviction of my utter sincerity.\nThe very constancy of my devotion should afford you this. It is just\nthat I should have been banished from you, since I showed myself so\nutterly unworthy of the great honour to which I aspired. But this\nbanishment has nowise diminished my devotion. If you could conceive what\nI have suffered, you would agree that I have fully expiated my abject\nfault.\"\n\nShe looked at him with a curious, gentle wistfulness on her lovely face.\n\n\"Monsieur, it is not you whom I doubt. It is myself.\"\n\n\"You mean your feelings towards me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But that I can understand. After what has happened...\"\n\n\"It was always so, monsieur,\" she interrupted quietly. \"You speak of me\nas if lost to you by your own action. That is to say too much. Let me be\nfrank with you. Monsieur, I was never yours to lose. I am conscious of\nthe honour that you do me. I esteem you very deeply...\"\n\n\"But, then,\" he cried, on a high note of confidence, \"from such a\nbeginning...\"\n\n\"Who shall assure me that it is a beginning? May it not be the whole?\nHad I held you in affection, monsieur, I should have sent for you\nafter the affair of which you have spoken. I should at least not have\ncondemned you without hearing your explanation. As it was...\" She\nshrugged, smiling gently, sadly. \"You see...\"\n\nBut his optimism far from being crushed was stimulated. \"But it is to\ngive me hope, mademoiselle. If already I possess so much, I may look\nwith confidence to win more. I shall prove myself worthy. I swear to\ndo that. Who that is permitted the privilege of being near you could do\nother than seek to render himself worthy?\"\n\nAnd then before she could add a word, M. de Kercadiou came blustering\nthrough the window, his spectacles on his forehead, his face inflamed,\nwaving in his hand \"The Acts of the Apostles,\" and apparently reduced to\nspeechlessness.\n\nHad the Marquis expressed himself aloud he would have been profane. As\nit was he bit his lip in vexation at this most inopportune interruption.\n\nAline sprang up, alarmed by her uncle's agitation.\n\n\"What has happened?\"\n\n\"Happened?\" He found speech at last. \"The scoundrel! The faithless dog!\nI consented to overlook the past on the clear condition that he should\navoid revolutionary politics in future. That condition he accepted, and\nnow\"--he smacked the news-sheet furiously--\"he has played me false again.\nNot only has he gone into politics, once more, but he is actually\na member of the Assembly, and what is worse he has been using\nhis assassin's skill as a fencing-master, turning himself into a\nbully-swordsman. My God! Is there any law at all left in France?\"\n\nOne doubt M. de La Tour d'Azyr had entertained, though only faintly, to\nmar the perfect serenity of his growing optimism. That doubt concerned\nthis man Moreau and his relations with M. de Kercadiou. He knew what\nonce they had been, and how changed they subsequently were by the\ningratitude of Moreau's own behavior in turning against the class\nto which his benefactor belonged. What he did not know was that a\nreconciliation had been effected. For in the past month--ever since\ncircumstances had driven Andre-Louis to depart from his undertaking\nto steer clear of politics--the young man had not ventured to approach\nMeudon, and as it happened his name had not been mentioned in La Tour\nd'Azyr's hearing on the occasion of either of his own previous visits.\nHe learnt of that reconciliation now; but he learnt at the same time\nthat the breach was now renewed, and rendered wider and more impassable\nthan ever. Therefore he did not hesitate to avow his own position.\n\n\"There is a law,\" he answered. \"The law that this rash young man himself\nevokes. The law of the sword.\" He spoke very gravely, almost sadly.\nFor he realized that after all the ground was tender. \"You are not to\nsuppose that he is to continue indefinitely his career of evil and\nof murder. Sooner or later he will meet a sword that will avenge the\nothers. You have observed that my cousin Chabrillane is among the number\nof this assassin's victims; that he was killed on Tuesday last.\"\n\n\"If I have not expressed my condolence, Azyr, it is because my\nindignation stifles at the moment every other feeling. The scoundrel!\nYou say that sooner or later he will meet a sword that will avenge the\nothers. I pray that it may be soon.\"\n\nThe Marquis answered him quietly, without anything but sorrow in his\nvoice. \"I think your prayer is likely to be heard. This wretched young\nman has an engagement for to-morrow, when his account may be definitely\nsettled.\"\n\nHe spoke with such calm conviction that his words had all the sound of\na sentence of death. They suddenly stemmed the flow of M. de Kercadiou's\nanger. The colour receded from his inflamed face; dread looked out of\nhis pale eyes, to inform M. de La Tour d'Azyr, more clearly than any\nwords, that M. de Kercadiou's hot speech had been the expression of\nunreflecting anger, that his prayer that retribution might soon overtake\nhis godson had been unconsciously insincere. Confronted now by the fact\nthat this retribution was about to be visited upon that scoundrel, the\nfundamental gentleness and kindliness of his nature asserted itself; his\nanger was suddenly whelmed in apprehension; his affection for the lad\nbeat up to the surface, making Andre-Louis' sin, however hideous, a\nthing of no account by comparison with the threatened punishment.\n\nM. de Kercadiou moistened his lips.\n\n\"With whom is this engagement?\" he asked in a voice that by an effort he\ncontrived to render steady.\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr bowed his handsome head, his eyes upon the gleaming\nparquetry of the floor. \"With myself,\" he answered quietly, conscious\nalready with a tightening of the heart that his answer must sow dismay.\nHe caught the sound of a faint outcry from Aline; he saw the sudden\nrecoil of M. de Kercadiou. And then he plunged headlong into the\nexplanation that he deemed necessary.\n\n\"In view of his relations with you, M. de Kercadiou, and because of my\ndeep regard for you, I did my best to avoid this, even though as you\nwill understand the death of my dear friend and cousin Chabrillane\nseemed to summon me to action, even though I knew that my circumspection\nwas becoming matter for criticism among my friends. But yesterday this\nunbridled young man made further restraint impossible to me. He provoked\nme deliberately and publicly. He put upon me the very grossest affront,\nand... to-morrow morning in the Bois... we meet.\"\n\nHe faltered a little at the end, fully conscious of the hostile\natmosphere in which he suddenly found himself. Hostility from M. de\nKercadiou, the latter's earlier change of manner had already led him\nto expect; the hostility of mademoiselle came more in the nature of a\nsurprise.\n\nHe began to understand what difficulties the course to which he was\ncommitted must raise up for him. A fresh obstacle was to be flung across\nthe path which he had just cleared, as he imagined. Yet his pride and\nhis sense of the justice due to be done admitted of no weakening.\n\nIn bitterness he realized now, as he looked from uncle to niece--his\nglance, usually so direct and bold, now oddly furtive--that though\nto-morrow he might kill Andre-Louis, yet even by his death Andre-Louis\nwould take vengeance upon him. He had exaggerated nothing in reaching\nthe conclusion that this Andre-Louis Moreau was the evil genius of his\nlife. He saw now that do what he would, kill him even though he\nmight, he could never conquer him. The last word would always be with\nAndre-Louis Moreau. In bitterness, in rage, and in humiliation--a thing\nalmost unknown to him--did he realize it, and the realization steeled his\npurpose for all that he perceived its futility.\n\nOutwardly he showed himself calm and self-contained, properly suggesting\na man regretfully accepting the inevitable. It would have been as\nimpossible to find fault with his bearing as to attempt to turn him from\nthe matter to which he was committed. And so M. de Kercadiou perceived.\n\n\"My God!\" was all that he said, scarcely above his breath, yet almost in\na groan.\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr did, as always, the thing that sensibility demanded\nof him. He took his leave. He understood that to linger where his\nnews had produced such an effect would be impossible, indecent. So he\ndeparted, in a bitterness comparable only with his erstwhile optimism,\nthe sweet fruit of hope turned to a thing of gall even as it touched\nhis lips. Oh, yes; the last word, indeed, was with Andre-Louis\nMoreau--always!\n\nUncle and niece looked at each other as he passed out, and there was\nhorror in the eyes of both. Aline's pallor was deathly almost, and\nstanding there now she wrung her hands as if in pain.\n\n\"Why did you not ask him--beg him...\" She broke off.\n\n\"To what end? He was in the right, and... and there are things one\ncannot ask; things it would be a useless humiliation to ask.\" He sat\ndown, groaning. \"Oh, the poor boy--the poor, misguided boy.\"\n\nIn the mind of neither, you see, was there any doubt of what must be the\nissue. The calm confidence in which La Tour d'Azyr had spoken compelled\nitself to be shared. He was no vainglorious boaster, and they knew of\nwhat a force as a swordsman he was generally accounted.\n\n\"What does humiliation matter? A life is at issue--Andre's life.\"\n\n\"I know. My God, don't I know? And I would humiliate myself if by\nhumiliating myself I could hope to prevail. But Azyr is a hard,\nrelentless man, and...\"\n\nAbruptly she left him.\n\nShe overtook the Marquis as he was in the act of stepping his carriage.\nHe turned as she called, and bowed.\n\n\"Mademoiselle?\"\n\nAt once he guessed her errand, tasted in anticipation the unparalleled\nbitterness of being compelled to refuse her. Yet at her invitation he\nstepped back into the cool of the hall.\n\nIn the middle of the floor of chequered marbles, black and white, stood\na carved table of black oak. By this he halted, leaning lightly against\nit whilst she sat enthroned in the great crimson chair beside it.\n\n\"Monsieur, I cannot allow you so to depart,\" she said. \"You cannot\nrealize, monsieur, what a blow would be dealt my uncle if... if evil,\nirrevocable evil were to overtake his godson to-morrow. The expressions\nthat he used at first...\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, I perceived their true value. Spare yourself. Believe me\nI am profoundly desolated by circumstances which I had not expected to\nfind. You must believe me when I say that. It is all that I can say.\"\n\n\"Must it really be all? Andre is very dear to his godfather.\"\n\nThe pleading tone cut him like a knife; and then suddenly it aroused\nanother emotion--an emotion which he realized to be utterly unworthy,\nan emotion which, in his overwhelming pride of race, seemed almost\nsullying, yet not to be repressed. He hesitated to give it utterance;\nhesitated even remotely to suggest so horrible a thing as that in a man\nof such lowly origin he might conceivably discover a rival. Yet that\nsudden pang of jealousy was stronger than his monstrous pride.\n\n\"And to you, mademoiselle? What is this Andre-Louis Moreau to you? You\nwill pardon the question. But I desire clearly to understand.\"\n\nWatching her he beheld the scarlet stain that overspread her face.\nHe read in it at first confusion, until the gleam of her blue eyes\nannounced its source to lie in anger. That comforted him; since he had\naffronted her, he was reassured. It did not occur to him that the anger\nmight have another source.\n\n\"Andre and I have been playmates from infancy. He is very dear to me,\ntoo; almost I regard him as a brother. Were I in need of help, and were\nmy uncle not available, Andre would be the first man to whom I should\nturn. Are you sufficiently answered, monsieur? Or is there more of me\nyou would desire revealed?\"\n\nHe bit his lip. He was unnerved, he thought, this morning; otherwise the\nsilly suspicion with which he had offended could never have occurred to\nhim.\n\nHe bowed very low. \"Mademoiselle, forgive that I should have troubled\nyou with such a question. You have answered more fully than I could have\nhoped or wished.\"\n\nHe said no more than that. He waited for her to resume. At a loss, she\nsat in silence awhile, a pucker on her white brow, her fingers nervously\ndrumming on the table. At last she flung herself headlong against the\nimpassive, polished front that he presented.\n\n\"I have come, monsieur, to beg you to put off this meeting.\"\n\nShe saw the faint raising of his dark eyebrows, the faintly regretful\nsmile that scarcely did more than tinge his fine lips, and she hurried\non. \"What honour can await you in such an engagement, monsieur?\"\n\nIt was a shrewd thrust at the pride of race that she accounted his\nparamount sentiment, that had as often lured him into error as it had\nurged him into good.\n\n\"I do not seek honour in it, mademoiselle, but--I must say it--justice.\nThe engagement, as I have explained, is not of my seeking. It has been\nthrust upon me, and in honour I cannot draw back.\"\n\n\"Why, what dishonour would there be in sparing him? Surely, monsieur,\nnone would call your courage in question? None could misapprehend your\nmotives.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, mademoiselle. My motives would most certainly be\nmisapprehended. You forget that this young man has acquired in the past\nweek a certain reputation that might well make a man hesitate to meet\nhim.\"\n\nShe brushed that aside almost contemptuously, conceiving it the merest\nquibble.\n\n\"Some men, yes. But not you, M. le Marquis.\"\n\nHer confidence in him on every count was most sweetly flattering. But\nthere was a bitterness behind the sweet.\n\n\"Even I, mademoiselle, let me assure you. And there is more than that.\nThis quarrel which M. Moreau has forced upon me is no new thing. It is\nmerely the culmination of a long-drawn persecution...\"\n\n\"Which you invited,\" she cut in. \"Be just, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I hope that it is not in my nature to be otherwise, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Consider, then, that you killed his friend.\"\n\n\"I find in that nothing with which to reproach myself. My justification\nlay in the circumstances--the subsequent events in this distracted\ncountry surely confirm it.\"\n\n\"And...\" She faltered a little, and looked away from him for the first\ntime. \"And that you... that you... And what of Mademoiselle Binet, whom\nhe was to have married?\"\n\nHe stared at her for a moment in sheer surprise. \"Was to have married?\"\nhe repeated incredulously, dismayed almost.\n\n\"You did not know that?\"\n\n\"But how do you?\"\n\n\"Did I not tell you that we are as brother and sister almost? I have his\nconfidence. He told me, before... before you made it impossible.\"\n\nHe looked away, chin in hand, his glance thoughtful, disturbed, almost\nwistful.\n\n\"There is,\" he said slowly, musingly, \"a singular fatality at work\nbetween that man and me, bringing us ever each by turns athwart the\nother's path...\"\n\nHe sighed; then swung to face her again, speaking more briskly:\n\"Mademoiselle, until this moment I had no knowledge--no suspicion of\nthis thing. But...\" He broke off, considered, and then shrugged. \"If\nI wronged him, I did so unconsciously. It would be unjust to blame me,\nsurely. In all our actions it must be the intention alone that counts.\"\n\n\"But does it make no difference?\"\n\n\"None that I can discern, mademoiselle. It gives me no justification\nto withdraw from that to which I am irrevocably committed. No\njustification, indeed, could ever be greater than my concern for the\npain it must occasion my good friend, your uncle, and perhaps yourself,\nmademoiselle.\"\n\nShe rose suddenly, squarely confronting him, desperate now, driven to\nplay the only card upon which she thought she might count.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" she said, \"you did me the honour to-day to speak in certain\nterms; to... to allude to certain hopes with which you honour me.\"\n\nHe looked at her almost in fear. In silence, not daring to speak, he\nwaited for her to continue.\n\n\"I... I... Will you please to understand, monsieur, that if you persist\nin this matter, if... unless you can break this engagement of yours\nto-morrow morning in the Bois, you are not to presume to mention this\nsubject to me again, or, indeed, ever again to approach me.\"\n\nTo put the matter in this negative way was as far as she could possibly\ngo. It was for him to make the positive proposal to which she had thus\nthrown wide the door.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, you cannot mean...\"\n\n\"I do, monsieur... irrevocably, please to understand.\" He looked at her\nwith eyes of misery, his handsome, manly face as pale as she had ever\nseen it. The hand he had been holding out in protest began to shake. He\nlowered it to his side again, lest she should perceive its tremor.\nThus a brief second, while the battle was fought within him, the bitter\nengagement between his desires and what he conceived to be the demands\nof his honour, never perceiving how far his honour was buttressed by\nimplacable vindictiveness. Retreat, he conceived, was impossible without\nshame; and shame was to him an agony unthinkable. She asked too much.\nShe could not understand what she was asking, else she would never be\nso unreasonable, so unjust. But also he saw that it would be futile to\nattempt to make her understand.\n\nIt was the end. Though he kill Andre-Louis Moreau in the morning as he\nfiercely hoped he would, yet the victory even in death must lie with\nAndre-Louis Moreau.\n\nHe bowed profoundly, grave and sorrowful of face as he was grave and\nsorrowful of heart.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, my homage,\" he murmured, and turned to go.\n\n\"But you have not answered me!\" she called after him in terror.\n\nHe checked on the threshold, and turned; and there from the cool\ngloom of the hall she saw him a black, graceful silhouette against the\nbrilliant sunshine beyond--a memory of him that was to cling as something\nsinister and menacing in the dread hours that were to follow.\n\n\"What would you, mademoiselle? I but spared myself and you the pain of a\nrefusal.\"\n\nHe was gone leaving her crushed and raging. She sank down again into the\ngreat red chair, and sat there crumpled, her elbows on the table, her\nface in her hands--a face that was on fire with shame and passion. She\nhad offered herself, and she had been refused! The inconceivable had\nbefallen her. The humiliation of it seemed to her something that could\nnever be effaced.\n\nStartled, appalled, she stepped back, her hand pressed to her tortured\nbreast.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE RETURNING CARRIAGE\n\nM. de Kercadiou wrote a letter.\n\n\"Godson,\" he began, without any softening adjective, \"I have learnt\nwith pain and indignation that you have dishonoured yourself again by\nbreaking the pledge you gave me to abstain from politics. With still\ngreater pain and indignation do I learn that your name has become in a\nfew short days a byword, that you have discarded the weapon of false,\ninsidious arguments against my class--the class to which you owe\neverything--for the sword of the assassin. It has come to my knowledge\nthat you have an assignation to-morrow with my good friend M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr. A gentleman of his station is under certain obligations imposed\nupon him by his birth, which do not permit him to draw back from an\nengagement. But you labour under no such disadvantages. For a man of\nyour class to refuse an engagement of honour, or to neglect it when\nmade, entails no sacrifice. Your peers will probably be of the opinion\nthat you display a commendable prudence. Therefore I beg you, indeed,\ndid I think that I still exercise over you any such authority as the\nfavours you have received from me should entitle me to exercise, I would\ncommand you, to allow this matter to go no farther, and to refrain from\nrendering yourself to your assignation to-morrow morning. Having no such\nauthority, as your past conduct now makes clear, having no reason to\nhope that a proper sentiment of gratitude to me will induce to give heed\nto this my most earnest request, I am compelled to add that should you\nsurvive to-morrow's encounter, I can in no circumstances ever again\npermit myself to be conscious of your existence. If any spark survives\nof the affection that once you expressed for me, or if you set any value\nupon the affection, which, in spite of all that you have done to forfeit\nit, is the chief prompter of this letter, you will not refuse to do as I\nam asking.\"\n\nIt was not a tactful letter. M. de Kercadiou was not a tactful man. Read\nit as he would, Andre-Louis--when it was delivered to him on that Sunday\nafternoon by the groom dispatched with it into Paris--could read into it\nonly concern for M. La Tour d'Azyr, M. de Kercadiou's good friend, as he\ncalled him, and prospective nephew-in-law.\n\nHe kept the groom waiting a full hour while composing his answer.\nBrief though it was, it cost him very considerable effort and several\nunsuccessful attempts. In the end this is what he wrote:\n\nMonsieur my godfather--You make refusal singularly hard for me when you\nappeal to me upon the ground of affection. It is a thing of which all my\nlife I shall hail the opportunity to give you proofs, and I am therefore\ndesolated beyond anything I could hope to express that I cannot give you\nthe proof you ask to-day. There is too much between M. de La Tour d'Azyr\nand me. Also you do me and my class--whatever it may be--less than justice\nwhen you say that obligations of honour are not binding upon us. So\nbinding do I count them, that, if I would, I could not now draw back.\n\nIf hereafter you should persist in the harsh intention you express, I\nmust suffer it. That I shall suffer be assured.\n\nYour affectionate and grateful godson\n\nAndre-Louis\n\nHe dispatched that letter by M. de Kercadiou's groom, and conceived this\nto be the end of the matter. It cut him keenly; but he bore the wound\nwith that outward stoicism he affected.\n\nNext morning, at a quarter past eight, as with Le Chapelier--who had come\nto break his fast with him--he was rising from table to set out for\nthe Bois, his housekeeper startled him by announcing Mademoiselle de\nKercadiou.\n\nHe looked at his watch. Although his cabriolet was already at the door,\nhe had a few minutes to spare. He excused himself from Le Chapelier, and\nwent briskly out to the anteroom.\n\nShe advanced to meet him, her manner eager, almost feverish.\n\n\"I will not affect ignorance of why you have come,\" he said quickly, to\nmake short work. \"But time presses, and I warn you that only the most\nsolid of reasons can be worth stating.\"\n\nIt surprised her. It amounted to a rebuff at the very outset, before she\nhad uttered a word; and that was the last thing she had expected from\nAndre-Louis. Moreover, there was about him an air of aloofness that was\nunusual where she was concerned, and his voice had been singularly cold\nand formal.\n\nIt wounded her. She was not to guess the conclusion to which he had\nleapt. He made with regard to her--as was but natural, after all--the\nsame mistake that he had made with regard to yesterday's letter from his\ngodfather. He conceived that the mainspring of action here was solely\nconcern for M. de La Tour d'Azyr. That it might be concern for himself\nnever entered his mind. So absolute was his own conviction of what must\nbe the inevitable issue of that meeting that he could not conceive of\nany one entertaining a fear on his behalf.\n\nWhat he assumed to be anxiety on the score of the predestined victim\nhad irritated him in M. de Kercadiou; in Aline it filled him with a cold\nanger; he argued from it that she had hardly been frank with him; that\nambition was urging her to consider with favour the suit of M. de La\nTour d'Azyr. And than this there was no spur that could have driven more\nrelentlessly in his purpose, since to save her was in his eyes almost as\nmomentous as to avenge the past.\n\nShe conned him searchingly, and the complete calm of him at such a time\namazed her. She could not repress the mention of it.\n\n\"How calm you are, Andre!\"\n\n\"I am not easily disturbed. It is a vanity of mine.\"\n\n\"But... Oh, Andre, this meeting must not take place!\" She came close\nup to him, to set her hands upon his shoulders, and stood so, her face\nwithin a foot of his own.\n\n\"You know, of course, of some good reason why it should not?\" said he.\n\n\"You may be killed,\" she answered him, and her eyes dilated as she\nspoke.\n\nIt was so far from anything that he had expected that for a moment he\ncould only stare at her. Then he thought he had understood. He laughed\nas he removed her hands from his shoulders, and stepped back. This was a\nshallow device, childish and unworthy in her.\n\n\"Can you really think to prevail by attempting to frighten me?\" he\nasked, and almost sneered.\n\n\"Oh, you are surely mad! M. de La Tour d'Azyr is reputed the most\ndangerous sword in France.\"\n\n\"Have you never noticed that most reputations are undeserved?\nChabrillane was a dangerous swordsman, and Chabrillane is underground.\nLa Motte-Royau was an even more dangerous swordsman, and he is in\na surgeon's hands. So are the other spadassinicides who dreamt of\nskewering a poor sheep of a provincial lawyer. And here to-day comes\nthe chief, the fine flower of these bully-swordsmen. He comes, for\nwages long overdue. Be sure of that. So if you have no other reason to\nurge...\"\n\nIt was the sarcasm of him that mystified her. Could he possibly be\nsincere in his assurance that he must prevail against M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr? To her in her limited knowledge, her mind filled with her\nuncle's contrary conviction, it seemed that Andre-Louis was only acting;\nhe would act a part to the very end.\n\nBe that as it might, she shifted her ground to answer him.\n\n\"You had my uncle's letter?\"\n\n\"And I answered it.\"\n\n\"I know. But what he said, he will fulfil. Do not dream that he will\nrelent if you carry out this horrible purpose.\"\n\n\"Come, now, that is a better reason than the other,\" said he. \"If there\nis a reason in the world that could move me it would be that. But there\nis too much between La Tour d'Azyr and me. There is an oath I swore on\nthe dead hand of Philippe de Vilmorin. I could never have hoped that God\nwould afford me so great an opportunity of keeping it.\"\n\n\"You have not kept it yet,\" she warned him.\n\nHe smiled at her. \"True!\" he said. \"But nine o'clock will soon be here.\nTell me,\" he asked her suddenly, \"why did you not carry this request of\nyours to M. de La Tour d'Azyr?\"\n\n\"I did,\" she answered him, and flushed as she remembered her yesterday's\nrejection. He interpreted the flush quite otherwise.\n\n\"And he?\" he asked.\n\n\"M. de La Tour d'Azyr's obligations...\" she was beginning: then she\nbroke off to answer shortly: \"Oh, he refused.\"\n\n\"So, so. He must, of course, whatever it may have cost him. Yet in his\nplace I should have counted the cost as nothing. But men are different,\nyou see.\" He sighed. \"Also in your place, had that been so, I think I\nshould have left the matter there. But then...\"\n\n\"I don't understand you, Andre.\"\n\n\"I am not so very obscure. Not nearly so obscure as I can be. Turn it\nover in your mind. It may help to comfort you presently.\" He consulted\nhis watch again. \"Pray use this house as your own. I must be going.\"\n\nLe Chapelier put his head in at the door.\n\n\"Forgive the intrusion. But we shall be late, Andre, unless you...\"\n\n\"Coming,\" Andre answered him. \"If you will await my return, Aline, you\nwill oblige me deeply. Particularly in view of your uncle's resolve.\"\n\nShe did not answer him. She was numbed. He took her silence for assent,\nand, bowing, left her. Standing there she heard his steps going down the\nstairs together with Le Chapelier's. He was speaking to his friend, and\nhis voice was calm and normal.\n\nOh, he was mad--blinded by self-confidence and vanity. As his carriage\nrattled away, she sat down limply, with a sense of exhaustion and\nnausea. She was sick and faint with horror. Andre-Louis was going to his\ndeath. Conviction of it--an unreasoning conviction, the result, perhaps,\nof all M. de Kercadiou's rantings--entered her soul. Awhile she sat thus,\nparalyzed by hopelessness. Then she sprang up again, wringing her hands.\nShe must do something to avert this horror. But what could she do? To\nfollow him to the Bois and intervene there would be to make a scandal\nfor no purpose. The conventions of conduct were all against her,\noffering a barrier that was not to be overstepped. Was there no one\ncould help her?\n\nStanding there, half-frenzied by her helplessness, she caught again\na sound of vehicles and hooves on the cobbles of the street below.\nA carriage was approaching. It drew up with a clatter before the\nfencing-academy. Could it be Andre-Louis returning? Passionately she\nsnatched at that straw of hope. Knocking, loud and urgent, fell upon the\ndoor. She heard Andre-Louis' housekeeper, her wooden shoes clanking upon\nthe stairs, hurrying down to open.\n\nShe sped to the door of the anteroom, and pulling it wide stood\nbreathlessly to listen. But the voice that floated up to her was not the\nvoice she so desperately hoped to hear. It was a woman's voice asking in\nurgent tones for M. Andre-Louis--a voice at first vaguely familiar, then\nclearly recognized, the voice of Mme. de Plougastel.\n\nExcited, she ran to the head of the narrow staircase in time to hear\nMme. de Plougastel exclaim in agitation:\n\n\"He has gone already! Oh, but how long since? Which way did he take?\"\n\nIt was enough to inform Aline that Mme. de Plougastel's errand must be\nakin to her own. At the moment, in the general distress and confusion\nof her mind, her mental vision focussed entirely on the one vital\npoint, she found in this no matter for astonishment. The singular regard\nconceived by Mme. de Plougastel for Andre-Louis seemed to her then a\nsufficient explanation.\n\nWithout pausing to consider, she ran down that steep staircase, calling:\n\n\"Madame! Madame!\"\n\nThe portly, comely housekeeper drew aside, and the two ladies faced each\nother on that threshold. Mme. de Plougastel looked white and haggard, a\nnameless dread staring from her eyes.\n\n\"Aline! You here!\" she exclaimed. And then in the urgency sweeping aside\nall minor considerations, \"Were you also too late?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, madame. I saw him. I implored him. But he would not listen.\"\n\n\"Oh, this is horrible!\" Mme. de Plougastel shuddered as she spoke. \"I\nheard of it only half an hour ago, and I came at once, to prevent it at\nall costs.\"\n\nThe two women looked blankly, despairingly, at each other. In the\nsunshine-flooded street one or two shabby idlers were pausing to eye\nthe handsome equipage with its magnificent bay horses, and the two great\nladies on the doorstep of the fencing-academy. From across the way came\nthe raucous voice of an itinerant bellows-mender raised in the cry of\nhis trade:\n\n\"A raccommoder les vieux soufflets!\"\n\nMadame swung to the housekeeper.\n\n\"How long is it since monsieur left?\"\n\n\"Ten minutes, maybe; hardly more.\" Conceiving these great ladies to\nbe friends of her invincible master's latest victim, the good woman\npreserved a decently stolid exterior.\n\nMadame wrung her hands. \"Ten minutes! Oh!\" It was almost a moan. \"Which\nway did he go?\"\n\n\"The assignation is for nine o'clock in the Bois de Boulogne,\" Aline\ninformed her. \"Could we follow? Could we prevail if we did?\"\n\n\"Ah, my God! The question is should we come in time? At nine o'clock!\nAnd it wants but little more than a quarter of an hour. Mon Dieu! Mon\nDieu!\" Madame clasped and unclasped her hands in anguish. \"Do you know,\nat least, where in the Bois they are to meet?\"\n\n\"No--only that it is in the Bois.\"\n\n\"In the Bois!\" Madame was flung into a frenzy. \"The Bois is nearly half\nas large as Paris.\" But she swept breathlessly on, \"Come, Aline: get in,\nget in!\"\n\nThen to her coachman. \"To the Bois de Boulogne by way of the Cours la\nReine,\" she commanded, \"as fast as you can drive. There are ten pistoles\nfor you if we are in time. Whip up, man!\"\n\nShe thrust Aline into the carriage, and sprang after her with the\nenergy of a girl. The heavy vehicle--too heavy by far for this race with\ntime--was moving before she had taken her seat. Rocking and lurching\nit went, earning the maledictions of more than one pedestrian whom it\nnarrowly avoided crushing against a wall or trampling underfoot.\n\nMadame sat back with closed eyes and trembling lips. Her face showed\nvery white and drawn. Aline watched her in silence. Almost it seemed to\nher that Mme. de Plougastel was suffering as deeply as herself, enduring\nan anguish of apprehension as great as her own.\n\nLater Aline was to wonder at this. But at the moment all the thought of\nwhich her half-numbed mind was capable was bestowed upon their desperate\nerrand.\n\nThe carriage rolled across the Place Louis XV and out on to the Cours\nla Reine at last. Along that beautiful, tree-bordered avenue between the\nChamps Elysees and the Seine, almost empty at this hour of the day, they\nmade better speed, leaving now a cloud of dust behind them.\n\nBut fast to danger-point as was the speed, to the women in that carriage\nit was too slow. As they reached the barrier at the end of the Cours,\nnine o'clock was striking in the city behind them, and every stroke of\nit seemed to sound a note of doom.\n\nYet here at the barrier the regulations compelled a momentary halt.\nAline enquired of the sergeant-in-charge how long it was since a\ncabriolet such as she described had gone that way. She was answered that\nsome twenty minutes ago a vehicle had passed the barrier containing the\ndeputy M. le Chapelier and the Paladin of the Third Estate, M. Moreau.\nThe sergeant was very well informed. He could make a shrewd guess, he\nsaid, with a grin, of the business that took M. Moreau that way so early\nin the day.\n\nThey left him, to speed on now through the open country, following the\nroad that continued to hug the river. They sat back mutely despairing,\nstaring hopelessly ahead, Aline's hand clasped tight in madame's. In the\ndistance, across the meadows on their right, they could see already the\nlong, dusky line of trees of the Bois, and presently the carriage swung\naside following a branch of the road that turned to the right, away from\nthe river and heading straight for the forest.\n\nMademoiselle broke at last the silence of hopelessness that had reigned\nbetween them since they had passed the barrier.\n\n\"Oh, it is impossible that we should come in time! Impossible!\"\n\n\"Don't say it! Don't say it!\" madame cried out.\n\n\"But it is long past nine, madame! Andre would be punctual, and these...\naffairs do not take long. It... it will be all over by now.\"\n\nMadame shivered, and closed her eyes. Presently, however, she opened\nthem again, and stirred. Then she put her head from the window. \"A\ncarriage is approaching,\" she announced, and her tone conveyed the thing\nshe feared.\n\n\"Not already! Oh, not already!\" Thus Aline expressed the silently\ncommunicated thought. She experienced a difficulty in breathing, felt\nthe sudden need of air. Something in her throat was throbbing as if it\nwould suffocate her; a mist came and went before her eyes.\n\nIn a cloud of dust an open caleche was speeding towards them, coming\nfrom the Bois. They watched it, both pale, neither venturing to speak,\nAline, indeed, without breath to do so.\n\nAs it approached, it slowed down, perforce, as they did, to effect a\nsafe passage in that narrow road. Aline was at the window with Mme. de\nPlougastel, and with fearful eyes both looked into this open carriage\nthat was drawing abreast of them.\n\n\"Which of them is it, madame? Oh, which of them?\" gasped Aline, scarce\ndaring to look, her senses swimming.\n\nOn the near side sat a swarthy young gentleman unknown to either of the\nladies. He was smiling as he spoke to his companion. A moment later and\nthe man sitting beyond came into view. He was not smiling. His face was\nwhite and set, and it was the face of the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr.\n\nFor a long moment, in speechless horror, both women stared at him,\nuntil, perceiving them, blankest surprise invaded his stern face.\n\nIn that moment, with a long shuddering sigh Aline sank swooning to the\ncarriage floor behind Mme. de Plougastel.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. INFERENCES\n\nBy fast driving Andre-Louis had reached the ground some minutes ahead\nof time, notwithstanding the slight delay in setting out. There he\nhad found M. de La Tour d'Azyr already awaiting him, supported by a M.\nd'Ormesson, a swarthy young gentleman in the blue uniform of a captain\nin the Gardes du Corps.\n\nAndre-Louis had been silent and preoccupied throughout that drive. He\nwas perturbed by his last interview with Mademoiselle de Kercadiou and\nthe rash inferences which he had drawn as to her motives.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" he had said, \"this man must be killed.\"\n\nLe Chapelier had not answered him. Almost, indeed, had the Breton\nshuddered at his compatriot's cold-bloodedness. He had often of late\nthought that this fellow Moreau was hardly human. Also he had found him\nincomprehensibly inconsistent. When first this spadassinicide business\nhad been proposed to him, he had been so very lofty and disdainful. Yet,\nhaving embraced it, he went about it at times with a ghoulish flippancy\nthat was revolting, at times with a detachment that was more revolting\nstill.\n\nTheir preparations were made quickly and in silence, yet without undue\nhaste or other sign of nervousness on either side. In both men the same\ngrim determination prevailed. The opponent must be killed; there could\nbe no half-measures here. Stripped each of coat and waistcoat, shoeless\nand with shirt-sleeves rolled to the elbow, they faced each other at\nlast, with the common resolve of paying in full the long score that\nstood between them. I doubt if either of them entertained a misgiving as\nto what must be the issue.\n\nBeside them, and opposite each other, stood Le Chapelier and the young\ncaptain, alert and watchful.\n\n\"Allez, messieurs!\"\n\nThe slender, wickedly delicate blades clashed together, and after a\nmomentary glizade were whirling, swift and bright as lightnings, and\nalmost as impossible to follow with the eye. The Marquis led the attack,\nimpetuously and vigorously, and almost at once Andre-Louis realized that\nhe had to deal with an opponent of a very different mettle from those\nsuccessive duellists of last week, not excluding La Motte-Royau, of\nterrible reputation.\n\nHere was a man whom much and constant practice had given extraordinary\nspeed and a technique that was almost perfect. In addition, he enjoyed\nover Andre-Louis physical advantages of strength and length of reach,\nwhich rendered him altogether formidable. And he was cool, too; cool and\nself-contained; fearless and purposeful. Would anything shake that calm,\nwondered Andre-Louis?\n\nHe desired the punishment to be as full as he could make it. Not content\nto kill the Marquis as the Marquis had killed Philippe, he desired\nthat he should first know himself as powerless to avert that death as\nPhilippe had been. Nothing less would content Andre-Louis. M. le Marquis\nmust begin by tasting of that cup of despair. It was in the account;\npart of the quittance due.\n\nAs with a breaking sweep Andre-Louis parried the heavy lunge in which\nthat first series of passes culminated, he actually laughed--gleefully,\nafter the fashion of a boy at a sport he loves.\n\nThat extraordinary, ill-timed laugh made M. de La Tour d'Azyr's recovery\nhastier and less correctly dignified than it would otherwise have been.\nIt startled and discomposed him, who had already been discomposed by\nthe failure to get home with a lunge so beautifully timed and so truly\ndelivered.\n\nHe, too, had realized that his opponent's force was above anything that\nhe could have expected, fencing-master though he might be, and on that\naccount he had put forth his utmost energy to make an end at once.\n\nMore than the actual parry, the laugh by which it was accompanied seemed\nto make of that end no more than a beginning. And yet it was the end of\nsomething. It was the end of that absolute confidence that had hitherto\ninspired M. de La Tour d'Azyr. He no longer looked upon the issue as a\nthing forgone. He realized that if he was to prevail in this encounter,\nhe must go warily and fence as he had never fenced yet in all his life.\n\nThey settled down again; and again--on the principle this time that the\nsoundest defence is in attack--it was the Marquis who made the game.\nAndre-Louis allowed him to do so, desired him to do so; desired him\nto spend himself and that magnificent speed of his against the greater\nspeed that whole days of fencing in succession for nearly two years had\ngiven the master. With a beautiful, easy pressure of forte on foible\nAndre-Louis kept himself completely covered in that second bout, which\nonce more culminated in a lunge.\n\nExpecting it now, Andre-Louis parried it by no more than a deflecting\ntouch. At the same moment he stepped suddenly forward, right within the\nother's guard, thus placing his man so completely at his mercy that, as\nif fascinated, the Marquis did not even attempt to recover himself.\n\nThis time Andre-Louis did not laugh: He just smiled into the dilating\neyes of M. de La Tour d'Azyr, and made no shift to use his advantage.\n\n\"Come, come, monsieur!\" he bade him sharply. \"Am I to run my blade\nthrough an uncovered man?\" Deliberately he fell back, whilst his shaken\nopponent recovered himself at last.\n\nM. d'Ormesson released the breath which horror had for a moment caught.\nLe Chapelier swore softly, muttering:\n\n\"Name of a name! It is tempting Providence to play the fool in this\nfashion!\"\n\nAndre-Louis observed the ashen pallor that now over spread the face of\nhis opponent.\n\n\"I think you begin to realize, monsieur, what Philippe de Vilmorin must\nhave felt that day at Gavrillac. I desired that you should first do so.\nSince that is accomplished, why, here's to make an end.\"\n\nHe went in with lightning rapidity. For a moment his point seemed to La\nTour d'Azyr to be everywhere at once, and then from a low engagement\nin sixte, Andre-Louis stretched forward with swift and vigorous ease\nto lunge in tierce. He drove his point to transfix his opponent whom\na series of calculated disengages uncovered in that line. But to his\namazement and chagrin, La Tour d'Azyr parried the stroke; infinitely\nmore to his chagrin La Tour d'Azyr parried it just too late. Had he\ncompletely parried it, all would yet have been well. But striking the\nblade in the last fraction of a second, the Marquis deflected the point\nfrom the line of his body, yet not so completely but that a couple\nof feet of that hard-driven steel tore through the muscles of his\nsword-arm.\n\nTo the seconds none of these details had been visible. All that they\nhad seen had been a swift whirl of flashing blades, and then Andre-Louis\nstretched almost to the ground in an upward lunge that had pierced the\nMarquis' right arm just below the shoulder.\n\nThe sword fell from the suddenly relaxed grip of La Tour d'Azyr's\nfingers, which had been rendered powerless, and he stood now disarmed,\nhis lip in his teeth, his face white, his chest heaving, before his\nopponent, who had at once recovered. With the blood-tinged tip of his\nsword resting on the ground, Andre-Louis surveyed him grimly, as we\nsurvey the prey that through our own clumsiness has escaped us at the\nlast moment.\n\nIn the Assembly and in the newspapers this might be hailed as another\nvictory for the Paladin of the Third Estate; only himself could know the\nextent and the bitternest of the failure.\n\nM. d'Ormesson had sprung to the side of his principal.\n\n\"You are hurt!\" he had cried stupidly.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" said La Tour d'Azyr. \"A scratch.\" But his lip writhed,\nand the torn sleeve of his fine cambric shirt was full of blood.\n\nD'Ormesson, a practical man in such matters, produced a linen kerchief,\nwhich he tore quickly into strips to improvise a bandage.\n\nStill Andre-Louis continued to stand there, looking on as if bemused. He\ncontinued so until Le Chapelier touched him on the arm. Then at last he\nroused himself, sighed, and turned away to resume his garments, nor did\nhe address or look again at his late opponent, but left the ground at\nonce.\n\nAs, with Le Chapelier, he was walking slowly and in silent dejection\ntowards the entrance of the Bois, where they had left their carriage,\nthey were passed by the caleche conveying La Tour d'Azyr and his\nsecond--which had originally driven almost right up to the spot of the\nencounter. The Marquis' wounded arm was carried in a sling improvised\nfrom his companion's sword-belt. His sky-blue coat with three collars\nhad been buttoned over this, so that the right sleeve hung empty.\nOtherwise, saving a certain pallor, he looked much his usual self.\n\nAnd now you understand how it was that he was the first to return,\nand that seeing him thus returning, apparently safe and sound, the two\nladies, intent upon preventing the encounter, should have assumed that\ntheir worst fears were realized.\n\nMme. de Plougastel attempted to call out, but her voice refused its\noffice. She attempted to throw open the door of her own carriage; but\nher fingers fumbled clumsily and ineffectively with the handle. And\nmeanwhile the caleche was slowly passing, La Tour d'Azyr's fine eyes\nsombrely yet intently meeting her own anguished gaze. And then she\nsaw something else. M. d'Ormesson, leaning back again from the forward\ninclination of his body to join his own to his companion's salutation of\nthe Countess, disclosed the empty right sleeve of M. de La Tour d'Azyr's\nblue coat. More, the near side of the coat itself turned back from the\npoint near the throat where it was caught together by a single button,\nrevealed the slung arm beneath in its blood-sodden cambric sleeve.\n\nEven now she feared to jump to the obvious conclusion--feared lest\nperhaps the Marquis, though himself wounded, might have dealt his\nadversary a deadlier wound.\n\nShe found her voice at last, and at the same moment signalled to the\ndriver of the caleche to stop.\n\nAs it was pulled to a standstill, M. d'Ormesson alighted, and so met\nmadame in the little space between the two carriages.\n\n\"Where is M. Moreau?\" was the question with which she surprised him.\n\n\"Following at his leisure, no doubt, madame,\" he answered, recovering.\n\n\"He is not hurt?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately it is we who...\" M. d'Ormesson was beginning, when from\nbehind him M. de La Tour d'Azyr's voice cut in crisply:\n\n\"This interest on your part in M. Moreau, dear Countess...\"\n\nHe broke off, observing a vague challenge in the air with which she\nconfronted him. But indeed his sentence did not need completing.\n\nThere was a vaguely awkward pause. And then she looked at M. d'Ormesson.\nHer manner changed. She offered what appeared to be an explanation of\nher concern for M. Moreau.\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Kercadiou is with me. The poor child has fainted.\"\n\nThere was more, a deal more, she would have said just then, but for M.\nd'Ormesson's presence.\n\nMoved by a deep solicitude for Mademoiselle de Kertadiou, de La Tour\nd'Azyr sprang up despite his wound.\n\n\"I am in poor case to render assistance, madame,\" he said, an apologetic\nsmile on his pale face. \"But...\"\n\nWith the aid of d'Ormesson, and in spite of the latter's protestations,\nhe got down from the caleche, which then moved on a little way, so as to\nleave the road clear--for another carriage that was approaching from the\ndirection of the Bois.\n\nAnd thus it happened that when a few moments later that approaching\ncabriolet overtook and passed the halted vehicles, Andre-Louis beheld a\nvery touching scene. Standing up to obtain a better view, he saw Aline\nin a half-swooning condition--she was beginning to revive by now--seated\nin the doorway of the carriage, supported by Mme. de Plougastel. In\nan attitude of deepest concern, M. de La Tour d'Azyr, his wound\nnotwithstanding, was bending over the girl, whilst behind him stood M.\nd'Ormesson and madame's footman.\n\nThe Countess looked up and saw him as he was driven past. Her face\nlighted; almost it seemed to him she was about to greet him or to call\nhim, wherefore, to avoid a difficulty, arising out of the presence there\nof his late antagonist, he anticipated her by bowing frigidly--for his\nmood was frigid, the more frigid by virtue of what he saw--and then\nresumed his seat with eyes that looked deliberately ahead.\n\nCould anything more completely have confirmed him in his conviction that\nit was on M. de La Tour d'Azyr's account that Aline had come to plead\nwith him that morning? For what his eyes had seen, of course, was a lady\novercome with emotion at the sight of blood of her dear friend, and that\nsame dear friend restoring her with assurances that his hurt was very\nfar from mortal. Later, much later, he was to blame his own perverse\nstupidity. Almost is he too severe in his self-condemnation. For how\nelse could he have interpreted the scene he beheld, his preconceptions\nbeing what they were?\n\nThat which he had already been suspecting, he now accounted proven to\nhim. Aline had been wanting in candour on the subject of her feelings\ntowards M. de La Tour d'Azyr. It was, he supposed, a woman's way to be\nsecretive in such matters, and he must not blame her. Nor could he blame\nher in his heart for having succumbed to the singular charm of such a\nman as the Marquis--for not even his hostility could blind him to M. de\nLa Tour d'Azyr's attractions. That she had succumbed was betrayed, he\nthought, by the weakness that had overtaken her upon seeing him wounded.\n\n\"My God!\" he cried aloud. \"What must she have suffered, then, if I had\nkilled him as I intended!\"\n\nIf only she had used candour with him, she could so easily have won his\nconsent to the thing she asked. If only she had told him what now he\nsaw, that she loved M. de La Tour d'Azyr, instead of leaving him to\nassume her only regard for the Marquis to be based on unworthy worldly\nambition, he would at once have yielded.\n\nHe fetched a sigh, and breathed a prayer for forgiveness to the shade of\nVilmorin.\n\n\"It is perhaps as well that my lunge went wide,\" he said.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" wondered Le Chapelier.\n\n\"That in this business I must relinquish all hope of recommencing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. THE OVERWHELMING REASON\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr was seen no more in the Manege--or indeed in Paris\nat all--throughout all the months that the National Assembly remained in\nsession to complete its work of providing France with a constitution.\nAfter all, though the wound to his body had been comparatively slight,\nthe wound to such a pride as his had been all but mortal.\n\nThe rumour ran that he had emigrated. But that was only half the truth.\nThe whole of it was that he had joined that group of noble travellers\nwho came and went between the Tuileries and the headquarters of the\nemigres at Coblenz. He became, in short, a member of the royalist secret\nservice that in the end was to bring down the monarchy in ruins.\n\nAs for Andre-Louis, his godfather's house saw him no more, as a result\nof his conviction that M. de Kercadiou would not relent from his written\nresolve never to receive him again if the duel were fought.\n\nHe threw himself into his duties at the Assembly with such zeal and\neffect that when--its purpose accomplished--the Constituent was dissolved\nin September of the following year, membership of the Legislative, whose\nelection followed immediately, was thrust upon him.\n\nHe considered then, like many others, that the Revolution was a thing\naccomplished, that France had only to govern herself by the Constitution\nwhich had been given her, and that all would now be well. And so it\nmight have been but that the Court could not bring itself to accept the\naltered state of things. As a result of its intrigues half Europe was\narming to hurl herself upon France, and her quarrel was the quarrel of\nthe French King with his people. That was the horror at the root of all\nthe horrors that were to come.\n\nOf the counter-revolutionary troubles that were everywhere being stirred\nup by the clergy, none were more acute than those of Brittany, and,\nin view of the influence it was hoped he would wield in his native\nprovince, it was proposed to Andre-Louis by the Commission of Twelve,\nin the early days of the Girondin ministry, that he should go thither to\ncombat the unrest. He was desired to proceed peacefully, but his powers\nwere almost absolute, as is shown by the orders he carried--orders\nenjoining all to render him assistance and warning those who might\nhinder him that they would do so at their peril.\n\nHe accepted the task, and he was one of the five plenipotentiaries\ndespatched on the same errand in that spring of 1792. It kept him absent\nfrom Paris for four months and might have kept him longer but that at\nthe beginning of August he was recalled. More imminent than any trouble\nin Brittany was the trouble brewing in Paris itself; when the political\nsky was blacker than it had been since '89. Paris realized that the hour\nwas rapidly approaching which would see the climax of the long struggle\nbetween Equality and Privilege. And it was towards a city so disposed\nthat Andre-Louis came speeding from the West, to find there also the\nclimax of his own disturbed career.\n\nMlle. de Kercadiou, too, was in Paris in those days of early August, on\na visit to her uncle's cousin and dearest friend, Mme. de Plougastel.\nAnd although nothing could now be plainer than the seething unrest\nthat heralded the explosion to come, yet the air of gaiety, indeed of\njocularity, prevailing at Court--whither madame and mademoiselle went\nalmost daily--reassured them. M. de Plougastel had come and gone again,\nback to Coblenz on that secret business that kept him now almost\nconstantly absent from his wife. But whilst with her he had positively\nassured her that all measures were taken, and that an insurrection was\na thing to be welcomed, because it could have one only conclusion, the\nfinal crushing of the Revolution in the courtyard of the Tuileries.\nThat, he added, was why the King remained in Paris. But for his\nconfidence in that he would put himself in the centre of his Swiss and\nhis knights of the dagger, and quit the capital. They would hack a way\nout for him easily if his departure were opposed. But not even that\nwould be necessary.\n\nYet in those early days of August, after her husband's departure the\neffect of his inspiring words was gradually dissipated by the march\nof events under madame's own eyes. And finally on the afternoon of the\nninth, there arrived at the Hotel Plougastel a messenger from\nMeudon bearing a note from M. de Kercadiou in which he urgently\nbade mademoiselle join him there at once, and advised her hostess to\naccompany her.\n\nYou may have realized that M. de Kercadiou was of those who make friends\nwith men of all classes. His ancient lineage placed him on terms of\nequality with members of the noblesse; his simple manners--something\nbetween the rustic and the bourgeois--and his natural affability placed\nhim on equally good terms with those who by birth were his inferiors.\nIn Meudon he was known and esteemed of all the simple folk, and it was\nRougane, the friendly mayor, who, informed on the 9th of August of the\nstorm that was brewing for the morrow, and knowing of mademoiselle's\nabsence in Paris, had warningly advised him to withdraw her from what in\nthe next four-and-twenty hours might be a zone of danger for all persons\nof quality, particularly those suspected of connections with the Court\nparty.\n\nNow there was no doubt whatever of Mme. de Plougastel's connection with\nthe Court. It was not even to be doubted--indeed, measure of proof of\nit was to be forthcoming--that those vigilant and ubiquitous secret\nsocieties that watched over the cradle of the young revolution were\nfully informed of the frequent journeyings of M. de Plougastel to\nCoblenz, and entertained no illusions on the score of the reason for\nthem. Given, then, a defeat of the Court party in the struggle that\nwas preparing, the position in Paris of Mme. de Plougastel could not be\nother than fraught with danger, and that danger would be shared by any\nguest of birth at her hotel.\n\nM. de Kercadiou's affection for both those women quickened the fears\naroused in him by Rougane's warning. Hence that hastily dispatched note,\ndesiring his niece and imploring his friend to come at once to Meudon.\n\nThe friendly mayor carried his complaisance a step farther, and\ndispatched the letter to Paris by the hands of his own son, an\nintelligent lad of nineteen. It was late in the afternoon of that\nperfect August day when young Rougane presented himself at the Hotel\nPlougastel.\n\nHe was graciously received by Mme. de Plougastel in the salon, whose\nsplendours, when combined with the great air of the lady herself,\noverwhelmed the lad's simple, unsophisticated soul. Madame made up her\nmind at once.\n\nM. de Kercadiou's urgent message no more than confirmed her own fears\nand inclinations. She decided upon instant departure.\n\n\"Bien, madame,\" said the youth. \"Then I have the honour to take my\nleave.\"\n\nBut she would not let him go. First to the kitchen to refresh himself,\nwhilst she and mademoiselle made ready, and then a seat for him in her\ncarriage as far as Meudon. She could not suffer him to return on foot as\nhe had come.\n\nThough in all the circumstances it was no more than his due, yet the\nkindliness that in such a moment of agitation could take thought for\nanother was presently to be rewarded. Had she done less than this, she\nwould have known--if nothing worse--at least some hours of anguish even\ngreater than those that were already in store for her.\n\nIt wanted, perhaps, a half-hour to sunset when they set out in her\ncarriage with intent to leave Paris by the Porte Saint-Martin.\nThey travelled with a single footman behind. Rougane--terrifying\ncondescension--was given a seat inside the carriage with the ladies, and\nproceeded to fall in love with Mlle. de Kercadiou, whom he accounted the\nmost beautiful being he had ever seen, yet who talked to him simply and\nunaffectedly as with an equal. The thing went to his head a little, and\ndisturbed certain republican notions which he had hitherto conceived\nhimself to have thoroughly digested.\n\nThe carriage drew up at the barrier, checked there by a picket of the\nNational Guard posted before the iron gates.\n\nThe sergeant in command strode to the door of the vehicle. The Countess\nput her head from the window.\n\n\"The barrier is closed, madame,\" she was curtly informed.\n\n\"Closed!\" she echoed. The thing was incredible. \"But... but do you mean\nthat we cannot pass?\"\n\n\"Not unless you have a permit, madame.\" The sergeant leaned nonchalantly\non his pike. \"The orders are that no one is to leave or enter without\nproper papers.\"\n\n\"Whose orders?\"\n\n\"Orders of the Commune of Paris.\"\n\n\"But I must go into the country this evening.\" Madame's voice was almost\npetulant. \"I am expected.\"\n\n\"In that case let madame procure a permit.\"\n\n\"Where is it to be procured?\"\n\n\"At the Hotel de Ville or at the headquarters of madame's section.\"\n\nShe considered a moment. \"To the section, then. Be so good as to tell my\ncoachman to drive to the Bondy Section.\"\n\nHe saluted her and stepped back. \"Section Bondy, Rue des Morts,\" he bade\nthe driver.\n\nMadame sank into her seat again, in a state of agitation fully shared\nby mademoiselle. Rougane set himself to pacify and reassure them. The\nsection would put the matter in order. They would most certainly be\naccorded a permit. What possible reason could there be for refusing\nthem? A mere formality, after all!\n\nHis assurance uplifted them merely to prepare them for a still more\nprofound dejection when presently they met with a flat refusal from the\npresident of the section who received the Countess.\n\n\"Your name, madame?\" he had asked brusquely. A rude fellow of the most\nadvanced republican type, he had not even risen out of deference to\nthe ladies when they entered. He was there, he would have told you, to\nperform the duties of his office, not to give dancing-lessons.\n\n\"Plougastel,\" he repeated after her, without title, as if it had been\nthe name of a butcher or baker. He took down a heavy volume from a shelf\non his right, opened it and turned the pages. It was a sort of directory\nof his section. Presently he found what he sought. \"Comte de Plougastel,\nHotel Plougastel, Rue du Paradis. Is that it?\"\n\n\"That is correct, monsieur,\" she answered, with what civility she could\nmuster before the fellow's affronting rudeness.\n\nThere was a long moment of silence, during which he studied certain\npencilled entries against the name. The sections had been working in the\nlast few weeks much more systematically than was generally suspected.\n\n\"Your husband is with you, madame?\" he asked curtly, his eyes still\nconning that page.\n\n\"M. le Comte is not with me,\" she answered, stressing the title.\n\n\"Not with you?\" He looked up suddenly, and directed upon her a glance in\nwhich suspicion seemed to blend with derision. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He is not in Paris, monsieur.\n\n\"Ah! Is he at Coblenz, do you think?\"\n\nMadame felt herself turning cold. There was something ominous in all\nthis. To what end had the sections informed themselves so thoroughly of\nthe comings and goings of their inhabitants? What was preparing? She\nhad a sense of being trapped, of being taken in a net that had been cast\nunseen.\n\n\"I do not know, monsieur,\" she said, her voice unsteady.\n\n\"Of course not.\" He seemed to sneer. \"No matter. And you wish to leave\nParis also? Where do you desire to go?\"\n\n\"To Meudon.\"\n\n\"Your business there?\"\n\nThe blood leapt to her face. His insolence was unbearable to a woman who\nin all her life had never known anything but the utmost deference from\ninferiors and equals alike. Nevertheless, realizing that she was face\nto face with forces entirely new, she controlled herself, stifled her\nresentment, and answered steadily.\n\n\"I wish to conduct this lady, Mlle. de Kercadiou, back to her uncle who\nresides there.\"\n\n\"Is that all? Another day will do for that, madame. The matter is not\npressing.\"\n\n\"Pardon, monsieur, to us the matter is very pressing.\"\n\n\"You have not convinced me of it, and the barriers are closed to all\nwho cannot prove the most urgent and satisfactory reasons for wishing\nto pass. You will wait, madame, until the restriction is removed.\nGood-evening.\"\n\n\"But, monsieur...\"\n\n\"Good-evening, madame,\" he repeated significantly, a dismissal more\ncontemptuous and despotic than any royal \"You have leave to go.\"\n\nMadame went out with Aline. Both were quivering with the anger that\nprudence had urged them to suppress. They climbed into the coach again,\ndesiring to be driven home.\n\nRougane's astonishment turned into dismay when they told him what had\ntaken place. \"Why not try the Hotel de Ville, madame?\" he suggested.\n\n\"After that? It would be useless. We must resign ourselves to remaining\nin Paris until the barriers are opened again.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it will not matter to us either way by then, madame,\" said\nAline.\n\n\"Aline!\" she exclaimed in horror.\n\n\"Mademoiselle!\" cried Rougane on the same note. And then, because he\nperceived that people detained in this fashion must be in some danger\nnot yet discernible, but on that account more dreadful, he set his wits\nto work. As they were approaching the Hotel Plougastel once more, he\nannounced that he had solved the problem.\n\n\"A passport from without would do equally well,\" he announced. \"Listen,\nnow, and trust to me. I will go back to Meudon at once. My father\nshall give me two permits--one for myself alone, and another for three\npersons--from Meudon to Paris and back to Meudon. I reenter Paris with my\nown permit, which I then proceed to destroy, and we leave together,\nwe three, on the strength of the other one, representing ourselves as\nhaving come from Meudon in the course of the day. It is quite simple,\nafter all. If I go at once, I shall be back to-night.\"\n\n\"But how will you leave?\" asked Aline.\n\n\"I? Pooh! As to that, have no anxiety. My father is Mayor of Meudon.\nThere are plenty who know him. I will go to the Hotel de Ville, and tell\nthem what is, after all, true--that I am caught in Paris by the closing\nof the barriers, and that my father is expecting me home this evening.\nThey will pass me through. It is quite simple.\"\n\nHis confidence uplifted them again. The thing seemed as easy as he\nrepresented it.\n\n\"Then let your passport be for four, my friend,\" madame begged him.\n\"There is Jacques,\" she explained, indicating the footman who had just\nassisted them to alight.\n\nRougane departed confident of soon returning, leaving them to await him\nwith the same confidence. But the hours succeeded one another, the night\nclosed in, bedtime came, and still there was no sign of his return.\n\nThey waited until midnight, each pretending for the other's sake to a\nconfidence fully sustained, each invaded by vague premonitions of evil,\nyet beguiling the time by playing tric-trac in the great salon, as if\nthey had not a single anxious thought between them.\n\nAt last on the stroke of midnight, madame sighed and rose.\n\n\"It will be for to-morrow morning,\" she said, not believing it.\n\n\"Of course,\" Aline agreed. \"It would really have been impossible for\nhim to have returned to-night. And it will be much better to travel\nto-morrow. The journey at so late an hour would tire you so much, dear\nmadame.\"\n\nThus they made pretence.\n\nEarly in the morning they were awakened by a din of bells--the tocsins\nof the sections ringing the alarm. To their startled ears came later the\nrolling of drums, and at one time they heard the sounds of a multitude\non the march. Paris was rising. Later still came the rattle of\nsmall-arms in the distance and the deeper boom of cannon. Battle was\njoined between the men of the sections and the men of the Court. The\npeople in arms had attacked the Tuileries. Wildest rumours flew in all\ndirections, and some of them found their way through the servants to the\nHotel Plougastel, of that terrible fight for the palace which was to end\nin the purposeless massacre of all those whom the invertebrate monarch\nabandoned there, whilst placing himself and his family under the\nprotection of the Assembly. Purposeless to the end, ever adopting\nthe course pointed out to him by evil counsellors, he prepared for\nresistance only until the need for resistance really arose, whereupon he\nordered a surrender which left those who had stood by him to the last at\nthe mercy of a frenzied mob.\n\nAnd while this was happening in the Tuileries, the two women at the\nHotel Plougastel still waited for the return of Rougane, though now\nwith ever-lessening hope. And Rougane did not return. The affair did\nnot appear so simple to the father as to the son. Rougane the elder was\nrightly afraid to lend himself to such a piece of deception.\n\nHe went with his son to inform M. de Kercadiou of what had happened, and\ntold him frankly of the thing his son suggested, but which he dared not\ndo.\n\nM. de Kercadiou sought to move him by intercessions and even by the\noffer of bribes. But Rougane remained firm.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, \"if it were discovered against me, as it inevitably\nwould be, I should hang for it. Apart from that, and in spite of my\nanxiety to do all in my power to serve you, it would be a breach of\ntrust such as I could not contemplate. You must not ask me, monsieur.\"\n\n\"But what do you conceive is going to happen?\" asked the half-demented\ngentleman.\n\n\"It is war,\" said Rougane, who was well informed, as we have seen. \"War\nbetween the people and the Court. I am desolated that my warning should\nhave come too late. But, when all is said, I do not think that you need\nreally alarm yourself. War will not be made on women.\" M. de Kercadiou\nclung for comfort to that assurance after the mayor and his son had\ndeparted. But at the back of his mind there remained the knowledge\nof the traffic in which M. de Plougastel was engaged. What if the\nrevolutionaries were equally well informed? And most probably they were.\nThe women-folk political offenders had been known aforetime to suffer\nfor the sins of their men. Anything was possible in a popular upheaval,\nand Aline would be exposed jointly with Mme. de Plougastel.\n\nLate that night, as he sat gloomily in his brother's library, the pipe\nin which he had sought solace extinguished between his fingers, there\ncame a sharp knocking at the door.\n\nTo the old seneschal of Gavrillac who went to open there stood revealed\nupon the threshold a slim young man in a dark olive surcoat, the skirts\nof which reached down to his calves. He wore boots, buckskins, and a\nsmall-sword, and round his waist there was a tricolour sash, in his hat\na tricolour cockade, which gave him an official look extremely sinister\nto the eyes of that old retainer of feudalism, who shared to the full\nhis master's present fears.\n\n\"Monsieur desires?\" he asked, between respect and mistrust.\n\nAnd then a crisp voice startled him.\n\n\"Why, Benoit! Name of a name! Have you completely forgotten me?\"\n\nWith a shaking hand the old man raised the lantern he carried so as to\nthrow its light more fully upon that lean, wide-mouthed countenance.\n\n\"M. Andre!\" he cried. \"M. Andre!\" And then he looked at the sash and the\ncockade, and hesitated, apparently at a loss.\n\nBut Andre-Louis stepped past him into the wide vestibule, with its\ntessellated floor of black-and-white marble.\n\n\"If my godfather has not yet retired, take me to him. If he has retired,\ntake me to him all the same.\"\n\n\"Oh, but certainly, M. Andre--and I am sure he will be ravished to see\nyou. No, he has not yet retired. This way, M. Andre; this way, if you\nplease.\"\n\nThe returning Andre-Louis, reaching Meudon a half-hour ago, had gone\nstraight to the mayor for some definite news of what might be happening\nin Paris that should either confirm or dispel the ominous rumours that\nhe had met in ever-increasing volume as he approached the capital.\nRougane informed him that insurrection was imminent, that already the\nsections had possessed themselves of the barriers, and that it was\nimpossible for any person not fully accredited to enter or leave the\ncity.\n\nAndre-Louis bowed his head, his thoughts of the gravest. He had for\nsome time perceived the danger of this second revolution from within the\nfirst, which might destroy everything that had been done, and give the\nreins of power to a villainous faction that would plunge the country\ninto anarchy. The thing he had feared was more than ever on the point\nof taking place. He would go on at once, that very night, and see for\nhimself what was happening.\n\nAnd then, as he was leaving, he turned again to Rougane to ask if M. de\nKercadiou was still at Meudon.\n\n\"You know him, monsieur?\"\n\n\"He is my godfather.\"\n\n\"Your godfather! And you a representative! Why, then, you may be the\nvery man he needs.\" And Rougane told him of his son's errand into Paris\nthat afternoon and its result.\n\nNo more was required. That two years ago his godfather should upon\ncertain terms have refused him his house weighed for nothing at the\nmoment. He left his travelling carriage at the little inn and went\nstraight to M. de Kercadiou.\n\nAnd M. de Kercadiou, startled in such an hour by this sudden apparition,\nof one against whom he nursed a bitter grievance, greeted him in terms\nalmost identical with those in which in that same room he had greeted\nhim on a similar occasion once before.\n\n\"What do you want here, sir?\"\n\n\"To serve you if possible, my godfather,\" was the disarming answer.\n\nBut it did not disarm M. de Kercadiou. \"You have stayed away so long\nthat I hoped you would not again disturb me.\"\n\n\"I should not have ventured to disobey you now were it not for the hope\nthat I can be of service. I have seen Rougane, the mayor...\"\n\n\"What's that you say about not venturing to disobey?\"\n\n\"You forbade me your house, monsieur.\"\n\nM. de Kercadiou stared at him helplessly.\n\n\"And is that why you have not come near me in all this time?\"\n\n\"Of course. Why else?\"\n\nM. de Kercadiou continued to stare. Then he swore under his breath. It\ndisconcerted him to have to deal with a man who insisted upon taking\nhim so literally. He had expected that Andre-Louis would have come\ncontritely to admit his fault and beg to be taken back into favour. He\nsaid so.\n\n\"But how could I hope that you meant less than you said, monsieur?\nYou were so very definite in your declaration. What expressions of\ncontrition could have served me without a purpose of amendment? And I\nhad no notion of amending. We may yet be thankful for that.\"\n\n\"Thankful?\"\n\n\"I am a representative. I have certain powers. I am very opportunely\nreturning to Paris. Can I serve you where Rougane cannot? The need,\nmonsieur, would appear to be very urgent if the half of what I suspect\nis true. Aline should be placed in safety at once.\"\n\nM. de Kercadiou surrendered unconditionally. He came over and took\nAndre-Louis' hand.\n\n\"My boy,\" he said, and he was visibly moved, \"there is in you a certain\nnobility that is not to be denied. If I seemed harsh with you, then, it\nwas because I was fighting against your evil proclivities. I desired\nto keep you out of the evil path of politics that have brought this\nunfortunate country into so terrible a pass. The enemy on the frontier;\ncivil war about to flame out at home. That is what you revolutionaries\nhave done.\"\n\nAndre-Louis did not argue. He passed on.\n\n\"About Aline?\" he asked. And himself answered his own question: \"She is\nin Paris, and she must be brought out of it at once, before the place\nbecomes a shambles, as well it may once the passions that have been\nbrewing all these months are let loose. Young Rougane's plan is good. At\nleast, I cannot think of a better one.\"\n\n\"But Rougane the elder will not hear of it.\"\n\n\"You mean he will not do it on his own responsibility. But he has\nconsented to do it on mine. I have left him a note over my signature to\nthe effect that a safe-conduct for Mlle. de Kercadiou to go to Paris and\nreturn is issued by him in compliance with orders from me. The powers I\ncarry and of which I have satisfied him are his sufficient justification\nfor obeying me in this. I have left him that note on the understanding\nthat he is to use it only in an extreme case, for his own protection. In\nexchange he has given me this safe-conduct.\"\n\n\"You already have it!\"\n\nM. de Kercadiou took the sheet of paper that Andre-Louis held out. His\nhand shook. He approached it to the cluster of candles burning on the\nconsole and screwed up his short-sighted eyes to read.\n\n\"If you send that to Paris by young Rougane in the morning,\" said\nAndre-Louis, \"Aline should be here by noon. Nothing, of course, could\nbe done to-night without provoking suspicion. The hour is too late. And\nnow, monsieur my godfather, you know exactly why I intrude in violation\nof your commands. If there is any other way in which I can serve you,\nyou have but to name it whilst I am here.\"\n\n\"But there is, Andre. Did not Rougane tell you that there were\nothers...\"\n\n\"He mentioned Mme. de Plougastel and her servant.\"\n\n\"Then why...?\" M. de Kercadiou broke off, looking his question.\n\nVery solemnly Andre-Louis shook his head.\n\n\"That is impossible,\" he said.\n\nM. de Kercadiou's mouth fell open in astonishment. \"Impossible!\" he\nrepeated. \"But why?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I can do what I am doing for Aline without offending my\nconscience. Besides, for Aline I would offend my conscience and do it.\nBut Mme. de Plougastel is in very different case. Neither Aline nor any\nof hers have been concerned in counter-revolutionary work, which is the\ntrue source of the calamity that now threatens to overtake us. I can\nprocure her removal from Paris without self-reproach, convinced that I\nam doing nothing that any one could censure, or that might become the\nsubject of enquiries. But Mme. de Plougastel is the wife of M. le Comte\nde Plougastel, whom all the world knows to be an agent between the Court\nand the emigres.\"\n\n\"That is no fault of hers,\" cried M. de Kercadiou through his\nconsternation.\n\n\"Agreed. But she may be called upon at any moment to establish the fact\nthat she is not a party to these manoeuvres. It is known that she was in\nParis to-day. Should she be sought to-morrow and should it be found\nthat she has gone, enquiries will certainly be made, from which it must\nresult that I have betrayed my trust, and abused my powers to serve\npersonal ends. I hope, monsieur, that you will understand that the risk\nis too great to be run for the sake of a stranger.\"\n\n\"A stranger?\" said the Seigneur reproachfully.\n\n\"Practically a stranger to me,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"But she is not a stranger to me, Andre. She is my cousin and very dear\nand valued friend. And, mon Dieu, what you say but increases the\nurgency of getting her out of Paris. She must be rescued, Andre, at all\ncosts--she must be rescued! Why, her case is infinitely more urgent than\nAline's!\"\n\nHe stood a suppliant before his godson, very different now from the\nstern man who had greeted him on his arrival. His face was pale, his\nhands shook, and there were beads of perspiration on his brow.\n\n\"Monsieur my godfather, I would do anything in reason. But I cannot do\nthis. To rescue her might mean ruin for Aline and yourself as well as\nfor me.\"\n\n\"We must take the risk.\"\n\n\"You have a right to speak for yourself, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh, and for you, believe me, Andre, for you!\" He came close to the\nyoung man. \"Andre, I implore you to take my word for that, and to obtain\nthis permit for Mme. de Plougastel.\"\n\nAndre looked at him mystified. \"This is fantastic,\" he said. \"I have\ngrateful memories of the lady's interest in me for a few days once\nwhen I was a child, and again more recently in Paris when she sought to\nconvert me to what she accounts the true political religion. But I do\nnot risk my neck for her--no, nor yours, nor Aline's.\"\n\n\"Ah! But, Andre...\"\n\n\"That is my last word, monsieur. It is growing late, and I desire to\nsleep in Paris.\"\n\n\"No, no! Wait!\" The Lord of Gavrillac was displaying signs of\nunspeakable distress. \"Andre, you must!\"\n\nThere was in this insistence and, still more, in the frenzied manner of\nit, something so unreasonable that Andre could not fail to assume that\nsome dark and mysterious motive lay behind it.\n\n\"I must?\" he echoed. \"Why must I? Your reasons, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Andre, my reasons are overwhelming.\"\n\n\"Pray allow me to be the judge of that.\" Andre-Louis' manner was almost\nperemptory.\n\nThe demand seemed to reduce M. de Kercadiou to despair. He paced the\nroom, his hands tight-clasped behind him, his brow wrinkled. At last he\ncame to stand before his godson.\n\n\"Can't you take my word for it that these reasons exist?\" he cried in\nanguish.\n\n\"In such a matter as this--a matter that may involve my neck? Oh,\nmonsieur, is that reasonable?\"\n\n\"I violate my word of honour, my oath, if I tell you.\" M. de Kercadiou\nturned away, wringing his hands, his condition visibly piteous; then\nturned again to Andre. \"But in this extremity, in this desperate\nextremity, and since you so ungenerously insist, I shall have to tell\nyou. God help me, I have no choice. She will realize that when she\nknows. Andre, my boy...\" He paused again, a man afraid. He set a hand\non his godson's shoulder, and to his increasing amazement Andre-Louis\nperceived that over those pale, short-sighted eyes there was a film of\ntears. \"Mme. de Plougastel is your mother.\"\n\nFollowed, for a long moment, utter silence. This thing that he was\ntold was not immediately understood. When understanding came at last\nAndre-Louis' first impulse was to cry out. But he possessed himself,\nand played the Stoic. He must ever be playing something. That was in his\nnature. And he was true to his nature even in this supreme moment. He\ncontinued silent until, obeying that queer histrionic instinct, he could\ntrust himself to speak without emotion. \"I see,\" he said, at last, quite\ncoolly.\n\nHis mind was sweeping back over the past. Swiftly he reviewed his\nmemories of Mme. de Plougastel, her singular if sporadic interest in\nhim, the curious blend of affection and wistfulness which her manner\ntowards him had always presented, and at last he understood so much that\nhitherto had intrigued him.\n\n\"I see,\" he said again; and added now, \"Of course, any but a fool would\nhave guessed it long ago.\"\n\nIt was M. de Kercadiou who cried out, M. de Kercadiou who recoiled as\nfrom a blow.\n\n\"My God, Andre, of what are you made? You can take such an announcement\nin this fashion?\"\n\n\"And how would you have me take it? Should it surprise me to discover\nthat I had a mother? After all, a mother is an indispensable necessity\nto getting one's self born.\"\n\nHe sat down abruptly, to conceal the too-revealing fact that his limbs\nwere shaking. He pulled a handkerchief from his pocket to mop his\nbrow, which had grown damp. And then, quite suddenly, he found himself\nweeping.\n\nAt the sight of those tears streaming silently down that face that had\nturned so pale, M. de Kercadiou came quickly across to him. He sat down\nbeside him and threw an arm affectionately over his shoulder.\n\n\"Andre, my poor lad,\" he murmured. \"I... I was fool enough to think you\nhad no heart. You deceived me with your infernal pretence, and now I\nsee... I see...\" He was not sure what it was that he saw, or else he\nhesitated to express it.\n\n\"It is nothing, monsieur. I am tired out, and... and I have a cold in\nthe head.\" And then, finding the part beyond his power, he abruptly\nthrew it up, utterly abandoned all pretence. \"Why... why has there been\nall this mystery?\" he asked. \"Was it intended that I should never know?\"\n\n\"It was, Andre. It... it had to be, for prudence' sake.\"\n\n\"But why? Complete your confidence, sir. Surely you cannot leave it\nthere. Having told me so much, you must tell me all.\"\n\n\"The reason, my boy, is that you were born some three years after your\nmother's marriage with M. de Plougastel, some eighteen months after M.\nde Plougastel had been away with the army, and some four months before\nhis return to his wife. It is a matter that M. de Plougastel has never\nsuspected, and for gravest family reasons must never suspect. That is\nwhy the utmost secrecy has been preserved. That is why none was ever\nallowed to know. Your mother came betimes into Brittany, and under an\nassumed name spent some months in the village of Moreau. It was while\nshe was there that you were born.\"\n\nAndre-Louis turned it over in his mind. He had dried his tears. And sat\nnow rigid and collected.\n\n\"When you say that none was ever allowed to know, you are telling me, of\ncourse, that you, monsieur...\"\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu, no!\" The denial came in a violent outburst. M. de\nKercadiou sprang to his feet propelled from Andre's side by the violence\nof his emotions. It was as if the very suggestion filled him with\nhorror. \"I was the only other one who knew. But it is not as you think,\nAndre. You cannot imagine that I should lie to you, that I should deny\nyou if you were my son?\"\n\n\"If you say that I am not, monsieur, that is sufficient.\"\n\n\"You are not. I was Therese's cousin and also, as she well knew, her\ntruest friend. She knew that she could trust me; and it was to me she\ncame for help in her extremity. Once, years before, I would have married\nher. But, of course, I am not the sort of man a woman could love. She\ntrusted, however, to my love for her, and I have kept her trust.\"\n\n\"Then, who was my father?\"\n\n\"I don't know. She never told me. It was her secret, and I did not pry.\nIt is not in my nature, Andre.\"\n\nAndre-Louis got up, and stood silently facing M. de Kercadiou.\n\n\"You believe me, Andre.\"\n\n\"Naturally, monsieur; and I am sorry, I am sorry that I am not your\nson.\"\n\nM. de Kercadiou gripped his godson's hand convulsively, and held it\na moment with no word spoken. Then as they fell away from each other\nagain:\n\n\"And now, what will you do, Andre?\" he asked. \"Now that you know?\"\n\nAndre-Louis stood awhile, considering, then broke into laughter. The\nsituation had its humours. He explained them.\n\n\"What difference should the knowledge make? Is filial piety to be called\ninto existence by the mere announcement of relationship? Am I to risk\nmy neck through lack of circumspection on behalf of a mother so very\ncircumspect that she had no intention of ever revealing herself? The\ndiscovery rests upon the merest chance, upon a fall of the dice of Fate.\nIs that to weigh with me?\"\n\n\"The decision is with you, Andre.\"\n\n\"Nay, it is beyond me. Decide it who can, I cannot.\"\n\n\"You mean that you refuse even now?\"\n\n\"I mean that I consent. Since I cannot decide what it is that I should\ndo, it only remains for me to do what a son should. It is grotesque; but\nall life is grotesque.\"\n\n\"You will never, never regret it.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Andre. \"Yet I think it very likely that I shall.\nAnd now I had better see Rougane again at once, and obtain from him the\nother two permits required. Then perhaps it will be best that I take\nthem to Paris myself, in the morning. If you will give me a bed,\nmonsieur, I shall be grateful. I... I confess that I am hardly in case\nto do more to-night.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. SANCTUARY\n\nInto the late afternoon of that endless day of horror with its perpetual\nalarms, its volleying musketry, rolling drums, and distant muttering\nof angry multitudes, Mme. de Plougastel and Aline sat waiting in that\nhandsome house in the Rue du Paradis. It was no longer for Rougane they\nwaited. They realized that, be the reason what it might--and by now many\nreasons must no doubt exist--this friendly messenger would not return.\nThey waited without knowing for what. They waited for whatever might\nbetide.\n\nAt one time early in the afternoon the roar of battle approached them,\nracing swiftly in their direction, swelling each moment in volume and in\nhorror. It was the frenzied clamour of a multitude drunk with blood and\nbent on destruction. Near at hand that fierce wave of humanity checked\nin its turbulent progress. Followed blows of pikes upon a door and\nimperious calls to open, and thereafter came the rending of timbers,\nthe shivering of glass, screams of terror blending with screams of rage,\nand, running through these shrill sounds, the deeper diapason of bestial\nlaughter.\n\nIt was a hunt of two wretched Swiss guardsmen seeking blindly to escape.\nAnd they were run to earth in a house in the neighbourhood, and there\ncruelly done to death by that demoniac mob. The thing accomplished, the\nhunters, male and female, forming into a battalion, came swinging down\nthe Rue du Paradis, chanting the song of Marseilles--a song new to Paris\nin those days:\n\n\n    Allons, enfants de la patrie!\n    Le jour de gloire est arrive\n    Contre nous de la tyrannie\n    L'etendard sanglant est leve.\n\nNearer it came, raucously bawled by some hundreds of voices, a dread\nsound that had come so suddenly to displace at least temporarily\nthe merry, trivial air of the \"Ca ira!\" which hitherto had been the\nrevolutionary carillon. Instinctively Mme. de Plougastel and Aline clung\nto each other. They had heard the sound of the ravishing of that other\nhouse in the neighbourhood, without knowledge of the reason. What if now\nit should be the turn of the Hotel Plougastel! There was no real\ncause to fear it, save that amid a turmoil imperfectly understood and\ntherefore the more awe-inspiring, the worst must be feared always.\n\nThe dreadful song so dreadfully sung, and the thunder of heavily shod\nfeet upon the roughly paved street, passed on and receded. They breathed\nagain, almost as if a miracle had saved them, to yield to fresh alarm an\ninstant later, when madame's young footman, Jacques, the most trusted\nof her servants, burst into their presence unceremoniously with a scared\nface, bringing the announcement that a man who had just climbed over the\ngarden wall professed himself a friend of madame's, and desired to be\nbrought immediately to her presence.\n\n\"But he looks like a sansculotte, madame,\" the staunch fellow warned\nher.\n\nHer thoughts and hopes leapt at once to Rougane.\n\n\"Bring him in,\" she commanded breathlessly.\n\nJacques went out, to return presently accompanied by a tall man in a\nlong, shabby, and very ample overcoat and a wide-brimmed hat that was\nturned down all round, and adorned by an enormous tricolour cockade.\nThis hat he removed as he entered.\n\nJacques, standing behind him, perceived that his hair, although now\nin some disorder, bore signs of having been carefully dressed. It was\nclubbed, and it carried some lingering vestiges of powder. The young\nfootman wondered what it was in the man's face, which was turned from\nhim, that should cause his mistress to out and recoil. Then he found\nhimself dismissed abruptly by a gesture.\n\nThe newcomer advanced to the middle of the salon, moving like a man\nexhausted and breathing hard. There he leaned against a table, across\nwhich he confronted Mme. de Plougastel. And she stood regarding him, a\nstrange horror in her eyes.\n\nIn the background, on a settle at the salon's far end, sat Aline staring\nin bewilderment and some fear at a face which, if unrecognizable through\nthe mask of blood and dust that smeared it, was yet familiar. And then\nthe man spoke, and instantly she knew the voice for that of the Marquis\nde La Tour d'Azyr.\n\n\"My dear friend,\" he was saying, \"forgive me if I startled you. Forgive\nme if I thrust myself in here without leave, at such a time, in such a\nmanner. But... you see how it is with me. I am a fugitive. In the course\nof my distracted flight, not knowing which way to turn for safety, I\nthought of you. I told myself that if I could but safely reach your\nhouse, I might find sanctuary.\"\n\n\"You are in danger?\"\n\n\"In danger?\" Almost he seemed silently to laugh at the unnecessary\nquestion. \"If I were to show myself openly in the streets just now, I\nmight with luck contrive to live for five minutes! My friend, it has\nbeen a massacre. Some few of us escaped from the Tuileries at the end,\nto be hunted to death in the streets. I doubt if by this time a single\nSwiss survives. They had the worst of it, poor devils. And as for us--my\nGod! They hate us more than they hate the Swiss. Hence this filthy\ndisguise.\"\n\nHe peeled off the shaggy greatcoat, and casting it from him stepped\nforth in the black satin that had been the general livery of the hundred\nknights of the dagger who had rallied in the Tuileries that morning to\nthe defence of their king.\n\nHis coat was rent across the back, his neckcloth and the ruffles at his\nwrists were torn and bloodstained; with his smeared face and disordered\nheaddress he was terrible to behold. Yet he contrived to carry himself\nwith his habitual easy assurance, remembered to kiss the trembling hand\nwhich Mme. de Plougastel extended to him in welcome.\n\n\"You did well to come to me, Gervais,\" she said. \"Yes, here is sanctuary\nfor the present. You will be quite safe, at least for as long as we are\nsafe. My servants are entirely trustworthy. Sit down and tell me all.\"\n\nHe obeyed her, collapsing almost into the armchair which she\nthrust forward, a man exhausted, whether by physical exertion or by\nnerve-strain, or both. He drew a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped\nsome of the blood and dirt from his face.\n\n\"It is soon told.\" His tone was bitter with the bitterness of despair.\n\"This, my dear, is the end of us. Plougastel is lucky in being across\nthe frontier at such a time. Had I not been fool enough to trust those\nwho to-day have proved themselves utterly unworthy of trust, that is\nwhere I should be myself. My remaining in Paris is the crowning folly\nof a life full of follies and mistakes. That I should come to you in\nmy hour of most urgent need adds point to it.\" He laughed in his\nbitterness.\n\nMadame moistened her dry lips. \"And... and now?\" she asked him.\n\n\"It only remains to get away as soon as may be, if it is still possible.\nHere in France there is no longer any room for us--at least, not above\nground. To-day has proved it.\" And then he looked up at her, standing\nthere beside him so pale and timid, and he smiled. He patted the fine\nhand that rested upon the arm of his chair. \"My dear Therese, unless you\ncarry charitableness to the length of giving me to drink, you will\nsee me perish of thirst under your eyes before ever the canaille has a\nchance to finish me.\"\n\nShe started. \"I should have thought of it!\" she cried in self-reproach,\nand she turned quickly. \"Aline,\" she begged, \"tell Jacques to bring...\"\n\n\"Aline!\" he echoed, interrupting, and swinging round in his turn. Then,\nas Aline rose into view, detaching from her background, and he at last\nperceived her, he heaved himself abruptly to his weary legs again, and\nstood there stiffly bowing to her across the space of gleaming floor.\n\"Mademoiselle, I had not suspected your presence,\" he said, and he\nseemed extraordinarily ill-at-ease, a man startled, as if caught in an\nillicit act.\n\n\"I perceived it, monsieur,\" she answered, as she advanced to do madame's\ncommission. She paused before him. \"From my heart, monsieur, I grieve\nthat we should meet again in circumstances so very painful.\"\n\nNot since the day of his duel with Andre-Louis--the day which had seen\nthe death and burial of his last hope of winning her--had they stood face\nto face.\n\nHe checked as if on the point of answering her. His glance strayed to\nMme. de Plougastel, and, oddly reticent for one who could be very glib,\nhe bowed in silence.\n\n\"But sit, monsieur, I beg. You are fatigued.\"\n\n\"You are gracious to observe it. With your permission, then.\" And he\nresumed his seat. She continued on her way to the door and passed out\nupon her errand.\n\nWhen presently she returned they had almost unaccountably changed\nplaces. It was Mme. de Plougastel who was seated in that armchair of\nbrocade and gilt, and M. de La Tour d'Azyr who, despite his lassitude,\nwas leaning over the back of it talking earnestly, seeming by his\nattitude to plead with her. On Aline's entrance he broke off instantly\nand moved away, so that she was left with a sense of having intruded.\nFurther she observed that the Countess was in tears.\n\nFollowing her came presently the diligent Jacques, bearing a tray laden\nwith food and wine. Madame poured for her guest, and he drank a long\ndraught of the Burgundy, then begged, holding forth his grimy hands,\nthat he might mend his appearance before sitting down to eat.\n\nHe was led away and valeted by Jacques, and when he returned he had\nremoved from his person the last vestige of the rough handling he had\nreceived. He looked almost his normal self, the disorder in his attire\nrepaired, calm and dignified and courtly in his bearing, but very pale\nand haggard of face, seeming suddenly to have increased in years, to\nhave reached in appearance the age that was in fact his own.\n\nAs he ate and drank--and this with appetite, for as he told them he had\nnot tasted food since early morning--he entered into the details of the\ndreadful events of the day, and gave them the particulars of his own\nescape from the Tuileries when all was seen to be lost and when the\nSwiss, having burnt their last cartridge, were submitting to wholesale\nmassacre at the hands of the indescribably furious mob.\n\n\"Oh, it was all most ill done,\" he ended critically. \"We were timid when\nwe should have been resolute, and resolute at last when it was too late.\nThat is the history of our side from the beginning of this accursed\nstruggle. We have lacked proper leadership throughout, and now--as I have\nsaid already--there is an end to us. It but remains to escape, as soon as\nwe can discover how the thing is to be accomplished.\"\n\nMadame told him of the hopes that she had centred upon Rougane.\n\nIt lifted him out of his gloom. He was disposed to be optimistic.\n\n\"You are wrong to have abandoned that hope,\" he assured her. \"If this\nmayor is so well disposed, he certainly can do as his son promised. But\nlast night it would have been too late for him to have reached you, and\nto-day, assuming that he had come to Paris, almost impossible for him\nto win across the streets from the other side. It is most likely that he\nwill yet come. I pray that he may; for the knowledge that you and Mlle.\nde Kercadiou are out of this would comfort me above all.\"\n\n\"We should take you with us,\" said madame.\n\n\"Ah! But how?\"\n\n\"Young Rougane was to bring me permits for three persons--Aline, myself,\nand my footman, Jacques. You would take the place of Jacques.\"\n\n\"Faith, to get out of Paris, madame, there is no man whose place I would\nnot take.\" And he laughed.\n\nTheir spirits rose with his and their flagging hopes revived. But as\ndusk descended again upon the city, without any sign of the deliverer\nthey awaited, those hopes began to ebb once more.\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr at last pleaded weariness, and begged to be\npermitted to withdraw that he might endeavour to take some rest against\nwhatever might have to be faced in the immediate future. When he had\ngone, madame persuaded Aline to go and lie down.\n\n\"I will call you, my dear, the moment he arrives,\" she said, bravely\nmaintaining that pretence of a confidence that had by now entirely\nevaporated.\n\nAline kissed her affectionately, and departed, outwardly so calm and\nunperturbed as to leave the Countess wondering whether she realized the\nperil by which they were surrounded, a peril infinitely increased by the\npresence in that house of a man so widely known and detested as M. de La\nTour d'Azyr, a man who was probably being sought for by his enemies at\nthis moment.\n\nLeft alone, madame lay down on a couch in the salon itself, to be\nready for any emergency. It was a hot summer night, and the glass doors\nopening upon the luxuriant garden stood wide to admit the air. On that\nair came intermittently from the distance sounds of the continuing\nhorrible activities of the populace, the aftermath of that bloody day.\n\nMme. de Plougastel lay there, listening to those sounds for upwards of\nan hour, thanking Heaven that for the present at least the disturbances\nwere distant, dreading lest at any moment they should occur nearer at\nhand, lest this Bondy section in which her hotel was situated should\nbecome the scene of horrors similar to those whose echoes reached her\nears from other sections away to the south and west.\n\nThe couch occupied by the Countess lay in shadow; for all the lights in\nthat long salon had been extinguished with the exception of a cluster\nof candles in a massive silver candle branch placed on a round marquetry\ntable in the middle of the room--an island of light in the surrounding\ngloom.\n\nThe timepiece on the overmantel chimed melodiously the hour of ten,\nand then, startling in the suddenness with which it broke the immediate\nsilence, another sound vibrated through the house, and brought madame\nto her feet, in a breathless mingling of hope and dread. Some one\nwas knocking sharply on the door below. Followed moments of agonized\nsuspense, culminating in the abrupt invasion of the room by the footman\nJacques. He looked round, not seeing his mistress at first.\n\n\"Madame! Madame!\" he panted, out of breath.\n\n\"What is it, Jacques!\" Her voice was steady now that the need for\nself-control seemed thrust upon her. She advanced from the shadows\ninto that island of light about the table. \"There is a man below. He is\nasking... he is demanding to see you at once.\"\n\n\"A man?\" she questioned.\n\n\"He... he seems to be an official; at least he wears the sash of office.\nAnd he refuses to give any name; he says that his name would convey\nnothing to you. He insists that he must see you in person and at once.\"\n\n\"An official?\" said madame.\n\n\"An official,\" Jacques repeated. \"I would not have admitted him, but\nthat he demanded it in the name of the Nation. Madame, it is for you to\nsay what shall be done. Robert is with me. If you wish it... whatever it\nmay be...\"\n\n\"My good Jacques, no, no.\" She was perfectly composed. \"If this man\nintended evil, surely he would not come alone. Conduct him to me, and\nthen beg Mlle. de Kercadiou to join me if she is awake.\"\n\nJacques departed, himself partly reassured. Madame seated herself in the\narmchair by the table well within the light. She smoothed her dress with\na mechanical hand. If, as it would seem, her hopes had been futile, so\nhad her momentary fears. A man on any but an errand of peace would have\nbrought some following with him, as she had said.\n\nThe door opened again, and Jacques reappeared; after him, stepping\nbriskly past him, came a slight man in a wide-brimmed hat, adorned by a\ntricolour cockade. About the waist of an olive-green riding-coat he wore\na broad tricolour sash; a sword hung at his side.\n\nHe swept off his hat, and the candlelight glinted on the steel buckle in\nfront of it. Madame found herself silently regarded by a pair of large,\ndark eyes set in a lean, brown face, eyes that were most singularly\nintent and searching.\n\nShe leaned forward, incredulity swept across her countenance. Then her\neyes kindled, and the colour came creeping back into her pale cheeks.\nShe rose suddenly. She was trembling.\n\n\"Andre-Louis!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. THE BARRIER\n\nThat gift of laughter of his seemed utterly extinguished. For once there\nwas no gleam of humour in those dark eyes, as they continued to consider\nher with that queer stare of scrutiny. And yet, though his gaze was\nsombre, his thoughts were not. With his cruelly true mental vision which\npierced through shams, and his capacity for detached observation--which\nproperly applied might have carried him very far, indeed--he perceived\nthe grotesqueness, the artificiality of the emotion which in that moment\nhe experienced, but by which he refused to be possessed. It sprang\nentirely from the consciousness that she was his mother; as if, all\nthings considered, the more or less accidental fact that she had brought\nhim into the world could establish between them any real bond at this\ntime of day! The motherhood that bears and forsakes is less than animal.\nHe had considered this; he had been given ample leisure in which to\nconsider it during those long, turbulent hours in which he had been\nforced to wait, because it would have been almost impossible to have won\nacross that seething city, and certainly unwise to have attempted so to\ndo.\n\nHe had reached the conclusion that by consenting to go to her rescue\nat such a time he stood committed to a piece of purely sentimental\nquixotry. The quittances which the Mayor of Meudon had exacted from him\nbefore he would issue the necessary safe-conducts placed the whole of\nhis future, perhaps his very life, in jeopardy. And he had consented to\ndo this not for the sake of a reality, but out of regard for an idea--he\nwho all his life had avoided the false lure of worthless and hollow\nsentimentality.\n\nThus thought Andre-Louis as he considered her now so searchingly,\nfinding it, naturally enough, a matter of extraordinary interest to\nlook consciously upon his mother for the first time at the age of\neight-and-twenty.\n\nFrom her he looked at last at Jacques, who remained at attention,\nwaiting by the open door.\n\n\"Could we be alone, madame?\" he asked her.\n\nShe waved the footman away, and the door closed. In agitated silence,\nunquestioning, she waited for him to account for his presence there at\nso extraordinary a time.\n\n\"Rougane could not return,\" he informed her shortly. \"At M. de\nKercadiou's request, I come instead.\"\n\n\"You! You are sent to rescue us!\" The note of amazement in her voice was\nstronger than that of her relief.\n\n\"That, and to make your acquaintance, madame.\"\n\n\"To make my acquaintance? But what do you mean, Andre-Louis?\"\n\n\"This letter from M. de Kercadiou will tell you.\" Intrigued by his odd\nwords and odder manner, she took the folded sheet. She broke the seal\nwith shaking hands, and with shaking hands approached the written page\nto the light. Her eyes grew troubled as she read; the shaking of her\nhands increased, and midway through that reading a moan escaped her.\nOne glance that was almost terror she darted at the slim, straight man\nstanding so incredibly impassive upon the edge of the light, and\nthen she endeavoured to read on. But the crabbed characters of M. de\nKercadiou swam distortedly under her eyes. She could not read. Besides,\nwhat could it matter what else he said. She had read enough. The sheet\nfluttered from her hands to the table, and out of a face that was like a\nface of wax, she looked now with a wistfulness, a sadness indescribable,\nat Andre-Louis.\n\n\"And so you know, my child?\" Her voice was stifled to a whisper.\n\n\"I know, madame my mother.\"\n\nThe grimness, the subtle blend of merciless derision and reproach in\nwhich it was uttered completely escaped her. She cried out at the new\nname. For her in that moment time and the world stood still. Her peril\nthere in Paris as the wife of an intriguer at Coblenz was blotted out,\ntogether with every other consideration--thrust out of a consciousness\nthat could find room for nothing else beside the fact that she stood\nacknowledged by her only son, this child begotten in adultery, borne\nfurtively and in shame in a remote Brittany village eight-and-twenty\nyears ago. Not even a thought for the betrayal of that inviolable\nsecret, or the consequences that might follow, could she spare in this\nsupreme moment.\n\nShe took one or two faltering steps towards him, hesitating. Then she\nopened her arms. Sobs suffocated her voice.\n\n\"Won't you come to me, Andre-Louis?\"\n\nA moment yet he stood hesitating, startled by that appeal, angered\nalmost by his heart's response to it, reason and sentiment at grips\nin his soul. This was not real, his reason postulated; this poignant\nemotion that she displayed and that he experienced was fantastic. Yet he\nwent. Her arms enfolded him; her wet cheek was pressed hard against his\nown; her frame, which the years had not yet succeeded in robbing of its\ngrace, was shaken by the passionate storm within her.\n\n\"Oh, Andre-Louis, my child, if you knew how I have hungered to hold you\nso! If you knew how in denying myself this I have atoned and suffered!\nKercadiou should not have told you--not even now. It was wrong--most\nwrong, perhaps, to you. It would have been better that he should have\nleft me here to my fate, whatever that may be. And yet--come what may of\nthis--to be able to hold you so, to be able to acknowledge you, to hear\nyou call me mother--oh! Andre-Louis, I cannot now regret it. I cannot...\nI cannot wish it otherwise.\"\n\n\"Is there any need, madame?\" he asked her, his stoicism deeply shaken.\n\"There is no occasion to take others into our confidence. This is for\nto-night alone. To-night we are mother and son. To-morrow we resume our\nformer places, and, outwardly at least, forget.\"\n\n\"Forget? Have you no heart, Andre-Louis?\"\n\nThe question recalled him curiously to his attitude towards life--that\nhistrionic attitude of his that he accounted true philosophy. Also he\nremembered what lay before them; and he realized that he must master not\nonly himself but her; that to yield too far to sentiment at such a time\nmight be the ruin of them all.\n\n\"It is a question propounded to me so often that it must contain the\ntruth,\" said he. \"My rearing is to blame for that.\"\n\nShe tightened her clutch about his neck even as he would have attempted\nto disengage himself from her embrace.\n\n\"You do not blame me for your rearing? Knowing all, as you do,\nAndre-Louis, you cannot altogether blame. You must be merciful to me.\nYou must forgive me. You must! I had no choice.\"\n\n\"When we know all of whatever it may be, we can never do anything but\nforgive, madame. That is the profoundest religious truth that was ever\nwritten. It contains, in fact, a whole religion--the noblest religion\nany man could have to guide him. I say this for your comfort, madame my\nmother.\"\n\nShe sprang away from him with a startled cry. Beyond him in the shadows\nby the door a pale figure shimmered ghostly. It advanced into the light,\nand resolved itself into Aline. She had come in answer to that forgotten\nsummons madame had sent her by Jacques. Entering unperceived she had\nseen Andre-Louis in the embrace of the woman whom he addressed as\n\"mother.\" She had recognized him instantly by his voice, and she could\nnot have said what bewildered her more: his presence there or the thing\nshe overheard.\n\n\"You heard, Aline?\" madame exclaimed.\n\n\"I could not help it, madame. You sent for me. I am sorry if...\" She\nbroke off, and looked at Andre-Louis long and curiously. She was pale,\nbut quite composed. She held out her hand to him. \"And so you have come\nat last, Andre,\" said she. \"You might have come before.\"\n\n\"I come when I am wanted,\" was his answer. \"Which is the only time in\nwhich one can be sure of being received.\" He said it without bitterness,\nand having said it stooped to kiss her hand.\n\n\"You can forgive me what is past, I hope, since I failed of my purpose,\"\nhe said gently, half-pleading. \"I could not have come to you pretending\nthat the failure was intentional--a compromise between the necessities of\nthe case and your own wishes. For it was not that. And yet, you do not\nseem to have profited by my failure. You are still a maid.\"\n\nShe turned her shoulder to him.\n\n\"There are things,\" she said, \"that you will never understand.\"\n\n\"Life, for one,\" he acknowledged. \"I confess that I am finding it\nbewildering. The very explanations calculated to simplify it seem but to\ncomplicate it further.\" And he looked at Mme. de Plougastel.\n\n\"You mean something, I suppose,\" said mademoiselle.\n\n\"Aline!\" It was the Countess who spoke. She knew the danger of\nhalf-discoveries. \"I can trust you, child, I know, and Andre-Louis, I am\nsure, will offer no objection.\" She had taken up the letter to show it\nto Aline. Yet first her eyes questioned him.\n\n\"Oh, none, madame,\" he assured her. \"It is entirely a matter for\nyourself.\"\n\nAline looked from one to the other with troubled eyes, hesitating to\ntake the letter that was now proffered. When she had read it through,\nshe very thoughtfully replaced it on the table. A moment she stood there\nwith bowed head, the other two watching her. Then impulsively she ran to\nmadame and put her arms about her.\n\n\"Aline!\" It was a cry of wonder, almost of joy. \"You do not utterly\nabhor me!\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Aline, and kissed the tear-stained face that seemed to\nhave grown years older in these last few hours.\n\nIn the background Andre-Louis, steeling himself against emotionalism,\nspoke with the voice of Scaramouche.\n\n\"It would be well, mesdames, to postpone all transports until they can\nbe indulged at greater leisure and in more security. It is growing late.\nIf we are to get out of this shambles we should be wise to take the road\nwithout more delay.\"\n\nIt was a tonic as effective as it was necessary. It startled them into\nremembrance of their circumstances, and under the spur of it they went\nat once to make their preparations.\n\nThey left him for perhaps a quarter of an hour, to pace that long room\nalone, saved only from impatience by the turmoil of his mind. When\nat length they returned, they were accompanied by a tall man in a\nfull-skirted shaggy greatcoat and a broad hat the brim of which was\nturned down all around. He remained respectfully by the door in the\nshadows.\n\nBetween them the two women had concerted it thus, or rather the Countess\nhad so concerted it when Aline had warned her that Andre-Louis' bitter\nhostility towards the Marquis made it unthinkable that he should move a\nfinger consciously to save him.\n\nNow despite the close friendship uniting M. de Kercadiou and his niece\nwith Mme. de Plougastel, there were several matters concerning them of\nwhich the Countess was in ignorance. One of these was the project at one\ntime existing of a marriage between Aline and M. de La Tour d'Azyr.\nIt was a matter that Aline--naturally enough in the state of her\nfeelings--had never mentioned, nor had M. de Kercadiou ever alluded to it\nsince his coming to Meudon, by when he had perceived how unlikely it was\never to be realized.\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr's concern for Aline on that morning of the duel\nwhen he had found her half-swooning in Mme. de Plougastel's carriage had\nbeen of a circumspection that betrayed nothing of his real interest in\nher, and therefore had appeared no more than natural in one who must\naccount himself the cause of her distress. Similarly Mme. de Plougastel\nhad never realized nor did she realize now--for Aline did not trouble\nfully to enlighten her--that the hostility between the two men was other\nthan political, the quarrel other than that which already had taken\nAndre-Louis to the Bois on every day of the preceding week. But, at\nleast, she realized that even if Andre-Louis' rancour should have no\nother source, yet that inconclusive duel was cause enough for Aline's\nfears.\n\nAnd so she had proposed this obvious deception; and Aline had consented\nto be a passive party to it. They had made the mistake of not fully\nforewarning and persuading M. de La Tour d'Azyr. They had trusted\nentirely to his anxiety to escape from Paris to keep him rigidly within\nthe part imposed upon him. They had reckoned without the queer sense\nof honour that moved such men as M. le Marquis, nurtured upon a code of\nshams.\n\nAndre-Louis, turning to scan that muffled figure, advanced from the\ndark depths of the salon. As the light beat on his white, lean face the\npseudo-footman started. The next moment he too stepped forward into\nthe light, and swept his broad-brimmed hat from his brow. As he did so\nAndre-Louis observed that his hand was fine and white and that a\njewel flashed from one of the fingers. Then he caught his breath, and\nstiffened in every line as he recognized the face revealed to him.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" that stern, proud man was saying, \"I cannot take advantage\nof your ignorance. If these ladies can persuade you to save me, at least\nit is due to you that you shall know whom you are saving.\"\n\nHe stood there by the table very erect and dignified, ready to perish as\nhe had lived--if perish he must--without fear and without deception.\n\nAndre-Louis came slowly forward until he reached the table on the other\nside, and then at last the muscles of his set face relaxed, and he\nlaughed.\n\n\"You laugh?\" said M. de La Tour d'Azyr, frowning, offended.\n\n\"It is so damnably amusing,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\"You've an odd sense of humour, M. Moreau.\"\n\n\"Oh, admitted. The unexpected always moves me so. I have found you many\nthings in the course of our acquaintance. To-night you are the one thing\nI never expected to find you: an honest man.\"\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr quivered. But he attempted no reply.\n\n\"Because of that, monsieur, I am disposed to be clement. It is probably\na foolishness. But you have surprised me into it. I give you three\nminutes, monsieur, in which to leave this house, and to take your own\nmeasures for your safety. What afterwards happens to you shall be no\nconcern of mine.\"\n\n\"Ah, no, Andre! Listen...\" Madame began in anguish.\n\n\"Pardon, madame. It is the utmost that I will do, and already I am\nviolating what I conceive to be my duty. If M. de La Tour d'Azyr remains\nhe not only ruins himself, but he imperils you. For unless he departs\nat once, he goes with me to the headquarters of the section, and the\nsection will have his head on a pike inside the hour. He is a notorious\ncounter-revolutionary, a knight of the dagger, one of those whom an\nexasperated populace is determined to exterminate. Now, monsieur, you\nknow what awaits you. Resolve yourself and at once, for these ladies'\nsake.\"\n\n\"But you don't know, Andre-Louis!\" Mme. de Plougastel's condition was\none of anguish indescribable. She came to him and clutched his arm. \"For\nthe love of Heaven, Andre-Louis, be merciful with him! You must!\"\n\n\"But that is what I am being, madame--merciful; more merciful than he\ndeserves. And he knows it. Fate has meddled most oddly in our concerns\nto bring us together to-night. Almost it is as if Fate were forcing\nretribution at last upon him. Yet, for your sakes, I take no advantage\nof it, provided that he does at once as I have desired him.\"\n\nAnd now from beyond the table the Marquis spoke icily, and as he spoke\nhis right hand stirred under the ample folds of his greatcoat.\n\n\"I am glad, M. Moreau, that you take that tone with me. You relieve me\nof the last scruple. You spoke of Fate just now, and I must agree with\nyou that Fate has meddled oddly, though perhaps not to the end that you\ndiscern. For years now you have chosen to stand in my path and thwart me\nat every turn, holding over me a perpetual menace. Persistently you have\nsought my life in various ways, first indirectly and at last directly.\nYour intervention in my affairs has ruined my highest hopes--more\neffectively, perhaps, than you suppose. Throughout you have been my evil\ngenius. And you are even one of the agents of this climax of despair\nthat has been reached by me to-night.\"\n\n\"Wait! Listen!\" Madame was panting. She flung away from Andre-Louis,\nas if moved by some premonition of what was coming. \"Gervais! This is\nhorrible!\"\n\n\"Horrible, perhaps, but inevitable. Himself he has invited it. I am a\nman in despair, the fugitive of a lost cause. That man holds the keys\nof escape. And, besides, between him and me there is a reckoning to be\npaid.\"\n\nHis hand came from beneath the coat at last, and it came armed with a\npistol.\n\nMme. de Plougastel screamed, and flung herself upon him. On her knees\nnow, she clung to his arm with all her strength and might.\n\nVainly he sought to shake himself free of that desperate clutch.\n\n\"Therese!\" he cried. \"Are you mad? Will you destroy me and yourself?\nThis creature has the safe-conducts that mean our salvation. Himself, he\nis nothing.\"\n\nFrom the background Aline, a breathless, horror-stricken spectator\nof that scene, spoke sharply, her quick mind pointing out the line of\ncheckmate.\n\n\"Burn the safe-conducts, Andre-Louis. Burn them at once--in the candles\nthere.\"\n\nBut Andre-Louis had taken advantage of that moment of M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr's impotence to draw a pistol in his turn. \"I think it will be\nbetter to burn his brains instead,\" he said. \"Stand away from him,\nmadame.\"\n\nFar from obeying that imperious command, Mme. de Plougastel rose to her\nfeet to cover the Marquis with her body. But she still clung to his arm,\nclung to it with unsuspected strength that continued to prevent him from\nattempting to use the pistol.\n\n\"Andre! For God's sake, Andre!\" she panted hoarsely over her shoulder.\n\n\"Stand away, madame,\" he commanded her again, more sternly, \"and let\nthis murderer take his due. He is jeopardizing all our lives, and his\nown has been forfeit these years. Stand away!\" He sprang forward with\nintent now to fire at his enemy over her shoulder, and Aline moved too\nlate to hinder him.\n\n\"Andre! Andre!\"\n\nPanting, gasping, haggard of face, on the verge almost of hysteria,\nthe distracted Countess flung at last an effective, a terrible barrier\nbetween the hatred of those men, each intent upon taking the other's\nlife.\n\n\"He is your father, Andre! Gervais, he is your son--our son! The letter\nthere... on the table... O my God!\" And she slipped nervelessly to the\nground, and crouched there sobbing at the feet of M. de La Tour d'Azyr.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. SAFE-CONDUCT\n\nAcross the body of that convulsively sobbing woman, the mother of one\nand the mistress of the other, the eyes of those mortal enemies met,\ninvested with a startled, appalled interest that admitted of no words.\n\nBeyond the table, as if turned to stone by this culminating horror of\nrevelation, stood Aline.\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr was the first to stir. Into his bewildered mind\ncame the memory of something that Mme. de Plougastel had said of\na letter that was on the table. He came forward, unhindered. The\nannouncement made, Mme. de Plougastel no longer feared the sequel, and\nso she let him go. He walked unsteadily past this new-found son of his,\nand took up the sheet that lay beside the candlebranch. A long moment\nhe stood reading it, none heeding him. Aline's eyes were all on\nAndre-Louis, full of wonder and commiseration, whilst Andre-Louis was\nstaring down, in stupefied fascination, at his mother.\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr read the letter slowly through. Then very quietly\nhe replaced it. His next concern, being the product of an artificial age\nsternly schooled in the suppression of emotion, was to compose himself.\nThen he stepped back to Mme. de Plougastel's side and stooped to raise\nher.\n\n\"Therese,\" he said.\n\nObeying, by instinct, the implied command, she made an effort to rise\nand to control herself in her turn. The Marquis half conducted, half\ncarried her to the armchair by the table.\n\nAndre-Louis looked on. Still numbed and bewildered, he made no attempt\nto assist. He saw as in a dream the Marquis bending over Mme. de\nPlougastel. As in a dream he heard him ask:\n\n\"How long have you known this, Therese?\"\n\n\"I... I have always known it... always. I confided him to Kercadiou. I\nsaw him once as a child... Oh, but what of that?\"\n\n\"Why was I never told? Why did you deceive me? Why did you tell me that\nthis child had died a few days after birth? Why, Therese? Why?\"\n\n\"I was afraid. I... I thought it better so--that nobody, nobody, not even\nyou, should know. And nobody has known save Quintin until last night,\nwhen to induce him to come here and save me he was forced to tell him.\"\n\n\"But I, Therese?\" the Marquis insisted. \"It was my right to know.\"\n\n\"Your right? What could you have done? Acknowledge him? And then? Ha!\"\nIt was a queer, desperate note of laughter. \"There was Plougastel; there\nwas my family. And there was you... you, yourself, who had ceased to\ncare, in whom the fear of discovery had stifled love. Why should I have\ntold you, then? Why? I should not have told you now had there been\nany other way to... to save you both. Once before I suffered just such\ndreadful apprehensions when you and he fought in the Bois. I was on my\nway to prevent it when you met me. I would have divulged the truth, as\na last resource, to avert that horror. But mercifully God spared me the\nnecessity then.\"\n\nIt had not occurred to any of them to doubt her statement, incredible\nthough it might seem. Had any done so her present words must have\nresolved all doubt, explaining as they did much that to each of her\nlisteners had been obscure until this moment.\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr, overcome, reeled away to a chair and sat down\nheavily. Losing command of himself for a moment, he took his haggard\nface in his hands.\n\nThrough the windows open to the garden came from the distance the faint\nthrobbing of a drum to remind them of what was happening around them.\nBut the sound went unheeded. To each it must have seemed that here\nthey were face to face with a horror greater than any that might be\ntormenting Paris. At last Andre-Louis began to speak, his voice level\nand unutterably cold.\n\n\"M. de La Tour d'Azyr,\" he said, \"I trust that you'll agree that this\ndisclosure, which can hardly be more distasteful and horrible to you\nthan it is to me, alters nothing, since it effaces nothing of all\nthat lies between us. Or, if it alters anything, it is merely to add\nsomething to that score. And yet... Oh, but what can it avail to talk!\nHere, monsieur, take this safe-conduct which is made out for Mme. de\nPlougastel's footman, and with it make your escape as best you can. In\nreturn I will beg of you the favour never to allow me to see you or hear\nof you again.\"\n\n\"Andre!\" His mother swung upon him with that cry. And yet again that\nquestion. \"Have you no heart? What has he ever done to you that you\nshould nurse so bitter a hatred of him?\"\n\n\"You shall hear, madame. Once, two years ago in this very room I told\nyou of a man who had brutally killed my dearest friend and debauched the\ngirl I was to have married. M. de La Tour d'Azyr is that man.\"\n\nA moan was her only answer. She covered her face with her hands.\n\nThe Marquis rose slowly to his feet again. He came slowly forward, his\nsmouldering eyes scanning his son's face.\n\n\"You are hard,\" he said grimly. \"But I recognize the hardness. It\nderives from the blood you bear.\"\n\n\"Spare me that,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\nThe Marquis inclined his head. \"I will not mention it again. But I\ndesire that you should at least understand me, and you too, Therese. You\naccuse me, sir, of murdering your dearest friend. I will admit that the\nmeans employed were perhaps unworthy. But what other means were at my\ncommand to meet an urgency that every day since then proves to have\nexisted? M. de Vilmorin was a revolutionary, a man of new ideas that\nshould overthrow society and rebuild it more akin to the desires of such\nas himself. I belonged to the order that quite as justifiably desired\nsociety to remain as it was. Not only was it better so for me and mine,\nbut I also contend, and you have yet to prove me wrong, that it is\nbetter so for all the world; that, indeed, no other conceivable society\nis possible. Every human society must of necessity be composed of\nseveral strata. You may disturb it temporarily into an amorphous whole\nby a revolution such as this; but only temporarily. Soon out of the\nchaos which is all that you and your kind can ever produce, order must\nbe restored or life will perish; and with the restoration of order comes\nthe restoration of the various strata necessary to organized society.\nThose that were yesterday at the top may in the new order of things find\nthemselves dispossessed without any benefit to the whole. That change\nI resisted. The spirit of it I fought with whatever weapons were\navailable, whenever and wherever I encountered it. M. de Vilmorin was\nan incendiary of the worst type, a man of eloquence full of false ideals\nthat misled poor ignorant men into believing that the change proposed\ncould make the world a better place for them. You are an intelligent\nman, and I defy you to answer me from your heart and conscience that\nsuch a thing was true or possible. You know that it is untrue; you know\nthat it is a pernicious doctrine; and what made it worse on the lips\nof M. de Vilmorin was that he was sincere and eloquent. His voice was\na danger that must be removed--silenced. So much was necessary in\nself-defence. In self-defence I did it. I had no grudge against M. de\nVilmorin. He was a man of my own class; a gentleman of pleasant ways,\namiable, estimable, and able.\n\n\"You conceive me slaying him for the very lust of slaying, like some\nbeast of the jungle flinging itself upon its natural prey. That has\nbeen your error from the first. I did what I did with the very heaviest\nheart--oh, spare me your sneer!--I do not lie, I have never lied. And I\nswear to you here and now, by my every hope of Heaven, that what I say\nis true. I loathed the thing I did. Yet for my own sake and the sake of\nmy order I must do it. Ask yourself whether M. de Vilmorin would have\nhesitated for a moment if by procuring my death he could have brought\nthe Utopia of his dreams a moment nearer realization.\n\n\"After that. You determined that the sweetest vengeance would be to\nfrustrate my ends by reviving in yourself the voice that I had silenced,\nby yourself carrying forward the fantastic apostleship of equality that\nwas M. de Vilmorin's. You lacked the vision that would have shown you\nthat God did not create men equals. Well, you are in case to-night to\njudge which of us was right, which wrong. You see what is happening here\nin Paris. You see the foul spectre of Anarchy stalking through a land\nfallen into confusion. Probably you have enough imagination to conceive\nsomething of what must follow. And do you deceive yourself that out of\nthis filth and ruin there will rise up an ideal form of society? Don't\nyou understand that society must re-order itself presently out of all\nthis?\n\n\"But why say more? I must have said enough to make you understand the\nonly thing that really matters--that I killed M. de Vilmorin as a matter\nof duty to my order. And the truth--which though it may offend you should\nalso convince you--is that to-night I can look back on the deed with\nequanimity, without a single regret, apart from what lies between you\nand me.\n\n\"When, kneeling beside the body of your friend that day at Gavrillac,\nyou insulted and provoked me, had I been the tiger you conceived me\nI must have killed you too. I am, as you may know, a man of quick\npassions. Yet I curbed the natural anger you aroused in me, because\nI could forgive an affront to myself where I could not overlook a\ncalculated attack upon my order.\"\n\nHe paused a moment. Andre-Louis stood rigid listening and wondering.\nSo, too, the others. Then M. le Marquis resumed, on a note of less\nassurance. \"In the matter of Mlle. Binet I was unfortunate. I wronged\nyou through inadvertence. I had no knowledge of the relations between\nyou.\"\n\nAndre-Louis interrupted him sharply at last with a question: \"Would it\nhave made a difference if you had?\"\n\n\"No,\" he was answered frankly. \"I have the faults of my kind. I cannot\npretend that any such scruple as you suggest would have weighed with me.\nBut can you--if you are capable of any detached judgment--blame me very\nmuch for that?\"\n\n\"All things considered, monsieur, I am rapidly being forced to the\nconclusion that it is impossible to blame any man for anything in this\nworld; that we are all of us the sport of destiny. Consider, monsieur,\nthis gathering--this family gathering--here to-night, whilst out there...\nO my God, let us make an end! Let us go our ways and write 'finis' to\nthis horrible chapter of our lives.\"\n\nM. le La Tour considered him gravely, sadly, in silence for a moment.\n\n\"Perhaps it is best,\" he said, at length, in a small voice. He turned to\nMme. de Plougastel. \"If a wrong I have to admit in my life, a wrong\nthat I must bitterly regret, it is the wrong that I have done to you, my\ndear...\"\n\n\"Not now, Gervais! Not now!\" she faltered, interrupting him.\n\n\"Now--for the first and the last time. I am going. It is not likely that\nwe shall ever meet again--that I shall ever see any of you again--you who\nshould have been the nearest and dearest to me. We are all, he says, the\nsport of destiny. Ah, but not quite. Destiny is an intelligent force,\nmoving with purpose. In life we pay for the evil that in life we do.\nThat is the lesson that I have learnt to-night. By an act of betrayal\nI begot unknown to me a son who, whilst as ignorant as myself of our\nrelationship, has come to be the evil genius of my life, to cross\nand thwart me, and finally to help to pull me down in ruin. It is\njust--poetically just. My full and resigned acceptance of that fact is\nthe only atonement I can offer you.\"\n\nHe stooped and took one of madame's hands that lay limply in her lap.\n\n\"Good-bye, Therese!\" His voice broke. He had reached the end of his iron\nself-control.\n\nShe rose and clung to him a moment, unashamed before them. The ashes of\nthat dead romance had been deeply stirred this night, and deep down some\nlingering embers had been found that glowed brightly now before their\nfinal extinction. Yet she made no attempt to detain him. She understood\nthat their son had pointed out the only wise, the only possible course,\nand was thankful that M. de La Tour d'Azyr accepted it.\n\n\"God keep you, Gervais,\" she murmured. \"You will take the safe-conduct,\nand... and you will let me know when you are safe?\"\n\nHe held her face between his hands an instant; then very gently kissed\nher and put her from him. Standing erect, and outwardly calm again, he\nlooked across at Andre-Louis who was proffering him a sheet of paper.\n\n\"It is the safe-conduct. Take it, monsieur. It is my first and last gift\nto you, and certainly the last gift I should ever have thought of making\nyou--the gift of life. In a sense it makes us quits. The irony, sir, is\nnot mine, but Fate's. Take it, monsieur, and go in peace.\"\n\nM. de La Tour d'Azyr took it. His eyes looked hungrily into the lean\nface confronting him, so sternly set. He thrust the paper into his\nbosom, and then abruptly, convulsively, held out his hand. His son's\neyes asked a question.\n\n\"Let there be peace between us, in God's name,\" said the Marquis\nthickly.\n\nPity stirred at last in Andre-Louis. Some of the sternness left his\nface. He sighed. \"Good-bye, monsieur,\" he said.\n\n\"You are hard,\" his father told him, speaking wistfully. \"But perhaps\nyou are in the right so to be. In other circumstances I should have been\nproud to have owned you as my son. As it is...\" He broke off abruptly,\nand as abruptly added, \"Good-bye.\"\n\nHe loosed his son's hand and stepped back. They bowed formally to each\nother. And then M. de La Tour d'Azyr bowed to Mlle. de Kercadiou in\nutter silence, a bow that contained something of utter renunciation, of\nfinality.\n\nThat done he turned and walked stiffly out of the room, and so out of\nall their lives. Months later they were to hear of him in the service of\nthe Emperor of Austria.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. SUNRISE\n\nAndre-Louis took the air next morning on the terrace at Meudon. The hour\nwas very early, and the newly risen sun was transmuting into diamonds\nthe dewdrops that still lingered on the lawn. Down in the valley, five\nmiles away, the morning mists were rising over Paris. Yet early as it\nwas that house on the hill was astir already, in a bustle of preparation\nfor the departure that was imminent.\n\nAndre-Louis had won safely out of Paris last night with his mother and\nAline, and to-day they were to set out all of them for Coblenz.\n\nTo Andre-Louis, sauntering there with hands clasped behind him and head\nhunched between his shoulders--for life had never been richer in material\nfor reflection--came presently Aline through one of the glass doors from\nthe library.\n\n\"You're early astir,\" she greeted him.\n\n\"Faith, yes. I haven't been to bed. No,\" he assured her, in answer to\nher exclamation. \"I spent the night, or what was left of it, sitting at\nthe window thinking.\"\n\n\"My poor Andre!\"\n\n\"You describe me perfectly. I am very poor--for I know nothing,\nunderstand nothing. It is not a calamitous condition until it is\nrealized. Then...\" He threw out his arms, and let them fall again. His\nface she observed was very drawn and haggard.\n\nShe paced with him along the old granite balustrade over which the\ngeraniums flung their mantle of green and scarlet.\n\n\"Have you decided what you are going to do?\" she asked him.\n\n\"I have decided that I have no choice. I, too, must emigrate. I am lucky\nto be able to do so, lucky to have found no one amid yesterday's chaos\nin Paris to whom I could report myself as I foolishly desired, else\nI might no longer be armed with these.\" He drew from his pocket the\npowerful passport of the Commission of Twelve, enjoining upon all\nFrenchmen to lend him such assistance as he might require, and warning\nthose who might think of hindering him that they did so at their own\nperil. He spread it before her. \"With this I conduct you all safely to\nthe frontier. Over the frontier M. de Kercadiou and Mme. de Plougastel\nwill have to conduct me; and then we shall be quits.\"\n\n\"Quits?\" quoth she. \"But you will be unable to return!\"\n\n\"You conceive, of course, my eagerness to do so. My child, in a day or\ntwo there will be enquiries. It will be asked what has become of me.\nThings will transpire. Then the hunt will start. But by then we shall be\nwell upon our way, well ahead of any possible pursuit. You don't imagine\nthat I could ever give the government any satisfactory explanation of my\nabsence--assuming that any government remains to which to explain it?\"\n\n\"You mean... that you will sacrifice your future, this career upon which\nyou have embarked?\" It took her breath away.\n\n\"In the pass to which things have come there is no career for me down\nthere--at least no honest one. And I hope you do not think that I could\nbe dishonest. It is the day of the Dantons, and the Marats, the day of\nthe rabble. The reins of government will be tossed to the populace, or\nelse the populace, drunk with the conceit with which the Dantons and the\nMarats have filled it, will seize the reins by force. Chaos must follow,\nand a despotism of brutes and apes, a government of the whole by its\nlowest parts. It cannot endure, because unless a nation is ruled by its\nbest elements it must wither and decay.\"\n\n\"I thought you were a republican,\" said she.\n\n\"Why, so I am. I am talking like one. I desire a society which selects\nits rulers from the best elements of every class and denies the right of\nany class or corporation to usurp the government to itself--whether it\nbe the nobles, the clergy, the bourgeoisie, or the proletariat. For\ngovernment by any one class is fatal to the welfare of the whole. Two\nyears ago our ideal seemed to have been realized. The monopoly of power\nhad been taken from the class that had held it too long and too unjustly\nby the hollow right of heredity. It had been distributed as evenly as\nmight be throughout the State, and if men had only paused there, all\nwould have been well. But our impetus carried us too far, the privileged\norders goaded us on by their very opposition, and the result is the\nhorror of which yesterday you saw no more than the beginnings. No,\nno,\" he ended. \"Careers there may be for venal place-seekers, for\nopportunists; but none for a man who desires to respect himself. It is\ntime to go. I make no sacrifice in going.\"\n\n\"But where will you go? What will you do?\"\n\n\"Oh, something. Consider that in four years I have been lawyer,\npolitician, swordsman, and buffoon--especially the latter. There is\nalways a place in the world for Scaramouche. Besides, do you know that\nunlike Scaramouche I have been oddly provident? I am the owner of a\nlittle farm in Saxony. I think that agriculture might suit me. It is a\nmeditative occupation; and when all is said, I am not a man of action. I\nhaven't the qualities for the part.\"\n\nShe looked up into his face, and there was a wistful smile in her deep\nblue eyes.\n\n\"Is there any part for which you have not the qualities, I wonder?\"\n\n\"Do you really? Yet you cannot say that I have made a success of any\nof those which I have played. I have always ended by running away. I\nam running away now from a thriving fencing-academy, which is likely to\nbecome the property of Le Duc. That comes of having gone into politics,\nfrom which I am also running away. It is the one thing in which I really\nexcel. That, too, is an attribute of Scaramouche.\"\n\n\"Why will you always be deriding yourself?\" she wondered.\n\n\"Because I recognize myself for part of this mad world, I suppose. You\nwouldn't have me take it seriously? I should lose my reason utterly if I\ndid; especially since discovering my parents.\"\n\n\"Don't, Andre!\" she begged him. \"You are insincere, you know.\"\n\n\"Of course I am. Do you expect sincerity in man when hypocrisy is the\nvery keynote of human nature? We are nurtured on it; we are schooled in\nit, we live by it; and we rarely realize it. You have seen it rampant\nand out of hand in France during the past four years--cant and hypocrisy\non the lips of the revolutionaries, cant and hypocrisy on the lips of\nthe upholders of the old regime; a riot of hypocrisy out of which in\nthe end is begotten chaos. And I who criticize it all on this beautiful\nGod-given morning am the rankest and most contemptible hypocrite of all.\nIt was this--the realization of this truth kept me awake all night. For\ntwo years I have persecuted by every means in my power... M. de La Tour\nd'Azyr.\"\n\nHe paused before uttering the name, paused as if hesitating how to speak\nof him.\n\n\"And in those two years I have deceived myself as to the motive that was\nspurring me. He spoke of me last night as the evil genius of his life,\nand himself he recognized the justice of this. It may be that he was\nright, and because of that it is probable that even had he not killed\nPhilippe de Vilmorin, things would still have been the same. Indeed,\nto-day I know that they must have been. That is why I call myself a\nhypocrite, a poor, self-duping hypocrite.\"\n\n\"But why, Andre?\"\n\nHe stood still and looked at her. \"Because he sought you, Aline.\nBecause in that alone he must have found me ranged against him, utterly\nintransigeant. Because of that I must have strained every nerve to bring\nhim down--so as to save you from becoming the prey of your own ambition.\n\n\"I wish to speak of him no more than I must. After this, I trust never\nto speak of him again. Before the lines of our lives crossed, I knew him\nfor what he was, I knew the report of him that ran the countryside.\nEven then I found him detestable. You heard him allude last night to the\nunfortunate La Binet. You heard him plead, in extenuation of his fault,\nhis mode of life, his rearing. To that there is no answer, I suppose. He\nconforms to type. Enough! But to me, he was the embodiment of evil, just\nas you have always been the embodiment of good; he was the embodiment\nof sin, just as you are the embodiment of purity. I had enthroned you so\nhigh, Aline, so high, and yet no higher than your place. Could I, then,\nsuffer that you should be dragged down by ambition, could I suffer the\nevil I detested to mate with the good I loved? What could have come of\nit but your own damnation, as I told you that day at Gavrillac? Because\nof that my detestation of him became a personal, active thing. I\nresolved to save you at all costs from a fate so horrible. Had you\nbeen able to tell me that you loved him it would have been different.\nI should have hoped that in a union sanctified by love you would have\nraised him to your own pure heights. But that out of considerations of\nworldly advancement you should lovelessly consent to mate with him...\nOh, it was vile and hopeless. And so I fought him--a rat fighting a\nlion--fought him relentlessly until I saw that love had come to take in\nyour heart the place of ambition. Then I desisted.\"\n\n\"Until you saw that love had taken the place of ambition!\" Tears\nhad been gathering in her eyes whilst he was speaking. Now amazement\neliminated her emotion. \"But when did you see that? When?\"\n\n\"I--I was mistaken. I know it now. Yet, at the time... surely, Aline,\nthat morning when you came to beg me not to keep my engagement with him\nin the Bois, you were moved by concern for him?\"\n\n\"For him! It was concern for you,\" she cried, without thinking what she\nsaid.\n\nBut it did not convince him. \"For me? When you knew--when all the world\nknew what I had been doing daily for a week!\"\n\n\"Ah, but he, he was different from the others you had met. His\nreputation stood high. My uncle accounted him invincible; he persuaded\nme that if you met nothing could save you.\"\n\nHe looked at her frowning.\n\n\"Why this, Aline?\" he asked her with some sternness. \"I can understand\nthat, having changed since then, you should now wish to disown those\nsentiments. It is a woman's way, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Oh, what are you saying, Andre? How wrong you are! It is the truth I\nhave told you!\"\n\n\"And was it concern for me,\" he asked her, \"that laid you swooning when\nyou saw him return wounded from the meeting? That was what opened my\neyes.\"\n\n\"Wounded? I had not seen his wound. I saw him sitting alive and\napparently unhurt in his caleche, and I concluded that he had killed you\nas he had said he would. What else could I conclude?\"\n\nHe saw light, dazzling, blinding, and it scared him. He fell back,\na hand to his brow. \"And that was why you fainted?\" he asked\nincredulously.\n\nShe looked at him without answering. As she began to realize how much\nshe had been swept into saying by her eagerness to make him realize his\nerror, a sudden fear came creeping into her eyes.\n\nHe held out both hands to her.\n\n\"Aline! Aline!\" His voice broke on the name. \"It was I...\"\n\n\"O blind Andre, it was always you--always! Never, never did I think\nof him, not even for loveless marriage, save once for a little while,\nwhen... when that theatre girl came into your life, and then...\" She\nbroke off, shrugged, and turned her head away. \"I thought of following\nambition, since there was nothing left to follow.\"\n\nHe shook himself. \"I am dreaming, of course, or else I am mad,\" he said.\n\n\"Blind, Andre; just blind,\" she assured him.\n\n\"Blind only where it would have been presumption to have seen.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" she answered him with a flash of the Aline he had known of\nold, \"I have never found you lack presumption.\"\n\nM. de Kercadiou, emerging a moment later from the library window, beheld\nthem holding hands and staring each at the other, beatifically, as if\neach saw Paradise in the other's face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Scaramouche, by Rafael Sabatini\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SCARAMOUCHE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1947-8.txt or 1947-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/4/1947/\n\nProduced by An Anonymous Project Gutenberg Volunteer, and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
