Rosemary McClean knew it; the old woman, of the sweeper\ncaste, that is no caste at all,--the hag with the flat breasts and\nwrinkled skin, who followed her dogwise, and was no more protection\nthan a toothless dog,--knew it well, and growled about it in incessant\nundertones that met with neither comment nor response.\n\n\"Leave a pearl of price to glisten on the street, yes!\" she grumbled.\n\"Perhaps none might notice it--perhaps! But her--here--at this time--\"\nShe would continue in a rumbling growl of half-prophetic catalogues of\nevil--some that she had seen to happen, some that she imagined, and not\nany part of which was in the least improbable.\n\nAs the girl passed through the stenching, many-hued bazaar, the\nroar would cease for a second and then rise again. Turbaned and\npugreed--Mohammedan and Hindoo--men of all grades of color, language,\nand belief, but with only one theory on women, would stare first at the\npony that she rode, then at her, and then at the ancient grandmother who\ntrotted in her wake. Low jests would greet the grandmother, and then the\ntrading and the gambling would resume, together with the under-thread of\nrestlessness that was so evidently there and yet so hard to lay a finger\non.\n\nThe sun beat down pitilessly--brass--like the din of cymbals. Beneath\nthe sun helmet that sat so squarely and straightforwardly on the tidy\nchestnut curls, her face was pale. She smiled as she guided her pony\nin and out amid the roaring throng, and carefully refused to see the\nscowls, her brave little shoulders seconded a pair of quiet, brave gray\neyes in showing an unconquerable courage to the world, and her clean,\nneat cotton riding-habit gave the lie and the laugh in one to poverty;\nbut, as the crowd had its atmosphere of secret murmuring, she had\nanother of secret anxiety.\n\nNeither had fear. She did not believe in it. She was there to help her\nfather fight inhuman wrong, and die, if need be, in the last ditch. T\n a two-hundred-million crowd, held down and compelled by less than a\nhundred thousand aliens. And, least of all, had the man who followed\nher at a little distance the slightest sense of fear. He was far more\nconversant with it than she, but--unlike her, and far more than the\nseething crowd--he knew the trend of events, and just what likelihood\nthere was of insult or injury to Rosemary McClean being avenged in a\ngeneration.\n\nHe caused more comment than she, and of a different kind. His rose-pink\npugree, with the egret and the diamond brooch to hold the egret in its\nplace--his jeweled sabre--his swaggering, almost ruffianly air--were\nno more meant to escape attention than his charger that clattered and\nkicked among the crowd, or his following, who cleared a way for him with\nthe butt ends of their lances. He rode ahead, but every other minute a\nmounted sepoy would reach out past him and drive his lance-end into the\nribs of some one in the way.\n\nThere would follow much deep salaaming; more than one head would bow\nvery low indeed; and in many languages, by the names of many gods, he\nwould be cursed in undertones. Aloud, they would bless him and call him\n\"Heaven-born!\"\n\nBut he took no interest whatever in the crowd. His dark-brown eyes were\nfixed incessantly on Rosemary McClean's back. Whenever she turned a\ncorner in the crowded maze of streets, he would spur on in a hurry until\nshe was in sight again, and then his handsome, swarthy face would light\nwith pleasure--wicked pleasure--self-assertive, certain, cruel. He would\nrein in again to let her draw once more ahead.\n\nRosemary McClean knew quite well who was following her, and knew, too,\nthat she could do nothing to prevent him. Once, as she passed a species\nof caravansary--low-roofed, divided into many lockable partitions, and\npacked tight with babbling humanity--she caught sight of a pair of long,\nblack thigh boots, silver-spurred, and of a polished scabbard that moved\nspasmodically, as though its owner were impatient.\n\n\"Mahommed Gunga!\" she muttered to herself. \"I wonder whether he\nwould come to my assistance if I needed him. He fought once--or so he\nsays--for the British; he might be loyal still. I wonder what he is\ndoing here, and what--Oh, I wonder!\"\n\nShe was very careful not to seem to look sideways, or seek acquaintance\nwith the wearer of the boots; had she done so, she would have gained\nnothing, for the moment that he caught sight of her through the opened\ndoor he drew back into a shadow, and swore lustily. What he said to\nhimself would have been little comfort to her.\n\n\"By the breath of God!\" he growled. \"These preachers of new creeds are\nthe last straw, if one were wanting! They choose the one soft place\nwhere Mohammedan and Hindoo think alike, and smite! If I wanted to raise\nhell from end to end of Hind, I too would preach a new creed, and turn\ngood-looking women loose to wander on the country-side!--Ah!\" He drew\nback even further, as he spied the egret and the sabre and the stallion\ncavorting down the street--then thought better of it and strode\nswaggering to the doorway, and stood, crimson-coated, in the sunlight,\nstroking upward insolently at his black, fierce-barbered beard. There\nwas a row of medal ribbons on his left breast that bore out something at\nleast of his contention; he had been loyal to the British once, whether\nhe was so now or not.\n\nThe man on the charger eyed him sideways and passed on. Mahommed Gunga\nwaited. One of the prince's followers rode close to him--leaned low from\nthe saddle--and leered into his face.\n\n\"Knowest not enough to salute thy betters?\" he demanded.\n\nMahommed Gunga made a movement with his right hand in the direction of\nhis left hip--one that needed no explanation; the other legged his\nhorse away, and rode on, grinning nastily. To reassure himself of his\nsuperiority over everybody but his master, he spun his horse presently\nso that its rump struck against a tented stall, and upset tent and\ngoods. Then he spent two full minutes in outrageous execration of the\nmen who struggled underneath the gaudy cloth, before cantering away,\nlooking, feeling, riding like a fearless man again. Mahommed Gunga\nsneered after him, and spat, and turned his back on the sunshine and the\nstreet.\n\n\"I had a mind to teach that Hindoo who his betters are!\" he growled.\n\n\"Come in, risaldar-sahib!\" said a voice persuasively. \"By your own\nshowing the hour is not yet--why spill blood before the hour?\"\n\nThe Rajput swaggered to the dark door, spurs jingling, looking back\nacross his shoulder once or twice, as though he half-regretted leaving\nthe Hindoo horseman's head upon his shoulders.\n\n\"Come in, sahib,\" advised the voice again. \"They be many. We are few.\nAnd, who knows--our roads may lie together yet.\"\n\nMahommed Gunga kicked his scabbard clear, and strode through the door.\nThe shadows inside and the hum of voices swallowed him as though he were\na big, red, black-legged devil reassimilated in the brewing broth of\ntrouble; but his voice boomed deep and loud after he had disappeared\nfrom view.\n\n\"When their road and my road lie together, we will travel all feet\nforemost!\" he asserted.\n\nTen turnings further away by that time, Rosemary McClean pressed on\nthrough the hot, dinning swarm of humanity, missing no opportunity to\nslip her pony through an opening, but trying, too, to seem unaware that\nshe was followed. She chose narrow, winding ways, where the awnings\nalmost met above the middle of the street, and where a cavalcade of\nhorsemen would not be likely to follow her--only to hear a roar behind\nher, as the prince's escort started slashing at the awnings with their\nswords.\n\nThere was a rush and a din of shouting beside her and ahead, as the\nfrightened merchants scurried to pull down their awnings before\nthe ruthless horse-men could ride down on them; the narrow street\ntransformed itself almost on the instant into a undraped, cleared defile\nbetween two walls. And after that she kept to the broader streets, where\nthere was room in the middle for a troop to follow, four abreast, should\nit choose. She had no mind to seek her own safety at the expense of men\nwhose souls her father was laboring so hard to save.\n\nShe got no credit, though, for consideration--only blame for what the\nswordsmen had already done. One man--a Maharati trader--half-naked,\nhis black hair coiled into a shaggy rope and twisted up above his\nneck--followed her, side-tracking through the mazy byways of the\nbewildering mart, and coming out ahead of her--or lurking beside bales\nof merchandise and waiting his opportunity to leap from shadow into\nshadow unobserved.\n\nHe followed her until she reached the open, where a double row of trees\non each side marked the edge of a big square, large enough for the\ndrilling of an army. Along one side of the square there ran the\nhigh brick wall, topped with a kind of battlement, that guarded the\nMaharajah's palace grounds from the eyes of men.\n\nJust as she turned, just as she was starting to canter her pony beside\nthe long wall, he leaped out at her and seized her reins. The old woman\nscreamed, and ran to the wall and cowered there.\n\nVery likely the man only meant to frighten her and heap insults on her,\nfor in '56, though wrath ran deep and strong, men waited. There was to\nbe sudden, swift whelming when the time came, not intermittent outrage.\nBut he had no time to do more than rein her pony back onto its haunches.\n\nThere came a clatter of scurrying hoofs behind, and from a whirl of\ndust, topped by a rose-pink pugree, a steel blade swooped down on her\nand him. A surge of brown and pink and cream, and a dozen rainbow tints\nflashed past her; a long boot brushed her saddle on the off side. There\nwas a sickening sound, as something hard swished and whicked home;\nher pony reeled from the shock of a horse's shoulder, and--none too\ngently--none too modestly--the prince with the egret and the handsome\nface reined in on his horse's haunches and saluted her.\n\nThere was blood, becoming dull-brown in the dust between them. He shook\nhis sabre, and the blood dripped from it then he held it outstretched,\nand a horseman wiped it, before he returned it with a clang.\n\n\"The sahiba's servant!\" he said magnificently, making no motion to let\nher pass, but twisting with his sword-hand at his waxed mustache and\nsmiling darkly.\n\nShe looked down between them at the thing that but a minute since had\nlived, and loved perhaps as well as hated.\n\n\"Shame on you, Jaimihr-sahib!\" she said, shuddering. A year ago she\nwould have fallen from her pony in a swoon, but one year of Howrah and\nits daily horrors had so hardened her that she could look and loathe\nwithout the saving grace of losing consciousness.\n\n\"The shame would have been easier to realize, had I taken more than\none stroke!\" he answered irritably, still blocking the way on his great\nhorse, still twisting at his mustache point, still looking down at her\nthrough eyes that blazed a dozen accumulated centuries' store of lawless\nambition. He was proud of that back-handed swipe of his that would\ncleave a man each time at one blow from shoulder-joint to ribs, severing\nthe backbone. A woman of his own race would have been singing songs in\npraise of him and his skill in swordsman-ship already; but no woman of\nhis own race would have looked him in the eye like that and dared him,\nnor have done what she did next. She leaned over and swished his charger\nwith her little whip, and slipped past him.\n\nHe swore, deep and fiercely, as he spurred and wheeled, and cantered\nafter her. His great stallion could overhaul her pony in a minute, going\nstride for stride; the wall was more than two miles long with no break\nin it other than locked gates; there was no hurry. He watched her\nthrough half-closed, glowering, appraising eyes as he cantered in her\nwake, admiring the frail, slight figure in the gray cotton habit, and\nbridling his desire to make her--seize her reins, and halt, and make\nher--admit him master of the situation.\n\nAs he reached her stirrup, she reined in and faced him, after a hurried\nglance that told her her duenna had failed her. The old woman was\ninvisible.\n\n\"Will you leave that body to lie there in the dust and sun?\" she asked\nindignantly.\n\n\"I am no vulture, or jackal, or hyena, sahiba!\" he smiled. \"I do not eat\ncarrion!\" He seemed to think that that was a very good retort, for he\nshowed his wonderful white teeth until his handsome face was the epitome\nof self-satisfied amusement. His horse blocked the way again, and all\nretreat was cut off, for his escort were behind her, and three of them\nhad ridden to the right, outside the row of trees, to cut off possible\nescape in that direction. \"Was it not well that I was near, sahiba?\nWould it have been better to die at the hands of a Maharati of no\ncaste--?\"\n\n\"Than to see blood spilt--than to be beholden to a murderer? Infinitely\nbetter! There was no need to kill that man--I could have quieted him.\nLet me pass, please, Jaimihr-sahib!\"\n\nHe reined aside; but if she thought that cold scorn or hot anger would\neither of them quell his ardor, she had things reversed. The less she\nbehaved as a native woman would have done--the more she flouted him--the\nmore enthusiastic he became.\n\n\"Sahiba!\"--he trotted beside her, his great horse keeping up easily with\nher pony's canter--\"I have told you oftener than once that I make a good\nfriend and a bad enemy!\"\n\n\"And I have answered oftener than once that I do not need your\nfriendship, and am not afraid of you! You forget that the British\nGovernment will hold your royal brother liable for my safety and my\nfather's!\"\n\n\"You, too, overlook certain things, sahiba.\" He spoke evenly, with a\nlittle space between each word. With the dark look that accompanied it,\nwith the blood barely dry yet on the dusty road behind, his speech\nwas not calculated to reassure a slip of a girl, gray-eyed or not,\nstiff-chinned or not, borne up or not by Scots enthusiasm for a cause.\n\"This is a native state. My brother rules. The British--\"\n\n\"Are near enough, and strong enough, to strike and to bring you and your\nbrother to your knees if you harm a British woman!\" she retorted. \"You\nforget--when the British Government gives leave to missionaries to go\ninto a native state, it backs them up with a strong arm!\"\n\n\"You build too much on the British and my brother, sahiba!\nListen--Howrah is as strong as I am, and no stronger. Had he been\nstronger, he would have slain me long ago. The British are--\" He checked\nhimself and trotted beside her in silence for a minute. She affected\ncomplete indifference; it was as though she had not heard him; if she\ncould not be rid of him, she at least knew how to show him his utter\nunimportance in her estimation.\n\n\"Have you heard, sahiba, of the Howrah treasure? Of the rubies? Of the\npearls? Of the emeralds? Of the bars of gold? It is foolishness, of\ncourse; we who are modern-minded see the crime of hoarding all that\nwealth, and adding to it, for twenty generations. Have you heard of it,\nsahiba?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" she answered savagely, swishing at his charger again to make him\nkeep his distance. \"You have told me of it twice. You have told me that\nyou know where it is, and you have offered to show it to me. You have\ntold me that you and your brother Maharajah Howrah and the priests\nof Siva are the only men who know where it is, and you lust for that\ntreasure! I can see you lust! You think that I lust too, and you make a\ngreat mistake Jaimihr-sahib! You see, I remember what you have told me.\nNow, go away and remember what I tell you. I care for you and for your\ntreasure exactly that!\" She hit his charger with all her might, and\nat the sting of the little whip he shied clear of the road before the\nRajah's brother could rein him in.\n\nAgain her effort to destroy his admiration for her had directly the\nopposite effect. He swore, and he swore vengeance; but he swore, too,\nthat there was no woman in the East so worth a prince's while as this\none, who dared flout him with her riding-whip before his men!\n\n\"Sahiba!\" he said, sidling close to her again, and bowing in the saddle\nin mock cavalier humility. \"The time will come when your government\nand my brother, who--at present--is Maharajah Howrah--will be of little\nservice to you. Then, perhaps, you may care to recall my promise to load\nall the jewels you can choose out of the treasure-house on you. Then,\nperhaps, you may, remember that I said 'a throne is better than a grave,\nsahiba.' Or else--\"\n\n\"Or else what, Jaimihr-sahib?\" She reined again and wheeled about and\nfaced him--pale-trembling a little--looking very small and frail beside\nhim on his great war-horse, but not flinching under his gaze for a\nsingle second.\n\n\"Or else, sahiba--I think you saw me slay the Maharati? Do you think\nthat I would stop at anything to accomplish what I had set out to do?\nSee, sahiba--there is a little blood there on your jacket! Let that be\nfor a pledge between us--for a sign--or a token of my oath that on the\nday I am Maharajah Howrah, you are Maharanee--mistress of all the jewels\nin the treasure-house!\"\n\nShe shuddered. She did not look to find the blood; she took his word for\nthat, if for nothing else.\n\n\"I wonder you dare tell me that you plot against your brother!\" That was\nmore a spoken thought than a statement or a question.\n\n\"I would be very glad if you would warn my brother!\" he answered her;\nand she knew like a flash, and on the instant, that what he said was\ntrue. She had been warned before she came to bear no tales to any one.\nNo Oriental would believe the tale, coming from her; the Maharajah would\narrest her promptly, glad of the excuse to vent his hatred of Christian\nmissionaries. Jaimihr would attempt a rescue; it was common knowledge\nthat he plotted for the throne. There would be instant civil war,\nin which the British Government would perforce back up the alleged\nprotector of a defenseless woman. There would be a new Maharajah; then,\nin a little while, and in all likelihood, she would have disappeared\nforever while the war raged. There would be, no doubt, a circumstantial\nstory of her death from natural causes.\n\nShe did not answer. She stared back at him, and he smiled down at her,\ntwisting at his mustache.\n\n\"Think!\" he said, nodding. \"A throne, sahiba, is considerably better\nthan a grave!\" Then he wheeled like a sudden dust-devil and decamped\nin a cloud of dust, followed at full pelt by his clattering escort. She\nwatched their horses leap one after the other the corpse of the Maharati\nthat lay by the corner where it fell, and she saw the last of them go\nclattering, whirling up the street through the bazaar. The old hag rose\nout of a shadow and trotted after her again as she turned and rode on,\npale-faced and crying now a little, to the little begged school place\nwhere her father tried to din the alphabet into a dozen low-caste\nfosterlings.\n\n\"Father!\" she cried, and she all but fell out of the saddle into his\narms as the tall, lean Scotsman came to the door to meet her and stood\nblinking in the sunlight. \"Father, I've seen another man killed! I've\nhad another scene with Jaimihr! I can't endure it! I--I--Oh, why did I\never come?\"\n\n\"I don't know, dear,\" he answered. \"But you would come, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\n    'Twixt loot and law--'tween creed and caste--\n    Through slough this people wallows,\n    To where we choose our road at last.\n    I choose the RIGHT! Who follows?\n\nHEMMED in amid the stifling stench and babel of the caravansary,\nsecluded by the very denseness of the many-minded swarm, five other\nRajputs and Mahommed Gunga--all six, according to their turbans,\nfollowers of Islam--discussed matters that appeared to bring them little\nsatisfaction.\n\nThey sat together in a dark, low-ceilinged room; its open door--it was\nfar too hot to close anything that admitted air--gave straight onto the\nstreet, and the one big window opened on a courtyard, where a pair of\ngame-cocks fought in and out between the restless legs of horses, while\na yelling horde betted on them. On a heap of grass fodder in a corner\nof the yard an all-but-naked expert in inharmony thumped a skin tom-tom\nwith his knuckles, while at his feet the own-blood brother to the\nscreech-owls wailed of hell's torments on a wind instrument.\n\nDin--glamour--stink--incessant movement--interblended poverty and riches\nrubbing shoulders--noisy self-interest side by side with introspective\nrevery, where stray priests nodded in among the traders,--many-peopled\nIndia surged in miniature between the four hot walls and through the\npassage to the overflowing street; changeable and unexplainable, in\never-moving flux, but more conservative in spite of it than the very\nrocks she rests on--India who is sister to Aholibah and mother of all\nfascination.\n\nIn that room with the long window, low-growled, the one thin thread of\nclear-sighted unselfishness was reeling out to very slight approval.\nMahommed Gunga paced the floor and kicked his toes against the walls,\nas he turned at either end, until his spurs jingled, and looked with\nblazing dark-brown eyes from one man to the other.\n\n\"What good ever came of listening to priests?\" he asked. \"All priests\nare alike--ours, and theirs, and padre-sahibs! They all preach peace and\ngoad the lust that breeds war and massacre! Does a priest serve any but\nhimself? Since when? There will come this rising that the priests speak\nof--yes! Of a truth, there will, for the priests will see to it! There\nis a padre-sahib here in Howrah now for the Hindoo priests to whet their\nhate on. You saw the woman ride past here a half-hour gone? There is a\npile of tinder ready here, and any fool of a priest can make a spark!\nThere will be a rising, and a big one!\"\n\n\"There will! Of a truth, there will!\" Alwa, his cousin, crossed one leg\nabove the other with a clink of spurs and scabbard. He had no objection\nto betraying interest, but declined for the present to betray his hand.\n\n\"There will be a blood-letting that will do no harm to us Rajputs!\"\nsaid another man, whose eyes gleamed from the darkest corner; he,\ntoo, clanked his scabbard as though the sound were an obbligato to his\nthoughts. \"Sit still and say nothing is my advice; we will be all ready\nto help ourselves when the hour comes!\"\n\n\"It is this way,\" said Mahommed Gunga, standing straddle-legged to face\nall five of them, with his back to the window. He stroked his\nblack beard upward with one hand and fingered with the other at his\nsabre-hilt. \"Without aid when the hour does come, the English will\nbe smashed--worn down--starved out--surrounded--stamped\nout--annihilated--so!\" He stamped with his heel descriptively on the\nhard earth floor. \"And then, what?\"\n\n\"Then, the plunder!\" said Alwa, showing a double row of wonderful white\nteeth. The other four grinned like his reflections. \"Ay, there will be\nplunder--for the priests! And we Rajputs will have new masters over us!\nNow, as things are, we have honorable men. They are fools, for any\nman is a fool who will not see and understand the signs. But they are\nhonest. They ride straight! They look us straight between the eyes, and\nspeak truth, and fear nobody! Will the Hindoo priests, who will rule\nIndia afterward, be thus? Nay! Here is one sword for the British when\nthe hour comes!\"\n\n\"I have yet to see a Hindoo priest rule me or plunder me!\" said Alwa\nwith a grin.\n\n\"You will live to see it!\" said Mahommed Gunga. \"Truly, you will live to\nsee it, unless you throw your weight into the other scale! What are we\nRajputs without a leader whom we all trust? What have we ever been?\"\nHe swung on his heels suddenly--angrily--and began to pace the floor\nagain--then stopped.\n\n\"Divided, and again subdivided--one-fifth Mohammedan and four-fifths\nHindoo--clan within clan, and each against the other. Do we own\nRajputana? Nay! Do we rule it? Nay! What were we until Cunnigan-bahadur\ncame?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" All five men rose with a clank in honor to the memory of that man.\n\"Cunnigan-bahadur! Show us such another man as he was, and I and mine\nride at his back!\" said Alwa. \"Not all the English are like Cunnigan!\nA Cunnigan could have five thousand men the minute that he asked for\nthem!\"\n\n\"Am I a wizard?--Can I cast spells and bring dead men's spirits from\nthe dead again? I know of no man to take his place,\" said Mahommed Gunga\nsadly.\n\nHe was the poorest of them, but they were all, comparatively speaking,\npoor men; for the long peace had told its tale on a race of men who are\nfirst gentlemen, then soldiers, and last--least of all--and only as a\nlast resource, landed proprietors. The British, for whom they had often\nfought because that way honor seemed to lie, had impoverished\nthem afterward by passing and enforcing zemindary laws that lifted\nnine-tenths of the burden from the necks of starving tenants. The new\nlaw was just, as the Rajputs grudgingly admitted, but it pinched their\npockets sadly; like the old-time English squires, they would give their\nbest blood and their last rack-rent-wrung rupee for the cause that\nthey believed in, but they resented interference with the rack-rents!\nMahommed Gunga had had influence enough with these five landlord\nrelations of his to persuade them to come and meet him in Howrah City to\ndiscuss matters; the mere fact that he had thought it worth his while\nto leave his own little holding in the north had satisfied them that he\nwould be well worth listening to--for no man rode six hundred miles on\nan empty errand. But they needed something more than words before they\npledged the word that no Rajput gentleman will ever break.\n\n\"Find us a Cunnigan--bring him to us--prove him to us--and if a blade\nworth having from end to end of Rajputana is not at his service, I\nmyself will gut the Hindoo owner of it! That is my given word!\" said\nAlwa.\n\n\"He had a son,\" said Mahommed Gunga quietly.\n\n\"True. Are all sons like their fathers? Take Maharajah Howrah here; his\nfather was a man with whom any soldier might be proud to pick a quarrel.\nThe present man is afraid of his own shadow on the wall--divided between\nlove for the treasure-chests he dare not broach and fear of a brother\nwhom he dare not kill. He is priest-ridden, priest-taught, and fit to be\nnothing but a priest. Who knows how young Cunnigan will shape? Where is\nhe? Overseas yet! He must prove himself, as his father did, before he\ncan hope to lead a free regiment of horse!\"\n\n\"Then Cunnigan-bahadur's watch-word 'For the peace of India,' is\ndead-died with him?\" asked Mahommed Gunga. \"We are each for our own\nagain?\"\n\n\"I have spoken!\" answered Alwa. As the biggest clan-chief left on all\nthat countryside, he had a right to speak before the others, and he\nknew that what he said would carry weight when they had all ridden home\nagain, and the report had gone abroad in ever-widening rings. \"If the\nEnglish can hold India, let them! I will not fight against them, for\nthey are honest men for all their madness. If they cannot, then I am for\nRajputana, not India--India may burn or rot or burst to pieces, so long\nas Rajputana stands! But--\" He paused a moment, and looked at each man\nin turn, and tapped his sabre-hilt, \"--if a Cunnigan-bahadur were among\nus--a man whom I could trust to lead me and mine and every man--I would\nlend him my sword for the sheer honor of helping him hack truth out of\ncorruption! I have nothing more to say!\"\n\n\"One word more, cousin!\" said Mahommed Gunga. \"I was risaldar in\nCunnigan-bahadur's regiment of horse. There was more than mere\ndiscipline between us. I ate his salt. Once--when he might have saved\nhimself the trouble without any daring to reproach him--he risked his\nown life, and a troop, and his reputation to save a woman of my family\nfrom capture, and something worse. There was never a Rajput or any other\nnative woman wronged while he was with us.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I am no friend of Christian priests--of padres. But--\"\n\n\"She who rode by just now? What, then?\"\n\n\"I ride northward now, and then very likely South again. I can do\nnothing in the matter, yet--were he in my shoes, and she a native woman\nat the mercy of the troops--Cunnigan-bahadur would have assigned a guard\nfor her.\"\n\n\"Ho! So I am thy sepoy?\" sneered Alwa, standing sideways--looking\nsideways--and throwing out his chest. \"I am to do thy bidding, guarding\nstray padres\" (he spoke the word as though it were a bad taste he was\nspitting from his mouth), \"and herding women without purdah, while thou\nridest on assignations Allah knows where? Since when?\"\n\n\"I have yet to refuse to guard thy back, or thy good name, Alwa!\"\nMahommed Gunga eyed him straight, and thrust his hilt out. \"The woman is\nnothing to me--the padre-sahib less. It is because of the debt I owe to\nCunnigan that I ask this favor.\"\n\n\"Oh. It is granted! Should she appeal to me, I will rip Howrah into\nrags and burn this city to protect her if need be! She must first ask,\nthough, even as thou didst.\"\n\nMahommed Gunga saluted him, bolt-upright as a lance, and without the\nslightest change in his expression.\n\n\"The word is sufficient, cousin!\"\n\nAlwa returned his salute, and raised his voice in a gruff command. A\nsaice outside the window woke as though struck by a stick--sprang to his\nfeet--and passed the order on. A dozen horses clattered in the courtyard\nand filed through the arched passage to the street, and Alwa mounted.\nThe others, each with his escort, followed suit, and a moment later,\nwith no further notice of one another, but with as much pomp and noise\nas though they owned the whole of India, the five rode off, each on his\nseparate way, through the scattering crowd.\n\nThen Mahommed Gunga called for his own horse and the lone armed man of\nhis own race who acted squire to him.\n\n\"Did any overhear our talk?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, sahib.\"\n\n\"Not the saice, even?\"\n\n\"No, sahib. He slept.\"\n\n\"He awoke most suddenly, and at not much noise.\"\n\n\"For that reason I know he slept, sahib. Had he been pretending, he\nwould have wakened slowly.\"\n\n\"Thou art no idiot!\" said Mahommed Gunga. \"Wait here until I return, and\nlie a few lies if any ask thee why we six came together, and of what we\nspoke!\"\n\nThen he mounted and rode off slowly, picking his way through the throng\nmuch more cautiously and considerately than his relatives had done,\nthough not, apparently, because he loved the crowd. He used some\nsingularly biting insults to help clear the way, and frowned as though\nevery other man he looked at were either an assassin or--what a good\nMohammedan considers worse--an infidel. He reached the long brick wall\nat last--broke into a canter--scattered the pariah dogs that were nosing\nand quarreling about the corpse of the Maharati, and drew rein fifteen\nminutes later by the door of the tiny school place that Miss McClean had\nentered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nFor service truly rendered, and for duty dumbly done--For men who\nneither tremble nor forget--There is due reward, my henchman. There is\nhonor to be won. There is watch and ward and sterner duty yet.\n\nNo sound came, from within the schoolhouse. The little building, coaxed\nfrom a grudging Maharajah, seemed to strain for light and air between\ntwo overlapping, high-walled brick warehouses. Before the door, in a\nspot where the scorching sun-rays came but fitfully between a mesh of\nfast-decaying thatch, the old hag who had followed Rosemary McClean lay\nsnoozing, muttering to herself, and blinking every now and then as a\nstreet dog blinks at the passers-by. She took no notice of Mahommed\nGunga until he swore at her.\n\n\"Miss-sahib hai?\" he growled; and the woman jumped up in a hurry and\nwent inside. A moment later Rosemary McClean stood framed in the doorway\nstill in her cotton riding-habit, very pale--evidently frightened at\nthe summons--but strangely, almost ethereally, beautiful. Her wealth of\nchestnut hair was loosely coiled above her neck, as though she had been\ncaught in the act of dressing it. She looked like the wan, wasted spirit\nof human pity--he like a great, grim war-god.\n\n\"Salaam, Miss Maklin-sahib!\"\n\nHe dismounted as he spoke and stood at attention, then stared\ntruculently, too inherently chivalrous to deny her civility--he would\nhave cut his throat as soon as address her from horseback while she\nstood--and too contemptuous of her father's calling to be more civil\nthan he deemed in keeping with his honor.\n\n\"Salaam, Mohammed Gunga!\" She seemed very much relieved, although\ndoubtful yet. \"Not letters again?\"\n\n\"No, Miss-sahib. I am no mail-carrier! I brought those letters as a\nfavor to Franklin-sahib at Peshawur; I was coming hither, and he had\nno man to send. I will take letters, since I am now going, if there are\nletters ready; I ride to-night.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mahommed Gunga. I have letters for England. They are not yet\nsealed. May I send them to you before you start?\"\n\n\"I will send my man for them. Also, Miss Maklin-sahib\" (heavens!\nhow much cleaner and better that sounded than the prince's ironical\n\"sahiba\"!)\n\n\"If you wish it, I will escort you to Peshawur, or to any city between\nhere and there.\"\n\n\"But--but why?\"\n\n\"I saw Jaimihr. I know Jaimihr.\"\n\n\"And--\"\n\n\"And--this is no place for a padre, or for the daughter of a padre.\"\n\nWhat he said was true, but it was also insolent, said insolently.\n\n\"Mahommed Gunga-sahib, what are those ribbons on your breast?\" she asked\nhim.\n\nHe glanced down at them, and his expression changed a trifle; it was\nscarcely perceptible, but underneath his fierce mustache the muscles of\nhis mouth stiffened.\n\n\"They are medal ribbons--for campaigns,\" he answered.\n\n\"Three-four-five! Then, you were a soldier a long time? Did you--did you\ndesert your post when there was danger?\"\n\nHe flushed, and raised his hand as though about to speak.\n\n\"Or did people insult you when you chose to remain on duty?\"\n\n\"Miss-sahib, I have not insulted you!\" said Mahommed Gunga. \"I came here\nfor another purpose.\"\n\n\"You came, very kindly, to ask whether there were letters. Thank you,\nMahommed Gunga-sahib, for your courtesy. There are letters, and I will\ngive them to your man, if you will be good enough to send him for them.\"\n\nHe still stood there, staring at her with eyes that did not blink. He\nwas too much of a soldier to admit himself at a loss what to say, yet\nhe had no intention of leaving Howrah without saying it, for that, too,\nwould have been unsoldierly.\n\n\"The reason why your countrymen have found men of this land before now\nto fight for them--one reason, at least--\" he said gruffly, \"is that\nhitherto they have not meddled with our religions. It is not safe! It\nwould be better to come away, Miss-sahib.\"\n\n\"Would you like to say that to my father? He is--\"\n\n\"Allah forbid that I should argue with him! I spoke to you, on your\naccount!\"\n\n\"You forget, I think,\" she answered him gently, \"that we had permission\nfrom the British Government to come here; it has not been withdrawn. We\nare doing no harm here--trying only to do good. There is always danger\nwhen--\"\n\n\"I would speak of that,\" he interrupted--\"You will not come away?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Your father could remain.\"\n\nShe shook her head again. \"I stay with him,\" she answered.\n\n\"At present, Jaimihr is the danger, Miss-sahib; but I think that at\npresent he will dare do nothing. The Maharajah dare do nothing either,\nyet. Should either of them make a move to interfere with you, it would\nnot be safe to appeal to the other one. You will not understand, but\nit is so. In that event, there is a way to safety of which I would warn\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mahommed Gunga. What is it?\"\n\n\"There are men more than a day's ride away from here who are to be\ndepended on--by you, at least--under all circumstances. Is that old\nwoman to be trusted?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" she smiled. \"I believe she is fond of me.\"\n\n\"That should be enough. I would like, if the Miss-sahib will permit, to\nspeak with her.\"\n\nAt a word from Miss McClean the old hag came out into the sun again and\nblinked at the Rajput, very much afraid of him. Mahommed Gunga saluted\nMiss McClean--swore at the old woman--pointed a wordless order with his\nright arm--watched her shuffle half a hundred yards up-street--followed\nher, and growled at her for about five minutes, while she nodded.\nFinally, he drew from the pocket of his crimson coat a small handful\nof gold mohurs--fat, dignified coins that glittered--and held them out\ntoward her with an air as though they meant nothing to him--positively\nnothing--Her eyes gleamed. He let her take a good look at the money\nbefore replacing it, then tossed her a silver quarter-rupee piece,\nsaluted Miss McClean again--for she was watching the pantomime from the\ndoorway still--and mounted and rode off, his back looking like the back\nof one who has neither care nor fear nor master.\n\nAt the caravansary his squire came running out to hold his stirrup.\n\n\"Picket the horse in the yard,\" said Mahommed Gunga, \"then find me\nanother servant and bring him to me in the room here!\"\n\n\"Another servant? But, sahib--\"\n\n\"I said another servant! Has deafness overcome thee?\" He used a word in\nthe dialect which left no room for doubt as to his meaning; it was to\nbe a different servant--a substitute for the squire he had already. The\nsquire bowed his head in disciplined obedience and led the horse away.\n\nAn hour later--evening was drawing on--he came back, followed by a\nsomewhat ruffianly-looking half-breed Rajput-Punjaubi. The new man was\nrather ragged and lacked one eye, but with the single eye he had he\nlooked straight at his prospective master. Mahommed Gunga glared at him,\nbut the man did not quail or shrink.\n\n\"This fellow wishes honorable service, sahib.\" The squire spoke as\nthough he were calling his master's attention to a horse that was for\nsale. \"I have seen his family; I have inquired about him; and I have\nexplained to him that unless he serves at thee faithfully his wife and\nhis man child will die at my hands in his absence.\"\n\n\"Can he groom a horse?\"\n\n\"So he says, sahib, and so say others.\"\n\n\"Can he fight?\"\n\n\"He slew the man with his bare hands who pricked his eye out with a\nsword.\"\n\n\"Oh! What payment does he ask?\"\n\n\"He leaves that matter to your honor's pleasure.\"\n\n\"Good. Instruct him, then. Set him to cleaning my horse and then return\nhere.\"\n\nThe squire was back again within five minutes and stood before Mahommed\nGunga in silent expectation.\n\n\"I shall miss thee,\" said Mahommed Gunga after five minutes' reflection.\n\"It is well that I have other servants in the north.\"\n\n\"In what have I offended, sahib?\"\n\n\"In nothing. Therefore there is a trust imposed.\"\n\nThe man salaamed. Mahommed Gunga produced his little handful of gold\nmohurs and divided it into two equal portions; one he handed to the\nsquire.\n\n\"Stay here. Be always either in the caravansary or else at call. Should\nthe old woman who serves Miss Maklin-sahib, the padre-sahib's daughter\ncome and ask thy aid, then saddle swiftly the three horses I will leave\nwith thee, and bear Miss Maklin-sahib and her father to my cousin Alwa's\nplace. Present two of the gold mohurs to the hag, should that happen.\"\n\n\"But sahib--two mohurs? I could buy ten such hags outright for the\nprice!\"\n\n\"She has my word in the matter! It is best to have her eager to win\ngreat reward. The hag will stay awake, but see to it that thou sleepest\nnot!\"\n\n\"And for how long must I stay here, sahib?\"\n\n\"One month--six months--a year--who knows? Until the hag summons thee,\nor I, by writing or by word of mouth, relieve thee of thy trust.\"\n\nAt sunset he sent the squire to Miss McClean for the letters he had\npromised to deliver; and at one hour after sunset, when the heat of the\nearth had begun to rise and throw back a hot blast to the darkened sky\nand the little eddies of luke-warm surface wind made movement for horse\nand man less like a fight with scorching death, he rode off, with his\nnew servant, on the two horses left to him of the five with which he\ncame.\n\nA six-hundred-mile ride without spare horses, in the heat of northern\nIndia, was an undertaking to have made any strong man flinch. The\nstronger the man, and the more soldierly, the better able he would be to\nrealize the effort it would call for. But Mahommed Gunga rode as though\nhe were starting on a visit to a near-by friend; he was not given\nto crossing bridges before he reached them, nor to letting prospects\ninfluence his peace of mind. He was a soldier. He took precautions\nfirst, when and where such were possible, then rode and looked fate in\nthe eye.\n\nHe appeared to take no more notice of the glowering looks that\nfollowed him from stuffy balconies and dense-packed corners than of the\nmosquitoes to and the heat. Without hurry he picked his way through\nthe thronged streets, where already men lay in thousands to escape the\nbreathlessness of walled interiors; the gutters seemed like trenches\nwhere the dead of a devastated city had been laid; the murmur was like\nthe voice of storm-winds gathering, and the little lights along the\nhousetops were for the vent-holes on the lid of a tormented underworld.\n\nBut he rode on at his ease. Ahead of him lay that which he considered\nduty. He could feel the long-kept peace of India disintegrating all\naround him, and he knew--he was certain--as sometimes a brave man can\nsee what cleverer men all overlook--that the right touch by the right\nman at the right moment, when the last taut-held thread should break,\nwould very likely swing the balance in favor of peace again, instead of\nindividual self seeking anarchy.\n\nHe knew what \"Cunnigan-bahadur\" would have done. He swore by\nCunnigan-bahadur. And the memory of that same dead, desperately honest\nCunningham he swore that no personal profit or convenience or safety\nshould be allowed to stand between him and what was honorable and right!\nMahommed Gunga had no secrets from himself; nor lack of imagination. He\nknew that he was riding--not to preserve the peace of India, for that\nwas as good as gone--but to make possible the winning back of it. And he\nrode with a smile on his thin lips, as the crusaders once rode on a less\nself-advertising errand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\n    \"You have failed!\" whispered Fate, and a weary civilian\n    Threw up his task as a matter of course.\n    \"Failed?\" said the soldier.  He knew a million\n    Chances untackled yet. \"Get me a horse!\"\n\nTHAT was a strange ride of Mahommed Gunga's, and a fateful one--more\nfull of portent for the British Raj in India than he, or the British,\nor the men amid whose homes he rode could ever have anticipated. He\naveraged a little less than twenty miles a day, and through an Indian\nhot-weather, and with no spare horse, none but a born horseman--a man\nof light weight and absolute control of temper--could have accomplished\nthat for thirty days on end.\n\nWherever he rode there was the same unrest. Here and there were new\ncomplaints he had not yet heard of, imaginary some of them, and some\nonly too well founded. Wherever there were Rajputs--and that race of\nfighting men is scattered all about the north--there was ill-suppressed\nimpatience for the bursting of the wrath to come. They bore no grudge\nagainst the English, but they did bear more than grudge against the\nmoney-lenders and the fat, litigious traders who had fattened under\nBritish rule. At least at the beginning it was evident that all the\ninterest of all the Rajputs lay in letting the British get the worst\nof it; even should the British suddenly wake up and look about them and\ntake steps--or should the British hold their own with native aid, and\nso save India from anarchy, and afterward reward the men who helped--the\nRajputs would stand to gain less individually, or even collectively,\nthan if they let the English be driven to the sea, and then reverted to\nthe age-old state of feudal lawlessness that once had made them rich.\n\nMany of the Hindoo element among them were almost openly disloyal. The\nryots--the little one and two acre farmers--were the least unsettled;\nthey, when he asked them--and he asked often--disclaimed the least\ndesire to change a rule that gave them safe holdings and but one\ntax-collection a year; they were frankly for their individual\nselves--not even for one another, for the ryots as a class.\n\nNobody seemed to be for India, except Mahommed Gunga; and he said\nlittle, but asked ever-repeated questions as he rode. There were men who\nwould like to weld Rajputana into one again, and over-ride the rest\nof India; and there were other men who planned to do the same for the\nPunjaub; there were plots within plots, not many of which he learned in\nanything like detail, but none of which were more than skin-deep below\nthe surface. All men looked to the sudden, swift, easy whelming of the\nBritish Raj, and then to the plundering of India; each man expected to\nbe rich when the whelming came, and each man waited with ill-controlled\nimpatience for the priests' word that would let loose the\nhundred-million flood of anarchy.\n\n\"And one man--one real man whom they trusted--one leader--one man who\nhad one thousand at his back--could change the whole face of things!\"\nhe muttered to himself. \"Would God there we a Cunnigan! But there is no\nCunnigan. And who would follow me? They would pull my beard, tell me I\nwas scheming for my own ends!--I, who was taught by Cunnigan, and would\nserve only India!\"\n\nHe would ride before dawn and when the evening breeze had come to cool\nthe hot earth a little through the blazing afternoons he would lie in\nthe place of honor by some open window, where he could watch a hireling\nflick the flies off his lean, road-hardened horse, and listen to\nthe plotting and the carried tales of plots, pretending always to be\nsympathetic or else open to conviction.\n\n\"A soldier? Hah! A soldier fights for the side that can best reward\nhim!\" he would grin. \"And, when there is no side, perhaps he makes one!\nI am a soldier!\"\n\nIf they pressed him, he would point to his medal ribbons, that he always\nwore. \"The British gave me those for fighting against the northern\ntribes beyond the Himalayas,\" he would tell them. \"The southern\ntribes--Bengalis of the south and east--would give better picking than\nmere medal ribbons!\"\n\nThey were not all sure of him. They were not all satisfied why he\nshould ride on to Peshawur, and decline to stay with them and talk good\nsedition.\n\n\"I would see how the British are!\" he told them. And he told the truth.\nBut they were not quite satisfied; he would have made a splendid leader\nto have kept among them, until he--too--became too powerful and would\nhave to be deposed in turn.\n\nHis own holding was a long way from Peshawur, and he was no rich man\nwho could afford at a mere whim to ride two long days' march beyond his\ngoal. Nor was he, as he had explained to Miss McClean, a letter-carrier;\nhe would get no more than the merest thanks for delivering her letters\nto where they could be included in the Government mail-bag. Yet he\nleft the road that would have led him homeward to his left, and carried\non--quickening his pace as he neared the frontier garrison town, and\nwasting, then, no time at all on seeking information. Nobody supposed\nthat the Pathans and the other frontier tribes were anything but openly\nrebellious, and he would have been an idiot to ask questions about their\nloyalty.\n\nBecause of their disloyalty, and the ever-present danger that they\nwere, the biggest British garrison in India had to be kept cooped up\nin Peshawur, to rot with fever and ague and the other ninety Indian\nplagues.\n\nHe wanted to see that garrison again, and estimate it, and make up his\nmind what exactly, or probably, the garrison would do in the event of\nthe rebellion blazing out. And he wanted to try once more to warn some\none in authority, and make him see the smouldering fire beneath the\nouter covering of sullen silence.\n\nHe received thanks for the letters. He received an invitation to take\ntea on the veranda of an officer so high in the British service\nthat many a staff major would have given a month's pay for a like\nopportunity. But he was laughed at for the advice he had to give.\n\n\"Mahommed Gunga, you're like me, you're getting old!\" said the high\nofficial.\n\n\"Not so very old, sahib. I was a young man when Cunnigan-bahadur raised\na regiment and licked the half of Rajputana into shape with it. Not too\nold, sahib, to wish there were another Cunnigan to ride with!\"\n\n\"Well, Mahommed Gunga, you're closer to your wish than you suppose!\nYoung Cunningham's gazetted, and probably just about starting on his way\nout here via the Cape of Good Hope. He should be here in three or four\nmonths at the outside.\"\n\n\"You mean that, sahib?\"\n\n\"Wish I didn't! The puppy will arrive here with altogether swollen\nnotions of his own importance and what is due his father's son. He's\nbeen captain of his college at home, and that won't lessen his sense of\nself-esteem either. I can foresee trouble with that boy!\"\n\n\"Sahib, there is a service I could render!\"\n\nThe Rajput spoke with a strangely constrained voice all of a sudden,\nbut the Commissioner did not notice it; he was too busy pulling on a\nwool-lined jacket to ward off the evening chill.\n\n\"Well, risaldar--what then?\"\n\n\"I think that I could teach the son of Cunnigan-bahadur to be worth his\nsalt.\"\n\n\"If you'll teach him to be properly respectful to his betters I'll be\ngrateful to you, Mahommed Gunga.\"\n\n\"Then, sahib, I shall have certain license allowed me in the matter?\"\n\n\"Do anything you like, in reason, risaldar! Only keep the pup from\ncutting his eye-teeth on his seniors' convenience, that's all!\"\n\nMahommed Gunga wasted no time after that on talking, nor did he wait to\nspecify the nature of the latitude he would expect to be allowed him; he\nknew better. And he knew now that the one chance that he sought had been\ngiven him.\n\nLike all observant natives, he was perfectly aware that the British\nweakness mostly lay in the age of the senior officers and the slowness\nof promotion. There were majors of over fifty years of age, and if a\nman were a general at seventy he was considered fortunate and young. The\njealousy with which younger men were regarded would have been humorous\nhad it not come already so near to plunging India into anarchy.\n\nHe did not even trouble to overlook the garrison. He took his leave,\nand rode away the long two-day ride to his own place, where a sadly\nattenuated rent-roll and a very sadly thinned-down company of servants\nwaited his coming. There, through fourteen hurried, excited days, he\nmade certain arrangements about the disposition of his affairs during\nan even longer absence; he made certain sales--pledged the rent of fifty\nacres for ten years, in return for an advance--and on the fifteenth day\nrode southward, at the head of a five-man escort that, for quality, was\nworthy of a prince.\n\nA little less than three months later he arrived at Bombay, and by dint\nof much hard bargaining and economy fitted out himself and his escort,\nso that each man looked as though he were the owner of an escort of his\nown. Then, fretful at every added day that strained his fast-diminishing\nresources, he settled down to wait until the ship should come that\nbrought young Cunningham.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\n    Lies home beneath a sickly sun,\n            Where humbleness was taught me?\n    Or here, where spurs my father won\n            On bended knee are brought me?\n\nHE landed, together with about a dozen other newly gazetted subalterns\nand civil officers, cramped, storm-tossed, snubbed, and then disgorged\nfrom a sailing-ship into a port that made no secret of its absolute\ncontempt for new arrivals.\n\nThere were liners of a kind on the Red Sea route, and the only seniors\nwho chose the long passage round the Cape were men returning after\nsick-leave--none too sweet-tempered individuals, and none too prone\nto give the young idea a good conceit of himself. He and the other\nyoungsters landed with a crushed-in notion that India would treat\nthem very cavalierly before she took them to herself. And all, save\nCunningham, were right.\n\nThe other men, all homesick and lonely and bewildered, were met by\nbankers' agents, or, in cases, only by a hotel servant armed with a\nletter of instructions. Here and there a bored, tired-eyed European had\nfound time, for somebody-or-other's sake, to pounce on a new arrival\nand bear him away to breakfast and a tawdry imitation of the real\nhospitality of northern India; but for the most part the beardless boys\nlounged in the red-hot customs shed (where they were to be mulcted for\nthe privilege of serving their country) and envied young Cunningham.\n\nHe--as pale as they, as unexpectant as they were of anything approaching\nwelcome--was first amazed, then suspicious, then pleased, then proud, in\nturn. The different emotions followed one another across his clean-lined\nface as plainly as a dawn vista changes; then, as the dawn leaves a\nlandscape finally, true and what it is for all to see, true dignity was\nleft and the look of a man who stands in armor.\n\n\"His father's son!\" growled Mahommed Gunga; and the big, black-bearded\nwarriors who stood behind him echoed, \"Ay!\"\n\nBut for four or five inches of straight stature, and a foot, perhaps,\nof chest-girth, he was a second edition of the Cunnigan-bahadur who had\nraised and led a regiment and licked peace into a warring countryside;\nand though he was that much bigger than his father had been, they dubbed\nhim \"Chota\" Cunnigan on the instant. And that means \"Little Cunningham.\"\n\nHe had yet to learn that a Rajput, be he poorest of the poor, admits no\nsuperior on earth. He did not know yet that these men had come, at one\nman's private cost, all down the length of India to meet him. Nobody had\ntold him that the feudal spirit dies harder in northern Hindustan than\nit ever did in England, or that the Rajput clans cohere more tightly\nthan the Scots. The Rajput belief that honest service--unselfishly\ngiven--is the greatest gift that any man may bring--that one who has\nreceived what he considers favors will serve the giver's son--was an\nunknown creed to him as yet.\n\nBut he stood and looked those six men in the eye, and liked them. And\nthey, before they had as much as heard him speak, knew him for a soldier\nand loved him as he stood.\n\nThey hung sickly scented garlands round his neck, and kissed his hand\nin turn, and spoke to him thereafter as man to man. They had found their\ngoal worth while, and they bore him off to his hotel in clattering glee,\nriding before him as men who have no doubt of the honor that they\npay themselves. No other of the homesick subalterns drove away with a\nsix-man escort to clear the way and scatter sparks!\n\nThey careered round through the narrow gate of the hotel courtyard as\nthough a Viceroy at least were in the trap behind them; and Mahommed\nGunga--six medaled, strapping feet of him--dismounted and held out an\narm for him to take when he alighted. The hotel people understood at\nonce that Somebody from Somewhere had arrived.\n\nYoung Cunningham had never yet been somebody. The men who give their\nlives for India are nothing much at home, and their sons are even less.\nScarcely even at school, when they had made him captain of the team, had\nhe felt the feel of homage and the subtle flattery that undermines a\nbad man's character; at schools in England they confer honors but take\nsimultaneous precautions. He was green to the dangerous influence of\nfeudal loyalty, but he quitted himself well, with reserve and dignity.\n\n\"He is good! He will do!\" swore Mahommed Gunga fiercely, for the other\nemotions are meant for women only.\n\n\"He is better than the best!\"\n\n\"We will make a man of this one!\"\n\n\"Did you mark how he handed me his purse to defray expenses?\" asked a\nblack-bearded soldier of the five.\n\n\"He is a man who knows by instinct!\" said Mahommed Gunga. \"See to it\nthat thy accounting is correct, and overpay no man!\"\n\nDeep-throated as a bull, erect as a lance, and pleased as a little\nchild, Mahommed Gunga came to him alone that evening to talk, and to\nhear him talk, and to tell him of the plans that had been made.\n\n\"Thy father gave me this,\" he told him, producing a gold watch and\nchain of the hundred-guinea kind that nowadays are only found among\nthe heirlooms. Young Cunningham looked at it, and recognized the heavy\nold-gold case that he had been allowed to \"blow open\" when a little boy.\nOn the outside, deep-chiseled in the gold, was his father's crest, and\non the inside a portrait of his mother.\n\n\"Thy father died in these two arms, bahadur! Thy father said: 'Look\nafter him, Mahommed Gunga, when the time is ripe for him to be a\nsoldier.' And I said: 'Ha, huzoor!' So! Then here is India!\"\n\nHe waved one hand grandiloquently, as though he were presenting the\nthrone of India to his proteg\u00e9!\n\n\"Here, sahib, is a servant--blood of my own blood.\"\n\nHe clapped his hands, and a man who looked like the big, black-ended\nspirit of Aladdin's lamp stood silent, instant, in the doorway.\n\n\"He speaks no English, but he may help to teach thee the Rajput tongue,\nand he will serve thee well--on my honor. His throat shall answer for\nit! Feed him and clothe him, sahib, but pay him very little--to serve\nwell is sufficient recompense.\"\n\nYoung Cunningham gave his keys at once to the silent servant, as a tacit\nsign that from that moment he was trusted utterly; and Mahommed Gunga\nnodded grim approval.\n\n\"Thy father saw fit to bequeath me much in the hour when death came on\nhim, sahib. I am no boaster, as he knew. Remember, then, to tell me if I\nfail at any time in what is due. I am at thy service!\"\n\nTact was inborn in Cunningham, as it had been in his father. He realized\nthat he ought at once to show his appreciation of the high plane of the\nservice offered.\n\n\"There is one way in which you could help me almost at once, Mahommed\nGunga,\" he answered.\n\n\"Command me, sahib.\"\n\n\"I need your advice--the advice of a man who really knows. I need\nhorses, and--at first at least--I would rather trust your judgment than\nmy own. Will you help me buy them?\"\n\nThe Raiput's eyes blazed pleasure. On war, and wine, and women, and a\nhorse are the four points to ask a man's advice and win his approval by\nthe asking.\n\n\"Nay, sahib; why buy horses here? These Bombay traders have only crows'\nmeat to sell to the ill-advised. I have horses, and spare horses for\nthe journey; and in Rajputana I have horses waiting for thee--seven,\nall told--sufficient for a young officer. Six of them are\ncountry-bred-sand-weaned--a little wild perhaps, but strong, and up to\nthy weight. The seventh is a mare, got by thy father's stallion Aga\nKhan (him that made more than a hundred miles within a day under a\nfifteen-stone burden, with neither food nor water, and survived!). A\ngood mare, sahib--indeed a mare of mares--fit for thy father's son. That\nmare I give thee. It is little, sahib, but my best; I am a poor man. The\nother six I bought--there is the account. I bought them cheaply, paying\nless than half the price demanded in each case--but I had to borrow and\nmust pay back.\"\n\nYoung Cunningham was hard put to it to keep his voice steady as he\nanswered. This man was a stranger to him. He had a hazy recollection\nof a dozen or more bearded giants who formed a moving background to his\ndreams of infancy, and he had expected some sort of welcome from one or\ntwo perhaps, of his father's men when he reached the north. But to have\nmen borrow money that they might serve him, and have horses ready for\nhim, and to be met like this at the gate of India by a man who admitted\nhe was poor, was a little more than his self-control had been trained as\nyet to stand.\n\n\"I won't waste words, Mahommed Gunga,\" he said, half-choking.\n\"I'll--er--I'll try to prove how I feel about it.\"\n\n\"Ha! How said I? Thy father's son, I said! He, too, was no believer in\nmuch promising! I was his servant, and will serve him still by serving\nthee. The honor is mine, sahib, and the advantage shall be where thy\nfather wished it.\"\n\n\"My father would never have had me--\"\n\n\"Sahib, forgive the interruption, but a mistake is better checked. Thy\nfather would have flung thee ungrudged, into a hell of bayonets, me,\ntoo, and would have followed after, if by so doing he could have served\nthe cause he held in trust. He bred thee, fed thee, and sent thee\noversea to grow, that in the end India might gain! Thou and I are\nbut servants of the peace, as he was. If I serve thee, and thou the\nRaj--though the two of us were weaned on the milk of war and get our\nbread by war--we will none the less serve peace! Aie! For what is honor\nif a soldier lets it rust? Of what use is service, mouthed and ready,\nbut ungiven? It is good, Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur, that thou art come at\nlast!\"\n\nHe saluted and backed out through the swinging door. He had come in his\nuniform of risaldar of the elder Cunningham's now disbanded regiment,\nso he had not removed his boots as another native--and he himself if\nin mufti--would have done. Young Cunningham heard him go swaggering and\nclanking and spur-jingling down the corridor as though he had half a\ntroop of horse behind him and wanted Asia to know it!\n\nIt was something of a brave beginning that, for a twenty-one-year-old!\nSomething likely--and expressly calculated by Mahommed Gunga--to bring\nthe real man to the surface. He had been no Cunningham unless his sense\nof duty had been very near the surface--no Englishman, had he not been\nproud that men of a foreign, conquered race should think him worthy of\nall that honor; and no man at all if his eye had been quite dry when\nthe veteran light-horseman swaggered out at last and left him to his own\nreflections.\n\nHe had not been human if he had not felt a little homesick still,\nalthough home to him had been a place where a man stayed with distant\nrelatives between the intervals of school. He felt lonely, in spite of\nhis reception--a little like a baby on the edge of all things new and\nwonderful. He would have been no European if he had not felt the heat,\nthe hotel was like a vapor-bath.\n\nBut the leaping red blood of youth ran strong in him. He had\nimagination. He could dream. The good things he was tasting were a\npresage only of the better things to come, and that is a wholesome point\nof view. He was proud--as who would not be?--to step straight into the\ntracks of such a father; and with that thought came another--just as\ngood for him, and for India, that made him feel as though he were a\nrobber yet, a thief in another's cornfield, gathering what he did not\nsow. It came over him in a flood that he must pay the price of all this\nhomage.\n\nSome men pay in advance, some at the time, and some pay afterward.\nAll men, he knew, must pay. It would be his task soon to satisfy these\ngentle-men, who took him at his face value, by proving to them that\nthey had made no very great mistake. The thought thrilled him instead\nof frightening--brought out every generous instinct that he had and made\nhim thank the God of All Good Soldiers that at least he would have a\nchance to die in the attempt. There was nothing much the matter with\nyoung Cunningham.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\n    I take no man at rumor's price,\n            Nor as the gossips cry him.\n    A son may ride, and stride, and stand;\n            His father's eye--his father's hand--\n    His father's tongue may give command;\n            But ere I trust I'll try him!\n\nBUT before young Cunningham was called upon to pay even a portion of the\nprice of fealty there was more of the receiving of it still in store\nfor him, and he found himself very hard put to it, indeed, to keep\noverboiling spirits from becoming exultation of the type that nauseates.\n\nNone of the other subalterns had influence, nor had they hereditary\nanchors in the far northwest that would be likely to draw them on to\nactive service early in their career. They had already been made to\nsurrender their boyhood dreams of quick promotion; now, standing in\nlittle groups and asking hesitating questions, they discovered that\ntheir destination--Fort William--was about the least desirable of all\nthe awful holes in India.\n\nThey were told that a subaltern was lucky who could mount one step of\nthe promotion ladder in his first ten years; that a major at fifty, a\ncolonel at sixty, and a general at seventy were quite the usual thing.\nAnd they realized that the pay they would receive would be a mere\nbeggar's pittance in a neighborhood so expensive as Calcutta, and that\ntheir little private means would be eaten up by the mere, necessities\nof life. They showed their chagrin and it was not very easy for young\nCunningham, watching Mahommed Gunga's lordly preparations for the long\nup-country journey, to strike just the right attitude of pleasure at the\nprospect without seeming to flaunt his better fortune.\n\nMahommed Gunga interlarded his hoarse orders to the mule-drivers with\ndescriptions in stateliest English, thrown out at random to the world at\nlarge, of the glories of the manlier north--of the plains, where a man\nmight gallop while a horse could last, and of the mountains up beyond\nthe plains. He sniffed at the fetid Bombay reek, and spoke of the clean\nair sweeping from the snow-topped Himalayas, that put life and courage\ninto the lungs of men who rode like centaurs! And the other subalterns\nlooked wistful, eying the bullock-carts that would take their baggage by\nanother route.\n\nFully the half of what Mahommed Gunga said was due to pride of race\nand country. But the rest was all deliberately calculated to rouse the\nwicked envy of those who listened. He meant to make the son of \"Pukka\"\nCunnigan feel, before he reached his heritage, that he was going up to\nsomething worth his while. To quote his own north-country metaphor, he\nmeant to \"make the colt come up the bit.\" He meant that \"Chota\" Cunnigan\nshould have a proper sense of his own importance, and should chafe at\nrestraint, to the end that when his chance did come to prove himself he\nwould jump at it. Envy, he calculated--the unrighteous envy of men less\nfortunately placed--would make a good beginning. And it did, though\nhardly in the way he calculated.\n\nYoung Cunningham, tight-lipped to keep himself from grinning like a\nchild, determined to prove himself worthy of the better fortune; and\nMahommed Gunga would have cursed into his black beard in disgust had\nhe known of the private resolutions being formed to obey orders to the\nletter and obtain the good will of his seniors. The one thing that the\ngrim old Rajput wished for his protege was jealousy! He wanted him so\nwell hated by the \"nabobs\" who had grown crusty and incompetent in high\ncommand that life for him in any northern garrison would be impossible.\n\nThroughout the two months' journey to the north Mahommed Gunga never\nleft a stone unturned to make Cunningham believe himself much more than\nordinary clay. All along the trunk road, that trails by many thousand\ntowns and listens to a hundred languages, whatever good there was was\nCunningham's. Whichever room was best in each dak-bungalow, whichever\nchicken the kansamah least desired to kill, whoever were the stoutest\ndhoolee-bearers in the village, whichever horse had the easiest\npaces--all were Cunningham's. Respect were his, and homage and\nobeisance, for the Rajput saw to it.\n\nOf evenings, while they rested, but before the sun went down, the old\nrisaldar would come with his naked sabre and defy \"Chota\" Cunnigan to\ntry to touch him. For five long weeks he tried each evening, the Rajput\nnever doing anything but parry,--changing his sabre often to the other\nhand and grinning at the schoolboy swordsmanship--until one evening, at\nthe end of a more than usually hard-fought bout, the youngster pricked\nhim, lunged, and missed slitting his jugular by the merest fraction of\nan inch.\n\n\"Ho!\" laughed Mahommed Gunga later, as he sluiced out the cut while his\nown adherents stood near by and chaffed him. \"The cub cuts his teeth,\nthen! Soon it will be time to try his pluck.\"\n\n\"Be gentle with him, risaldar-sahib; a good cub dies as easily as a poor\none, until he knows the way.\"\n\n\"Leave him to me! I will show him the way, and we will see what we will\nsee. If he is to disgrace his father's memory and us, he shall do it\nwhere there are few to see and none to talk of it. When Alwa and the\nothers ask me, as they will ask, 'Is he a man?' I will give them a true\nanswer! I think he is a man, but I need to test him in all ways possible\nbefore I pledge my word on it.\"\n\nBut after that little accident the old risaldar had sword-sticks\nfashioned at a village near the road, and ran no more risks of being\nkilled by the stripling he would teach; and before many more days of\nthe road had ribboned out, young Cunningham--bareback or from the\nsaddle--could beat him to the ground, and could hold his own on foot\nafterward with either hand.\n\n\"The hand and eye are good!\" said Mahommed Gunga. \"It is time now for\nanother test.\"\n\nSo he made a plausible excuse about the horses, and they halted for four\ndays at a roadside dak-bungalow about a mile from where a foul-mouthed\nfakir sat and took tribute at a crossroads. It was a strangely chosen\nplace to rest at.\n\nDeep down in a hollow, where the trunk road took advantage of a winding\ngorge between the hills--screened on nearly all sides by green\njungle whose brown edges wilted in the heat which the inner steam\ndefied--stuffy, smelly, comfortless, it stood like a last left\nrear-guard of a white-man's city, swamped by the deathless, ceaselessly\nadvancing tide of green. It was tucked between mammoth trees that\nhad been left there when the space for it was cleared a hundred\nyears before, and that now stood like grim giant guardians with arms\nout-stretched to hold the verdure back.\n\nThe little tribe of camp-followers chased at least a dozen snakes out\nof corners, and slew them in the open, as a preliminary to further\ninvestigation. There were kas-kas mats on the foursquare floors, and\neach of these, when lifted, disclosed a swarm of scorpions that had to\nbe exterminated before a man dared move his possessions in. The once\nwhite calico ceilings moved suggestively where rats and snakes chased\none another, or else hunted some third species of vermin; and there was\na smell and a many-voiced weird whispering that hinted at corruption and\nwar to the death behind skirting boards and underneath the floor.\n\nIt had evidently not been occupied for many years; the kansamah looked\nlike a gray-bearded skeleton compressed within a tightened shroud of\nparchment skin that shone where a coffin or a tomb had touched it. He\nseemed to have forgotten what the bungalow was for, or that a sahib\nneeded things to eat, until the ex-risaldar enlightened him, and then he\ncomplained wheezily.\n\nThe stables--rather the patch-and-hole-covered desolation that once had\nbeen stables--were altogether too snake-defiled and smelly to be worth\nrepairing; the string of horses was quartered cleanly and snugly under\ntents, and Mahommed Gunga went to enormous trouble in arranging a ring\nof watch-fires at even distances.\n\n\"Are there thieves here, then?\" asked Cunningham, and the Rajput nodded\nbut said nothing. He seemed satisfied, though, that the man he had\nbrought safely thus far at so much trouble would be well enough housed\nin the creaky wreck of the bungalow, and he took no precautions of any\nkind as to guarding its approaches.\n\nCunningham watched the preparations for his supper with ill-concealed\ndisgust--saw the customary chase of a rubber-muscled chicken, heard its\ndeath gurgles, saw the guts removed, to make sure that the kansamah did\nnot cook it with that part of its anatomy intact, as he surely would do\nunless watched--and then strolled ahead a little way along the road.\n\nThe fakir was squatting in the distance, on a big white stone, and in\nthe quiet of the gloaming Cunningham could hear his coarse, lewd voice\ntossing crumbs of abuse and mockery to the seven or eight villagers\nwho squatted near him--half-amused, half-frightened, and altogether\ncredulous.\n\nEven as he drew nearer Cunningham could not understand a word of what\nthe fakir said, but the pantomime was obvious. His was the voice and\nthe manner of the professional beggar who has no more need to whine\nbut still would ingratiate. It was the bullying, brazen swagger and\nthe voice that traffics in filth and impudence instead of wit; and, in\npayment for his evening bellyful he was pouring out abuse of Cunningham\nthat grew viler and yet viler as Cunningham came nearer and the fakir\nrealized that his subject could not understand a word of it.\n\nThe villagers looked leery and eyed Cunningham sideways at each fresh\nsally. The fakir grew bolder, until one of his listeners smothered\nan open laugh in both hands and rolled over sideways. Cunningham came\ncloser yet, half-enamoured of the weird scene, half-curious to discover\nwhat the stone could be on which the fakir sat.\n\nThe fakir grew nervous. Perhaps, after all, this was one of those\nhatefully clever sahibs who know enough to pretend they do not know!\nThe abuse and vile innuendo changed to more obsequious, less obviously\nfilthy references to other things than Cunningham's religion, likes,\nand pedigree, and the little crowd of men who had tacitly encouraged him\nbefore got ready now to stand at a distance and take sides against him\nshould the white man turn out to have understood.\n\nBut Cunningham happened to catch sight of a cloud of paroquets that\nswept in a screaming ellipse for a better branch to nest in and added\nthe one touch of gorgeous color needed to make the whole scene utterly\nunearthly and unlike anything he had ever dreamed of, or had seen in\npictures, or had had described to him. He stood at gaze--forgetful of\nthe stone that had attracted him and of the fakir--spellbound by the\nwonder-blend of hues branch-backed, and framed in gloom as the birds'\nscream was framed in silence.\n\nAnd, seeing him at gaze, the fakir recovered confidence and jeered new\nribaldry, until some one suddenly shot out from behind Cunningham, and\nbefore he had recovered from his surprise he saw the fakir sprawling on\nhis back, howling for mercy, while Mahommed Gunga beat the blood out of\nhim with a whalebone riding-whip.\n\nThe sun went down with Indian suddenness and shut off the scene\nof upraised lash and squirming, naked, ash-smeared devil, as a\nmagic-lantern picture; disappears. Only the creature's screams\nreverberated through the jungle, like a belated echo to the restless\nparoquets.\n\n\"He will sleep less easily for a week or two!\" hazarded Mahommed Gunga,\nstepping back toward Cunningham. In the sudden darkness the white\nbreeches showed and the whites of his eyes, but little else; his voice\ngrowled like a rumble from the underworld.\n\n\"Why did you do it, risaldar? What did he say?\"\n\n\"It was enough, bahadur, that he sat on that stone; for that alone\nhe had been beaten! What he said was but the babbling of priests. All\npriests are alike. They have a common jargon--a common disrespect for\nwhat they dare not openly defy. These temple rats of fakirs mimic them.\nThat is all, sahib. A whipping meets the case.\"\n\n\"But the stone? Why shouldn't he sit on it?\"\n\n\"Wait one minute, sahib, and then see.\" He formed his hands into a\ntrumpet and bellowed through them in a high-pitched, nasal, ululating\norder to somebody behind:\n\n\"Oh-h-h--Battee-lao!\"\n\nThe black, dark roadside echoed it and a dot of light leapt up as a man\ncame running with what gradually grew into a lamp.\n\nMahommed Gunga seized the lamp, bent for a few seconds over the still\nsprawling fakir, whipped him again twice, cursed him and kicked him,\nuntil he got up and ran like a spectre for the gloom beyond the trees.\nThen, with a rather stately sweep of the lamp, and a tremble in his\nvoice that was probably intentional--designed to make Cunningham at\nleast aware of the existence of emotion before he looked--he let the\nlight fall on the slab on which the fakir had been squatting.\n\n\"Look, Cunningham-sahib!\"\n\nThe youngster bent down above the slab and tried, in the fitful light,\nto make out what the markings were that ran almost from side to side, in\ncurves, across the stone; but it was too dark--the light was too fitful;\nthe marks themselves were too faint from the constant squatting of\nroadside wanderers.\n\nMahommed Gunga set the lamp down on the stone, and he and the attendant\ntook little sticks, sharp-pointed, with which they began to dig\nhurriedly, scratching and scraping at what presently showed, even in\nthat rising and falling light, as Roman lettering. Soon Cunningham\nhimself began to lend a hand. He made out a date first, and he could\nfeel it with his fingers before his eyes deciphered it. Gradually,\nletter by letter--word by word--he read it off, feeling a strange new\nthrill run through him, as each line followed, like a voice from the\nhaunted past.\n\n\n    A.D. 1823. A.D.\n    SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF GENERAL ROBERT FRANCIS CUNNINGHAM\n    WHO DIED ON THIS SPOT\n    AETAT 81\n    FROM\n    WOUNDS INFLICTED BY A\n    TIGER\n\nThere was no sound audible except the purring of the lamp flame and\nthe heavy breathing of the three as Cunningham gazed down at the very\ncrudely carved, stained, often-desecrated slab below which lay the first\nof the Anglo-Indian Cunninghams.\n\nThis man--these crumbled bones that lay under a forgotten piece of\nrock--had made all of their share of history. They had begotten \"Pukka\"\nCunningham, who had hacked the name deeper yet in the crisscrossed\nannals of a land of war. It was strange--it was queer--uncanny--for the\nthird of the Cunninghams to be sitting on the stone. It was unexpected,\nyet it seemed to have a place in the scheme of things, for he caught\nhimself searching his memory backward.\n\nHe received an impression that something was expected of him. He knew,\nby instinct and reasoning he could not have explained, that neither\nMahommed Gunga nor the other men would say a word until he spoke. They\nwere waiting--he knew they were--for a word, or a sign, or an order\n(he did not know which), on which would hang the future of all three of\nthem.\n\nYet there was no hurry--no earthly hurry. He felt sure of it. In\nthe silence and the blackness--in the tense, steamy atmosphere of\nexpectancy--he felt perfectly at ease, although he knew, too, that there\nwas superstition to be reckoned with--and that is something which a\nwhite man finds hard to weigh and cope with, as a rule.\n\nThe sweat ran down his face in little streams a the prickly heat began\nto move across his skin, like a fiery-footed centiped beneath his\nundershirt, but he noticed, neither. He began to be unconscious anything\nexcept the knowledge that the bones of his grandsire lay underneath\nhim and that Mahommed Gunga waited for the word that would fit into the\nscheme and solve a problem.\n\n\"Are there any tigers here now?\" he asked presently, in a perfectly\nnormal voice. He spoke as he had done when his servant asked him which\nsuit he would wear.\n\n\"Ha, sahib! Many.\"\n\n\"Man-eaters, by any chance?\"\n\nMahommed Gunga and the other man exchanged quick glances, but Cunningham\ndid not look up. He did not see the quick-flashed whites as their eyes\nmet and looked down again.\n\n\"There is one, sahib--so say the kansamah and the head man--a full-grown\ntiger, in his prime.\"\n\n\"I will shoot him.\" Four words, said quietly--not \"Do you think,\" or \"I\nwould like to,\" or \"Perhaps.\" They were perfectly definite and without a\ntrace of excitement; yet this man had never seen a tiger.\n\n\"Very good, sahib.\" That, too, was spoken in a level voice, but Mahommed\nGunga's eyes and the other man's met once again above his head.\n\n\"We will stay here four days; by the third day there will be time enough\nto have brought an elephant and--\"\n\n\"I will go on foot,\" said Cunningham, quite quietly. \"Tomorrow, at dawn,\nrisaldar-sahib. Will you be good enough to make arrangements? All we\nneed to know is where he is and how to get there--will you attend to\nthat?\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I wonder if my supper's ready.\"\n\nHe turned and walked away, with a little salute-like movement of his\nhand that was reminiscent of his father. The two Rajputs watched him\nin heavy-breathing silence until the little group of lights, where the\nhorse-tents faced the old dak-bungalow, swallowed him. Then:\n\n\"He is good. He will do!\" said the black-beard who had brought the lamp.\n\n\"He is good. But many sahibs would have acted coolly, thus. There must\nbe a greater test. There must be no doubt--no littlest doubt. Alwa and\nthe others will ask me on my honor, and I will answer on my honor, yes\nor no.\"\n\nIt was an hour before the two of them returned, and looked the horses\nover and strolled up to bid Cunningham good night; and in the meanwhile\nthey had seen about the morrow's tiger, and another matter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\n    What found ye, then? Why heated ye the pot?\n            What useful metal down the channels ran?\n    Gold?  Steel for making weapons?  Iron?  What?\n            Nay. Out from the fire we kindled strode a man!\n\nTHEY set the legs of Cunningham's string-woven bed into pans of water,\nto keep the scorpions and ants and snakes at bay, and then left him in\npitch darkness to his own devices, with a parting admonition to keep his\nslippers on for the floor, in the dark, would be the prowling-place of\nvenomed death.\n\nIt was he who set the lamp on the little table by his bedside, for his\nservant--for the first time on that journey--was not at hand to execute\nhis thoughts almost before he had spoken them. Mahommed Gunga had\nexplained that the man was sick; and that seemed strange, for he had\nbeen well enough, and more than usually efficient, but an hour before.\n\nBut there were stranger things and far more irritating ones to interfere\nwith the peaceful passage of the night. There were sounds that were\nunaccountable; there was the memory of the wayside tombstone and the\ntrain of thought that it engendered. Added to the hell-hot, baking\nstuffiness that radiated from the walls, there came the squeaking of a\npunka rope pulled out of time--the piece of piping in the mud-brick wall\nthrough which the rope passed had become clogged and rusted, and the\nvillager pressed into service had forgotten how to pull; he jerked at\nthe cord between nods as the heat of the veranda and the unaccustomed\nnight duty combined to make him sleepy.\n\nSoon the squeaking became intolerable, and Cunningham swore at him--in\nEnglish, because he spoke little of any native language yet, and had not\nthe least idea in any case what the punka-wallah's tongue might be.\nFor a while after that the pulling was more even; he lay on one elbow,\nletting the swinging mat fan just miss his ear, and examining his rifle\nand pistols for lack of anything better to keep him from going mad.\nThen, suddenly, the pulling ceased altogether. Silence and hell heat\nshut down on him like a coffin lid. Even the lamp flame close beside him\nseemed to grow dim; the weight of black night that was suffocating him\nseemed to crush light out of the flame as well.\n\nNo living mortal could endure that, he imagined. He swore aloud, but\nthere was no answer, so he got up, after crashing his rifle-butt down\non the floor to scare away anything that crawled. For a moment he stood,\nundecided whether to take the lamp or rifle with him--then decided on\nthe rifle, for the lamp might blow out in some unexpected night gust,\nwhereas if he left it where it was it would go on burning and show him\nthe way back to bed again. Besides, he was too unaccustomed to the joy\nof owning the last new thing in sporting rifles to hesitate for long\nabout what to keep within his grasp.\n\nThrough the open door he could see nothing but pitch-blackness,\nunpunctuated even by a single star. There were no lights where the tents\nstood, so he judged that even the accustomed natives had found the added\nheat of Mahommed Gunga's watch-fires intolerable and had raked them\nout; but from where he imagined that the village must be came the\ndum-tu-dum-tu-dum of tom-toms, like fever blood pulsating in the veins\nof devils of the night.\n\nThe punka-wallah slept. He could just make out the man's blurred\nshape--a shadow in the shadows--dog-curled, with the punkah rope looped\nround his foot. He kicked him gently, and the man stirred, but\nfell asleep again. He kicked him harder. The man sat up and stared,\nterrified; the whites of his eyes were distinctly visible. He seemed to\nhave forgotten why he was there, and to imagine that he saw a ghost.\n\nCunningham spoke to him--he first words that came into his head.\n\n\"Go on pulling,\" he said in English, quite kindly.\n\nBut if he had loosed his rifle off, the effect could not have been more\ninstantaneous. Clutching his twisted rag of a turban in one hand,\nand kicking his leg free, he ran for it--leaped the veranda rail, and\nvanished--a night shadow, swallowed by its mother night.\n\n\"Come back!\" called Cunningham. \"Iderao! I won't hurt you!\"\n\nBut there was no answer, save the tom-toms' thunder, swelling now into\na devil's chorus-coming nearer. It seemed to be coming from the forest,\nbut he reasoned that it could not be; it must be some village marriage\nfeast, or perhaps an orgy; he had paid out what would seem to the\nvillagers a lot of money, and it might be that they were celebrating the\noccasion. It was strange, though, that he could see no lights where the\nvillage ought to be.\n\nFor a moment he had a half-formed intention to shout for Mahommed\nGunga; but he checked that, reasoning that the Rajput might think he\nwas afraid. Then his eye caught sight of something blacker than\nthe shadows--something long and thin and creepy that moved, and he\nremembered that bed, where the pans of water would protect him, was the\nonly safe place.\n\nSo he returned into the hot, black silence where the tiny lamp-flame\nguttered and threw shadows. He wondered why it guttered. It seemed to\nbe actually short of air. There were four rooms, he remembered, to the\nbungalow, all connected and each opening outward by a door that faced\none of the four sides; he wondered whether the outer doors were opened\nto admit a draught, and started to investigate.\n\nTwo of them were shut tight, and he could not kick them open; the\ndried-out teak and the heavy iron bolts held as though they had been\nbuilt to resist a siege; the noise that he made as he rattled at them\nfrightened a swarm of unseen things--unguessed-at shapes--that scurried\naway. He thought he could see beady little eyes that looked and\ndisappeared and circled round and stopped to look again. He could hear\ncreepy movements in the stillness. It seemed better to leave those doors\nalone.\n\nOne other door, which faced that of his own room, was open wide, and he\ncould feel the forest through it; there was nothing to be seen, but the\nstillness moved. The velvet blackness was deeper by a shade, and the\nheat, uprising to get even with the sky, bore up a stench with it. There\nwas no draught, no movement except upward. Earth was panting-in time, it\nseemed, to the hellish thunder of the tom-toms.\n\nHe went back and lay on the bed again, leaning the rifle against the\ncot-frame, and trying by sheer will-power to prevent the blood from\nbursting his veins. He realized before long that he was parched with\nthirst, and reached out for the water-jar that stood beside the lamp;\nbut as he started to drink he realized that a crawling evil was swimming\nround and round in rings in the water. In a fit of horror he threw the\nthing away and smashed it into a dozen fragments in a corner. He saw a\ndozen rats, at least, scamper to drink before the water could evaporate\nor filter through the floor; and when they were gone there was no\nhalf-drowned crawling thing either. They had eaten it.\n\nHe clutched his rifle to him. The barrel was hot, but the feel of it\ngave him a sense of companionship. And then, as he lay back on the bed\nagain, the lamp went out. He groped for it and shook it. There was no\noil.\n\nNow, what had been hot horror turned to fear that passed all\nunderstanding--to the hate that does not reason--to the cold sweat\nbreaking on the roasted skin. Where the four walls had been there was\nblackness of immeasurable space. He could hear the thousand-footed\ncannibals of night creep nearer--driven in toward him by the dinning of\nthe tom-toms. He felt that his bed was up above a scrambling swarm of\nblack-legged things that fought.\n\nHe had no idea how long he lay stock-still, for fear of calling\nattention to himself, and hated his servant and Mahommed Gunga and all\nIndia. Once--twice--he thought he heard another sound, almost like the\nfootfall of a man on the veranda near him. Once he thought that a man\nbreathed within ten paces of him, and for a moment there was a distinct\nsensation of not being alone. He hoped it was true; he could deal with\nan assassin. That would be something tangible to hate and hit. Manhood\ncame to his assistance--the spirit of the soldier that will bow to\nnothing that has shape; but it died away again as the creeping silence\nonce more shut down on him.\n\nAnd then the thunder of the tom-toms ceased. Then even the venomed\ncrawlers that he knew were near him faded into nothing that really\nmattered, compared to the greater, stealthy horror that he knew was\ncoming, born of the shuddersome, shut silence that ensued. There\nwas neither air nor view--no sense of time or space--nothing but\nthe coal-black pit of terror yawning--cold sweat in the heat, and a\nfootfall--an undoubted footfall--followed by another one, too heavy for\na man's.\n\nWhere heavy feet were there was something tangible. His veins tingled\nand the cold sweat dried. Excitement began to reawaken all his soldier\nsenses, and the wish to challenge seized him--the soldierly intent to\nwarn the unaware, which is the actual opposite of cowardice.\n\n\"Halt! Who comes there?\"\n\nHe lipped the words, but his dry throat would not voice them. Before he\ncould clear his throat or wet his lips his eye caught something lighter\nthan the night--two things--ten--twelve paces off--two things that\nglowed or sheened as though there were light inside them--too big and\ntoo far apart to be owl's eyes, but singularly like them. They moved, a\nlittle sideways and toward him; and again he heard the heavy, stealthy\nfootfall.\n\nThey stayed still then for what may have been a minute, and another\nsense--smell--warned him and stirred up the man in him. He had never\nsmelled it in his life; it must have been instinct that assured him of\nan enemy behind the strange, unpleasant, rather musky reek that filled\nthe room. His right hand brought the rifle to his shoulder without\nsound, and almost without conscious effort on his part.\n\nHe forgot the heat now and the silence and discomfort. He lay still on\nhis side, squinting down the rifle barrel at a spot he judged was midway\nbetween a pair of eyes that glowed, and wondering where his foresight\nmight be. It struck him all at once that it was quite impossible to see\nthe foresight--that he must actually touch what he would hit if he would\nbe at all sure of hitting it. He remembered, too, in that instant--as a\nborn soldier does remember things--that in the dark an attacking enemy\nis probably more frightened than his foe. His father had told it him\nwhen he was a little lad afraid of bogies; he in turn had told it to the\nother boys at school, and they had passed it on until in that school it\nhad become rule number one of school-boy lore--just as rule number two\nin all schools where the sons of soldiers go is \"Take the fight to him.\"\n\nHe leaped from the bed, with his rifle out in front of\nhim--white-nightshirted and unexpected--sudden enough to scare the\nwits out of anything that had them. He was met by a snarl. The two eyes\nnarrowed, and then blazed. They lowered, as though their owner gathered\nup his weight to spring. He fired between them. The flash and the\nsmoke blinded him; the burst of the discharge within four echoing walls\ndeadened his cars, and he was aware of nothing but a voice beside him\nthat said quietly: \"Well done, bahadur! Thou art thy father's son!\"\n\nHe dropped his rifle butt to the floor, and some one struck a light.\nEven then it was thirty seconds before his strained eyes grew accustomed\nto the flare and he could see the tiger at his feet, less than a yard\naway--dead, bleeding, wide-eyed, obviously taken by surprise and shot as\nhe prepared to spring. Beside him, within a yard, Mahommed Gunga stood,\nwith a drawn sabre in his right hand and a pistol in his left, and there\nwere three other men standing like statues by the walls.\n\n\"How long have you been here?\" demanded Cunningham.\n\n\"A half-hour, sahib.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"In case of need, sahib. That tiger killed a woman yesterday at dawn\nand was driven off his kill; he was not likely to be an easy mark for an\nuntried hunter.\"\n\n\"Why did you enter without knocking?\"\n\nThe ex-risaldar said nothing.\n\n\"I see that you have shoes on.\"\n\n\"The scorpions, sahib--\"\n\n\"Would you be pleased, Mahommed Gunga, if I entered your house with my\nhat on and without knocking or without permission?\"\n\n\"Sahib, I--\"\n\n\"Be good enough to have that brute's carcass dragged out and skinned,\nand--ah--leave me to sleep, will you?\"\n\nMahommed Gunga bowed, and growled an order; another man passed the order\non, and the tom-tom thundering began again as a dozen villagers pattered\nin to take away the tiger.\n\n\"Tell them, please,\" commanded Cunningham, \"that that racket is to\ncease. I want to sleep.\"\n\nAgain Mahommed Gunga bowed, without a smile or a tremor on his face;\nagain a growled order was echoed and re-echoed through the dark. The\ndrumming stopped.\n\n\"Is there oil in the bahadur's lamp?\" asked Mahommed Gunga.\n\n\"Probably not,\" said Cunningham.\n\n\"I will command that--\"\n\n\"You needn't trouble, thank you, risaldar-sahib. I sleep better in the\ndark. I'll be glad to see you after breakfast as usual--ah--without your\nshoes, unless you come in uniform. Good night.\"\n\nThe Rajput signed to the others and withdrew with dignity. Cunningham\nreloaded his rifle in the dark and lay down. Within five minutes\nthe swinging of the punka and the squeaking of the rope resumed, but\nregularly this time; Mahommed Gunga had apparently unearthed a man who\nunderstood the business. Reaction, the intermittent coolth, as the\nmat fan swung above his face, the steady, evenly timed squeak and\nmovement--not least, the calm of well-asserted dignity--all joined to\nhave one way, and Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur slept, to dream of fire-eyed\ntigers dancing on tombstones laid on the roof of hell, and of a\ngrandfather in full general's uniform, who said: \"Well done, bahadur!\"\n\nBut outside, by a remade camp-fire, Mahommed Gunga sat and chuckled to\nhimself, and every now and then grew eloquent to the bearded men who sat\nbeside him.\n\n\"Aie! Did you hear him reprimand me? By the beard of God's prophet, that\nis a man of men! So was his father! Now I will tell Alwa and the others\nthat I bring a man to them! By the teeth of God and my own honor I will\nswear to it! His first tiger--he had never seen a tiger!--in the dark,\nand unexpected--caught by it, to all seeming, like a trapped man in a\ncage--no lamp--no help at hand, or so he thought until it was all\nover. And he ran at the tiger! And then, 'you come with your shoes on,\nMahommed Gunga--why, forsooth?' Did you hear him? By the blood of Allah,\nwe have a man to lead us!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\n    Now, the gist of the thing is--Be silent.  Be calm.\n            Be awake.  Be on hand on the day.\n    Be instant to heed the first note of alarm.\n            And--precisely--exactly--Obey.\n\nAT Howrah, while Mahommed Gunga was employing each chance circumstance\nto test the pluck and decision and reliability of Cunningham at almost\nevery resting-place along the Grand Trunk Road, the armed squire he had\nleft behind with a little handful of gold mohurs and three horses was\nfinding time heavy on his hands.\n\nLike his master, Ali Partab was a man of action, to whom the purlieus\nof a caravansary were well enough on rare occasions. He could ruffle\nit with the best of them; like any of his race, he could lounge\nwith dignity and listen to the tales that hum wherever many horsemen\ncongregate; and he was no mean raconteur--he had a tale or two to tell\nhimself, of women and the chase and of the laugh that he, too, had flung\nin the teeth of fear when opportunity arose.\n\nBut each new story of the paid taletellers, who squat and drone and\nreach a climax, and then pass the begging bowl before they finish\nit--each merrily related jest brought in by members of the constantly\narriving trading parties--each neigh of his three chargers--every new\nphase of the kaleidoscopic life he watched stirred new ambition in\nhim to be up, and away, and doing. Many a dozen times he had to remind\nhimself that \"there had been a trust imposed.\"\n\nHe exercised the horses daily, riding each in turn until he was as lean\nand lithe and hard beneath the skin as they were. They were Mahommed\nGunga's horses--he Mahommed Gunga's man; therefore, his honor was\ninvolved. He reasoned, when he took the trouble to, along the good clean\nfeudal line that lays down clearly what service is: there is no honor,\nsays that argument, in serving any one who is content with half a\nservice, and the honor is the only thing that counts.\n\nAs day succeeded ever sultrier, ever longer-drawn-out day--as each night\ncame that saw him peg the horses out wherever what little breezes moved\nmight fan them--as he sat among the courtyard groups and listened in the\nheavy heat, the fact grew more apparent to him that this trust of his\nwas something after all which a man of worth might shoulder proudly.\nThere was danger in it.\n\nThe talk among the traders--darkly hinted, most of it, and couched in\nmetaphor--was all of blood, and what would follow on the letting of it.\nNow and then a loud-mouthed boaster would throw caution to the winds and\nspeak openly of a grim day coming for the British; he would be checked\ninstantly by wiser men, but not before Ali Partab had heard enough to\nadd to his private store of information.\n\nPriests came from a dozen cities to the eastward, all nominally after\npilgrims for the sacred places, but all strangely indifferent to their\nquest. They preferred, it would seem, to sit in rings with chance-met\nruffians--with believers and unbelievers alike--even with men of no\ncaste at all--and talk of other things than pilgrimages.\n\n\"Next year, one hundred years ago the English conquered India. Remember\nye the prophecy? One hundred years they had! This, then, is the last\nyear. Whom the gods would whelm they first deprive of reason; mark ye\nthis! The cartridges they serve out to the sepoys now are smeared with\nthe blended fat of cows and pigs. Knowing that we Hindoos hold the cow\na sacred beast, they do this sacrilege--and why? They would make us bite\nthe cartridges and lose our caste. And why again? Because they would\nmake us Christians! That is the truth! Else why are the Christian\nmissionaries here in Howrah?\"\n\nThe listeners would nod while the little red fires glowed and purred\nabove the pipes, and others not included in the circle strained forward\nthrough the dark to listen.\n\n\"The gods get ready now! Are ye ready?\"\n\nElsewhere, a hadji--green-turbaned from the pilgrimage to Mecca--would\nhold out to a throng of true believers.\n\n\"Ay! Pig's fat on the cartridges! The new drill is that the sepoy bites\nthe cartridge first, to spill a little powder and make priming. Which\ntrue believer wishes to defile himself with pig's fat? Why do they\nthis? Why are the Christian missionaries here? Ask both riddles with one\nbreath, for both two are one!\"\n\n\"Slay, then!\"\n\n\"Up now, and slay!\"\n\nThere would be an instant, eager restlessness, while Ali Partab would\nglance over to where the horses stood, and would wonder why the\nword that loosed him was so long in coming. The hadji would calm his\nlisteners and tell them to get ready, but be still and await the sign.\n\n\"There were to be one hundred years, ran the prophecy; but ninety-nine\nand a portion have yet run. Wait for the hour!\"\n\nThen, for perhaps the hundredth time, Ali Partab would pretend that\nmovement alone could save one or other of his horses from heat apoplexy.\nHe would mount, and ride at a walking pace through the streets that\nseemed like a night view of a stricken battle-field, turn down by the\npalace wall, and then canter to the schoolhouse, where the hag--wiser\nthan her mistress--would be sleeping in the open.\n\n\"Thou! Mother of a murrain! Toothless one! Is there no word yet?\"\n\nThe hag would leer up through the heavy darkness--make certain that\nhe had no lance with him with which to prod her in the ribs--scratch\nherself a time or two like a stray dog half awakened--and then leer\nknowingly.\n\n\"Hast thou the gold mohurs?\" she would demand.\n\n\"Am I a sieve?\"\n\n\"Let my old eyes see them, sahib.\"\n\nHe would take out two gold coins and hold them out in such a way that\nshe could look at them without the opportunity to snatch.\n\n\"There is no word yet,\" she would answer, when her eyes had feasted on\nthem as long as his patience would allow.\n\n\"Have they no fear then?\"\n\n\"None. Only madness!\"\n\n\"See that they bite thee not! Keep thy wits with thee, and be ready to\nbring me word in time, else--\"\n\n\"Patience, sahib! Show me the coins again--one little look--again once!\"\n\nBut Ali Partab would wheel and ride away, leaving her to mumble and\ngibber in the road and curl again on to her blanket in the blackest\ncorner by the door.\n\nOnce, on an expedition of that kind, he encountered Duncan McClean\nhimself. The lean, tall Scotsman, gray-headed from the cares he had\ntaken on himself, a little bowed from heat and hopelessness, but showing\nno least symptom of surrender in the kind, strong lines of a rugged\nface, stood, eyes upward, in the moonlight. The moon, at least, looked\ncool. It was at the full, like a disk of silver, and he seemed to drink\nin the beams that bathed him.\n\n\"Does he worship it?\" wondered Ali Partab, reining from an amble to a\nwalk and watching half-reverently. The followers of Mohammed are most\nsuperstitious about the moon. The feeling that he had for this man of\npeace who could so gaze up at it was something very like respect, and,\nwith the twenty-second sense that soldiers have, he knew, without a word\nspoken or a deed seen done, that this would be a wielder of cold steel\nto be reckoned should he ever slough the robes of peace and take it into\nhis silvered head to fight. The Rajput, that respects decision above all\nother virtues, perhaps because it is the one that he most lacks, could\nsense firm, unshakable, quick-seized determination on the instant.\n\nDuncan McClean acknowledged the fierce-seeming stare with a salute,\nand Ali Partab dismounted instantly. He who holds a trust from such as\nMahommed Gunga is polite in recognition of the trust. He leaned,\nthen, against the horse's withers, wondering how far he ought to let\npoliteness go and whether his honor bade him show contempt for the\nChristian's creed.\n\n\"Is there any way, I wonder,\" asked the Scotsman, the clean-clipped\nsuspicion of Scots dialect betraying itself even through the Hindustanee\nthat he used, \"of getting letters through to some small station?\"\n\n\"I know not,\" said the Rajput.\n\n\"You are a Mohammedan?\" The Scotsman peered at him, adjusting his\nviewpoint to the moon's rays. \"I see you are. A Rajput, too, I think.\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib.\"\n\n\"There was a Rangar here not very long ago.\" This man evidently knew the\nproper title to give a he true believer of the proudest race there is.\nAli Partab's heart began to go out to him--\"an officer, I think, once\nof the Rajput Horse, who very kindly carried letters for me. Perhaps you\nknow of some other gentleman of your race about to travel northward? He\ncould earn, at least, gratitude.\"\n\n\"So-ho!\" thought Ali Partab to himself. \"I have known men of his race\nwho would have offered money, to be spat on!--Not now, sahib,\" he\nanswered aloud.\n\n\"Mahommed Gunga was the officer's name. Do you know him, or know of him,\nby any chance?\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib, I know him well. It is an honor.\"\n\nThe Scotsman smiled. \"He must be very far away by this time. How many\nare there, I wonder, in India who have such things said of them when\ntheir backs are turned?\"\n\n\"More than a few, sahib! I would draw steel for the good name of more\nthan a hundred men whom I know, and there be many others!\"\n\n\"Men of your own race?\"\n\n\"And yours, sahib.\"\n\nThere was no bombast in the man's voice; it was said good-naturedly, as\na man might say, \"There are some friends to whom I would lend money.\"\nNo man with any insight could mistake the truth that underlay the boast.\nThe Scotsman bowed.\n\n\"I am glad, indeed, to have met you. Will you sit down a little while?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib. The hour is late. I was but keeping the blood moving in\nthis horse of mine.\"\n\n\"Well, tell me, since you won't stay, have you any notion who the man\nwas whom Mahommed Gunga sent to get my letters? My daughter handed them\nto him one evening, late, at this door.\"\n\n\"I am he, sahib.\"\n\n\"Then--I understood--perhaps I was mistaken--I thought it was his man\nwho came?\"\n\n\"Praised be Allah, I am his man, sahib!\"\n\n\"Oh! I wonder whether my servants praise God for the privilege!\" McClean\nmade the remark only half-aloud and in English. Ali Partab could not\nhave understood the words, but he may have caught their meaning, for he\nglanced sideways at the old hag mumbling in the shadow and grinned into\nhis beard. \"Are you in communication with him? Could you get a letter to\nhim?\"\n\n\"I have no slightest notion where he is, sahib.\"\n\n\"If my letters could once reach him, wherever he might be, I would feel\nconfident of their arriving at their destination.\"\n\n\"I, too, sahib!\"\n\n\"I sent one letter--to a government official. It cannot have reached\nhim, for there should have been an answer and none has come. It had\nreference to this terrible suttee business. Suttee is against the law\nas well as against all dictates of reason and humanity; yet the Hindoos\nmake a constant practice of it here under our very eyes. These native\nstates are under treaty to observe the law. I intend to do all in my\npower to put a stop to their ghoulish practices, and Maharajah Howrah\nknows what my intentions are. It must be a Mohammedan, this time, to\nwhom I intrust my correspondence on suttee!\"\n\nNow, a Rangar is a man whose ancestors were Hindoos but who\nbecame converts to Islam. Like all proselytes, they adhere more\nenthusiastically to their religion than do the men whose mother creed\nit is; and the fact that the Rangars originally became converts under\nduress is often thrown in their teeth by the Hindoos, who gain nothing\nin the way of brotherly regard in the process. A Rangar hates a Hindoo\nas enthusiastically as he loves a fight. Ali Partab began to drum his\nfingers on his teeth and to exhibit less impatience to be off.\n\n\"There is no knowing, sahib. I, too, am no advocate of superstitious\npractices involving cruelty. I might get a letter through. My commission\nfrom the risaldar-sahib would include all honorable matters not\nobstructive to the main issue. I have certain funds--\"\n\n\"I, too, have funds,\" smiled the missionary.\n\n\"I am not allowed, sahib, to involve myself in any brawl until after my\nbusiness is accomplished. It would be necessary first to assure me on\nthat point. My honor is involved in that matter. To whom, and of what\nnature, would the letter be?\"\n\n\"A letter to the Company's Resident at Abu, reporting to him that Hindoo\nwidows are still compelled in this city to burn themselves to death\nabove their husbands' funeral pyres.\"\n\nThe Rajput grinned. \"Does the Resident sahib not know it, then?\"\n\n\"There will be no chance of his not knowing should my report reach him!\"\n\n\"I will see, sahib, what can be done, then, in the matter. If I can find\na man, I will bring him to you.\"\n\nThe missionary thanked him and stood watching as the Rajput rode away.\nWhen the horseman's free, lean back had vanished in the inky darkness\nhis eyes wandered over to a point where tongues of flame licked upward,\ncasting a dull, dancing, crimson glow on the hot sky. Here and there,\nsilhouetted in the firelight, he could see the pugrees and occasional\nlong poles of men who prodded at the embers. Ululating through the din\nof tom-toms he could catch the wails of women. He shuddered, prayed a\nlittle, and went in.\n\nThat day even the little bazaar fosterlings, whom he had begged, and\ncoaxed, and taught, had all deserted to be present at the burning of\nthree widows. Even the lepers in the tiny hospital that he had started\nhad limped out for a distant view. He had watched a year's work\nall disintegrating in a minute at the call of bestial, loathsome,\nblood-hungry superstition.\n\nAnd he was a man of iron, as Christian missionaries go. He had been\nhard-bitten in his youth and trained in a hard, grim school. In the Isle\nof Skye he had seen the little cabin where his mother lived pulled down\nto make more room for a fifty-thousand-acre deer-forest. He had seen his\nmother beg.\n\nHe had worked his way to Edinburgh, toiled at starvation wages for the\nsake of leave to learn at night, burned midnight oil, and failed at the\nend of it, through ill health, to pass for his degree.\n\nHe had loved as only hard-hammered men can love, and had married after\na struggle the very thought of which would have melted the courage of an\nordinary man, only to see his wife die when her child was born. And even\nthen, in that awful hour, he had not felt the utterness of misery such\nas came to him when he saw that his work in Howrah was undone. He had\ngiven of his best, and all his best, and it seemed that he had given it\nfor nothing.\n\n\"Who was that man, father?\" asked a very weary voice through which\ncourage seemed to live yet, as the tiniest suspicion of a sweet refrain\nstill lives through melancholy bars.\n\n\"The man who took your home letters to Mahommed Gunga.\"\n\n\"And--?\"\n\n\"He has promised to try to find a man for me who will take my report on\nthis awful business to the Resident at Abu.\"\n\n\"Father, listen! Listen, please!\" Rosemary McClean drew a chair for him\nand knelt beside him. Youth saved her face from being drawn as his, but\nthe heat and horror had begun to undermine youth's powers of resistance.\nShe looked more beautiful than ever, but no law lays down that a wraith\nshall be unlovely. She had tried the personal appeal with him a hundred\ntimes, and argument a thousand; now, she used both in a concentrated,\nearnest effort to prevail over his stubborn will. Her will was as strong\nas his, and yielded place to nothing but her sense of loyalty. There\nwere not only Rajputs, as the Rajputs knew, who could be true to a high\nideal. \"I am sure that whoever that man is he must be the link between\nus and the safety Mahommed Gunga spoke of. Otherwise, why does he stay\nbehind? Native officers who have servants take their servants with them,\nas a rule.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Give the word! Let us at least get in touch with safety!\"\n\n\"For myself, no. For you, yes! I have been weak with you, dear. I have\nlet my selfish pleasure in having you near me overcome my sense of\nduty--that, and my faithless fear that you would not be properly\nprovided for. I think, too, that I have never quite induced myself\nto trust natives sufficiently--even native gentlemen. You shall go,\nRosemary. You shall go as soon as I can get word to Mahommed Gunga's\nman. Call that old woman in.\"\n\n\"Father, I will not go without you, and you know it! My place is with\nyou, and I have quite made up my mind. If you stay, I stay! My presence\nhere has saved your life a hundred times over. No, I don't mean just\nwhen you were ill; I mean that they dare not lay a finger on me! They\nknow that a nation which respects their women would strike hard and\nswiftly to avenge a woman of its own! If I were to go away and leave\nyou they would poison you or stab you within a day, and then hold a mock\ntrial and hang some innocent or other to blind the British Government. I\nwould be a murderess if I left you here alone! Come! Come away!\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"It was wrong of me to ever bring you here,\" he said\nsadly. \"But I did not know--I would never have believed.\" Then wrath\ntook hold of him--the awful, cold anger of the Puritan that hates evil\nas a concrete thing, to be ripped apart with steel. \"God's wrath shall\nburst on Howrah!\" he declared. \"Sodom and Gomorrah were no worse!\nRemember what befell them!\"\n\n\"Remember Lot!\" said Rosemary. \"Come away!\"\n\n\"Lot stayed on to the last, and tried to warn them! I will warn the\nResident! Here, give me my writing things--where are they?\"\n\nHe pushed her aside, none too gently, for the fire of a Covenanter's\nanger was blazing in his eyes.\n\n\"There are forty thousand British soldiers standing still, and\nwrong--black, shameful wrong--is being done! For a matter of gold--for\nfear of the cost in filthy lucre--they refrain from hurling wrong-doers\nin the dust! For the sake of dishonorable peace they leave these native\nstates to misgovern themselves and stink to high heaven! Will God allow\nwhat they do? The shame and the sin is on England's head! Her statesmen\nshut their eyes and cry 'Peace, peace!' where there is no peace. Her\nqueen sits idle on the throne while widows burn, screaming, in the\nflames of superstitious priests. Men tell her, 'All is well; there is\nBritish rule in India!' They are too busy robbing widows in the\nIsle of Skye to lend an ear to the cries of India's widows!\nCorruption--superstition--murder--lies--black wrong--black\nselfishness--all growing rank beneath the shadow of the British\nrule--how long will God let that last?\"\n\nHe was pacing up and down like a caged lion, not looking at Rosemary,\nnot speaking to her--speaking to himself, and giving rein to all the\nrankling rage at wrong that wrong had nurtured in him since his boyhood.\nShe knelt still by the chair, her eyes following him as he raged up and\ndown the matted floor. She pitied him more than she did India.\n\nWhen he took the one lamp at last and set it where the light would\nfall above his writing pad, she left the room and went to stand at the\nstreet-door, where the sluggish night air was a degree less stifling\nthan in the mud-plastered, low-ceilinged room. As she stood there, one\nhand on either door-post to remind her she was living in a concrete\nworld, not a charred whisp swaying in the heat, a black thing rose out\nof the blackness, and the toothless hag held out a bony hand and touched\nher.\n\n\"Is it not time yet for the word to go?\" she asked.\n\n\"No. No word yet, Joanna.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\n    Now, God give good going to master o' mine,\n            God speed him, and lead him, and nerve him;\n    God give him a lead of a length in the line,\n            And,--God let him boast that I serve him!\n\nTHE dawn was barely breaking yet when things stirred in the little\nmission house. The flea-bitten gray pony was saddled by a sleepy saice,\nand brought round from his open-sided thatch stable in the rear. The\nviolet and mauve, that precede the aching yellow glare of day were\nfading; a coppersmith began his everlasting bong-bong-bong, apparently\nreverberating from every direction; the last, almost indetectable, warm\nwhiff of night wind moved and died away, and the monkeys in the near-by\nbaobab chattered it a requiem. Almost on the stroke of sunrise Rosemary\nMcClean stepped out--settled her sun-helmet, with a moue above the\nchin-strap that was wasted on flat-bosomed, black grandmotherdom and\nsulky groom--and mounted.\n\nShe needed no help. The pony stood as though he knew that the hot wind\nwould soon dry the life out of him; and, though dark rings beneath dark\neyes betrayed the work of heat and sleepless worry on a girl who should\nhave graced the cool, sweet, rain-swept hills of Scotland, she had\nspirit left yet and an unspent store of youth. The saice seemed more\nweathered than the twenty-year-old girl, for he limped back into the\nsmelly shelter of the servants' quarters to cook his breakfast and\nmumble about dogs and sahibs who prefer the sun.\n\nShe looked shrunk inside the riding-habit--not shrivelled, for she sat\ntoo straight, but as though the cotton jacket had been made for a larger\nwoman. If she seemed tired, and if a stranger might have guessed that\nher head ached until the chestnut curls were too heavy for it, she was\nstill supple. And, as she whipped the pony into an unwilling trot and\nold mission-named Joanna broke into a jog behind, revolt--no longer\nimpatience, or discontent, or sorrow, but reckless rebellion--rode with\nher.\n\nIt was there, plain for the world to see, in the firm lines of a little\nPuritan mouth, in the angle of a high-held chin in the set of a gallant\nlittle pair of shoulders. The pony felt it, and leaned forward to a\ncanter. Joanna scented, smelt, or sensed in some manner known to Eastern\nold age, that purpose was afoot; this was to be no early-morning canter,\nmerely out and home again; there was no time, now, for the customary\ntricks of corner-cutting and rest-snatching under eaves; she tucked her\nhead down and jogged forward in the dust, more like a dog than ever. It\nwas a dog's silent, striving determination to be there when the finish\ncame--a dog's disregard of all object or objective but his master's--but\na long-thrown stride, and a crafty, beady eye that promised more\nusefulness than a dog's when called on.\n\nThe first word spoken was when Rosemary drew rein a little more than\nhalf-way along the palace wall.\n\n\"Are you tired yet, Joanna?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh!\" the woman answered, shaking her head violently and pointing at\nthe sun that mounted every minute higher. The argument was obvious; in\nless than twenty minutes the whole horizon would be shimmering again\nlike shaken plates of brass; wherever the other end might be, a rest\nwould be better there than here! Her mistress nodded, and rode on again,\nfaster yet; she had learned long ago that Joanna could show a dusty\npair of heels to almost anything that ran, and she had never yet\nknown distance tire her; it had been the thought of distance and speed\ncombined that made her pause and ask.\n\nShe did not stop again until they had cantered up through the awakening\nbazaar, where unclean-looking merchants and their underlings rinsed out\ntheir teeth noisily above the gutters, and the pariah dogs had started\nnosing in among the muck for things unthinkable to eat. The sun had\nshortened up the shadows and begun to beat down through the gaps; the\nadvance-guard of the shrivelling hot wind had raised foul dust eddies,\nand the city was ahum when she halted at last beside the big brick arch\nof the caravansary, where Mahommed Gunga's boots and spurs had caught\nher eye once.\n\n\"Now, Joanna!\" She leaned back from the saddle and spoke low, but with\na certain thrill. \"Go in there, find me Mahommed Gunga-sahib's man, and\nbring him out here!\"\n\n\"And if he will not come?\" The old woman seemed half-afraid to enter.\n\n\"Go in, and don't come out without him--unless you want to see me go in\nby myself!\"\n\nThe old woman looked at her piercingly with eyes that gleamed from amid\na bunch of wrinkles, then motioned with a skinny arm in the direction of\nan awning where shade was to be had from the dangerous early sun-rays.\nShe made no move to enter through the arch until her mistress had taken\nshelter.\n\nFifteen minutes later she emerged with Ali Partab, who looked sleepy,\nbut still more ashamed of his unmilitary dishabille. Rosemary McClean\nglanced left and right--forgot about the awning and the custom which\ndecrees aloofness--ignored the old woman's waving arm and Ali Partab's\nfrown, and rode toward him eagerly.\n\n\"Did Mahommed Gunga-sahib leave you here with any orders relative to\nme?\" she asked.\n\nThe Rajput bowed.\n\n\"Before he went away, he spoke to me of safety, and told me he would\nleave a link between me and men whom I may trust.\"\n\nThe Rajput bowed again. Neither of them saw an elbow laid on the\nwindow-ledge of a room above the arch; it disappeared, and very gingerly\na bared black head replaced it. Then the head too disappeared.\n\nThe girl's eyes sparkled as the reassurance came that at least one good\nfighting man was waiting to do nothing but assist her. For the moment\nshe threw caution to the winds and remembered nothing but her plight and\nher father's stubbornness.\n\n\"My father will not come away, but--\"\n\nAli Partab's eyes betrayed no trace of concern.\n\n\"But--I thought--Are you all alone?\"\n\n\"All alone, Miss-sahib, but your servant.\"\n\n\"Oh! I thought--perhaps that\"--she checked herself, then rushed the\nwords out as though ashamed of them--\"that, if you had men to help you,\nyou might carry him away against his will! Where are these others who\nare to be trusted?\"\n\nAli Partab grinned and then drew himself up with a movement of polite\ndissent. It was not for him to question the suggestions of a Miss-sahib;\nhe conveyed that much with an inimitable air. But it was his business to\nkeep strictly to the letter of his orders.\n\n\"Miss-sahib, I cannot do that. So said Mahommed Gunga: 'When the hag\nbrings word, then take three horses and bear the Miss-sahib and her\nfather to my cousin Alwa's place.' I stand ready to obey, but the\npadre-sahib comes not against his will.\"\n\n\"To whose place?\"\n\n\"Alwa's, Miss-sahib.\"\n\n\"And who is he?\" She seemed bewildered. \"I had hoped to be escorted to\nsome British residency.\"\n\n\"That would be for Alwa, should he see fit. He has men and horses, and\na fort that is impregnable. The Miss-sahib would be safe there under all\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"But--but, supposing I declined to accept that invitation? Supposing I\npreferred not to be carried off to a--er--a Mohammedan gentleman's fort.\nWhat then?\"\n\n\"I could but wait here, Miss-sahib, until the hour came when you\nchanged your mind, or until Mahommed Gunga by letter or by word of mouth\nrelieved me of my trust.\"\n\n\"Oh! Then you will wait here until I ask?\"\n\n\"Surely, Miss-sahib.\"\n\nThe head again peered through the window up above them, but disappeared\nbelow the ledge furtively, and none of the three were aware of it.\nFor that matter, the old woman was gazing intently at Ali Partab and\nlistening eagerly; he stood almost underneath the arch, and Miss McClean\nwas staring at him frowning with the effort to translate her thoughts\ninto a language that is very far from easy. They would none of them have\nseen the roof descending on them.\n\n\"And--and won't you under any circumstances take us, say, to the\nResident at Abu instead?\"\n\n\"I may not, Miss-sahib.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Of a truth I know not. I never yet knew Mahommed Gunga to give an order\nwithout good reason for it; but beyond that he chose me, because he said\nthe task might prove difficult and he trusted me, I know nothing.\"\n\n\"Have you no idea of the reason?\"\n\n\"Miss-sahib, I am a soldier. To me an order is an order to be carried\nout; suspicions, fears are nothing unless they stand in the way of\naccomplishment. I await your word. I am ready. The horses are here--good\nhorses--lean and hard. The order is that you must ask me.\"\n\n\"Thank you--er--Ali what?--thank you, Ali Partab.\" The disappointment in\nher voice was scarcely more noticeable than the despondency her drooping\nfigure showed. The little shoulders that had sat so square and gallantly\nseemed to have lost their strength, and there was none of the determined\nring left in the words she hesitated for. \"I--hope you will understand\nthat I am grateful--but--I cannot--er--see my way just yet to--\"\n\n\"In your good time, Miss-sahib. I was ordered to have patience!\"\n\n\"At least I will have more confidence, knowing that you are always close\nat hand.\"\n\nThe Rajput bowed. She reined back. He saluted, and she bowed again;\nthen, with a glance to make sure that Joanna followed, she started back\nat little more than a walking pace--a dejected wraith of a girl on a\ndejected-looking pony, too overcome by the upsetting of her rebellious\nscheme to care or even think whether Joanna dropped out of sight or\nnot. Ali Partab watched her down the street with a face that betrayed no\nemotion and no suspicion of what his thoughts might be. When she was out\nof sight he went back under the arch to attend to his three horses;\nand the moment that he did so a fat but very furtive Hindoo took his\nplace--glanced down the street once in the direction that Rosemary had\ntaken--and then darted up-street as fast as his shaking paunch would\nlet him. He had been gone at the least ten minutes, when Joanna, also\nfurtive, also in a hurry, dodged here and there among the commencing\nsurge of traffic and approached the arch again.\n\nIt would be useless to try to read her mind, or to translate the glitter\nof her beady eyes into thoughts intelligible to any but an Oriental.\nIt was quite clear, though, that she wished not to be noticed, that she\nfeared the occupants of the caravansary, and that she had returned for\nword with Ali Partab. He, least of all, would have doubted her intention\nof demanding the two gold mohurs, for it was she who had brought the\nword that Miss McClean wanted him. But what relation that intention\nhad to her loyalty or treachery, or whether she were capable of\neither--capable of anything except greed, and obedience for the sake of\npay--were problems no man living could have guessed.\n\nShe asked the lounging sweeper by the arch whether Ali Partab had ridden\nout as yet. He jeered back outrageous improprieties, suggestive of\nimpossible ambition on the hag's part. She called him \"sahib,\" dubbed\nhim \"father of a dozen stalwart sons,\" returned a few of his immodest\ncompliments with a flattering laugh, and learned that Ali Partab was\nstill busy in the caravansary. Then she proceeded to make herself\nvery inconspicuous beside a two-wheeled wagon, up-ended in the gutter\nopposite the arch, and waited with eastern patience for the horseman to\nride out.\n\nShe saw the fat Hindoo come back, in no particular hurry now, and seat\nhimself not far from her. Later she saw eight horsemen ride down the\nstreet, pass the arch, wheel, and halt. She noticed that they were\nnot Maharajah Howrah's men but a portion of his brother Jaimihr's\nbody-guard, then took no further notice of them. If they chose to wait\nthere, it was no affair of hers, and to appear inquisitive would be to\ninvite a lance-butt, very shrewdly thrust where it would hurt.\n\nIt was an hour at least before Ali Partab rode out through the arch,\nlooking down anxiously at his horse's off-hind that had been showing\nsymptoms of \"brushing\" lately. Joanna rose instantly to cross the street\nand intercept him; and she recoiled in the nick of time to save herself\nfrom being ridden down.\n\nAt a sign from the fat Hindoo the eight horsemen spurred, and swooped\nup-street with the speed and certainty of sparrow-hawks and the noise of\ndevastation. They rode down Ali Partab--unhorsed him--bound him--threw\nhim on his horse again--and galloped off before any but the Hindoo had\ntime to realize that he was their objective. He was gone--snatched\nlike a chicken from the coop. Noise and dust were all the trace or\nexplanation that he left. The mazy streets swallowed him; the Hindoo\nwaddled over to the arch and disappeared without a smile on his face to\nshow even interest. The interrupted trading and bartering went on again,\nand no one commented or made a move to follow but Joanna.\n\nShe watched the fat Hindoo, and made sure that she would recognize him\nanywhere again. Then, by a trail that no one would have guessed at and\nfew could have followed, she made her way to Jaimihr's palace--three\nmiles away from Howrah's--where a dozen sulky-looking sepoys lolled,\ndismounted, by the wooden gate. There was neither sight nor sound of\nmounted men, and the gate was shut; but in the middle of the roadway\nthere was smoking dung, and there was a suspicion of overacting about\nthe indifference of the guardians of the entrance.\n\nThere was no overacting, though, in what Joanna did. Nobody would have\ndreamed that she was playing any kind of part, or interested in anything\nat all except the coppers that she begged for. She squatted in\nthe roadway, ink-black and clear-cut in the now blazing sunlight,\nalternately flattering them and pretending to a knowledge of\nunguessed-at witchcraft.\n\nShe was there still at midday when they changed the guard. She was\nthere when night fell, still squatting in the roadway, still exchanging\nrepartee and hints at the supernatural with armed men who shuddered now\nand then between their bursts of mockery. The sore, suffering dogs that\nsniff through the night for worse eyesores than themselves whimpered and\nwatched her. The guard changed and the moon paled, but she stayed\non; and whatever her purpose, or whatever information she obtained in\nfragments amid the raillery, she did not return to the mission house.\n\nIt was not until Rosemary McClean returned and dismounted by the door\nthat she realized Joanna had not kept pace. Even then she thought little\nof it; the old woman often lingered on the homeward way when the chance\nof her being needed was remote. Two or three hours passed before the\nsuspicion rose that anything might have happened to Joanna, and even\nthen she might not have been remembered had not Duncan McClean asked for\nher.\n\n\"I have changed my mind,\" he said, calling Rosemary into the long, low\nliving-room. It was darkened to exclude the hot wind and the glare, and\nhe looked like a ghost as he rose to meet her. \"I have decided that my\nduty is to get away from this place for your sake and for the sake of\nthe cause I have at heart. We are doing no good here. I can do most by\ngoing to the Resident, or even to somebody higher up than he, and laying\nmy case before him personally. Send for Joanna, and tell her to go and\nbring Mahommed Gunga's man.\"\n\nIt was then that they missed Joanna and began to search for her. But no\nJoanna came. It was then that Rosemary McClean rehearsed with her father\nher former conversation with Mahommed Gunga and part, at least, of her\nrecent one with Ali Partab, and the missionary started off himself to\nfind the horseman whom Mahommed Gunga had so thoughtfully left behind.\n\nBut he very naturally found no Ali Partab. What he did discover was that\nhe was followed--that a guard, unarmed but obvious, was placed around\nthe mission house--that his servants deserted one by one--that no more\nchildren came to the mission school.\n\nHe decided to take chances and ride off with his daughter in the night.\nBut the ponies went mysteriously lame, and nobody would lend or sell him\nhorses on any terms at all. He did his best to get a letter through to\nanywhere where there were British, but nobody would take it. And then\nJaimihr came, swaggering with his escort, to offer him and his daughter\nthe hospitality of his palace.\n\nHe declined that offer a little testily, for the insolence behind the\noffer was less than half concealed. Jaimihr sneered as he rode away.\n\n\"Perhaps a month or two of undisturbed enjoyment will induce the\npadre-sahib to change his mind about my invitation!\" he said nastily.\nAnd he made no secret then, as he ordered them about before he went,\nthat the men who lounged and watched at every vantage-point were his.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\n    They looked into my eyes and laughed,--\n            But, what when I was gone?\n    Have strong men made me one of them?\n            Or do I ride alone?\n\nON the morning after Mahommed Gunga's daring experiment with\nCunningham's nervous system he was anxious to say the least of it; and\nthat is only another way of saying that he was irritable. He watched the\nEnglishman at breakfast, on the dak-bungalow veranda, with a sideways\nrestless glance that gave the lie a dozen times over to his assumed air\nof irascible authority.\n\n\"We will see now what we will see,\" he muttered to himself. \"These who\nknow such a lot imagine that the test is made. They forget that there\nbe many brave men of whom but a few are fit to lead. Now--now--we will\nsee!\" And he kept on repeating that assurance to himself, with the\nair of a man who would like to be assured, but is not, while he\nostentatiously found fault with every single thing on which his eyes\nlit.\n\n\"One would think that the Risaldar-sahib were afraid of consequences!\"\nwhispered the youngest of his followers, stung to the quick by a quite\nunmerited rebuke. \"Does he fear that Chota-Cunnigan will beat him?\"\n\nWhite men have been known--often--to do stupider things than that,\nand particularly young white men who have not yet learned to gauge\nproportions accurately; so there was nothing really ridiculous in the\nsuggestion. A young white man who has had his temper worked up to\nthe boiling-point, his nerves deliberately racked, and then has been\nsubjected to the visit of a driven tiger, may be confidently expected to\nexhibit all the faults of which his character is capable.\n\nTo make the situation even more ticklish, Cunningham's servant, in\nhis zeal for his master's comfort, had forgotten to sham sickness, and\ninstead of limping was in abominably active evidence. He was even doing\nmore than was expected of him. Ralph Cunningham had said nothing to\nhim--had not needed to; every single thing that a pampered sahib could\nimagine that he needed was done for him in the proper order, without\nnoise or awkwardness, and the Risaldar cursed as he watched the\nclockwork-perfect service. He had hoped for a lapse that might call\nforth some pointer, either by way of irritation or amusement, as to how\nyoung Cunningham was taking things.\n\nBut not a thing went wrong and not a sign of any sort gave Cunningham.\nThe youngster did not smile either to himself darkly or at his servant.\nHe lit his after-breakfast cigar and smoked it peacefully, as though he\nhad spent an absolutely normal night, without even a dream to worry him,\nand if he eyed Mahommed Gunga at all, he did it so naturally, and with\nso little interest, that no deductions could be drawn from it. He was\nneither more nor less than a sahib at his ease--which was disconcerting,\nvery, to the Oriental mind.\n\nHe smoked the cigar to a finish, without a word or sign that he wished\nto give audience. Then his eyes lit for the first time on the tiger-skin\nthat was pegged out tight, raw side upward, for the sun to sterilize;\nhe threw the butt of his cigar away and strolled out to examine the skin\nwithout a sign to Mahommed Gunga, counted the claws one by one to\nmake sure that no superstitious native had purloined any of them, and\nreturned to his chair on the veranda without a word.\n\n\"Is he vindictive, then?\" wondered Mahommed Gunga. \"Is he a mean man?\nWill he bear malice and get even with me later on? If so--\"\n\n\"Present my compliments to Mahommed Gunga-sahib, and ask him to be good\nenough to--\"\n\nThe Risaldar heard the order, and was on his way to the veranda before\nthe servant started to convey the message. He took no chances on a\nreprimand about his shoes, for he swaggered up in riding-boots, which\nno soldier can be asked to take off before he treads on a private floor;\nand he saluted as a soldier, all dignity. It was the only way by which\nhe could be sure to keep the muscles of his face from telling tales.\n\n\"Huzoor?\"\n\n\"Morning, Mahommed Gunga. Take a seat, won't you?\"\n\nA camp-chair creaked under the descending Rajput's weight, and creaked\nagain as he remembered to settle himself less stiffly--less guiltily.\n\n\"I say, I'm going to ask you chaps to do me a favor. You don't mind\nobliging me now and then, do you?\"\n\nThe youngster leaned forward confidentially, one elbow on his knee, and\nlooked half-serious, as though what he had to ask were more important\nthan the ordinary.\n\n\"Sahib, there is nothing that we will not do.\"\n\n\"Ah! Then you won't mind my mentioning this, I'm sure. Next time you\nwant to kennel a tiger in my bedroom, d'you mind giving me notice in\nadvance? It's not the stink I mind, nor being waked up; it's the deuced\nawful risk of hurting somebody. Besides--look how I spoilt that tiger's\nmask! The skins I've always admired at home had been shot where it\ndidn't show so badly.\"\n\nThere was not even the symptom of a smile on Cunningham's face. He\nlooked straight into Mahommed Gunga's eyes, and spoke as one man talking\ncalm common sense to another. He raised his hand as the Rajput began to\nstammer an apology.\n\n\"No. Don't apologize. If you'll forgive me for shooting your pet tiger,\nI'll overlook the rest of it. If I'd known that you kept him in there\no' nights, I'd have chosen another room, that's all--some room where\nI couldn't smell him, and where I shouldn't run the risk of killing an\ninoffensive man. Why, I might have shot you! Think how sorry I'd have\nbeen!\"\n\nThe Risaldar did not quite know what to say; so, wiser than most, he\nsaid nothing.\n\n\"Oh, and one other matter. I don't speak much of the language yet, so,\nwould you mind translating to my servant that the next time he goes sick\nwithout giving me notice, and without putting oil in my lamp, I'll have\nhim fed to the tiger before he's brought into my room? Just tell him\nthat quietly, will you? Say it slowly so that it sinks in. Thanks.\"\n\nStraight-faced as Cunningham himself, the Risaldar tongue-lashed\nthe servant with harsh, tooth-rasping words that brought him up to\nattention. Whether he interpreted or not the exact meaning of what\nCunningham had said, he at least produced the desired effect;\nthe servant mumbled apologetic nothings and slunk off the veranda\nbackward--to go away and hold his sides with laughter at the back of the\ndak-bungalow. There Mahommed Gunga found him afterward and administered\na thrashing--not, as he was careful to explain, for disobedience, but\nfor having dared to be amused at the Risaldar's discomfiture.\n\nBut there was still one point that weighed heavily on Mahommed Gunga's\nmind as the servant shuffled off and left him alone face to face with\nCunningham. There is as a very general rule not more than one man-eating\ntiger in a neighborhood, and not even the greenest specimen of subaltern\nnew brought from home would be likely to mistake one for the other kind.\nThe man-eater was dead, and there was an engagement to shoot one that\nvery morning. He hesitated--said nothing for the moment--and wondered\nwhether his best course would be to go ahead and pretend to beat out the\njungle and tell some lie or other about the tiger having got away. But\nRalph Cunningham, with serious gray eyes fixed full on his, saved him\nthe trouble of deciding.\n\n\"If it's all one to you, Mahommed Gunga,\" he said, the corner of his\nmouth just flickering, \"we'll move on from here at once. This is a\nbeastly old bungalow to sleep in, and shooting tigers don't seem so\nterribly exciting to me. Besides, the climate here must be rotten for\nthe horses.\"\n\n\"As you wish, sahib.\"\n\n\"Very well--if the choice rests with me, I wish it. It might--ah--save\nthe villagers a lot of hard work beating through the jungle, mightn't\nit--besides, there'll be other tigers on the road.\"\n\n\"Innumerable tigers, sahib.\"\n\n\"Good. Will you order a start then?\"\n\nThe Risaldar departed round the corner of the bungalow, and a minute or\ntwo later Cunningham's ears caught the sound of a riding-switch, lustily\napplied, and of muffled groans. He suspected readily enough what was\ngoing on, particularly since his servant was not in evidence, but he\ndared not laugh on the veranda. He went inside, and made believe to be\nbusy with his bag before he relaxed the muscles of his face.\n\n\"Now, I wonder whether I handled that situation rightly?\" he asked\nhimself between chuckles. \"One thing I know--if that old ruffian plays\nanother trick on me--one more of any kind--Ill show my teeth. There's a\nthing known as the limit!\"\n\nHe would not have wondered, though, if he could have overheard Mahommed\nGunga less than an hour later. The Risaldar had stayed behind to make\nsure nothing had been forgotten, and one of his men remained with him.\n\n\"There be sahibs and then sahibs,\" said Mahommed Gunga. \"Two kinds are\nthe worst--those who strike readily in anger and use bad language when\nannoyed, and those whose lips are thin and who save their vengeance to\nbe wreaked later on. They are worse, either of them, than the sahib who\nis usually drunk.\"\n\n\"And Cunnigan?\"\n\n\"Is altogether otherwise. As his father was, and as a few other sahibs I\nhave met, he understands what is not spoken--concedes dignity to him who\nis caught napping, as one who having disarmed his adversary, allows him\nto recover his weapon--and--\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"Proves himself a man worth following! I myself will slit the throat of\nany man I catch disparaging the name of Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur! By\nthe blood of God--by my medals, my own honor, and the good name of\nPukka-Cunnigan, his father, I swear it!\"\n\n\"Rung Ho!\" grinned the six-foot son of war who, rode beside him.\n\nThey rode on at a walk past the tombstone that--at Mahommed Gunga's\norders--the villagers had decked with sickly scented forest flowers, and\nas they passed they both saluted it in silence. The fakir of the night\nbefore, sitting not very far away from it, mimicked them. He sprang on\nthe stone as soon as they were out of sight, scattering the flowers all\nabout him, and calling down the vengeance of a hundred gods on the heads\nof Christian and Mohammedan alike.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\n    From lone hunt came the yearling cub\n            And brought a grown kill back;\n    With fangs aglut \"'Tis nothing but\n            Presumption!\" growled the pack.\n\nRALPH CUNNINGHAM reached Peshawur at last with no less than nine tigers\nto his gun, and that in itself would have been sufficient to damn him in\nthe eyes of more than half of the men who held commands there. Jealousy\nin those days of slow promotion and intrenched influence had eaten\ninto the very understanding of men whose only excuse for rule over a\nconquered people ought to have been understanding.\n\nIt was not considered decent for a boy of twenty-one to do much more\nthan dare to be alive. For any man at all to offer advice or information\nto his senior was rank presumption. Criticism was high treason. Sport,\nsuch as tiger-shooting, was for those whose age and apoplectic temper\nrendered them least fitted for it. Conservatism reigned: \"High Toryism,\nsir, old port, and proud Prerogative!\"\n\nMahommed Gunga grinned into his beard at the reception that awaited the\nyoungster whom he had trained for months now in the belief that India\nhad nothing much to do except reverence him. He laughed aloud, when he\ncould get away to do it, at the flush of indignation on his protege's\nface. Tall, lean-limbed, full of health and spirits, he had paid his\nduty call on a General of Division; with the boyish enthusiasm that says\nso plainly, \"Laugh with me, for the world is mine!\" he had boasted\nhis good luck on the road, only to be snubbed thoroughly and told that\ntiger-shooting was not what he came for.\n\nHe took the snub like a man and made no complaint to anybody; he did\nnot even mention it to the other subalterns, who, most of them, made no\nsecret of their dissatisfaction and its hundred causes. He listened,\nand it was not very long before it dawned on him that, had not Mahommed\nGunga gone with him to pay a call as well, the General Division would\nnot have so much as interviewed him.\n\nMahommed Gunga soon became the bane of his existence. The veteran seemed\nin no hurry to go back to his estate that must have been in serious need\nof management by this time, but would ride off on mysterious errands and\nreturn with a dozen or more black-bearded horsemen each time. He would\nintroduce them to Cunningham in public whenever possible under the eyes\nof outraged seniors who would swear and, fume and ride away disgust\nat the reverence paid to \"a mere boy, sir--a bally, ignorant young\njackanapes!\"\n\nHad Cunningham been other than a born soldier with his soldier senses\nall on edge and sleepless, he would have fallen foul of disgrace within\na month. He was unattached as yet, and that fact gave opportunity to\nthe men who looked for it to try to \"take the conceit out of the cub, by\ngad.\"\n\n\"They \"--everybody spoke of them as \"they\"--conceived the brilliant idea\nof confronting the youngster with conditions which he lacked experience\nto cope with. They set him to deal with circumstances which had long\nago proved too difficult for themselves, and awaited confidently the\noutcome--the crass mistake, or oversight, or mere misfortune that, with\nthe aid of a possible court martial, would reduce him to a proper state\nof humbleness.\n\nPeshawur, the greatest garrison in northern India, was there on\nsufferance, apparently. For lack of energetic men in authority to deal\nwith them, the border robbers plundered while the troops remained cooped\nup within the unhealthiest station on the list. The government itself,\nwith several thousand troops to back it up, was paying blackmail to the\nborder thieves! There was not a government bungalow in all Peshawur that\ndid not have its \"watchman,\" hired from over the border, well paid to\nsleep on the veranda lest his friends should come and take tribute in an\neven more unseemly manner.\n\nThe younger men, whose sense of fitness had not yet been rotted by\nclimate and system and prerogative, swore at the condition; there were\none or two men higher up, destined to make history, whose voices, raised\nin emphatic protest, were drowned in the drone of \"Peace! Peace is the\nthing to work for. Compromise, consideration, courtesy, these three are\nthe keys of rule.\" They failed to realize that cowardice was their\nreal keynote, and that the threefold method that they vaunted was quite\nuseless without a stiffening of courage.\n\nSo brave men, who had more courtesy in each of their fingers than\nmost of the seniors had all put together, had to bow to a scandalous\ncondition that made England's rule a laughing-stock within a stone's\nthrow of the city limits. And they had to submit to the indecency of\nseeing a new, inexperienced arrival picked for the task of commanding a\nbody of irregulars, for no other reason than because it was considered\nwise to make an exhibition of him.\n\nCunningham became half policeman, half soldier, in charge of a small\nspecial force of mounted men engaged for the purpose of patrol. He had\nnothing to do with the selection of them; that business was attended\nto perfunctorily by a man very high up in departmental service, who\nconsidered Cunningham a nuisance. He was a gentleman who did not know\nMahommed Gunga; another thing he did not know was the comfortable feel\nof work well done; so he was more than pleased when Mahommed Gunga\ndropped in from nowhere in particular--paid him scandalously untrue\ncompliments without a blush or a smile and offered to produce the\nrequired number of men at once.\n\nOnly fifty were required. Mahommed Gunga brought three hundred to select\nfrom, and, when asked to do so in order to save time and trouble, picked\nout the fifty best.\n\n\"There are your men!\" said the Personage off-handedly, when they had\nbeen sworn in in a group. \"Be good enough to remember, Mr. Cunningham,\nthat you are now responsible for their behavior, and for the proper\nnight patrolling of the city limits.\"\n\nThat was a tall order, and in spite of all of youth's enthusiasm was\nenough to make any young fellow nervous. But Mahommed Gunga met him in\nthe street, saluted him with almost sacrilegious ceremony, and drew him\nto one side.\n\n\"Have courage, now, bahadur! I ride away to visit my estates (he spoke\nof them always in the plural, as though he owned a county or two). You\nhave under you the best eyes and the keenest blades along the border for\nI attended to it! Be ruthless! Use them, work them--sweat them to death!\nKeep away from messes and parades; seek no praise, for you will get none\nin any case! Work! Work for what is coming!\"\n\n\"You speak as though the fate of a continent were hanging in the\nbalance,\" laughed Cunningham, shaking hands with him.\n\n\"I speak truth!\" said Mahommed Gunga, riding off and leaving the\nyoungster wondering.\n\nNow, there was nothing much the matter with the men on either side,\ntaken in the main, who hated one another on that far-pushed frontier.\nEven the insufferable incompetents who held the rotting reins of control\nwere such because circumstance had blinded them. There was not a man\namong the highly placed ones even who would have deliberately placed his\nown importance or his own opinion in the scale against India's welfare.\nThere was not a border thief but was ready to respect what he could\nrecognize as strong-armed justice.\n\nThe root of the trouble lay in centralization of authority, and rigid\nadherence to the rule of seniority. Combined, these two processes had\nserved to bring about a state of things that is nearly unbelievable when\nviewed in the light of modern love for efficiency. Young men, with the\nfire of ambition burning in them and a proper scorn for mere superficial\nceremony, had to sweat their tempers and bow down beneath the yoke of\nsenile pompousness.\n\nStrong, savage, powder-weaned Hill-tribesmen--inheritors of egoistic\nindependence and a love of loot--laughed loud and long and openly at\nSystem that prevented officers from taking arms against them until\nauthority could come by delegate from somebody who slept. By that time\nthey would be across the border, quarrelling among themselves about\ndivision of the plunder!\n\nThey had respect in plenty for the youth and virile middle age that\ndealt with them on the rare occasions when a timely blow was loosed.\nThen they had proof that from that strange, mad country overseas there\ncame men who could lead men--men who could strike, and who knew enough\nto hold their hands when the sudden blow had told--just men, who could\nkeep their plighted word. No border thief pretended that the British\ncould not rule him; to a man, they laughed because the possible was not\nimposed. And to the last bold, ruffianly iconoclast they stole when,\nwhere, and what they dared.\n\nThings altered strangely soon after Ralph Cunningham, with the\ndiffidence of youth but the blood of a line of soldiers leaping in\nhim, took charge of his tiny force of nondescripts. They were neither\nsoldiers nor police. Nominally, he was everybody's dog, and so were\nthey; actually he found himself at the head of a tiny department of\nhis own, because it was nobody's affair to give him orders. They had\ndeliberately turned him loose \"to hang himself,\" and their hope that he\nmight get his head into a noose of trouble as soon as possible--the very\nliberty they gave him, on purpose for his quick damnation--was the means\nof making reputation for him.\n\nNobody advised him; so with singularly British phlegm and not more\nthan ordinary common sense he devised a method of his own for scotching\nnight-prowlers. He stationed his men at well-considered vantage-points,\nand trusted them. With a party of ten, he patrolled the city ceaselessly\nhimself and whipped every \"watchman\" he caught sleeping. One by one, the\nblackmailing brigade began to see the discomfort of a job that called\nfor real wakefulness, and deserted over the Hills to urge the resumption\nof raids in force. One by one, the night-prowling fraternity were\nshot as they sneaked past sentries. One by one, the tale of robberies\ndiminished. It was merely a question of one man, and he awake,\nhaving power to act without first submitting a request to somebody in\ntriplicate on blue-form B.\n\nThe time came, after a month or two, when even natives dared to leave\ntheir houses after dark. The time came very soon, indeed, when the\nnearest tribes began to hold war councils and inveigh against the\nfalling off of the supply of plunder. Cunningham was complimented\nopenly. He was even praised by one of \"Them.\" So it was perfectly\nnatural, and quite in keeping with tradition, that he should shortly\nbe relieved, and that a senior to him should be placed in charge of his\nlittle force, with orders to \"organize\" it.\n\nThe organization process lasted about twelve hours; at the end of that\ntime every single man had deserted, horse and arms! Two nights later,\nthe prowling and plundering was once more in full swing, and Cunningham\nwas blamed for it; it was obvious to any man of curry-and-port-wine\nproclivities that his method, or lack of it, had completely undermined\nhis men's loyalty!\n\nA whole committee of gray-headed gentlemen took trouble to point out\nto him his utter failure; but a brigadier, who was not a member of that\ncommittee, and who was considered something of an upstart, asked that\nhe might be appointed to a troop of irregular cavalry that had recently\nbeen raised. With glee--with a sigh of relief so heartfelt and unanimous\nthat it could be heard across the street--the committee leaped at the\nsuggestion. The proper person was induced without difficulty to put\nhis signature to the required paper, and Cunningham found himself\ntransferred to irregular oblivion. Incidentally he found himself\ncommanding few less than a hundred men, so many of whose first names\nwere Mahommed or Mohammed that the muster-roll looked like a list of\nAllah's prophets.\n\nCunningham was more than a little bit astonished, on the day he joined,\nin camp, a long way from Peshawur, to find his friend Mahommed Gunga,\nseated in a bell tent with the Brigadier. He caught sight of the long\nblack military boot and silver spur, and half-recognized the up-and-down\nmovement of the crossed leg long before he reached the tent. It was\nlike father and son meeting, almost, as the Rajput rose to greet him\nand waited respectfully until he had paid his compliments to his new\ncommander. Cunningham felt throat-bound, and could scarcely more than\nstammer his introduction of himself.\n\n\"I know who you are and all about you,\" said the Brigadier. \"Used to\nknow your father well. I applied to have you in my command partly for\nyour father's sake, but principally because Risaldar Mahommed Gunga\nspake so highly of you. He tells me he has had an eye on you from the\nstart, and that you shape well. Remember, this is irregular cavalry, and\nin many respects quite unlike regulars. You'll need tact and a firm hand\ncombined, and you mustn't ever forget that the men whom you will lead\nare gentlemen.\"\n\nCunningham reported to his Colonel, only to discover that he, too, knew\nall about him. The Colonel was less inclined to be restricted as to\ntopic, and less mindful of discretion than the Brigadier.\n\n\"I hear they couldn't stand you in Peshawur. That's hopeful! If you'd\ncome with a recommendation from that quarter, I'd have packed you off\nback again. I never in my life would have believed that a dozen men\ncould all shut their eyes so tightly to the signs--never!\"\n\n\"The signs, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, the signs! Come and look your troop over.\"\n\nCunningham found that the troop, too, had heard about his coming. He\ndid not look them over. When he reached the lines, they came out in a\nswarm--passed him one by one, eyed him, as traders eye a horse--and then\nsaluted him a second time, with the greeting:\n\n\"Salaam, Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur!\"\n\n\"Yes! You're in disgrace!\" said his Colonel, noticing the color rising\nto the youngster's cheeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\n    Sons of the sons of war we be,\n    Sabred and horsed, and whole and free;\n    One is the caste, and one degree,--\n            One law,--one code decreed us.\n    Who heads wolves in the dawning day?\n    Who leaps in when the bull's at bay?\n    He who dare is he who may!\n            Now, rede ye who shall lead us!\n\nTHE check that Ralph Cunningham's management of his police had caused,\nand the subsequent resumption of night looting, served to whet the\nappetites of the hungry crowd beyond the border. Those closest to\nPeshawur, who had always done the looting, were not the ultimate\nconsignees by any means; there were other tribes who bought from\nthem--others yet to whom they paid tribute in the shape of stolen\nrifles. Cunningham's administration had upset the whole modus vivendi of\nthe lower Himalayas!\n\nThough it all began again the moment he was superseded, there had been,\nnone the less, a three-month interregnum, and that had to be compensated\nfor. The tribes at the rear were clamorous and would not listen to\nargument or explanation; they had collected in hundreds, led by the\nnotorious Khumel Khan, preparatory to raiding in real earnest and with\nsufficient force to carry all before them at the first surprise attack.\n\nThey were disappointed when the pilfering resumed, for a tribal Hillman\nwould generally rather fight than eat, and would always prefer his\ndinner from a dead enemy's cooking-pot. They sat about for a long time,\nconsidering whether there were not excuse enough for war in any case\nand listening to the intricately detailed information brought by the\ndeserting watchmen. And as they discussed things, but before they had\ntime to decide on any plan, the Brigadier commanding the Irregulars got\nwind of them.\n\nHe was a man who did not worry about the feelings of senile heads of\nred-tape-bound departments; nor was he particularly hidebound by respect\nfor the laws of evidence. When he knew a thing, he knew it; then he\neither acted or did not act, as the circumstances might dictate. And\nwhen the deed was done or left undone, and was quite beyond the reach of\ncriticism, he would send in a verbose, voluminous report, written out in\nseveral colored inks, on all the special forms he could get hold of. The\nheads of departments would be too busy for the next twelvemonth trying\nto get the form of the report straightened out to be able to give any\nattention to the details of it; and then it would be too late. But he\nwas a brigadier, and what he could do with impunity and quiet amusement\nwould have brought down the whole Anglo-Indian Government in awful wrath\non the head of a subordinate.\n\nHe heard of the tribesmen under Khumel Khan one evening. At dawn his\ntents stood empty and the horse-lines were long bands of brown on the\ngreen grass. The pegs were up; only the burying beetles labored where\nthe stamping chargers had neighed overnight.\n\nThe hunger-making wind that sweeps down, snow-sweetened, from the\nHimalayas bore with it intermittent thunder from four thousand hoofs\nas, split in three and swooping from three different directions, the\nsquadrons viewed, gave tongue, and launched themselves, roaring, at the\nhalf-awakened plotters of the night before.\n\nThere was a battle, of a kind, in a bowlder-lined valley where the early\nmorning sun had not yet reached to lift the chill. Long lances--devils'\nantennae--searched out the crevices where rock-bred mountain-men sought\ncover; too suddenly for clumsy-fingered Hillmen to reload, the reformed\ntroops charged wedgewise into rallying detachments. In an hour, or less,\nthere were prisoners being herded like cattle in the valley bottom, and\na sting had been drawn from the border wasp that would not grow again\nfor a year or two to come.\n\nBut Khumel Khan was missing. Khumel Khan, the tulwar man--he whose boast\nit was that he could hew through two men's necks at one whistling sweep\nof his notched, curved cimeter--had broken through with a dozen at his\nback. He had burst through the half-troop guarding the upper end of\nthe defile, had left them red and reeling to count their dead, and the\noverfolding hill-spurs swallowed him.\n\n\"Mr. Cunningham! Take your troop, please, and find their chief! Hunt him\nout, ride him down, and get him! Don't come back until you do!\"\n\nThe real thing! The real red thing within a year! A lone\ncommand--and that is the only thing a subaltern of spunk may pray\nfor!--eighty-and-eight hawk-eyed troopers asking only for the\nopportunity to show their worth--lean, hungry hills to hunt in, no\ncommissariat, fair law to the quarry, and a fight--as sure as God made\nmountains, a fight at the other end! There are men here and there who\nthink that the day when they pass down a crowded aisle with Her is the\ngreat one, other great days are all as gas-jets to the sun. And there\nare others. There are men, like Cunningham, who have heard the drumming\nof the hoofs behind them as they led their first un-apron-stringed unit\nout into the unknown. The one kind of man has tasted honey, but the\nother knows what fed, and feeds, the roaring sportsmen in Valhalla.\n\nThere were crisscross trails, where low-hung clouds swept curtainwise to\nmake the compass seem like a lie-begotten trick. There were\ngorges, hewn when the Titans needed dirt to build the awful\nHimalayas--shadow-darkened--sheer as the edge of Nemesis. Long-reaching,\npile on pile, the over-lapping spurs leaned over them. The wind blew\nthrough them amid silence that swallowed and made nothing of the din\nwhich rides with armed men.\n\nBut, with eyes that were made for hunting, on horses that seemed part\nof them, they tracked and trailed--and viewed at last. Their shout gave\nKhumel Khan his notice that the price of a hundred murders was overdue,\nand he chose to make payment where a V-shaped cliff enclosed a small,\nflat plateau and not more than a dozen could ride at him at a time. His\ncompanions scattered much as a charge of shrapnel shrieks through the\nrocks, but Khumel Khan knew well enough that he was the quarry--his was\nthe head that by no conceivable chance would be allowed to plan\nfresh villainies. He might have run yet a little way, but he saw the\nuselessness, and stood.\n\nThe troop, lined out knee to knee, could come within a hundred paces of\nhim without breaking; it formed a base, then, to a triangle from which\nthe man at bay could no more escape than a fire-ringed scorpion.\n\n\"Call on him to surrender!\" ordered Cunningham.\n\nA chevroned black-beard half a horse-length behind him translated the\ndemand into stately Pashtu, and for answer the hill chieftain mounted\nhis stolen horse and shook his tulwar. He had pistols at his belt, but\nhe did not draw them; across his shoulder swung a five-foot-long jezail,\nbut he loosed it and flung it to the ground.\n\n\"Is there any here dare take me single-handed?\" he demanded with a grin.\n\nOf the eight-and-eighty, there were eighty-eight who dared; but there\nwas an eighty-ninth, a lad of not yet twenty-two, whom Indian chivalry\ndesired to honor. The troop had heard but the troop had not yet seen.\n\n\"Ride in and take him!\" ordered Cunningham and there was a\nthoroughly well acted make-believe of fear, while every eye watched\n\"Cunnigan-bahadur,\" and the horses, spurred and reined at once, pranced\nat their bits for just so long as a good man needs to make his mind up.\nAnd Cunningham rode in.\n\nHe rode in as a Rajput rides, with a swoop and a swinging sabre and a\nsilent, tight-lipped vow that he would prove himself. Green though he\nwas yet, he knew that the troop had found for him--had rounded up for\nhim--had made him his opportunity; so he took it, right under their\neyes, straight in the teeth of the stoutest tulwar man of the lower\nHimalayas.\n\nHe, too, had pistols at his belt, but there was no shot fired. There\nwas nothing but a spur-loosed rush and a shock--a spark-lit, swirling,\nslashing, stamping, snorting melee--a stallion and a mare up-ended--two\nstrips of lightning steel that slit the wind--and a thud, as a lifeless\nborder robber took the turf.\n\nThere was silence then--the grim, good silence of Mohammedan\napproval--while a native officer closed up a sword-cut with his fingers\nand tore ten-yard strips from his own turban to bind the youngster's\nhead. They rode back without boast or noise and camped without\nadvertisement. There was no demonstration made; only-a colonel said,\n\"I like things done that way, quickly, without fuss,\" and a brigadier\nremarked, \"Hrrrumph! 'Gratulate you, Mr. Cunningham!\"\n\nLater, when they camped again outside Peshawur, a reward of three\nthousand rupees that had been offered on the border outlaw's head was\npaid to Cunningham in person--a very appreciable sum to a subaltern,\nwhose pay is barely sufficient for his mess bills. So, although no\npublic comment was made on the matter, it was considered \"decent of him\"\nto contribute the whole amount to a pension fund for the dependents of\nthe regiment's dead.\n\n\"You know, that's your money,\" said his Colonel. \"You can keep every\nanna of it if you choose.\"\n\n\"I suppose I needn't be an officer unless I choose?\" suggested\nCunningham.\n\n\"I don't know, youngster! I can't guess what your troop would do if you\ntried to desert it!\"\n\nThat was, of course, merely a diplomatic recognition of the fact that\nCunningham had done his duty in making his men like him, and was not\nintended seriously. Nobody--not even the Brigadier--had any notion that\nthe troop would very shortly have to dispense with its leader's services\nwhether it wanted to or not.\n\nBut it so happened that one troop at a time was requisitioned to be\nornamental body-guard to such as were entitled to one in the frontier\ncity; and the turn arrived when Cunningham was sent. None liked the\nduty. No soldier, and particularly no irregular, likes to consider\nhimself a pipe-clayed ornament; but Cunningham would have \"gone sick\"\nhad he had the least idea of what was in store for him.\n\nIt was bad enough to be obliged to act as body-guard to men who had\njockeyed him away because they were jealous of him. The white scar that\nran now like a chin-strap mark from the corner of his eye to the angle\nof his jaw would blaze red often at some deliberately thought-out,\nnot fancied, insult from men who should have been too big to more than\nnotice him. And that, again, was nothing to the climax.\n\nMahommed Gunga chose to polish up his silver spurs and ride in from his\n\"estates\" on a protracted visit to Peshawur, and with an escort that\nmust have included half the zemindars on the countryside as well as\nhis own small retinue. Glittering on his own account like a regiment of\nhorse, and with all but a regiment clattering behind him, he chose\nthe occasion to meet Cunningham when the youngster was fuming with\nimpatience opposite the club veranda, waiting to escort a general.\n\nOn the veranda sat a dozen men who had been at considerable pains to\nput and keep the officer of the escort in his place. If the jingle and\nglitter of the approaching cavalcade had not been sufficient to attract\ntheir notice, they could have stopped their cars and yet have been\nforced to hear the greeting.\n\n\"Aha! Salaam sahib! Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur, bohut salaam! Thy father's\nson! Sahib, I am much honored!\"\n\nThe white scar blazed, but Mahommed Gunga affected not to notice the\ndiscomfort of his victim. Many more than a hundred sabred gentlemen\npressed round to \"do themselves the honor,\" as they expressed it, of\npaying Cunningham a compliment. They rode up like knights in armor in\nthe lists, and saluted like heralds bringing tribute and allegiance.\n\n\"Salaam, Chota-Cunnigan!\"\n\n\"Salaam, sahib!\"\n\n\"Bohut salaam, bahadur!\"\n\nThe Generals, the High-Court judges, and Commissioners on the club\nveranda sat unhonored, while a boy of twenty-two received obeisance from\nmen whose respect a king might envy. No Rajput ever lived who was not\nsure that his salute was worth more than tribute; he can be polite on\nall occasions, and what he thinks mere politeness would be considered\noveracting in the West, but his respect and his salute he keeps for his\nequals or his betters--and they must be men indeed.\n\nThe coterie of high officials sat indignation-bound for ten palpitating\nminutes, until the General remembered that it was his escort that was\nwaiting for him. He had ordered it an hour too soon, for the express\nsweet purpose of keeping Cunningham waiting in the sun, but it dawned\nnow on his apoplectic consciousness that his engagement was most urgent.\nHe descended in a pompous hurry, mounted and demanded why--by all the\ngods of India--the escort was not lined up to receive him. A minute\nlater, after a loudly administered reprimand that was meant as much for\nthe swarm of Rajputs as for the indignant Cunningham, he rode off with\nthe escort clattering behind him.\n\nBut on the club veranda, when the Rajputs with Mahommed Gunga had\ndispersed, the big wigs sat and talked the matter over very thoroughly.\n\n\"It's no use blinking matters,\" said the senior man present, using a\nhuge handkerchief to wave the flies away from the polished dome which\nrose between two side wisps of gray hair. \"They're going to lionize him\nwhile he's here, so we'd better move him on.\"\n\n\"But where?\"\n\n\"I've got it! There's a letter in from Everton at Abu, saying he needs\na man badly to go to Howrah and act resident there--says he hasn't heard\nfrom the missionaries and isn't satisfied--wants a man without too much\nauthority to go there and keep an eye on things in general. Howrah's a\nhell of a place from all accounts.\"\n\n\"But that 'ud be promotion!\"\n\n\"Can't be helped. No excuse for reducing him, so far as I've heard. The\ntrouble is the cub has done too dashed well. We've got to promote him if\nwe want to be rid of him.\"\n\nThey talked it over for an hour, and at the end of it decided Cunningham\nshould go to Howrah, provided a brigadier could be induced without too\nmuch argument to see reason.\n\n\"The Brigadier probably wants to keep him, and his Colonel will raise\nall the different kinds of Cain there are!\" suggested the man who had\nbegun the discussion.\n\n\"I've seen brigadiers before now reduced to a proper sense of their\nown unimportance!\" remarked another man. And he was connected with the\nTreasury. He knew.\n\nBut a week later, when the papers were sent to the Brigadier for\nsignature, he amazed everybody by consenting without the least\nobjection. Nobody but he knew who his visitor had been the night before.\n\n\"How did you know about it, Mahommed Gunga?\" he demanded, as the veteran\nsat and faced him over the tent candle, his one lean leg swaying up and\ndown, as usual, above the other.\n\n\"Have club servants not got ears, sahib?\"\n\n\"And you--?\"\n\n\"I, too, have ears--good ones!\"\n\nThe Brigadier drummed his fingers on the table, hesitating. No officer,\nhowever high up in the service, likes to lose even a subaltern from his\ncommand when that subaltern is worth his salt.\n\n\"Let him go, sahib! You have seen how we Rangars honor him--you may\nguess what difference he might make in a crisis. Sign, sahib--let him\ngo!\"\n\n\"But--where do you come in? What have you had to do with this?\"\n\n\"First, sahib, I tested him thoroughly. I found him good. Second, I told\ntales about him, making him out better than even he is. Third, I made\nsure that all those in authority at Peshawur should hate him. That\nwould have been impossible if he had been a fool, or a weak man, or\nan incompetent; but any good man can be hated easily. Fourth, sahib, I\nsent, by the hand of a man of mine, a message to Everton-sahib at Abu\nreporting to him that it was not in Howrah as it should be, and warning\nhim that a sahib should be sent there. I knew that he would listen to a\nhint from me, and I knew that he had no one in his office whom he could\nsend. Then, sahib, I brought matters to a head by bringing every man of\nmerit whom I could raise to salute him and make an outrageous exhibition\nof him. That is what I have done!\"\n\n\"One would think you were scheming for a throne, Mahommed Gunga!\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib, I am scheming for the peace of India! But there will be war\nfirst.\"\n\n\"I know there will be war,\" said the Brigadier. \"I only wish I could\nmake the other sahibs realize it.\"\n\n\"Will you sign the paper, sahib?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will sign the paper. But--\"\n\n\"But what, sahib?\"\n\n\"I'm not quite certain that I'm doing right.\"\n\n\"Brigadier-sahib, when the hour comes--and that is soon--it will be time\nto answer that! There lie the papers.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\n    Even in darkness lime and sand\n            Will blend to make up mortar.\n    Two by two would equal four\n            Under a bucket of water.\n\nNOW it may seem unimaginable that two Europeans could be cooped in\nHowrah, not under physical restraint, and yet not able to communicate\nwith any one who could render them assistance. It was the case, though,\nand not by any means an isolated case. The policy of the British\nGovernment, once established in India, was and always has been not to\noccupy an inch of extra territory until compelled by circumstances.\n\nThe native states, then, while forbidden to contract alliances with\none another or the world outside, and obliged by the letter of written\ntreaties to observe certain fundamental laws imposed on them by the\nAnglo-Indian Government, were left at liberty to govern themselves. And\nit was largely the fact that they could and did keep secret what was\ngoing on within their borders that enabled the so-called Sepoy Rebellion\nto get such a smouldering foothold before it burst into a blaze. The\nsepoys were the tools of the men behind the movement; and the men behind\nwere priests and others who were feeling nothing but their own ambition.\n\nNo man knows even now how long the fire rebellion had been burning\nunderground before showed through the surface; but it is quite obvious\nthat, in spite of the heroism shown by British and loyal native alike\nwhen the crash did come, the rebels must have won--and have won easily\nsheer weight of numbers--had they only used the amazing system solely\nfor the broad, comprehensive purpose for which it was devised.\n\nBut the sense of power that its ramifications and extent gave birth to\nalso whetted the desires individuals. Each man of any influence at all\nbegan to scheme to use the system for the furtherance of his individual\nambition. Instead of bending all their energy and craft to the one\ngreat object of hurling an unloved conqueror back whence he came, each\nreigning prince strove to scheme himself head and shoulders above the\nrest; and each man who wanted to be prince began to plot harder than\never to be one.\n\nSo in Howrah the Maharajah's brother, Jaimihr, with a large following\nand organization of his own, began to use the secret system of which he\nby right formed an integral part and to set wheels working within the\nwheels which in course of time should spew him up on the ledge which his\nbrother now occupied. Long before the rebellion was ready he had all\nhis preparations made and waited only for the general conflagration to\nstrike for his own hand. And was so certain of success that he dared\nmake plans as well for Rosemary McClean's fate.\n\nThere is a blindness, too, quite unexplainable that comes over whole\nnations sometimes. It is almost like a plague in its mysterious arrival\nand departure. As before the French Revolution there were almost none of\nthe ruling classes who could read the writing on the wall, so it was in\nIndia in the spring of '57. Men saw the signs and could not read their\nmeaning. As in France, so in India, there were a few who understood, but\nthey were scoffed at; the rest--the vast majority who held the reins of\npower--were blind.\n\nRosemary McClean discovered that her pony had gone lame, and was angry\nwith the groom. The groom ran away, and she put that down to native\nsenselessness. Duncan McClean sent one after another of the little\nnative children to find him a man who would take a letter to Mount Abu.\nThe children went and did not come back again, and he put that down to\nthe devil, who would seem to have reclaimed them.\n\nBoth of them saw the watchers, posted at every vantage-point, insolently\nwakeful; both of them knew that Jaimihr had placed them there. But\nneither of them looked one inch deeper than the surface, nor supposed\nthat their presence betokened anything but the prince's unreachable\nambition. Neither of them thought for an instant that the day could\npossibly have come when Britain would be unable to protect a woman of\nits own race, or when a native--however powerful--would dare to do more\nthan threaten.\n\nJoanna disappeared, and that led to a chain of thought which was not\ncreditable to any one concerned. They reasoned this way: Rosemary had\nseen Mahommed Gunga hold out a handful of gold coins for the old\nwoman's eyes to glitter at, therefore it was fair to presume that he\nhad promised her a reward for bringing word to the man whom, it was\nnow known, he had left behind. She had brought word to him and had\ndisappeared. What more obvious than to reason that the man had gladly\npaid her, and had just as gladly ridden off, rejoicing at the thought\nthat he could escape doing service?\n\n\"So much,\" they argued, \"for native constancy! So much for Mahommed\nGunga's boast that he knew of men who could be trusted! And so much for\nJoanna's gratitude!\"\n\nThe old woman had been saved by Rosemary McClean from the long-drawn-out\nhell that is the life portion of most Indian widows, even of low caste;\nshe had had little to do, ever, beyond snooze in the shade and eat, and\nrun sometimes behind the pony--a task which came as easily to her as\ndid the other less active parts of her employment. Her desertion,\nparticularly at a crisis, made Rosemary McClean cry, and set her father\nto quoting Shakespeare's \"King Lear.\"\n\n   \"Blow, blow, thou winter wind!\n    Thou art not so unkind\n    As man's ingratitude!\"\n\nAll Scotsmen seem to have a natural proclivity for quoting\nthe appropriate dirge when sorrow shows itself. The Book of\nLamentations--Shakespeare's sadder lines--roll off their tongues\nmajestically and seem to give them consolation--as it were to lay a\nsound, unjoyous basis for the proper enjoyment of the songs of Robbie\nBurns.\n\nThe poor old king of the poet's imagining, declaiming up above the\ncliffs of Dover, could have put no more pathos into those immortal lines\nthan did Duncan McClean as he paced up and down between the hot wars\nof the darkened room. The dry air parched his throat, and his ambition\nseemed to shrivel in him as he saw the brave little woman who was all he\nhad sobbing with her head between her hands.\n\nHe turned to the Bible, but he could find no precedent in any of its\npages for abandoning a quest like his in the teeth of disaster or\nadversity. He read it for hour after crackling hour, moistening\nhis throat from time to time with warm, unappetizing water from the\nimprovised jar filter; but when the oven blast that makes the Indian\nsummer day a hell on earth had waned and died away, he had found nothing\nbut admonishment to stand firm. There had been women, too, whose\ndeeds were worthy of record in that book, and he found no argument\nfor deserting his post on his daughter's account either. In the Bible\naccount, as he read it, it had always been the devil who fled when\nthings got too uncomfortable for him, and he was conscious of a\ntight-lipped, stern contempt for the devil.\n\nHe had about made up his mind what line to take with his daughter, when\nshe ceased her sobbing and looked up through swollen eyes to relieve him\nof the necessity for talking her over to his point view. What she said\namazed him, but not be cause it came to him as a new idea. She said, in\ndifferent words, exactly what was passing in his own mind, and it was as\nthough her tears and his search of the Scriptures had brought them both\nto one clear-cut conclusion.\n\n\"Why are we here, father?\" she asked him suddenly; and because she took\nhim by surprise he did not answer her at once. \"We are here to do\ngood aren't we?\" That was no question; it was beginning of a line of\nargument. Her father held his tongue, and laid his Bible down, and\nlistened on. \"How much good have we done yet?\"\n\nShe paused, but the pause was rhetorical, and he knew it; he could see\nthe light behind her eyes that was more than visionary; it was the light\nof practical Scots enthusiasm, unquenched and undiscouraged after a\nbattle with fear itself. She began to be beautiful again as the spirit\nof unconquerable courage won its way.\n\n\"Have we won one convert? Is there one, of those you have taught who is\nwith us still?\"\n\nThe answer was self-evident. There was none. But there was no sting for\nhim in what she asked. Rather her words came as a relief, for he could\nfeel the strength behind them. He still said nothing.\n\n\"Have we stopped one single suttee? Have we once, in any least degree,\nlessened the sufferings of one of those poor widows?\"\n\n\"Not once,\" he answered her, without a trace of shame. He knew, and she\nknew, how hard the two of them had tried. There was nothing to apologize\nfor.\n\n\"Have we undermined the power of the Hindoo priests? Have we removed one\ntrace of superstition?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"Have we given up the fight?\"\n\nHe looked hard at her. Gray eyes under gray brows met gray eyes that\nshone from under dark, wet lashes, and deep spoke unto deep. Scotsman\nrecognized Scotswoman, and the bond between them tightened.\n\n\"It seems to me\"--there was a new thrill in her voice--\"that here is\nour opportunity! Either Jaimihr wants to frighten us away or he is in\nearnest with his impudent attentions to me. In either case let us make\nno attempt to go away. Let us refuse to go away. Let us stay here at all\ncosts. If he wishes us to go away, then he must have a reason and will\nshow it, or else try to force us. If he is really trying to make love\nto me, then let him try; if he has pluck enough, let him seize me. In\neither case we shall force his hand. I am willing to be the bait. The\nmoment that he harms either you or me, the government will have to\ninterfere. If he kills us so much the better, for that would mean swift\nvengeance and a British occupation. That would stop suttee for all time,\nand we would have given our lives for something worth while. As we are,\nwe cannot communicate with our government, and Jaimihr thinks he has us\nin his grasp. Let him think it! Let him go ahead! Sooner or later the\ngovernment must find out that we are missing Then--!\" Her eyes blazed at\nthe thought of what would happen then.\n\nHer father looked at her for about a minute, sadness and pride in her\nfighting in him for the mastery. Then he rose and crossed the little\nspace between them.\n\n\"Lassie!\" he said. \"Lassie!\"\n\nShe took his hand--the one little touch of human sentiment lacking to\ndisturb his emotional balance. The Scots will talk readily enough of\nsorrow, but at showing it they are a grudging race of men. Unless a\nScotsman thinks he can gain something for his cause by showing what\nemotion racks him, he will swallow down the choking flood of grief, and\nkeep a straight face to the world and his own as well. Duncan McClean\nturned from her--drew his hand away--and walked to open the slit\nshutters. A moment later he came back, once more master of himself.\n\n\"As things are, dear,\" he said gently, \"how would it be possible for us\nto get away?\"\n\n\"'We canna gang awa'!\" she quoted, with a smile.\n\n\"NO, lassie. We must stay here and be brave. This matter is not in our\nhands. We must wait, and watch, and see. If opportunity should come\nto us to make our escape, we will seize it. Should it not come--should\nJaimihr, or some other of them, make occasion to molest us--it may\nbe--it might be that--surely the day of martyrs is not past--it might\nbe that--well, well, in either case we will eventually win. Should they\nkill us, the government must send here to avenge us; should we get away,\nsurely our report will be listened to. A month or two--perhaps only a\nweek or two--even a day or two, who knows?--and the last suttee will\nhave been performed!\"\n\nHe stood and stroked her head--then stooped and kissed it--an unusual\nbetrayal of emotion from him.\n\n\"Ye're a brave lassie,\" he said, leaving the room hurriedly, to escape\nthe shame of letting her see tears welling from his eyes--salt tears\nthat scalded as they broke their hot-wind-wearied bounds.\n\nFive minutes later she arose, dry-eyed, and went to stand in the\ndoorway, where an eddy or two of lukewarm evening breeze might possibly\nbe stirring. But a dirtily clad Hindoo, lounging on a raised, railless\nstore veranda opposite, leered at her impudently, and she came inside\nagain--to pass the evening and the sultry, black, breathless night out\nof sight, at least, of the brutes who shut her off from even exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\n    So, I am a dog? Hence I must come\n            To do thy bidding faster?\n    Must tell thee--Nay, a dog stays dumb!\n            A dog obeys one master!\n\nNOT many yards from where the restless elephants stood lined under\nbig brick arches--in an age-old courtyard, three sides of which were\nstone-carved splendor and the fourth a typically Eastern mess of\nstables, servants' quarters, litter, stink, and noisy confusion--a\nstone door, slab-hewn, gave back the aching glitter of the sun. Its only\nopening--a narrow slit quite near the top--was barred. A man--his face\nclose-pressed against them--peered through the interwoven iron rods from\nwithin.\n\nJaimihr, in a rose-pink pugree still, but not at all the swaggering\ncavalier who pranced, high-booted, through the streets--a down-at-heel\nprince, looking slovenly and heavy-eyed from too much opium--sat in\na long chair under the cloister which faced the barred stone door. He\nswished with a rhino riding-whip at the stone column beside him, and the\nmuch-swathed individual of the plethoric paunch who stood and spoke with\nhim kept a very leery eye on it; he seemed to expect the binding swish\nof it across his own shins, and the thought seemed tantalizing.\n\n\"It is not to be done,\" said Jaimihr, speaking in a dialect peculiar\nto Howrah. \"That--of all the idiotic notions I have listened to--is the\nleast worth while! Thy brains are in thy belly and are lost amid the\nfat! If my brother Howrah only had such counsellors as thou--such monkey\nfolk to make his plans for him--the jackals would have finished with him\nlong ago.\"\n\n\"Sahib, did I not bring word, and overhear, and trap the man?\"\n\n\"Truly! Overheard whisperings, and trapped me a hyena I must feed!\nNow thou sayest, 'Torture him!' He is a Rangar, and of good stock;\ntherefore, no amount of torturing will make him speak. He is that pig\nMahommed Gunga's man; therefore, there' is nothing more sure than that\nMahommed Gunga will be here, sooner or later, to look for him--Mahommed\nGunga, with the half of a Hindoo name, the whole of a Moslem's fire, and\nthe blind friendship of the British to rely on!\"\n\n\"But if the man be dead when Mahommed Gunga comes?\"\n\n\"He will be dead when Mahommed Gunga comes, if only what we await has\nfirst happened. But this rising that is planned hangs fire. Were I\nMaharajah I would like to see the Rangar who dare flout me or ask\nquestions! I would like but to set eyes on that Rangar once! But I\nam not yet Maharajah; I am a prince--a younger brother--surrounded,\ncounselled, impeded, hampered, rendered laughable by fat idiots!\"\n\n\"My belly but shows your highness's generosity. At whose cost have I\ngrown fat?\"\n\n\"Ay, at whose cost? I should have kept thee slim, on prison diet, and\nsaved myself a world of useless problems! Cease prattling! Get away from\nme! If I have to poison this Ali Partab, or wring his casteless neck, I\nwill make thee do it, and give thee to Mahommed Gunga to wreak vengeance\non. Leave me to think!\"\n\nThe fat former occupant of the room above the arch of the caravansary\nwaddled to the far end of the cloister, and sat down, cross-legged,\nto grumble to himself and scratch his paunch at intervals. His master,\nlow-browed and irritable, continued to strike the stone column with his\ncane. He was in a horrid quandary.\n\nMahommed Gunga was one of many men he did not want, for the present,\nto offend seriously. Given a fair cause for quarrel, that irascible\nex-Risaldar was capable of going to any lengths, and was known,\nmoreover, to be trusted by the British. Nobody seemed to know whether or\nnot Mahommed Gunga reciprocated the British regard, and nobody had cared\nto ask him except his own intimates; and they, like he, were men of\nclose counsel.\n\nThe Prince had given no orders for the capture of Ali Partab; that had\nbeen carried out by his men in a fit of ill-advised officiousness. But\nthe Prince had to solve the serious problem caused by the presence of\nAli Partab within a stone-walled cell.\n\nShould he let the fellow go, a report would be certain to reach Mahommed\nGunga by the speediest route. Vengeance would be instantly decided on,\nfor a Rajput does not merely accept service; he repays it, feudal-wise,\nand smites hip and thigh for the honor of his men. The vengeance would\nbe sure to follow purely Eastern lines, and would be complicated; it\nwould no doubt take the form of siding in some way or other with his\nbrother the Maharajah. There would be instant, active doings, for\nthat was Mahommed Gunga's style! The fat would be in the fire months,\nperhaps, before the proper time.\n\nThe prisoner's presence was maddening in a million ways. It had been the\nPrince's plan (for he knew well enough that Mahommed Gunga had left a\nman behind) to allow the escape to start; then it would have been an\neasy matter to arrange an ambush--to kill Ali Partab--and to pretend to\nride to the rescue. Once rescued, Miss McClean and her father would be\nalmost completely at his mercy, for they would not be able to accuse him\nof anything but friendliness, and would be obliged to return to whatever\nhaven of safety he cared to offer them. Once in his palace of their own\nconsent, they would have had to stay there until the rising of the\nwhole of India put an end to any chance of interference from the British\nGovernment.\n\nBut now there was no Ali Partab outside to try to escort them to\nsome place of safety; therefore, there was little chance that the\nmissionaries would try to make a bolt. Instead of being in the position\nof a cat that watches silently and springs when the mouse breaks cover,\nhe was in the unenviable condition now of being forced to make the first\nmove. Over and over again he cursed the men who had made Ali Partab\nprisoner, and over and over again: he wondered how--by all the gods of\nall the multitudinous Hindoo mythology--how, when, and by what stroke\nof genius he could make use of the stiff-chinned Rangar and convert him\nfrom being a rankling thorn into a useful aid.\n\nHe dared not poison him--yet. For the same reason he dared not put him\nto the torture, to discover, or try to discover, what Mahommed Gunga's\nreal leanings were in the matter of loyalty to the Raj or otherwise. He\ndared not let the man go, for forgiveness is not one of the virtues\nheld in high esteem by men of Ali Partab's race, and wrongful arrest is\nconsidered ground enough for a feud to the death. It seemed he did not\ndare do anything!\n\nHe racked his opium-dulled brain for a suspicion of a plan that\nmight help solve the difficulty, until his eye--wandering around the\ncourtyard--fell on the black shape of a woman. She was old and bent and\nshe was busied, with a handful of dry twigs, pretending to sweep around\nthe stables.\n\n\"Who is that mother of corruption?\" demanded Jaimihr; and a man came\nrunning to him.\n\n\"Who is that eyesore? I have never seen her, have I?\"\n\n\"Highness, she is a beggar woman. She sat by the gate, and pretended\nto a power of telling fortunes--which it would seem she does possess in\nsome degree. It was thought better that she should use her gift in here,\nfor our advantage, than outside to our disadvantage. So she was brought\nin and set to sweeping.\"\n\n\"By the curse of the sin of the sack of Chitor, is my palace, then,\na midden for the crawling offal of all the Howrah streets? First this\nRangar--next a sweeper hag--what follows? What bring you next? Go, fetch\nthe street dogs in!\"\n\n\"Highness, she is useful and costs nothing but the measure or two of\nmeal she eats.\"\n\n\"A horse eats little more!\" the angry Prince retorted, perfectly\naccustomed to being argued with by his own servants. That is the\ntime-honored custom of the East; obedience is one thing--argument\nanother--both in their way are good, and both have their innings. \"Bring\nher to me--nay!--keep her at a decent distance--so!--am I dirt for her\nbroom?\"\n\nHe sat and scowled at her, and the old woman tried to hide more of her\nprotruding bones under the rag of clothing that she wore; she stood,\nwriggling in evident embarrassment, well out in the sun.\n\n\"What willst thou steal of mine?\" the Prince demanded suddenly.\n\n\"I am no thief.\" Bright, beady eyes gleamed back at him, and gave the\nlie direct to her shrinking attitude of fear. But he had taken too much\nopium overnight, and was in no mood to notice little distinctions.\nHe was satisfied that she should seem properly afraid of him, and he\nscowled angrily when one of his retainers--in slovenly undress--crossed\nthe courtyard to him. The man's evident intention, made obvious by his\nmanner and his leer at the old woman, was to say something against her;\nthe Prince was in a mood to quarrel with any one, on any ground at all,\nwho did not cower to him.\n\n\"Prince, she it is who ran ever with the white woman, as a dog runs in\nthe dust.\"\n\n\"What does she here, then?\"\n\n\"Ask her!\" grinned the trooper. \"Unless she comes to look for Ali\nPartab, I know not.\"\n\nHe made the last part of his remark in a hurried undertone, too low for\nthe old woman to hear.\n\n\"Let her earn her meal around the stables,\" said the Prince. A sudden\nlight dawned on him. Here was a means, at least, of trying to make use\nof Ali Partab. \"Go--do thy sweeping!\" he commanded, and the hag slunk\noff.\n\nFor ten minutes longer, Jaimihr sat still and flicked at the stone\ncolumn with his whip,--then he sent for his master of the horse, whose\nmistaken sense of loyalty had been the direct cause of Ali Partab's\ncapture. He had acted instantly when the fat Hindoo brought him word,\nand he had expected to be praised for quick decision and rewarded; he\nwas plainly in high dudgeon as he swaggered out of a dark door near the\nstables and advanced sulkily toward his master.\n\n\"Remove the prisoner from that cell, taking great care that the hag\nyonder sees what you do--yes, that hag--the new one; she is a spy. Bring\nthe prisoner in to me, where I will talk with him; afterward place him\nin a different cell--put him where we kept the bear that died--there is\na dark comer beside it, where a man might hide; hide a man there when\nit grows dark. And give the hag access. Say nothing to her; let her come\nand go as she will; watch, and listen.\"\n\nWithout another word, the Prince got up and shuffled in his decorated\nslippers to a door at one end of the cloister. Five minutes later Ali\nPartab--high-chinned, but looking miserable--was led between two men\nthrough the same door, while the old woman went on very ostentatiously\nwith her sweeping about the yard. She even turned her back, to prove how\nlittle she was interested.\n\nAli Partab was hustled forward into a high-ceilinged room, whose light\ncame filtered through a scrollwork mesh of chiselled stone where the\nwall and ceiling joined. There were no windows, but six doors opened\nfrom it, and every one of them was barred, as though they opened into\ntreasure-vaults. The Prince sat restlessly in a high, carved wooden\nchair; there was no other furniture at all, and Ali Partab was left\nstanding between his guards. The Prince drew a pistol from inside his\nclothing.\n\n\"Leave us alone!\" he ordered; and the guards went out, closing the door\nbehind them.\n\n\"I gave no orders for your capture,\" said Jaimihr, with a smile.\n\n\"Then, let me go,\" grinned Ali Partab.\n\n\"First, I must be informed on certain matters.\"\n\nAli Partab still grinned, but the muscles of his face changed their\nposition slightly, and it took no expert in physiognomy to read that\nquestions he would answer must be very tactfully asked.\n\n\"Ask on!\"\n\n\"You are Mahommed Gunga's man?\"\n\n\"Yes. It is an honorable service.\"\n\n\"Did he order you to stay here?\"\n\n\"Here--in this palace? Allah forbid!\"\n\n\"Did he order you to stay in Howrah?\"\n\n\"He gave me certain orders. I obeyed them until your men invited swift\ndeath for themselves and you by interfering with me!\"\n\n\"What were the orders?\"\n\nAli Partab grinned again--this time insolently.\n\n\"To make sure that the Jaimihr-sahib did not make away with the treasure\nof his brother Howrah!\" he answered.\n\n\"If you were released now what would you proceed to do?\"\n\n\"To obey my orders.\"\n\nJaimihr changed his tactics and assumed the frequently successful legal\nline of pretending to know far more than he really did.\n\n\"I am told by one who overheard you speak that you were to take the\nmissionary and his daughter to Alwa's place. How much is my brother\nHowrah paying for Mahommed Gunga's services in this matter? It is well\nknown that he and Alwa between them could call out all the Rangars in\nthe district for whichever side they chose. Since they are not on my\nside, they must be for Howrah. How much does he pay? I might offer\nmore.\"\n\n\"I know not,\" said Ali Partab, perfectly ready to admit anything that\nwas not true.\n\n\"It is true, then, that Howrah has designs on the missionary's daughter?\nAlwa is to keep her prisoner until the great blow is struck, and Howrah\ndare take possession of her?\"\n\n\"That is not my business,\" answered Ali Partab, with the air of a man\nwho knew all of the secret details but would not admit it. Jaimihr began\nto think that he had lit at random on the answer to the riddle.\n\n\"Where is Mahommed Gunga?\"\n\n\"I know not.\"\n\n\"At Alwa's place?\"\n\n\"Am I God that I should know where any man is whom I cannot see?\"\n\n\"Oh! So he is at Alwa's, eh?\" That overdose of opium had rendered\nJaimihr's brain very dull indeed; he considered himself clever, and\noverlooked the fact that Ali Partab would be almost surely lying to him.\nIn India men never tell the truth to chance-met strangers or to their\nenemies; the truth is a valuable thing, to be shared cautiously among\nfriends.\n\n\"If Mahommed Gunga is at Alwa's,\" reasoned Jaimihr, \"then he is much\ntoo close at hand to take any chances with. I must keep this man close\nconfined.\" He raised his voice in a high-pitched command, and the guards\nopened the door instantly; at a sign from the Prince they seized Ali\nPartab by the wrists.\n\n\"I will send a message to Mahommed Gunga for thee,\" said Jaimihr. \"On\nhis answer will depend your release or otherwise.\" He nodded. The guards\ntook their prisoner out between them--led him past the wrinkled old\nwoman in the courtyard--and halted him in a far corner, where an\nevil-smelling cage of a place stood open to receive him. A moment later,\nin order to make sure, the master of the horse sent for the old woman\nand made her sweep out the cell a little; then he drove her away with\na fierce injunction not to let herself be caught anywhere near the cell\nagain unless ordered. Following the line of eastern reasoning, had he\nnot given that order he would not have known what her object could be\nshould she make her way toward the cell; but now, if she risked his\nwrath by disobeying, he would know beyond the least shadow of a doubt\nthat she had a message to deliver to the prisoner--the man who was\nhidden in the dark corner need entertain no hope of keeping the secret\nto himself for purposes of sale or blackmail!\n\nThey trust each other wonderfully--with an almost childlike\nconfidence--in a household such as Jaimihr's!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\n    Ho! I am king! All lesser fry\n            Must cringe, and crawl, and cry to me,\n    And none have any rights but I,--\n            Except the right to lie to me.\n\nJAIMIHR was not the only man who would have dearly liked to know of the\nwhereabouts of Mahommed Gunga. It had been reported to Maharajah Howrah,\nby his spies, that the redoubtable ex-Risaldar of horse had visited his\nrelatives in Howrah City, and, though he had not been able to ascertain\na word of what had passed, he was none the less anxious.\n\nHe knew, of course--for every soul in Howrah knew--that Jaimihr was\nplotting for the throne. He knew, too, that the priests of Siva,\nwho with himself were joint keepers of the wickedly won, tax-swollen\ntreasure, had sounded Jaimihr; they had tentatively hinted that they\nmight espouse his cause, provided that an equitable division of the\ntreasure were arranged beforehand. The question uppermost in Maharajah\nHowrah's mind was whether the Rangars--the Moslem descendants of once\nHindoo Rajputs, who formed such a small but valuable proportion of the\nlocal population--could or could not be induced to throw in their lot\nwith him.\n\nNo man on the whole tax-ridden countryside believed or considered it as\na distant possibility that the Rangars would strike for any hand except\ntheir own; they were known, on the other hand, to be more or less\ncohesive, and it was considered certain that, whichever way they swung,\nwhen the priest-pulled string let loose the flood of revolution, they\nwould swing all together. The question, then, was how to win the favor\nof the Rangars. It was not at all an easy question, for the love lost\nbetween Hindoos and Mohammedans is less than that between dark-skinned\nmen and white--a lot less.\n\nWithin two hours of its happening he had been told of the capture of\nAli Partab; and he knew--for that was another thing his spies had told\nhim--that Ali Partab was Mahommed Gunga's man. Apparently, then, Ali\nPartab--a prisoner in Jaimihr's palace-yard--was the only connecting\nlink between him and the Rangars whom he wished to win over to his side.\nHe was as anxious as any to help overwhelm the British, but he naturally\nwished to come out of the turmoil high and dry himself, and he was,\ntherefore, ready to consider the protection of individual British\nsubjects if that would please the men whom he wanted for his friends.\n\nMahommed Gunga was known to have carried letters for the missionaries.\nHe was known to have engaged a new servant when he rode away from Howrah\nand to have left his trusted man behind. Miss McClean was known to have\nconversed with the retainer, immediately after which the man had been\nseized and carried off by Jaimihr's men. Jaimihr was known to have\nplaced watchers round the mission house and--once--to have killed a man\nin Miss McClean's defense. The deduction was not too far-fetched\nthat the retainer had been left as a protection against Jaimihr, and\nconsequently that the Rangars, at the behest of Mahommed Gunga, had\ndecided--on at least the white girl's safety.\n\nTherefore, he argued, if he now proceeded to protect the McCleans, he\nwould, at all events, not incur the Rangars' enmity.\n\nIt was a serious decision that he had to make, for, for one thing, he\ndared not yet make any move likely to incite his strongly supported\nbrother to open rebellion; he dared not, therefore, interfere at\npresent with the watchers near the mission house. To openly befriend the\nChristian priests would be to set the whole Hindoo population against\nhimself, for it had been mainly against suttee and its kindred horrors\nthat the missionaries had bent all their energy.\n\nThe great palace of Howrah was ahum. Elephants with painted tusks,\nand loaded to the groaning-point under howdahs decked with jewels and\ngold-leaf, came and went through the carved entrance-gates. Occasionally\ncamels, loaded too until their legs all but buckled underneath them,\nstrutted with their weird, mixed air of foolishness and dignity, to be\ndisburdened of great cases that eight men could scarcely lift; on the\noutside the cases were marked \"Hardware,\" but a horde of armed and\nwaiting malcontents scattered about the countryside could have given a\nmore detailed and accurate guess at what was in them.\n\nMen came and went--men almost of all castes and many nationalities.\nPriests--not all of them fat, but every single one fat-smiling--sunned\nthemselves, or waited in the shade until they could have audience; no\npriest of any Hindoo temple had to wait long to be admitted to that\nRajah's presence, and there was an everlasting chain of them, each with\nhis axe to grind, coming and going by day and night.\n\nColor rioted in the blazing sun and deep, dark shadows lurked in all\nthe thousand places where the sun could never penetrate. It was India\nin essence--noise and blaze and flouted splendor, with a back-ground and\nunderground of mystery. Any but the purblind British could have told at\nhalf a glance, merely by the attitude of Howrah's armed sepoys, that a\nconcerted movement of some kind was afoot--that there was a tight-held\nthread of plan running through the whole confusion; but no man--not\neven a native--could have guessed what secret plotting might be going on\nwithin the acres of the straggling palace.\n\nFrom the courtyard there was no least hint obtainable even of the\nbuilding's size; its shape could only have been marked down from a\nbird's-eye view aloft. Even the roof was so uneven, and so subdivided by\ntraced and deep-carved walls and ramparts, that a sentry posted at one\nend could not have seen the next man to him, perhaps some twenty feet\naway. Building had been piled on building--other buildings had been\nadded end to end and crisscrosswise--and each extension had been walled\nin as new centuries saw new additions, until the many acres were a maze\nof bricks and stone and fountain-decorated gardens that no lifelong\npalace denizen could have learned to know in their entirety.\n\nWithin--one story up above the courtyard din--in a spacious, richly\ndecorated room that gave on to a gorgeous roof-garden, the Maharajah sat\nand let himself be fanned by women, who were purchasable for perhaps a\ntenth of what any of the fans had cost. Another woman, younger than the\nrest, played wild minor music to him on an instrument not much unlike\na flute; they were melancholy notes--beautiful--but sad enough to sow\npessimism's seed in any one who listened.\n\nHis divan--carved, inlaid, and gilded--faced the wide, awning-hung\nopening to the garden. Round him on all three sides was a carved stone\nscreen through whose interstices came rustlings and whisperings that\ntold of the hidden life which sees and is not seen. The women with the\nfans and flute were mere court accessories; the real nerves of Asia--the\nveiled intriguers whom none may know but whose secret power any man may\nfeel--could be heard like caged birds crowding on their perches.\n\nNow and then glass bracelets tinkled from behind the screen; ever and\nagain the music stopped, until another girl appeared to play another\nmelancholy air. But the even purring of the fans went on incessantly,\nand the poor, priest-ridden fool who owned it all scowled straight in\nfront of him, his brows lined deep in thought.\n\nIt is a strange malady, that which seizes men whom fate has elevated to\na throne. It acts as certain Indian drugs are known to do--deprives its\nvictim of the power to act, but intensifies his ability to think, and\ntheorize, and feel. Howrah, with untold treasure in his vaults, with an\narmy of five thousand men, with the authority and backing that a hundred\ngenerations give, could long for more--could fear the loss of what he\ndid have--but could not act.\n\nThe priests held him fear-bound. His brother held him hate-bound. His\nwomen--and not even he knew, probably, how many of them languished in\nthe secret warren inside those palace walls--kept him restless in a net\nof this-and-that-way-tugged intrigue. Flattery--and that is by far the\nsubtlest poison of the East--blinded him utterly to his own best course,\nand kept him blind. Luxury unmanned him; he who had once held the\nstraightest spear in western India, and for the love of feeling red\nblood racing in his veins had ridden down panthers on the maidan,\nwas flabby now; deep, dark rings underlined his eyes and the once\nsteel-sinewed wrist trembled.\n\nHis brother Jaimihr in his place, unsapped yet by decadent delights,\nwould have loosed his five thousand on the countryside--butchered any\nwho opposed him--pressed into service those who merely lagged--and would\nhave plunged India in a welter of blood before the priests had time\nto mature their plans and arrange to keep all the power and plunder to\nthemselves. But Jaimihr had to stalk lesser game and content himself\nwith pricking at the ever-growing hate that gradually rendered the\nMaharajah decisionless and sorry only for himself.\n\nA first glimpse at Howrah, particularly in the shaded room, showed a\nhandsome man, black-bearded, lean, and lithe; a second look, undazzled\nby his jewelry or by the studied magnificence of each apparently\nunstudied movement, betrayed a man whose lightest word was law, but who\nfeared to give the word. Where muscles had been were unfilled folds of\nskin that shook; where a firm if selfish mouth had once smiled merrily\nbeneath a pointed black mustache, a mouth still smiled, but meanly; the\nselfishness was there, but the firmness had faded.\n\nHis eyes, though, were his most marked feature. They were hungry eyes,\npathetic as a caged beast's and as savage. No one could see them without\npitying him, and no man in his senses would have accepted their owner's\nword on any point at all. A man looks as he did when the fire of a\nburning velt has circled him and there is no way out. There was fear\nbehind them, and the look of restless search for safety that is nowhere.\n\nIn one of the many-columned courtyards of the palace was a chained,\nmad elephant whose duty was to kneel on the Rajah's captive enemies. In\nanother courtyard was a big, square tank with a weedy, slippery stone\nramp at one end; in the tank were alligators; down the ramp other of the\nRajah's enemies, tight-bound, would scream and struggle and slide from\ntime to time. But they were only little enemies who died in that way;\nthe greater ones, who had power or influence, lived on and plotted,\nbecause the owner of the execution beasts was afraid to put them to\ntheir use.\n\nBelow, in damp, unlit dungeons, there were silken cords suspended from\nstone ceilings; their ends were noosed, and the nooses hung ten feet\nabove the floor; those told only, though, of the fate of women who had\nschemed unwisely--favorites of a week, perhaps, who had dared to sulk,\nlisteners through screens who had forgotten to forget. No men died ever\nby the silken cord, and no tales ever reached the outside world of who\ndid die down in the echoing brick cellars; there was a path that led\nunderground to the alligator tank and a trap-door that opened just\nabove the water edge. Night, and the fungus-fouled long jaws, and slimy,\nweed-filled water--the creak of rusty hinges--a splash--the bang of\na falling trap--a swirl in the moonlit water, and ring after heavy,\nwidening ring that lapped at last against the stone would write\nconclusion to a tragedy. There would be no record kept.\n\nHowrah was childless. That, of all the hell-sent troubles that beset\nhim, was the worst. That alone was worse than the hoarded treasure whose\nsecret he and his brother and the priests of Siva shared. Only in India\ncould it happen that a line of Rajahs, drag-net-armed--oblivious to the\nduties of a king and greedy only of the royal right to tax--could pile\nup, century by century, a hoard of gold an jewels--to be looked at. The\nsecret of that treasure made the throne worth plotting for--gave the\npriests, who shared the secret, more than nine tenths of their power for\nblackmail, pressure, and intrigue--and grew, like a cancer, into each\nsucceeding Rajah's mind until, from a man with a soul inside him he\nbecame in turn a heartless, fear ridden miser.\n\nAny childless king is liable to feel the insolent expectancy betrayed by\nthe heir apparent. But Jaimihr--who had no sons either--was an heir who\nunderstood all of the Indian arts whereby a man of brain may hasten the\nsuccession. Worry, artfully stirred up, is the greatest weapon of them\nall, and never a day passed but some cleverly concocted tale would reach\nthe Rajah, calculated to set his guessing faculties at work.\n\nEither of the brothers, when he happened to be thirsty, would call his\nleast-trusted counsellor to drink first from the jewelled cup, and would\nwatch the man afterward for at least ten minutes before daring to slake\nhis thirst; but Jaimihr had the moral advantage of an aspirant; Howrah,\non the defensive, wilted under the nibbling necessity for wakefulness,\nwhile Jaimihr grinned.\n\nWhat were five thousand drilled, armed men to a king who feared to use\nthem? Of what use was a waiting countryside, armed if not drilled, if he\nwas not sure that his brother had not won every man's allegiance? Being\nHindoo, priest-reared, priest-fooled, and priest-flattered, he knew, or\nthought he knew, to an anna the value he might set on Hindoo loyalty\nor on the loyalty of any man who did not stand to gain in pocket by\nremaining true; and, as many another fear-sick tyrant has begun to do,\nhe turned, in his mind at least, to men of another creed--which in India\nmeans of another race, practically-wondering whether he could not make\nuse of them against his own.\n\nLike every other Rajah of his line, he longed to have sole control\nof that wonderful treasure that had eaten out his very manhood. Miser\nthough he was, he was prepared at least to bargain with outsiders with\nthe promise of a portion of it, if that would give him possession of it\nall. He had learned from the priests who took such full advantage of him\nan absolute contempt for Mohammedans; and their teaching, as well as his\nown trend of character, made him quite indifferent to promises he might\nmake, for the sake of diplomacy, to men of another creed. It began to be\nobvious to him that he would lose nothing by courting the favor of the\nRangars, and of Alwa in particular, and that he might win security by\ncoaxing them to take his part. Of one thing he was certain: the Rangars\nwould do anything at all, if by doing it they could harm the Hindoo\npriests.\n\nBut, being of the East Eastern, and at that Hindoo, he could not have\nbrought himself to make overtures direct and go straight to the real\nissue. He had to feel his way gingerly. The thousand horses in his\nstables, he reflected, would mount a thousand of the Rangars and place\nat his disposal a regiment of cavalry which would be difficult to beat;\nbut a thousand mounted Mohammedans might be a worse thorn in his side\nthan even his brother or the priests. He decided to write to Alwa, but\nto open negotiations with a very thin and delicately inserted wedge.\n\nHe could write. The priests had overlooked that opportunity, and had\ntaught him in his boyhood; in that one thing he was their equal. But the\nother things that they had taught him, too, offset his penmanship.\nHe was too proud to write--too lazy, too enamoured of his dignity.\nHe called a court official, and the man sat very humbly at his\nfeet--listened meekly to the stern command to secrecy--and took the\nletter from dictation.\n\nAlwa was informed, quite briefly, that in view of certain happenings in\nHowrah City His Highness the Maharajah had considered it expedient\nto set a guard over the Christian missionaries in the city, for their\nsafety. The accompanying horse was a gift to the Alwa-sahib. The\nAlwa-sahib himself would be a welcome guest whenever he might care to\ncome.\n\nThe document was placed in a silver tube and scaled. Within the space of\nhalf an hour a horseman was kicking up the desert dust, riding as though\nhe carried news of life-and-death importance, and with another man and a\nled horse galloping behind him. Five minutes after the man had started,\nin a cell below the temple, of Siva, the court official who had taken\ndown the letter was repeating it word for word to a congeries of\npriests. And one hour later still, in a room up near the roof of\nJaimihr's palace, one of the priests--panting from having come so\nfast--was asking the Rajah's brother what he thought about it.\n\n\"Did he say nothing--,\" asked Jaimihr.\n\n\"Nothing, sahib.\"\n\nThe priest watched him eagerly; he would have to bear back to the other\npriests an exact account of the Prince's every word, and movement, and\nexpression.\n\n\"Then I, too, say nothing!\" answered Jaimihr.\n\n\"But to the priests of Siva, who are waiting, sahib?\"\n\n\"Tell them I said nothing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\n    Eyes in the dark, awake and keen,\n            See and may not themselves be seen;\n    But--and this is the tale I tell--\n            What if the dark have eyes as well?\n\nBESIDE the reeking bear's cage in which Ali Partab stood and swore was\na dark, low corner space in which at one time and another sacks and\nuseless impedimenta had been tossed, to become rat-eaten and decayed. In\namong all the rubbish, cross-legged like the idol of the underworld, a\nnearly naked Hindoo sat, prick-eared. He was quite invisible long before\nthe sun went down, for that was the dingiest corner of the yard; when\ntwilight came, he could not have been seen from a dozen feet away.\n\nJoanna, sweeping, sweeping, sweeping, in the courtyard, with her back\nvery nearly always turned toward the cage, appeared to take no notice\nof the falling darkness; unlike the other menials, who hurried to their\nrest and evening meal, she went on working, accomplishing very little\nbut seeming to be very much in earnest about it all. Very, very\ngradually she drew nearer to the cage. When night fell, she was within\nten feet of it. A few lamps were lit then, here and there over doorways,\nbut nobody appeared to linger in the courtyard; no footfalls resounded;\nnothing but the neigh of stabled horses and the chatter around the big,\nflat supper pans broke on the evening quiet.\n\nJoanna drew nearer. Ali Partab came forward to the cage bars, but said\nnothing; it was very dark inside the cage, and even the sharp-eyed\nold woman could not possibly have seen his gestures; when he stood,\ntight-pressed, against the bars she might have made out his dark shape\ndimly, but unless he chose to speak no signal could possibly have passed\nfrom him to her. He said nothing, though, and she-still sweeping, with\nher back toward him--passed by the cage, and stooped to scratch at some\nhard-caked dirt or other close to the rubbish hole where the Hindoo\nwaited. Still scratching, still working with her twig broom, still\nwith her back toward the rubbish hole, she approached until the darkest\nshadow swallowed her.\n\nThere were two in the dark then--she and the man who listened. He,\nmotionless as stone, had watched her; peering outward at the lesser\ndarkness, he lost sight of her for a second as she backed into the\ndeepest shadow unexpectedly. Before he could become accustomed to the\naltered focus and the deeper black, her beady eyes picked out the whites\nof his. Before he could move she was on him--at his throat, tearing it\nwith thin, steel fingers. Before he could utter a sound, or move, she\nhad drawn a short knife from her clothing and had driven it to the hilt\nbelow his ear. He dropped without a gurgle, and without a sound she\ngathered up her broom again and swept her way back past the cage-bars,\nwhere Ali Partab waited.\n\n\"Was any there?\" he whispered.\n\n\"There was one.\"\n\n\"And--?\"\n\n\"He was.\"\n\n\"Good! Now will the reward be three mohurs instead of two!\"\n\n\"Where are they?\"\n\n\"These pigs have taken all the money from me. Now we must wait until\nMahommed Gunga-sahib comes. His word is pledged.\"\n\n\"He said two mohurs.\"\n\n\"I--Ali Partab--pledge his word for three.\"\n\n\"And who art thou? The bear in the cage said: 'I will eat thee if I get\noutside!\"'\n\n\"Mother of corruption! Listen! Alwa must know! Canst thou escape from\nhere? Canst thou reach the Alwa-sahib?\"\n\n\"If the price were four mohurs, there might be many things that I could\ndo.\"\n\n\"The price is three! I have spoken!\"\n\n\"'I would eat honey were I outside!' said the bear.\"\n\n\"Hag! The bear died in the cage, and they sold his pelt for how much?\nAlive, he had been worth three mohurs, but he died while they bargained\nfor him!--Quick!\"\n\n\"I am black, sahib, and the night is black. I am old, and none would\nbelieve me active. They watch the gates, but the bats fly in and out.\"\n\n\"Find out, then, what has happened to my horses, left at the\ncaravansary; give that information to the Alwa-sahib. Tell the\nMiss-sahib at the mission where I am. Tell her whither I have sent thee.\nTell the Alwa-sahib that a Rangar--by name Ali Partab--sworn follower of\nthe prophet, and servant of the Risaldar Mahommed Gunga--is in need and\nasks his instant aid. Say also to the Alwa-sahib that it may be well to\nrescue the Miss-sahib first, before he looks for me, but of that matter\nI am no judge, being imprisoned and unable to ascertain the truth. Hast\nthou understood?\"\n\n\"And all that for three mohurs?\"\n\n\"Nay. The price is now two mohurs again. It will be one unless--\"\n\n\"Three, sahib! It was three!\"\n\n\"Then run! Hasten!\"\n\nThe shadows swallowed her again. She crept where they were darkest--lay\nstill once, breathless, while a man walked almost over her--reached the\nouter wall, and felt her way along it until she reached low eaves that\nreached down like a jagged saw from utter blackness. Less than a minute\nlater she was crawling monkeywise along a roof; before another five had\npassed she had dropped on all fours in the dust of the outer road and\nwas running like a black ghost--head down--an end of her loin-cloth\nbetween her teeth--one arm held tight to her side and the other crooked\noutward, swinging--striding, panting, boring through the blackness.\n\nShe wasted little time at the caravansary. The gate was shut and a\nsleepy watchman cursed her for breaking into his revery.\n\n\"Horses? Belonging to a Rangar? Fool! Does not the Maharajah-sahib\nimpound all horses left ownerless? Ask them back of him that took them!\nGo, night-owl! Go ask him!\"\n\nAlmost as quickly as a native pony could have eaten up the distance, she\ndropped panting on the door-step of the little mission house. She\nwas panting now from fright as well as sheer exhaustion. There were\nwatchers--two sets of them. One man stood, with his back turned within\nten paces of her, and another--less than two yards away from him--stood,\nturned half sideways, looking up the street and whistling to himself.\nThere was not a corner or an angle of the little place that was not\nguarded.\n\nShe had tried the back door first, but that was locked, and she had\nrapped on it gently until she remembered that of evenings the missionary\nand his daughter occupied the front room always and that they would not\nhave heard her had she hammered. She tapped now, very gently, with her\nfingers on the lower panel of the door, quaking and trembling in every\nlimb, but taking care to make her little noise unevenly, in a way\nthat would be certain to attract attention inside. Tap-tap-tap. Pause.\nTap-tap. Pause. Tap-tap-tap-tap-tap. Pause. Tap-tap. The door opened\nsuddenly. Both watchers turned and gazed straight into the lamplight\nthat streamed out past the tall form of Duncan McClean. He stared at\nthem and they stared back again. Joanna slunk into the deep shadow at\none side of the steps.\n\n\"Is it necessary for you to annoy me by rapping on my door as well as by\nspying on me?\" asked the missionary in a tone of weary remonstrance.\n\nThe guards laughed and turned their backs with added insolence. In that\nsecond Joanna shot like a black spirit of the night straight past the\nmissionary's legs and collapsed in a bundle on the floor behind him.\n\n\"Shut the door, sahib!\" she hissed at him. \"Quick! Shut the door!\"\n\nHe shut it and bolted it, half recognizing something in the voice or\nelse guided by instinct.\n\n\"Joanna!\" he exclaimed, holding up a lamp above her. \"You, Joanna!\"\n\nAt the name, Rosemary McClean came running out--looked for an\ninstant--and then knelt by the old woman.\n\n\"Father, bring some water, please, quickly!\"\n\nThe missionary went in search of a water-jar, and Rosemary McClean bent\ndown above the ancient, shrivelled, sorry-looking mummy of a woman--drew\nthe wrinkled head into her lap--stroked the drawn face--and wept over\nher. The spent, age-weakened, dried-out widow had fainted; there was no\nwakened self-consciousness of black and white to interfere. This was a\nfriend--one lone friend of her own sex amid all the waste of smouldering\nhate--some one surely to be wept over and made much of and caressed.\nThe poor old hag recovered consciousness with her head pillowed on a\nEuropean lap, and Duncan McClean--no stickler for convention and no\nbeliever in a line too tightly drawn--saw fit to remonstrate as he laid\nthe jar of water down beside them.\n\n\"Why,\" she answered, looking up at him, \"father, I'd have kissed a dog\nthat got lost and came back again like this!\"\n\nThey picked her up between them, after they had let her drink, and\ncarried her between them to the long, low sitting-room, where she told\nthem--after considerable make-believe of being more spent than she\nreally was--after about a tenth \"sip\" at the brandy flask and when\nanother had been laughingly refused--all about Ali Partab and what his\norders to her were.\n\n\"I wonder what it all can mean?\" McClean sat back and tried to summarize\nhis experiences of months and fit them into what Joanna said.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" asked his daughter, leaning forward. She was\nstaring at Joanna's forearm and from that to a dull-red patch on the\nwoman's loin-cloth. Joanna answered nothing.\n\n\"Are you wounded, Joanna? Are you sure? That's blood! Look here,\nfather!\"\n\nHe agreed that it was blood. It was dry and it came off her forearm in\nlittle flakes when he rubbed it. But not a word could they coax out\nof Joanna to explain it, until Rosemary--drawing the old woman to\nher--espied the handle of her knife projecting by an inch above the\nwaist-fold of her cloth. Too late Joanna tried to hide it. Rosemary held\nher and drew it out. Beyond any shadow of a doubt, there was blood on\nthe blade still, and on the wooden hilt, and caked in the clumsy joint\nbetween the hilt and blade.\n\n\"'Joanna--have you killed any one?\"\n\nJoanna shook her head.\n\n\"Tell me the truth, Joanna. Whose blood is that?\"\n\n\"A dog's, Miss-sahib. A street dog attacked me as I ran hither.\"\n\n\"I wish I could believe it!\"\n\n\"I too!\" said her father, and he took Joanna to one side and\ncross-examined her. But he could get no admission from her--nothing but\nthe same statement, with added details each time he made her tell it,\nthat she had killed a dog.\n\nThey fed her, and she ate like a hyena. No caste prejudices or forbidden\nfoods troubled her; she ate whatever came her way, Hindoo food, or\nMohammedan, or Christian,--and reached for more--and finished, as hyenas\nfinish, by breaking bones to get the marrow out. At midnight they left\nher, curled dogwise on a mat in the hall, to sleep; and at dawn, when\nthey came to wake her, she was gone again--gone utterly, without a trace\nor sign of explanation. The doors, both front and back, were locked.\n\nIt was two days later when they found a hole torn through the thatch,\nthrough which she had escaped; and though they searched the house from\ncellar up to roof, and turned all their small possessions over, they\ncould not find (and they were utterly glad of it) that she had stolen\nanything.\n\n\"Thank God for that!\" said the missionary.\n\n\"I've finished disbelieving in Joanna!\" said his daughter with a grimace\nthat went always with irrevocable decision.\n\n\"I've come to the conclusion,\" said McClean, \"that there are more than\njust Joanna to be trusted. There is Ali Partab, and--who knows how\nmany?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\n    Against all fear; against the weight of what,\n    For lack of worse name, men miscall the Law;\n    Against the Tyranny of Creed; against the hot,\n    Foul Greed of Priest, and Superstition's Maw;\n    Against all man-made Shackles, and a man-made Hell--\n    Alone--At last--Unaided--\n            I REBEL!\n\nNo single, individual circumstance, but a chain of happenings in very\nquick succession, brought about a climax, forcing the hand of Howrah\nand his brother and for the moment drawing the McCleans, father and\ndaughter, into the toothed wheel of Indian action. As usual in India,\nthe usual brought about the unexpected, and the unexpected fitted\nstrangely into the complex, mysteriously worked-out whole.\n\nTwo days after Joanna left the mission house, through a hole made in the\nthatch, the spirit of revolt took hold of Rosemary McClean again. The\nstuffy, narrow quarters--the insolent, doubled, unexplained, but very\nobvious, guard that lounged outside--the sense of rank injustice\nand helplessness--the weird feeling of impending horror added onto\nstale-grown ghastliness--youth, chafing at the lack of liberty--stirred\nher to action.\n\nWithout a word to her father, who was writing reports that seemed\nendless at the little desk by the shaded window, she left the\nhouse--drew with a physical effort on all her reserve of strength and\nhealth--faced the scorching afternoon wind, as though it were a foe that\ncould shrink away before her courage, and walked, since she had no pony\nnow, in any direction in which chance or her momentary whim might care\nto lead her.\n\n\"I won't cry again--and I won't submit--and I'll see what happens!\" she\ntold herself; and the four who followed her at a none-too-respectful\ndistance--two of the Maharajah's men in uniform and two shabby-looking\nruffians of Jaimihr's--grinned as they scented action. Like their\nmasters they bore no love for one another; they were there now, in fact,\nas much to watch one another as the missionaries; they detected the\npossibility of an excuse to be at one another's throats, and gloated\nas they saw two messengers, one of either side, run off in a hurry to\ninform the rival camps.\n\nIt was neither plan nor conscious selection that led Rosemary McClean\ntoward the far end of the maidan, where the sluggish, narrow, winding\nHowrah River sucked slimily beside the burning ghats. When she realized\nwhere her footsteps were leading her she would have turned in horror and\nretreated, for even a legitimately roasting corpse that died before the\nHindoo priests had opportunity to introduce it to the flames is no sight\nfor eyes that are civilized.\n\nBut, when she turned her head, the sight of her hurrying escort\nperspiring in her wake--(few natives like the heat and wind one whit\nbetter than their conquerors)--filled her with an unexpected, probably\nunjustifiable, determination not to let them see her flinch at any kind\nof horror. That was the spirit of sahibdom that is not always quite\ncommendable; it is the spirit that takes Anglo-Saxon women to the\nseething, stenching plains and holds them there high-chinned to stiffen\ntheir men-folk by courageous example, but it leads, too, to things not\nquite so womanly and good.\n\n\"I'll show them!\" muttered Rosemary McClean, wiping the blown dust from\nher eyes and facing the wind again that now began to carry with it the\nunspread taint--the awful, sickening, soul-revolting smell inseparable\nfrom Hindoo funeral rites. There were three pyres, low-smouldering,\nclose by the river-bank, and men stirred with long poles among the ashes\nto make sure that the incineration started the evening before should be\ncomplete; there was one pyre that looked as though it had been lit long\nafter dawn--another newly lit--and there were two pyres building.\n\nIt was those two new ones that held her attention, and finally\ndecided her to hold her course. She wanted to make sure. The smell of\nburning--the unoutlined, only guessed-at ghastliness--would probably\nhave killed her courage yet, before she came close enough to really see;\nbut the suspicion of a greater horror drew her on, as snakes are said to\ndraw birds on, by merely being snakes, and with red-rimmed eyes smarting\nfrom smoke as well as wind she pressed forward.\n\nThe ghats were deserted-looking, for the funeral rites of those who\nburned were practically over until the time should come to scatter ashes\non the river-surface; only a few attendants hovered close to the fires\nto prod them and occasionally throw on extra logs. Only round the\ntwo new pyres not yet quite finished was anything approaching a crowd\nassembled, and there a priest was officiously directing the laying of\nthe logs. It was the manner of their laying and the careful building\nof a scaffold on each side of either pyre that held Rosemary\nMcClean's attention--called all the rebellious womanhood within her to\ninterfere--and drew her nearer.\n\nSoon the priest noticed her--a cotton-skirted wraith amid the smoke--and\nshouted to the guards behind; one of them answered, laughing coarsely,\nand Rosemary understood enough of the dialect he used to grit her teeth\nwith shame and anger. The men left off building, and, directed by the\npriest, came toward her in a ragged line to cut her off from closer\napproach; she stood, then--examined the new pyres as carefully as she\ncould--walked to another vantage-point and viewed them sideways--then\nturned her back.\n\n\"Oh, the brutes!\" she ejaculated. There were tears in her voice, as well\nas helpless anger. \"There is not one devil, there are a million, and\nthey all live here!\"\n\nShe looked back again once, trembling with an overmastering hate,\ndirected less at the priest who grinned back at her than at the\nloathsome rite he represented. In two actual words, she cursed him.\nIt was the first time she had ever cursed anybody in her life, and the\nwickedness of doing it swept over her as a relief. She revelled in it.\nShe was glad she had cursed him. Her little, light, graceful body that\nhad been quivering grew calm again, and she turned to hurry home with an\nunexpected sense of having pulled some lever in the mechanism that would\nbring about results. She neither knew nor cared what results, nor how\nthey were to happen; she felt that that curse of hers, her first, had\nlanded on the mark!\n\nBut she had come further than she thought. Distance, hot wind, and\nemotion had exhausted her far more, too, than she had had time to\nrealize. Before a mile of the homeward journey had been accomplished,\nshe was forced against her stubborn Scots will to sit down on a big\nstone by the roadside and rest, while the four that followed came up\nclose, grinning and passing remarks in anything but under-tones. If\nthe meaning of the words escaped her, their gestures left little to\nbe misunderstood. A crowd of stragglers drew together near the\nfour--laughed with them--took sides in the coarse-worded argument about\nJaimihr's known ambition--and shamed her into pressing on homeward.\n\nBut she was forced to rest again, and then again. Physical sickness\nprevented her from obeying instinct, reason, will, that all three urged\nher on. No false pride now told her to dare the insolence of the guards;\nnothing appealed to her but the desire to hurry, hurry, hurry, and do\nwhatever should appear to need doing when she reached the mission house.\nShe had no plan in her head. She only knew that she had cursed a man,\nand that the curse was potent. But her feet dragged, and her vitality\ndied down. It was sundown when she reached the mission house, and she\ncould hear the rising, falling, intermittent din of drums before she saw\nher father in the doorway.\n\n\"Father!\" She ran to him, and he caught her in his arms to save her from\nfalling headlong. \"Father, there is going to be a suttee tonight! Hear\nthe drums, father! Hear the drums! It'll be tonight! That's to stop the\nscreams from being heard! Listen to them, father--two suttees, side\nby side--I've seen the pyres and the scaffolds--do they jump into the\nflames, father, from the scaffolds?--tell me! No-don't tell me--I won't\nlisten! Take me away from here--away--away--away--take me away, d'you\nhear!\"\n\nHe carried her inside, and laid her on the caned couch in the\nliving-room, looking like a great, big, helpless, gray-haired baby, as\nany man is prone to do when he has hysteria to deal with in a woman whom\nhe loves.\n\n\"I cursed a man, father! I cursed a man! I did! I said 'Damn you!' I'm\nglad!\"\n\n\"Don't, little girl--don't! Lassie mine, don't! Never mind what you saw\nor what you said--be calm now--there is something we must do; we must\nact; I have determined we must act. We must act tonight. But we can't do\nanything with you in this state.\"\n\nSlowly, gradually he calmed her--or probably she grew calm, in spite of\nhis attentions, for he was too upset himself to exercise much soothing\nsway over anybody else. At last, though, she fell into a fitful sleep,\nand he sat beside her, holding rigid the left hand that she clutched,\nletting it stiffen and grow cold and numb for fear of waking her.\n\nOutside a full moon rose majestically, pure and silvery as peace\nherself, bathing the universe in blessings. And each month, when the\nfull moon rose above the carved dome of Siva's temple, there was a\nceremony gone through that commemorated cruelty, greed, poisoning,\nthroat-slitting, hate, and all the hell-invented infamy that suckles\nalways at the breast of stagnant treasure.\n\nSince history has forgotten when, at each full moon, the priests of Siva\nhad gone with circumstantial ceremony to view the hoarded wealth tied up\nby jealousy and guarded jealously in Howrah's palace. With them, as\nthe custom that was stronger than a thousand laws dictated, went the\nMaharajah and his brother Jaimihr--joint owners with the priests.\n\nThere had not been one Maharajah, since the first of that long line, who\nwould not have given the lives of ten thousand men for leave to broach\nthat treasure; nor, since the first heir apparent shared the secret with\nthe priests and the holder of the throne, had there been one prince in\nline-son-brother-cousin--who would not have drenched the throne with his\nrelation's blood with that same purpose.\n\nHeir after heir could have agreed with Maharajah, but the priests had\nstood between. That treasure was their fulcrum; the legacy, dictated by\na dead, misguided hand, intended as a war reserve to stay the throne of\nHowrah in its need, and trebly locked to guard against profligacy, had\nplaced the priests of Siva in the position of dictators of Howrah's\ndestiny. A word from them, and a prince would slay his father--only\nto discover that the promises of Siva's priests were something less to\nbuild on than the hope of loot. There would be another heir apparent\nto be let into the secret--another man to scheme and hunger for the\nthrone--another party to the bloody three-angled intrigue which kept the\nSiva-servers fat and the princes lean.\n\nPast masters of the art by which superstitious ignorance is swayed,\nthe priests could swing the allegiance of the mob whichever way they\nchose--even the soldiers, loyal enough to their masters under ordinary\ncircumstances, would have rebelled at as much as a hint from holy Siva.\nIt was the priests who made it possible for Jaimihr to dare take\nhis part in the ceremony; without them he would not have entered his\nbrother's palace-yard unless five thousand men at least were there to\nguard his back--but, if there was danger where the priests were, there\nwas safety too.\n\nAs the custom was, he rode to the temple of Siva first with a ten-man\nguard; there, when the priests had finished droning age-old anthems to\nthe echoing roof, when his brother, the Maharajah, also with a ten-man\nguard, had joined him, and the two had submitted to the sanctifying\nrites prescribed, eleven priests would walk with them in solemn mummery\nto the palace-entrance--censer-swinging, chanting, blasphemously acting\nduty to their gods and state.\n\nThe moon--and that, too, was custom-rested with her lower rim one full\nhand's breadth above the temple dome as viewed from the palace-gate,\nwhen a gong clanged resonantly, died to silence, music of pipes and\ncymbals broke on the evening quiet, and the strange procession started\nfrom the temple door, the Maharajah leading.\n\nGenerally it passed uninterrupted over the intervening street to the\npalace-entrance, between the ranks of a salaaming, silent crowd, and\ndisappeared from view. This time, though, for the first time in living\nmemory, and possibly for the first time in all history, the unforeseen,\namazing happened. The procession stopped. Moon-bathed, between the\ncarved posts of the palace-gate, two people blocked the way.\n\nThe music ceased. The sudden silence framed itself against the distant\nthunder of a hundred drums. The crowd--all heads bowed, as decreed--drew\nin its breath and held it. A sea of pugrees moved as brown eyes looked\nup surreptitiously--stared--memorized--and then looked down again. There\nwas no precedent for this happening, and even the Maharajah and the\npriests were at a momentary loss--stood waiting, staring--and said\nnothing.\n\n\"Maharajah-sahib!--I must interrupt your ceremony. I must have word with\nyou at once!\"\n\nIt was Duncan McClean, bareheaded, holding his daughter's hand. They\nhad no weapons; they were messengers of peace, protesting, or so they\nlooked. No longer timid, but resigned to what might happen--they held\neach other's hands, and blocked the way of Siva's votaries--Siva's\ntools--and Siva's ritual.\n\nJaimihr whispered to his brother--the first time he had dared one\nword to him in person for years--the high priest of the temple pressed\nforward angrily, saying nothing, but trying to combine rage and dignity\nwith an attempt to turn the incident to priestly advantage. Surely this\nwas a crisis out of which the priests must come triumphant; they held\nall the cards--knew how and when rebellion was timed, and could compare,\nas the principals themselves could not do, Howrah's strength with\nJaimihr's. And the priests had the crowd to back them--the ignorant,\nsuperstitious crowd that can make or dethrone emperors.\n\nBut some strange freak of real dignity--curiosity perhaps, or possibly\noccasion--spurred desire to act of his own initiative and keep the high\npriest in his place--impelled the Maharajah in that minute. Men said\nafterward that Jaimihr had whispered to him advice which he knew was\nbarbed because it was his brother whispering, and that he promptly did\nthe opposite; but, whatever the motive, he drew himself up in all his\njewelled splendor and demanded: \"What do you people wish?\"\n\nThe McCleans were given no time to reply. The priests did not see fit\nto let the reins of this occasion slip; the word went out, panic-voiced,\nthat sacrilege to Siva was afoot.\n\n\"Slay them! Slay them!\" yelled the crowd. \"They violate the sacred\nrites!\"\n\nThere were no Mohammedans among that crowd to take delight in seeing\nHindoo priests discomfited and Hindoo ritual disturbed. There came no\ncounter-shout. The crowd did not, as so often happens, turn and rend\nitself; and yet, though a surge from behind pressed forward, the men in\nfront pressed back.\n\n\"Slay them! Slay the sacrilegious foreigners!\" The yell grew louder and\nmore widely voiced, but no man in the front ranks moved.\n\nThe Maharajah looked from the company of guards that lined the\npalace-steps to the priests and his brother and the crowd--and then to\nthe McCleans again.\n\nHe remembered Alwa and his Rangars, thought of the messenger whom he had\nsent, remembered that a regiment of lance-armed horsemen would be worth\na risk or two to win over to his side, and made decision.\n\n\"You are in danger,\" he asserted, using a pronoun not intended to convey\npoliteness, but--Eastern of the East--counteracting that by courtesy of\nmanner. \"Do you ask my aid?\"\n\n\"Yes, among other things,\" Duncan McClean answered him. \"I wish also\nto speak about a Rangar, who I know is held prisoner in a cage in the\nJaimihr-sahib's palace.\"\n\n\"Speak of that later,\" answered Howrah. \"Guard!\"\n\nHe made a sign. A spoken word might have told the priests too much, and\nhave set them busy fore-stalling him. The guards rushed down the\nsteps, seized both McCleans, and half-carried, half-hustled them up the\npalace-steps, through the great carved doors, and presently returned\nwithout them.\n\n\"They are my prisoners,\" said the Maharajah, turning to the high priest.\n\"We will now proceed.\"\n\nThe crowd was satisfied, at least for the time being. Well versed in the\nkind of treatment meted out to prisoners, partly informed of what was\npreparing for the British all through India, the crowd never doubted\nfor an instant but that grizzly vengeance awaited the Christians who\nhad dared to remonstrate against time-honored custom. It looked for the\nmoment as though the high priest's word had moved the Maharajah to\norder the arrest, and the high priest realized it. By skilful play and\nwell-used dignity he might contrive to snatch all the credit yet. He\nordered; the pipes and cymbals started up again at once; and, one by\none--Maharajah, Jaimihr, high priest, then royal guard, Jaimihr's guard,\npriest again--the procession wound ahead, jewelled and egretted, sabred\nand spurred, priest-robed, representative of all the many cancers eating\nat the heart of India.\n\nChanting, clanging, wailing minor dirges to the night, it circled all\nthe front projections of the palace, turned where a small door opened on\na courtyard at one side, entered, and disappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\n    Oh, is it good, my soldier prince and is the wisdom clear,\n    To guard thy front a thousand strong, while ten may take thy rear?\n\nNow, because it was impregnable to almost anything except a\nyet-to-be-invented air-ship, the Alwa-sahib owned a fortress still,\nhigh-perched on a crag that overlooked a glittering expanse of desert.\nMore precious than its bulk in diamonds, a spring of clear, cold water\nfrom the rock-lined depths of mother earth gushed out through a fissure\nnear the Summit, and round that spring had been built, in bygone\ncenturies, a battlemented nest to breed and turn out warriors.\nAlwa's grandfather had come by it through complicated bargaining and\ndowry-contracts, and Alwa now held it as the rallying-point for the\nRangars thereabout.\n\nBut its defensibility was practically all the crag fort had to offer by\nway of attraction. Down at its foot, where the stream of rushing water\nsplashed in a series of cascades to the thirsty, sandy earth, there were\nan acre or two of cultivation--sufficient, in time of peace, to\nsupport an attenuated garrison and its horses. But for his revenues the\nAlwa-sahib had to look many a long day's march afield. Leagues of desert\nlay between him and the nearest farm he owned, and since--more in the\nEast than anywhere--a landlord's chief absorption is the watching of his\nrents, it followed that he spent the greater part of his existence in\nthe saddle, riding from one widely scattered tenant to another.\n\nIt was luck or fortuitous circumstance--Fate, he would have called it,\nhad he wasted time to give it name--that brought him along a road where,\nmany miles from Howrah City, he caught sight of Joanna. Needless to say,\nhe took no slightest notice of her.\n\nDog-weary, parched, sore-footed, she was hurrying along the burning,\nsandy trail that led in the direction of Alwa's fort. The trail was\nnarrow, and the horsemen whose mounts ambled tirelessly behind Alwa's\nplain-bred Arab pressed on past him, to curse the hag and bid her make\nhorse-room for her betters. She sunk on the sand and begged of them.\nLaughingly, they asked her what a coin would buy in all that arid waste.\n\n\"Have the jackals, then, turned tradesman?\" they jeered; but she only\nmumbled, and displayed her swollen tongue, and held her hands in\nan attitude of pitiful supplication. Then Alwa cantered up--rode\npast--heard one of his men jeering--drew rein and wheeled.\n\n\"Give her water!\" he commanded.\n\nHe sat and watched her while she knelt, face upward, and a Rangar poured\nlukewarm water from a bottle down her tortured throat. He held it high\nand let the water splash, for fear his dignity might suffer should he or\nthe bottle touch her. Strictly speaking, Rangars have no caste, but they\nretain by instinct and tradition many of the Hindoo prejudices. Alwa\nhimself saw nothing to object to in the man's precaution.\n\n\"Ask the old crows' meat whither she was running.\"\n\n\"She says she would find the Alwa-sahib.\"\n\n\"Tell her I am he.\"\n\nJoanna fawned and laid her wrinkled forehead in the dust.\n\n\"Get up!\" he growled. \"Thy service is dishonor and my ears are deaf to\nit! Now, speak! Hast thou a message? Who is it sends a rat to bring me\nnews?\"\n\n\"Ali Partab.\"\n\n\"Soho! And who is Ali Partab? He needs to learn manners. He has come to\na stern school for them!\"\n\n\"Sahib--great one--Prince of swordsmen!--Ali Partab is Mahommed\nGunga-sahib's man. He bid me say that he is held a prisoner in a\nbear-cage in Jaimihr's palace and needs aid.\"\n\nAlwa's black beard dropped onto his chest as he frowned in thought. He\nhad nine men with him. Jaimihr had by this time, perhaps, as many as\nnine thousand, for no one knew but Jaimihr and the priests how many\nin the district waited to espouse his cause. The odds seemed about as\nstupendous as any that a man of his word had ever been called upon to\ntake.\n\nA moment more, and without consulting any one, he bade one of his men\ndismount.\n\n\"Put that hag on thy horse!\" he commanded. \"Mount thou behind another!\"\n\nThe order was obeyed. Another Rangar took the led horse, and Joanna\nfound herself, perched like a monkey on a horse that objected to the\nchange of riders, between two troopers whose iron-thewed legs squeezed\nhers into the saddle.\n\n\"To Howrah City!\" ordered Alwa, starting off at an easy, desert-eating\namble; and without a word of comment, but with downward glances at their\nswords and a little back-stiffening which was all of excitement that\nthey deigned to show, his men wheeled three and three behind him.\n\nIt was no affair of Alwa's that a full moon shone that night--none of\nhis arranging that on that one night of the month Jaimihr and his most\ntrusted body-guard should go with the priests and the Maharajah to\ninspect the treasure. Alwa was a soldier, born to take instant advantage\nof chance--sent opportunity; Jaimihr was a schemer, born to indecision\nand the cunning that seeks underhanded means but overlooks the obvious.\nBecause the streets were full of men whose allegiance was doubtful yet,\nbecause he himself would be too occupied to sit like a spider in a web\nand watch the intentions of the crowd unfold, Jaimihr had turned out\nevery retainer to his name, and had scattered them about the city, with\norders, if they were needed, to rally on a certain point.\n\nHe did think that at any minute a disturbance might break out which\nwould lead to civil war, and he saw the necessity for watchfulness at\nevery point; but he did not see the rather obvious necessity for\nleaving more than twenty men on guard inside his palace. Not even\nthe thoughtfulness of Siva's priests could have anticipated that ten\nhorse-men would be riding out of nowhere, with the spirit in them that\nignores side issues and leads them only straight to their objective.\n\nAlwa, as a soldier, knew exactly where fresh horses could be borrowed\nwhile his tired ones rested. A little way beyond the outskirts of the\ncity lived a man who was neither Mohammedan nor Hindoo--a fearful man,\nwho took no sides, but paid his taxes, carried on his business, and\nbehaved--a Jew, who dealt in horses and in any other animal or thing\nthat could be bought to show a profit.\n\nAlwa had an utterly complete contempt for Jews, as was right and proper\nin a Rangar of the blood. He had not met many of them, and those he had\nhad borne away the memory of most outrageous insult gratuitously offered\nand rubbed home. But this particular Jew was a money-lender on occasion,\nand his rates had proved as reasonable as his acceptance of Alwa's\nunwritten promise had been prompt. A man who holds his given word as\nsacred as did Alwa respects, in the teeth of custom or religion, the man\nwho accepts that word; so, when the chance had offered, Alwa had done\nthe Jew occasional favors and had won his gratitude. He now counted on\nthe Jew for fresh horses.\n\nTo reach him, he had to wade the Howrah River, less than a mile from\nwhere the burning ghats glowed dull crimson against the sky; the crowd\naround the ghats was the first intimation he received that the\nstreets might prove less densely thronged than usual. It was the Jew,\nbeard-scrabbling and fidgeting among his horses, who reminded him that\nwhen the full moon shone most of the populace, and most of Jaimihr's and\nHowrah's guards, would be occupied near Siva's temple and the palace.\n\nHe left his own horses, groomed again, and gorging their fill of good,\nclean grain in the Jew's ramshackle stable place. Joanna he turned\nloose, to sneak into any rat-hole that she chose. Then, with their\nswords drawn--for if trouble came it would be certain to come\nsuddenly--he and his nine made a wide-ringed circuit of the city, to a\npoint where the main street passing Jaimihr's palace ended in a rune\nof wind-piled desert sand. From the moment when they reached that point\nthey did not waste a second; action trod on the heel of thought and\nthought flashed fast as summer lightning.\n\nThey lit through the deserted street, troubling for speed, not silence;\nthe few whom they passed had no time to determine who they were, and\nno one followed them. A few frightened night-wanderers ran at sight of\nthem, hiding down side streets, but when they brought up at last outside\nJaimihr's palace-gate they had so far escaped recognition. And that\nmeant that no one would carry word to Jaimihr or his men.\n\nIt was death-dark outside the bronze-hinged double gate; only a dim lamp\nhung above from chains, to show how dark it was, and the moon--cut off\nby trees and houses on a bluff of rising ground--lent nothing to the\ngloom.\n\n\"Open! The jaimihr-sahib comes!\" shouted Alwa and one of his horsemen\nlegged up close beside the gate.\n\nSome one moved inside, for his footsteps could be heard; whoever he was\nappeared to listen cautiously.\n\n\"Open for the Jaimihr-sahib!\" repeated Alwa.\n\nEvidently that was not the usual command, or otherwise the gates would\nhave swung open on the instant. Instead, one gate moved inward by a\nfraction of a foot, and a pureed head peered cautiously between the gap.\nThat, though, was sufficient. With a laugh, the man up closest drove\nhis sword-hilt straight between the Hindoo's eyes, driving his horse's\nshoulder up against the gate; three others spurred and shoved beside\nhim. Not thirty seconds later Alwa and his nine were striking hoof\nsparks on the stone of Jaimihr's courtyard, and the gates--that could\nhave easily withstood a hundred-man assault with battering-rams--had\nclanged behind them, bolted tight against their owner.\n\n\"Where is the bear cage?\" demanded Alwa. \"It is a bear I need, not\nblood!\"\n\nThe dozen left inside to guard the palace had recovered quickly enough\nfrom their panic. They were lining up in the middle of the courtyard,\nready to defend their honor, even if the palace should be lost. It was\nbarely probable that Jaimihr's temper would permit them the privilege\nof dying quickly should he come and find his palace looted; a Rangar's\nsword seemed better, and they made ready to die hard.\n\n\"Where's Ali Partab?\"\n\nThere was no answer. The little crowd drew in, and one by one took up\nthe fighting attitude that each man liked the best.\n\n\"I say I did not come for blood! I came for Ali Partab! If I get him,\nunharmed, I ride away again; but otherwise--\"\n\n\"What otherwise?\" asked the captain of the guard.\n\n\"This palace burns!\"\n\nThere was a momentary consultation--no argument, but a quickly reached\nagreement.\n\n\"He is here, unharmed,\" declared the captain gruffly.\n\n\"Bring him out!\"\n\n\"What proof have we that he is all you came for?\"\n\n\"My given word.\"\n\n\"But the Jaimihr-sahib--\"\n\n\"You also have my given word that unless I get Ali Partab this palace\nburns, with all that there is in it!\"\n\nDistrustful still, the captain of the guard called out to a sweeper,\nskulking in the shadow by the stables to go and loose Ali Partab.\n\n\"Send no sweepers to him!\" ordered Alwa. \"He has suffered indignity\nenough. Go thou!\"\n\nThe captain of the guard obeyed. Two minutes later Ali Partab stood\nbefore Alwa and saluted.\n\n\"Sahib, my master's thanks!\"\n\n\"They are accepted,\" answered Alwa, with almost regal dignity. \"Bring a\nlamp!\" he ordered.\n\nOne of the guard brought a hand-lantern, and by its light Alwa examined\nAli Partab closely. He was filthy, and his clothing reeked of the\ndisgusting confinement he had endured.\n\n\"Give this man clothing fit for a man of mine!\" commanded Alwa.\n\n\"Sahib, there is none; perhaps the Jaimihr-sahib--\"\n\n\"I have ordered!\"\n\nThere was a movement among Alwa's men--a concerted, horse-length-forward\nmovement, made terrifying by the darkness--each man knew well enough\nthat the men they were bullying could fight; success, should they have\nto force it at the sword-point, would depend largely on which side took\nthe other by surprise.\n\n\"It is done, sahib,\" said the leader of the guard, and one man hurried\noff to execute the order. Ten minutes later--they were ten impatient\nminutes, during which the horses sensed the fever of anxiety and could\nbe hardly made to stand--Ali Partab stood arrayed in clean, new khaki\nthat fitted him reasonably well.\n\n\"A sword, now!\" demanded Alwa. \"Thy sword! This man had a sword when he\nwas taken! Give him thine, unless there is a better to be had.\"\n\nThere was nothing for it but obedience, for few things were more certain\nthan that Alwa was not there to waste time asking for anything he would\nnot fight for if refused. The guard held out his long sword, hilt first,\nand Ali Partab strapped it on.\n\n\"I had three horses when they took me,\" he asserted, \"three good ones,\nsound and swift, belonging to my master.\"\n\n\"Then take three of Jaimihr's!\"\n\nIt took ten minutes more for Ali Partab and two of Alwa's men to search\nthe stables and bring out the three best chargers of the twenty and\nmore reserved for Jaimihr's private use. They were wonders of horses,\nhalf-Arab and half-native-bred, clean-limbed and firm--worth more, each\none of them, than all three of Mahommed Gunga's put together.\n\n\"Are they good enough?\" demanded Alwa.\n\n\"My master will be satisfied,\" grinned Ali Partab.\n\n\"Open the gate, then!\" Alwa was peering through the blackness for\na sight of firearms, but could see none. He guessed--and he was\nright--that the guard had taken full advantage of their master's\nabsence, and had been gambling in a corner while their rifles rested\nunder cover somewhere else. For a second he hesitated, dallying with the\nnotion of disarming the guard before he left, then decided that a fight\nwas scarcely worth the risking now, and with ten good men behind him he\nwheeled and scooted through the wide-flung gates into outer gloom.\n\nHe galloped none too fast, for his party was barely out of range before\na ragged volley ripped from the palace-wall; one of his men, hampered\nand delayed by a led horse that was trying to break away from him, was\nactually hit, and begged Alwa to ride back and burn the palace after\nall. He was grumbling still about the honor of a Rangar, when Alwa\ncalled a halt in the shelter of a deserted side street in order to\nquestion Ali Partab further.\n\nAli Partab protested that he did not know what to say or think about the\nmissionaries. He explained his orders and vowed that his honor held him\nthere in Howrah until Miss McClean should consent to come away. He did\nnot mention the father; he was a mere side issue--it was Alwa who asked\nafter him.\n\n\"A tick on the belly of an ox rides with the ox,\" said Ali Partab.\n\n\"Lead on, then, to the mission house,\" commanded Alwa, and the ten-man\ntroop proceeded to obey. They had reached the main street again, and\nwere wheeling into it, when Joanna sprang from gutter darkness and\nintercepted them. She was all but ridden down before Ali Partab\nrecognized her.\n\n\"The mohurs, sahib!\" she demanded. \"Three golden mohurs!\"\n\n\"Ay, three!\" said Ali Partab, giving her a hand and yanking her off the\nground. She sprang across his horse's rump behind him, and he seemed to\nhave less compunction about personal defilement than the others had.\n\n\"Is she thy wife or thy mother-in-law?\" laughed Alwa.\n\n\"Nay, sahib, but my creditor! The mother of confusion tells me that the\nMiss-sahib and her father are in Howrah's palace!\"\n\nThey halted, all together in a cluster in the middle of the street--shut\nin by darkness--watched for all they knew, by a hundred enemies.\n\n\"Of their own will or as prisoners?\"\n\n\"As prisoners, sahib.\"\n\n\"Back to the side street! Quickly! Jaimihr' rat's nest is one affair,\"\nhe muttered; \"Howrah' beehive is another!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\n    Now, secrets and things of the Councils of Kings\n    Are deucid expensive to buy,\n    For it wouldn't look nice if a Councillor's price\n    Were anything other than high.\n    Be advised, though, and note that the price they will quote\n    Is less at each grade you go deeper,\n    And--(Up on its toes it's the Underworld knows!)--\n    The cheapest of all is the Sweeper.\n\nJOANNA--when Alwa forgot about her and loosed her to run just where she\nchose--had sneaked, down alleys and over roof-tops, straight for the\nmission house. She found there nothing but a desultory guard and an\nimpression, rather than the traces, of an empty cage. About two\nminutes of cautious questioning of neighbors satisfied her where the\nmissionaries were; nothing short of death seemed able to deprive her of\nability to flit like a black bat through the shadows, and the distance\nto Howrah's palace was accomplished, by her usual bat's entry route,\nin less time than a pony would have taken by the devious street. Before\nAlwa had thundered on Jaimihr's gate Joanna had mingled in the crowd\noutside the palace and was shrewdly questioning again.\n\nShe arrived too late to see McClean and his daughter seized; what she\ndid hear was that they were prisoners, and that the Maharajah, Jaimihr,\nand the priests were all of them engaged in the secret ceremony\nwhose beginning was a monthly spectacle but whose subsequent\ndevelopments--supposed to be somewhere in the bowels of the earth--were\nknown only to the men who held the key.\n\nLike a rat running in the wainscot holes, she tried to follow the\nprocession; like everybody else, she knew the way it took from the\npalace gate, and--as few others were--she was aware of a scaling-place\non the outer wall where a huge baobab drooped century-scarred branches\nnearly to the ground on either side. The sacred monkeys used that route\nand where they went Joanna could contrive to follow.\n\nIt was another member of the sweeper caste, lurking in the darkness\nof an inner courtyard, who pointed out the bronze-barred door to her\nthrough which the treasure guardians had chanted on their way; it was\nhe, too, who told her that Rosemary McClean and her father had been\nrushed into the palace through the main entrance. Also, he informed her\nthat there was no way--positively no way practicable even for a monkey\nor a bird--of following further. He was a sweeper-intimate acquaintance\nof creeper ladders, trap-doors, gutters drains, and byways; she realized\nat once that there would be no wisdom in attempting to find within an\nhour what he had not discovered in a lifetime.\n\nSo Joanna, her beady eyes glittering between the wrinkled folds of skin,\nslunk deeper in a shadow and began to think. She, the looker-on, had\nseen the whole play from its first beginning and could judge at least\nthat part of it which had its bearing on her missionary masters. First,\nshe knew what Jaimihr's ambition was--every man in Howrah knew how he\nplanned to seize Miss McClean when the moment should be propitious--and\nher Eastern wisdom warned her that Jaimihr, foiled, would stop at\nnothing to contrive vengeance. If he could not seize Miss McClean, he\nwould be likely to use every means within his power to bring about her\ndeath and prevent another from making off with his prize. Jaimihr, then,\nwas the most pressing danger.\n\nSecond, as a Hindoo, she knew well how fiendishly the priests loathed\nthe Christian missionaries; and it was common knowledge that the\nMaharajah was cross-hobbled by the priests. The Maharajah was a fearful\nman, and, unless the priests and Jaimihr threatened him with a show\nof combination, there was a slight chance that he might dread British\nvengeance too much to dare permit violence to the McCleans. Possibly he\nmight hold out against the priests alone; but before an open alliance\nbetween Jaimihr and the priests he would surrender for his own throne's\nsake.\n\nSo far Joanna could reason readily enough, for there was a vast fund of\nwisdom stored beneath her wrinkled ugliness. But her Eastern limitation\nstopped her there. She could not hold loyalty to more than one cause,\nor to more than one offshoot of that cause, in the same shrewd head at\nonce. She decided that at all costs Jaimihr must be out of the way so\nthat the Maharaja might be left to argue with the priests alone. For the\nmoment no other thought occurred to her.\n\nThe means seemed ready to her hand. A peculiarity of the East, which is\ndemocratic in most ways under the veneer of swaggering autocracy, that\nservants of the very lowest caste may speak, and argue on occasion, with\nmen who would shudder at the prospect of defilement from their touch.\nThere was nothing in the least outrageous in the proposition that the\nsweeper, waiting in a corner for the procession to emerge again so that\nhe might curl on his mat and sleep undisturbed when it had gone, should\ndare to approach Jaimihr and address him. He would run no small risk\nof being beaten by the guards; but, on the other hand, should he catch\njaimihr's ear and interest him, he would be safe.\n\n\"Wouldst thou win Jaimihr's favor?\" asked Joanna, creeping up beside\nhim, and whispering with all the suggestiveness she could assume.\n\n\"Who would not? Who knows that within week he will not be ruler?\"\n\n\"True. I have a message for him. I must hurry back. Deliver it for me.\"\n\n\"What would be the nature of the message?\"\n\n\"This. His prisoner is gone. A raid has taken place. In his absence,\nwhile his men patrolled the city, certain Rangars broke into his\npalace--looted--and prepared to burn. Bid him hurry back with all the\nmen he can collect.\"\n\n\"From whom is this message?\"\n\n\"From the captain of the guard.\"\n\n\"And I am to deliver it? Thou dodderest! Mother of a murrain, have I not\ntrouble sufficient for one man? Who bears bad news to a prince, or to\nany but his enemy? I--with these two eyes--I saw what happened to the\nmen who bore bad news to Howrah once. I--with this broom of mine--I\nhelped clean up the mess. Deliver thine own message!\"\n\n\"Nay. Afterward I will say this--to the Jaimihr-sahib in person. There\nis one, I will tell him, a sweeper in the palace, who refused to bear\ntidings when the need was great.\"\n\n\"If his palace is burned and his wealth all ashes, who cares what\nJaimihr hears?\"\n\n\"There is no glow yet in the sky,\" said Joanna looking up. \"The palace\nis not yet in flames; they loot still.\"\n\n\"What if it be not true?\"\n\n\"Will Jaimihr not be glad?\"\n\n\"Glad to see me, the bearer of false news, impaled--or crushed beneath\nan elephant--ay--glad, indeed.\"\n\n\"The reward, were the Jaimihr-sahib warned in time, would be a great\none.\"\n\n\"Then, why waitest thou not to have word with him. Art thou above\nrewards?\"\n\n\"Have no fear! He will know in good time who it was brought thee the\nnews.\"\n\nThey argued for ten minutes, Joanna threatening and coaxing and\npromising rewards, until at last the man consented. It was the thought,\nthoroughly encouraged by Joanna, that the penalty for not speaking would\nbe greater than the beating he might get for bearing evil news that\nat last convinced him; and it was not until she had won him over and\nassured herself that he would not fail that it dawned on Joanna just\nwhat an edged tool she was playing with. While getting rid of Jaimihr,\nshe was endangering the liberty and life of Alwa--the one man able to do\nanything for the McCleans!\n\nThat thought sent her scooting over housetops, diving down dark\nalleyways, racing, dodging, hiding, dashing on again, and brought her\nin the nick of time to a ditch, from whose shelter she sprang and seized\nthe hand of Ali Partab. That incident, and her intimation that the\nmissionaries were in Howrah's palace, took Alwa back up the black, blind\nside street; and before he emerged from it he saw Jaimihr and his ten go\nthundering past, their eyes on the sky-line for a hint of conflagration,\nand their horses--belly-to-the-earth--racing as only fear, or\nenthusiasm, or grim desperation in their riders' minds can make them\nrace.\n\nA little later, in groups and scattered fours, and one by one, his\nheavy-breathing troopers followed, cursing the order that had sent\nthem abroad with-out their horses, damning--as none but a dismounted\ncavalryman can damn--the earth's unevenness, their swords, their luck,\ntheir priests, the night, their boots, and Jaimihr. Forewarned, Alwa\nheld on down the pitch-dark side street, into whose steep-sided chasm\nthe moon's rays would not reach for an hour or two to come, and once\nagain he led his party in a sweeping, wide-swung circle, loose-reined\nand swifter than the silent night wind--this time for Howrah's palace.\nThere was his given word, plighted to Mahommed Gunga, to redeem.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\n    Ha! my purse may be lean, but my 'scutcheon is clean,\n    And I'm backed by a dozen true men;\n    I've a sword to my name, and a wrist for the same;\n    Can a king frown fear into me, then?\n\nIT is the privilege of emperors, and kings and princes, that--however\nlittle real authority they have, or however much their power is\nundermined by men behind the throne--they must be accorded dignity. They\nmust be, on the face of things, obeyed.\n\n\nInspection of the treasure finished and an hour-long mummery of rites\nperformed, the thirty wound their way, chanting, in single file back\nagain. The bronze-enforced door, that was only first of half a hundred\nbarriers between approach and the semi-sacred hoard, at last clanged\nshut and was locked with three locks, each of whose individual keys was\nin the keeping of a separate member of the three--Maharajah, Prince, and\npriest. The same keys fitted every door of the maze--made passages, but\nno one door would open without all three.\n\nSpeaking like an omen from the deepest shadow, the sweeper called to\nJaimihr.\n\n\"Sahib, thy palace burns! Sahib, thy prisoner runs! Haste, sahib! Call\nthy men and hasten back! Thy palace is in flames--the Rangars come to--\"\n\nAs a raven, disturbed into night omen-croaking, he sent forth his news\nfrom utter blackness into nerve-strung tension. No one member of the\nthirty but was on the alert for friction or sudden treachery; the were\nall eyes for each other, and the croaking fell on ears strained to the\naching point. He had time to repeat his warning before one of Jaimihr's\nmen stepped into the darkness where he hid and dragged him out.\n\n\"Sahib, a woman came but now and brought the news. It was from the\ncaptain of the guard. The Rangars came to take their man away. They\nbroke in. They burn. They loot. They--\"\n\nBut Jaimihr did not wait another instant to hear the rest. To him this\nseemed like the scheming of his brother. Now he imagined he could read\nbetween the lines! That letter sent to Alwa had been misreported to\nhim, and had been really a call to come and free the prisoner and wreak\nRangar vengeance! He understood! But first he must save his palace, if\nit could be saved. The priests must have deceived him, so he wasted no\ntime in arguing with them; he ran, with his guards behind him, to the\nouter wall of Siva's temple where the horses waited, each with a saice\nsquatting at his head. The saices were sent scattering among the crowd\nto give the alarm and send the rest of his contingent hurrying back;\nJaimihr and his ten drove home their spurs, and streaked, as the\nfrightened jackal runs when a tiger interrupts them at their worry,\nhell-bent-for-leather up the unlit street.\n\nThen Maharajah Howrah's custom-accorded dignity stood him in good stead.\nIt flashed across his worried brain that space had been given him by the\ngods in which to think. Jaimihr--one facet of the problem and\nperhaps the sharpest--would have his hands full for a while, and the\npriests--wish how they would--would never dare omit the after-ritual in\nSiva's temple. He--untrammelled for an hour to come--might study out a\ncourse to take and hold with those embarrassing prisoners of his.\n\nHe turned--updrawn in regal stateliness--and intimated to the high\npriest that the ceremony might proceed without him. When the priests\ndemurred and murmured, he informed them that he would be pleased to give\nthem audience when the ritual was over, and without deigning another\nargument he turned through a side door into the palace.\n\nWithin ten minutes he was seated in his throne-room. One minute later\nhis prisoners stood in front of him, still holding each other's hands,\nand the guard withdrew. The great doors opening on the marble outer hall\nclanged tight, and in this room there were no carved screens through\nwhich a hidden, rustling world might listen. There was gold-incrusted\nsplendor--there were glittering, hanging ornaments that far outdid the\npeacocks' feathers of the canopy above the throne; but the walls were\nsolid, and the marble floor rang hard and true.\n\nThere was no nook or corner anywhere that could conceal a man. For a\nminute, still bejewelled in his robes of state and glittering as the\ndiamonds in his head-dress caught the light from half a dozen hanging\nlamps, the Maharajah sat and gazed at them, his chin resting on one hand\nand his silk-clad elbow laid on the carved gold arm of his throne.\n\n\"Why am I troubled?\" he demanded suddenly.\n\n\"You know!\" said the missionary. His daughter clutched his hand tightly,\npartly to reassure him, partly because she knew that a despot would be\nbearded now in his gold-bespattered den, and fear gripped her.\n\n\"Maharajah-sahib, when I came here with letters from the government of\nIndia and asked you for a mission house in which to live and work, I\ntold you that I came as a friend--as a respectful sympathizer. I told\nyou I would not incite rebellion against you, and that I would not\ninterfere with native custom or your authority so long as acquiescence\nand obedience by me did not run counter to the overriding law of the\nBritish Government.\"\n\nHowrah did not even move his head in token that he listened, but his\ntired eyes answered.\n\n\"To that extent I promised not to interfere with your religion.\"\n\nHowrah nodded.\n\n\"Once--twice--in all nine times--I came and warned you that the practice\nof suttee was and is illegal. My knowledge of Sanskrit is only slight,\nbut there are others of my race who have had opportunity to translate\nthe Sanskrit Vedas, and I have in writing what they found in them. I\nwarned you, when that information reached me, that your priests have\nbeen deliberately lying to you--that the Vedas say: 'Thrice-blessed is\nshe who dies of a broken heart because her lord and master leaves her.'\nThey say nothing, absolutely nothing, about suttee or its practice,\nwhich from the beginning has been a damnable invention of the priests.\nBut the practice of suttee has continued. I have warned the government\nfrequently, in writing, but for reasons which I do not profess to\nunderstand they have made no move as yet. For that reason, and for no\nother, I have tried to be a thorn in your side, and will continue to try\nto be until this suttee ceases!\"\n\n\"Why,\" demanded Howrah, \"since you are a foreigner with neither\ninfluence nor right, do you stay here and behold what you cannot\nchange? Does a snake lie sleeping on an ant-hill? Does a woman watch the\nbutchering of lambs? Yet, do ant-hills cease to be, and are lambs not\nbutchered? Look the other way! Sleep softer in another place!\"\n\n\"I am a prisoner. For months past my daughter and I have been prisoners\nto all intents and purposes, and you, Maharajah-sahib, have known it\nwell. Now, the one man who was left to be our escort to another place is\na prisoner, too. You know that, too. And you ask me why I stay! Suppose\nyou answer?\"\n\nRosemary squeezed his hand again, this time less to restrain him than\nherself. She was torn between an inclination to laugh at the daring or\nshiver at the indiscretion of taking to task a man whose one word could\nplace them at the mercy of the priests of Siva, or the mob. But\nDuncan McClean, a little bowed about the shoulders, peered through\nhis spectacles and waited--quite unawed by all the splendor--for the\nMaharajah's answer.\n\n\"Of what man do you speak?\" asked Howrah, still undecided what to do\nwith them, and anxious above all things to disguise his thoughts. \"What\nman is a prisoner, and how do you know it?\"\n\nBefore McClean had time to answer him, a spear haft rang on the great\nteak double door. There was a pause, and the clang repeated--another\npause--a third reverberating, humming metal notice of an interruption,\nand the doors swung wide. A Hindoo, salaaming low so that the expression\nof his face could not be seen, called out down the long length of the\nhall.\n\n\"The Alwa-sahib waits, demanding audience!\" There was no change apparent\non Howrah's face. His fingers tightened on the jewelled cimeter that\nprotruded, silk-sashed, from his middle, but neither voice nor eyes nor\nlips betrayed the least emotion. It was the McCleans whose eyes blazed\nwith a new-born hope, that was destined to be dashed a second later.\n\n\"Has he guards with him?\"\n\n\"But ten, Maharajah-sahib.\"\n\n\"Then remove these people to the place where they were, and afterward\nadmit him--without his guards!\"\n\n\"I demand permission to speak with this Alwa-sahib!\" said McClean.\n\n\"Remove them!\"\n\nTwo spear-armed custodians of the door advanced. Resistance was\nobviously futile. Still holding his daughter's hand, the missionary let\nhimself be led to the outer hall and down a corridor, where, presently,\na six-inch door shut prisoners and guards even from sound of what\ntranspired beyond.\n\nAlwa, swaggering until his long spurs jingled like a bunch of keys\neach time his boot-heels struck the marble floor, strode straight as\na soldier up to the raised throne dais--took no notice whatever of\nthe sudden slamming of the door behind him--looked knife-keenly into\nHowrah's eyes--and saluted with a flourish.\n\n\"I come from bursting open Jaimihr's buzzard roost!\" he intimated\nmildly. \"He held a man of mine. I have the man.\"\n\nMerely to speak first was insolence; but that breach of etiquette was\nnothing to his manner and his voice. It appeared that he was so utterly\nconfident of his own prowess that he could afford to speak casually; he\ndid not raise his voice or emphasize a word. He was a man of his word,\nrelating facts, and every line of his steel-thewed anatomy showed it.\n\n\"I sent a letter to you, by horseman, with a present,\" said Howrah. \"I\nawait the answer.\"\n\nAlwa's eyes changed, and his attention stiffened. Not having been\nat home, he knew nothing of the letter, but he did not choose to\nacknowledge the fact. The principle that one only shares the truth with\nfriends is good, when taken by surprise.\n\n\"I preferred to have confirmation of the matter from the Maharajah's\nlips in person, so--since I had this other matter to attend to--I\ncombined two visits in one trip.\"\n\nHe lied, as he walked and fought, like a soldier, and the weary man who\nwatched him from the throne detected no false ring.\n\n\"I informed you that I had extended my protection to the two\nmissionaries, man and daughter.\"\n\n\"You did. Also, you did well.\" He tossed that piece of comfort to the\ndespot as a man might throw table scraps to a starveling dog! \"I have\ncome to take away the missionaries.\"\n\n\"With a guard of ten!\"\n\nIt was the first admission of astonishment that either man had made.\n\n\"Are you not aware that Jaimihr, too, has eyes on the woman?\"\n\n\"I am aware of it. I have shown Jaimihr how deep my fear of him lies! I\nknow, too, how deep the love lies between thee and thy brother, king of\nHowrah! I am here to remind you that many more than ten men would\nrace their horses to a stand-still to answer my summons--brave men,\nMaharajah-sahib--men whose blades are keen, and straightly held, and\ntrue. They who would rally round me against Jaimihr would--\"\n\n\"Would fight for me?\"\n\n\"I have not yet said so.\" There was a little, barely accentuated\nemphasis on the one word \"yet.\" The Maharajah thought a minute before he\nanswered.\n\n\"How many mounted troopers could you raise?\"\n\n\"Who knows? A thousand--three thousand--according to the soreness of the\nneed.\"\n\n\"You have heard--I know that you have heard--what, even at this minute,\nawaits the British? I know, for I have taken care to know, that a cousin\nof yours--Mahommed Gunga--is interested for the British. So--so I am\ninterested to have word with you.\"\n\nAlwa laughed ironically.\n\n\"And the tiger asked the wolf pack where good hunting was!\" he mocked.\n\"I and my men strike which way suits us when the hour comes.\"\n\n\"My palace has many chambers in it!\" hinted Howrah. \"There have been men\nwho wondered what the light of day was like, having long ago forgotten!\"\n\n\"Make me prisoner!\" laughed Alwa. \"Count then the hours until three\nthousand blades join Jaimihr and help him grease the dungeon hinges with\nthy fat!\"\n\n\"Having looted Jaimihr's palace, you speak thus?\"\n\n\"Having whipped a dog, I wait for the dog to lick my hand.\"\n\n\"What is your purpose with these missionaries?\"\n\n\"To redeem my given word.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"I would be free to pledge it again.\"\n\n\"To me?\"\n\n\"To whom I choose.\"\n\n\"I will give thee the missionaries, against thy word to fight on my side\nwhen the hour comes.\"\n\n\"Against whom?\"\n\n\"The British.\"\n\n\"I have no quarrel with the British, yet.\"\n\n\"I will give thee the missionaries, against thy word to support me on\nthis throne.\"\n\n\"Against whom?\"\n\n\"Against all comers.\"\n\n\"If I refuse, what then?\"\n\n\"Jaimihr--who by this time must surely be thy very warmest\nfriend!--shall attack thee unmolested. Pledge thy word--take thy\nmissionary people--and Jaimihr must oppose thee and me combined.\"\n\n\"Should Jaimihr ride after me, what then?\"\n\n\"If he takes many with him, he must leave his camp unguarded, or only\nweakly guarded. Then I would act. If he goes with few, how can he take\nthy castle?\"\n\n\"Then I have your protection against Jaimihr, and the missionaries,\nagainst my promise to support you on the throne?\"\n\n\"My word on it.\"\n\n\"And mine.\"\n\nHowrah rose, stepped forward to the dais edge, and held his hand out.\n\n\"Nay!\" swore Alwa, recoiling. \"My word is given. I take no Hindoo's\nhand!\"\n\nHowrah glared for a moment, but thought better of the hot retort that\nrose to his lips. Instead he struck a silver gong, and when the doors\nswung open ordered the prisoners to be produced.\n\n\"Escape through the palace-grounds,\" he advised Alwa. \"A man of mine\nwill show the way.\"\n\n\"Remember!\" said Alwa across his shoulder with more than royal\ninsolence, \"I swore to help thee against Jaimihr and to support thee on\nthy throne--but in nothing did I swear to be thy tool--remember!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\n    Howrah City bows the knee\n    (More or less) to masters three,\n    King, and Prince, and Siva.\n    Howrah City comes and goes--\n    Buys and sells--and never knows\n    Which is friend, and which are foes--\n            King, or Prince, or Siva.\n\n\nTHAT that followed Alwa's breakaway was all but the tensest hour in\nHowrah City's history. The inevitable--the foiled rage of the priests\nand Jaimihr's impudent insistence that the missionaries should be handed\nover to him--the Maharajah's answer--all combined to set the murmurings\nafoot. Men said that the threatened rebellion against the rule of\nBritain had broken loose at last, and a dozen other quite as false and\nequally probable things.\n\nJaimihr, finding that his palace was intact, and that only the prisoner\nand three horses from his stable were missing, placed the whole guard\nunder arrest--stormed futilely, while his hurrying swarm flocked to him\nthrough the dinning streets--and then, mad-angry and made reckless by\nhis rage, rode with a hundred at his back to Howrah's palace, scattering\nthe bee-swarm of inquisitive but so far peaceful citizens right and\nleft.\n\nWith little ceremony, he sent in word to Howrah that he wanted Alwa and\nthe missionaries; he stated that his private honor was at stake, and\nthat he would stop at nothing to wreak vengeance. He wanted the man who\nhad dared invade his palace--the man whom he had released--and the\ntwo who were the prime cause of the outrage. And with just as little\nceremony word came out that the Maharajah would please himself as to\nwhat he did with prisoners.\n\nThat message was followed almost instantly by the high priest of Siva\nin person, angry as a turkey-gobbler and blasphemously vindictive. He\nit was who told Jaimihr of the unexpected departure through the\npalace-grounds.\n\n\"Ride, Jaimihr-sahib! Ride!\" he advised him.\n\n\"How many have you? A hundred? Plenty! Ride and cut him off! There is\nbut one road to Alwa's place; he must pass by the northern ford through\nHowrah River. Ride and cut him off!\"\n\nSo, loose-reined, foam-flecked, breathing vengeance, Jaimihr and his\nhundred thundered through the dark hot night, making a bee-line for the\npoint where Alwa's band must pass in order to take the shortest route to\nsafety.\n\nIt was his word to the Jew that saved Alwa's neck. He and his men were\nriding borrowed horses, and he had promised to return them and reclaim\nhis own. They had moved at a walk through winding, dark palace-alleys,\nled by a palace attendant, and debouched through a narrow door that gave\nbarely horse-room into the road where Jaimihr had once killed a Maharati\ntrader who molested Rosemary McClean. The missionary and his daughter\nwere mounted on the horses seized in Jaimihr's stable; Joanna, moaning\nabout \"three gold mohurs, sahib--three, where are they?\" was up behind\nAli Partab, tossed like a pea on a drum-skin by the lunging movements of\nthe wonder of a horse.\n\nInstead of heading straight for home, in which case--although he did not\nknow it--he would have been surely overhauled and brought to bay, he led\nat a stiff hand gallop to the Jew's, changed horses, crossed the ford by\nthe burning ghats, and swooped in a wide half-circle for the sandy trail\nthat would take him homeward. He made the home road miles beyond the\npoint where Jaimihr waited for him--drew rein into the long-striding\namble that desert-taught horses love--and led on, laughing.\n\n\"Ho!\" He laughed. \"Ho-ho! Here, then, is the end of Mahommed Gunga's\nscheming! Now, when he comes with arguments to make me fight on the\nBritish side, what a tale I have for him! Ho! What a swearing there will\nbe! I will give him his missionary people, and say, 'There, Mahommed\nGunga, cousin mine, there is my word redeemed--there is thy man into the\nbargain--there are three horses for thee--and I--I am at Howrah's beck\nand call!' Allah! What a swearing there will be!\"\n\nThere was swearing, viler and more blasphemous than any of which\nMahommed Gunga might be capable, where Jaimihr waited in the dark. He\nwaited until the yellow dawn broke up the first dim streaks of violet\nbefore he realized that Alwa had given him the slip; and he cursed even\nthe high priest of Siva when that worthy accosted him and asked what\ntidings.\n\n\"Another trick!\" swore Jaimihr. \"So, thou and thy temple rats saw fit to\nsend me packing for the night! What devils' tricks have been hatched out\nin my absence?\"\n\nThe high priest started to protest, but Jaimihr silenced him with\ncoarse-mouthed threats.\n\n\"I, too, can play double when occasion calls for it!\" he swore. And with\nthat hint at coming trouble he clattered on home to his palace.\n\nTo begin with, when he reached home, he had the guard beaten all but\nunconscious for having dared let raiders in during the night before;\nthen he sent them, waterless and thirsty, back to the dungeon. He felt\nbetter then, and called for ink and paper.\n\nFor hours he thought and wrote alternately, tearing up letter after\nletter. Then, at last, he read over a composition that satisfied him and\nset his seal at the foot. He placed the whole in a silver tube, poured\nwax into the joint, and called for the fat man who had been responsible\nfor Ali Partab's capture.\n\n\"Dog!\" he snarled. \"Interfering fool! All this was thy doing! Didst thou\nsee the guard beaten awhile ago?\"\n\n\"I did. It was a lordly beating. The men are all but dead but will live\nfor such another one.\"\n\n\"Wouldst thou be so beaten?\"\n\n\"How can I prevent, if your highness wishes?\"\n\n\"Take this. It is intended for Peshawur but may be given to any British\nofficer above the rank of major. It calls for a receipt. Do not dare\ncome back, or be caught in Howrah City, without a receipt for that tube\nand its contents intact!\"\n\n\"If Alwa and Mahommed Gunga are in league with my brother,\" muttered\nJaimihr to himself when the fat Hindoo had gone, \"then the sooner the\nBritish quarrel with both of them the better. Howrah alone I can dispose\nof easily enough, and there is yet time before rebellion starts for the\nBritish to spike the guns of the other two. By the time that is done, I\nwill be Maharajah!\"\n\nIt was less than three days later when the word came mysteriously\nthrough the undiscoverable \"underground\" route of India for all men to\nbe ready.\n\n\"By the next full moon,\" went the message, from the priests alone knew\nwhere, \"all India will be waiting. When the full moon rises then the\nhour is come!\"\n\n\"And when that full moon rises,\" thought Jaimihr to himself, \"my\nbrother's funeral rites will be past history!\"\n\nFor the present, though, he made believe to regret his recent rage, and\nwas courteous to priest and Maharajah alike--even sending to his brother\nto apologize.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\n    They've called thee by an evil word,\n            They've named thee traitor, friend o' mine.\n    Thou askest faith?  I send my sword.\n            There is no greater, friend o' mine.\n\n\nRALPH CUNNINGHAM said good-by to Brigadier-General Byng (Byng the\nBrigadier) with more feeling of regret and disappointment than he cared\nto show. A born soldier, he did his hard-mouthed utmost to refrain\nfrom whining; he even pretended that a political appointment was\na recognizable advance along the road to sure success--or, rather,\npretended that he thought it was; and the Brigadier, who knew men, and\nparticularly young men, detected instantly the telltale expression\nof the honest gray eyes--analyzed it--and, to Cunningham's amazement,\napproved the unwilling make-believe.\n\n\"Now, buck up, Cunningham!\" he said, slapping him familiarly on the\nshoulder. \"You're making a good, game effort to hide chagrin, and you're\na good, game ass for your pains. There isn't one man in all India who\nhas half your luck at this minute, if you only knew it; but go ahead\nand find out for yourself! Go to Abu and report, but waste no more time\nthere than you can help. Hurry on to Howrah, and once you're there, if\nMahommed Gunga tells you what looks like a lie, trust him to the hilt!\"\n\n\"Is he coming with me, then?\" asked Cunningham in some amazement.\n\n\"Yes--unofficially. He has relations in that neighborhood and wants to\nvisit them; he is going to take advantage of your pack-train and escort.\nYou'll have a small escort as far as Abu; after that you'll be expected\nto look out for yourself. The escort is made up of details travelling\ndown-country; they'll leave you at Abu Road.\"\n\nSo, still unbelieving--still wondering why the Brigadier should go\nto all that trouble to convince him that politics in a half-forgotten\nnative state were fair meat for a soldier--Cunningham rode off at the\nhead of a variously made-up travelling party, grudging every step of\nthat wonderful mare Mahommed Gunga had given him, that bore him away\nfrom the breeze-swept north--away from the mist-draped hills he had\nalready learned to love--ever down, down, down into the hell-baked\nplains.\n\nEach rest-house where he spent a night was but another brooding-place\nof discontent and regret, each little petty detail connected with the\ncommand of the motley party (mainly time-expired men, homeward bound),\nwas drudgery; each Hindoo pugree that he met was but a beastly contrast,\nor so it seemed to him, to the turbans of the troop that but a week ago\nhad thundered at his back.\n\nMore than any other thing, Mahommed Gunga's cheerfulness amazed him. He\nresented it. He did not see why the man who had expressed such interest\nin the good fortune of his father's son should not be sympathetic now\nthat his soldier career had been nipped so early in the bud. He began to\nlose faith in Mahommed Gunga's wisdom, and was glad when the ex-Risaldar\nchose to bring up the rear of the procession instead of riding by his\nside.\n\nBut behind, in Peshawur, there was one man at least who knew Mahommed\nGunga and his worth, and who refused to let himself be blinded by any\nsort of circumstantial evidence. The evidence was black--in black on\nwhite--written by a black-hearted schemer, and delivered by a big, fat\nblack man, who was utterly road-weary, to the commissioner in person.\n\nThe sepoy mutiny that had been planned so carefully had started to take\ncharge too soon. News had arrived of native regiments whose officers\nhad been obliged against their will to disarm and disband them, and the\nloyalty of other regiments was seriously called in question.\n\nBut the men whose blindness was responsible for the possibility of\nmutiny were only made blinder by the evidence of coming trouble. With\na dozen courses open to them, any one of which might have saved\nthe situation, they deliberately chose a thirteenth--two-forked\ntoboggan-slide into destruction. To prove their misjudged confidence in\nthe native army, they actually disbanded the irregulars led by Byng\nthe Brigadier--removed the European soldiers wherever possible\nfrom ammunition-magazine guard-duty, replacing them with native\ncompanies--and reprimanded the men whose clear sight showed them how\nevents were shaping.\n\nThey reprimanded Byng, as though depriving him of his command were not\nenough. When he protested, as he had a right to do, they showed him\nJaimihr's letter.\n\n\"Mahommed Gunga told you, did he? Look at this!\"\n\nThe letter, most concisely and pointedly written, considering the\nindirect phraseology and caution of the East, deliberately accused\nMahommed Gunga and a certain Alwa, together with all the Rangars of\na whole province, of scheming with Maharajah Howrah to overthrow the\nBritish rule. It recommended the immediate arrest of Mahommed Gunga and\nstern measures against the Rangars.\n\n\"What do you propose to do about it?\" inquired Byng.\n\n\"It's out of our province. A copy of this letter has been sent to the\nproper quarter, and no doubt the story will be investigated. There have\nbeen all kinds of stories about suttee being practised in Howrah, and it\nvery likely won't be difficult to find a plausible excuse for deposing\nthe Maharajah and putting Jaimihr in his place. In the meantime, if\nMahommed Gunga shows himself in these parts he'll be arrested.\"\n\nByng did then the sort of thing that was fortunately characteristic of\nthe men who rose in the nick of time to seize the reins. He hurried to\nhis quarters, packed in its case the sword of honor that had once been\ngiven him by his Queen, and despatched it without a written line of\ncomment to Mahommed Gunga. The native who took it was ordered to ride\nlike the devil, overtake Mahommed Gunga on the road to Abu, present the\nsword without explanation, and return.\n\nCunningham, in spite of himself, had travelled swiftly. The moon lacked\ntwo nights of being full and two more days would have seen him climbing\nup the fourteen-mile rock road that leads up the purple flanks of Abu,\nwhen the ex-trooper of Irregulars cantered from a dust cloud, caught up\nMahommed Gunga, who was riding, as usual, in the rear, and handed him\nthe sword. He held it out with both hands. Mahommed Gunga seized it by\nthe middle, and neither said a word for the moment.\n\nIn silence Mahommed Gunga drew the blade--saw Byng's name engraved close\nto the hilt--recognized the sword, and knew the sender--thought--and\nmistook the meaning.\n\n\"Was there no word?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Then take this word back. 'I will return the sword, with honor added to\nit, when the peace of India is won.' Say that, and nothing else.\"\n\n\"I would rest my horse for a day or two,\" said the trooper.\n\n\"Neither thou nor yet thy horse will have much rest this side of Eblis!\"\nsaid Mahommed Gunga. \"Ride!\"\n\nThe trooper wheeled and went with a grin and a salute which he repeated\ntwice, leaning back from the saddle for a last look at the man of his\nown race whom Byng had chosen to exalt. He felt himself honored merely\nto have carried the sword. Mahommed Gunga removed his own great sabre\nand handed it to one of his own five whom he overtook; then he buckled\non the sword of honor and spurred until he rode abreast of Cunningham, a\nhundred yards or more ahead of the procession.\n\n\"Sahib,\" he asked, \"did Byng-bahadur say a word or two about listening\nto me?\"\n\n\"He did. Why?\"\n\n\"Because I will now say things!\"\n\nThe fact that the Brigadier had sent no message other than the sword\nwas probably the Rajput's chief reason for talking in riddles still\nto Cunningham. The silence went straight to his Oriental heart--so\nto speak, set the key for him to play to. But he knew, too, that\nCunningham's youth would be a handicap should it come to argument; what\nhe was looking for was not a counsellor or some one to make plans, for\nthe plans had all been laid and cross-laid by the enemy, and Mahommed\nGunga knew it. He needed a man of decision--to be flung blindfold into\nunexpected and unexpecting hell wrath, who would lead, take charge,\ndecide on the instant, and lead the way out again, with men behind him\nwho would recognize decision when they saw it. So he spoke darkly.\nHe understood that the sword meant \"Things have started,\" so with a\nsoldier's courage he proceeded to head Cunningham toward the spot where\nhell was loose.\n\n\"Say ahead!\" smiled Cunningham.\n\n\"Yonder, sahib, lies Abu. Yonder to the right lies thy road now, not\nforward.\"\n\n\"I have orders to report at Abu.\"\n\n\"And I, sahib, orders to advise!\"\n\n\"Are you advising me to disobey orders?\"\n\nThe Rajput hesitated. \"Sahib, have I anything to gain,\" he asked, \"by\noffering the wrong advice?\"\n\n\"I can't imagine so.\"\n\n\"I advise, now, that we--thou and I, sahib, and my five turn off\nhere--yonder, where the other trail runs--letting the party proceed to\nAbu without us.\"\n\n\"But why, Mahommed Gunga?\"\n\n\"There is need of haste, sahib. At Abu there will be delay--much talk\nwith Everton-sahib, and who knows?--perhaps cancellation of the plan to\nsend thee on to Howrah.\"\n\n\"I'd be damned glad, Mahommed Gunga, not to have to go there!\"\n\n\"Sahib, look! What is this I wear?\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"See here, sahib--this.\"\n\nFor the first time Cunningham noticed the fine European workmanship on\nthe sword-hilt, and realized that the Rajput's usual plain, workmanlike\nweapon had been replaced.\n\n\"That is Byng-bahadur's sword of honor! It reached me a few minutes ago.\nThe man who brought it is barely out of sight. It means, sahib, that the\nhour to act is come!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Sahib--this sending thee to Howrah is my doing? Since the day when I\nfirst heard that the son of Pukka Cunnigan-bahadur was on his way I have\nschemed and planned and contrived to this end. It was at word from me\nthat Byng-bahadur signed the transfer papers--otherwise he would have\nkept thee by him. There are owls--old women--men whom Allah has deprived\nof judgment--drunkards--fools--in charge at Peshawur and in other\nplaces; but there are certain men who know. Byng-bahadur knows. I\nknow--and I will show the way! Let me lead, sahib, for a little while,\nand I will show thee what to lead!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Does this sword, sahib, mean nothing? Did Byng-bahadur send it me for\nfun?\"\n\n\"But what's the idea? I can't disobey orders, and ride off to--God\nknows where--without some excuse. You'll have to tell me why. What's the\nmatter? What's happening?\"\n\n\"Byng-bahadur sent not one word to me when he sent this sword. To thee\nhe said: 'Listen to Mahommed Gunga, even when he seems to lie!' I\nknow that, for he told me he had said it. To me he said: 'Take charge,\nMahommed Gunga, when the hour comes, and rub his innocent young nose\nhard as you like into the middle of the mess!' Ay, sahib, so said he. It\nis now that I take charge.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"'But,' said the nylghau, and the wolf-pack had him! 'But,' said the\ntiger, and the trap door shut! 'But,' said the Hindoo, and a priest\nbetrayed him! But--but--but--I never knew thy father make much use of\nthat word!\"\n\n\"Yes--but--I have my orders, Mahommed Gunga!\"\n\n\"Sahib--this sword is a sword of honor--it stands for Byng-bahadur's\nhonor. I have it in my keeping. Mine own honor is a matter somewhat\ndear to me, and I have kept it clean these many years. Now I ask to keep\nthine honor, too, awhile--making three men's honor. If I fail, then thou\nand I and Byng-bahadur all go down together in good company. If I fail\nnot, then, sahib--Allah is contented when his honor stands!\"\n\nCunningham drew rein and looked him in the eyes. Gray eyes met brown and\nneither flinched; each read what men of mettle only can read when they\nsee it--the truth, the fearlessness, the thought they understand because\nit lives with them. Cunningham held out his hand.\n\nSome thirty minutes later Cunningham, Mahommed Gunga, and the five, with\na much-diminished mule-train bumping in their wake, were headed westward\non a dry, hot trail, while the time-expired and convalescent escort\nplodded south. The escort carried word that Cunningham had heard of\ntrouble to the west, and had turned off to investigate it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\n    Quoth little red jackal, famishing, \"Lo,\n    Yonder a priest and a soldier go;\n    You can see farthest, and you ought to know,--\n    Which shall I wander with, carrion crow?\"\n    The crow cawed back at him, \"Ignorant beast!\n    Soldiers get glory, but none of the feast;\n    Soldiers work hardest, and snaffle the least.\n    Take my advice on it--Follow the priest!\"\n\n\nIT was two hours after sunrise on the second day that followed\nCunningham's desertion of his party when he and Mahommed Gunga first\ncaught sight of a blue, baked rock rising sheer out of a fringe of\ngreen on the dazzling horizon. It was a freak of nature--a point pushed\nthrough the level crust of bone-dry earth, and left to glitter there\nalone.\n\n\"That is my cousin Alwa's place!\" exclaimed Mahommed Gunga, and he\nseemed to draw a world of consolation from the fact.\n\nThe sight loosed his tongue at last; he rode by Cunningham, and deigned\nan explanation now, at least, of what had led to what might happen. He\nwasted little breath on prophecy, but he was eloquent in building up\na basis from which Cunningham might draw his own deductions. They had\nridden through the cool of the night in easy stages, and should have\ncamped at dawn; but Mahommed Gunga had insisted that the tired animals\ncould carry them for three hours longer.\n\n\"A soldier's horse must rest at the other end sahib,\" he had laughed.\n\"Who knows that they have not sent from Abu to arrest both thee and me?\"\nAnd he had not vouchsafed another word until, over the desert glare, his\ncousin's aerie had blazed out, beating back the molten sun-rays.\n\n\"It looks hotter than the horns of hell!\" said Cunningham.\n\n\"The horns of hell, sahib, are what we leave behind us! They grow hot\nnow! Thy countrymen--the men who hated thee so easily--heated them and\nsit now between them for their folly!\"\n\n\"How d'you mean? 'Pon my soul and honor, Risaldar, you talk more riddles\nin five minutes than I ever heard before in all my life!\"\n\n\"There be many riddles I have not told yet--riddles of which I do not\nknow the answer. Read me this one. Why did the British Government annex\nthe state of Oudh? All the best native soldiers came from Oudh, or\nnearly all. They were loyal once; but can a man be fairly asked to\nside against his own? If Oudh should rise in rebellion, what would the\nsoldiers do?\"\n\n\"Dunno, I'm sure,\" said Cunningham.\n\n\"Read me this one, then. By pacifying both Mohammedan and Hindoo and by\nletting both keep their religion, by sometimes playing one against the\nother and by being just, the British Government has become supreme\nfrom the Himalayas to the ocean. Can you tell me why they now issue\ncartridges for the new rifles that are soaked in the fat of cows and\npigs, thus insulting both Mohammedan and Hindoo?\"\n\n\"I didn't know it was so.\"\n\n\"Sahib, it is! These damned new cartridges and this new drill-sahib,\nI--I who am loyal to the marrow of my bones--would no more touch those\ncartridges--nor bite them, as the drill decrees--than I would betray\nthee! Pig's fat! Ugh!\"\n\nHe spat with Mohammedan eloquence and wiped his lips on his tunic sleeve\nbefore resuming.\n\n\"Then, like a flint and steel, to light the train that they have laid,\nthey loose these missionaries, in a swarm, from one end of India to the\nother. Why? What say one and all? Mohammedan and Hindoo both say it is a\nplot, first to make them lose their own religion by defilement, then\nto make Christians of them! Foolishness to talk thus? Nay! It was\nfoolishness to act thus!\n\n\"Sahib, peace follows in the wake of soldiers, as we know. Time and time\nagain the peace of India has been ripped asunder at the whim of priests!\nThese padre people, preaching new damnation everywhere, are the flint\nand steel for the tinder of the cartridge fat!\"\n\n\"I never knew you to croak before, Mahommed Gunga.\"\n\n\"Nor am I croaking. I am praising Allah, who has sent thee now to the\nplace whence the wind will come to fan the hell flames that presently\nwill burn. The wind will blow hot or cold--for or against the\ngovernment--according as you and I and certain others act when\nopportunity arrives! See yonder!\"\n\nThey had been seen, evidently, for horsemen--looking like black ants on\nthe desert--seemed to have crawled from the bowels of the living rock\nand were galloping in their direction.\n\n\"Friends?\" asked Cunningham.\n\n\"Friends, indeed! But they have yet to discover whether we are friends.\nThey set me thinking, sahib. Alwa is well known on this country-side and\nnone dare raid his place; few would waste time trying. Therefore, it is\nall one to him who passes along this road; and he takes no trouble, as\na rule, to send his men out in skirmishing order when a party comes in\nview. Why, then, does he trouble now?\"\n\n\"Couldn't say. I don't know Alwa.\"\n\n\"I am thinking, sahib, that the cloud has burst at last! A blood-red\ncloud! Alwa is neither scare-monger nor robber; when he sends out armed\nmen to inspect strangers on the sky-line, there is war! Sahib, I grow\nyoung again! Had people listened to me--had they called me anything but\nfool when I warned them--thou and I would have been cooped up now in\nAgra, or in Delhi, or Lucknow, or Peshawur! Now we are free of the\nplains of Rajputana--within a ride of fifty of my blood-relations,\nand they each within reach of others! Ho! I can hear the thunder of\na squadron at my back again! I am young, sahib--young! My old joints\nloosen! Allah send the cloud has burst at last--I bring to two thousand\nRangars a new Cunnigan-bahadur! Thy father's son shall learn what\nCunnigan-bahadur taught!\"\n\nHe lapsed into silence, watching the advancing horsemen, who swooped\ndown on them in an ever-closing fan formation. His tired horse sensed\nthe thrill that tingled through its rider's veins, and pranced again,\ncurving his neck and straining at the bit until Mahommed Gunga steadied\nhim. The five behind--even the mule-drivers too--detected excitement\nin the air, and the little column closed in on its leaders. All eyes\nwatched the neck-and-neck approach of Alwa's men, until Cunningham at\nlast could see their turbans and make out that they were Rangars, not\nHindoos. Then he and the Risaldar drew rein.\n\nThere were twenty who raced toward them, but no Alwa.\n\n\"It is as I thought!\" declared Mahommed Gunga. \"It is war, sahib! He has\nsummoned men from his estates. As a rule, he can afford but ten men for\nthat fort of his, and he would not send all his men to meet us--he has a\ngarrison up yonder!\"\n\nLike blown dust-devils the twenty raced to them, and drew up thundering\nwithin a lance-length. A sword-armed Rangar with a little gold lace on\nhis sleeve laughed loud as he saluted, greeting Mahommed Gunga first.\nThe Risaldar accepted his salute with iron dignity.\n\n\"Forgive him, sahib!\" he whispered to Cunningham. \"The jungli knows no\nbetter! He will learn whom to salute first when Alwa has said his say!\"\n\nBut Cunningham was in no mood just then to stand on military ceremony or\nright of precedence. He was too excited, too inquisitive, too occupied\nwith the necessity for keeping calm in the face of what most surely\nlooked like the beginning of big happenings. These horsemen of Alwa's\nrode, and looked, and laughed like soldiers, new-stripped of the hobble\nropes of peace, and their very seat in the untanned saddles--tight down,\nloose-swaying from the hips, and free--was confirmation of Mahommed\nGunga's words.\n\nThey wheeled in a cloud and led the way, opening a little in the centre\nto let the clouds of sand their horses kicked up blow to the right and\nleft of Cunningham and his men. Not a word was spoken--not a question\nasked or a piece of news exchanged--until the whole party halted at the\nfoot of Alwa's fortress home--a great iron gate in front of them and\ngarden land on either side--watered by the splashing streamlet from the\nheights above.\n\n\"Men of the house of Kachwaha have owned and held this place, sahib,\nsince Allah made it!\" whispered Mahommed Gunga. \"Men say that Alwa has\nno right to it; they lie! His father's father won the dower-right!\"\n\nHe was interrupted by the rising of the iron gate. It seemed solid,\nwithout even an eyehole in it. It was wide enough to let four horses\nunder side by side, and for all its weight it rose as suddenly and\nevenly as though a giant's hand had lifted it. Immediately behind it,\nlike an actor waiting for the stage-curtain to rise, Alwa bestrode his\nwar-horse in the middle of a roadway. He saluted with drawn sabre, and\nthis time Cunningham replied.\n\nAlmost instantly the man who had led the gallopers and had saluted\nMahommed Gunga spurred his horse up close to Cunningham and whispered:\n\n\"Pardon, sahib! I did not know! Am I forgiven?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Cunningham, remembering then that a Rajput, and a Rangar\nmore particularly, thinks about points of etiquette before considering\nwhat to eat. Alwa growled out a welcome, rammed his sabre home, and\nwheeled without another word, showing the way at a walk--which was all\na wild goat could have accomplished--up a winding road, hewn out of the\nsolid mountain, that corkscrewed round and round upon itself until it\ngave onto the battlemented summit. There he dismounted, ordered his men\nto their quarters, and for the first time took notice of his cousin.\n\n\"I have thy missionary and his daughter, three horses for thee, and thy\nman,\" he smiled.\n\n\"Did Ali Partab bring them?\"\n\n\"Nay. It was I brought Ali Partab and the rest! My promise is redeemed!\"\n\nMahommed Gunga thrust his sword-hilt out and smiled back at him.\n\"I present Raff-Cunnigan-sahib--son of Pukka-Cunnigan-bahadur!\" he\nannounced.\n\nAlwa drew himself up to his full height and eyed young Cunningham as a\nbuyer eyes a war-horse, inch by inch. The youngster, who had long since\nlearned to actually revel in the weird sensation of a hundred pairs of\neyes all fixed on him at once, felt this one man's gaze go over him\nas though he were being probed. He thanked his God he had no fat to be\ndetected, and that his legs were straight, and that his tunic fitted\nhim!\n\n\"Salaam, bahadur,\" said Alwa slowly. \"I knew thy father.\nSo--thou--art--his--son. Welcome. There is room here always for a guest.\nI have other guests with whom you might care to speak. I will have a\nroom made ready. Have I leave to ask questions of my cousin here?\"\n\nCunningham bowed in recognition of his courtesy, and walked away to\na point whence he could look from the beetling parapet away and away\nacross desert that shone hot and hazy-rimmed on every side. If this were\na man on whom he must depend for following--if any of all the more\nthan hints dropped by the risaldar were true--it seemed to him that his\nreception was a little too chilly to be hopeful.\n\nAfter a minute or two he turned his eyes away from the dazzling plain\nbelow and faced about to inspect the paved courtyard. Round it, on\nthree sides of a parallelogram, there ran a beautifully designed and\nwonderfully worked-out veranda-fronted building, broken here and there\nby cobbled passages that evidently led to other buildings on the far\nedge of the rock. In the centre, covered by a roof like a temple-dome\nin miniature, was the ice-cold spring, whose existence made the fort\ntenable. Under the veranda, on a long, low lounge, was a sight that\narrested his attention--held him spell-bound--drew him, tingling in\na way he could not have explained--drew him--drew him, slow-footed,\nawkward, red--across the courtyard.\n\nHe heard Mahommed Gunga swear aloud; he recognized the wording of the\nbelly-growled Rangar oath; but it did not occur to him that what\nhe saw--what was drawing him--could be connected with it. He looked\nstraight ahead and walked ahead--reached the edge of the veranda--took\nhis helmet off--and stood still, feeling like an idiot, with the sun\nfull on his head.\n\n\"I'd advise you to step into the shade,\" said a voice that laughed more\nsweetly than the chuckling spring. \"I don't know who you are, but I'm\nmore glad to see you than I ever was in my life to see anybody. I can't\nget up, because I'm too stiff; the ride to here from Howrah City all but\nkilled me, and I'm only here still because I couldn't ride another yard.\nMy father will be out in a moment. He's half-dead too.\"\n\n\"My name is Cunningham.\"\n\n\"I'm Miss McClean. My father was a missionary in Howrah.\"\n\nShe nodded to a chair beside her, and Cunningham took it, feeling\nawkward, as men of his type usually do when they meet a woman in a\nstrange place.\n\n\"How in the world did you get in?\" she asked him. \"It's two days now\nsince the Alwa-sahib told us that the whole country is in rebellion. How\nis it that you managed to reach here? According to Alwa, no white man's\nlife is safe in the open, and he only told me today that he wouldn't let\nme go away even if I were well enough to ride.\"\n\n\"First I've heard of rebellion!\" said Cunningham aghast at the notion of\nhearing news like that a second hand, and from a woman.\n\n\"Hasn't Alwa told you?\"\n\n\"He hasn't had time to, yet.\"\n\n\"Then, you'd better ask him. If what he say is true--and I think he\ntells the truth--the natives mean to kill us all, or drive us out of\nIndia. Of course they can't do it, but they mean to try. He has been\nmore than kind--more than hospitable--more than chivalrous. Just because\nhe gave his word to another Rangar, he risked his life about a dozen\ntimes to get my father and me and Ali Partab out of Howrah. But, I don't\nthink he quite liked doing it--and--this is in confidence--if I were\nasked--and speaking just from intuition--I should say he is in sympathy\nwith the rebellion!\"\n\n\"How long have you been here?\" asked Cunningham.\n\n\"Several days--ten, I think. It seemed strange at first and rather awful\nto be lodged on a rock like this in a section of a Rangar's harem!\nYes, there are several women here behind the scenes, but I only see the\nwaiting-women. I've forgotten time; the news about rebellion seems too\nawful to leave room for any other thought.\"\n\n\"Who was the Rangar to whom Aliva gave his word? Not Mahommed Gunga, by\nany chance?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mahommed Gunga.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm--!\" Cunningham clipped off the participle just in time.\n\"There is something, then, in the talk about rebellion! That man's been\ntalking in riddles to me ever since I came to India, and it looks as\nthough he knew long in advance.\"\n\nHe was about to cross-examine Miss McClean rigorously, even at the risk\nof seeming either rude or else frightened; but before his lips could\nframe another question he caught sight of Mahommed Gunga making signals\nto him. He affected to ignore the signals. He objected to being kept in\nthe dark so utterly, and wished to find out a little for himself before\nlistening to what the Rangars had to say. But Mahommed Gunga started\nover to him.\n\nHe could not hear the remark Mahommed Gunga made to Alwa over his\nshoulder as he came.\n\n\"Had I remembered there was a woman of his own race here, I would have\nplunged him straight into the fighting! Now there will be the devil\nfirst to pay!\"\n\n\"He has decision in at least one thing!\" grinned Alwa.\n\n\"Something that I think thou lackest, cousin!\" came the hot retort.\n\nAlwa turned his back with a shake of his head and a thin-lipped\nsmile--then disappeared through a green door in the side of what seemed\nlike solid rock. A moment later Mahommed Gunga stood near Cunningham,\nsaluting.\n\n\"We ask the favor of a consultation, sahib.\"\n\nCunningham rose, a shade regretfully, and followed into the rock-walled\ncavern into which Alwa had preceded them. It was nearly square--a hollow\nbubble in the age-old lava--axe-trimmed many hundred years ago. What\nlight there was came in through three long slits that gave an archer's\nview of the plain and of the zigzag roadway from the iron gate below.\nIt was cool, for the rock roof was fifty or more feet thick, and the\nsilence of it seemed like the nestling-place of peace.\n\nThey sat down on wooden benches round the walls, with their soldier legs\nstretched out in front of them. Alwa broke silence first, and it was of\nanything but peace he spoke.\n\n\"Now--now, let us see whose throats we are to slit!\" he started\ncheerfully.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\n    Achilles had a tender spot\n    That even guarding gods forgot,\n            When clothing him in armor;\n    And I have proved this charge o' mine\n    For fear, and sloth, and vice, and wine,\n            But clear forgot the charmer!\n\n\nTHE Alwa-sahib knew more English than he was willing to admit. In the\nfirst place, he had the perfectly natural dislike of committing his\nthoughts to any language other than his own when anything serious\nwas the subject of discussion; in the second place, he had little of\nMahommed Gunga's last-ditch loyalty. Not that Alwa could be disloyal;\nhe had not got it in him; but as yet he had seen no good reason for\npledging himself and his to the British cause.\n\nSo for more than ten minutes he chose to sit in apparent dudgeon,\nhis hands folded in front of him on the hilt of his tremendous sabre,\ngrowling out a monologue in his own language for Mahommed Gunga's\nbenefit. Then Mahommed Gunga silenced him with an uplifted hand, and\nturned to translate to Cunningham.\n\n\"It would seem, sahib, that even while we rode to Abu the rebellion was\nalready raging! It burst suddenly. They have mutinied at Berhampur,\nand slain their officers. Likewise at Meerut, and at all the places in\nbetween. At Kohat, in this province they have slain every white man,\nwoman, and child, and also at Arjpur and Sohlat. The rebels are hurrying\nto Delhi, where they have proclaimed new rule, under the descendants\nof the old-time kings. Word of all this came before dawn today, by a\nmessenger from Maharajah Howrah to my cousin here. My cousin stands\npledged to uphold Howrah on his throne; Howrah is against the British;\nJaimihr, his brother, is in arms against Howrah.\"\n\n\"Why did the Alwa-sahib pledge himself to Howrah's cause?\"\n\nMahommed Gunga--who knew quite well--saw fit to translate the question.\nWith a little sign of irritation Alwa growled his answer.\n\n\"He says, sahib, that for the safety of two Christian missionaries, for\nwhom he has no esteem at all, he was forced to swear allegiance to a\nHindoo whom he esteems even less. He says that his word is given!\"\n\n\"Does he mean that he would like me and the missionaries to leave his\nhome at once--do we embarrass him?\"\n\nAgain Mahommed Gunga--this time with a grin--saw fit to ask before he\nanswered.\n\n\"He says, 'God forbid,' sahib; 'a guest is guest!'\"\n\nCunningham reflected for a moment, then leaned forward.\n\n\"Tell him this!\" he said slowly. \"I am glad to be his guest, but, if\nthis story of rebellion is true--\"\n\n\"It is true, sahib! More than true! There is much more to be told!\"\n\n\"Then, I can only accept his hospitality as the representative of my\ngovernment! I stay here officially, or not at all. It is for him to\nanswer!\"\n\n\"Now, Allah be praised!\" swore Mahommed Gunga. \"I knew we had a man!\nThat is well said, sahib!\"\n\n\"The son of Cunnigan-bahadur is welcome here on any terms at all!\"\ngrowled Alwa when Mahommed Gunga had translated. \"All the rebels in all\nIndia, all trying at once, would fail to take this fort of mine, had I a\nlarger garrison. But what Rangar on this countryside will risk his life\nand estates on behalf of a cause that is already lost? If they come to\nhold my fort for me, the rebels will burn their houses. The British Raj\nis doomed. We Rangars have to play for our own stake!\"\n\nThen Mahommed Gunga rose and paced the floor like a man in armor,\ntugging at his beard and kicking at his scabbard each time that he\nturned at either end.\n\n\"What Rangar in this province would have had one yard of land to his\nname but for this man's father?\" he demanded. \"In his day we fought, all\nof us, for what was right! We threw our weight behind him when he led,\nletting everything except obedience go where the devil wanted it! What\ncame of that? Good tithes, good report, good feeling, peace!\"\n\n\"And then, the zemindary laws!\" growled Alwa. \"Then the laws that took\naway from us full two-thirds of our revenue!\"\n\n\"We had had no revenue, except for Cunnigan-bahadur!\"\n\nIt dawned on Cunningham exactly why and how he came to be there! He\nunderstood now that Mahommed Gunga had told nothing less than truth when\nhe declared it had been through his scheming, and no other man's,\nthat he--Cunningham--whose sole thought was to be a soldier, had been\nrelegated to oblivion and politics! He understood why Byng had signed\nthe transfer, and he knew--knew--knew--deep down inside him that his\nchance had come!\n\n\"It seems that another Cunningham is to have the honor of preserving\nRangars' titles for them,\" he smiled. \"How many horsemen could the\nAlwa-sahib raise?\"\n\n\"That would depend!\" Alwa was in no mood to commit himself.\n\n\"At the most--at a pinch--in case of direst need, and for a cause that\nall agreed on?\"\n\n\"Two thousand.\"\n\n\"Horsed and armed?\"\n\n\"And ready!\"\n\n\"And you, Alwa-sahib--are you pledged to fight against the British?\"\n\n\"Not in so many words. I swore to uphold Howrah on his throne. He is\nagainst the British.\"\n\n\"You swore to help smash his brother, Jaimihr?\"\n\n\"If I were needed.\"\n\n\"And Jaimihr too is against the British?\"\n\n\"Jaimihr is for Jaimihr, and has a personal affair with me!\"\n\n\"I must think,\" said Cunningham, getting up. \"I can think better alone.\nD'you mind if I go outside for a while, and come back later to tell you\nwhat I think?\"\n\nAlwa arose and held the door open for him--stood and watched him cross\nthe courtyard--then turned and laughed at Mahommed Gunga.\n\n\"Straight over to the woman!\" he grinned. \"This leader of thine seems in\nleading-strings himself already!\"\n\nMahommed Gunga cursed, and cursed again as his own eyes confirmed what\nAlwa said.\n\n\"I tried him all the ways there are, except that one way!\" he declared.\n\"May Allah forgive my oversight!  I should have got him well entangled\nwith a woman before he reached Peshawur! He should have been\nheart-broken by this time--rightly, he should have been desperate with\nunrequited love! Byng-bahadur could have managed it! Byng-bahadur would\nhave managed it, had I thought to advise him!\"\n\nHe stood, looking over very gloomily at Cunningham, making a dozen\nwild plans for getting rid of Miss McClean--by no means forgetting\npoison--and the height of Alwa's aerie from the plain below! He would\nhave been considerably calmer, could he have heard what Cunningham and\nMiss McClean were saying.\n\nThe missionary was with her now--ill and exhausted from the combined\neffects of excitement, horror, and the unaccustomed ride across\nthe desert--most anxious for his daughter--worried, to the verge of\ndesperation, by the ghastly news of the rebellion.\n\n\"Mr. Cunningham, I hope you are the forerunner of a British force?\" he\nhazarded.\n\nBut Cunningham was too intent on cross-examination to waste time on\ngiving any information.\n\n\"I want you to tell me, quite quietly and without hurry, all you can\nabout Howrah,\" he said, sitting close to Miss McClean. \"I want you to\nunderstand that I am the sole representative of my government in the\nwhole district, and that whatever can be done depends very largely on\nwhat information I can get. I have been talking to the Alwa-sahib, but\nhe seems too obsessed with his own predicament to be able to make things\nquite clear. Now, go ahead and tell me what you know about conditions\nin the city. Remember, you are under orders! Try and consider yourself\na scout, reporting information to your officer. Tell me every single\nthing, however unimportant.\"\n\nOn the far side of the courtyard Alwa and Mahommed Gunga had gone to\nlean over the parapet and watch something that seemed to interest\nboth of them intently. There were twenty or more men, lined round\nthe ramparts on the lookout, and they all too seemed spellbound, but\nCunningham was too engrossed in Miss McClean's story of the happenings\nin Howrah City to take notice. Now and then her father would help her\nout with an interjected comment; occasionally Cunningham would stop her\nwith a question, or would ask her to repeat some item; but, for more\nthan an hour she spun a clear-strung narrative that left very little to\nimagination and included practically all there was to know.\n\n\"Do you think,\" asked Cunningham \"that this brute Jaimihr really wants\nto make you Maharanee?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say,\" she shuddered. \"You know, there have been several\ninstances of European women having practically sold themselves to native\nprinces; there have been stories--I have heard them--of English women\nmarrying Rajahs, and regretting it. There is no reason why he should not\nbe in earnest, and he certainly seemed to be.\"\n\n\"And this treasure? Of course, I have heard tales about it, but I\nthought they were just tales.\"\n\n\"That treasure is really there, and its amount must be fabulous. I\nhave been told that there are jewels there which would bring a Rajah's\nransom, and gold enough to offset the taxes of the whole of India for a\nyear or two. I've no doubt the stories are exaggerated, but the treasure\nis real enough, and big enough to make the throne worth fighting for.\nJaimihr counts on being able to break the power of the priests and\nbroach the treasure.\"\n\n\"And Jaimihr is--er--in love with you!\"\n\n\"He tried very hard to prove it, in his own objectionable way!\"\n\n\"And Jaimihr wants the throne--and Howrah wants to send a force against\nthe British, but dare not move because of Jaimihr--I have Mahommed\nGunga and five or six men to depend on--the Rangars are sitting on the\nfence--and the government has its hands full! The lookout's bright! I\nthink I see the way through!\"\n\n\"You are forgetting me.\" The missionary spread his broad stooped\nshoulders. \"I am a missionary first, but next to that I have my\ncountry's cause more at heart than anything. I place myself under your\norders, Mr. Cunningham.\"\n\n\"I too,\" said Miss McClean. She was looking at him keenly as he gazed\naway into nothing through slightly narrowed eyes. Vaguely, his attitude\nreminded her of a picture she had once seen of the Duke of Wellington;\nthere was the same mastery, the same far vision, the same poise of\nself-contained power. His nose was not like the Iron Duke's, for young\nCunningham's had rather more tolerance in its outline and less of Roman\noverbearing; but the eyes, and the mouth, and the angle of the jaw were\nso like Wellesley's as to force a smile. \"A woman isn't likely to be\nmuch use in a case like this--but, one never knows. My country comes\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" he answered quietly. And as he turned his head to flash one\nglance at each of them, she recognized what Mahommed Gunga had gloated\nover from the first--the grim decision, that will sacrifice all--take\nfull responsibility--and use all means available for the one unflinching\npurpose of the game in hand. She knew that minute, and her father knew,\nthat if she could be used--in any way at all--he would make use of her.\n\n\"Go ahead!\" she nodded. \"I'll obey!\"\n\n\"And I will not prevent!\" said Duncan McClean, smiling and straightening\nhis spectacles.\n\nCunningham left them and walked over to the parapet, where the whole\ngarrison was bending excitedly now above the battlement. There were more\nthan forty men, most of them clustered near Alwa and Mahommed Gunga.\nMahommed Gunga was busy counting.\n\n\"Eight hundred!\" he exclaimed, as Cunningham drew near.\n\n\"Eight hundred what, Mahommed Gunga? Come and see, sahib.\"\n\nCunningham leaned over, and beheld a mounted column, trailing along the\ndesert road in wonderfully good formation.\n\n\"Where are they from?\" he asked.\n\n\"Jaimihr's men, from Howrah!\"\n\n\"That means,\" growled Alwa, \"that the Hindoo pig Jaimihr has more than\nhalf the city at his back. He has left behind ten men for every one he\nbrings with him--sufficient to hold Howrah in check. Otherwise he\nwould never have dared come here. He hopes to settle his little private\nquarrel with me first, before dealing with his brother! Who told him, I\nwonder, that I was pledged to Howrah?\"\n\n\"He reckons he has caught thee napping in this fort of thine!\" laughed\nMahommed Gunga. \"He means to bottle up the Rangars' leader, and so\ncheckmate all of them!\"\n\nThe eight hundred horsemen on the plain below rode carelessly through\nAlwa's gardens, leaving trampled confusion in their wake, and lined\nup--with Jaimihr at their head--immediately before the great iron\ngate. A moment later four men rode closer and hammered on it with their\nlance-ends.\n\n\"Go down and speak to them!\" commanded Alwa, and a man dropped down the\nzigzag roadway like a goat, taking short cuts from level to level, until\nhe stood on a pinnacle of rock that overhung the gate. Ten minutes later\nhe returned, breathing hard with the effort of his climb.\n\n\"Jaimihr demands the missionaries--particularly the Miss-sahib--also\nquarters and food!\" he reported.\n\n\"Quarters and food he shall have!\" swore Alwa, looking down at the\nPrince who sat his charger in the centre of the roadway. \"Did he deign a\nthreat?\"\n\n\"He said that in fifteen minutes he will burst the gate in, unless he is\nfirst admitted!\"\n\nDuncan McClean walked over, limping painfully, and peered over the\nprecipice.\n\n\"Unfriendly?\" he asked, and Mahommed Gunga heard him.\n\n\"Thy friend Jaimihr, sahib! His teeth are all but visible from here!\"\n\n\"And--?\"\n\n\"He demands admittance--also thee and thy daughter!\"\n\n\"And--?\"\n\n\"Sahib--art thou a priest?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"One, then, who prays?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"For dead men, ever? For the dying?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Aloud?\"\n\n\"On occasion, yes.\"\n\n\"Then pray now! There will be many dead and dying on the plain below\nin less than fifteen minutes! Hindoos, for all I know, would benefit by\nprayer. They have too many gods, and their gods are too busy fighting\nfor ascendancy to listen. Pray thou, a little!\"\n\nThere came a long shout from the plain, and Alwa sent a man again to\nlisten. He came back with a message that Jaimihr granted amnesty to\nall who would surrender, and that he would be pleased to accept Alwa's\nallegiance if offered to him.\n\n\"I will offer the braggart something in the way of board and lodging\nthat will astonish him!\" growled Alwa. \"Eight men to horse! The first\neight! That will do! Back to the battlement, the rest of you!\"\n\nThey had raced for the right to loose themselves against eight hundred!\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\n    OH, duck and run--the hornets come!\n    Oh, jungli!  Clear the way!\n    The nest's ahum--the hornets come!\n    The sharp-stinged, harp-winged hornets come!\n    Nay, jungli!  When the hornets come,\n            It isn't well to stay!\n\n\nALWA ordered ten men down into the bowels of the rock itself, where\ngreat wheels with a chain attached to them were forced round to lift the\ngate. Next he stationed a signaller with a cord in either hand, above\nthe parapet, to notify the men below exactly when to set the simple\nmachinery in motion. His eight clattered out from the stables on the far\nside of the rock, and his own charger was brought to him, saddled.\n\nThen, in a second, it was evident why Raputs do not rule in Rajputana.\n\n\"I ride too with my men!\" declared Mahommed Gunga.\n\n\"Nay! This is my affair--my private quarrel with Jaimihr!\"\n\nMahommed Gunga turned to Ali Partab, who had been a shadow to him ever\nsince he came.\n\n\"Turn out my five, and bring my charger!\" he commanded.\n\n\"No, I say!\" Alwa had his hand already on his sabre hilt. \"There is room\nfor eight and no more. Four following four abreast, and one ahead\nto lead them. I and my men know how to do this. I and my men have a\npersonal dispute with Jaimihr. Stay thou here!\"\n\nMahommed Gunga's five and Ali Partab came clattering out so fast as\nto lead to the suspicion that their horses had been already saddled.\nMahommed Gunga mounted.\n\n\"Lead on, cousin!\" he exclaimed. \"I will follow thy lead, but I come!\"\n\nThen Alwa did what a native nearly always will do. He turned to a man\nnot of his own race, whom he believed he could trust to be impartial.\n\n\"Sahib--have I no rights in my own house?\"\n\n\"Certainly you have,\" said Cunningham, who was wondering more than\nanything what weird, wild trick these horsemen meant to play. No man in\nhis senses would have dared to ride a horse at more than foot-pace down\nthe path. Was there another path? he wondered. At least, if eight men\nwere about to charge into eight hundred, it would be best to keep his\ngood friend Mahommed Gunga out of it, he decided.\n\n\"Risaldar!\" The veteran was always most amenable to reason when\naddressed by his military title. \"Who of us two is senior--thou or I?\"\n\n\"By Allah, not I, sahib! I am thy servant!\"\n\n\"I accept your service, and I order you to stay with your men up here\nwith me!\"\n\nMahommed Gunga saluted and dismounted, and his six followed suit,\nlooking as disappointed as children just deprived of a vacation. Alwa\nwheeled his horse in front of Cunningham and saluted too.\n\n\"For that service, sahib, I am thy friend!\" he muttered. \"That was right\nand reasonable, and a judgement quickly given! Thy friend, bahadur!\" He\nspoke low on purpose, but Mahommed Gunga heard him, caught Cunningham's\neye, and grinned. He saw a way to save his face, at all events.\n\n\"That was a trick well turned, sahib!\" he whispered, as Alwa moved away.\n\"Alwa will listen in future when Cunnigan-bahadur speaks!\"\n\n\"Go down and tell Jaimihr that I come in person!\" ordered Alwa, and the\nman dropped down the cliff side for the third time; they could hear his\nvoice, high-pitched, resounding off the rock, and they caught a faint\nmurmur of the answer. Below, Jaimihr could be seen waiting patiently,\nchecking his restive war-horse with a long-cheeked bit, and waiting,\nready to ride under the gate the moment it was opened. Rosemary McClean\ncame over; she and Cunningham and the missionary leaned together over\nthe battlement and watched.\n\n\"We might do some execution with rifles from here,\" Cunningham\nsuggested; \"I believe I'll send for mine.\" But Mahommed Gunga overheard\nhim.\n\n\"Nay, sahib! No shooting will be necessary. Watch!\"\n\nThere was a clatter of hoofs, and they all looked up in time to see the\ntails of the last four chargers disappearing round the corner, downward.\nThey had gone--full pelt--down a path that a man might hesitate to take!\nFrom where they stood, there was an archer's view of every inch of the\nonly rock-hewn road that led from the gate to the summit of the cliff;\nan enemy who had burst the gate in would have had to climb in the teeth\nof a searching hail of missiles, with little chance of shooting back.\n\nThey could see the gate itself, and Jaimihr on the other side.\nAnd, swooping--shooting--sliding down the trail like a storm-loosed\navalanche, they could see the nine go, led by Alwa. No living creature\ncould have looked away!\n\nBelow, entirely unconscious of the coming shock, the mounted sepoys\nwaited behind Jaimihr in four long, straight lines. Jaimihr himself,\nwith a heavy-hilted cimeter held upward at the \"carry,\" was about four\ncharger lengths beyond the iron screen, ready to spur through. Close by\nhim were a dozen, waiting to ram a big beam in and hold up the gate\nwhen it had opened. And, full-tilt down the gorge, flash-tipped like\na thunderbolt, gray-turbaned, reckless, whirling death ripped down on\nthem.\n\nThey caught sound of the hammering hoofs too late. Two gongs boomed in\nthe rock. The windlass creaked. Five seconds too late Jaimihr gathered\nup his reins, spurred, wheeled, and shouted to the men behind him.\nThe great gate rose, like the jaws of a hungry monster, and\nthe nine--streaking too fast down far too steep a slide to stop\nthemselves--burst straight out under it and struck, as a wind blast\nsmites a poppy-field.\n\nJaimihr was borne backward--carried off his horse. Alwa and the first\nfour rode him down, and crashed through the four-deep line beyond; the\nsecond four pounced on him, gathered him, and followed. Before the lines\ncould form again the whole nine wheeled--as a wind-eddy spins on its own\naxis--and burst through back again, the horses racing neck and neck, and\nthe sabres cutting down a swath to screech and swear and gurgle in among\nthe trampled garden stuff.\n\nThey came back in a line, all eight abreast, Alwa leading only by a\nlength. At the opening, four horses--two on either side--slid, rump to\nthe ground, until their noses touched the rock. Alwa and four dashed\nthrough and under; the rest recovered, spun on their haunches, and\nfollowed. The gongs boomed again down in the belly of the rock, and the\ngate clanged shut.\n\n\"That was good,\" said Mahommed Gunga quietly. \"Now, watch again!\"\n\nAlmost before the words had left his lips, a hail of lead barked out\nfrom twenty vantage-points, and the smoke showed where some forty men\nwere squinting down steel barrels, shooting as rapidly and as rottenly\nas natives of India usually do. They did little execution; but before\nAlwa and his eight had climbed up the steep track to the summit, patting\ntheir horses' necks and reviling Jaimihr as they came, the cavalry below\nhad scampered out of range, leaving their dead and wounded where they\nlay.\n\n\"How is that for a start, sahib?\" demanded Mahommed Gunga exultantly,\nas two men deposited the dishevelled Jaimihr on his feet, and the Prince\nglared around him like a man awaking from a dream. \"How is that for a\nbeginning?\"\n\n\"As bad as could be!\" answered Cunningham. \"It was well\nexecuted--bold--clever--anything you like, Mahommed Gunga, but--if I'd\nbeen asked I'd have sooner made the devil prisoner! Jaimihr is no use at\nall to us in here. Outside, he'd be veritable godsend!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\n    There is war to the North should I risk and ride forth,\n    And a fight to the South, too, I'm thinking;\n    There is war in the East, and one battle at least\n    In the West between eating and drinking.\n    I'm allowed to rejoice in an excellent choice\n    Of plans for a soldier of mettle,\n    For all of them mean bloody war and rapine.\n    So--on which should a gentleman settle?\n\n\nWITH his muscles strained and twisted (for his Rangar capturers had\ndragged him none too gently) and with his jewelled pugree all awry,\nJaimihr did not lack dignity. He held his chin high, although he gazed\nat the bubbling spring thirstily; and, thirsty though he must have been,\nhe asked no favors.\n\nOne of Alwa's men brought him a brass dipper full of water, after\nwashing it out first thoroughly and ostentatiously. But Jaimihr smiled.\nHis caste forbade. He waved away the offering much as Caesar may have\nwaved aside a crown, with an air of condescending mightiness too proud\nto know contempt.\n\n\"Go, help thyself!\" growled Alwa; and Jaimihr walked to the spring\nwithout haste, knelt down, and dipped up water with his hand.\n\n\"Now to a cell with him!\" commanded Alwa, before the Prince had time\nto slake a more than ordinary thirst. Jaimihr stood upright as four men\nclosed in on him, and looked straight in the eyes of every one in turn.\nRosemary McClean stepped back, to hide herself behind Cunningham's broad\nshoulders, but Jaimihr saw her and his proud smile broadened to a laugh\nof sheer amusement. He let his captors wait for him while he stared\nstraight at her, sparing her no fragment of embarrassment.\n\n\"I slew a man once to save thee, sahiba!\" he mocked. \"Why slink away?\nHave I ever been thy enemy?\"\n\nThen he folded his arms and walked off between his guards, without even\nan acknowledgment of Alwa's or any other man's existence on the earth.\n\nAlwa spat as he wiped blood from his long sabre. He imagined he was\ndoing the necessary dirty work out of Miss McClean's sight; but, except\nhospital nurses, there are few women who can see dry blood removed from\nsteel without a qualm; she had looked at Alwa to escape Jaimihr's gaze;\nnow she looked at Jaimihr's back to avoid the sight of what Alwa was\nseeing fit to do. And with all the woman in her she pitied the prisoner,\nwho had said no less than truth when he claimed to have killed a man for\nher.\n\nShe knew that he would have killed a thousand men for her with equal\ngenerosity and equal disregard of what she thought was right, and she\ndid not doubt that he would think himself both justified and worthy of\nrenown for doing it. She could have begged his release that minute,\nhad she thought for an instant that Alwa would consent, and but for\nCunningham. She had grown aware of Cunningham's gray eyes, staring\nstraight at her--summing her up--reading her. And she became conscious\nof the fact that she had met a man whose leave she would like to ask\nbefore deciding to act.\n\nThe mental acknowledgment brought relief for a few seconds. She was\ntired. The woman in here went out to the man in Cunningham, and she\nwelcomed a protector. Then the Scots blood raced to the assistance of\nthe woman, and she bridled instantly. Who, then, was this chance-met\njackanapes, that she should lean on him or look to him for guidance?\n\nThe rebellion that had made her disobey her father back in Howrah\nCity--the spirit that had kept her in Howrah City and had given Jaimihr\nback cool stare for stare--rallied her to resist--to ridicule--to rival\nCunningham's pretensions. He saw her flush beneath his gaze, and turned\naway to where Mahommed Gunga watched from the parapet.\n\nThe leaders of Jaimihr's calvary were arguing. They could be seen\ngathered together out of rifle-shot but in full view of Alwa's rock, and\nfrom their gestures they seemed to be considering the feasibility of an\nattack.\n\nBut it needed no warrior--it needed less even than ordinary\nintelligence--to know that as few as forty men could hold that fastness\nagainst two thousand. Eight hundred would have no chance against it.\nEven two thousand would need engineers, and ordnance, as well as plans.\n\nPresently half of the little army rode away, back toward Howrah City,\nand the other half proceeded to bivouac where they could watch the\niron-shuttered entrance and cut off the little garrison from all\ncommunication or assistance.\n\n\"We might as well resume our conference,\" suggested Alwa, with the\ncourtly air of a man just arisen from a chair. No one who had not seen\nhim ride would have dreamed that he was fresh from snatching a prisoner\nat the bottom of a neck-breaking defile. Cunningham nodded acquiescence\nand followed him, turning to stare again at Miss McClean before he\nstrode away with long, even strides that had a reassuring effect on any\none who watched him. She bridled again, and blushed. But she experienced\nthe weird sensation of being read right through before Mahommed Gunga\ncontrived adroitly to step into the line of view and so let Cunningham's\nattention fix itself on something else. The Risaldar had made up his\nmind that love was inopportune just then; and he was a man who left no\nstone unturned--no point unwatched--when he had sensed a danger. This\nmight be danger and it might not be; so he watched. Cunningham was\nconscious of the sudden interruption of a train of thought, but he was\nnot conscious of deliberate interference.\n\n\"That very young man is an old man,\" said Duncan McClean, wiping his\nspectacles as he walked beside his daughter to the deep veranda where\ntheir chairs were side by side. \"He is a grown man. He has come to man's\nestate. Look at the set of that pair of shoulders. Mark his strength!\"\n\n\"I expect any one of those Rajputs is physically stronger,\" answered\nRosemary, in no mood to praise any one.\n\n\"I was thinking of the strength of character he expresses rather than of\nhis actual muscles,\" said McClean.\n\n\"Bismillah!\" Alwa was swearing behind the thick teak door that closed\nbehind him and Cunningham and Mahommed Gunga. \"We have made a good\nbeginning! With the wolf in a trap, what has the goat to dread? Howrah\nmay chuckle himself to sleep! And I--I, too, by the beard of God's\nprophet!--I, too, may laugh, for, with Jaimihr under lock and key, what\nneed is there to ride to the aid of a Hindoo Rajah? I am free again!\"\n\n\"Alwa-sahib!\"\n\nCunningham had fixed him with those calm gray eyes of his, and Mahommed\nGunga sat down on the nearest bench contented. He could wait for what\nwas coming now. He recognized the blossoming of the plant that he had\nnursed through its growth so long.\n\n\"I listen,\" answered Alwa.\n\n\"I represent the British Government. I am the only servant of the\nCompany within reach. Do you realize that?\"\n\n\"Yes, sahib.\"\n\n\"I have no orders which entitle me to deal with any crisis such as this.\nBut, when my orders were given me, no such crisis was contemplated.\nTherefore, on behalf of the Company, I assume full authority until such\ntime as some one senior to me turns up to relieve me. Is all that clear\nto you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sahib.\"\n\nMahommed Gunga went through considerable pantomime of being angry with a\nfly. He found it necessary to conceal emotion in some way or other. Alwa\nsat motionless and stared straight back at Cunningham.\n\n\"I understand, sahib,\" he repeated.\n\n\"You are talking to me, then, on that understanding?\"\n\n\"Most certainly, huzoor.\"\n\n\"You can raise two thousand men?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Say fifteen hundred?\"\n\n\"Surely fifteen hundred. Not a sabre less.\"\n\n\"All horsed and armed?\"\n\n\"Surely, bahadur. Of what use would be a rabble? I was speaking in terms\nof men able to fight, as one soldier to another.\"\n\n\"Will you raise those men?\"\n\n\"Of a truth, I must, sahib!\" Alwa laughed. \"Jaimihr's thousands will be\nin no mind to lie leaderless and let Howrah ride rough-shod over them!\nThey know his charity of old! They will be here to claim their Prince\nwithin a day or two, and without my fifteen hundred how would I stand?\nSurely, bahadur, I will raise my fifteen hundred.\"\n\n\"Very well. Now I will make you a proposal. On behalf of the Company I\noffer you and your men pay at the rate paid to all irregular cavalry on\na war basis. In return, I demand your allegiance.\"\n\n\"To whom, sahib? To you or to the Company?\"\n\n\"To the Company, of course.\"\n\n\"Nay! Not I! For the son of Cunnigan-bahadur I would slit the throats of\nhalf Asia, and then of nine-tenths of the other half! But by the breath\nof God--by my spurs and this sabre here--I have had enough of pledging!\nI swore allegiance to Howrah. Being nearly free of that pledge by\nAllah's sending, shall I plunge into another, like a frightened bird\nfluttering from snare to snare? Nay, nay, bahadur! For thyself, for thy\nfather's sake, ask any favor. It is granted. But thy Company may stew in\nthe grease of its own cartridges for ought I care!\"\n\nCunningham stood up and bowed very slightly--very stiffly--very\npunctiliously. Mahommed Gunga leaped to his feet, and came to attention\nwith a military clatter. Alwa stared, inclining his head a trifle in\nrecognition of the bow, but evidently taken by surprise.\n\n\"Then, good-by, Alwa-sahib.\"\n\nCunningham stretched out a hand.\n\n\"I am much obliged to you for your hospitality, and regret exceedingly\nthat I cannot avail myself of it further, either for myself or\nfor Mahommed Gunga or for Mr. and Miss McClean. As the Company's\nrepresentative, they, of course, look to me for orders and protection,\nand I shall take them away at once. As things are, we can only be a\nsource of embarrassment to you.\"\n\n\"But--sahib--huzoor--it is impossible. You have seen the cavalry below.\nHow can you--how could you get away?\"\n\n\"Unless I am your prisoner I shall certainly leave this place at once.\nThe only other condition on which I will stay here is that you pledge\nyour allegiance to the Company and take my orders.\"\n\n\"Sahib, this is--why--huzoor--\"\n\nAlwa looked over to Mahommed Gunga and raised his eyebrows eloquently.\n\n\"I obey him! I go with him!\" growled Mahommed Gunga.\n\n\"Sahib, I would like time to think this over.\"\n\n\"How much time? I thought you quick-witted when you made Jaimihr\nprisoner. Has that small success undermined your power of decision? I\nknow my mind. Mahommed Gunga knows his, Alwa-sahib.\"\n\n\"I ask an hour. There are many points I must consider. There is the\nprisoner for one thing.\"\n\n\"You can hand him over to the custody of the first British column we\ncan get in touch with, Alwa-sahib. That will relieve you of further\nresponsibility to Howrah and will insure a fair trial of any issue there\nmay be between yourself and Jaimihr.\"\n\nAlwa scowled. No Rajput likes the thought of litigation where affairs\nof honor are concerned. He felt he would prefer to keep Jaimihr prisoner\nfor the present.\n\n\"Also, sahib\"--fresh facets of the situation kept appearing to him as he\nsparred for time--\"with Jaimihr in a cage I can drive a bargain with his\nbrother. While I keep him in the cage, Howrah must respect my wishes for\nfear lest otherwise I loose Jaimihr to be a thorn in his side anew. If I\nhand him to the British, Howrah will know that he is safe and altogether\nout of harm's way; then he will recall what he may choose to consider\ninsolence of mine; and then--\"\n\n\"Oh, well--consider it!\" said Cunningham, saluting him and making for\nthe door, close followed by Mahommed Gunga. The two went out and it\nleft Alwa to stride up and down alone--to wrestle between desire and\ncircumspection--to weigh uncomfortable fact with fact--and to curse his\nwits that could not settle on the wisest and most creditable course.\nThey turned into another chamber of the tunnelled rock, and there until\nlong after the hour of law allowed to Alwa they discussed the situation\ntoo.\n\n\"The point was well taken, sahib,\" said Mahommed Gunga, \"but he should\nhave been handled rather less abruptly.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Rather less abruptly, sahib.\"\n\n\"Oh! Well--if his mind isn't clear as to which side he'll fight on, I\ndon't want him, and that's all!\" said Cunningham. And Mahommed Gunga\nbitted his impatience fiercely, praying the one God he believed in to\ntouch the right scale of the two. Later, Cunningham strode out to pace\nthe courtyard in the dark, and the Rajput followed him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\n    The trapped wolf bared his fangs and swore,\n    \"But set me this time free,\n    And I will hunt thee never more!\n    By ear and eye and jungle law,\n    I'll starve--I'll faint--I'll die before\n    I bury tooth in thee!\"\n\n\nWHILE Alwa raged alone, and while Mahommed Gunga talked to Cunningham\nin a rock-room near at hand, Rosemary McClean saw fit to take a hand\nin history. It was not her temperament to sit quite idle while others\nshaped her destiny; nor was she given to mere brooding over wrongs. When\na wrong was being done that she could alter or alleviate it was her way\nto tackle it at once without asking for permission or advice.\n\nFrom where her chair was placed under the long veranda she could see the\npassage in the rock that led to Jaimihr's cell. She saw his captors take\nhim up the passage; she heard the door clang shut on him, and she saw\nthe men come back again. She heard them laugh, too, and she overheard a\nfew words of a jest that seemed the reason for the laughter.\n\nIn Rajputana, as in other portions of the East, men laugh with meaning\nas a rule, and seldom from mere amusement. Included in the laugh there\nusually lies more than a hint of threat, or hate, or cruelty. And, in\npartial confirmation of the jest she unintentionally overheard, she saw\nno servant go to the chuckling spring to fill a water-jar. She recalled\nthat Jaimihr only sipped as much as he could dip up in the hollow of his\nhand, and that physical exertion and suffering of the sort that he had\nundergone produces prodigious thirst in that hot, dry atmosphere.\n\nShe waited until dark for Cunninham, growing momentarily more restless.\nShe recalled that she was a guest of Alwa's, and as such not free to\ninterfere with his arrangements or to suggest insinuations anent his\ntreatment of prisoners. She recalled the pride of all Rajputs, and its\naccompanying corollary of insolence when offended. There would come no\ngood--she knew--from asking anybody whether Jaimihr was allowed to drink\nor not.\n\nCunningham, with that middle-aged air of authority laid over the fire\nand ability of youth, would be able, no doubt, to enforce his wishes in\nthe matter after finding out the truth about it. But Cunningham did not\ncome; and she remembered from a short experience of her own what thirst\nwas.\n\nThe men-at-arms were all on the ramparts now, watching the leaderless\ncavalry on the plain. They had even left the cell door unguarded, for it\nwas held shut by a heavy beam that could not be reached from the inside;\nand they were all too few, even all of them together, to hold that rock\nagainst eight hundred. It was characteristic, though, and Eastern of the\nEast, that they should omit to padlock the big beam. It pivoted at its\ncentre on a big bronze pin, and even a child could move it from the\noutside; it was only from the inside that it was uncontrollable. From\ninside one could have jerked at the door for a week and the big beam\nwould have lain still and efficient in its niche in the rock-wall; but\na little pressure underneath one end would send it swinging in an arc\nuntil it hung bolt upright. Then the same child who had pushed it up\ncould have swung the teak door wide.\n\nRosemary, growing momentarily thirstier herself as she thought of the\nprobable torture of the prisoner, walked down to the spring and filled\na dipper, as she had done half a dozen times a day since she first\narrived. She had carried almost all her own and her father's water,\nfor Joanna was generally sleeping somewhere out of view, and no other\nbody-servant had been provided for her. There was a fairly big brass\npitcher by the spring. She filled it. Nobody noticed her.\n\nThen she recalled that nobody would notice her if she were to carry the\nbrass pitcher in the direction of her room, for she had done that often.\nShe picked it up, and she reached the end of the veranda with it without\nhaving called attention to herself. She set it down then to make quite\nsure that she was unobserved.\n\nBut some movement of the cavalry on the plain below was keeping the eyes\nof the garrison employed. Although a solitary lantern shone full on her,\nshe reached the passage leading to the prisoner's cell unseen; and she\nwalked on down it, making no attempt to hide or hurry, remembering that\nshe was acting out of mercy and had no need to be ashamed. If she were\nto be discovered, then she would be, and that was all about it, except\nthat she would probably be able to appeal to Cunningham to save her from\nunpleasant consequences. In any case, she reasoned, she would have done\ngood. She was quite ready to get herself and her own in trouble if by\ndoing it she could insure that a prisoner had water.\n\nBut she was not seen. And no one saw her set the jar down by the door.\nNo one except the prisoner inside heard her knock.\n\n\"Have you water, Jaimihr-sahib?\" she inquired.\n\nThe East has a hundred florid epithets for one used in the West; and\nin a land where water is as scarce as gold and far more precious the\nmention of water to a thirsty man calls forth a flood of thought such\nas only music or perhaps religion can produce in luckier climes. Jaimihr\nwaxed eloquent; more eloquent than even water might have made him had\nanother--had even another woman--brought it. He recognized her voice,\nand said things to her that roused all the anger that she knew. She had\nnot come to be made love to.\n\nShe thought, though, of his thirst. She remembered that within an hour\nor two he might be raving for another reason and with other words. The\nbig beam lifted on her hands with barely more effort than was needed\nto lift up the water-jar; the door opened a little way, and she tried,\nwhile she passed the water in, to peer through the darkness at the\nprisoner. But there were no windows to that cell, and such dim light as\nthere was came from behind her.\n\n\"They have bound me, sahiba, in this corner,\" groaned Jaimihr. \"I cannot\nreach it. Take it away again! The certainty that it is there and out of\nreach is too great torture!\"\n\nSo she slipped in through the door, leaving it open a little way--both\nher hands busy with the brass pitcher and both eyes straining their\nutmost through the gloom--advancing step by step through mouldy straw\nthat might conceal a thousand horrors.\n\n\"You wonder, perhaps, why I do not escape!\" said a voice. And then she\nheard the cell door close again gently.\n\nNow she could see Jaimihr, for he stood with his back against the door,\nand his head was between her and the little six-inch grating that was\nall the ventilation or light a prisoner in that place was allowed.\n\n\"So you lied to me, even when I brought you water?\" she answered. She\nwas not afraid. She had nerve enough left to pity him.\n\n\"Yes. But I see that you did not lie. I am still thirsty, sahiba.\"\n\nHe held out both hands, and she could see them dimly. There were no\nchains on them, and he was not bound in any way. She gave him the jar.\n\n\"Let me pass out again before you drink,\" she ordered. \"It is not known\nthat I am in here, and I would not have it known.\"\n\nShe could have bitten out her tongue with mortification a moment\nafterward for letting any such admission escape her. She heard him\nchuckle as he drank--he choked from chuckling, and set the jar down\nto cough. Then, when he had recovered breath again, he answered almost\npatronizingly.\n\n\"Which would be least pleased with you, sahiba? The Rangars, or thy\nfather, or the other Englishman? But never mind, sahiba, we are friends.\nI have proved that we are friends. Never have I taken water from the\nhands of any man or any woman not of my own caste. I would have died\nsooner. It was only thou, sahiba, who could make me set aside my caste.\"\n\n\"Let me pass!\"\n\nShe certainly was frightened now. It dawned on her, as it had at once on\nhim, that at the least commotion on his part or on hers a dozen Rangars\nwould be likely to come running. And just as he had done, she wondered\nwhat explanation she would give in that case, and who would be likely\nto believe it. To have been caught going to the cell would have been one\nthing; to be caught in it would be another. He divined her thoughts.\n\n\"Have no fear, sahiba. Thou and I are friends.\"\n\nShe did not answer, for words would not come. Besides, she was beginning\nto realize that words would be of little help to her. A woman who will\ntell nothing but the truth under any circumstances and will surely keep\nher promises is at a disadvantage when conversing with a man who surely\nwill not tell the truth if he can help it and who regards his given word\nwith almost equal disrespect.\n\n\"I have no fear, sahiba. I am not afraid to open this door wide and make\na bid for liberty. It would not be wise, that is all, and thou--and I\nmust deal in wisdom.\"\n\nHis words came through the dark very evenly--spaced evenly--as though\nhe weighed each one of them before he voiced it. She gathered the\nimpression that he was thinking for his very life. She felt unable to\nthink for her own. She felt impelled to listen--incredulous, helpless,\nfrightened,--not a little ashamed. She was thinking more of the awful\nthings those Moslem gentlemen would say about her should they come and\ndiscover her in Jaimihr's cell.\n\n\"Listen, sahiba! From end to end of India thy people are either dead, or\nelse face to face with death. There is no escape anywhere for any man or\nwoman--no hope, no chance. The British doom is sealed. So is the doom of\nevery man who dared to side with them.\"\n\nShe shuddered. But she had to listen.\n\n\"There will be an army here within a day or two. My men--and I number\nthem by thousands--will come and rip these Rangars from their roost.\nThose that are not crucified will be thrown down from the summit, and\nthere shall be a Hindoo shrine where they have worshipped their false\ngod. Then, sahiba, if thou art here--perhaps--there might--yet--be a\nway-perhaps, yes?--a way, still, to escape me?\"\n\nShe was trembling. She could not help beginning to believe him. Whatever\nmight be true of what he said was certainly not comforting.\n\n\"But, while my army comes in search of me, my brother Howrah will be\nmaking merry with my palace and belongings. There will be devastation\nand other things in my army's rear for which there is no need and\nfor which I have no stomach. I detest the thought of them, sahiba.\nTherefore, sahiba, I would drive a bargain. Notice, sahiba, I say not\none word of love, though love such as mine is has seldom been offered\nto a woman. I say no word of love--as yet. I say, help me to escape by\nnight, when I may make my way unseen back to my men: enable me to reach\nHowrah before my dear brother is aware of my trouble and before his men\ncan start plundering, and name your own terms, sahiba!\"\n\nName her own terms--name her own terms--name her own terms! The words\ndinned through her head and she could grasp no other thought. She was\nalone in a cell with Jaimihr, and she could get out of it if she would\nname her terms! She must name them--she must hurry--what were they? What\nwere her terms? She could not think.\n\n\"Understand, sahiba. Certain things are sure. It is sure my men will\ncome. It is sure that every Rangar on this rock will meet a very far\nfrom pleasant death--\"\n\nHe grinned, and though she could not see him grin, she knew that he was\ndoing it. She knew that he was even then imagining a hundred horrors\nthat the Rangars would endure before they died. She might name her\nterms. She could save them.\n\n\"No!\" she hissed hoarsely. \"No! They are my terms! I name them! You must\nspare them--spare the Rangars--spare every man on this hill, and theirs,\nand all they have!\"\n\n\"Truly are those thy terms, sahiba?\"\n\n\"Truly! What others can I ask?\"\n\n\"They are granted, sahiba!\"\n\n\"Oh, thank God!\"\n\nShe knew that he was speaking at least half the truth. She knew his\npower. She knew enough of Howrah City's politics to be convinced that\nhe would not be left at the mercy of a little band of Rangars. She knew\nthat there were not enough Rangars on the whole countryside to oppose\nthe army that would surely come to his rescue. And whether he were dead\nor living, she knew well enough that the vengeance would be wreaked on\nevery living body on the hill. Alwa might feel confident, not she. She\ntrembled now with joy at the thought that she--she the most helpless and\nuseless of all of them--might save the lives of all.\n\nBut then another phase of the problem daunted her. She might help\nJaimihr go. He might escape unobserved with her aid. But then? What\nthen? What would the Rangars do to her? Had she sufficient courage to\nface that? It was not fear now that swept over her so much as wonder at\nherself. Jaimihr detected something different in her mental attitude,\nand, since almost any change means weakness to the Oriental mind, he\nwas quick to try to take advantage of it. He guessed right at the first\nattempt.\n\n\"And what wilt thou do here, sahiba? When I am gone, and there is none\nhere to love thee--\"\n\n\"Peace!\" she commanded. \"Peace! I have suffered enough--\"\n\n\"Thou wilt suffer more, should the Rangars learn--\"\n\n\"That is my business! Let me pass! I have bargained, and I will try to\nfulfil my part!\"\n\nShe stepped toward the door, but he held out both his arms and she saw\nthem. She had no intention of being embraced by him, whatever their\nconspiracy.\n\n\"Stand back!\" she ordered.\n\n\"Nay, nay, sahiba! Listen! Escape with me! These Rangars will not\nbelieve without proof that thou hast saved their lives by bargaining.\nThey will show thee short shrift indeed when my loss is discovered. Come\nnow and I will make thee Maharanee in a week!\"\n\n\"I would be as safe with one as with the other!\" she laughed, something\nof calm reflection returning to her. \"And what proof have I in any case\nthat you will keep your word, Jaimihr-sahib. I will keep mine--but who\nwill keep yours, that has been so often broken?\"\n\n\"Sahiba--\"\n\n\"Show me a proof!\"\n\n\"Here--now--in this place?\"\n\n\"Convince me, if you can! I will give myself willingly if I can save my\nfather by it and these Rangars and Mr. Cunningham; but your bare word,\nJaimihr-sahib, is worth that!\"\n\nShe snapped her fingers, and he swore beneath his breath. Then he\nremembered his ambition and his present need, and words raced to his\naid--words, plans, oaths, treachery, and all the hundred and one tricks\nthat he was used to. He found himself consciously selecting from a dozen\ndifferent plans for tricking her.\n\n\"Sahiba\"--he spoke slowly and convincingly. In the gloom she could\nsee his brown eyes levelled straight at hers, and she saw they did not\nflinch--\"there is none who knows better than thou knowest how my brother\nand I stand to each other.\" She shuddered at the reiterated second\nperson singular, but he either did not notice it or else affected not\nto. \"Thou know est that there is no love between him and me, and that\nI would have his throne. The British could set me on that throne unless\nthey were first overwhelmed. Wert thou my legal wife, and were I to aid\nthe British in this minute of their need, they would not be overwhelmed,\nand afterward they would surely set me on the throne. Therefore I pledge\nmy word to lead my men to the Company's aid, provided that these Rangars\nride to my aid. My brother plans to overcome me first, and then take\narms against the British. If the Rangars come to help me I will ride\nwith them to the Company's aid afterward. That is my given word!\"\n\n\"Then the throne of Howrah is your price, Jaimihr-sahib?\"\n\n\"Thou art the price and the prize, sahiba! For thee I would win the\nthrone!\"\n\nShe actually laughed, and he winced palpably. There was no doubt that he\nloved her after a manner of his own, and her contempt hurt him.\n\n\"I have said all I can say,\" he told her. \"I have promised all I can\npromise. What more is there to say or offer? If I stay here, I swear on\nthe honor of a Rajput and a prince of royal blood, that every living\nman and woman on this rock, excepting thee only, shall be dead within a\nweek. But if I escape by thy aid, and if, at thy instance, these Rangars\nand their friends ride to my help against my brother, then I will throw\nall my weight--men and influence--in the scale on the British side.\"\n\n\"And--?\"\n\n\"And thou shalt be Maharanee!\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"But in case that the British should be beaten before we reach them,\nthen, sahiba! Then in case of thy need!\"\n\n\"Jaimihr-sahib, I will help you to escape tonight on the terms that you\nhave named--that you spare these Rangars and every living body on this\nhill. Then I will do my utmost to persuade the Rangars to ride to your\nassistance on your condition, that you lead your men to help the British\nafterward. And if my action in helping you escape should make the\nRangars turn against me and my immediate friends, I shall claim your\nprotection. Is that agreed?\"\n\n\"Sahiba--absolutely!\"\n\n\"Then let me pass!\"\n\nReluctantly he stood aside. She slipped out and let the bar down\nunobserved. But she had not recovered all her self-possession when she\nreached the courtyard.\n\n\"Evening, Miss McClean,\" said Cunningham; and she all but fainted, she\nwas strained to such a pitch of nervousness.\n\n\"Where have you come from, Miss McClean?\" asked Cunningham. And she told\nhim. She was not quite so stiff-chinned as she had been.\n\n\"What were you doing there?\"\n\nShe told him that, too.\n\n\"Where is your father?\"\n\n\"In his chair on the veranda, Mr. Cunningham. There, in that deep\nshadow.\"\n\n\"Come to him, please. I want your explanation in his presence.\"\n\nShe followed as obediently as a child. The sense of guilt--of fright--of\nimpending judgment left her as she walked with him, and gave place to a\nglow of comfort that here should be a man on whom to lean. She did not\nfight the new sensation, for she was growing strangely weary of the\nother one. By the time that they had reached her father, and he was\nstanding before Cunningham wiping his spectacles in his nervous way, she\nhad completely recovered her self-possession, although it is likely she\nwould not have given any reason for it to herself.\n\nCunningham held a lantern up, so that he could study both their faces.\nHis own face muscles were set rigidly, and he questioned them as\nhe might have cross-examined a spy caught in the act. His voice was\nuncompromising, and his manner stern.\n\n\"Do you both understand how serious this situation is?\" he asked.\n\n\"We naturally do,\" said Duncan McClean. The Scotsman was beginning to\nbetray an inclination to bridle under the youngster's attitude, and to\nshow an equally pronounced desire not to appear to. \"More so, probably,\nthan anybody else!\"\n\n\"Are you positive--both of you--you too, Mr. McClean--that all that talk\nabout treasure in Howrah City is not mere imagination and legend?\"\n\n\"Absolutely positive!\" They both answered him at once, both looking in\nhis eyes across the unsteady rays of the flickering, smoky lamp. \"The\namount has been, of course, much exaggerated,\" said McClean, \"but I have\nno doubt there is enough there to pay the taxes of all India for a year\nor two.\"\n\n\"Then I have another question to ask. Do you both--or do you\nnot--place yourselves at the service of the Company? It is likely to be\ndangerous--a desperate service. But the Company needs all that it can\nmuster.\"\n\n\"Of course we do!\" Again both answered in one breath.\n\n\"Do you understand that that involves taking my orders?\"\n\nThis time Duncan McClean did the answering, and now it was he who seized\nthe lamp. He held it high, and scanned Cunningham's face as though he\nwere reading a finely drawn map.\n\n\"We are prepared--I speak for my daughter as well as for myself--to obey\nany orders that you have a right to give, young man.\"\n\n\"You misunderstand me,\" answered Cunningham. \"I am offering you the\nopportunity to serve the Company. As the Company's senior officer in the\nneighborhood, I am responsible to the Company for such orders as I see\nfit to give. I could not have my orders questioned. I don't mind telling\nyou that I'm asking you, as British subjects, no more than I intend to\nask Alwa and his Rangars. You can do as much as they are going to be\nasked to do. You can't do more. But you can do less if you like. You\nare being given the opportunity now to offer your services\nunconditionally--that is to say in the only manner in which I will\naccept them. Otherwise you will remain non-combatants, and I shall take\nsuch measures for your safety as I see fit. Time presses. Your answer,\nplease!\"\n\n\"I will obey your legal orders,\" said McClean, still making full use of\nthe lantern.\n\n\"I refuse to admit the qualification,\" answered Cunningham promptly.\n\"Either you will obey, or you will not. You are asked to say which, that\nis all.\"\n\n\"I will obey,\" said Rosemary McClean quietly. She said it through\nstraight lips and in a level voice that carried more assurance than a\nstring of loud-voiced oaths.\n\n\"And you, sir?\"\n\n\"Since my daughter sees fit to--ah--capitulate, I have no option.\"\n\n\"Be good enough to be explicit.\"\n\n\"I agree to obey your orders.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" He seemed to have finished with McClean. He turned away\nfrom him and faced Rosemary, not troubling to examine her face closely\nas he had done her father's, but seeming none the less to give her full\nattention. \"I understood you to say that you promised to help Prince\nJaimihr to escape from his cell tonight?\"\n\n\"WHAT?\"\n\nDuncan McClean could not have acted such amazement. Cunningham desired\nno further evidence that he had not been accessory to his daughter's\nvisit to the prisoner. He silenced him with a gesture. And now his eyes\nseemed for the time being to have finished with both of them; in spite\nof the darkness they both knew that he had resumed the far-away look\nthat seemed able to see things finished.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rosemary. \"I promised. I had to.\"\n\nHer father gasped. But Cunningham appeared to follow an unbroken chain\nof thought, and she listened.\n\n\"Well. You will both realize readily that we, as British subjects, are\nranged all together on one side opposed to treachery, as represented\nby the large majority of the natives. That means that our first\nconsideration must be to keep our given word. What we say,--what we\npromise--what we boast--must tally with what we undertake, and at the\nleast try, to do. You must keep your word to Jaimihr, Miss McClean!\"\n\nShe stared back at Cunningham through wide, unfrightened eyes. Whatever\nthis man said to her, she seemed unable to feel fear while she had his\nattention. Her father seemed utterly bewildered, and she held his hand\nto reassure him.\n\n\"On the other hand, we cannot be guilty of a breach of faith to our\nfriend Alwa here. I must have a little talk with him before I issue any\norders. Please wait here and--ah--do nothing while I talk to Alwa. Did\nyou--ah--did you agree to marry Jaimihr, should he make you Maharanee?\"\n\n\"No! I told him I would rather die!\"\n\n\"Thank you. That makes matters easier. Now tell me over again from\nthe beginning what you know about the political situation in Howrah.\nQuickly, please. Consider yourself a scout reporting to his officer.\"\n\nTen minutes later Cunninham heard a commotion by the parapet, and\nstalked off to find Alwa, close followed by Mahommed Gunga. The grim old\nRajput was grinning in his beard as he recognized the set of what might\nhave been Cunningham the elder's shoulders.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\n    Ye may go and lay your praise\n    At a shrine of other days\n    By the tomb of him who gat, and her who bore me;\n    My plan is good--my way--\n    The sons of kings obey--\n    But, I'm reaping where another sowed before me.\n\n\nJAIDEV SINGH was a five-K man, with the hair, breeches, bangle, comb,\nand dagger that betoken him who has sworn the vow of Khanda ka Pahul.\nEvery item of the Sikh ritual was devised with no other motive than to\npreserve the fighting character of the organization. The very name Singh\nmeans lion. The Sikh's long hair with the iron ring hidden underneath\nis meant as a protection against sword-cuts. And because their faith\nis rather spiritual than fanatical--based rather on the cause of\nthings than on material effect--men of that creed take first rank among\nfighting men.\n\nJaidev Singh arrived soon after the moon had risen. The notice of\nhis coming was the steady drumming footfall of his horse, that slowed\noccasionally, and responded to the spur again immediately.\n\nClose to the big iron gate below Alwa's eyrie there were some of\nJaimihr's cavalry nosing about among the trampled gardens for the dead\nand wounded they had left there earlier in the afternoon. They ceased\nsearching, and formed up to intercept whoever it might be who rode in\nsuch a hurry. Above them, on the overhanging ramparts, there was quick\ndiscussion, and one man left his post hurriedly.\n\n\"A horseman from the West!\" he announced, breaking in on Alwa's privacy\nwithout ceremony.\n\n\"One?\"\n\n\"One only.\"\n\n\"For us or them?\"\n\n\"I know not, sahib.\"\n\nAlwa--glad enough of the relief from puzzling his brain--ran to the\nrampart and looked long at the moving dot that was coming noisily toward\nhis fastness but that gave no sign of its identity or purpose.\n\n\"Whoever he is can see them,\" he vowed. \"The moon shines full on them.\nEither he is a man of theirs or else a madman!\"\n\nHe watched for five more minutes without speaking. Cunningham and\nMahommed Gunga, coming out at last in search of him, saw the strained\nfigures of the garrison peering downward through the yellow moon\nrays, and took stand on either side of him to gaze, too, in spellbound\nsilence.\n\n\"If he is their man,\" said Alwa presently, \"he will turn now. He will\nchange direction and ride for the main body of them yonder. He can see\nthem now easily. Yes. See. He is their man!\"\n\nOn a horse that staggered gamely--silhouetted and beginning to show\ndetail in the yellow light--a man whose nationality or caste could not\nbe recognized rode straight for the bivouacking cavalry, and a swarm of\nthem rode out at a walk to meet him.\n\nThe tension on the ramparts was relaxed then. As a friend in direst need\nthe man would have been welcome. As one of enemy, with a message for\nthem, however urgent, he was no more than an incident.\n\n\"By Allah!\" roared Alwa suddenly. \"That is no man of theirs! Quick! To\nthe wheels! Man the wheels! Eight men to horse!\"\n\nHe took the cord himself, to send the necessary signal down into the\nbelly of the rock. From his stables, where men and horses seemed to\nstand ready day and night, ten troopers cantered out, scattering\nthe sparks, the whites of their horses' eyes and their drawn blades\ngleaming; without another order they dipped down the breakneck gorge,\nto wait below. The oncoming rider had wheeled again; he had caught the\ncavalry, that rode to meet him, unawares. They were not yet certain\nwhether he was friend or foe, and they were milling in a bunch, shouting\norders to one another. He, spurring like a maniac, was heading straight\nfor the searching party, who had formed to cut him off. He seemed to\nhave thrown his heart over Alwa's iron gate and to be thundering on\nhell's own horse in quest of it again.\n\nAlwa's eight slipped down the defile as quickly as phantoms would have\ndared in that tricky moon-light. One of them shouted from below. Alwa\njerked the cord, and the great gate yawned, well-oiled and silent.\nThe oncomer raced straight for the middle of the intercepting line of\nhorsemen; they--knowing him by this time for no friend--started to meet\nhim; and Alwa's eight, unannounced and unexpected, whirled into them\nfrom the rear.\n\nIn a second there was shouting, blind confusion--eddying and trying\nto reform. The lone galloper pulled clear, and Alwa's men drove his\nopponents, crupper over headstall, into a body of the main contingent\nwho had raced up in pursuit. They rammed the charge home, and reeled\nthrough both detachments--then wheeled at the spur and cut their way\nback again, catching up their man at the moment that his horse dropped\ndead beneath him. They seized him beneath the arms and bore him through\nas the great gate dropped and cut his horse in halves. Then one man took\nthe galloper up behind his saddle, and bore him up the hill unquestioned\nuntil he could dismount in front of Alwa.\n\n\"Who art thou?\" demanded the owner of the rock, recognizing a warrior\nby his trademarks, but in no way moderating the natural gruffness of\nhis voice. Alwa considered that his inviolable hospitality should be too\nwell known and understood to call for any explanation or expression; he\nwould have considered it an insult to the Sikh's intelligence to have\nmouthed a welcome; he let it go for granted.\n\n\"Jaidev Singh--galloper to Byng-bahadur. I bring a letter for the\nRisaldar Mahommed Gunga, or for Cunnigan-sahib, whichever I can find\nfirst.\"\n\n\"They are both here.\"\n\n\"Then my letter is for both of them.\"\n\nCunningham and Mahommed Gunga each took one step forward, and the Sikh\ngave Cunningham a tiny, folded piece of paper, stuck together along\none edge with native gum. He tore it open, read it in the light of\na trooper's lantern, and then read it again aloud to Mahommed Gunga,\npitching his voice high enough for Alwa to listen if he chose.\n\n\"What are you two men doing?\" ran the note. \"The very worst has\nhappened. We all need men immediately, and I particularly need them. One\nhundred troopers now would be better than a thousand men a month from\nnow. Hurry, and send word by bearer. S. F. BYNG.\"\n\n\"How soon can you start back?\" asked Cunningham.\n\n\"The minute I am provided with a horse, sahib.\"\n\nCunningham turned to Alwa.\n\n\"Will you be kind enough to feed him, Alwa-sahib?\"\n\nAlwa resented the imputation against his hospitality instantly.\n\n\"Nay, I was waiting for his money in advance!\" he laughed. \"Food waits,\nthou. Thou art a Sikh--thou eatest meat--meat, then, is ready.\"\n\nThe Sikh, or at least the true Sikh, is not hampered by a list of caste\nrestrictions. All of his precepts, taken singly or collectively, bid him\nbe nothing but a man, and no law forbids him accept the hospitality of\nsoldiers of another creed. So Jaidev Singh walked off to feed on curried\nbeef that would have made a Hindoo know himself for damned. Cunningham\nthen turned on Alwa.\n\n\"Now is the time, Alwa-sahib,\" he said in a level voice. \"My party can\nstart off with this man and our answer, if your answer is no. If your\nanswer is yes, then the Sikh can bear that answer for us.\"\n\n\"You would none of you ride half a mile alive!\" laughed Alwa.\n\n\"I none the less require an answer, Alwa-sahib.\"\n\nAlwa stared hard at him. That was the kind of talk that went straight to\nhis soldier heart. He loved a man who held to his point in the teeth of\nodds. The odds, it seemed to him, were awfully against Cunningham.\n\n\"So was thy father,\" he said slowly. \"My cousin said thou wast thy\nfather's son!\"\n\n\"I require an answer by the time that the Sikh has finished eating,\"\nsaid Cunningham. \"Otherwise, Alwa-sabib, I shall regret the necessity of\nforegoing further hospitality at your hands.\"\n\n\"Bismillah! Am I servant here or master?\" wondered Alwa, loud enough for\nall his men to hear. Then he thought better of his dignity. \"Sahib,\"\nhe insisted, \"I will not talk here before my men. We will have another\nconference.\"\n\n\"I concede you ten minutes,\" said Cunningham, preparing to follow him,\nand followed in turn by Mohammed Gunga.\n\n\"Now, swore the Risaldar into his beard, we shall see the reaching of\ndecisions! Now, by the curse of the sack of Chitor we shall know who is\non whose side, or I am no Rangar, nor the son of one!\"\n\n\"I have a suggestion to make, sahib,\" smiled Alwa, closing the door of\nthe rock-hewn chamber on the three of them.\n\n\"Hear mine first!\" said Cunningham, with a hint of iron in his voice.\n\n\"Ay! Hear his first! Hear Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur!\" echoed Mahommed\nGunga. \"Let us hear a plan worth hearing!\" And Alwa looked into a pair\nof steady eyes that seemed to see through him--past him--to the finished\nwork beyond.\n\n\"Speak, sahib.\"\n\n\"You are pledged to uphold Howrah on his throne?\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib.\"\n\n\"Then, I guarantee you shall! You shall not go to the Company's aid\nuntil you have satisfactory guarantees that your homes and friends will\nnot be assailed behind your backs.\"\n\n\"Guarantees to whose satisfaction, sahib?\"\n\n\"Yours!\"\n\n\"But with whom am I dealing?\" Alwa seemed actually staggered. \"Who makes\nthese promises? The Company?\"\n\n\"I give you my solemn word of honor on it!\"\n\n\"It is at least a man who speaks!\" swore Alwa.\n\n\"It is the son of Cunnigan-bahadur!\" growled Mahommed Gunga, standing\nchin erect. He seemed in no doubt now of the outcome. He was merely\nwaiting for it with soldierly and ill-concealed impatience.\n\n\"But, sahib--\"\n\n\"Alwa-sahib, we have no time for argument. It is yes or no. I must send\nan answer back by that Sikh. He must--he shall take my answer! Either\nyou are loyal to our cause or you are not. Are you?\"\n\n\"By the breath of God, sahib, I am thinking you leave me little choice!\"\n\n\"I still await an answer. I am calling on you for as many men as you can\nraise, and I have made you specific promises. Choose, Alwa-sahib. Yes or\nno?\"\n\n\"The answer is yes--but--\"\n\n\"Then I understand that you undertake to obey my orders without\nquestion until such time as a senior to me can be found to take over the\ncommand.\"\n\n\"That is contingent on the agreement,\" hesitated Alwa.\n\n\"I would like your word of honor, Alwa-sahib.\"\n\n\"I pledge that not lightly, sahib.\"\n\n\"For that very good reason I am asking for it. I shall know how far to\ntrust when I have your word of honor!\"\n\n\"I knew thy father! Thou art his son! I trusted him for good reason\nand with good result. I will trust thee also. My word is given, on thy\nconditions, sahib. First, the guarantees before we ride to the British\naid!\"\n\nAnd you obey my orders?\n\n\"Yes. My word is given, sahib. The oath of a Rajput, of a Rangar, of a\nsoldier, of a zemindar of the House of Kachwaha; the oath of a man to\na man, sahib; the promise of thy father's friend to thy father's son!\nBahadur\"--he drew himself to his full height, and clicked his spurs\ntogether--\"I am thy servant!\"\n\nCunningham saluted. All three men looked in each other's eyes and a bond\nwas sealed between them that nothing less than death could sever.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Cunningham quite quietly. \"And now, Alwa-sahib\"--(he\ncould strike while the iron glowed, could this son of Cunnigan!)--\"for\nthe plan. There is little time. Jaimihr must escape tonight!\"\n\n\"Sahib, did I understand aright?\"\n\nAlwa's jaw had actually dropped. He looked as though he had been struck.\nMahommed Gunga slammed his sabre ferule on the stone floor. He too, was\nhard put to it to believe his ears.\n\n\"Jaimihr is the key to the position. He is nothing but a nuisance where\nhe is. Outside he can be made to help us.\"\n\n\"Am I dreaming, or art thou, sahib?\" Alwa stood with fists clinched on\nhis hips and his legs apart--incredulous. \"Jaimihr to go free? Why that\nHindoo pig is the source of all the trouble in the district!\"\n\n\"We are neither of us dreaming, Alwa-sahib. Jaimihr is the dreamer. Let\nhim dream in Howrah City for a day or two, while we get ready. Let him\nlead his men away and leave the road clear for us to pass in and out.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know. He is your prisoner, and your honor is involved, and all\nthat kind of thing. I'm offering you, to set off against that, a much\ngreater honor than you ever experienced in your whole life yet, and I've\nput my order in the shape of a request for the sake of courtesy. I ask\nyou again to let me arrange for Jaimihr to escape.\"\n\n\"I was mad. But it seems that I have passed my word!\" swore Alwa.\n\n\"I give you your word back again, then.\"\n\n\"Bismillah! I refuse it!\"\n\n\"Then I do with Jaimihr as I like?\"\n\n\"I gave my word, sahib.\"\n\n\"Thanks. You'll be glad before we've finished. Now I've left the raising\nof as many men as can be raised to you, Alwa-sahib. You will remember\nthat you gave your promise on that count, too.\"\n\n\"I will keep that promise, too, sahib.\"\n\n\"Good. You shall have a road clear by tonight.\"\n\nHe stepped back a pace, awaited their salute with the calm, assured\nauthority of a general of division, returned it, and left the two\nRajputs looking in each other's eyes.\n\n\"What is this, cousin, that thou hast brought me to?\" demanded Alwa.\n\nMahommed Gunga laughed and shook his sabre, letting it rattle in its\nscabbard.\n\n\"This? This is the edge of the war that I promised thee a year ago!\nThis is the service of which I spoke! This is the beginning of the\nblood-spilling! I have brought thee the leader of whom we spoke in\nHowrah City. Dost remember, cousin? I recall thy words!\"\n\n\"Ay, I recall them. I said then that I would follow a second Cunnigan,\ncould such be found.\"\n\n\"And this is he!\" vowed Mahommed Gunga.\n\n\"Ho! But we Rangars have a leader! A man of men!\"\n\n\"But this plan of his? This loosing of the trapped wolf--what of that?\"\n\n\"I neither know nor care, as yet! I trust him! I am his man, as I was\nhis father's! I have seen him; I have heard him; I have felt his pulse\nin the welter of the wrath of God. I know him. Whatever plans he makes,\nwhatever way he leads, those are my plans, my road! I serve the son of\nCunnigan!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\n    Did he swear with his leg in a spring-steel trap\n    And a tongue dry-cracked from thirst?\n    Or down on his knees at his lady's lap\n    With the lady's lips to his own, mayhap,\n    And his head and his heart aburst?\n    Nay! I have listened to vows enough\n    And never the oath could bind\n    Save that, that a free man chose to take\n    For his own good reputation's sake!\n    They're qualified--they're tricks--they break--\n    They're words, the other kind!\n\n\nMAHOMMED GUNGA had long ago determined to \"go it blind\" on Cunningham.\nHe had known him longest and had the greatest right. Rosemary McClean,\nwho knew him almost least of all, so far as length of time was\nconcerned, was ready now to trust him as far as the Risaldar dared go;\nher limit was as long and as devil-daring as Mahommed Gunga's. Whatever\nScots reserve and caution may have acted as a brake on Duncan McClean's\nenthusiasm were offset by the fact that his word was given; so far as\nhe was concerned, he was now as much and as obedient a servant of the\nCompany as either of the others. Nor was his attitude astonishing.\n\nAlwa's was the point of view that was amazing, unexpected, brilliant,\nsoldierly, unselfish--all the things, in fact, that no one had the least\nright to expect it to turn out to be. Two or three thousand men looked\nto him as their hereditary chieftain who alone could help them hold\ntheir chins high amid an overwhelming Hindoo population; his position\nwas delicate, and he might have been excused for much hesitation,\nand even for a point-blank refusal to do what he might have preferred\npersonally. He and his stood to lose all that they owned--their\nhonor--and the honor of their wives and families, should they fight on\nthe wrong side. Even as a soldier who had passed his word, he might have\nbeen excused for a lot of wordy questioning of orders, for he had enough\nat stake to make anybody cautious.\n\nYet, having said his say and sworn a dozen God-invoking Rangar oaths\nbefore he pledged his word, and then having pledged it, he threw Rajput\ntradition and the odds against him into one bottomless discard and\nproceeded to show Cunningham exactly what his fealty meant.\n\n\"By the boots and beard of Allah's Prophet!\" he swore, growing\nfreer-tongued now that his liberty of action had been limited. \"Here we\nstand and talk like two old hags, Mahommed Gunga! My word is given. Let\nus find out now what this fledgling general of thine would have us do.\nIf he is to release my prisoner, at least I would like to get amusement\nout of it!\"\n\nSo he and Mahommed Gunga swaggered across the courtyard to where\nCunningham had joined the McCleans again.\n\n\"We come with aid and not objections, sahib,\" he assured him. \"If we\nlisten, it may save explanations afterward.\"\n\nSo at a sign from Cunningham they enlarged the circle, and the East\nand West--bearded and clean-shaven, priest and soldiers, Christian and\nMohammedan--stood in a ring, while almost the youngest of them--by far\nthe youngest man of them--laid down the law for all. His eyes were all\nfor Rosemary McClean, but his gestures included all of them, and they\nall answered him with nods or grunts as each saw fit.\n\n\"Send for the Sikh!\" commanded Cunningham.\n\nFive minutes later, with a lump of native bread still in his fist,\nJaidev Singh walked up and saluted.\n\n\"Where is Byng-bahadur now?\" asked Cunningham.\n\n\"At Deeseera, sahib--not shut in altogether, but hard pressed. There\ncame cholera, and Byng-bahadur camped outside the town. He has been\nstriking, sahib, striking hard with all too few to help him. His\nirregulars, sahib, were disbanded at some one's orders just before this\noutbreak, but some of them came back at word from him. And there were\nsome of us Sikhs who knew him, and who would rather serve him and die\nthan fight against him and live. He has now two British regiments with\nhim, sadly thinned--some of my people, some Goorkhas, some men from the\nNorth--not very many more than two thousand men all told, having lost\nheavily in action and by disease. But word is going round from mouth to\nmouth that many sahibs have been superseded, and that only real sahibs\nsuch as Byng-bahadur have commands in this hour. Byng-bahadur is a man\nof men. We who are with him begin to have courage in our bones again.\nIs the answer ready? Yet a little while? It is well, sahib, I will rest.\nSalaam!\"\n\n\"You see,\" said Cunningham, \"the situation's desperate. We've got to\nact. Alwa here stands pledged to protect Howrah and you have promised to\naid Jaimihr. Somebody's word has got to break, and you may take it from\nme that it will be the word of the weakest man! I think that that man\nis Jaimihr, but I can't be sure in advance, and we've got to accept his\npromise to begin with. Go to him, Miss McClean, and make a very careful\nbargain with him along the line I mapped out for you. Alwa-sahib, I want\nwitnesses, or rather overhearers. I want you and Mahommed Gunga to place\nyourselves near Jaimihr's cell so that you can hear what he says. There\nwon't be any doubt then about who has broken promises. Are you ready,\nMiss McClean?\"\n\nShe was trembling, but from excitement and not fear. Both Rajputs\nsaluted her as she started back for the cell, and whatever their\nMohammedan ideas on women may have been, they chose to honor this one,\nwho was so evidently one of them in the hour of danger. Duncan McClean\nseemed to be praying softly, for his lips moved.\n\nWhen the cell-door creaked open, Alwa and Mahommed Gunga were crouched\none on either side, listening with the ears of soldiers that do not let\nmany sounds or words escape them.\n\n\"Jaimihr-sahib!\" she whispered. \"Jaimihr-sahib!\"\n\n\"Ha! Sahiba!\" Then he called her by half a dozen names that made the\nlistening Rangars grin into their beards.\n\n\"Jaimihr-sahib\"--she raised her voice a little now--\"if I help you to\nescape, will you promise me my safety under all conditions?\"\n\n\"Surely, sahiba!\"\n\n\"Do you swear to protect every living person on this hill, including the\nAlwa-sahib and Cunningham-sahib?\"\n\n\"Surely, sahiba.\"\n\n\"You swear it?\"\n\n\"I swear it on my honor. There is no more sacred oath.\"\n\n\"Then, listen. I can help you to escape now. I have a rope that is\nlong enough to lower you over the parapet. I am prepared to risk the\nconsequences, but I want to bargain with you for aid for my Countrymen.\"\n\nJaimihr did not answer.\n\n\"The Alwa-sahib and his Rangars stand pledged to help your brother!\"\n\n\"I guessed at least that much,\" laughed Jaimihr.\n\n\"They would not help you against him under any circumstances. But they\nwant to ride to the Company's aid, and they might be prepared to protect\nyou against him. They might guarantee the safety of your palace and your\nmen's homes. They might exact a guarantee from Howrah.\"\n\nJaimihr laughed aloud, careless of the risk of being overheard, and\nRosemary knew that Cunningham's little plan was useless even before\nit had been quite expounded. She felt herself trembling for the\nconsequences.\n\n\"Sahiba, there is only one condition that would make me ride to the\nBritish aid with all my men.\"\n\n\"Name it!\"\n\n\"Thou art it!\"\n\n\"I don't understand you, Jaimihr-sahib,\" she whispered, understanding\nall too well.\n\n\"Follow me. Come to me in Howrah. Then whatever these fool Rangars\nchoose to do, I swear by Siva and the Rites of Siva that I will hurry to\nthe Company's aid!\"\n\nRosemary McClean shuddered, and he knew it. But that fact rather added\nto his pleasure. The wolf prefers a cowering, frightened prey even\nthough he dare fight on occasion. She was thinking against time. Through\nthat one small, overburdened head, besides a splitting headache, there\nwas flashing the ghastly thought of what was happening to her countrymen\nand women--of what would happen unless she hurried to do something for\ntheir aid. All the burden of all warring India seemed to be resting on\nher shoulders, in a stifling cell; and Jaimihr seemed to be the only\nhelp in sight.\n\n\"How many men could you summon to the Company's aid?\" she asked him.\n\nHe laughed. \"Ten thousand!\" he boasted.\n\n\"Armed and drilled men--soldiers fit to fight?\"\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"I think that is a lie, Jaimihr-sahib. There is not time enough to waste\non lies. Tell me the exact truth, please.\"\n\nHe contrived to save his face, or, rather, he contrived to make himself\nbelieve he did.\n\n\"I would need some to guard my rear,\" he answered. \"I could lead five\nthousand to the British aid.\"\n\n\"Is that the truth?\"\n\n\"On my honor, sahiba.\"\n\n\"And you wish to marry me?\"\n\n\"Sahiba--I--I have no other wish!\"\n\n\"I agree to marry you provided you will lead five thousand men to the\nCompany's aid, but not until you have done so.\"\n\n\"You will come to Howrah?\"\n\nShe could feel his excitement. The cell walls seemed to throb.\n\n\"Yes; but I shall come accompanied by my father, and Mr. Cunningham, and\nall the Rangars he can raise. And I shall hold you to your bargain. You\nmust help the Company first. FIRST--d'you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\nIt was Jaimihr's turn now to lay the law down. She had let him see her\neagerness to gain his aid for the Company, and he saw the weakness of\nher case in an instant. He knew very well, too, that no woman of her\nbreed would have thought of consenting to marry him unless her hand was\nforced. He decided immediately to force it further.\n\n\"I understand, sahiba. I, too, will hold thee to thy promise! Thou wilt\ncome with an escort, as befits a prince's wife! But how should I know\nthat the Rangars would prove friends of mine? How should I know that it\nis not all a trap?\"\n\n\"You will have my promise to depend on.\"\n\n\"Truly! And there will be how many hundred men to override the promise\nof one woman? Nay! My word is good; my promise holds; but on my own\nconditions! Help me to escape. Then follow me to Howrah City. Come in\nadvance of thy Rangar escort. By that I will know that the Rangars and\nthis Cunningham are my friends--otherwise they would not let thee come.\nThe Rangars are to exact guarantees from my brother? How should I know\nthat they do not come to help my brother crush me out of existence? With\nthee in my camp as hostage I would risk agreement with them, but not\notherwise. Escape with me now, or follow. But bring no Rangars, sahiba!\nCome alone!\"\n\n\"I will not. I would not dare trust you.\"\n\nJaimihr laughed. \"I have been reckoning, sahiba, how many hours will\npass before my army comes to rip this nest of Alwa's from its roots, and\ndefile the whole of it! If I am to spare the people on this rock, then I\nmust hurry! Should my men come here to carry me away, they will be\nless merciful than I! Choose, sahiba! Let me go, and I will spare these\nRangars until such time as they earn punishment anew. Or let me go, and\nfollow me. Then fight with the Rangars and for the Company, with thee as\nthe price of my alliance. Or leave me in this cell until my men come to\nrescue me. The last would be the simplest way! Or it would be enough\nto help me escape and wait until I have done my share at conquering the\nBritish. Then I could come and claim thee! Choose, sahiba; there are\nmany ways, though they all end in one goal.\"\n\n\"If I am the price of your allegiance,\" said Rosemary, \"then I will pay\nthe price. Five thousand men for the British cause are dearer to me than\nmy own happiness. I promise, Jaimihr-sahib, that I will come to you in\nHowrah. I shall come accompanied by one servant, named Joanna, and--I\nthink--by my father; and the Rangars and Mr. Cunningham shall be at\nleast a day's ride behind me. I give my word on that. But--I can promise\nyou, on Mr. Cunningham's behalf, and on the Alwa-sahib's, and\nMahommed Gunga's, that should you have made any attempt against my\nliberty--should you have offered me any insult or indignity--before\nthey come--should you have tried to anticipate the terms of your\nagreement--then--then--there would be an end of bargaining and\npromises, Jaimihr-sahib, and your life would be surely forfeit! Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Surely, sahiba!\"\n\n\"Do you agree?\"\n\n\"I already have agreed. They are my terms. I named them!\"\n\n\"I would like to hear you promise, on your honor.\"\n\n\"I swear by all my gods and by my honor. I swear by my love, that is\ndearer to me than a throne, and by the name and the honor of a Rajput!\"\n\n\"Be ready, then. I am going now to hide the rope in the shadow of the\nwall. It will take perhaps fifteen minutes. Be ready.\"\n\nHe made a quick movement to embrace her, but she slipped out and escaped\nhim; and he thought better of his sudden plan to follow her, remembering\nthat her word was likely to be good, whatever his might be. He elected\nto wait inside until she returned for him. He little knew that he\nmissed the downward swing of Alwa's sabre, that was waiting, poised and\nbalanced for him, in the darkness by the door.\n\n\"Bismillah! I would have had a right to kill him had he followed her\nand broken faith so early in the business!\" Alwa swore, excusing his\nimpatience to Mahommed Gunga. \"Have no fear, sahib!\" he counselled\nCunningham a moment later, laying a heavy hand on the boy's arm. \"Let\nher keep her promises. That Hindoo pig will not keep his! We will\nbe after her, and surely--surely we will find good cause for some\nthroat-slitting as well as the cancelling of marriage promises!\"\n\n\"Do you understand, Alwa-sahib, that--if Jaimihr keeps his promise to\nher, she must keep hers to him? Do you realize that?\"\n\n\"Allah! Listen to him! Yes, sahib. Truly, bahadur, I appreciate! I also\nknow that I have given certain promises which I, too, must fulfil! She\nis not the only bargainer! I am worrying more about those guarantees\nthat Howrah was to give--I am anxious to see how, with fifteen hundred,\nwe are to get the better of a Rajah and his brother and their total of\nten thousand! I want to see those promises performed! Ay! The Miss-sahib\nhas done well. She has done her share. Let her continue. And do thou thy\nshare, bahadur! I am at thy back with my men, but give us action!\"\n\nCunningham held up a lantern, and looked straight at Duncan McClean.\nThe missionary had held his daughter's hand while she recounted what had\nhappened in the cell. Whatever he may have thought, he had uttered no\nword of remonstrance.\n\n\"Of course, we go to Howrah ahead of you,\" he answered to Cunningham's\nunspoken question.\n\nCunningham held out his right hand, and the missionary shook it.\n\n\"Hold the lamp, please,\" said Cunningham, and Mahommed Gunga seized it.\nThen Cunningham took paper and a pencil and read aloud the answer that\nhe wrote to Byng-bahadur. He wrote it in Greek characters for fear lest\nit might fall into the enemy's hands and be too well understood.\n\n\n\"I can be with you in one week, sir, and perhaps sooner. Unless we are\nall killed in the meantime we should number more than fifteen hundred\nwhen we come. Expect either all or none of us. The situation here is\ncritical, but our course seems clear, and we ought to pull through.\nMahommed Gunga sends salaams. Your obedient servant,\n\n                                        \"RALPH CUNNINGHAM.\"\n\n\"Would God I could see the clear course!\" laughed Alwa.\n\n\"Call the Sikh, please.\"\n\nThe Sikh came running, and Cunningham gave him the folded note.\n\n\"Have you a horse for him, Alwa-sahib?\"\n\n\"That has been attended to, sahib,\" the Sikh answered. \"The Alwa-sahib\nhas given me a wonder of a horse.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, Jaidev Singh. Watch your chance. Go to the parapet,\nand when you see by their lanterns that the cavalry below have ridden\noff, then race for all you're worth with that news for Byng-bahadur!\"\n\n\"Salaam, sahib!\" said the Sikh.\n\n\"Salaam, Jaidev Singh. And now hide, every-body! Don't let Jaimihr get\nthe impression that we're playing with him.\"\n\nA little later Miss McClean led Jaimihr through a passage in the rock,\noff which axe-hewn cells led on either side, to the far side of the\nsummit, where the parapet was higher but the wall was very much less\nsheer. The Prince's arms were still too sore from the wrenching he\nreceived when they took him prisoner for him to dare trust himself hand\nover hand on a rope; she had to make the rope fast beneath his armpits,\nand then lower him slowly, taking two turns with the rope round the\nwaist of a brass cannon. The Prince fended himself off the ragged wall\nwith hands and feet, and called up instructions to her as loudly as he\ndared.\n\nIt was a tremendous drop. For the last fifty or more feet the wall rose\nstraight, overhung by a ridge that rasped the rope. And the rope proved\nfifteen feet or more too short. Rosemary paid out as much of it as she\ndared, and then made the end fast round the cannon, leaning over to see\nwhether Jaimihr would have sense enough or skill enough to cut himself\nfree and fall. But he hung where he was and spun, and it was five\nminutes before Rosemary remembered that his weapons had all been taken\nfrom him! It was scarcely likely that he could bite the thick rope\nthrough with his teeth!\n\nShe stood then for two or three more minutes wondering what to do,\nfor she had no knife of her own, and she had made the rope\nfast--woman-wise--with a true landlubber's knot that tightened from the\nstrain until her struggling fingers could not make the least impression\non it. But Alwa walked up openly--drew his heavy sabre--and saved the\nsituation for her.\n\n\"That may help to jog his recollection of the bargain!\" he laughed,\nsevering the rope with a swinging cut and peering over to see, if he\ncould, how Jaimihr landed. By a miracle the Prince landed on his feet.\nHe sat down for a moment to recover from the shock, and then walked off\nawkwardly to where his cavalry were sleeping by their horses.\n\nHe had some trouble in persuading the outposts who he really was, and\nthere was an argument that could be quite distinctly heard from the\nsummit of the rock, and made Alwa roar with laughter before, finally,\nthe whole contingent formed and wheeled and moved away, ambling toward\nHowrah City at a pace that betokened no unwillingness.\n\nFive minutes later the Sikh's horse thundered out across the plain from\nunder Alwa's iron gate, and the news, such as it was, was on its way to\nByng-bahadur.\n\n\"A clear road at the price of a horse-hide rope!\" laughed Alwa. \"Now for\nsome real man's work!\"\n\nRosemary stole off to argue with her father and her conscience, but Alwa\nwent to his troopers' quarters and told off ten good men for the task\nof manning the fortress in his absence. They were ten unwilling men; it\nneeded all his gruff authority, and now and then a threat, to make them\nstay behind.\n\n\"I must leave ten men behind,\" he insisted. \"It takes four men, even at\na pinch, to lift the gate. And who shall guard my women? Nay, I should\nleave twenty, and I must leave ten. Therefore I leave the ten best men I\nhave, and they who stay behind may know by that that I consider them the\nbest!\"\n\nThe remainder of his troopers he sent out one by one in different\ndirections, with orders to rally every Rangar they could find, and at\na certain point he named. Then he and Mahommed Gunga said good-by to\nCunningham and took a trail that led in the direction where\nmost of the doubtfuls lived--the men who might need personal\nconvincing--rousing--awakening from lethargy.\n\n\"You think I ought to stay behind?\" asked Cunningham, who had already\nmade his mind up but chose to consult Alwa.\n\n\"Surely, sahib. If for no other reason, then to make sure that that\npriest of thine and his daughter make tracks for Howrah City! While he\nis here he is a priest, and we Rangars have our own ideas on what they\nare good for! When he is there he will be a man maneuvering to save his\nown life and his daughter's reputation! See that he starts, sahib!\"\n\nHe rode off then. But before Mahommed Gunga saw fit to follow him he\nlegged his charger close to Cunningham for a final word or two.\n\n\"Have no fear now, bahadur--no anxiety! Three days hence there will be\na finer regiment to lead than ever thundered in thy father's wake--a\nregiment of men, sahib, for a man to lead and love!--a regiment that\nwill trust thee, sahib! See thou to the guarantees! Rung Ho, bahadur!\"\n\n\"Rung Ho! See you again, Mahommed Gunga!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\n    Sabres and spurs and jingling bits--\n            (Ho!  But the food to feed them!)\n    Sinews and eyes and ears and wits--\n            (Hey!  But the troopers need them!)\n    Sahib, mount!  Thy chargers fling\n    Foam to the night--thy trumpets sing--\n    Thy lance-butts on the stirrups ring--\n            Mount, sahib!  Blood them!  Lead them!\n\n\nIT was arranged that the McCleans, with old Joanna, should start at dawn\nfor Howrah City, and they were, both of them, too overcome with mingled\ndread and excitement to even try to sleep. Joanna, very much as usual,\nsnoozed comfortably, curled in a blanket in a corner.\n\nThey would run about a hundred different risks, not least of which was\nthe chance of falling in with a party of Howrah's men. In fact, if they\nshould encounter anybody before bringing up at Jaimihr's palace it was\nlikely that the whole plan would fizzle into nothing.\n\nCunningham, after fossicking for a long time in Aliva's armory--that\ncontained, besides weapons of the date, a motley assortment of the\ntools of war that would have done great credit to a museum of\nantiquities--produced two pistols. He handed, one to the missionary and\none to Miss McClean, advising her to hide hers underneath her clothing.\n\"You know what they're for?\" he asked. \"No. You'd gain nothing by\nputting up a fight. They're loaded. All you've got to do is jerk the\nhammer back and pull the trigger, and the best way not to miss is to\nhold the muzzle underneath your chin--this way--keeping the butt well\nout from you. You make sure when you do that. The only satisfaction\nyou'll have, if it comes to suicide as a last resource, will be that\nyou've tried to do your duty and the knowledge that you'll be avenged. I\npromise that. But I don't think you'll have any need to do it--if I did\nthink it I'd have thought twice before sending you.\"\n\n\"How does such a very young man as you come to have all this\nresponsibility?\" asked Rosemary, taking the pistol without a shudder.\nShe laughed then as she noticed Cunningham's discomfort and recognized\nthe decency that hates to talk about itself.\n\n\"I suppose I know my own mind,\" he answered. \"These other awfully decent\nfellows don't, that's all--if you except Mahommed Gunga. That chap's\na wonder. 'Pon my soul, it seems he knew this was coming and picked\nme from the start to take charge over here. Seems, owing to my\ndad's reputation, these Rangars think me a sort of reincarnation of\nefficiency. I've got to try and live up to it, you know--same old game\nof reaping what you didn't sow and hoping it'll all be over before you\nwake up! Won't you try and get some sleep before morning? No? Come and\nsit over by the parapet with me, then.\"\n\nHe carried chairs for both of them to a point whence he could sit and\nwatch the track that led to Howrah and so help out the very meagre\ngarrison. There, until the waning moon dipped down below the sky-line,\nthey talked together--first about the task ahead of each of them; then\nabout the sudden ghastliness of the rebellion, whose extent not one of\nthem could really grasp as yet; last, and much longest, as familiarity\ngradually grew between them, of youthful reminiscences and home--of Eton\nand the Isle of Skye.\n\nIn the darkness and the comparative coolness that came between the\nsetting of the moon and dawn Rosemary fell asleep, her head pillowed in\nher father's lap. For a while, then, seeing her only dimly through the\nnight, but conscious, as he could not help being, of her youth and\ncharm and of the act of self-sacrifice that she had undertaken without\nremonstrance, he felt ashamed. He began to wonder whether there might\nnot have been some other way--whether he had any right, even for his\ncountry's sake, to send a girl on such a mission. Misgiving began to sap\nhis optimism, and there was no Mahommed Gunga to stir the soldier in him\nand encourage iron-willed pursuance of the game. He began to doubt; and\ndoubt bred silence.\n\nHe was wakened from a revery by Duncan McClean, who raised his daughter\ntenderly and got up on his feet.\n\n\"The dawn will be here soon, Mr. Cunningham. We had better get ready.\nWell--in case we never meet again--I'm glad I met you.\"\n\n\"Better start before the sun gets up,\" he answered, gripping the\nmissionary's hand. He was a soldier again. He had had the answer to\nhis thoughts! If the man who was to sacrifice his daughter--or risk\nher sacrifice--was pleased to have met him, there was not much sense in\nharboring self-criticism! He shook it off, and squared his shoulders,\nbeginning again to think of all that lay ahead.\n\n\"Trust to the old woman to guide you and show you a place to rest at,\nif you must rest. You ought to reach Howrah at dusk tomorrow, for you'll\nfind it quite impossible to travel fast--you're both of you too stiff,\nfor one thing. Lie up somewhere--Joanna will know of a place--until the\nold woman has taken in a message to Jaimihr, and wait until he sends\nyou some men to escort you through the outskirts of the city. I've got\ndisguises ready for you--a pugree for you, Mr. McClean, and a purdah for\nyour daughter--you'll travel as a Hindoo merchant and his wife. If you\nget stopped, say very little, but show this.\"\n\nHe produced the letter written once by Maharajah Howrah to the\nAlwa-sahib and sent by galloper with the present of a horse. It was\nsigned, and at the bottom of it was the huge red royal seal. \"Now go and\nput the disguise on, while I see to the horses; I'm going to pick out\nquiet ones, if possible, though I warn you they're rare in these parts.\"\n\nSome twenty minutes later he led their horses for them gingerly down the\nslippery rock gorge, and waited at the bottom while six men wound the\ngate up slowly. Rosemary McClean was quite unrecognizable, draped from\nhead to foot in a travelling veil that might have been Mohammedan or\nHindoo, and gave no outward sign as to her caste, or rank. McClean, in\nthe full attire of a fairly prosperous Hindoo, but with no other mark\nabout him to betoken that he might be worth robbing, rode in front of\nher, high-perched on a native saddle. In front, on a desert pony, rode\nJoanna, garbed as a man.\n\n\"She ought to be travelling in a carriage of some kind,\" admitted\nCunningham, \"but we haven't got a single wheeled thing here. If any one\nasks pertinent questions on the road, you'd better say that she had an\nekka, but that some Rangars took it from you. D'you think you know the\nlanguage well enough to pass muster?\"\n\n\"It's a little late to ask me that!\" laughed McClean. \"Yes--I'm positive\nI do. Good-by.\"\n\nThey shook hands again and the three rode off, cantering presently, to\nmake the most of the coolness before the sun got up. Cunningham climbed\nslowly up the hill and then watched them from the parapet--wondering,\nwondering again--whether he was justified. As he put it to himself, it\nwas \"the hell of a position for a man to find himself in!\" He caught\nhimself wondering whether his thoughts would have been the same, and\nwhether his conscience would have racked him quite as much, had Rosemary\nMcClean been older, and less lovely, and a little more sour-tongued.\n\nHe had to laugh presently at the absurdity of that notion, for Jaimihr\nwould never have bargained for possession of a sour-faced, elderly\nwoman. He came to the conclusion that the only thing he could do was\nto congratulate the Raj because, at the right minute, the right\ngood-looking woman had been on the spot! But he did not like the\ncircumstances any better; and before two hours had passed the loneliness\nbegan to eat into his soul.\n\nLike any other man whose race and breed and training make him\nself-dependent, he could be alone for weeks on end and scarcely be aware\nthat he had nobody to talk to. But his training had never yet included\nsending women off on dangerous missions any more than it had taught him\nto resist woman's attraction--the charm of a woman's voice, the lure\nof a woman's eyes. He did not know what was the matter with him, but\nsupposed that his liver must be out of order or else that the sun had\ntouched him.\n\nTaking a chance on the liver diagnosis, he had out the attenuated\ngarrison, and drilled it, both mounted and dismounted, first on the\nhilltop--where they made the walls re-echo to the clang of grounded\nbutts--and then on the plain below, with the gate wide open in their\nrear and one man watching from the height above. When he had tired\nthem thoroughly, and himself as well, he set two men on the lookout\nand retired to sleep; nor did the droning and the wailing music of some\nwomen in the harem trouble him.\n\nThey called him regularly when the guard was changed, but he slept the\ngreater part of that day and stood watch all night. The next day, and\nthe third day, he drilled the garrison again, growing horribly impatient\nand hourly more worried as to what Byng-bahadur might be doing, and\nthinking of him.\n\nIt was evening of the fourth day when a Rangar woke him, squeezing at\nhis foot and standing silent by the cot.\n\n\"Huzoor--Mahommed Gunga comes!\"\n\n\"Thank God!\"\n\nHe ran to the parapet and watched in the fading light a little dust\ncloud that followed no visible track but headed straight toward them\nover desert.\n\n\"How d'you know that's Mahommed Gunga?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Who else, huzoor? Who else would ride from that direction all alone and\nstraight for this nest of wasps? Who else but Alwa or Mahommed Gunga?\nAlwa said he would not come, but would wait yonder.\"\n\n\"It might be one of Alwa's men.\"\n\n\"We have many good men, sahib--and many good horses--but no man or horse\nwho could come at that pace after traversing those leagues of desert!\nThat is Mahommed Gunga, unless a new fire-eater has been found. And what\nnew man would know the way?\"\n\nSoon--staccato, like a drum-beat in the silence--came the welcome,\nthrilling cadence of the horse's hoofs--the steady thunder of a\nhorse hard-ridden but not foundered. The sun went down and blackness\nsupervened, but the sound increased, as one lone rider raced with the\nevening wind, head on.\n\nIt seemed like an hour before the lookout challenged from the crag that\noverhung the gate--before the would-be English words rang out; and all\nAsia and its jackals seemed to wait in silence for the answer.\n\n\"Howt-uh! Hukkums-thar!\"\n\n\"Ma--hommed--Gunga--hai!\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\"\n\nThe cheer broke bonds from the depth of Cunningham's being, and Mahommed\nGunga heard it on the plain below. There was a rush to man the wheels\nand sweat the gate up, and Cunningham started to run down the zigzag\npathway. He thought better of it, though, and waited where the path gave\nout onto the courtyard, giving the signal with the cords for the gate to\nlower away again.\n\n\"Evening, Mahommed Gunga!\" he said, almost casually, as the weary\ncharger's nose appeared above the rise.\n\n\"Salaam, bahadur!\"\n\nHe dismounted and saluted and then leaned against his horse.\n\n\"I wonder, sahib, whether the horse or I be weariest! Of your favor,\nwater, sahib!\"\n\nCunningham brought him water in a dipper, and the Rajput washed his\nhorse's mouth out, then held out the dipper again to Cunningham for\nfresh charge for himself.\n\n\"I would not ask the service, sahib, but for the moment my head reels. I\nmust rest before I ride again.\"\n\n\"Is all well, Mahommed Gunga?\"\n\n\"Ay, sahib! More than well!\"\n\n\"The men are ready?\"\n\n\"Horsed, armed, and waiting, they keep coming--there were many when I\nleft--there will be three squadrons worthy of the name by the time we\nget there! Is all well at your end, sahib?\"\n\n\"Yes, all's well.\"\n\n\"Did the padre people go to Howrah?\"\n\n\"They started and they have not returned.\"\n\n\"Then, Allah be praised! Inshallah, I will grip that spectacled old\nwoman of a priest by the hand before I die. He has a spark of manhood in\nhim! Send me this good horse to the stables, sahib; I am overweary. Have\nhim watered when the heat has left him, and then fed. Let them blanket\nhim lightly. And, sahib, have his legs rubbed--that horse ever loved to\nhave his legs rubbed. Allah! I must sleep four hours before I ride! And\nthe Miss-sahib--went she bravely?\"\n\n\"Went as a woman of her race ought to go, Mahommed Gunga.\"\n\n\"Ha! She met a man first of her own race, and he made her go! Would she\nhave gone if a coward asked her, think you? Sahib--women are good--at\nthe other end of things! We will ride and fetch her. Ha! I saw! My eyes\nare old, but they bear witness yet!--Now, food, sahib--for the love of\nAllah, food, before my belt-plate and my backbone touch!\"\n\n\"I wonder what the damned old infidel is dreaming of!\" swore Cunningham,\nas Mahommed Gunga staggered to the chamber in the rock where a\nserving-man was already heaping victuals for him.\n\n\"Have me called in four hours, sahib! In four hours I will be a man\nagain!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\n    The freed wolf limped home to his lair,\n    And lay to lick his sore.\n    With wrinkled lip and fangs agnash--\n    With back-laid ear and eyes aflash--\n    \"Twas something rather more than rash\n    To turn me loose!\" he swore.\n\n\nNOW Jaimihr fondly thought he held a few cards up his sleeve when he\nmade his bargain with Rosemary McClean and let himself be lowered from\nthe Alwa-sahib's rock. He knew, better probably than any one except his\nbrother and the priests, how desperate the British situation had become\nthroughout all India at an instant's notice, and he made his terms\naccordingly.\n\nHe did not believe, in the first place, that there would be any British\nleft to succor by the time matters had been settled sufficiently in\nHowrah to enable him to dare leave the city at his rear. Afterward,\nshould it seem wise, he would have no objection in the world to riding\nto the aid of a Company that no longer existed.\n\nIn the second place, he entertained no least compunction about breaking\nhis word completely in every particular. He knew that the members of the\nlittle band on Alwa's rock would keep their individual and collective\nword, and therefore that Rosemary McClean would come to him. He\nsuspected, though, that there would prove to be a rider of some sort to\nher agreement as regarded marrying him, for he had young Cunningham in\nmind; and he knew enough of Englishmen from hearsay and deduction to\nguess that Cunningham would interject any obstacle his ingenuity could\ndevise.\n\nNatives of India do not like Englishmen to marry their women. How much\nless, then, would a stiff-necked member of a race of conquerors care\nto stand by while a woman of his own race became the wife of a native\nprince? He did not trust Cunningham, and he recalled that he had had no\npromise from that gentleman.\n\nTherefore, he proposed to forestall Cunningham if possible, and, if\nthat were inconvenient or rash, he meant to take other means of making\nRosemary McClean his, beyond dispute, in any case.\n\nNext to Rosemary McClean he coveted most the throne of Howrah. With\nregard to that he was shrewd enough not to conceal from himself for a\nsecond the necessity for scotching the priests of Siva before he dare\nbroach the Howrah treasure, and so make the throne worth his royal\nwhile. Nor did he omit from his calculations the public clamor that\nwould probably be raised should he deal too roughly with the priests.\nAnd he intended to deal roughly with them.\n\nSo the proposed allegiance of the Rangars suited him in more ways than\none. His army and his brother's were so evenly matched in numbers and\nequipment that he had been able to leave Howrah without fear for the\nsafety of his palace while his back was turned. The eight hundred whom\nhe had led on the unlucky forray to Alwa's were scarcely missed, and,\neven had the Maharajah known that he was absent with them, there were\nstill too many men behind for him to dare to start reprisals. The\nMaharajah was too complete a coward to do anything much until he was\nforced into it.\n\nThe Rangars, he resolved, must be made to take the blame for the\nbroaching of the treasure. He proposed to go about the broaching even\nbefore hostilities between himself and his brother had commenced, and he\nexpected to be able to trick the Rangars into seeming to be looting. To\nappear to defend the treasure would probably not be difficult; and it\nwould be even less difficult to blame the Rangars afterward for the\ndeath of any priest who might succumb during the ensuing struggle. He\ncounted on the populace, more than on his own organized forces, to make\nthe Rangars powerless when the time should come for them to try to\ntake the upper hand. The mob would suffer in the process, but its\nfanaticism--its religious prejudice and numbers--would surely win the\nday.\n\nAs for Rosemary McClean, the more he considered her the more his brown\neyes glowed. He had promised to make her Maharanee. But he knew too\nthoroughly what that would mean not to entertain more than a passing\ndoubt as to the wisdom of the course. He was as ready to break his word\non that point as on any other.\n\nA woman of his own race, however wooed and won, would have been content\nto accept the usual status of whisperer from behind the close-meshed\nscreens. Not so an Englishwoman, with no friends to keep her company\nand with nothing in the world to do but think. She, he realized, would\nexpect to make something definite of her position, and that would suit\nneither his creed (which was altogether superficial), nor custom (which\nwas iron-bound and to be feared), nor prejudice (which was prodigious),\nnor yet convenience (which counted most).\n\nHe came to the conclusion that the fate in store for her was not such as\nshe would have selected had she had her choice. Nor were his conclusions\nin regard to her such as would commend him in the eyes of honest men.\n\nBut, after all, the throne was the fulcrum of his plotting; and the\nlever had to be the treasure, if his plans were to succeed beyond\nupsetting. He changed his plans a dozen times over before he arrived at\nlast at the audacious decision he was seeking.\n\nLike many another Hindoo in that hour of England's need, he did not lose\nsight altogether of the distant if actual possibility that the Company's\nservants might--by dint of luck and grit, and what the insurance papers\nterm the Act of God--pull through the crisis. Therefore, he decided that\nunder no circumstances should Rosemary McClean be treated cavalierly\nuntil the Rangars were out of the way and he could pose as her protector\nif need be.\n\nHe would be able to prove that Rosemary and her father had come to\nhim of their own free will. He would say that they had asked him for\nprotection from the Rangars. He had evidence that his brother Howrah had\nbeen in communication with the Rangars. So, should the Company survive\nand retain power enough to force an answer to unpleasant questions,\nhe thought it would not be difficult to prove that he had been the\nCompany's friend all along.\n\nUnder all the circumstances he considered it best to be false to\neverybody and strike for no hand but his own, and with that reconsidered\nend in view he decided on a master-stroke. He sent word to his brother,\nthe Maharajah, saying that the Rangars had accepted service with the\nCompany and purposed a raid on Howrah; therefore, he proposed that they\nunite against the common enemy and set a trap for the Rangars.\n\nHowrah sent back to ask what proof he had of the Rangars' taking service\nwith the British. Jaimihr answered that Cunningham and Mahommed Gunga\nwere both on Alwa's crag. He also swore that as Alwa's prisoner he had\nbeen able to over-hear the Rangars' plans.\n\nThe Maharajah was bewildered, as Jaimihr had expected that he would\nbe. And with just as Eastern, just as muddle-headed, just as dishonest\nreasoning, he made up his mind to play a double game with everybody,\ntoo. He agreed to join Jaimihr in opposition to the Rangars. He agreed\nto send all his forces to meet Jaimihr's and together kill every Rangar\nwho should show himself inside the city. And he privately made plans to\narrive on the scene too late, and smash Jaimihr's army after it had been\nreduced in size and efficiency by its battle with Alwa's men.\n\nJaimihr, unknowingly, fitted his plan into his brother's by determining\nto get on the scene early enough to have first crack at the treasure. He\nmeant to get away with that, leave his brother to deal with Alwa's men,\ncircle round, and then attack his brother from the rear.\n\nFinally, he made up his mind once and for all that Rosemary McClean must\nremain inviolate until he was quite certain that the English had been\ndriven out of India. He expected that good news within a week.\n\nHe was delighted when Joanna, dressed as a man, turned up at his\npalace-gates and cajoled her way in past the guards. To be asked for\nan escort to bring the McCleans into Howrah fitted in with his role\nof protector as a key might fit a lock. Now they could never\npretend--nobody could ever pretend--that he had seized them. He sent a\ncarriage out for them, and when they arrived placed a whole wing of his\npalace at their disposal, treating them like royalty. He made no attempt\nto molest or interfere with either of them, except that he prevented\nthem from going in and out; and he told off plenty of witnesses who\nwould be able to swear subsequently that they had seen how well his\nguests were treated. He was taking no unnecessary chances at that stage\nof the game he played.\n\nThere were others, though, who plotted besides Jaimihr. There were, for\ninstance, Siva's priests. It is not to be forgotten that in that part\nof India the priests had been foremost in fomenting the rebellion. They\nurged Howrah constantly to take the field against the British, and it\nwas only the sure knowledge of his brother's intention to strike for the\nthrone that prevented the Maharajah from doing what the priests urged.\n\nHe knew that Alwa and the Rangars would not help him unless Jaimihr\nfirst attacked him, for Alwa would be sure to stand on the strict letter\nof his oath. And he was afraid of the Rangars. He feared that they might\nprotect him and depose him afterward. He reasoned that that, too,\nmight be construed into a strict interpretation of the terms of Alwa's\npromise!\n\nHe consented to collect his army. He kept it under arms. He even paid it\nsomething on account of arrears of wages and served out rations. But,\nto the disgust of the priests who asked nothing better than dissension\nbetween the brothers, he jumped at the idea of uniting with Jaimihr to\ndefeat Alwa's men. He knew--just as the priests feared--that once he\ncould trick and defeat Jaimihr he could treat the troublesome priests as\ncavalierly as he chose.\n\nSo the priests made a third knot in the tangle and tried desperately at\nthe last moment to recreate dissension between the rival royal camps.\n\n\"Jaimihr is getting ready to attack you!\" they assured Howrah. \"Attack\nhim first!\"\n\n\"I will wait until he does attack,\" the Maharajah answered. \"For the\nmoment we are friends and have a cause in common.\"\n\n\"Howrah's men will desert to you the moment you make a move to win the\nthrone,\" they assured Jaimihr.\n\n\"Wait!\" answered Jaimihr. \"Wait but a day or two. I will move fast as I\nsee fit when I am ready. For the present my cause and my brother's cause\nare one.\"\n\nSpies brought in news to Maharajah, Prince, and priest of the hurried\nraising of a Rangar army. The Maharajah and the Prince laughed up their\nsleeves and the priests swore horribly; the interjection of another\nelement--another creed--into the complication did not suit the priestly\n\"book.\" They were the only men who were really worried about Alwa.\n\nAnd another spy--Joanna--disappeared. No longer garbed as a man, she had\nhung about the palace, and--known to nearly all the sweepers--she had\noverheard things. Garbed as a man again, she suddenly evaporated in thin\nair, and Rosemary McClean was left without a servant or any means of\ncommunication with the outside world.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\n    The ringed wolf glared the circle round\n    Through baleful, blue-lit eye,\n    Not unforgetful of his debt.\n    \"Now, heed ye how ye draw the net.\"\n    Quoth he:  \"I'll do some damage yet\n    Or ere my turn to die!\"\n\n\nTHE mare that had been a present from Mahommed Gunga was brought out and\nsaddled, together with a fresh horse for the Risaldar. The veteran had\nneeded no summoning, for with a soldier's instinct he had wakened at\nthe moment his self-allotted four hours had expired. He mounted a little\nstiffly, and tried his horse's paces up and down the courtyard once or\ntwice before nodding to Cunningham.\n\n\"All ready, sahib.\"\n\n\"Ready, Mahommed Gunga.\"\n\nBut there was one other matter, after all, that needed attention first.\n\n\"That horse of mine that brought me hither\"--the Risaldar picked out\nthe man who waited with the gong cord in his hand--\"is left in thy\nparticular charge. Dost thou hear me? I will tell the Alwa-sahib what I\nnow tell thee--that horse will be required of thee fit, good-tempered,\nlight-mouthed, not spur-marked, and thoroughly well groomed. There will\nbe a reward in the one case, but in the other--I would not stand in thy\nshoes! It is a trust!\"\n\n\"Come along, Risaldar!\" called Cunningham. \"We're wasting an awful lot\nof time!\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib, but a good horse is like a woman, to be loved and treated\nfaithfully! Neither horse nor woman should be sacrificed for less than\nduty! Lead on, bahadur--I will join thee at the gate.\"\n\nHe had several directions to give for the horse's better care, and\nCunningham was forced to wait at least five minutes for him at the foot\nof the steep descent. Then for another minute the two sat their horses\nside by side, while the great gate rose slowly, grudgingly, cranked\nupward by four men.\n\n\"If we two ever ride under here again, bahadur, we shall ride with honor\nthick on us,\" remarked Mahommed Gunga. \"God knows what thy plan may\nbe; but I know that from now on there will be no peace for either of\nus until we have helped rip it with our blades from the very belly of\nrebellion. Ride!\"\n\nThe gate clanged down behind them as--untouched by heel or\nspur--the two spring-limbed chargers raced for their bits\nacross the sand. They went like shadows, casting other\nshadows--moon-made--wind-driven--knee-to-knee.\n\n\"Now, sahib!\"\n\nThe Risaldar broke silence after fifteen minutes. Neither he nor\nCunningham were of the type that chatters when the time has come to\nloosen sabres and sit tight.\n\n\"In the matter of what lies ahead--as I said, neither I nor any man\nknows what this plan of thine may be, but I and the others have accepted\nthy bare word. These men who await thee--and they are many, and all\nsoldiers, good, seasoned horsemen--have been told that the son of\nCunnigan will lead them. Alwa has given his word, and I mine, that in\nthe matter of a leader there is nothing left to be desired. And my five\nmen have told them of certain happenings that they have seen. Therefore,\nthou art awaited with no little keenness. They will be all eyes and\nears. It might be well, then, to set the pace a little slower, for a man\nlooks better on a fresh horse than on a weary one!\"\n\n\"I'm thinking, Mahommed Gunga, of the two McCleans and of General Byng,\nwho is expecting us. There is little time to lose.\"\n\n\"I, too, consider them, sahib. It is we Rangars who must do the sabre\nwork. ALL, sahib--ALL--depends now on the impression created on the men\nawaiting thee! Rein in a little. Thy father's name, thine own, and mine\nand Alwa's weigh for much on thy side; but have a sound horse between\nthy legs and a trumpet in thy throat when we get there! I have seen more\nthan one officer have to fight up-hill for the hearts of his troopers\nbecause his tired horse stumbled or looked shabby on the first parade.\nDraw rein a little, sahib.\"\n\nSo Cunningham, still saying nothing, drew back into an easy canter. He\nwas conscious of something, not at all like a trumpet, in his throat\nthat was nearly choking him. He did not care to let Mahommed Gunga know\nthat what was being mistaken for masterly silence was really emotion! He\ndid not speak because he did not trust his voice.\n\n\"There are three squadrons, sahib--each of about five hundred men. Alwa\nhas the right wing, I the left. Take thou the centre and command the\nwhole. The horses are as good as any in this part of India, for each\nman has brought his best to do thee honor. Each man carries four days'\nrations in his saddle-bag and two days' rations for his horse. More\nhorse feed is collecting, and they are bringing wagons, to follow when\nwe give the word. But we thought there would be little sense in ordering\nwagons to follow us to Howrah City, knowing that thy plan would surely\nentail action. If we are to ride to the aid of Byng-bahadur it seemed\nbetter to pick up the wagons on the journey back again. That is all,\nsahib. There will be no time, of course, to waste on talk or drill. Take\ncharge the moment that we get there--issue thy orders--and trust to the\nmen understanding each command. Lead off without delay.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Cunningham--two English words that went much further\nto allay the Risaldar's anxiety than any amount of rhetoric would have\ndone. \"But--d'you mean to tell me that the men don't understand words of\ncommand?\"\n\n\"All of them do, sahib--but to many of them the English words are new.\nThey all understand formations, and those who know the English words are\nteaching the others while they wait for us. There is not one man among\nthem but has couched a lance or swung a sabre in some force or other?\"\n\n\"Good. Have they all got lances?\"\n\n\"All the front-rank men are armed with lance and sabre--the rear ranks\nhave sabres only.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nAfter two hours of steady cantering the going changed and became a quick\nsuccession of ever-deepening gorges cleft in sandstone. Far away in the\ndistance to the left there rose a glow that showed where Howrah City\nkept uneasy vigil, doubtless with watch-fires at every street corner. It\nlooked almost as though the distant city were in flames.\n\nAhead of them lay the gloom of hell mouth and the silence of the space\nbeyond the stars.\n\nIt was with that strange, unclassified, unnamed sixth sense that\nsoldiers, savages, and certain hunters have that Cunningham became aware\nof life ahead of him--massed, strong-breathing, ready--waiting life,\nspring-bent in the quivering blackness. A little farther, and he caught\nthe ring of a curb-chain. Then a horse whinnied and a hoarse voice swore\nlow at a restive charger. His own mare neighed, throwing her head high,\nand some one challenged through the dead-black night.\n\n\"How-ut! Hukkums--thar!\"\n\nA horseman appeared suddenly from nowhere, and examined them at close\nquarters instead of waiting for their answer. He peered curiously at\nCunningham--glanced at Mahommed Gunga--then wheeled, spinning his horse\nas the dust eddies twist in the sudden hot-wind gusts.\n\n\"Sahib-bahadur hai!\" he shouted, racing back.\n\nThe night was instantly alive with jingling movement, as line after\nline of quite invisible light-horse-men--self-disciplined and eager to\nobey--took up their dressing. The overhanging cliff of sandstone hid the\nmoon, but here and there there was a gleam of eyeballs in the dark--now\nman's, now horse's--and a sheen that was the hint of steel held\nvertical. No human being could have guessed the length of the gorge\nnor the number of the men who waited in it, for the restless chargers\nstamped in inch-deep sand that deadened sound without seeming to lessen\nits quantity.\n\n\"Salaam, bahadur!\"\n\nIt was Alwa, saluting with drawn sabre, reining back a pedigreed mare to\nget all the spectacular emotion out of the encounter that he could.\n\n\"Here are fifteen hundred eight and fifty, sahib--all Rangars--true\nbelievers--all true men--all pledged to see thee unsinged through the\nflames of hell! Do them the honor of a quick inspection, sahib!\"\n\n\"Certainly!\" smiled Cunningham.\n\n\"I have told them, sahib, that their homes, their women, their\npossessions, and their honor are all guaranteed them. Also pay. They\nmake no other terms.\"\n\n\"I guarantee them all of that,\" said Cunningham, loud enough for at\nleast the nearest ranks to hear.\n\n\"On thine own honor, sahib?\"\n\n\"On my word of honor!\"\n\n\"The promise is enough! Will you inspect them, sahib?\"\n\n\"I'll take their salute first,\" said Cunningham.\n\n\"Pardon, bahadur!\"\n\nAlwa filled his lungs and faced the unseen lines.\n\n\"Rangars!\" he roared. \"Your leader! To Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur--son of\nPukka-Cunnigan whom we all knew--general--salute--present--sabres!\"\n\nThere was sudden movement--the ring of whipped-out metal--a bird's\nwing-beat--as fifteen hundred hilts rose all together to as many\nlips--and a sharp intake of breath all down the line.\n\nIt wasn't bad. Not bad at all, thought Cunningham. It was not done\nas regulars would have worked it. There was the little matter of the\nlances, that he could make out dimly here and there, and he could detect\neven in that gloom that half of the men had been caught wondering how\nto salute with lance and sabre both. But that was not their fault;\nthe effort--the respect behind the effort--the desire to act\naltogether--were all there and striving. He drew his own mare back a\nlittle, and returned their salute with full military dignity.\n\n\"Reeeecee--turn--sabres!\" ordered Alwa, and that movement was\naccomplished better.\n\nHe rode once, slowly, down the long front rank, letting each man look\nhim over--then back again along the rear rank, risking a kick or two,\nfor there was little room between them and the cliff. He was not choking\nnow. The soldier instinct, that is born in a man like statesmanship\nor poetry, but that never can be taught, had full command over all his\nother senses, and when he spurred out to the front again his voice rang\nloud and clear, like a trumpet through the night.\n\nWith fifty ground scouts scattered out ahead of them, they drummed out\nof the gorge and thundered by squadrons on the plain beyond--straight,\nas the jackal runs, for Howrah City. Alwa, leaving his own squadron,\nto canter at Cunningham's side, gave him all the new intelligence that\nmattered.\n\n\"Last evening I sent word on ahead to them of our coming, sahib! I sent\none messenger to the Maharajah and one to Jaimihr, warning each that we\nride to keep our plighted word. At the worst, we shall find both parties\nready for us! We shall know before we reach the city who is our friend!\nNews reached me, too, sahib, that the Maharajah and his brother have\nunited against us--that Howrah will eat his promises and play me\nfalse. God send he does! I would like to have my hands in that Hindoo's\ntreasure-chests! We none of us know yet, bahadur, what is this plan of\nthine--\"\n\n\"You've been guessing awfully close to it, I think\" laughed Cunningham.\n\n\"Aha! The treasure-chests, then! But--is there--have you information,\nsahib? Who knows, then--who has told where they are? Neither I nor my\nmen know!\"\n\n\"Send for Mahommed Gunga.\"\n\nMahommed Gunga left his squadron, too, to canter beside Alwa.\n\n\"I am all ears, sahib!\" he asserted, reining his horse until his stride\nwas equal to the others.\n\n\"The key to the situation is that treasure,\" asserted Cunningham.\n\"Howrah wants it. Jaimihr wants it. The priests want it. I know that\nmuch for certain, from the McCleans. All right. We're a new factor in\nthe problem, and they all mistrust us nearly as much, if not more, than\nthey mistrust one another. Good. They'll be all of them watching that\ntreasure. It'll be near where they are, and I'm going to snaffle it or\nbreak my neck--and all your necks--in the deuced desperate attempt. Is\nthat clear? Where the carcass is, there wheel the kites and there the\njackals fight, as your proverb says. The easiest part will be finding\nthe treasure. Then--\"\n\nThey legged in closer to him, hanging on his words and too busy\nlistening to speak.\n\n\"If Howrah thinks we're after the treasure and decides to fight without\nprevious argument, that absolves you from your promise, doesn't it,\nAlwa-sahib?\"\n\n\"Surely, sahib, provided our intention is not to evade the promise.\"\n\n\"Our intention is to prevent Howrah and his brother from fighting, to\ninsure peace and protection on this whole countryside, and, if possible,\nto ride away with Jaimihr's army to the Company's aid.\"\n\n\"Good, sahib.\"\n\nIt seemed to occur to none of the three that fifteen hundred mounted men\nwere somewhat few with which to accomplish such a marvel.\n\n\"If they are fighting already, we must interfere.\"\n\n\"We are ready, bahadur. Fighting is our trade!\"\n\n\"But, before all things, we must keep our eyes well skinned for a\nhint of treachery on Jaimihr's part. I would rather quarrel with that\ngentleman than be his friend, but he happens to hold our promise.\nWe've got to keep our promise, provided he keeps his. I think our first\nobjective is the treasure.\"\n\n\"That, sahib, is an acrobat of a plan,\" said Alwa; \"much jumping from\none proposition to another!\"\n\n\"It is no plan at all,\" said Cunningham. \"It is a mere rehearsal of the\ncircumstances. A plan is something quickly seized at the right\nsecond and then acted on--like your capture of Jaimihr. Wait awhile,\nAlwa-sahib!\"\n\n\"Ay, wait awhile!\" growled Mahommed Gunga. \"Did I bring thee a leader to\nask plans of thee, or a man of men for thee to follow? Which?\"\n\n\"All the same,\" said Alwa, \"I would rather halt and make a good plan. It\nwould be wiser. I do not understand this one.\"\n\n\"I follow Cunnigan-bahadur!\" said Mahommed Gunga; and he spurred off\nto his squadron. Alwa could see nothing better than to follow suit, for\nCunningham closed his lips tight in a manner unmistakable. And whatever\nAlwa's misgivings might have been, he had the sense and the soldierly\ndetermination not to hint at them to his men.\n\nAs dawn rose pale-yellow in the eastern sky they thundered into view\nof Howrah City and drew rein to breathe their horses. The sun was high\nbefore they had trotted near enough to make out details. But, long\nbefore details could be seen, it was evident that an army was formed\nup to meet them on the tree-lined maidan that lay between them and the\ntwo-mile-long palace-wall. Beyond all doubt it was Jaimihr's army, for\nhis elephants were not so gaudily harnessed as Howrah's, and his men\nwere not so brilliantly dressed.\n\nAs they dipped into the last depression between them and the wall and\nhalted for a minute's consultation, a khaki-clad, shrivelled figure of\na man leaped up from behind a sand-ridge, and raced toward Cunningham,\nshouting to him in a dialect he had no knowledge of and gesticulating\nwildly. A trooper spurred down on him, brought him up all standing with\nan intercepted lance, examined him through puckered eyes, and then,\nroaring with laughter, picked him up and carried him to Cunningham.\n\n\"A woman, sahib! By the beard of Abraham, a woman!\"\n\n\"Joanna!\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib! Ha, sahib!\"\n\nShe babbled to him, word overtaking word and choking all together in\na dust-dry throat. Cunningham gave her water and then set her on the\nground.\n\n\"Translate, somebody!\" he ordered. \"I can't understand a word she says.\"\n\nBabbled and hurried and a little vague it might be, but Joanna had the\nnews of the minute pat.\n\n\"Jaimihr is looting the treasure now, sahib. He has tricked his brother.\nThey were to join, and both fight against you, but Jaimihr tried to get\nthe treasure out before either you or his brother came. He is trying\nnow, sahib!\"\n\n\"Miss McClean! Ask her where Miss McClean is! Ask for Miss Maklin,\nsahib!\"\n\n\"Jaimihr has told her that thou and Alwa and Mahommed Gunga are all\ndead, and the British overwhelmed throughout all India! He has her with\nhim in a carriage, under guard, for all his men are with him and he\ncould spare no great guard for his palace. See! Look, sahib! Jaimihr's\npalace is in flames!\"\n\nAlwa all but fell from his charger, laughing volcanically. The Rajput,\nwho never can agree, can always see the humor in other Rajputs'\ndisagreement.\n\n\"Ho, but they are playing a great game with each other!\" he shouted. But\nCunningham decided he had wasted time enough. He shouted his orders, and\nin less than thirty seconds his three squadrons were thundering in the\ndirection of Jaimihr's army and the palace-wall. They drew rein again\nwithin a quarter of a mile of it, to discover with amazed military eyes\nthat Jaimihr had no artillery.\n\nIt was then, at the moment when they halted, that Jaimihr reached a\nquick decision and the wrong one. He knew by now that his brother had\nwon the first trick in the game of treachery, for he could see the smoke\nand flames of his burning palace from where he sat his horse. He\ndecided at once that Alwa and his Rangars must have taken sides with the\nMaharajah, for how, otherwise, he reasoned, could the Maharajah dare\nlet the Rangars approach unwatched and unmolested. It was evident to him\nthat the Rangars were acting as part of a concerted movement.\n\nHe made up his mind to attack and beat off the new arrivals without\nfurther ceremony. He out-numbered them by four or five to one, and was\non his own ground. Whatever their intentions, at least he would be\nable to pretend afterward that he had acted in defence of the sacred\ntreasure; and then, with the treasure in his possession, he would soon\nbe able to recompense himself for a mere burned and looted palace!\n\nSo he opened fire without notice, argument, or parley, and an ill-aimed\nvolley shrieked over the heads of Cunningham's three squadrons.\n\nCunningham, unruffled and undecided still, made out through puckered\neyes the six-horse carriage in which Miss McClean evidently was; it was\ndrawn up close beside the wall, and two regiments were between it and\nhis squadron. He was recalling the terms of the agreement made with\nJaimihr; he remembered it included the sparing of all of Alwa's men, and\nnot the firing on them.\n\nA thousand of Jaimihr's cavalry swooped from the shelter of the\ninfantry, opened out a very little, and, mistaking Cunningham's delay\nfor fear, bore down with a cheer and something very like determination.\n\nThey were met some ten yards their side of the half-way mark by\nCunningham's three squadrons, loosed and led by Cunningham himself.\nOutridden, outfought, outgeneralled, they were smashed through, ridden\ndown, and whirled back reeling in confusion. About a hundred of them\nreached the shelter of the infantry in a formed-up body; many of the\nrest charged through it in a mob and threw it into confusion.\n\nToo late Jaimihr decided on more reasonable tactics. Too late he gave\norders to his infantry that no such confused body could obey. Before\nhe could ride to rally them, the Rangars were in them, at them, through\nthem, over them. The whole was disintegrating in retreat, endeavoring to\nrally and reform in different places, each subdivision shouting orders\nto its nearest neighbor and losing heart as its appeals for help were\ndisregarded.\n\nBack came Cunningham's close-formed squadrons, straight through the\nwrithing mass again; and now the whole of Jaimihr's army took to its\nheels, just as part of the five-feet-thick stone palace-wall succumbed\nto the attacks of crowbars and crashed down in the roadway, disclosing a\ndark vault on the other side.\n\nJaimihr made a rush for the six-horse carriage, and tried vainly to\nget it started. Cunningham shouted to him to surrender, but he took no\nnotice of the challenge; he escaped being made prisoner by the narrowest\nof margins, as the position next him was cut down. The other postilions\nwere un-horsed, and six Rangars changed mounts and seized the reins. The\nPrince ran one man through the middle, and then spurred off to try and\novertake his routed army, some of which showed a disposition to form up\nagain.\n\n\"Sit quiet!\" called Cunningham through the latticed carriage window.\n\"You're safe!\"\n\nThe heavy, swaying carriage rumbled round, and the horses plunged in\nanswer to the Rangars' heels. A moment later it was moving at a gallop;\ntwo minutes later it was backed against the wall, and Rosemary McClean\nstepped out behind three protecting squadrons that had not suffered\nperceptibly from what they would have scorned to call a battle.\n\n\"Now all together!\" shouted Cunningham, whose theories on the value\nof seconds when tackling reforming infantry were worthy of the Duke of\nWellington, or any other officer who knew his business; and again he led\nhis men at a breakneck charge. This time Jaimihr's disheartened little\narmy did not wait for him, but broke into wild confusion and scattered\nright and left, leaving their elephants to be captured. There were only\na few men killed. The lance-tipped, roaring whirlwind loosed itself\nfor the most part against nothing, and reformed uninjured to trot back\nagain. Cunningham told off two troops to pursue fugitives and keep their\neyes open for the Prince before he rode back to examine the breach in\nthe wall that Jaimihr had been to so much trouble about making.\n\nHe had halted to peer through the break in the age-old masonry when\nMahommed Gunga spurred up close to him, touched his arm, and pointed.\n\n\"Look, sahib! Look!\"\n\nJaimihr--and no one but a wizard could have told how he had managed to\nget to where he was unobserved--was riding as a man rides at a tent-peg,\ncrouching low, full-pelt for Rosemary McClean!\n\nCunningham's spurs went home before the word was out of Mahommed Gunga's\nmouth, and Mahommed Gunga raced behind him; but Jaimihr had the start\nof them. Duncan McClean, looking ill and weak and helpless, crowded his\ndaughter to the wall, standing between her and the Prince; but Jaimihr\naimed a swinging sabre at him, and the missionary fell. His daughter\nstooped to bend over him, and Jaimihr seized her below the arms. A\nsecond later he had hoisted her to his saddle-bow and was spurring\nhell-bent-for-leather for the open country.\n\nTwo things prevented him from making his escape. Five of Alwa's men,\nreturning from pursuing fugitives, cut off his flight in one direction,\nand the extra weight on his horse prevented him from getting clear by\nmeans of speed alone--as he might have done otherwise, for Cunningham's\nmare was growing tired.\n\nJaimihr rode for two minutes with the frenzy of a savage before he saw\nthe futility of it. It was Cunningham's mare, gaining on him stride\nover stride, that warned him he would be cut down like a dog from behind\nunless he surrendered or let go his prize.\n\nSo he laughed and threw the girl to the ground. For a moment more he\nspurted, spurring like a fiend, then wheeled and charged at Cunningham.\nHe guessed that but for Cunningham that number of Rangars would never\nhave agreed on a given plan. He knew that it was he, and not Cunningham\nor Alwa or Rosemary McClean, who had broken faith. He had broken it in\nthought, and word, and action. And he had lost his prospect of a throne.\nSo he came on like a man who has nothing to gain by considering his\nsafety. He came like a real man at last. And Cunningham, on a tired\nmare, met him point to point.\n\nThey fought over a quarter of a mile of ground, for Jaimihr proved to\nbe as useful with his weapon as Mahommed Gunga's teaching had made\nCunningham. There was plenty of time for the reformed squadrons to see\nwhat was happening--plenty of time for Alwa, who considered that he had\nan account of his own to settle with the Prince, to leave his squadron\nand come thundering up to help. Mahommed Gunga dodged and reined and\nspurred, watching his opportunity on one side and Alwa on the other. It\nwould have suited neither of them to have their leader killed at that\nstage of the game, but the fighting was too quick for either man to\ninterfere.\n\nJaimihr charged Cunningham for the dozenth time and missed, charged\npast, to wheel and charge again, then closed with the most vindictive\nrush of all. Again Cunningham met him point to point. The two blades\nlocked, and bent like springs as they wrenched at them. Cunningham's\nblade snapped. He snatched at his mare and spun her before Jaimihr could\nrecover, then rammed both spurs in and bore down on the Prince with half\na sabre. He had him on the near side at a disadvantage. Jaimihr spurred\nand tried to maneuver for position, and the half sabre went home just\nbelow his ribs. He dropped bleeding in the dust at the second that Alwa\nand Mahommed Gunga each saw an opportunity and rushed in, to rein back\nface to face, grinning in each other's faces, their horses' breasts\npressed tight against the charger that Jaimihr rode. The horse screamed\nas the shock crushed the wind out of him.\n\n\"You robbed me of my man, sahib, by about a sabre's breadth!\" laughed\nAlwa.\n\n\"And you left your squadron leaderless without my permission!\" answered\nCunningham. \"You too! Mahommed Gunga!\"\n\n\"But, sahib!\"\n\n\"Do you prefer to argue or obey?\"\n\nMahommed Gunga flushed and rode back. Alwa grinned and started after\nhim. Cunningham, without another glance at the dead Prince, rode up to\nRosemary McClean, who was picking herself up and looking bewildered;\nshe had watched the duel in speechless silence, lying full length in the\ndust, and she still could not speak when he reached her.\n\n\"Put your foot on mine,\" he said reassuringly; \"then swing yourself up\nbehind me if you can. If you can't, I'll pick you up in front.\"\n\nShe tried hard, but she failed; so he put both arms under hers and\nlifted her.\n\n\"Am I welcome?\" he asked. And she nodded.\n\nFresh from killing a man--with a man's blood on his broken sword and the\nsweat of fighting not yet dry on him--he held a woman in his arms for\nthe first time in his life. His hand had been steady when it struck the\nblow under Jaimihr's ribs, but now it trembled. His eyes had been stern\nand blazing less than two minutes before; now they looked down into\nnothing more dangerous than a woman's eyes and grew strangely softer\nall at once. His mouth had been a hard, tight line under a scrubby upper\nlip, but his lips had parted now a little and his smile was a boy's--not\nnervous or mischievous--a happy boy's.\n\nShe smiled, too. Most people did smile when young Cunningham looked\npleased with them; but she smiled differently. And he, with that blood\nstill wet on him, bent down and kissed her on the lips. Her answer was\nas characteristic as his action.\n\n\"You look like a blackguard,\" she said--\"but you came, and I knew you\nwould! I told Jaimihr you would, and he laughed at me. I told God you\nwould, and you came! How long is it since you shaved? Your chin is all\nprickly!\"\n\nThey were interrupted by a roar from the three waiting squadrons. He had\nridden without caring where he went, and his mare had borne the two of\nthem to where the squadrons were drawn up with their rear to the great\ngap in the wall. The situation suited every Rangar of them! That was,\nindeed, the way a man should win his woman! They cheered him, and\ncheered again, and he grinned back, knowing that their hearts were in\nthe cheering and their good will won. Red, then, as a boiled beet, he\nrode over to the six-horse carriage and dismounted by her father--picked\nhim up--called two troopers--and lifted him on to the rear seat of the\ngreat old-fashioned coach.\n\n\"Get inside beside him!\" he ordered Rosemary, examining the missionary's\nhead as he spoke. \"It's a scalp wound, and he's stunned--no more. He's\nleft off bleeding already. Nurse him!\" He was off, then, without another\nword or a backward glance for her--off to his men and the gap in the\nwall that waited an investigation.\n\nThe amazing was discovered then. The treasure--the fabled, fabulous,\nenormous Howrah treasure was no fable. It was there, behind that wall!\nThe jewels and the bullion in marketable bars that could have bought\nan army or a kingdom--the sacred, secret treasure of twenty troubled\ngenerations, that was guarded in the front by fifty doors and fifty\ncorridors and three times fifty locks--the door of whose secret vault\nwas guarded by a cannon, set to explode at the slightest touch--was\nhidden from the public road at its other side, its rear, by nothing\nbetter than a five-foot wall of ill-cemented stone! Cunningham stepped\ninside over the dismantled masonry and sat down on a chest that held\nmore money's worth than all the Cunninghams in all the world had ever\nowned, or spent, or owed, or used, or dreamed of!\n\n\"Ask Alwa and Mahommed Gunga to come to me here!\" he called; and a\nminute later they stood at attention in front of him.\n\n\"Send a hundred men, each with a flag of truce on his lance, to gallop\nthrough the city and call on Jaimihr's men to rally to me, if they wish\nprotection against Howrah!\"\n\n\"Good, sahib! Good!\" swore Alwa. \"Howrah is the next danger! Make ready\nto fight Howrah!\"\n\n\"Attend to my orders, please!\" smiled Cunningham, and Alwa did as he was\ntold. Within an hour Jaimihr's men were streaming from the four quarters\nof the compass, hurrying to be on the winning side, and forming into\ncompanies as they were ordered.\n\nThen Cunningham gave another order.\n\n\"Alwa-sahib, will you take another flag of truce, please, and ride with\nnot more than two men to Maharajah Howrah. Tell him that I want him here\nat once to settle about this treasure.\"\n\nAlwa stared. His mouth opened a little, and he stood like a man bereft\nof reason by the unexpected.\n\n\"Are you not still pledged to support Howrah on his throne?\"\n\n\"I am, bahadur.\"\n\n\"Would plundering his treasure be in keeping with your promise to him?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib. But--\"\n\n\"Be good enough to take my message to him. Assure him that he may come\nwith ten men without fear of molestation, but guarantee to him that if\nhe comes with more than ten--and with however many more--I will fight,\nand keep his treasure, both!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\n    Friends I have sought me of varying nations,\n    Men of all ranks and of different stations;\n            Some are in jail now, and some are deceased.\n    Two, though, I found to be experts at sundering\n    Me from my revenue, leaving me wondering\n    Which was the costlier--soldier or priest.\n\n\nA LITTLE more than one hour later, Howrah--sulky and disgruntled, but\ndoing his level best to appear at Ease--faced young Cunningham across\na table in the treasure-vault. Outside was a row of wagons, drawn\nby horses and closely guarded by a squadron of the Rangars. Behind\nCunningham stood Alwa and Mahommed Gunga; behind the Maharajah were\ntwo of his court officials. There were pen and ink and the royal seal\nbetween them on the table.\n\n\"So, Maharajah-sahib. They are all scaled, and each chest is marked on\nthe outside with its contents; I'm sorry there was no time to weigh the\ngold, but the number of the ingots ought to be enough. And, of\ncourse, you'll understand it wasn't possible to count all those unset\nstones--that 'ud take a week; but your seal is on that big chest, too,\nso you'll know if it's been opened. You are certain you can preserve the\npeace of your state with the army you have?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Howrah curtly.\n\n\"Don't want me to leave a squadron of my men to help you out?\"\n\n\"No!\" He said that even more abruptly.\n\n\"Good. Of course, since you won't have to spare men to guard the\ntreasure now, you'll have all the more to keep peace in the district\nwith, won't you? Let me repeat the terms of our bargain--they're written\nhere, but let's be sure there is no mistake. I agree to deliver your\ntreasure into safe keeping until the rebellion is over, and to report to\nmy government that you are friendly disposed toward us. You, in return,\nguarantee to protect the families and property of all these gentlemen\nwho ride with me. It is mutually agreed that any damage done to their\nhomes during their absence shall be made good out of your treasure, but\nthat should you keep your part of the agreement the treasure shall be\nhanded back to you intact. Is that correct?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Howrah shifting in his seat uneasily.\n\n\"Is there anything else?\"\n\n\"One other thing. I am outmaneuvered, and I have surrendered with the\nbest grace possible. That agreement stands in my name, and no other\nman's?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"The priests of Siva are not parties to it?\"\n\n\"I've had nothing whatever to do with them,\" said Cunningham.\n\n\"That is all, then, sahib. I am satisfied.\"\n\n\"While we're about it, Maharajah-sahib, let's scotch those priests\naltogether! McClean-sahib has told me that suttee has been practised\nhere as a regular thing. That's got to stop, and we may as well stop it\nnow. Of course, I shall keep my word about the treasure, and you'll get\nit back if you live up to the bargain you have made; but my government\nwill know now where it is, and they'll be likely to impose a quite\nconsiderable fine on you when the rebellion's over unless this suttee's\nput an end to. Besides, you couldn't think of a better way of scoring\noff the priests than by enforcing the law and abolishing the practice.\nThink that over, Maharajah-sahib.\"\n\nHowrah swore into his beard, as any ruling potentate might well do at\nbeing dictated to by a boy of twenty-two.\n\n\"I will do my best, sahib,\" he answered. \"I am with the British--not\nagainst them.\"\n\n\"Good for you!--er, I mean, that's right!\" He turned to Alwa, and looked\nstraight into his eyes. \"Are you satisfied with the guarantee?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Sahib, I am more than satisfied!\"\n\n\"Good! Oh, and--Maharajah-sahib--since we've fought your battle for\nyou--and lost a few men--and are going to guard your treasure for you,\nand be your friends, and all that kind of thing--don't you think you'd\nlike to do something for us--not much, but just a little thing?\"\n\n\"I am in your power. You have but to command.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I don't want to force anything. We're friends--talking as\nfriends. I ask a favor.\"\n\n\"It is granted, sahib.\"\n\n\"A horse or two, that's all.\"\n\n\"How many horses, sahib?\"\n\n\"Oh, not more than one each.\"\n\nThe Maharajah pulled a wry face, but bowed assent. It would empty\nhis stables very nearly, but he knew when he could not help himself.\nMahommed Gunga clapped a hand to his mouth and left the vault hurriedly.\n\n\"You understand this is not a demand, Maharajah-sahib. I take it that\nyou offer me these horses as an act of royal courtesy and as additional\nproof of friendliness?\"\n\n\"Surely, sahib.\"\n\n\"My men will be very grateful to you. This will enable them to reach\nthe scene of action with their own horses in good shape. I'm sure it's\nawfully good of you to have offered them!\"\n\nOutside, where the late afternoon sun was gradually letting things cool\ndown, Mahommed Gunga leaned against the wall and roared with laughter,\nas he explained a few details to the admiring troopers.\n\n\"A horse or two, says he! How many? Oh, just a horse or two,\nMaharajah-sahib--merely a horse apiece! Fifteen hundred horses! A horse\nor two! Oh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ho! Allah! But that boy will make a better\nsoldier than his father! As a favor, he asked them--no compulsion,\nmind you--just as a favor! Allah! What is he asking now, I wonder!\nHa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ho-ho-ho!\"\n\nAnd inside, with a perfectly straight face and almost ghastly\ngenerosity, young Cunningham proceeded to impose on Howrah the\ntransferred, unwelcome, perilous allegiance of Jaimihr's reassembling\narmy. The mere keeping of it in subjection, it was realized by donor and\nrecipient alike, would keep the Maharajah's hands full.\n\n\"Are you satisfied that your homes will be safe, now?\" he asked Alwa.\nAnd Alwa looked him in the eyes and grinned.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\n    Now, fifteen hundred, horse and man,\n    Reel at the word of one!\n    Loosed by the brazen trumpet's peal--\n    Knee to knee and toe on heel--\n    Troop on troop the squadrons wheel\n            Outbrazening the sun!\n\n\nWITHIN a fortnight of the outbreak of the mutiny, men spoke with bated\nbreath about the Act of God. It burst at the moment when India's reins\nwere in the hands of some of the worst incompetents in history. A week\nfound strong men in control of things--the right men, with the right\nhandful behind them.\n\nSome of the men in charge went mad, and were relieved. Some threw\nup their commands. Some of the worst incompetents were killed by the\nmutineers, and more than one man who could have changed the course\nof history for the worse were taken sick and died. Instead of finding\nthemselves faced by spineless nincompoops, the rebels reeled before\nthe sudden, well-timed tactics of real officers with eyes and ears\nand brains. The mask was off on both sides, and the sudden, stripped\nefficiency of one was no less disconcerting than the unexpected\nrebellion of the other.\n\nByng-bahadur--\"Byng the Brigadier\"--was in command of a force again\nwithin three days of the news of the first massacre; and because he was\nByng, with Byng's record, and Byng's ability to handle loyal natives,\nthe men who succeeded to the reins packed him off at once with a free\nhand, and with no other orders than to hit, hit hard, and keep on\nhitting.\n\n\"Go for them, Byng, old man. Live off the country, keep moving, and\ndon't let 'em guess once what your next move's going to be!\"\n\nSo Byng recruited as he went, and struck like a brain-controlled tornado\nat whatever crossed his path. But irreparable damage had been done\nbefore the old school was relieved, and Byng--like others--was terribly\nshort of men. Many of his own irregulars were so enraged at having been\ndisbanded at a moment's notice that they refused to return to him. Their\nhonor, as they saw it, had been outraged. Only two British regiments\ncould be spared him, and they were both thinned by sickness from the\nfirst. They were Sikhs, who formed the bulk of his headquarterless\nbrigade, and many of them were last-minute friends, who came to him\nunorganized and almost utterly undrilled.\n\nBut Byng was a man of genius, and his bare reputation was enough to\noffset much in the way of unpreparedness. He coaxed and licked and\npraised his new men into shape as he went along; within a week he had\nstormed Deeseera, blowing up their greatest reserve of ammunition and\nmomentarily stunning the rebellion's leaders. But cholera took charge in\nthe city, and two days later found him hurrying out again, to camp\nwhere there was uncontaminated water, on rising ground that gave him the\ncommand of three main roads. It was there that the rebels cornered him.\n\nThey blew up a hundred-yard-long bridge behind him at the one point\nwhere a swiftly running river could be crossed, and from two other sides\nat once mutinied native regiments and thousands from the countryside\nflocked, hurrying to take a hand in what seemed destined to be Byng's\nlast action. The fact that so many swaggering soldier Sikhs were\ncornered with him was sufficient in itself to bring out Hindoo and\nMohammedan alike.\n\nThe mutinous regiments had all been drilled and taught by British\nofficers until they were as nearly perfect as the military knowledge of\nthe day could make them; the fact that they had killed their officers\nonly served to make them savage without detracting much from their\nefficiency. They had native officers quite capable of taking charge, and\nsense enough to retain their discipline.\n\nSo Byng intrenched himself on the gradual rise, and sent out as many\nmessengers as he could spare to bring reinforcements from whatever\nsource obtainable. Then, when almost none came, he got ready to die\nwhere he stood, using all the soldier gift he had to put courage into\nthe last-ditch loyalists who offered to die with him. He had counted\nmost on aid from Cunningham and Mahommed Gunga, but that source seemed\nto have failed him; and he gave up hope of their arrival when a body\nof several thousand rebels took up position on his flank and cut off\napproach from the direction whence Cunningham should come.\n\nThe sun blazed down like molten hell on sick and wounded. Rotting\ncarcasses of horses and cattle, killed by the rebels' artillery-fire,\nlay stenching here and there, and there was no possibility of disposing\nof them. A day came very soon, indeed, when horse, or occasional\ntransport bullock, was all there was to eat, and a night came when\nGovind Singh, the leader of the Sikhs, came to him and remonstrated.\n\nThe old man had to be carried to Byng's tent, for a round shot had\ndisabled him, and he had himself set down by the tent-door, where the\nGeneral sat on a camp-stool.\n\n\"General-sahib, I have not been asked for advice; I am here to offer\nit.\"\n\nThe huge black dome of heaven was punctuated by a billion dots of steely\nwhite that looked like pin-pricks. All the light there was came from the\nfitful watch-fires, where even the wagons were being burned now that\nthe meagre supply of rough timber was giving out. The rebels, too, were\nburning everything on which they could lay their hands, and from between\nthe spaced-out glow of their bonfires came ever and again the spurt of\ncannon-flame.\n\n\"Speak, Govind Singh!\"\n\n\"Sahib, we have no artillery with which to answer them. We have no food;\nand the supply of ammunition wanes. Shall we die here like cattle in a\nslaughter-house?\"\n\n\"This is as good as any other place\" said Byng.\n\n\"Nay, sahib!\" \"How, then?\"\n\n\"In their lines is a better place! Here is nothing better than a\nshambles, with none but our men falling. They know that our food is\ngiving out--they know that we lose heavily--they wait. They will wait\nfor days yet before they close in to finish what their guns have but\nbegun, and--then--how many will there be to die desperately, as is\nfitting?\"\n\n\"We might get reinforcements in the morning, Govind Singh.\"\n\n\"And again, we might not, sahib!\"\n\n\"I sent a number of messengers before we were shut in.\"\n\n\"Yes, sahib--and to whom? To men who would ask you to reinforce them if\nthey could get word to you! Tomorrow our rear will be surrounded, too;\nthey have laid planks across the little streams behind us, and are\npreparing to drag guns to that side, too. Now, sahib, we have fire left\nin us. We can smite yet, and do damage while we die. Tomorrow night\nmay find us decimated and without heart for the finish. I advise you to\nadvance at dawn, sahib!\"\n\nThat advice came as a great relief to Byng-bahadur. He had been the\nfirst to see the hopelessness of the position, and every instinct that\nhe had told him to finish matters, not in the last reeking ditch, but\nahead, where the enemy would suffer fearfully while a desperate charge\nroared into them, to peter out when the last man went down fighting.\nSurrender was unthinkable, and in any event would have been no good,\nfor the mutineers would be sure to butcher all their prisoners; his only\nother chance had been to hold out until relief came, and that hope was\nnow forlorn.\n\nA Mohammedan stepped out of blackness and saluted him--a native officer,\nin charge of a handful of irregular cavalry, whose horses had all been\nshot.\n\n\"Well--what is it?\"\n\n\"This, sahib. Do we die here? I and my men would prefer to die yonder,\nwhere a mutineer or two would pay the price!\"\n\nA Ghoorka officer--small as a Japanese and sturdy-looking came up next.\nThe whole thing was evidently preconcerted.\n\n\"My men ask leave to show the way into the ranks ahead, General-sahib!\nThey are overweary of this shambles!\"\n\n\"We will advance at dawn!\" said Byng. \"Egan--\" He turned to a British\nofficer, who was very nearly all the staff he had. \"Drag that table up.\nLet's have some paper here and a pencil, and we'll work out the best\nplan possible.\"\n\nHe sent for the commanding officers of the British regiments--both of\nthem captains, but the seniors surviving--and a weird scene followed\nround the lamp set on the tiny table. British, Sikh, Mohammedan, and\nGhoorka clustered close to him, and watched as his pencil traced\nthe different positions and showed the movement that was to make the\nmorrow's finish, their faces outlined in the lamp's yellow glow and\ntheir breath coming deep and slow as they agreed on how the greatest\ndamage could be done the enemy before the last man died.\n\nAs he finished, and assigned each leader to his share in the last\nassault that any one of them would take a part in, a streak of light\nblazed suddenly across the sky. A shooting-star swept in a wide parabola\nto the horizon. A murmur went up from the wakeful lines, and the silence\nof the graveyard followed.\n\n\"There is our sign, sahib!\" laughed the Mohammedan. The old Sikh nodded\nand the Ghoorka grinned. \"It is the end!\" he said, without a trace of\ndiscouragement.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Byng, his face, too, turned upward.\n\n\"What, then, does it mean, sahib?\"\n\n\"That--it means that God Almighty has relieved a picket! We're the\npicket. We're relieved! We advance at dawn, and we'll get through\nsomehow! Join your commands, gentlemen, and explain the details\ncarefully to your men--let's have no misunderstandings.\"\n\nThe dawn rose gold and beautiful upon a sleepless camp that reeked and\nsteamed with hell-hot suffering. It showed the rebels stationary, still\nin swarming lines, but scouts reported several thousand of them moving\nin a body from the flank toward the British rear.\n\n\"What proportion of the rebel force?\" asked Byng. \"New arrivals, or some\nof the old ones taking up a new position?\"\n\n\"The same crowd, sir. They're just moving round to hem us in\ncompletely.\"\n\n\"So much the better for us, then! That leaves fewer for us to deal with\nin front.\"\n\nAs he spoke another man came running to report the arrival of five\ngallopers, coming hell-bent-for leather, one by one and scattered,\nwith the evident purpose of allowing one man to get through, whatever\nhappened.\n\n\"That'll be relief at last!\" said Byng-bahadur. And, instead of ordering\nthe advance immediately, he waited, scouring the sky-line with his\nglasses.\n\n\"Yes--dust--lance-heads--one--two--three divisions, coming in a hurry.\"\n\nBeing on rising ground, he saw the distant relieving force much sooner\nthan the rebels did, and he knew that it was help for him on the way\nsome time before the first of the five gallopers careered into the camp,\nand shouted:\n\n\"Cunnigan-bahadur comes with fifteen hundred!\"\n\n\"Fifteen hundred,\" muttered Byng. \"That merely serves to postpone the\nfinish by an hour or two!\"\n\nBut he waited; and presently the rebel scouts brought word, and their\nleaders, too, became aware of reinforcements on the way for somebody.\nThey made the mistake, though, of refusing to believe that any help\ncould be coming for the British, and by the time that messengers had\nhurried from the direction of the British rear, to tell of gallopers who\nhad ridden past them and been swallowed by the shouting British lines,\nthree squadrons on fresh horses were close enough to be reckoned\ndangerous.\n\n\"Is that a gun they've got with them?\" wondered Byng. \"By the lord\nHarry, no,--it's a coach and six! They're flogging it along like a\ntwelve-pounder! And what the devil's in those wagons?\"\n\nBut he had no time for guesswork. The desultory thunder of the rebel\nordnance ceased, and the whole mass that hemmed him in began to revolve\nwithin itself, and present a new front to the approaching cavalry.\n\n\"Caught on the hop, by God! The whole line will advance! Trumpeter!\"\n\nOne trumpet-call blared out and a dozen echoed it. In a second more a\nroar went up that is only heard on battle-fields. It has none of the\nexultant shout of joy or of the rage that a mob throws up to heaven;\nit is not even anger, as the cities know it, or the men who riot\nfor advantage. It is a welcome ironically offered up to\nDeath--full-throated, and more freighted with moral effect on an enemy\nthan a dozen salvoes of artillery.\n\nThe thousands ahead tried hard to turn again and face two attacks at\nonce; but, though the units were efficiently controlled, there were none\nwho could swing the whole. Byng's decimated, forward-rushing fragment\nof a mixed brigade, tight-reined and working like a piece of mechanism,\nstruck home into a mass of men who writhed, and fell away, and shouted\nto each other. A third of them was out of reach, beyond the British\nrear; fully another third was camped too far away to bring assistance at\nthe first wild onslaught. Messengers were sent to bring them up, but the\nmessengers were overtaken by a horde who ran.\n\nThen, like arrows driven by the bows of death, three squadrons took them\non the flank as Cunningham changed direction suddenly and loosed his\nfull weight at the guns. Instead of standing and serving grape, the\nrebel gunners tried to get their ordnance away--facing about again too\nlate, when the squadrons were almost on them. Then they died gamely,\nwhen gameness served no further purpose. The Rangars rode them down and\nbutchered them, capturing every single gun, and leaving them while they\ncharged again at the rallying hordes ahead.\n\nThe strange assortment of horsed wagons and the lumbering six-horse\ncoach took full advantage of the momentary confusion to make at a gallop\nfor the British rear, where they drew up in line behind the Sikhs, who\nwere volleying at short range in the centre.\n\nByng detached two companies of British soldiers to do their amateur\ndamnedest with the guns, and, for infantry, they did good service with\nthem; fifteen or twenty minutes after the first onslaught the enemy was\nwrithing under the withering attention of his own abandoned ordnance.\nBut the odds were still tremendous, and the weight of numbers made the\nultimate outcome of the battle seem a foregone conclusion.\n\nFrom the British rear heads appeared above the rising ground; the\ndeserted camp was rushed and set alight. The tents blazed like a beacon\nlight, and a moment later the Ghoorkas retaliated by setting fire to\nsuch of the rebel camp as had fallen into British hands.\n\nIt was those two fires that saved the day. From the sky-line to the\nrebel rear came the thunder of a salvo of artillery. It was the short\nbark of twelve-pounders loaded up with blank--a signal--and the rebels\ndid not wait to see whether this was friend or foe. Help from one\nunexpected source had reached the British; this, they argued, was\nprobably another column moving to the relief, and they drew off in\nreasonably decent order--harried, pestered, stung, as they attempted\nto recover camp-equipment or get away with stores and wagons, by\nCunningham, Alwa, and Mahommed Gunga.\n\nIn another hour the rebel army was a black swarm spreading on the\neastern sky-line, and on the far horizon to the north there shone the\nglint of bayonets and helmet spikes, the dancing gleam of lance-tips,\nand the dazzle from the long, polished bodies of a dozen guns. A\ngalloper spurred up with a message for Byng.\n\n\"You are to join my command,\" it ran, \"for a raid in force on Howrah,\nwhere the rebels are supposed to have been concentrating for months\npast. The idea is to paralyze the vitals of the movement before\nconcentrating somewhere on the road to Delhi, where the rebels are sure\nto make a most determined stand.\"\n\nAs he read it Mahommed Gunga galloped up to him, grinning like a boy.\n\n\"Cunnigan-sahib's respects, General-sahib! He asks leave to call his men\noff, saying that he has done all the damage possible with only fifteen\nhundred.\"\n\n\"Yes. Call 'em off and send Cunningham to me. How did he shape?\"\n\n\"Like a son of Cunnigan-bahadur! General-sahib-salaam!\"\n\n\"No. Here, you old ruffian--shake hands, will you? Now send Cunningham\nto me.\"\n\nCunningham came up fifteen minutes later, with a Rangar orderly behind\nhim, and did his best to salute as though it were nothing more than an\nordinary meeting.\n\n\"Oh! Here you are. 'Gratulate you, Cunningham! You came in the nick of\ntime. What kept you?\"\n\n\"That 'ud take a long time to tell, sir. I've fifteen hundred horses\nabout ten miles from here, sir, left in charge of native levies, and\nI'd like permission to go and fetch them before the levies make off with\nthem.\"\n\n\"Splendid! Yes, you'd better go for them. What's in the wagons.\"\n\n\"The Howrah treasure, sir!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The whole of the Howrah treasure, sir! It's held as security. Howrah\nguarantees to keep the peace and protect the homes of my men. I\nguaranteed to hand him back the treasure when the show's over, less\ndeductions for damage done!\"\n\n\"Well, I'm--Who thought of that? You or Mahommed Gunga?\"\n\n\"Oh, I expect we cooked it up between us, sir.\"\n\n\"H-rrrr-umph! And what's in the six-horse coach?\"\n\n\"A lady and her father.\"\n\n\"The deuce they are!\"\n\nByng rode up to the lumbering vehicle, signing to Cunningham to follow\nhim.\n\n\"General Byng,\" said Cunningham. \"Miss McClean, sir.\"\n\nA very much dishevelled and very weary-looking young woman with a\nwealth of chestnut hair leaned through the window and smiled, not at the\nGeneral but at Cunningham. Byng stared--looked from one to the other of\nthem--and said \"Hu-rrrr-umph!\" again.\n\n\"It was she who made the whole thing possible, sir.\"\n\n\"The very deuce it was!\" It began to be evident that Byng was not a\nladies' man!\n\n\"This is Mr. McClean, sir--Rosemary's father. He helped her put the\nwhole scheme through.\"\n\nByng nodded to the missionary and looked back at Rosemary McClean--then\nfrom her to Cunningham again.\n\n\"Hu-rrrr-umph! Christian names already! More 'gratulations, eh?\"\n\nRosemary's head and shoulders disappeared and Cunningham looked foolish.\n\n\"Well! Send Mahommed Gunga for the horses. Ride over there to where you\nsee General Evans's column and tell him the whole story. Take a small\nescort and the treasure with you. And--ah--er--lemme see--take this\ncarriage, too. Oh, by the bye--you'd better ask General Evans to make\nsome arrangements for Miss McClean. Leave her over there with the\ntreasure. I want you back with my brigade, and I want you to be some\nsort of use. Can't have love-making with the brigade, Mr. Cunningham!\"\n\nThe Brigadier rode off with a very perfunctory salute.\n\n\"Isn't he a rather curmudgeony sort of officer?\" asked Rosemary the\nmoment that his back was turned.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" laughed Cunningham. \"That's Byng-bahadur's little way, that's\nall. He's quite likely to insist on being best man or something of that\nsort when the show's all over! Wait here while I fetch the escort.\"\n\n\n                END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Rung Ho!, by Talbot Mundy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RUNG HO! ***\n\n***** This file should be named 5153-8.txt or 5153-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/5/5153/\n\nProduced by M.R.J.\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
