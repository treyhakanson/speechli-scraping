Who hold Zam-Zammah, that\n'fire-breathing dragon', hold the Punjab, for the great green-bronze\npiece is always first of the conqueror's loot.\n\nThere was some justification for Kim--he had kicked Lala Dinanath's boy\noff the trunnions--since the English held the Punjab and Kim was\nEnglish.  Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the\nvernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain\nsing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the\nsmall boys of the bazar; Kim was white--a poor white of the very\npoorest.  The half-caste woman who looked after him (she smoked opium,\nand pretended to keep a second-hand furniture shop by the square where\nthe cheap cabs wait) told the missionaries that she was Kim's mother's\nsister; but his mother had been nursemaid in a Colonel's family and had\nmarried Kimball O'Hara, a young colour-sergeant of the Mavericks, an\nIrish regiment.  He afterwards took a post on the Sind, Punjab, and\nDelhi Railway, and his Regiment went home without him.  The wife died\nof cholera in Ferozepore, and O'Hara fell to drink and loafing up and\ndown the line with the keen-eyed three-year-old baby.  Societies and\nchaplains, anxious for the child, tried to catch him, but O'Hara\ndrifted away, till he came across the woman who took opium and learned\nthe taste from her, and died as poor whites die in India.  His estate\nat death consisted of three papers--one he called his 'ne varietur'\nbecause those words were written below his signature thereon, and\nanother his 'clearance-certificate'.  The third was Kim's\nbirth-certificate.  Those things, he was used to say, in his glorious\nopium-hours, would yet make little Kimball a man.  On no account was\nKim to part with them, for they belonged to a great piece of\nmagic--such magic as men practised over yonder behind the Museum, in\nthe big blue-and-white Jadoo-Gher--the Magic House, as we name the\nMasonic Lodge.  It would, he said, all come right some day, and Kim's\nhorn would be exalted between pillars--monstrous pillars--of beauty and\nstrength.  The Colonel himself, riding on a horse, at the head of the\nfinest Regiment in the world, would attend to Kim--little Kim that\nshould have been better off than his father.  Nine hundred first-class\ndevils, whose God was a Red Bull on a green field, would attend to Kim,\nif they had not forgotten O'Hara--poor O'Hara that was gang-foreman on\nthe Ferozepore line.  Then he would weep bitterly in the broken rush\nchair on the veranda.  So it came about after his death that the woman\nsewed parchment, paper, and birth-certificate into a leather\namulet-case which she strung round Kim's neck.\n\n'And some day,' she said, confusedly remembering O'Hara's prophecies,\n'there will come for you a great Red Bull on a green field, and the\nColonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and' dropping into\nEnglish--'nine hundred devils.'\n\n'Ah,' said Kim, 'I shall remember.  A Red Bull and a Colonel on a horse\nwill come, but first, my father said, will come the two men making\nready the ground for these matters.  That is how my father said they\nalways did; and it is always so when men work magic.'\n\nIf the woman had sent Kim up to the local Jadoo-Gher with those papers,\nhe would, of course, have been taken over by the Provincial Lodge, and\nsent to the Masonic Orphanage in the Hills; but what she had heard of\nmagic she distrusted.  Kim, too, held views of his own.  As he reached\nthe years of indiscretion, he learned to avoid missionaries and white\nmen of serious aspect who asked who he was, and what he did.  For Kim\ndid nothing with an immense success.  True, he knew the wonderful\nwalled city of Lahore from the Delhi Gate to the outer Fort Ditch; was\nhand in glove with men who led lives stranger than anything Haroun al\nRaschid dreamed of; and he lived in a life wild as that of the Arabian\nNights, but missionaries and secretaries of charitable societies could\nnot see the beauty of it.  His nickname through the wards was 'Little\nFriend of all the World'; and very often, being lithe and\ninconspicuous, he executed commissions by night on the crowded\nhousetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion.  It was\nintrigue,--of course he knew that much, as he had known all evil since\nhe could speak,--but what he loved was the game for its own sake--the\nstealthy prowl through the dark gullies and lanes, the crawl up a\nwaterpipe, the sights and sounds of the women's world on the flat\nroofs, and the headlong flight from housetop to housetop under cover of\nthe hot dark. Then there were holy men, ash-smeared fakirs by their\nbrick shrines under the trees at the riverside, with whom he was quite\nfamiliar--greeting them as they returned from begging-tours, and, when\nno one was by, eating from the same dish.  The woman who looked after\nhim insisted with tears that he should wear European clothes--trousers,\na shirt and a battered hat.  Kim found it easier to slip into Hindu or\nMohammedan garb when engaged on certain businesses.  One of the young\nmen of fashion--he who was found dead at the bottom of a well on the\nnight of the earthquake--had once given him a complete suit of Hindu\nkit, the costume of a lowcaste street boy, and Kim stored it in a\nsecret place under some baulks in Nila Ram's timber-yard, beyond the\nPunjab High Court, where the fragrant deodar logs lie seasoning after\nthey have driven down the Ravi.  When there was business or frolic\nafoot, Kim would use his properties, returning at dawn to the veranda,\nall tired out from shouting at the heels of a marriage procession, or\nyelling at a Hindu festival.  Sometimes there was food in the house,\nmore often there was not, and then Kim went out again to eat with his\nnative friends.\n\nAs he drummed his heels against Zam-Zammah he turned now and again from\nhis king-of-the-castle game with little Chota Lal and Abdullah the\nsweetmeat-seller's son, to make a rude remark to the native policeman\non guard over rows of shoes at the Museum door. The big Punjabi grinned\ntolerantly:  he knew Kim of old.  So did the water-carrier, sluicing\nwater on the dry road from his goat-skin bag.  So did Jawahir Singh,\nthe Museum carpenter, bent over new packing-cases.  So did everybody in\nsight except the peasants from the country, hurrying up to the Wonder\nHouse to view the things that men made in their own province and\nelsewhere.  The Museum was given up to Indian arts and manufactures,\nand anybody who sought wisdom could ask the Curator to explain.\n\n'Off!  Off!  Let me up!' cried Abdullah, climbing up Zam-Zammah's wheel.\n\n'Thy father was a pastry-cook, Thy mother stole the ghi,' sang Kim.\n'All Mussalmans fell off Zam-Zammah long ago!'\n\n'Let me up!' shrilled little Chota Lal in his gilt-embroidered cap.\nHis father was worth perhaps half a million sterling, but India is the\nonly democratic land in the world.\n\n'The Hindus fell off Zam-Zammah too.  The Mussalmans pushed them off.\nThy father was a pastry-cook--'\n\nHe stopped; for there shuffled round the corner, from the roaring Motee\nBazar, such a man as Kim, who thought he knew all castes, had never\nseen.  He was nearly six feet high, dressed in fold upon fold of dingy\nstuff like horse-blanketing, and not one fold of it could Kim refer to\nany known trade or profession.  At his belt hung a long open-work iron\npencase and a wooden rosary such as holy men wear.  On his head was a\ngigantic sort of tam-o'-shanter. His face was yellow and wrinkled, like\nthat of Fook Shing, the Chinese bootmaker in the bazar.  His eyes\nturned up at the corners and looked like little slits of onyx.\n\n'Who is that?' said Kim to his companions.\n\n'Perhaps it is a man,' said Abdullah, finger in mouth, staring.\n\n'Without doubt,' returned Kim; 'but he is no man of India that I have\never seen.'\n\n'A priest, perhaps,' said Chota Lal, spying the rosary.  'See!  He goes\ninto the Wonder House!'\n\n'Nay, nay,' said the policeman, shaking his head.  'I do not understand\nyour talk.'  The constable spoke Punjabi.  'O Friend of all the World,\nwhat does he say?'\n\n'Send him hither,' said Kim, dropping from Zam-Zammah, flourishing his\nbare heels.  'He is a foreigner, and thou art a buffalo.'\n\nThe man turned helplessly and drifted towards the boys.  He was old,\nand his woollen gaberdine still reeked of the stinking artemisia of the\nmountain passes.\n\n'O Children, what is that big house?' he said in very fair Urdu.\n\n'The Ajaib-Gher, the Wonder House!'  Kim gave him no title--such as\nLala or Mian.  He could not divine the man's creed.\n\n'Ah!  The Wonder House!  Can any enter?'\n\n'It is written above the door--all can enter.'\n\n'Without payment?'\n\n'I go in and out.  I am no banker,' laughed Kim.\n\n'Alas!  I am an old man.  I did not know.'  Then, fingering his rosary,\nhe half turned to the Museum.\n\n'What is your caste?  Where is your house?  Have you come far?'  Kim\nasked.\n\n'I came by Kulu--from beyond the Kailas--but what know you? From the\nHills where'--he sighed--'the air and water are fresh and cool.'\n\n'Aha!  Khitai [a Chinaman],' said Abdullah proudly.  Fook Shing had\nonce chased him out of his shop for spitting at the joss above the\nboots.\n\n'Pahari [a hillman],' said little Chota Lal.\n\n'Aye, child--a hillman from hills thou'lt never see.  Didst hear of\nBhotiyal [Tibet]?  I am no Khitai, but a Bhotiya [Tibetan], since you\nmust know--a lama--or, say, a guru in your tongue.'\n\n'A guru from Tibet,' said Kim.  'I have not seen such a man.  They be\nHindus in Tibet, then?'\n\n'We be followers of the Middle Way, living in peace in our lamasseries,\nand I go to see the Four Holy Places before I die. Now do you, who are\nchildren, know as much as I do who am old.' He smiled benignantly on\nthe boys.\n\n'Hast thou eaten?'\n\nHe fumbled in his bosom and drew forth a worn, wooden begging-bowl. The\nboys nodded.  All priests of their acquaintance begged.\n\n'I do not wish to eat yet.'  He turned his head like an old tortoise in\nthe sunlight.  'Is it true that there are many images in the Wonder\nHouse of Lahore?'  He repeated the last words as one making sure of an\naddress.\n\n'That is true,' said Abdullah.  'It is full of heathen busts.  Thou\nalso art an idolater.'\n\n'Never mind him,' said.  Kim.  'That is the Government's house and\nthere is no idolatry in it, but only a Sahib with a white beard. Come\nwith me and I will show.'\n\n'Strange priests eat boys,' whispered Chota Lal.\n\n'And he is a stranger and a but-parast [idolater],' said Abdullah, the\nMohammedan.\n\nKim laughed.  'He is new.  Run to your mothers' laps, and be safe.\nCome!'\n\nKim clicked round the self-registering turnstile; the old man followed\nand halted amazed.  In the entrance-hall stood the larger figures of\nthe Greco-Buddhist sculptures done, savants know how long since, by\nforgotten workmen whose hands were feeling, and not unskilfully, for\nthe mysteriously transmitted Grecian touch. There were hundreds of\npieces, friezes of figures in relief, fragments of statues and slabs\ncrowded with figures that had encrusted the brick walls of the Buddhist\nstupas and viharas of the North Country and now, dug up and labelled,\nmade the pride of the Museum.  In open-mouthed wonder the lama turned\nto this and that, and finally checked in rapt attention before a large\nalto-relief representing a coronation or apotheosis of the Lord Buddha.\nThe Master was represented seated on a lotus the petals of which were\nso deeply undercut as to show almost detached. Round Him was an adoring\nhierarchy of kings, elders, and old-time Buddhas.  Below were\nlotus-covered waters with fishes and water-birds.  Two butterfly-winged\ndevas held a wreath over His head; above them another pair supported an\numbrella surmounted by the jewelled headdress of the Bodhisat.\n\n'The Lord!  The Lord!  It is Sakya Muni himself,' the lama half sobbed;\nand under his breath began the wonderful Buddhist invocation:\n\nTo Him the Way, the Law, apart, Whom Maya held beneath her heart,\nAnanda's Lord, the Bodhisat.\n\n'And He is here!  The Most Excellent Law is here also.  My pilgrimage\nis well begun.  And what work!  What work!'\n\n'Yonder is the Sahib.'  said Kim, and dodged sideways among the cases\nof the arts and manufacturers wing.  A white-bearded Englishman was\nlooking at the lama, who gravely turned and saluted him and after some\nfumbling drew forth a note-book and a scrap of paper.\n\n'Yes, that is my name,' smiling at the clumsy, childish print.\n\n'One of us who had made pilgrimage to the Holy Places--he is now Abbot\nof the Lung-Cho Monastery--gave it me,' stammered the lama.  'He spoke\nof these.'  His lean hand moved tremulously round.\n\n'Welcome, then, O lama from Tibet.  Here be the images, and I am\nhere'--he glanced at the lama's face--'to gather knowledge. Come to my\noffice awhile.'  The old man was trembling with excitement.\n\nThe office was but a little wooden cubicle partitioned off from the\nsculpture-lined gallery.  Kim laid himself down, his ear against a\ncrack in the heat-split cedar door, and, following his instinct,\nstretched out to listen and watch.\n\nMost of the talk was altogether above his head.  The lama, haltingly at\nfirst, spoke to the Curator of his own lamassery, the Such-zen,\nopposite the Painted Rocks, four months' march away.  The Curator\nbrought out a huge book of photos and showed him that very place,\nperched on its crag, overlooking the gigantic valley of many-hued\nstrata.\n\n'Ay, ay!'  The lama mounted a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles of Chinese\nwork.  'Here is the little door through which we bring wood before\nwinter.  And thou--the English know of these things? He who is now\nAbbot of Lung-Cho told me, but I did not believe. The Lord--the\nExcellent One--He has honour here too?  And His life is known?'\n\n'It is all carven upon the stones.  Come and see, if thou art rested.'\n\nOut shuffled the lama to the main hall, and, the Curator beside him,\nwent through the collection with the reverence of a devotee and the\nappreciative instinct of a craftsman.\n\nIncident by incident in the beautiful story he identified on the\nblurred stone, puzzled here and there by the unfamiliar Greek\nconvention, but delighted as a child at each new trove.  Where the\nsequence failed, as in the Annunciation, the Curator supplied it from\nhis mound of books--French and German, with photographs and\nreproductions.\n\nHere was the devout Asita, the pendant of Simeon in the Christian\nstory, holding the Holy Child on his knee while mother and father\nlistened; and here were incidents in the legend of the cousin\nDevadatta.  Here was the wicked woman who accused the Master of\nimpurity, all confounded; here was the teaching in the Deer-park; the\nmiracle that stunned the fire-worshippers; here was the Bodhisat in\nroyal state as a prince; the miraculous birth; the death at Kusinagara,\nwhere the weak disciple fainted; while there were almost countless\nrepetitions of the meditation under the Bodhi tree; and the adoration\nof the alms-bowl was everywhere.  In a few minutes the Curator saw that\nhis guest was no mere bead-telling mendicant, but a scholar of parts.\nAnd they went at it all over again, the lama taking snuff, wiping his\nspectacles, and talking at railway speed in a bewildering mixture of\nUrdu and Tibetan.  He had heard of the travels of the Chinese pilgrims,\nFu-Hiouen and Hwen-Tsiang, and was anxious to know if there was any\ntranslation of their record.  He drew in his breath as he turned\nhelplessly over the pages of Beal and Stanislas Julien.  ''Tis all\nhere.  A treasure locked.'  Then he composed himself reverently to\nlisten to fragments hastily rendered into Urdu.  For the first time he\nheard of the labours of European scholars, who by the help of these and\na hundred other documents have identified the Holy Places of Buddhism.\nThen he was shown a mighty map, spotted and traced with yellow.  The\nbrown finger followed the Curator's pencil from point to point.  Here\nwas Kapilavastu, here the Middle Kingdom, and here Mahabodhi, the Mecca\nof Buddhism; and here was Kusinagara, sad place of the Holy One's\ndeath.  The old man bowed his head over the sheets in silence for a\nwhile, and the Curator lit another pipe.  Kim had fallen asleep.  When\nhe waked, the talk, still in spate, was more within his comprehension.\n\n'And thus it was, O Fountain of Wisdom, that I decided to go to the\nHoly Places which His foot had trod--to the Birthplace, even to Kapila;\nthen to Mahabodhi, which is Buddh Gaya--to the Monastery--to the\nDeer-park--to the place of His death.'\n\nThe lama lowered his voice.  'And I come here alone.  For\nfive--seven--eighteen--forty years it was in my mind that the Old Law\nwas not well followed; being overlaid, as thou knowest, with devildom,\ncharms, and idolatry.  Even as the child outside said but now.  Ay,\neven as the child said, with but-parasti.'\n\n'So it comes with all faiths.'\n\n'Thinkest thou?  The books of my lamassery I read, and they were dried\npith; and the later ritual with which we of the Reformed Law have\ncumbered ourselves--that, too, had no worth to these old eyes.  Even\nthe followers of the Excellent One are at feud on feud with one\nanother.  It is all illusion.  Ay, maya, illusion. But I have another\ndesire'--the seamed yellow face drew within three inches of the\nCurator, and the long forefinger-nail tapped on the table.  'Your\nscholars, by these books, have followed the Blessed Feet in all their\nwanderings; but there are things which they have not sought out.  I\nknow nothing--nothing do I know--but I go to free myself from the Wheel\nof Things by a broad and open road.'  He smiled with most simple\ntriumph.  'As a pilgrim to the Holy Places I acquire merit.  But there\nis more.  Listen to a true thing.  When our gracious Lord, being as yet\na youth, sought a mate, men said, in His father's Court, that He was\ntoo tender for marriage.  Thou knowest?'\n\nThe Curator nodded, wondering what would come next.\n\n'So they made the triple trial of strength against all comers. And at\nthe test of the Bow, our Lord first breaking that which they gave Him,\ncalled for such a bow as none might bend.  Thou knowest?'\n\n'It is written.  I have read.'\n\n'And, overshooting all other marks, the arrow passed far and far beyond\nsight.  At the last it fell; and, where it touched earth, there broke\nout a stream which presently became a River, whose nature, by our\nLord's beneficence, and that merit He acquired ere He freed himself, is\nthat whoso bathes in it washes away all taint and speckle of sin.'\n\n'So it is written,' said the Curator sadly.\n\nThe lama drew a long breath.  'Where is that River?  Fountain of\nWisdom, where fell the arrow?'\n\n'Alas, my brother, I do not know,' said the Curator.\n\n'Nay, if it please thee to forget--the one thing only that thou hast\nnot told me.  Surely thou must know?  See, I am an old man!  I ask with\nmy head between thy feet, O Fountain of Wisdom.  We know He drew the\nbow!  We know the arrow fell!  We know the stream gushed!  Where, then,\nis the River?  My dream told me to find it. So I came.  I am here.  But\nwhere is the River?'\n\n'If I knew, think you I would not cry it aloud?'\n\n'By it one attains freedom from the Wheel of Things,' the lama went on,\nunheeding.  'The River of the Arrow!  Think again!  Some little stream,\nmaybe--dried in the heats?  But the Holy One would never so cheat an\nold man.'\n\n'I do not know.  I do not know.'\n\nThe lama brought his thousand-wrinkled face once more a handsbreadth\nfrom the Englishman's.  'I see thou dost not know. Not being of the\nLaw, the matter is hid from thee.'\n\n'Ay--hidden--hidden.'\n\n'We are both bound, thou and I, my brother.  But I'--he rose with a\nsweep of the soft thick drapery--'I go to cut myself free. Come also!'\n\n'I am bound,' said the Curator.  'But whither goest thou?'\n\n'First to Kashi [Benares]:  where else?  There I shall meet one of the\npure faith in a Jain temple of that city.  He also is a Seeker in\nsecret, and from him haply I may learn.  Maybe he will go with me to\nBuddh Gaya.  Thence north and west to Kapilavastu, and there will I\nseek for the River.  Nay, I will seek everywhere as I go--for the place\nis not known where the arrow fell.'\n\n'And how wilt thou go?  It is a far cry to Delhi, and farther to\nBenares.'\n\n'By road and the trains.  From Pathankot, having left the Hills, I came\nhither in a te-rain.  It goes swiftly.  At first I was amazed to see\nthose tall poles by the side of the road snatching up and snatching up\ntheir threads,'--he illustrated the stoop and whirl of a telegraph-pole\nflashing past the train.  'But later, I was cramped and desired to\nwalk, as I am used.'\n\n'And thou art sure of thy road?'  said the Curator.\n\n'Oh, for that one but asks a question and pays money, and the appointed\npersons despatch all to the appointed place.  That much I knew in my\nlamassery from sure report,' said the lama proudly.\n\n'And when dost thou go?'  The Curator smiled at the mixture of\nold-world piety and modern progress that is the note of India today.\n\n'As soon as may be.  I follow the places of His life till I come to the\nRiver of the Arrow.  There is, moreover, a written paper of the hours\nof the trains that go south.'\n\n'And for food?'  Lamas, as a rule, have good store of money somewhere\nabout them, but the Curator wished to make sure.\n\n'For the journey, I take up the Master's begging-bowl.  Yes.  Even as\nHe went so go I, forsaking the ease of my monastery.  There was with me\nwhen I left the hills a chela [disciple] who begged for me as the Rule\ndemands, but halting in Kulu awhile a fever took him and he died.  I\nhave now no chela, but I will take the alms-bowl and thus enable the\ncharitable to acquire merit.'  He nodded his head valiantly.  Learned\ndoctors of a lamassery do not beg, but the lama was an enthusiast in\nthis quest.\n\n'Be it so,' said the Curator, smiling.  'Suffer me now to acquire\nmerit.  We be craftsmen together, thou and I. Here is a new book of\nwhite English paper:  here be sharpened pencils two and three--thick\nand thin, all good for a scribe.  Now lend me thy spectacles.'\n\nThe Curator looked through them.  They were heavily scratched, but the\npower was almost exactly that of his own pair, which he slid into the\nlama's hand, saying:  'Try these.'\n\n'A feather!  A very feather upon the face.'  The old man turned his\nhead delightedly and wrinkled up his nose.  'How scarcely do I feel\nthem!  How clearly do I see!'\n\n'They be bilaur--crystal--and will never scratch.  May they help thee\nto thy River, for they are thine.'\n\n'I will take them and the pencils and the white note-book,' said the\nlama, 'as a sign of friendship between priest and priest--and now--' He\nfumbled at his belt, detached the open-work iron pincers, and laid it\non the Curator's table.  'That is for a memory between thee and me--my\npencase.  It is something old--even as I am.'\n\nIt was a piece of ancient design, Chinese, of an iron that is not\nsmelted these days; and the collector's heart in the Curator's bosom\nhad gone out to it from the first.  For no persuasion would the lama\nresume his gift.\n\n'When I return, having found the River, I will bring thee a written\npicture of the Padma Samthora such as I used to make on silk at the\nlamassery.  Yes--and of the Wheel of Life,' he chuckled, 'for we be\ncraftsmen together, thou and I.'\n\nThe Curator would have detained him:  they are few in the world who\nstill have the secret of the conventional brush-pen Buddhist pictures\nwhich are, as it were, half written and half drawn.  But the lama\nstrode out, head high in air, and pausing an instant before the great\nstatue of a Bodhisat in meditation, brushed through the turnstiles.\n\nKim followed like a shadow.  What he had overheard excited him wildly.\nThis man was entirely new to all his experience, and he meant to\ninvestigate further, precisely as he would have investigated a new\nbuilding or a strange festival in Lahore city. The lama was his trove,\nand he purposed to take possession.  Kim's mother had been Irish, too.\n\nThe old man halted by Zam-Zammah and looked round till his eye fell on\nKim.  The inspiration of his pilgrimage had left him for awhile, and he\nfelt old, forlorn, and very empty.\n\n'Do not sit under that gun,' said the policeman loftily.\n\n'Huh!  Owl!'  was Kim's retort on the lama's behalf.  'Sit under that\ngun if it please thee.  When didst thou steal the milkwoman's slippers,\nDunnoo?'\n\nThat was an utterly unfounded charge sprung on the spur of the moment,\nbut it silenced Dunnoo, who knew that Kim's clear yell could call up\nlegions of bad bazaar boys if need arose.\n\n'And whom didst thou worship within?'  said Kim affably, squatting in\nthe shade beside the lama.\n\n'I worshipped none, child.  I bowed before the Excellent Law.'\n\nKim accepted this new God without emotion.  He knew already a few score.\n\n'And what dost thou do?'\n\n'I beg.  I remember now it is long since I have eaten or drunk. What is\nthe custom of charity in this town?  In silence, as we do of Tibet, or\nspeaking aloud?'\n\n'Those who beg in silence starve in silence,' said Kim, quoting a\nnative proverb.  The lama tried to rise, but sank back again, sighing\nfor his disciple, dead in far-away Kulu.  Kim watched head to one side,\nconsidering and interested.\n\n'Give me the bowl.  I know the people of this city--all who are\ncharitable.  Give, and I will bring it back filled.'\n\nSimply as a child the old man handed him the bowl.\n\n'Rest, thou.  I know the people.'\n\nHe trotted off to the open shop of a kunjri, a low-caste\nvegetable-seller, which lay opposite the belt-tramway line down the\nMotee Bazar.  She knew Kim of old.\n\n'Oho, hast thou turned yogi with thy begging-bowl?'  she cried.\n\n'Nay.'  said Kim proudly.  'There is a new priest in the city--a man\nsuch as I have never seen.'\n\n'Old priest--young tiger,' said the woman angrily.  'I am tired of new\npriests!  They settle on our wares like flies.  Is the father of my son\na well of charity to give to all who ask?'\n\n'No,' said Kim.  'Thy man is rather yagi [bad-tempered] than yogi [a\nholy man].  But this priest is new.  The Sahib in the Wonder House has\ntalked to him like a brother.  O my mother, fill me this bowl.  He\nwaits.'\n\n'That bowl indeed!  That cow-bellied basket!  Thou hast as much grace\nas the holy bull of Shiv.  He has taken the best of a basket of onions\nalready, this morn; and forsooth, I must fill thy bowl. He comes here\nagain.'\n\nThe huge, mouse-coloured Brahmini bull of the ward was shouldering his\nway through the many-coloured crowd, a stolen plantain hanging out of\nhis mouth.  He headed straight for the shop, well knowing his\nprivileges as a sacred beast, lowered his head, and puffed heavily\nalong the line of baskets ere making his choice.  Up flew Kim's hard\nlittle heel and caught him on his moist blue nose.  He snorted\nindignantly, and walked away across the tram-rails, his hump quivering\nwith rage.\n\n'See!  I have saved more than the bowl will cost thrice over.  Now,\nmother, a little rice and some dried fish atop--yes, and some vegetable\ncurry.'\n\nA growl came out of the back of the shop, where a man lay.\n\n'He drove away the bull,' said the woman in an undertone.  'It is good\nto give to the poor.'  She took the bowl and returned it full of hot\nrice.\n\n'But my yogi is not a cow,' said Kim gravely, making a hole with his\nfingers in the top of the mound.  'A little curry is good, and a fried\ncake, and a morsel of conserve would please him, I think.'\n\n'It is a hole as big as thy head,' said the woman fretfully.  But she\nfilled it, none the less, with good, steaming vegetable curry, clapped\na fried cake atop, and a morsel of clarified butter on the cake, dabbed\na lump of sour tamarind conserve at the side; and Kim looked at the\nload lovingly.\n\n'That is good.  When I am in the bazar the bull shall not come to this\nhouse.  He is a bold beggar-man.'\n\n'And thou?'  laughed the woman.  'But speak well of bulls.  Hast thou\nnot told me that some day a Red Bull will come out of a field to help\nthee?  Now hold all straight and ask for the holy man's blessing upon\nme.  Perhaps, too, he knows a cure for my daughter's sore eyes.  Ask.\nhim that also, O thou Little Friend of all the World.'\n\nBut Kim had danced off ere the end of the sentence, dodging pariah dogs\nand hungry acquaintances.\n\n'Thus do we beg who know the way of it,' said he proudly to the lama,\nwho opened his eyes at the contents of the bowl.  'Eat now and--I will\neat with thee.  Ohe, bhisti!'  he called to the water-carrier, sluicing\nthe crotons by the Museum.  'Give water here.  We men are thirsty.'\n\n'We men!'  said the bhisti, laughing.  'Is one skinful enough for such\na pair?  Drink, then, in the name of the Compassionate.'\n\nHe loosed a thin stream into Kim's hands, who drank native fashion; but\nthe lama must needs pull out a cup from his inexhaustible upper\ndraperies and drink ceremonially.\n\n'Pardesi [a foreigner],' Kim explained, as the old man delivered in an\nunknown tongue what was evidently a blessing.\n\nThey ate together in great content, clearing the beggingbowl. Then the\nlama took snuff from a portentous wooden snuff-gourd, fingered his\nrosary awhile, and so dropped into the easy sleep of age, as the shadow\nof Zam-Zammah grew long.\n\nKim loafed over to the nearest tobacco-seller, a rather lively young\nMohammedan woman, and begged a rank cigar of the brand that they sell\nto students of the Punjab University who copy English customs.  Then he\nsmoked and thought, knees to chin, under the belly of the gun, and the\noutcome of his thoughts was a sudden and stealthy departure in the\ndirection of Nila Ram's timber-yard.\n\nThe lama did not wake till the evening life of the city had begun with\nlamp-lighting and the return of white-robed clerks and subordinates\nfrom the Government offices.  He stared dizzily in all directions, but\nnone looked at him save a Hindu urchin in a dirty turban and\nIsabella-coloured clothes.  Suddenly he bowed his head on his knees and\nwailed.\n\n'What is this?'  said the boy, standing before him.  'Hast thou been\nrobbed?'\n\n'It is my new chela [disciple] that is gone away from me, and I know\nnot where he is.'\n\n'And what like of man was thy disciple?'\n\n'It was a boy who came to me in place of him who died, on account of\nthe merit which I had gained when I bowed before the Law within there.'\nHe pointed towards the Museum.  'He came upon me to show me a road\nwhich I had lost.  He led me into the Wonder House, and by his talk\nemboldened me to speak to the Keeper of the Images, so that I was\ncheered and made strong.  And when I was faint with hunger he begged\nfor me, as would a chela for his teacher.  Suddenly was he sent.\nSuddenly has he gone away.  It was in my mind to have taught him the\nLaw upon the road to Benares.'\n\nKim stood amazed at this, because he had overheard the talk in the\nMuseum, and knew that the old man was speaking the truth, which is a\nthing a native on the road seldom presents to a stranger.\n\n'But I see now that he was but sent for a purpose.  By this I know that\nI shall find a certain River for which I seek.'\n\n'The River of the Arrow?'  said Kim, with a superior smile.\n\n'Is this yet another Sending?'  cried the lama.  'To none have I spoken\nof my search, save to the Priest of the Images.  Who art thou?'\n\n'Thy chela,' said Kim simply, sitting on his heels.  'I have never seen\nanyone like to thee in all this my life.  I go with thee to Benares.\nAnd, too, I think that so old a man as thou, speaking the truth to\nchance-met people at dusk, is in great need of a disciple.'\n\n'But the River--the River of the Arrow?'\n\n'Oh, that I heard when thou wast speaking to the Englishman.  I lay\nagainst the door.'\n\nThe lama sighed.  'I thought thou hadst been a guide permitted. Such\nthings fall sometimes--but I am not worthy.  Thou dost not, then, know\nthe River?'\n\n'Not I,' Kim laughed uneasily.  'I go to look for--for a bull--a Red.\nBull on a green field who shall help me.'  Boylike, if an acquaintance\nhad a scheme, Kim was quite ready with one of his own; and, boylike, he\nhad really thought for as much as twenty minutes at a time of his\nfather's prophecy.\n\n'To what, child?'  said the lama.\n\n'God knows, but so my father told me'.  I heard thy talk in the Wonder\nHouse of all those new strange places in the Hills, and if one so old\nand so little--so used to truth-telling--may go out for the small\nmatter of a river, it seemed to me that I too must go a-travelling.  If\nit is our fate to find those things we shall find them--thou, thy\nRiver; and I, my Bull, and the Strong Pillars and some other matters\nthat I forget.'\n\n'It is not pillars but a Wheel from which I would be free,' said the\nlama.\n\n'That is all one.  Perhaps they will make me a king,' said Kim,\nserenely prepared for anything.\n\n'I will teach thee other and better desires upon the road,' the lama\nreplied in the voice of authority.  'Let us go to Benares.'\n\n'Not by night.  Thieves are abroad.  Wait till the day.'\n\n'But there is no place to sleep.'  The old man was used to the order of\nhis monastery, and though he slept on the ground, as the Rule decrees,\npreferred a decency in these things.\n\n'We shall get good lodging at the Kashmir Serai,' said Kim, laughing at\nhis perplexity.  'I have a friend there.  Come!'\n\nThe hot and crowded bazars blazed with light as they made their way\nthrough the press of all the races in Upper India, and the lama mooned\nthrough it like a man in a dream.  It was his first experience of a\nlarge manufacturing city, and the crowded tram-car with its continually\nsquealing brakes frightened him.  Half pushed, half towed, he arrived\nat the high gate of the Kashmir Serai:  that huge open square over\nagainst the railway station, surrounded with arched cloisters, where\nthe camel and horse caravans put up on their return from Central Asia.\nHere were all manner of Northern folk, tending tethered ponies and\nkneeling camels; loading and unloading bales and bundles; drawing water\nfor the evening meal at the creaking well-windlasses; piling grass\nbefore the shrieking, wild-eyed stallions; cuffing the surly caravan\ndogs; paying off camel-drivers; taking on new grooms; swearing,\nshouting, arguing, and chaffering in the packed square.  The cloisters,\nreached by three or four masonry steps, made a haven of refuge around\nthis turbulent sea.  Most of them were rented to traders, as we rent\nthe arches of a viaduct; the space between pillar and pillar being\nbricked or boarded off into rooms, which were guarded by heavy wooden\ndoors and cumbrous native padlocks.  Locked doors showed that the owner\nwas away, and a few rude--sometimes very rude--chalk or paint scratches\ntold where he had gone.  Thus:  'Lutuf Ullah is gone to Kurdistan.'\nBelow, in coarse verse:  'O Allah, who sufferest lice to live on the\ncoat of a Kabuli, why hast thou allowed this louse Lutuf to live so\nlong?'\n\nKim, fending the lama between excited men and excited beasts, sidled\nalong the cloisters to the far end, nearest therailway station, where\nMahbub Ali, the horse-trader, lived when he came in from that\nmysterious land beyond the Passes of the North.\n\nKim had had many dealings with Mahbub in his little life, especially\nbetween his tenth and his thirteenth year--and the big burly Afghan,\nhis beard dyed scarlet with lime (for he was elderly and did not wish\nhis grey hairs to show), knew the boy's value as a gossip.  Sometimes\nhe would tell Kim to watch a man who had nothing whatever to do with\nhorses:  to follow him for one whole day and report every soul with\nwhom he talked.  Kim would deliver himself of his tale at evening, and\nMahbub would listen without a word or gesture.  It was intrigue of some\nkind, Kim knew; but its worth lay in saying nothing whatever to anyone\nexcept Mahbub, who gave him beautiful meals all hot from the cookshop\nat the head of the serai, and once as much as eight annas in money.\n\n'He is here,' said Kim, hitting a bad-tempered camel on the nose. 'Ohe.\nMahbub Ali!'  He halted at a dark arch and slipped behind the\nbewildered lama.\n\nThe horse-trader, his deep, embroidered Bokhariot belt unloosed, was\nlying on a pair of silk carpet saddle-bags, pulling lazily at an\nimmense silver hookah.  He turned his head very slightly at the cry;\nand seeing only the tall silent figure, chuckled in his deep chest.\n\n'Allah!  A lama!  A Red Lama!  It is far from Lahore to the Passes.\nWhat dost thou do here?'\n\nThe lama held out the begging-bowl mechanically.\n\n'God's curse on all unbelievers!'  said Mahbub.  'I do not give to a\nlousy Tibetan; but ask my Baltis over yonder behind the camels. They\nmay value your blessings.  Oh, horseboys, here is a countryman of\nyours.  See if he be hungry.'\n\nA shaven, crouching Balti, who had come down with the horses, and who\nwas nominally some sort of degraded Buddhist, fawned upon the priest,\nand in thick gutturals besought the Holy One to sit at the horseboys'\nfire.\n\n'Go!'  said Kim, pushing him lightly, and the lama strode away, leaving\nKim at the edge of the cloister.\n\n'Go!'  said Mahbub Ali, returning to his hookah.  'Little Hindu, run\naway.  God's curse on all unbelievers!  Beg from those of my tail who\nare of thy faith.'\n\n'Maharaj,' whined Kim, using the Hindu form of address, and thoroughly\nenjoying the situation; 'my father is dead--my mother is dead--my\nstomach is empty.'\n\n'Beg from my men among the horses, I say.  There must be some Hindus in\nmy tail.'\n\n'Oh, Mahbub Ali, but am I a Hindu?'  said Kim in English.\n\nThe trader gave no sign of astonishment, but looked under shaggy\neyebrows.\n\n'Little Friend of all the World,' said he, 'what is this?'\n\n'Nothing.  I am now that holy man's disciple; and we go a pilgrimage\ntogether--to Benares, he says.  He is quite mad, and I am tired of\nLahore city.  I wish new air and water.'\n\n'But for whom dost thou work?  Why come to me?'  The voice was harsh\nwith suspicion.\n\n'To whom else should I come?  I have no money.  It is not good to go\nabout without money.  Thou wilt sell many horses to the officers.  They\nare very fine horses, these new ones:  I have seen them.  Give me a\nrupee, Mahbub Ali, and when I come to my wealth I will give thee a bond\nand pay.'\n\n'Um!'  said Mahbub Ali, thinking swiftly.  'Thou hast never before lied\nto me.  Call that lama--stand back in the dark.'\n\n'Oh, our tales will agree,' said Kim, laughing.\n\n'We go to Benares,' said the lama, as soon as he understood the drift\nof Mahbub Ali's questions.  'The boy and I, I go to seek for a certain\nRiver.'\n\n'Maybe--but the boy?'\n\n'He is my disciple.  He was sent, I think, to guide me to that River.\nSitting under a gun was I when he came suddenly.  Such things have\nbefallen the fortunate to whom guidance was allowed. But I remember\nnow, he said he was of this world--a Hindu.'\n\n'And his name?'\n\n'That I did not ask.  Is he not my disciple?'\n\n'His country--his race--his village?  Mussalman--Sikh Hindu--Jain--low\ncaste or high?'\n\n'Why should I ask?  There is neither high nor low in the Middle Way.\nIf he is my chela--does--will--can anyone take him from me?  for, look\nyou, without him I shall not find my River.'  He wagged his head\nsolemnly.\n\n'None shall take him from thee.  Go, sit among my Baltis,' said Mahbub\nAli, and the lama drifted off, soothed by the promise.\n\n'Is he not quite mad?'  said Kim, coming forward to the light again.\n'Why should I lie to thee, Hajji?'\n\nMahbub puffed his hookah in silence.  Then he began, almost whispering:\n'Umballa is on the road to Benares--if indeed ye two go there.'\n\n'Tck!  Tck!  I tell thee he does not know how to lie--as we two know.'\n\n'And if thou wilt carry a message for me as far as Umballa, I will give\nthee money.  It concerns a horse--a white stallion which I have sold to\nan officer upon the last time I returned from the Passes.  But\nthen--stand nearer and hold up hands as begging--the pedigree of the\nwhite stallion was not fully established, and that officer, who is now\nat Umballa, bade me make it clear.'  (Mahbub here described the horse\nand the appearance of the officer.) 'So the message to that officer\nwill be:  \"The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.\"\nBy this will he know that thou comest from me.  He will then say \"What\nproof hast thou?\"  and thou wilt answer:  \"Mahbub Ali has given me the\nproof.\"'\n\n'And all for the sake of a white stallion,' said Kim, with a giggle,\nhis eyes aflame.\n\n'That pedigree I will give thee now--in my own fashion and some hard\nwords as well.'  A shadow passed behind Kim, and a feeding camel.\nMahbub Ali raised his voice.\n\n'Allah!  Art thou the only beggar in the city?  Thy mother is dead. Thy\nfather is dead.  So is it with all of them.  Well, well--'\n\nHe turned as feeling on the floor beside him and tossed a flap of soft,\ngreasy Mussalman bread to the boy.  'Go and lie down among my horseboys\nfor tonight--thou and the lama.  Tomorrow I may give thee service.'\n\nKim slunk away, his teeth in the bread, and, as he expected, he found a\nsmall wad of folded tissue-paper wrapped in oilskin, with three silver\nrupees--enormous largesse.  He smiled and thrust money and paper into\nhis leather amulet-case.  The lama, sumptuously fed by Mahbub's Baltis,\nwas already asleep in a corner of one of the stalls.  Kim lay down\nbeside him and laughed. He knew he had rendered a service to Mahbub\nAli, and not for one little minute did he believe the tale of the\nstallion's pedigree.\n\nBut Kim did not suspect that Mahbub Ali, known as one of the best\nhorse-dealers in the Punjab, a wealthy and enterprising trader, whose\ncaravans penetrated far and far into the Back of Beyond, was registered\nin one of the locked books of the Indian Survey Department as C25 IB.\nTwice or thrice yearly C25 would send in a little story, baldly told\nbut most interesting, and generally--it was checked by the statements\nof R17 and M4--quite true.  It concerned all manner of out-of-the-way\nmountain principalities, explorers of nationalities other than English,\nand the guntrade--was, in brief, a small portion of that vast mass of\n'information received' on which the Indian Government acts.  But,\nrecently, five confederated Kings, who had no business to confederate,\nhad been informed by a kindly Northern Power that there was a leakage\nof news from their territories into British India.  So those Kings'\nPrime Ministers were seriously annoyed and took steps, after the\nOriental fashion.  They suspected, among many others, the bullying,\nred-bearded horsedealer whose caravans ploughed through their\nfastnesses belly-deep in snow.  At least, his caravan that season had\nbeen ambushed and shot at twice on the way down, when Mahbub's men\naccounted for three strange ruffians who might, or might not, have been\nhired for the job.  Therefore Mahbub had avoided halting at the\ninsalubrious city of Peshawur, and had come through without stop to\nLahore, where, knowing his country-people, he anticipated curious\ndevelopments.\n\nAnd there was that on Mahbub Ali which he did not wish to keep an hour\nlonger than was necessary--a wad of closely folded tissue-paper,\nwrapped in oilskin--an impersonal, unaddressed statement, with five\nmicroscopic pin-holes in one corner, that most scandalously betrayed\nthe five confederated Kings, the sympathetic Northern Power, a Hindu\nbanker in Peshawur, a firm of gun-makers in Belgium, and an important,\nsemi-independent Mohammedan ruler to the south.  This last was R17's\nwork, which Mahbub had picked up beyond the Dora Pass and was carrying\nin for R17, who, owing to circumstances over which he had no control,\ncould not leave his post of observation.  Dynamite was milky and\ninnocuous beside that report of C25; and even an Oriental, with an\nOriental's views of the value of time, could see that the sooner it was\nin the proper hands the better.  Mahbub had no particular desire to die\nby violence, because two or three family blood-feuds across the Border\nhung unfinished on his hands, and when these scores were cleared he\nintended to settle down as a more or less virtuous citizen.  He had\nnever passed the serai gate since his arrival two days ago, but had\nbeen ostentatious in sending telegrams to Bombay, where he banked some\nof his money; to Delhi, where a sub-partner of his own clan was selling\nhorses to the agent of a Rajputana state; and to Umballa, where an\nEnglishman was excitedly demanding the pedigree of a white stallion.\nThe public letter-writer, who knew English, composed excellent\ntelegrams, such as:  'Creighton, Laurel Bank, Umballa. Horse is Arabian\nas already advised.  Sorrowful delayed pedigree which am translating.'\nAnd later to the same address:  'Much sorrowful delay.  Will forward\npedigree.'  To his sub-partner at Delhi he wired:  'Lutuf Ullah.  Have\nwired two thousand rupees your credit Luchman Narain's bank--' This was\nentirely in the way of trade, but every one of those telegrams was\ndiscussed and rediscussed, by parties who conceived themselves to be\ninterested, before they went over to the railway station in charge of a\nfoolish Balti, who allowed all sorts of people to read them on the road.\n\nWhen, in Mahbub's own picturesque language, he had muddied the wells of\ninquiry with the stick of precaution, Kim had dropped on him, sent from\nHeaven; and, being as prompt as he was unscrupulous, Mahbub Ali used to\ntaking all sorts of gusty chances, pressed him into service on the spot.\n\nA wandering lama with a low-caste boy-servant might attract a moment's\ninterest as they wandered about India, the land of pilgrims; but no one\nwould suspect them or, what was more to the point, rob.\n\nHe called for a new light-ball to his hookah, and considered the case.\nIf the worst came to the worst, and the boy came to harm, the paper\nwould incriminate nobody.  And he would go up to Umballa leisurely\nand--at a certain risk of exciting fresh suspicion--repeat his tale by\nword of mouth to the people concerned.\n\nBut R17's report was the kernel of the whole affair, and it would be\ndistinctly inconvenient if that failed to come to hand. However, God\nwas great, and Mahbub Ali felt he had done all he could for the time\nbeing.  Kim was the one soul in the world who had never told him a lie.\nThat would have been a fatal blot on Kim's character if Mahbub had not\nknown that to others, for his own ends or Mahbub's business, Kim could\nlie like an Oriental.\n\nThen Mahbub Ali rolled across the serai to the Gate of the Harpies who\npaint their eyes and trap the stranger, and was at some pains to call\non the one girl who, he had reason to believe, was a particular friend\nof a smooth-faced Kashmiri pundit who had waylaid his simple Balti in\nthe matter of the telegrams.  It was an utterly foolish thing to do;\nbecause they fell to drinking perfumed brandy against the Law of the\nProphet, and Mahbub grew wonderfully drunk, and the gates of his mouth\nwere loosened, and he pursued the Flower of Delight with the feet of\nintoxication till he fell flat among the cushions, where the Flower of\nDelight, aided by a smooth-faced Kashmiri pundit, searched him from\nhead to foot most thoroughly.\n\nAbout the same hour Kim heard soft feet in Mahbub's deserted stall.\nThe horse-trader, curiously enough, had left his door unlocked, and his\nmen were busy celebrating their return to India with a whole sheep of\nMahbub's bounty.  A sleek young gentleman from Delhi, armed with a\nbunch of keys which the Flower had unshackled from the senseless one's\nbelt, went through every single box, bundle, mat, and saddle-bag in\nMahbub's possession even more systematically than the Flower and the\npundit were searching the owner.\n\n'And I think.'  said the Flower scornfully an hour later, one rounded\nelbow on the snoring carcass, 'that he is no more than a pig of an\nAfghan horse-dealer, with no thought except women and horses.\nMoreover, he may have sent it away by now--if ever there were such a\nthing.'\n\n'Nay--in a matter touching Five Kings it would be next his black\nheart,' said the pundit.  'Was there nothing?'\n\nThe Delhi man laughed and resettled his turban as he entered.  'I\nsearched between the soles of his slippers as the Flower searched his\nclothes.  This is not the man but another.  I leave little unseen.'\n\n'They did not say he was the very man,' said the pundit thoughtfully.\n'They said, \"Look if he be the man, since our counsels are troubled.\"'\n\n'That North country is full of horse-dealers as an old coat of lice.\nThere is Sikandar Khan, Nur Ali Beg, and Farrukh Shah all heads of\nkafilas [caravans]--who deal there,' said the Flower.\n\n'They have not yet come in,' said the pundit.  'Thou must ensnare them\nlater.'\n\nPhew!'  said the Flower with deep disgust, rolling Mahbub's head from\nher lap.  'I earn my money.  Farrukh Shah is a bear, Ali Beg a\nswashbuckler, and old Sikandar Khan--yaie!  Go!  I sleep now.  This\nswine will not stir till dawn.'\n\nWhen Mahbub woke, the Flower talked to him severely on the sin of\ndrunkenness.  Asiatics do not wink when they have outmanoeuvred an\nenemy, but as Mahbub Ali cleared his throat, tightened his belt, and\nstaggered forth under the early morning stars, he came very near to it.\n\n'What a colt's trick!'  said he to himself.  'As if every girl in\nPeshawur did not use it!  But 'twas prettily done.  Now God He knows\nhow many more there be upon the Road who have orders to test\nme--perhaps with the knife.  So it stands that the boy must go to\nUmballa--and by rail--for the writing is something urgent.  I abide\nhere, following the Flower and drinking wine as an Afghan coper should.'\n\nHe halted at the stall next but one to his own.  His men lay there\nheavy with sleep.  There was no sign of Kim or the lama.\n\n'Up!'  He stirred a sleeper.  'Whither went those who lay here last\neven--the lama and the boy?  Is aught missing?'\n\n'Nay,' grunted the man, 'the old madman rose at second cockcrow saying\nhe would go to Benares, and the young one led him away.'\n\n'The curse of Allah on all unbelievers!'  said Mahbub heartily, and\nclimbed into his own stall, growling in his beard.\n\nBut it was Kim who had wakened the lama--Kim with one eye laid against\na knot-hole in the planking, who had seen the Delhi man's search\nthrough the boxes.  This was no common thief that turned over letters,\nbills, and saddles--no mere burglar who ran a little knife sideways\ninto the soles of Mahbub's slippers, or picked the seams of the\nsaddle-bags so deftly.  At first Kim had been minded to give the\nalarm--the long-drawn choor--choor! [thief!  thief!] that sets the\nserai ablaze of nights; but he looked more carefully, and, hand on\namulet, drew his own conclusions.\n\n'It must be the pedigree of that made-up horse-lie,' said he, 'the\nthing that I carry to Umballa.  Better that we go now.  Those who\nsearch bags with knives may presently search bellies with knives.\nSurely there is a woman behind this.  Hai!  Hai!  in a whisper to the\nlight-sleeping old man.  'Come.  It is time--time to go to Benares.'\n\nThe lama rose obediently, and they passed out of the serai like shadows.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\n  And whoso will, from Pride released;\n  Contemning neither creed nor priest,\n  May feel the Soul of all the East.\n  About him at Kamakura.\n\n  Buddha at Kamakura.\n\n\nThey entered the fort-like railway station, black in the end of night;\nthe electrics sizzling over the goods-yard where they handle the heavy\nNorthern grain-traffic.\n\n'This is the work of devils!'  said the lama, recoiling from the hollow\nechoing darkness, the glimmer of rails between the masonry platforms,\nand the maze of girders above.  He stood in a gigantic stone hall\npaved, it seemed, with the sheeted dead third-class passengers who had\ntaken their tickets overnight and were sleeping in the waiting-rooms.\nAll hours of the twenty-four are alike to Orientals, and their\npassenger traffic is regulated accordingly.\n\n'This is where the fire-carriages come.  One stands behind that\nhole'--Kim pointed to the ticket-office--'who will give thee a paper to\ntake thee to Umballa.'\n\n'But we go to Benares,' he replied petulantly.\n\n'All one.  Benares then.  Quick:  she comes!'\n\n'Take thou the purse.'\n\nThe lama, not so well used to trains as he had pretended, started as\nthe 3.25 a.m. south-bound roared in.  The sleepers sprang to life, and\nthe station filled with clamour and shoutings, cries of water and\nsweetmeat vendors, shouts of native policemen, and shrill yells of\nwomen gathering up their baskets, their families, and their husbands.\n\n'It is the train--only the te-rain.  It will not come here. Wait!'\nAmazed at the lama's immense simplicity (he had handed him a small bag\nfull of rupees), Kim asked and paid for a ticket to Umballa.  A sleepy\nclerk grunted and flung out a ticket to the next station, just six\nmiles distant.\n\n'Nay,' said Kim, scanning it with a grin.  'This may serve for farmers,\nbut I live in the city of Lahore.  It was cleverly done, Babu.  Now\ngive the ticket to Umballa.'\n\nThe Babu scowled and dealt the proper ticket.\n\n'Now another to Amritzar,' said Kim, who had no notion of spending\nMahbub Ali's money on anything so crude as a paid ride to Umballa.\n'The price is so much.  The small money in return is just so much.  I\nknow the ways of the te-rain ...  Never did yogi need chela as thou\ndost,' he went on merrily to the bewildered lama.  'They would have\nflung thee out at Mian Mir but for me. This way!  Come!'  He returned\nthe money, keeping only one anna in each rupee of the price of the\nUmballa ticket as his commission--the immemorial commission of Asia.\n\nThe lama jibbed at the open door of a crowded third-class carriage.\n'Were it not better to walk?'  said he weakly.\n\nA burly Sikh artisan thrust forth his bearded head.  'Is he afraid?  Do\nnot be afraid.  I remember the time when I was afraid of the te-rain.\nEnter!  This thing is the work of the Government.'\n\n'I do not fear,' said the lama.  'Have ye room within for two?'\n\n'There is no room even for a mouse,' shrilled the wife of a well-to-do\ncultivator--a Hindu Jat from the rich Jullundur, district. Our night\ntrains are not as well looked after as the day ones, where the sexes\nare very strictly kept to separate carriages.\n\n'Oh, mother of my son, we can make space,' said the blueturbaned\nhusband.  'Pick up the child.  It is a holy man, see'st thou?'\n\n'And my lap full of seventy times seven bundles!  Why not bid him sit\non my knee, Shameless?  But men are ever thus!'  She looked round for\napproval.  An Amritzar courtesan near the window sniffed behind her\nhead drapery.\n\n'Enter!  Enter!'  cried a fat Hindu money-lender, his folded\naccount-book in a cloth under his arm.  With an oily smirk:  'It is\nwell to be kind to the poor.'\n\n'Ay, at seven per cent a month with a mortgage on the unborn calf,'\nsaid a young Dogra soldier going south on leave; and they all laughed.\n\n'Will it travel to Benares?'  said the lama.\n\n'Assuredly.  Else why should we come?  Enter, or we are left,' cried\nKim.\n\n'See!'  shrilled the Amritzar girl.  'He has never entered a train. Oh,\nsee!'\n\n'Nay, help,' said the cultivator, putting out a large brown hand and\nhauling him in.  'Thus is it done, father.'\n\n'But--but--I sit on the floor.  It is against the Rule to sit on a\nbench,' said the lama.  'Moreover, it cramps me.'\n\n'I say,' began the money-lender, pursing his lips, 'that there is not\none rule of right living which these te-rains do not cause us to break.\nWe sit, for example, side by side with all castes and peoples.'\n\n'Yea, and with most outrageously shameless ones,' said the wife,\nscowling at the Amritzar girl making eyes at the young sepoy.\n\n'I said we might have gone by cart along the road,' said the husband,\n'and thus have saved some money.'\n\n'Yes--and spent twice over what we saved on food by the way. That was\ntalked out ten thousand times.'\n\n'Ay, by ten thousand tongues,' grunted he.\n\n'The Gods help us poor women if we may not speak.  Oho!  He is of that\nsort which may not look at or reply to a woman.'  For the lama,\nconstrained by his Rule, took not the faintest notice of her.  'And his\ndisciple is like him?'\n\n'Nay, mother,' said Kim most promptly.  'Not when the woman is\nwell-looking and above all charitable to the hungry.'\n\n'A beggar's answer,' said the Sikh, laughing.  'Thou hast brought it on\nthyself, sister!'  Kim's hands were crooked in supplication.\n\n'And whither goest thou?'  said the woman, handing him the half of a\ncake from a greasy package.\n\n'Even to Benares.'\n\n'Jugglers belike?'  the young soldier suggested.  'Have ye any tricks\nto pass the time?  Why does not that yellow man answer?'\n\n\n'Because,' said Kim stoutly, 'he is holy, and thinks upon matters\nhidden from thee.'\n\n'That may be well.  We of the Ludhiana Sikhs'--he rolled it out\nsonorously--'do not trouble our heads with doctrine.  We fight.'\n\n'My sister's brother's son is naik [corporal] in that regiment,' said\nthe Sikh craftsman quietly.  'There are also some Dogra companies\nthere.'  The soldier glared, for a Dogra is of other caste than a Sikh,\nand the banker tittered.\n\n'They are all one to me,' said the Amritzar girl.\n\n'That we believe,' snorted the cultivator's wife malignantly.\n\n'Nay, but all who serve the Sirkar with weapons in their hands are, as\nit were, one brotherhood.  There is one brotherhood of the caste, but\nbeyond that again'--she looked round timidly--'the bond of the\nPulton--the Regiment--eh?'\n\n'My brother is in a Jat regiment,' said the cultivator.  'Dogras be\ngood men.'\n\n'Thy Sikhs at least were of that opinion,' said the soldier, with a\nscowl at the placid old man in the corner.  'Thy Sikhs thought so when\nour two companies came to help them at the Pirzai Kotal in the face of\neight Afridi standards on the ridge not three months gone.'\n\nHe told the story of a Border action in which the Dogra companies of\nthe Ludhiana Sikhs had acquitted themselves well.  The Amritzar girl\nsmiled; for she knew the talk was to win her approval.\n\n'Alas!'  said the cultivator's wife at the end.  'So their villages\nwere burnt and their little children made homeless?'\n\n'They had marked our dead.  They paid a great payment after we of the\nSikhs had schooled them.  So it was.  Is this Amritzar?'\n\n'Ay, and here they cut our tickets,' said the banker, fumbling at his\nbelt.\n\nThe lamps were paling in the dawn when the half-caste guard came round.\nTicket-collecting is a slow business in the East, where people secrete\ntheir tickets in all sorts of curious places.  Kim produced his and was\ntold to get out.\n\n'But I go to Umballa,' he protested.  'I go with this holy man.'\n\n'Thou canst go to Jehannum for aught I care.  This ticket is only--'\n\nKim burst into a flood of tears, protesting that the lama was his\nfather and his mother, that he was the prop of the lama's declining\nyears, and that the lama would die without his care. All the carriage\nbade the guard be merciful--the banker was specially eloquent here--but\nthe guard hauled Kim on to the platform.  The lama blinked--he could\nnot overtake the situation and Kim lifted up his voice and wept outside\nthe carriage window.\n\n'I am very poor.  My father is dead--my mother is dead.  O charitable\nones, if I am left here, who shall tend that old man?'\n\n'What--what is this?'  the lama repeated.  'He must go to Benares. He\nmust come with me.  He is my chela.  If there is money to be paid--'\n\n'Oh, be silent,' whispered Kim; 'are we Rajahs to throw away good\nsilver when the world is so charitable?'\n\nThe Amritzar girl stepped out with her bundles, and it was on her that\nKim kept his watchful eye.  Ladies of that persuasion, he knew, were\ngenerous.\n\n'A ticket--a little tikkut to Umballa--O Breaker of Hearts!' She\nlaughed.  'Hast thou no charity?'\n\n'Does the holy man come from the North?'\n\n'From far and far in the North he comes,' cried Kim.  'From among the\nhills.'\n\n'There is snow among the pine-trees in the North--in the hills there is\nsnow.  My mother was from Kulu.  Get thee a ticket.  Ask him for a\nblessing.'\n\n'Ten thousand blessings,' shrilled Kim.  'O Holy One, a woman has given\nus in charity so that I can come with thee--a woman with a golden\nheart.  I run for the tikkut.'\n\nThe girl looked up at the lama, who had mechanically followed Kim to\nthe platform.  He bowed his head that he might not see her, and\nmuttered in Tibetan as she passed on with the crowd.\n\n'Light come--light go,' said the cultivator's wife viciously.\n\n'She has acquired merit,' returned the lama.  'Beyond doubt it was a\nnun.'\n\n'There be ten thousand such nuns in Amritzar alone.  Return, old man,\nor the te-rain may depart without thee,' cried the banker.\n\n'Not only was it sufficient for the ticket, but for a little food\nalso,' said Kim, leaping to his place.  'Now eat, Holy One.  Look. Day\ncomes!'\n\nGolden, rose, saffron, and pink, the morning mists smoked away across\nthe flat green levels.  All the rich Punjab lay out in the splendour of\nthe keen sun.  The lama flinched a little as the telegraph-posts swung\nby.\n\n'Great is the speed of the te-rain,' said the banker, with a\npatronizing grin.  'We have gone farther since Lahore than thou couldst\nwalk in two days:  at even, we shall enter Umballa.'\n\n'And that is still far from Benares,' said the lama wearily, mumbling\nover the cakes that Kim offered.  They all unloosed their bundles and\nmade their morning meal.  Then the banker, the cultivator, and the\nsoldier prepared their pipes and wrapped the compartment in choking,\nacrid smoke, spitting and coughing and enjoying themselves.  The Sikh\nand the cultivator's wife chewed pan; the lama took snuff and told his\nbeads, while Kim, cross-legged, smiled over the comfort of a full\nstomach.\n\n'What rivers have ye by Benares?'  said the lama of a sudden to the\ncarriage at large.\n\n'We have Gunga,' returned the banker, when the little titter had\nsubsided.\n\n'What others?'\n\n'What other than Gunga?'\n\n'Nay, but in my mind was the thought of a certain River of healing.'\n\n'That is Gunga.  Who bathes in her is made clean and goes to the Gods.\nThrice have I made pilgrimage to Gunga.'  He looked round proudly.\n\n'There was need,' said the young sepoy drily, and the travellers' laugh\nturned against the banker.\n\n'Clean--to return again to the Gods,' the lama muttered.  'And to go\nforth on the round of lives anew--still tied to the Wheel.' He shook\nhis head testily.  'But maybe there is a mistake.  Who, then, made\nGunga in the beginning?'\n\n'The Gods.  Of what known faith art thou?'  the banker said, appalled.\n\n'I follow the Law--the Most Excellent Law.  So it was the Gods that\nmade Gunga.  What like of Gods were they?'\n\nThe carriage looked at him in amazement.  It was inconceivable that\nanyone should be ignorant of Gunga.\n\n'What--what is thy God?'  said the money-lender at last.\n\n'Hear!'  said the lama, shifting the rosary to his hand.  'Hear: for I\nspeak of Him now!  O people of Hind, listen!'\n\nHe began in Urdu the tale of the Lord Buddha, but, borne by his own\nthoughts, slid into Tibetan and long-droned texts from a Chinese book\nof the Buddha's life.  The gentle, tolerant folk looked on reverently.\nAll India is full of holy men stammering gospels in strange tongues;\nshaken and consumed in the fires of their own zeal; dreamers, babblers,\nand visionaries:  as it has been from the beginning and will continue\nto the end.\n\n'Um!'  said the soldier of the Ludhiana Sikhs.  'There was a Mohammedan\nregiment lay next to us at the Pirzai Kotal, and a priest of theirs--he\nwas, as I remember, a naik--when the fit was on him, spake prophecies.\nBut the mad all are in God's keeping.  His officers overlooked much in\nthat man.'\n\nThe lama fell back on Urdu, remembering that he was in a strange land.\n'Hear the tale of the Arrow which our Lord loosed from the bow,' he\nsaid.\n\nThis was much more to their taste, and they listened curiously while he\ntold it.  'Now, O people of Hind, I go to seek that River.  Know ye\naught that may guide me, for we be all men and women in evil case.'\n\n'There is Gunga--and Gunga alone--who washes away sin.'  ran the murmur\nround the carriage.\n\n'Though past question we have good Gods Jullundur-way,' said the\ncultivator's wife, looking out of the window.  'See how they have\nblessed the crops.'\n\n'To search every river in the Punjab is no small matter,' said her\nhusband.  'For me, a stream that leaves good silt on my land suffices,\nand I thank Bhumia, the God of the Home-stead.'  He shrugged one\nknotted, bronzed shoulder.\n\n'Think you our Lord came so far North?'  said the lama, turning to Kim.\n\n'It may be,' Kim replied soothingly, as he spat red pan-juice on the\nfloor.\n\n'The last of the Great Ones,' said the Sikh with authority, 'was\nSikander Julkarn [Alexander the Great].  He paved the streets of\nJullundur and built a great tank near Umballa.  That pavement holds to\nthis day; and the tank is there also.  I never heard of thy God.'\n\n'Let thy hair grow long and talk Punjabi,' said the young soldier\njestingly to Kim, quoting a Northern proverb.  'That is all that makes\na Sikh.'  But he did not say this very loud.\n\nThe lama sighed and shrank into himself, a dingy, shapeless mass. In\nthe pauses of their talk they could hear the low droning 'Om mane pudme\nhum!  Om mane pudme hum!'--and the thick click of the wooden rosary\nbeads.\n\n'It irks me,' he said at last.  'The speed and the clatter irk me.\nMoreover, my chela, I think that maybe we have over-passed that River.'\n\n'Peace, peace,' said Kim.  'Was not the River near Benares?  We are yet\nfar from the place.'\n\n'But--if our Lord came North, it may be any one of these little ones\nthat we have run across.'\n\n'I do not know.'\n\n'But thou wast sent to me--wast thou sent to me?--for the merit I had\nacquired over yonder at Such-zen.  From beside the cannon didst thou\ncome--bearing two faces--and two garbs.'\n\n'Peace.  One must not speak of these things here,' whispered Kim.\n'There was but one of me.  Think again and thou wilt remember.  A\nboy--a Hindu boy--by the great green cannon.'\n\n'But was there not also an Englishman with a white beard holy among\nimages--who himself made more sure my assurance of the River of the\nArrow?'\n\n'He--we--went to the Ajaib-Gher in Lahore to pray before the Gods\nthere,' Kim explained to the openly listening company.  'And the Sahib\nof the Wonder House talked to him--yes, this is truth as a brother.  He\nis a very holy man, from far beyond the Hills. Rest, thou.  In time we\ncome to Umballa.'\n\n'But my River--the River of my healing?'\n\n'And then, if it please thee, we will go hunting for that River on\nfoot.  So that we miss nothing--not even a little rivulet in a\nfield-side.'\n\n'But thou hast a Search of thine own?'  The lama--very pleased that he\nremembered so well--sat bolt upright.\n\n'Ay,' said Kim, humouring him.  The boy was entirely happy to be out\nchewing pan and seeing new people in the great good-tempered world.\n\n'It was a bull--a Red Bull that shall come and help thee and carry\nthee--whither?  I have forgotten.  A Red Bull on a green field, was it\nnot?'\n\n'Nay, it will carry me nowhere,' said Kim.  'It is but a tale I told\nthee.'\n\n'What is this?'  The cultivator's wife leaned forward, her bracelets\nclinking on her arm.  'Do ye both dream dreams?  A Red Bull on a green\nfield, that shall carry thee to the heavens or what?  Was it a vision?\nDid one make a prophecy?  We have a Red Bull in our village behind\nJullundur city, and he grazes by choice in the very greenest of our\nfields!'\n\n'Give a woman an old wife's tale and a weaver-bird a leaf and a\nthread', they will weave wonderful things,' said the Sikh.  'All holy\nmen dream dreams, and by following holy men their disciples attain that\npower.'\n\n'A Red Bull on a green field, was it?'  the lama repeated.  'In a\nformer life it may be thou hast acquired merit, and the Bull will come\nto reward thee.'\n\n'Nay--nay--it was but a tale one told to me--for a jest belike.  But I\nwill seek the Bull about Umballa, and thou canst look for thy River and\nrest from the clatter of the train.'\n\n'It may be that the Bull knows--that he is sent to guide us both.'\nsaid the lama, hopefully as a child.  Then to the company, indicating\nKim:  'This one was sent to me but yesterday.  He is not, I think, of\nthis world.'\n\n'Beggars aplenty have I met, and holy men to boot, but never such a\nyogi nor such a disciple,' said the woman.\n\nHer husband touched his forehead lightly with one finger and smiled.\nBut the next time the lama would eat they took care to give him of\ntheir best.\n\nAnd at last--tired, sleepy, and dusty--they reached Umballa City\nStation.\n\n'We abide here upon a law-suit,' said the cultivator's wife to Kim.\n'We lodge with my man's cousin's younger brother.  There is room also\nin the courtyard for thy yogi and for thee.  Will--will he give me a\nblessing?'\n\n'O holy man!  A woman with a heart of gold gives us lodging for the\nnight.  It is a kindly land, this land of the South.  See how we have\nbeen helped since the dawn!'\n\nThe lama bowed his head in benediction.\n\n'To fill my cousin's younger brother's house with wastrels--' the\nhusband began, as he shouldered his heavy bamboo staff.\n\n'Thy cousin's younger brother owes my father's cousin something yet on\nhis daughter's marriage-feast,' said the woman crisply. 'Let him put\ntheir food to that account.  The yogi will beg, I doubt not.'\n\n'Ay, I beg for him,' said Kim, anxious only to get the lama under\nshelter for the night, that he might seek Mahbub Ali's Englishman and\ndeliver himself of the white stallion's pedigree.\n\n'Now,' said he, when the lama had come to an anchor in the inner\ncourtyard of a decent Hindu house behind the cantonments, 'I go away\nfor a while--to--to buy us victual in the bazar.  Do not stray abroad\ntill I return.'\n\n'Thou wilt return?  Thou wilt surely return?'  The old man caught at\nhis wrist.  'And thou wilt return in this very same shape?  Is it too\nlate to look tonight for the River?'\n\n'Too late and too dark.  Be comforted.  Think how far thou art on the\nroad--an hundred miles from Lahore already.'\n\n'Yea--and farther from my monastery.  Alas!  It is a great and terrible\nworld.'\n\nKim stole out and away, as unremarkable a figure as ever carried his\nown and a few score thousand other folk's fate slung round his neck.\nMahbub Ali's directions left him little doubt of the house in which his\nEnglishman lived; and a groom, bringing a dog-cart home from the Club,\nmade him quite sure.  It remained only to identify his man, and Kim\nslipped through the garden hedge and hid in a clump of plumed grass\nclose to the veranda.  The house blazed with lights, and servants moved\nabout tables dressed with flowers, glass, and silver.  Presently forth\ncame an Englishman, dressed in black and white, humming a tune.  It was\ntoo dark to see his face, so Kim, beggar-wise, tried an old experiment.\n\n'Protector of the Poor!'\n\nThe man backed towards the voice.\n\n'Mahbub Ali says--'\n\n'Hah!  What says Mahbub Ali?'  He made no attempt to look for the\nspeaker, and that showed Kim that he knew.\n\n'The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.'\n\n'What proof is there?'  The Englishman switched at the rose-hedge in\nthe side of the drive.\n\n'Mahbub Ali has given me this proof.'  Kim flipped the wad of folded\npaper into the air, and it fell in the path beside the man, who put his\nfoot on it as a gardener came round the corner. When the servant passed\nhe picked it up, dropped a rupee--Kim could hear the clink--and strode\ninto the house, never turning round.  Swiftly Kim took up the money;\nbut for all his training, he was Irish enough by birth to reckon silver\nthe least part of any game.  What he desired was the visible effect of\naction; so, instead of slinking away, he lay close in the grass and\nwormed nearer to the house.\n\nHe saw--Indian bungalows are open through and through--the Englishman\nreturn to a small dressing-room, in a comer of the veranda, that was\nhalf office, littered with papers and despatch-boxes, and sit down to\nstudy Mahbub Ali's message.  His face, by the full ray of the kerosene\nlamp, changed and darkened, and Kim, used as every beggar must be to\nwatching countenances, took good note.\n\n'Will!  Will, dear!'  called a woman's voice.  'You ought to be in the\ndrawing-room.  They'll be here in a minute.'\n\nThe man still read intently.\n\n'Will!'  said the voice, five minutes later.  'He's come.  I can hear\nthe troopers in the drive.'\n\nThe man dashed out bareheaded as a big landau with four native troopers\nbehind it halted at the veranda, and a tall, black haired man, erect as\nan arrow, swung out, preceded by a young officer who laughed pleasantly.\n\nFlat on his belly lay Kim, almost touching the high wheels.  His man\nand the black stranger exchanged two sentences.\n\n'Certainly, sir,' said the young officer promptly.  'Everything waits\nwhile a horse is concerned.'\n\n'We shan't be more than twenty minutes,' said Kim's man.  'You can do\nthe honours--keep 'em amused, and all that.'\n\n'Tell one of the troopers to wait,' said the tall man, and they both\npassed into the dressing-room together as the landau rolled away.  Kim\nsaw their heads bent over Mahbub Ali's message, and heard the\nvoices--one low and deferential, the other sharp and decisive.\n\n'It isn't a question of weeks.  It is a question of days--hours\nalmost,' said the elder.  'I'd been expecting it for some time, but\nthis'--he tapped Mahbub Ali's paper--'clinches it.  Grogan's dining\nhere to-night, isn't he?'\n\n'Yes, sir, and Macklin too.'\n\n'Very good.  I'll speak to them myself.  The matter will be referred to\nthe Council, of course, but this is a case where one is justified in\nassuming that we take action at once.  Warn the Pined and Peshawar\nbrigades.  It will disorganize all the summer reliefs, but we can't\nhelp that.  This comes of not smashing them thoroughly the first time.\nEight thousand should be enough.'\n\n'What about artillery, sir?'\n\n'I must consult Macklin.'\n\n'Then it means war?'\n\n'No.  Punishment.  When a man is bound by the action of his\npredecessor--'\n\n'But C25 may have lied.'\n\n'He bears out the other's information.  Practically, they showed their\nhand six months back.  But Devenish would have it there was a chance of\npeace.  Of course they used it to make themselves stronger.  Send off\nthose telegrams at once--the new code, not the old--mine and Wharton's.\nI don't think we need keep the ladies waiting any longer.  We can\nsettle the rest over the cigars.  I thought it was coming.  It's\npunishment--not war.'\n\nAs the trooper cantered off, Kim crawled round to the back of the\nhouse, where, going on his Lahore experiences, he judged there would be\nfood--and information.  The kitchen was crowded with excited scullions,\none of whom kicked him.\n\n'Aie,' said Kim, feigning tears.  'I came only to wash dishes in return\nfor a bellyful.'\n\n'All Umballa is on the same errand.  Get hence.  They go in now with\nthe soup.  Think you that we who serve Creighton Sahib need strange\nscullions to help us through a big dinner?'\n\n'It is a very big dinner,' said Kim, looking at the plates.\n\n'Small wonder.  The guest of honour is none other than the Jang-i-Lat\nSahib [the Commander-in-Chief].'\n\n'Ho!'  said Kim, with the correct guttural note of wonder.  He had\nlearned what he wanted, and when the scullion turned he was gone.\n\n'And all that trouble,' said he to himself, thinking as usual in\nHindustani, 'for a horse's pedigree!  Mahbub Ali should have come to me\nto learn a little lying.  Every time before that I have borne a message\nit concerned a woman.  Now it is men.  Better.  The tall man said that\nthey will loose a great army to punish someone--somewhere--the news\ngoes to Pindi and Peshawur.  There are also guns.  Would I had crept\nnearer.  It is big news!'\n\nHe returned to find the cultivator's cousin's younger brother\ndiscussing the family law-suit in all its bearings with the cultivator\nand his wife and a few friends, while the lama dozed. After the evening\nmeal some one passed him a water-pipe; and Kim felt very much of a man\nas he pulled at the smooth coconut-shell, his legs spread abroad in the\nmoonlight, his tongue clicking in remarks from time to time.  His hosts\nwere most polite; for the cultivator's wife had told them of his vision\nof the Red Bull, and of his probable descent from another world.\nMoreover, the lama was a great and venerable curiosity.\n\n\nThe family priest, an old, tolerant Sarsut Brahmin, dropped in later,\nand naturally started a theological argument to impress the family.  By\ncreed, of course, they were all on their priest's side, but the lama\nwas the guest and the novelty.  His gentle kindliness, and his\nimpressive Chinese quotations, that sounded like spells, delighted them\nhugely; and in this sympathetic, simple air, he expanded like the\nBodhisat's own lotus, speaking of his life in the great hills of\nSuch-zen, before, as he said, 'I rose up to seek enlightenment.'\n\nThen it came out that in those worldly days he had been a master-hand\nat casting horoscopes and nativities; and the family priest led him on\nto describe his methods; each giving the planets names that the other\ncould not understand, and pointing upwards as the big stars sailed\nacross the dark.  The children of the house tugged unrebuked at his\nrosary; and he clean forgot the Rule which forbids looking at women as\nhe talked of enduring snows, landslips, blocked passes, the remote\ncliffs where men find sapphires and turquoise, and that wonderful\nupland road that leads at last into Great China itself.\n\n'How thinkest thou of this one?'  said the cultivator aside to the\npriest.\n\n'A holy man--a holy man indeed.  His Gods are not the Gods, but his\nfeet are upon the Way,' was the answer.  'And his methods of\nnativities, though that is beyond thee, are wise and sure.'\n\n'Tell me,' said Kim lazily, 'whether I find my Red Bull on a green\nfield, as was promised me.'\n\n'What knowledge hast thou of thy birth-hour?'  the priest asked,\nswelling with importance.\n\n'Between first and second cockcrow of the first night in May.'\n\n'Of what year?'\n\n'I do not know; but upon the hour that I cried first fell the great\nearthquake in Srinagar which is in Kashmir.'  This Kim had from the\nwoman who took care of him, and she again from Kimball O'Hara.  The\nearthquake had been felt in India, and for long stood a leading date in\nthe Punjab.\n\n'Ai!' said a woman excitedly.  This seemed to make Kim's supernatural\norigin more certain.  'Was not such an one's daughter born then--'\n\n'And her mother bore her husband four sons in four years all likely\nboys,' cried the cultivator's wife, sitting outside the circle in the\nshadow.\n\n'None reared in the knowledge,' said the family priest, 'forget how the\nplanets stood in their Houses upon that night.'  He began to draw in\nthe dust of the courtyard.  'At least thou hast good claim to a half of\nthe House of the Bull.  How runs thy prophecy?'\n\n'Upon a day,' said Kim, delighted at the sensation he was creating, 'I\nshall be made great by means of a Red Bull on a green field, but first\nthere will enter two men making all things ready.'\n\n'Yes:  thus ever at the opening of a vision.  A thick darkness that\nclears slowly; anon one enters with a broom making ready the place.\nThen begins the Sight.  Two men--thou sayest?  Ay, ay.  The Sun,\nleaving the House of the Bull, enters that of the Twins. Hence the two\nmen of the prophecy.  Let us now consider.  Fetch me a twig, little\none.'\n\nHe knitted his brows, scratched, smoothed out, and scratched again in\nthe dust mysterious signs--to the wonder of all save the lama, who,\nwith fine instinct, forbore to interfere.\n\nAt the end of half an hour, he tossed the twig from him with a grunt.\n\n'Hm!  Thus say the stars.  Within three days come the two men to make\nall things ready.  After them follows the Bull; but the sign over\nagainst him is the sign of War and armed men.'\n\n'There was indeed a man of the Ludhiana Sikhs in the carriage from\nLahore,' said the cultivator's wife hopefully.\n\n'Tck!  Armed men--many hundreds.  What concern hast thou with war?'\nsaid the priest to Kim.  'Thine is a red and an angry sign of War to be\nloosed very soon.'\n\n'None--none.'  said the lama earnestly.  'We seek only peace and our\nRiver.'\n\nKim smiled, remembering what he had overheard in the dressing-room.\nDecidedly he was a favourite of the stars.\n\nThe priest brushed his foot over the rude horoscope.  'More than this I\ncannot see.  In three days comes the Bull to thee, boy.'\n\n'And my River, my River,' pleaded the lama.  'I had hoped his Bull\nwould lead us both to the River.'\n\n'Alas, for that wondrous River, my brother,' the priest replied. 'Such\nthings are not common.'\n\nNext morning, though they were pressed to stay, the lama insisted on\ndeparture.  They gave Kim a large bundle of good food and nearly three\nannas in copper money for the needs of the road, and with many\nblessings watched the two go southward in the dawn.\n\n'Pity it is that these and such as these could not be freed from--'\n\n'Nay, then would only evil people be left on the earth, and who would\ngive us meat and shelter?'  quoth Kim, stepping merrily under his\nburden.\n\n'Yonder is a small stream.  Let us look,' said the lama, and he led\nfrom the white road across the fields; walking into a very hornets'\nnest of pariah dogs.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\n  Yea, voice of every Soul that clung\n  To life that strove from rung to rung\n  When Devadatta's rule was young,\n  The warm wind brings Kamakura.\n\n  Buddha at Kamakura.\n\n\nBehind them an angry farmer brandished a bamboo pole.  He was a\nmarket-gardener, Arain by caste, growing vegetables and flowers for\nUmballa city, and well Kim knew the breed.\n\n'Such an one,' said the lama, disregarding the dogs, 'is impolite to\nstrangers, intemperate of speech and uncharitable.  Be warned by his\ndemeanour, my disciple.'\n\n'Ho, shameless beggars!'  shouted the farmer.  'Begone!  Get hence!'\n\n'We go,' the lama returned, with quiet dignity.  'We go from these\nunblessed fields.'\n\n'Ah,' said Kim, sucking in his breath.  'If the next crops fail, thou\ncanst only blame thine own tongue.'\n\nThe man shuffled uneasily in his slippers.  'The land is full of\nbeggars,' he began, half apologetically.\n\n'And by what sign didst thou know that we would beg from thee, O Mali?'\nsaid Kim tartly, using the name that a market-gardener least likes.\n'All we sought was to look at that river beyond the field there.'\n\n'River, forsooth!'  the man snorted.  'What city do ye hail from not to\nknow a canal-cut?  It runs as straight as an arrow, and I pay for the\nwater as though it were molten silver.  There is a branch of a river\nbeyond.  But if ye need water I can give that--and milk.'\n\n'Nay, we will go to the river,' said the lama, striding out.\n\n'Milk and a meal.'  the man stammered, as he looked at the strange tall\nfigure.  'I--I would not draw evil upon myself--or my crops.  But\nbeggars are so many in these hard days.'\n\n'Take notice.'  The lama turned to Kim.  'He was led to speak harshly\nby the Red Mist of anger.  That clearing from his eyes, he becomes\ncourteous and of an affable heart.  May his fields be blessed!  Beware\nnot to judge men too hastily, O farmer.'\n\n'I have met holy ones who would have cursed thee from hearthstone to\nbyre,' said Kim to the abashed man.  'Is he not wise and holy? I am his\ndisciple.'\n\nHe cocked his nose in the air loftily and stepped across the narrow\nfield-borders with great dignity.\n\n'There is no pride,' said the lama, after a pause, 'there is no pride\namong such as follow the Middle Way.'\n\n'But thou hast said he was low-caste and discourteous.'\n\n'Low-caste I did not say, for how can that be which is not? Afterwards\nhe amended his discourtesy, and I forgot the offence. Moreover, he is\nas we are, bound upon the Wheel of Things; but he does not tread the\nway of deliverance.'  He halted at a little runlet among the fields,\nand considered the hoof-pitted bank.\n\n'Now, how wilt thou know thy River?'  said Kim, squatting in the shade\nof some tall sugar-cane.\n\n'When I find it, an enlightenment will surely be given.  This, I feel,\nis not the place.  O littlest among the waters, if only thou couldst\ntell me where runs my River!  But be thou blessed to make the fields\nbear!'\n\n'Look!  Look!'  Kim sprang to his side and dragged him back.  A\nyellow-and-brown streak glided from the purple rustling stems to the\nbank, stretched its neck to the water, drank, and lay still--a big\ncobra with fixed, lidless eyes.\n\n'I have no stick--I have no stick,' said Kim.  'I will get me one and\nbreak his back.'\n\n'Why?  He is upon the Wheel as we are--a life ascending or\ndescending--very far from deliverance.  Great evil must the soul have\ndone that is cast into this shape.'\n\n'I hate all snakes,' said Kim.  No native training can quench the white\nman's horror of the Serpent.\n\n'Let him live out his life.'  The coiled thing hissed and half opened\nits hood.  'May thy release come soon, brother!'  the lama continued\nplacidly.  'Hast thou knowledge, by chance, of my River?'\n\n'Never have I seen such a man as thou art,' Kim whispered, overwhelmed.\n'Do the very snakes understand thy talk?'\n\n'Who knows?'  He passed within a foot of the cobra's poised head. It\nflattened itself among the dusty coils.\n\n'Come, thou!'  he called over his shoulder.\n\n'Not I,' said Kim'.  'I go round.'\n\n'Come.  He does no hurt.'\n\nKim hesitated for a moment.  The lama backed his order by some droned\nChinese quotation which Kim took for a charm.  He obeyed and bounded\nacross the rivulet, and the snake, indeed, made no sign.\n\n'Never have I seen such a man.'  Kim wiped the sweat from his forehead.\n'And now, whither go we?'\n\n'That is for thee to say.  I am old, and a stranger--far from my own\nplace.  But that the rail-carriage fills my head with noises of\ndevil-drums I would go in it to Benares now ...  Yet by so going we may\nmiss the River.  Let us find another river.'\n\nWhere the hard-worked soil gives three and even four crops a year\nthrough patches of sugar-cane, tobacco, long white radishes, and\nnol-kol, all that day they strolled on, turning aside to every glimpse\nof water; rousing village dogs and sleeping villages at noonday; the\nlama replying to the volleyed questions with an unswerving simplicity.\nThey sought a River:  a River of miraculous healing.  Had any one\nknowledge of such a stream?\n\nSometimes men laughed, but more often heard the story out to the end\nand offered them a place in the shade, a drink of milk, and a meal.\nThe women were always kind, and the little children as children are the\nworld over, alternately shy and venturesome.\n\nEvening found them at rest under the village tree of a mud-walled,\nmud-roofed hamlet, talking to the headman as the cattle came in from\nthe grazing-grounds and the women prepared the day's last meal.  They\nhad passed beyond the belt of market-gardens round hungry Umballa, and\nwere among the mile-wide green of the staple crops.\n\nHe was a white-bearded and affable elder, used to entertaining\nstrangers.  He dragged out a string bedstead for the lama, set warm\ncooked food before him, prepared him a pipe, and, the evening\nceremonies being finished in the village temple, sent for the village\npriest.\n\nKim told the older children tales of the size and beauty of Lahore, of\nrailway travel, and such-like city things, while the men talked, slowly\nas their cattle chew the cud.\n\n'I cannot fathom it,' said the headman at last to the priest. 'How\nreadest thou this talk?'  The lama, his tale told, was silently telling\nhis beads.\n\n'He is a Seeker.'  the priest answered.  'The land is full of such.\nRemember him who came only last, month--the fakir with the tortoise?'\n\n'Ay, but that man had right and reason, for Krishna Himself appeared in\na vision promising him Paradise without the burning-pyre if he\njourneyed to Prayag.  This man seeks no God who is within my knowledge.'\n\n'Peace, he is old:  he comes from far off, and he is mad,' the\nsmooth-shaven priest replied.  'Hear me.'  He turned to the lama.\n'Three koss [six miles] to the westward runs the great road to\nCalcutta.'\n\n'But I would go to Benares--to Benares.'\n\n'And to Benares also.  It crosses all streams on this side of Hind.\nNow my word to thee, Holy One, is rest here till tomorrow. Then take\nthe road' (it was the Grand Trunk Road he meant) 'and test each stream\nthat it overpasses; for, as I understand, the virtue of thy River lies\nneither in one pool nor place, but throughout its length.  Then, if thy\nGods will, be assured that thou wilt come upon thy freedom.'\n\n'That is well said.'  The lama was much impressed by the plan.  'We\nwill begin tomorrow, and a blessing on thee for showing old feet such a\nnear road.'  A deep, sing-song Chinese half-chant closed the sentence.\nEven the priest was impressed, and the headman feared an evil spell:\nbut none could look at the lama's simple, eager face and doubt him long.\n\n'Seest thou my chela?'  he said, diving into his snuff-gourd with an\nimportant sniff.  It was his duty to repay courtesy with courtesy.\n\n'I see--and hear.'  The headman rolled his eye where Kim was chatting\nto a girl in blue as she laid crackling thorns on a fire.\n\n'He also has a Search of his own.  No river, but a Bull.  Yea, a Red\nBull on a green field will some day raise him to honour.  He is, I\nthink, not altogether of this world.  He was sent of a sudden to aid me\nin this search, and his name is Friend of all the World.'\n\nThe priest smiled.  'Ho, there, Friend of all the World,' he cried\nacross the sharp-smelling smoke, 'what art thou?'\n\n'This Holy One's disciple,' said Kim.\n\n'He says thou are a but [a spirit].'\n\n'Can buts eat?'  said Kim, with a twinkle.  'For I am hungry.'\n\n'It is no jest,' cried the lama.  'A certain astrologer of that city\nwhose name I have forgotten--'\n\n'That is no more than the city of Umballa where we slept last night,'\nKim whispered to the priest.\n\n'Ay, Umballa was it?  He cast a horoscope and declared that my chela\nshould find his desire within two days.  But what said he of the\nmeaning of the stars, Friend of all the World?'\n\nKim cleared his throat and looked around at the village greybeards.\n\n'The meaning of my Star is War,' he replied pompously.\n\nSomebody laughed at the little tattered figure strutting on the\nbrickwork plinth under the great tree.  Where a native would have lain\ndown, Kim's white blood set him upon his feet.\n\n'Ay, War,' he answered.\n\n'That is a sure prophecy,' rumbled a deep voice.  'For there is always\nwar along the Border--as I know.'\n\nIt was an old, withered man, who had served the Government in the days\nof the Mutiny as a native officer in a newly raised cavalry regiment.\nThe Government had given him a good holding in the village, and though\nthe demands of his sons, now grey-bearded officers on their own\naccount, had impoverished him, he was still a person of consequence.\nEnglish officials--Deputy Commissioners even--turned aside from the\nmain road to visit him, and on those occasions he dressed himself in\nthe uniform of ancient days, and stood up like a ramrod.\n\n'But this shall be a great war--a war of eight thousand.'  Kim's voice\nshrilled across the quick-gathering crowd, astonishing himself.\n\n'Redcoats or our own regiments?'  the old man snapped, as though he\nwere asking an equal.  His tone made men respect Kim.\n\n'Redcoats,' said Kim at a venture.  'Redcoats and guns.'\n\n'But--but the astrologer said no word of this,' cried the lama,\nsnuffing prodigiously in his excitement.\n\n'But I know.  The word has come to me, who am this Holy One's disciple.\nThere will rise a war--a war of eight thousand redcoats. From Pindi and\nPeshawur they will be drawn.  This is sure.'\n\n'The boy has heard bazar-talk,' said the priest.\n\n'But he was always by my side,' said the lama.  'How should he know? I\ndid not know.'\n\n'He will make a clever juggler when the old man is dead,' muttered the\npriest to the headman.  'What new trick is this?'\n\n'A sign.  Give me a sign,' thundered the old soldier suddenly.  'If\nthere were war my sons would have told me.'\n\n'When all is ready, thy sons, doubt not, will be told.  But it is a\nlong road from thy sons to the man in whose hands these things lie.'\nKim warmed to the game, for it reminded him of experiences in the\nletter-carrying line, when, for the sake of a few pice, he pretended to\nknow more than he knew.  But now he was playing for larger things--the\nsheer excitement and the sense of power.  He drew a new breath and went\non.\n\n'Old man, give me a sign.  Do underlings order the goings of eight\nthousand redcoats--with guns?'\n\n'No.'  Still the old man answered as though Kim were an equal.\n\n'Dost thou know who He is, then, that gives the order?'\n\n'I have seen Him.'\n\n'To know again?'\n\n'I have known Him since he was a lieutenant in the topkhana (the\nArtillery).'\n\n'A tall man.  A tall man with black hair, walking thus?'  Kim took a\nfew paces in a stiff, wooden style.\n\n'Ay.  But that anyone may have seen.'  The crowd were breathless--still\nthrough all this talk.\n\n'That is true,' said Kim.  'But I will say more.  Look now.  First the\ngreat man walks thus.  Then He thinks thus.'  (Kim drew a forefinger\nover his forehead and downwards till it came to rest by the angle of\nthe jaw.) 'Anon He twitches his fingers thus. Anon He thrusts his hat\nunder his left armpit.'  Kim illustrated the motion and stood like a\nstork.\n\nThe old man groaned, inarticulate with amazement; and the crowd\nshivered.\n\n'So--so--so.  But what does He when He is about to give an order?'\n\n'He rubs the skin at the back of his neck--thus.  Then falls one finger\non the table and He makes a small sniffing noise through his nose.\nThen He speaks, saying:  \"Loose such and such a regiment. Call out such\nguns.\"'\n\nThe old man rose stiffly and saluted.\n\n'\"For\"'--Kim translated into the vernacular the clinching sentences he\nhad heard in the dressing-room at Umballa--'\"For,\" says He, \"we should\nhave done this long ago.  It is not war--it is a chastisement.  Snff!\"'\n\n'Enough.  I believe.  I have seen Him thus in the smoke of battles.\nSeen and heard.  It is He!'\n\n'I saw no smoke'--Kim's voice shifted to the rapt sing-song of the\nwayside fortune-teller.  'I saw this in darkness.  First came a man to\nmake things clear.  Then came horsemen.  Then came He standing in a\nring of light.  The rest followed as I have said.  Old man, have I\nspoken truth?'\n\n'It is He.  Past all doubt it is He.'\n\nThe crowd drew a long, quavering breath, staring alternately at the old\nman, still at attention, and ragged Kim against the purple twilight.\n\n'Said I not--said I not he was from the other world?'  cried the lama\nproudly.  'He is the Friend of all the World.  He is the Friend of the\nStars!'\n\n'At least it does not concern us,' a man cried.  'O thou young\nsoothsayer, if the gift abides with thee at all seasons, I have a\nred-spotted cow.  She may be sister to thy Bull for aught I know--'\n\n'Or I care,' said Kim.  'My Stars do not concern themselves with thy\ncattle.'\n\n'Nay, but she is very sick,' a woman struck in.  'My man is a buffalo,\nor he would have chosen his words better.  Tell me if she recover?'\n\nHad Kim been at all an ordinary boy, he would have carried on the play;\nbut one does not know Lahore city, and least of all the fakirs by the\nTaksali Gate, for thirteen years without also knowing human nature.\n\nThe priest looked at him sideways, something bitterly--a dry and\nblighting smile.\n\n'Is there no priest, then, in the village?  I thought I had seen a\ngreat one even now,' cried Kim.\n\n'Ay--but--' the woman began.\n\n'But thou and thy husband hoped to get the cow cured for a handful of\nthanks.'  The shot told:  they were notoriously the closest-fisted\ncouple in the village.  'It is not well to cheat the temples.  Give a\nyoung calf to thine own priest, and, unless thy Gods are angry past\nrecall, she will give milk within a month.'\n\n'A master-beggar art thou,' purred the priest approvingly.  'Not the\ncunning of forty years could have done better.  Surely thou hast made\nthe old man rich?'\n\n'A little flour, a little butter and a mouthful of cardamoms,' Kim\nretorted, flushed with the praise, but still cautious--'Does one grow\nrich on that?  And, as thou canst see, he is mad.  But it serves me\nwhile I learn the road at least.'\n\nHe knew what the fakirs of the Taksali Gate were like when they talked\namong themselves, and copied the very inflection of their lewd\ndisciples.\n\n'Is his Search, then, truth or a cloak to other ends?  It may be\ntreasure.'\n\n'He is mad--many times mad.  There is nothing else.'\n\nHere the old soldier bobbled up and asked if Kim would accept his\nhospitality for the night.  The priest recommended him to do so, but\ninsisted that the honour of entertaining the lama belonged to the\ntemple--at which the lama smiled guilelessly.  Kim glanced from one\nface to the other, and drew his own conclusions.\n\n'Where is the money?'  he whispered, beckoning the old man off into the\ndarkness.\n\n'In my bosom.  Where else?'\n\n'Give it me.  Quietly and swiftly give it me.'\n\n'But why?  Here is no ticket to buy.'\n\n'Am I thy chela, or am I not?  Do I not safeguard thy old feet about\nthe ways?  Give me the money and at dawn I will return it.'  He slipped\nhis hand above the lama's girdle and brought away the purse.\n\n'Be it so--be it so.'  The old man nodded his head.  'This is a great\nand terrible world.  I never knew there were so many men alive in it.'\n\nNext morning the priest was in a very bad temper, but the lama was\nquite happy; and Kim had enjoyed a most interesting evening with the\nold man, who brought out his cavalry sabre and, balancing it on his dry\nknees, told tales of the Mutiny and young captains thirty years in\ntheir graves, till Kim dropped off to sleep.\n\n'Certainly the air of this country is good,' said the lama.  'I sleep\nlightly, as do all old men; but last night I slept unwaking till broad\nday.  Even now I am heavy.'\n\n'Drink a draught of hot milk,' said Kim, who had carried not a few such\nremedies to opium-smokers of his acquaintance.  'It is time to take the\nRoad again.'\n\n'The long Road that overpasses all the rivers of Hind,' said the lama\ngaily.  'Let us go.  But how thinkest thou, chela, to recompense these\npeople, and especially the priest, for their great kindness? Truly they\nare but parast, but in other lives, maybe, they will receive\nenlightenment.  A rupee to the temple?  The thing within is no more\nthan stone and red paint, but the heart of man we must acknowledge when\nand where it is good.'\n\n'Holy One, hast thou ever taken the Road alone?'  Kim looked up\nsharply, like the Indian crows so busy about the fields.\n\n'Surely, child:  from Kulu to Pathankot--from Kulu, where my first\nchela died.  When men were kind to us we made offerings, and all men\nwere well-disposed throughout all the Hills.'\n\n'It is otherwise in Hind,' said Kim drily.  'Their Gods are many-armed\nand malignant.  Let them alone.'\n\n'I would set thee on thy road for a little, Friend of all the World,\nthou and thy yellow man.'  The old soldier ambled up the village\nstreet, all shadowy in the dawn, on a punt, scissor-hocked pony. 'Last\nnight broke up the fountains of remembrance in my so-dried heart, and\nit was as a blessing to me.  Truly there is war abroad in the air.  I\nsmell it.  See!  I have brought my sword.'\n\nHe sat long-legged on the little beast, with the big sword at his\nside--hand dropped on the pommel--staring fiercely over the flat lands\ntowards the North.  'Tell me again how He showed in thy vision.  Come\nup and sit behind me.  The beast will carry two.'\n\n'I am this Holy One's disciple,' said Kim, as they cleared the\nvillage-gate.  The villagers seemed almost sorry to be rid of them, but\nthe priest's farewell was cold and distant.  He had wasted some opium\non a man who carried no money.\n\n'That is well spoken.  I am not much used to holy men, but respect is\nalways good.  There is no respect in these days--not even when a\nCommissioner Sahib comes to see me.  But why should one whose Star\nleads him to war follow a holy man?'\n\n'But he is a holy man,' said Kim earnestly.  'In truth, and in talk and\nin act, holy.  He is not like the others.  I have never seen such an\none.  We be not fortune-tellers, or jugglers, or beggars.'\n\n'Thou art not.  That I can see.  But I do not know that other.  He\nmarches well, though.'\n\nThe first freshness of the day carried the lama forward with long,\neasy, camel-like strides.  He was deep in meditation, mechanically\nclicking his rosary.\n\nThey followed the rutted and worn country road that wound across the\nflat between the great dark-green mango-groves, the line of the\nsnowcapped Himalayas faint to the eastward.  All India was at work in\nthe fields, to the creaking of well-wheels, the shouting of ploughmen\nbehind their cattle, and the clamour of the crows.  Even the pony felt\nthe good influence and almost broke into a trot as Kim laid a hand on\nthe stirrup-leather.\n\n'It repents me that I did not give a rupee to the shrine,' said the\nlama on the last bead of his eighty-one.\n\nThe old soldier growled in his beard, so that the lama for the first\ntime was aware of him.\n\n'Seekest thou the River also?'  said he, turning.\n\n'The day is new,' was the reply.  'What need of a river save to water\nat before sundown?  I come to show thee a short lane to the Big Road.'\n\n'That is a courtesy to be remembered, O man of good will.  But why the\nsword?'\n\nThe old soldier looked as abashed as a child interrupted in his game of\nmake-believe.\n\n'The sword,' he said, fumbling it.  'Oh, that was a fancy of mine an\nold man's fancy.  Truly the police orders are that no man must bear\nweapons throughout Hind, but'--he cheered up and slapped the hilt--'all\nthe constabeels hereabout know me.'\n\n'It is not a good fancy,' said the lama.  'What profit to kill men?'\n\n'Very little--as I know; but if evil men were not now and then slain it\nwould not be a good world for weaponless dreamers.  I do not speak\nwithout knowledge who have seen the land from Delhi south awash with\nblood.'\n\n'What madness was that, then?'\n\n'The Gods, who sent it for a plague, alone know.  A madness ate into\nall the Army, and they turned against their officers.  That was the\nfirst evil, but not past remedy if they had then held their hands.  But\nthey chose to kill the Sahibs' wives and children.  Then came the\nSahibs from over the sea and called them to most strict account.'\n\n'Some such rumour, I believe, reached me once long ago.  They called it\nthe Black Year, as I remember.'\n\n'What manner of life hast thou led, not to know The Year?  A rumour\nindeed!  All earth knew, and trembled!'\n\n'Our earth never shook but once--upon the day that the Excellent One\nreceived Enlightenment.'\n\n'Umph!  I saw Delhi shake at least--and Delhi is the navel of the\nworld.'\n\n'So they turned against women and children?  That was a bad deed, for\nwhich the punishment cannot be avoided.'\n\n'Many strove to do so, but with very small profit.  I was then in a\nregiment of cavalry.  It broke.  Of six hundred and eighty sabres stood\nfast to their salt--how many, think you?  Three.  Of whom I was one.'\n\n'The greater merit.'\n\n'Merit!  We did not consider it merit in those days.  My people, my\nfriends, my brothers fell from me.  They said:  \"The time of the\nEnglish is accomplished.  Let each strike out a little holding for\nhimself.\"  But I had talked with the men of Sobraon, of Chilianwallah,\nof Moodkee and Ferozeshah.  I said:  \"Abide a little and the wind\nturns.  There is no blessing in this work.\"  In those days I rode\nseventy miles with an English Memsahib and her babe on my saddle-bow.\n(Wow!  That was a horse fit for a man!) I placed them in safety, and\nback came I to my officer--the one that was not killed of our five.\n\"Give me work,\" said I, \"for I am an outcast among my own kind, and my\ncousin's blood is wet on my sabre.\"  \"Be content,\" said he.  \"There is\ngreat work forward.  When this madness is over there is a recompense.\"'\n\n'Ay, there is a recompense when the madness is over, surely?'  the lama\nmuttered half to himself.\n\n'They did not hang medals in those days on all who by accident had\nheard a gun fired.  No!  In nineteen pitched battles was I; in\nsix-and-forty skirmishes of horse; and in small affairs without number.\nNine wounds I bear; a medal and four clasps and the medal of an Order,\nfor my captains, who are now generals, remembered me when the\nKaisar-i-Hind had accomplished fifty years of her reign, and all the\nland rejoiced.  They said:  \"Give him the Order of Berittish India.\"  I\ncarry it upon my neck now.  I have also my jaghir [holding] from the\nhands of the State--a free gift to me and mine. The men of the old\ndays--they are now Commissioners--come riding to me through the\ncrops--high upon horses so that all the village sees--and we talk out\nthe old skirmishes, one dead man's name leading to another.'\n\n'And after?'  said the lama.\n\n'Oh, afterwards they go away, but not before my village has seen.'\n\n'And at the last what wilt thou do?'\n\n'At the last I shall die.'\n\n'And after?'\n\n'Let the Gods order it.  I have never pestered Them with prayers. I do\nnot think They will pester me.  Look you, I have noticed in my long\nlife that those who eternally break in upon Those Above with complaints\nand reports and bellowings and weepings are presently sent for in\nhaste, as our Colonel used to send for slack-jawed down-country men who\ntalked too much.  No, I have never wearied the Gods.  They will\nremember this, and give me a quiet place where I can drive my lance in\nthe shade, and wait to welcome my sons:  I have no less than three\nRissaldar--majors all--in the regiments.'\n\n'And they likewise, bound upon the Wheel, go forth from life to\nlife--from despair to despair,' said the lama below his breath, 'hot,\nuneasy, snatching.'\n\n'Ay,' the old soldier chuckled.  'Three Rissaldar--majors in three\nregiments.  Gamblers a little, but so am I. They must be well mounted;\nand one cannot take the horses as in the old days one took women.\nWell, well, my holding can pay for all.  How thinkest thou? It is a\nwell-watered strip, but my men cheat me.  I do not know how to ask save\nat the lance's point.  Ugh!  I grow angry and I curse them, and they\nfeign penitence, but behind my back I know they call me a toothless old\nape.'\n\n'Hast thou never desired any other thing?'\n\n'Yes--yes--a thousand times!  A straight back and a close-clinging knee\nonce more; a quick wrist and a keen eye; and the marrow that makes a\nman.  Oh, the old days--the good days of my strength!'\n\n'That strength is weakness.'\n\n'It has turned so; but fifty years since I could have proved it\notherwise,' the old soldier retorted, driving his stirrup-edge into the\npony's lean flank.\n\n'But I know a River of great healing.'\n\n'I have drank Gunga-water to the edge of dropsy.  All she gave me was a\nflux, and no sort of strength.'\n\n'It is not Gunga.  The River that I know washes from all taint of sin.\nAscending the far bank one is assured of Freedom.  I do not know thy\nlife, but thy face is the face of the honourable and courteous.  Thou\nhast clung to thy Way, rendering fidelity when it was hard to give, in\nthat Black Year of which I now remember other tales.  Enter now upon\nthe Middle Way which is the path to Freedom.  Hear the Most Excellent\nLaw, and do not follow dreams.'\n\n'Speak, then, old man,' the soldier smiled, half saluting.  'We be all\nbabblers at our age.'\n\nThe lama squatted under the shade of a mango, whose shadow played\ncheckerwise over his face; the soldier sat stiffly on the pony; and\nKim, making sure that there were no snakes, lay down in the crotch of\nthe twisted roots.\n\nThere was a drowsy buzz of small life in hot sunshine, a cooing of\ndoves, and a sleepy drone of well-wheels across the fields. Slowly and\nimpressively the lama began.  At the end of ten minutes the old soldier\nslid from his pony, to hear better as he said, and sat with the reins\nround his wrist.  The lama's voice faltered, the periods lengthened.\nKim was busy watching a grey squirrel. When the little scolding bunch\nof fur, close pressed to the branch, disappeared, preacher and audience\nwere fast asleep, the old officer's strong-cut head pillowed on his\narm, the lama's thrown back against the tree-bole, where it showed like\nyellow ivory.  A naked child toddled up, stared, and, moved by some\nquick impulse of reverence, made a solemn little obeisance before the\nlama--only the child was so short and fat that it toppled over\nsideways, and Kim laughed at the sprawling, chubby legs.  The child,\nscared and indignant, yelled aloud.\n\n'Hai!  Hai!'  said the soldier, leaping to his feet.  'What is it? What\norders?  ...  It is ...  a child!  I dreamed it was an alarm. Little\none--little one--do not cry.  Have I slept?  That was discourteous\nindeed!'\n\n'I fear!  I am afraid!'  roared the child.\n\n'What is it to fear?  Two old men and a boy?  How wilt thou ever make a\nsoldier, Princeling?'\n\nThe lama had waked too, but, taking no direct notice of the child,\nclicked his rosary.\n\n'What is that?'  said the child, stopping a yell midway.  'I have never\nseen such things.  Give them me.'\n\n'Aha.'  said the lama, smiling, and trailing a loop of it on the grass:\n\nThis is a handful of cardamoms, This is a lump of ghi: This is millet\nand chillies and rice, A supper for thee and me!\n\nThe child shrieked with joy, and snatched at the dark, glancing beads.\n\n'Oho!'  said the old soldier.  'Whence hadst thou that song, despiser\nof this world?'\n\n'I learned it in Pathankot--sitting on a doorstep,' said the lama\nshyly.  'It is good to be kind to babes.'\n\n'As I remember, before the sleep came on us, thou hadst told me that\nmarriage and bearing were darkeners of the true light, stumbling-blocks\nupon the Way.  Do children drop from Heaven in thy country?  Is it the\nWay to sing them songs?'\n\n'No man is all perfect,' said the lama gravely, recoiling the rosary.\n'Run now to thy mother, little one.'\n\n'Hear him!'  said the soldier to Kim.  'He is ashamed for that he has\nmade a child happy.  There was a very good householder lost in thee, my\nbrother.  Hai, child!'  He threw it a pice.  'Sweetmeats are always\nsweet.'  And as the little figure capered away into the sunshine: 'They\ngrow up and become men.  Holy One, I grieve that I slept in the midst\nof thy preaching.  Forgive me.'\n\n'We be two old men,' said the lama.  'The fault is mine.  I listened to\nthy talk of the world and its madness, and one fault led to the next.'\n\n'Hear him!  What harm do thy Gods suffer from play with a babe?  And\nthat song was very well sung.  Let us go on and I will sing thee the\nsong of Nikal Seyn before Delhi--the old song.'\n\nAnd they fared out from the gloom of the mango tope, the old man's\nhigh, shrill voice ringing across the field, as wail by long-drawn wail\nhe unfolded the story of Nikal Seyn [Nicholson]--the song that men sing\nin the Punjab to this day.  Kim was delighted, and the lama listened\nwith deep interest.\n\n'Ahi!  Nikal Seyn is dead--he died before Delhi!  Lances of the North,\ntake vengeance for Nikal Seyn.'  He quavered it out to the end, marking\nthe trills with the flat of his sword on the pony's rump.\n\n'And now we come to the Big Road,' said he, after receiving the\ncompliments of Kim; for the lama was markedly silent.  'It is long\nsince I have ridden this way, but thy boy's talk stirred me.  See, Holy\nOne--the Great Road which is the backbone of all Hind.  For the most\npart it is shaded, as here, with four lines of trees; the middle\nroad--all hard--takes the quick traffic.  In the days before\nrail-carriages the Sahibs travelled up and down here in hundreds. Now\nthere are only country-carts and such like.  Left and right is the\nrougher road for the heavy carts--grain and cotton and timber, fodder,\nlime and hides.  A man goes in safety here for at every few koss is a\npolice-station.  The police are thieves and extortioners (I myself\nwould patrol it with cavalry--young recruits under a strong captain),\nbut at least they do not suffer any rivals.  All castes and kinds of\nmen move here.\n\n'Look!  Brahmins and chumars, bankers and tinkers, barbers and bunnias,\npilgrims and potters--all the world going and coming.  It is to me as a\nriver from which I am withdrawn like a log after a flood.'\n\nAnd truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle.  It runs\nstraight, bearing without crowding India's traffic for fifteen hundred\nmiles--such a river of life as nowhere else exists in the world.  They\nlooked at the green-arched, shade-flecked length of it, the white\nbreadth speckled with slow-pacing folk; and the two-roomed\npolice-station opposite.\n\n'Who bears arms against the law?'  a constable called out laughingly,\nas he caught sight of the soldier's sword.  'Are not the police enough\nto destroy evil-doers?'\n\n'It was because of the police I bought it,' was the answer.  'Does all\ngo well in Hind?'\n\n'Rissaldar Sahib, all goes well.'\n\n'I am like an old tortoise, look you, who puts his head out from the\nbank and draws it in again.  Ay, this is the Road of Hindustan. All men\ncome by this way...'\n\n'Son of a swine, is the soft part of the road meant for thee to scratch\nthy back upon?  Father of all the daughters of shame and husband of ten\nthousand virtueless ones, thy mother was devoted to a devil, being led\nthereto by her mother.  Thy aunts have never had a nose for seven\ngenerations!  Thy sister--What Owl's folly told thee to draw thy carts\nacross the road?  A broken wheel?  Then take a broken head and put the\ntwo together at leisure!'\n\nThe voice and a venomous whip-cracking came out of a pillar of dust\nfifty yards away, where a cart had broken down.  A thin, high Kathiawar\nmare, with eyes and nostrils aflame, rocketed out of the jam, snorting\nand wincing as her rider bent her across the road in chase of a\nshouting man.  He was tall and grey-bearded, sitting the almost mad\nbeast as a piece of her, and scientifically lashing his victim between\nplunges.\n\nThe old man's face lit with pride.  'My child!'  said he briefly, and\nstrove to rein the pony's neck to a fitting arch.\n\n'Am I to be beaten before the police?'  cried the carter.  'Justice! I\nwill have Justice--'\n\n'Am I to be blocked by a shouting ape who upsets ten thousand sacks\nunder a young horse's nose?  That is the way to ruin a mare.'\n\n'He speaks truth.  He speaks truth.  But she follows her man close,'\nsaid the old man.  The carter ran under the wheels of his cart and\nthence threatened all sorts of vengeance.\n\n'They are strong men, thy sons,' said the policeman serenely, picking\nhis teeth.\n\nThe horseman delivered one last vicious cut with his whip and came on\nat a canter.\n\n'My father!'  He reigned back ten yards and dismounted.\n\nThe old man was off his pony in an instant, and they embraced as do\nfather and son in the East.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\n  Good Luck, she is never a lady,\n  But the cursedest quean alive,\n  Tricksy, wincing, and jady--\n  Kittle to lead or drive.\n  Greet her--she's hailing a stranger!\n  Meet her--she's busking to leave!\n  Let her alone for a shrew to the bone\n  And the hussy comes plucking your sleeve!\n  Largesse!  Largesse, O Fortune!\n  Give or hold at your will.\n  If I've no care for Fortune,\n  Fortune must follow me still!\n\n  The Wishing-Caps.\n\n\nThen, lowering their voices, they spoke together.  Kim came to rest\nunder a tree, but the lama tugged impatiently at his elbow.\n\n'Let us go on.  The River is not here.'\n\n'Hai mai!  Have we not walked enough for a little?  Our River will not\nrun away.  Patience, and he will give us a dole.'\n\n'This.'  said the old soldier suddenly, 'is the Friend of the Stars. He\nbrought me the news yesterday.  Having seen the very man Himself, in a\nvision, giving orders for the war.'\n\n'Hm!'  said his son, all deep in his broad chest.  'He came by a\nbazar-rumour and made profit of it.'\n\nHis father laughed.  'At least he did not ride to me begging for a new\ncharger, and the Gods know how many rupees.  Are thy brothers'\nregiments also under orders?'\n\n'I do not know.  I took leave and came swiftly to thee in case--'\n\n'In case they ran before thee to beg.  O gamblers and spendthrifts all!\nBut thou hast never yet ridden in a charge.  A good horse is needed\nthere, truly.  A good follower and a good pony also for the marching.\nLet us see--let us see.'  He thrummed on the pommel.\n\n'This is no place to cast accounts in, my father.  Let us go to thy\nhouse.'\n\n'At least pay the boy, then:  I have no pice with me, and he brought\nauspicious news.  Ho!  Friend of all the World, a war is toward as thou\nhast said.'\n\n'Nay, as I know, the war,' returned Kim composedly.\n\n'Eh?'  said the lama, fingering his beads, all eager for the road.\n\n'My master does not trouble the Stars for hire.  We brought the news\nbear witness, we brought the news, and now we go.'  Kim half-crooked\nhis hand at his side.\n\nThe son tossed a silver coin through the sunlight, grumbling something\nabout beggars and jugglers.  It was a four-anna piece, and would feed\nthem well for days.  The lama, seeing the flash of the metal, droned a\nblessing.\n\n'Go thy way, Friend of all the World,' piped the old soldier, wheeling\nhis scrawny mount.  'For once in all my days I have met a true\nprophet--who was not in the Army.'\n\nFather and son swung round together:  the old man sitting as erect as\nthe younger.\n\nA Punjabi constable in yellow linen trousers slouched across the road.\nHe had seen the money pass.\n\n'Halt!'  he cried in impressive English.  'Know ye not that there is a\ntakkus of two annas a head, which is four annas, on those who enter the\nRoad from this side-road?  It is the order of the Sirkar, and the money\nis spent for the planting of trees and the beautification of the ways.'\n\n'And the bellies of the police,' said Kim, slipping out of arm's reach.\n'Consider for a while, man with a mud head.  Think you we came from the\nnearest pond like the frog, thy father-in-law?  Hast thou ever heard\nthe name of thy brother?'\n\n'And who was he?  Leave the boy alone,' cried a senior constable,\nimmensely delighted, as he squatted down to smoke his pipe in the\nveranda.\n\n'He took a label from a bottle of belaitee-pani [soda-water], and,\naffixing it to a bridge, collected taxes for a month from those who\npassed, saying that it was the Sirkar's order.  Then came an Englishman\nand broke his head.  Ah, brother, I am a town-crow, not a village-crow!'\n\nThe policeman drew back abashed, and Kim hooted at him all down the\nroad.\n\n'Was there ever such a disciple as I?' he cried merrily to the lama.\n'All earth would have picked thy bones within ten mile of Lahore city\nif I had not guarded thee.'\n\n'I consider in my own mind whether thou art a spirit, sometimes, or\nsometimes an evil imp,' said the lama, smiling slowly.\n\n'I am thy chela.'  Kim dropped into step at his side--that\nindescribable gait of the long-distance tramp all the world over.\n\n'Now let us walk,' muttered the lama, and to the click of his rosary\nthey walked in silence mile upon mile.  The lama as usual, was deep in\nmeditation, but Kim's bright eyes were open wide.  This broad, smiling\nriver of life, he considered, was a vast improvement on the cramped and\ncrowded Lahore streets.  There were new people and new sights at every\nstride--castes he knew and castes that were altogether out of his\nexperience.\n\nThey met a troop of long-haired, strong-scented Sansis with baskets of\nlizards and other unclean food on their backs, their lean dogs sniffing\nat their heels.  These people kept their own side of the road', moving\nat a quick, furtive jog-trot, and all other castes gave them ample\nroom; for the Sansi is deep pollution.  Behind them, walking wide and\nstiffly across the strong shadows, the memory of his leg-irons still on\nhim, strode one newly released from the jail; his full stomach and\nshiny skin to prove that the Government fed its prisoners better than\nmost honest men could feed themselves.  Kim knew that walk well, and\nmade broad jest of it as they passed.  Then an Akali, a wild-eyed,\nwild-haired Sikh devotee in the blue-checked clothes of his faith, with\npolished-steel quoits glistening on the cone of his tall blue turban,\nstalked past, returning from a visit to one of the independent Sikh\nStates, where he had been singing the ancient glories of the Khalsa to\nCollege-trained princelings in top-boots and white-cord breeches. Kim\nwas careful not to irritate that man; for the Akali's temper is short\nand his arm quick.  Here and there they met or were overtaken by the\ngaily dressed crowds of whole villages turning out to some local fair;\nthe women, with their babes on their hips, walking behind the men, the\nolder boys prancing on sticks of sugar-cane, dragging rude brass models\nof locomotives such as they sell for a halfpenny, or flashing the sun\ninto the eyes of their betters from cheap toy mirrors.  One could see\nat a glance what each had bought; and if there were any doubt it needed\nonly to watch the wives comparing, brown arm against brown arm, the\nnewly purchased dull glass bracelets that come from the North-West.\nThese merry-makers stepped slowly, calling one to the other and\nstopping to haggle with sweetmeat-sellers, or to make a prayer before\none of the wayside shrines--sometimes Hindu, sometimes Mussalman--which\nthe low-caste of both creeds share with beautiful impartiality.  A\nsolid line of blue, rising and falling like the back of a caterpillar\nin haste, would swing up through the quivering dust and trot past to a\nchorus of quick cackling.  That was a gang of changars--the women who\nhave taken all the embankments of all the Northern railways under their\ncharge--a flat-footed, big-bosomed, strong-limbed, blue-petticoated\nclan of earth-carriers, hurrying north on news of a job, and wasting no\ntime by the road.  They belong to the caste whose men do not count, and\nthey walked with squared elbows, swinging hips, and heads on high, as\nsuits women who carry heavy weights.  A little later a marriage\nprocession would strike into the Grand Trunk with music and shoutings,\nand a smell of marigold and jasmine stronger even than the reek of the\ndust.  One could see the bride's litter, a blur of red and tinsel,\nstaggering through the haze, while the bridegroom's bewreathed pony\nturned aside to snatch a mouthful from a passing fodder-cart.  Then Kim\nwould join the Kentish-fire of good wishes and bad jokes, wishing the\ncouple a hundred sons and no daughters, as the saying is.  Still more\ninteresting and more to be shouted over it was when a strolling juggler\nwith some half-trained monkeys, or a panting, feeble bear, or a woman\nwho tied goats' horns to her feet, and with these danced on a\nslack-rope, set the horses to shying and the women to shrill,\nlong-drawn quavers of amazement.\n\nThe lama never raised his eyes.  He did not note the money-lender on\nhis goose-rumped pony, hastening along to collect the cruel interest;\nor the long-shouting, deep-voiced little mob--still in military\nformation--of native soldiers on leave, rejoicing to be rid of their\nbreeches and puttees, and saying the most outrageous things to the most\nrespectable women in sight.  Even the seller of Ganges-water he did not\nsee, and Kim expected that he would at least buy a bottle of that\nprecious stuff.  He looked steadily at the ground, and strode as\nsteadily hour after hour, his soul busied elsewhere.  But Kim was in\nthe seventh heaven of joy.  The Grand Trunk at this point was built on\nan embankment to guard against winter floods from the foothills, so\nthat one walked, as it were, a little above the country, along a\nstately corridor, seeing all India spread out to left and right.  It\nwas beautiful to behold the many-yoked grain and cotton wagons crawling\nover the country roads: one could hear their axles, complaining a mile\naway, coming nearer, till with shouts and yells and bad words they\nclimbed up the steep incline and plunged on to the hard main road,\ncarter reviling carter.  It was equally beautiful to watch the people,\nlittle clumps of red and blue and pink and white and saffron, turning\naside to go to their own villages, dispersing and growing small by twos\nand threes across the level plain.  Kim felt these things, though he\ncould not give tongue to his feelings, and so contented himself with\nbuying peeled sugar-cane and spitting the pith generously about his\npath.  From time to time the lama took snuff, and at last Kim could\nendure the silence no longer.\n\n'This is a good land--the land of the South!'  said he.  'The air is\ngood; the water is good.  Eh?'\n\n'And they are all bound upon the Wheel,' said the lama.  'Bound from\nlife after life.  To none of these has the Way been shown.'  He shook\nhimself back to this world.\n\n'And now we have walked a weary way,' said Kim.  'Surely we shall soon\ncome to a parao [a resting-place].  Shall we stay there?  Look, the sun\nis sloping.'\n\n'Who will receive us this evening?'\n\n'That is all one.  This country is full of good folk.  Besides' he sunk\nhis voice beneath a whisper--'we have money.'\n\nThe crowd thickened as they neared the resting-place which marked the\nend of their day's journey.  A line of stalls selling very simple food\nand tobacco, a stack of firewood, a police-station, a well, a\nhorse-trough, a few trees, and, under them, some trampled ground dotted\nwith the black ashes of old fires, are all that mark a parao on the\nGrand Trunk; if you except the beggars and the crows--both hungry.\n\nBy this time the sun was driving broad golden spokes through the lower\nbranches of the mango-trees; the parakeets and doves were coming home\nin their hundreds; the chattering, grey-backed Seven Sisters, talking\nover the day's adventures, walked back and forth in twos and threes\nalmost under the feet of the travellers; and shufflings and scufflings\nin the branches showed that the bats were ready to go out on the\nnight-picket.  Swiftly the light gathered itself together, painted for\nan instant the faces and the cartwheels and the bullocks' horns as red\nas blood.  Then the night fell, changing the touch of the air, drawing\na low, even haze, like a gossamer veil of blue, across the face of the\ncountry, and bringing out, keen and distinct, the smell of wood-smoke\nand cattle and the good scent of wheaten cakes cooked on ashes.  The\nevening patrol hurried out of the police-station with important\ncoughings and reiterated orders; and a live charcoal ball in the cup of\na wayside carter's hookah glowed red while Kim's eye mechanically\nwatched the last flicker of the sun on the brass tweezers.\n\nThe life of the parao was very like that of the Kashmir Serai on a\nsmall scale.  Kim dived into the happy Asiatic disorder which, if you\nonly allow time, will bring you everything that a simple man needs.\n\nHis wants were few, because, since the lama had no caste scruples,\ncooked food from the nearest stall would serve; but, for luxury's sake,\nKim bought a handful of dung-cakes to build a fire.  All about, coming\nand going round the little flames, men cried for oil, or grain, or\nsweetmeats, or tobacco, jostling one another while they waited their\nturn at the well; and under the men's voices you heard from halted,\nshuttered carts the high squeals and giggles of women whose faces\nshould not be seen in public.\n\nNowadays, well-educated natives are of opinion that when their\nwomenfolk travel--and they visit a good deal--it is better to take them\nquickly by rail in a properly screened compartment; and that custom is\nspreading.  But there are always those of the old rock who hold by the\nuse of their forefathers; and, above all, there are always the old\nwomen--more conservative than the men--who toward the end of their days\ngo on a pilgrimage.  They, being withered and undesirable, do not,\nunder certain circumstances, object to unveiling.  After their long\nseclusion, during which they have always been in business touch with a\nthousand outside interests, they love the bustle and stir of the open\nroad, the gatherings at the shrines, and the infinite possibilities of\ngossip with like-minded dowagers.  Very often it suits a longsuffering\nfamily that a strong-tongued, iron-willed old lady should disport\nherself about India in this fashion; for certainly pilgrimage is\ngrateful to the Gods.  So all about India, in the most remote places,\nas in the most public, you find some knot of grizzled servitors in\nnominal charge of an old lady who is more or less curtained and hid\naway in a bullock-cart.  Such men are staid and discreet, and when a\nEuropean or a high-caste native is near will net their charge with most\nelaborate precautions; but in the ordinary haphazard chances of\npilgrimage the precautions are not taken.  The old lady is, after all,\nintensely human, and lives to look upon life.\n\nKim marked down a gaily ornamented ruth or family bullock-cart, with a\nbroidered canopy of two domes, like a double-humped camel, which had\njust been drawn into the par.  Eight men made its retinue, and two of\nthe eight were armed with rusty sabres--sure signs that they followed a\nperson of distinction, for the common folk do not bear arms.  An\nincreasing cackle of complaints, orders, and jests, and what to a\nEuropean would have been bad language, came from behind the curtains.\nHere was evidently a woman used to command.\n\nKim looked over the retinue critically.  Half of them were thin-legged,\ngrey-bearded Ooryas from down country.  The other half were\nduffle-clad, felt-hatted hillmen of the North; and that mixture told\nits own tale, even if he had not overheard the incessant sparring\nbetween the two divisions.  The old lady was going south on a\nvisit--probably to a rich relative, most probably to a son-in-law, who\nhad sent up an escort as a mark of respect.  The hillmen would be of\nher own people--Kulu or Kangra folk.  It was quite clear that she was\nnot taking her daughter down to be wedded, or the curtains would have\nbeen laced home and the guard would have allowed no one near the car.\nA merry and a high-spirited dame, thought Kim, balancing the dung-cake\nin one hand, the cooked food in the other, and piloting the lama with a\nnudging shoulder. Something might be made out of the meeting.  The lama\nwould give him no help, but, as a conscientious chela, Kim was\ndelighted to beg for two.\n\nHe built his fire as close to the cart as he dared, waiting for one of\nthe escort to order him away.  The lama dropped wearily to the ground,\nmuch as a heavy fruit-eating bat cowers, and returned to his rosary.\n\n'Stand farther off, beggar!'  The order was shouted in broken\nHindustani by one of the hillmen.\n\n'Huh!  It is only a pahari [a hillman]', said Kim over his shoulder.\n'Since when have the hill-asses owned all Hindustan?'\n\nThe retort was a swift and brilliant sketch of Kim's pedigree for three\ngenerations.\n\n'Ah!'  Kim's voice was sweeter than ever, as he broke the dung-cake\ninto fit pieces.  'In my country we call that the beginning of\nlove-talk.'\n\nA harsh, thin cackle behind the curtains put the hillman on his mettle\nfor a second shot.\n\n'Not so bad--not so bad,' said Kim with calm.  'But have a care, my\nbrother, lest we--we, I say--be minded to give a curse or so in return.\nAnd our curses have the knack of biting home.'\n\nThe Ooryas laughed; the hillman sprang forward threateningly.  The lama\nsuddenly raised his head, bringing his huge tam-o'-shanter hat into the\nfull light of Kim's new-started fire.\n\n'What is it?'  said he.\n\nThe man halted as though struck to stone.  'I--I--am saved from a great\nsin,' he stammered.\n\n'The foreigner has found him a priest at last,' whispered one of the\nOoryas.\n\n'Hai!  Why is that beggar-brat not well beaten?'  the old woman cried.\n\nThe hillman drew back to the cart and whispered something to the\ncurtain.  There was dead silence, then a muttering.\n\n'This goes well,' thought Kim, pretending neither to see nor hear.\n\n'When--when--he has eaten'--the hillman fawned on Kim--'it--it is\nrequested that the Holy One will do the honour to talk to one who would\nspeak to him.'\n\n'After he has eaten he will sleep,' Kim returned loftily.  He could not\nquite see what new turn the game had taken, but stood resolute to\nprofit by it.  'Now I will get him his food.'  The last sentence,\nspoken loudly, ended with a sigh as of faintness.\n\n'I--I myself and the others of my people will look to that--if it is\npermitted.'\n\n'It is permitted,' said Kim, more loftily than ever.  'Holy One, these\npeople will bring us food.'\n\n'The land is good.  All the country of the South is good--a great and a\nterrible world,' mumbled the lama drowsily.\n\n'Let him sleep,' said Kim, 'but look to it that we are well fed when he\nwakes.  He is a very holy man.'\n\nAgain one of the Ooryas said something contemptuously.\n\n'He is not a fakir.  He is not a down-country beggar,' Kim went on\nseverely, addressing the stars.  'He is the most holy of holy men. He\nis above all castes.  I am his chela.'\n\n'Come here!'  said the flat thin voice behind the curtain; and Kim\ncame, conscious that eyes he could not see were staring at him.  One\nskinny brown finger heavy with rings lay on the edge of the cart, and\nthe talk went this way:\n\n'Who is that one?'\n\n'An exceedingly holy one.  He comes from far off.  He comes from Tibet.'\n\n'Where in Tibet?'\n\n'From behind the snows--from a very far place.  He knows the stars; he\nmakes horoscopes; he reads nativities.  But he does not do this for\nmoney.  He does it for kindness and great charity.  I am his disciple.\nI am called also the Friend of the Stars.'\n\n'Thou art no hillman.'\n\n'Ask him.  He will tell thee I was sent to him from the Stars to show\nhim an end to his pilgrimage.'\n\n'Humph!  Consider, brat, that I am an old woman and not altogether a\nfool.  Lamas I know, and to these I give reverence, but thou art no\nmore a lawful chela than this my finger is the pole of this wagon. Thou\nart a casteless Hindu--a bold and unblushing beggar, attached, belike,\nto the Holy One for the sake of gain.'\n\n'Do we not all work for gain?'  Kim changed his tone promptly to match\nthat altered voice.  'I have heard'--this was a bow drawn at a\nventure--'I have heard--'\n\n'What hast thou heard?'  she snapped, rapping with the finger.\n\n'Nothing that I well remember, but some talk in the bazars, which is\ndoubtless a lie, that even Rajahs--small Hill Rajahs--'\n\n'But none the less of good Rajput blood.'\n\n'Assuredly of good blood.  That these even sell the more comely of\ntheir womenfolk for gain.  Down south they sell them--to zemindars and\nsuch--all of Oudh.'\n\nIf there be one thing in the world that the small Hill Rajahs deny it\nis just this charge; but it happens to be one thing that the bazars\nbelieve, when they discuss the mysterious slave-traffics of India.  The\nold lady explained to Kim, in a tense, indignant whisper, precisely\nwhat manner and fashion of malignant liar he was.  Had Kim hinted this\nwhen she was a girl, he would have been pommelled to death that same\nevening by an elephant.  This was perfectly true.\n\n'Ahai!  I am only a beggar's brat, as the Eye of Beauty has said,' he\nwailed in extravagant terror.\n\n'Eye of Beauty, forsooth!  Who am I that thou shouldst fling\nbeggar-endearments at me?'  And yet she laughed at the long-forgotten\nword.  'Forty years ago that might have been said, and not without\ntruth.  Ay.  thirty years ago.  But it is the fault of this gadding up\nand down Hind that a king's widow must jostle all the scum of the land,\nand be made a mock by beggars.'\n\n'Great Queen,' said Kim promptly, for he heard her shaking with\nindignation, 'I am even what the Great Queen says I am; but none the\nless is my master holy.  He has not yet heard the Great Queen's order\nthat--'\n\n'Order?  I order a Holy One--a Teacher of the Law--to come and speak to\na woman?  Never!'\n\n'Pity my stupidity.  I thought it was given as an order--'\n\n'It was not.  It was a petition.  Does this make all clear?'\n\nA silver coin clicked on the edge of the cart.  Kim took it and\nsalaamed profoundly.  The old lady recognized that, as the eyes and the\nears of the lama, he was to be propitiated.\n\n'I am but the Holy One's disciple.  When he has eaten perhaps he will\ncome.'\n\n'Oh, villain and shameless rogue!'  The jewelled forefinger shook\nitself at him reprovingly; but he could hear the old lady's chuckle.\n\n'Nay, what is it?'  he said, dropping into his most caressing and\nconfidential tone--the one, he well knew, that few could resist.\n'Is--is there any need of a son in thy family?  Speak freely, for we\npriests--' That last was a direct plagiarism from a fakir by the\nTaksali Gate.\n\n'We priests!  Thou art not yet old enough to--' She checked the joke\nwith another laugh.  'Believe me, now and again, we women, O priest,\nthink of other matters than sons.  Moreover, my daughter has borne her\nman-child.'\n\n'Two arrows in the quiver are better than one; and three are better\nstill.'  Kim quoted the proverb with a meditative cough, looking\ndiscreetly earthward.\n\n'True--oh, true.  But perhaps that will come.  Certainly those\ndown-country Brahmins are utterly useless.  I sent gifts and monies and\ngifts again to them, and they prophesied.'\n\n'Ah,' drawled Kim, with infinite contempt, 'they prophesied!'  A\nprofessional could have done no better.\n\n'And it was not till I remembered my own Gods that my prayers were\nheard.  I chose an auspicious hour, and--perhaps thy Holy One has heard\nof the Abbot of the Lung-Cho lamassery.  It was to him I put the\nmatter, and behold in the due time all came about as I desired. The\nBrahmin in the house of the father of my daughter's son has since said\nthat it was through his prayers--which is a little error that I will\nexplain to him when we reach our journey's end. And so afterwards I go\nto Buddh Gaya, to make shraddha for the father of my children.'\n\n'Thither go we.'\n\n'Doubly auspicious,' chirruped the old lady.  'A second son at least!'\n\n'O Friend of all the World!'  The lama had waked, and, simply as a\nchild bewildered in a strange bed, called for Kim.\n\n'I come!  I come, Holy One!'  He dashed to the fire, where he found the\nlama already surrounded by dishes of food, the hillmen visibly adoring\nhim and the Southerners looking sourly.\n\n'Go back!  Withdraw!'  Kim cried.  'Do we eat publicly like dogs?' They\nfinished the meal in silence, each turned a little from the other, and\nKim topped it with a native-made cigarette.\n\n'Have I not said an hundred times that the South is a good land? Here\nis a virtuous and high-born widow of a Hill Rajah on pilgrimage, she\nsays, to Buddha Gay.  She it is sends us those dishes; and when thou\nart well rested she would speak to thee.'\n\n'Is this also thy work?'  The lama dipped deep into his snuff-gourd.\n\n'Who else watched over thee since our wonderful journey began?' Kim's\neyes danced in his head as he blew the rank smoke through his nostrils\nand stretched him on the dusty ground.  'Have I failed to oversee thy\ncomforts, Holy One?'\n\n'A blessing on thee.'  The lama inclined his solemn head.  'I have\nknown many men in my so long life, and disciples not a few.  But to\nnone among men, if so be thou art woman-born, has my heart gone out as\nit has to thee--thoughtful, wise, and courteous; but something of a\nsmall imp.'\n\n'And I have never seen such a priest as thou.'  Kim considered the\nbenevolent yellow face wrinkle by wrinkle.  'It is less than three days\nsince we took the road together, and it is as though it were a hundred\nyears.'\n\n'Perhaps in a former life it was permitted that I should have rendered\nthee some service.  Maybe'--he smiled--'I freed thee from a trap; or,\nhaving caught thee on a hook in the days when I was not enlightened,\ncast thee back into the river.'\n\n'Maybe,' said Kim quietly.  He had heard this sort of speculation again\nand again, from the mouths of many whom the English would not consider\nimaginative.  'Now, as regards that woman in the bullock-cart.  I think\nshe needs a second son for her daughter.'\n\n'That is no part of the Way,' sighed the lama.  'But at least she is\nfrom the Hills.  Ah, the Hills, and the snow of the Hills!'\n\nHe rose and stalked to the cart.  Kim would have given his ears to come\ntoo, but the lama did not invite him; and the few words he caught were\nin an unknown tongue, for they spoke some common speech of the\nmountains.  The woman seemed to ask questions which the lama turned\nover in his mind before answering.  Now and again he heard the singsong\ncadence of a Chinese quotation.  It was a strange picture that Kim\nwatched between drooped eyelids.  The lama, very straight and erect,\nthe deep folds of his yellow clothing slashed with black in the light\nof the parao fires precisely as a knotted tree-trunk is slashed with\nthe shadows of the low sun, addressed a tinsel and lacquered ruth which\nburned like a many-coloured jewel in the same uncertain light.  The\npatterns on the gold-worked curtains ran up and down, melting and\nreforming as the folds shook and quivered to the night wind; and when\nthe talk grew more earnest the jewelled forefinger snapped out little\nsparks of light between the embroideries.  Behind the cart was a wall\nof uncertain darkness speckled with little flames and alive with\nhalf-caught forms and faces and shadows.  The voices of early evening\nhad settled down to one soothing hum whose deepest note was the steady\nchumping of the bullocks above their chopped straw, and whose highest\nwas the tinkle of a Bengali dancing-girl's sitar.  Most men had eaten\nand pulled deep at their gurgling, grunting hookahs, which in full\nblast sound like bull-frogs.\n\nAt last the lama returned.  A hillman walked behind him with a wadded\ncotton-quilt and spread it carefully by the fire.\n\n'She deserves ten thousand grandchildren,' thought Kim.  'None the\nless, but for me, those gifts would not have come.'\n\n'A virtuous woman--and a wise one.'  The lama slackened off, joint by\njoint, like a slow camel.  'The world is full of charity to those who\nfollow the Way.'  He flung a fair half of the quilt over Kim.\n\n'And what said she?'  Kim rolled up in his share of it.\n\n'She asked me many questions and propounded many problems--the most of\nwhich were idle tales which she had heard from devil-serving priests\nwho pretend to follow the Way.  Some I answered, and some I said were\nfoolish.  Many wear the Robe, but few keep the Way.'\n\n'True.  That is true.'  Kim used the thoughtful, conciliatory tone of\nthose who wish to draw confidences.\n\n'But by her lights she is most right-minded.  She desires greatly that\nwe should go with her to Buddh Gaya; her road being ours, as I\nunderstand, for many days' journey to the southward.'\n\n'And?'\n\n'Patience a little.  To this I said that my Search came before all\nthings.  She had heard many foolish legends, but this great truth of my\nRiver she had never heard.  Such are the priests of the lower hills!\nShe knew the Abbot of Lung-Cho, but she did not know of my River--nor\nthe tale of the Arrow.'\n\n'And?'\n\n'I spoke therefore of the Search, and of the Way, and of matters that\nwere profitable; she desiring only that I should accompany her and make\nprayer for a second son.'\n\n'Aha!  \"We women\" do not think of anything save children,' said Kim\nsleepily.\n\n'Now, since our roads run together for a while, I do not see that we in\nany way depart from our Search if so be we accompany her--at least as\nfar as--I have forgotten the name of the city.'\n\n'Ohe!'  said Kim, turning and speaking in a sharp whisper to one of the\nOoryas a few yards away.  'Where is your master's house?'\n\n'A little behind Saharunpore, among the fruit gardens.'  He named the\nvillage.\n\n'That was the place,' said the lama.  'So far, at least, we can go with\nher.'\n\n'Flies go to carrion,' said the Oorya, in an abstracted voice.\n\n'For the sick cow a crow; for the sick man a Brahmin.'  Kim breathed\nthe proverb impersonally to the shadow-tops of the trees overhead.\n\nThe Oorya grunted and held his peace.\n\n'So then we go with her, Holy One?'\n\n'Is there any reason against?  I can still step aside and try all the\nrivers that the road overpasses.  She desires that I should come.  She\nvery greatly desires it.'\n\nKim stifled a laugh in the quilt.  When once that imperious old lady\nhad recovered from her natural awe of a lama he thought it probable\nthat she would be worth listening to.\n\nHe was nearly asleep when the lama suddenly quoted a proverb:  'The\nhusbands of the talkative have a great reward hereafter.'  Then Kim\nheard him snuff thrice, and dozed off, still laughing.\n\nThe diamond-bright dawn woke men and crows and bullocks together. Kim\nsat up and yawned, shook himself, and thrilled with delight. This was\nseeing the world in real truth; this was life as he would have\nit--bustling and shouting, the buckling of belts, and beating of\nbullocks and creaking of wheels, lighting of fires and cooking of food,\nand new sights at every turn of the approving eye.  The morning mist\nswept off in a whorl of silver, the parrots shot away to some distant\nriver in shrieking green hosts:  all the well-wheels within ear-shot\nwent to work.  India was awake, and Kim was in the middle of it, more\nawake and more excited than anyone, chewing on a twig that he would\npresently use as a toothbrush; for he borrowed right- and left-handedly\nfrom all the customs of the country he knew and loved.  There was no\nneed to worry about food--no need to spend a cowrie at the crowded\nstalls.  He was the disciple of a holy man annexed by a strong-willed\nold lady.  All things would be prepared for them, and when they were\nrespectfully invited so to do they would sit and eat.  For the\nrest--Kim giggled here as he cleaned his teeth--his hostess would\nrather heighten the enjoyment of the road.  He inspected her bullocks\ncritically, as they came up grunting and blowing under the yokes.  If\nthey went too fast--it was not likely--there would be a pleasant seat\nfor himself along the pole; the lama would sit beside the driver.  The\nescort, of course, would walk.  The old lady, equally of course, would\ntalk a great deal, and by what he had heard that conversation would not\nlack salt.  She was already ordering, haranguing, rebuking, and, it\nmust be said, cursing her servants for delays.\n\n'Get her her pipe.  In the name of the Gods, get her her pipe and stop\nher ill-omened mouth,' cried an Oorya, tying up his shapeless bundles\nof bedding.  'She and the parrots are alike.  They screech in the dawn.'\n\n'The lead-bullocks!  Hai!  Look to the lead-bullocks!'  They were\nbacking and wheeling as a grain-cart's axle caught them by the horns.\n'Son of an owl, where dost thou go?'  This to the grinning carter.\n\n'Ai!  Yai!  Yai!  That within there is the Queen of Delhi going to pray\nfor a son,' the man called back over his high load.  'Room for the\nQueen of Delhi and her Prime Minister the grey monkey climbing up his\nown sword!'  Another cart loaded with bark for a down-country tannery\nfollowed close behind, and its driver added a few compliments as the\nruth-bullocks backed and backed again.\n\nFrom behind the shaking curtains came one volley of invective.  It did\nnot last long, but in kind and quality, in blistering, biting\nappropriateness, it was beyond anything that even Kim had heard.  He\ncould see the carter's bare chest collapse with amazement, as the man\nsalaamed reverently to the voice, leaped from the pole, and helped the\nescort haul their volcano on to the main road.  Here the voice told him\ntruthfully what sort of wife he had wedded, and what she was doing in\nhis absence.\n\n'Oh, shabash!'  murmured Kim, unable to contain himself, as the man\nslunk away.\n\n'Well done, indeed?  It is a shame and a scandal that a poor woman may\nnot go to make prayer to her Gods except she be jostled and insulted by\nall the refuse of Hindustan--that she must eat gali [abuse] as men eat\nghi.  But I have yet a wag left to my tongue--a word or two well spoken\nthat serves the occasion.  And still am I without my tobacco!  Who is\nthe one-eyed and luckless son of shame that has not yet prepared my\npipe?'\n\nIt was hastily thrust in by a hillman, and a trickle of thick smoke\nfrom each corner of the curtains showed that peace was restored.\n\nIf Kim had walked proudly the day before, disciple of a holy man, today\nhe paced with tenfold pride in the train of a semi-royal procession,\nwith a recognized place under the patronage of an old lady of charming\nmanners and infinite resource.  The escort, their heads tied up\nnative-fashion, fell in on either side the cart, shuffling enormous\nclouds of dust.\n\nThe lama and Kim walked a little to one side; Kim chewing his stick of\nsugarcane, and making way for no one under the status of a priest.\nThey could hear the old lady's tongue clack as steadily as a\nrice-husker.  She bade the escort tell her what was going on on the\nroad; and so soon as they were clear of the parao she flung back the\ncurtains and peered out, her veil a third across her face. Her men did\nnot eye her directly when she addressed them, and thus the proprieties\nwere more or less observed.\n\nA dark, sallowish District Superintendent of Police, faultlessly\nuniformed, an Englishman, trotted by on a tired horse, and, seeing from\nher retinue what manner of person she was, chaffed her.\n\n'O mother,' he cried, 'do they do this in the zenanas?  Suppose an\nEnglishman came by and saw that thou hast no nose?'\n\n'What?'  she shrilled back.  'Thine own mother has no nose?  Why say\nso, then, on the open road?'\n\nIt was a fair counter.  The Englishman threw up his hand with the\ngesture of a man hit at sword-play.  She laughed and nodded.\n\n'Is this a face to tempt virtue aside?'  She withdrew all her veil and\nstared at him.\n\nIt was by no means lovely, but as the man gathered up his reins he\ncalled it a Moon of Paradise, a Disturber of Integrity, and a few other\nfantastic epithets which doubled her up with mirth.\n\n'That is a nut-cut [rogue],' she said.  'All police-constables are\nnut-cuts; but the police-wallahs are the worst.  Hai, my son, thou hast\nnever learned all that since thou camest from Belait [Europe]. Who\nsuckled thee?'\n\n'A pahareen--a hillwoman of Dalhousie, my mother.  Keep thy beauty\nunder a shade--O Dispenser of Delights,' and he was gone.\n\n'These be the sort'--she took a fine judicial tone, and stuffed her\nmouth with pan--'These be the sort to oversee justice.  They know the\nland and the customs of the land.  The others, all new from Europe,\nsuckled by white women and learning our tongues from books, are worse\nthan the pestilence.  They do harm to Kings.'  Then she told a long,\nlong tale to the world at large, of an ignorant young policeman who had\ndisturbed some small Hill Rajah, a ninth cousin of her own, in the\nmatter of a trivial land-case, winding up with a quotation from a work\nby no means devotional.\n\nThen her mood changed, and she bade one of the escort ask whether the\nlama would walk alongside and discuss matters of religion.  So Kim\ndropped back into the dust and returned to his sugar-cane.  For an hour\nor more the lama's tam-o'shanter showed like a moon through the haze;\nand, from all he heard, Kim gathered that the old woman wept.  One of\nthe Ooryas half apologized for his rudeness overnight, saying that he\nhad never known his mistress of so bland a temper, and he ascribed it\nto the presence of the strange priest. Personally, he believed in\nBrahmins, though, like all natives, he was acutely aware of their\ncunning and their greed.  Still, when Brahmins but irritated with\nbegging demands the mother of his master's wife, and when she sent them\naway so angry that they cursed the whole retinue (which was the real\nreason of the second off-side bullock going lame, and of the pole\nbreaking the night before), he was prepared to accept any priest of any\nother denomination in or out of India.  To this Kim assented with wise\nnods, and bade the Oorya observe that the lama took no money, and that\nthe cost of his and Kim's food would be repaid a hundred times in the\ngood luck that would attend the caravan henceforward.  He also told\nstories of Lahore city, and sang a song or two which made the escort\nlaugh.  As a town-mouse well acquainted with the latest songs by the\nmost fashionable composers--they are women for the most part--Kim had a\ndistinct advantage over men from a little fruit-village behind\nSaharunpore, but he let that advantage be inferred.\n\nAt noon they turned aside to eat, and the meal was good, plentiful, and\nwell-served on plates of clean leaves, in decency, out of drift of the\ndust.  They gave the scraps to certain beggars, that all requirements\nmight be fulfilled, and sat down to a long, luxurious smoke.  The old\nlady had retreated behind her curtains, but mixed most freely in the\ntalk, her servants arguing with and contradicting her as servants do\nthroughout the East.  She compared the cool and the pines of the Kangra\nand Kulu hills with the dust and the mangoes of the South; she told a\ntale of some old local Gods at the edge of her husband's territory; she\nroundly abused the tobacco which she was then smoking, reviled all\nBrahmins, and speculated without reserve on the coming of many\ngrandsons.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\n  Here come I to my own again\n  Fed, forgiven, and known again\n  Claimed by bone of my bone again,\n  And sib to flesh of my flesh!\n  The fatted calf is dressed for me,\n  But the husks have greater zest for me ...\n  I think my pigs will be best for me,\n  So I'm off to the styes afresh.\n\n  The Prodigal Son.\n\n\nOnce more the lazy, string-tied, shuffling procession got under way,\nand she slept till they reached the next halting-stage.  It was a very\nshort march, and time lacked an hour to sundown, so Kim cast about for\nmeans of amusement.\n\n'But why not sit and rest?'  said one of the escort.  'Only the devils\nand the English walk to and fro without reason.'\n\n'Never make friends with the Devil, a Monkey, or a Boy.  No man knows\nwhat they will do next,' said his fellow.\n\nKim turned a scornful back--he did not want to hear the old story how\nthe Devil played with the boys and repented of it and walked idly\nacross country.\n\nThe lama strode after him.  All that day, whenever they passed a\nstream, he had turned aside to look at it, but in no case had he\nreceived any warning that he had found his River.  Insensibly, too, the\ncomfort of speaking to someone in a reasonable tongue, and of being\nproperly considered and respected as her spiritual adviser by a\nwell-born woman, had weaned his thoughts a little from the Search.  And\nfurther, he was prepared to spend serene years in his quest; having\nnothing of the white man's impatience, but a great faith.\n\n'Where goest thou?'  he called after Kim.\n\n'Nowhither--it was a small march, and all this'--Kim waved his hands\nabroad--'is new to me.'\n\n'She is beyond question a wise and a discerning woman.  But it is hard\nto meditate when--'\n\n'All women are thus.'  Kim spoke as might have Solomon.\n\n'Before the lamassery was a broad platform,' the lama muttered, looping\nup the well-worn rosary, 'of stone.  On that I have left the marks of\nmy feet--pacing to and fro with these.'\n\nHe clicked the beads, and began the 'Om mane pudme hum's of his\ndevotion; grateful for the cool, the quiet, and the absence of dust.\n\nOne thing after another drew Kim's idle eye across the plain.  There\nwas no purpose in his wanderings, except that the build of the huts\nnear by seemed new, and he wished to investigate.\n\nThey came out on a broad tract of grazing-ground, brown and purple in\nthe afternoon light, with a heavy clump of mangoes in the centre.  It\nstruck Kim as curious that no shrine stood in so eligible a spot:  the\nboy was observing as any priest for these things.  Far across the plain\nwalked side by side four men, made small by the distance.  He looked\nintently under his curved palms and caught the sheen of brass.\n\n'Soldiers.  White soldiers!'  said he.  'Let us see.'\n\n'It is always soldiers when thou and I go out alone together.  But I\nhave never seen the white soldiers.'\n\n'They do no harm except when they are drunk.  Keep behind this tree.'\n\nThey stepped behind the thick trunks in the cool dark of the\nmango-tope. Two little figures halted; the other two came forward\nuncertainly.  They were the advance-party of a regiment on the march,\nsent out, as usual, to mark the camp.  They bore five-foot sticks with\nfluttering flags, and called to each other as they spread over the flat\nearth.\n\nAt last they entered the mango-grove, walking heavily.\n\n'It's here or hereabouts--officers' tents under the trees, I take it,\nan' the rest of us can stay outside.  Have they marked out for the\nbaggage-wagons behind?'\n\nThey cried again to their comrades in the distance, and the rough\nanswer came back faint and mellowed.\n\n'Shove the flag in here, then,' said one.\n\n'What do they prepare?'  said the lama, wonderstruck.  'This is a great\nand terrible world.  What is the device on the flag?'\n\nA soldier thrust a stave within a few feet of them, grunted\ndiscontentedly, pulled it up again, conferred with his companion, who\nlooked up and down the shaded cave of greenery, and returned it.\n\nKim stared with all his eyes, his breath coming short and sharp between\nhis teeth.  The soldiers stamped off into the sunshine.\n\n'O Holy One!'  he gasped.  'My horoscope!  The drawing in the dust by\nthe priest at Umballa!  Remember what he said.  First come\ntwo--ferashes--to make all things ready--in a dark place, as it is\nalways at the beginning of a vision.'\n\n'But this is not vision,' said the lama.  'It is the world's Illusion,\nand no more.'\n\n'And after them comes the Bull--the Red Bull on the green field. Look!\nIt is he!'\n\nHe pointed to the flag that was snap snapping in the evening breeze not\nten feet away.  It was no more than an ordinary camp marking-flag; but\nthe regiment, always punctilious in matters of millinery, had charged\nit with the regimental device, the Red Bull, which is the crest of the\nMavericks--the great Red Bull on a background of Irish green.\n\n'I see, and now I remember.'  said the lama.  'Certainly it is thy\nBull.  Certainly, also, the two men came to make all ready.'\n\n'They are soldiers--white soldiers.  What said the priest?  \"The sign\nover against the Bull is the sign of War and armed men.\"  Holy One,\nthis thing touches my Search.'\n\n'True.  It is true.'  The lama stared fixedly at the device that flamed\nlike a ruby in the dusk.  'The priest at Umballa said that thine was\nthe sign of War.'\n\n'What is to do now?'\n\n'Wait.  Let us wait.'\n\n'Even now the darkness clears,' said Kim.  It was only natural that the\ndescending sun should at last strike through the tree-trunks, across\nthe grove, filling it with mealy gold light for a few minutes; but to\nKim it was the crown of the Umballa Brahmin's prophecy.\n\n'Hark!'  said the lama.  'One beats a drum--far off!'\n\nAt first the sound, carrying diluted through the still air, resembled\nthe beating of an artery in the head.  Soon a sharpness was added.\n\n'Ah!  The music,' Kim explained.  He knew the sound of a regimental\nband, but it amazed the lama.\n\nAt the far end of the plain a heavy, dusty column crawled in sight.\nThen the wind brought the tune:\n\n  We crave your condescension\n  To tell you what we know\n  Of marching in the Mulligan Guards\n  To Sligo Port below!\n\nHere broke in the shrill-tongued fifes:\n\n  We shouldered arms,\n  We marched--we marched away.\n  From Phoenix Park\n  We marched to Dublin Bay.\n  The drums and the fifes,\n  Oh, sweetly they did play,\n  As we marched--marched--marched--with the\n  Mulligan Guards!\n\nIt was the band of the Mavericks playing the regiment to camp; for the\nmen were route-marching with their baggage.  The rippling column swung\ninto the level--carts behind it divided left and right, ran about like\nan ant-hill, and ...\n\n'But this is sorcery!'  said the lama.\n\nThe plain dotted itself with tents that seemed to rise, all spread,\nfrom the carts.  Another rush of men invaded the grove, pitched a huge\ntent in silence, ran up yet eight or nine more by the side of it,\nunearthed cooking-pots, pans, and bundles, which were taken possession\nof by a crowd of native servants; and behold the mango-tope turned into\nan orderly town as they watched!\n\n'Let us go,' said the lama, sinking back afraid, as the fires twinkled\nand white officers with jingling swords stalked into the Mess-tent.\n\n'Stand back in the shadow.  No one can see beyond the light of a fire,'\nsaid Kim, his eyes still on the flag.  He had never before watched the\nroutine of a seasoned regiment pitching camp in thirty minutes.\n\n'Look!  look!  look!'  clucked the lama.  'Yonder comes a priest.'  It\nwas Bennett, the Church of England Chaplain of the regiment, limping in\ndusty black.  One of his flock had made some rude remarks about the\nChaplain's mettle; and to abash him Bennett had marched step by step\nwith the men that day.  The black dress, gold cross on the watch-chain,\nthe hairless face, and the soft, black wideawake hat would have marked\nhim as a holy man anywhere in all India.  He dropped into a camp-chair\nby the door of the Mess-tent and slid off his boots.  Three or four\nofficers gathered round him, laughing and joking over his exploit.\n\n'The talk of white men is wholly lacking in dignity,' said the lama,\nwho judged only by tone.  'But I considered the countenance of that\npriest and I think he is learned.  Is it likely that he will understand\nour talk?  I would talk to him of my Search.'\n\n'Never speak to a white man till he is fed,' said Kim, quoting a\nwell-known proverb.  'They will eat now, and--and I do not think they\nare good to beg from.  Let us go back to the resting-place. After we\nhave eaten we will come again.  It certainly was a Red Bull--my Red\nBull.'\n\nThey were both noticeably absent-minded when the old lady's retinue set\ntheir meal before them; so none broke their reserve, for it is not\nlucky to annoy guests.\n\n'Now,' said Kim, picking his teeth, 'we will return to that place; but\nthou, O Holy One, must wait a little way off, because thy feet are\nheavier than mine and I am anxious to see more of that Red Bull.'\n\n'But how canst thou understand the talk?  Walk slowly.  The road is\ndark,' the lama replied uneasily.\n\nKim put the question aside.  'I marked a place near to the trees,' said\nhe, 'where thou canst sit till I call.  Nay,' as the lama made some\nsort of protest, 'remember this is my Search--the Search for my Red\nBull.  The sign in the Stars was not for thee.  I know a little of the\ncustoms of white soldiers, and I always desire to see some new things.'\n\n'What dost thou not know of this world?'  The lama squatted obediently\nin a little hollow of the ground not a hundred yards from the hump of\nthe mango-trees dark against the star-powdered sky.\n\n'Stay till I call.'  Kim flitted into the dusk.  He knew that in all\nprobability there would be sentries round the camp, and smiled to\nhimself as he heard the thick boots of one.  A boy who can dodge over\nthe roofs of Lahore city on a moonlight night, using every little patch\nand corner of darkness to discomfit his pursuer, is not likely to be\nchecked by a line of well-trained soldiers.  He paid them the\ncompliment of crawling between a couple, and, running and halting,\ncrouching and dropping flat, worked his way toward the lighted\nMess-tent where, close pressed behind the mango-tree, he waited till\nsome chance word should give him a returnable lead.\n\nThe one thing now in his mind was further information as to the Red\nBull.  For aught he knew, and Kim's limitations were as curious and\nsudden as his expansions, the men, the nine hundred thorough devils of\nhis father's prophecy, might pray to the beast after dark, as Hindus\npray to the Holy Cow.  That at least would be entirely right and\nlogical, and the padre with the gold cross would be therefore the man\nto consult in the matter.  On the other hand, remembering sober-faced\npadres whom he had avoided in Lahore city, the priest might be an\ninquisitive nuisance who would bid him learn.  But had it not been\nproven at Umballa that his sign in the high heavens portended War and\narmed men?  Was he not the Friend of the Stars as well as of all the\nWorld, crammed to the teeth with dreadful secrets?  Lastly--and firstly\nas the undercurrent of all his quick thoughts--this adventure, though\nhe did not know the English word, was a stupendous lark--a delightful\ncontinuation of his old flights across the housetops, as well as the\nfulfilment of sublime prophecy.  He lay belly-flat and wriggled towards\nthe Mess-tent door, a hand on the amulet round his neck.\n\nIt was as he suspected.  The Sahibs prayed to their God; for in the\ncentre of the Mess-table--its sole ornament when they were on the line\nof march--stood a golden bull fashioned from old-time loot of the\nSummer Palace at Pekin--a red-gold bull with lowered head, ramping upon\na field of Irish green.  To him the Sahibs held out their glasses and\ncried aloud confusedly.\n\nNow the Reverend Arthur Bennett always left Mess after that toast, and\nbeing rather tired by his march his movements were more abrupt than\nusual.  Kim, with slightly raised head, was still staring at his totem\non the table, when the Chaplain stepped on his right shoulder-blade.\nKim flinched under the leather, and, rolling sideways, brought down the\nChaplain, who, ever a man of action, caught him by the throat and\nnearly choked the life out of him.  Kim then kicked him desperately in\nthe stomach.  Mr Bennett gasped and doubled up, but without relaxing\nhis grip, rolled over again, and silently hauled Kim to his own tent.\nThe Mavericks were incurable practical jokers; and it occurred to the\nEnglishman that silence was best till he had made complete inquiry.\n\n'Why, it's a boy!'  he said, as he drew his prize under the light of\nthe tent-pole lantern, then shaking him severely cried:  'What were you\ndoing?  You're a thief.  Choor?  Mallum?'  His Hindustani was very\nlimited, and the ruffled and disgusted Kim intended to keep to the\ncharacter laid down for him.  As he recovered his breath he was\ninventing a beautifully plausible tale of his relations to some\nscullion, and at the same time keeping a keen eye on and a little under\nthe Chaplain's left arm-pit.  The chance came; he ducked for the\ndoorway, but a long arm shot out and clutched at his neck, snapping the\namulet-string and closing on the amulet.\n\n'Give it me.  O, give it me.  Is it lost?  Give me the papers.'\n\nThe words were in English--the tinny, saw-cut English of the\nnative-bred, and the Chaplain jumped.\n\n'A scapular,' said he, opening his hand.  'No, some sort of heathen\ncharm.  Why--why, do you speak English?  Little boys who steal are\nbeaten.  You know that?'\n\n'I do not--I did not steal.'  Kim danced in agony like a terrier at a\nlifted stick.  'Oh, give it me.  It is my charm.  Do not thieve it from\nme.'\n\nThe Chaplain took no heed, but, going to the tent door, called aloud.\nA fattish, clean-shaven man appeared.\n\n'I want your advice, Father Victor,' said Bennett.  'I found this boy\nin the dark outside the Mess-tent.  Ordinarily, I should have chastised\nhim and let him go, because I believe him to be a thief. But it seems\nhe talks English, and he attaches some sort of value to a charm round\nhis neck.  I thought perhaps you might help me.'\n\nBetween himself and the Roman Catholic Chaplain of the Irish contingent\nlay, as Bennett believed, an unbridgeable gulf, but it was noticeable\nthat whenever the Church of England dealt with a human problem she was\nvery likely to call in the Church of Rome. Bennett's official\nabhorrence of the Scarlet Woman and all her ways was only equalled by\nhis private respect for Father Victor.\n\n'A thief talking English, is it?  Let's look at his charm.  No, it's\nnot a scapular, Bennett.'  He held out his hand.\n\n'But have we any right to open it?  A sound whipping--'\n\n'I did not thieve,' protested Kim.  'You have hit me kicks all over my\nbody.  Now give me my charm and I will go away.'\n\n'Not quite so fast.  We'll look first,' said Father Victor, leisurely\nrolling out poor Kimball O'Hara's 'ne varietur' parchment, his\nclearance-certificate, and Kim's baptismal certificate.  On this last\nO'Hara--with some confused idea that he was doing wonders for his\nson--had scrawled scores of times:  'Look after the boy.  Please look\nafter the boy'--signing his name and regimental number in full.\n\n'Powers of Darkness below!'  said Father Victor, passing all over to Mr\nBennett.  'Do you know what these things are?'\n\n'Yes.'  said Kim.  'They are mine, and I want to go away.'\n\n'I do not quite understand,' said Mr Bennett.  'He probably brought\nthem on purpose.  It may be a begging trick of some kind.'\n\n'I never saw a beggar less anxious to stay with his company, then.\nThere's the makings of a gay mystery here.  Ye believe in Providence,\nBennett?'\n\n'I hope so.'\n\n'Well, I believe in miracles, so it comes to the same thing.  Powers of\nDarkness!  Kimball O'Hara!  And his son!  But then he's a native, and I\nsaw Kimball married myself to Annie Shott.  How long have you had these\nthings, boy?'\n\n'Ever since I was a little baby.'\n\nFather Victor stepped forward quickly and opened the front of Kim's\nupper garment.  'You see, Bennett, he's not very black.  What's your\nname?'\n\n'Kim.'\n\n'Or Kimball?'\n\n'Perhaps.  Will you let me go away?'\n\n'What else?'\n\n'They call me Kim Rishti ke.  That is Kim of the Rishti.'\n\n'What is that--\"Rishti\"?'\n\n'Eye-rishti--that was the Regiment--my father's.'\n\n'Irish--oh, I see.'\n\n'Yess.  That was how my father told me.  My father, he has lived.'\n\n'Has lived where?'\n\n'Has lived.  Of course he is dead--gone-out.'\n\n'Oh!  That's your abrupt way of putting it, is it?'\n\nBennett interrupted.  'It is possible I have done the boy an injustice.\nHe is certainly white, though evidently neglected.  I am sure I must\nhave bruised him.  I do not think spirits--'\n\n'Get him a glass of sherry, then, and let him squat on the cot. Now,\nKim,' continued Father Victor, 'no one is going to hurt you. Drink that\ndown and tell us about yourself.  The truth, if you've no objection.'\n\nKim coughed a little as he put down the empty glass, and considered.\nThis seemed a time for caution and fancy.  Small boys who prowl about\ncamps are generally turned out after a whipping. But he had received no\nstripes; the amulet was evidently working in his favour, and it looked\nas though the Umballa horoscope and the few words that he could\nremember of his father's maunderings fitted in most miraculously.  Else\nwhy did the fat padre seem so impressed, and why the glass of hot\nyellow drink from the lean one?\n\n'My father, he is dead in Lahore city since I was very little.  The\nwoman, she kept kabarri shop near where the hire-carriages are.' Kim\nbegan with a plunge, not quite sure how far the truth would serve him.\n\n'Your mother?'\n\n'No!'--with a gesture of disgust.  'She went out when I was born. My\nfather, he got these papers from the Jadoo-Gher what do you call that?'\n(Bennett nodded) 'because he was in good-standing.  What do you call\nthat?'  (again Bennett nodded).  'My father told me that.  He said,\ntoo, and also the Brahmin who made the drawing in the dust at Umballa\ntwo days ago, he said, that I shall find a Red Bull on a green field\nand that the Bull shall help me.'\n\n'A phenomenal little liar,' muttered Bennett.\n\n'Powers of Darkness below, what a country!'  murmured Father Victor.\n'Go on, Kim.'\n\n'I did not thieve.  Besides, I am just now disciple of a very holy man.\nHe is sitting outside.  We saw two men come with flags, making the\nplace ready.  That is always so in a dream, or on account of\na--a--prophecy.  So I knew it was come true.  I saw the Red Bull on the\ngreen field, and my father he said:  \"Nine hundred pukka devils and the\nColonel riding on a horse will look after you when you find the Red\nBull!\"  I did not know what to do when I saw the Bull, but I went away\nand I came again when it was dark.  I wanted to see the Bull again, and\nI saw the Bull again with the--the Sahibs praying to it.  I think the\nBull shall help me.  The holy man said so too.  He is sitting outside.\nWill you hurt him, if I call him a shout now? He is very holy.  He can\nwitness to all the things I say, and he knows I am not a thief.'\n\n'\"Sahibs praying to a bull!\"  What in the world do you make of that?'\nsaid Bennett.  \"'Disciple of a holy man!\"  Is the boy mad?'\n\n'It's O'Hara's boy, sure enough.  O'Hara's boy leagued with all the\nPowers of Darkness.  It's very much what his father would have done if\nhe was drunk.  We'd better invite the holy man.  He may know something.'\n\n'He does not know anything,' said Kim.  'I will show you him if you\ncome.  He is my master.  Then afterwards we can go.'\n\n'Powers of Darkness!'  was all that Father Victor could say, as Bennett\nmarched off, with a firm hand on Kim's shoulder.\n\nThey found the lama where he had dropped.\n\n'The Search is at an end for me,' shouted Kim in the vernacular.  'I\nhave found the Bull, but God knows what comes next.  They will not hurt\nyou.  Come to the fat priest's tent with this thin man and see the end.\nIt is all new, and they cannot talk Hindi.  They are only uncurried\ndonkeys.'\n\n'Then it is not well to make a jest of their ignorance,' the lama\nreturned.  'I am glad if thou art rejoiced, chela.'\n\nDignified and unsuspicious, he strode into the little tent, saluted the\nChurches as a Churchman, and sat down by the open charcoal brazier.\nThe yellow lining of the tent reflected in the lamplight made his face\nred-gold.\n\nBennett looked at him with the triple-ringed uninterest of the creed\nthat lumps nine-tenths of the world under the title of 'heathen'.\n\n'And what was the end of the Search?  What gift has the Red Bull\nbrought?'  The lama addressed himself to Kim.\n\n'He says, \"What are you going to do?\"'  Bennett was staring uneasily at\nFather Victor, and Kim, for his own ends, took upon himself the office\nof interpreter.\n\n'I do not see what concern this fakir has with the boy, who is probably\nhis dupe or his confederate,' Bennett began.  'We cannot allow an\nEnglish boy--Assuming that he is the son of a Mason, the sooner he goes\nto the Masonic Orphanage the better.'\n\n'Ah!  That's your opinion as Secretary to the Regimental Lodge,' said\nFather Victor; 'but we might as well tell the old man what we are going\nto do.  He doesn't look like a villain.'\n\n'My experience is that one can never fathom the Oriental mind.  Now,\nKimball, I wish you to tell this man what I say word for word.'\n\nKim gathered the import of the next few sentences and began thus:\n\n'Holy One, the thin fool who looks like a camel says that I am the son\nof a Sahib.'\n\n'But how?'\n\n'Oh, it is true.  I knew it since my birth, but he could only find it\nout by rending the amulet from my neck and reading all the papers.  He\nthinks that once a Sahib is always a Sahib, and between the two of them\nthey purpose to keep me in this Regiment or to send me to a madrissah\n[a school].  It has happened before.  I have always avoided it.  The\nfat fool is of one mind and the camel-like one of another.  But that is\nno odds.  I may spend one night here and perhaps the next.  It has\nhappened before.  Then I will run away and return to thee.'\n\n'But tell them that thou art my chela.  Tell them how thou didst come\nto me when I was faint and bewildered.  Tell them of our Search, and\nthey will surely let thee go now.'\n\n'I have already told them.  They laugh, and they talk of the police.'\n\n'What are you saying?'  asked Mr Bennett.\n\n'Oah.  He only says that if you do not let me go it will stop him in\nhis business--his ur-gent private af-fairs.'  This last was a\nreminiscence of some talk with a Eurasian clerk in the Canal\nDepartment, but it only drew a smile, which nettled him.  'And if you\ndid know what his business was you would not be in such a beastly hurry\nto interfere.'\n\n'What is it then?'  said Father Victor, not without feeling, as he\nwatched the lama's face.\n\n'There is a River in this country which he wishes to find so verree\nmuch.  It was put out by an Arrow which--' Kim tapped his foot\nimpatiently as he translated in his own mind from the vernacular to his\nclumsy English.  'Oah, it was made by our Lord God Buddha, you know,\nand if you wash there you are washed away from all your sins and made\nas white as cotton-wool.'  (Kim had heard mission-talk in his time.) 'I\nam his disciple, and we must find that River.  It is so verree valuable\nto us.'\n\n'Say that again,' said Bennett.  Kim obeyed, with amplifications.\n\n'But this is gross blasphemy!'  cried the Church of England.\n\n'Tck!  Tck!'  said Father Victor sympathetically.  'I'd give a good\ndeal to be able to talk the vernacular.  A river that washes away sin!\nAnd how long have you two been looking for it?'\n\n'Oh, many days.  Now we wish to go away and look for it again.  It is\nnot here, you see.'\n\n'I see,' said Father Victor gravely.  'But he can't go on in that old\nman's company.  It would be different, Kim, if you were not a soldier's\nson.  Tell him that the Regiment will take care of you and make you as\ngood a man as your--as good a man as can be.  Tell him that if he\nbelieves in miracles he must believe that--'\n\n'There is no need to play on his credulity,' Bennett interrupted.\n\n'I'm doing no such thing.  He must believe that the boy's coming\nhere--to his own Regiment--in search of his Red Bull is in the nature\nof a miracle.  Consider the chances against it, Bennett.  This one boy\nin all India, and our Regiment of all others on the line o' march for\nhim to meet with!  It's predestined on the face of it. Yes, tell him\nit's Kismet.  Kismet, mallum?  [Do you understand?]'\n\nHe turned towards the lama, to whom he might as well have talked of\nMesopotamia.\n\n'They say,'--the old man's eye lighted at Kim's speech 'they say that\nthe meaning of my horoscope is now accomplished, and that being led\nback--though as thou knowest I went out of curiosity--to these people\nand their Red Bull I must needs go to a madrissah and be turned into a\nSahib.  Now I make pretence of agreement, for at the worst it will be\nbut a few meals eaten away from thee.  Then I will slip away and follow\ndown the road to Saharunpore. Therefore, Holy One, keep with that Kulu\nwoman--on no account stray far from her cart till I come again.  Past\nquestion, my sign is of War and of armed men.  See how they have given\nme wine to drink and set me upon a bed of honour!  My father must have\nbeen some great person.  So if they raise me to honour among them,\ngood. If not, good again.  However it goes, I will run back to thee\nwhen I am tired.  But stay with the Rajputni, or I shall miss thy feet\n... Oah yess,' said the boy, 'I have told him everything you tell me to\nsay.'\n\n'And I cannot see any need why he should wait,' said Bennett, feeling\nin his trouser-pocket.  'We can investigate the details later--and I\nwill give him a ru--'\n\n'Give him time.  Maybe he's fond of the lad,' said Father Victor, half\narresting the clergyman's motion.\n\nThe lama dragged forth his rosary and pulled his huge hat-brim over his\neyes.\n\n'What can he want now?'\n\n'He says'--Kim put up one hand.  'He says:  \"Be quiet.\"  He wants to\nspeak to me by himself.  You see, you do not know one little word of\nwhat he says, and I think if you talk he will perhaps give you very bad\ncurses.  When he takes those beads like that, you see, he always wants\nto be quiet.'\n\nThe two Englishmen sat overwhelmed, but there was a look in Bennett's\neye that promised ill for Kim when he should be relaxed to the\nreligious arm.\n\n'A Sahib and the son of a Sahib--' The lama's voice was harsh with\npain.  'But no white man knows the land and the customs of the land as\nthou knowest.  How comes it this is true?'\n\n'What matter, Holy One?--but remember it is only for a night or two.\nRemember, I can change swiftly.  It will all be as it was when I first\nspoke to thee under Zam-Zammah the great gun--'\n\n'As a boy in the dress of white men--when I first went to the Wonder\nHouse.  And a second time thou wast a Hindu.  What shall the third\nincarnation be?'  He chuckled drearily.  'Ah, chela, thou has done a\nwrong to an old man because my heart went out to thee.'\n\n'And mine to thee.  But how could I know that the Red Bull would bring\nme to this business?'\n\nThe lama covered his face afresh, and nervously rattled the rosary. Kim\nsquatted beside him and laid hold upon a fold of his clothing.\n\n'Now it is understood that the boy is a Sahib?'  he went on in a\nmuffled tone.  'Such a Sahib as was he who kept the images in the\nWonder House.'  The lama's experience of white men was limited.  He\nseemed to be repeating a lesson.  'So then it is not seemly that he\nshould do other than as the Sahibs do.  He must go back to his own\npeople.'\n\n'For a day and a night and a day,' Kim pleaded.\n\n'No, ye don't!'  Father Victor saw Kim edging towards the door, and\ninterposed a strong leg.\n\n'I do not understand the customs of white men.  The Priest of the\nImages in the Wonder House in Lahore was more courteous than the thin\none here.  This boy will be taken from me.  They will make a Sahib of\nmy disciple?  Woe to me!  How shall I find my River?  Have they no\ndisciples?  Ask.'\n\n'He says he is very sorree that he cannot find the River now any more.\nHe says, Why have you no disciples, and stop bothering him? He wants to\nbe washed of his sins.'\n\nNeither Bennett nor Father Victor found any answer ready.\n\nSaid Kim in English, distressed for the lama's agony:  'I think if you\nwill let me go now we will walk away quietly and not steal.  We will\nlook for that River like before I was caught.  I wish I did not come\nhere to find the Red Bull and all that sort of thing.  I do not want\nit.'\n\n'It's the very best day's work you ever did for yourself, young man,'\nsaid Bennett.\n\n'Good heavens, I don't know how to console him,' said Father Victor,\nwatching the lama intently.  'He can't take the boy away with him, and\nyet he's a good man--I'm sure he's a good man. Bennett, if you give him\nthat rupee he'll curse you root and branch!'\n\nThey listened to each other's breathing--three--five full minutes.\nThen the lama raised his head, and looked forth across them into space\nand emptiness.\n\n'And I am a Follower of the Way,' he said bitterly.  'The sin is mine\nand the punishment is mine.  I made believe to myself for now I see it\nwas but make-belief--that thou wast sent to me to aid in the Search.\nSo my heart went out to thee for thy charity and thy courtesy and the\nwisdom of thy little years.  But those who follow the Way must permit\nnot the fire of any desire or attachment, for that is all Illusion.  As\nsays ...'  He quoted an old, old Chinese text, backed it with another,\nand reinforced these with a third.  'I stepped aside from the Way, my\nchela.  It was no fault of thine.  I delighted in the sight of life,\nthe new people upon the roads, and in thy joy at seeing these things.\nI was pleased with thee who should have considered my Search and my\nSearch alone.  Now I am sorrowful because thou art taken away and my\nRiver is far from me. It is the Law which I have broken!'\n\n'Powers of Darkness below!'  said Father Victor, who, wise in the\nconfessional, heard the pain in every sentence.\n\n'I see now that the sign of the Red Bull was a sign for me as well as\nfor thee.  All Desire is red--and evil.  I will do penance and find my\nRiver alone.'\n\n'At least go back to the Kulu woman,' said Kim, 'otherwise thou wilt be\nlost upon the roads.  She will feed thee till I run back to thee.'\n\nThe lama waved a hand to show that the matter was finally settled in\nhis mind.\n\n'Now,'--his tone altered as he turned to Kim,--'what will they do with\nthee?  At least I may, acquiring merit, wipe out past ill.'\n\n'Make me a Sahib--so they think.  The day after tomorrow I return. Do\nnot grieve.'\n\n'Of what sort?  Such an one as this or that man?'  He pointed to Father\nVictor.  'Such an one as those I saw this evening, men wearing swords\nand stamping heavily?'\n\n'Maybe.'\n\n'That is not well.  These men follow desire and come to emptiness. Thou\nmust not be of their sort.'\n\n'The Umballa priest said that my Star was War,' Kim interjected.  'I\nwill ask these fools--but there is truly no need.  I will run away this\nnight, for all I wanted to see the new things.'\n\nKim put two or three questions in English to Father Victor, translating\nthe replies to the lama.\n\nThen:  'He says, \"You take him from me and you cannot say what you will\nmake him.\"  He says, \"Tell me before I go, for it is not a small thing\nto make a child.\"'\n\n'You will be sent to a school.  Later on, we shall see.  Kimball, I\nsuppose you'd like to be a soldier?'\n\n'Gorah-log [white-folk].  No-ah!  No-ah!'  Kim shook his head\nviolently.  There was nothing in his composition to which drill and\nroutine appealed.  'I will not be a soldier.'\n\n'You will be what you're told to be,' said Bennett; 'and you should be\ngrateful that we're going to help you.'\n\nKim smiled compassionately.  If these men lay under the delusion that\nhe would do anything that he did not fancy, so much the better.\n\nAnother long silence followed.  Bennett fidgeted with impatience, and\nsuggested calling a sentry to evict the fakir.\n\n'Do they give or sell learning among the Sahibs?  Ask them,' said the\nlama, and Kim interpreted.\n\n'They say that money is paid to the teacher--but that money the\nRegiment will give ...  What need?  It is only for a night.'\n\n'And--the more money is paid the better learning is given?'  The lama\ndisregarded Kim's plans for an early flight.  'It is no wrong to pay\nfor learning.  To help the ignorant to wisdom is always a merit.'  The\nrosary clicked furiously as an abacus.  Then he faced his oppressors.\n\n'Ask them for how much money do they give a wise and suitable teaching?\nAnd in what city is that teaching given?'\n\n'Well,' said Father Victor in English, when Kim had translated, 'that\ndepends.  The Regiment would pay for you all the time you are at the\nMilitary Orphanage; or you might go on the Punjab Masonic Orphanage's\nlist (not that he or you 'ud understand what that means); but the best\nschooling a boy can get in India is, of course, at St Xavier's in\nPartibus at Lucknow.'  This took some time to interpret, for Bennett\nwished to cut it short.\n\n'He wants to know how much?'  said Kim placidly.\n\n'Two or three hundred rupees a year.'  Father Victor was long past any\nsense of amazement.  Bennett, impatient, did not understand.\n\n'He says:  \"Write that name and the money upon a paper and give it\nhim.\"  And he says you must write your name below, because he is going\nto write a letter in some days to you.  He says you are a good man.  He\nsays the other man is a fool.  He is going away.'\n\nThe lama rose suddenly.  'I follow my Search,' he cried, and was gone.\n\n'He'll run slap into the sentries,' cried Father Victor, jumping up as\nthe lama stalked out; 'but I can't leave the boy.'  Kim made swift\nmotion to follow, but checked himself.  There was no sound of challenge\noutside.  The lama had disappeared.\n\nKim settled himself composedly on the Chaplain's cot.  At least the\nlama had promised that he would stay with the Raiput woman from Kulu,\nand the rest was of the smallest importance.  It pleased him that the\ntwo padres were so evidently excited.  They talked long in undertones,\nFather Victor urging some scheme on Mr Bennett, who seemed incredulous.\nAll this was very new and fascinating, but Kim felt sleepy.  They\ncalled men into the tent--one of them certainly was the Colonel, as his\nfather had prophesied--and they asked him an infinity of questions,\nchiefly about the woman who looked after him, all of which Kim answered\ntruthfully.  They did not seem to think the woman a good guardian.\n\nAfter all, this was the newest of his experiences.  Sooner or later, if\nhe chose, he could escape into great, grey, formless India, beyond\ntents and padres and colonels.  Meantime, if the Sahibs were to be\nimpressed, he would do his best to impress them.  He too was a white\nman.\n\nAfter much talk that he could not comprehend, they handed him over to a\nsergeant, who had strict instructions not to let him escape. The\nRegiment would go on to Umballa, and Kim would be sent up, partly at\nthe expense of the Lodge and in part by subscription, to a place called\nSanawar.\n\n'It's miraculous past all whooping, Colonel,' said Father Victor, when\nhe had talked without a break for ten minutes.  'His Buddhist friend\nhas levanted after taking my name and address.  I can't quite make out\nwhether he'll pay for the boy's education or whether he is preparing\nsome sort of witchcraft on his own account.'  Then to Kim: 'You'll live\nto be grateful to your friend the Red Bull yet.  We'll make a man of\nyou at Sanawar--even at the price o' making you a Protestant.'\n\n'Certainly--most certainly,' said Bennett.\n\n'But you will not go to Sanawar,' said Kim.\n\n'But we will go to Sanawar, little man.  That's the order of the\nCommander-in-Chief, who's a trifle more important than O'Hara's son.'\n\n'You will not go to Sanawar.  You will go to thee War.'\n\nThere was a shout of laughter from the full tent.\n\n'When you know your own Regiment a trifle better you won't confuse the\nline of march with line of battle, Kim.  We hope to go to \"thee War\"\nsometime.'\n\n'Oah, I know all thatt.'  Kim drew his bow again at a venture.  If they\nwere not going to the war, at least they did not know what he knew of\nthe talk in the veranda at Umballa.\n\n'I know you are not at thee war now; but I tell you that as soon as you\nget to Umballa you will be sent to the war--the new war.  It is a war\nof eight thousand men, besides the guns.'\n\n'That's explicit.  D'you add prophecy to your other gifts?  Take him\nalong, sergeant.  Take up a suit for him from the Drums, an' take care\nhe doesn't slip through your fingers.  Who says the age of miracles is\ngone by?  I think I'll go to bed.  My poor mind's weakening.'\n\nAt the far end of the camp, silent as a wild animal, an hour later sat\nKim, newly washed all over, in a horrible stiff suit that rasped his\narms and legs.\n\n'A most amazin' young bird,' said the sergeant.  'He turns up in charge\nof a yellow-headed buck-Brahmin priest, with his father's Lodge\ncertificates round his neck, talkin' God knows what all of a red bull.\nThe buck-Brahmin evaporates without explanations, an' the bhoy sets\ncross-legged on the Chaplain's bed prophesyin' bloody war to the men at\nlarge.  Injia's a wild land for a God-fearin' man. I'll just tie his\nleg to the tent-pole in case he'll go through the roof.  What did ye\nsay about the war?'\n\n'Eight thousand men, besides guns,' said Kim.  'Very soon you will see.'\n\n'You're a consolin' little imp.  Lie down between the Drums an' go to\nbye-bye.  Those two boys will watch your slumbers.'\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\n  Now I remember comrades--\n  Old playmates on new seas--\n  Whenas we traded orpiment\n  Among the savages.\n  Ten thousand leagues to southward,\n  And thirty years removed--\n  They knew not noble Valdez,\n  But me they knew and loved.\n\n  Song of Diego Valdez.\n\n\nVery early in the morning the white tents came down and disappeared as\nthe Mavericks took a side-road to Umballa.  It did not skirt the\nresting-place, and Kim, trudging beside a baggage-cart under fire of\ncomments from soldiers' wives, was not so confident as overnight.  He\ndiscovered that he was closely watched--Father Victor on the one side,\nand Mr Bennett on the other.\n\nIn the forenoon the column checked.  A camel-orderly handed the Colonel\na letter.  He read it, and spoke to a Major.  Half a mile in the rear,\nKim heard a hoarse and joyful clamour rolling down on him through the\nthick dust.  Then someone beat him on the back, crying: 'Tell us how ye\nknew, ye little limb of Satan?  Father dear, see if ye can make him\ntell.'\n\nA pony ranged alongside, and he was hauled on to the priest's saddlebow.\n\n'Now, my son, your prophecy of last night has come true.  Our orders\nare to entrain at Umballa for the Front tomorrow.'\n\n'What is thatt?'  said Kim, for 'front' and 'entrain' were newish words\nto him.\n\n'We are going to \"thee War,\" as you called it.'\n\n'Of course you are going to thee War.  I said last night.'\n\n'Ye did; but, Powers o' Darkness, how did ye know?'\n\nKim's eyes sparkled.  He shut his lips, nodded his head, and looked\nunspeakable things.  The Chaplain moved on through the dust, and\nprivates, sergeants, and subalterns called one another's attention to\nthe boy.  The Colonel, at the head of the column, stared at him\ncuriously.  'It was probably some bazar rumour.'  he said; 'but even\nthen--' He referred to the paper in his hand.  'Hang it all, the thing\nwas only decided within the last forty-eight hours.'\n\n'Are there many more like you in India?'  said Father Victor, 'or are\nyou by way o' being a lusus naturae?'\n\n'Now I have told you,' said the boy, 'will you let me go back to my old\nman?  If he has not stayed with that woman from Kulu, I am afraid he\nwill die.'\n\n'By what I saw of him he's as well able to take care of himself as you.\nNo.  Ye've brought us luck, an' we're goin' to make a man of you.  I'll\ntake ye back to your baggage-cart and ye'll come to me this evening.'\n\nFor the rest of the day Kim found himself an object of distinguished\nconsideration among a few hundred white men.  The story of his\nappearance in camp, the discovery of his parentage, and his prophecy,\nhad lost nothing in the telling.  A big, shapeless white woman on a\npile of bedding asked him mysteriously whether he thought her husband\nwould come back from the war.  Kim reflected gravely, and said that he\nwould, and the woman gave him food.  In many respects, this big\nprocession that played music at intervals--this crowd that talked and\nlaughed so easily--resembled a festival in Lahore city.  So far, there\nwas no sign of hard work, and he resolved to lend the spectacle his\npatronage.  At evening there came out to meet them bands of music, and\nplayed the Mavericks into camp near Umballa railway station.  That was\nan interesting night.  Men of other regiments came to visit the\nMavericks.  The Mavericks went visiting on their own account.  Their\npickets hurried forth to bring them back, met pickets of strange\nregiments on the same duty; and, after a while, the bugles blew madly\nfor more pickets with officers to control the tumult.  The Mavericks\nhad a reputation for liveliness to live up to.  But they fell in on the\nplatform next morning in perfect shape and condition; and Kim, left\nbehind with the sick, women, and boys, found himself shouting farewells\nexcitedly as the trains drew away.  Life as a Sahib was amusing so far;\nbut he touched it with a cautious hand.  Then they marched him back in\ncharge of a drummer-boy to empty, lime-washed barracks, whose floors\nwere covered with rubbish and string and paper, and whose ceilings gave\nback his lonely footfall.  Native-fashion, he curled himself up on a\nstripped cot and went to sleep.  An angry man stumped down the veranda,\nwoke him up, and said he was a schoolmaster.  This was enough for Kim,\nand he retired into his shell.  He could just puzzle out the various\nEnglish Police notices in Lahore city, because they affected his\ncomfort; and among the many guests of the woman who looked after him\nhad been a queer German who painted scenery for the Parsee travelling\ntheatre.  He told Kim that he had been 'on the barricades in\n'Forty-eight,' and therefore--at least that was how it struck Kim--he\nwould teach the boy to write in return for food.  Kim had been kicked\nas far as single letters, but did not think well of them.\n\n'I do not know anything.  Go away!'  said Kim, scenting evil. Hereupon\nthe man caught him by the ear, dragged him to a room in a far-off wing\nwhere a dozen drummer-boys were sitting on forms, and told him to be\nstill if he could do nothing else.  This he managed very successfully.\nThe man explained something or other with white lines on a black board\nfor at least half an hour, and Kim continued his interrupted nap.  He\nmuch disapproved of the present aspect of affairs, for this was the\nvery school and discipline he had spent two-thirds of his young life in\navoiding.  Suddenly a beautiful idea occurred to him, and he wondered\nthat he had not thought of it before.\n\nThe man dismissed them, and first to spring through the veranda into\nthe open sunshine was Kim.\n\n''Ere, you!  'Alt!  Stop!'  said a high voice at his heels.  'I've got\nto look after you.  My orders are not to let you out of my sight. Where\nare you goin'?'\n\nIt was the drummer-boy who had been hanging round him all the\nforenoon--a fat and freckled person of about fourteen, and Kim loathed\nhim from the soles of his boots to his cap-ribbons.\n\n'To the bazar--to get sweets--for you,' said Kim, after thought.\n\n'Well, the bazar's out o' bounds.  If we go there we'll get a\ndressing-down.  You come back.'\n\n'How near can we go?'  Kim did not know what bounds meant, but he\nwished to be polite--for the present.\n\n''Ow near?  'Ow far, you mean!  We can go as far as that tree down the\nroad.'\n\n'Then I will go there.'\n\n'All right.  I ain't goin'.  It's too 'ot.  I can watch you from 'ere.\nIt's no good your runnin' away.  If you did, they'd spot you by your\nclothes.  That's regimental stuff you're wearin'.  There ain't a picket\nin Umballa wouldn't 'ead you back quicker than you started out.'\n\nThis did not impress Kim as much as the knowledge that his raiment\nwould tire him out if he tried to run.  He slouched to the tree at the\ncorner of a bare road leading towards the bazar, and eyed the natives\npassing.  Most of them were barrack-servants of the lowest caste.  Kim\nhailed a sweeper, who promptly retorted with a piece of unnecessary\ninsolence, in the natural belief that the European boy could not follow\nit.  The low, quick answer undeceived him.  Kim put his fettered soul\ninto it, thankful for the late chance to abuse somebody in the tongue\nhe knew best.  'And now, go to the nearest letter-writer in the bazar\nand tell him to come here.  I would write a letter.'\n\n'But--but what manner of white man's son art thou to need a bazar\nletter-writer?  Is there not a schoolmaster in the barracks?'\n\n'Ay; and Hell is full of the same sort.  Do my order, you--you Od! Thy\nmother was married under a basket!  Servant of Lal Beg' (Kim knew the\nGod of the sweepers), 'run on my business or we will talk again.'\n\nThe sweeper shuffled off in haste.  'There is a white boy by the\nbarracks waiting under a tree who is not a white boy,' he stammered to\nthe first bazar letter-writer he came across.  'He needs thee.'\n\n'Will he pay?'  said the spruce scribe, gathering up his desk and pens\nand sealing-wax all in order.\n\n'I do not know.  He is not like other boys.  Go and see.  It is well\nworth.'\n\nKim danced with impatience when the slim young Kayeth hove in sight.\nAs soon as his voice could carry he cursed him volubly.\n\n'First I will take my pay,' the letter-writer said.  'Bad words have\nmade the price higher.  But who art thou, dressed in that fashion, to\nspeak in this fashion?'\n\n'Aha!  That is in the letter which thou shalt write.  Never was such a\ntale.  But I am in no haste.  Another writer will serve me.  Umballa\ncity is as full of them as is Lahore.'\n\n'Four annas,' said the writer, sitting down and spreading his cloth in\nthe shade of a deserted barrack-wing.\n\nMechanically Kim squatted beside him--squatted as only the natives\ncan--in spite of the abominable clinging trousers.\n\nThe writer regarded him sideways.\n\n'That is the price to ask of Sahibs,' said Kim.  'Now fix me a true\none.'\n\n'An anna and a half.  How do I know, having written the letter, that\nthou wilt not run away?'\n\nI must not go beyond this tree, and there is also the stamp to be\nconsidered.'\n\n'I get no commission on the price of the stamp.  Once more, what manner\nof white boy art thou?'\n\n'That shall be said in the letter, which is to Mahbub Ali, the\nhorse-dealer in the Kashmir Serai, at Lahore.  He is my friend.'\n\n'Wonder on wonder!'  murmured the letter-writer, dipping a reed in the\ninkstand.  'To be written in Hindi?'\n\n'Assuredly.  To Mahbub Ali then.  Begin!  I have come down with the old\nman as far as Umballa in the train.  At Umballa I carried the news of\nthe bay mare's pedigree.'  After what he had seen in the garden, he was\nnot going to write of white stallions.\n\n'Slower a little.  What has a bay mare to do ...  Is it Mahbub Ali, the\ngreat dealer?'\n\n'Who else?  I have been in his service.  Take more ink.  Again.  As the\norder was, so I did it.  We then went on foot towards Benares, but on\nthe third day we found a certain regiment.  Is that down?'\n\n'Ay, pulton,' murmured the writer, all ears.\n\n'I went into their camp and was caught, and by means of the charm about\nmy neck, which thou knowest, it was established that I was the son of\nsome man in the regiment:  according to the prophecy of the Red Bull,\nwhich thou knowest was common talk of our bazar.'  Kim waited for this\nshaft to sink into the letter-writer's heart, cleared his throat, and\ncontinued:  'A priest clothed me and gave me a new name ...  One\npriest, however, was a fool.  The clothes are very heavy, but I am a\nSahib and my heart is heavy too.  They send me to a school and beat me.\nI do not like the air and water here. Come then and help me, Mahbub\nAli, or send me some money, for I have not sufficient to pay the writer\nwho writes this.'\n\n'\"Who writes this.\"  It is my own fault that I was tricked.  Thou art\nas clever as Husain Bux that forged the Treasury stamps at Nucklao.\nBut what a tale!  What a tale!  Is it true by any chance?'\n\n'It does not profit to tell lies to Mahbub Ali.  It is better to help\nhis friends by lending them a stamp.  When the money comes I will\nrepay.'\n\nThe writer grunted doubtfully, but took a stamp out of his desk, sealed\nthe letter, handed it over to Kim, and departed.  Mahbub Ali's was a\nname of power in Umballa.\n\n'That is the way to win a good account with the Gods,' Kim shouted\nafter him.\n\n'Pay me twice over when the money comes,' the man cried over his\nshoulder.\n\n'What was you bukkin' to that nigger about?'  said the drummer-boy when\nKim returned to the veranda.  'I was watch-in' you.'\n\n'I was only talkin' to him.'\n\n'You talk the same as a nigger, don't you?'\n\n'No-ah!  No-ah!  I onlee speak a little.  What shall we do now?'\n\n'The bugles'll go for dinner in arf a minute.  My Gawd!  I wish I'd\ngone up to the Front with the Regiment.  It's awful doin' nothin' but\nschool down 'ere.  Don't you 'ate it?'\n\n'Oah yess!'\n\nI'd run away if I knew where to go to, but, as the men say, in this\nbloomin' Injia you're only a prisoner at large.  You can't desert\nwithout bein' took back at once.  I'm fair sick of it.'\n\n'You have been in Be--England?'\n\n'W'y, I only come out last troopin' season with my mother.  I should\nthink I 'ave been in England.  What a ignorant little beggar you are!\nYou was brought up in the gutter, wasn't you?'\n\n'Oah yess.  Tell me something about England.  My father he came from\nthere.'\n\nThough he would not say so, Kim of course disbelieved every word the\ndrummer-boy spoke about the Liverpool suburb which was his England.  It\npassed the heavy time till dinner--a most unappetizing meal served to\nthe boys and a few invalids in a corner of a barrack-room.  But that he\nhad written to Mahbub Ali, Kim would have been almost depressed.  The\nindifference of native crowds he was used to; but this strong\nloneliness among white men preyed on him. He was grateful when, in the\ncourse of the afternoon, a big soldier took him over to Father Victor,\nwho lived in another wing across another dusty parade-ground.  The\npriest was reading an English letter written in purple ink.  He looked\nat Kim more curiously than ever.\n\n'An' how do you like it, my son, as far as you've gone?  Not much, eh?\nIt must be hard--very hard on a wild animal.  Listen now.  I've an\namazin' epistle from your friend.'\n\n'Where is he?  Is he well?  Oah!  If he knows to write me letters, it\nis all right.'\n\n'You're fond of him then?'\n\n'Of course I am fond of him.  He was fond of me.'\n\n'It seems so by the look of this.  He can't write English, can he?'\n\n'Oah no.  Not that I know, but of course he found a letter-writer who\ncan write English verree well, and so he wrote.  I do hope you\nunderstand.'\n\n'That accounts for it.  D'you know anything about his money affairs?'\nKim's face showed that he did not.\n\n'How can I tell?'\n\n'That's what I'm askin'.  Now listen if you can make head or tail o'\nthis.  We'll skip the first part ...  It's written from Jagadhir Road\n...  \"Sitting on wayside in grave meditation, trusting to be favoured\nwith your Honour's applause of present step, which recommend your\nHonour to execute for Almighty God's sake.  Education is greatest\nblessing if of best sorts.  Otherwise no earthly use.\" Faith, the old\nman's hit the bull's-eye that time!  \"If your Honour condescending\ngiving my boy best educations Xavier\" (I suppose that's St Xavier's in\nPartibus) \"in terms of our conversation dated in your tent 15th\ninstant\" (a business-like touch there!) \"then Almighty God blessing\nyour Honour's succeedings to third an' fourth generation and\"--now\nlisten!--\"confide in your Honour's humble servant for adequate\nremuneration per hoondi per annum three hundred rupees a year to one\nexpensive education St Xavier, Lucknow, and allow small time to forward\nsame per hoondi sent to any part of India as your Honour shall address\nyourself.  This servant of your Honour has presently no place to lay\ncrown of his head, but going to Benares by train on account of\npersecution of old woman talking so much and unanxious residing\nSaharunpore in any domestic capacity.\"  Now what in the world does that\nmean?'\n\n'She has asked him to be her puro--her clergyman--at Saharunpore, I\nthink.  He would not do that on account of his River.  She did talk.'\n\n'It's clear to you, is it?  It beats me altogether.  \"So going to\nBenares, where will find address and forward rupees for boy who is\napple of eye, and for Almighty God's sake execute this education, and\nyour petitioner as in duty bound shall ever awfully pray. Written by\nSobrao Satai, Failed Entrance Allahabad University, for Venerable\nTeshoo Lama the priest of Such-zen looking for a River, address care of\nTirthankars' Temple, Benares.  P. M.--Please note boy is apple of eye,\nand rupees shall be sent per hoondi three hundred per annum.  For God\nAlmighty's sake.\"  Now, is that ravin' lunacy or a business\nproposition?  I ask you, because I'm fairly at my wits' end.'\n\n'He says he will give me three hundred rupees a year?  So he will give\nme them.'\n\n'Oh, that's the way you look at it, is it?'\n\n'Of course.  If he says so!'\n\nThe priest whistled; then he addressed Kim as an equal.  'I don't\nbelieve it; but we'll see.  You were goin' off today to the Military\nOrphanage at Sanawar, where the Regiment would keep you till you were\nold enough to enlist.  Ye'd be brought up to the Church of England.\nBennett arranged for that.  On the other hand, if ye go to St Xavier's\nye'll get a better education an--an can have the religion.  D'ye see my\ndilemma?  Kim saw nothing save a vision of the lama going south in a\ntrain with none to beg for him.\n\n'Like most people, I'm going to temporize.  If your friend sends the\nmoney from Benares--Powers of Darkness below, where's a street-beggar\nto raise three hundred rupees?--ye'll go down to Lucknow and I'll pay\nyour fare, because I can't touch the subscription-money if I intend, as\nI do, to make ye a Catholic.  If he doesn't, ye'll go to the Military\nOrphanage at the Regiment's expense.  I'll allow him three days' grace,\nthough I don't believe it at all.  Even then, if he fails in his\npayments later on ...  but it's beyond me.  We can only walk one step\nat a time in this world, praise God! An' they sent Bennett to the Front\nan' left me behind.  Bennett can't expect everything.'\n\n'Oah yess,' said Kim vaguely.\n\nThe priest leaned forward.  'I'd give a month's pay to find what's\ngoin' on inside that little round head of yours.'\n\n'There is nothing,' said Kim, and scratched it.  He was wondering\nwhether Mahbub Ali would send him as much as a whole rupee.  Then he\ncould pay the letter-writer and write letters to the lama at Benares.\nPerhaps Mahbub Ali would visit him next time he came south with horses.\nSurely he must know that Kim's delivery of the letter to the officer at\nUmballa had caused the great war which the men and boys had discussed\nso loudly over the barrack dinner-tables. But if Mahbub Ali did not\nknow this, it would be very unsafe to tell him so.  Mahbub Ali was hard\nupon boys who knew, or thought they knew, too much.\n\n'Well, till I get further news'--Father Victor's voice interrupted the\nreverie.  'Ye can run along now and play with the other boys. They'll\nteach ye something--but I don't think ye'll like it.'\n\nThe day dragged to its weary end.  When he wished to sleep he was\ninstructed how to fold up his clothes and set out his boots; the other\nboys deriding.  Bugles waked him in the dawn; the schoolmaster caught\nhim after breakfast, thrust a page of meaningless characters under his\nnose, gave them senseless names and whacked him without reason.  Kim\nmeditated poisoning him with opium borrowed from a barrack-sweeper, but\nreflected that, as they all ate at one table in public (this was\npeculiarly revolting to Kim, who preferred to turn his back on the\nworld at meals), the stroke might be dangerous. Then he attempted\nrunning off to the village where the priest had tried to drug the\nlama--the village where the old soldier lived.  But far-seeing sentries\nat every exit headed back the little scarlet figure. Trousers and\njacket crippled body and mind alike so he abandoned the project and\nfell back, Oriental-fashion, on time and chance.  Three days of torment\npassed in the big, echoing white rooms.  He walked out of afternoons\nunder escort of the drummer-boy, and all he heard from his companions\nwere the few useless words which seemed to make two-thirds of the white\nman's abuse.  Kim knew and despised them all long ago.  The boy\nresented his silence and lack of interest by beating him, as was only\nnatural.  He did not care for any of the bazars which were in bounds.\nHe styled all natives 'niggers'; yet servants and sweepers called him\nabominable names to his face, and, misled by their deferential\nattitude, he never understood.  This somewhat consoled Kim for the\nbeatings.\n\nOn the morning of the fourth day a judgement overtook that drummer.\nThey had gone out together towards Umballa racecourse.  He returned\nalone, weeping, with news that young O'Hara, to whom he had been doing\nnothing in particular, had hailed a scarlet-bearded nigger on\nhorseback; that the nigger had then and there laid into him with a\npeculiarly adhesive quirt, picked up young O'Hara, and borne him off at\nfull gallop.  These tidings came to Father Victor, and he drew down his\nlong upper lip.  He was already sufficiently startled by a letter from\nthe Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares, enclosing a native banker's\nnote of hand for three hundred rupees, and an amazing prayer to\n'Almighty God'.  The lama would have been more annoyed than the priest\nhad he known how the bazar letter-writer had translated his phrase 'to\nacquire merit.'\n\n'Powers of Darkness below!'  Father Victor fumbled with the note. 'An'\nnow he's off with another of his peep-o'-day friends.  I don't know\nwhether it will be a greater relief to me to get him back or to have\nhim lost.  He's beyond my comprehension.  How the Divil--yes, he's the\nman I mean--can a street-beggar raise money to educate white boys?'\n\nThree miles off, on Umballa racecourse, Mahbub Ali, reining a grey\nKabuli stallion with Kim in front of him, was saying:\n\n'But, Little Friend of all the World, there is my honour and reputation\nto be considered.  All the officer-Sahibs in all the regiments, and all\nUmballa, know Mahbub Ali.  Men saw me pick thee up and chastise that\nboy.  We are seen now from far across this plain.  How can I take thee\naway, or account for thy disappearing if I set thee down and let thee\nrun off into the crops?  They would put me in jail.  Be patient.  Once\na Sahib, always a Sahib.  When thou art a man--who knows?--thou wilt be\ngrateful to Mahbub Ali.'\n\n'Take me beyond their sentries where I can change this red.  Give me\nmoney and I will go to Benares and be with my lama again.  I do not\nwant to be a Sahib, and remember I did deliver that message.'\n\nThe stallion bounded wildly.  Mahbub Ali had incautiously driven home\nthe sharp-edged stirrup.  (He was not the new sort of fluent\nhorse-dealer who wears English boots and spurs.) Kim drew his own\nconclusions from that betrayal.\n\n'That was a small matter.  It lay on the straight road to Benares.  I\nand the Sahib have by this time forgotten it.  I send so many letters\nand messages to men who ask questions about horses, I cannot well\nremember one from the other.  Was it some matter of a bay mare that\nPeters Sahib wished the pedigree of?'\n\nKim saw the trap at once.  If he had said 'bay mare' Mahbub would have\nknown by his very readiness to fall in with the amendment that the boy\nsuspected something.  Kim replied therefore:\n\n'Bay mare.  No.  I do not forget my messages thus.  It was a white\nstallion.'\n\n'Ay, so it was.  A white Arab stallion.  But thou didst write \"bay\nmare\" to me.'\n\n'Who cares to tell truth to a letter-writer?'  Kim answered, feeling\nMahbub's palm on his heart.\n\n'Hi!  Mahbub, you old villain, pull up!'  cried a voice, and an\nEnglishman raced alongside on a little polo-pony.  'I've been chasing\nyou half over the country.  That Kabuli of yours can go.  For sale, I\nsuppose?'\n\n'I have some young stuff coming on made by Heaven for the delicate and\ndifficult polo-game.  He has no equal.  He--'\n\n'Plays polo and waits at table.  Yes.  We know all that.  What the\ndeuce have you got there?'\n\n'A. boy,' said Mahbub gravely.  'He was being beaten by another boy.\nHis father was once a white soldier in the big war.  The boy was a\nchild in Lahore city.  He played with my horses when he was a babe. Now\nI think they will make him a soldier.  He has been newly caught by his\nfather's Regiment that went up to the war last week.  But I do not\nthink he wants to be a soldier.  I take him for a ride.  Tell me where\nthy barracks are and I will set thee there.'\n\n'Let me go.  I can find the barracks alone.'\n\n'And if thou runnest away who will say it is not my fault?'\n\n'He'll run back to his dinner.  Where has he to run to?'  the\nEnglishman asked.\n\n'He was born in the land.  He has friends.  He goes where he chooses.\nHe is a chabuk sawai [a sharp chap].  It needs only to change his\nclothing, and in a twinkling he would be a low-caste Hindu boy.'\n\n'The deuce he would!'  The Englishman looked critically at the boy as\nMahbub headed towards the barracks.  Kim ground his teeth.  Mahbub was\nmocking him, as faithless Afghans will; for he went on:\n\n'They will send him to a school and put heavy boots on his feet and\nswaddle him in these clothes.  Then he will forget all he knows. Now,\nwhich of the barracks is thine?'\n\nKim pointed--he could not speak--to Father Victor's wing, all staring\nwhite near by.\n\n'Perhaps he will make a good soldier,' said Mahbub reflectively.\n\n'He will make a good orderly at least.  I sent him to deliver a message\nonce from Lahore.  A message concerning the pedigree of a white\nstallion.'\n\nHere was deadly insult on deadlier injury--and the Sahib to whom he had\nso craftily given that war-waking letter heard it all.  Kim beheld\nMahbub Ali frying in flame for his treachery, but for himself he saw\none long grey vista of barracks, schools, and barracks again.  He gazed\nimploringly at the clear-cut face in which there was no glimmer of\nrecognition; but even at this extremity it never occurred to him to\nthrow himself on the white man's mercy or to denounce the Afghan.  And\nMahbub stared deliberately at the Englishman, who stared as\ndeliberately at Kim, quivering and tongue-tied.\n\n'My horse is well trained,' said the dealer.  'Others would have\nkicked, Sahib.'\n\n'Ah,' said the Englishman at last, rubbing his pony's damp withers with\nhis whip-butt.  'Who makes the boy a soldier?'\n\n'He says the Regiment that found him, and especially the Padre-sahib of\nthat regiment.\n\n'There is the Padre!'  Kim choked as bare-headed Father Victor sailed\ndown upon them from the veranda.\n\n'Powers O' Darkness below, O'Hara!  How many more mixed friends do you\nkeep in Asia?'  he cried, as Kim slid down and stood helplessly before\nhim.\n\n'Good morning, Padre,' the Englishman said cheerily.  'I know you by\nreputation well enough.  Meant to have come over and called before\nthis.  I'm Creighton.'\n\n'Of the Ethnological Survey?'  said Father Victor.  The Englishman\nnodded.  'Faith, I'm glad to meet ye then; an' I owe you some thanks\nfor bringing back the boy.'\n\n'No thanks to me, Padre.  Besides, the boy wasn't going away.  You\ndon't know old Mahbub Ali.'  The horse-dealer sat impassive in the\nsunlight.  'You will when you have been in the station a month.  He\nsells us all our crocks.  That boy is rather a curiosity.  Can you tell\nme anything about him?'\n\n'Can I tell you?'  puffed Father Victor.  'You'll be the one man that\ncould help me in my quandaries.  Tell you!  Powers o' Darkness, I'm\nbursting to tell someone who knows something o' the native!'\n\nA groom came round the corner.  Colonel Creighton raised his voice,\nspeaking in Urdu.  'Very good, Mahbub Ali, but what is the use of\ntelling me all those stories about the pony?  Not one pice more than\nthree hundred and fifty rupees will I give.'\n\n'The Sahib is a little hot and angry after riding,' the horse-dealer\nreturned, with the leer of a privileged jester.  'Presently, he will\nsee my horse's points more clearly.  I will wait till he has finished\nhis talk with the Padre.  I will wait under that tree.'\n\n'Confound you!'  The Colonel laughed.  'That comes of looking at one of\nMahbub's horses.  He's a regular old leech, Padre.  Wait, then, if thou\nhast so much time to spare, Mahbub.  Now I'm at your service, Padre.\nWhere is the boy?  Oh, he's gone off to collogue with Mahbub. Queer\nsort of boy.  Might I ask you to send my mare round under cover?'\n\nHe dropped into a chair which commanded a clear view of Kim and Mahbub\nAli in conference beneath the tree.  The Padre went indoors for\ncheroots.\n\nCreighton heard Kim say bitterly:  'Trust a Brahmin before a snake, and\na snake before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub Ali.'\n\n'That is all one.'  The great red beard wagged solemnly.  'Children\nshould not see a carpet on the loom till the pattern is made plain.\nBelieve me, Friend of all the World, I do thee great service.  They\nwill not make a soldier of thee.'\n\n'You crafty old sinner!'  thought Creighton.  'But you're not far\nwrong.  That boy mustn't be wasted if he is as advertised.'\n\n'Excuse me half a minute,' cried the Padre from within, 'but I'm\ngettin' the documents in the case.'\n\n'If through me the favour of this bold and wise Colonel Sahib comes to\nthee, and thou art raised to honour, what thanks wilt thou give Mahbub\nAli when thou art a man?'\n\n'Nay, nay!  I begged thee to let me take the Road again, where I should\nhave been safe; and thou hast sold me back to the English. What will\nthey give thee for blood-money?'\n\n'A cheerful young demon!'  The Colonel bit his cigar, and turned\npolitely to Father Victor.\n\n'What are the letters that the fat priest is waving before the Colonel?\nStand behind the stallion as though looking at my bridle!' said Mahbub\nAli.\n\n'A letter from my lama which he wrote from Jagadhir Road, saying that\nhe will pay three hundred rupees by the year for my schooling.'\n\n'Oho!  Is old Red Hat of that sort?  At which school?'\n\n'God knows.  I think in Nucklao.'\n\n'Yes.  There is a big school there for the sons of Sahibs--and\nhalf-Sahibs.  I have seen it when I sell horses there.  So the lama\nalso loved the Friend of all the World?'\n\n'Ay; and he did not tell lies, or return me to captivity.'\n\n'Small wonder the Padre does not know how to unravel the thread. How\nfast he talks to the Colonel Sahib!'  Mahbub Ali chuckled.  'By Allah!'\nthe keen eyes swept the veranda for an Instant--'thy lama has sent what\nto me looks like a note of hand.  I have had some few dealings in\nhoondis.  The Colonel Sahib is looking at it.'\n\n'What good is all this to me?'  said Kim wearily.  'Thou wilt go away,\nand they will return me to those empty rooms where there is no good\nplace to sleep and where the boys beat me.'\n\n'I do not think that.  Have patience, child.  All Pathans are not\nfaithless--except in horseflesh.'\n\nFive--ten--fifteen minutes passed, Father Victor talking energetically\nor asking questions which the Colonel answered.\n\n'Now I've told you everything that I know about the boy from beginnin\nto end; and it's a blessed relief to me.  Did ye ever hear the like?'\n\n'At any rate, the old man has sent the money.  Gobind Sahai's notes of\nhand are good from here to China,' said the Colonel.  'The more one\nknows about natives the less can one say what they will or won't do.'\n\n'That's consolin'--from the head of the Ethnological Survey.  It's this\nmixture of Red Bulls and Rivers of Healing (poor heathen, God help\nhim!) an' notes of hand and Masonic certificates.  Are you a Mason, by\nany chance?'\n\n'By Jove, I am, now I come to think of it.  That's an additional\nreason,' said the Colonel absently.\n\n'I'm glad ye see a reason in it.  But as I said, it's the mixture o'\nthings that's beyond me.  An' his prophesyin' to our Colonel, sitting\non my bed with his little shimmy torn open showing his white skin; an'\nthe prophecy comin' true!  They'll cure all that nonsense at St\nXavier's, eh?'\n\n'Sprinkle him with holy water,' the Colonel laughed.\n\n'On my word, I fancy I ought to sometimes.  But I'm hoping he'll be\nbrought up as a good Catholic.  All that troubles me is what'll happen\nif the old beggar-man--'\n\n'Lama, lama, my dear sir; and some of them are gentlemen in their own\ncountry.'\n\n'The lama, then, fails to pay next year.  He's a fine business head to\nplan on the spur of the moment, but he's bound to die some day. An'\ntakin' a heathen's money to give a child a Christian education--'\n\n'But he said explicitly what he wanted.  As soon as he knew the boy was\nwhite he seems to have made his arrangements accordingly.  I'd give a\nmonth's pay to hear how he explained it all at the Tirthankars' Temple\nat Benares.  Look here, Padre, I don't pretend to know much about\nnatives, but if he says he'll pay, he'll pay--dead or alive.  I mean,\nhis heirs will assume the debt.  My advice to you is, send the boy down\nto Lucknow.  If your Anglican Chaplain thinks you've stolen a march on\nhim--'\n\n'Bad luck to Bennett!  He was sent to the Front instead o' me. Doughty\ncertified me medically unfit.  I'll excommunicate Doughty if he comes\nback alive!  Surely Bennett ought to be content with--'\n\n'Glory, leaving you the religion.  Quite so!  As a matter of fact I\ndon't think Bennett will mind.  Put the blame on me.  I--er--strongly\nrecommend sending the boy to St Xavier's.  He can go down on pass as a\nsoldier's orphan, so the railway fare will be saved. You can buy him an\noutfit from the Regimental subscription.  The Lodge will be saved the\nexpense of his education, and that will put the Lodge in a good temper.\nIt's perfectly easy.  I've got to go down to Lucknow next week.  I'll\nlook after the boy on the way--give him in charge of my servants, and\nso on.'\n\n'You're a good man.'\n\n'Not in the least.  Don't make that mistake.  The lama has sent us\nmoney for a definite end.  We can't very well return it.  We shall have\nto do as he says.  Well, that's settled, isn't it?  Shall we say that,\nTuesday next, you'll hand him over to me at the night train south?\nThat's only three days.  He can't do much harm in three days.'\n\n'It's a weight off my mind, but--this thing here?'--he waved the note\nof hand--'I don't know Gobind Sahai:  or his bank, which may be a hole\nin a wall.'\n\n'You've never been a subaltern in debt.  I'll cash it if you like, and\nsend you the vouchers in proper order.'\n\n'But with all your own work too!  It's askin'--'\n\n'It's not the least trouble indeed.  You see, as an ethnologist, the\nthing's very interesting to me.  I'd like to make a note of it for some\nGovernment work that I'm doing.  The transformation of a regimental\nbadge like your Red Bull into a sort of fetish that the boy follows is\nvery interesting.'\n\n'But I can't thank you enough.'\n\n'There's one thing you can do.  All we Ethnological men are as jealous\nas jackdaws of one another's discoveries.  They're of no interest to\nanyone but ourselves, of course, but you know what book-collectors are\nlike.  Well, don't say a word, directly or indirectly, about the\nAsiatic side of the boy's character--his adventures and his prophecy,\nand so on.  I'll worm them out of the boy later on and--you see?'\n\n'I do.  Ye'll make a wonderful account of it.  Never a word will I say\nto anyone till I see it in print.'\n\n'Thank you.  That goes straight to an ethnologist's heart.  Well, I\nmust be getting back to my breakfast.  Good Heavens!  Old Mahbub here\nstill?'  He raised his voice, and the horse-dealer came out from under\nthe shadow of the tree, 'Well, what is it?'\n\n'As regards that young horse,' said Mahbub, 'I say that when a colt is\nborn to be a polo-pony, closely following the ball without\nteaching--when such a colt knows the game by divination--then I say it\nis a great wrong to break that colt to a heavy cart, Sahib!'\n\n'So say I also, Mahbub.  The colt will be entered for polo only. (These\nfellows think of nothing in the world but horses, Padre.) I'll see you\ntomorrow, Mahbub, if you've anything likely for sale.'\n\nThe dealer saluted, horseman-fashion, with a sweep of the off hand. 'Be\npatient a little, Friend of all the World,' he whispered to the\nagonized Kim.  'Thy fortune is made.  In a little while thou goest to\nNucklao, and--here is something to pay the letter-writer. I shall see\nthee again, I think, many times,' and he cantered off down the road.\n\n'Listen to me,' said the Colonel from the veranda, speaking in the\nvernacular.  'In three days thou wilt go with me to Lucknow, seeing and\nhearing new things all the while.  Therefore sit still for three days\nand do not run away.  Thou wilt go to school at Lucknow.'\n\n'Shall I meet my Holy One there?'  Kim whimpered.\n\n'At least Lucknow is nearer to Benares than Umballa.  It may be thou\nwilt go under my protection.  Mahbub Ali knows this, and he will be\nangry if thou returnest to the Road now.  Remember--much has been told\nme which I do not forget.'\n\n'I will wait,' said Kim, 'but the boys will beat me.'\n\nThen the bugles blew for dinner.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\n  Unto whose use the pregnant suns are poised\n  With idiot moons and stars retracing stars?\n  Creep thou betweene--thy coming's all unnoised.\n  Heaven hath her high, as Earth her baser, wars.\n  Heir to these tumults, this affright, that fraye\n  (By Adam's, fathers', own, sin bound alway);\n  Peer up, draw out thy horoscope and say\n  Which planet mends thy threadbare fate or mars?\n\n  Sir John Christie.\n\n\nIn the afternoon the red-faced schoolmaster told Kim that he had been\n'struck off the strength', which conveyed no meaning to him till he was\nordered to go away and play.  Then he ran to the bazar, and found the\nyoung letter-writer to whom he owed a stamp.\n\n'Now I pay,' said Kim royally, 'and now I need another letter to be\nwritten.'\n\n'Mahbub Ali is in Umballa,' said the writer jauntily.  He was, by\nvirtue of his office, a bureau of general misinformation.\n\n'This is not to Mahbub, but to a priest.  Take thy pen and write\nquickly.  To Teshoo Lama, the Holy One from Bhotiyal seeking for a\nRiver, who is now in the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares.  Take\nmore ink!  In three days I am to go down to Nucklao to the school at\nNucklao.  The name of the school is Xavier.  I do not know where that\nschool is, but it is at Nucklao.'\n\n'But I know Nucklao,' the writer interrupted.  'I know the school.'\n\n'Tell him where it is, and I give half an anna.'\n\nThe reed pen scratched busily.  'He cannot mistake.'  The man lifted\nhis head.  'Who watches us across the street?'\n\nKim looked up hurriedly and saw Colonel Creighton in tennis-flannels.\n\n'Oh, that is some Sahib who knows the fat priest in the barracks. He is\nbeckoning me.'\n\n'What dost thou?'  said the Colonel, when Kim trotted up.\n\n'I--I am not running away.  I send a letter to my Holy One at Benares.'\n\n'I had not thought of that.  Hast thou said that I take thee to\nLucknow?'\n\n'Nay, I have not.  Read the letter, if there be a doubt.'\n\n'Then why hast thou left out my name in writing to that Holy One?' The\nColonel smiled a queer smile.  Kim took his courage in both hands.\n\n'It was said once to me that it is inexpedient to write the names of\nstrangers concerned in any matter, because by the naming of names many\ngood plans are brought to confusion.'\n\n'Thou hast been well taught,' the Colonel replied, and Kim flushed. 'I\nhave left my cheroot-case in the Padre's veranda.  Bring it to my house\nthis even.'\n\n'Where is the house?'  said Kim.  His quick wit told him that he was\nbeing tested in some fashion or another, and he stood on guard.\n\n'Ask anyone in the big bazar.'  The Colonel walked on.\n\n'He has forgotten his cheroot-case,' said Kim, returning.  'I must\nbring it to him this evening.  That is all my letter except, thrice\nover, Come to me!  Come to me!  Come to me!  Now I will pay for a stamp\nand put it in the post.  He rose to go, and as an afterthought asked:\n'Who is that angry-faced Sahib who lost the cheroot-case?'\n\n'Oh, he is only Creighton Sahib--a very foolish Sahib, who is a Colonel\nSahib without a regiment.'\n\n'What is his business?'\n\n'God knows.  He is always buying horses which he cannot ride, and\nasking riddles about the works of God--such as plants and stones and\nthe customs of people.  The dealers call him the father of fools,\nbecause he is so easily cheated about a horse.  Mahbub Ali says he is\nmadder than most other Sahibs.'\n\n'Oh!'  said Kim, and departed.  His training had given him some small\nknowledge of character, and he argued that fools are not given\ninformation which leads to calling out eight thousand men besides guns.\nThe Commander-in-Chief of all India does not talk, as Kim had heard him\ntalk, to fools.  Nor would Mahbub Ali's tone have changed, as it did\nevery time he mentioned the Colonel's name, if the Colonel had been a\nfool.  Consequently--and this set Kim to skipping--there was a mystery\nsomewhere, and Mahbub Ali probably spied for the Colonel much as Kim\nhad spied for Mahbub.  And, like the horse-dealer, the Colonel\nevidently respected people who did not show themselves to be too clever.\n\n\nHe rejoiced that he had not betrayed his knowledge of the Colonel's\nhouse; and when, on his return to barracks, he discovered that no\ncheroot-case had been left behind, he beamed with delight.  Here was a\nman after his own heart--a tortuous and indirect person playing a\nhidden game.  Well, if he could be a fool, so could Kim.\n\nHe showed nothing of his mind when Father Victor, for three long\nmornings, discoursed to him of an entirely new set of Gods and\nGodlings--notably of a Goddess called Mary, who, he gathered, was one\nwith Bibi Miriam of Mahbub Ali's theology.  He betrayed no emotion\nwhen, after the lecture, Father Victor dragged him from shop to shop\nbuying articles of outfit, nor when envious drummer-boys kicked him\nbecause he was going to a superior school did he complain, but awaited\nthe play of circumstances with an interested soul.  Father Victor, good\nman, took him to the station, put him into an empty second-class next\nto Colonel Creighton's first, and bade him farewell with genuine\nfeeling.\n\n'They'll make a man o' you, O'Hara, at St Xavier's--a white man, an', I\nhope, a good man.  They know all about your comin', an' the Colonel\nwill see that ye're not lost or mislaid anywhere on the road.  I've\ngiven you a notion of religious matters,--at least I hope so,--and\nyou'll remember, when they ask you your religion, that you're a\nCath'lic.  Better say Roman Cath'lic, tho' I'm not fond of the word.'\n\nKim lit a rank cigarette--he had been careful to buy a stock in the\nbazar--and lay down to think.  This solitary passage was very different\nfrom that joyful down-journey in the third-class with the lama.\n'Sahibs get little pleasure of travel,' he reflected.\n\n'Hai mai!  I go from one place to another as it might be a kickball. It\nis my Kismet.  No man can escape his Kismet.  But I am to pray to Bibi\nMiriam, and I am a Sahib.'  He looked at his boots ruefully. 'No; I am\nKim.  This is the great world, and I am only Kim.  Who is Kim?'  He\nconsidered his own identity, a thing he had never done before, till his\nhead swam.  He was one insignificant person in all this roaring whirl\nof India, going southward to he knew not what fate.\n\nPresently the Colonel sent for him, and talked for a long time.  So far\nas Kim could gather, he was to be diligent and enter the Survey of\nIndia as a chain-man.  If he were very good, and passed the proper\nexaminations, he would be earning thirty rupees a month at seventeen\nyears old, and Colonel Creighton would see that he found suitable\nemployment.\n\nKim pretended at first to understand perhaps one word in three of this\ntalk.  Then the Colonel, seeing his mistake, turned to fluent and\npicturesque Urdu and Kim was contented.  No man could be a fool who\nknew the language so intimately, who moved so gently and silently, and\nwhose eyes were so different from the dull fat eyes of other Sahibs.\n\n'Yes, and thou must learn how to make pictures of roads and mountains\nand rivers, to carry these pictures in thine eye till a suitable time\ncomes to set them upon paper.  Perhaps some day, when thou art a\nchain-man, I may say to thee when we are working together:  \"Go across\nthose hills and see what lies beyond.\"  Then one will say:  \"There are\nbad people living in those hills who will slay the chain-man if he be\nseen to look like a Sahib.\"  What then?'\n\nKim thought.  Would it be safe to return the Colonel's lead?\n\n'I would tell what that other man had said.'\n\n'But if I answered:  \"I will give thee a hundred rupees for knowledge\nof what is behind those hills--for a picture of a river and a little\nnews of what the people say in the villages there\"?'\n\n'How can I tell?  I am only a boy.  Wait till I am a man.'  Then,\nseeing the Colonel's brow clouded, he went on:  'But I think I should\nin a few days earn the hundred rupees.'\n\n'By what road?'\n\nKim shook his head resolutely.  'If I said how I would earn them,\nanother man might hear and forestall me.  It is not good to sell\nknowledge for nothing.'\n\n'Tell now.'  The Colonel held up a rupee.  Kim's hand half reached\ntowards it, and dropped.\n\n'Nay, Sahib; nay.  I know the price that will be paid for the answer,\nbut I do not know why the question is asked.'\n\n'Take it for a gift, then,' said Creighton, tossing it over.  'There is\na good spirit in thee.  Do not let it be blunted at St Xavier's. There\nare many boys there who despise the black men.'\n\n'Their mothers were bazar-women,' said Kim.  He knew well there is no\nhatred like that of the half-caste for his brother-in-law.\n\n'True; but thou art a Sahib and the son of a Sahib.  Therefore, do not\nat any time be led to contemn the black men.  I have known boys newly\nentered into the service of the Government who feigned not to\nunderstand the talk or the customs of black men.  Their pay was cut for\nignorance.  There is no sin so great as ignorance.  Remember this.'\n\nSeveral times in the course of the long twenty-four hours' run south\ndid the Colonel send for Kim, always developing this latter text.\n\n'We be all on one lead-rope, then,' said Kim at last, 'the Colonel,\nMahbub Ali, and I--when I become a chain-man.  He will use me as Mahbub\nAli employed me, I think.  That is good, if it allows me to return to\nthe Road again.  This clothing grows no easier by wear.'\n\nWhen they came to the crowded Lucknow station there was no sign of the\nlama.  He swallowed his disappointment, while the Colonel bundled him\ninto a ticca-gharri with his neat belongings and despatched him alone\nto St Xavier's.\n\n'I do not say farewell, because we shall meet again,' he cried. 'Again,\nand many times, if thou art one of good spirit.  But thou art not yet\ntried.'\n\n'Not when I brought thee'--Kim actually dared to use the turn of\nequals--'a white stallion's pedigree that night?'\n\n'Much is gained by forgetting, little brother,' said the Colonel, with\na look that pierced through Kim's shoulder-blades as he scuttled into\nthe carriage.\n\nIt took him nearly five minutes to recover.  Then he sniffed the new\nair appreciatively.  'A rich city,' he said.  'Richer than Lahore. How\ngood the bazars must be!  Coachman, drive me a little through the\nbazars here.'\n\n'My order is to take thee to the school.'  The driver used the 'thou',\nwhich is rudeness when applied to a white man.  In the clearest and\nmost fluent vernacular Kim pointed out his error, climbed on to the\nbox-seat, and, perfect understanding established, drove for a couple of\nhours up and down, estimating, comparing, and enjoying.  There is no\ncity--except Bombay, the queen of all--more beautiful in her garish\nstyle than Lucknow, whether you see her from the bridge over the river,\nor from the top of the Imambara looking down on the gilt umbrellas of\nthe Chutter Munzil, and the trees in which the town is bedded.  Kings\nhave adorned her with fantastic buildings, endowed her with charities,\ncrammed her with pensioners, and drenched her with blood.  She is the\ncentre of all idleness, intrigue, and luxury, and shares with Delhi the\nclaim to talk the only pure Urdu.\n\n'A fair city--a beautiful city.'  The driver, as a Lucknow man, was\npleased with the compliment, and told Kim many astounding things where\nan English guide would have talked of the Mutiny.\n\n'Now we will go to the school,' said Kim at last.  The great old school\nof St Xavier's in Partibus, block on block of low white buildings,\nstands in vast grounds over against the Gumti River, at some distance\nfrom the city.\n\n'What like of folk are they within?'  said Kim.\n\n'Young Sahibs--all devils.  But to speak truth, and I drive many of\nthem to and fro from the railway station, I have never seen one that\nhad in him the making of a more perfect devil than thou--this young\nSahib whom I am now driving.'\n\nNaturally, for he was never trained to consider them in any way\nimproper, Kim had passed the time of day with one or two frivolous\nladies at upper windows in a certain street, and naturally, in the\nexchange of compliments, had acquitted himself well.  He was about to\nacknowledge the driver's last insolence, when his eye--it was growing\ndusk--caught a figure sitting by one of the white plaster gate-pillars\nin the long sweep of wall.\n\n'Stop!'  he cried.  'Stay here.  I do not go to the school at once.'\n\n'But what is to pay me for this coming and re-coming?'  said the driver\npetulantly.  'Is the boy mad?  Last time it was a dancing-girl. This\ntime it is a priest.'\n\nKim was in the road headlong, patting the dusty feet beneath the dirty\nyellow robe.\n\n'I have waited here a day and a half,' the lama's level voice began.\n'Nay, I had a disciple with me.  He that was my friend at the Temple of\nthe Tirthankars gave me a guide for this journey.  I came from Benares\nin the te-rain, when thy letter was given me.  Yes, I am well fed.  I\nneed nothing.'\n\n'But why didst thou not stay with the Kulu woman, O Holy One?  In what\nway didst thou get to Benares?  My heart has been heavy since we\nparted.'\n\n'The woman wearied me by constant flux of talk and requiring charms for\nchildren.  I separated myself from that company, permitting her to\nacquire merit by gifts.  She is at least a woman of open hands, and I\nmade a promise to return to her house if need arose.  Then, perceiving\nmyself alone in this great and terrible world, I bethought me of the\nte-rain to Benares, where I knew one abode in the Tirthankars' Temple\nwho was a Seeker, even as I.'\n\n'Ah!  Thy River,' said Kim.  'I had forgotten the River.'\n\n'So soon, my chela?  I have never forgotten it.  But when I had left\nthee it seemed better that I should go to the Temple and take counsel,\nfor, look you, India is very large, and it may be that wise men before\nus, some two or three, have left a record of the place of our River.\nThere is debate in the Temple of the Tirthankars on this matter; some\nsaying one thing, and some another.  They are courteous folk.'\n\n'So be it; but what dost thou do now?'\n\n'I acquire merit in that I help thee, my chela, to wisdom.  The priest\nof that body of men who serve the Red Bull wrote me that all should be\nas I desired for thee.  I sent the money to suffice for one year, and\nthen I came, as thou seest me, to watch for thee going up into the\nGates of Learning.  A day and a half have I waited, not because I was\nled by any affection towards thee--that is no part of the Way--but, as\nthey said at the Tirthankars' Temple, because, money having been paid\nfor learning, it was right that I should oversee the end of the matter.\nThey resolved my doubts most clearly.  I had a fear that, perhaps, I\ncame because I wished to see thee--misguided by the Red Mist of\naffection.  It is not so ... Moreover, I am troubled by a dream.'\n\n'But surely, Holy One, thou hast not forgotten the Road and all that\nbefell on it.  Surely it was a little to see me that thou didst come?'\n\n'The horses are cold, and it is past their feeding-time,' whined the\ndriver.\n\n'Go to Jehannum and abide there with thy reputationless aunt!'  Kim\nsnarled over his shoulder.  'I am all alone in this land; I know not\nwhere I go nor what shall befall me.  My heart was in that letter I\nsent thee.  Except for Mahbub Ali, and he is a Pathan, I have no friend\nsave thee, Holy One.  Do not altogether go away.'\n\n'I have considered that also,' the lama replied, in a shaking voice.\n'It is manifest that from time to time I shall acquire merit if before\nthat I have not found my River--by assuring myself that thy feet are\nset on wisdom.  What they will teach thee I do not know, but the priest\nwrote me that no son of a Sahib in all India will be better taught than\nthou.  So from time to time, therefore, I will come again.  Maybe thou\nwilt be such a Sahib as he who gave me these spectacles'--the lama\nwiped them elaborately--'in the Wonder House at Lahore.  That is my\nhope, for he was a Fountain of Wisdom--wiser than many abbots ....\nAgain, maybe thou wilt forget me and our meetings.'\n\n'If I eat thy bread,' cried Kim passionately, 'how shall I ever forget\nthee?'\n\n'No--no.'  He put the boy aside.  'I must go back to Benares.  From\ntime to time, now that I know the customs of letter-writers in this\nland, I will send thee a letter, and from time to time I will come and\nsee thee.'\n\n'But whither shall I send my letters?'  wailed Kim, clutching at the\nrobe, all forgetful that he was a Sahib.\n\n'To the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares.  That is the place I have\nchosen till I find my River.  Do not weep; for, look you, all Desire is\nIllusion and a new binding upon the Wheel.  Go up to the Gates of\nLearning.  Let me see thee go ...  Dost thou love me?  Then go, or my\nheart cracks ...  I will come again.  Surely I will come again.\n\nThe lama watched the ticca-gharri rumble into the compound, and strode\noff, snuffing between each long stride.\n\n'The Gates of Learning' shut with a clang.\n\nThe country born and bred boy has his own manners and customs, which do\nnot resemble those of any other land; and his teachers approach him by\nroads which an English master would not understand. Therefore, you\nwould scarcely be interested in Kim's experiences as a St Xavier's boy\namong two or three hundred precocious youths, most of whom had never\nseen the sea.  He suffered the usual penalties for breaking out of\nbounds when there was cholera in the city.  This was before he had\nlearned to write fair English, and so was obliged to find a bazar\nletter-writer.  He was, of course, indicted for smoking and for the use\nof abuse more full-flavoured than even St Xavier's had ever heard.  He\nlearned to wash himself with the Levitical scrupulosity of the\nnative-born, who in his heart considers the Englishman rather dirty.\nHe played the usual tricks on the patient coolies pulling the punkahs\nin the sleeping-rooms where the boys threshed through the hot nights\ntelling tales till the dawn; and quietly he measured himself against\nhis self-reliant mates.\n\nThey were sons of subordinate officials in the Railway, Telegraph, and\nCanal Services; of warrant-officers, sometimes retired and sometimes\nacting as commanders-in-chief to a feudatory Rajah's army; of captains\nof the Indian Marine Government pensioners, planters, Presidency\nshopkeepers, and missionaries.  A few were cadets of the old Eurasian\nhouses that have taken strong root in Dhurrumtollah--Pereiras, De\nSouzas, and D'Silvas.  Their parents could well have educated them in\nEngland, but they loved the school that had served their own youth, and\ngeneration followed sallow-hued generation at St Xavier's.  Their homes\nranged from Howrah of the railway people to abandoned cantonments like\nMonghyr and Chunar; lost tea-gardens Shillong-way; villages where their\nfathers were large landholders in Oudh or the Deccan; Mission-stations\na week from the nearest railway line; seaports a thousand miles south,\nfacing the brazen Indian surf; and cinchona-plantations south of all.\nThe mere story of their adventures, which to them were no adventures,\non their road to and from school would have crisped a Western boy's\nhair.  They were used to jogging off alone through a hundred miles of\njungle, where there was always the delightful chance of being delayed\nby tigers; but they would no more have bathed in the English Channel in\nan English August than their brothers across the world would have lain\nstill while a leopard snuffed at their palanquin.  There were boys of\nfifteen who had spent a day and a half on an islet in the middle of a\nflooded river, taking charge, as by right, of a camp of frantic\npilgrims returning from a shrine.  There were seniors who had\nrequisitioned a chance-met Rajah's elephant, in the name of St Francis\nXavier, when the Rains once blotted out the cart-track that led to\ntheir father's estate, and had all but lost the huge beast in a\nquicksand.  There was a boy who, he said, and none doubted, had helped\nhis father to beat off with rifles from the veranda a rush of Akas in\nthe days when those head-hunters were bold against lonely plantations.\n\nAnd every tale was told in the even, passionless voice of the\nnative-born, mixed with quaint reflections, borrowed unconsciously from\nnative foster-mothers, and turns of speech that showed they had been\nthat instant translated from the vernacular.  Kim watched, listened,\nand approved.  This was not insipid, single-word talk of drummer-boys.\nIt dealt with a life he knew and in part understood. The atmosphere\nsuited him, and he throve by inches.  They gave him a white drill suit\nas the weather warmed, and he rejoiced in the new-found bodily comforts\nas he rejoiced to use his sharpened mind over the tasks they set him.\nHis quickness would have delighted an English master; but at St\nXavier's they know the first rush of minds developed by sun and\nsurroundings, as they know the half-collapse that sets in at twenty-two\nor twenty-three.\n\nNone the less he remembered to hold himself lowly.  When tales were\ntold of hot nights, Kim did not sweep the board with his reminiscences;\nfor St Xavier's looks down on boys who 'go native all-together.'  One\nmust never forget that one is a Sahib, and that some day, when\nexaminations are passed, one will command natives. Kim made a note of\nthis, for he began to understand where examinations led.\n\nThen came the holidays from August to October--the long holidays\nimposed by the heat and the Rains.  Kim was informed that he would go\nnorth to some station in the hills behind Umballa, where Father Victor\nwould arrange for him.\n\n'A barrack-school?'  said Kim, who had asked many questions and thought\nmore.\n\n'Yes, I suppose so,' said the master.  'It will not do you any harm to\nkeep you out of mischief.  You can go up with young De Castro as far as\nDelhi.'\n\nKim considered it in every possible light.  He had been diligent, even\nas the Colonel advised.  A boy's holiday was his own property--of so\nmuch the talk of his companions had advised him,--and a barrack-school\nwould be torment after St Xavier's.  Moreover--this was magic worth\nanything else--he could write.  In three months he had discovered how\nmen can speak to each other without a third party, at the cost of half\nan anna and a little knowledge.  No word had come from the lama, but\nthere remained the Road.  Kim yearned for the caress of soft mud\nsquishing up between the toes, as his mouth watered for mutton stewed\nwith butter and cabbages, for rice speckled with strong scented\ncardamoms, for the saffron-tinted rice, garlic and onions, and the\nforbidden greasy sweetmeats of the bazars.  They would feed him raw\nbeef on a platter at the barrack-school, and he must smoke by stealth.\nBut again, he was a Sahib and was at St Xavier's, and that pig Mahbub\nAli ...  No, he would not test Mahbub's hospitality--and yet ...  He\nthought it out alone in the dormitory, and came to the conclusion he\nhad been unjust to Mahbub.\n\nThe school was empty; nearly all the masters had gone away; Colonel\nCreighton's railway pass lay in his hand, and Kim puffed himself that\nhe had not spent Colonel Creighton's or Mahbub's money in riotous\nliving.  He was still lord of two rupees seven annas.  His new\nbullock-trunk, marked 'K. O'H.', and bedding-roll lay in the empty\nsleeping-room.\n\n'Sahibs are always tied to their baggage,' said Kim, nodding at them.\n'You will stay here' He went out into the warm rain, smiling sinfully,\nand sought a certain house whose outside he had noted down some time\nbefore...\n\n'Arre'!  Dost thou know what manner of women we be in this quarter? Oh,\nshame!'\n\n'Was I born yesterday?'  Kim squatted native-fashion on the cushions of\nthat upper room.  'A little dyestuff and three yards of cloth to help\nout a jest.  Is it much to ask?'\n\n'Who is she?  Thou art full young, as Sahibs go, for this devilry.'\n\n'Oh, she?  She is the daughter of a certain schoolmaster of a regiment\nin the cantonments.  He has beaten me twice because I went over their\nwall in these clothes.  Now I would go as a gardener's boy.  Old men\nare very jealous.'\n\n'That is true.  Hold thy face still while I dab on the juice.'\n\n'Not too black, Naikan.  I would not appear to her as a hubshi\n(nigger).'\n\n'Oh, love makes nought of these things.  And how old is she?'\n\n'Twelve years, I think,' said the shameless Kim.  'Spread it also on\nthe breast.  It may be her father will tear my clothes off me, and if I\nam piebald--' he laughed.\n\nThe girl worked busily, dabbing a twist of cloth into a little saucer\nof brown dye that holds longer than any walnut-juice.\n\n'Now send out and get me a cloth for the turban.  Woe is me, my head is\nall unshaved!  And he will surely knock off my turban.'\n\n'I am not a barber, but I will make shift.  Thou wast born to be a\nbreaker of hearts!  All this disguise for one evening?  Remember, the\nstuff does not wash away.'  She shook with laughter till her bracelets\nand anklets jingled.  'But who is to pay me for this? Huneefa herself\ncould not have given thee better stuff.'\n\n'Trust in the Gods, my sister,' said Kim gravely, screwing his face\nround as the stain dried.  'Besides, hast thou ever helped to paint a\nSahib thus before?'\n\n'Never indeed.  But a jest is not money.'\n\n'It is worth much more.'\n\n'Child, thou art beyond all dispute the most shameless son of Shaitan\nthat I have ever known to take up a poor girl's time with this play,\nand then to say:  \"Is not the jest enough?\"  Thou wilt go very far in\nthis world.'  She gave the dancing-girls' salutation in mockery.\n\n'All one.  Make haste and rough-cut my head.'  Kim shifted from foot to\nfoot, his eyes ablaze with mirth as he thought of the fat days before\nhim.  He gave the girl four annas, and ran down the stairs in the\nlikeness of a low-caste Hindu boy--perfect in every detail.  A cookshop\nwas his next point of call, where he feasted in extravagance and greasy\nluxury.\n\nOn Lucknow station platform he watched young De Castro, all covered\nwith prickly-heat, get into a second-class compartment.  Kim patronized\na third, and was the life and soul of it.  He explained to the company\nthat he was assistant to a juggler who had left him behind sick with\nfever, and that he would pick up his master at Umballa.  As the\noccupants of the carriage changed, he varied this tale, or adorned it\nwith all the shoots of a budding fancy, the more rampant for being held\noff native speech so long.  In all India that night was no human being\nso joyful as Kim.  At Umballa he got out and headed eastward, plashing\nover the sodden fields to the village where the old soldier lived.\n\nAbout this time Colonel Creighton at Simla was advised from Lucknow by\nwire that young O'Hara had disappeared.  Mahbub Ali was in town selling\nhorses, and to him the Colonel confided the affair one morning\ncantering round Annandale racecourse.\n\n'Oh, that is nothing,' said the horse-dealer.  'Men are like horses. At\ncertain times they need salt, and if that salt is not in the mangers\nthey will lick it up from the earth.  He has gone back to the Road\nagain for a while.  The madrissak wearied him.  I knew it would.\nAnother time, I will take him upon the Road myself.  Do not be\ntroubled, Creighton Sahib.  It is as though a polo-pony, breaking\nloose, ran out to learn the game alone.'\n\n'Then he is not dead, think you?'\n\n'Fever might kill him.  I do not fear for the boy otherwise.  A monkey\ndoes not fall among trees.'\n\nNext morning, on the same course, Mahbub's stallion ranged alongside\nthe Colonel.\n\n'It is as I had thought,' said the horse-dealer.  'He has come through\nUmballa at least, and there he has written a letter to me, having\nlearned in the bazar that I was here.'\n\n'Read,' said the Colonel, with a sigh of relief.  It was absurd that a\nman of his position should take an interest in a little country-bred\nvagabond; but the Colonel remembered the conversation in the train, and\noften in the past few months had caught himself thinking of the queer,\nsilent, self-possessed boy.  His evasion, of course, was the height of\ninsolence, but it argued some resource and nerve.\n\nMahbub's eyes twinkled as he reined out into the centre of the cramped\nlittle plain, where none could come near unseen.\n\n'\"The Friend of the Stars, who is the Friend of all the World--\"'\n\n'What is this?'\n\n'A name we give him in Lahore city.  \"The Friend of all the World takes\nleave to go to his own places.  He will come back upon the appointed\nday.  Let the box and the bedding-roll be sent for; and if there has\nbeen a fault, let the Hand of Friendship turn aside the Whip of\nCalamity.\"  There is yet a little more, but--'\n\n'No matter, read.'\n\n'\"Certain things are not known to those who eat with forks.  It is\nbetter to eat with both hands for a while.  Speak soft words to those\nwho do not understand this that the return may be propitious.\"  Now the\nmanner in which that was cast is, of course, the work of the\nletter-writer, but see how wisely the boy has devised the matter of it\nso that no hint is given except to those who know!'\n\n'Is this the Hand of Friendship to avert the Whip of Calamity?' laughed\nthe Colonel.\n\n'See how wise is the boy.  He would go back to the Road again, as I\nsaid.  Not knowing yet thy trade--'\n\n'I am not at all sure of that,' the Colonel muttered.\n\n'He turns to me to make a peace between you.  Is he not wise?  He says\nhe will return.  He is but perfecting his knowledge.  Think, Sahib!  He\nhas been three months at the school.  And he is not mouthed to that\nbit.  For my part, I rejoice.  The pony learns the game.'\n\n'Ay, but another time he must not go alone.'\n\n'Why?  He went alone before he came under the Colonel Sahib's\nprotection.  When he comes to the Great Game he must go alone--alone,\nand at peril of his head.  Then, if he spits, or sneezes, or sits down\nother than as the people do whom he watches, he may be slain.  Why\nhinder him now?  Remember how the Persians say:  The jackal that lives\nin the wilds of Mazanderan can only be caught by the hounds of\nMazanderan.'\n\n'True.  It is true, Mahbub Ali.  And if he comes to no harm, I do not\ndesire anything better.  But it is great insolence on his part.'\n\n'He does not tell me, even, whither he goes,' said Mahbub.  'He is no\nfool.  When his time is accomplished he will come to me.  It is time\nthe healer of pearls took him in hand.  He ripens too quickly--as\nSahibs reckon.'\n\nThis prophecy was fulfilled to the letter a month later.  Mahbub had\ngone down to Umballa to bring up a fresh consignment of horses, and Kim\nmet him on the Kalka road at dusk riding alone, begged an alms of him,\nwas sworn at, and replied in English.  There was nobody within earshot\nto hear Mahbub's gasp of amazement.\n\n'Oho!  And where hast thou been?'\n\n'Up and down--down and up.'\n\n'Come under a tree, out of the wet, and tell.'\n\n'I stayed for a while with an old man near Umballa; anon with a\nhousehold of my acquaintance in Umballa.  With one of these I went as\nfar as Delhi to the southward.  That is a wondrous city.  Then I drove\na bullock for a teli [an oilman] coming north; but I heard of a great\nfeast forward in Patiala, and thither went I in the company of a\nfirework-maker.  It was a great feast' (Kim rubbed his stomach).  'I\nsaw Rajahs, and elephants with gold and silver trappings; and they lit\nall the fireworks at once, whereby eleven men were killed, my\nfire-work-maker among them, and I was blown across a tent but took no\nharm.  Then I came back to the rel with a Sikh horseman, to whom I was\ngroom for my bread; and so here.'\n\n'Shabash!'  said Mahbub Ali.\n\n'But what does the Colonel Sahib say?  I do not wish to be beaten.'\n\n'The Hand of Friendship has averted the Whip of Calamity; but another\ntime, when thou takest the Road it will be with me.  This is too early.'\n\n'Late enough for me.  I have learned to read and to write English a\nlittle at the madrissah.  I shall soon be altogether a Sahib.'\n\n'Hear him!'  laughed Mahbub, looking at the little drenched figure\ndancing in the wet.  'Salaam--Sahib,' and he saluted ironically.\n\n'Well, art tired of the Road, or wilt thou come on to Umballa with me\nand work back with the horses?'\n\n'I come with thee, Mahbub Ali.'\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n  Something I owe to the soil that grew--\n  More to the life that fed--\n  But most to Allah Who gave me two\n  Separate sides to my head.\n\n  I would go without shirts or shoes,\n  Friends, tobacco or bread\n  Sooner than for an instant lose\n  Either side of my head.'\n\n  The Two-Sided Man.\n\n\n'Then in God's name take blue for red,' said Mahbub, alluding to the\nHindu colour of Kim's disreputable turban.\n\nKim countered with the old proverb, 'I will change my faith and my\nbedding, but thou must pay for it.'\n\nThe dealer laughed till he nearly fell from his horse.  At a shop on\nthe outskirts of the city the change was made, and Kim stood up,\nexternally at least, a Mohammedan.\n\nMahbub hired a room over against the railway station, sent for a cooked\nmeal of the finest with the almond-curd sweet-meats [balushai we call\nit] and fine-chopped Lucknow tobacco.\n\n'This is better than some other meat that I ate with the Sikh,' said\nKim, grinning as he squatted, 'and assuredly they give no such victuals\nat my madrissah.'\n\n'I have a desire to hear of that same madrissah.'  Mahbub stuffed\nhimself with great boluses of spiced mutton fried in fat with cabbage\nand golden-brown onions.  'But tell me first, altogether and\ntruthfully, the manner of thy escape.  For, O Friend of all the\nWorld,'--he loosed his cracking belt--'I do not think it is often that\na Sahib and the son of a Sahib runs away from there.'\n\n'How should they?  They do not know the land.  It was nothing,' said\nKim, and began his tale.  When he came to the disguisement and the\ninterview with the girl in the bazar, Mahbub Ali's gravity went from\nhim.  He laughed aloud and beat his hand on his thigh.\n\n'Shabash!  Shabash!  Oh, well done, little one!  What will the healer\nof turquoises say to this?  Now, slowly, let us hear what befell\nafterwards--step by step, omitting nothing.'\n\nStep by step then, Kim told his adventures between coughs as the\nfull-flavoured tobacco caught his lungs.\n\n'I said,' growled Mahbub Ali to himself, 'I said it was the pony\nbreaking out to play polo.  The fruit is ripe already--except that he\nmust learn his distances and his pacings, and his rods and his\ncompasses.  Listen now.  I have turned aside the Colonel's whip from\nthy skin, and that is no small service.'\n\n'True.'  Kim pulled serenely.  'That is true.'\n\n'But it is not to be thought that this running out and in is any way\ngood.'\n\n'It was my holiday, Hajji.  I was a slave for many weeks.  Why should I\nnot run away when the school was shut?  Look, too, how I, living upon\nmy friends or working for my bread, as I did with the Sikh, have saved\nthe Colonel Sahib a great expense.'\n\nMahbub's lips twitched under his well-pruned Mohammedan moustache.\n\n'What are a few rupees'--the Pathan threw out his open hand\ncarelessly--'to the Colonel Sahib?  He spends them for a purpose, not\nin any way for love of thee.'\n\n'That,' said Kim slowly, 'I knew a very long time ago.'\n\n'Who told?'\n\n'The Colonel Sahib himself.  Not in those many words, but plainly\nenough for one who is not altogether a mud-head.  Yea, he told me in\nthe te-rain when we went down to Lucknow.'\n\n'Be it so.  Then I will tell thee more, Friend of all the World, though\nin the telling I lend thee my head.'\n\n'It was forfeit to me,' said Kim, with deep relish, 'in Umballa, when\nthou didst pick me up on the horse after the drummer-boy beat me.'\n\n'Speak a little plainer.  All the world may tell lies save thou and I.\nFor equally is thy life forfeit to me if I chose to raise my finger\nhere.'\n\n'And this is known to me also,' said Kim, readjusting the live\ncharcoal-ball on the weed.  'It is a very sure tie between us. Indeed,\nthy hold is surer even than mine; for who would miss a boy beaten to\ndeath, or, it may be, thrown into a well by the roadside? Most people\nhere and in Simla and across the passes behind the Hills would, on the\nother hand, say:  \"What has come to Mahbub Ali?\" if he were found dead\namong his horses.  Surely, too, the Colonel Sahib would make inquiries.\nBut again,'--Kim's face puckered with cunning,--'he would not make\noverlong inquiry, lest people should ask:  \"What has this Colonel Sahib\nto do with that horse-dealer?\" But I--if I lived--'\n\n'As thou wouldst surely die--'\n\n'Maybe; but I say, if I lived, I, and I alone, would know that one had\ncome by night, as a common thief perhaps, to Mahbub Ali's bulkhead in\nthe serai, and there had slain him, either before or after that thief\nhad made a full search into his saddlebags and between the soles of his\nslippers.  Is that news to tell to the Colonel, or would he say to\nme--(I have not forgotten when he sent me back for a cigar-case that he\nhad not left behind him)--\"What is Mahbub Ali to me?\"?'\n\nUp went a gout of heavy smoke.  There was a long pause:  then Mahbub\nAli spoke in admiration:  'And with these things on thy mind, dost thou\nlie down and rise again among all the Sahibs' little sons at the\nmadrissah and meekly take instruction from thy teachers?'\n\n'It is an order,' said Kim blandly.  'Who am I to dispute an order?'\n\n'A most finished Son of Eblis,' said Mahbub Ali.  'But what is this\ntale of the thief and the search?'\n\n'That which I saw,' said Kim, 'the night that my lama and I lay next\nthy place in the Kashmir Seral.  The door was left unlocked, which I\nthink is not thy custom, Mahbub.  He came in as one assured that thou\nwouldst not soon return.  My eye was against a knot-hole in the plank.\nHe searched as it were for something--not a rug, not stirrups, nor a\nbridle, nor brass pots--something little and most carefully hid.  Else\nwhy did he prick with an iron between the soles of thy slippers?'\n\n'Ha!'  Mahbub Ali smiled gently.  'And seeing these things, what tale\ndidst thou fashion to thyself, Well of the Truth?'\n\n'None.  I put my hand upon my amulet, which lies always next to my\nskin, and, remembering the pedigree of a white stallion that I had\nbitten out of a piece of Mussalmani bread, I went away to Umballa\nperceiving that a heavy trust was laid upon me.  At that hour, had I\nchosen, thy head was forfeit.  It needed only to say to that man, \"I\nhave here a paper concerning a horse which I cannot read.\"  And then?'\nKim peered at Mahbub under his eyebrows.\n\n'Then thou wouldst have drunk water twice--perhaps thrice, afterwards.\nI do not think more than thrice,' said Mahbub simply.\n\n'It is true.  I thought of that a little, but most I thought that I\nloved thee, Mahbub.  Therefore I went to Umballa, as thou knowest, but\n(and this thou dost not know) I lay hid in the garden-grass to see what\nColonel Creighton Sahib might do upon reading the white stallion's\npedigree.'\n\n'And what did he?'  for Kim had bitten off the conversation.\n\n'Dost thou give news for love, or dost thou sell it?'  Kim asked.\n\n'I sell and--I buy.'  Mahbub took a four-anna piece out of his belt and\nheld it up.\n\n'Eight!'  said Kim, mechanically following the huckster instinct of the\nEast.\n\nMahbub laughed, and put away the coin.  'It is too easy to deal in that\nmarket, Friend of all the World.  Tell me for love.  Our lives lie in\neach other's hand.'\n\n'Very good.  I saw the Jang-i-Lat Sahib [the Commander-in-Chief] come\nto a big dinner.  I saw him in Creighton Sahib's office.  I saw the two\nread the white stallion's pedigree.  I heard the very orders given for\nthe opening of a great war.'\n\n'Hah!'  Mahbub nodded with deepest eyes afire.  'The game is well\nplayed.  That war is done now, and the evil, we hope, nipped before the\nflower--thanks to me--and thee.  What didst thou later?'\n\n'I made the news as it were a hook to catch me victual and honour among\nthe villagers in a village whose priest drugged my lama.  But I bore\naway the old man's purse, and the Brahmin found nothing.  So next\nmorning he was angry.  Ho!  Ho!  And I also used the news when I fell\ninto the hands of that white Regiment with their Bull!'\n\n'That was foolishness.'  Mahbub scowled.  'News is not meant to be\nthrown about like dung-cakes, but used sparingly--like bhang.'\n\n'So I think now, and moreover, it did me no sort of good.  But that was\nvery long ago,' he made as to brush it all away with a thin brown\nhand--'and since then, and especially in the nights under the punkah at\nthe madrissah, I have thought very greatly.'\n\n'Is it permitted to ask whither the Heaven-born's thought might have\nled?'  said Mahbub, with an elaborate sarcasm, smoothing his scarlet\nbeard.\n\n'It is permitted,' said Kim, and threw back the very tone.  'They say\nat Nucklao that no Sahib must tell a black man that he has made a\nfault.'\n\nMahbub's hand shot into his bosom, for to call a Pathan a 'black man'\n[kala admi] is a blood-insult.  Then he remembered and laughed. 'Speak,\nSahib.  Thy black man hears.'\n\n'But,' said Kim, 'I am not a Sahib, and I say I made a fault to curse\nthee, Mahbub Ali, on that day at Umballa when I thought I was betrayed\nby a Pathan.  I was senseless; for I was but newly caught, and I wished\nto kill that low-caste drummer-boy.  I say now, Hajji, that it was well\ndone; and I see my road all clear before me to a good service.  I will\nstay in the madrissah till I am ripe.'\n\n'Well said.  Especially are distances and numbers and the manner of\nusing compasses to be learned in that game.  One waits in the Hills\nabove to show thee.'\n\n'I will learn their teaching upon a condition--that my time is given to\nme without question when the madrissah is shut.  Ask that for me of the\nColonel.'\n\n'But why not ask the Colonel in the Sahibs' tongue?'\n\n'The Colonel is the servant of the Government.  He is sent hither and\nyon at a word, and must consider his own advancement.  (See how much I\nhave already learned at Nucklao!) Moreover, the Colonel I know since\nthree months only.  I have known one Mahbub Ali for six years.  So!  To\nthe madrissah I will go.  At the madrissah I will learn.  In the\nmadrissah I will be a Sahib.  But when the madrissah is shut, then must\nI be free and go among my people.  Otherwise I die!'\n\n'And who are thy people, Friend of all the World?'\n\n'This great and beautiful land,' said Kim, waving his paw round the\nlittle clay-walled room where the oil-lamp in its niche burned heavily\nthrough the tobacco-smoke.  'And, further, I would see my lama again.\nAnd, further, I need money.'\n\n'That is the need of everyone,' said Mahbub ruefully.  'I will give\nthee eight annas, for much money is not picked out of horses' hooves,\nand it must suffice for many days.  As to all the rest, I am well\npleased, and no further talk is needed.  Make haste to learn, and in\nthree years, or it may be less, thou wilt be an aid--even to me.'\n\n'Have I been such a hindrance till now?'  said Kim, with a boy's giggle.\n\n'Do not give answers,' Mahbub grunted.  'Thou art my new horse-boy. Go\nand bed among my men.  They are near the north end of the station, with\nthe horses.'\n\n'They will beat me to the south end of the station if I come without\nauthority.'\n\nMahbub felt in his belt, wetted his thumb on a cake of Chinese ink, and\ndabbed the impression on a piece of soft native paper.  From Balkh to\nBombay men know that rough-ridged print with the old scar running\ndiagonally across it.\n\n'That is enough to show my headman.  I come in the morning.'\n\n'By which road?'  said Kim.\n\n'By the road from the city.  There is but one, and then we return to\nCreighton Sahib.  I have saved thee a beating.'\n\n'Allah!  What is a beating when the very head is loose on the\nshoulders?'\n\nKim slid out quietly into the night, walked half round the house,\nkeeping close to the walls, and headed away from the station for a mile\nor so.  Then, fetching a wide compass, he worked back at leisure, for\nhe needed time to invent a story if any of Mahbub's retainers asked\nquestions.\n\nThey were camped on a piece of waste ground beside the railway, and,\nbeing natives, had not, of course, unloaded the two trucks in which\nMahbub's animals stood among a consignment of country-breds bought by\nthe Bombay tram-company.  The headman, a broken-down,\nconsumptive-looking Mohammedan, promptly challenged Kim, but was\npacified at sight of Mahbub's sign-manual.\n\n'The Hajji has of his favour given me service,' said Kim testily. 'If\nthis be doubted, wait till he comes in the morning.  Meantime, a place\nby the fire.'\n\nFollowed the usual aimless babble that every low-caste native must\nraise on every occasion.  It died down, and Kim lay out behind the\nlittle knot of Mahbub's followers, almost under the wheels of a\nhorse-truck, a borrowed blanket for covering.  Now a bed among\nbrickbats and ballast-refuse on a damp night, between overcrowded\nhorses and unwashed Baltis, would not appeal to many white boys; but\nKim was utterly happy.  Change of scene, service, and surroundings were\nthe breath of his little nostrils, and thinking of the neat white cots\nof St Xavier's all arow under the punkah gave him joy as keen as the\nrepetition of the multiplication-table in English.\n\n'I am very old,' he thought sleepily.  'Every month I become a year\nmore old.  I was very young, and a fool to boot, when I took Mahbub's\nmessage to Umballa.  Even when I was with that white Regiment I was\nvery young and small and had no wisdom.  But now I learn every day, and\nin three years the Colonel will take me out of the madrissah and let me\ngo upon the Road with Mahbub hunting for horses' pedigrees, or maybe I\nshall go by myself; or maybe I shall find the lama and go with him.\nYes; that is best.  To walk again as a chela with my lama when he comes\nback to Benares.'\n\nThe thoughts came more slowly and disconnectedly.  He was plunging into\na beautiful dreamland when his ears caught a whisper, thin and sharp,\nabove the monotonous babble round the fire.  It came from behind the\niron-skinned horse-truck.\n\n'He is not here, then?'\n\n'Where should he be but roystering in the city.  Who looks for a rat in\na frog-pond?  Come away.  He is not our man.'\n\n'He must not go back beyond the Passes a second time.  It is the order.'\n\n'Hire some woman to drug him.  It is a few rupees only, and there is no\nevidence.'\n\n'Except the woman.  It must be more certain; and remember the price\nupon his head.'\n\n'Ay, but the police have a long arm, and we are far from the Border.\nIf it were in Peshawur, now!'\n\n'Yes--in Peshawur,' the second voice sneered.  'Peshawur, full of his\nblood-kin--full of bolt-holes and women behind whose clothes he will\nhide.  Yes, Peshawur or Jehannum would suit us equally well.'\n\n'Then what is the plan?'\n\n'O fool, have I not told it a hundred times?  Wait till he comes to lie\ndown, and then one sure shot.  The trucks are between us and pursuit.\nWe have but to run back over the lines and go our way. They will not\nsee whence the shot came.  Wait here at least till the dawn.  What\nmanner of fakir art thou, to shiver at a little watching?'\n\n'Oho!'  thought Kim, behind close-shut eyes.  'Once again it is Mahbub.\nIndeed a white stallion's pedigree is not a good thing to peddle to\nSahibs!  Or maybe Mahbub has been selling other news.  Now what is to\ndo, Kim?  I know not where Mahbub houses, and if he comes here before\nthe dawn they will shoot him.  That would be no profit for thee, Kim.\nAnd this is not a matter for the police.  That would be no profit for\nMahbub; and'--he giggled almost aloud--'I do not remember any lesson at\nNucklao which will help me.  Allah!  Here is Kim and yonder are they.\nFirst, then, Kim must wake and go away, so that they shall not suspect.\nA bad dream wakes a man--thus--'\n\nHe threw the blanket off his face, and raised himself suddenly with the\nterrible, bubbling, meaningless yell of the Asiatic roused by nightmare.\n\n'Urr-urr-urr-urr!  Ya-la-la-la-la!  Narain!  The churel!  The churel!'\n\nA churel is the peculiarly malignant ghost of a woman who has died in\nchild-bed.  She haunts lonely roads, her feet are turned backwards on\nthe ankles, and she leads men to torment.\n\nLouder rose Kim's quavering howl, till at last he leaped to his feet\nand staggered off sleepily, while the camp cursed him for waking them.\nSome twenty yards farther up the line he lay down again, taking care\nthat the whisperers should hear his grunts and groans as he recomposed\nhimself.  After a few minutes he rolled towards the road and stole away\ninto the thick darkness.\n\nHe paddled along swiftly till he came to a culvert, and dropped behind\nit, his chin on a level with the coping-stone.  Here he could command\nall the night-traffic, himself unseen.\n\nTwo or three carts passed, jingling out to the suburbs; a coughing\npoliceman and a hurrying foot-passenger or two who sang to keep off\nevil spirits.  Then rapped the shod feet of a horse.\n\n'Ah!  This is more like Mahbub,' thought Kim, as the beast shied at the\nlittle head above the culvert.\n\n'Ohe', Mahbub Ali,' he whispered, 'have a care!'\n\nThe horse was reined back almost on its haunches, and forced towards\nthe culvert.\n\n'Never again,' said Mahbub, 'will I take a shod horse for night-work.\nThey pick up all the bones and nails in the city.'  He stooped to lift\nits forefoot, and that brought his head within a foot of Kim's.\n\n'Down--keep down,' he muttered.  'The night is full of eyes.'\n\n'Two men wait thy coming behind the horse-trucks.  They will shoot thee\nat thy lying down, because there is a price on thy head.  I heard,\nsleeping near the horses.'\n\n'Didst thou see them?  ...  Hold still, Sire of Devils!'  This\nfuriously to the horse.\n\n'No.'\n\n'Was one dressed belike as a fakir?'\n\n'One said to the other, \"What manner of fakir art thou, to shiver at a\nlittle watching?\"'\n\n'Good.  Go back to the camp and lie down.  I do not die tonight.'\n\nMahbub wheeled his horse and vanished.  Kim tore back down the ditch\ntill he reached a point opposite his second resting-place, slipped\nacross the road like a weasel, and re-coiled himself in the blanket.\n\n'At least Mahbub knows,' he thought contentedly.  'And certainly he\nspoke as one expecting it.  I do not think those two men will profit by\ntonight's watch.'\n\nAn hour passed, and, with the best will in the world to keep awake all\nnight, he slept deeply.  Now and again a night train roared along the\nmetals within twenty feet of him; but he had all the Oriental's\nindifference to mere noise, and it did not even weave a dream through\nhis slumber.\n\nMahbub was anything but asleep.  It annoyed him vehemently that people\noutside his tribe and unaffected by his casual amours should pursue him\nfor the life.  His first and natural impulse was to cross the line\nlower down, work up again, and, catching his well-wishers from behind,\nsummarily slay them.  Here, he reflected with sorrow, another branch of\nthe Government, totally unconnected with Colonel Creighton, might\ndemand explanations which would be hard to supply; and he knew that\nsouth of the Border a perfectly ridiculous fuss is made about a corpse\nor so.  He had not been troubled in this way since he sent Kim to\nUmballa with the message, and hoped that suspicion had been finally\ndiverted.\n\nThen a most brilliant notion struck him.\n\n'The English do eternally tell the truth,' he said, 'therefore we of\nthis country are eternally made foolish.  By Allah, I will tell the\ntruth to an Englishman!  Of what use is the Government police if a poor\nKabuli be robbed of his horses in their very trucks.  This is as bad as\nPeshawur!  I should lay a complaint at the station.  Better still, some\nyoung Sahib on the Railway!  They are zealous, and if they catch\nthieves it is remembered to their honour.'\n\nHe tied up his horse outside the station, and strode on to the platform.\n\n'Hullo, Mahbub Ali' said a young Assistant District Traffic\nSuperintendent who was waiting to go down the line--a tall, tow-haired,\nhorsey youth in dingy white linen.  'What are you doing here?  Selling\nweeds--eh?'\n\n'No; I am not troubled for my horses.  I come to look for Lutuf Ullah.\nI have a truck-load up the line.  Could anyone take them out without\nthe Railway's knowledge?'\n\n'Shouldn't think so, Mahbub.  You can claim against us if they do.'\n\n'I have seen two men crouching under the wheels of one of the trucks\nnearly all night.  Fakirs do not steal horses, so I gave them no more\nthought.  I would find Lutuf Ullah, my partner.'\n\n'The deuce you did?  And you didn't bother your head about it?  'Pon my\nword, it's just almost as well that I met you.  What were they like,\neh?'\n\n'They were only fakirs.  They will no more than take a little grain,\nperhaps, from one of the trucks.  There are many up the line.  The\nState will never miss the dole.  I came here seeking for my partner,\nLutuf Ullah.'\n\n'Never mind your partner.  Where are your horse-trucks?'\n\n'A little to this side of the farthest place where they make lamps for\nthe trains.'--\n\n'The signal-box!  Yes.'\n\n'And upon the rail nearest to the road upon the right-hand\nside--looking up the line thus.  But as regards Lutuf Ullah--a tall man\nwith a broken nose, and a Persian greyhound Aie!'\n\nThe boy had hurried off to wake up a young and enthusiastic policeman;\nfor, as he said, the Railway had suffered much from depredations in the\ngoods-yard.  Mahbub Ali chuckled in his dyed beard.\n\n'They will walk in their boots, making a noise, and then they will\nwonder why there are no fakirs.  They are very clever boys--Barton\nSahib and Young Sahib.'\n\nHe waited idly for a few minutes, expecting to see them hurry up the\nline girt for action.  A light engine slid through the station, and he\ncaught a glimpse of young Barton in the cab.\n\n'I did that child an injustice.  He is not altogether a fool,' said\nMahbub Ali.  'To take a fire-carriage for a thief is a new game!'\n\nWhen Mahbub Ali came to his camp in the dawn, no one thought it worth\nwhile to tell him any news of the night.  No one, at least, but one\nsmall horseboy, newly advanced to the great man's service, whom Mahbub\ncalled to his tiny tent to assist in some packing.\n\n'It is all known to me,' whispered Kim, bending above saddlebags. 'Two\nSahibs came up on a te-train.  I was running to and fro in the dark on\nthis side of the trucks as the te-train moved up and down slowly.  They\nfell upon two men sitting under this truck--Hajji, what shall I do with\nthis lump of tobacco?  Wrap it in paper and put it under the salt-bag?\nYes--and struck them down.  But one man struck at a Sahib with a\nfakir's buck's horn' (Kim meant the conjoined black-buck horns, which\nare a fakir's sole temporal weapon)--'the blood came.  So the other\nSahib, first smiting his own man senseless, smote the stabber with a\nshort gun which had rolled from the first man's hand.  They all raged\nas though mad together.'\n\nMahbub smiled with heavenly resignation.  'No!  That is not so much\ndewanee [madness, or a case for the civil court--the word can be punned\nupon both ways] as nizamut [a criminal case].  A gun, sayest thou?  Ten\ngood years in jail.'\n\n'Then they both lay still, but I think they were nearly dead when they\nwere put on the te-train.  Their heads moved thus.  And there is much\nblood on the line.  Come and see?'\n\n'I have seen blood before.  Jail is the sure place--and assuredly they\nwill give false names, and assuredly no man will find them for a long\ntime.  They were unfriends of mine.  Thy fate and mine seem on one\nstring.  What a tale for the healer of pearls!  Now swiftly with the\nsaddle-bags and the cooking-platter.  We will take out the horses and\naway to Simla.'\n\nSwiftly--as Orientals understand speed--with long explanations, with\nabuse and windy talk, carelessly, amid a hundred checks for little\nthings forgotten, the untidy camp broke up and led the half-dozen stiff\nand fretful horses along the Kalka road in the fresh of the rain-swept\ndawn.  Kim, regarded as Mahbub Ali's favourite by all who wished to\nstand well with the Pathan, was not called upon to work.  They strolled\non by the easiest of stages, halting every few hours at a wayside\nshelter.  Very many Sahibs travel along the Kalka road; and, as Mahbub\nAli says, every young Sahib must needs esteem himself a judge of a\nhorse, and, though he be over head in debt to the money-lender, must\nmake as if to buy.  That was the reason that Sahib after Sahib, rolling\nalong in a stage-carriage, would stop and open talk.  Some would even\ndescend from their vehicles and feel the horses' legs; asking inane\nquestions, or, through sheer ignorance of the vernacular, grossly\ninsulting the imperturbable trader.\n\n'When first I dealt with Sahibs, and that was when Colonel Soady Sahib\nwas Governor of Fort Abazai and flooded the Commissioner's\ncamping-ground for spite,' Mahbub confided to Kim as the boy filled his\npipe under a tree, 'I did not know how greatly they were fools, and\nthis made me wroth.  As thus--,' and he told Kim a tale of an\nexpression, misused in all innocence, that doubled Kim up with mirth.\n'Now I see, however,'--he exhaled smoke slowly--'that it is with them\nas with all men--in certain matters they are wise, and in others most\nfoolish.  Very foolish it is to use the wrong word to a stranger; for\nthough the heart may be clean of offence, how is the stranger to know\nthat?  He is more like to search truth with a dagger.'\n\n'True.  True talk,' said Kim solemnly.  'Fools speak of a cat when a\nwoman is brought to bed, for instance.  I have heard them.'\n\n'Therefore, in one situate as thou art, it particularly behoves thee to\nremember this with both kinds of faces.  Among Sahibs, never forgetting\nthou art a Sahib; among the folk of Hind, always remembering thou\nart--' He paused, with a puzzled smile.\n\n'What am I? Mussalman, Hindu, Jain, or Buddhist?  That is a hard knot.'\n\n'Thou art beyond question an unbeliever, and therefore thou wilt be\ndamned.  So says my Law--or I think it does.  But thou art also my\nLittle Friend of all the World, and I love thee.  So says my heart.\nThis matter of creeds is like horseflesh.  The wise man knows horses\nare good--that there is a profit to be made from all; and for\nmyself--but that I am a good Sunni and hate the men of Tirah--I could\nbelieve the same of all the Faiths.  Now manifestly a Kathiawar mare\ntaken from the sands of her birthplace and removed to the west of\nBengal founders--nor is even a Balkh stallion (and there are no better\nhorses than those of Balkh, were they not so heavy in the shoulder) of\nany account in the great Northern deserts beside the snow-camels I have\nseen.  Therefore I say in my heart the Faiths are like the horses.\nEach has merit in its own country.'\n\n'But my lama said altogether a different thing.'\n\n'Oh, he is an old dreamer of dreams from Bhotiyal.  My heart is a\nlittle angry, Friend of all the World, that thou shouldst see such\nworth in a man so little known.'\n\n'It is true, Hajji; but that worth do I see, and to him my heart is\ndrawn.'\n\n'And his to thine, I hear.  Hearts are like horses.  They come and they\ngo against bit or spur.  Shout Gul Sher Khan yonder to drive in that\nbay stallion's pickets more firmly.  We do not want a horse-fight at\nevery resting-stage, and the dun and the black will be locked in a\nlittle ...  Now hear me.  Is it necessary to the comfort of thy heart\nto see that lama?'\n\n'It is one part of my bond,' said Kim.  'If I do not see him, and if he\nis taken from me, I will go out of that madrissah in Nucklao and,\nand--once gone, who is to find me again?'\n\n'It is true.  Never was colt held on a lighter heel-rope than thou.'\nMahbub nodded his head.\n\n'Do not be afraid.'  Kim spoke as though he could have vanished on the\nmoment.  'My lama has said that he will come to see me at the\nmadrissah--'\n\n'A beggar and his bowl in the presence of those young Sa--'\n\n'Not all!'  Kim cut in with a snort.  'Their eyes are blued and their\nnails are blackened with low-caste blood, many of them.  Sons of\nmehteranees--brothers-in-law to the bhungi [sweeper].'\n\nWe need not follow the rest of the pedigree; but Kim made his little\npoint clearly and without heat, chewing a piece of sugar-cane the while.\n\n'Friend of all the World,' said Mahbub, pushing over the pipe for the\nboy to clean, 'I have met many men, women, and boys, and not a few\nSahibs.  I have never in all my days met such an imp as thou art.'\n\n'And why?  When I always tell thee the truth.'\n\n'Perhaps the very reason, for this is a world of danger to honest men.'\nMahbub Ali hauled himself off the ground, girt in his belt, and went\nover to the horses.\n\n'Or sell it?'\n\nThere was that in the tone that made Mahbub halt and turn.  'What new\ndevilry?'\n\n'Eight annas, and I will tell,' said Kim, grinning.  'It touches thy\npeace.'\n\n'O Shaitan!'  Mahbub gave the money.\n\n'Rememberest thou the little business of the thieves in the dark, down\nyonder at Umballa?'\n\n'Seeing they sought my life, I have not altogether forgotten.  Why?'\n\n'Rememberest thou the Kashmir Serai?'\n\n'I will twist thy ears in a moment--Sahib.'\n\n'No need--Pathan.  Only, the second fakir, whom the Sahibs beat\nsenseless, was the man who came to search thy bulkhead at Lahore.  I\nsaw his face as they helped him on the engine.  The very same man.'\n\n'Why didst thou not tell before?'\n\n'Oh, he will go to jail, and be safe for some years.  There is no need\nto tell more than is necessary at any one time.  Besides, I did not\nthen need money for sweetmeats.'\n\n'Allah kerim!'  said Mahbub Ah.  'Wilt thou some day sell my head for a\nfew sweetmeats if the fit takes thee?'\n\nKim will remember till he dies that long, lazy journey from Umballa,\nthrough Kalka and the Pinjore Gardens near by, up to Simla.  A sudden\nspate in the Gugger River swept down one horse (the most valuable, be\nsure), and nearly drowned Kim among the dancing boulders.  Farther up\nthe road the horses were stampeded by a Government elephant, and being\nin high condition of grass food, it cost a day and a half to get them\ntogether again.  Then they met Sikandar Khan coming down with a few\nunsaleable screws--remnants of his string--and Mahbub, who has more of\nhorse-coping in his little fingernail than Sikandar Khan in all his\ntents, must needs buy two of the worst, and that meant eight hours'\nlaborious diplomacy and untold tobacco.  But it was all pure\ndelight--the wandering road, climbing, dipping, and sweeping about the\ngrowing spurs; the flush of the morning laid along the distant snows;\nthe branched cacti, tier upon tier on the stony hillsides; the voices\nof a thousand water-channels; the chatter of the monkeys; the solemn\ndeodars, climbing one after another with down-drooped branches; the\nvista of the Plains rolled out far beneath them; the incessant twanging\nof the tonga-horns and the wild rush of the led horses when a tonga\nswung round a curve; the halts for prayers (Mahbub was very religious\nin dry-washings and bellowings when time did not press); the evening\nconferences by the halting-places, when camels and bullocks chewed\nsolemnly together and the stolid drivers told the news of the Road--all\nthese things lifted Kim's heart to song within him.\n\n'But, when the singing and dancing is done,' said Mahbub Ali, 'comes\nthe Colonel Sahib's, and that is not so sweet.'\n\n'A fair land--a most beautiful land is this of Hind--and the land of\nthe Five Rivers is fairer than all,' Kim half chanted.  'Into it I will\ngo again if Mahbub Ali or the Colonel lift hand or foot against me.\nOnce gone, who shall find me?  Look, Hajji, is yonder the city of\nSimla?  Allah, what a city!'\n\n'My father's brother, and he was an old man when Mackerson Sahib's well\nwas new at Peshawur, could recall when there were but two houses in it.'\n\nHe led the horses below the main road into the lower Simla bazar--the\ncrowded rabbit-warren that climbs up from the valley to the Town Hall\nat an angle of forty-five.  A man who knows his way there can defy all\nthe police of India's summer capital, so cunningly does veranda\ncommunicate with veranda, alley-way with alley-way, and bolt-hole with\nbolt-hole.  Here live those who minister to the wants of the glad\ncity--jhampanis who pull the pretty ladies' 'rickshaws by night and\ngamble till the dawn; grocers, oil-sellers, curio-vendors,\nfirewood-dealers, priests, pickpockets, and native employees of the\nGovernment.  Here are discussed by courtesans the things which are\nsupposed to be profoundest secrets of the India Council; and here\ngather all the sub-sub-agents of half the Native States.  Here, too,\nMahbub Ali rented a room, much more securely locked than his bulkhead\nat Lahore, in the house of a Mohammedan cattle-dealer.  It was a place\nof miracles, too, for there went in at twilight a Mohammedan horseboy,\nand there came out an hour later a Eurasian lad--the Lucknow girl's dye\nwas of the best--in badly-fitting shop-clothes.\n\n'I have spoken with Creighton Sahib,' quoth Mahbub Ali, 'and a second\ntime has the Hand of Friendship averted the Whip of Calamity.  He says\nthat thou hast altogether wasted sixty days upon the Road, and it is\ntoo late, therefore, to send thee to any Hill-school.'\n\n'I have said that my holidays are my own.  I do not go to school twice\nover.  That is one part of my bond.'\n\n'The Colonel Sahib is not yet aware of that contract.  Thou art to\nlodge in Lurgan Sahib's house till it is time to go again to Nucklao.'\n\n'I had sooner lodge with thee, Mahbub.'\n\n'Thou dost not know the honour.  Lurgan Sahib himself asked for thee.\nThou wilt go up the hill and along the road atop, and there thou must\nforget for a while that thou hast ever seen or spoken to me, Mahbub\nAli, who sells horses to Creighton Sahib, whom thou dost not know.\nRemember this order.'\n\nKim nodded.  'Good,' said he, 'and who is Lurgan Sahib?  Nay'--he\ncaught Mahbub's sword-keen glance--'indeed I have never heard his name.\nIs he by chance--he lowered his voice--'one of us?'\n\n'What talk is this of us, Sahib?'  Mahbub Ali returned, in the tone he\nused towards Europeans.  'I am a Pathan; thou art a Sahib and the son\nof a Sahib.  Lurgan Sahib has a shop among the European shops. All\nSimla knows it.  Ask there ...  and, Friend of all the World, he is one\nto be obeyed to the last wink of his eyelashes.  Men say he does magic,\nbut that should not touch thee.  Go up the hill and ask. Here begins\nthe Great Game.'\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\n  S' doaks was son of Yelth the wise--\n  Chief of the Raven clan.\n  Itswoot the Bear had him in care\n  To make him a medicine-man.\n\n  He was quick and quicker to learn--\n  Bold and bolder to dare:\n  He danced the dread Kloo-Kwallie Dance\n  To tickle Itswoot the Bear!\n\n  Oregon Legend\n\n\nKim flung himself whole-heartedly upon the next turn of the wheel. He\nwould be a Sahib again for a while.  In that idea, so soon as he had\nreached the broad road under Simla Town Hall, he cast about for one to\nimpress.  A Hindu child, some ten years old, squatted under a lamp-post.\n\n'Where is Mr Lurgan's house?'  demanded Kim.\n\n'I do not understand English,' was the answer, and Kim shifted his\nspeech accordingly.\n\n'I will show.'\n\nTogether they set off through the mysterious dusk, full of the noises\nof a city below the hillside, and the breath of a cool wind in\ndeodar-crowned Jakko, shouldering the stars.  The house-lights,\nscattered on every level, made, as it were, a double firmament. Some\nwere fixed, others belonged to the 'rickshaws of the careless,\nopen-spoken English folk, going out to dinner.\n\n'It is here,' said Kim's guide, and halted in a veranda flush with the\nmain road.  No door stayed them, but a curtain of beaded reeds that\nsplit up the lamplight beyond.\n\n'He is come,' said the boy, in a voice little louder than a sigh, and\nvanished.  Kim felt sure that the boy had been posted to guide him from\nthe first, but, putting a bold face on it, parted the curtain.  A\nblack-bearded man, with a green shade over his eyes, sat at a table,\nand, one by one, with short, white hands, picked up globules of light\nfrom a tray before him, threaded them on a glancing silken string, and\nhummed to himself the while.  Kim was conscious that beyond the circle\nof light the room was full of things that smelt like all the temples of\nall the East.  A whiff of musk, a puff of sandal-wood, and a breath of\nsickly jessamine-oil caught his opened nostrils.\n\n'I am here,' said Kim at last, speaking in the vernacular:  the smells\nmade him forget that he was to be a Sahib.\n\n'Seventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one,' the man counted to himself,\nstringing pearl after pearl so quickly that Kim could scarcely follow\nhis fingers.  He slid off the green shade and looked fixedly at Kim for\na full half-minute.  The pupils of the eye dilated and closed to\npin-pricks, as if at will.  There was a fakir by the Taksali Gate who\nhad just this gift and made money by it, especially when cursing silly\nwomen.  Kim stared with interest.  His disreputable friend could\nfurther twitch his ears, almost like a goat, and Kim was disappointed\nthat this new man could not imitate him.\n\n'Do not be afraid,' said Lurgan Sahib suddenly.\n\n'Why should I fear?'\n\n'Thou wilt sleep here tonight, and stay with me till it is time to go\nagain to Nucklao.  It is an order.'\n\n'It is an order,' Kim repeated.  'But where shall I sleep?'\n\n'Here, in this room.'  Lurgan Sahib waved his hand towards the darkness\nbehind him.\n\n'So be it,' said Kim composedly.  'Now?'\n\nHe nodded and held the lamp above his head.  As the light swept them,\nthere leaped out from the walls a collection of Tibetan devil-dance\nmasks, hanging above the fiend-embroidered draperies of those ghastly\nfunctions--horned masks, scowling masks, and masks of idiotic terror.\nIn a corner, a Japanese warrior, mailed and plumed, menaced him with a\nhalberd, and a score of lances and khandas and kuttars gave back the\nunsteady gleam.  But what interested Kim more than all these things--he\nhad seen devil-dance masks at the Lahore Museum--was a glimpse of the\nsoft-eyed Hindu child who had left him in the doorway, sitting\ncross-legged under the table of pearls with a little smile on his\nscarlet lips.\n\n'I think that Lurgan Sahib wishes to make me afraid.  And I am sure\nthat that devil's brat below the table wishes to see me afraid.\n\n'This place,' he said aloud, 'is like a Wonder House.  Where is my bed?'\n\nLurgan Sahib pointed to a native quilt in a corner by the loathsome\nmasks, picked up the lamp, and left the room black.\n\n'Was that Lurgan Sahib?'  Kim asked as he cuddled down.  No answer. He\ncould hear the Hindu boy breathing, however, and, guided by the sound,\ncrawled across the floor, and cuffed into the darkness, crying:  'Give\nanswer, devil!  Is this the way to lie to a Sahib?'\n\nFrom the darkness he fancied he could hear the echo of a chuckle. It\ncould not be his soft-fleshed companion, because he was weeping. So Kim\nlifted up his voice and called aloud:\n\n'Lurgan Sahib!  O Lurgan Sahib!  Is it an order that thy servant does\nnot speak to me?'\n\n'It is an order.'  The voice came from behind him and he started.\n\n'Very good.  But remember,' he muttered, as he resought the quilt, 'I\nwill beat thee in the morning.  I do not love Hindus.'\n\nThat was no cheerful night; the room being overfull of voices and\nmusic.  Kim was waked twice by someone calling his name.  The second\ntime he set out in search, and ended by bruising his nose against a box\nthat certainly spoke with a human tongue, but in no sort of human\naccent.  It seemed to end in a tin trumpet and to be joined by wires to\na smaller box on the floor--so far, at least, as he could judge by\ntouch.  And the voice, very hard and whirring, came out of the trumpet.\nKim rubbed his nose and grew furious, thinking, as usual, in Hindi.\n\n'This with a beggar from the bazar might be good, but--I am a Sahib and\nthe son of a Sahib and, which is twice as much more beside, a student\nof Nucklao.  Yess' (here he turned to English), 'a boy of St Xavier's.\nDamn Mr Lurgan's eyes!--It is some sort of machinery like a\nsewing-machine.  Oh, it is a great cheek of him--we are not frightened\nthat way at Lucknow--No!'  Then in Hindi: 'But what does he gain?  He\nis only a trader--I am in his shop.  But Creighton Sahib is a\nColonel--and I think Creighton Sahib gave orders that it should be\ndone.  How I will beat that Hindu in the morning!  What is this?'\n\nThe trumpet-box was pouring out a string of the most elaborate abuse\nthat even Kim had ever heard, in a high uninterested voice, that for a\nmoment lifted the short hairs of his neck.  When the vile thing drew\nbreath, Kim was reassured by the soft, sewing-machine-like whirr.\n\n'Chup!  [Be still]' he cried, and again he heard a chuckle that decided\nhim.  'Chup--or I break your head.'\n\nThe box took no heed.  Kim wrenched at the tin trumpet and something\nlifted with a click.  He had evidently raised a lid.  If there were a\ndevil inside, now was its time, for--he sniffed--thus did the\nsewing-machines of the bazar smell.  He would clean that shaitan.  He\nslipped off his jacket, and plunged it into the box's mouth. Something\nlong and round bent under the pressure, there was a whirr and the voice\nstopped--as voices must if you ram a thrice-doubled coat on to the wax\ncylinder and into the works of an expensive phonograph.  Kim finished\nhis slumbers with a serene mind.\n\nIn the morning he was aware of Lurgan Sahib looking down on him.\n\n'Oah!'  said Kim, firmly resolved to cling to his Sahib-dom.  'There\nwas a box in the night that gave me bad talk.  So I stopped it.  Was it\nyour box?'\n\nThe man held out his hand.\n\n'Shake hands, O'Hara,' he said.  'Yes, it was my box.  I keep such\nthings because my friends the Rajahs like them.  That one is broken,\nbut it was cheap at the price.  Yes, my friends, the Kings, are very\nfond of toys--and so am I sometimes.'\n\nKim looked him over out of the corners of his eyes.  He was a Sahib in\nthat he wore Sahib's clothes; the accent of his Urdu, the intonation of\nhis English, showed that he was anything but a Sahib. He seemed to\nunderstand what moved in Kim's mind ere the boy opened his mouth, and\nhe took no pains to explain himself as did Father Victor or the Lucknow\nmasters.  Sweetest of all--he treated Kim as an equal on the Asiatic\nside.\n\n'I am sorry you cannot beat my boy this morning.  He says he will kill\nyou with a knife or poison.  He is jealous, so I have put him in the\ncorner and I shall not speak to him today.  He has just tried to kill\nme.  You must help me with the breakfast.  He is almost too jealous to\ntrust, just now.'\n\nNow a genuine imported Sahib from England would have made a great to-do\nover this tale.  Lurgan Sahib stated it as simply as Mahbub Ali was\nused to record his little affairs in the North.\n\nThe back veranda of the shop was built out over the sheer hillside, and\nthey looked down into their neighbours' chimney-pots, as is the custom\nof Simla.  But even more than the purely Persian meal cooked by Lurgan\nSahib with his own hands, the shop fascinated Kim.  The Lahore Museum\nwas larger, but here were more wonders--ghost-daggers and prayer-wheels\nfrom Tibet; turquoise and raw amber necklaces; green jade bangles;\ncuriously packed incense-sticks in jars crusted over with raw garnets;\nthe devil-masks of overnight and a wall full of peacock-blue draperies;\ngilt figures of Buddha, and little portable lacquer altars; Russian\nsamovars with turquoises on the lid; egg-shell china sets in quaint\noctagonal cane boxes; yellow ivory crucifixes--from Japan of all places\nin the world, so Lurgan Sahib said; carpets in dusty bales, smelling\natrociously, pushed back behind torn and rotten screens of geometrical\nwork; Persian water-jugs for the hands after meals; dull copper\nincense-burners neither Chinese nor Persian, with friezes of fantastic\ndevils running round them; tarnished silver belts that knotted like raw\nhide; hairpins of jade, ivory, and plasma; arms of all sorts and kinds,\nand a thousand other oddments were cased, or piled, or merely thrown\ninto the room, leaving a clear space only round the rickety deal table,\nwhere Lurgan Sahib worked.\n\n'Those things are nothing,' said his host, following Kim's glance. 'I\nbuy them because they are pretty, and sometimes I sell--if I like the\nbuyer's look.  My work is on the table--some of it.'\n\nIt blazed in the morning light--all red and blue and green flashes,\npicked out with the vicious blue-white spurt of a diamond here and\nthere.  Kim opened his eyes.\n\n'Oh, they are quite well, those stones.  It will not hurt them to take\nthe sun.  Besides, they are cheap.  But with sick stones it is very\ndifferent.'  He piled Kim's plate anew.  'There is no one but me can\ndoctor a sick pearl and re-blue turquoises.  I grant you opals--any\nfool can cure an opal--but for a sick pearl there is only me. Suppose I\nwere to die!  Then there would be no one ...  Oh no!  You cannot do\nanything with jewels.  It will be quite enough if you understand a\nlittle about the Turquoise--some day.'\n\nHe moved to the end of the veranda to refill the heavy, porous clay\nwater-jug from the filter.\n\n'Do you want drink?'\n\nKim nodded.  Lurgan Sahib, fifteen feet off, laid one hand on the jar.\nNext instant, it stood at Kim's elbow, full to within half an inch of\nthe brim--the white cloth only showing, by a small wrinkle, where it\nhad slid into place.\n\n'Wah!'  said Kim in most utter amazement.  'That is magic.'  Lurgan\nSahib's smile showed that the compliment had gone home.\n\n'Throw it back.'\n\n'It will break.'\n\n'I say, throw it back.'\n\nKim pitched it at random.  It fell short and crashed into fifty pieces,\nwhile the water dripped through the rough veranda boarding.\n\n'I said it would break.'\n\n'All one.  Look at it.  Look at the largest piece.'\n\nThat lay with a sparkle of water in its curve, as it were a star on the\nfloor.  Kim looked intently.  Lurgan Sahib laid one hand gently on the\nnape of his neck, stroked it twice or thrice, and whispered: 'Look!  It\nshall come to life again, piece by piece.  First the big piece shall\njoin itself to two others on the right and the left--on the right and\nthe left.  Look!'\n\nTo save his life, Kim could not have turned his head.  The light touch\nheld him as in a vice, and his blood tingled pleasantly through him.\nThere was one large piece of the jar where there had been three, and\nabove them the shadowy outline of the entire vessel.  He could see the\nveranda through it, but it was thickening and darkening with each beat\nof his pulse.  Yet the jar--how slowly the thoughts came!--the jar had\nbeen smashed before his eyes. Another wave of prickling fire raced down\nhis neck, as Lurgan Sahib moved his hand.\n\n'Look!  It is coming into shape,' said Lurgan Sahib.\n\nSo far Kim had been thinking in Hindi, but a tremor came on him, and\nwith an effort like that of a swimmer before sharks, who hurls himself\nhalf out of the water, his mind leaped up from a darkness that was\nswallowing it and took refuge in--the multiplication-table in English!\n\n'Look!  It is coming into shape,' whispered Lurgan Sahib.\n\nThe jar had been smashed--yess, smashed--not the native word, he would\nnot think of that--but smashed--into fifty pieces, and twice three was\nsix, and thrice three was nine, and four times three was twelve.  He\nclung desperately to the repetition.  The shadow-outline of the jar\ncleared like a mist after rubbing eyes. There were the broken shards;\nthere was the spilt water drying in the sun, and through the cracks of\nthe veranda showed, all ribbed, the white house-wall below--and thrice\ntwelve was thirty-six!\n\n'Look!  Is it coming into shape?'  asked Lurgan Sahib.\n\n'But it is smashed--smashed,' he gasped--Lurgan Sahib had been\nmuttering softly for the last half-minute.  Kim wrenched his head\naside.  'Look!  Dekho!  It is there as it was there.'\n\n'It is there as it was there,' said Lurgan, watching Kim closely while\nthe boy rubbed his neck.  'But you are the first of many who has ever\nseen it so.'  He wiped his broad forehead.\n\n'Was that more magic?'  Kim asked suspiciously.  The tingle had gone\nfrom his veins; he felt unusually wide awake.\n\n'No, that was not magic.  It was only to see if there was--a flaw in a\njewel.  Sometimes very fine jewels will fly all to pieces if a man\nholds them in his hand, and knows the proper way.  That is why one must\nbe careful before one sets them.  Tell me, did you see the shape of the\npot?'\n\n'For a little time.  It began to grow like a flower from the ground.'\n\n'And then what did you do?  I mean, how did you think?'\n\n'Oah!  I knew it was broken, and so, I think, that was what I\nthought--and it was broken.'\n\n'Hm!  Has anyone ever done that same sort of magic to you before?'\n\n'If it was,' said Kim 'do you think I should let it again?  I should\nrun away.'\n\n'And now you are not afraid--eh?'\n\n'Not now.'\n\nLurgan Sahib looked at him more closely than ever.  'I shall ask Mahbub\nAli--not now, but some day later,' he muttered.  'I am pleased with\nyou--yes; and I am pleased with you--no.  You are the first that ever\nsaved himself.  I wish I knew what it was that ... But you are right.\nYou should not tell that--not even to me.'\n\nHe turned into the dusky gloom of the shop, and sat down at the table,\nrubbing his hands softly.  A small, husky sob came from behind a pile\nof carpets.  It was the Hindu child obediently facing towards the wall.\nHis thin shoulders worked with grief.\n\n'Ah!  He is jealous, so jealous.  I wonder if he will try to poison me\nagain in my breakfast, and make me cook it twice.\n\n'Kubbee--kubbee nahin [Never--never.  No!]', came the broken answer.\n\n'And whether he will kill this other boy?'\n\n\n'Kubbee--kubbee nahin.'\n\n'What do you think he will do?'  He turned suddenly on Kim.\n\n'Oah!  I do not know.  Let him go, perhaps.  Why did he want to poison\nyou?'\n\n'Because he is so fond of me.  Suppose you were fond of someone, and\nyou saw someone come, and the man you were fond of was more pleased\nwith him than he was with you, what would you do?'\n\nKim thought.  Lurgan repeated the sentence slowly in the vernacular. 'I\nshould not poison that man,' said Kim reflectively, 'but I should beat\nthat boy--if that boy was fond of my man.  But first, I would ask that\nboy if it were true.'\n\n'Ah!  He thinks everyone must be fond of me.'\n\n'Then I think he is a fool.'\n\n'Hearest thou?'  said Lurgan Sahib to the shaking shoulders.  'The\nSahib's son thinks thou art a little fool.  Come out, and next time thy\nheart is troubled, do not try white arsenic quite so openly. Surely the\nDevil Dasim was lord of our table-cloth that day!  It might have made\nme ill, child, and then a stranger would have guarded the jewels.\nCome!'\n\nThe child, heavy-eyed with much weeping, crept out from behind the bale\nand flung himself passionately at Lurgan Sahib's feet, with an\nextravagance of remorse that impressed even Kim.\n\n'I will look into the ink-pools--I will faithfully guard the jewels!\nOh, my Father and my Mother, send him away!'  He indicated Kim with a\nbackward jerk of his bare heel.\n\n'Not yet--not yet.  In a little while he will go away again.  But now\nhe is at school--at a new madrissah--and thou shalt be his teacher.\nPlay the Play of the Jewels against him.  I will keep tally.'\n\nThe child dried his tears at once, and dashed to the back of the shop,\nwhence he returned with a copper tray.\n\n'Give me!'  he said to Lurgan Sahib.  'Let them come from thy hand, for\nhe may say that I knew them before.'\n\n'Gently--gently,' the man replied, and from a drawer under the table\ndealt a half-handful of clattering trifles into the tray.\n\n'Now,' said the child, waving an old newspaper.  'Look on them as long\nas thou wilt, stranger.  Count and, if need be, handle.  One look is\nenough for me.'  He turned his back proudly.\n\n'But what is the game?'\n\n'When thou hast counted and handled and art sure that thou canst\nremember them all, I cover them with this paper, and thou must tell\nover the tally to Lurgan Sahib.  I will write mine.'\n\n'Oah!'  The instinct of competition waked in his breast.  He bent over\nthe tray.  There were but fifteen stones on it.  'That is easy,' he\nsaid after a minute.  The child slipped the paper over the winking\njewels and scribbled in a native account-book.\n\n'There are under that paper five blue stones--one big, one smaller, and\nthree small,' said Kim, all in haste.  'There are four green stones,\nand one with a hole in it; there is one yellow stone that I can see\nthrough, and one like a pipe-stem.  There are two red stones,\nand--and--I made the count fifteen, but two I have forgotten.  No!\nGive me time.  One was of ivory, little and brownish; and--and--give me\ntime...'\n\n'One--two'--Lurgan Sahib counted him out up to ten.  Kim shook his head.\n\n'Hear my count!'  the child burst in, trilling with laughter. 'First,\nare two flawed sapphires--one of two ruttees and one of four as I\nshould judge.  The four-ruttee sapphire is chipped at the edge.  There\nis one Turkestan turquoise, plain with black veins, and there are two\ninscribed--one with a Name of God in gilt, and the other being cracked\nacross, for it came out of an old ring, I cannot read.  We have now all\nfive blue stones.  Four flawed emeralds there are, but one is drilled\nin two places, and one is a little carven-'\n\n'Their weights?'  said Lurgan Sahib impassively.\n\n'Three--five--five--and four ruttees as I judge it.  There is one piece\nof old greenish pipe amber, and a cut topaz from Europe. There is one\nruby of Burma, of two ruttees, without a flaw, and there is a\nbalas-ruby, flawed, of two ruttees.  There is a carved ivory from China\nrepresenting a rat sucking an egg; and there is last--ah ha!--a ball of\ncrystal as big as a bean set on a gold leaf.'\n\nHe clapped his hands at the close.\n\n'He is thy master,' said Lurgan Sahib, smiling.\n\n'Huh!  He knew the names of the stones,' said Kim, flushing.  'Try\nagain!  With common things such as he and I both know.'\n\nThey heaped the tray again with odds and ends gathered from the shop,\nand even the kitchen, and every time the child won, till Kim marvelled.\n\n'Bind my eyes--let me feel once with my fingers, and even then I will\nleave thee opened-eyed behind,' he challenged.\n\nKim stamped with vexation when the lad made his boast good.\n\n'If it were men--or horses,' he said, 'I could do better.  This playing\nwith tweezers and knives and scissors is too little.'\n\n'Learn first--teach later,' said Lurgan Sahib.  'Is he thy master?'\n\n'Truly.  But how is it done?'\n\n'By doing it many times over till it is done perfectly--for it is worth\ndoing.'\n\nThe Hindu boy, in highest feather, actually patted Kim on the back.\n\n'Do not despair,' he said.  'I myself will teach thee.'\n\n'And I will see that thou art well taught,' said Lurgan Sahib, still\nspeaking in the vernacular, 'for except my boy here--it was foolish of\nhim to buy so much white arsenic when, if he had asked, I could have\ngiven it--except my boy here I have not in a long time met with one\nbetter worth teaching.  And there are ten days more ere thou canst\nreturn to Lucknao where they teach nothing--at the long price.  We\nshall, I think, be friends.'\n\nThey were a most mad ten days, but Kim enjoyed himself too much to\nreflect on their craziness.  In the morning they played the Jewel\nGame--sometimes with veritable stones, sometimes with piles of swords\nand daggers, sometimes with photo-graphs of natives.  Through the\nafternoons he and the Hindu boy would mount guard in the shop, sitting\ndumb behind a carpet-bale or a screen and watching Mr Lurgan's many and\nvery curious visitors.  There were small Rajahs, escorts coughing in\nthe veranda, who came to buy curiosities--such as phonographs and\nmechanical toys.  There were ladies in search of necklaces, and men, it\nseemed to Kim--but his mind may have been vitiated by early\ntraining--in search of the ladies; natives from independent and\nfeudatory Courts whose ostensible business was the repair of broken\nnecklaces--rivers of light poured out upon the table--but whose true\nend seemed to be to raise money for angry Maharanees or young Rajahs.\nThere were Babus to whom Lurgan Sahib talked with austerity and\nauthority, but at the end of each interview he gave them money in\ncoined silver and currency notes. There were occasional gatherings of\nlong-coated theatrical natives who discussed metaphysics in English and\nBengali, to Mr Lurgan's great edification.  He was always interested in\nreligions.  At the end of the day, Kim and the Hindu boy--whose name\nvaried at Lurgan's pleasure--were expected to give a detailed account\nof all that they had seen and heard--their view of each man's\ncharacter, as shown in his face, talk, and manner, and their notions of\nhis real errand.  After dinner, Lurgan Sahib's fancy turned more to\nwhat might be called dressing-up, in which game he took a most\ninforming interest.  He could paint faces to a marvel; with a brush-dab\nhere and a line there changing them past recognition.  The shop was\nfull of all manner of dresses and turbans, and Kim was apparelled\nvariously as a young Mohammedan of good family, an oilman, and\nonce--which was a joyous evening--as the son of an Oudh landholder in\nthe fullest of full dress.  Lurgan Sahib had a hawk's eye to detect the\nleast flaw in the make-up; and lying on a worn teak-wood couch, would\nexplain by the half-hour together how such and such a caste talked, or\nwalked, or coughed, or spat, or sneezed, and, since 'hows' matter\nlittle in this world, the 'why' of everything.  The Hindu child played\nthis game clumsily.  That little mind, keen as an icicle where tally of\njewels was concerned, could not temper itself to enter another's soul;\nbut a demon in Kim woke up and sang with joy as he put on the changing\ndresses, and changed speech and gesture therewith.\n\nCarried away by enthusiasm, he volunteered to show Lurgan Sahib one\nevening how the disciples of a certain caste of fakir, old Lahore\nacquaintances, begged doles by the roadside; and what sort of language\nhe would use to an Englishman, to a Punjabi farmer going to a fair, and\nto a woman without a veil.  Lurgan Sahib laughed immensely, and begged\nKim to stay as he was, immobile for half an hour--cross-legged,\nash-smeared, and wild-eyed, in the back room. At the end of that time\nentered a hulking, obese Babu whose stockinged legs shook with fat, and\nKim opened on him with a shower of wayside chaff.  Lurgan Sahib--this\nannoyed Kim--watched the Babu and not the play.\n\n'I think,' said the Babu heavily, lighting a cigarette, 'I am of\nopeenion that it is most extraordinary and effeecient performance.\nExcept that you had told me I should have opined that--that--that you\nwere pulling my legs.  How soon can he become approximately effeecient\nchain-man?  Because then I shall indent for him.'\n\n'That is what he must learn at Lucknow.'\n\n'Then order him to be jolly-dam'-quick.  Good-night, Lurgan.'  The Babu\nswung out with the gait of a bogged cow.\n\nWhen they were telling over the day's list of visitors, Lurgan Sahib\nasked Kim who he thought the man might be.\n\n'God knows!'  said Kim cheerily.  The tone might almost have deceived\nMahbub Ali, but it failed entirely with the healer of sick pearls.\n\n'That is true.  God, He knows; but I wish to know what you think.'\n\nKim glanced sideways at his companion, whose eye had a way of\ncompelling truth.\n\n'I--I think he will want me when I come from the school,\nbut'--confidentially, as Lurgan Sahib nodded approval--'I do not\nunderstand how he can wear many dresses and talk many tongues.'\n\n'Thou wilt understand many things later.  He is a writer of tales for a\ncertain Colonel.  His honour is great only in Simla, and it is\nnoticeable that he has no name, but only a number and a letter--that is\na custom among us.'\n\n'And is there a price upon his head too--as upon Mah--all the others?'\n\n'Not yet; but if a boy rose up who is now sitting here and went--look,\nthe door is open!--as far as a certain house with a red-painted\nveranda, behind that which was the old theatre in the Lower Bazar, and\nwhispered through the shutters:  \"Hurree Chunder Mookerjee bore the bad\nnews of last month\", that boy might take away a belt full of rupees.'\n\n'How many?'  said Kim promptly.\n\n'Five hundred--a thousand--as many as he might ask for.'\n\n'Good.  And for how long might such a boy live after the news was\ntold?'  He smiled merrily at Lurgan's Sahib's very beard.\n\n'Ah!  That is to be well thought of.  Perhaps if he were very clever,\nhe might live out the day--but not the night.  By no means the night.'\n\n'Then what is the Babu's pay if so much is put upon his head?'\n\n'Eighty--perhaps a hundred--perhaps a hundred and fifty rupees; but the\npay is the least part of the work.  From time to time, God causes men\nto be born--and thou art one of them--who have a lust to go abroad at\nthe risk of their lives and discover news--today it may be of far-off\nthings, tomorrow of some hidden mountain, and the next day of some\nnear-by men who have done a foolishness against the State.  These souls\nare very few; and of these few, not more than ten are of the best.\nAmong these ten I count the Babu, and that is curious.  How great,\ntherefore, and desirable must be a business that brazens the heart of a\nBengali!'\n\n'True.  But the days go slowly for me.  I am yet a boy, and it is only\nwithin two months I learned to write Angrezi.  Even now I cannot read\nit well.  And there are yet years and years and long years before I can\nbe even a chain-man.'\n\n'Have patience, Friend of all the World'--Kim started at the title.\n'Would I had a few of the years that so irk thee.  I have proved thee\nin several small ways.  This will not be forgotten when I make my\nreport to the Colonel Sahib.'  Then, changing suddenly into English\nwith a deep laugh:\n\n'By Jove!  O'Hara, I think there is a great deal in you; but you must\nnot become proud and you must not talk.  You must go back to Lucknow\nand be a good little boy and mind your book, as the English say, and\nperhaps, next holidays if you care, you can come back to me!'  Kim's\nface fell.  'Oh, I mean if you like.  I know where you want to go.'\n\nFour days later a seat was booked for Kim and his small trunk at the\nrear of a Kalka tonga.  His companion was the whale-like Babu, who,\nwith a fringed shawl wrapped round his head, and his fat\nopenwork-stockinged left leg tucked under him, shivered and grunted in\nthe morning chill.\n\n'How comes it that this man is one of us?'  thought Kim considering the\njelly back as they jolted down the road; and the reflection threw him\ninto most pleasant day-dreams.  Lurgan Sahib had given him five\nrupees--a splendid sum--as well as the assurance of his protection if\nhe worked.  Unlike Mahbub, Lurgan Sahib had spoken most explicitly of\nthe reward that would follow obedience, and Kim was content.  If only,\nlike the Babu, he could enjoy the dignity of a letter and a number--and\na price upon his head!  Some day he would be all that and more.  Some\nday he might be almost as great as Mahbub Ali!  The housetops of his\nsearch should be half India; he would follow Kings and Ministers, as in\nthe old days he had followed vakils and lawyers' touts across Lahore\ncity for Mahbub Ali's sake. Meantime, there was the present, and not at\nall unpleasant, fact of St Xavier's immediately before him.  There\nwould be new boys to condescend to, and there would be tales of holiday\nadventures to hear.  Young Martin, son of the tea-planter at Manipur,\nhad boasted that he would go to war, with a rifle, against the\nhead-hunters.\n\nThat might be, but it was certain young Martin had not been blown half\nacross the forecourt of a Patiala palace by an explosion of fireworks;\nnor had he...  Kim fell to telling himself the story of his own\nadventures through the last three months.  He could paralyse St\nXavier's--even the biggest boys who shaved--with the recital, were that\npermitted.  But it was, of course, out of the question. There would be\na price upon his head in good time, as Lurgan Sahib had assured him;\nand if he talked foolishly now, not only would that price never be set,\nbut Colonel Creighton would cast him off--and he would be left to the\nwrath of Lurgan Sahib and Mahbub Ali--for the short space of life that\nwould remain to him.\n\n'So I should lose Delhi for the sake of a fish,' was his proverbial\nphilosophy.  It behoved him to forget his holidays (there would always\nremain the fun of inventing imaginary adventures) and, as Lurgan Sahib\nhad said, to work.  Of all the boys hurrying back to St Xavier's, from\nSukkur in the sands to Galle beneath the palms, none was so filled with\nvirtue as Kimball O'Hara, jiggeting down to Umballa behind Hurree\nChunder Mookerjee, whose name on the books of one section of the\nEthnological Survey was R.17.\n\nAnd if additional spur were needed, the Babu supplied it.  After a huge\nmeal at Kalka, he spoke uninterruptedly.  Was Kim going to school?\nThen he, an M A of Calcutta University, would explain the advantages of\neducation.  There were marks to be gained by due attention to Latin and\nWordsworth's Excursion (all this was Greek to Kim).  French, too was\nvital, and the best was to be picked up in Chandernagore a few miles\nfrom Calcutta.  Also a man might go far, as he himself had done, by\nstrict attention to plays called Lear and Julius Caesar, both much in\ndemand by examiners.  Lear was not so full of historical allusions as\nJulius Caesar; the book cost four annas, but could be bought\nsecond-hand in Bow Bazar for two.  Still more important than\nWordsworth, or the eminent authors, Burke and Hare, was the art and\nscience of mensuration.  A boy who had passed his examination in these\nbranches--for which, by the way, there were no cram-books--could, by\nmerely marching over a country with a compass and a level and a\nstraight eye, carry away a picture of that country which might be sold\nfor large sums in coined silver.  But as it was occasionally\ninexpedient to carry about measuring-chains a boy would do well to know\nthe precise length of his own foot-pace, so that when he was deprived\nof what Hurree Chunder called adventitious aids' he might still tread\nhis distances.  To keep count of thousands of paces, Hurree Chunder's\nexperience had shown him nothing more valuable than a rosary of\neighty-one or a hundred and eight beads, for 'it was divisible and\nsub-divisible into many multiples and sub-multiples'.  Through the\nvolleying drifts of English, Kim caught the general trend of the talk,\nand it interested him very much.  Here was a new craft that a man could\ntuck away in his head and by the look of the large wide world unfolding\nitself before him, it seemed that the more a man knew the better for\nhim.\n\nSaid the Babu when he had talked for an hour and a half 'I hope some\nday to enjoy your offeecial acquaintance.  Ad interim, if I may be\npardoned that expression, I shall give you this betel-box, which is\nhighly valuable article and cost me two rupees only four years ago.' It\nwas a cheap, heart-shaped brass thing with three compartments for\ncarrying the eternal betel-nut, lime and pan-leaf; but it was filled\nwith little tabloid-bottles.\n\n'That is reward of merit for your performance in character of that holy\nman.  You see, you are so young you think you will last for ever and\nnot take care of your body.  It is great nuisance to go sick in the\nmiddle of business.  I am fond of drugs myself, and they are handy to\ncure poor people too.  These are good Departmental drugs--quinine and\nso on.  I give it you for souvenir.  Now good-bye.  I have urgent\nprivate business here by the roadside.'\n\nHe slipped out noiselessly as a cat, on the Umballa road, hailed a\npassing cart and jingled away, while Kim, tongue-tied, twiddled the\nbrass betel-box in his hands.\n\nThe record of a boy's education interests few save his parents, and, as\nyou know, Kim was an orphan.  It is written in the books of St Xavier's\nin Partibus that a report of Kim's progress was forwarded at the end of\neach term to Colonel Creighton and to Father Victor, from whose hands\nduly came the money for his schooling.  It is further recorded in the\nsame books that he showed a great aptitude for mathematical studies as\nwell as map-making, and carried away a prize (The Life of Lord\nLawrence, tree-calf, two vols., nine rupees, eight annas) for\nproficiency therein; and the same term played in St Xavier's eleven\nagainst the Alighur Mohammedan College, his age being fourteen years\nand ten months.  He was also re-vaccinated (from which we may assume\nthat there had been another epidemic of smallpox at Lucknow) about the\nsame time.  Pencil notes on the edge of an old muster-roll record that\nhe was punished several times for 'conversing with improper persons',\nand it seems that he was once sentenced to heavy pains for 'absenting\nhimself for a day in the company of a street beggar'.  That was when he\ngot over the gate and pleaded with the lama through a whole day down\nthe banks of the Gumti to accompany him on the Road next holidays--for\none month--for a little week; and the lama set his face as a flint\nagainst it, averring that the time had not yet come.  Kim's business,\nsaid the old man as they ate cakes together, was to get all the wisdom\nof the Sahibs and then he would see.  The Hand of Friendship must in\nsome way have averted the Whip of Calamity, for six weeks later Kim\nseems to have passed an examination in elementary surveying 'with great\ncredit', his age being fifteen years and eight months.  From this date\nthe record is silent.  His name does not appear in the year's batch of\nthose who entered for the subordinate Survey of India, but against it\nstand the words 'removed on appointment.'\n\nSeveral times in those three years, cast up at the Temple of the\nTirthankars in Benares the lama, a little thinner and a shade yellower,\nif that were possible, but gentle and untainted as ever. Sometimes it\nwas from the South that he came--from south of Tuticorin, whence the\nwonderful fire-boats go to Ceylon where are priests who know Pali;\nsometimes it was from the wet green West and the thousand\ncotton-factory chimneys that ring Bombay; and once from the North,\nwhere he had doubled back eight hundred miles to talk for a day with\nthe Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House.  He would stride to his\ncell in the cool, cut marble--the priests of the Temple were good to\nthe old man,--wash off the dust of travel, make prayer, and depart for\nLucknow, well accustomed now to the way of the rail, in a third-class\ncarriage.  Returning, it was noticeable, as his friend the Seeker\npointed out to the head-priest, that he ceased for a while to mourn the\nloss of his River, or to draw wondrous pictures of the Wheel of Life,\nbut preferred to talk of the beauty and wisdom of a certain mysterious\nchela whom no man of the Temple had ever seen.  Yes, he had followed\nthe traces of the Blessed Feet throughout all India.  (The Curator has\nstill in his possession a most marvellous account of his wanderings and\nmeditations.) There remained nothing more in life but to find the River\nof the Arrow. Yet it was shown to him in dreams that it was a matter\nnot to be undertaken with any hope of success unless that seeker had\nwith him the one chela appointed to bring the event to a happy issue,\nand versed in great wisdom--such wisdom as white-haired Keepers of\nImages possess.  For example (here came out the snuff-gourd, and the\nkindly Jain priests made haste to be silent):\n\n'Long and long ago, when Devadatta was King of Benares--let all listen\nto the Tataka!--an elephant was captured for a time by the king's\nhunters and ere he broke free, beringed with a grievous legiron.  This\nhe strove to remove with hate and frenzy in his heart, and hurrying up\nand down the forests, besought his brother-elephants to wrench it\nasunder.  One by one, with their strong trunks, they tried and failed.\nAt the last they gave it as their opinion that the ring was not to be\nbroken by any bestial power.  And in a thicket, new-born, wet with\nmoisture of birth, lay a day-old calf of the herd whose mother had\ndied.  The fettered elephant, forgetting his own agony, said:  \"If I do\nnot help this suckling it will perish under our feet.\"  So he stood\nabove the young thing, making his legs buttresses against the uneasily\nmoving herd; and he begged milk of a virtuous cow, and the calf throve,\nand the ringed elephant was the calf's guide and defence.  Now the days\nof an elephant--let all listen to the Tataka!--are thirty-five years to\nhis full strength, and through thirty-five Rains the ringed elephant\nbefriended the younger, and all the while the fetter ate into the flesh.\n\n'Then one day the young elephant saw the half-buried iron, and turning\nto the elder said:  \"What is this?\"  \"It is even my sorrow,\" said he\nwho had befriended him.  Then that other put out his trunk and in the\ntwinkling of an eyelash abolished the ring, saying:  \"The appointed\ntime has come.\"  So the virtuous elephant who had waited temperately\nand done kind acts was relieved, at the appointed time, by the very\ncalf whom he had turned aside to cherish--let all listen to the Tataka!\nfor the Elephant was Ananda, and the Calf that broke the ring was none\nother than The Lord Himself...'\n\nThen he would shake his head benignly, and over the ever-clicking\nrosary point out how free that elephant-calf was from the sin of pride.\nHe was as humble as a chela who, seeing his master sitting in the dust\noutside the Gates of Learning, over-leapt the gates (though they were\nlocked) and took his master to his heart in the presence of the\nproud-stomached city.  Rich would be the reward of such a master and\nsuch a chela when the time came for them to seek freedom together!\n\nSo did the lama speak, coming and going across India as softly as a\nbat.  A sharp-tongued old woman in a house among the fruit-trees behind\nSaharunpore honoured him as the woman honoured the prophet, but his\nchamber was by no means upon the wall.  In an apartment of the\nforecourt overlooked by cooing doves he would sit, while she laid aside\nher useless veil and chattered of spirits and fiends of Kulu, of\ngrandchildren unborn, and of the free-tongued brat who had talked to\nher in the resting-place.  Once, too, he strayed alone from the Grand\nTrunk Road below Umballa to the very village whose priest had tried to\ndrug him; but the kind Heaven that guards lamas sent him at twilight\nthrough the crops, absorbed and unsuspicious, to the Rissaldar's door.\nHere was like to have been a grave misunderstanding, for the old\nsoldier asked him why the Friend of the Stars had gone that way only\nsix days before.\n\n'That may not be,' said the lama.  'He has gone back to his own people.'\n\n'He sat in that corner telling a hundred merry tales five nights ago,'\nhis host insisted.  'True, he vanished somewhat suddenly in the dawn\nafter foolish talk with my granddaughter.  He grows apace, but he is\nthe same Friend of the Stars as brought me true word of the war.  Have\nye parted?'\n\n'Yes--and no,' the lama replied.  'We--we have not altogether parted,\nbut the time is not ripe that we should take the Road together.  He\nacquires wisdom in another place.  We must wait.'\n\n'All one--but if it were not the boy how did he come to speak so\ncontinually of thee?'\n\n'And what said he?'  asked the lama eagerly.\n\n'Sweet words--an hundred thousand--that thou art his father and mother\nand such all.  Pity that he does not take the Qpeen's service. He is\nfearless.'\n\nThis news amazed the lama, who did not then know how religiously Kim\nkept to the contract made with Mahbub Ali, and perforce ratified by\nColonel Creighton...\n\n'There is no holding the young pony from the game,' said the\nhorse-dealer when the Colonel pointed out that vagabonding over India\nin holiday time was absurd.  'If permission be refused to go and come\nas he chooses, he will make light of the refusal.  Then who is to catch\nhim?  Colonel Sahib, only once in a thousand years is a horse born so\nwell fitted for the game as this our colt.  And we need men.'\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\n\n  Your tiercel's too long at hack, Sire.  He's no eyass\n  But a passage-hawk that footed ere we caught him,\n  Dangerously free o' the air.  Faith!  were he mine\n  (As mine's the glove he binds to for his tirings)\n  I'd fly him with a make-hawk.  He's in yarak\n  Plumed to the very point--so manned, so weathered...\n  Give him the firmament God made him for,\n  And what shall take the air of him?\n\n  Gow's Watch\n\n\nLurgan Sahib did not use as direct speech, but his advice tallied with\nMahbub's; and the upshot was good for Kim.  He knew better now than to\nleave Lucknow city in native garb, and if Mahbub were anywhere within\nreach of a letter, it was to Mahbub's camp he headed, and made his\nchange under the Pathan's wary eye.  Could the little Survey paint-box\nthat he used for map-tinting in term-time have found a tongue to tell\nof holiday doings, he might have been expelled.  Once Mahbub and he\nwent together as far as the beautiful city of Bombay, with three\ntruckloads of tram-horses, and Mahbub nearly melted when Kim proposed a\nsail in a dhow across the Indian Ocean to buy Gulf Arabs, which, he\nunderstood from a hanger-on of the dealer Abdul Rahman, fetched better\nprices than mere Kabulis.\n\nHe dipped his hand into the dish with that great trader when Mahbub and\na few co-religionists were invited to a big Haj dinner.  They came back\nby way of Karachi by sea, when Kim took his first experience of\nsea-sickness sitting on the fore-hatch of a coasting-steamer, well\npersuaded he had been poisoned.  The Babu's famous drug-box proved\nuseless, though Kim had restocked it at Bombay. Mahbub had business at\nQuetta, and there Kim, as Mahbub admitted, earned his keep, and perhaps\na little over, by spending four curious days as scullion in the house\nof a fat Commissariat sergeant, from whose office-box, in an auspicious\nmoment, he removed a little vellum ledger which he copied out--it\nseemed to deal entirely with cattle and camel sales--by moonlight,\nlying behind an outhouse, all through one hot night.  Then he returned\nthe ledger to its place, and, at Mahbub's word, left that service\nunpaid, rejoining him six miles down the road, the clean copy in his\nbosom.\n\n'That soldier is a small fish,' Mahbub Ali explained, 'but in time we\nshall catch the larger one.  He only sells oxen at two prices--one for\nhimself and one for the Government--which I do not think is a sin.'\n\n'Why could not I take away the little book and be done with it?'\n\n'Then he would have been frightened, and he would have told his master.\nThen we should miss, perhaps, a great number of new rifles which seek\ntheir way up from Quetta to the North.  The Game is so large that one\nsees but a little at a time.'\n\n'Oho!'  said Kim, and held his tongue.  That was in the monsoon\nholidays, after he had taken the prize for mathematics.  The Christmas\nholidays he spent--deducting ten days for private amusements--with\nLurgan Sahib, where he sat for the most part in front of a roaring\nwood-fire--Jakko road was four feet deep in snow that year--and--the\nsmall Hindu had gone away to be married--helped Lurgan to thread\npearls.  He made Kim learn whole chapters of the Koran by heart, till\nhe could deliver them with the very roll and cadence of a mullah.\nMoreover, he told Kim the names and properties of many native drugs, as\nwell as the runes proper to recite when you administer them.  And in\nthe evenings he wrote charms on parchment--elaborate pentagrams crowned\nwith the names of devils--Murra, and Awan the Companion of Kings--all\nfantastically written in the corners.  More to the point, he advised\nKim as to the care of his own body, the cure of fever-fits, and simple\nremedies of the Road.  A week before it was time to go down, Colonel\nCreighton Sahib--this was unfair--sent Kim a written examination paper\nthat concerned itself solely with rods and chains and links and angles.\n\nNext holidays he was out with Mahbub, and here, by the way, he nearly\ndied of thirst, plodding through the sand on a camel to the mysterious\ncity of Bikanir, where the wells are four hundred feet deep, and lined\nthroughout with camel-bone.  It was not an amusing trip from Kim's\npoint of view, because--in defiance of the contract--the Colonel\nordered him to make a map of that wild, walled city; and since\nMohammedan horse-boys and pipe-tenders are not expected to drag\nSurvey-chains round the capital of an independent Native State, Kim was\nforced to pace all his distances by means of a bead rosary. He used the\ncompass for bearings as occasion served--after dark chiefly, when the\ncamels had been fed--and by the help of his little Survey paint-box of\nsix colour-cakes and three brushes, he achieved something not remotely\nunlike the city of Jeysulmir.  Mahbub laughed a great deal, and advised\nhim to make up a written report as well; and in the back of the big\naccount-book that lay under the flap of Mahbub's pet saddle Kim fell to\nwork..\n\n'It must hold everything that thou hast seen or touched or considered.\nWrite as though the Jung-i-Lat Sahib himself had come by stealth with a\nvast army outsetting to war.'\n\n'How great an army?'\n\n'Oh, half a lakh of men.'\n\n'Folly!  Remember how few and bad were the wells in the sand.  Not a\nthousand thirsty men could come near by here.'\n\n'Then write that down--also all the old breaches in the walls and\nwhence the firewood is cut--and what is the temper and disposition of\nthe King.  I stay here till all my horses are sold.  I will hire a room\nby the gateway, and thou shalt be my accountant.  There is a good lock\nto the door.'\n\nThe report in its unmistakable St Xavier's running script, and the\nbrown, yellow, and lake-daubed map, was on hand a few years ago (a\ncareless clerk filed it with the rough notes of E's second Seistan\nsurvey), but by now the pencil characters must be almost illegible. Kim\ntranslated it, sweating under the light of an oil-lamp, to Mahbub, the\nsecond day of their return-journey.\n\nThe Pathan rose and stooped over his dappled saddle-bags.\n\n'I knew it would be worthy a dress of honour, and so I made one ready,'\nhe said, smiling.  'Were I Amir of Afghanistan (and some day we may see\nhim), I would fill thy mouth with gold.'  He laid the garments formally\nat Kim's feet.  There was a gold-embroidered Peshawur turban-cap,\nrising to a cone, and a big turban-cloth ending in a broad fringe of\ngold.  There was a Delhi embroidered waistcoat to slip over a milky\nwhite shirt, fastening to the right, ample and flowing; green pyjamas\nwith twisted silk waist-string; and that nothing might be lacking,\nrussia-leather slippers, smelling divinely, with arrogantly curled tips.\n\n'Upon a Wednesday, and in the morning, to put on new clothes is\nauspicious,' said Mahbub solemnly.  'But we must not forget the wicked\nfolk in the world.  So!'\n\nHe capped all the splendour, that was taking Kim's delighted breath\naway, with a mother-of-pearl, nickel-plated, self-extracting .450\nrevolver.\n\n'I had thought of a smaller bore, but reflected that this takes\nGovernment bullets.  A man can always come by those--especially across\nthe Border.  Stand up and let me look.'  He clapped Kim on the\nshoulder.  'May you never be tired, Pathan!  Oh, the hearts to be\nbroken!  Oh, the eyes under the eyelashes, looking sideways!'\n\nKim turned about, pointed his toes, stretched, and felt mechanically\nfor the moustache that was just beginning.  Then he stooped towards\nMahbub's feet to make proper acknowledgment with fluttering,\nquick-patting hands; his heart too full for words.  Mahbub forestalled\nand embraced him.\n\n'My son, said he, 'what need of words between us?  But is not the\nlittle gun a delight?  All six cartridges come out at one twist.  It is\nborne in the bosom next the skin, which, as it were, keeps it oiled.\nNever put it elsewhere, and please God, thou shalt some day kill a man\nwith it.'\n\n'Hai mai!'  said Kim ruefully.  'If a Sahib kills a man he is hanged in\nthe jail.'\n\n'True:  but one pace beyond the Border, men are wiser.  Put it away;\nbut fill it first.  Of what use is a gun unfed?'\n\n\n'When I go back to the madrissah I must return it.  They do not allow\nlittle guns.  Thou wilt keep it for me?'\n\n\n'Son, I am wearied of that madrissah, where they take the best years of\na man to teach him what he can only learn upon the Road.  The folly of\nthe Sahibs has neither top nor bottom.  No matter.  Maybe thy written\nreport shall save thee further bondage; and God He knows we need men\nmore and more in the Game.'\n\nThey marched, jaw-bound against blowing sand, across the salt desert to\nJodhpur, where Mahbub and his handsome nephew Habib Ullah did much\ntrading; and then sorrowfully, in European clothes, which he was fast\noutgrowing, Kim went second-class to St Xavier's.  Three weeks later,\nColonel Creighton, pricing Tibetan ghost-daggers at Lurgan's shop,\nfaced Mahbub Ali openly mutinous.  Lurgan Sahib operated as support in\nreserve.\n\n'The pony is made--finished--mouthed and paced, Sahib!  From now on,\nday by day, he will lose his manners if he is kept at tricks. Drop the\nrein on his back and let go,' said the horse-dealer.  'We need him.'\n\n'But he is so young, Mahbub--not more than sixteen--is he?'\n\n'When I was fifteen, I had shot my man and begot my man, Sahib.'\n\n'You impenitent old heathen!'  Creighton turned to Lurgan.  The black\nbeard nodded assent to the wisdom of the Afghan's dyed scarlet.\n\n'I should have used him long ago,' said Lurgan.  'The younger the\nbetter.  That is why I always have my really valuable jewels watched by\na child.  You sent him to me to try.  I tried him in every way:  he is\nthe only boy I could not make to see things.'\n\n'In the crystal--in the ink-pool?'  demanded Mahbub.\n\n'No.  Under my hand, as I told you.  That has never happened before. It\nmeans that he is strong enough--but you think it skittles, Colonel\nCreighton--to make anyone do anything he wants.  And that is three\nyears ago.  I have taught him a good deal since, Colonel Creighton.  I\nthink you waste him now.'\n\n'Hmm!  Maybe you're right.  But, as you know, there is no Survey work\nfor him at present.'\n\n'Let him out let him go,' Mahbub interrupted.  'Who expects any colt to\ncarry heavy weight at first?  Let him run with the caravans--like our\nwhite camel-colts--for luck.  I would take him myself, but--'\n\n'There is a little business where he would be most useful--in the\nSouth,' said Lurgan, with peculiar suavity, dropping his heavy blued\neyelids.\n\n'E.23 has that in hand,' said Creighton quickly.  'He must not go down\nthere.  Besides, he knows no Turki.'\n\n'Only tell him the shape and the smell of the letters we want and he\nwill bring them back,' Lurgan insisted.\n\n'No.  That is a man's job,' said Creighton.\n\nIt was a wry-necked matter of unauthorized and incendiary\ncorrespondence between a person who claimed to be the ultimate\nauthority in all matters of the Mohammedan religion throughout the\nworld, and a younger member of a royal house who had been brought to\nbook for kidnapping women within British territory.  The Moslem\nArchbishop had been emphatic and over-arrogant; the young prince was\nmerely sulky at the curtailment of his privileges, but there was no\nneed he should continue a correspondence which might some day\ncompromise him.  One letter indeed had been procured, but the finder\nwas later found dead by the roadside in the habit of an Arab trader, as\nE.23, taking up the work, duly reported.\n\nThese facts, and a few others not to be published, made both Mahbub and\nCreighton shake their heads.\n\n'Let him go out with his Red Lama,' said the horse-dealer with visible\neffort.  'He is fond of the old man.  He can learn his paces by the\nrosary at least.'\n\n'I have had some dealings with the old man--by letter,' said Colonel\nCreighton, smiling to himself.  'Whither goes he?'\n\n'Up and down the land, as he has these three years.  He seeks a River\nof Healing.  God's curse upon all--' Mahbub checked himself.  'He beds\ndown at the Temple of the Tirthankars or at Buddh Gaya when he is in\nfrom the Road.  Then he goes to see the boy at the madrissah, as we\nknow for the boy was punished for it twice or thrice.  He is quite mad,\nbut a peaceful man.  I have met him.  The Babu also has had dealings\nwith him.  We have watched him for three years.  Red Lamas are not so\ncommon in Hind that one loses track.'\n\n'Babus are very curious,' said Lurgan meditatively.  'Do you know what\nHurree Babu really wants?  He wants to be made a member of the Royal\nSociety by taking ethnological notes.  I tell you, I tell him about the\nlama everything which Mahbub and the boy have told me. Hurree Babu goes\ndown to Benares--at his own expense, I think.'\n\n'I don't,' said Creighton briefly.  He had paid Hurree's travelling\nexpenses, out of a most lively curiosity to learn what the lama might\nbe.\n\n'And he applies to the lama for information on lamaism, and\ndevil-dances, and spells and charms, several times in these few years.\nHoly Virgin!  I could have told him all that yeears ago.  I think\nHurree Babu is getting too old for the Road.  He likes better to\ncollect manners and customs information.  Yes, he wants to be an FRS.\n\n'Hurree thinks well of the boy, doesn't he?'\n\n'Oh, very indeed--we have had some pleasant evenings at my little\nplace--but I think it would be waste to throw him away with Hurree on\nthe Ethnological side.'\n\n'Not for a first experience.  How does that strike you, Mahbub?  Let\nthe boy run with the lama for six months.  After that we can see.  He\nwill get experience.'\n\n'He has it already, Sahib--as a fish controls the water he swims in.\nBut for every reason it will be well to loose him from the school.'\n\n'Very good, then,' said Creighton, half to himself.  'He can go with\nthe lama, and if Hurree Babu cares to keep an eye on them so much the\nbetter.  He won't lead the boy into any danger as Mahbub would.\nCurious--his wish to be an F R S. Very human, too.  He is best on the\nEthnological side--Hurree.'\n\nNo money and no preferment would have drawn Creighton from his work on\nthe Indian Survey, but deep in his heart also lay the ambition to write\n'F R S' after his name.  Honours of a sort he knew could be obtained by\ningenuity and the help of friends, but, to the best of his belief,\nnothing save work--papers representing a life of it--took a man into\nthe Society which he had bombarded for years with monographs on strange\nAsiatic cults and unknown customs.  Nine men out of ten would flee from\na Royal Society soiree in extremity of boredom; but Creighton was the\ntenth, and at times his soul yearned for the crowded rooms in easy\nLondon where silver-haired, bald-headed gentlemen who know nothing of\nthe Army move among spectroscopic experiments, the lesser plants of the\nfrozen tundras, electric flight-measuring machines, and apparatus for\nslicing into fractional millimetres the left eye of the female\nmosquito.  By all right and reason, it was the Royal Geographical that\nshould have appealed to him, but men are as chancy as children in their\nchoice of playthings.  So Creighton smiled, and thought the better of\nHurree Babu, moved by like desire.\n\nHe dropped the ghost-dagger and looked up at Mahbub.\n\n'How soon can we get the colt from the stable?'  said the horse-dealer,\nreading his eyes.\n\n'Hmm!  If I withdraw him by order now--what will he do, think you?  I\nhave never before assisted at the teaching of such an one.'\n\n'He will come to me,' said Mahbub promptly.  'Lurgan Sahib and I will\nprepare him for the Road.'\n\n'So be it, then.  For six months he shall run at his choice.  But who\nwill be his sponsor?'\n\nLurgan slightly inclined his head.  'He will not tell anything, if that\nis what you are afraid of, Colonel Creighton.'\n\n'It's only a boy, after all.'\n\n'Ye-es; but first, he has nothing to tell; and secondly, he knows what\nwould happen.  Also, he is very fond of Mahbub, and of me a little.'\n\n'Will he draw pay?'  demanded the practical horse-dealer.\n\n'Food and water allowance only.  Twenty rupees a month.'\n\nOne advantage of the Secret Service is that it has no worrying audit.\nThat Service is ludicrously starved, of course, but the funds are\nadministered by a few men who do not call for vouchers or present\nitemized accounts.  Mahbub's eyes lighted with almost a Sikh's love of\nmoney.  Even Lurgan's impassive face changed.  He considered the years\nto come when Kim would have been entered and made to the Great Game\nthat never ceases day and night, throughout India.  He foresaw honour\nand credit in the mouths of a chosen few, coming to him from his pupil.\nLurgan Sahib had made E.23 what E.23 was, out of a bewildered,\nimpertinent, lying, little North-West Province man.\n\nBut the joy of these masters was pale and smoky beside the joy of Kim\nwhen St Xavier's Head called him aside, with word that Colonel\nCreighton had sent for him.\n\n'I understand, O'Hara, that he has found you a place as an assistant\nchain-man in the Canal Department:  that comes of taking up\nmathematics.  It is great luck for you, for you are only sixteen; but\nof course you understand that you do not become pukka [permanent] till\nyou have passed the autumn examination.  So you must not think you are\ngoing out into the world to enjoy yourself, or that your fortune is\nmade.  There is a great deal of hard work before you. Only, if you\nsucceed in becoming pukka, you can rise, you know, to four hundred and\nfifty a month.'  Whereat the Principal gave him much good advice as to\nhis conduct, and his manners, and his morals; and others, his elders,\nwho had not been wafted into billets, talked as only Anglo-Indian lads\ncan, of favouritism and corruption.  Indeed, young Cazalet, whose\nfather was a pensioner at Chunar, hinted very broadly that Colonel\nCreighton's interest in Kim was directly paternal; and Kim, instead of\nretaliating, did not even use language.  He was thinking of the immense\nfun to come, of Mahbub's letter of the day before, all neatly written\nin English, making appointment for that afternoon in a house the very\nname of which would have crisped the Principal's hair with horror...\n\nSaid Kim to Mahbub in Lucknow railway station that evening, above the\nluggage-scales:  'I feared lest at the last, the roof would fall upon\nme and cheat me.  It is indeed all finished, O my father?'\n\nMahbub snapped his fingers to show the utterness of that end, and his\neyes blazed like red coals.\n\n'Then where is the pistol that I may wear it?'\n\n'Softly!  A half-year, to run without heel-ropes.  I begged that much\nfrom Colonel Creighton Sahib.  At twenty rupees a month.  Old Red Hat\nknows that thou art coming.'\n\n'I will pay thee dustoorie [commission] on my pay for three months,'\nsaid Kim gravely.  'Yea, two rupees a month.  But first we must get rid\nof these.'  He plucked his thin linen trousers and dragged at his\ncollar.  'I have brought with me all that I need on the Road.  My trunk\nhas gone up to Lurgan Sahib's.'\n\n'Who sends his salaams to thee--Sahib.'\n\n'Lurgan Sahib is a very clever man.  But what dost thou do?'\n\n'I go North again, upon the Great Game.  What else?  Is thy mind still\nset on following old Red Hat?'\n\n'Do not forget he made me that I am--though he did not know it. Year by\nyear, he sent the money that taught me.'\n\n'I would have done as much--had it struck my thick head,' Mahbub\ngrowled.  'Come away.  The lamps are lit now, and none will mark thee\nin the bazar.  We go to Huneefa's house.'\n\nOn the way thither, Mahbub gave him much the same sort of advice as his\nmother gave to Lemuel, and curiously enough, Mahbub was exact to point\nout how Huneefa and her likes destroyed kings.\n\n'And I remember,' he quoted maliciously, 'one who said, \"Trust a snake\nbefore an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub Ali.\" Now,\nexcepting as to Pathans, of whom I am one, all that is true. Most true\nis it in the Great Game, for it is by means of women that all plans\ncome to ruin and we lie out in the dawning with our throats cut.  So it\nhappened to such a one.'  He gave the reddest particulars.\n\n'Then why--?'  Kim paused before a filthy staircase that climbed to the\nwarm darkness of an upper chamber, in the ward that is behind Azim\nUllah's tobacco-shop.  Those who know it call it The Birdcage--it is so\nfull of whisperings and whistlings and chirrupings.\n\nThe room, with its dirty cushions and half-smoked hookahs, smelt\nabominably of stale tobacco.  In one corner lay a huge and shapeless\nwoman clad in greenish gauzes, and decked, brow, nose, ear, neck,\nwrist, arm, waist, and ankle with heavy native jewellery.  When she\nturned it was like the clashing of copper pots.  A lean cat in the\nbalcony outside the window mewed hungrily.  Kim checked, bewildered, at\nthe door-curtain.\n\n'Is that the new stuff, Mahbub?'  said Huneefa lazily, scarce troubling\nto remove the mouthpiece from her lips.  'O Buktanoos!'--like most of\nher kind, she swore by the Djinns--'O Buktanoos!  He is very good to\nlook upon.'\n\n'That is part of the selling of the horse,' Mahbub explained to Kim,\nwho laughed.\n\n'I have heard that talk since my Sixth Day,' he replied, squatting by\nthe light.  'Whither does it lead?'\n\n'To protection.  Tonight we change thy colour.  This sleeping under\nroofs has blanched thee like an almond.  But Huneefa has the secret of\na colour that catches.  No painting of a day or two.  Also, we fortify\nthee against the chances of the Road.  That is my gift to thee, my son.\nTake out all metals on thee and lay them here.  Make ready, Huneefa.'\n\nKim dragged forth his compass, Survey paint-box, and the new-filled\nmedicine-box.  They had all accompanied his travels, and boylike he\nvalued them immensely.\n\nThe woman rose slowly and moved with her hands a little spread before\nher.  Then Kim saw that she was blind.  'No, no,' she muttered, 'the\nPathan speaks truth--my colour does not go in a week or a month, and\nthose whom I protect are under strong guard.'\n\n'When one is far off and alone, it would not be well to grow blotched\nand leprous of a sudden,' said Mahbub.  'When thou wast with me I could\noversee the matter.  Besides, a Pathan is a fair-skin. Strip to the\nwaist now and look how thou art whitened.'  Huneefa felt her way back\nfrom an inner room.  'It is no matter, she cannot see.' He took a\npewter bowl from her ringed hand.\n\nThe dye-stuff showed blue and gummy.  Kim experimented on the back of\nhis wrist, with a dab of cotton-wool; but Huneefa heard him.\n\n'No, no,' she cried, 'the thing is not done thus, but with the proper\nceremonies.  The colouring is the least part.  I give thee the full\nprotection of the Road.'\n\n'Tadoo?  [magic],'said Kim, with a half start.  He did not like the\nwhite, sightless eyes.  Mahbub's hand on his neck bowed him to the\nfloor, nose within an inch of the boards.\n\n'Be still.  No harm comes to thee, my son.  I am thy sacrifice!'\n\nHe could not see what the woman was about, but heard the dish-clash of\nher jewellery for many minutes.  A match lit up the darkness; he caught\nthe well-known purr and fizzle of grains of incense.  Then the room\nfilled with smoke--heavy aromatic, and stupefying.  Through growing\ndrowse he heard the names of devils--of Zulbazan, Son of Eblis, who\nlives in bazars and paraos, making all the sudden lewd wickedness of\nwayside halts; of Dulhan, invisible about mosques, the dweller among\nthe slippers of the faithful, who hinders folk from their prayers; and\nMusboot, Lord of lies and panic.  Huneefa, now whispering in his ear,\nnow talking as from an immense distance, touched him with horrible soft\nfingers, but Mahbub's grip never shifted from his neck till, relaxing\nwith a sigh, the boy lost his senses.\n\n'Allah!  How he fought!  We should never have done it but for the\ndrugs.  That was his white blood, I take it,' said Mahbub testily. 'Go\non with the dawut [invocation].  Give him full Protection.'\n\n'O Hearer!  Thou that hearest with ears, be present.  Listen, O\nHearer!'  Huneefa moaned, her dead eyes turned to the west.  The dark\nroom filled with moanings and snortings.\n\nFrom the outer balcony, a ponderous figure raised a round bullet head\nand coughed nervously.\n\n'Do not interrupt this ventriloquial necromanciss, my friend,' it said\nin English.  'I opine that it is very disturbing to you, but no\nenlightened observer is jolly-well upset.'\n\n'..........I will lay a plot for their ruin!  O Prophet, bear with the\nunbelievers.  Let them alone awhile!'  Huneefa's face, turned to the\nnorthward, worked horribly, and it was as though voices from the\nceiling answered her.\n\nHurree Babu returned to his note-book, balanced on the window-sill, but\nhis hand shook.  Huneefa, in some sort of drugged ecstasy, wrenched\nherself to and fro as she sat cross-legged by Kim's still head, and\ncalled upon devil after devil, in the ancient order of the ritual,\nbinding them to avoid the boy's every action.\n\n'With Him are the keys of the Secret Things!  None knoweth them besides\nHimself He knoweth that which is in the dry land and in the sea!'\nAgain broke out the unearthly whistling responses.\n\n'I--I apprehend it is not at all malignant in its operation?'  said the\nBabu, watching the throat-muscles quiver and jerk as Huneefa spoke with\ntongues.  'It--it is not likely that she has killed the boy?  If so, I\ndecline to be witness at the trial .....What was the last hypothetical\ndevil mentioned?'\n\n'Babuji,' said Mahbub in the vernacular.  'I have no regard for the\ndevils of Hind, but the Sons of Eblis are far otherwise, and whether\nthey be jumalee [well-affected] or jullalee [terrible] they love not\nKafirs.'\n\n'Then you think I had better go?'  said Hurree Babu, half rising. 'They\nare, of course, dematerialized phenomena.  Spencer says.'\n\nHuneefa's crisis passed, as these things must, in a paroxysm of\nhowling, with a touch of froth at the lips.  She lay spent and\nmotionless beside Kim, and the crazy voices ceased.\n\n'Wah!  That work is done.  May the boy be better for it; and Huneefa is\nsurely a mistress of dawut.  Help haul her aside, Babu.  Do not be\nafraid.'\n\n'How am I to fear the absolutely non-existent?'  said Hurree Babu,\ntalking English to reassure himself.  It is an awful thing still to\ndread the magic that you contemptuously investigate--to collect\nfolk-lore for the Royal Society with a lively belief in all Powers of\nDarkness.\n\nMahbub chuckled.  He had been out with Hurree on the Road ere now. 'Let\nus finish the colouring,' said he.  'The boy is well protected if--if\nthe Lords of the Air have ears to hear.  I am a Sufi [free-thinker],\nbut when one can get blind-sides of a woman, a stallion, or a devil,\nwhy go round to invite a kick?  Set him upon the way, Babu, and see\nthat old Red Hat does not lead him beyond our reach.  I must get back\nto my horses.'\n\n'All raight,' said Hurree Babu.  'He is at present curious spectacle.'\n\nAbout third cockcrow, Kim woke after a sleep of thousands of years.\nHuneefa, in her corner, snored heavily, but Mahbub was gone.\n\n'I hope you were not frightened,' said an oily voice at his elbow. 'I\nsuperintended entire operation, which was most interesting from\nethnological point of view.  It was high-class dawut.'\n\n'Huh!'  said Kim, recognizing Hurree Babu, who smiled ingratiatingly.\n\n'And also I had honour to bring down from Lurgan your present costume.\nI am not in the habit offeecially of carrying such gauds to\nsubordinates, but'--he giggled--'your case is noted as exceptional on\nthe books.  I hope Mr Lurgan will note my action.'\n\nKim yawned and stretched himself.  It was good to turn and twist within\nloose clothes once again.\n\n'What is this?'  He looked curiously at the heavy duffle-stuff loaded\nwith the scents of the far North.\n\n'Oho!  That is inconspicuous dress of chela attached to service of\nlamaistic lama.  Complete in every particular,' said Hurree Babu,\nrolling into the balcony to clean his teeth at a goglet.  'I am of\nopeenion it is not your old gentleman's precise releegion, but rather\nsub-variant of same.  I have contributed rejected notes To Whom It May\nConcern:  Asiatic Quarterly Review on these subjects.  Now it is\ncurious that the old gentleman himself is totally devoid of\nreleegiosity.  He is not a dam' particular.'\n\n'Do you know him?'\n\nHurree Babu held up his hand to show he was engaged in the prescribed\nrites that accompany tooth-cleaning and such things among decently bred\nBengalis.  Then he recited in English an Arya-Somaj prayer of a\ntheistical nature, and stuffed his mouth with pan and betel.\n\n'Oah yes.  I have met him several times at Benares, and also at Buddh\nGaya, to interrogate him on releegious points and devil-worship.  He is\npure agnostic--same as me.'\n\nHuneefa stirred in her sleep, and Hurree Babu jumped nervously to the\ncopper incense-burner, all black and discoloured in morning-light,\nrubbed a finger in the accumulated lamp-black, and drew it diagonally\nacross his face.\n\n'Who has died in thy house?'  asked Kim in the vernacular.\n\n'None.  But she may have the Evil Eye--that sorceress,' the Babu\nreplied.\n\n'What dost thou do now, then?'\n\n'I will set thee on thy way to Benares, if thou goest thither, and tell\nthee what must be known by Us.'\n\n'I go.  At what hour runs the te-rain?'  He rose to his feet, looked\nround the desolate chamber and at the yellow-wax face of Huneefa as the\nlow sun stole across the floor.  'Is there money to be paid that witch?'\n\n'No.  She has charmed thee against all devils and all dangers in the\nname of her devils.  It was Mahbub's desire.'  In English:  'He is\nhighly obsolete, I think, to indulge in such supersteetion.  Why, it is\nall ventriloquy.  Belly-speak--eh?'\n\nKim snapped his fingers mechanically to avert whatever evil--Mahbub, he\nknew, meditated none--might have crept in through Huneefa's\nministrations; and Hurree giggled once more.  But as he crossed the\nroom he was careful not to step in Huneefa's blotched, squat shadow on\nthe boards.  Witches--when their time is on them--can lay hold of the\nheels of a man's soul if he does that.\n\n'Now you must well listen,' said the Babu when they were in the fresh\nair.  'Part of these ceremonies which we witnessed they include supply\nof effeecient amulet to those of our Department.  If you feel in your\nneck you will find one small silver amulet, verree cheap. That is ours.\nDo you understand?'\n\n'Oah yes, hawa-dilli [a heart-lifter],' said Kim, feeling at his neck.\n\n'Huneefa she makes them for two rupees twelve annas with--oh, all sorts\nof exorcisms.  They are quite common, except they are partially black\nenamel, and there is a paper inside each one full of names of local\nsaints and such things.  Thatt is Huneefa's look-out, you see? Huneefa\nmakes them onlee for us, but in case she does not, when we get them we\nput in, before issue, one small piece of turquoise.  Mr Lurgan he gives\nthem.  There is no other source of supply; but it was me invented all\nthis.  It is strictly unoffeecial of course, but convenient for\nsubordinates.  Colonel Creighton he does not know.  He is European.\nThe turquoise is wrapped in the paper ...  Yes, that is road to railway\nstation ...  Now suppose you go with the lama, or with me, I hope, some\nday, or with Mahbub.  Suppose we get into a dam'-tight place.  I am a\nfearful man--most fearful--but I tell you I have been in dam'-tight\nplaces more than hairs on my head.  You say:  \"I am Son of the Charm.\"\nVerree good.'\n\n'I do not understand quite.  We must not be heard talking English here.'\n\n'That is all raight.  I am only Babu showing off my English to you. All\nwe Babus talk English to show off;' said Hurree, flinging his\nshoulder-cloth jauntily.  'As I was about to say, \"Son of the Charm\"\nmeans that you may be member of the Sat Bhai--the Seven Brothers, which\nis Hindi and Tantric.  It is popularly supposed to be extinct Society,\nbut I have written notes to show it is still extant.  You see, it is\nall my invention.  Verree good.  Sat Bhai has many members, and perhaps\nbefore they jolly-well-cut-your-throat they may give you just a chance\nof life.  That is useful, anyhow.  And moreover, these foolish\nnatives--if they are not too excited--they always stop to think before\nthey kill a man who says he belongs to any speecific organization.  You\nsee?  You say then when you are in tight place, \"I am Son of the\nCharm\", and you get--perhaps--ah--your second wind. That is only in\nextreme instances, or to open negotiations with a stranger.  Can you\nquite see?  Verree good.  But suppose now, I, or any one of the\nDepartment, come to you dressed quite different.  You would not know me\nat all unless I choose, I bet you.  Some day I will prove it.  I come\nas Ladakhi trader--oh, anything--and I say to you:  \"You want to buy\nprecious stones?\"  You say:  \"Do I look like a man who buys precious\nstones?\"  Then I say:  \"Even verree poor man can buy a turquoise or\ntarkeean.\"'\n\n'That is kichree--vegetable curry,' said Kim.\n\n'Of course it is.  You say:  \"Let me see the tarkeean.\"  Then I say:\n\"It was cooked by a woman, and perhaps it is bad for your caste.\" Then\nyou say:  \"There is no caste when men go to--look for tarkeean.\"  You\nstop a little between those words, \"to--look\".  That is thee whole\nsecret.  The little stop before the words.'\n\nKim repeated the test-sentence.\n\n'That is all right.  Then I will show you my turquoise if there is\ntime, and then you know who I am, and then we exchange views and\ndocuments and those-all things.  And so it is with any other man of us.\nWe talk sometimes about turquoises and sometimes about tarkeean, but\nalways with that little stop in the words.  It is verree easy. First,\n\"Son of the Charm\", if you are in a tight place.  Perhaps that may help\nyou--perhaps not.  Then what I have told you about the tarkeean, if you\nwant to transact offeecial business with a strange man.  Of course, at\npresent, you have no offeecial business.  You are--ah\nha!--supernumerary on probation.  Quite unique specimen.  If you were\nAsiatic of birth you might be employed right off; but this half-year of\nleave is to make you de-Englishized, you see?  The lama he expects you,\nbecause I have demi-offeecially informed him you have passed all your\nexaminations, and will soon obtain Government appointment.  Oh ho!  You\nare on acting-allowance, you see:  so if you are called upon to help\nSons of the Charm mind you jolly-well try. Now I shall say good-bye, my\ndear fellow, and I hope you--ah--will come out top-side all raight.'\n\nHurree Babu stepped back a pace or two into the crowd at the entrance\nof Lucknow station and--was gone.  Kim drew a deep breath and hugged\nhimself all over.  The nickel-plated revolver he could feel in the\nbosom of his sad-coloured robe, the amulet was on his neck;\nbegging-gourd, rosary, and ghost-dagger (Mr Lurgan had forgotten\nnothing) were all to hand, with medicine, paint-box, and compass, and\nin a worn old purse-belt embroidered with porcupine-quill patterns lay\na month's pay.  Kings could be no richer.  He bought sweetmeats in a\nleaf-cup from a Hindu trader, and ate them with glad rapture till a\npoliceman ordered him off the steps.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 11\n\n\n  Give the man who is not made\n  To his trade\n  Swords to fling and catch again,\n  Coins to ring and snatch again,\n  Men to harm and cure again,\n  Snakes to charm and lure again--\n  He'll be hurt by his own blade,\n  By his serpents disobeyed,\n  By his clumsiness bewrayed,'\n  By the people mocked to scorn--\n  So 'tis not with juggler born!\n  Pinch of dust or withered flower,\n  Chance-flung fruit or borrowed staff,\n  Serve his need and shore his power,\n  Bind the spell, or loose the laugh!\n  But a man who, etc.\n\n  The Juggler's Song, op. 15\n\n\nFollowed a sudden natural reaction.\n\n'Now am I alone--all alone,' he thought.  'In all India is no one so\nalone as I! If I die today, who shall bring the news--and to whom? If I\nlive and God is good, there will be a price upon my head, for I am a\nSon of the Charm--I, Kim.'\n\nA very few white people, but many Asiatics, can throw themselves into a\nmazement as it were by repeating their own names over and over again to\nthemselves, letting the mind go free upon speculation as to what is\ncalled personal identity.  When one grows older, the power, usually,\ndeparts, but while it lasts it may descend upon a man at any moment.\n\n'Who is Kim--Kim--Kim?'\n\nHe squatted in a corner of the clanging waiting-room, rapt from all\nother thoughts; hands folded in lap, and pupils contracted to\npin-points.  In a minute--in another half-second--he felt he would\narrive at the solution of the tremendous puzzle; but here, as always\nhappens, his mind dropped away from those heights with a rush of a\nwounded bird, and passing his hand before his eyes, he shook his head.\n\nA long-haired Hindu bairagi [holy man], who had just bought a ticket,\nhalted before him at that moment and stared intently.\n\n'I also have lost it,' he said sadly.  'It is one of the Gates to the\nWay, but for me it has been shut many years.'\n\n'What is the talk?'  said Kim, abashed.\n\n'Thou wast wondering there in thy spirit what manner of thing thy soul\nmight be.  The seizure came of a sudden.  I know.  Who should know but\nI? Whither goest thou?'\n\n'Toward Kashi [Benares].'\n\n'There are no Gods there.  I have proved them.  I go to Prayag\n[Allahabad] for the fifth time--seeking the Road to Enlightenment. Of\nwhat faith art thou?'\n\n'I too am a Seeker,' said Kim, using one of the lama's pet words.\n'Though'--he forgot his Northern dress for the moment--'though Allah\nalone knoweth what I seek.'\n\nThe old fellow slipped the bairagi's crutch under his armpit and sat\ndown on a patch of ruddy leopard's skin as Kim rose at the call for the\nBenares train.\n\n'Go in hope, little brother,' he said.  'It is a long road to the feet\nof the One; but thither do we all travel.'\n\nKim did not feel so lonely after this, and ere he had sat out twenty\nmiles in the crowded compartment, was cheering his neighbours with a\nstring of most wonderful yarns about his own and his master's magical\ngifts.\n\nBenares struck him as a peculiarly filthy city, though it was pleasant\nto find how his cloth was respected.  At least one-third of the\npopulation prays eternally to some group or other of the many million\ndeities, and so reveres every sort of holy man.  Kim was guided to the\nTemple of the Tirthankars, about a mile outside the city, near Sarnath,\nby a chance-met Punjabi farmer--a Kamboh from Jullundur-way who had\nappealed in vain to every God of his homestead to cure his small son,\nand was trying Benares as a last resort.\n\n'Thou art from the North?'  he asked, shouldering through the press of\nthe narrow, stinking streets much like his own pet bull at home.\n\n'Ay, I know the Punjab.  My mother was a pahareen, but my father came\nfrom Amritzar--by Jandiala,' said Kim, oiling his ready tongue for the\nneeds of the Road.\n\n'Jandiala--Jullundur?  Oho!  Then we be neighbours in some sort, as it\nwere.'  He nodded tenderly to the wailing child in his arms.  'Whom\ndost thou serve?'\n\n'A most holy man at the Temple of the Tirthankers.'\n\n'They are all most holy and--most greedy,' said the Jat with\nbitterness.  'I have walked the pillars and trodden the temples till my\nfeet are flayed, and the child is no whit better.  And the mother being\nsick too ...  Hush, then, little one ...  We changed his name when the\nfever came.  We put him into girl's clothes.  There was nothing we did\nnot do, except--I said to his mother when she bundled me off to\nBenares--she should have come with me--I said Sakhi Sarwar Sultan would\nserve us best.  We know His generosity, but these down-country Gods are\nstrangers.'\n\nThe child turned on the cushion of the huge corded arms and looked at\nKim through heavy eyelids.\n\n'And was it all worthless?'  Kim asked, with easy interest.\n\n'All worthless--all worthless,' said the child, lips cracking with\nfever.\n\n'The Gods have given him a good mind, at least' said the father\nproudly.  'To think he should have listened so cleverly.  Yonder is thy\nTemple.  Now I am a poor man--many priests have dealt with me--but my\nson is my son, and if a gift to thy master can cure him--I am at my\nvery wits' end.'\n\nKim considered for a while, tingling with pride.  Three years ago he\nwould have made prompt profit on the situation and gone his way without\na thought; but now, the very respect the Jat paid him proved that he\nwas a man.  Moreover, he had tasted fever once or twice already, and\nknew enough to recognize starvation when he saw it.\n\n'Call him forth and I will give him a bond on my best yoke, so that the\nchild is cured.'\n\nKim halted at the carved outer door of the temple.  A white-clad Oswal\nbanker from Ajmir, his sins of usury new wiped out, asked him what he\ndid.\n\n'I am chela to Teshoo Lama, an Holy One from Bhotiyal--within there. He\nbade me come.  I wait.  Tell him.'\n\n'Do not forget the child,' cried the importunate Jat over his shoulder,\nand then bellowed in Punjabi; 'O Holy One--O disciple of the Holy\nOne--O Gods above all the Worlds--behold affliction sitting at the\ngate!'  That cry is so common in Benares that the passers never turned\ntheir heads.\n\nThe Oswal, at peace with mankind, carried the message into the darkness\nbehind him, and the easy, uncounted Eastern minutes slid by; for the\nlama was asleep in his cell, and no priest would wake him.  When the\nclick of his rosary again broke the hush of the inner court where the\ncalm images of the Arhats stand, a novice whispered, 'Thy chela is\nhere,' and the old man strode forth, forgetting the end of that prayer.\n\nHardly had the tall figure shown in the doorway than the Jat ran before\nhim, and, lifting up the child, cried:  'Look upon this, Holy One; and\nif the Gods will, he lives--he lives!'\n\nHe fumbled in his waist-belt and drew out a small silver coin.\n\n'What is now?'  The lama's eyes turned to Kim.  It was noticeable he\nspoke far clearer Urdu than long ago, under ZamZammah; but father would\nallow no private talk.\n\n'It is no more than a fever,' said Kim.  'The child is not well fed.'\n\n'He sickens at everything, and his mother is not here.'\n\n'If it be permitted, I may cure, Holy One.'\n\n'What!  Have they made thee a healer?  Wait here,' said the lama, and\nhe sat down by the Jat upon the lowest step of the temple, while Kim,\nlooking out of the corner of his eyes, slowly opened the little\nbetel-box.  He had dreamed dreams at school of returning to the lama as\na Sahib--of chaffing the old man before he revealed himself--boy's\ndreams all.  There was more drama in this abstracted, brow-puckered\nsearch through the tabloid-bottles, with a pause here and there for\nthought and a muttered invocation between whiles.  Quinine he had in\ntablets, and dark brown meat-lozenges--beef most probably, but that was\nnot his business.  The little thing would not eat, but it sucked at a\nlozenge greedily, and said it liked the salt taste.\n\n'Take then these six.'  Kim handed them to the man.  'Praise the Gods,\nand boil three in milk; other three in water.  After he has drunk the\nmilk give him this' (it was the half of a quinine pill), 'and wrap him\nwarm.  Give him the water of the other three, and the other half of\nthis white pill when he wakes.  Meantime, here is another brown\nmedicine that he may suck at on the way home.'\n\n'Gods, what wisdom!'  said the Kamboh, snatching.\n\nIt was as much as Kim could remember of his own treatment in a bout of\nautumn malaria--if you except the patter that he added to impress the\nlama.\n\n'Now go!  Come again in the morning.'\n\n'But the price--the price,' said the Jat, and threw back his sturdy\nshoulders.  'My son is my son.  Now that he will be whole again, how\nshall I go back to his mother and say I took help by the wayside and\ndid not even give a bowl of curds in return?'\n\n'They are alike, these Jats,' said Kim softly.  'The Jat stood on his\ndunghill and the King's elephants went by.  \"O driver,\" said he, \"what\nwill you sell those little donkeys for?\"'\n\nThe Jat burst into a roar of laughter, stifled with apologies to the\nlama.  'It is the saying of my own country the very talk of it.  So are\nwe Jats all.  I will come tomorrow with the child; and the blessing of\nthe Gods of the Homesteads--who are good little Gods--be on you both\n...  Now, son, we grow strong again.  Do not spit it out, little\nPrinceling!  King of my Heart, do not spit it out, and we shall be\nstrong men, wrestlers and club-wielders, by morning.'\n\nHe moved away, crooning and mumbling.  The lama turned to Kim, and all\nthe loving old soul of him looked out through his narrow eyes.\n\n'To heal the sick is to acquire merit; but first one gets knowledge.\nThat was wisely done, O Friend of all the World.'\n\n'I was made wise by thee, Holy One,' said Kim, forgetting the little\nplay just ended; forgetting St Xavier's; forgetting his white blood;\nforgetting even the Great Game as he stooped, Mohammedan-fashion, to\ntouch his master's feet in the dust of the Jain temple.  'My teaching I\nowe to thee.  I have eaten thy bread three years.  My time is finished.\nI am loosed from the schools.  I come to thee.'\n\n'Herein is my reward.  Enter!  Enter!  And is all well?'  They passed\nto the inner court, where the afternoon sun sloped golden across.\n'Stand that I may see.  So!'  He peered critically.  'It is no longer a\nchild, but a man, ripened in wisdom, walking as a physician.  I did\nwell--I did well when I gave thee up to the armed men on that black\nnight.  Dost thou remember our first day under Zam-Zammah?'\n\n'Ay,' said Kim.  'Dost thou remember when I leapt off the carriage the\nfirst day I went to--'\n\n'The Gates of Learning?  Truly.  And the day that we ate the cakes\ntogether at the back of the river by Nucklao.  Aha!  Many times hast\nthou begged for me, but that day I begged for thee.'\n\n'Good reason,' quoth Kim.  'I was then a scholar in the Gates of\nLearning, and attired as a Sahib.  Do not forget, Holy One,' he went on\nplayfully.  'I am still a Sahib--by thy favour.'\n\n'True.  And a Sahib in most high esteem.  Come to my cell, chela.'\n\n'How is that known to thee?'\n\nThe lama smiled.  'First by means of letters from the kindly priest\nwhom we met in the camp of armed men; but he is now gone to his own\ncountry, and I sent the money to his brother.'  Colonel Creighton, who\nhad succeeded to the trusteeship when Father Victor went to England\nwith the Mavericks, was hardly the Chaplain's brother.  'But I do not\nwell understand Sahibs' letters.  They must be interpreted to me.  I\nchose a surer way.  Many times when I returned from my Search to this\nTemple, which has always been a nest to me, there came one seeking\nEnlightenment--a man from Leh--that had been, he said, a Hindu, but\nwearied of all those Gods.'  The lama pointed to the Arhats.\n\n'A fat man?'  said Kim, a twinkle in his eye.\n\n'Very fat; but I perceived in a little his mind was wholly given up to\nuseless things--such as devils and charms and the form and fashion of\nour tea-drinkings in the monasteries, and by what road we initiated the\nnovices.  A man abounding in questions; but he was a friend of thine,\nchela.  He told me that thou wast on the road to much honour as a\nscribe.  And I see thou art a physician.'\n\n'Yes, that am I--a scribe, when I am a Sahib, but it is set aside when\nI come as thy disciple.  I have accomplished the years appointed for a\nSahib.'\n\n'As it were a novice?'  said the lama, nodding his head.  'Art thou\nfreed from the schools?  I would not have thee unripe.'\n\n'I am all free.  In due time I take service under the Government as a\nscribe--'\n\n'Not as a warrior.  That is well.'\n\n'But first I come to wander with thee.  Therefore I am here.  Who begs\nfor thee, these days?'  he went on quickly.  The ice was thin.\n\n'Very often I beg myself; but, as thou knowest, I am seldom here,\nexcept when I come to look again at my disciple.  From one end to\nanother of Hind have I travelled afoot and in the te-rain.  A great and\na wonderful land!  But here, when I put in, is as though I were in my\nown Bhotiyal.'\n\nHe looked round the little clean cell complacently.  A low cushion gave\nhim a seat, on which he had disposed himself in the cross-legged\nattitude of the Bodhisat emerging from meditation; a black teak-wood\ntable, not twenty inches high, set with copper tea-cups, was before\nhim.  In one corner stood a tiny altar, also of heavily carved teak,\nbearing a copper-gilt image of the seated Buddha and fronted by a lamp,\nan incense-holder, and a pair of copper flower-pots.\n\n'The Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House acquired merit by giving\nme these a year since,' he said, following Kim's eye.  'When one is far\nfrom one's own land such things carry remembrance; and we must\nreverence the Lord for that He showed the Way.  See!'  He pointed to a\ncuriously-built mound of coloured rice crowned with a fantastic metal\nornament.  'When I was Abbot in my own place--before I came to better\nknowledge I made that offering daily.  It is the Sacrifice of the\nUniverse to the Lord.  Thus do we of Bhotiyal offer all the world daily\nto the Excellent Law.  And I do it even now, though I know that the\nExcellent One is beyond all pinchings and pattings.'  He snuffed from\nhis gourd.\n\n'It is well done, Holy One,' Kim murmured, sinking at ease on the\ncushions, very happy and rather tired.\n\n'And also,' the old man chuckled, 'I write pictures of the Wheel of\nLife.  Three days to a picture.  I was busied on it--or it may be I\nshut my eyes a little--when they brought word of thee.  It is good to\nhave thee here:  I will show thee my art--not for pride's sake, but\nbecause thou must learn.  The Sahibs have not all this world's wisdom.'\n\nHe drew from under the table a sheet of strangely scented yellow\nChinese paper, the brushes, and slab of Indian ink.  In cleanest,\nseverest outline he had traced the Great Wheel with its six spokes,\nwhose centre is the conjoined Hog, Snake, and Dove (Ignorance, Anger,\nand Lust), and whose compartments are all the Heavens and Hells, and\nall the chances of human life.  Men say that the Bodhisat Himself first\ndrew it with grains of rice upon dust, to teach His disciples the cause\nof things.  Many ages have crystallized it into a most wonderful\nconvention crowded with hundreds of little figures whose every line\ncarries a meaning.  Few can translate the picture-parable; there are\nnot twenty in all the world who can draw it surely without a copy:  of\nthose who can both draw and expound are but three.\n\n'I have a little learned to draw,' said Kim.  'But this is a marvel\nbeyond marvels.'\n\n'I have written it for many years,' said the lama.  'Time was when I\ncould write it all between one lamp-lighting and the next.  I will\nteach thee the art--after due preparation; and I will show thee the\nmeaning of the Wheel.'\n\n'We take the Road, then?'\n\n'The Road and our Search.  I was but waiting for thee.  It was made\nplain to me in a hundred dreams--notably one that came upon the night\nof the day that the Gates of Learning first shut that without thee I\nshould never find my River.  Again and again, as thou knowest, I put\nthis from me, fearing an illusion.  Therefore I would not take thee\nwith me that day at Lucknow, when we ate the cakes.  I would not take\nthee till the time was ripe and auspicious.  From the Hills to the Sea,\nfrom the Sea to the Hills have I gone, but it was vain. Then I\nremembered the Tataka.'\n\nHe told Kim the story of the elephant with the leg-iron, as he had told\nit so often to the Jam priests.\n\n'Further testimony is not needed,' he ended serenely.  'Thou wast sent\nfor an aid.  That aid removed, my Search came to naught. Therefore we\nwill go out again together, and our Search sure.'\n\n'Whither go we?'\n\n'What matters, Friend of all the World?  The Search, I say, is sure. If\nneed be, the River will break from the ground before us.  I acquired\nmerit when I sent thee to the Gates of Learning, and gave thee the\njewel that is Wisdom.  Thou didst return, I saw even now, a follower of\nSakyamuni, the Physician, whose altars are many in Bhotiyal.  It is\nsufficient.  We are together, and all things are as they were--Friend\nof all the World--Friend of the Stars--my chela!'\n\nThen they talked of matters secular; but it was noticeable that the\nlama never demanded any details of life at St Xavier's, nor showed the\nfaintest curiosity as to the manners and customs of Sahibs.  His mind\nmoved all in the past, and he revived every step of their wonderful\nfirst journey together, rubbing his hands and chuckling, till it\npleased him to curl himself up into the sudden sleep of old age.\n\nKim watched the last dusty sunshine fade out of the court, and played\nwith his ghost-dagger and rosary.  The clamour of Benares, oldest of\nall earth's cities awake before the Gods, day and night, beat round the\nwalls as the sea's roar round a breakwater.  Now and again, a Jain\npriest crossed the court, with some small offering to the images, and\nswept the path about him lest by chance he should take the life of a\nliving thing.  A lamp twinkled, and there followed the sound of a\nprayer.  Kim watched the stars as they rose one after another in the\nstill, sticky dark, till he fell asleep at the foot of the altar.  That\nnight he dreamed in Hindustani, with never an English word...\n\n'Holy One, there is the child to whom we gave the medicine,' he said,\nabout three o'clock in the morning, when the lama, also waking from\ndreams, would have fared forth on pilgrimage.  'The Jat will be here at\nthe light.'\n\n'I am well answered.  In my haste I would have done a wrong.'  He sat\ndown on the cushions and returned to his rosary.  'Surely old folk are\nas children,' he said pathetically.  'They desire a matter--behold, it\nmust be done at once, or they fret and weep!  Many times when I was\nupon the Road I have been ready to stamp with my feet at the hindrance\nof an ox-cart in the way, or a mere cloud of dust. It was not so when I\nwas a man--a long time ago.  None the less it is wrongful--'\n\n'But thou art indeed old, Holy One.'\n\n'The thing was done.  A Cause was put out into the world, and, old or\nyoung, sick or sound, knowing or unknowing, who can rein in the effect\nof that Cause?  Does the Wheel hang still if a child spin it--or a\ndrunkard?  Chela, this is a great and a terrible world.'\n\n'I think it good,' Kim yawned.  'What is there to eat?  I have not\neaten since yesterday even.'\n\n'I had forgotten thy need.  Yonder is good Bhotiyal tea and cold rice.'\n\n'We cannot walk far on such stuff.'  Kim felt all the European's lust\nfor flesh-meat, which is not accessible in a Jain temple.  Yet, instead\nof going out at once with the begging-bowl, he stayed his stomach on\nslabs of cold rice till the full dawn.  It brought the farmer, voluble,\nstuttering with gratitude.\n\n'In the night the fever broke and the sweat came,' he cried.  'Feel\nhere--his skin is fresh and new!  He esteemed the salt lozenges, and\ntook milk with greed.'  He drew the cloth from the child's face, and it\nsmiled sleepily at Kim.  A little knot of Jain priests, silent but\nall-observant, gathered by the temple door.  They knew, and Kim knew\nthat they knew, how the old lama had met his disciple.  Being courteous\nfolk, they had not obtruded themselves overnight by presence, word, or\ngesture.  Wherefore Kim repaid them as the sun rose.\n\n'Thank the Gods of the Jains, brother,' he said, not knowing how those\nGods were named.  'The fever is indeed broken.'\n\n'Look!  See!'  The lama beamed in the background upon his hosts of\nthree years.  'Was there ever such a chela?  He follows our Lord the\nHealer.'\n\nNow the Jains officially recognize all the Gods of the Hindu creed, as\nwell as the Lingam and the Snake.  They wear the Brahminical thread;\nthey adhere to every claim of Hindu caste-law.  But, because they knew\nand loved the lama, because he was an old man, because he sought the\nWay, because he was their guest, and because he collogued long of\nnights with the head-priest--as free-thinking a metaphysician as ever\nsplit one hair into seventy--they murmured assent.\n\n'Remember,'--Kim bent over the child--.  'this trouble may come again.'\n\n'Not if thou hast the proper spell,' said the father.\n\n'But in a little while we go away.'\n\n'True,' said the lama to all the Jains.  'We go now together upon the\nSearch whereof I have often spoken.  I waited till my chela was ripe.\nBehold him!  We go North.  Never again shall I look upon this place of\nmy rest, O people of good will.'\n\n'But I am not a beggar.'  The cultivator rose to his feet, clutching\nthe child.\n\n'Be still.  Do not trouble the Holy One,' a priest cried.\n\n'Go,' Kim whispered.  'Meet us again under the big railway bridge, and\nfor the sake of all the Gods of our Punjab, bring food--curry, pulse,\ncakes fried in fat, and sweetmeats.  Specially sweetmeats.  Be swift!'\n\nThe pallor of hunger suited Kim very well as he stood, tall and slim,\nin his sand-coloured, sweeping robes, one hand on his rosary and the\nother in the attitude of benediction, faithfully copied from the lama.\nAn English observer might have said that he looked rather like the\nyoung saint of a stained-glass window, whereas he was but a growing lad\nfaint with emptiness.\n\nLong and formal were the farewells, thrice ended and thrice renewed.\nThe Seeker--he who had invited the lama to that haven from far-away\nTibet, a silver-faced, hairless ascetic--took no part in it, but\nmeditated, as always, alone among the images.  The others were very\nhuman; pressing small comforts upon the old man--a betel-box, a fine\nnew iron pencase, a food-bag, and such-like--warning him against the\ndangers of the world without, and prophesying a happy end to the\nSearch.  Meantime Kim, lonelier than ever, squatted on the steps, and\nswore to himself in the language of St Xavier's.\n\n'But it is my own fault,' he concluded.  'With Mahbub, I ate Mahbub's\nbread, or Lurgan Sahib's.  At St Xavier's, three meals a day.  Here I\nmust jolly-well look out for myself.  Besides, I am not in good\ntraining.  How I could eat a plate of beef now!  ...  Is it finished,\nHoly One?'\n\nThe lama, both hands raised, intoned a final blessing in ornate\nChinese.  'I must lean on thy shoulder,' said he, as the temple gates\nclosed.  'We grow stiff, I think.'\n\nThe weight of a six-foot man is not light to steady through miles of\ncrowded streets, and Kim, loaded down with bundles and packages for the\nway, was glad to reach the shadow of the railway bridge.\n\n'Here we eat,' he said resolutely, as the Kamboh, blue-robed and\nsmiling, hove in sight, a basket in one hand and the child in the other.\n\n'Fall to, Holy Ones!'  he cried from fifty yards.  (They were by the\nshoal under the first bridge-span, out of sight of hungry priests.)\n'Rice and good curry, cakes all warm and well scented with hing\n[asafoetida], curds and sugar.  King of my fields,'--this to the small\nson--'let us show these holy men that we Jats of Jullundur can pay a\nservice ...  I had heard the Jains would eat nothing that they had not\ncooked, but truly'--he looked away politely over the broad\nriver--'where there is no eye there is no caste.'\n\n'And we,' said Kim, turning his back and heaping a leafplatter for the\nlama, 'are beyond all castes.'\n\nThey gorged themselves on the good food in silence.  Nor till he had\nlicked the last of the sticky sweetstuff from his little finger did Kim\nnote that the Kamboh too was girt for travel.\n\n'If our roads lie together,' he said roughly, 'I go with thee.  One\ndoes not often find a worker of miracles, and the child is still weak.\nBut I am not altogether a reed.'  He picked up his lathi--a five-foot\nmale-bamboo ringed with bands of polished iron--and flourished it in\nthe air.  'The Jats are called quarrel-some, but that is not true.\nExcept when we are crossed, we are like our own buffaloes.'\n\n'So be it,' said Kim.  'A good stick is a good reason.'\n\nThe lama gazed placidly up-stream, where in long, smudged perspective\nthe ceaseless columns of smoke go up from the burning-ghats by the\nriver.  Now and again, despite all municipal regulations, the fragment\nof a half-burned body bobbed by on the full current.\n\n'But for thee,' said the Kamboh to Kim, drawing the child into his\nhairy breast, 'I might today have gone thither--with this one.  The\npriests tell us that Benares is holy--which none doubt--and desirable\nto die in.  But I do not know their Gods, and they ask for money; and\nwhen one has done one worship a shaved-head vows it is of none effect\nexcept one do another.  Wash here!  Wash there!  Pour, drink, lave, and\nscatter flowers--but always pay the priests.  No, the Punjab for me,\nand the soil of the Jullundur-doab for the best soil in it.'\n\n'I have said many times--in the Temple, I think--that if need be, the\nRiver will open at our feet.  We will therefore go North,' said the\nlama, rising.  'I remember a pleasant place, set about with\nfruit-trees, where one can walk in meditation--and the air is cooler\nthere.  It comes from the Hills and the snow of the Hills.'\n\n'What is the name?'  said Kim.\n\n'How should I know?  Didst thou not--no, that was after the Army rose\nout of the earth and took thee away.  I abode there in meditation in a\nroom against the dovecot--except when she talked eternally.'\n\n'Oho!  the woman from Kulu.  That is by Saharunpore.'  Kim laughed.\n\n'How does the spirit move thy master?  Does he go afoot, for the sake\nof past sins?'  the Jat demanded cautiously.  'It is a far cry to\nDelhi.'\n\n'No,' said Kim.  'I will beg a tikkut for the te-rain.'  One does not\nown to the possession of money in India.\n\n'Then, in the name of the Gods, let us take the fire-carriage.  My son\nis best in his mother's arms.  The Government has brought on us many\ntaxes, but it gives us one good thing--the te-rain that joins friends\nand unites the anxious.  A wonderful matter is the te-rain.'\n\nThey all piled into it a couple of hours later, and slept through the\nheat of the day.  The Kamboh plied Kim with ten thousand questions as\nto the lama's walk and work in life, and received some curious answers.\nKim was content to be where he was, to look out upon the flat\nNorth-Western landscape, and to talk to the changing mob of\nfellow-passengers.  Even today, tickets and ticket-clipping are dark\noppression to Indian rustics.  They do not understand why, when they\nhave paid for a magic piece of paper, strangers should punch great\npieces out of the charm.  So, long and furious are the debates between\ntravellers and Eurasian ticket-collectors.  Kim assisted at two or\nthree with grave advice, meant to darken counsel and to show off his\nwisdom before the lama and the admiring Kamboh.  But at Somna Road the\nFates sent him a matter to think upon.  There tumbled into the\ncompartment, as the train was moving off, a mean, lean little person--a\nMahratta, so far as Kim could judge by the cock of the tight turban.\nHis face was cut, his muslin upper-garment was badly torn, and one leg\nwas bandaged.  He told them that a country-cart had upset and nearly\nslain him:  he was going to Delhi, where his son lived.  Kim watched\nhim closely. If, as he asserted, he had been rolled over and over on\nthe earth, there should have been signs of gravel-rash on the skin.\nBut all his injuries seemed clean cuts, and a mere fall from a cart\ncould not cast a man into such extremity of terror.  As, with shaking\nfingers, he knotted up the torn cloth about his neck he laid bare an\namulet of the kind called a keeper-up of the heart.  Now, amulets are\ncommon enough, but they are not generally strung on square-plaited\ncopper wire, and still fewer amulets bear black enamel on silver.\nThere were none except the Kamboh and the lama in the compartment,\nwhich, luckily, was of an old type with solid ends.  Kim made as to\nscratch in his bosom, and thereby lifted his own amulet.  The\nMahratta's face changed altogether at the sight, and he disposed the\namulet fairly on his breast.\n\n'Yes,' he went on to the Kamboh, 'I was in haste, and the cart, driven\nby a bastard, bound its wheel in a water-cut, and besides the harm done\nto me there was lost a full dish of tarkeean.  I was not a Son of the\nCharm [a lucky man] that day.'\n\n'That was a great loss,' said the Kamboh, withdrawing interest.  His\nexperience of Benares had made him suspicious.\n\n'Who cooked it?'  said Kim.\n\n'A woman.'  The Mahratta raised his eyes.\n\n'But all women can cook tarkeean,' said the Kamboh.  'It is a good\ncurry, as I know.'\n\n'Oh yes, it is a good curry,' said the Mahratta.\n\n'And cheap,' said Kim.  'But what about caste?'\n\n'Oh, there is no caste where men go to--look for tarkeean,' the\nMahratta replied, in the prescribed cadence.  'Of whose service art\nthou?'\n\n'Of the service of this Holy One.'  Kim pointed to the happy, drowsy\nlama, who woke with a jerk at the well-loved word.\n\n'Ah, he was sent from Heaven to aid me.  He is called the Friend of all\nthe World.  He is also called the Friend of the Stars.  He walks as a\nphysician--his time being ripe.  Great is his wisdom.'\n\n'And a Son of the Charm,' said Kim under his breath, as the Kamboh made\nhaste to prepare a pipe lest the Mahratta should beg.\n\n'And who is that?'  the Mahratta asked, glancing sideways nervously.\n\n'One whose child I--we have cured, who lies under great debt to us. Sit\nby the window, man from Jullundur.  Here is a sick one.'\n\n'Humph!  I have no desire to mix with chance-met wastrels.  My ears are\nnot long.  I am not a woman wishing to overhear secrets.'  The Jat slid\nhimself heavily into a far corner.\n\n'Art thou anything of a healer?  I am ten leagues deep in calamity,'\ncried the Mahratta, picking up the cue.\n\n'This man is cut and bruised all over.  I go about to cure him,' Kim\nretorted.  'None interfered between thy babe and me.'\n\n'I am rebuked,' said the Kamboh meekly.  'I am thy debtor for the life\nof my son.  Thou art a miracle-worker--I know it.'\n\n'Show me the cuts.'  Kim bent over the Mahratta's neck, his heart\nnearly choking him; for this was the Great Game with a vengeance. 'Now,\ntell thy tale swiftly, brother, while I say a charm.'\n\n'I come from the South, where my work lay.  One of us they slew by the\nroadside.  Hast thou heard?'  Kim shook his head.  He, of course, knew\nnothing of E's predecessor, slain down South in the habit of an Arab\ntrader.  'Having found a certain letter which I was sent to seek, I\ncame away.  I escaped from the city and ran to Mhow.  So sure was I\nthat none knew, I did not change my face.  At Mhow a woman brought\ncharge against me of theft of jewellery in that city which I had left.\nThen I saw the cry was out against me.  I ran from Mhow by night,\nbribing the police, who had been bribed to hand me over without\nquestion to my enemies in the South.  Then I lay in old Chitor city a\nweek, a penitent in a temple, but I could not get rid of the letter\nwhich was my charge.  I buried it under the Queen's Stone, at Chitor,\nin the place known to us all.'\n\nKim did not know, but not for worlds would he have broken the thread.\n\n'At Chitor, look you, I was all in Kings' country; for Kotah to the\neast is beyond the Queen's law, and east again lie Jaipur and Gwalior.\nNeither love spies, and there is no justice.  I was hunted like a wet\njackal; but I broke through at Bandakui, where I heard there was a\ncharge against me of murder in the city I had left--of the murder of a\nboy.  They have both the corpse and the witnesses waiting.'\n\n'But cannot the Government protect?'\n\n'We of the Game are beyond protection.  If we die, we die.  Our names\nare blotted from the book.  That is all.  At Bandakui, where lives one\nof Us, I thought to slip the scent by changing my face, and so made me\na Mahratta.  Then I came to Agra, and would have turned back to Chitor\nto recover the letter.  So sure I was I had slipped them. Therefore I\ndid not send a tar [telegram] to any one saying where the letter lay.\nI wished the credit of it all.'\n\nKim nodded.  He understood that feeling well.\n\n'But at Agra, walking in the streets, a man cried a debt against me,\nand approaching with many witnesses, would hale me to the courts then\nand there.  Oh, they are clever in the South!  He recognized me as his\nagent for cotton.  May he burn in Hell for it!'\n\n'And wast thou?'\n\n'O fool!  I was the man they sought for the matter of the letter!  I\nran into the Fleshers' Ward and came out by the House of the Jew, who\nfeared a riot and pushed me forth.  I came afoot to Somna Road--I had\nonly money for my tikkut to Delhi--and there, while I lay in a ditch\nwith a fever, one sprang out of the bushes and beat me and cut me and\nsearched me from head to foot.  Within earshot of the terain it was!'\n\n'Why did he not slay thee out of hand?'\n\n'They are not so foolish.  If I am taken in Delhi at the instance of\nlawyers, upon a proven charge of murder, my body is handed over to the\nState that desires it.  I go back guarded, and then--I die slowly for\nan example to the rest of Us.  The South is not my country.  I run in\ncircles--like a goat with one eye.  I have not eaten for two days.  I\nam marked'--he touched the filthy bandage on his leg--'so that they\nwill know me at Delhi.'\n\n'Thou art safe in the te-rain, at least.'\n\n'Live a year at the Great Game and tell me that again!  The wires will\nbe out against me at Delhi, describing every tear and rag upon me.\nTwenty--a hundred, if need be--will have seen me slay that boy.  And\nthou art useless!'\n\nKim knew enough of native methods of attack not to doubt that the case\nwould be deadly complete--even to the corpse.  The Mahratta twitched\nhis fingers with pain from time to time.  The Kamboh in his corner\nglared sullenly; the lama was busy over his beads; and Kim, fumbling\ndoctor-fashion at the man's neck, thought out his plan between\ninvocations.\n\n'Hast thou a charm to change my shape?  Else I am dead.  Five--ten\nminutes alone, if I had not been so pressed, and I might--'\n\n'Is he cured yet, miracle-worker?'  said the Kamboh jealously.  'Thou\nhast chanted long enough.'\n\n'Nay.  There is no cure for his hurts, as I see, except he sit for\nthree days in the habit of a bairagi.'  This is a common penance, often\nimposed on a fat trader by his spiritual teacher.\n\n'One priest always goes about to make another priest,' was the retort.\nLike most grossly superstitious folk, the Kamboh could not keep his\ntongue from deriding his Church.\n\n'Will thy son be a priest, then?  It is time he took more of my\nquinine.'\n\n'We Jats are all buffaloes,' said the Kamboh, softening anew.\n\nKim rubbed a finger-tip of bitterness on the child's trusting little\nlips.  'I have asked for nothing,' he said sternly to the father,\n'except food.  Dost thou grudge me that?  I go to heal another man.\nHave I thy leave--Prince?'\n\nUp flew the man's huge paws in supplication.  'Nay--nay.  Do not mock\nme thus.'\n\n'It pleases me to cure this sick one.  Thou shalt acquire merit by\naiding.  What colour ash is there in thy pipe-bowl?  White.  That is\nauspicious.  Was there raw turmeric among thy foodstuffs?'\n\n'I--I--'\n\n'Open thy bundle!'\n\nIt was the usual collection of small oddments:  bits of cloth, quack\nmedicines, cheap fairings, a clothful of atta--greyish, rough-ground\nnative flour--twists of down-country tobacco, tawdry pipe-stems, and a\npacket of curry-stuff, all wrapped in a quilt.  Kim turned it over with\nthe air of a wise warlock, muttering a Mohammedan invocation.\n\n'This is wisdom I learned from the Sahibs,' he whispered to the lama;\nand here, when one thinks of his training at Lurgan's, he spoke no more\nthan the truth.  'There is a great evil in this man's fortune, as shown\nby the Stars, which--which troubles him.  Shall I take it away?'\n\n'Friend of the Stars, thou hast done well in all things.  Let it be at\nthy pleasure.  Is it another healing?'\n\n'Quick!  Be quick!'  gasped the Mahratta.  'The train may stop.'\n\n'A healing against the shadow of death,' said Kim, mixing the Kamboh's\nflour with the mingled charcoal and tobacco ash in the red-earth bowl\nof the pipe.  E, without a word, slipped off his turban and shook down\nhis long black hair.\n\n\n'That is my food--priest,' the jat growled.\n\n'A buffalo in the temple!  Hast thou dared to look even thus far?' said\nKim.  'I must do mysteries before fools; but have a care for thine\neyes.  Is there a film before them already?  I save the babe, and for\nreturn thou--oh, shameless!'  The man flinched at the direct gaze, for\nKim was wholly in earnest.\n\n'Shall I curse thee, or shall I--' He picked up the outer cloth of the\nbundle and threw it over the bowed head.  'Dare so much as to think a\nwish to see, and--and--even I cannot save thee.  Sit!  Be dumb!'\n\n'I am blind--dumb.  Forbear to curse!  Co--come, child; we will play a\ngame of hiding.  Do not, for my sake, look from under the cloth.'\n\n'I see hope,' said E23.  'What is thy scheme?'\n\n'This comes next,' said Kim, plucking the thin body-shirt.  E23\nhesitated, with all a North-West man's dislike of baring his body.\n\n'What is caste to a cut throat?'  said Kim, rending it to the waist.\n'We must make thee a yellow Saddhu all over.  Strip--strip swiftly, and\nshake thy hair over thine eyes while I scatter the ash. Now, a\ncaste-mark on thy forehead.'  He drew from his bosom the little Survey\npaint-box and a cake of crimson lake.\n\n'Art thou only a beginner?'  said E23, labouring literally for the dear\nlife, as he slid out of his body-wrappings and stood clear in the\nloin-cloth while Kim splashed in a noble caste-mark on the ash-smeared\nbrow.\n\n'But two days entered to the Game, brother,' Kim replied.  'Smear more\nash on the bosom.'\n\n'Hast thou met--a physician of sick pearls?'  He switched out his long,\ntight-rolled turban-cloth and, with swiftest hands, rolled it over and\nunder about his loins into the intricate devices of a Saddhu's cincture.\n\n'Hah!  Dost thou know his touch, then?  He was my teacher for a while.\nWe must bar thy legs.  Ash cures wounds.  Smear it again.'\n\n'I was his pride once, but thou art almost better.  The Gods are kind\nto us!  Give me that.'\n\nIt was a tin box of opium pills among the rubbish of the Jat's bundle.\nE23 gulped down a half handful.  'They are good against hunger, fear,\nand chill.  And they make the eyes red too,' he explained.  'Now I\nshall have heart to play the Game.  We lack only a Saddhu's tongs.\nWhat of the old clothes?'\n\nKim rolled them small, and stuffed them into the slack folds of his\ntunic.  With a yellow-ochre paint cake he smeared the legs and the\nbreast, great streaks against the background of flour, ash, and\nturmeric.\n\n'The blood on them is enough to hang thee, brother.'\n\n'Maybe; but no need to throw them out of the window ...  It is\nfinished.'  His voice thrilled with a boy's pure delight in the Game.\n'Turn and look, O Jat!'\n\n'The Gods protect us,' said the hooded Kamboh, emerging like a buffalo\nfrom the reeds.  'But--whither went the Mahratta?  What hast thou done?'\n\nKim had been trained by Lurgan Sahib; E23, by virtue of his business,\nwas no bad actor.  In place of the tremulous, shrinking trader there\nlolled against the corner an all but naked, ash-smeared, ochre-barred,\ndusty-haired Saddhu, his swollen eyes--opium takes quick effect on an\nempty stomach--luminous with insolence and bestial lust, his legs\ncrossed under him, Kim's brown rosary round his neck, and a scant yard\nof worn, flowered chintz on his shoulders.  The child buried his face\nin his amazed father's arms.\n\n'Look up, Princeling!  We travel with warlocks, but they will not hurt\nthee.  Oh, do not cry ...  What is the sense of curing a child one day\nand killing him with fright the next?'\n\n'The child will be fortunate all his life.  He has seen a great\nhealing.  When I was a child I made clay men and horses.'\n\n'I have made them too.  Sir Banas, he comes in the night and makes them\nall alive at the back of our kitchen-midden,' piped the child.\n\n'And so thou art not frightened at anything.  Eh, Prince?'\n\n'I was frightened because my father was frightened.  I felt his arms\nshake.'\n\n'Oh, chicken-man!'  said Kim, and even the abashed Jat laughed.  'I\nhave done a healing on this poor trader.  He must forsake his gains and\nhis account-books, and sit by the wayside three nights to overcome the\nmalignity of his enemies.  The Stars are against him.'\n\n'The fewer money-lenders the better, say I; but, Saddhu or no Saddhu,\nhe should pay for my stuff on his shoulders.'\n\n'So?  But that is thy child on thy shoulder--given over to the\nburning-ghat not two days ago.  There remains one thing more.  I did\nthis charm in thy presence because need was great.  I changed his shape\nand his soul.  None the less, if, by any chance, O man from Jullundur,\nthou rememberest what thou hast seen, either among the elders sitting\nunder the village tree, or in thine own house, or in company of thy\npriest when he blesses thy cattle, a murrain will come among the\nbuffaloes, and a fire in thy thatch, and rats in the corn-bins, and the\ncurse of our Gods upon thy fields that they may be barren before thy\nfeet and after thy ploughshare.' This was part of an old curse picked\nup from a fakir by the Taksali Gate in the days of Kim's innocence.  It\nlost nothing by repetition.\n\n'Cease, Holy One!  In mercy, cease!'  cried the Jat.  'Do not curse the\nhousehold.  I saw nothing!  I heard nothing!  I am thy cow!'  and he\nmade to grab at Kim's bare foot beating rhythmically on the carriage\nfloor.  'But since thou hast been permitted to aid me in the matter of\na pinch of flour and a little opium and such trifles as I have honoured\nby using in my art, so will the Gods return a blessing,' and he gave it\nat length, to the man's immense relief.  It was one that he had learned\nfrom Lurgan Sahib.\n\nThe lama stared through his spectacles as he had not stared at the\nbusiness of disguisement.  'Friend of the Stars,' he said at last,\n'thou hast acquired great wisdom.  Beware that it do not give birth to\npride.  No man having the Law before his eyes speaks hastily of any\nmatter which he has seen or encountered.'\n\n'No--no--no, indeed,' cried the farmer, fearful lest the master should\nbe minded to improve on the pupil.  E23, with relaxed mouth, gave\nhimself up to the opium that is meat, tobacco, and medicine to the\nspent Asiatic.\n\nSo, in a silence of awe and great miscomprehension, they slid into\nDelhi about lamp-lighting time.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 12\n\n\n  Who hath desired the Sea--the sight of salt-water unbounded?\n  The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber\n      wind-hounded?\n  The sleek-barrelled swell before storm--grey, foamless, enormous,\n      and growing?\n  Stark calm on the lap of the Line--or the crazy-eyed hurricane\n      blowing?\n  His Sea in no showing the same--his Sea and the same 'neath all\n      showing--\n  His Sea that his being fulfils?\n  So and no otherwise--so and no otherwise hill-men desire their Hills!\n\n  The Sea and the Hills.\n\n\n'I have found my heart again,' said E23, under cover of the platform's\ntumult.  'Hunger and fear make men dazed, or I might have thought of\nthis escape before.  I was right.  They come to hunt for me.  Thou hast\nsaved my head.'\n\nA group of yellow-trousered Punjab policemen, headed by a hot and\nperspiring young Englishman, parted the crowd about the carriages.\nBehind them, inconspicuous as a cat, ambled a small fat person who\nlooked like a lawyer's tout.\n\n'See the young Sahib reading from a paper.  My description is in his\nhand,' said E23.  'Thev go carriage by carriage, like fisher-folk\nnetting a pool.'\n\nWhen the procession reached their compartment, E23 was counting his\nbeads with a steady jerk of the wrist; while Kim jeered at him for\nbeing so drugged as to have lost the ringed fire-tongs which are the\nSaddhu's distinguishing mark.  The lama, deep in meditation, stared\nstraight before him; and the farmer, glancing furtively, gathered up\nhis belongings.\n\n'Nothing here but a parcel of holy-bolies,' said the Englishman aloud,\nand passed on amid a ripple of uneasiness; for native police mean\nextortion to the native all India over.\n\n'The trouble now,' whispered E23, 'lies in sending a wire as to the\nplace where I hid that letter I was sent to find.  I cannot go to the\ntar-office in this guise.'\n\n'Is it not enough I have saved thy neck?'\n\n'Not if the work be left unfinished.  Did never the healer of sick\npearls tell thee so?  Comes another Sahib!  Ah!'\n\nThis was a tallish, sallowish District Superintendent of Police--belt,\nhelmet, polished spurs and all--strutting and twirling his dark\nmoustache.\n\n'What fools are these Police Sahibs!'  said Kim genially.\n\nE23 glanced up under his eyelids.  'It is well said,' he muttered in a\nchanged voice.  'I go to drink water.  Keep my place.'\n\nHe blundered out almost into the Englishman's arms, and was bad-worded\nin clumsy Urdu.\n\n'Tum mut?  You drunk?  You mustn't bang about as though Delhi station\nbelonged to you, my friend.'\n\nE23, not moving a muscle of his countenance, answered with a stream of\nthe filthiest abuse, at which Kim naturally rejoiced.  It reminded him\nof the drummer-boys and the barrack-sweepers at Umballa in the terrible\ntime of his first schooling.\n\n'My good fool,' the Englishman drawled.  'Nickle-jao!  Go back to your\ncarriage.'\n\nStep by step, withdrawing deferentially and dropping his voice, the\nyellow Saddhu clomb back to the carriage, cursing the D.S.P. to\nremotest posterity, by--here Kim almost jumped--by the curse of the\nQueen's Stone, by the writing under the Queen's Stone, and by an\nassortment of Gods with wholly, new names.\n\n'I don't know what you're saying,'--the Englishman flushed\nangrily--'but it's some piece of blasted impertinence.  Come out of\nthat!'\n\nE23, affecting to misunderstand, gravely produced his ticket, which the\nEnglishman wrenched angrily from his hand.\n\n'Oh, zoolum!  What oppression!'  growled the Jat from his corner. 'All\nfor the sake of a jest too.'  He had been grinning at the freedom of\nthe Saddhu's tongue.  'Thy charms do not work well today, Holy One!'\n\nThe Saddhu followed the policeman, fawning and supplicating.  The ruck\nof passengers, busy, with their babies and their bundles, had not\nnoticed the affair.  Kim slipped out behind him; for it flashed through\nhis head that he had heard this angry, stupid Sahib discoursing loud\npersonalities to an old lady near Umballa three years ago.\n\n'It is well', the Saddhu whispered, jammed in the calling, shouting,\nbewildered press--a Persian greyhound between his feet and a cageful of\nyelling hawks under charge of a Rajput falconer in the small of his\nback.  'He has gone now to send word of the letter which I hid.  They\ntold me he was in Peshawur.  I might have known that he is like the\ncrocodile--always at the other ford.  He has saved me from present\ncalamity, but I owe my life to thee.'\n\n'Is he also one of Us?'  Kim ducked under a Mewar camel-driver's greasy\narmpit and cannoned off a covey of jabbering Sikh matrons.\n\n'Not less than the greatest.  We are both fortunate!  I will make\nreport to him of what thou hast done.  I am safe under his protection.'\n\nHe bored through the edge of the crowd besieging the carriages, and\nsquatted by the bench near the telegraph-office.\n\n'Return, or they take thy place!  Have no fear for the work,\nbrother--or my life.  Thou hast given me breathing-space, and\nStrickland Sahib has pulled me to land.  We may work together at the\nGame yet. Farewell!'\n\nKim hurried to his carriage:  elated, bewildered, but a little nettled\nin that he had no key to the secrets about him.\n\n'I am only a beginner at the Game, that is sure.  I could not have\nleaped into safety as did the Saddhu.  He knew it was darkest under the\nlamp.  I could not have thought to tell news under pretence of cursing\n...  and how clever was the Sahib!  No matter, I saved the life of one\n...  Where is the Kamboh gone, Holy One?'  he whispered, as he took his\nseat in the now crowded compartment.\n\n'A fear gripped him,' the lama replied, with a touch of tender malice.\n'He saw thee change the Mahratta to a Saddhu in the twinkling of an\neye, as a protection against evil.  That shook him. Then he saw the\nSaddhu fall sheer into the hands of the polis--all the effect of thy\nart.  Then he gathered up his son and fled; for he said that thou didst\nchange a quiet trader into an impudent bandier of words with the\nSahibs, and he feared a like fate.  Where is the Saddhu?'\n\n'With the polis,' said Kim ...  'Yet I saved the Kamboh's child.'\n\nThe lama snuffed blandly.\n\n'Ah, chela, see how thou art overtaken!  Thou didst cure the Kamboh's\nchild solely to acquire merit.  But thou didst put a spell on the\nMahratta with prideful workings--I watched thee--and with sidelong\nglances to bewilder an old old man and a foolish farmer: whence\ncalamity and suspicion.'\n\nKim controlled himself with an effort beyond his years.  Not more than\nany other youngster did he like to eat dirt or to be misjudged, but he\nsaw himself in a cleft stick.  The train rolled out of Delhi into the\nnight.\n\n'It is true,' he murmured.  'Where I have offended thee I have done\nwrong.'\n\n'It is more, chela.  Thou hast loosed an Act upon the world, and as a\nstone thrown into a pool so spread the consequences thou canst not tell\nhow far.'\n\nThis ignorance was well both for Kim's vanity and for the lama's peace\nof mind, when we think that there was then being handed in at Simla a\ncode-wire reporting the arrival of E23 at Delhi, and, more important,\nthe whereabouts of a letter he had been commissioned to--abstract.\nIncidentally, an over-zealous policeman had arrested, on charge of\nmurder done in a far southern State, a horribly indignant Ajmir\ncotton-broker, who was explaining himself to a Mr Strickland on Delhi\nplatform, while E23 was paddling through byways into the locked heart\nof Delhi city.  In two hours several telegrams had reached the angry\nminister of a southern State reporting that all trace of a somewhat\nbruised Mahratta had been lost; and by the time the leisurely train\nhalted at Saharunpore the last ripple of the stone Kim had helped to\nheave was lapping against the steps of a mosque in far-away Roum--where\nit disturbed a pious man at prayers.\n\nThe lama made his in ample form near the dewy bougainvillea-trellis\nnear the platform, cheered by the clear sunshine and the presence of\nhis disciple.  'We will put these things behind us,' he said,\nindicating the brazen engine and the gleaming track.  'The jolting of\nthe te-rain--though a wonderful thing--has turned my bones to water.\nWe will use clean air henceforward.'\n\n'Let us go to the Kulu woman's house' said Kim, and stepped forth\ncheerily under the bundles.  Early morning Saharunpore-way is clean and\nwell scented.  He thought of the other mornings at St Xavier's, and it\ntopped his already thrice-heaped contentment.\n\n'Where is this new haste born from?  Wise men do not run about like\nchickens in the sun.  We have come hundreds upon hundreds of koss\nalready, and, till now, I have scarcely been alone with thee an\ninstant.  How canst thou receive instruction all jostled of crowds? How\ncan I, whelmed by a flux of talk, meditate upon the Way?'\n\n'Her tongue grows no shorter with the years, then?'  the disciple\nsmiled.\n\n'Nor her desire for charms.  I remember once when I spoke of the Wheel\nof Life'--the lama fumbled in his bosom for his latest copy--'she was\nonly curious about the devils that besiege children.  She shall acquire\nmerit by entertaining us--in a little while--at an\nafter-occasion--softly, softly.  Now we will wander loose-foot, waiting\nupon the Chain of Things.  The Search is sure.'\n\nSo they travelled very easily across and among the broad bloomful\nfruit-gardens--by way of Aminabad, Sahaigunge, Akrola of the Ford, and\nlittle Phulesa--the line of the Siwaliks always to the north, and\nbehind them again the snows.  After long, sweet sleep under the dry\nstars came the lordly, leisurely passage through a waking\nvillage--begging-bowl held forth in silence, but eyes roving in\ndefiance of the Law from sky's edge to sky's edge.  Then would Kim\nreturn soft-footed through the soft dust to his master under the shadow\nof a mango-tree or the thinner shade of a white Doon siris, to eat and\ndrink at ease.  At mid-day, after talk and a little wayfaring, they\nslept; meeting the world refreshed when the air was cooler.  Night\nfound them adventuring into new territory--some chosen village spied\nthree hours before across the fat land, and much discussed upon the\nroad.\n\nThere they told their tale--a new one each evening so far as Kim was\nconcerned--and there were they made welcome, either by priest or\nheadman, after the custom of the kindly East.\n\nWhen the shadows shortened and the lama leaned more heavily upon Kim,\nthere was always the Wheel of Life to draw forth, to hold flat under\nwiped stones, and with a long straw to expound cycle by cycle. Here sat\nthe Gods on high--and they were dreams of dreams.  Here was our Heaven\nand the world of the demi-Gods--horsemen fighting among the hills.\nHere were the agonies done upon the beasts, souls ascending or\ndescending the ladder and therefore not to be interfered with.  Here\nwere the Hells, hot and cold, and the abodes of tormented ghosts.  Let\nthe chela study the troubles that come from over-eating--bloated\nstomach and burning bowels.  Obediently, then, with bowed head and\nbrown finger alert to follow the pointer, did the chela study; but when\nthey came to the Human World, busy and profitless, that is just above\nthe Hells, his mind was distracted; for by the roadside trundled the\nvery Wheel itself, eating, drinking, trading, marrying, and\nquarrelling--all warmly alive. Often the lama made the living pictures\nthe matter of his text, bidding Kim--too ready--note how the flesh\ntakes a thousand shapes, desirable or detestable as men reckon, but in\ntruth of no account either way; and how the stupid spirit, bond-slave\nto the Hog, the Dove, and the Serpent--lusting after betel-nut, a new\nyoke of oxen, women, or the favour of kings--is bound to follow the\nbody through all the Heavens and all the Hells, and strictly round\nagain. Sometimes a woman or a poor man, watching the ritual--it was\nnothing less--when the great yellow chart was unfolded, would throw a\nfew flowers or a handful of cowries upon its edge.  It sufficed these\nhumble ones that they had met a Holy One who might be moved to remember\nthem in his prayers.\n\n'Cure them if they are sick,' said the lama, when Kim's sporting\ninstincts woke.  'Cure them if they have fever, but by no means work\ncharms.  Remember what befell the Mahratta.'\n\n'Then all Doing is evil?'  Kim replied, lying out under a big tree at\nthe fork of the Doon road, watching the little ants run over his hand.\n\n'To abstain from action is well--except to acquire merit.'\n\n'At the Gates of Learning we were taught that to abstain from action\nwas unbefitting a Sahib.  And I am a Sahib.'\n\n'Friend of all the World,'--the lama looked directly at Kim--'I am an\nold man--pleased with shows as are children.  To those who follow the\nWay there is neither black nor white, Hind nor Bhotiyal. We be all\nsouls seeking escape.  No matter what thy wisdom learned among Sahibs,\nwhen we come to my River thou wilt be freed from all illusion--at my\nside.  Hai!  My bones ache for that River, as they ached in the\nte-rain; but my spirit sits above my bones, waiting. The Search is\nsure!'\n\n'I am answered.  Is it permitted to ask a question?'\n\nThe lama inclined his stately head.\n\n'I ate thy bread for three years--as thou knowest.  Holy One, whence\ncame--?'\n\n'There is much wealth, as men count it, in Bhotiyal,' the lama returned\nwith composure.  'In my own place I have the illusion of honour.  I ask\nfor that I need.  I am not concerned with the account. That is for my\nmonastery.  Ai!  The black high seats in the monastery, and novices all\nin order!'\n\nAnd he told stories, tracing with a finger in the dust, of the immense\nand sumptuous ritual of avalanche-guarded cathedrals; of processions\nand devil-dances; of the changing of monks and nuns into swine; of holy\ncities fifteen thousand feet in the air; of intrigue between monastery\nand monastery; of voices among the hills, and of that mysterious mirage\nthat dances on dry snow.  He spoke even of Lhassa and of the Dalai\nLama, whom he had seen and adored.\n\nEach long, perfect day rose behind Kim for a barrier to cut him off\nfrom his race and his mother-tongue.  He slipped back to thinking and\ndreaming in the vernacular, and mechanically followed the lama's\nceremonial observances at eating, drinking, and the like.  The old\nman's mind turned more and more to his monastery as his eyes turned to\nthe steadfast snows.  His River troubled him nothing.  Now and again,\nindeed, he would gaze long and long at a tuft or a twig, expecting, he\nsaid, the earth to cleave and deliver its blessing; but he was content\nto be with his disciple, at ease in the temperate wind that comes down\nfrom the Doon.  This was not Ceylon, nor Buddh Gaya, nor Bombay, nor\nsome grass-tangled ruins that he seemed to have stumbled upon two years\nago.  He spoke of those places as a scholar removed from vanity, as a\nSeeker walking in humility, as an old man, wise and temperate,\nillumining knowledge with brilliant insight.  Bit by bit,\ndisconnectedly, each tale called up by some wayside thing, he spoke of\nall his wanderings up and down Hind; till Kim, who had loved him\nwithout reason, now loved him for fifty good reasons.  So they enjoyed\nthemselves in high felicity, abstaining, as the Rule demands, from evil\nwords, covetous desires; not over-eating, not lying on high beds, nor\nwearing rich clothes.  Their stomachs told them the time, and the\npeople brought them their food, as the saying is.  They were lords of\nthe villages of Aminabad, Sahaigunge, Akrola of the Ford, and little\nPhulesa, where Kim gave the soulless woman a blessing.\n\nBut news travels fast in India, and too soon shuffled across the\ncrop-land, bearing a basket of fruits with a box of Kabul grapes and\ngilt oranges, a white-whiskered servitor--a lean, dry Oorya--begging\nthem to bring the honour of their presence to his mistress, distressed\nin her mind that the lama had neglected her so long.\n\n'Now do I remember'--the lama spoke as though it were a wholly new\nproposition.  'She is virtuous, but an inordinate talker.'\n\nKim was sitting on the edge of a cow's manger, telling stories to a\nvillage smith's children.\n\n'She will only ask for another son for her daughter.  I have not\nforgotten her,' he said.  'Let her acquire merit.  Send word that we\nwill come.'\n\nThey covered eleven miles through the fields in two days, and were\noverwhelmed with attentions at the end; for the old lady held a fine\ntradition of hospitality, to which she forced her son-in-law, who was\nunder the thumb of his women-folk and bought peace by borrowing of the\nmoney-lender.  Age had not weakened her tongue or her memory, and from\na discreetly barred upper window, in the hearing of not less than a\ndozen servants, she paid Kim compliments that would have flung European\naudiences into unclean dismay.\n\n'But thou art still the shameless beggar-brat of the parao,' she\nshrilled.  'I have not forgotten thee.  Wash ye and eat.  The father of\nmy daughter's son is gone away awhile.  So we poor women are dumb and\nuseless.'\n\nFor proof, she harangued the entire household unsparingly till food and\ndrink were brought; and in the evening--the smoke-scented evening,\ncopper-dun and turquoise across the fields--it pleased her to order her\npalanquin to be set down in the untidy forecourt by smoky torchlight;\nand there, behind not too closely drawn curtains, she gossiped.\n\n'Had the Holy One come alone, I should have received him otherwise; but\nwith this rogue, who can be too careful?'\n\n'Maharanee,' said Kim, choosing as always the amplest title, 'is it my\nfault that none other than a Sahib--a polis-Sahib--called the Maharanee\nwhose face he--' 'Chutt!  That was on the pilgrimage. When we\ntravel--thou knowest the proverb.'\n\n'Called the Maharanee a Breaker of Hearts and a Dispenser of Delights?'\n\n'To remember that!  It was true.  So he did.  That was in the time of\nthe bloom of my beauty.'  She chuckled like a contented parrot above\nthe sugar lump.  'Now tell me of thy goings and comings--as much as may\nbe without shame.  How many maids, and whose wives, hang upon thine\neyelashes?  Ye hail from Benares?  I would have gone there again this\nyear, but my daughter--we have only two sons.  Phaii!  Such is the\neffect of these low plains.  Now in Kulu men are elephants.  But I\nwould ask thy Holy One--stand aside, rogue--a charm against most\nlamentable windy colics that in mango-time overtake my daughter's\neldest.  Two years back he gave me a powerful spell.'\n\n'Oh, Holy One!'  said Kim, bubbling with mirth at the lama's rueful\nface.\n\n'It is true.  I gave her one against wind.'\n\n'Teeth--teeth--teeth,' snapped the old woman.\n\n\"'Cure them if they are sick,\"' Kim quoted relishingly, \"'but by no\nmeans work charms.  Remember what befell the Mahratta.\"'\n\n'That was two Rains ago; she wearied me with her continual\nimportunity.'  The lama groaned as the Unjust Judge had groaned before\nhim.  'Thus it comes--take note, my chela--that even those who would\nfollow the Way are thrust aside by idle women.  Three days through,\nwhen the child was sick, she talked to me.'\n\n'Arre!  and to whom else should I talk?  The boy's mother knew nothing,\nand the father--in the nights of the cold weather it was--\"Pray to the\nGods,\" said he, forsooth, and turning over, snored!'\n\n'I gave her the charm.  What is an old man to do?'\n\n\"'To abstain from action is well--except to acquire merit.\"'\n\n'Ah chela, if thou desertest me, I am all alone.'\n\n'He found his milk-teeth easily at any rate,' said the old lady. 'But\nall priests are alike.'\n\nKim coughed severely.  Being young, he did not approve of her\nflippancy.  'To importune the wise out of season is to invite calamity.'\n\n'There is a talking mynah'--the thrust came back with the\nwell-remembered snap of the jewelled fore-finger--'over the stables\nwhich has picked up the very tone of the family priest.  Maybe I forget\nhonour to my guests, but if ye had seen him double his fists into his\nbelly, which was like a half-grown gourd, and cry:  \"Here is the pain!\"\nye would forgive.  I am half minded to take the hakim's medicine.  He\nsells it cheap, and certainly it makes him fat as Shiv's own bull.  He\ndoes not deny remedies, but I doubted for the child because of the\nin-auspicious colour of the bottles.'\n\nThe lama, under cover of the monologue, had faded out into the darkness\ntowards the room prepared.\n\n'Thou hast angered him, belike,' said Kim.\n\n'Not he.  He is wearied, and I forgot, being a grandmother.  (None but\na grandmother should ever oversee a child.  Mothers are only fit for\nbearing.) Tomorrow, when he sees how my daughter's son is grown, he\nwill write the charm.  Then, too, he can judge of the new hakim's\ndrugs.'\n\n'Who is the hakim, Maharanee?'\n\n'A wanderer, as thou art, but a most sober Bengali from Dacca--a master\nof medicine.  He relieved me of an oppression after meat by means of a\nsmall pill that wrought like a devil unchained.  He travels about now,\nvending preparations of great value.  He has even papers, printed in\nAngrezi, telling what things he has done for weak-backed men and slack\nwomen.  He has been here four days; but hearing ye were coming (hakims\nand priests are snake and tiger the world over) he has, as I take it,\ngone to cover.'\n\nWhile she drew breath after this volley, the ancient servant, sitting\nunrebuked on the edge of the torchlight, muttered:  'This house is a\ncattle-pound, as it were, for all charlatans and--priests. Let the boy\nstop eating mangoes ...  but who can argue with a grandmother?'  He\nraised his voice respectfully:  'Sahiba, the hakim sleeps after his\nmeat.  He is in the quarters behind the dovecote.'\n\nKim bristled like an expectant terrier.  To outface and down-talk a\nCalcutta-taught Bengali, a voluble Dacca drug-vendor, would be a good\ngame.  It was not seemly that the lama, and incidentally himself,\nshould be thrown aside for such an one.  He knew those curious bastard\nEnglish advertisements at the backs of native newspapers.  St Xavier's\nboys sometimes brought them in by stealth to snigger over among their\nmates; for the language of the grateful patient recounting his symptoms\nis most simple and revealing.  The Oorya, not unanxious to play off one\nparasite against the other, slunk away towards the dovecote.\n\n'Yes,' said Kim, with measured scorn.  'Their stock-in-trade is a\nlittle coloured water and a very great shamelessness.  Their prey are\nbroken-down kings and overfed Bengalis.  Their profit is in\nchildren--who are not born.'  The old lady chuckled.  'Do not be\nenvious. Charms are better, eh?  I never gainsaid it.  See that thy\nHoly One writes me a good amulet by the morning.'\n\n'None but the ignorant deny'--a thick, heavy voice boomed through the\ndarkness, as a figure came to rest squatting--'None but the ignorant\ndeny the value of charms.  None but the ignorant deny the value of\nmedicines.'\n\n'A rat found a piece of turmeric.  Said he:  \"I will open a grocer's\nshop,\"' Kim retorted.\n\nBattle was fairly joined now, and they heard the old lady stiffen to\nattention.\n\n'The priest's son knows the names of his nurse and three Gods.  Says\nhe:  \"Hear me, or I will curse you by the three million Great Ones.\"'\nDecidedly this invisible had an arrow or two in his quiver.  He went\non:  'I am but a teacher of the alphabet.  I have learned all the\nwisdom of the Sahibs.'\n\n'The Sahibs never grow old.  They dance and they play like children\nwhen they are grandfathers.  A strong-backed breed,' piped the voice\ninside the palanquin.\n\n'I have, too, our drugs which loosen humours of the head in hot and\nangry men.  Sina well compounded when the moon stands in the proper\nHouse; yellow earths I have--arplan from China that makes a man renew\nhis youth and astonish his household; saffron from Kashmir, and the\nbest salep of Kabul.  Many people have died before--'\n\n'That I surely believe,' said Kim.\n\n'They knew the value of my drugs.  I do not give my sick the mere ink\nin which a charm is written, but hot and rending drugs which descend\nand wrestle with the evil.'\n\n'Very mightily they do so,' sighed the old lady.\n\nThe voice launched into an immense tale of misfortune and bankruptcy,\nstudded with plentiful petitions to the Government.  'But for my fate,\nwhich overrules all, I had been now in Government employ.  I bear a\ndegree from the great school at Calcutta--whither, maybe, the son of\nthis House shall go.'\n\n'He shall indeed.  If our neighbour's brat can in a few years be made\nan F A' (First Arts--she used the English word, of which she had heard\nso often), 'how much more shall children clever as some that I know\nbear away prizes at rich Calcutta.'\n\n'Never,' said the voice, 'have I seen such a child!  Born in an\nauspicious hour, and--but for that colic which, alas!  turning into\nblack cholers, may carry him off like a pigeon--destined to many years,\nhe is enviable.'\n\n'Hai mai!'  said the old lady.  'To praise children is inauspicious, or\nI could listen to this talk.  But the back of the house is unguarded,\nand even in this soft air men think themselves to be men, and women we\nknow ...  The child's father is away too, and I must be chowkedar\n[watchman] in my old age.  Up!  Up!  Take up the palanquin. Let the\nhakim and the young priest settle between them whether charms or\nmedicine most avail.  Ho!  worthless people, fetch tobacco for the\nguests, and--round the homestead go I!'\n\nThe palanquin reeled off, followed by straggling torches and a horde of\ndogs.  Twenty villages knew the Sahiba--her failings, her tongue, and\nher large charity.  Twenty villages cheated her after immemorial\ncustom, but no man would have stolen or robbed within her jurisdiction\nfor any gift under heaven.  None the less, she made great parade of her\nformal inspections, the riot of which could be heard half-way to\nMussoorie.\n\nKim relaxed, as one augur must when he meets another.  The hakim, still\nsquatting, slid over his hookah with a friendly foot, and Kim pulled at\nthe good weed.  The hangers-on expected grave professional debate, and\nperhaps a little free doctoring.\n\n'To discuss medicine before the ignorant is of one piece with teaching\nthe peacock to sing,' said the hakim.\n\n'True courtesy,' Kim echoed, 'is very often inattention.'\n\nThese, be it understood, were company-manners, designed to impress.\n\n'Hi!  I have an ulcer on my leg,' cried a scullion.  'Look at it!'\n\n'Get hence!  Remove!'  said the hakim.  'Is it the habit of the place\nto pester honoured guests?  Ye crowd in like buffaloes.'\n\n'If the Sahiba knew--' Kim began.\n\n'Ai!  Ai!  Come away.  They are meat for our mistress.  When her young\nShaitan's colics are cured perhaps we poor people may be suffered to--'\n\n'The mistress fed thy wife when thou wast in jail for breaking the\nmoney-lender's head.  Who speaks against her?'  The old servitor curled\nhis white moustaches savagely in the young moonlight.  'I am\nresponsible for the honour of this house.  Go!'  and he drove the\nunderlings before him.\n\nSaid the hakim, hardly more than shaping the words with his lips: 'How\ndo you do, Mister O'Hara?  I am jolly glad to see you again.'\n\nKim's hand clenched about the pipe-stem.  Anywhere on the open road,\nperhaps, he would not have been astonished; but here, in this quiet\nbackwater of life, he was not prepared for Hurree Babu.  It annoyed\nhim, too, that he had been hoodwinked.\n\n'Ah ha!  I told you at Lucknow--resurgam--I shall rise again and you\nshall not know me.  How much did you bet--eh?'\n\nHe chewed leisurely upon a few cardamom seeds, but he breathed uneasily.\n\n'But why come here, Babuji?'\n\n'Ah!  Thatt is the question, as Shakespeare hath it.  I come to\ncongratulate you on your extraordinary effeecient performance at Delhi.\nOah!  I tell you we are all proud of you.  It was verree neat and\nhandy.  Our mutual friend, he is old friend of mine.  He has been in\nsome dam'-tight places.  Now he will be in some more.  He told me; I\ntell Mr Lurgan; and he is pleased you graduate so nicely. All the\nDepartment is pleased.'\n\nFor the first time in his life, Kim thrilled to the clean pride (it can\nbe a deadly pitfall, none the less) of Departmental praise--ensnaring\npraise from an equal of work appreciated by fellow-workers.  Earth has\nnothing on the same plane to compare with it. But, cried the Oriental\nin him, Babus do not travel far to retail compliments.\n\n'Tell thy tale, Babu,' he said authoritatively.\n\n'Oah, it is nothing.  Onlee I was at Simla when the wire came in about\nwhat our mutual friend said he had hidden, and old Creighton--' He\nlooked to see how Kim would take this piece of audacity.\n\n'The Colonel Sahib,' the boy from St Xavier's corrected.  'Of course.\nHe found me at a loose string, and I had to go down to Chitor to find\nthat beastly letter.  I do not like the South--too much railway travel;\nbut I drew good travelling allowance.  Ha!  Ha!  I meet our mutual at\nDelhi on the way back.  He lies quiett just now, and says\nSaddhu-disguise suits him to the ground.  Well, there I hear what you\nhave done so well, so quickly, upon the instantaneous spur of the\nmoment.  I tell our mutual you take the bally bun, by Jove!  It was\nsplendid.  I come to tell you so.'\n\n'Umm!'\n\nThe frogs were busy in the ditches, and the moon slid to her setting.\nSome happy servant had gone out to commune with the night and to beat\nupon a drum.  Kim's next sentence was in the vernacular.\n\n'How didst thou follow us?'\n\n'Oah.  Thatt was nothing.  I know from our mutual friend you go to\nSaharunpore.  So I come on.  Red Lamas are not inconspicuous persons. I\nbuy myself my drug-box, and I am very good doctor really.  I go to\nAkrola of the Ford, and hear all about you, and I talk here and talk\nthere.  All the common people know what you do.  I knew when the\nhospitable old lady sent the dooli.  They have great recollections of\nthe old lama's visits here.  I know old ladies cannot keep their hands\nfrom medicines.  So I am a doctor, and--you hear my talk?  I think it\nis verree good.  My word, Mister O'Hara, they know about you and the\nlama for fifty miles--the common people.  So I come.  Do you mind?'\n\n'Babuji,' said Kim, looking up at the broad, grinning face, 'I am a\nSahib.'\n\n'My dear Mister O'Hara--'\n\n'And I hope to play the Great Game.'\n\n'You are subordinate to me departmentally at present.'\n\n'Then why talk like an ape in a tree?  Men do not come after one from\nSimla and change their dress, for the sake of a few sweet words.  I am\nnot a child.  Talk Hindi and let us get to the yolk of the egg. Thou\nart here--speaking not one word of truth in ten.  Why art thou here?\nGive a straight answer.'\n\n'That is so verree disconcerting of the Europeans, Mister O'Hara. You\nshould know a heap better at your time of life.'\n\n'But I want to know,' said Kim, laughing.  'If it is the Game, I may\nhelp.  How can I do anything if you bukh [babble] all round the shop?'\n\nHurree Babu reached for the pipe, and sucked it till it gurgled again.\n\n'Now I will speak vernacular.  You sit tight, Mister O'Hara ...  It\nconcerns the pedigree of a white stallion.'\n\n'Still?  That was finished long ago.'\n\n'When everyone is dead the Great Game is finished.  Not before. Listen\nto me till the end.  There were Five Kings who prepared a sudden war\nthree years ago, when thou wast given the stallion's pedigree by Mahbub\nAli.  Upon them, because of that news, and ere they were ready, fell\nour Army.'\n\n'Ay--eight thousand men with guns.  I remember that night.'\n\n'But the war was not pushed.  That is the Government custom.  The\ntroops were recalled because the Government believed the Five Kings\nwere cowed; and it is not cheap to feed men among the high Passes.\nHilas and Bunar--Rajahs with guns--undertook for a price to guard the\nPasses against all coming from the North.  They protested both fear and\nfriendship.'  He broke off with a giggle into English:  'Of course, I\ntell you this unoffeecially to elucidate political situation, Mister\nO'Hara.  Offeecially, I am debarred from criticizing any action of\nsuperiors.  Now I go on.--This pleased the Government, anxious to avoid\nexpense, and a bond was made for so many rupees a month that Hilas and\nBunar should guard the Passes as soon as the State's troops were\nwithdrawn.  At that time--it was after we two met--I, who had been\nselling tea in Leh, became a clerk of accounts in the Army.  When the\ntroops were withdrawn, I was left behind to pay the coolies who made\nnew roads in the Hills. This road-making was part of the bond between\nBunar, Hilas, and the Government.'\n\n'So?  And then?'\n\n'I tell you, it was jolly-beastly cold up there too, after summer,'\nsaid Hurree Babu confidentially.  'I was afraid these Bunar men would\ncut my throat every night for thee pay-chest.  My native sepoy-guard,\nthey laughed at me!  By Jove!  I was such a fearful man.  Nevar mind\nthatt.  I go on colloquially ...  I send word many times that these two\nKings were sold to the North; and Mahbub Ali, who was yet farther\nNorth, amply confirmed it.  Nothing was done.  Only my feet were\nfrozen, and a toe dropped off.  I sent word that the roads for which I\nwas paying money to the diggers were being made for the feet of\nstrangers and enemies.'\n\n'For?'\n\n'For the Russians.  The thing was an open jest among the coolies. Then\nI was called down to tell what I knew by speech of tongue. Mahbub came\nSouth too.  See the end!  Over the Passes this year after\nsnow-melting'--he shivered afresh--'come two strangers under cover of\nshooting wild goats.  They bear guns, but they bear also chains and\nlevels and compasses.'\n\n'Oho!  The thing gets clearer.'\n\n'They are well received by Hilas and Bunar.  They make great promises;\nthey speak as the mouthpiece of a Kaisar with gifts.  Up the valleys,\ndown the valleys go they, saying, \"Here is a place to build a\nbreastwork; here can ye pitch a fort.  Here can ye hold the road\nagainst an army\"--the very roads for which I paid out the rupees\nmonthly.  The Government knows, but does nothing.  The three other\nKings, who were not paid for guarding the Passes, tell them by runner\nof the bad faith of Bunar and Hilas.  When all the evil is done, look\nyou--when these two strangers with the levels and the compasses make\nthe Five Kings to believe that a great army will sweep the Passes\ntomorrow or the next day--Hill-people are all fools--comes the order to\nme, Hurree Babu, \"Go North and see what those strangers do.\"  I say to\nCreighton Sahib, \"This is not a lawsuit, that we go about to collect\nevidence.\"'  Hurree returned to his English with a jerk:  \"'By Jove,\" I\nsaid, \"why the dooce do you not issue demi-offeecial orders to some\nbrave man to poison them, for an example?  It is, if you permit the\nobservation, most reprehensible laxity on your part.\"  And Colonel\nCreighton, he laughed at me!  It is all your beastly English pride.\nYou think no one dare conspire!  That is all tommy-rott.'\n\nKim smoked slowly, revolving the business, so far as he understood it,\nin his quick mind.\n\n'Then thou goest forth to follow the strangers?'\n\n'No.  To meet them.  They are coming in to Simla to send down their\nhorns and heads to be dressed at Calcutta.  They are exclusively\nsporting gentlemen, and they are allowed special faceelities by the\nGovernment.  Of course, we always do that.  It is our British pride.'\n\n'Then what is to fear from them?'\n\n'By Jove, they are not black people.  I can do all sorts of things with\nblack people, of course.  They are Russians, and highly unscrupulous\npeople.  I--I do not want to consort with them without a witness.'\n\n'Will they kill thee?'\n\n'Oah, thatt is nothing.  I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust,\nto meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate, you know.\nBut--but they may beat me.'\n\n'Why?'\n\nHurree Babu snapped his fingers with irritation.  'Of course I shall\naffeeliate myself to their camp in supernumerary capacity as perhaps\ninterpreter, or person mentally impotent and hungree, or some such\nthing.  And then I must pick up what I can, I suppose.  That is as easy\nfor me as playing Mister Doctor to the old lady.  Onlee--onlee--you\nsee, Mister O'Hara, I am unfortunately Asiatic, which is serious\ndetriment in some respects.  And all-so I am Bengali--a fearful man.'\n\n'God made the Hare and the Bengali.  What shame?'  said Kim, quoting\nthe proverb.\n\n'It was process of Evolution, I think, from Primal Necessity, but the\nfact remains in all the cui bono.  I am, oh, awfully fearful!--I\nremember once they wanted to cut off my head on the road to Lhassa.\n(No, I have never reached to Lhassa.) I sat down and cried, Mister\nO'Hara, anticipating Chinese tortures.  I do not suppose these two\ngentlemen will torture me, but I like to provide for possible\ncontingency with European assistance in emergency.'  He coughed and\nspat out the cardamoms.  'It is purely unoffeecial indent, to which you\ncan say \"No, Babu\".  If you have no pressing engagement with your old\nman--perhaps you might divert him; perhaps I can seduce his fancies--I\nshould like you to keep in Departmental touch with me till I find those\nsporting coves.  I have great opeenion of you since I met my friend at\nDelhi.  And also I will embody your name in my offeecial report when\nmatter is finally adjudicated.  It will be a great feather in your cap.\nThat is why I come really.'\n\n'Humph!  The end of the tale, I think, is true; but what of the\nfore-part?'\n\n'About the Five Kings?  Oah!  there is ever so much truth in it.  A\nlots more than you would suppose,' said Hurree earnestly.  'You\ncome--eh?  I go from here straight into the Doon.  It is verree verdant\nand painted meads.  I shall go to Mussoorie to good old Munsoorie\nPahar, as the gentlemen and ladies say.  Then by Rampur into Chini.\nThat is the only way they can come.  I do not like waiting in the cold,\nbut we must wait for them.  I want to walk with them to Simla. You see,\none Russian is a Frenchman, and I know my French pretty well.  I have\nfriends in Chandernagore.'\n\n'He would certainly rejoice to see the Hills again,' said Kim\nmeditatively.  'All his speech these ten days past has been of little\nelse.  If we go together--'\n\n'Oah!  We can be quite strangers on the road, if your lama prefers.  I\nshall just be four or five miles ahead.  There is no hurry for\nHurree--that is an Europe pun, ha!  ha!--and you come after.  There is\nplenty of time; they will plot and survey and map, of course.  I shall\ngo tomorrow, and you the next day, if you choose.  Eh?  You go think on\nit till morning.  By Jove, it is near morning now.'  He yawned\nponderously, and with never a civil word lumbered off to his\nsleeping-place.  But Kim slept little, and his thoughts ran in\nHindustani:\n\n'Well is the Game called great!  I was four days a scullion at Quetta,\nwaiting on the wife of the man whose book I stole.  And that was part\nof the Great Game!  From the South--God knows how far--came up the\nMahratta, playing the Great Game in fear of his life. Now I shall go\nfar and far into the North playing the Great Game. Truly, it runs like\na shuttle throughout all Hind.  And my share and my joy'--he smiled to\nthe darkness--'I owe to the lama here.  Also to Mahbub Ali--also to\nCreighton Sahib, but chiefly to the Holy One. He is right--a great and\na wonderful world--and I am Kim--Kim--Kim--alone--one person--in the\nmiddle of it all.  But I will see these strangers with their levels and\nchains...'\n\n'What was the upshot of last night's babble?'  said the lama, after his\norisons.\n\n'There came a strolling seller of drugs--a hanger-on of the Sahiba's.\nHim I abolished by arguments and prayers, proving that our charms are\nworthier than his coloured waters.'\n\n'Alas, my charms!  Is the virtuous woman still bent upon a new one?'\n\n'Very strictly.'\n\n'Then it must be written, or she will deafen me with her clamour.' He\nfumbled at his pencase.\n\n'In the Plains,' said Kim, 'are always too many people.  In the Hills,\nas I understand, there are fewer.'\n\n'Oh!  the Hills, and the snows upon the Hills.'  The lami tore off a\ntiny square of paper fit to go in an amulet.  'But what dost thou know\nof the Hills?'\n\n'They are very close.'  Kim thrust open the door and looked at the\nlong, peaceful line of the Himalayas flushed in morning-gold. 'Except\nin the dress of a Sahib, I have never set foot among them.'\n\nThe lama snuffed the wind wistfully.\n\n'If we go North,'--Kim put the question to the waking sunrise--'would\nnot much mid-day heat be avoided by walking among the lower hills at\nleast?  ...  Is the charm made, Holy One?'\n\n'I have written the names of seven silly devils--not one of whom is\nworth a grain of dust in the eye.  Thus do foolish women drag us from\nthe Way!'\n\nHurree Babu came out from behind the dovecote washing his teeth with\nostentatious ritual.  Full-fleshed, heavy-haunched, bull-necked, and\ndeep-voiced, he did not look like 'a fearful man'.  Kim signed almost\nimperceptibly that matters were in good train, and when the morning\ntoilet was over, Hurree Babu, in flowery speech, came to do honour to\nthe lama.  They ate, of course, apart, and afterwards the old lady,\nmore or less veiled behind a window, returned to the vital business of\ngreen-mango colics in the young.  The lama's knowledge of medicine was,\nof course, sympathetic only.  He believed that the dung of a black\nhorse, mixed with sulphur, and carried in a snake-skin, was a sound\nremedy for cholera; but the symbolism interested him far more than the\nscience.  Hurree Babu deferred to these views with enchanting\npoliteness, so that the lama called him a courteous physician.  Hurree\nBabu replied that he was no more than an inexpert dabbler in the\nmysteries; but at least--he thanked the Gods therefore--he knew when he\nsat in the presence of a master.  He himself had been taught by the\nSahibs, who do not consider expense, in the lordly halls of Calcutta;\nbut, as he was ever first to acknowledge, there lay a wisdom behind\nearthly wisdom--the high and lonely lore of meditation.  Kim looked on\nwith envy.  The Hurree Babu of his knowledge--oily, effusive, and\nnervous--was gone; gone, too, was the brazen drug-vendor of overnight.\nThere remained--polished, polite, attentive--a sober, learned son of\nexperience and adversity, gathering wisdom from the lama's lips.  The\nold lady confided to Kim that these rare levels were beyond her.  She\nliked charms with plenty of ink that one could wash off in water,\nswallow, and be done with.  Else what was the use of the Gods?  She\nliked men and women, and she spoke of them--of kinglets she had known\nin the past; of her own youth and beauty; of the depredations of\nleopards and the eccentricities of love Asiatic; of the incidence of\ntaxation, rack-renting, funeral ceremonies, her son-in-law (this by\nallusion, easy to be followed), the care of the young, and the age's\nlack of decency.  And Kim, as interested in the life of this world as\nshe soon to leave it, squatted with his feet under the hem of his robe,\ndrinking all in, while the lama demolished one after another every\ntheory of body-curing put forward by Hurree Babu.\n\nAt noon the Babu strapped up his brass-bound drug-box, took his\npatent-leather shoes of ceremony in one hand, a gay blue-and-white\numbrella in the other, and set off northwards to the Doon, where, he\nsaid, he was in demand among the lesser kings of those parts.\n\n'We will go in the cool of the evening, chela,' said the lama.  'That\ndoctor, learned in physic and courtesy, affirms that the people among\nthese lower hills are devout, generous, and much in need of a teacher.\nIn a very short time--so says the hakim--we come to cool air and the\nsmell of pines.'\n\n'Ye go to the Hills?  And by Kulu road?  Oh, thrice happy!'  shrilled\nthe old lady.  'But that I am a little pressed with the care of the\nhomestead I would take palanquin ...  but that would be shameless, and\nmy reputation would be cracked.  Ho!  Ho!  I know the road--every march\nof the road I know.  Ye will find charity throughout--it is not denied\nto the well-looking.  I will give orders for provision.  A servant to\nset you forth upon your journey?  No ...  Then I will at least cook ye\ngood food.'\n\n'What a woman is the Sahiba!'  said the white-bearded Oorya, when a\ntumult rose by the kitchen quarters.  'She has never forgotten a\nfriend:  she has never forgotten an enemy in all her years.  And her\ncookery--wah!'  He rubbed his slim stomach.\n\nThere were cakes, there were sweetmeats, there was cold fowl stewed to\nrags with rice and prunes--enough to burden Kim like a mule.\n\n'I am old and useless,' she said.  'None now love me--and none\nrespect--but there are few to compare with me when I call on the Gods\nand squat to my cooking-pots.  Come again, O people of good will.  Holy\nOne and disciple, come again.  The room is always prepared; the welcome\nis always ready ...  See the women do not follow thy chela too openly.\nI know the women of Kulu.  Take heed, chela, lest he run away when he\nsmells his Hills again ...  Hai!  Do not tilt the rice-bag upside down\n...  Bless the household, Holy One, and forgive thy servant her\nstupidities.'\n\nShe wiped her red old eyes on a corner of her veil, and clucked\nthroatily.\n\n'Women talk,' said the lama at last, 'but that is a woman's infirmity.\nI gave her a charm.  She is upon the Wheel and wholly given over to the\nshows of this life, but none the less, chela, she is virtuous, kindly,\nhospitable--of a whole and zealous heart.  Who shall say she does not\nacquire merit?'\n\n'Not I, Holy One,' said Kim, reslinging the bountiful provision on his\nshoulders.  'In my mind--behind my eyes--I have tried to picture such\nan one altogether freed from the Wheel--desiring nothing, causing\nnothing--a nun, as it were.'\n\n'And, O imp?'  The lama almost laughed aloud.\n\n'I cannot make the picture.'\n\n'Nor I. But there are many, many millions of lives before her.  She\nwill get wisdom a little, it may be, in each one.'\n\n'And will she forget how to make stews with saffron upon that road?'\n\n'Thy mind is set on things unworthy.  But she has skill.  I am\nrefreshed all over.  When we reach the lower hills I shall be yet\nstronger.  The hakim spoke truly to me this morn when he said a breath\nfrom the snows blows away twenty years from the life of a man.  We will\ngo up into the Hills--the high hills--up to the sound of snow-waters\nand the sound of the trees--for a little while.  The hakim said that at\nany time we may return to the Plains, for we do no more than skirt the\npleasant places.  The hakim is full of learning; but he is in no way\nproud.  I spoke to him--when thou wast talking to the Sahiba--of a\ncertain dizziness that lays hold upon the back of my neck in the night,\nand he said it rose from excessive heat--to be cured by cool air.  Upon\nconsideration, I marvelled that I had not thought of such a simple\nremedy.'\n\n'Didst thou tell him of thy Search?'  said Kim, a little jealously. He\npreferred to sway the lama by his own speech--not through the wiles of\nHurree Babu.\n\n'Assuredly.  I told him of my dream, and of the manner by which I had\nacquired merit by causing thee to be taught wisdom.'\n\n'Thou didst not say I was a Sahib?'\n\n'What need?  I have told thee many times we be but two souls seeking\nescape.  He said--and he is just herein--that the River of Healing will\nbreak forth even as I dreamed--at my feet, if need be.  Having found\nthe Way, seest thou, that shall free me from the Wheel, need I trouble\nto find a way about the mere fields of earth--which are illusion?  That\nwere senseless.  I have my dreams, night upon night repeated; I have\nJataka; and I have thee, Friend of all the World. It was written in thy\nhoroscope that a Red Bull on a green field--I have not\nforgotten--should bring thee to honour.  Who but I saw that prophecy\naccomplished?  Indeed, I was the instrument.  Thou shalt find me my\nRiver, being in return the instrument.  The Search is sure!'\n\nHe set his ivory-yellow face, serene and untroubled, towards the\nbeckoning Hills; his shadow shouldering far before him in the dust.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 13\n\n\n  Who hath desired the Sea--the immense and contemptuous surges?\n  The shudder, the stumble, the swerve ere the star-stabbing bowsprit\n      merges--\n  The orderly clouds of the Trades and the ridged roaring\n      sapphire thereunder--\n  Unheralded cliff-lurking flaws and the head-sails' low-volleying\n      thunder?\n  His Sea in no wonder the same--his Sea and the same in each wonder--\n  His Sea that his being fulfils?\n  So and no otherwise--so and no otherwise hill-men desire their hills!\n\n  The Sea and the Hills.\n\n\n\n'Who goes to the hills goes to his mother.'\n\nThey had crossed the Siwaliks and the half-tropical Doon, left\nMussoorie behind them, and headed north along the narrow hill-roads.\nDay after day they struck deeper into the huddled mountains, and day\nafter day Kim watched the lama return to a man's strength.  Among the\nterraces of the Doon he had leaned on the boy's shoulder, ready to\nprofit by wayside halts.  Under the great ramp to Mussoorie he drew\nhimself together as an old hunter faces a well-remembered bank, and\nwhere he should have sunk exhausted swung his long draperies about him,\ndrew a deep double-lungful of the diamond air, and walked as only a\nhillman can.  Kim, plains-bred and plains-fed, sweated and panted\nastonished.  'This is my country,' said the lama.  'Beside Such-zen,\nthis is flatter than a rice-field'; and with steady, driving strokes\nfrom the loins he strode upwards.  But it was on the steep downhill\nmarches, three thousand feet in three hours, that he went utterly away\nfrom Kim, whose back ached with holding back, and whose big toe was\nnigh cut off by his grass sandal-string.  Through the speckled shadow\nof the great deodar-forests; through oak feathered and plumed with\nferns; birch, ilex, rhododendron, and pine, out on to the bare\nhillsides' slippery sunburnt grass, and back into the woodlands' coolth\nagain, till oak gave way to bamboo and palm of the valley, the lama\nswung untiring.\n\nGlancing back in the twilight at the huge ridges behind him and the\nfaint, thin line of the road whereby they had come, he would lay out,\nwith a hillman's generous breadth of vision, fresh marches for the\nmorrow; or, halting in the neck of some uplifted pass that gave on\nSpiti and Kulu, would stretch out his hands yearningly towards the high\nsnows of the horizon.  In the dawns they flared windy-red above stark\nblue, as Kedarnath and Badrinath--kings of that wilderness--took the\nfirst sunlight.  All day long they lay like molten silver under the\nsun, and at evening put on their jewels again.  At first they breathed\ntemperately upon the travellers, winds good to meet when one crawled\nover some gigantic hog's-back; but in a few days, at a height of nine\nor ten thousand feet, those breezes bit; and Kim kindly allowed a\nvillage of hillmen to acquire merit by giving him a rough blanket-coat.\nThe lama was mildly surprised that anyone should object to the\nknife-edged breezes which had cut the years off his shoulders.\n\n'These are but the lower hills, chela.  There is no cold till we come\nto the true Hills.'\n\n'Air and water are good, and the people are devout enough, but the food\nis very bad,' Kim growled; 'and we walk as though we were mad--or\nEnglish.  It freezes at night, too.'\n\n'A little, maybe; but only enough to make old bones rejoice in the sun.\nWe must not always delight in soft beds and rich food.'\n\n'We might at least keep to the road.'\n\nKim had all a plainsman's affection for the well-trodden track, not six\nfeet wide, that snaked among the mountains; but the lama, being\nTibetan, could not refrain from short cuts over spurs and the rims of\ngravel-strewn slopes.  As he explained to his limping disciple, a man\nbred among mountains can prophesy the course of a mountain-road, and\nthough low-lying clouds might be a hindrance to a short-cutting\nstranger, they made no earthly difference to a thoughtful man.  Thus,\nafter long hours of what would be reckoned very fair mountaineering in\ncivilized countries, they would pant over a saddle-back, sidle past a\nfew landslips, and drop through forest at an angle of forty-five onto\nthe road again.  Along their track lay the villages of the\nhillfolk--mud and earth huts, timbers now and then rudely carved with\nan axe--clinging like swallows' nests against the steeps, huddled on\ntiny flats half-way down a three-thousand-foot glissade; jammed into a\ncorner between cliffs that funnelled and focused every wandering blast;\nor, for the sake of summer pasture, cowering down on a neck that in\nwinter would be ten feet deep in snow.  And the people--the sallow,\ngreasy, duffle-clad people, with short bare legs and faces almost\nEsquimaux--would flock out and adore.  The Plains--kindly and\ngentle--had treated the lama as a holy man among holy men.  But the\nHills worshipped him as one in the confidence of all their devils.\nTheirs was an almost obliterated Buddhism, overlaid with a\nnature-worship fantastic as their own landscapes, elaborate as the\nterracing of their tiny fields; but they recognized the big hat, the\nclicking rosary, and the rare Chinese texts for great authority; and\nthey respected the man beneath the hat.\n\n'We saw thee come down over the black Breasts of Eua,' said a Betah who\ngave them cheese, sour milk, and stone-hard bread one evening. 'We do\nnot use that often--except when calving cows stray in summer.  There is\na sudden wind among those stones that casts men down on the stillest\nday.  But what should such folk care for the Devil of Eua!'\n\nThen did Kim, aching in every fibre, dizzy with looking down, footsore\nwith cramping desperate toes into inadequate crannies, take joy in the\nday's march--such joy as a boy of St Xavier's who had won the\nquarter-mile on the flat might take in the praises of his friends.  The\nhills sweated the ghi and sugar suet off his bones; the dry air, taken\nsobbingly at the head of cruel passes, firmed and built out his upper\nribs; and the tilted levels put new hard muscles into calf and thigh.\n\nThey meditated often on the Wheel of Life--the more so since, as the\nlama said, they were freed from its visible temptations.  Except the\ngrey eagle and an occasional far-seen bear grubbing and rooting on the\nhillside; a vision of a furious painted leopard met at dawn in a still\nvalley devouring a goat; and now and again a bright-coloured bird, they\nwere alone with the winds and the grass singing under the wind.  The\nwomen of the smoky huts over whose roofs the two walked as they\ndescended the mountains, were unlovely and unclean, wives of many\nhusbands, and afflicted with goitre.  The men were woodcutters when\nthey were not farmers--meek, and of an incredible simplicity.  But that\nsuitable discourse might not fail, Fate sent them, overtaking and\novertaken upon the road, the courteous Dacca physician, who paid for\nhis food in ointments good for goitre and counsels that restore peace\nbetween men and women.  He seemed to know these hills as well as he\nknew the hill dialects, and gave the lama the lie of the land towards\nLadakh and Tibet.  He said they could return to the Plains at any\nmoment.  Meantime, for such as loved mountains, yonder road might\namuse.  This was not all revealed in a breath, but at evening\nencounters on the stone threshing-floors, when, patients disposed of,\nthe doctor would smoke and the lama snuff, while Kim watched the wee\ncows grazing on the housetops, or threw his soul after his eyes across\nthe deep blue gulfs between range and range.  And there were talks\napart in the dark woods, when the doctor would seek herbs, and Kim, as\nbudding physician, must accompany him.\n\n'You see, Mister O'Hara, I do not know what the deuce-an' all I shall\ndo when I find our sporting friends; but if you will kindly keep within\nsight of my umbrella, which is fine fixed point for cadastral survey, I\nshall feel much better.'\n\nKim looked out across the jungle of peaks.  'This is not my country,\nhakim.  Easier, I think, to find one louse in a bear-skin.'\n\n'Oah, thatt is my strong points.  There is no hurry for Hurree.  They\nwere at Leh not so long ago.  They said they had come down from the\nKarakorum with their heads and horns and all.  I am onlee afraid they\nwill have sent back all their letters and compromising things from Leh\ninto Russian territoree.  Of course they will walk away as far to the\nEast as possible--just to show that they were never among the Western\nStates.  You do not know the Hills?'  He scratched with a twig on the\nearth.  'Look!  They should have come in by Srinagar or Abbottabad.\nThatt is their short road--down the river by Bunji and Astor.  But they\nhave made mischief in the West.  So'--he drew a furrow from left to\nright--'they march and they march away East to Leh (ah!  it is cold\nthere), and down the Indus to Hanle (I know that road), and then down,\nyou see, to Bushahr and Chini valley.  That is ascertained by process\nof elimination, and also by asking questions from people that I cure so\nwell.  Our friends have been a long time playing about and producing\nimpressions.  So they are well known from far off.  You will see me\ncatch them somewhere in Chini valley. Please keep your eye on the\numbrella.'\n\nIt nodded like a wind-blown harebell down the valleys and round the\nmountain sides, and in due time the lama and Kim, who steered by\ncompass, would overhaul it, vending ointments and powders at eventide.\n'We came by such and such a way!'  The lama would throw a careless\nfinger backward at the ridges, and the umbrella would expend itself in\ncompliments.\n\nThey crossed a snowy pass in cold moonlight, when the lama, mildly\nchaffing Kim, went through up to his knees, like a Bactrian camel--the\nsnow-bred, shag-haired sort that came into the Kashmir Serai. They\ndipped across beds of light snow and snow-powdered shale, where they\ntook refuge from a gale in a camp of Tibetans hurrying down tiny sheep,\neach laden with a bag of borax.  They came out upon grassy shoulders\nstill snow-speckled, and through forest, to grass anew.  For all their\nmarchings, Kedarnath and Badrinath were not impressed; and it was only\nafter days of travel that Kim, uplifted upon some insignificant\nten-thousand-foot hummock, could see that a shoulder-knot or horn of\nthe two great lords had--ever so slightly--changed outline.\n\nAt last they entered a world within a world--a valley of leagues where\nthe high hills were fashioned of a mere rubble and refuse from off the\nknees of the mountains.  Here one day's march carried them no farther,\nit seemed, than a dreamer's clogged pace bears him in a nightmare.\nThey skirted a shoulder painfully for hours, and, behold, it was but an\noutlying boss in an outlying buttress of the main pile!  A rounded\nmeadow revealed itself, when they had reached it, for a vast tableland\nrunning far into the valley.  Three days later, it was a dim fold in\nthe earth to southward.\n\n'Surely the Gods live here!'  said Kim, beaten down by the silence and\nthe appalling sweep and dispersal of the cloud-shadows after rain.\n'This is no place for men!'\n\n'Long and long ago,' said the lama, as to himself, 'it was asked of the\nLord whether the world were everlasting.  On this the Excellent One\nreturned no answer ...  When I was in Ceylon, a wise Seeker confirmed\nthat from the gospel which is written in Pali.  Certainly, since we\nknow the way to Freedom, the question were unprofitable, but--look, and\nknow illusion, chela!  These--are the true Hills! They are like my\nhills by Suchzen.  Never were such hills!'\n\nAbove them, still enormously above them, earth towered away towards the\nsnow-line, where from east to west across hundreds of miles, ruled as\nwith a ruler, the last of the bold birches stopped.  Above that, in\nscarps and blocks upheaved, the rocks strove to fight their heads above\nthe white smother.  Above these again, changeless since the world's\nbeginning, but changing to every mood of sun and cloud, lay out the\neternal snow.  They could see blots and blurs on its face where storm\nand wandering wullie-wa got up to dance.  Below them, as they stood,\nthe forest slid away in a sheet of blue-green for mile upon mile; below\nthe forest was a village in its sprinkle of terraced fields and steep\ngrazing-grounds.  Below the village they knew, though a thunderstorm\nworried and growled there for the moment, a pitch of twelve or fifteen\nhundred feet gave to the moist valley where the streams gather that are\nthe mothers of young Sutluj.\n\nAs usual, the lama had led Kim by cow-track and by-road, far from the\nmain route along which Hurree Babu, that 'fearful man', had bucketed\nthree days before through a storm to which nine Englishmen out of ten\nwould have given full right of way.  Hurree was no game-shot--the snick\nof a trigger made him change colour--but, as he himself would have\nsaid, he was 'fairly effeecient stalker', and he had raked the huge\nvalley with a pair of cheap binoculars to some purpose.  Moreover, the\nwhite of worn canvas tents against green carries far.  Hurree Babu had\nseen all he wanted to see when he sat on the threshing-floor of\nZiglaur, twenty miles away as the eagle flies, and forty by road--that\nis to say, two small dots which one day were just below the snow-line,\nand the next had moved downward perhaps six inches on the hillside.\nOnce cleaned out and set to the work, his fat bare legs could cover a\nsurprising amount of ground, and this was the reason why, while Kim and\nthe lama lay in a leaky hut at Ziglaur till the storm should be\nover-past, an oily, wet, but always smiling Bengali, talking the best\nof English with the vilest of phrases, was ingratiating himself with\ntwo sodden and rather rheumatic foreigners.  He had arrived, revolving\nmany wild schemes, on the heels of a thunderstorm which had split a\npine over against their camp, and so convinced a dozen or two forcibly\nimpressed baggage-coolies the day was inauspicious for farther travel\nthat with one accord they had thrown down their loads and jibbed.  They\nwere subjects of a Hill Rajah who farmed out their services, as is the\ncustom, for his private gain; and, to add to their personal distresses,\nthe strange Sahibs had already threatened them with rifles.  The most\nof them knew rifles and Sahibs of old:  they were trackers and\nshikarris of the Northern valleys, keen after bear and wild goat; but\nthey had never been thus treated in their lives.  So the forest took\nthem to her bosom, and, for all oaths and clamour, refused to restore.\nThere was no need to feign madness or--the Babu had thought of another\nmeans of securing a welcome.  He wrung out his wet clothes, slipped on\nhis patent-leather shoes, opened the blue-and-white umbrella, and with\nmincing gait and a heart beating against his tonsils appeared as 'agent\nfor His Royal Highness, the Rajah of Rampur, gentlemen.  What can I do\nfor you, please?'\n\nThe gentlemen were delighted.  One was visibly French, the other\nRussian, but they spoke English not much inferior to the Babu's. They\nbegged his kind offices.  Their native servants had gone sick at Leh.\nThey had hurried on because they were anxious to bring the spoils of\nthe chase to Simla ere the skins grew moth-eaten.  They bore a general\nletter of introduction (the Babu salaamed to it orientally) to all\nGovernment officials.  No, they had not met any other shooting-parties\nen route.  They did for themselves.  They had plenty of supplies.  They\nonly wished to push on as soon as might be. At this he waylaid a\ncowering hillman among the trees, and after three minutes' talk and a\nlittle silver (one cannot be economical upon State service, though\nHurree's heart bled at the waste) the eleven coolies and the three\nhangers-on reappeared.  At least the Babu would be a witness to their\noppression.\n\n'My royal master, he will be much annoyed, but these people are onlee\ncommon people and grossly ignorant.  If your honours will kindly\noverlook unfortunate affair, I shall be much pleased.  In a little\nwhile rain will stop and we can then proceed.  You have been shooting,\neh?  That is fine performance!'\n\nHe skipped nimbly from one kilta to the next, making pretence to adjust\neach conical basket.  The Englishman is not, as a rule, familiar with\nthe Asiatic, but he would not strike across the wrist a kindly Babu who\nhad accidentally upset a kilta with a red oilskin top.  On the other\nhand, he would not press drink upon a Babu were he never so friendly,\nnor would he invite him to meat.  The strangers did all these things,\nand asked many questions--about women mostly--to which Hurree returned\ngay and unstudied answers. They gave him a glass of whitish fluid like\nto gin, and then more; and in a little time his gravity departed from\nhim.  He became thickly treasonous, and spoke in terms of sweeping\nindecency of a Government which had forced upon him a white man's\neducation and neglected to supply him with a white man's salary.  He\nbabbled tales of oppression and wrong till the tears ran down his\ncheeks for the miseries of his land.  Then he staggered off, singing\nlove-songs of Lower Bengal, and collapsed upon a wet tree-trunk.  Never\nwas so unfortunate a product of English rule in India more unhappily\nthrust upon aliens.\n\n'They are all just of that pattern,' said one sportsman to the other in\nFrench.  'When we get into India proper thou wilt see.  I should like\nto visit his Rajah.  One might speak the good word there.  It is\npossible that he has heard of us and wishes to signify his good-will.'\n\n'We have not time.  We must get into Simla as soon as may be,' his\ncompanion replied.  'For my own part, I wish our reports had been sent\nback from Hilas, or even Leh.'\n\n'The English post is better and safer.  Remember we are given all\nfacilities--and Name of God!--they give them to us too!  Is it\nunbelievable stupidity?'\n\n'It is pride--pride that deserves and will receive punishment.'\n\n'Yes!  To fight a fellow-Continental in our game is something.  There\nis a risk attached, but these people--bah!  It is too easy.'\n\n'Pride--all pride, my friend.'\n\n'Now what the deuce is good of Chandernagore being so close to Calcutta\nand all,' said Hurree, snoring open-mouthed on the sodden moss, 'if I\ncannot understand their French?  They talk so particularly fast!  It\nwould have been much better to cut their beastly throats.'\n\nWhen he presented himself again he was racked with a\nheadache--penitent, and volubly afraid that in his drunkenness he might\nhave been indiscreet.  He loved the British Government--it was the\nsource of all prosperity and honour, and his master at Rampur held the\nvery same opinion.  Upon this the men began to deride him and to quote\npast words, till step by step, with deprecating smirks, oily grins, and\nleers of infinite cunning, the poor Babu was beaten out of his defences\nand forced to speak--truth.  When Lurgan was told the tale later, he\nmourned aloud that he could not have been in the place of the stubborn,\ninattentive coolies, who with grass mats over their heads and the\nraindrops puddling in their footprints, waited on the weather.  All the\nSahibs of their acquaintance--rough-clad men joyously returning year\nafter year to their chosen gullies--had servants and cooks and\norderlies, very often hillmen.  These Sahibs travelled without any\nretinue.  Therefore they were poor Sahibs, and ignorant; for no Sahib\nin his senses would follow a Bengali's advice.  But the Bengali,\nappearing from somewhere, had given them money, and could make shift\nwith their dialect.  Used to comprehensive ill-treatment from their own\ncolour, they suspected a trap somewhere, and stood by to run if\noccasion offered.\n\nThen through the new-washed air, steaming with delicious earth-smells,\nthe Babu led the way down the slopes--walking ahead of the coolies in\npride; walking behind the foreigners in humility.  His thoughts were\nmany and various.  The least of them would have interested his\ncompanions beyond words.  But he was an agreeable guide, ever keen to\npoint out the beauties of his royal master's domain.  He peopled the\nhills with anything thev had a mind to slay--thar, ibex, or markhor,\nand bear by Elisha's allowance.  He discoursed of botany and ethnology\nwith unimpeachable inaccuracy, and his store of local legends--he had\nbeen a trusted agent of the State for fifteen years, remember--was\ninexhaustible.\n\n'Decidedly this fellow is an original,' said the taller of the two\nforeigners.  'He is like the nightmare of a Viennese courier.'\n\n'He represents in little India in transition--the monstrous hybridism\nof East and West,' the Russian replied.  'It is we who can deal with\nOrientals.'\n\n'He has lost his own country and has not acquired any other.  But he\nhas a most complete hatred of his conquerors.  Listen.  He confided to\nme last night,' said the other.\n\nUnder the striped umbrella Hurree Babu was straining ear and brain to\nfollow the quick-poured French, and keeping both eyes on a kilta full\nof maps and documents--an extra-large one with a double red oil-skin\ncover.  He did not wish to steal anything.  He only desired to know\nwhat to steal, and, incidentally, how to get away when he had stolen\nit.  He thanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that\nthere remained some valuables to steal.\n\nOn the second day the road rose steeply to a grass spur above the\nforest; and it was here, about sunset, that they came across an aged\nlama--but they called him a bonze--sitting cross-legged above a\nmysterious chart held down by stones, which he was explaining to a\nyoung man, evidently a neophyte, of singular, though unwashen, beauty.\nThe striped umbrella had been sighted half a march away, and Kim had\nsuggested a halt till it came up to them.\n\n'Ha!'  said Hurree Babu, resourceful as Puss-in-Boots.  'That is\neminent local holy man.  Probably subject of my royal master.'\n\n'What is he doing?  It is very curious.'\n\n'He is expounding holy picture--all hand-worked.'\n\nThe two men stood bareheaded in the wash of the afternoon sunlight low\nacross the gold-coloured grass.  The sullen coolies, glad of the check,\nhalted and slid down their loads.\n\n'Look!'  said the Frenchman.  'It is like a picture for the birth of a\nreligion--the first teacher and the first disciple.  Is he a Buddhist?'\n\n'Of some debased kind,' the other answered.  'There are no true\nBuddhists among the Hills.  But look at the folds of the drapery. Look\nat his eyes--how insolent!  Why does this make one feel that we are so\nyoung a people?'  The speaker struck passionately at a tall weed.  'We\nhave nowhere left our mark yet.  Nowhere!  That, do you understand, is\nwhat disquiets me.'  He scowled at the placid face, and the monumental\ncalm of the pose.\n\n'Have patience.  We shall make your mark together--we and you young\npeople.  Meantime, draw his picture.'\n\nThe Babu advanced loftily; his back out of all keeping with his\ndeferential speech, or his wink towards Kim.\n\n'Holy One, these be Sahibs.  My medicines cured one of a flux, and I go\ninto Simla to oversee his recovery.  They wish to see thy picture--'\n\n'To heal the sick is always good.  This is the Wheel of Life,' said the\nlama, 'the same I showed thee in the hut at Ziglaur when the rain fell.'\n\n'And to hear thee expound it.'\n\nThe lama's eyes lighted at the prospect of new listeners.  'To expound\nthe Most Excellent Way is good.  Have they any knowledge of Hindi, such\nas had the Keeper of Images?'\n\n'A little, maybe.'\n\nHereat, simply as a child engrossed with a new game, the lama threw\nback his head and began the full-throated invocation of the Doctor of\nDivinity ere he opens the full doctrine.  The strangers leaned on their\nalpenstocks and listened.  Kim, squatting humbly, watched the red\nsunlight on their faces, and the blend and parting of their long\nshadows.  They wore un-English leggings and curious girt-in belts that\nreminded him hazily of the pictures in a book in St Xavier's library\n\"The Adventures of a Young Naturalist in Mexico\" was its name.  Yes,\nthey looked very like the wonderful M. Sumichrast of that tale, and\nvery unlike the 'highly unscrupulous folk' of Hurree Babu's imagining.\nThe coolies, earth-coloured and mute, crouched reverently some twenty\nor thirty yards away, and the Babu, the slack of his thin gear snapping\nlike a marking-flag in the chill breeze, stood by with an air of happy\nproprietorship.\n\n'These are the men,' Hurree whispered, as the ritual went on and the\ntwo whites followed the grass-blade sweeping from Hell to Heaven and\nback again.  'All their books are in the large kilta with the reddish\ntop--books and reports and maps--and I have seen a King's letter that\neither Hilas or Bunar has written.  They guard it most carefully.  They\nhave sent nothing back from Hilas or Leh.  That is sure.'\n\n'Who is with them?'\n\n'Only the beegar-coolies.  They have no servants.  They are so close\nthey cook their own food.'\n\n'But what am I to do?'\n\n'Wait and see.  Only if any chance comes to me thou wilt know where to\nseek for the papers.'\n\n'This were better in Mahbub Ali's hands than a Bengali's,' said Kim\nscornfully.\n\n'There are more ways of getting to a sweetheart than butting down a\nwall.'\n\n'See here the Hell appointed for avarice and greed.  Flanked upon the\none side by Desire and on the other by Weariness.'  The lama warmed to\nhis work, and one of the strangers sketched him in the quick-fading\nlight.\n\n'That is enough,' the man said at last brusquely.  'I cannot understand\nhim, but I want that picture.  He is a better artist than I. Ask him if\nhe will sell it.'\n\n'He says \"No, sar,\"' the Babu replied.  The lama, of course, would no\nmore have parted with his chart to a casual wayfarer than an archbishop\nwould pawn the holy vessels of his cathedral.  All Tibet is full of\ncheap reproductions of the Wheel; but the lama was an artist, as well\nas a wealthy Abbot in his own place.\n\n'Perhaps in three days, or four, or ten, if I perceive that the Sahib\nis a Seeker and of good understanding, I may myself draw him another.\nBut this was used for the initiation of a novice.  Tell him so, hakim.'\n\n'He wishes it now--for money.'\n\nThe lama shook his head slowly and began to fold up the Wheel.  The\nRussian, on his side, saw no more than an unclean old man haggling over\na dirty piece of paper.  He drew out a handful of rupees, and snatched\nhalf-jestingly at the chart, which tore in the lama's grip. A low\nmurmur of horror went up from the coolies--some of whom were Spiti men\nand, by their lights, good Buddhists.  The lama rose at the insult; his\nhand went to the heavy iron pencase that is the priest's weapon, and\nthe Babu danced in agony.\n\n'Now you see--you see why I wanted witnesses.  They are highly\nunscrupulous people.  Oh, sar!  sar!  You must not hit holyman!'\n\n'Chela!  He has defiled the Written Word!'\n\nIt was too late.  Before Kim could ward him off, the Russian struck the\nold man full on the face.  Next instant he was rolling over and over\ndownhill with Kim at his throat.  The blow had waked every unknown\nIrish devil in the boy's blood, and the sudden fall of his enemy did\nthe rest.  The lama dropped to his knees, half-stunned; the coolies\nunder their loads fled up the hill as fast as plainsmen run aross the\nlevel.  They had seen sacrilege unspeakable, and it behoved them to get\naway before the Gods and devils of the hills took vengeance.  The\nFrenchman ran towards the lama, fumbling at his revolver with some\nnotion of making him a hostage for his companion. A shower of cutting\nstones--hillmen are very straight shots--drove him away, and a coolie\nfrom Ao-chung snatched the lama into the stampede.  All came about as\nswiftly as the sudden mountain-darkness.\n\n'They have taken the baggage and all the guns,' yelled the Frenchman,\nfiring blindly into the twilight.\n\n'All right, sar!  All right!  Don't shoot.  I go to rescue,' and\nHurree, pounding down the slope, cast himself bodily upon the delighted\nand astonished Kim, who was banging his breathless foe's head against a\nboulder.\n\n'Go back to the coolies,' whispered the Babu in his ear.  'They have\nthe baggage.  The papers are in the kilta with the red top, but look\nthrough all.  Take their papers, and specially the murasla [King's\nletter].  Go!  The other man comes!'\n\nKim tore uphill.  A revolver-bullet rang on a rock by his side, and he\ncowered partridge-wise.\n\n'If you shoot,' shouted Hurree, 'they will descend and annihilate us.\nI have rescued the gentleman, sar.  This is particularly dangerous.'\n\n'By Jove!'  Kim was thinking hard in English.  'This is dam'-tight\nplace, but I think it is self-defence.'  He felt in his bosom for\nMahbub's gift, and uncertainly--save for a few practice shots in the\nBikanir desert, he had never used the little gun--pulled the trigger.\n\n'What did I say, sar!'  The Babu seemed to be in tears.  'Come down\nhere and assist to resuscitate.  We are all up a tree, I tell you.'\n\nThe shots ceased.  There was a sound of stumbling feet, and Kim hurried\nupward through the gloom, swearing like a cat--or a country-bred.\n\n'Did they wound thee, chela?'  called the lama above him.\n\n'No.  And thou?'  He dived into a clump of stunted firs.\n\n'Unhurt.  Come away.  We go with these folk to Shamlegh-under-the-Snow.'\n\n'But not before we have done justice,' a voice cried.  'I have got the\nSahibs' guns--all four.  Let us go down.'\n\n'He struck the Holy One--we saw it!  Our cattle will be barren--our\nwives will cease to bear!  The snows will slide upon us as we go\nhome...  Atop of all other oppression too!'\n\nThe little fir-clump filled with clamouring coolies--panic-stricken,\nand in their terror capable of anything.  The man from Ao-chung clicked\nthe breech-bolt of his gun impatiently, and made as to go downhill.\n\n'Wait a little, Holy One; they cannot go far.  Wait till I return,'\nsaid he.\n\n'It is this person who has suffered wrong,' said the lama, his hand\nover his brow.\n\n'For that very reason,' was the reply.\n\n'If this person overlooks it, your hands are clean.  Moreover, ye\nacquire merit by obedience.'\n\n'Wait, and we will all go to Shamlegh together,' the man insisted.\n\nFor a moment, for just so long as it needs to stuff a cartridge into a\nbreech-loader, the lama hesitated.  Then he rose to his feet, and laid\na finger on the man's shoulder.\n\n'Hast thou heard?  I say there shall be no killing--I who was Abbot of\nSuch-zen.  Is it any lust of thine to be re-born as a rat, or a snake\nunder the eaves--a worm in the belly of the most mean beast? Is it thy\nwish to--'\n\nThe man from Ao-chung fell to his knees, for the voice boomed like a\nTibetan devil-gong.\n\n'Ai!  ai!'  cried the Spiti men.  'Do not curse us--do not curse him.\nIt was but his zeal, Holy One!  ... Put down the rifle, fool!'\n\n'Anger on anger!  Evil on evil!  There will be no killing.  Let the\npriest-beaters go in bondage to their own acts.  Just and sure is the\nWheel, swerving not a hair!  They will be born many times--in torment.'\nHis head drooped, and he leaned heavily on Kim's shoulder.\n\n'I have come near to great evil, chela,' he whispered in that dead hush\nunder the pines.  'I was tempted to loose the bullet; and truly, in\nTibet there would have been a heavy and a slow death for them ... He\nstruck me across the face ...  upon the flesh ...'  He slid to the\nground, breathing heavily, and Kim could hear the over-driven heart\nbump and check.\n\n'Have they hurt him to the death?'  said the Ao-chung man, while the\nothers stood mute.\n\nKim knelt over the body in deadly fear.  'Nay,' he cried passionately,\n'this is only a weakness.'  Then he remembered that he was a white man,\nwith a white man's camp-fittings at his service. 'Open the kiltas!  The\nSahibs may have a medicine.'\n\n'Oho!  Then I know it,' said the Ao-chung man with a laugh.  'Not for\nfive years was I Yankling Sahib's shikarri without knowing that\nmedicine.  I too have tasted it.  Behold!'\n\nHe drew from his breast a bottle of cheap whisky--such as is sold to\nexplorers at Leh--and cleverly forced a little between the lama's teeth.\n\n'So I did when Yankling Sahib twisted his foot beyond Astor.  Aha!  I\nhave already looked into their baskets--but we will make fair division\nat Shamlegh.  Give him a little more.  It is good medicine. Feel!  His\nheart goes better now.  Lay his head down and rub a little on the\nchest.  If he had waited quietly while I accounted for the Sahibs this\nwould never have come.  But perhaps the Sahibs may chase us here.  Then\nit would not be wrong to shoot them with their own guns, heh?'\n\n'One is paid, I think, already,' said Kim between his teeth.  'I kicked\nhim in the groin as we went downhill.  Would I had killed him!'\n\n'It is well to be brave when one does not live in Rampur,' said one\nwhose hut lay within a few miles of the Rajah's rickety palace.  'If we\nget a bad name among the Sahibs, none will employ us as shikarris any\nmore.'\n\n'Oh, but these are not Angrezi Sahibs--not merry-minded men like Fostum\nSahib or Yankling Sahib.  They are foreigners--they cannot speak\nAngrezi as do Sahibs.'\n\nHere the lama coughed and sat up, groping for the rosary.\n\n'There shall be no killing,' he murmured.  'Just is the Wheel!  Evil on\nevil--'\n\n'Nay, Holy One.  We are all here.'  The Ao-chung man timidly patted his\nfeet.  'Except by thy order, no one shall be slain.  Rest awhile. We\nwill make a little camp here, and later, as the moon rises, we go to\nShamlegh-under-the-Snow.'\n\n'After a blow,' said a Spiti man sententiously, 'it is best to sleep.'\n\n'There is, as it were, a dizziness at the back of my neck, and a\npinching in it.  Let me lay my head on thy lap, chela.  I am an old\nman, but not free from passion ...  We must think of the Cause of\nThings.'\n\n'Give him a blanket.  We dare not light a fire lest the Sahibs see.'\n\n'Better get away to Shamlegh.  None will follow us to Shamlegh.'\n\nThis was the nervous Rampur man.\n\n'I have been Fostum Sahib's shikarri, and I am Yankling Sahib's\nshikarri.  I should have been with Yankling Sahib now but for this\ncursed beegar [the corvee].  Let two men watch below with the guns lest\nthe Sahibs do more foolishness.  I shall not leave this Holy One.'\n\nThey sat down a little apart from the lama, and, after listening\nawhile, passed round a water-pipe whose receiver was an old Day and\nMartin blacking-bottle.  The glow of the red charcoal as it went from\nhand to hand lit up the narrow, blinking eyes, the high Chinese\ncheek-bones, and the bull-throats that melted away into the dark duffle\nfolds round the shoulders.  They looked like kobolds from some magic\nmine--gnomes of the hills in conclave.  And while they talked, the\nvoices of the snow-waters round them diminished one by one as the\nnight-frost choked and clogged the runnels.\n\n'How he stood up against us!'  said a Spiti man admiring.  'I remember\nan old ibex, out Ladakh-way, that Dupont Sahib missed on a\nshoulder-shot, seven seasons back, standing up just like him.  Dupont\nSahib was a good shikarri.'\n\n'Not as good as Yankling Sahib.'  The Ao-chung man took a pull at the\nwhisky-bottle and passed it over.  'Now hear me--unless any other man\nthinks he knows more.'\n\nThe challenge was not taken up.\n\n'We go to Shamlegh when the moon rises.  There we will fairly divide\nthe baggage between us.  I am content with this new little rifle and\nall its cartridges.'\n\n'Are the bears only bad on thy holding?  said a mate, sucking at the\npipe.\n\n'No; but musk-pods are worth six rupees apiece now, and thy women can\nhave the canvas of the tents and some of the cooking-gear.  We will do\nall that at Shamlegh before dawn.  Then we all go our ways, remembering\nthat we have never seen or taken service with these Sahibs, who may,\nindeed, say that we have stolen their baggage.'\n\n'That is well for thee, but what will our Rajah say?'\n\n'Who is to tell him?  Those Sahibs, who cannot speak our talk, or the\nBabu, who for his own ends gave us money?  Will he lead an army against\nus?  What evidence will remain?  That we do not need we shall throw on\nShamlegh-midden, where no man has yet set foot.'\n\n'Who is at Shamlegh this summer?'  The place was only a grazing centre\nof three or four huts.'\n\n'The Woman of Shamlegh.  She has no love for Sahibs, as we know.  The\nothers can be pleased with little presents; and here is enough for us\nall.'  He patted the fat sides of the nearest basket.\n\n'But--but--'\n\n'I have said they are not true Sahibs.  All their skins and heads were\nbought in the bazar at Leh.  I know the marks.  I showed them to ye\nlast march.'\n\n'True.  They were all bought skins and heads.  Some had even the moth\nin them.'\n\nThat was a shrewd argument, and the Ao-chung man knew his fellows.\n\n'If the worst comes to the worst, I shall tell Yankling Sahib, who is a\nman of a merry mind, and he will laugh.  We are not doing any wrong to\nany Sahibs whom we know.  They are priest-beaters.  They frightened us.\nWe fled!  Who knows where we dropped the baggage?  Do ye think Yankling\nSahib will permit down-country police to wander all over the hills,\ndisturbing his game?  It is a far cry from Simla to Chini, and farther\nfrom Shamlegh to Shamlegh-midden.'\n\n'So be it, but I carry the big kilta.  The basket with the red top that\nthe Sahibs pack themselves every morning.'\n\n'Thus it is proved,' said the Shamlegh man adroitly, 'that they are\nSahibs of no account.  Who ever heard of Fostum Sahib, or Yankling\nSahib, or even the little Peel Sahib that sits up of nights to shoot\nserow--I say, who, ever heard of these Sahibs coming into the hills\nwithout a down-country cook, and a bearer, and--and all manner of\nwell-paid, high-handed and oppressive folk in their tail?  How can they\nmake trouble?  What of the kilta?'\n\n'Nothing, but that it is full of the Written Word--books and papers in\nwhich they wrote, and strange instruments, as of worship.'\n\n'Shamlegh-midden will take them all.'\n\n'True!  But how if we insult the Sahibs' Gods thereby!  I do not like\nto handle the Written Word in that fashion.  And their brass idols are\nbeyond my comprehension.  It is no plunder for simple hill-folk.'\n\n'The old man still sleeps.  Hst!  We will ask his chela.'  The Ao-chung\nman refreshed himself, and swelled with pride of leadership.\n\n'We have here,' he whispered, 'a kilta whose nature we do not know.'\n\n'But I do,' said Kim cautiously.  The lama drew breath in natural, easy\nsleep, and Kim had been thinking of Hurree's last words.  As a player\nof the Great Game, he was disposed just then to reverence the Babu.\n'It is a kilta with a red top full of very wonderful things, not to be\nhandled by fools.'\n\n'I said it; I said it,' cried the bearer of that burden.  'Thinkest\nthou it will betray us?'\n\n'Not if it be given to me.  I can draw out its magic.  Otherwise it\nwill do great harm.'\n\n'A priest always takes his share.'  Whisky was demoralizing the\nAo-chung man.\n\n'It is no matter to me.'  Kim answered, with the craft of his\nmother-country.  'Share it among you, and see what comes!'\n\n'Not I. I was only jesting.  Give the order.  There is more than enough\nfor us all.  We go our way from Shamlegh in the dawn.'\n\nThey arranged and re-arranged their artless little plans for another\nhour, while Kim shivered with cold and pride.  The humour of the\nsituation tickled the Irish and the Oriental in his soul.  Here were\nthe emissaries of the dread Power of the North, very possibly as great\nin their own land as Mahbub or Colonel Creighton, suddenly smitten\nhelpless.  One of them, he privately knew, would be lame for a time.\nThey had made promises to Kings.  Tonight they lay out somewhere below\nhim, chartless, foodless, tentless, gunless--except for Hurree Babu,\nguideless.  And this collapse of their Great Game (Kim wondered to whom\nthey would report it), this panicky bolt into the night, had come about\nthrough no craft of Hurree's or contrivance of Kim's, but simply,\nbeautifully, and inevitably as the capture of Mahbub's fakir-friends by\nthe zealous young policeman at Umballa.\n\n'They are there--with nothing; and, by Jove, it is cold!  I am here\nwith all their things.  Oh, they will be angry!  I am sorry for Hurree\nBabu.'\n\nKim might have saved his pity, for though at that moment the Bengali\nsuffered acutely in the flesh, his soul was puffed and lofty.  A mile\ndown the hill, on the edge of the pine-forest, two half-frozen men--one\npowerfully sick at intervals--were varying mutual recriminations with\nthe most poignant abuse of the Babu, who seemed distraught with terror.\nThey demanded a plan of action.  He explained that they were very lucky\nto be alive; that their coolies, if not then stalking them, had passed\nbeyond recall; that the Rajah, his master, was ninety miles away, and,\nso far from lending them money and a retinue for the Simla journey,\nwould surely cast them into prison if he heard that they had hit a\npriest.  He enlarged on this sin and its consequences till they bade\nhim change the subject. Their one hope, said he, was unostentatious\nflight from village to village till they reached civilization; and, for\nthe hundredth time dissolved in tears, he demanded of the high stars\nwhy the Sahibs 'had beaten holy man'.\n\nTen steps would have taken Hurree into the creaking gloom utterly\nbeyond their reach--to the shelter and food of the nearest village,\nwhere glib-tongued doctors were scarce.  But he preferred to endure\ncold, belly-pinch, bad words, and occasional blows in the company of\nhis honoured employers.  Crouched against a tree-trunk, he sniffed\ndolefully.\n\n'And have you thought,' said the uninjured man hotly, 'what sort of\nspectacle we shall present wandering through these hills among these\naborigines?'\n\nHurree Babu had thought of little else for some hours, but the remark\nwas not to his address.\n\n'We cannot wander!  I can hardly walk,' groaned Kim's victim.\n\n'Perhaps the holy man will be merciful in loving-kindness, sar,\notherwise--'\n\n'I promise myself a peculiar pleasure in emptying my revolver into that\nyoung bonze when next we meet,' was the unchristian answer.\n\n'Revolvers!  Vengeance!  Bonzes!'  Hurree crouched lower.  The war was\nbreaking out afresh.  'Have you no consideration for our loss?  The\nbaggage!  The baggage!'  He could hear the speaker literally dancing on\nthe grass.  'Everything we bore!  Everything we have secured!  Our\ngains!  Eight months' work!  Do you know what that means?  \"Decidedly\nit is we who can deal with Orientals!\"  Oh, you have done well.'\n\nThey fell to it in several tongues, and Hurree smiled.  Kim was with\nthe kiltas, and in the kiltas lay eight months of good diplomacy. There\nwas no means of communicating with the boy, but he could be trusted.\nFor the rest, Hurree could so stage-manage the journey through the\nhills that Hilas, Bunar, and four hundred miles of hill-roads should\ntell the tale for a generation.  Men who cannot control their own\ncoolies are little respected in the Hills, and the hillman has a very\nkeen sense of humour.\n\n'If I had done it myself,' thought Hurree, 'it would not have been\nbetter; and, by Jove, now I think of it, of course I arranged it\nmyself.  How quick I have been!  Just when I ran downhill I thought it!\nThee outrage was accidental, but onlee me could have worked it--ah--for\nall it was dam'-well worth.  Consider the moral effect upon these\nignorant peoples!  No treaties--no papers--no written documents at\nall--and me to interpret for them.  How I shall laugh with the Colonel!\nI wish I had their papers also:  but you cannot occupy two places in\nspace simultaneously.  Thatt is axiomatic.'\n\n\n\n\nChapter 14\n\n\n  My brother kneels (so saith Kabir)\n  To stone and brass in heathen wise,\n  But in my brother's voice I hear\n  My own unanswered agonies.\n  His God is as his Fates assign--\n  His prayer is all the world's--and mine.\n\n  The Prayer.\n\n\nAt moonrise the cautious coolies got under way.  The lama, refreshed by\nhis sleep and the spirit, needed no more than Kim's shoulder to bear\nhim along--a silent, swift-striding man.  They held the shale-sprinkled\ngrass for an hour, swept round the shoulder of an immortal cliff, and\nclimbed into a new country entirely blocked off from all sight of Chini\nvalley.  A huge pasture-ground ran up fan-shaped to the living snow.\nAt its base was perhaps half an acre of flat land, on which stood a few\nsoil and timber huts.  Behind them--for, hill-fashion, they were\nperched on the edge of all things--the ground fell sheer two thousand\nfeet to Shamlegh-midden, where never yet man has set foot.\n\nThe men made no motion to divide the plunder till they had seen the\nlama bedded down in the best room of the place, with Kim shampooing his\nfeet, Mohammedan-fashion.\n\n'We will send food,' said the Ao-chung man, 'and the red-topped kilta.\nBy dawn there will be none to give evidence, one way or the other.  If\nanything is not needed in the kilta--see here!'\n\nHe pointed through the window--opening into space that was filled with\nmoonlight reflected from the snow--and threw out an empty whisky-bottle.\n\n'No need to listen for the fall.  This is the world's end,' he said,\nand went out.  The lama looked forth, a hand on either sill, with eyes\nthat shone like yellow opals.  From the enormous pit before him white\npeaks lifted themselves yearning to the moonlight.  The rest was as the\ndarkness of interstellar space.\n\n'These,' he said slowly, 'are indeed my Hills.  Thus should a man\nabide, perched above the world, separated from delights, considering\nvast matters.'\n\n'Yes; if he has a chela to prepare tea for him, and to fold a blanket\nfor his head, and to chase out calving cows.'\n\nA smoky lamp burned in a niche, but the full moonlight beat it down;\nand by the mixed light, stooping above the food-bag and cups, Kim moved\nlike a tall ghost.\n\n'Ai!  But now I have let the blood cool, my head still beats and drums,\nand there is a cord round the back of my neck.'\n\n'No wonder.  It was a strong blow.  May he who dealt it--'\n\n'But for my own passions there would have been no evil.'\n\n'What evil?  Thou hast saved the Sahibs from the death they deserved a\nhundred times.'\n\n'The lesson is not well learnt, chela.'  The lama came to rest on a\nfolded blanket, as Kim went forward with his evening routine.  'The\nblow was but a shadow upon a shadow.  Evil in itself--my legs weary\napace these latter days!--it met evil in me:  anger, rage, and a lust\nto return evil.  These wrought in my blood, woke tumult in my stomach,\nand dazzled my ears.'  Here he drank scalding black-tea ceremonially,\ntaking the hot cup from Kim's hand.  'Had I been passionless, the evil\nblow would have done only bodily evil--a scar, or a bruise--which is\nillusion.  But my mind was not abstracted, for rushed in straightway a\nlust to let the Spiti men kill.  In fighting that lust, my soul was\ntorn and wrenched beyond a thousand blows.  Not till I had repeated the\nBlessings' (he meant the Buddhist Beatitudes) 'did I achieve calm.  But\nthe evil planted in me by that moment's carelessness works out to its\nend.  Just is the Wheel, swerving not a hair!  Learn the lesson, chela.'\n\n'It is too high for me,' Kim muttered.  'I am still all shaken.  I am\nglad I hurt the man.'\n\n'I felt that, sleeping upon thy knees, in the wood below.  It\ndisquieted me in my dreams--the evil in thy soul working through to\nmine.  Yet on the other hand'--he loosed his rosary--'I have acquired\nmerit by saving two lives--the lives of those that wronged me.  Now I\nmust see into the Cause of Things.  The boat of my soul staggers.'\n\n'Sleep, and be strong.  That is wisest.'\n\n'I meditate.  There is a need greater than thou knowest.'\n\nTill the dawn, hour after hour, as the moonlight paled on the high\npeaks, and that which had been belted blackness on the sides of the far\nhills showed as tender green forest, the lama stared fixedly at the\nwall.  From time to time he groaned.  Outside the barred door, where\ndiscomfited kine came to ask for their old stable, Shamlegh and the\ncoolies gave itself up to plunder and riotous living.  The Ao-chung man\nwas their leader, and once they had opened the Sahibs' tinned foods and\nfound that they were very good they dared not turn back.  Shamlegh\nkitchen-midden took the dunnage.\n\nWhen Kim, after a night of bad dreams, stole forth to brush his teeth\nin the morning chill, a fair-coloured woman with turquoise-studded\nheadgear drew him aside.\n\n'The others have gone.  They left thee this kilta as the promise was. I\ndo not love Sahibs, but thou wilt make us a charm in return for it.  We\ndo not wish little Shamlegh to get a bad name on account of\nthe--accident.  I am the Woman of Shamlegh.'  She looked him over with\nbold, bright eyes, unlike the usual furtive glance of hillwomen.\n\n'Assuredly.  But it must be done in secret.'\n\nShe raised the heavy kilta like a toy and slung it into her own hut.\n\n'Out and bar the door!  Let none come near till it is finished,' said\nKim.\n\n'But afterwards--we may talk?'\n\nKim tilted the kilta on the floor--a cascade of Survey-instruments,\nbooks, diaries, letters, maps, and queerly scented native\ncorrespondence.  At the very bottom was an embroidered bag covering a\nsealed, gilded, and illuminated document such as one King sends to\nanother.  Kim caught his breath with delight, and reviewed the\nsituation from a Sahib's point of view.\n\n'The books I do not want.  Besides, they are logarithms--Survey, I\nsuppose.'  He laid them aside.  'The letters I do not understand, but\nColonel Creighton will.  They must all be kept.  The maps--they draw\nbetter maps than me--of course.  All the native letters--oho!--and\nparticularly the murasla.'  He sniffed the embroidered bag.  'That must\nbe from Hilas or Bunar, and Hurree Babu spoke truth.  By Jove! It is a\nfine haul.  I wish Hurree could know ...  The rest must go out of the\nwindow.'  He fingered a superb prismatic compass and the shiny top of a\ntheodolite.  But after all, a Sahib cannot very well steal, and the\nthings might be inconvenient evidence later.  He sorted out every scrap\nof manuscript, every map, and the native letters.  They made one\nsoftish slab.  The three locked ferril-backed books, with five worn\npocket-books, he put aside.\n\n'The letters and the murasla I must carry inside my coat and under my\nbelt, and the hand-written books I must put into the food-bag.  It will\nbe very heavy.  No.  I do not think there is anything more.  If there\nis, the coolies have thrown it down the khud, so thatt is all right.\nNow you go too.'  He repacked the kilta with all he meant to lose, and\nhove it up on to the windowsill.  A thousand feet below lay a long,\nlazy, round-shouldered bank of mist, as yet untouched by the morning\nsun.  A thousand feet below that was a hundred-year-old pine-forest.\nHe could see the green tops looking like a bed of moss when a wind-eddy\nthinned the cloud.\n\n'No!  I don't think any one will go after you!'\n\nThe wheeling basket vomited its contents as it dropped.  The theodolite\nhit a jutting cliff-ledge and exploded like a shell; the books,\ninkstands, paint-boxes, compasses, and rulers showed for a few seconds\nlike a swarm of bees.  Then they vanished; and, though Kim, hanging\nhalf out of the window, strained his young ears, never a sound came up\nfrom the gulf.\n\n'Five hundred--a thousand rupees could not buy them,' he thought\nsorrowfully.  'It was verree wasteful, but I have all their other\nstuff--everything they did--I hope.  Now how the deuce am I to tell\nHurree Babu, and whatt the deuce am I to do?  And my old man is sick. I\nmust tie up the letters in oilskin.  That is something to do\nfirst--else they will get all sweated ...  And I am all alone!'  He\nbound them into a neat packet, swedging down the stiff, sticky oilskin\nat the comers, for his roving life had made him as methodical as an old\nhunter in matters of the road.  Then with double care he packed away\nthe books at the bottom of the food-bag.\n\nThe woman rapped at the door.\n\n'But thou hast made no charm,' she said, looking about.\n\n'There is no need.'  Kim had completely overlooked the necessity for a\nlittle patter-talk.  The woman laughed at his confusion irreverently.\n\n'None--for thee.  Thou canst cast a spell by the mere winking of an\neye.  But think of us poor people when thou art gone.  They were all\ntoo drunk last night to hear a woman.  Thou art not drunk?'\n\n'I am a priest.'  Kim had recovered himself, and, the woman being aught\nbut unlovely, thought best to stand on his office.\n\n'I warned them that the Sahibs will be angry and will make an\ninquisition and a report to the Rajah.  There is also the Babu with\nthem.  Clerks have long tongues.'\n\n'Is that all thy trouble?'  The plan rose fully formed in Kim's mind,\nand he smiled ravishingly.\n\n'Not all,' quoth the woman, putting out a hard brown hand all covered\nwith turquoises set in silver.\n\n'I can finish that in a breath,' he went on quickly.  'The Babu is the\nvery hakim (thou hast heard of him?) who was wandering among the hills\nby Ziglaur.  I know him.'\n\n'He will tell for the sake of a reward.  Sahibs cannot distinguish one\nhillman from another, but Babus have eyes for men--and women.'\n\n'Carry a word to him from me.'\n\n'There is nothing I would not do for thee.'\n\nHe accepted the compliment calmly, as men must in lands where women\nmake the love, tore a leaf from a note-book, and with a patent\nindelible pencil wrote in gross Shikast--the script that bad little\nboys use when they write dirt on walls:  'I have everything that they\nhave written:  their pictures of the country, and many letters.\nEspecially the murasla.  Tell me what to do.  I am at\nShamlegh-under-the-Snow.  The old man is sick.'\n\n'Take this to him.  It will altogether shut his mouth.  He cannot have\ngone far.'\n\n'Indeed no.  They are still in the forest across the spur.  Our\nchildren went to watch them when the light came, and have cried the\nnews as they moved.'\n\nKim looked his astonishment; but from the edge of the sheep-pasture\nfloated a shrill, kite-like trill.  A child tending cattle had picked\nit up from a brother or sister on the far side of the slope that\ncommanded Chini valley.\n\n'My husbands are also out there gathering wood.'  She drew a handful of\nwalnuts from her bosom, split one neatly, and began to eat.  Kim\naffected blank ignorance.\n\n'Dost thou not know the meaning of the walnut--priest?'  she said\ncoyly, and handed him the half-shells.\n\n'Well thought of.'  He slipped the piece of paper between them quickly.\n'Hast thou a little wax to close them on this letter?'\n\nThe woman sighed aloud, and Kim relented.\n\n'There is no payment till service has been rendered.  Carry this to the\nBabu, and say it was sent by the Son of the Charm.'\n\n'Ai!  Truly!  Truly!  By a magician--who is like a Sahib.'\n\n'Nay, a Son of the Charm:  and ask if there be any answer.'\n\n'But if he offer a rudeness?  I--I am afraid.'\n\nKim laughed.  'He is, I have no doubt, very tired and very hungry. The\nHills make cold bedfellows.  Hai, my'--it was on the tip of his tongue\nto say Mother, but he turned it to Sister--'thou art a wise and witty\nwoman.  By this time all the villages know what has befallen the\nSahibs--eh?'\n\n'True.  News was at Ziglaur by midnight, and by tomorrow should be at\nKotgarh.  The villages are both afraid and angry.'\n\n'No need.  Tell the villages to feed the Sahibs and pass them on, in\npeace.  We must get them quietly away from our valleys.  To steal is\none thing--to kill another.  The Babu will understand, and there will\nbe no after-complaints.  Be swift.  I must tend my master when he\nwakes.'\n\n'So be it.  After service--thou hast said?--comes the reward.  I am the\nWoman of Shamlegh, and I hold from the Rajah.  I am no common bearer of\nbabes.  Shamlegh is thine:  hoof and horn and hide, milk and butter.\nTake or leave.'\n\nShe turned resolutely uphill, her silver necklaces clicking on her\nbroad breast, to meet the morning sun fifteen hundred feet above them.\nThis time Kim thought in the vernacular as he waxed down the oilskin\nedges of the packets.\n\n'How can a man follow the Way or the Great Game when he is so--always\npestered by women?  There was that girl at Akrola of the Ford; and\nthere was the scullion's wife behind the dovecot--not counting the\nothers--and now comes this one!  When I was a child it was well enough,\nbut now I am a man and they will not regard me as a man. Walnuts,\nindeed!  Ho!  ho!  It is almonds in the Plains!'\n\nHe went out to levy on the village--not with a begging-bowl, which\nmight do for down-country, but in the manner of a prince.  Shamlegh's\nsummer population is only three families--four women and eight or nine\nmen.  They were all full of tinned meats and mixed drinks, from\nammoniated quinine to white vodka, for they had taken their full share\nin the overnight loot.  The neat Continental tents had been cut up and\nshared long ago, and there were patent aluminium saucepans abroad.\n\nBut they considered the lama's presence a perfect safeguard against all\nconsequences, and impenitently brought Kim of their best--even to a\ndrink of chang--the barley-beer that comes from Ladakh-way. Then they\nthawed out in the sun, and sat with their legs hanging over infinite\nabysses, chattering, laughing, and smoking.  They judged India and its\nGovernment solely from their experience of wandering Sahibs who had\nemployed them or their friends as shikarris.  Kim heard tales of shots\nmissed upon ibex, serow, or markhor, by Sahibs twenty years in their\ngraves--every detail lighted from behind like twigs on tree-tops seen\nagainst lightning. They told him of their little diseases, and, more\nimportant, the diseases of their tiny, sure-footed cattle; of trips as\nfar as Kotgarh, where the strange missionaries live, and beyond even to\nmarvellous Simla, where the streets are paved with silver, and anyone,\nlook you, can get service with the Sahibs, who ride about in\ntwo-wheeled carts and spend money with a spade.  Presently, grave and\naloof, walking very heavily, the lama joined himself to the chatter\nunder the eaves, and they gave him great room.  The thin air refreshed\nhim, and he sat on the edge of precipices with the best of them, and,\nwhen talk languished, flung pebbles into the void.  Thirty miles away,\nas the eagle flies, lay the next range, seamed and channelled and\npitted with little patches of brush--forests, each a day's dark march.\nBehind the village, Shamlegh hill itself cut off all view to southward.\nIt was like sitting in a swallow's nest under the eaves of the roof of\nthe world.\n\nFrom time to time the lama stretched out his hand, and with a little\nlow-voiced prompting would point out the road to Spiti and north across\nthe Parungla.\n\n'Beyond, where the hills lie thickest, lies De-ch'en' (he meant\nHan-le'), 'the great Monastery.  s'Tag-stan-ras-ch'en built it, and of\nhim there runs this tale.'  Whereupon he told it:  a fantastic piled\nnarrative of bewitchment and miracles that set Shamlegh a-gasping.\nTurning west a little, he steered for the green hills of Kulu, and\nsought Kailung under the glaciers.  'For thither came I in the old, old\ndays.  From Leh I came, over the Baralachi.'\n\n'Yes, yes; we know it,' said the far-faring people of Shamlegh.\n\n'And I slept two nights with the priests of Kailung.  These are the\nHills of my delight!  Shadows blessed above all other shadows!  There\nmy eyes opened on this world; there my eyes were opened to this world;\nthere I found Enlightenment; and there I girt my loins for my Search.\nOut of the Hills I came--the high Hills and the strong winds.  Oh, just\nis the Wheel!'  He blessed them in detail--the great glaciers, the\nnaked rocks, the piled moraines and tumbled shale; dry upland, hidden\nsalt-lake, age-old timber and fruitful water-shot valley one after the\nother, as a dying man blesses his folk; and Kim marvelled at his\npassion.\n\n'Yes--yes.  There is no place like our Hills,' said the people of\nShamlegh.  And they fell to wondering how a man could live in the hot\nterrible Plains where the cattle run as big as elephants, unfit to\nplough on a hillside; where village touches village, they had heard,\nfor a hundred miles; where folk went about stealing in gangs, and what\nthe robbers spared the Police carried utterly away.\n\nSo the still forenoon wore through, and at the end of it Kim's\nmessenger dropped from the steep pasture as unbreathed as when she had\nset out.\n\n'I sent a word to the hakim,' Kim explained, while she made reverence.\n\n'He joined himself to the idolaters?  Nay, I remember he did a healing\nupon one of them.  He has acquired merit, though the healed employed\nhis strength for evil.  Just is the Wheel!  What of the hakim?'\n\n'I feared that thou hadst been bruised and--and I knew he was wise.'\nKim took the waxed walnut-shell and read in English on the back of his\nnote:  Your favour received.  Cannot get away from present company at\npresent, but shall take them into Simla.  After which, hope to rejoin\nyou.  Inexpedient to follow angry gentlemen.  Return by same road you\ncame, and will overtake.  Highly gratified about correspondence due to\nmy forethought.  'He says, Holy One, that he will escape from the\nidolaters, and will return to us.  Shall we wait awhile at Shamlegh,\nthen?'\n\nThe lama looked long and lovingly upon the hills and shook his head.\n\n'That may not be, chela.  From my bones outward I do desire it, but it\nis forbidden.  I have seen the Cause of Things.'\n\n'Why?  When the Hills give thee back thy strength day by day? Remember\nwe were weak and fainting down below there in the Doon.'\n\n'I became strong to do evil and to forget.  A brawler and a\nswashbuckler upon the hillsides was I.' Kim bit back a smile.  'Just\nand perfect is the Wheel, swerving not a hair.  When I was a man--a\nlong time ago--I did pilgrimage to Guru Ch'wan among the poplars' (he\npointed Bhotanwards), 'where they keep the Sacred Horse.'\n\n'Quiet, be quiet!'  said Shamlegh, all arow.  'He speaks of\nJam-lin-nin-k'or, the Horse That Can Go Round The World In a Day.'\n\n'I speak to my chela only,' said the lama, in gentle reproof, and they\nscattered like frost on south eaves of a morning.  'I did not seek\ntruth in those days, but the talk of doctrine.  All illusion!  I drank\nthe beer and ate the bread of Guru Ch'wan.  Next day one said: \"We go\nout to fight Sangor Gutok down the valley to discover\" (mark again how\nLust is tied to Anger!) \"which Abbot shall bear rule in the valley and\ntake the profit of the prayers they print at Sangor Gutok.\"  I went,\nand we fought a day.'\n\n'But how, Holy One?'\n\n'With our long pencases as I could have shown ...  I say, we fought\nunder the poplars, both Abbots and all the monks, and one laid open my\nforehead to the bone.  See!'  He tilted back his cap and showed a\npuckered silvery scar.  'Just and perfect is the Wheel! Yesterday the\nscar itched, and after fifty years I recalled how it was dealt and the\nface of him who dealt it; dwelling a little in illusion.  Followed that\nwhich thou didst see--strife and stupidity. Just is the Wheel!  The\nidolater's blow fell upon the scar.  Then I was shaken in my soul:  my\nsoul was darkened, and the boat of my soul rocked upon the waters of\nillusion.  Not till I came to Shamlegh could I meditate upon the Cause\nof Things, or trace the running grass-roots of Evil.  I strove all the\nlong night.'\n\n'But, Holy One, thou art innocent of all evil.  May I be thy sacrifice!'\n\nKim was genuinely distressed at the old man's sorrow, and Mahbub Ali's\nphrase slipped out unawares.\n\n'In the dawn,' the lama went on more gravely, ready rosary clicking\nbetween the slow sentences, 'came enlightenment.  It is here ...  I am\nan old man ...  hill-bred, hill-fed, never to sit down among my Hills.\nThree years I travelled through Hind, but--can earth be stronger than\nMother Earth?  My stupid body yearned to the Hills and the snows of the\nHills, from below there.  I said, and it is true, my Search is sure.\nSo, at the Kulu woman's house I turned hillward, over-persuaded by\nmyself.  There is no blame to the hakim.  He--following\nDesire--foretold that the Hills would make me strong. They strengthened\nme to do evil, to forget my Search.  I delighted in life and the lust\nof life.  I desired strong slopes to climb.  I cast about to find them.\nI measured the strength of my body, which is evil, against the high\nHills, I made a mock of thee when thy breath came short under Jamnotri.\nI jested when thou wouldst not face the snow of the pass.'\n\n'But what harm?  I was afraid.  It was just.  I am not a hillman; and I\nloved thee for thy new strength.'\n\n'More than once I remember'--he rested his cheek dolefully on his\nhand--'I sought thy praise and the hakim's for the mere strength of my\nlegs.  Thus evil followed evil till the cup was full.  Just is the\nWheel!  All Hind for three years did me all honour.  From the Fountain\nof Wisdom in the Wonder House to'--he smiled--'a little child playing\nby a big gun--the world prepared my road.  And why?'\n\n'Because we loved thee.  It is only the fever of the blow.  I myself am\nstill sick and shaken.'\n\n'No!  It was because I was upon the Way--tuned as are si-nen [cymbals]\nto the purpose of the Law.  I departed from that ordinance. The tune\nwas broken:  followed the punishment.  In my own Hills, on the edge of\nmy own country, in the very place of my evil desire, comes the\nbuffet--here!'  (He touched his brow.) 'As a novice is beaten when he\nmisplaces the cups, so am I beaten, who was Abbot of Such-zen.  No\nword, look you, but a blow, chela.'\n\n'But the Sahibs did not know thee, Holy One?'\n\n'We were well matched.  Ignorance and Lust met Ignorance and Lust upon\nthe road, and they begat Anger.  The blow was a sign to me, who am no\nbetter than a strayed yak, that my place is not here.  Who can read the\nCause of an act is halfway to Freedom!  \"Back to the path,\" says the\nBlow.  \"The Hills are not for thee.  Thou canst not choose Freedom and\ngo in bondage to the delight of life.\"'\n\n'Would we had never met that cursed Russian!'\n\n'Our Lord Himself cannot make the Wheel swing backward.  And for my\nmerit that I had acquired I gain yet another sign.'  He put his hand in\nhis bosom, and drew forth the Wheel of Life.  'Look!  I considered this\nafter I had meditated.  There remains untorn by the idolater no more\nthan the breadth of my fingernail.'\n\n'I see.'\n\n'So much, then, is the span of my life in this body.  I have served the\nWheel all my days.  Now the Wheel serves me.  But for the merit I have\nacquired in guiding thee upon the Way, there would have been added to\nme yet another life ere I had found my River.  Is it plain, chela?'\n\nKim stared at the brutally disfigured chart.  From left to right\ndiagonally the rent ran--from the Eleventh House where Desire gives\nbirth to the Child (as it is drawn by Tibetans)--across the human and\nanimal worlds, to the Fifth House--the empty House of the Senses.  The\nlogic was unanswerable.\n\n'Before our Lord won Enlightenment'--the lama folded all away with\nreverence--'He was tempted.  I too have been tempted, but it is\nfinished.  The Arrow fell in the Plains--not in the Hills. Therefore,\nwhat make we here?'\n\n'Shall we at least wait for the hakim?'\n\n'I know how long I shall live in this body.  What can a hakim do?'\n\n'But thou art all sick and shaken.  Thou canst not walk.'\n\n'How can I be sick if I see Freedom?'  He rose unsteadily to his feet.\n\n'Then I must get food from the village.  Oh, the weary Road!'  Kim felt\nthat he too needed rest.\n\n'That is lawful.  Let us eat and go.  The Arrow fell in the Plains ...\nbut I yielded to Desire.  Make ready, chela.'\n\nKim turned to the woman with the turquoise headgear who had been idly\npitching pebbles over the cliff.  She smiled very kindly.\n\n'I found him like a strayed buffalo in a cornfield--the Babu; snorting\nand sneezing with cold.  He was so hungry that he forgot his dignity\nand gave me sweet words.  The Sahibs have nothing.'  She flung out an\nempty palm.  'One is very sick about the stomach.  Thy work?'\n\nKim nodded, with a bright eye.\n\n'I spoke to the Bengali first--and to the people of a near-by village\nafter.  The Sahibs will be given food as they need it--nor will the\npeople ask money.  The plunder is already distributed.  The Babu makes\nlying speeches to the Sahibs.  Why does he not leave them?'\n\n'Out of the greatness of his heart.'\n\n'Was never a Bengali yet had one bigger than a dried walnut.  But it is\nno matter ...  Now as to walnuts.  After service comes reward.  I have\nsaid the village is thine.'\n\n'It is my loss,' Kim began.  'Even now I had planned desirable things\nin my heart which'--there is no need to go through the compliments\nproper to these occasions.  He sighed deeply ...  'But my master, led\nby a vision--'\n\n'Huh!  What can old eyes see except a full begging-bowl?'\n\n'--turns from this village to the Plains again.'\n\n'Bid him stay.'\n\nKim shook his head.  'I know my Holy One, and his rage if he be\ncrossed,' he replied impressively.  'His curses shake the Hills.'\n\n'Pity they did not save him from a broken head!  I heard that thou wast\nthe tiger-hearted one who smote the Sahib.  Let him dream a little\nlonger.  Stay!'\n\n'Hillwoman,' said Kim, with austerity that could not harden the\noutlines of his young oval face, 'these matters are too high for thee.'\n\n'The Gods be good to us!  Since when have men and women been other than\nmen and women?'\n\n'A priest is a priest.  He says he will go upon this hour.  I am his\nchela, and I go with him.  We need food for the Road.  He is an\nhonoured guest in all the villages, but'--he broke into a pure boy's\ngrin--'the food here is good.  Give me some.'\n\n'What if I do not give it thee?  I am the woman of this village.'\n\n'Then I curse thee--a little--not greatly, but enough to remember.'  He\ncould not help smiling.\n\n'Thou hast cursed me already by the down-dropped eyelash and the\nuplifted chin.  Curses?  What should I care for mere words?'  She\nclenched her hands upon her bosom ...  'But I would not have thee to go\nin anger, thinking hardly of me--a gatherer of cow-dung and grass at\nShamlegh, but still a woman of substance.'\n\n'I think nothing,' said Kim, 'but that I am grieved to go, for I am\nvery weary; and that we need food.  Here is the bag.'\n\nThe woman snatched it angrily.  'I was foolish,' said she.  'Who is thy\nwoman in the Plains?  Fair or black?  I was fair once.  Laughest thou?\nOnce, long ago, if thou canst believe, a Sahib looked on me with\nfavour.  Once, long ago, I wore European clothes at the Mission-house\nyonder.'  She pointed towards Kotgarh.  'Once, long ago.  I was\nKer-lis-ti-an and spoke English--as the Sahibs speak it.  Yes.  My\nSahib said he would return and wed me--yes, wed me.  He went away--I\nhad nursed him when he was sick--but he never returned.  Then I saw\nthat the Gods of the Kerlistians lied, and I went back to my own people\n...  I have never set eyes on a Sahib since.  (Do not laugh at me.  The\nfit is past, little priestling.) Thy face and thy walk and thy fashion\nof speech put me in mind of my Sahib, though thou art only a wandering\nmendicant to whom I give a dole.  Curse me?  Thou canst neither curse\nnor bless!'  She set her hands on her hips and laughed bitterly.  'Thy\nGods are lies; thy works are lies; thy words are lies.  There are no\nGods under all the Heavens.  I know it ...  But for awhile I thought it\nwas my Sahib come back, and he was my God. Yes, once I made music on a\npianno in the Mission-house at Kotgarh. Now I give alms to priests who\nare heatthen.'  She wound up with the English word, and tied the mouth\nof the brimming bag.\n\n'I wait for thee, chela,' said the lama, leaning against the door-post.\n\nThe woman swept the tall figure with her eyes.  'He walk!  He cannot\ncover half a mile.  Whither would old bones go?'\n\nAt this Kim, already perplexed by the lama's collapse and foreseeing\nthe weight of the bag, fairly lost his temper.\n\n'What is it to thee, woman of ill-omen, where he goes?'\n\n'Nothing--but something to thee, priest with a Sahib's face.  Wilt thou\ncarry him on thy shoulders?'\n\n'I go to the Plains.  None must hinder my return.  I have wrestled with\nmy soul till I am strengthless.  The stupid body is spent, and we are\nfar from the Plains.'\n\n'Behold!'  she said simply, and drew aside to let Kim see his own utter\nhelplessness.  'Curse me.  Maybe it will give him strength.  Make a\ncharm!  Call on thy great God.  Thou art a priest.'  She turned away.\n\nThe lama had squatted limply, still holding by the door-post.  One\ncannot strike down an old man that he recovers again like a boy in the\nnight.  Weakness bowed him to the earth, but his eyes that hung on Kim\nwere alive and imploring.\n\n'It is all well,' said Kim.  'It is the thin air that weakens thee. In\na little while we go!  It is the mountain-sickness.  I too am a little\nsick at stomach,'--and he knelt and comforted with such poor words as\ncame first to his lips.  Then the woman returned, more erect than ever.\n\n'Thy Gods useless, heh?  Try mine.  I am the Woman of Shamlegh.'  She\nhailed hoarsely, and there came out of a cow-pen her two husbands and\nthree others with a dooli, the rude native litter of the Hills, that\nthey use for carrying the sick and for visits of state.  'These\ncattle'--she did not condescend to look at them--'are thine for so long\nas thou shalt need.'\n\n'But we will not go Simla-way.  We will not go near the Sahibs,' cried\nthe first husband.\n\n'They will not run away as the others did, nor will they steal baggage.\nTwo I know for weaklings.  Stand to the rear-pole, Sonoo and Taree.'\nThey obeyed swiftly.  'Lower now, and lift in that holy man. I will see\nto the village and your virtuous wives till ye return.'\n\n'When will that be?'\n\n'Ask the priests.  Do not pester me.  Lay the food-bag at the foot, it\nbalances better so.'\n\n'Oh, Holy One, thy Hills are kinder than our Plains!'  cried Kim,\nrelieved, as the lama tottered to the litter.  'It is a very king's\nbed--a place of honour and ease.  And we owe it to--'\n\n'A woman of ill-omen.  I need thy blessings as much as I do thy curses.\nIt is my order and none of thine.  Lift and away!  Here!  Hast thou\nmoney for the road?'\n\nShe beckoned Kim to her hut, and stooped above a battered English\ncash-box under her cot.\n\n'I do not need anything,' said Kim, angered where he should have been\ngrateful.  'I am already rudely loaded with favours.'\n\nShe looked up with a curious smile and laid a hand on his shoulder. 'At\nleast, thank me.  I am foul-faced and a hillwoman, but, as thy talk\ngoes, I have acquired merit.  Shall I show thee how the Sahibs render\nthanks?'  and her hard eyes softened.\n\n'I am but a wandering priest,' said Kim, his eyes lighting in answer.\n'Thou needest neither my blessings nor my curses.'\n\n'Nay.  But for one little moment--thou canst overtake the dooli in ten\nstrides--if thou wast a Sahib, shall I show thee what thou wouldst do?'\n\n'How if I guess, though?'  said Kim, and putting his arm round her\nwaist, he kissed her on the cheek, adding in English:  'Thank you\nverree much, my dear.'\n\nKissing is practically unknown among Asiatics, which may have been the\nreason that she leaned back with wide-open eyes and a face of panic.\n\n'Next time,' Kim went on, 'you must not be so sure of your heatthen\npriests.  Now I say good-bye.'  He held out his hand English-fashion.\nShe took it mechanically.  'Good-bye, my dear.'\n\n'Good-bye, and--and'--she was remembering her English words one by\none--'you will come back again?  Good-bye, and--thee God bless you.'\n\nHalf an hour later, as the creaking litter jolted up the hill path that\nleads south-easterly from Shamlegh, Kim saw a tiny figure at the hut\ndoor waving a white rag.\n\n'She has acquired merit beyond all others,' said the lama.  'For to set\na man upon the way to Freedom is half as great as though she had\nherself found it.'\n\n'Umm,' said Kim thoughtfully, considering the past.  'It may be that I\nhave acquired merit also ...  At least she did not treat me like a\nchild.'  He hitched the front of his robe, where lay the slab of\ndocuments and maps, re-stowed the precious food-bag at the lama's feet,\nlaid his hand on the litter's edge, and buckled down to the slow pace\nof the grunting husbands.\n\n'These also acquire merit,' said the lama after three miles.\n\n'More than that, they shall be paid in silver,' quoth Kim.  The Woman\nof Shamlegh had given it to him; and it was only fair, he argued, that\nher men should earn it back again.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 15\n\n\n  I'd not give room for an Emperor--\n  I'd hold my road for a King.\n  To the Triple Crown I'd not bow down--\n  But this is a different thing!\n  I'll not fight with the Powers of Air--\n  Sentry, pass him through!\n  Drawbridge let fall--He's the Lord of us all--\n  The Dreamer whose dream came true!\n\n  The Siege of the Fairies.\n\n\nTwo hundred miles north of Chini, on the blue shale of Ladakh, lies\nYankling Sahib, the merry-minded man, spy-glassing wrathfully across\nthe ridges for some sign of his pet tracker--a man from Ao-chung. But\nthat renegade, with a new Mannlicher rifle and two hundred cartridges,\nis elsewhere, shooting musk-deer for the market, and Yankling Sahib\nwill learn next season how very ill he has been.\n\nUp the valleys of Bushahr--the far-beholding eagles of the Himalayas\nswerve at his new blue-and-white gored umbrella--hurries a Bengali,\nonce fat and well-looking, now lean and weather-worn.  He has received\nthe thanks of two foreigners of distinction, piloted not unskilfully to\nMashobra tunnel, which leads to the great and gay capital of India.  It\nwas not his fault that, blanketed by wet mists, he conveyed them past\nthe telegraph-station and European colony of Kotgarh.  It was not his\nfault, but that of the Gods, of whom he discoursed so engagingly, that\nhe led them into the borders of Nahan, where the Rahah of that State\nmistook them for deserting British soldiery.  Hurree Babu explained the\ngreatness and glory, in their own country, of his companions, till the\ndrowsy kinglet smiled.  He explained it to everyone who asked--many\ntimes--aloud--variously.  He begged food, arranged accommodation,\nproved a skilful leech for an injury of the groin--such a blow as one\nmay receive rolling down a rock-covered hillside in the dark--and in\nall things indispensable.  The reason of his friendliness did him\ncredit.  With millions of fellow-serfs, he had learned to look upon\nRussia as the great deliverer from the North.  He was a fearful man.\nHe had been afraid that he could not save his illustrious employers\nfrom the anger of an excited peasantry.  He himself would just as lief\nhit a holy man as not, but ...  He was deeply grateful and sincerely\nrejoiced that he had done his 'little possible' towards bringing their\nventure to--barring the lost baggage--a successful issue, he had\nforgotten the blows; denied that any blows had been dealt that unseemly\nfirst night under the pines.  He asked neither pension nor retaining\nfee, but, if they deemed him worthy, would they write him a\ntestimonial?  It might be useful to him later, if others, their\nfriends, came over the Passes.  He begged them to remember him in their\nfuture greatnesses, for he 'opined subtly' that he, even he, Mohendro\nLal Dutt, MA of Calcutta, had 'done the State some service'.\n\nThey gave him a certificate praising his courtesy, helpfulness, and\nunerring skill as a guide.  He put it in his waist-belt and sobbed with\nemotion; they had endured so many dangers together.  He led them at\nhigh noon along crowded Simla Mall to the Alliance Bank of Simla, where\nthey wished to establish their identity.  Thence he vanished like a\ndawn-cloud on Jakko.\n\nBehold him, too fine-drawn to sweat, too pressed to vaunt the drugs in\nhis little brass-bound box, ascending Shamlegh slope, a just man made\nperfect.  Watch him, all Babudom laid aside, smoking at noon on a cot,\nwhile a woman with turquoise-studded headgear points south-easterly\nacross the bare grass.  Litters, she says, do not travel as fast as\nsingle men, but his birds should now be in the Plains.  The holy man\nwould not stay though Lispeth pressed him.  The Babu groans heavily,\ngirds up his huge loins, and is off again.  He does not care to travel\nafter dusk; but his days' marches--there is none to enter them in a\nbook--would astonish folk who mock at his race.  Kindly villagers,\nremembering the Dacca drug-vendor of two months ago, give him shelter\nagainst evil spirits of the wood.  He dreams of Bengali Gods,\nUniversity text-books of education, and the Royal Society, London,\nEngland.  Next dawn the bobbing blue-and-white umbrella goes forward.\n\nOn the edge of the Doon, Mussoorie well behind them and the Plains\nspread out in golden dust before, rests a worn litter in which--all the\nHills know it--lies a sick lama who seeks a River for his healing.\nVillages have almost come to blows over the honour of bearing it, for\nnot only has the lama given them blessings, but his disciple good\nmoney--full one-third Sahibs' prices.  Twelve miles a day has the dooli\ntravelled, as the greasy, rubbed pole-ends show, and by roads that few\nSahibs use.  Over the Nilang Pass in storm when the driven snow-dust\nfilled every fold of the impassive lama's drapery; between the black\nhorns of Raieng where they heard the whistle of the wild goats through\nthe clouds; pitching and strained on the shale below; hard-held between\nshoulder and clenched jaw when they rounded the hideous curves of the\nCut Road under Bhagirati; swinging and creaking to the steady jog-trot\nof the descent into the Valley of the Waters; pressed along the steamy\nlevels of that locked valley; up, up and out again, to meet the roaring\ngusts off Kedarnath; set down of mid-days in the dun gloom of kindly\noak-forests; passed from village to village in dawn-chill, when even\ndevotees may be forgiven for swearing at impatient holy men; or by\ntorchlight, when the least fearful think of ghosts--the dooli has\nreached her last stage.  The little hill-folk sweat in the modified\nheat of the lower Siwaliks, and gather round the priests for their\nblessing and their wage.\n\n'Ye have acquired merit,' says the lama.  'Merit greater than your\nknowing.  And ye will return to the Hills,' he sighs.\n\n'Surely.  The high Hills as soon as may be.'  The bearer rubs his\nshoulder, drinks water, spits it out again, and readjusts his grass\nsandal.  Kim--his face is drawn and tired--pays very small silver from\nhis belt, heaves out the food-bag, crams an oilskin packet--they are\nholy writings--into his bosom, and helps the lama to his feet.  The\npeace has come again into the old man's eyes, and he does not look for\nthe hills to fall down and crush him as he did that terrible night when\nthey were delayed by the flooded river.\n\nThe men pick up the dooli and swing out of sight between the scrub\nclumps.\n\nThe lama raises a hand toward the rampart of the Himalayas.  'Not with\nyou, O blessed among all hills, fell the Arrow of Our Lord!  And never\nshall I breathe your airs again!'\n\n'But thou art ten times the stronger man in this good air,' says Kim,\nfor to his wearied soul appeal the well-cropped, kindly Plains. 'Here,\nor hereabouts, fell the Arrow, yes.  We will go very softly, perhaps, a\nkoss a day, for the Search is sure.  But the bag weighs heavy.'\n\n'Ay, our Search is sure.  I have come out of great temptation.'\n\nIt was never more than a couple of miles a day now, and Kim's shoulders\nbore all the weight of it--the burden of an old man, the burden of the\nheavy food-bag with the locked books, the load of the writings on his\nheart, and the details of the daily routine.  He begged in the dawn,\nset blankets for the lama's meditation, held the weary head on his lap\nthrough the noonday heats, fanning away the flies till his wrists\nached, begged again in the evenings, and rubbed the lama's feet, who\nrewarded him with promise of Freedom--today, tomorrow, or, at furthest,\nthe next day.\n\n'Never was such a chela.  I doubt at times whether Ananda more\nfaithfully nursed Our Lord.  And thou art a Sahib?  When I was a man--a\nlong time ago--I forgot that.  Now I look upon thee often, and every\ntime I remember that thou art a Sahib.  It is strange.'\n\n'Thou hast said there is neither black nor white.  Why plague me with\nthis talk, Holy One?  Let me rub the other foot.  It vexes me.  I am\nnot a Sahib.  I am thy chela, and my head is heavy on my shoulders.'\n\n'Patience a little!  We reach Freedom together.  Then thou and I, upon\nthe far bank of the River, will look back upon our lives as in the\nHills we saw our days' marches laid out behind us.  Perhaps I was once\na Sahib.'\n\n'Was never a Sahib like thee, I swear it.'\n\n'I am certain the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House was in past\nlife a very wise Abbot.  But even his spectacles do not make my eyes\nsee.  There fall shadows when I would look steadily.  No matter--we\nknow the tricks of the poor stupid carcass--shadow changing to another\nshadow.  I am bound by the illusion of Time and Space.  How far came we\ntoday in the flesh?'\n\n'Perhaps half a koss.'  (Three quarters of a mile, and it was a weary\nmarch.)\n\n'Half a koss.  Ha!  I went ten thousand thousand in the spirit.  How,\nwe are all lapped and swathed and swaddled in these senseless things.'\nHe looked at his thin blue-veined hand that found the beads so heavy.\n'Chela, hast thou never a wish to leave me?'\n\nKim thought of the oilskin packet and the books in the food-bag.  If\nsomeone duly authorized would only take delivery of them the Great Game\nmight play itself for aught he then cared.  He was tired and hot in his\nhead, and a cough that came from the stomach worried him.\n\n'No.'  he said almost sternly.  'I am not a dog or a snake to bite when\nI have learned to love.'\n\n'Thou art too tender towards me.'\n\n'Not that either.  I have moved in one matter without consulting thee.\nI have sent a message to the Kulu woman by that woman who gave us the\ngoat's milk this morn, saying that thou wast a little feeble and\nwouldst need a litter.  I beat myself in my mind that I did not do it\nwhen we entered the Doon.  We stay in this place till the litter\nreturns.'\n\n'I am content.  She is a woman with a heart of gold, as thou sayest,\nbut a talker--something of a talker.'\n\n'She will not weary thee.  I have looked to that also.  Holy One, my\nheart is very heavy for my many carelessnesses towards thee.'  An\nhysterical catch rose in his throat.  'I have walked thee too far:  I\nhave not picked good food always for thee; I have not considered the\nheat; I have talked to people on the road and left thee alone ...  I\nhave--I have ...  Hai mai!  But I love thee ...  and it is all too late\n...  I was a child ...  Oh, why was I not a man?  ...' Overborne by\nstrain, fatigue, and the weight beyond his years, Kim broke down and\nsobbed at the lama's feet.\n\n'What a to-do is here!'  said the old man gently.  'Thou hast never\nstepped a hair's breadth from the Way of Obedience.  Neglect me? Child,\nI have lived on thy strength as an old tree lives on the lime of a new\nwall.  Day by day, since Shamlegh down, I have stolen strength from\nthee.  Therefore, not through any sin of thine, art thou weakened.  It\nis the Body--the silly, stupid Body--that speaks now.  Not the assured\nSoul.  Be comforted!  Know at least the devils that thou fightest.\nThey are earth-born--children of illusion.  We will go to the woman\nfrom Kulu.  She shall acquire merit in housing us, and specially in\ntending me.  Thou shalt run free till strength returns.  I had\nforgotten the stupid Body.  If there be any blame, I bear it.  But we\nare too close to the Gates of Deliverance to weigh blame.  I could\npraise thee, but what need?  In a little--in a very little--we shall\nsit beyond all needs.'\n\nAnd so he petted and comforted Kim with wise saws and grave texts on\nthat little-understood beast, our Body, who, being but a delusion,\ninsists on posing as the Soul, to the darkening of the Way, and the\nimmense multiplication of unnecessary devils.\n\n'Hai!  hai!  Let us talk of the woman from Kulu.  Think you she will\nask another charm for her grandsons?  When I was a young man, a very\nlong time ago, I was plagued with these vapours--and some others--and I\nwent to an Abbot--a very holy man and a seeker after truth, though then\nI knew it not.  Sit up and listen, child of my soul!  My tale was told.\nSaid he to me, \"Chela, know this.  There are many lies in the world,\nand not a few liars, but there are no liars like our bodies, except it\nbe the sensations of our bodies.\"  Considering this I was comforted,\nand of his great favour he suffered me to drink tea In his presence.\nSuffer me now to drink tea, for I am thirsty.'\n\nWith a laugh across his tears, Kim kissed the lama's feet, and set\nabout the tea-making.\n\n'Thou leanest on me in the body, Holy One, but I lean on thee for some\nother things.  Dost know it?'\n\n'I have guessed maybe,' and the lama's eyes twinkled.  'We must change\nthat.'\n\nSo, when with scufflings and scrapings and a hot air of importance,\npaddled up nothing less than the Sahiba's pet palanquin sent twenty\nmiles, with that same grizzled old Oorya servant in charge, and when\nthey reached the disorderly order of the long white rambling house\nbehind Saharunpore, the lama took his own measures.\n\nSaid the Sahiba cheerily from an upper window, after compliments: 'What\nis the good of an old woman's advice to an old man?  I told thee--I\ntold thee, Holy One, to keep an eye upon the chela.  How didst thou do\nit?  Never answer me!  I know.  He has been running among the women.\nLook at his eyes--hollow and sunk--and the Betraying Line from the nose\ndown!  He has been sifted out!  Fie!  Fie!  And a priest, too!'\n\nKim looked up, over-weary to smile, shaking his head in denial.\n\n'Do not jest,' said the lama.  'That time is done.  We are here upon\ngreat matters.  A sickness of soul took me in the Hills, and him a\nsickness of the body.  Since then I have lived upon his\nstrength--eating him.'\n\n'Children together--young and old,' she sniffed, but forbore to make\nany new jokes.  'May this present hospitality restore ye!  Hold awhile\nand I will come to gossip of the high good Hills.'\n\nAt evening time--her son-in-law was returned, so she did not need to go\non inspection round the farm--she won to the meat of the matter,\nexplained low-voicedly by the lama.  The two old heads nodded wisely\ntogether.  Kim had reeled to a room with a cot in it, and was dozing\nsoddenly.  The lama had forbidden him to set blankets or get food.\n\n'I know--I know.  Who but I?' she cackled.  'We who go down to the\nburning-ghats clutch at the hands of those coming up from the River of\nLife with full water-jars--yes, brimming water-jars.  I did the boy\nwrong.  He lent thee his strength?  It is true that the old eat the\nyoung daily.  Stands now we must restore him.'\n\n'Thou hast many times acquired merit--'\n\n'My merit.  What is it?  Old bag of bones making curries for men who do\nnot ask \"Who cooked this?\"  Now if it were stored up for my grandson--'\n\n'He that had the belly-pain?'\n\n'To think the Holy One remembers that!  I must tell his mother.  It is\nmost singular honour!  \"He that had the belly-pain\"--straightway the\nHoly One remembered.  She will be proud.'\n\n'My chela is to me as is a son to the unenlightened.'\n\n'Say grandson, rather.  Mothers have not the wisdom of our years.  If a\nchild cries they say the heavens are falling.  Now a grandmother is far\nenough separated from the pain of bearing and the pleasure of giving\nthe breast to consider whether a cry is wickedness pure or the wind.\nAnd since thou speakest once again of wind, when last the Holy One was\nhere, maybe I offended in pressing for charms.'\n\n'Sister,' said the lama, using that form of address a Buddhist monk may\nsometimes employ towards a nun, 'if charms comfort thee--'\n\n'They are better than ten thousand doctors.'\n\n'I say, if they comfort thee, I who was Abbot of Such-zen, will make as\nmany as thou mayest desire.  I have never seen thy face--'\n\n'That even the monkeys who steal our loquats count for again.  Hee!\nhee!'\n\n'But as he who sleeps there said,'--he nodded at the shut door of the\nguest-chamber across the forecourt--'thou hast a heart of gold... And\nhe is in the spirit my very \"grandson\" to me.'\n\n'Good!  I am the Holy One's cow.'  This was pure Hinduism, but the lama\nnever heeded.  'I am old.  I have borne sons in the body.  Oh, once I\ncould please men!  Now I can cure them.'  He heard her armlets tinkle\nas though she bared arms for action.  'I will take over the boy and\ndose him, and stuff him, and make him all whole.  Hai!  hai! We old\npeople know something yet.'\n\nWherefore when Kim, aching in every bone, opened his eyes, and would go\nto the cook-house to get his master's food, he found strong coercion\nabout him, and a veiled old figure at the door, flanked by the grizzled\nmanservant, who told him very precisely the things that he was on no\naccount to do.\n\n'Thou must have?  Thou shalt have nothing.  What?  A locked box in\nwhich to keep holy books?  Oh, that is another matter.  Heavens forbid\nI should come between a priest and his prayers!  It shall be brought,\nand thou shalt keep the key.'\n\nThey pushed the coffer under his cot, and Kim shut away Mahbub's\npistol, the oilskin packet of letters, and the locked books and\ndiaries, with a groan of relief.  For some absurd reason their weight\non his shoulders was nothing to their weight on his poor mind.  His\nneck ached under it of nights.\n\n'Thine is a sickness uncommon in youth these days:  since young folk\nhave given up tending their betters.  The remedy is sleep, and certain\ndrugs,' said the Sahiba; and he was glad to give himself up to the\nblankness that half menaced and half soothed him.\n\nShe brewed drinks, in some mysterious Asiatic equivalent to the\nstill-room--drenches that smelt pestilently and tasted worse.  She\nstood over Kim till they went down, and inquired exhaustively after\nthey had come up.  She laid a taboo upon the forecourt, and enforced it\nby means of an armed man.  It is true he was seventy odd, that his\nscabbarded sword ceased at the hilt; but he represented the authority\nof the Sahiba, and loaded wains, chattering servants, calves, dogs,\nhens, and the like, fetched a wide compass by those parts.  Best of\nall, when the body was cleared, she cut out from the mass of poor\nrelations that crowded the back of the buildings--house-hold dogs, we\nname them--a cousin's widow, skilled in what Europeans, who know\nnothing about it, call massage.  And the two of them, laying him east\nand west, that the mysterious earth-currents which thrill the clay of\nour bodies might help and not hinder, took him to pieces all one long\nafternoon--bone by bone, muscle by muscle, ligament by ligament, and\nlastly, nerve by nerve.  Kneaded to irresponsible pulp, half hypnotized\nby the perpetual flick and readjustment of the uneasy chudders that\nveiled their eyes, Kim slid ten thousand miles into slumber--thirty-six\nhours of it--sleep that soaked like rain after drought.\n\nThen she fed him, and the house spun to her clamour.  She caused fowls\nto be slain; she sent for vegetables, and the sober, slow-thinking\ngardener, nigh as old as she, sweated for it; she took spices, and\nmilk, and onion, with little fish from the brooks--anon limes for\nsherbets, fat quails from the pits, then chicken-livers upon a skewer,\nwith sliced ginger between.\n\n'I have seen something of this world,' she said over the crowded trays,\n'and there are but two sorts of women in it--those who take the\nstrength out of a man and those who put it back.  Once I was that one,\nand now I am this.  Nay--do not play the priestling with me. Mine was\nbut a jest.  If it does not hold good now, it will when thou takest the\nroad again.  Cousin,'--this to the poor relation, never wearied of\nextolling her patroness's charity--'he is getting a bloom on the skin\nof a new-curried horse.  Our work is like polishing jewels to be thrown\nto a dance-girl--eh?'\n\nKim sat up and smiled.  The terrible weakness had dropped from him like\nan old shoe.  His tongue itched for free speech again, and but a week\nback the lightest word clogged it like ashes.  The pain in his neck (he\nmust have caught it from the lama) had gone with the heavy dengue-aches\nand the evil taste in the mouth.  The two old women, a little, but not\nmuch, more careful about their veils now, clucked as merrily as the\nhens that had entered pecking through the open door.\n\n'Where is my Holy One?'  he demanded.\n\n'Hear him!  Thy Holy One is well,' she snapped viciously.  'Though that\nis none of his merit.  Knew I a charm to make him wise, I'd sell my\njewels and buy it.  To refuse good food that I cooked myself--and go\nroving into the fields for two nights on an empty belly--and to tumble\ninto a brook at the end of it--call you that holiness?  Then, when he\nhas nearly broken what thou hast left of my heart with anxiety, he\ntells me that he has acquired merit.  Oh, how like are all men!  No,\nthat was not it--he tells me that he is freed from all sin.  I could\nhave told him that before he wetted himself all over.  He is well\nnow--this happened a week ago--but burn me such holiness!  A babe of\nthree would do better.  Do not fret thyself for the Holy One.  He keeps\nboth eyes on thee when he is not wading our brooks.'\n\n'I do not remember to have seen him.  I remember that the days and\nnights passed like bars of white and black, opening and shutting.  I\nwas not sick:  I was but tired.'\n\n'A lethargy that comes by right some few score years later.  But it is\ndone now.'\n\n'Maharanee,' Kim began, but led by the look in her eye, changed it to\nthe title of plain love--'Mother, I owe my life to thee.  How shall I\nmake thanks?  Ten thousand blessings upon thy house and--'\n\n'The house be unblessed!'  (It is impossible to give exactly the old\nlady's word.) 'Thank the Gods as a priest if thou wilt, but thank me,\nif thou carest, as a son.  Heavens above!  Have I shifted thee and\nlifted thee and slapped and twisted thy ten toes to find texts flung at\nmy head?  Somewhere a mother must have borne thee to break her heart.\nWhat used thou to her--son?'\n\n'I had no mother, my mother,' said Kim.  'She died, they tell me, when\nI was young.'\n\n'Hai mai!  Then none can say I have robbed her of any right if--when\nthou takest the road again and this house is but one of a thousand used\nfor shelter and forgotten, after an easy-flung blessing.  No matter.  I\nneed no blessings, but--but--' She stamped her foot at the poor\nrelation.  'Take up the trays to the house.  What is the good of stale\nfood in the room, O woman of ill-omen?'\n\n'I ha--have borne a son in my time too, but he died,' whimpered the\nbowed sister-figure behind the chudder.  'Thou knowest he died!  I only\nwaited for the order to take away the tray.'\n\n'It is I that am the woman of ill-omen,' cried the old lady penitently.\n'We that go down to the chattris [the big umbrellas above the\nburning-ghats where the priests take their last dues] clutch hard at\nthe bearers of the chattis [water-jars--young folk full of the pride of\nlife, she meant; but the pun is clumsy].  When one cannot dance in the\nfestival one must e'en look out of the window, and grandmothering takes\nall a woman's time.  Thy master gives me all the charms I now desire\nfor my daughter's eldest, by reason--is it?--that he is wholly free\nfrom sin.  The hakim is brought very low these days.  He goes about\npoisoning my servants for lack of their betters.'\n\n'What hakim, mother?'\n\n'That very Dacca man who gave me the pill which rent me in three\npieces.  He cast up like a strayed camel a week ago, vowing that he and\nthou had been blood-brothers together up Kulu-way, and feigning great\nanxiety for thy health.  He was very thin and hungry, so I gave orders\nto have him stuffed too--him and his anxiety!'\n\n'I would see him if he is here.'\n\n'He eats five times a day, and lances boils for my hinds to save\nhimself from an apoplexy.  He is so full of anxiety for thy health that\nhe sticks to the cook-house door and stays himself with scraps. He will\nkeep.  We shall never get rid of him.'\n\n'Send him here, mother'--the twinkle returned to Kim's eye for a\nflash--'and I will try.'\n\n'I'll send him, but to chase him off is an ill turn.  At least he had\nthe sense to fish the Holy One out of the brook; thus, as the Holy One\ndid not say, acquiring merit.'\n\n'He is a very wise hakim.  Send him, mother.'\n\n'Priest praising priest?  A miracle!  If he is any friend of thine (ye\nsquabbled at your last meeting) I'll hale him here with horse-ropes\nand--and give him a caste-dinner afterwards, my son ...  Get up and see\nthe world!  This lying abed is the mother of seventy devils ... my son!\nmy son!'\n\nShe trotted forth to raise a typhoon off the cook-house, and almost on\nher shadow rolled in the Babu, robed as to the shoulders like a Roman\nemperor, jowled like Titus, bare-headed, with new patent-leather shoes,\nin highest condition of fat, exuding joy and salutations.\n\n'By Jove, Mister O'Hara, but I are jolly-glad to see you.  I will\nkindly shut the door.  It is a pity you are sick.  Are you very sick?'\n\n'The papers--the papers from the kilta.  The maps and the murasla!' He\nheld out the key impatiently; for the present need on his soul was to\nget rid of the loot.\n\n'You are quite right.  That is correct Departmental view to take.  You\nhave got everything?'\n\n'All that was handwritten in the kilta I took.  The rest I threw down\nthe hill.'  He could hear the key's grate in the lock, the sticky pull\nof the slow-rending oilskin, and a quick shuffling of papers. He had\nbeen annoyed out of all reason by the knowledge that they lay below him\nthrough the sick idle days--a burden incommunicable.  For that reason\nthe blood tingled through his body, when Hurree, skipping\nelephantinely, shook hands again.\n\n'This is fine!  This is finest!  Mister O'Hara!  you have--ha!  ha!\nswiped the whole bag of tricks--locks, stocks, and barrels.  They told\nme it was eight months' work gone up the spouts!  By Jove, how they\nbeat me!  ...  Look, here is the letter from Hilas!'  He intoned a line\nor two of Court Persian, which is the language of authorized and\nunauthorized diplomacy.  'Mister Rajah Sahib has just about put his\nfoot in the holes.  He will have to explain offeecially how the\ndeuce-an'-all he is writing love-letters to the Czar.  And they are\nvery clever maps ...  and there is three or four Prime Ministers of\nthese parts implicated by the correspondence.  By Gad, sar!  The\nBritish Government will change the succession in Hilas and Bunar, and\nnominate new heirs to the throne.  \"Trea-son most base\" ...  but you do\nnot understand?  Eh?'\n\n'Are they in thy hands?'  said Kim.  It was all he cared for.\n\n'Just you jolly-well bet yourself they are.'  He stowed the entire\ntrove about his body, as only Orientals can.  'They are going up to the\noffice, too.  The old lady thinks I am permanent fixture here, but I\nshall go away with these straight off--immediately.  Mr Lurgan will be\nproud man.  You are offeecially subordinate to me, but I shall embody\nyour name in my verbal report.  It is a pity we are not allowed written\nreports.  We Bengalis excel in thee exact science.' He tossed back the\nkey and showed the box empty.\n\n'Good.  That is good.  I was very tired.  My Holy One was sick, too.\nAnd did he fall into--'\n\n'Oah yess.  I am his good friend, I tell you.  He was behaving very\nstrange when I came down after you, and I thought perhaps he might have\nthe papers.  I followed him on his meditations, and to discuss\nethnological points also.  You see, I am verree small person here\nnowadays, in comparison with all his charms.  By Jove, O'Hara, do you\nknow, he is afflicted with infirmity of fits.  Yess, I tell you.\nCataleptic, too, if not also epileptic.  I found him in such a state\nunder a tree in articulo mortem, and he jumped up and walked into a\nbrook and he was nearly drowned but for me.  I pulled him out.'\n\n'Because I was not there!'  said Kim.  'He might have died.'\n\n'Yes, he might have died, but he is dry now, and asserts he has\nundergone transfiguration.'  The Babu tapped his forehead knowingly. 'I\ntook notes of his statements for Royal Society--in posse.  You must\nmake haste and be quite well and come back to Simla, and I will tell\nyou all my tale at Lurgan's.  It was splendid.  The bottoms of their\ntrousers were quite torn, and old Nahan Rajah, he thought they were\nEuropean soldiers deserting.'\n\n'Oh, the Russians?  How long were they with thee?'\n\n'One was a Frenchman.  Oh, days and days and days!  Now all the\nhill-people believe all Russians are all beggars.  By Jove! they had\nnot one dam'-thing that I did not get them.  And I told the common\npeople--oah, such tales and anecdotes!--I will tell you at old Lurgan's\nwhen you come up.  We will have--ah--a night out!  It is feather in\nboth our caps!  Yess, and they gave me a certificate.  That is creaming\njoke.  You should have seen them at the Alliance Bank identifying\nthemselves!  And thank Almighty God you got their papers so well!  You\ndo not laugh verree much, but you shall laugh when you are well.  Now I\nwill go straight to the railway and get out.  You shall have all sorts\nof credits for your game.  When do you come along?  We are very proud\nof you though you gave us great frights. And especially Mahbub.'\n\n'Ay, Mahbub.  And where is he?'\n\n'Selling horses in this vi-cinity, of course.'\n\n'Here!  Why?  Speak slowly.  There is a thickness in my head still.'\n\nThe Babu looked shyly down his nose.  'Well, you see, I am fearful man,\nand I do not like responsibility.  You were sick, you see, and I did\nnot know where deuce-an'-all the papers were, and if so, how many.  So\nwhen I had come down here I slipped in private wire to Mahbub--he was\nat Meerut for races--and I tell him how case stands.  He comes up with\nhis men and he consorts with the lama, and then he calls me a fool, and\nis very rude--'\n\n'But wherefore--wherefore?'\n\n'That is what I ask.  I only suggest that if anyone steals the papers I\nshould like some good strong, brave men to rob them back again. You\nsee, they are vitally important, and Mahbub Ali he did not know where\nyou were.'\n\n'Mahbub Ali to rob the Sahiba's house?  Thou art mad, Babu,' said Kim\nwith indignation.\n\n'I wanted the papers.  Suppose she had stole them?  It was only\npractical suggestion, I think.  You are not pleased, eh?'\n\nA native proverb--unquotable--showed the blackness of Kim's disapproval.\n\n'Well,'--Hurree shrugged his shoulders--'there is no accounting for\nthee taste.  Mahbub was angry too.  He has sold horses all about here,\nand he says old lady is pukka [thorough] old lady and would not\ncondescend to such ungentlemanly things.  I do not care.  I have got\nthe papers, and I was very glad of moral support from Mahbub.  I tell\nyou, I am fearful man, but, somehow or other, the more fearful I am the\nmore dam'-tight places I get into.  So I was glad you came with me to\nChini, and I am glad Mahbub was close by.  The old lady she is\nsometimes very rude to me and my beautiful pills.'\n\n'Allah be merciful!'  said Kim on his elbow, rejoicing.  'What a beast\nof wonder is a Babu!  And that man walked alone--if he did walk--with\nrobbed and angry foreigners!'\n\n'Oah, thatt was nothing, after they had done beating me; but if I lost\nthe papers it was pretty-jolly serious.  Mahbub he nearly beat me too,\nand he went and consorted with the lama no end.  I shall stick to\nethnological investigations henceforwards.  Now good-bye, Mister\nO'Hara.  I can catch 4.25 p.m.  to Umballa if I am quick.  It will be\ngood times when we all tell thee tale up at Mr Lurgan's.  I shall\nreport you offeecially better.  Good-bye, my dear fallow, and when next\nyou are under thee emotions please do not use the Mohammedan terms with\nthe Tibetan dress.'\n\nHe shook hands twice--a Babu to his boot-heels--and opened the door.\nWith the fall of the sunlight upon his still triumphant face he\nreturned to the humble Dacca quack.\n\n'He robbed them,' thought Kim, forgetting his own share in the game.\n'He tricked them.  He lied to them like a Bengali.  They give him a\nchit [a testimonial].  He makes them a mock at the risk of his life--I\nnever would have gone down to them after the pistol-shots--and then he\nsays he is a fearful man ...  And he is a fearful man.  I must get into\nthe world again.'\n\nAt first his legs bent like bad pipe-stems, and the flood and rush of\nthe sunlit air dazzled him.  He squatted by the white wall, the mind\nrummaging among the incidents of the long dooli journey, the lama's\nweaknesses, and, now that the stimulus of talk was removed, his own\nself-pity, of which, like the sick, he had great store.  The unnerved\nbrain edged away from all the outside, as a raw horse, once rowelled,\nsidles from the spur.  It was enough, amply enough, that the spoil of\nthe kilta was away--off his hands--out of his possession.  He tried to\nthink of the lama--to wonder why he had tumbled into a brook--but the\nbigness of the world, seen between the forecourt gates, swept linked\nthought aside.  Then he looked upon the trees and the broad fields,\nwith the thatched huts hidden among crops--looked with strange eyes\nunable to take up the size and proportion and use of things--stared for\na still half-hour.  All that while he felt, though he could not put it\ninto words, that his soul was out of gear with its surroundings--a\ncog-wheel unconnected with any machinery, just like the idle cog-wheel\nof a cheap Beheea sugar-crusher laid by in a corner.  The breezes\nfanned over him, the parrots shrieked at him, the noises of the\npopulated house behind--squabbles, orders, and reproofs--hit on dead\nears.\n\n'I am Kim.  I am Kim.  And what is Kim?'  His soul repeated it again\nand again.\n\nHe did not want to cry--had never felt less like crying in his\nlife--but of a sudden easy, stupid tears trickled down his nose, and\nwith an almost audible click he felt the wheels of his being lock up\nanew on the world without.  Things that rode meaningless on the eyeball\nan instant before slid into proper proportion.  Roads were meant to be\nwalked upon, houses to be lived in, cattle to be driven, fields to be\ntilled, and men and women to be talked to.  They were all real and\ntrue--solidly planted upon the feet--perfectly comprehensible--clay of\nhis clay, neither more nor less.  He shook himself like a dog with a\nflea in his ear, and rambled out of the gate.  Said the Sahiba, to whom\nwatchful eyes reported this move: 'Let him go.  I have done my share.\nMother Earth must do the rest. When the Holy One comes back from\nmeditation, tell him.'\n\nThere stood an empty bullock-cart on a little knoll half a mile away,\nwith a young banyan tree behind--a look-out, as it were, above some\nnew-ploughed levels; and his eyelids, bathed in soft air, grew heavy as\nhe neared it.  The ground was good clean dust--no new herbage that,\nliving, is half-way to death already, but the hopeful dust that holds\nthe seeds of all life.  He felt it between his toes, patted it with his\npalms, and joint by joint, sighing luxuriously, laid him down full\nlength along in the shadow of the wooden-pinned cart.  And Mother Earth\nwas as faithful as the Sahiba.  She breathed through him to restore the\npoise he had lost lying so long on a cot cut off from her good\ncurrents.  His head lay powerless upon her breast, and his opened hands\nsurrendered to her strength.  The many-rooted tree above him, and even\nthe dead manhandled wood beside, knew what he sought, as he himself did\nnot know.  Hour upon hour he lay deeper than sleep.\n\nTowards evening, when the dust of returning kine made all the horizons\nsmoke, came the lama and Mahbub Ali, both afoot, walking cautiously,\nfor the house had told them where he had gone.\n\n'Allah!  What a fool's trick to play in open country!'  muttered the\nhorse-dealer.  'He could be shot a hundred times--but this is not the\nBorder.'\n\n'And,' said the lama, repeating a many-times-told tale, 'never was such\na chela.  Temperate, kindly, wise, of ungrudging disposition, a merry\nheart upon the road, never forgetting, learned, truthful, courteous.\nGreat is his reward!'\n\n'I know the boy--as I have said.'\n\n'And he was all those things?'\n\n'Some of them--but I have not yet found a Red Hat's charm for making\nhim overly truthful.  He has certainly been well nursed.'\n\n'The Sahiba is a heart of gold,' said the lama earnestly.  'She looks\nupon him as her son.'\n\n'Hmph!  Half Hind seems that way disposed.  I only wished to see that\nthe boy had come to no harm and was a free agent.  As thou knowest, he\nand I were old friends in the first days of your pilgrimage together.'\n\n'That is a bond between us.'  The lama sat down.  'We are at the end of\nthe pilgrimage.'\n\n'No thanks to thee thine was not cut off for good and all a week back.\nI heard what the Sahiba said to thee when we bore thee up on the cot.'\nMahbub laughed, and tugged his newly dyed beard.\n\n'I was meditating upon other matters that tide.  It was the hakim from\nDacca broke my meditations.'\n\n'Otherwise'--this was in Pushtu for decency's sake--'thou wouldst have\nended thy meditations upon the sultry side of Hell--being an unbeliever\nand an idolater for all thy child's simplicity.  But now, Red Hat, what\nis to be done?'\n\n'This very night,'--the words came slowly, vibrating with\ntriumph--'this very night he will be as free as I am from all taint of\nsin--assured as I am, when he quits this body, of Freedom from the\nWheel of Things.  I have a sign'--he laid his hand above the torn chart\nin his bosom--'that my time is short; but I shall have safeguarded him\nthroughout the years.  Remember, I have reached Knowledge, as I told\nthee only three nights back.'\n\n'It must be true, as the Tirah priest said when I stole his cousin's\nwife, that I am a Sufi [a free-thinker]; for here I sit,' said Mahbub\nto himself, 'drinking in blasphemy unthinkable ...  I remember the\ntale.  On that, then, he goes to Fannatu l'Adn [the Gardens of Eden].\nBut how?  Wilt thou slay him or drown him in that wonderful river from\nwhich the Babu dragged thee?'\n\n'I was dragged from no river,' said the lama simply.  'Thou hast\nforgotten what befell.  I found it by Knowledge.'\n\n'Oh, ay.  True,' stammered Mahbub, divided between high indignation and\nenormous mirth.  'I had forgotten the exact run of what happened. Thou\ndidst find it knowingly.'\n\n'And to say that I would take life is--not a sin, but a madness simple.\nMy chela aided me to the River.  It is his right to be cleansed from\nsin--with me.'\n\n'Ay, he needs cleansing.  But afterwards, old man--afterwards?'\n\n'What matter under all the Heavens?  He is sure of\nNibban--enlightened--as I am.'\n\n'Well said.  I had a fear he might mount Mohammed's Horse and fly away.'\n\n'Nay--he must go forth as a teacher.'\n\n'Aha!  Now I see!  That is the right gait for the colt.  Certainly he\nmust go forth as a teacher.  He is somewhat urgently needed as a scribe\nby the State, for instance.'\n\n'To that end he was prepared.  I acquired merit in that I gave alms for\nhis sake.  A good deed does not die.  He aided me in my Search.  I\naided him in his.  Just is the Wheel, O horse-seller from the North.\nLet him be a teacher; let him be a scribe--what matter?  He will have\nattained Freedom at the end.  The rest is illusion.'\n\n'What matter?  When I must have him with me beyond Balkh in six months!\nI come up with ten lame horses and three strong-backed men--thanks to\nthat chicken of a Babu--to break a sick boy by force out of an old\ntrot's house.  It seems that I stand by while a young Sahib is hoisted\ninto Allah knows what of an idolater's Heaven by means of old Red Hat.\nAnd I am reckoned something of a player of the Game myself!  But the\nmadman is fond of the boy; and I must be very reasonably mad too.'\n\n'What is the prayer?' said the lama, as the rough Pushtu rumbled into\nthe red beard.\n\n'No matter at all; but now I understand that the boy, sure of Paradise,\ncan yet enter Government service, my mind is easier.  I must get to my\nhorses.  It grows dark.  Do not wake him.  I have no wish to hear him\ncall thee master.'\n\n'But he is my disciple.  What else?'\n\n'He has told me.'  Mahbub choked down his touch of spleen and rose\nlaughing.  'I am not altogether of thy faith, Red Hat--if so small a\nmatter concern thee.'\n\n'It is nothing,' said the lama.\n\n'I thought not.  Therefore it will not move thee, sinless, new-washed\nand three parts drowned to boot, when I call thee a good man--a very\ngood man.  We have talked together some four or five evenings now, and\nfor all I am a horse-coper I can still, as the saying is, see holiness\nbeyond the legs of a horse.  Yea, can see, too, how our Friend of all\nthe World put his hand in thine at the first.  Use him well, and suffer\nhim to return to the world as a teacher, when thou hast--bathed his\nlegs, if that be the proper medicine for the colt.'\n\n'Why not follow the Way thyself, and so accompany the boy?'\n\nMahbub stared stupefied at the magnificent insolence of the demand,\nwhich across the Border he would have paid with more than a blow. Then\nthe humour of it touched his worldly soul.\n\n'Softly--softly--one foot at a time, as the lame gelding went over the\nUmballa jumps.  I may come to Paradise later--I have workings that\nway--great motions--and I owe them to thy simplicity.  Thou hast never\nlied?'\n\n'What need?'\n\n'O Allah, hear him!  \"What need\" in this Thy world!  Nor ever harmed a\nman?'\n\n'Once--with a pencase--before I was wise.'\n\n'So?  I think the better of thee.  Thy teachings are good.  Thou hast\nturned one man that I know from the path of strife.'  He laughed\nimmensely.  'He came here open-minded to commit a dacoity [a\nhouse-robbery with violence].  Yes, to cut, rob, kill, and carry off\nwhat he desired.'\n\n'A great foolishness!'\n\n'Oh!  black shame too.  So he thought after he had seen thee--and a few\nothers, male and female.  So he abandoned it; and now he goes to beat a\nbig fat Babu man.'\n\n'I do not understand.'\n\n'Allah forbid it!  Some men are strong in knowledge, Red Hat.  Thy\nstrength is stronger still.  Keep it--I think thou wilt.  If the boy be\nnot a good servant, pull his ears off.'\n\nWith a hitch of his broad Bokhariot belt the Pathan swaggered off into\nthe gloaming, and the lama came down from his clouds so far as to look\nat the broad back.\n\n'That person lacks courtesy, and is deceived by the shadow of\nappearances.  But he spoke well of my chela, who now enters upon his\nreward.  Let me make the prayer!  ...  Wake, O fortunate above all born\nof women.  Wake!  It is found!'\n\nKim came up from those deep wells, and the lama attended his yawning\npleasure; duly snapping fingers to head off evil spirits.\n\n'I have slept a hundred years.  Where--?  Holy One, hast thou been here\nlong?  I went out to look for thee, but'--he laughed drowsily--'I slept\nby the way.  I am all well now.  Hast thou eaten?  Let us go to the\nhouse.  It is many days since I tended thee.  And the Sahiba fed thee\nwell?  Who shampooed thy legs?  What of the weaknesses--the belly and\nthe neck, and the beating in the ears?'\n\n'Gone--all gone.  Dost thou not know?'\n\n'I know nothing, but that I have not seen thee in a monkey's age. Know\nwhat?'\n\n'Strange the knowledge did not reach out to thee, when all my thoughts\nwere theeward.'\n\n'I cannot see the face, but the voice is like a gong.  Has the Sahiba\nmade a young man of thee by her cookery?'\n\nHe peered at the cross-legged figure, outlined jet-black against the\nlemon-coloured drift of light.  So does the stone Bodhisat sit who\nlooks down upon the patent self-registering turnstiles of the Lahore\nMuseum.\n\nThe lama held his peace.  Except for the click of the rosary and a\nfaint clop-clop of Mahbub's retreating feet, the soft, smoky silence of\nevening in India wrapped them close.\n\n'Hear me!  I bring news.'\n\n'But let us--'\n\nOut shot the long yellow hand compelling silence.  Kim tucked his feet\nunder his robe-edge obediently.\n\n'Hear me!  I bring news!  The Search is finished.  Comes now the\nReward... Thus.  When we were among the Hills, I lived on thy strength\ntill the young branch bowed and nigh broke.  When we came out of the\nHills, I was troubled for thee and for other matters which I held in my\nheart.  The boat of my soul lacked direction; I could not see into the\nCause of Things.  So I gave thee over to the virtuous woman altogether.\nI took no food.  I drank no water.  Still I saw not the Way.  They\npressed food upon me and cried at my shut door.  So I removed myself to\na hollow under a tree.  I took no food.  I took no water.  I sat in\nmeditation two days and two nights, abstracting my mind; inbreathing\nand outbreathing in the required manner ...  Upon the second night--so\ngreat was my reward--the wise Soul loosed itself from the silly Body\nand went free.  This I have never before attained, though I have stood\non the threshold of it.  Consider, for it is a marvel!'\n\n'A marvel indeed.  Two days and two nights without food!  Where was the\nSahiba?'  said Kim under his breath.\n\n'Yea, my Soul went free, and, wheeling like an eagle, saw indeed that\nthere was no Teshoo Lama nor any other soul.  As a drop draws to water,\nso my Soul drew near to the Great Soul which is beyond all things.  At\nthat point, exalted in contemplation, I saw all Hind, from Ceylon in\nthe sea to the Hills, and my own Painted Rocks at Such-zen; I saw every\ncamp and village, to the least, where we have ever rested.  I saw them\nat one time and in one place; for they were within the Soul.  By this I\nknew the Soul had passed beyond the illusion of Time and Space and of\nThings.  By this I knew that I was free.  I saw thee lying in thy cot,\nand I saw thee falling downhill under the idolater--at one time, in one\nplace, in my Soul, which, as I say, had touched the Great Soul.  Also I\nsaw the stupid body of Teshoo Lama lying down, and the hakim from Dacca\nkneeled beside, shouting in its ear.  Then my Soul was all alone, and I\nsaw nothing, for I was all things, having reached the Great Soul.  And\nI meditated a thousand thousand years, passionless, well aware of the\nCauses of all Things.  Then a voice cried:  \"What shall come to the boy\nif thou art dead?\"  and I was shaken back and forth in myself with pity\nfor thee; and I said:  \"I will return to my chela, lest he miss the\nWay.\" Upon this my Soul, which is the Soul of Teshoo Lama, withdrew\nitself from the Great Soul with strivings and yearnings and retchings\nand agonies not to be told.  As the egg from the fish, as the fish from\nthe water, as the water from the cloud, as the cloud from the thick\nair, so put forth, so leaped out, so drew away, so fumed up the Soul of\nTeshoo Lama from the Great Soul.  Then a voice cried:  \"The River! Take\nheed to the River!\" and I looked down upon all the world, which was as\nI had seen it before--one in time, one in place--and I saw plainly the\nRiver of the Arrow at my feet.  At that hour my Soul was hampered by\nsome evil or other whereof I was not wholly cleansed, and it lay upon\nmy arms and coiled round my waist; but I put it aside, and I cast forth\nas an eagle in my flight for the very place of the River.  I pushed\naside world upon world for thy sake.  I saw the River below me--the\nRiver of the Arrow--and, descending, the waters of it closed over me;\nand behold I was again in the body of Teshoo Lama, but free from sin,\nand the hakim from Decca bore up my head in the waters of the River.\nIt is here!  It is behind the mango-tope here--even here!'\n\n'Allah kerim!  Oh, well that the Babu was by!  Wast thou very wet?'\n\n'Why should I regard?  I remember the hakim was concerned for the body\nof Teshoo Lama.  He haled it out of the holy water in his hands, and\nthere came afterwards thy horse-seller from the North with a cot and\nmen, and they put the body on the cot and bore it up to the Sahiba's\nhouse.'\n\n'What said the Sahiba?'\n\n'I was meditating in that body, and did not hear.  So thus the Search\nis ended.  For the merit that I have acquired, the River of the Arrow\nis here.  It broke forth at our feet, as I have said.  I have found it.\nSon of my Soul, I have wrenched my Soul back from the Threshold of\nFreedom to free thee from all sin--as I am free, and sinless! Just is\nthe Wheel!  Certain is our deliverance!  Come!'\n\nHe crossed his hands on his lap and smiled, as a man may who has won\nsalvation for himself and his beloved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Kim, by Rudyard Kipling\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK KIM ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2226.txt or 2226.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/2/2226/\n\nProduced by Patricia Franks, Karyl Basmajian, Nancy K.\nSmith, Dave Bruchie.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
