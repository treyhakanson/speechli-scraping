The Man in the Iron Mask we're\nfamiliar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition.\n[Not all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of the\nconfusion...but wait...there's yet more reason for confusion.]\n\nWe intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, split into four\netexts entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la\nValliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask; you WILL be getting The Man in\nthe Iron Mask.\n\nOne thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,\nentitled Ten Years Later, says it's the sequel to The Three Musketeers.\nWhile this is technically true, there's another book, Twenty Years\nAfter, that comes between. The confusion is generated by the two facts\nthat we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years\nAfter, and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty\nYears \"After\" the original story...however, this is why the different\nwords \"After\" and \"Later\"...the Ten Years \"After\" is ten years after\nthe Twenty Years later...as per history. Also, the third book of the\nD'Artagnan Romances, while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, has the\nsubtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different\nvolumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the\nfirst volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later\ncan, similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the\nfour-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,\nit refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material\nin the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the\nseries which may prove helpful:\n\nThe Three Musketeers: Etext 1257--First book of the D'Artagnan Romances.\nCovers the years 1625-1628.\n\nTwenty Years After: Etext 1259--Second book of the D'Artagnan Romances.\nCovers the years 1648-1649. [Third in the order that we published, but\nsecond in time sequence!!!]\n\nTen Years Later: Etext 1258--First 104 chapters of the third book of the\nD'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661.\n\nThe Vicomte de Bragelonne: Etext 2609 (our new etext)--First 75 chapters\nof the third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the year 1660.\n\nTen Years Later: forthcoming (our next etext)--Chapters 76-140 of that\nthird book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661. [In\nthis particular editing of it]\n\nLouise de la Valliere: forthcoming (following)--Chapters 141-208 of the\nthird book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the year 1661.\n\nThe Man in the Iron Mask: forthcoming (completing)--Chapters 209-269 of\nthe third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1661-1673.\n\nIf we've calculated correctly, that fourth text SHOULD correspond to\nthe modern editions of The Man in the Iron Mask, which is still\nwidely circulated, and comprises about the last 1/4 of The Vicomte de\nBragelonne.\n\nHere is a list of the other Dumas Etexts we have published so far:\n\nSep 1999 La Tulipe Noire, by Alexandre\nDumas[Pere#6/French][tlpnrxxx.xxx]1910 This is an abridged edition in\nFrench, also see our full length English Etext Jul 1997 The Black Tulip,\nby Alexandre Dumas[Pere][Dumas#1][tbtlpxxx.xxx] 965 Jan 1998 The Count\nof Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas[Pere][crstoxxx.xxx]1184\n\n\nMany thanks to Dr. David Coward, whose editions of the D'Artagnan\nRomances have proved an invaluable source of information.\n\nIntroduction: In the months of March-July in 1844, in the magazine Le\nSiecle, the first portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated\nplaywright Alexandre Dumas. It was based, he claimed, on some\nmanuscripts he had found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale\nwhile researching a history he planned to write on Louis XIV. They\nchronicled the adventures of a young man named D'Artagnan who, upon\nentering Paris, became almost immediately embroiled in court intrigues,\ninternational politics, and ill-fated affairs between royal lovers. Over\nthe next six years, readers would enjoy the adventures of this youth and\nhis three famous friends, Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their exploits\nunraveled behind the scenes of some of the most momentous events in\nFrench and even English history.\n\nEventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form,\nand became the three D'Artagnan Romances known today. Here is a brief\nsummary of the first two novels:\n\nThe Three Musketeers (serialized March--July, 1844): The year is 1625.\nThe young D'Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and\nalmost immediately offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.\nInstead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal's\nguards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.\nThe four become fast friends, and, when asked by D'Artagnan's landlord\nto find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that takes them\nacross both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the\nCardinal Richelieu. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy,\nnamed simply Milady, who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of\nAustria before her husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the\nfour friends.\n\nTwenty Years After (serialized January--August, 1845): The year is now\n1648, twenty years since the close of the last story. Louis XIII has\ndied, as has Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit\nupon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV,\nthe real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.\nD'Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have\nretired to private life. Athos turned out to be a nobleman, the Comte de\nla Fere, and has retired to his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.\nAramis, whose real name is D'Herblay, has followed his intention of\nshedding the musketeer's cassock for the priest's robes, and Porthos has\nmarried a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her death. But\ntrouble is stirring in both France and England. Cromwell menaces the\ninstitution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I, and at\nhome the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart. D'Artagnan brings\nhis friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch,\nbut Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother's death\nat the musketeers' hands, thwarts their valiant efforts. Undaunted, our\nheroes return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV,\nquiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.\n\nThe third novel, The Vicomte de Bragelonne (serialized October, 1847\nto January, 1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English\ntranslation. It has been split into three, four, or five volumes at\nvarious points in its history. The five-volume edition generally does\nnot give titles to the smaller portions, but the others do. In the\nthree-volume edition, the novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne,\nLouise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. For the purposes of\nthis etext, I have chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition\ndoes, with these titles: The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later,\nLouise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. In this, the first\nof the four etexts, the situation is thus:\n\nIt is now 1660, and although promised the captaincy of the musketeers at\nthe close of Twenty Years After, D'Artagnan is still trailing his sword\nin the Louvre as a lowly lieutenant. Louis XIV is well past the age\nwhere he should rule, but the ailing Cardinal Mazarin refuses to\nrelinquish the reins of power. Meanwhile, Charles II, a king without\na country, travels Europe seeking aid from his fellow monarchs. Athos\nstill resides at La Fere while his son, Raoul de Bragelonne, has entered\ninto the service in the household of M. le Prince. As for Raoul, he has\nhis eyes on an entirely different object than his father--his childhood\ncompanion, Louise de la Valliere, with whom he is hopelessly in love.\nPorthos, now a baron, is off on some mysterious mission along with\nAramis, who is now the Bishop of Vannes.\n\nNow begins the first chapter of the last of the D'Artagnan Romances, The\nVicomte de Bragelonne. Enjoy!\n\nJohn Bursey, May, 2000\n\n*****\n\n\n\nChapter I. The Letter.\n\nTowards the middle of the month of May, in the year 1660, at nine\no'clock in the morning, when the sun, already high in the heavens,\nwas fast absorbing the dew from the ramparts of the castle of Blois, a\nlittle cavalcade, composed of three men and two pages, re-entered\nthe city by the bridge, without producing any other effect upon the\npassengers of the quay beyond a first movement of the hand to the head,\nas a salute, and a second movement of the tongue to express, in the\npurest French then spoken in France: \"There is Monsieur returning from\nhunting.\" And that was all.\n\nWhilst, however, the horses were climbing the steep acclivity which\nleads from the river to the castle, several shop-boys approached the\nlast horse, from whose saddle-bow a number of birds were suspended by\nthe beak.\n\nOn seeing this, the inquisitive youths manifested with rustic freedom\ntheir contempt for such paltry sport, and, after a dissertation among\nthemselves upon the disadvantages of hawking, they returned to their\noccupations; one only of the curious party, a stout, stubby, cheerful\nlad, having demanded how it was that Monsieur, who, from his great\nrevenues, had it in his power to amuse himself so much better, could be\nsatisfied with such mean diversions.\n\n\"Do you not know,\" one of the standers-by replied, \"that Monsieur's\nprincipal amusement is to weary himself?\"\n\nThe light-hearted boy shrugged his shoulders with a gesture which said\nas clear as day: \"In that case I would rather be plain Jack than a\nprince.\" And all resumed their labors.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Monsieur continued his route with an air at once so\nmelancholy and so majestic, that he certainly would have attracted the\nattention of spectators, if spectators there had been; but the good\ncitizens of Blois could not pardon Monsieur for having chosen their gay\ncity for an abode in which to indulge melancholy at his ease, and as\noften as they caught a glimpse of the illustrious _ennuye_, they\nstole away gaping, or drew back their heads into the interior of their\ndwellings, to escape the soporific influence of that long pale face, of\nthose watery eyes, and that languid address; so that the worthy prince\nwas almost certain to find the streets deserted whenever he chanced to\npass through them.\n\nNow, on the part of the citizens of Blois this was a culpable piece of\ndisrespect, for Monsieur was, after the king--nay, even perhaps, before\nthe king--the greatest noble of the kingdom. In fact, God, who had\ngranted to Louis XIV., then reigning, the honor of being son of Louis\nXIII., had granted to Monsieur the honor of being son of Henry IV. It\nwas not then, or, at least, it ought not to have been, a trifling source\nof pride for the city of Blois, that Gaston of Orleans had chosen it as\nhis residence, and held his court in the ancient Castle of the States.\n\nBut it was the destiny of this great prince to excite the attention and\nadmiration of the public in a very modified degree wherever he might be.\nMonsieur had fallen into this situation by habit.\n\nIt was not, perhaps, this which gave him that air of listlessness.\nMonsieur had already been tolerably busy in the course of his life. A\nman cannot allow the heads of a dozen of his best friends to be cut\noff without feeling a little excitement; and as, since the accession of\nMazarin to power, no heads had been cut off, Monsieur's occupation was\ngone, and his _morale_ suffered from it.\n\nThe life of the poor prince was then very dull. After his little morning\nhawking-party on the banks of the Beuvron, or in the woods of Cheverny,\nMonsieur crossed the Loire, went to breakfast at Chambord, with\nor without an appetite, and the city of Blois heard no more of its\nsovereign lord and master till the next hawking-day.\n\nSo much for the ennui _extra muros_; of the ennui of the interior we\nwill give the reader an idea if he will with us follow the cavalcade to\nthe majestic porch of the Castle of the States.\n\nMonsieur rode a little steady-paced horse, equipped with a large saddle\nof red Flemish velvet, with stirrups in the shape of buskins; the horse\nwas of a bay color; Monsieur's pourpoint of crimson velvet corresponded\nwith the cloak of the same shade and the horse's equipment, and it was\nonly by this red appearance of the whole that the prince could be known\nfrom his two companions, the one dressed in violet, the other in green.\nHe on the left, in violet, was his equerry; he on the right, in green,\nwas the grand veneur.\n\nOne of the pages carried two gerfalcons upon a perch, the other a\nhunting-horn, which he blew with a careless note at twenty paces from\nthe castle. Every one about this listless prince did what he had to\nlistlessly.\n\nAt this signal, eight guards, who were lounging in the sun in the square\ncourt, ran to their halberts, and Monsieur made his solemn entry into\nthe castle.\n\nWhen he had disappeared under the shades of the porch, three or four\nidlers, who had followed the cavalcade to the castle, after pointing\nout the suspended birds to each other, dispersed with comments upon\nwhat they saw: and, when they were gone, the street, the palace, and the\ncourt, all remained deserted alike.\n\nMonsieur dismounted without speaking a word, went straight to his\napartments, where his valet changed his dress, and as Madame had not\nyet sent orders respecting breakfast, Monsieur stretched himself upon\na _chaise longue_, and was soon as fast asleep as if it had been eleven\no'clock at night.\n\nThe eight guards, who concluded their service for the day was over, laid\nthemselves down very comfortably in the sun upon some stone benches;\nthe grooms disappeared with their horses into the stables, and, with the\nexception of a few joyous birds, startling each other with their sharp\nchirping in the tufted shrubberies, it might have been thought that the\nwhole castle was as soundly asleep as Monsieur was.\n\nAll at once, in the midst of this delicious silence, there resounded\na clear ringing laugh, which caused several of the halberdiers in the\nenjoyment of their _siesta_ to open at least one eye.\n\nThis burst of laughter proceeded from a window of the castle, visited\nat this moment by the sun, that embraced it in one of those large\nangles which the profiles of the chimneys mark out upon the walls before\nmid-day.\n\nThe little balcony of wrought iron which advanced in front of this\nwindow was furnished with a pot of red gilliflowers, another pot of\nprimroses, and an early rose-tree, the foliage of which, beautifully\ngreen, was variegated with numerous red specks announcing future roses.\n\nIn the chamber lighted by this window, was a square table, covered with\nan old large-flowered Haarlem tapestry; in the center of this table\nwas a long-necked stone bottle, in which were irises and lilies of the\nvalley; at each end of this table was a young girl.\n\nThe position of these two young people was singular; they might have\nbeen taken for two boarders escaped from a convent. One of them, with\nboth elbows on the table, and a pen in her hand, was tracing characters\nupon a sheet of fine Dutch paper; the other, kneeling upon a chair,\nwhich allowed her to advance her head and bust over the back of it to\nthe middle of the table, was watching her companion as she wrote, or\nrather hesitated to write.\n\nThence the thousand cries, the thousand railleries, the thousand laughs,\none of which, more brilliant than the rest, had startled the birds in\nthe gardens, and disturbed the slumbers of Monsieur's guards.\n\nWe are taking portraits now; we shall be allowed, therefore, we hope, to\nsketch the two last of this chapter.\n\nThe one who was leaning in the chair--that is to say, the joyous,\nlaughing one--was a beautiful girl of from eighteen to twenty, with\nbrown complexion and brown hair, splendid, from eyes which sparkled\nbeneath strongly-marked brows, and particularly from her teeth, which\nseemed to shine like pearls between her red coral lips. Her every\nmovement seemed the accent of a sunny nature; she did not walk--she\nbounded.\n\nThe other, she who was writing, looked at her turbulent companion with\nan eye as limpid, as pure, and as blue as the azure of the day. Her\nhair, of a shaded fairness, arranged with exquisite taste, fell in silky\ncurls over her lovely mantling cheeks; she passed across the paper a\ndelicate hand, whose thinness announced her extreme youth. At each burst\nof laughter that proceeded from her friend, she raised, as if annoyed,\nher white shoulders in a poetical and mild manner, but they were wanting\nin that richfulness of mold that was likewise to be wished in her arms\nand hands.\n\n\"Montalais! Montalais!\" said she at length, in a voice soft and\ncaressing as a melody, \"you laugh too loud--you laugh like a man! You\nwill not only draw the attention of messieurs the guards, but you will\nnot hear Madame's bell when Madame rings.\"\n\nThis admonition neither made the young girl called Montalais cease to\nlaugh nor gesticulate. She only replied: \"Louise, you do not speak as\nyou think, my dear; you know that messieurs the guards, as you call\nthem, have only just commenced their sleep, and that a cannon would not\nwaken them; you know that Madame's bell can be heard at the bridge\nof Blois, and that consequently I shall hear it when my services are\nrequired by Madame. What annoys you, my child, is that I laugh while you\nare writing; and what you are afraid of is that Madame de Saint-Remy,\nyour mother, should come up here, as she does sometimes when we laugh\ntoo loud, that she should surprise us, and that she should see that\nenormous sheet of paper upon which, in a quarter of an hour, you have\nonly traced the words _Monsieur Raoul_. Now, you are right, my dear\nLouise, because after these words, 'Monsieur Raoul', others may be put\nso significant and incendiary as to cause Madame Saint-Remy to burst out\ninto fire and flames! _Hein!_ is not that true now?--say.\"\n\nAnd Montalais redoubled her laughter and noisy provocations.\n\nThe fair girl at length became quite angry; she tore the sheet of paper\non which, in fact, the words \"Monsieur Raoul\" were written in good\ncharacters; and crushing the paper in her trembling hands, she threw it\nout of the window.\n\n\"There! there!\" said Mademoiselle de Montalais; \"there is our little\nlamb, our gentle dove, angry! Don't be afraid, Louise--Madame de\nSaint-Remy will not come; and if she should, you know I have a quick\near. Besides, what can be more permissible than to write to an old\nfriend of twelve years' standing, particularly when the letter begins\nwith the words 'Monsieur Raoul'?\"\n\n\"It is all very well--I will not write to him at all,\" said the young\ngirl.\n\n\"Ah, ah! in good sooth, Montalais is properly punished,\" cried the\njeering brunette, still laughing. \"Come, come! let us try another sheet\nof paper, and finish our dispatch off-hand. Good! there is the bell\nringing now. By my faith, so much the worse! Madame must wait, or else\ndo without her first maid of honor this morning.\"\n\nA bell, in fact, did ring; it announced that Madame had finished her\ntoilette, and waited for Monsieur to give her his hand, and conduct her\nfrom the _salon_ to the refectory.\n\nThis formality being accomplished with great ceremony, the husband and\nwife breakfasted, and then separated till the hour of dinner, invariably\nfixed at two o'clock.\n\nThe sound of this bell caused a door to be opened in the offices on the\nleft hand of the court, from which filed two _maitres d'hotel_ followed\nby eight scullions bearing a kind of hand-barrow loaded with dishes\nunder silver covers.\n\nOne of the _maitres d'hotel_, the first in rank, touched one of the\nguards, who was snoring on his bench, slightly with his wand; he even\ncarried his kindness so far as to place the halbert which stood against\nthe wall in the hands of the man stupid with sleep, after which the\nsoldier, without explanation, escorted the _viande_ of Monsieur to the\nrefectory, preceded by a page and the two _maitres d'hotel_.\n\nWherever the _viande_ passed, the soldiers ported arms.\n\nMademoiselle de Montalais and her companion had watched from their\nwindow the details of this ceremony, to which, by the bye, they must\nhave been pretty well accustomed. But they did not look so much from\ncuriosity as to be assured they should not be disturbed. So, guards,\nscullions, _maitres d'hotel_, and pages having passed, they resumed\ntheir places at the table; and the sun, which, through the window-frame,\nhad for an instant fallen upon those two charming countenances, now only\nshed its light upon the gilliflowers, primroses, and rose-tree.\n\n\"Bah!\" said Mademoiselle de Montalais, taking her place again; \"Madame\nwill breakfast very well without me!\"\n\n\"Oh! Montalais, you will be punished!\" replied the other girl, sitting\ndown quietly in hers.\n\n\"Punished, indeed!--that is to say, deprived of a ride! That is just\nthe way in which I wish to be punished. To go out in the grand coach,\nperched upon a doorstep; to turn to the left, twist round to the right,\nover roads full of ruts, where we cannot exceed a league in two hours;\nand then to come back straight towards the wing of the castle in which\nis the window of Mary de Medici, so that Madame never fails to say:\n'Could one believe it possible that Mary de Medici should have escaped\nfrom that window--forty-seven feet high? The mother of two princes and\nthree princesses!' If you call that relaxation, Louise, all I ask is to\nbe punished every day; particularly when my punishment is to remain with\nyou and write such interesting letters as we write!\"\n\n\"Montalais! Montalais! there are duties to be performed.\"\n\n\"You talk of them very much at your ease, dear child!--you, who are left\nquite free amidst this tedious court. You are the only person that reaps\nthe advantages of them without incurring the trouble,--you, who are\nreally more one of Madame's maids of honor than I am, because Madame\nmakes her affection for your father-in-law glance off upon you; so that\nyou enter this dull house as the birds fly into yonder court, inhaling\nthe air, pecking the flowers, picking up the grain, without having the\nleast service to perform, or the least annoyance to undergo. And you\ntalk to me of duties to be performed! In sooth, my pretty idler, what\nare your own proper duties, unless to write to the handsome Raoul? And\neven that you don't do; so that it looks to me as if you likewise were\nrather negligent of your duties!\"\n\nLouise assumed a serious air, leant her chin upon her hand, and, in a\ntone full of candid remonstrance, \"And do you reproach me with my good\nfortune?\" said she. \"Can you have the heart to do it? You have a future;\nyou will belong to the court; the king, if he should marry, will require\nMonsieur to be near his person; you will see splendid _fetes_, you will\nsee the king, who they say is so handsome, so agreeable!\"\n\n\"Ay, and still more, I shall see Raoul, who attends upon M. le Prince,\"\nadded Montalais, maliciously.\n\n\"Poor Raoul!\" sighed Louise.\n\n\"Now is the time to write to him, my pretty dear! Come, begin again,\nwith that famous 'Monsieur Raoul' which figures at the top of the poor\ntorn sheet.\"\n\nShe then held the pen toward her, and with a charming smile encouraged\nher hand, which quickly traced the words she named.\n\n\"What next?\" asked the younger of the two girls.\n\n\"Why, now write what you think, Louise,\" replied Montalais.\n\n\"Are you quite sure I think of anything?\"\n\n\"You think of somebody, and that amounts to the same thing, or rather\neven more.\"\n\n\"Do you think so, Montalais?\"\n\n\"Louise, Louise, your blue eyes are as deep as the sea I saw at Boulogne\nlast year! No, no, I mistake--the sea is perfidious: your eyes are as\ndeep as the azure yonder--look!--over our heads!\"\n\n\"Well, since you can read so well in my eyes, tell me what I am thinking\nabout, Montalais.\"\n\n\"In the first place, you don't think, _Monsieur Raoul_; you think, _My\ndear Raoul_.\"\n\n\"Oh!--\"\n\n\"Never blush for such a trifle as that! 'My dear Raoul,' we will\nsay--'You implore me to write you at Paris, where you are detained by\nyour attendance on M. le Prince. As you must be very dull there, to seek\nfor amusement in the remembrance of a _provinciale_--'\"\n\nLouise rose up suddenly. \"No, Montalais,\" said she, with a smile; \"I\ndon't think a word of that. Look, this is what I think;\" and she seized\nthe pen boldly, and traced, with a firm hand, the following words:\n\n\"I should have been very unhappy if your entreaties to obtain a\nremembrance of me had been less warm. Everything here reminds me of our\nearly days, which so quickly passed away, which so delightfully flew by,\nthat no others will ever replace the charm of them in my heart.\"\n\nMontalais, who watched the flying pen, and read, the wrong way upwards,\nas fast as her friend wrote, here interrupted by clapping her hands.\n\"Capital!\" cried she; \"there is frankness--there is heart--there is\nstyle! Show these Parisians, my dear, that Blois is the city for fine\nlanguage!\"\n\n\"He knows very well that Blois was a Paradise to me,\" replied the girl.\n\n\"That is exactly what you mean to say; and you speak like an angel.\"\n\n\"I will finish, Montalais,\" and she continued as follows: \"You often\nthink of me, you say, Monsieur Raoul: I thank you; but that does not\nsurprise me, when I recollect how often our hearts have beaten close to\neach other.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said Montalais. \"Beware, my lamb! You are scattering your\nwool, and there are wolves about.\"\n\nLouise was about to reply, when the gallop of a horse resounded under\nthe porch of the castle.\n\n\"What is that?\" said Montalais, approaching the window. \"A handsome\ncavalier, by my faith!\"\n\n\"Oh!--Raoul!\" exclaimed Louise, who had made the same movement as her\nfriend, and, becoming pale as death, sunk back beside her unfinished\nletter.\n\n\"Now, he is a clever lover, upon my word!\" cried Montalais; \"he arrives\njust at the proper moment.\"\n\n\"Come in, come in, I implore you!\" murmured Louise.\n\n\"Bah! he does not know me. Let me see what he has come here for.\"\n\n\n\nChapter II. The Messenger.\n\nMademoiselle de Montalais was right; the young cavalier was goodly to\nlook upon.\n\nHe was a young man of from twenty-four to twenty-five years of age, tall\nand slender, wearing gracefully the picturesque military costume of the\nperiod. His large boots contained a foot which Mademoiselle de Montalais\nmight not have disowned if she had been transformed into a man. With one\nof his delicate but nervous hands he checked his horse in the middle of\nthe court, and with the other raised his hat, whose long plumes shaded\nhis at once serious and ingenuous countenance.\n\nThe guards, roused by the steps of the horse, awoke, and were on foot\nin a minute. The young man waited till one of them was close to his\nsaddle-bow: then, stooping towards him, in a clear, distinct voice,\nwhich was perfectly audible at the window where the two girls were\nconcealed, \"A message for his royal highness,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" cried the soldier. \"Officer, a messenger!\"\n\nBut this brave guard knew very well that no officer would appear, seeing\nthat the only one who could have appeared dwelt at the other side of the\ncastle, in an apartment looking into the gardens. So he hastened to add:\n\"The officer, monsieur, is on his rounds; but, in his absence, M. de\nSaint-Remy, the _maitre d'hotel_, shall be informed.\"\n\n\"M. de Saint-Remy?\" repeated the cavalier, slightly blushing.\n\n\"Do you know him?\"\n\n\"Why, yes; but request him, if you please, that my visit be announced to\nhis royal highness as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"It appears to be pressing,\" said the guard, as if speaking to himself,\nbut really in the hope of obtaining an answer.\n\nThe messenger made an affirmative sign with his head.\n\n\"In that case,\" said the guard, \"I will go and seek the _maitre d'hotel_\nmyself.\"\n\nThe young man, in the meantime, dismounted; and whilst the others were\nmaking their remarks upon the fine horse the cavalier rode, the soldier\nreturned.\n\n\"Your pardon, young gentleman; but your name, if you please?\"\n\n\"The Vicomte de Bragelonne, on the part of his highness M. le Prince de\nConde.\"\n\nThe soldier made a profound bow, and, as if the name of the conqueror\nof Rocroi and Lens had given him wings, he stepped lightly up the steps\nleading to the ante-chamber.\n\nM. de Bragelonne had not had time to fasten his horse to the iron bars\nof the _perron_, when M. de Saint-Remy came running, out of breath,\nsupporting his capacious body with one hand, whilst with the other he\ncut the air as a fisherman cleaves the waves with his oar.\n\n\"Ah, Monsieur le Vicomte! You at Blois!\" cried he. \"Well, that is a\nwonder. Good-day to you--good-day, Monsieur Raoul.\"\n\n\"I offer you a thousand respects, M. de Saint-Remy.\"\n\n\"How Madame de la Vall--I mean, how delighted Madame de Saint-Remy will\nbe to see you! But come in. His royal highness is at breakfast--must he\nbe interrupted? Is the matter serious?\"\n\n\"Yes, and no, Monsieur de Saint-Remy. A moment's delay, however, would\nbe disagreeable to his royal highness.\"\n\n\"If that is the case, we will force the _consigne_, Monsieur le Vicomte.\nCome in. Besides, Monsieur is in an excellent humor to-day. And then you\nbring news, do you not?\"\n\n\"Great news, Monsieur de Saint-Remy.\n\n\"And good, I presume?\"\n\n\"Excellent.\"\n\n\"Come quickly, come quickly then!\" cried the worthy man, putting his\ndress to rights as he went along.\n\nRaoul followed him, hat in hand, and a little disconcerted at the noise\nmade by his spurs in these immense _salons_.\n\nAs soon as he had disappeared in the interior of the palace, the window\nof the court was repeopled, and an animated whispering betrayed\nthe emotion of the two girls. They soon appeared to have formed a\nresolution, for one of the two faces disappeared from the window. This\nwas the brunette; the other remained behind the balcony, concealed by\nthe flowers, watching attentively through the branches the _perron_ by\nwhich M. de Bragelonne had entered the castle.\n\nIn the meantime the object of so much laudable curiosity continued his\nroute, following the steps of the _maitre d'hotel_. The noise of quick\nsteps, an odor of wine and viands, a clinking of crystal and plates,\nwarned them that they were coming to the end of their course.\n\nThe pages, valets and officers, assembled in the office which led up to\nthe refectory, welcomed the newcomer with the proverbial politeness of\nthe country; some of them were acquainted with Raoul, and all knew\nthat he came from Paris. It might be said that his arrival for a moment\nsuspended the service. In fact, a page, who was pouring out wine for his\nroyal highness, on hearing the jingling of spurs in the next chamber,\nturned round like a child, without perceiving that he was continuing to\npour out, not into the glass, but upon the tablecloth.\n\nMadame, who was not so preoccupied as her glorious spouse was, remarked\nthis distraction of the page.\n\n\"Well?\" exclaimed she.\n\n\"Well!\" repeated Monsieur; \"what is going on then?\"\n\nM. de Saint-Remy, who had just introduced his head through the doorway,\ntook advantage of the moment.\n\n\"Why am I to be disturbed?\" said Gaston, helping himself to a thick\nslice of one of the largest salmon that had ever ascended the Loire to\nbe captured between Paimboeuf and Saint-Nazaire.\n\n\"There is a messenger from Paris. Oh! but after monseigneur has\nbreakfasted will do; there is plenty of time.\"\n\n\"From Paris!\" cried the prince, letting his fork fall. \"A messenger from\nParis, do you say? And on whose part does this messenger come?\"\n\n\"On the part of M. le Prince,\" said the _maitre d'hotel_ promptly.\n\nEvery one knows that the Prince de Conde was so called.\n\n\"A messenger from M. le Prince!\" said Gaston, with an inquietude that\nescaped none of the assistants, and consequently redoubled the general\ncuriosity.\n\nMonsieur, perhaps, fancied himself brought back again to the happy times\nwhen the opening of a door gave him an emotion, in which every letter\nmight contain a state secret,--in which every message was connected with\na dark and complicated intrigue. Perhaps, likewise, that great name\nof M. le Prince expanded itself, beneath the roofs of Blois, to the\nproportions of a phantom.\n\nMonsieur pushed away his plate.\n\n\"Shall I tell the envoy to wait?\" asked M. de Saint-Remy.\n\nA glance from Madame emboldened Gaston, who replied: \"No, no! let him\ncome in at once, on the contrary. _A propos_, who is he?\"\n\n\"A gentleman of this country, M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"Ah, very well! Introduce him, Saint-Remy--introduce him.\"\n\nAnd when he had let fall these words, with his accustomed gravity,\nMonsieur turned his eyes, in a certain manner, upon the people of his\nsuite, so that all, pages, officers, and equerries, quitted the service,\nknives and goblets, and made towards the second chamber door a retreat\nas rapid as it was disorderly.\n\nThis little army had dispersed in two files when Raoul de Bragelonne,\npreceded by M. de Saint-Remy, entered the refectory.\n\nThe short interval of solitude which this retreat had left him,\npermitted Monsieur the time to assume a diplomatic countenance. He did\nnot turn round, but waited till the _maitre d'hotel_ should bring the\nmessenger face to face with him.\n\nRaoul stopped even with the lower end of the table, so as to be exactly\nbetween Monsieur and Madame. From this place he made a profound bow to\nMonsieur, and a very humble one to Madame; then, drawing himself up into\nmilitary pose, he waited for Monsieur to address him.\n\nOn his part the prince waited till the doors were hermetically closed;\nhe would not turn round to ascertain the fact, as that would have been\nderogatory to his dignity, but he listened with all his ears for the\nnoise of the lock, which would promise him at least an appearance of\nsecrecy.\n\nThe doors being closed, Monsieur raised his eyes towards the vicomte,\nand said, \"It appears that you come from Paris, monsieur?\"\n\n\"This minute, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"How is the king?\"\n\n\"His majesty is in perfect health, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"And my sister-in-law?\"\n\n\"Her majesty the queen-mother still suffers from the complaint in her\nchest, but for the last month she has been rather better.\"\n\n\"Somebody told me you came on the part of M. le Prince. They must have\nbeen mistaken, surely?\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur; M. le Prince has charged me to convey this letter to\nyour royal highness, and I am to wait for an answer to it.\"\n\nRaoul had been a little annoyed by this cold and cautious reception, and\nhis voice insensibly sank to a low key.\n\nThe prince forgot that he was the cause of this apparent mystery, and\nhis fears returned.\n\nHe received the letter from the Prince de Conde with a haggard look,\nunsealed it as he would have unsealed a suspicious packet, and in order\nto read it so that no one should remark the effects of it upon his\ncountenance, he turned round.\n\nMadame followed, with an anxiety almost equal to that of the prince,\nevery maneuver of her august husband.\n\nRaoul, impassible, and a little disengaged by the attention of his\nhosts, looked from his place through the open window at the gardens and\nthe statues which peopled them.\n\n\"Well!\" cried Monsieur, all at once, with a cheerful smile; \"here is\nan agreeable surprise, and a charming letter from M. le Prince. Look,\nMadame!\"\n\nThe table was too large to allow the arm of the prince to reach the hand\nof Madame; Raoul sprang forward to be their intermediary, and did it\nwith so good a grace as to procure a flattering acknowledgement from the\nprincess.\n\n\"You know the contents of this letter, no doubt?\" said Gaston to Raoul.\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur; M. le Prince at first gave me the message verbally,\nbut upon reflection his highness took up his pen.\"\n\n\"It is beautiful writing,\" said Madame, \"but I cannot read it.\"\n\n\"Will you read it to Madame, M. de Bragelonne?\" said the duke.\n\n\"Yes; read it, if you please, monsieur.\"\n\nRaoul began to read, Monsieur giving again all his attention. The letter\nwas conceived in these terms:\n\n\"MONSEIGNEUR--The king is about to set out for the frontiers. You are\naware the marriage of his majesty is concluded upon. The king has done\nme the honor to appoint me his _marechal-des-logis_ for this journey,\nand as I knew with what joy his majesty would pass a day at Blois, I\nventure to ask your royal highness's permission to mark the house you\ninhabit as our quarters. If, however, the suddenness of this request\nshould create to your royal highness any embarrassment, I entreat you to\nsay so by the messenger I send, a gentleman of my suite, M. le Vicomte\nde Bragelonne. My itinerary will depend on your royal highness's\ndetermination, and instead of passing through Blois, we shall come\nthrough Vendome or Romorantin. I venture to hope that your royal\nhighness will be pleased with my arrangement, it being the expression of\nmy boundless desire to make myself agreeable to you.\"\n\n\"Nothing can be more gracious toward us,\" said Madame, who had more\nthan once consulted the looks of her husband during the reading of the\nletter. \"The king here!\" exclaimed she, in a rather louder tone than\nwould have been necessary to preserve secrecy.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said his royal highness in his turn, \"you will offer my\nthanks to M. de Conde, and express to him my gratitude for the honor he\nhas done me.\" Raoul bowed.\n\n\"On what day will his majesty arrive?\" continued the prince.\n\n\"The king, monseigneur, will in all probability arrive this evening.\"\n\n\"But how, then, could he have known my reply if it had been in the\nnegative?\"\n\n\"I was desired, monseigneur, to return in all haste to Beaugency,\nto give counter-orders to the courier, who was himself to go back\nimmediately with counter-orders to M. le Prince.\"\n\n\"His majesty is at Orleans, then?\"\n\n\"Much nearer, monseigneur; his majesty must by this time have arrived at\nMeung.\"\n\n\"Does the court accompany him?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"_A propos_, I forgot to ask you after M. le Cardinal.\"\n\n\"His eminence appears to enjoy good health, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"His nieces accompany him, no doubt?\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur; his eminence has ordered the Mesdemoiselles de Mancini\nto set out for Brouage. They will follow the left bank of the Loire,\nwhile the court will come by the right.\n\n\"What! Mademoiselle Mary de Mancini quit the court in that manner?\"\nasked Monsieur, his reserve beginning to diminish.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Mary de Mancini in particular,\" replied Raoul discreetly.\n\nA fugitive smile, an imperceptible vestige of his ancient spirit of\nintrigue, shot across the pale face of the prince.\n\n\"Thanks, M. de Bragelonne,\" then said Monsieur. \"You would, perhaps,\nnot be willing to carry M. le Prince the commission with which I would\ncharge you, and that is, that his messenger has been very agreeable to\nme; but I will tell him so myself.\"\n\nRaoul bowed his thanks to Monsieur for the honor he had done him.\n\nMonsieur made a sign to Madame, who struck a bell which was placed at\nher right hand; M. de Saint-Remy entered, and the room was soon filled\nwith people.\n\n\"Messieurs,\" said the prince, \"his majesty is about to pay me the honor\nof passing a day at Blois; I depend on the king, my nephew, not having\nto repent of the favor he does my house.\"\n\n\"_Vive le Roi!_\" cried all the officers of the household with frantic\nenthusiasm, and M. de Saint-Remy louder than the rest.\n\nGaston hung down his head with evident chagrin. He had all his life\nbeen obliged to hear, or rather to undergo, this cry of \"_Vive le Roi!_\"\nwhich passed over him. For a long time, being unaccustomed to hear\nit, his ear had had rest, and now a younger, more vivacious, and more\nbrilliant royalty rose up before him, like a new and more painful\nprovocation.\n\nMadame perfectly understood the sufferings of that timid, gloomy heart;\nshe rose from the table, Monsieur imitated her mechanically, and all\nthe domestics, with a buzzing like that of several bee-hives, surrounded\nRaoul for the purpose of questioning him.\n\nMadame saw this movement, and called M. de Saint-Remy.\n\n\"This is not the time for gossiping, but working,\" said she, with the\ntone of an angry housekeeper.\n\nM. de Saint-Remy hastened to break the circle formed by the officers\nround Raoul, so that the latter was able to gain the ante-chamber.\n\n\"Care will be taken of that gentleman, I hope,\" added Madame, addressing\nM. de Saint-Remy.\n\nThe worthy man immediately hastened after Raoul. \"Madame desires\nrefreshments to be offered to you,\" said he; \"and there is, besides, a\nlodging for you in the castle.\"\n\n\"Thanks, M. de Saint-Remy,\" replied Raoul; \"but you know how anxious I\nmust be to pay my duty to M. le Comte, my father.\"\n\n\"That is true, that is true, Monsieur Raoul; present him, at the same\ntime, my humble respects, if you please.\"\n\nRaoul thus once more got rid of the old gentleman, and pursued his way.\nAs he was passing under the porch, leading his horse by the bridle, a\nsoft voice called him from the depths of an obscure path.\n\n\"Monsieur Raoul!\" said the voice.\n\nThe young man turned round, surprised, and saw a dark complexioned girl,\nwho, with a finger on her lip, held out her other hand to him. This\nyoung lady was an utter stranger.\n\n\n\nChapter III. The Interview.\n\nRaoul made one step towards the girl who thus called him.\n\n\"But my horse, madame?\" said he.\n\n\"Oh! you are terribly embarrassed! Go yonder way--there is a shed in the\nouter court: fasten your horse, and return quickly!\"\n\n\"I obey, madame.\"\n\nRaoul was not four minutes in performing what he had been directed to\ndo; he returned to the little door, where, in the gloom, he found his\nmysterious conductress waiting for him, on the first steps of a winding\nstaircase.\n\n\"Are you brave enough to follow me, monsieur knight errant?\" asked the\ngirl, laughing at the momentary hesitation Raoul had manifested.\n\nThe latter replied by springing up the dark staircase after her. They\nthus climbed up three stories, he behind her, touching with his hands,\nwhen he felt for the banister, a silk dress which rubbed against\neach side of the staircase. At every false step made by Raoul, his\nconductress cried, \"Hush!\" and held out to him a soft perfumed hand.\n\n\"One would mount thus to the belfry of the castle without being\nconscious of fatigue,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"All of which means, monsieur, that you are very much perplexed, very\ntired, and very uneasy. But be of good cheer, monsieur; here we are, at\nour destination.\"\n\nThe girl threw open a door, which immediately, without any transition,\nfilled with a flood of light the landing of the staircase, at the top of\nwhich Raoul appeared, holding fast by the balustrade.\n\nThe girl continued to walk on--he followed her; she entered a\nchamber--he did the same.\n\nAs soon as he was fairly in the net he heard a loud cry, and, turning\nround, saw at two paces from him, with her hands clasped and her eyes\nclosed, that beautiful fair girl with blue eyes and white shoulders,\nwho, recognizing him, called him Raoul.\n\nHe saw her, and divined at once so much love and so much joy in the\nexpression of her countenance, the he sank on his knees in the middle of\nthe chamber, murmuring, on his part, the name of Louise.\n\n\"Ah! Montalais!--Montalais!\" she sighed, \"it is very wicked to deceive\nme so.\"\n\n\"Who, I? I have deceived you?\"\n\n\"Yes; you told me you would go down to inquire the news, and you have\nbrought up monsieur!\"\n\n\"Well, I was obliged to do so--how else could he have received the\nletter you wrote him?\" And she pointed with her finger to the letter\nwhich was still upon the table.\n\nRaoul made a step to take it; Louise, more rapid, although she had\nsprung forward with a sufficiently remarkable physical hesitation,\nreached out her hand to stop him. Raoul came in contact with that\ntrembling hand, took it within his own, and carried it so respectfully\nto his lips, that he might have been said to have deposited a sigh upon\nit rather than a kiss.\n\nIn the meantime, Mademoiselle de Montalais had taken the letter, folded\nit carefully, as women do, in three folds, and slipped it into her\nbosom.\n\n\"Don't be afraid, Louise,\" said she; \"monsieur will no more venture to\ntake it hence than the defunct king Louis XIII. ventured to take billets\nfrom the corsage of Mademoiselle de Hautefort.\"\n\nRaoul blushed at seeing the smile of the two girls; and he did not\nremark that the hand of Louise remained in his.\n\n\"There!\" said Montalais, \"you have pardoned me, Louise, for having\nbrought monsieur to you; and you, monsieur, bear me no malice for having\nfollowed me to see mademoiselle. Now, then, peace being made, let us\nchat like old friends. Present me, Louise, to M. de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Vicomte,\" said Louise, with her quiet grace and ingenuous\nsmile, \"I have the honor to present to you Mademoiselle Aure de\nMontalais, maid of honor to her royal highness MADAME, and moreover my\nfriend--my excellent friend.\"\n\nRaoul bowed ceremoniously.\n\n\"And me, Louise,\" said he--\"will you not present me also to\nmademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Oh, she knows you--she knows all!\"\n\nThis unguarded expression made Montalais laugh and Raoul sigh with\nhappiness, for he interpreted it thus: \"_She knows all our love_.\"\n\n\"The ceremonies being over, Monsieur le Vicomte,\" said Montalais, \"take\na chair, and tell us quickly the news you bring flying thus.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, it is no longer a secret; the king, on his way to\nPoitiers, will stop at Blois, to visit his royal highness.\"\n\n\"The king here!\" exclaimed Montalais, clapping her hands. \"What! are we\ngoing to see the court? Only think, Louise--the real court from Paris!\nOh, good heavens! But when will this happen, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Perhaps this evening, mademoiselle; at latest, to-morrow.\"\n\nMontalais lifted her shoulders in a sigh of vexation.\n\n\"No time to get ready! No time to prepare a single dress! We are as far\nbehind the fashions as the Poles. We shall look like portraits from the\ntime of Henry IV. Ah, monsieur! this is sad news you bring us!\"\n\n\"But, mesdemoiselles, you will be still beautiful!\"\n\n\"That's no news! Yes, we shall always be beautiful, because nature has\nmade us passable; but we shall be ridiculous, because the fashion will\nhave forgotten us. Alas! ridiculous! I shall be thought ridiculous--I!\"\n\n\"And by whom?\" said Louise, innocently.\n\n\"By whom? You are a strange girl, my dear. Is that a question to put\nto me? I mean everybody; I mean the courtiers, the nobles; I mean the\nking.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, my good friend; but as here every one is accustomed to see\nus as we are--\"\n\n\"Granted; but that is about to change, and we shall be ridiculous, even\nfor Blois; for close to us will be seen the fashions from Paris, and\nthey will perceive that we are in the fashion of Blois! It is enough to\nmake one despair!\"\n\n\"Console yourself, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Well, so let it be! After all, so much the worse for those who do not\nfind me to their taste!\" said Montalais, philosophically.\n\n\"They would be very difficult to please,\" replied Raoul, faithful to his\nregular system of gallantry.\n\n\"Thank you, Monsieur le Vicomte. We were saying, then, that the king is\ncoming to Blois?\"\n\n\"With all the court.\"\n\n\"Mesdemoiselles de Mancini, will they be with them?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not.\"\n\n\"But as the king, it is said, cannot do without Mademoiselle Mary?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, the king must do without her. M. le Cardinal will have it\nso. He has exiled his nieces to Brouage.\"\n\n\"He!--the hypocrite!\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Louise, pressing a finger on her friend's rosy lips.\n\n\"Bah! nobody can hear me. I say that old Mazarino Mazarini is a\nhypocrite, who burns impatiently to make his niece Queen of France.\"\n\n\"That cannot be, mademoiselle, since M. le Cardinal, on the contrary,\nhad brought about the marriage of his majesty with the Infanta Maria\nTheresa.\"\n\nMontalais looked Raoul full in the face, and said, \"And do you Parisians\nbelieve in these tales? Well! we are a little more knowing than you, at\nBlois.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, if the king goes beyond Poitiers and sets out for Spain;\nif the articles of the marriage contract are agreed upon by Don Luis de\nHaro and his eminence, you must plainly perceive that it is not child's\nplay.\"\n\n\"All very fine! but the king is king, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No doubt, mademoiselle; but the cardinal is the cardinal.\"\n\n\"The king is not a man, then! And he does not love Mary Mancini?\"\n\n\"He adores her.\"\n\n\"Well, he will marry her then. We shall have war with Spain. M. Mazarin\nwill spend a few of the millions he has put away; our gentlemen\nwill perform prodigies of valor in their encounters with the proud\nCastilians, and many of them will return crowned with laurels, to be\nrecrowned by us with myrtles. Now, that is my view of politics.\"\n\n\"Montalais, you are wild!\" said Louise, \"and every exaggeration attracts\nyou as light does a moth.\"\n\n\"Louise, you are so extremely reasonable, that you will never know how\nto love.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Louise, in a tone of tender reproach, \"don't you see,\nMontalais? The queen-mother desires to marry her son to the Infanta;\nwould you wish him to disobey his mother? Is it for a royal heart like\nhis to set such a bad example? When parents forbid love, love must be\nbanished.\"\n\nAnd Louise sighed: Raoul cast down his eyes, with an expression of\nconstraint. Montalais, on her part, laughed aloud.\n\n\"Well, I have no parents!\" said she.\n\n\"You are acquainted, without doubt, with the state of health of M. le\nComte de la Fere?\" said Louise, after breathing that sigh which had\nrevealed so many griefs in its eloquent utterance.\n\n\"No, mademoiselle,\" replied Raoul, \"I have not let paid my respects to\nmy father; I was going to his house when Mademoiselle de Montalais so\nkindly stopped me. I hope the comte is well. You have heard nothing to\nthe contrary, have you?\"\n\n\"No, M. Raoul--nothing, thank God!\"\n\nHere, for several instants, ensued a silence, during which two spirits,\nwhich followed the same idea, communicated perfectly, without even the\nassistance of a single glance.\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\" exclaimed Montalais in a fright; \"there is somebody\ncoming up.\"\n\n\"Who can it be?\" said Louise, rising in great agitation.\n\n\"Mesdemoiselles, I inconvenience you very much. I have, without doubt,\nbeen very indiscreet,\" stammered Raoul, very ill at ease.\n\n\"It is a heavy step,\" said Louise.\n\n\"Ah! if it is only M. Malicorne,\" added Montalais, \"do not disturb\nyourselves.\"\n\nLouise and Raoul looked at each other to inquire who M. Malicorne could\nbe.\n\n\"There is no occasion to mind him,\" continued Montalais; \"he is not\njealous.\"\n\n\"But, mademoiselle--\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Yes, I understand. Well, he is discreet as I am.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Louise, who had applied her ear to the door, which\nhad been left ajar; \"it is my mother's step!\"\n\n\"Madame de Saint-Remy! Where shall I hide myself?\" exclaimed Raoul,\ncatching at the dress of Montalais, who looked quite bewildered.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she; \"yes, I know the clicking of those pattens! It is our\nexcellent mother. M. le Vicomte, what a pity it is the window looks upon\na stone pavement, and that fifty paces below it.\"\n\nRaoul glanced at the balcony in despair. Louise seized his arm and held\nit tight.\n\n\"Oh, how silly I am!\" said Montalais; \"have I not the robe-of-ceremony\ncloset? It looks as if it were made on purpose.\"\n\nIt was quite time to act; Madame de Saint-Remy was coming up at a\nquicker pace than usual. She gained the landing at the moment when\nMontalais, as in all scenes of surprises, shut the closet by leaning\nwith her back against the door.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Madame de Saint-Remy, \"you are here, are you, Louise?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" replied she, more pale than if she had committed a great\ncrime.\n\n\"Well, well!\"\n\n\"Pray be seated, madame,\" said Montalais, offering her a chair, which\nshe placed so that the back was towards the closet.\n\n\"Thank you, Mademoiselle Aure--thank you. Come, my child, be quick.\"\n\n\"Where do you wish me to go, madame?\"\n\n\"Why, home, to be sure; have you not to prepare your toilette?\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" cried Montalais, hastening to affect surprise, so\nfearful was she that Louise would in some way commit herself.\n\n\"You don't know the news, then?\" said Madame de Saint-Remy.\n\n\"What news, madame, is it possible for two girls to learn up in this\ndove-cote?\"\n\n\"What! have you seen nobody?\"\n\n\"Madame, you talk in enigmas, and you torment us at a slow fire!\" cried\nMontalais, who, terrified at seeing Louise become paler and paler, did\nnot know to what saint to put up her vows.\n\nAt length she caught an eloquent look of her companion's, one of those\nlooks which would convey intelligence to a brick wall. Louise directed\nher attention to a hat--Raoul's unlucky hat, which was set out in all\nits feathery splendor upon the table.\n\nMontalais sprang towards it, and, seizing it with her left hand, passed\nit behind her into the right, concealing it as she was speaking.\n\n\"Well,\" said Madame de Saint-Remy, \"a courier has arrived, announcing\nthe approach of the king. There, mesdemoiselles; there is something to\nmake you put on your best looks.\"\n\n\"Quick, quick!\" cried Montalais. \"Follow Madame your mother, Louise; and\nleave me to get ready my dress of ceremony.\"\n\nLouise arose; her mother took her by the hand, and led her out on to the\nlanding.\n\n\"Come along,\" said she; then adding in a low voice, \"When I forbid you\nto come the apartment of Montalais, why do you do so?\"\n\n\"Madame, she is my friend. Besides, I had but just come.\"\n\n\"Did you see nobody concealed while you were there?\"\n\n\"Madame!\"\n\n\"I saw a man's hat, I tell you--the hat of that fellow, that\ngood-for-nothing!\"\n\n\"Madame!\" repeated Louise.\n\n\"Of that do-nothing Malicorne! A maid of honor to have such\ncompany--fie! fie!\" and their voices were lost in the depths of the\nnarrow staircase.\n\nMontalais had not missed a word of this conversation, which echo\nconveyed to her as if through a tunnel. She shrugged her shoulders on\nseeing Raoul, who had listened likewise, issue from the closet.\n\n\"Poor Montalais!\" said she, \"the victim of friendship! Poor Malicorne,\nthe victim of love!\"\n\nShe stopped on viewing the tragic-comic face of Raoul, who was vexed at\nhaving, in one day, surprised so many secrets.\n\n\"Oh, mademoiselle!\" said he; \"how can we repay your kindness?\"\n\n\"Oh, we will balance accounts some day,\" said she. \"For the present,\nbegone, M. de Bragelonne, for Madame de Saint-Remy is not over\nindulgent; and any indiscretion on her part might bring hither a\ndomiciliary visit, which would be disagreeable to all parties.\"\n\n\"But Louise--how shall I know--\"\n\n\"Begone! begone! King Louis XI. knew very well what he was about when he\ninvented the post.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" sighed Raoul.\n\n\"And am I not here--I, who am worth all the posts in the kingdom? Quick,\nI say, to horse! so that if Madame de Saint-Remy should return for\nthe purpose of preaching me a lesson on morality, she may not find you\nhere.\"\n\n\"She would tell my father, would she not?\" murmured Raoul.\n\n\"And you would be scolded. Ah, vicomte, it is very plain you come from\ncourt; you are as timid as the king. _Peste!_ at Blois we contrive\nbetter than that, to do without papa's consent. Ask Malicorne else!\"\n\nAnd at these words the girl pushed Raoul out of the room by the\nshoulders. He glided swiftly down to the porch, regained his horse,\nmounted, and set off as if he had had Monsieur's guards at his heels.\n\n\n\nChapter IV. Father and Son.\n\nRaoul followed the well-known road, so dear to his memory, which led\nfrom Blois to the residence of the Comte de la Fere.\n\nThe reader will dispense with a second description of that habitation:\nhe, perhaps, has been with us there before, and knows it. Only, since\nour last journey thither, the walls had taken on a grayer tint, and the\nbrick-work assumed a more harmonious copper tone; the trees had grown,\nand many that then only stretched their slender branches along the tops\nof the hedges, now, bushy, strong, and luxuriant, cast around, beneath\nboughs swollen with sap, great shadows of blossoms or fruit for the\nbenefit of the traveler.\n\nRaoul perceived, from a distance, the two little turrets, the dove-cote\nin the elms, and the flights of pigeons, which wheeled incessantly\naround that brick cone, seemingly without power to quit it, like the\nsweet memories which hover round a spirit at peace.\n\nAs he approached, he heard the noise of the pulleys which grated under\nthe weight of the heavy pails; he also fancied he heard the melancholy\nmoaning of the water which falls back again into the wells--a sad,\nfunereal, solemn sound, which strikes the ear of the child and the\npoet--both dreamers--which the English call _splash_; Arabian poets\n_gasgachau_; and which we Frenchmen, who would be poets, can only\ntranslate by a paraphrase--_the noise of water falling into water_.\n\nIt was more than a year since Raoul had been to visit his father. He had\npassed the whole time in the household of M. le Prince. In fact, after\nall the commotions of the Fronde, of the early period of which we\nformerly attempted to give a sketch, Louis de Conde had made a public,\nsolemn and frank reconciliation with the court. During all the time that\nthe rupture between the king and the prince had lasted, the prince, who\nhad long entertained a great regard for Bragelonne, had in vain offered\nhim advantages of the most dazzling kind for a young man. The Comte de\nla Fere, still faithful to his principles of loyalty, and royalty, one\nday developed before his son in the vaults of Saint Denis,--the Comte\nde la Fere, in the name of his son, had always declined them. Moreover,\ninstead of following M. de Conde in his rebellion, the vicomte had\nfollowed M. de Turenne, fighting for the king. Then when M. de Turenne,\nin his turn, had appeared to abandon the royal cause, he had quitted\nM. de Turenne, as he had quitted M. de Conde. It resulted from this\ninvariable line of conduct, that, as Conde and Turenne had never been\nconquerors of each other but under the standard of the king, Raoul,\nhowever young, had ten victories inscribed on his list of services, and\nnot one defeat from which his bravery or conscience had to suffer.\n\nRaoul, therefore, had, in compliance with the wish of his father, served\nobstinately and passively the fortunes of Louis XIV., in spite of the\ntergiversations which were endemic, and, it might be said, inevitable,\nat that period.\n\nM. de Conde; on being restored to favor, had at once availed himself\nof all the privileges of the amnesty to ask for many things back again\nwhich had been granted to him before, and among others, Raoul. M. de la\nFere, with his invariable good sense, had immediately sent him again to\nthe prince.\n\nA year, then, had passed away since the separation of the father and\nson; a few letters had softened, but not removed, the pain of absence.\nWe have seen that Raoul had left at Blois another love in addition to\nfilial love. But let us do him this justice--if it had not been for\nchance and Mademoiselle de Montalais, two great temptations, Raoul,\nafter delivering his message, would have galloped off towards his\nfather's house, turning his head round, perhaps, but without stopping\nfor a single instant, even if Louise had held out her arms to him.\n\nSo the first part of the journey was given by Raoul to regretting the\npast which he had been forced to quit so quickly, that is to say, his\nlady-love; and the other part to the friend he was about to join, so\nmuch too slowly for his wishes.\n\nRaoul found the garden-gate open, and rode straight in, without\nregarding the long arms, raised in anger, of an old man dressed in a\njacket of violet-colored wool, and a large cap of faded velvet.\n\nThe old man, who was weeding with his hands a bed of dwarf roses and\narguerites, was indignant at seeing a horse thus traversing his sanded\nand nicely-raked walks. He even ventured a vigorous \"Humph!\" which made\nthe cavalier turn round. Then there was a change of scene; for no sooner\nhad he caught sight of Raoul's face, than the old man sprang up and set\noff in the direction of the house, amidst interrupted growlings, which\nappeared to be paroxysms of wild delight.\n\nWhen arrived at the stables, Raoul gave his horse to a little lackey,\nand sprang up the _perron_ with an ardor that would have delighted the\nheart of his father.\n\nHe crossed the ante-chamber, the dining-room, and the _salon_, without\nmeeting any one; at length, on reaching the door of M. de la Fere's\napartment, he rapped impatiently, and entered almost without waiting for\nthe word \"Enter!\" which was vouchsafed him by a voice at once sweet and\nserious. The comte was seated at a table covered with papers and books;\nhe was still the noble, handsome gentleman of former days, but time had\ngiven to this nobleness and beauty a more solemn and distinct character.\nA brow white and void of wrinkles, beneath his long hair, now more white\nthan black; an eye piercing and mild, under the lids of a young man;\nhis mustache, fine but slightly grizzled, waved over lips of a pure and\ndelicate model, as if they had never been curled by mortal passions; a\nform straight and supple; an irreproachable but thin hand--this was what\nremained of the illustrious gentleman whom so many illustrious mouths\nhad praised under the name of Athos. He was engaged in correcting the\npages of a manuscript book, entirely filled by his own hand.\n\nRaoul seized his father by the shoulders, by the neck, as he could,\nand embraced him so tenderly and so rapidly, that the comte had neither\nstrength nor time to disengage himself, or to overcome his paternal\nemotions.\n\n\"What! you here, Raoul--you! Is it possible?\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, monsieur, what joy to see you once again!\"\n\n\"But you don't answer me, vicomte. Have you leave of absence, or has\nsome misfortune happened at Paris?\n\n\"Thank God, monsieur,\" replied Raoul, calming himself by degrees,\n\"nothing has happened but what is fortunate. The king is going to be\nmarried, as I had the honor of informing you in my last letter, and, on\nhis way to Spain, he will pass through Blois.\"\n\n\"To pay a visit to Monsieur?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur le comte. So, fearing to find him unprepared, or wishing\nto be particularly polite to him, monsieur le prince sent me forward to\nhave the lodgings ready.\"\n\n\"You have seen Monsieur?\" asked the comte, eagerly.\n\n\"I have had that honor.\"\n\n\"At the castle?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied Raoul, casting down his eyes, because, no\ndoubt, he had felt there was something more than curiosity in the\ncomte's inquiries.\n\n\"Ah, indeed, vicomte? Accept my compliments thereupon.\"\n\nRaoul bowed.\n\n\"But you have seen some one else at Blois?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I saw her royal highness, Madame.\"\n\n\"That's very well: but it is not Madame that I mean.\"\n\nRaoul colored deeply, but made no reply.\n\n\"You do not appear to understand me, monsieur le vicomte,\" persisted M.\nde la Fere, without accenting his words more strongly, but with a rather\nseverer look.\n\n\"I understand you quite plainly, monsieur,\" replied Raoul, \"and if I\nhesitate a little in my reply, you are well assured I am not seeking for\na falsehood.\"\n\n\"No, you cannot tell a lie; and that makes me so astonished you should\nbe so long in saying yes or no.\"\n\n\"I cannot answer you without understanding you very well; and if I\nhave understood you, you will take my first words in ill part. You will\ndispleased, no doubt, monsieur le comte, because I have seen--\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de la Valliere--have you not?\"\n\n\"It was of her you meant to speak, I know very well, monsieur,\" said\nRaoul, with inexpressible sweetness.\n\n\"And I asked you if you have seen her.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I was ignorant, when I entered the castle, that Mademoiselle\nde la Valliere was there; it was only on my return, after I had\nperformed my mission, that chance brought us together. I have had the\nhonor of paying my respects to her.\"\n\n\"But what do you call the chance that led you into the presence of\nMademoiselle de la Valliere?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Montalais, monsieur.\"\n\n\"And who is Mademoiselle de Montalais?\"\n\n\"A young lady I did not know before, whom I had never seen. She is maid\nof honor to Madame.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le vicomte, I will push my interrogatory no further, and\nreproach myself with having carried it so far. I had desired you\nto avoid Mademoiselle de la Valliere, and not to see her without my\npermission. Oh, I am quite sure you have told me the truth, and that you\ntook no measures to approach her. Chance has done me this injury; I do\nnot accuse you of it. I will be content, then, with what I formerly\nsaid to you concerning this young lady. I do not reproach her with\nanything--God is my witness! only it is not my intention or wish that\nyou should frequent her place of residence. I beg you once more, my dear\nRaoul, to understand that.\"\n\nIt was plain the limpid eyes of Raoul were troubled at this speech.\n\n\"Now, my friend,\" said the comte, with his soft smile, and in his\ncustomary tone, \"let us talk of other matters. You are returning,\nperhaps, to your duty?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, I have no duty for to-day, except the pleasure of\nremaining with you. The prince kindly appointed me no other: which was\nso much in accord with my wish.\"\n\n\"Is the king well?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"And monsieur le prince also?\"\n\n\"As usual, monsieur.\"\n\nThe comte forgot to inquire after Mazarin; that was an old habit.\n\n\"Well, Raoul, since you are entirely mine, I will give up my whole day\nto you. Embrace me--again, again! You are at home, vicomte! Ah, there\nis our old Grimaud! Come in, Grimaud: monsieur le vicomte is desirous of\nembracing you likewise.\"\n\nThe good old man did not require to be twice told; he rushed in with\nopen arms, Raoul meeting him half-way.\n\n\"Now, if you please, we will go into the garden, Raoul. I will show\nyou the new lodging I have had prepared for you during your leave of\nabsence; and whilst examining the last winter's plantations, and two\nsaddle-horses I have just acquired, you will give me all the news of our\nfriends in Paris.\"\n\nThe comte closed his manuscript, took the young man's arm, and went out\ninto the gardens with him.\n\nGrimaud looked at Raoul with a melancholy air as the young man passed\nout; observing that his head nearly touched the _traverse_ of the\ndoorway, stroking his white _royale_, he slowly murmured:--\"How he has\ngrown!\"\n\n\n\nChapter V. In which Something will be said of Cropoli--of Cropoli and of\na Great Unknown Painter.\n\nWhilst the Comte de la Fere with Raoul visits the new buildings he has\nerected, and the new horses he has bought, with the reader's permission\nwe will lead him back to the city of Blois, and make him a witness of\nthe unaccustomed activity which pervades that city.\n\nIt was in the hotels that the surprise of the news brought by Raoul was\nmost sensibly felt.\n\nIn fact, the king and the court at Blois, that is to say, a hundred\nhorsemen, ten carriages, two hundred horses, as many lackeys as\nmasters--where was this crowd to be housed? Where were to be lodged all\nthe gentry of the neighborhood, who would gather in two or three\nhours after the news had enlarged the circle of its report, like the\nincreasing circumferences produced by a stone thrown into a placid lake?\n\nBlois, as peaceful in the morning, as we have seen, as the calmest lake\nin the world, at the announcement of the royal arrival, was suddenly\nfilled with the tumult and buzzing of a swarm of bees.\n\nAll the servants of the castle, under the inspection of the officers,\nwere sent into the city in quest of provisions, and ten horsemen\nwere dispatched to the preserves of Chambord to seek for game, to the\nfisheries of Beuvron for fish, and to the gardens of Cheverny for fruits\nand flowers.\n\nPrecious tapestries, and lusters with great gilt chains, were drawn from\nthe cupboards; an army of the poor were engaged in sweeping the courts\nand washing the stone fronts, whilst their wives went in droves to the\nmeadows beyond the Loire, to gather green boughs and field-flowers. The\nwhole city, not to be behind in this luxury of cleanliness, assumed its\nbest toilette with the help of brushes, brooms, and water. The gutters\nof the upper town, swollen by these continued ablutions, became rivers\nat the bottom of the city, and the pavement, generally very muddy, it\nmust be allowed, took a clean face, and absolutely shone in the friendly\nrays of the sun.\n\nNext the music was to be provided; drawers were emptied; the\nshop-keepers did a glorious trade in wax, ribbons, and sword-knots;\nhousekeepers laid in stores of bread, meat, and spices. Already numbers\nof the citizens whose houses were furnished as if for a siege, having\nnothing more to do, donned their festive clothes, and directed their\ncourse towards the city gate, in order to be the first to signal or see\nthe _cortege_. They knew very well that the king would not arrive before\nnight, perhaps not before the next morning. Yet what is expectation but\na kind of folly, and what is that folly but an excess of hope?\n\nIn the lower city, at scarcely a hundred paces from the Castle of the\nStates, between the mall and the castle, in a sufficiently handsome\nstreet, then called the Rue Vieille, and which must, in fact, have been\nvery old, stood a venerable edifice, with pointed gables, of squat but\nlarge dimensions, ornamented with three windows looking into the street\non the first floor, with two in the second, and with a little _oeil de\nboeuf_ in the third.\n\nOn the sides of this triangle had recently been constructed a\nparallelogram of considerable size, which encroached upon the street\nremorselessly, according to the familiar uses of the building of that\nperiod. The street was narrowed by a quarter by it, but then the house\nwas enlarged by a half; and was not that a sufficient compensation?\n\nTradition said that this house with the pointed gables was inhabited,\nin the time of Henry III., by a councilor of state whom Queen Catherine\ncame, some say to visit, and others to strangle. However that may\nbe, the good lady must have stepped with a circumspect foot over the\nthreshold of this building.\n\nAfter the councilor had died--whether by strangulation or naturally is\nof no consequence--the house had been sold, then abandoned, and lastly\nisolated from the other houses of the street. Towards the middle of the\nreign of Louis XIII. only, an Italian named Cropoli, escaped from the\nkitchens of the Marechal d'Ancre, came and took possession of this\nhouse. There he established a little hostelry, in which was fabricated\na macaroni so delicious that people came from miles round to fetch it or\neat it.\n\nSo famous had the house become for it, that when Mary de Medici was a\nprisoner, as we know, in the castle of Blois, she once sent for some.\n\nIt was precisely on the day she had escaped by the famous window. The\ndish of macaroni was left upon the table, only just tasted by the royal\nmouth.\n\nThis double favor, of a strangulation and a macaroni, conferred upon the\ntriangular house, gave poor Cropoli a fancy to grace his hostelry with\na pompous title. But his quality of an Italian was no recommendation in\nthese times, and his small, well-concealed fortune forbade attracting\ntoo much attention.\n\nWhen he found himself about to die, which happened in 1643, just after\nthe death of Louis XIII., he called to him his son, a young cook\nof great promise, and with tears in his eyes, he recommended him to\npreserve carefully the secret of the macaroni, to Frenchify his name,\nand at length, when the political horizon should be cleared from the\nclouds which obscured it--this was practiced then as in our day, to\norder of the nearest smith a handsome sign, upon which a famous painter,\nwhom he named, should design two queens' portraits, with these words as\na legend: \"TO THE MEDICI.\"\n\nThe worthy Cropoli, after these recommendations, had only sufficient\ntime to point out to his young successor a chimney, under the slab of\nwhich he had hidden a thousand ten-franc pieces, and then expired.\n\nCropoli the younger, like a man of good heart, supported the loss with\nresignation, and the gain without insolence. He began by accustoming the\npublic to sound the final i of his name so little, that by the aid of\ngeneral complaisance, he was soon called nothing but M. Cropole, which\nis quite a French name. He then married, having had in his eye a little\nFrench girl, from whose parents he extorted a reasonable dowry by\nshowing them what there was beneath the slab of the chimney.\n\nThese two points accomplished, he went in search of the painter who was\nto paint the sign; and he was soon found. He was an old Italian, a rival\nof the Raphaels and the Caracci, but an unfortunate rival. He said he\nwas of the Venetian school, doubtless from his fondness for color. His\nworks, of which he had never sold one, attracted the eye at a distance\nof a hundred paces; but they so formidably displeased the citizens, that\nhe had finished by painting no more.\n\nHe boasted of having painted a bath-room for Madame la Marechale\nd'Ancre, and mourned over this chamber having been burnt at the time of\nthe marechal's disaster.\n\nCropoli, in his character of a compatriot, was indulgent towards\nPittrino, which was the name of the artist. Perhaps he had seen the\nfamous pictures of the bath-room. Be this as it may, he held in such\nesteem, we may say in such friendship, the famous Pittrino, that he took\nhim in his own house.\n\nPittrino, grateful, and fed with macaroni, set about propagating the\nreputation of this national dish, and from the time of its founder,\nhe had rendered, with his indefatigable tongue, signal services to the\nhouse of Cropoli.\n\nAs he grew old he attached himself to the son as he had done to the\nfather, and by degrees became a kind of over-looker of a house in which\nhis remarkable integrity, his acknowledged sobriety, and a thousand\nother virtues useless to enumerate, gave him an eternal place by the\nfireside, with a right of inspection over the domestics. Besides this,\nit was he who tasted the macaroni, to maintain the pure flavor of the\nancient tradition; and it must be allowed that he never permitted a\ngrain of pepper too much, or an atom of parmesan too little. His joy\nwas at its height on that day when called upon to share the secret of\nCropoli the younger, and to paint the famous sign.\n\nHe was seen at once rummaging with ardor in an old box, in which he\nfound some brushes, a little gnawed by the rats, but still passable;\nsome linseed-oil in a bottle, and a palette which had formerly belonged\nto Bronzino, that _dieu de la pittoure_, as the ultramontane artist, in\nhis ever young enthusiasm, always called him.\n\nPittrino was puffed up with all the joy of a rehabilitation.\n\nHe did as Raphael had done--he changed his style, and painted, in\nthe fashion of Albani, two goddesses rather than two queens. These\nillustrious ladies appeared so lovely on the sign,--they presented\nto the astonished eyes such an assemblage of lilies and roses, the\nenchanting result of the changes of style in Pittrino--they assumed the\n_poses_ of sirens so Anacreontically--that the principal _echevin_, when\nadmitted to view this capital piece in the _salle_ of Cropole, at once\ndeclared that these ladies were too handsome, of too animated a beauty,\nto figure as a sign in the eyes of passers-by.\n\nTo Pittrino he added, \"His royal highness, Monsieur, who often comes\ninto our city, will not be much pleased to see his illustrious mother so\nslightly clothed, and he will send you to the _oubliettes_ of the state;\nfor, remember, the heart of that glorious prince is not always tender.\nYou must efface either the two sirens or the legend, without which I\nforbid the exhibition of the sign. I say this for your sake, Master\nCropole, as well for yours, Signor Pittrino.\"\n\nWhat answer could be made to this? It was necessary to thank the\n_echevin_ for his kindness, which Cropole did. But Pittrino remained\ndowncast and said he felt assured of what was about to happen.\n\nThe visitor was scarcely gone when Cropole, crossing his arms, said:\n\"Well, master, what is to be done?\"\n\n\"We must efface the legend,\" said Pittrino, in a melancholy tone. \"I\nhave some excellent ivory-black; it will be done in a moment, and we\nwill replace the Medici by the nymphs or the sirens, whichever you\nprefer.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Cropole, \"the will of my father must be carried out. My\nfather considered--\"\n\n\"He considered the figures of the most importance,\" said Pittrino.\n\n\"He thought most of the legend,\" said Cropole.\n\n\"The proof of the importance in which he held the figures,\" said\nPittrino, \"is that he desired they should be likenesses, and they are\nso.\"\n\n\"Yes; but if they had not been so, who would have recognized them\nwithout the legend? At the present day even, when the memory of the\nBlaisois begins to be faint with regard to these two celebrated persons,\nwho would recognize Catherine and Mary without the words '_To the\nMedici_'?\"\n\n\"But the figures?\" said Pittrino, in despair; for he felt that young\nCropole was right. \"I should not like to lose the fruit of my labor.\"\n\n\"And I should not wish you to be thrown into prison, and myself into the\n_oubliettes_.\"\n\n\"Let us efface 'Medici',\" said Pittrino, supplicatingly.\n\n\"No,\" replied Cropole, firmly. \"I have got an idea, a sublime idea--your\npicture shall appear, and my legend likewise. Does not 'Medici' mean\ndoctor, or physician, in Italian?\"\n\n\"Yes, in the plural.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you shall order another sign-frame of the smith; you shall\npaint six physicians, and write underneath '_Aux Medici_' which makes a\nvery pretty play upon words.\"\n\n\"Six physicians! impossible! And the composition?\" cried Pittrino.\n\n\"That is your business--but so it shall be--I insist upon it--it must be\nso--my macaroni is burning.\"\n\nThis reasoning was peremptory--Pittrino obeyed. He composed the sign of\nsix physicians, with the legend; the _echevin_ applauded and authorized\nit.\n\nThe sign produced an extravagant success in the city, which proves that\npoetry has always been in the wrong, before citizens, as Pittrino said.\n\nCropole, to make amends to his painter-in-ordinary, hung up the nymphs\nof the preceding sign in his bedroom, which made Madame Cropole blush\nevery time she looked at it, when she was undressing at night.\n\nThis is the way in which the pointed-gable house got a sign; and this\nis how the hostelry of the Medici, making a fortune, was found to be\nenlarged by a quarter, as we have described. And this is how there was\nat Blois a hostelry of that name, and had for a painter-in-ordinary\nMaster Pittrino.\n\n\n\nChapter VI. The Unknown.\n\nThus founded and recommended by its sign, the hostelry of Master Cropole\nheld its way steadily on towards a solid prosperity.\n\nIt was not an immense fortune that Cropole had in perspective; but he\nmight hope to double the thousand louis d'or left by his father, to make\nanother thousand louis by the sale of his house and stock, and at length\nto live happily like a retired citizen.\n\nCropole was anxious for gain, and was half-crazy with joy at the news of\nthe arrival of Louis XIV.\n\nHimself, his wife, Pittrino, and two cooks, immediately laid hands\nupon all the inhabitants of the dove-cote, the poultry-yard, and the\nrabbit-hutches; so that as many lamentations and cries resounded in the\nyards of the hostelry of the Medici as were formerly heard in Rama.\n\nCropole had, at the time, but one single traveler in his house.\n\nThis was a man of scarcely thirty years of age, handsome, tall, austere,\nor rather melancholy, in all his gestures and looks.\n\nHe was dressed in black velvet with jet trimmings; a white collar, as\nplain as that of the severest Puritan, set off the whiteness of his\nyouthful neck; a small dark-colored mustache scarcely covered his\ncurled, disdainful lip.\n\nHe spoke to people looking them full in the face, without affectation,\nit is true, but without scruple; so that the brilliancy of his black\neyes became so insupportable, that more than one look had sunk beneath\nhis, like the weaker sword in a single combat.\n\nAt this time, in which men, all created equal by God, were divided,\nthanks to prejudices, into two distinct castes, the gentlemen and the\ncommoner, as they are really divided into two races, the black and the\nwhite,--at this time, we say, he whose portrait we have just sketched\ncould not fail of being taken for a gentleman, and of the best class.\nTo ascertain this, there was no necessity to consult anything but his\nhands, long, slender, and white, of which every muscle, every vein,\nbecame apparent through the skin at the least movement, and eloquently\nspoke of good descent.\n\nThis gentleman, then, had arrived alone at Cropole's house. He had\ntaken, without hesitation, without reflection even, the principal\napartment which the _hotelier_ had pointed out to him with a rapacious\naim, very praiseworthy, some will say, very reprehensible will say\nothers, if they admit that Cropole was a physiognomist, and judged\npeople at first sight.\n\nThis apartment was that which composed the whole front of the ancient\ntriangular house; a large _salon_, lighted by two windows on the first\nstage, a small chamber by the side of it, and another above it.\n\nNow, from the time he had arrived, this gentleman had scarcely touched\nany repast that had been served up to him in his chamber. He had spoken\nbut two words to the host, to warn him that a traveler of the name of\nParry would arrive, and to desire that, when he did, he should be shown\nup to him immediately.\n\nHe afterwards preserved so profound a silence, that Cropole was almost\noffended, so much did he prefer people who were good company.\n\nThis gentleman had risen early the morning of the day on which this\nhistory begins, and had placed himself at the window of his _salon_,\nseated upon the ledge, and leaning upon the rail of the balcony, gazing\nsadly but persistently on both sides of the street, watching, no doubt,\nfor the arrival of the traveler he had mentioned to the host.\n\nIn this way he had seen the little _cortege_ of Monsieur return from\nhunting, then had again partaken of the profound tranquillity of the\nstreet, absorbed in his own expectations.\n\nAll at once the movement of the crowd going to the meadows, couriers\nsetting out, washers of pavement, purveyors of the royal household,\ngabbling, scampering shop-boys, chariots in motion, hair-dressers on the\nrun, and pages toiling along, this tumult and bustle had surprised him,\nbut without losing any of that impassible and supreme majesty which\ngives to the eagle and the lion that serene and contemptuous glance\namidst the hurrahs and shouts of hunters or the curious.\n\nSoon the cries of the victims slaughtered in the poultry-yard, the hasty\nsteps of Madame Cropole up that little wooden staircase, so narrow and\nso echoing; the bounding pace of Pittrino, who only that morning\nwas smoking at the door with all the phlegm of a Dutchman; all this\ncommunicated something like surprise and agitation to the traveler.\n\nAs he was rising to make inquiries, the door of his chamber opened. The\nunknown concluded they were about to introduce the impatiently expected\ntraveler, and made three precipitate steps to meet him.\n\nBut, instead of the person he expected, it was Master Cropole who\nappeared, and behind him, in the half-dark staircase, the pleasant face\nof Madame Cropole, rendered trivial by curiosity. She only gave one\nfurtive glance at the handsome gentleman, and disappeared.\n\nCropole advanced, cap in hand, rather bent than bowing.\n\nA gesture of the unknown interrogated him, without a word being\npronounced.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Cropole, \"I come to ask how--what ought I to say: your\nlordship, monsieur le comte, or monsieur le marquis?\"\n\n\"Say _monsieur_, and speak quickly,\" replied the unknown, with that\nhaughty accent which admits of neither discussion nor reply.\n\n\"I came, then, to inquire how monsieur had passed the night, and if\nmonsieur intended to keep this apartment?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, something has happened upon which we could not reckon.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"His majesty Louis XIV. will enter our city to-day, and will remain here\none day, perhaps two.\"\n\nGreat astonishment was painted on the countenance of the unknown.\n\n\"The King of France is coming to Blois?\"\n\n\"He is on the road, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Then there is the stronger reason for my remaining,\" said the unknown.\n\n\"Very well; but will monsieur keep all the apartments?\"\n\n\"I do not understand you. Why should I require less to-day than\nyesterday?\"\n\n\"Because, monsieur, your lordship will permit me to say, yesterday I\ndid not think proper, when you chose your lodging, to fix any price that\nmight have made your lordship believe that I prejudged your resources;\nwhilst to-day--\"\n\nThe unknown colored; the idea at once struck him that he was supposed to\nbe poor, and was being insulted.\n\n\"Whilst to-day,\" replied he, coldly, \"you do not prejudge.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I am a well-meaning man, thank God! and simple _hotelier_ as\nI am, there is in me the blood of a gentleman. My father was a servant\nand officer of the late Marechal d'Ancre. God rest his soul!\"\n\n\"I do not contest that point with you; I only wish to know, and that\nquickly, to what your questions tend?\"\n\n\"You are too reasonable, monsieur, not to comprehend that our city is\nsmall, that the court is about to invade it, that the houses will be\noverflowing with inhabitants, and that lodgings will consequently obtain\nconsiderable prices.\"\n\nAgain the unknown colored. \"Name your terms,\" said he.\n\n\"I name them with scruple, monsieur, because I seek an honest gain, and\nthat I wish to carry on my business without being uncivil or extravagant\nin my demands. Now the room you occupy is considerable, and you are\nalone.\"\n\n\"That is my business.\"\n\n\"Oh! certainly. I do not mean to turn monsieur out.\"\n\nThe blood rushed to the temples of the unknown; he darted at poor\nCropole, the descendant of one of the officers of the Marechal d'Ancre,\na glance that would have crushed him down to beneath that famous\nchimney-slab, if Cropole had not been nailed to the spot by the question\nof his own proper interests.\n\n\"Do you desire me to go?\" said he. \"Explain yourself--but quickly.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, monsieur, you do not understand me. It is very critical--I\nknow--that which I am doing. I express myself badly, or perhaps, as\nmonsieur is a foreigner, which I perceive by his accent--\"\n\nIn fact, the unknown spoke with that impetuosity which is the principal\ncharacter of English accentuation, even among men who speak the French\nlanguage with the greatest purity.\n\n\"As monsieur is a foreigner, I say, it is perhaps he who does not catch\nmy exact meaning. I wish for monsieur to give up one or two of the\napartments he occupies, which would diminish his expenses and ease my\nconscience. Indeed, it is hard to increase unreasonably the price of the\nchambers, when one has had the honor to let them at a reasonable price.\"\n\n\"How much does the hire amount to since yesterday?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, to one louis, with refreshments and the charge for the\nhorse.\"\n\n\"Very well; and that of to-day?\"\n\n\"Ah! there is the difficulty. This is the day of the king's arrival; if\nthe court comes to sleep here, the charge of the day is reckoned. From\nthat it results that three chambers, at two louis each, make six louis.\nTwo louis, monsieur, are not much; but six louis make a great deal.\"\n\nThe unknown, from red, as we have seen him, became very pale.\n\nHe drew from his pocket, with heroic bravery, a purse embroidered with\na coat-of-arms, which he carefully concealed in the hollow of his hand.\nThis purse was of a thinness, a flabbiness, a hollowness, which did not\nescape the eye of Cropole.\n\nThe unknown emptied the purse into his hand. It contained three double\nlouis, which amounted to the six louis demanded by the host.\n\nBut it was seven that Cropole had required.\n\nHe looked, therefore, at the unknown, as much as to say, \"And then?\"\n\n\"There remains one louis, does there not, master hotelier?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, but--\"\n\nThe unknown plunged his hand into the pocket of his _haut-de-chausses_,\nand emptied it. It contained a small pocket-book, a gold key, and some\nsilver. With this change, he made up a louis.\n\n\"Thank you, monsieur,\" said Cropole. \"It now only remains for me to ask\nwhether monsieur intends to occupy his apartments to-morrow, in which\ncase I will reserve them for him; whereas, if monsieur does not mean to\ndo so, I will promise them to some of the king's people who are coming.\"\n\n\"That is but right,\" said the unknown, after a long silence; \"but as\nI have no more money, as you have seen, and as I yet must retain the\napartments, you must either sell this diamond in the city, or hold it in\npledge.\"\n\nCropole looked at the diamond so long, that the unknown said, hastily:\n\n\"I prefer your selling it, monsieur; for it is worth three hundred\npistoles. A Jew--are there any Jews in Blois?--would give you two\nhundred or a hundred and fifty for it--take whatever may be offered for\nit, if it be no more than the price of your lodging. Begone!\"\n\n\"Oh! monsieur,\" replied Cropole, ashamed of the sudden inferiority\nwhich the unknown reflected upon him by this noble and disinterested\nconfidence, as well as by the unalterable patience opposed to so\nmany suspicions and evasions. \"Oh, monsieur, I hope people are not so\ndishonest at Blois as you seem to think; and that the diamond, being\nworth what you say--\"\n\nThe unknown here again darted at Cropole one of his withering glances.\n\n\"I really do not understand diamonds, monsieur, I assure you,\" cried he.\n\n\"But the jewelers do: ask them,\" said the unknown. \"Now I believe our\naccounts are settled, are they not, monsieur l'hote?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, and to my profound regret; for I fear I have offended\nmonsieur.\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" replied the unknown, with ineffable majesty.\n\n\"Or have appeared to be extortionate with a noble traveler. Consider,\nmonsieur, the peculiarity of the case.\"\n\n\"Say no more about it, I desire; and leave me to myself.\"\n\nCropole bowed profoundly, and left the room with a stupefied air, which\nannounced that he had a good heart, and felt genuine remorse.\n\nThe unknown himself shut the door after him, and, when left alone,\nlooked mournfully at the bottom of the purse, from which he had taken a\nsmall silken bag containing the diamond, his last resource.\n\nHe dwelt likewise upon the emptiness of his pockets, turned over\nthe papers in his pocket-book, and convinced himself of the state of\nabsolute destitution in which he was about to be plunged.\n\nHe raised his eyes towards heaven, with a sublime emotion of despairing\ncalmness, brushed off with his hand some drops of sweat which trickled\nover his noble brow, and then cast down upon the earth a look which just\nbefore had been impressed with almost divine majesty.\n\nThat the storm had passed far from him, perhaps he had prayed in the\nbottom of his soul.\n\nHe drew near to the window, resumed his place in the balcony, and\nremained there, motionless, annihilated, dead, till the moment when, the\nheavens beginning to darken, the first flambeaux traversed the enlivened\nstreet, and gave the signal for illumination to all the windows of the\ncity.\n\n\n\nChapter VII. Parry.\n\nWhilst the unknown was viewing these lights with interest, and lending\nan ear to the various noises, Master Cropole entered his apartment,\nfollowed by two attendants, who laid the cloth for his meal.\n\nThe stranger did not pay them the least attention; but Cropole\napproaching him respectfully, whispered, \"Monsieur, the diamond has been\nvalued.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the traveler. \"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, the jeweler of S. A. R. gives two hundred and eighty\npistoles for it.\"\n\n\"Have you them?\"\n\n\"I thought it best to take them, monsieur; nevertheless, I made it a\ncondition of the bargain, that if monsieur wished to keep his diamond,\nit should be held till monsieur was again in funds.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not at all: I told you to sell it.\"\n\n\"Then I have obeyed, or nearly so, since, without having definitely sold\nit, I have touched the money.\"\n\n\"Pay yourself,\" added the unknown.\n\n\"I will do so, monsieur, since you so positively require it.\"\n\nA sad smile passed over the lips of the gentleman.\n\n\"Place the money on that trunk,\" said he, turning round and pointing to\nthe piece of furniture.\n\nCropole deposited a tolerably large bag as directed, after having taken\nfrom it the amount of his reckoning.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"I hope monsieur will not give me the pain of not taking\nany supper. Dinner has already been refused; this is affronting to the\nhouse of _les Medici_. Look, monsieur, the supper is on the table, and I\nventure to say that it is not a bad one.\"\n\nThe unknown asked for a glass of wine, broke off a morsel of bread, and\ndid not stir from the window whilst he ate and drank.\n\nShortly after was heard a loud flourish of trumpets; cries arose in the\ndistance, a confused buzzing filled the lower part of the city, and the\nfirst distinct sound that struck the ears of the stranger was the tramp\nof advancing horses.\n\n\"The king! the king!\" repeated a noisy and eager crowd.\n\n\"The king!\" cried Cropole, abandoning his guest and his ideas of\ndelicacy, to satisfy his curiosity.\n\nWith Cropole were mingled, and jostled, on the staircase, Madame\nCropole, Pittrino, and the waiters and scullions.\n\nThe _cortege_ advanced slowly, lighted by a thousand flambeaux, in the\nstreets and from the windows.\n\nAfter a company of musketeers, a closely ranked troop of gentlemen, came\nthe litter of monsieur le cardinal, drawn like a carriage by four black\nhorses. The pages and people of the cardinal marched behind.\n\nNext came the carriage of the queen-mother, with her maids of honor at\nthe doors, her gentlemen on horseback at both sides.\n\nThe king then appeared, mounted upon a splendid horse of Saxon breed,\nwith a flowing mane. The young prince exhibited, when bowing to some\nwindows from which issued the most animated acclamations, a noble and\nhandsome countenance, illuminated by the flambeaux of his pages.\n\nBy the side of the king, though a little in the rear, the Prince de\nConde, M. Dangeau, and twenty other courtiers, followed by their people\nand their baggage, closed this veritably triumphant march. The pomp was\nof a military character.\n\nSome of the courtiers--the elder ones, for instance--wore traveling\ndresses; but all the rest were clothed in warlike panoply. Many wore the\ngorget and buff coat of the times of Henry IV. and Louis XIII.\n\nWhen the king passed before him, the unknown, who had leant forward over\nthe balcony to obtain a better view, and who had concealed his face\nby leaning on his arm, felt his heart swell and overflow with a bitter\njealousy.\n\nThe noise of the trumpets excited him--the popular acclamations deafened\nhim: for a moment he allowed his reason to be absorbed in this flood of\nlights, tumult, and brilliant images.\n\n\"He is a king!\" murmured he, in an accent of despair.\n\nThen, before he had recovered from his sombre reverie, all the noise,\nall the splendor, had passed away. At the angle of the street there\nremained nothing beneath the stranger but a few hoarse, discordant\nvoices, shouting at intervals \"_Vive le Roi!_\"\n\nThere remained likewise the six candles held by the inhabitants of\nthe hostelry _des Medici_; that is to say, two for Cropole, two for\nPittrino, and one for each scullion. Cropole never ceased repeating,\n\"How good-looking the king is! How strongly he resembles his illustrious\nfather!\"\n\n\"A handsome likeness!\" said Pittrino.\n\n\"And what a lofty carriage he has!\" added Madame Cropole, already in\npromiscuous commentary with her neighbors of both sexes.\n\nCropole was feeding their gossip with his own personal remarks, without\nobserving that an old man on foot, but leading a small Irish horse by\nthe bridle, was endeavoring to penetrate the crowd of men and women\nwhich blocked up the entrance to the _Medici_. But at that moment the\nvoice of the stranger was heard from the window.\n\n\"Make way, monsieur l'hotelier, to the entrance of your house!\"\n\nCropole turned around, and, on seeing the old man, cleared a passage for\nhim.\n\nThe window was instantly closed.\n\nPittrino pointed out the way to the newly-arrived guest, who entered\nwithout uttering a word.\n\nThe stranger waited for him on the landing; he opened his arms to the\nold man, and led him to a seat.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, my lord!\" said he. \"Sit down in your presence?--never!\"\n\n\"Parry,\" cried the gentleman, \"I beg you will; you come from\nEngland--you come so far. Ah! it is not for your age to undergo the\nfatigues my service requires. Rest yourself.\"\n\n\"I have my reply to give your lordship, in the first place.\"\n\n\"Parry, I conjure you to tell me nothing; for if your news had been\ngood, you would not have begun in such a manner; you go about, which\nproves that the news is bad.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said the old man, \"do not hasten to alarm yourself; all\nis not lost, I hope. You must employ energy, but more particularly\nresignation.\"\n\n\"Parry,\" said the young man, \"I have reached this place through a\nthousand snares and after a thousand difficulties; can you doubt\nmy energy? I have meditated this journey ten years, in spite of all\ncounsels and all obstacles--have you faith in my perseverance? I have\nthis evening sold the last of my father's diamonds; for I had nothing\nwherewith to pay for my lodgings and my host was about to turn me out.\"\n\nParry made a gesture of indignation, to which the young man replied by a\npressure of the hand and a smile.\n\n\"I have still two hundred and seventy-four pistoles left and I feel\nmyself rich. I do not despair, Parry; have you faith in my resignation?\"\n\nThe old man raised his trembling hands towards heaven.\n\n\"Let me know,\" said the stranger,--\"disguise nothing from me--what has\nhappened?\"\n\n\"My recital will be short, my lord; but in the name of Heaven do not\ntremble so.\"\n\n\"It is impatience, Parry. Come, what did the general say to you?\"\n\n\"At first the general would not receive me.\"\n\n\"He took you for a spy?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; but I wrote him a letter.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He read it, and received me, my lord.\"\n\n\"Did that letter thoroughly explain my position and my views?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Parry, with a sad smile; \"it painted your very thoughts\nfaithfully.\"\n\n\"Well--then, Parry.\"\n\n\"Then the general sent me back the letter by an aide-de-camp, informing\nme that if I were found the next day within the circumscription of his\ncommand, he would have me arrested.\"\n\n\"Arrested!\" murmured the young man. \"What! arrest you, my most faithful\nservant?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"And notwithstanding you had signed the name _Parry?_\"\n\n\"To all my letters, my lord; and the aide-de-camp had known me at St.\nJames's and at Whitehall, too,\" added the old man with a sigh.\n\nThe young man leaned forward, thoughtful and sad.\n\n\n\"Ay, that's what he did before his people,\" said he, endeavoring to\ncheat himself with hopes. \"But, privately--between you and him--what did\nhe do? Answer!\"\n\n\"Alas! my lord, he sent to me four cavaliers, who gave me the horse with\nwhich you just now saw me come back. These cavaliers conducted me, in\ngreat haste, to the little port of Tenby, threw me, rather than embarked\nme, into a little fishing-boat, about to sail for Brittany, and here I\nam.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" sighed the young man, clasping his neck convulsively with his\nhand, and with a sob. \"Parry, is that all?--is that all?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; that is all.\"\n\nAfter this brief reply ensued a long interval of silence, broken only by\nthe convulsive beating of the heel of the young man on the floor.\n\nThe old man endeavored to change the conversation; it was leading to\nthoughts much too sinister.\n\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"what is the meaning of all the noise which preceded\nme? What are these people crying '_Vive le Roi!_' for? What king do they\nmean? and what are all these lights for?\"\n\n\"Ah! Parry,\" replied the young man ironically, \"don't you know that\nthis is the King of France visiting his good city of Blois? All these\ntrumpets are his, all those gilded housings are his, all those gentlemen\nwear swords that are his. His mother precedes him in a carriage\nmagnificently encrusted with silver and gold. Happy mother! His minister\nheaps up millions, and conducts him to a rich bride. Then all these\npeople rejoice; they love their king, they hail him with their\nacclamations, and they cry, '_Vive le Roi! Vive le Roi!_'\"\n\n\"Well, well, my lord,\" said Parry, more uneasy at the turn the\nconversation had taken than at the other.\n\n\"You know,\" resumed the unknown, \"that _my_ mother and _my_ sister,\nwhilst all this is going on in honor of the King of France, have neither\nmoney nor bread; you know that I myself shall be poor and degraded\nwithin a fortnight, when all Europe will become acquainted with what\nyou have told me. Parry, are there not examples in which a man of my\ncondition should himself--\"\n\n\"My lord, in the name of Heaven--\"\n\n\"You are right, Parry; I am a coward, and if I do nothing for myself,\nwhat will God do? No, no; I have two arms, Parry, and I have a sword.\"\nAnd he struck his arm violently with his hand, and took down his sword,\nwhich hung against the wall.\n\n\"What are you going to do, my lord?\"\n\n\"What am I going to do, Parry? What every one in my family does. My\nmother lives on public charity, my sister begs for my mother; I have,\nsomewhere or other, brothers who equally beg for themselves; and I, the\neldest, will go and do as all the rest do--I will go and ask charity!\"\n\nAnd with these words, which he finished sharply with a nervous and\nterrible laugh, the young man girded on his sword, took his hat from\nthe trunk, fastened to his shoulder a black cloak, which he had worn\nall during his journey, and pressing the two hands of the old man, who\nwatched his proceedings with a look of anxiety,--\n\n\"My good Parry,\" said he, \"order a fire, drink, eat, sleep, and be\nhappy; let us both be happy, my faithful friend, my only friend. We are\nrich, as rich as kings!\"\n\nHe struck the bag of pistoles with his clenched hand as he spoke, and\nit fell heavily to the ground. He resumed that dismal laugh that had so\nalarmed Parry; and whilst the whole household was screaming, singing,\nand preparing to install the travelers who had been preceded by their\nlackeys, he glided out by the principal entrance into the street, where\nthe old man, who had gone to the window, lost sight of him in a moment.\n\n\n\nChapter VIII. What his Majesty King Louis XIV. was at the Age of\nTwenty-Two.\n\nIt has been seen, by the account we have endeavored to give of it, that\nthe _entree_ of King Louis XIV. into the city of Blois had been noisy\nand brilliant; his young majesty had therefore appeared perfectly\nsatisfied with it.\n\nOn arriving beneath the porch of the Castle of the States, the king met,\nsurrounded by his guards and gentlemen, with S. A. R. the duke, Gaston\nof Orleans, whose physiognomy, naturally rather majestic, had borrowed\non this solemn occasion a fresh luster and a fresh dignity. On her\npart, Madame, dressed in her robes of ceremony, awaited, in the interior\nbalcony, the entrance of her nephew. All the windows of the old castle,\nso deserted and dismal on ordinary days, were resplendent with ladies\nand lights.\n\nIt was then to the sound of drums, trumpets, and _vivats_, that the\nyoung king crossed the threshold of that castle in which, seventy-two\nyears before, Henry III. had called in the aid of assassination and\ntreachery to keep upon his head and in his house a crown which was\nalready slipping from his brow, to fall into another family.\n\nAll eyes, after having admired the young king, so handsome and so\nagreeable, sought for that other king of France, much otherwise king\nthan the former, and so old, so pale, so bent, that people called the\nCardinal Mazarin.\n\nLouis was at this time endowed with all the natural gifts which make\nthe perfect gentleman; his eye was brilliant, mild, and of a clear azure\nblue. But the most skillful physiognomists, those divers into the soul,\non fixing their looks upon it, if it had been possible for a subject to\nsustain the glance of the king,--the most skillful physiognomists, we\nsay, would never have been able to fathom the depths of that abyss of\nmildness. It was with the eyes of the king as with the immense depths of\nthe azure heavens, or with those more terrific, and almost as sublime,\nwhich the Mediterranean reveals under the keels of its ships in a\nclear summer day, a gigantic mirror in which heaven delights to reflect\nsometimes its stars, sometimes its storms.\n\nThe king was short of stature--he was scarcely five feet two inches: but\nhis youth made up for this defect, set off likewise by great nobleness\nin all his movements, and by considerable address in all bodily\nexercises.\n\nCertes, he was already quite a king, and it was a great thing to be a\nking in that period of traditional devotedness and respect; but as,\nup to that time, he had been but seldom and always poorly shown to the\npeople, as they to whom he was shown saw him by the side of his mother,\na tall woman, and monsieur le cardinal, a man of commanding presence,\nmany found him so little of a king as to say,--\n\n\"Why, the king is not so tall as monsieur le cardinal!\"\n\nWhatever may be thought of these physical observations, which were\nprincipally made in the capital, the young king was welcomed as a god by\nthe inhabitants of Blois, and almost like a king by his uncle and aunt,\nMonsieur and Madame, the inhabitants of the castle.\n\nIt must, however, be allowed, that when he saw, in the hall of\nreception, chairs of equal height for himself, his mother, the cardinal,\nand his uncle and aunt, a disposition artfully concealed by the\nsemi-circular form of the assembly, Louis XIV. became red with anger,\nand looked around him to ascertain by the countenances of those that\nwere present, if this humiliation had been prepared for him. But as he\nsaw nothing upon the impassible visage of the cardinal, nothing on that\nof his mother, nothing on those of the assembly, he resigned himself,\nand sat down, taking care to be seated before anybody else.\n\nThe gentlemen and ladies were presented to their majesties and monsieur\nle cardinal.\n\nThe king remarked that his mother and he scarcely knew the names of any\nof the persons who were presented to them; whilst the cardinal, on the\ncontrary, never failed, with an admirable memory and presence of mind,\nto talk to every one about his estates, his ancestors, or his children,\nsome of whom he named, which enchanted those worthy country gentlemen,\nand confirmed them in the idea that he alone is truly king who knows his\nsubjects, from the same reason that the sun has no rival, because the\nsun alone warms and lightens.\n\nThe study of the young king, which had begun a long time before, without\nanybody suspecting it, was continued then, and he looked around him\nattentively to endeavor to make out something in the physiognomies which\nhad at first appeared the most insignificant and trivial.\n\nA collation was served. The king, without daring to call upon the\nhospitality of his uncle, had waited for it impatiently. This time,\ntherefore, he had all the honors due, if not to his rank, at least to\nhis appetite.\n\nAs to the cardinal, he contented himself with touching with his withered\nlips a _bouillon_, served in a golden cup. The all-powerful minister,\nwho had taken her regency from the queen, and his royalty from the king,\nhad not been able to take a good stomach from nature.\n\nAnne of Austria, already suffering from the cancer which six or eight\nyears after caused her death, ate very little more than the cardinal.\n\nFor Monsieur, already puffed up with the great event which had taken\nplace in his provincial life, he ate nothing whatever.\n\nMadame alone, like a true Lorrainer, kept pace with his majesty; so that\nLouis XIV., who, without this partner, might have eaten nearly alone,\nwas at first much pleased with his aunt, and afterwards with M. de\nSaint-Remy, her _maitre d'hotel_, who had really distinguished himself.\n\nThe collation over, at a sign of approbation from M. de Mazarin, the\nking arose, and, at the invitation of his aunt, walked about among the\nranks of the assembly.\n\nThe ladies then observed--there are certain things for which women are\nas good observers at Blois as at Paris--the ladies then observed that\nLouis XIV. had a prompt and bold look, which premised a distinguished\nappreciator of beauty. The men, on their part, observed that the prince\nwas proud and haughty, that he loved to look down those who fixed their\neyes upon him too long or too earnestly, which gave presage of a master.\n\nLouis XIV. had accomplished about a third of his review when his ears\nwere struck with a word which his eminence pronounced whilst conversing\nwith Monsieur.\n\nThis word was the name of a woman.\n\nScarcely had Louis XIV. heard this word than he heard, or rather\nlistening to nothing else; and neglecting the arc of the circle which\nawaited his visit, his object seemed to be to come as quickly as\npossible to the extremity of the curve.\n\nMonsieur, like a good courtier, was inquiring of monsieur le cardinal\nafter the health of his nieces; he regretted, he said, not having the\npleasure of receiving them at the same time with their uncle; they must\ncertainly have grown in stature, beauty and grace, as they had promised\nto do the last time Monsieur had seen them.\n\nWhat had first struck the king was a certain constraint in the voices of\nthe two interlocutors. The voice of Monsieur was calm and natural when\nhe spoke thus; while that of M. de Mazarin jumped by a note and a half\nto reply above the diapason of his usual voice. It might have been said\nthat he wished that voice to strike, at the end of the _salon_, any ear\nthat was too distant.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" replied he, \"Mesdemoiselles de Mazarin have still to\nfinish their education: they have duties to fulfill, and a position to\nmake. An abode in a young and brilliant court would dissipate them a\nlittle.\"\n\nLouis, at this last sentence, smiled sadly. The court was young, it was\ntrue, but the avarice of the cardinal had taken good care that it should\nnot be brilliant.\n\n\"You have nevertheless no intention,\" replied Monsieur, \"to cloister\nthem or make them _borgeoises?_\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied the cardinal, forcing his Italian pronunciation in\nsuch a manner that, from soft and velvety as it was, it became sharp and\nvibrating; \"not at all: I have a full and fixed intention to marry them,\nand that as well as I shall be able.\"\n\n\"Parties will not be wanting, monsieur le cardinal,\" replied Monsieur,\nwith a _bonhomie_ worthy of one tradesman congratulating another.\n\n\"I hope not, monseigneur, and with reason, as God has been pleased to\ngive them grace, intelligence, and beauty.\"\n\nDuring this conversation, Louis XIV., conducted by Madame, accomplished,\nas we have described, the circle of presentations.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Auricule,\" said the princess, presenting to his majesty\na fat, fair girl of two-and-twenty, who at a village _fete_ might\nhave been taken for a peasant in Sunday finery,--\"the daughter of my\nmusic-mistress.\"\n\nThe king smiled. Madame had never been able to extract four correct\nnotes from either viol or harpsichord.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais,\" continued Madame; \"a young lady of\nrank, and my good attendant.\"\n\nThis time it was not the king that smiled; it was the young lady\npresented, because, for the first time in her life, she heard, given to\nher by Madame, who generally showed no tendency to spoil her, such an\nhonorable qualification.\n\nOur old acquaintance Montalais, therefore, made his majesty a profound\ncourtesy, the more respectful from the necessity she was under of\nconcealing certain contractions of her laughing lips, which the king\nmight not have attributed to their real cause.\n\nIt was just at this moment that the king caught the word which startled\nhim.\n\n\"And the name of the third?\" asked Monsieur.\n\n\"Mary, monseigneur,\" replied the cardinal.\n\nThere was doubtless some magical influence in that word, for, as we have\nsaid, the king started in hearing it, and drew Madame towards the middle\nof the circle, as if he wished to put some confidential question to her,\nbut, in reality, for the sake of getting nearer to the cardinal.\n\n\"Madame, my aunt,\" said he, laughing, and in a suppressed voice, \"my\ngeography-master did not teach me that Blois was at such an immense\ndistance from Paris.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, nephew?\" asked Madame.\n\n\"Why, because it would appear that it requires several years, as regards\nfashion, to travel the distance!--Look at those young ladies!\"\n\n\"Well; I know them all.\"\n\n\"Some of them are pretty.\"\n\n\"Don't say that too loud, monsieur my nephew; you will drive them wild.\"\n\n\"Stop a bit, stop a bit, dear aunt!\" said the king, smiling; \"for the\nsecond part of my sentence will serve as a corrective to the first.\nWell, my dear aunt, some of them appear old and others ugly, thanks to\ntheir ten-year-old fashions.\"\n\n\"But, sire, Blois is only five days' journey from Paris.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is it,\" said the king: \"two years behind for each day.\"\n\n\"Indeed! do you really think so? Well, that is strange! It never struck\nme.\"\n\n\"Now, look, aunt,\" said Louis XIV., drawing still nearer to Mazarin,\nunder the pretext of gaining a better point of view, \"look at that\nsimple white dress by the side of those antiquated specimens of finery,\nand those pretentious coiffures. She is probably one of my mother's\nmaids of honor, though I don't know her.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah! my dear nephew!\" replied Madame, laughing; \"permit me to tell\nyou that your divinatory science is at fault for once. The young lady\nyou honor with your praise is not a Parisian, but a Blaisoise.\"\n\n\"Oh, aunt!\" replied the king with a look of doubt.\n\n\"Come here, Louise,\" said Madame.\n\nAnd the fair girl, already known to you under that name, approached\nthem, timid, blushing, and almost bent beneath the royal glance.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Louise Francoise de la Beaume le Blanc, the daughter of\nthe Marquise de la Valliere,\" said Madame, ceremoniously.\n\nThe young girl bowed with so much grace, mingled with the profound\ntimidity inspired by the presence of the king, that the latter lost,\nwhile looking at her, a few words of the conversation of Monsieur and\nthe cardinal.\n\n\"Daughter-in-law,\" continued Madame, \"of M. de Saint-Remy, my _maitre\nd'hotel_, who presided over the confection of that excellent _daube\ntruffee_ which your majesty seemed so much to appreciate.\"\n\nNo grace, no youth, no beauty, could stand out against such a\npresentation. The king smiled. Whether the words of Madame were a\npleasantry, or uttered in all innocency, they proved the pitiless\nimmolation of everything that Louis had found charming or poetic in the\nyoung girl. Mademoiselle de la Valliere, for Madame and, by rebound,\nfor the king, was, for a moment, no more than the daughter of a man of a\nsuperior talent over _dindes truffees_.\n\nBut princes are thus constituted. The gods, too, were just like this\nin Olympus. Diana and Venus, no doubt, abused the beautiful Alcmena and\npoor Io, when they condescended for distraction's sake, to speak, amidst\nnectar and ambrosia, of mortal beauties, at the table of Jupiter.\n\nFortunately, Louise was so bent in her reverential salute, that she did\nnot catch either Madame's words or the king's smile. In fact, if the\npoor child, who had so much good taste as alone to have chosen to dress\nherself in white amidst all her companions--if that dove's heart, so\neasily accessible to painful emotions, had been touched by the cruel\nwords of Madame, or the egotistical cold smile of the king, it would\nhave annihilated her.\n\nAnd Montalais herself, the girl of ingenious ideas, would not have\nattempted to recall her to life; for ridicule kills beauty even.\n\nBut fortunately, as we have said, Louise, whose ears were buzzing, and\nher eyes veiled by timidity,--Louise saw nothing and heard nothing; and\nthe king, who had still his attention directed to the conversation of\nthe cardinal and his uncle, hastened to return to them.\n\nHe came up just at the moment Mazarin terminated by saying: \"Mary, as\nwell as her sisters, has just set off for Brouage. I make them follow\nthe opposite bank of the Loire to that along which we have traveled; and\nif I calculate their progress correctly, according to the orders I have\ngiven, they will to-morrow be opposite Blois.\"\n\nThese words were pronounced with that tact--that measure, that\ndistinctness of tone, of intention, and reach--which made _del Signor\nGiulio Mazarini_ the first comedian in the world.\n\nIt resulted that they went straight to the heart of Louis XIV., and\nthe cardinal, on turning round at the simple noise of the approaching\nfootsteps of his majesty, saw the immediate effect of them upon the\ncountenance of his pupil, an effect betrayed to the keen eyes of his\neminence by a slight increase of color. But what was the ventilation of\nsuch a secret to him whose craft had for twenty years deceived all the\ndiplomatists of Europe?\n\nFrom the moment the young king heard these last words, he appeared as if\nhe had received a poisoned arrow in his heart. He could not remain quiet\nin a place, but cast around an uncertain, dead, and aimless look over\nthe assembly. He with his eyes interrogated his mother more than\ntwenty times: but she, given up to the pleasure of conversing with her\nsister-in-law, and likewise constrained by the glance of Mazarin, did\nnot appear to comprehend any of the supplications conveyed by the looks\nof her son.\n\nFrom this moment, music, lights, flowers, beauties, all became odious\nand insipid to Louis XIV. After he had a hundred times bitten his lips,\nstretched his legs and his arms like a well-brought-up child, who,\nwithout daring to gape, exhausts all the modes of evincing his\nweariness--after having uselessly again implored his mother and the\nminister, he turned a despairing look towards the door, that is to say,\ntowards liberty.\n\nAt this door, in the embrasure of which he was leaning, he saw, standing\nout strongly, a figure with a brown and lofty countenance, an aquiline\nnose, a stern but brilliant eye, gray and long hair, a black mustache,\nthe true type of military beauty, whose gorget, more sparkling than a\nmirror, broke all the reflected lights which concentrated upon it, and\nsent them back as lightning. This officer wore his gray hat with its\nlong red plumes upon his head, a proof that he was called there by his\nduty, and not by his pleasure. If he had been brought thither by his\npleasure--if he had been a courtier instead of a soldier, as pleasure\nmust always be paid for at the same price--he would have held his hat in\nhis hand.\n\nThat which proved still better that this officer was upon duty, and was\naccomplishing a task to which he was accustomed, was, that he watched,\nwith folded arms, remarkable indifference, and supreme apathy, the joys\nand _ennuis_ of this _fete_. Above all, he appeared, like a philosopher,\nand all old soldiers are philosophers,--he appeared above all to\ncomprehend the _ennuis_ infinitely better than the joys; but in the one\nhe took his part, knowing very well how to do without the other.\n\nNow, he was leaning, as we have said, against the carved door-frame when\nthe melancholy, weary eyes of the king, by chance, met his.\n\nIt was not the first time, as it appeared, that the eyes of the officer\nhad met those eyes, and he was perfectly acquainted with the expression\nof them; for, as soon as he had cast his own look upon the countenance\nof Louis XIV., and had read by it what was passing in his heart--that is\nto say, all the _ennui_ that oppressed him--all the timid desire to go\nout which agitated him,--he perceived he must render the king a\nservice without his commanding it,--almost in spite of himself. Boldly,\ntherefore, as if he had given the word of command to cavalry in battle,\n\"On the king's service!\" cried he, in a clear, sonorous voice.\n\nAt these words, which produced the effect of a peal of thunder,\nprevailing over the orchestra, the singing and the buzz of the\npromenaders, the cardinal and the queen-mother looked at each other with\nsurprise.\n\nLouis XIV., pale, but resolved, supported as he was by that intuition\nof his own thought which he had found in the mind of the officer of\nmusketeers, and which he had just manifested by the order given, arose\nfrom his chair, and took a step towards the door.\n\n\"Are you going, my son?\" said the queen, whilst Mazarin satisfied\nhimself with interrogating by a look which might have appeared mild if\nit had not been so piercing.\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" replied the king; \"I am fatigued, and, besides, wish to\nwrite this evening.\"\n\nA smile stole over the lips of the minister, who appeared, by a bend of\nthe head, to give the king permission.\n\nMonsieur and Madame hastened to give orders to the officers who\npresented themselves.\n\nThe king bowed, crossed the hall, and gained the door, where a hedge of\ntwenty musketeers awaited him. At the extremity of this hedge stood the\nofficer, impassible, with his drawn sword in his hand. The king passed,\nand all the crowd stood on tip-toe, to have one more look at him.\n\nTen musketeers, opening the crowd of the ante-chambers and the steps,\nmade way for his majesty. The other ten surrounded the king and\nMonsieur, who had insisted upon accompanying his majesty. The domestics\nwalked behind. This little _cortege_ escorted the king to the chamber\ndestined for him. The apartment was the same that had been occupied by\nHenry III. during his sojourn in the States.\n\nMonsieur had given his orders. The musketeers, led by their officer,\ntook possession of the little passage by which one wing of the castle\ncommunicates with the other. This passage was commenced by a small\nsquare ante-chamber, dark even in the finest days. Monsieur stopped\nLouis XIV.\n\n\"You are passing now, sire,\" said he, \"the very spot where the Duc de\nGuise received the first stab of the poniard.\"\n\nThe king was ignorant of all historical matters; he had heard of the\nfact, but he knew nothing of the localities or the details.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he with a shudder.\n\nAnd he stopped. The rest, both behind and before him, stopped likewise.\n\n\"The duc, sire,\" continued Gaston, \"was nearly were I stand: he was\nwalking in the same direction as your majesty; M. de Loignac was exactly\nwhere your lieutenant of musketeers is; M. de Saint-Maline and his\nmajesty's ordinaries were behind him and around him. It was here that he\nwas struck.\"\n\nThe king turned towards his officer, and saw something like a cloud pass\nover his martial and daring countenance.\n\n\"Yes, from behind!\" murmured the lieutenant, with a gesture of supreme\ndisdain. And he endeavored to resume the march, as if ill at ease at\nbeing between walls formerly defiled by treachery.\n\nBut the king, who appeared to wish to be informed, was disposed to give\nanother look at this dismal spot.\n\nGaston perceived his nephew's desire.\n\n\"Look, sire,\" said he, taking a flambeaux from the hands of M. de\nSaint-Remy, \"this is where he fell. There was a bed there, the curtains\nof which he tore with catching at them.\"\n\n\"Why does the floor seem hollowed out at this spot?\" asked Louis.\n\n\"Because it was here the blood flowed,\" replied Gaston; \"the blood\npenetrated deeply into the oak, and it was only by cutting it out that\nthey succeeded in making it disappear. And even then,\" added Gaston,\npointing the flambeaux to the spot, \"even then this red stain resisted\nall the attempts made to destroy it.\"\n\nLouis XIV. raised his head. Perhaps he was thinking of that bloody trace\nthat had once been shown him at the Louvre, and which, as a pendant to\nthat of Blois, had been made there one day by the king his father with\nthe blood of Concini.\n\n\"Let us go on,\" said he.\n\nThe march was resumed promptly; for emotion, no doubt, had given to the\nvoice of the young prince a tone of command which was not customary\nwith him. When he arrived at the apartment destined for the king, which\ncommunicated not only with the little passage we have passed through,\nbut further with the great staircase leading to the court,--\n\n\"Will your majesty,\" said Gaston, \"condescend to occupy this apartment,\nall unworthy as it is to receive you?\"\n\n\"Uncle,\" replied the young king, \"I render you my thanks for your\ncordial hospitality.\"\n\nGaston bowed to his nephew, embraced him, and then went out.\n\nOf the twenty musketeers who had accompanied the king, ten\nreconducted Monsieur to the reception-rooms, which were not yet empty,\nnotwithstanding the king had retired.\n\nThe ten others were posted by their officer, who himself explored, in\nfive minutes, all the localities, with that cold and certain glance\nwhich not even habit gives unless that glance belongs to genius.\n\nThen, when all were placed, he chose as his headquarters the\nante-chamber, in which he found a large _fauteuil_, a lamp, some wine,\nsome water, and some dry bread.\n\nHe refreshed his lamp, drank half a glass of wine, curled his lip with\na smile full of expression, installed himself in his large armchair, and\nmade preparations for sleeping.\n\n\n\nChapter IX. In which the Unknown of the Hostelry of Les Medici loses his\nIncognito.\n\nThis officer, who was sleeping, or preparing to sleep, was,\nnotwithstanding his careless air, charged with a serious responsibility.\n\nLieutenant of the king's musketeers, he commanded all the company which\ncame from Paris, and that company consisted of a hundred and twenty men;\nbut, with the exception of the twenty of whom we have spoken, the other\nhundred were engaged in guarding the queen-mother, and more particularly\nthe cardinal.\n\nMonsignor Giulio Mazarini economized the traveling expenses of his\nguards; he consequently used the king's, and that largely, since he took\nfifty of them for himself--a peculiarity which would not have failed to\nstrike any one unacquainted with the usages of that court.\n\nThat which would still further have appeared, if not inconvenient, at\nleast extraordinary, to a stranger, was, that the side of the castle\ndestined for monsieur le cardinal was brilliant, light and cheerful. The\nmusketeers there mounted guard before every door, and allowed no one to\nenter, except the couriers, who, even while he was traveling, followed\nthe cardinal for the carrying on of his correspondence.\n\nTwenty men were on duty with the queen-mother; thirty rested, in order\nto relieve their companions the next day.\n\nOn the king's side, on the contrary, were darkness, silence, and\nsolitude. When once the doors were closed, there was no longer an\nappearance of royalty. All the servitors had by degrees retired.\nMonsieur le Prince had sent to know if his majesty required his\nattendance; and on the customary \"_No_\" of the lieutenant of musketeers,\nwho was habituated to the question and the reply, all appeared to sink\ninto the arms of sleep, as if in the dwelling of a good citizen.\n\nAnd yet it was possible to hear from the side of the house occupied by\nthe young king the music of the banquet, and to see the windows of the\ngreat hall richly illuminated.\n\nTen minutes after his installation in his apartment, Louis XIV. had been\nable to learn, by movement much more distinguished than marked his own\nleaving, the departure of the cardinal, who, in his turn, sought his\nbedroom, accompanied by a large escort of ladies and gentlemen.\n\nBesides, to perceive this movement, he had nothing to do but look out at\nhis window, the shutters of which had not been closed.\n\nHis eminence crossed the court, conducted by Monsieur, who himself held\na flambeau; then followed the queen-mother, to whom Madame familiarly\ngave her arm; and both walked chatting away, like two old friends.\n\nBehind these two couples filed nobles, ladies, pages and officers; the\nflambeaux gleamed over the whole court, like the moving reflections of\na conflagration. Then the noise of steps and voices became lost in the\nupper floors of the castle.\n\nNo one was then thinking of the king, who, leaning on his elbow at his\nwindow, had sadly seen pass away all that light, and heard that noise\ndie off--no, not one, if it was not that unknown of the hostelry _des\nMedici_, whom we have seen go out, enveloped in his cloak.\n\nHe had come straight up to the castle, and had, with his melancholy\ncountenance, wandered round and round the palace, from which the\npeople had not yet departed; and finding that on one guarded the great\nentrance, or the porch, seeing that the soldiers of Monsieur were\nfraternizing with the royal soldiers--that is to say, swallowing\nBeaugency at discretion, or rather indiscretion--the unknown penetrated\nthrough the crowd, then ascended to the court, and came to the landing\nof the staircase leading to the cardinal's apartment.\n\nWhat, according to all probability, induced him to direct his steps that\nway, was the splendor of the flambeaux, and the busy air of the pages\nand domestics. But he was stopped short by a presented musket and the\ncry of the sentinel.\n\n\"Where are you going, my friend?\" asked the soldier.\n\n\"I am going to the king's apartment,\" replied the unknown, haughtily,\nbut tranquilly.\n\nThe soldier called one of his eminence's officers, who, in the tone\nin which a youth in office directs a solicitor to a minister, let fall\nthese words: \"The other staircase, in front.\"\n\nAnd the officer, without further notice of the unknown, resumed his\ninterrupted conversation.\n\nThe stranger, without reply, directed his steps towards the staircase\npointed out to him. On this side there was no noise, there were no more\nflambeaux.\n\nObscurity, through which a sentinel glided like a shadow; silence, which\npermitted him to hear the sound of his own footsteps, accompanied with\nthe jingling of his spurs upon the stone slabs.\n\nThis guard was one of the twenty musketeers appointed for attendance\nupon the king, and who mounted guard with the stiffness and\nconsciousness of a statue.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" said the guard.\n\n\"A friend,\" replied the unknown.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"To speak to the king.\"\n\n\"Do you, my dear monsieur? That's not very likely.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because the king has gone to bed.\"\n\n\"Gone to bed already?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"No matter: I must speak to him.\"\n\n\"And I tell you that is impossible.\"\n\n\"And yet--\"\n\n\"Go back!\"\n\n\"Do you require the word?\"\n\n\"I have no account to render to you. Stand back!\"\n\nAnd this time the soldier accompanied his word with a threatening\ngesture; but the unknown stirred no more than if his feet had taken\nroot.\n\n\"Monsieur le mousquetaire,\" said he, \"are you a gentleman?\"\n\n\"I have that honor.\"\n\n\"Very well! I also am one; and between gentlemen some consideration\nought to be observed.\"\n\nThe soldier lowered his arms, overcome by the dignity with which these\nwords were pronounced.\n\n\"Speak, monsieur,\" said he; \"and if you ask me anything in my power--\"\n\n\"Thank you. You have an officer, have you not?\"\n\n\"Our lieutenant? Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, I wish to speak to him.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's a different thing. Come up, monsieur.\"\n\nThe unknown saluted the soldier in a lofty fashion, and ascended\nthe staircase; whilst a cry, \"Lieutenant, a visit!\" transmitted from\nsentinel to sentinel, preceded the unknown, and disturbed the slumbers\nof the officer.\n\nDragging on his boot, rubbing his eyes, and hooking his cloak, the\nlieutenant made three steps towards the stranger.\n\n\"What can I do to serve you, monsieur?\" asked he.\n\n\"You are the officer on duty, lieutenant of the musketeers, are you?\"\n\n\"I have that honor,\" replied the officer.\n\n\"Monsieur, I must absolutely speak to the king.\"\n\nThe lieutenant looked attentively at the unknown, and in that look, he\nsaw all he wished to see--that is to say, a person of high distinction\nin an ordinary dress.\n\n\"I do not suppose you to be mad,\" replied he; \"and yet you seem to me to\nbe in a condition to know, monsieur, that people do not enter a king's\napartments in this manner without his consent.\"\n\n\"He will consent.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, permit me to doubt that. The king has retired this quarter of\nan hour; he must be now undressing. Besides, the word is given.\"\n\n\"When he knows who I am, he will recall the word.\"\n\nThe officer was more and more surprised, more and more subdued.\n\n\"If I consent to announce you, may I at least know whom to announce,\nmonsieur?\"\n\n\"You will announce His Majesty Charles II., King of England, Scotland,\nand Ireland.\"\n\nThe officer uttered a cry of astonishment, drew back, and there might be\nseen upon his pallid countenance one of the most poignant emotions that\never an energetic man endeavored to drive back to his heart.\n\n\"Oh, yes, sire; in fact,\" said he, \"I ought to have recognized you.\"\n\n\"You have seen my portrait, then?\"\n\n\"No, sire.\"\n\n\"Or else you have seen me formerly at court, before I was driven from\nFrance?\"\n\n\"No, sire, it is not even that.\"\n\n\"How then could you have recognized me, if you have never seen my\nportrait or my person?\"\n\n\"Sire, I saw his majesty your father at a terrible moment.\"\n\n\"The day--\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA dark cloud passed over the brow of the prince; then, dashing his hand\nacross it, \"Do you see any difficulty in announcing me?\" said he.\n\n\"Sire, pardon me,\" replied the officer, \"but I could not imagine a\nking under so simple an exterior; and yet I had the honor to tell your\nmajesty just now that I had seen Charles I. But pardon me, monsieur; I\nwill go and inform the king.\"\n\nBut returning after going a few steps, \"Your majesty is desirous,\nwithout doubt, that this interview should be a secret?\" said he.\n\n\"I do not require it; but if it were possible to preserve it--\"\n\n\"It is possible, sire, for I can dispense with informing the first\ngentleman on duty; but, for that, your majesty must please to consent to\ngive up your sword.\"\n\n\"True, true; I had forgotten that no one armed is permitted to enter the\nchamber of a king of France.\"\n\n\"Your majesty will form an exception, if you wish it; but then I shall\navoid my responsibility by informing the king's attendant.\"\n\n\"Here is my sword, monsieur. Will you now please to announce me to his\nmajesty?\"\n\n\"Instantly, sire.\" And the officer immediately went and knocked at the\ndoor of communication, which the valet opened to him.\n\n\"His Majesty the King of England!\" said the officer.\n\n\"His Majesty the King of England!\" replied the _valet de chambre_.\n\nAt these words a gentleman opened the folding-doors of the king's\napartment, and Louis XIV. was seen, without hat or sword, and his\n_pourpoint_ open, advancing with signs of the greatest surprise.\n\n\"You, my brother--you at Blois!\" cried Louis XIV., dismissing with a\ngesture both the gentlemen and the _valet de chambre_, who passed out\ninto the next apartment.\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Charles II., \"I was going to Paris, in the hope of\nseeing your majesty, when report informed me of your approaching arrival\nin this city. I therefore prolonged my abode here, having something very\nparticular to communicate to you.\"\n\n\"Will this closet suit you, my brother?\"\n\n\"Perfectly well, sire; for I think no one can hear us here.\"\n\n\"I have dismissed my gentleman and my watcher; they are in the next\nchamber. There, behind that partition, is a solitary closet, looking\ninto the ante-chamber, and in that ante-chamber you found nobody but a\nsolitary officer, did you?\"\n\n\"No, sire.\"\n\n\"Well, then, speak, my brother; I listen to you.\"\n\n\"Sire, I commence, and entreat your majesty to have pity on the\nmisfortunes of our house.\"\n\nThe king of France colored, and drew his chair closer to that of the\nking of England.\n\n\"Sire,\" said Charles II., \"I have no need to ask if your majesty is\nacquainted with the details of my deplorable history.\"\n\nLouis XIV. blushed, this time more strongly than before; then,\nstretching forth his hand to that of the king of England, \"My brother,\"\nsaid he, \"I am ashamed to say so, but the cardinal scarcely ever speaks\nof political affairs before me. Still more, formerly I used to get\nLaporte, my _valet de chambre_, to read historical subjects to me; but\nhe put a stop to these readings, and took away Laporte from me. So that\nI beg my brother Charles to tell me all those matters as to a man who\nknows nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, sire, I think that by taking things from the beginning I shall\nhave a better chance of touching the heart of your majesty.\"\n\n\"Speak on, my brother--speak on.\"\n\n\"You know, sire, that being called in 1650 to Edinburgh, during\nCromwell's expedition into Ireland, I was crowned at Scone. A year\nafter, wounded in one of the provinces he had usurped, Cromwell returned\nupon us. To meet him was my object; to leave Scotland was my wish.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" interrupted the young king, \"Scotland is almost your native\ncountry, is it not, my brother?\"\n\n\"Yes, but the Scots were cruel compatriots for me, sire; they had forced\nme to forsake the religion of my fathers; they had hung Lord Montrose,\nthe most devoted of my servants, because he was not a Covenanter; and as\nthe poor martyr, to whom they had offered a favor when dying, had asked\nthat his body might be cut into as many pieces as there are cities\nin Scotland, in order that evidence of his fidelity might be met with\neverywhere, I could not leave one city, or go into another, without\npassing under some fragments of a body which had acted, fought, and\nbreathed for me.\n\n\"By a bold, almost desperate march, I passed through Cromwell's army,\nand entered England. The Protector set out in pursuit of this strange\nflight, which had a crown for its object. If I had been able to reach\nLondon before him, without doubt the prize of the race would have been\nmine; but he overtook me at Worcester.\n\n\"The genius of England was no longer with us, but with him. On the 3rd\nof September, 1651, sire, the anniversary of the other battle of Dunbar,\nso fatal to the Scots, I was conquered. Two thousand men fell around me\nbefore I thought of retreating a step. At length I was obliged to fly.\n\n\"From that moment my history became a romance. Pursued with persistent\ninveteracy, I cut off my hair, I disguised myself as a woodman. One day\nspent amidst the branches of an oak gave to that tree the name of the\nroyal oak, which it bears to this day. My adventures in the county of\nStafford, whence I escaped with the daughter of my host on a pillion\nbehind me, still fill the tales of the country firesides, and would\nfurnish matter for ballads. I will some day write all this, sire, for\nthe instruction of my brother kings.\n\n\"I will first tell how, on arriving at the residence of Mr. Norton,\nI met with a court chaplain, who was looking on at a party playing at\nskittles, and an old servant who named me, bursting into tears, and who\nwas as near and as certainly killing me by his fidelity as another might\nhave been by treachery. Then I will tell of my terrors--yes, sire, of\nmy terrors--when, at the house of Colonel Windham, a farrier who came to\nshoe our horses declared they had been shod in the north.\"\n\n\"How strange!\" murmured Louis XIV. \"I never heard anything of all that;\nI was only told of your embarkation at Brighelmstone and your landing in\nNormandy.\" [1]\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Charles, \"if Heaven permits kings to be thus ignorant\nof the histories of each other, how can they render assistance to their\nbrothers who need it?\"\n\n\"But tell me,\" continued Louis XIV., \"how, after being so roughly\nreceived in England, you can still hope for anything from that unhappy\ncountry and that rebellious people?\"\n\n\"Oh, sire! since the battle of Worcester, everything is changed there.\nCromwell is dead, after having signed a treaty with France, in which\nhis name is placed above yours. He died on the 3rd of September, 1658, a\nfresh anniversary of the battles of Dunbar and Worcester.\"\n\n\"His son has succeeded him.\"\n\n\"But certain men have a family, sire, and no heir. The inheritance of\nOliver was too heavy for Richard. Richard was neither a republican nor a\nroyalist; Richard allowed his guards to eat his dinner, and his generals\nto govern the republic; Richard abdicated the protectorate on the 22nd\nof April, 1659, more than a year ago, sire.\n\n\"From that time England is nothing but a tennis-court, in which the\nplayers throw dice for the crown of my father. The two most eager\nplayers are Lambert and Monk. Well, sire, I, in my turn, wish to take\npart in this game, where the stakes are thrown upon my royal mantle.\nSire, it only requires a million to corrupt one of these players and\nmake an ally of him, or two hundred of your gentlemen to drive them out\nof my palace at Whitehall, as Christ drove the money-changers from the\ntemple.\"\n\n\"You come, then,\" replied Louis XIV., \"to ask me--\"\n\n\"For your assistance; that is to say, not only for that which kings owe\nto each other, but that which simple Christians owe to each other--your\nassistance, sire, either in money or men. Your assistance, sire, and\nwithin a month, whether I oppose Lambert to Monk, or Monk to Lambert, I\nshall have reconquered my paternal inheritance, without having cost my\ncountry a guinea, or my subjects a drop of blood, for they are now all\ndrunk with revolutions, protectorates, and republics, and ask nothing\nbetter than to fall staggering to sleep in the arms of royalty. Your\nassistance, sire, and I shall owe you more than I owe my father,--my\npoor father, who bought at so dear a rate the ruin of our house! You may\njudge, sire, whether I am unhappy, whether I am in despair, for I accuse\nmy own father!\"\n\nAnd the blood mounted to the pale face of Charles II., who remained for\nan instant with his head between his hands, and as if blinded by that\nblood which appeared to revolt against the filial blasphemy.\n\nThe young king was not less affected than his elder brother; he threw\nhimself about in his _fauteuil_, and could not find a single word of\nreply.\n\nCharles II., to whom ten years in age gave a superior strength to master\nhis emotions, recovered his speech the first.\n\n\"Sire,\" said he, \"your reply? I wait for it as a criminal waits for his\nsentence. Must I die?\"\n\n\"My brother,\" replied the French prince, \"you ask of me for a\nmillion--me, who was never possessed of a quarter of that sum! I possess\nnothing. I am no more king of France than you are king of England. I am\na name, a cipher dressed in _fleur-de-lised_ velvet,--that is all. I am\nupon a visible throne; that is my only advantage over your majesty. I\nhave nothing--I can do nothing.\"\n\n\"Can it be so?\" exclaimed Charles II.\n\n\"My brother,\" said Louis, sinking his voice, \"I have undergone miseries\nwith which my poorest gentlemen are unacquainted. If my poor Laporte\nwere here, he would tell you that I have slept in ragged sheets,\nthrough the holes of which my legs have passed; he would tell you that\nafterwards, when I asked for carriages, they brought me conveyances\nhalf-destroyed by the rats of the coach-houses; he would tell you that\nwhen I asked for my dinner, the servants went to the cardinal's kitchen\nto inquire if there were any dinner for the king. And look! to-day, this\nvery day even, when I am twenty-two years of age,--to-day, when I have\nattained the grade of the majority of kings,--to-day, when I ought to\nhave the key of the treasury, the direction of the policy, the supremacy\nin peace and war,--cast your eyes around me, see how I am left! Look\nat this abandonment--this disdain--this silence!--Whilst yonder--look\nyonder! View the bustle, the lights, the homage! There!--there you see\nthe real king of France, my brother!\"\n\n\"In the cardinal's apartments?\"\n\n\"Yes, in the cardinal's apartments.\"\n\n\"Then I am condemned, sire?\"\n\nLouis XIV. made no reply.\n\n\"Condemned is the word; for I will never solicit him who left my mother\nand sister to die with cold and hunger--the daughter and grand-daughter\nof Henry IV.--as surely they would have if M. de Retz and the parliament\nhad not sent them wood and bread.\"\n\n\"To die?\" murmured Louis XIV.\n\n\"Well!\" continued the king of England, \"poor Charles II., grandson of\nHenry IV., as you are, sire having neither parliament nor Cardinal\nde Retz to apply to, will die of hunger, as his mother and sister had\nnearly done.\"\n\nLouis knitted his brow, and twisted violently the lace of his ruffles.\n\nThis prostration, this immobility, serving as a mark to an emotion so\nvisible, struck Charles II., and he took the young man's hand.\n\n\"Thanks!\" said he, \"my brother. You pity me, and that is all I can\nrequire of you in your present situation.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Louis XIV., with a sudden impulse, and raising his head,\n\"it is a million you require, or two hundred gentlemen, I think you\nsay?\"\n\n\"Sire, a million would be quite sufficient.\"\n\n\"That is very little.\"\n\n\"Offered to a single man it is a great deal. Convictions have been\npurchased at a much lower price; and I should have nothing to do but\nwith venalities.\"\n\n\"Two hundred gentlemen! Reflect!--that is little more than a single\ncompany.\"\n\n\"Sire, there is in our family a tradition, and that is, that four men,\nfour French gentlemen, devoted to my father, were near saving my father,\nthough condemned by a parliament, guarded by an army and surrounded by a\nnation.\"\n\n\"Then if I can procure you a million, or two hundred gentlemen, you will\nbe satisfied; and you will consider me your well-affectioned brother?\"\n\n\"I shall consider you as my saviour; and if I recover the throne of my\nfather, England will be, as long as I reign it, a sister to France, as\nyou will have been a brother to me.\"\n\n\"Well, my brother,\" said Louis, rising, \"what you hesitate to ask for,\nI will myself demand; that which I have never done on my own account, I\nwill do on yours. I will go and find the king of France--the other--the\nrich, the powerful one, I mean. I will myself solicit this million, or\nthese two hundred gentlemen; and--we will see.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Charles; \"you are a noble friend, sire--a heart created by\nGod! You save me, my brother; and if you should ever stand in need of\nthe life you restored me, demand it.\"\n\n\"Silence, my brother,--silence!\" said Louis, in a suppressed voice.\n\"Take care that no one hears you! We have not obtained our end yet.\nTo ask money of Mazarin--that is worse than traversing the enchanted\nforest, each tree of which inclosed a demon. It is more than setting out\nto conquer a world.\"\n\n\"But yet, sire, when you ask it--\"\n\n\"I have already told you that I never asked,\" replied Louis with a\nhaughtiness that made the king of England turn pale.\n\nAnd the latter, like a wounded man, made a retreating movement--\"Pardon\nme, my brother,\" replied he. \"I have neither a mother nor a sister who\nare suffering. My throne is hard and naked, but I am firmly seated on\nmy throne. Pardon me that expression, my brother; it was that of an\negotist. I will retract it, therefore, by a sacrifice,--I will go to\nmonsieur le cardinal. Wait for me, if you please--I will return.\"\n\n\n\nChapter X. The Arithmetic of M. de Mazarin.\n\nWhilst the king was directing his course rapidly towards the wing of the\ncastle occupied by the cardinal, taking nobody with him but his _valet\nde chambre_, the officer of musketeers came out, breathing like a man\nwho has for a long time been forced to hold his breath, from the little\ncabinet of which we have already spoken, and which the king believed\nto be quite solitary. This little cabinet had formerly been part of\nthe chamber, from which it was only separated by a thin partition. It\nresulted that this partition, which was only for the eye, permitted the\near the least indiscreet to hear every word spoken in the chamber.\n\nThere was no doubt, then, that this lieutenant of musketeers had heard\nall that passed in his majesty's apartment.\n\nWarned by the last words of the young king, he came out just in time to\nsalute him on his passage, and to follow him with his eyes till he had\ndisappeared in the corridor.\n\nThen as soon as he had disappeared, he shook his head after a fashion\npeculiarly his own, and in a voice which forty years' absence from\nGascony had not deprived of its Gascon accent, \"A melancholy service,\"\nsaid he, \"and a melancholy master!\"\n\nThese words pronounced, the lieutenant resumed his place in his\n_fauteuil_, stretched his legs and closed his eyes, like a man who\neither sleeps or meditates.\n\nDuring this short monologue and the _mise en scene_ that had accompanied\nit, whilst the king, through the long corridors of the old castle,\nproceeded to the apartment of M. de Mazarin, a scene of another sort was\nbeing enacted in those apartments.\n\nMazarin was in bed, suffering a little from the gout. But as he was a\nman of order, who utilized even pain, he forced his wakefulness to be\nthe humble servant of his labor. He had consequently ordered Bernouin,\nhis _valet de chambre_, to bring him a little traveling-desk, so that he\nmight write in bed. But the gout is not an adversary that allows itself\nto be conquered so easily; therefore, at each movement he made, the pain\nfrom dull became sharp.\n\n\"Is Brienne there?\" asked he of Bernouin.\n\n\"No, monseigneur,\" replied the _valet de chambre_; \"M. de Brienne, with\nyour permission, is gone to bed. But if it is the wish of your eminence,\nhe can speedily be called.\"\n\n\"No, it is not worth while. Let us see, however. Cursed ciphers!\"\n\nAnd the cardinal began to think, counting on his fingers the while.\n\n\"Oh, ciphers is it?\" said Bernouin. \"Very well! if your eminence\nattempts calculations, I will promise you a pretty headache to-morrow!\nAnd with that please to remember M. Guenaud is not here.\"\n\n\"You are right, Bernouin. You must take Brienne's place, my friend.\nIndeed, I ought to have brought M. Colbert with me. That young man goes\non very well, Bernouin, very well; a very orderly youth.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" sad the _valet de chambre_, \"but I don't like the\ncountenance of your young man who goes on so well.\"\n\n\"Well, well, Bernouin! We don't stand in need of your advice. Place\nyourself there: take the pen and write.\"\n\n\"I am ready, monseigneur; what am I to write?\"\n\n\"There, that's the place: after the two lines already traced.\"\n\n\"I am there.\"\n\n\"Write seven hundred and sixty thousand livres.\"\n\n\"That is written.\"\n\n\"Upon Lyons--\" The cardinal appeared to hesitate.\n\n\"Upon Lyons,\" repeated Bernouin.\n\n\"Three millions nine hundred thousand livres.\"\n\n\"Well, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"Upon Bordeaux, seven millions.\"\n\n\"Seven?\" repeated Bernouin.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the cardinal, pettishly, \"seven.\" Then, recollecting\nhimself, \"You understand, Bernouin,\" added he, \"that all this money is\nto be spent?\"\n\n\"Eh! monseigneur; whether it be spent or put away is of very little\nconsequence to me, since none of these millions are mine.\"\n\n\"These millions are the king's; it is the king's money I am reckoning.\nWell, what were we saying? You always interrupt me!\"\n\n\"Seven millions upon Bordeaux.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes; that's right. Upon Madrid four millions. I give you to\nunderstand plainly to whom this money belongs, Bernouin, seeing that\neverybody has the stupidity to believe me rich in millions. I repel the\nsilly idea. A minister, besides, has nothing of his own. Come, go on.\n_Rentrees generales_, seven millions; properties, nine millions. Have\nyou written that, Bernouin?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"_Bourse_, six hundred thousand livres; various property, two millions.\nAh! I forgot--the furniture of the different chateaux--\"\n\n\"Must I put of the crown?\" asked Bernouin.\n\n\"No, no; it is of no use doing that--that is understood. Have you\nwritten that, Bernouin?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"And the ciphers?\"\n\n\"Stand straight under one another.\"\n\n\"Cast them up, Bernouin.\"\n\n\"Thirty-nine millions two hundred and sixty thousand livres,\nmonseigneur.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried the cardinal, in a tone of vexation; \"there are not yet\nforty millions!\"\n\nBernouin recommenced the addition.\n\n\"No, monseigneur; there want seven hundred and forty thousand livres.\"\n\nMazarin asked for the account, and revised it carefully.\n\n\"Yes, but,\" said Bernouin, \"thirty-nine millions two hundred and sixty\nthousand livres make a good round sum.\"\n\n\"Ah, Bernouin; I wish the king had it.\"\n\n\"Your eminence told me that this money was his majesty's.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, as clear, as transparent as possible. These thirty-nine\nmillions are bespoken, and much more.\"\n\nBernouin smiled after his own fashion--that is, like a man who believes\nno more than he is willing to believe--whilst preparing the cardinal's\nnight draught, and putting his pillow to rights.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mazarin, when the valet had gone out; \"not yet forty\nmillions! I must, however, attain that sum, which I had set down for\nmyself. But who knows whether I shall have time? I sink, I am going,\nI shall never reach it! And yet, who knows that I may not find two or\nthree millions in the pockets of my good friends the Spaniards? They\ndiscovered Peru, those people did, and--what the devil! they must have\nsomething left.\"\n\nAs he was speaking thus, entirely occupied with his ciphers, and\nthinking no more of his gout, repelled by a preoccupation which, with\nthe cardinal, was the most powerful of all preoccupations, Bernouin\nrushed into the chamber, quite in a fright.\n\n\"Well!\" asked the cardinal, \"what is the matter now?\"\n\n\"The king, monseigneur,--the king!\"\n\n\"How?--the king!\" said Mazarin, quickly concealing his paper. \"The king\nhere! the king at this hour! I thought he was in bed long ago. What is\nthe matter, then?\"\n\nThe king could hear these last words, and see the terrified gesture of\nthe cardinal rising up in his bed, for he entered the chamber at that\nmoment.\n\n\"It is nothing, monsieur le cardinal, or at least nothing which can\nalarm you. It is an important communication which I wish to make to your\neminence to-night,--that is all.\"\n\nMazarin immediately thought of that marked attention which the king\nhad given to his words concerning Mademoiselle de Mancini, and the\ncommunication appeared to him probably to refer to this source. He\nrecovered his serenity then instantly, and assumed his most agreeable\nair, a change of countenance which inspired the king with the greatest\njoy; and when Louis was seated,--\n\n\"Sire,\" said the cardinal, \"I ought certainly to listen to your majesty\nstanding, but the violence of my complaint--\"\n\n\"No ceremony between us, my dear monsieur le cardinal,\" said Louis\nkindly: \"I am your pupil, and not the king, you know very well, and this\nevening in particular, as I come to you as a petitioner, as a solicitor,\nand one very humble, and desirous to be kindly received, too.\"\n\nMazarin, seeing the heightened color of the king, was confirmed in his\nfirst idea; that is to say, that love thoughts were hidden under all\nthese fine words. This time, political cunning, as keen as it was, made\na mistake; this color was not caused by the bashfulness of a juvenile\npassion, but only by the painful contraction of the royal pride.\n\nLike a good uncle, Mazarin felt disposed to facilitate the confidence.\n\n\"Speak, sire,\" said he, \"and since your majesty is willing for an\ninstant to forget that I am your subject, and call me your master\nand instructor, I promise your majesty my most devoted and tender\nconsideration.\"\n\n\"Thanks, monsieur le cardinal,\" answered the king; \"that which I have to\nask of your eminence has but little to do with myself.\"\n\n\"So much the worse!\" replied the cardinal; \"so much the worse! Sire, I\nshould wish your majesty to ask of me something of importance, even a\nsacrifice; but whatever it may be that you ask me, I am ready to set\nyour heart at rest by granting it, my dear sire.\"\n\n\"Well, this is what brings me here,\" said the king, with a beating\nof the heart that had no equal except the beating of the heart of the\nminister; \"I have just received a visit from my brother, the king of\nEngland.\"\n\n        Mazarin bounded in his bed as if he had been put in relation with a\nLeyden jar or a voltaic pile, at the same time that a surprise, or\nrather a manifest disappointment, inflamed his features with such a\nblaze of anger, that Louis XIV., little diplomatist as he was, saw that\nthe minister had hoped to hear something else.\n\n\"Charles II.?\" exclaimed Mazarin, with a hoarse voice and a disdainful\nmovement of his lips. \"You have received a visit from Charles II.?\"\n\n\"From King Charles II.,\" replied Louis, according in a marked manner to\nthe grandson of Henry IV. the title which Mazarin had forgotten to give\nhim. \"Yes, monsieur le cardinal, that unhappy prince has touched my\nheart with the relation of his misfortunes. His distress is great,\nmonsieur le cardinal, and it has appeared painful to me, who have seen\nmy own throne disputed, who have been forced in times of commotion\nto quit my capital,--to me, in short, who am acquainted with\nmisfortune,--to leave a deposed and fugitive brother without\nassistance.\"\n\n\"Eh!\" said the cardinal, sharply; \"why had he not, as you have, a Jules\nMazarin by his side? His crown would then have remained intact.\"\n\n\"I know all that my house owes to your eminence,\" replied the king,\nhaughtily, \"and you may well believe that I, on my part, shall never\nforget it. It is precisely because my brother, the king of England has\nnot about him the powerful genius who has saved me, it is for that, I\nsay, that I wish to conciliate the aid of that same genius, and beg you\nto extend your arm over his head, well assured, monsieur le cardinal,\nthat your hand, by touching him only, would know how to replace upon his\nbrow the crown which fell at the foot of his father's scaffold.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Mazarin, \"I thank you for your good opinion with regard\nto myself, but we have nothing to do yonder: they are a set of madmen\nwho deny God, and cut off the heads of their kings. They are dangerous,\nobserve, sire, and filthy to the touch after having wallowed in royal\nblood and covenantal murder. That policy has never suited me,--I scorn\nit and reject it.\"\n\n\"Therefore you ought to assist in establishing a better.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"The restoration of Charles II., for example.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Mazarin, \"does the poor prince flatter himself\nwith that chimera?\"\n\n\"Yes, he does,\" replied the young king, terrified at the difficulties\nopposed to this project, which he fancied he could perceive in the\ninfallible eye of his minister; \"he only asks for a million to carry out\nhis purpose.\"\n\n\"Is that all--a little million, if you please!\" said the cardinal,\nironically, with an effort to conquer his Italian accent. \"A little\nmillion, if you please, brother! Bah! a family of mendicants!\"\n\n\"Cardinal,\" said Louis, raising his head, \"that family of mendicants is\na branch of my family.\"\n\n\"Are you rich enough to give millions to other people, sire? Have you\nmillions to throw away?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" replied Louis XIV., with great pain, which he, however, by a\nstrong effort, prevented from appearing on his countenance;--\"oh! yes,\nmonsieur le cardinal, I am well aware I am poor, and yet the crown of\nFrance is worth a million, and to perform a good action I would pledge\nmy crown if it were necessary. I could find Jews who would be willing to\nlend me a million.\"\n\n\"So, sire, you say you want a million?\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, I say so.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, greatly mistaken, sire; you want much more than\nthat,--Bernouin!--you shall see, sire, how much you really want.\"\n\n\"What, cardinal!\" said the king, \"are you going to consult a lackey\nabout my affairs?\"\n\n\"Bernouin!\" cried the cardinal again, without appearing to remark the\nhumiliation of the young prince. \"Come here, Bernouin, and tell me the\nfigures I gave you just now.\"\n\n\"Cardinal, cardinal! did you not hear me?\" said Louis, turning pale with\nanger.\n\n\"Do not be angry, sire; I deal openly with the affairs of your majesty.\nEvery one in France knows that; my books are as open as day. What did I\ntell you to do just now, Bernouin?\"\n\n\"Your eminence commanded me to cast up an account.\"\n\n\"You did it, did you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"To verify the amount of which his majesty, at this moment, stands in\nneed. Did I not tell you so? Be frank, my friend.\"\n\n\"Your eminence said so.\"\n\n\"Well, what sum did I say I wanted?\"\n\n\"Forty-five millions, I think.\"\n\n\"And what sum could we find, after collecting all our resources?\"\n\n\"Thirty-nine millions two hundred and sixty thousand.\"\n\n\"That is correct, Bernouin; that is all I wanted to know. Leave us now,\"\nsaid the cardinal, fixing his brilliant eye upon the young king, who sat\nmute with stupefaction.\n\n\"However--\" stammered the king.\n\n\"What, do you still doubt, sire?\" said the cardinal. \"Well, here is a\nproof of what I said.\"\n\nAnd Mazarin drew from under his bolster the paper covered with figures,\nwhich he presented to the king, who turned away his eyes, his vexation\nwas so deep.\n\n\"Therefore, as it is a million you want, sire, and that million is not\nset down here, it is forty-six millions your majesty stands in need of.\nWell, I don't think that any Jews in the world would lend such a sum,\neven upon the crown of France.\"\n\nThe king, clenching his hands beneath his ruffles, pushed away his\nchair.\n\n\"So it must be then!\" said he; \"my brother the king of England will die\nof hunger.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Mazarin, in the same tone, \"remember this proverb, which\nI give you as the expression of the soundest policy: 'Rejoice at being\npoor when your neighbor is poor likewise.'\"\n\nLouis meditated this for a few moments, with an inquisitive glance\ndirected to the paper, one end of which remained under the bolster.\n\n\"Then,\" said he, \"it is impossible to comply with my demand for money,\nmy lord cardinal, is it?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, sire.\"\n\n\"Remember, this will secure me a future enemy, if he succeed in\nrecovering his crown without my assistance.\"\n\n\"If your majesty only fears that, you may be quite at ease,\" replied\nMazarin, eagerly.\n\n\"Very well, I say no more about it,\" exclaimed Louis XIV.\n\n\"Have I at least convinced you, sire?\" placing his hand upon that of the\nyoung king.\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"If there be anything else, ask it, sire; I shall most happy to grant it\nto you, having refused this.\"\n\n\"Anything else, my lord?\"\n\n\"Why yes; am I not devoted body and soul to your majesty? _Hola!_\nBernouin!--lights and guards for his majesty! His majesty is returning\nto his own chamber.\"\n\n\"Not yet, monsieur: since you place your good-will at my disposal, I\nwill take advantage of it.\"\n\n\"For yourself, sire?\" asked the cardinal, hoping that his niece was at\nlength about to be named.\n\n\"No, monsieur, not for myself,\" replied Louis, \"but still for my brother\nCharles.\"\n\nThe brow of Mazarin again became clouded, and he grumbled a few words\nthat the king could not catch.\n\n\n\nChapter XI. Mazarin's Policy.\n\nInstead of the hesitation with which he had accosted the cardinal a\nquarter of an hour before, there might be read in the eyes of the young\nking that will against which a struggle might be maintained, and which\nmight be crushed by its own impotence, but which, at least, would\npreserve, like a wound in the depth of the heart, the remembrance of its\ndefeat.\n\n\"This time, my lord cardinal, we have to deal with something more easily\nfound than a million.\"\n\n\"Do you think so, sire?\" said Mazarin, looking at the king with that\npenetrating eye which was accustomed to read to the bottom of hearts.\n\n\"Yes, I think so; and when you know the object of my request--\"\n\n\"And do you think I do not know it, sire?\"\n\n\"You know what remains for me to say to you?\"\n\n\"Listen, sire; these are King Charles's own words--\"\n\n\"Oh, impossible!\"\n\n\"Listen. 'And if that miserly, beggarly Italian,' said he--\"\n\n\"My lord cardinal!\"\n\n\"That is the sense, if not the words. Eh! Good heavens! I wish him no\nill on that account; one is biased by his passions. He said to you: 'If\nthat vile Italian refuses the million we ask of him, sire,--if we are\nforced, for want of money, to renounce diplomacy, well, then, we will\nask him to grant us five hundred gentlemen.'\"\n\nThe king started, for the cardinal was only mistaken in the number.\n\n\"Is not that it, sire?\" cried the minister, with a triumphant accent.\n\"And then he added some fine words: he said, 'I have friends on the\nother side of the channel, and these friends only want a leader and a\nbanner. When they see me, when they behold the banner of France, they\nwill rally around me, for they will comprehend that I have your support.\nThe colors of the French uniform will be worth as much to me as the\nmillion M. de Mazarin refuses us,'--for he was pretty well assured\nI should refuse him that million.--'I shall conquer with these five\nhundred gentlemen, sire, and all the honor will be yours.' Now, that is\nwhat he said, or to that purpose, was it not?--turning those plain words\ninto brilliant metaphors and pompous images, for they are fine talkers\nin that family! The father talked even on the scaffold.\"\n\nThe perspiration of shame stood on the brow of Louis. He felt that it\nwas inconsistent with his dignity to hear his brother thus insulted, but\nhe did not yet know how to act with him to whom every one yielded, even\nhis mother. At last he made an effort.\n\n\"But,\" said he, \"my lord cardinal, it is not five hundred men, it is\nonly two hundred.\"\n\n\"Well, but you see I guessed what he wanted.\"\n\n\"I never denied that you had a penetrating eye, and that was why I\nthought you would not refuse my brother Charles a thing so simple and so\neasy to grant him as what I ask of you in his name, my lord cardinal, or\nrather in my own.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Mazarin, \"I have studied policy thirty years; first, under\nthe auspices of M. le Cardinal Richelieu; and then alone. This policy\nhas not always been over-honest, it must be allowed, but it has never\nbeen unskillful. Now that which is proposed to your majesty is dishonest\nand unskillful at the same time.\"\n\n\"Dishonest, monsieur!\"\n\n\"Sire, you entered into a treaty with Cromwell.\"\n\n\"Yes, and in that very treaty Cromwell signed his name above mine.\"\n\n\"Why did you sign yours so lo down, sire? Cromwell found a good place,\nand he took it; that was his custom. I return, then, to M. Cromwell.\nYou have a treaty with him, that is to say, with England, since when you\nsigned that treaty M. Cromwell was England.\"\n\n\"M. Cromwell is dead.\"\n\n\"Do you think so, sire?\"\n\n\"No doubt he is, since his son Richard has succeeded him, and has\nabdicated.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is it exactly. Richard inherited after the death of his\nfather, and England at the abdication of Richard. The treaty formed part\nof the inheritance, whether in the hands of M. Richard or in the hands\nof England. The treaty is, then, still as good, as valid as ever. Why\nshould you evade it, sire? What is changed? Charles wants to-day what we\nwere not willing to grant him ten years ago; but that was foreseen and\nprovided against. You are the ally of England, sire, and not of Charles\nII. It was doubtless wrong, from a family point of view, to sign a\ntreaty with a man who had cut off the head of the king your father's\nbrother-in-law, and to contract an alliance with a parliament which they\ncall yonder the Rump Parliament; it was unbecoming, I acknowledge, but\nit was not unskillful from a political point of view, since, thanks to\nthat treaty, I saved your majesty, then a minor, the trouble and danger\nof a foreign war, which the Fronde--you remember the Fronde, sire?\"--the\nyoung king hung his head--\"which the Fronde might have fatally\ncomplicated. And thus I prove to your majesty that to change our\nplan now, without warning our allies, would be at once unskillful and\ndishonest. We should make war with the aggression on our side; we should\nmake it, deserving to have it made against us; and we should have the\nappearance of fearing it whilst provoking it, for a permission granted\nto five hundred men, to two hundred men, to fifty men, to ten men, is\nstill a permission. One Frenchman, that is the nation; one uniform, that\nis the army. Suppose, sire, for example, that you should have war with\nHolland, which, sooner or later, will certainly happen; or with Spain,\nwhich will perhaps ensue if your marriage fails\" (Mazarin stole a\nfurtive glance at the king), \"and there are a thousand causes that\nmight yet make your marriage fail,--well, would you approve of England's\nsending to the United Provinces or to Spain a regiment, a company, a\nsquadron even, of English gentlemen? Would you think that they kept\nwithin the limits of their treaty of alliance?\"\n\nLouis listened; it seemed so strange to him that Mazarin should invoke\ngood faith, and he the author of so many political tricks, called\nMazarinades. \"And yet,\" said the king, \"without manifest of my\nauthorization, I cannot prevent gentlemen of my states from passing over\ninto England, if such should be their good pleasure.\"\n\n\"You should compel them to return, sire, or at least protest against\ntheir presence as enemies in a allied country.\"\n\n\"But come, my lord cardinal, you who are so profound a genius, try if\nyou cannot find a means to assist this poor king, without compromising\nourselves.\"\n\n\"And that is exactly what I am not willing to do, my dear sire,\" said\nMazarin. \"If England were to act exactly according to my wishes, she\ncould not act better than she does; if I directed the policy of England\nfrom this place, I should not direct it otherwise. Governed as she\nis governed, England is an eternal nest of contention for all Europe.\nHolland protects Charles II., let Holland do so; they will quarrel, they\nwill fight. Let them destroy each other's navies, we can construct ours\nwith the wrecks of their vessels; when we shall save our money to buy\nnails.\"\n\n\"Oh, how paltry and mean is all this that you are telling me, monsieur\nle cardinal!\"\n\n\"Yes, but nevertheless it is true, sire; you must confess that. Sill\nfurther. Suppose I admit, for a moment, the possibility of breaking your\nword, and evading the treaty--such a thing as sometimes happens, but\nthat is when some great interest is to be promoted by it, or when the\ntreaty is found to be too troublesome--well, you will authorize\nthe engagement asked of you: France--her banner, which is the same\nthing--will cross the Straits and will fight; France will be conquered.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"_Ma foi!_ we have a pretty general to fight under--this Charles II.!\nWorcester gave us proofs of that.\"\n\n\"But he will no longer have to deal with Cromwell, monsieur.\"\n\n\"But he will have to deal with Monk, who is quite as dangerous. The\nbrave brewer of whom we are speaking, was a visionary; he had moments of\nexaltation, of inflation, during which he ran over like an over-filled\ncask; and from the chinks there always escaped some drops of his\nthoughts, and by the sample the whole of his thought was to be made out.\nCromwell has thus allowed us more than ten times to penetrate into his\nvery soul, when one would have conceived that soul to be enveloped in\ntriple brass, as Horace had it. But Monk! Oh, sire, God defend you from\never having anything to transact politically with Monk. It is he who has\ngiven me, in one year, all the gray hairs I have. Monk is no fanatic;\nunfortunately he is a politician; he does not overflow, he keeps close\ntogether. For ten years he has had his eyes fixed upon one object, and\nnobody has yet been able to ascertain what. Every morning, as Louis XI.\nadvised, he burns his nightcap. Therefore, on the day when this plan,\nslowly and solitarily ripened, shall break forth, it will break forth\nwith all the conditions of success which always accompany an unforeseen\nevent. That is Monk, sire, of whom, perhaps, you have never even\nheard--of whom, perhaps, you did not even know the name, before your\nbrother, Charles II., who knows what he is, pronounced it before you.\nHe is a marvel of depth and tenacity, the two only things against which\nintelligence and ardor are blunted. Sire, I had ardor when I was\nyoung; I always was intelligent. I may safely boast of it, because I\nam reproached with it. I have done very well with these two qualities,\nsince, from the son of a fisherman of Piscina, I have become prime\nminister to the king of France; and in that position your majesty will\nperhaps acknowledge I have rendered some service to the throne of\nyour majesty. Well, sire, if I had met with Monk on my way, instead of\nMonsieur de Beaufort, Monsieur de Retz, or Monsieur le Prince--well, we\nshould have been ruined. If you engage yourself rashly, sire, you will\nfall into the talons of this politic soldier. The casque of Monk, sire,\nis an iron coffer, and no one has the key of it. Therefore, near him, or\nrather before him, I bow, sire, for I have nothing but a velvet cap.\"\n\n\"What do you think Monk wishes to do, then?\"\n\n\"Eh! sire, if I knew that, I would not tell you to mistrust him, for\nI should be stronger than he; but with him, I am afraid to guess--to\nguess!--you understand my word?--for if I thought I had guessed, I\nshould stop at an idea, and, in spite of myself, should pursue that\nidea. Since that man has been in power yonder, I am like one of the\ndamned in Dante whose neck Satan has twisted, and who walk forward\nlooking around behind them. I am traveling towards Madrid, but I never\nlose sight of London. To guess, with that devil of a man, is to deceive\none's self and to deceive one's self is to ruin one's self. God keep me\nfrom ever seeking to guess what he aims at; I confine myself to watching\nwhat he does, and that is well enough. Now I believe--you observe the\nmeaning of the word _I believe?_--_I believe_, with respect to Monk,\nties one to nothing--I believe that he has a strong inclination to\nsucceed Cromwell. Your Charles II. has already caused proposals to be\nmade to him by ten persons; he has satisfied himself with driving these\nten meddlers from his presence, without saying anything to them but,\n'Begone, or I will have you hung.' That man is a sepulcher! At this\nmoment Monk is affecting devotion to the Rump Parliament; of this\ndevotion, I am not the dupe. Monk has no wish to be assassinated,--an\nassassination would stop him in the middle of his operations; and his\nwork must be accomplished;--so I believe--but do not believe what I\nbelieve, sire: for as I say I believe from habit--I believe that Monk\nis keeping on friendly terms with the parliament till the day comes for\ndispersing it. You are asked for swords, but they are to fight against\nMonk. God preserve you from fighting against Monk, sire; for Monk would\nbeat us, and I should never console myself after being beaten by Monk.\nI should say to myself, Monk has foreseen that victory ten years. For\nGod's sake, sire, out of friendship for you, if not out of consideration\nfor himself, let Charles II. keep quiet. Your majesty will give him\na little income here; give him one of your chateaux. Yes, yes--wait\nawhile. But I forget the treaty--that famous treaty of which we were\njust now speaking. Your majesty has not even the right to give him a\nchateau.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; your majesty is bound not to grant hospitality to King\nCharles, and to compel him to leave France even. It was on this account\nwe forced him to quit you, and yet here he is again. Sire, I hope you\nwill give your brother to understand that he cannot remain with us; that\nit is impossible he should be allowed to compromise us; or I myself--\"\n\n\"Enough, my lord,\" said Louis XIV., rising. \"In refusing me a million,\nperhaps you may be right; your millions are your own. In refusing me two\nhundred gentlemen, you are still further in the right; for you are prime\nminister, and you have, in the eyes of France, the responsibility of\npeace and war. But that you should pretend to prevent me, who am king,\nfrom extending my hospitality to the grandson of Henry IV., to my\ncousin-german, to the companion of my childhood--there your power stops,\nand there begins my will.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Mazarin, delighted at being let off so cheaply, and who\nhad, besides, only fought so earnestly to arrive at that,--\"sire, I\nshall always bend before the will of my king. Let my king, then, keep\nnear him, or in one of his chateaux, the king of England; let Mazarin\nknow it, but let not the minister know it.\"\n\n\"Good-night, my lord,\" said Louis XIV., \"I go away in despair.\"\n\n\"But convinced, and that is all I desire, sire,\" replied Mazarin.\n\nThe king made no answer, and retired quite pensive, convinced, not of\nall Mazarin had told him, but of one thing which he took care not to\nmention to him; and that was, that it was necessary for him to study\nseriously both his own affairs and those of Europe, for he found them\nvery difficult and very obscure. Louis found the king of England seated\nin the same place where he had left him. On perceiving him, the English\nprince arose; but at the first glance he saw discouragement written\nin dark letters upon his cousin's brow. Then, speaking first, as if to\nfacilitate the painful avowal that Louis had to make to him,--\n\n\"Whatever it may be,\" said he, \"I shall never forget all the kindness,\nall the friendship you have exhibited towards me.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" replied Louis, in a melancholy tone, \"only barren good-will, my\nbrother.\"\n\nCharles II. became extremely pale; he passed his cold hand over his\nbrow, and struggled for a few instants against a faintness that made him\ntremble. \"I understand,\" said he at last; \"no more hope!\"\n\nLouis seized the hand of Charles II. \"Wait, my brother,\" said he;\n\"precipitate nothing; everything may change; hasty resolutions ruin all\ncauses; add another year of trial, I implore you, to the years you have\nalready undergone. You have, to induce you to act now rather than\nat another time, neither occasion nor opportunity. Come with me, my\nbrother; I will give you one of my residences, whichever you prefer, to\ninhabit. I, with you, will keep my eyes upon events; we will prepare.\nCome, then, my brother, have courage!\"\n\nCharles II. withdrew his hand from that of the king, and drawing back,\nto salute him with more ceremony, \"With all my heart, thanks!\" replied\nhe, \"sire; but I have prayed without success to the greatest king on\nearth; now I will go and ask a miracle of God.\" And he went out without\nbeing willing to hear any more, his head carried loftily, his hand\ntrembling, with a painful contraction of his noble countenance, and that\nprofound gloom which, finding no more hope in the world of men,\nappeared to go beyond it, and ask it in worlds unknown. The officer of\nmusketeers, on seeing him pass by thus pale, bowed almost to his knees\nas he saluted him. He then took a flambeau, called two musketeers, and\ndescended the deserted staircase with the unfortunate king, holding in\nhis left hand his hat, the plume of which swept the steps. Arrived at\nthe door, the musketeer asked the king which way he was going, that he\nmight direct the musketeers.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied Charles II., in a subdued voice, \"you who have known\nmy father, say, did you ever pray for him? If you have done so, do not\nforget me in your prayers. Now, I am going alone, and beg of you not to\naccompany me, or have me accompanied any further.\"\n\nThe officer bowed and sent away the musketeers into the interior of the\npalace. But he himself remained an instant under the porch watching the\ndeparting Charles II., till he was lost in the turn of the next street.\n\"To him as to his father formerly,\" murmured he, \"Athos, if he\nwere here, would say with reason,--'Salute fallen majesty!'\" Then,\nreascending the staircase: \"Oh! the vile service that I follow!\" said he\nat every step. \"Oh! my pitiful master! Life thus carried on is no longer\ntolerable, and it is at length time that I should do something! No\nmore generosity, no more energy! The master has succeeded, the pupil\nis starved forever. _Mordioux!_ I will not resist. Come, you men,\"\ncontinued he, entering the ante-chamber, \"why are you all looking at\nme so? Extinguish these torches and return to your posts. Ah! you were\nguarding me? Yes, you watch over me, do you not, worthy fellows? Brave\nfools! I am not the Duc de Guise. Begone! They will not assassinate me\nin the little passage. Besides,\" added he, in a low voice, \"that would\nbe a resolution, and no resolutions have been formed since Monsieur le\nCardinal Richelieu died. Now, with all his faults, that was a man! It is\nsettled: to-morrow I will throw my cassock to the nettles.\"\n\nThen, reflecting: \"No,\" said he, \"not yet! I have one great trial to\nmake and I will make it; but that, and I swear it, shall be the last,\n_Mordioux!_\"\n\nHe had not finished speaking when a voice issued from the king's\nchamber. \"Monsieur le lieutenant!\" said this voice.\n\n\"Here I am,\" replied he.\n\n\"The king desires to speak to you.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said the lieutenant; \"perhaps of what I was thinking about.\"\nAnd he went into the king's apartment.\n\n\n\nChapter XII. The King and the Lieutenant.\n\nAs soon as the king saw the officer enter, he dismissed his _valet de\nchambre_ and his gentleman.\n\n\"Who is on duty to-morrow, monsieur?\" asked he.\n\nThe lieutenant bowed his head with military politeness, and replied, \"I\nam, sire.\"\n\n\"What! still you?\"\n\n\"Always I, sire.\"\n\n\"How can that be, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Sire, when traveling, the musketeers supply all the posts of your\nmajesty's household; that is to say, yours, her majesty the queen's, and\nmonsieur le cardinal's, the latter of whom borrows of the king the best\npart, or rather the numerous part, of the royal guard.\"\n\n\"But in the interims?\"\n\n\"There are no interims, sire, but for twenty or thirty men who rest out\nof a hundred and twenty. At the Louvre it is very different, and if I\nwere at the Louvre I should rely upon my brigadier; but, when traveling,\nsire, no one knows what may happen, and I prefer doing my duty myself.\"\n\n\"Then you are on guard every day?\"\n\n\"And every night. Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I cannot allow that--I will have you rest.\"\n\n\"That is very kind, sire; but I will not.\"\n\n\"What do you say?\" said the king, who did not at first comprehend the\nfull meaning of this reply.\n\n\"I say, sire, that I will not expose myself to the chance of a fault. If\nthe devil had a trick to play on me, you understand, sire, as he knows\nthe man with whom he has to deal, he would chose the moment when I\nshould not be there. My duty and the peace of my conscience before\neverything, sire.\"\n\n\"But such duty will kill you, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Eh! sire, I have performed it for thirty years, and in all France\nand Navarre there is not a man in better health than I am. Moreover, I\nentreat you, sire, not to trouble yourself about me. That would appear\nvery strange to me, seeing that I am not accustomed to it.\"\n\nThe king cut short the conversation by a fresh question. \"Shall you be\nhere, then, to-morrow morning?\"\n\n\"As at present? yes, sire.\"\n\nThe king walked several times up and down his chamber; it was very plain\nthat he burned with a desire to speak, but that he was restrained by\nsome fear or other. The lieutenant, standing motionless, hat in hand,\nwatched him making these evolutions, and, whilst looking at him,\ngrumbled to himself, biting his mustache:\n\n\"He has not half a crown worth of resolution! _Parole d'honneur!_ I\nwould lay a wager he does not speak at all!\"\n\nThe king continued to walk about, casting from time to time a side\nglance at the lieutenant. \"He is the very image of his father,\"\ncontinued the latter, in is secret soliloquy, \"he is at once proud,\navaricious, and timid. The devil take his master, say I.\"\n\nThe king stopped. \"Lieutenant,\" said he.\n\n\"I am here, sire.\"\n\n\"Why did you cry out this evening, down below in the _salons_--'The\nking's service! His majesty's musketeers!'\"\n\n\"Because you gave me the order, sire.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yourself.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I did not say a word, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Sire, an order is given by a sign, by a gesture, by a glance, as\nintelligibly, as freely, and as clearly as by word of mouth. A servant\nwho has nothing but ears is not half a good servant.\"\n\n\"Your eyes are very penetrating, then, monsieur.\"\n\n\"How is that, sire?\"\n\n\"Because they see what is not.\"\n\n        \"My eyes are good, though, sire, although they have served their\nmaster long and much: when they have anything to see, they seldom miss\nthe opportunity. Now, this evening, they saw that your majesty colored\nwith endeavoring to conceal the inclination to yawn, that your majesty\nlooked with eloquent supplications, first to his eminence, and then at\nher majesty, the queen-mother, and at length to the entrance door,\nand they so thoroughly remarked all I have said, that they saw your\nmajesty's lips articulate these words: 'Who will get me out of this?'\"\n\n\"Monsieur!\"\n\n\"Or something to this effect, sire--'My musketeers!' I could then no\nlonger hesitate. That look was for me. I cried out instantly, 'His\nmajesty's musketeers!' And, besides, that was shown to be true, sire,\nnot only by your majesty's not saying I was wrong, but proving I was\nright by going out at once.\"\n\nThe king turned away to smile; then, after a few seconds, he again fixed\nhis limpid eye upon that countenance, so intelligent, so bold, and so\nfirm, that it might have been said to be the proud and energetic profile\nof the eagle facing the sun. \"That is all very well,\" said he, after a\nshort silence, during which he endeavored, in vain, to make his officer\nlower his eyes.\n\nBut seeing the king said no more, the latter pirouetted on his heels,\nand took three steps towards the door, muttering, \"He will not speak!\n_Mordioux!_ he will not speak!\"\n\n\"Thank you, monsieur,\" said the king at last.\n\n\"Humph!\" continued the lieutenant; \"there was only wanting that. Blamed\nfor having been less of a fool than another might have been.\" And he\nwent to the door, allowing his spurs to jingle in true military style.\nBut when he was on the threshold, feeling the king's desire drew him\nback, he returned.\n\n\"Has your majesty told me all?\" asked he, in a tone we cannot describe,\nbut which, without appearing to solicit the royal confidence, contained\nso much persuasive frankness, that the king immediately replied:\n\n\"Yes; but draw near, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Now then,\" murmured the officer, \"he is coming to it at last.\"\n\n\"Listen to me.\"\n\n\"I shall not lose a word, sire.\"\n\n\"You will mount on horseback to-morrow, at about half-past four in the\nmorning, and you will have a horse saddled for me.\"\n\n\"From your majesty's stables?\"\n\n\"No; one of your musketeers' horses.\"\n\n\"Very well, sire. Is that all?\"\n\n\"And you will accompany me.\"\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"Alone.\"\n\n\"Shall I come to seek your majesty, or shall I wait?\"\n\n\"You will wait for me.\"\n\n\"Where, sire?\"\n\n\"At the little park-gate.\"\n\nThe lieutenant bowed, understanding that the king had told him all he\nhad to say. In fact, the king dismissed him with a gracious wave of the\nhand. The officer left the chamber of the king, and returned to place\nhimself philosophically in his _fauteuil_, where, far from sleeping,\nas might have been expected, considering how late it was, he began to\nreflect more deeply than he had ever reflected before. The result of\nthese reflections was not so melancholy as the preceding ones had been.\n\n\"Come, he has begun,\" said he. \"Love urges him on, and he goes\nforward--he goes forward! The king is nobody in his own palace; but\nthe man perhaps may prove to be worth something. Well, we shall see\nto-morrow morning. Oh! oh!\" cried he, all at once starting up, \"that is\na gigantic idea, _mordioux!_ and perhaps my fortune depends, at least,\nupon that idea!\" After this exclamation, the officer arose and marched,\nwith his hands in the pockets of his _justaucorps_, about the immense\nante-chamber that served him as an apartment. The wax-light flamed\nfuriously under the effects of a fresh breeze, which stole in through\nthe chinks of the door and the window, and cut the _salle_ diagonally.\nIt threw out a reddish, unequal light, sometimes brilliant, sometimes\ndull, and the tall shadow of the lieutenant was seen marching on the\nwall, in profile, like a figure by Callot, with his long sword and\nfeathered hat.\n\n\"Certainly!\" said he, \"I am mistaken if Mazarin is not laying a snare\nfor this amorous boy. Mazarin, this evening, gave an address, and made\nan appointment as complacently as M. Daangeau himself could have done--I\nheard him, and I know the meaning of his words. 'To-morrow morning,'\nsaid he, 'they will pass opposite the bridge of Blois.' _Mordioux!_ that\nis clear enough, and particularly for a lover. That is the cause of this\nembarrassment; that is the cause of this hesitation; that is the\ncause of this order--'Monsieur the lieutenant of my musketeers, be on\nhorseback to-morrow at four o'clock in the morning.' Which is as\nclear as if he had said,--'Monsieur the lieutenant of my musketeers,\nto-morrow, at four, at the bridge of Blois,--do you understand?' Here\nis a state secret, then, which I, humble as I am, have in my possession,\nwhile it is in action. And how do I get it? Because I have good eyes,\nas his majesty just now said. They say he loves this little Italian doll\nfuriously. They say he threw himself at his mother's feet, to beg her to\nallow him to marry her. They say the queen went so far as to consult\nthe court of Rome, whether such a marriage, contracted against her will,\nwould be valid. Oh, if I were but twenty-five! If I had by my side those\nI no longer have! If I did not despise the whole world most profoundly,\nI would embroil Mazarin with the queen-mother, France with Spain, and\nI would make a queen after my own fashion. But let that pass.\" And the\nlieutenant snapped his fingers in disdain.\n\n\"This miserable Italian--this poor creature--this sordid wretch--who has\njust refused the king of England a million, would not perhaps give me\na thousand pistoles for the news I would carry him. _Mordioux!_ I am\nfalling into second childhood--I am becoming stupid indeed! The idea of\nMazarin giving anything! ha! ha! ha!\" and he laughed in a subdued voice.\n\n\"Well, let us go to sleep--let us go to sleep; and the sooner the\nbetter. My mind is wearied with my evening's work, and will see things\nto-morrow more clearly than to-day.\"\n\nAnd upon this recommendation, made to himself, he folded his cloak\naround him, looking with contempt upon his royal neighbor. Five minutes\nafter this he was asleep, with his hands clenched and his lips apart,\ngiving escape, not to his secret, but to a sonorous sound, which rose\nand spread freely beneath the majestic roof of the ante-chamber.\n\n\n\nChapter XIII. Mary de Mancini.\n\nThe sun had scarcely shed its first beams on the majestic trees of the\npark and the lofty turrets of the castle, when the young king, who had\nbeen awake more than two hours, possessed by the sleeplessness of love,\nopened his shutters himself, and cast an inquiring look into the courts\nof the sleeping palace. He saw that it was the hour agreed upon: the\ngreat court clock pointed to a quarter past four. He did not disturb\nhis _valet de chambre_, who was sleeping soundly at some distance; he\ndressed himself, and the valet, in a great fright, sprang up, thinking\nhe had been deficient in his duty; but the king sent him back again,\ncommanding him to preserve the most absolute silence. He then descended\nthe little staircase, went out at a lateral door, and perceived at the\nend of the wall a mounted horseman, holding another horse by the bridle.\nThis horseman could not be recognized in his cloak and slouched hat. As\nto the horse, saddled like that of a rich citizen, it offered nothing\nremarkable to the most experienced eye. Louis took the bridle: the\nofficer held the stirrup without dismounting, and asked his majesty's\norders in a low voice.\n\n\"Follow me,\" replied the king.\n\nThe officer put his horse to the trot, behind that of his master, and\nthey descended the hill towards the bridge. When they reached the other\nside of the Loire,--\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the king, \"you will please to ride on till you see a\ncarriage coming; then return and inform me. I will wait here.\"\n\n\"Will your majesty deign to give me some description of the carriage I\nam charged to discover?\"\n\n\"A carriage in which you will see two ladies, and probably their\nattendants likewise.\"\n\n\"Sire, I should not wish to make a mistake; is there no other sign by\nwhich I may know this carriage?\"\n\n\"It will bear, in all probability, the arms of monsieur le cardinal.\"\n\n\"That is sufficient, sire,\" replied the officer, fully instructed in the\nobject of his search. He put his horse to the trot, and rode sharply on\nin the direction pointed out by the king. But he had scarcely gone five\nhundred paces when he saw four mules, and then a carriage, loom up from\nbehind a little hill. Behind this carriage came another. It required\nonly one glance to assure him that these were the equipages he was in\nsearch of; he therefore turned his bridle, and rode back to the king.\n\n\"Sire,\" said he, \"here are the carriages. The first, as you said,\ncontains two ladies with their _femmes de chambre_; the second contains\nthe footmen, provisions, and necessaries.\"\n\n\"That is well,\" replied the king in an agitated voice. \"Please to go\nand tell those ladies that a cavalier of the court wishes to pay his\nrespects to them alone.\"\n\nThe officer set off at a gallop. \"_Mordioux!_\" said he, as he rode on,\n\"here is a new and honorable employment, I hope! I complained of being\nnobody. I am the king's confidant: that is enough to make a musketeer\nburst with pride.\"\n\nHe approached the carriage, and delivered his message gallantly and\nintelligently. There were two ladies in the carriage: one of great\nbeauty, although rather thin; the other less favored by nature, but\nlively, graceful, and uniting in the delicate lines of her brow all the\nsigns of a strong will. Her eyes, animated and piercing, in particular,\nspoke more eloquently than all the amorous phrases in fashion in those\ndays of gallantry. It was to her D'Artagnan addressed himself, without\nfear of being mistaken, although the other was, as we have said, the\nmore handsome of the two.\n\n\"Madame,\" said he, \"I am the lieutenant of the musketeers, and there\nis on the road a horseman who awaits you, and is desirous of paying his\nrespects to you.\"\n\nAt these words, the effect of which he watched closely, the lady with\nthe black eyes uttered a cry of joy, leant out of the carriage window,\nand seeing the cavalier approaching, held out her arms, exclaiming:\n\n\"Ah, my dear sire!\" and the tears gushed from her eyes.\n\nThe coachman stopped his team; the women rose in confusion from the back\nof the carriage, and the second lady made a slight curtsey, terminated\nby the most ironical smile that jealousy ever imparted to the lips of\nwoman.\n\n\"Marie, dear Marie,\" cried the king, taking the hand of the black-eyed\nlady in both his. And opening the heavy door himself, he drew her out\nof the carriage with so much ardor, that she was in his arms before\nshe touched the ground. The lieutenant, posted on the other side of the\ncarriage, saw and heard all without being observed.\n\nThe king offered his arm to Mademoiselle de Mancini, and made a sign to\nthe coachman and lackeys to proceed. It was nearly six o'clock; the road\nwas fresh and pleasant; tall trees with their foliage still inclosed in\nthe golden down of their buds, let the dew of morning filter from their\ntrembling branches, like liquid diamonds; the grass was bursting at the\nfoot of the hedges; the swallows having returned only a few days since,\ndescribed their graceful curves between the heavens and the water; a\nbreeze, laden with the perfumes of the blossoming woods, sighed along\nthe road, and wrinkled the surface of the waters of the river; all\nthese beauties of the day, all these perfumes of the plants, all these\naspirations of the earth towards heaven, intoxicated the two lovers,\nwalking side by side, leaning upon each other, eyes fixed upon eyes,\nhand clasping hand, and who, lingering as by a common desire, did not\ndare to speak, they had so much to say.\n\nThe officer saw that the king's horse, in wandering this way and that,\nannoyed Mademoiselle de Mancini. He took advantage of the pretext of\nsecuring the horse to draw near them, and dismounting, walked between\nthe two horses he led; he did not lose a single word or gesture of the\nlovers. It was Mademoiselle de Mancini who at length began.\n\n\"Ah, my dear sire!\" said she, \"you do not abandon me, then?\"\n\n\"No, Marie,\" replied the king; \"you see I do not.\"\n\n\"I had so often been told, though, that as soon as we should be\nseparated you would no longer think of me.\"\n\n\"Dear Marie, is it then to-day only that you have discovered we are\nsurrounded by people interested in deceiving us?\"\n\n\"But then, sire, this journey, this alliance with Spain? They are going\nto marry you off!\"\n\nLouis hung his head. At the same time the officer could see the eyes\nof Marie de Mancini shine in the sun with the brilliancy of a dagger\nstarting from its sheath. \"And you have done nothing in favor of our\nlove?\" asked the girl, after a silence of a moment.\n\n\"Ah! mademoiselle, how could you believe that? I threw myself at the\nfeet of my mother; I begged her, I implored her; I told her all my hopes\nof happiness were in you; I even threatened--\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked Marie, eagerly.\n\n\"Well, the queen-mother wrote to the court of Rome, and received as\nanswer, that a marriage between us would have no validity, and would be\ndissolved by the holy father. At length, finding there was no hope for\nus, I requested to have my marriage with the infanta at least delayed.\"\n\n\"And yet that does not prevent your being on the road to meet her?\"\n\n\"How can I help it? To my prayers, to my supplications, to my tears, I\nreceived no answer but reasons of state.\"\n\n\"Well, well?\"\n\n\"Well, what is to be done, mademoiselle, when so many wills are leagued\nagainst me?\"\n\nIt was now Marie's turn to hang her head. \"Then I must bid you adieu\nforever,\" said she. \"You know that I am being exiled; you know that I am\ngoing to be buried alive; you know still more that they want to marry me\noff, too.\"\n\nLouis became very pale, and placed his hand upon his heart.\n\n\"If I had thought that my life only had been at stake, I have been so\npersecuted that I might have yielded; but I thought yours was\nconcerned, my dear sire, and I stood out for the sake of preserving your\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! my happiness, my treasure!\" murmured the king, more gallantly\nthan passionately, perhaps.\n\n\"The cardinal might have yielded,\" said Marie, \"if you had addressed\nyourself to him, if you had pressed him. For the cardinal to call the\nking of France his nephew! do you not perceive, sire? He would have made\nwar even for that honor; the cardinal, assured of governing alone, under\nthe double pretext of having brought up the king and given his niece\nto him in marriage--the cardinal would have fought all antagonists,\novercome all obstacles. Oh, sire! I can answer for that. I am a woman,\nand I see clearly into everything where love is concerned.\"\n\nThese words produced a strange effect upon the king. Instead of\nheightening his passion, they cooled it. He stopped, and said hastily,--\n\n\"What is to be said, mademoiselle? Everything has failed.\"\n\n\"Except your will, I trust, my dear sire?\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said the king, coloring, \"have I a will?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mademoiselle de Mancini mournfully, wounded by that\nexpression.\n\n\"The king has no will but that which policy dictates, but that which\nreasons of state impose upon him.\"\n\n\"Oh! it is because you have no love,\" cried Mary; \"if you loved, sire,\nyou would have a will.\"\n\nOn pronouncing these words, Mary raised her eyes to her lover, whom she\nsaw more pale and more cast down than an exile who is about to quit his\nnative land forever. \"Accuse me,\" murmured the king, \"but do not say I\ndo not love you.\"\n\nA long silence followed these words, which the young king had pronounced\nwith a perfectly true and profound feeling. \"I am unable to think that\nto-morrow, and after to-morrow, I shall see you no more; I cannot think\nthat I am going to end my sad days at a distance from Paris; that the\nlips of an old man, of an unknown, should touch that hand which you hold\nwithin yours; no, in truth, I cannot think of all that, my dear sire,\nwithout having my poor heart burst with despair.\"\n\nAnd Marie de Mancini did shed floods of tears. On his part, the king,\nmuch affected, carried his handkerchief to his mouth, and stifled a sob.\n\n\"See,\" said she, \"the carriages have stopped, my sister waits for me,\nthe time is come; what you are about to decide upon will be decided for\nlife. Oh, sire! you are willing, then, that I should lose you? You\nare willing, then, Louis, that she to whom you have said 'I love you,'\nshould belong to another than to her king, to her master, to her lover?\nOh! courage, Louis! courage! One word, a single word! Say 'I will!' and\nall my life is enchained to yours, and all my heart is yours forever.\"\n\nThe king made no reply. Mary then looked at him as Dido looked at Aeneas\nin the Elysian fields, fierce and disdainful.\n\n\"Farewell, then,\" said she; \"farewell life! love! heaven!\"\n\nAnd she took a step away. The king detained her, seizing her hand, which\nhe pressed to his lips, and despair prevailing over the resolution he\nappeared to have inwardly formed, he let fall upon that beautiful hand\na burning tear of regret, which made Mary start, so really had that\ntear burnt her. She saw the humid eyes of the king, his pale brow, his\nconvulsed lips, and cried, with an accent that cannot be described,--\n\n\"Oh, sire! you are a king, you weep, and yet I depart!\"\n\nAs his sole reply, the king hid his face in his handkerchief. The\nofficer uttered something so like a roar that it frightened the horses.\nMademoiselle de Mancini, quite indignant, quitted the king's arm,\nhastily entered the carriage, crying to the coachman, \"Go on, go on, and\nquick!\"\n\nThe coachman obeyed, flogging his mules, and the heavy carriage rocked\nupon its creaking axle, whilst the king of France, alone, cast down,\nannihilated, did not dare to look either behind or before him.\n\n\n\nChapter XIV. In which the King and the Lieutenant each give Proofs of\nMemory.\n\nWhen the king, like all the people in the world who are in love, had\nlong and attentively watched disappear in the distance the carriage\nwhich bore away his mistress; when he had turned and turned again a\nhundred times to the same side and had at length succeeded in somewhat\ncalming the agitation of his heart and thoughts, he recollected that he\nwas not alone. The officer still held the horse by the bridle, and had\nnot lost all hope of seeing the king recover his resolution. He had\nstill the resource of mounting and riding after the carriage; they\nwould have lost nothing by waiting a little. But the imagination of the\nlieutenant of the musketeers was too rich and too brilliant; it left\nfar behind it that of the king, who took care not to allow himself to be\ncarried away to such excess. He contented himself with approaching the\nofficer, and in a doleful voice, \"Come,\" said he, \"let us be gone; all\nis ended. To horse!\"\n\nThe officer imitated this carriage, this slowness, this sadness, and\nleisurely mounted his horse. The king pushed on sharply, the lieutenant\nfollowed him. At the bridge Louis turned around for the last time. The\nlieutenant, patient as a god who has eternity behind and before him,\nstill hoped for a return of energy. But it was groundless, nothing\nappeared. Louis gained the street which led to the castle, and entered\nas seven was striking. When the king had returned, and the musketeer,\nwho saw everything, had seen a corner of the tapestry over the\ncardinal's window lifted up, he breathed a profound sigh, like a man\nunloosed from the tightest bonds, and said in a low voice:\n\n\"Now then, my officer, I hope that it is over.\"\n\nThe king summoned his gentleman. \"Please to understand I shall receive\nnobody before two o'clock,\" said he.\n\n\"Sire,\" replied the gentleman, \"there is, however, some one who requests\nadmittance.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"Your lieutenant of musketeers.\"\n\n\"He who accompanied me?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the king, \"let him come in.\"\n\nThe officer entered. The king made a sign, and the gentleman and the\nvalet retired. Louis followed them with his eyes until they had shut the\ndoor, and when the tapestries had fallen behind them,--\"You remind me\nby your presence, monsieur, of something I had forgotten to recommend to\nyou, that is to say, the most absolute discretion.\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, why does your majesty give yourself the trouble of making me\nsuch a recommendation? It is plain you do not know me.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, that is true. I know that you are discreet; but as I had\nprescribed nothing--\"\n\nThe officer bowed. \"Has your majesty nothing else to say to me?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; you may retire.\"\n\n\"Shall I obtain permission not to do so till I have spoken to the king,\nsire?\"\n\n\"What do you have to say to me? Explain yourself, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Sire, a thing without importance to you, but which interests me\ngreatly. Pardon me, then, for speaking of it. Without urgency, without\nnecessity, I never would have done it, and I would have disappeared,\nmute and insignificant as I always have been.\"\n\n\"How! Disappeared! I do not understand you, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Sire, in a word,\" said the officer, \"I am come to ask for my discharge\nfrom your majesty's service.\"\n\nThe king made a movement of surprise, but the officer remained as\nmotionless as a statue.\n\n\"Your discharge--yours, monsieur? and for how long a time, I pray?\"\n\n\"Why, forever, sire.\"\n\n\"What, you are desirous of quitting my service, monsieur?\" said Louis,\nwith an expression that revealed something more than surprise.\n\n\"Sire, I regret to say that I am.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"It is so, however, sire. I am getting old; I have worn harness now\nthirty-five years; my poor shoulders are tired; I feel that I must give\nplace to the young. I don't belong to this age; I have still one foot\nin the old one; it results that everything is strange in my eyes,\neverything astonishes and bewilders me. In short, I have the honor to\nask your majesty for my discharge.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the king, looking at the officer, who wore his uniform\nwith an ease that would have caused envy in a young man, \"you are\nstronger and more vigorous than I am.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" replied the officer, with an air of false modesty, \"your\nmajesty says so because I still have a good eye and a tolerably firm\nfoot--because I can still ride a horse, and my mustache is black; but,\nsire, vanity of vanities all that--illusions all that--appearance,\nsmoke, sire! I have still a youthful air, it is true, but I feel old,\nand within six months I am certain I shall be broken down, gouty,\nimpotent. Therefore, then, sire--\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" interrupted the king, \"remember your words of yesterday. You\nsaid to me in this very place where you now are, that you were endowed\nwith the best health of any man in France; that fatigue was unknown to\nyou! that you did not mind spending whole days and nights at your post.\nDid you tell me that, monsieur, or not? Try and recall, monsieur.\"\n\nThe officer sighed. \"Sire,\" said he, \"old age is boastful; and it is\npardonable for old men to praise themselves when others no longer do it.\nIt is very possible I said that; but the fact is, sire, I am very much\nfatigued, an request permission to retire.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the king, advancing towards the officer with a gesture\nfull of majesty, \"you are not assigning me the true reason. You wish to\nquit my service, it may be true, but you disguise from me the motive of\nyour retreat.\"\n\n\"Sire, believe that--\"\n\n\"I believe what I see, monsieur; I see a vigorous, energetic man, full\nof presence of mind, the best soldier in France, perhaps; and this\npersonage cannot persuade me the least in the world that he stands in\nneed of rest.\"\n\n\"Ah! sire,\" said the lieutenant, with bitterness, \"what praise! Indeed,\nyour majesty confounds me! Energetic, vigorous, brave, intelligent, the\nbest soldier in the army! But, sire, your majesty exaggerates my small\nportion of merit to such a point, that however good an opinion I may\nhave of myself, I do not recognize myself; in truth I do not. If I\nwere vain enough to believe only half of your majesty's words, I should\nconsider myself a valuable, indispensable man. I should say that a\nservant possessed of such brilliant qualities was a treasure beyond\nall price. Now, sire, I have been all my life--I feel bound to say\nit--except at the present time, appreciated, in my opinion, much below\nmy value. I therefore repeat, your majesty exaggerates.\"\n\nThe king knitted his brow, for he saw a bitter raillery beneath the\nwords of the officer. \"Come, monsieur,\" said he, \"let us meet the\nquestion frankly. Are you dissatisfied with my service, say? No\nevasions; speak boldly, frankly--I command you to do so.\"\n\nThe officer, who had been twisting his hat about in his hands, with an\nembarrassed air, for several minutes, raised his head at these words.\n\"Oh! sire,\" said he, \"that puts me a little more at my ease. To a\nquestion put so frankly, I will reply frankly. To tell the truth is\na good thing, as much from the pleasure one feels in relieving one's\nheart, as on account of the rarity of the fact. I will speak the truth,\nthen, to my king, at the same time imploring him to excuse the frankness\nof an old soldier.\"\n\nLouis looked at his officer with anxiety, which he manifested by the\nagitation of his gesture. \"Well, then, speak,\" said he, \"for I am\nimpatient to hear the truths you have to tell me.\"\n\nThe officer threw his hat upon a table, and his countenance, always so\nintelligent and martial, assumed, all at once, a strange character of\ngrandeur and solemnity. \"Sire,\" said he, \"I quit the king's service\nbecause I am dissatisfied. The valet, in these times, can approach his\nmaster as respectfully as I do, can give him an account of his labor,\nbring back his tools, return the funds that have been intrusted to him,\nand say 'Master, my day's work is done. Pay me, if you please, and let\nus part.'\"\n\n\"Monsieur! monsieur!\" exclaimed the king, crimson with rage.\n\n\"Ah! sire,\" replied the officer, bending his knee for a moment, \"never\nwas servant more respectful than I am before your majesty; only you\ncommanded me to tell the truth. Now I have begun to tell it, it must\ncome out, even if you command me to hold my tongue.\"\n\nThere was so much resolution expressed in the deep-sunk muscles of the\nofficer's countenance, that Louis XIV. had no occasion to tell him to\ncontinue; he continued, therefore, whilst the king looked at him with a\ncuriosity mingled with admiration.\n\n\"Sire, I have, as I have said, now served the house of France\nthirty-five years; few people have worn out so many swords in that\nservice as I have, and the swords I speak of were good swords, too,\nsire. I was a boy, ignorant of everything except courage, when the king\nyour father guessed that there was a man in me. I was a man, sire, when\nthe Cardinal de Richelieu, who was a judge of manhood, discovered an\nenemy in me. Sire, the history of that enmity between the ant and the\nlion may be read from the first to the last line, in the secret archives\nof your family. If ever you feel an inclination to know it, do so, sire;\nthe history is worth the trouble--it is I who tell you so. You will\nthere read that the lion, fatigued, harassed, out of breath, at length\ncried for quarter, and the justice must be rendered him to say, that\nhe gave as much as he required. Oh! those were glorious times, sire,\nstrewed over with battles like one of Tasso's or Ariosto's epics. The\nwonders of those times, to which the people of ours would refuse belief,\nwere every-day occurrences. For five years together, I was a hero every\nday; at least, so I was told by persons of judgment; and that is a\nlong period for heroism, trust me, sire, a period of five years.\nNevertheless, I have faith in what these people told me, for the were\ngood judges. They were named M. de Richelieu, M. de Buckingham, M. de\nBeaufort, M. de Retz, a mighty genius himself in street warfare,--in\nshort, the king, Louis XIII., and even the queen, your noble mother, who\none day condescended to say, '_Thank you_.' I don't know what service I\nhad had the good fortune to render her. Pardon me, sire, for speaking\nso boldly; but what I relate to you, as I have already had the honor to\ntell your majesty, is history.\" The king bit his lips, and threw himself\nviolently on a chair.\n\n\"I appear importunate to your majesty,\" said the lieutenant. \"Eh! sire,\nthat is the fate of truth; she is a stern companion; she bristles all\nover with steel; she wounds those whom she attacks, and sometimes him\nwho speaks her.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" replied the king: \"I bade you speak--speak then.\"\n\n\"After the service of the king and the cardinal, came the service of the\nregency, sire; I fought pretty well in the Fronde--much less, though,\nthan the first time. The men began to diminish in stature. I have,\nnevertheless, led your majesty's musketeers on some perilous occasions,\nwhich stand upon the orders of the day of the company. Mine was a\nbeautiful luck at that time. I was the favorite of M. de Mazarin.\nLieutenant here! lieutenant there! lieutenant to the right! lieutenant\nto the left! There was not a buffet dealt in France, of which your\nhumble servant did not have the dealing; but soon France was not enough.\nThe cardinal sent me to England on Cromwell's account; another gentleman\nwho was not over gentle, I assure you, sire. I had the honor of knowing\nhim, and I was well able to appreciate him. A great deal was promised\nme on account of that mission. So, as I did much more than I had been\nbidden to do, I was generously paid, for I was at length appointed\ncaptain of the musketeers; that is to say, the most envied position in\ncourt, which takes precedence over the marshals of France, and justly;\nfor who says captain of the musketeers says the flower of chivalry and\nking of the brave.\"\n\n\"Captain, monsieur!\" interrupted the king; \"you make a mistake.\nLieutenant, you mean.\"\n\n\"Not at all, sire--I make no mistake; your majesty may rely upon me in\nthat respect. Monsieur le cardinal gave me the commission himself.\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"But M. de Mazarin, as you know better than anybody, does not often\ngive, and sometimes takes back what he has given; he took it back again\nas soon as peace was made and he was no longer in want of me. Certainly\nI was not worthy to replace M. de Treville, of illustrious memory; but\nthey had promised me, and they had given me; they ought to have stopped\nthere.\"\n\n\"Is that what dissatisfies you monsieur? Well, I shall make inquiries. I\nlove justice; and your claim, though made in military fashion, does not\ndisplease me.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire!\" said the officer, \"your majesty has ill understood me; I no\nlonger claim anything now.\"\n\n\"Excess of delicacy, monsieur; but I will keep my eye upon your affairs,\nand later--\"\n\n\"Oh, sire! what a word!--later! Thirty years have I lived upon that\npromising word, which has been pronounced by so many great personages,\nand which your mouth has, in its turn, just pronounced. Later--that is\nhow I have received a score of wounds, and how I have reached fifty-four\nyears of age without ever having had a louis in my purse, and without\never having met with a protector on my way,--I who have protected so\nmany people! So I change my formula, sire; and when any one says to me\n'Later,' I reply '_Now_.' It is rest that I solicit, sire. That may be\neasily granted me. That will cost nobody anything.\"\n\n\"I did not look for this language, monsieur, particularly from a man\nwho has always lived among the great. You forget you are speaking to the\nking, to a gentleman who is, I suppose, as of good a house as yourself;\nand when I say later, I mean a certainty.\"\n\n\"I do not at all doubt it, sire; but this is the end of the terrible\ntruth I had to tell you. If I were to see upon that table a _marshal's_\nstick, the sword of constable, the crown of Poland, instead of later, I\nswear to you, sire, that I should still say _Now!_ Oh, excuse me, sire!\nI am from the country of your grandfather, Henry IV. I do not speak\noften: but when I do speak, I speak all.\"\n\n\"The future of my reign has little temptation for you, monsieur, it\nappears,\" said Louis, haughtily.\n\n\"Forgetfulness, forgetfulness everywhere!\" cried the officer, with a\nnoble air; \"the master has forgotten the servant, so the servant is\nreduced to forget his master. I live in unfortunate times, sire. I see\nyouth full of discouragement and fear, I see it timid and despoiled,\nwhen it ought to be rich and powerful. I yesterday evening, for example,\nopen the door to a king of England, whose father, humble as I am, I\nwas near saving, if God had not been against me--God, who inspired His\nelect, Cromwell! I open, I said, the door, that is to say, the palace of\none brother to another brother, and I see--stop, sire, that is a load\non my heart!--I see the minister of that king drive away the proscribed\nprince, and humiliate his master by condemning to want another king, his\nequal. Then I see my prince, who is young, handsome and brave, who\nhas courage in his heart and lightening in his eye,--I see him tremble\nbefore a priest, who laughs at him behind the curtain of his alcove,\nwhere he digests all the gold of France, which he afterwards stuffs\ninto secret coffers. Yes--I understand your looks, sire. I am bold to\nmadness; but what is to be said? I am an old man, and I tell you here,\nsire, to you, my king, things which I would cram down the throat of any\none who should dare to pronounce them before me. You have commanded me,\nto pour out the bottom of my heart before you, sire, and I cast at the\nfeet of your majesty the pent-up indignation of thirty years, as I would\npour out all my blood, if your majesty commanded me to do so.\"\n\nThe king, without speaking a word, wiped the drops of cold and abundant\nperspiration which trickled from his temples. The moment of silence\nwhich followed this vehement outbreak represented for him who had\nspoken, and for him who had listened, ages of suffering.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the king at length, \"you spoke the word forgetfulness.\nI have heard nothing but that word; I will reply, then, to it alone.\nOthers have perhaps been able to forget, but I have not, and the proof\nis, that I remember that one day of riot, that one day when the furious\npeople, raging and roaring as the sea, invaded the royal palace; that\none day when I feigned sleep in my bed, one man alone, naked sword in\nhand, concealed behind my curtain, watched over my life, ready to risk\nhis own for me, as he had before risked it twenty times for the lives of\nmy family. Was not the gentleman, whose name I then demanded, called M.\nd'Artagnan? say, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Your majesty has a good memory,\" replied the officer, coldly.\n\n\"You see, then,\" continued the king, \"if I have such remembrances of my\nchildhood, what an amount I may gather in the age of reason.\"\n\n\"Your majesty has been richly endowed by God,\" said the officer, in the\nsame tone.\n\n\"Come, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" continued Louis, with feverish agitation,\n\"ought you not to be patient as I am? Ought you not to do as I do?\nCome!\"\n\n\"And what do you do, sire?\"\n\n\"I wait.\"\n\n\"Your majesty may do so, because you are young; but I, sire, have not\ntime to wait; old age is at my door, and death is behind it, looking\ninto the very depths of my house. Your majesty is beginning life, its\nfuture is full of hope and fortune; but I, sire, I am on the other side\nof the horizon, and we are so far from each other, that I should never\nhave time to wait till your majesty came up to me.\"\n\nLouis made another turn in his apartment, still wiping the moisture from\nhis brow, in a manner that would have terrified his physicians, if his\nphysicians had witnessed the state his majesty was in.\n\n\"It is very well, monsieur,\" said Louis XIV., in a sharp voice; \"you are\ndesirous of having your discharge, and you shall have it. You offer me\nyour resignation of the rank of lieutenant of the musketeers?\"\n\n\"I deposit it humbly at your majesty's feet, sire.\"\n\n\"That is sufficient. I will order your pension.\"\n\n\"I shall have a thousand obligations to your majesty.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the king, with a violent effort, \"I think you are\nlosing a good master.\"\n\n\"And I am sure of it, sire.\"\n\n\"Shall you ever find such another?\"\n\n\"Oh, sire! I know that your majesty is alone in the world; therefore\nwill I never again take service with any other king upon earth, and will\nnever again have other master than myself.\"\n\n\"You say so?\"\n\n\"I swear so, your majesty.\"\n\n\"I shall remember that word, monsieur.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed.\n\n\"And you know I have a good memory,\" said the king.\n\n\"Yes, sire; and yet I should desire that that memory should fail\nyour majesty in this instance, in order that you might forget all the\nmiseries I have been forced to spread before your eyes. Your majesty is\nso much above the poor and the mean, that I hope--\"\n\n\"My majesty, monsieur, will act like the sun, which looks upon all,\ngreat and small, rich and poor, giving luster to some, warmth to others,\nand life to all. Adieu, Monsieur d'Artagnan--adieu: you are free.\"\n\nAnd the king, with a hoarse sob, which was lost in his throat, passed\nquickly into the next room. D'Artagnan took up his hat from the table on\nwhich he had thrown in, and went out.\n\n\n\nChapter XV. The Proscribed.\n\nD'Artagnan had not reached the bottom of the staircase, when the king\ncalled his gentleman. \"I have a commission to give you, monsieur,\" said\nhe.\n\n\"I am at your majesty's commands.\"\n\n\"Wait, then.\" And the young king began to write the following letter,\nwhich cost him more than one sigh, although, at the same time, something\nlike a feeling of triumph glittered in his eyes:\n\n\"MY LORD CARDINAL,--Thanks to your good counsels, and, above all, thanks\nto your firmness, I have succeeded in overcoming a weakness unworthy of\na king. You have too ably arranged my destiny to allow gratitude not to\nstop me at the moment when I was about to destroy your work. I felt I\nwas wrong to wish to make my life turn from the course you had marked\nout for it. Certainly it would have been a misfortune to France and my\nfamily if a misunderstanding had taken place between me and my minister.\nThis, however, would certainly have happened if I had made your niece my\nwife. I am perfectly aware of this, and will henceforth oppose nothing\nto the accomplishment of my destiny. I am prepared, then, to wed the\ninfanta, Maria Theresa. You may at once open the conference.--Your\naffectionate LOUIS.\"\n\nThe king, after reperusing the letter, sealed it himself.\n\n\"This letter for my lord cardinal,\" said he.\n\nThe gentleman took it. At Mazarin's door he found Bernouin waiting with\nanxiety.\n\n\"Well?\" asked the minister's _valet de chambre_.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the gentleman, \"here is a letter for his eminence.\"\n\n\"A letter! Ah! we expected one after the little journey of the morning.\"\n\n\"Oh! you know, then, that his majesty--\"\n\n\"As first minister, it belongs to the duties of our charge to know\neverything. And his majesty prays and implores, I presume.\"\n\n\"I don't know, but he sighed frequently whilst he was writing.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes; we understand all that; people sigh sometimes from\nhappiness as well as from grief, monsieur.\"\n\n\"And yet the king did not look very happy when he returned, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You did not see clearly. Besides, you only saw his majesty on his\nreturn, for he was only accompanied by the lieutenant of the guards. But\nI had his eminence's telescope; I looked through it when he was tired,\nand I am sure they both wept.\"\n\n\"Well! was it for happiness they wept?\"\n\n\"No, but for love, and they vowed to each other a thousand tendernesses,\nwhich the king asks no better to keep. Now this letter is a beginning of\nthe execution.\"\n\n\"And what does his eminence think of this love, which is, by the bye, no\nsecret to anybody?\"\n\nBernouin took the gentleman by the arm, and whilst ascending the\nstaircase,--\"In confidence,\" said he, in a low voice, \"his eminence\nlooks for success in the affair. I know very well we shall have war with\nSpain; but, bah! war will please the nobles. My lord cardinal, besides,\ncan endow his niece royally, nay, more than royally. There will be\nmoney, festivities, and fire-works--everybody will be delighted.\"\n\n\"Well, for my part,\" replied the gentleman, shaking his head, \"it\nappears to me that this letter is very light to contain all that.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" replied Bernouin, \"I am certain of what I tell you. M.\nd'Artagnan related all that passed to me.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay! and what did he tell you? Let us hear.\"\n\n\"I accosted him by asking him, on the part of the cardinal, if\nthere were any news, without discovering my designs, observe, for M.\nd'Artagnan is a cunning hand. 'My dear Monsieur Bernouin,' he replied,\n'the king is madly in love with Mademoiselle de Mancini, that is all I\nhave to tell you.' And then I asked him: 'Do you think, to such a degree\nthat it will urge him to act contrary to the designs of his eminence?'\n'Ah! don't ask me,' said he; 'I think the king capable of anything; he\nhas a will of iron, and what he wills he wills in earnest. If he takes\nit into his head to marry Mademoiselle de Mancini, he will marry her,\ndepend upon it.' And thereupon he left me and went straight to the\nstables, took a horse, saddled it himself, jumped upon its back, and set\noff as if the devil were at his heels.\"\n\n\"So that you believe, then--\"\n\n\"I believe that monsieur the lieutenant of the guards knew more than he\nwas willing to say.\"\n\n\"In you opinion, then, M. d'Artagnan--\"\n\n\"Is gone, according to all probability, after the exiles, to carry out\nall that can facilitate the success of the king's love.\"\n\nChatting thus, the two confidants arrived at the door of his eminence's\napartment. His eminence's gout had left him; he was walking about his\nchamber in a state of great anxiety, listening at doors and looking out\nof windows. Bernouin entered, followed by the gentleman, who had orders\nfrom the king to place the letter in the hands of the cardinal himself.\nMazarin took the letter, but before opening it, he got up a ready smile,\na smile of circumstance, able to throw a veil over emotions of whatever\nsort they might be. So prepared, whatever was the impression received\nfrom the letter, no reflection of that impression was allowed to\ntranspire upon his countenance.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, when he had read and reread the letter, \"very well,\nmonsieur. Inform the king that I thank him for his obedience to the\nwishes of the queen-mother, and that I will do everything for the\naccomplishment of his will.\"\n\nThe gentleman left the room. The door had scarcely closed before the\ncardinal, who had no mask for Bernouin, took off that which had so\nrecently covered his face, and with a most dismal expression,--\"Call M.\nde Brienne,\" said he. Five minutes afterward the secretary entered.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Mazarin, \"I have just rendered a great service to the\nmonarchy, the greatest I have ever rendered it. You will carry this\nletter, which proves it, to her majesty the queen-mother, and when she\nshall have returned it to you, you will lodge it in portfolio B., which\nis filed with documents and papers relative to my ministry.\"\n\nBrienne went as desired, and, as the letter was unsealed, did not fail\nto read it on his way. There is likewise no doubt that Bernouin, who was\non good terms with everybody, approached so near to the secretary as to\nbe able to read the letter over his shoulder; so that the news spread\nwith such activity through the castle, that Mazarin might have feared\nit would reach the ears of the queen-mother before M. de Brienne could\nconvey Louis XIV.'s letter to her. A moment after orders were given for\ndeparture, and M. de Conde having been to pay his respects to the\nking on his pretended rising, inscribed the city of Poitiers upon his\ntablets, as the place of sojourn and rest for their majesties.\n\nThus in a few instants was unraveled an intrigue which had covertly\noccupied all the diplomacies of Europe. It had nothing, however, very\nclear as a result, but to make a poor lieutenant of musketeers lose his\ncommission and his fortune. It is true, that in exchange he gained his\nliberty. We shall soon know how M. d'Artagnan profited by this. For the\nmoment, if the reader will permit us, we shall return to the hostelry of\n_les Medici_, of which one of the windows opened at the very moment the\norders were given for the departure of the king.\n\nThe window that opened was that of one of the rooms of Charles II. The\nunfortunate prince had passed the night in bitter reflections, his head\nresting on his hands, and his elbows on the table, whilst Parry, infirm\nand old, wearied in body and in mind, had fallen asleep in a corner. A\nsingular fortune was that of this faithful servant, who saw beginning\nfor the second generation the fearful series of misfortunes which had\nweighed so heavily on the first. When Charles II. had well thought over\nthe fresh defeat he had experienced, when he perfectly comprehended the\ncomplete isolation into which he had just fallen, on seeing his fresh\nhope left behind him, he was seized as with a vertigo, and sank back\ninto the large armchair in which he was seated. Then God took pity on\nthe unhappy prince, and sent to console him sleep, the innocent brother\nof death. He did not wake till half-past six, that is to say, till the\nsun shone brightly into his chamber, and Parry, motionless with fear of\nwaking him, was observing with profound grief the eyes of the young man\nalready red with wakefulness, and his cheeks pale with suffering and\nprivations.\n\nAt length the noise of some heavy carts descending towards the Loire\nawakened Charles. He arose, looked around him like a man who has\nforgotten everything, perceived Parry, shook him by the hand, and\ncommanded him to settle the reckoning with Master Cropole. Master\nCropole, being called upon to settle his account with Parry, acquitted\nhimself, it must be allowed, like an honest man; he only made his\ncustomary remark, that the two travelers had eaten nothing, which had\nthe double disadvantage of being humiliating for his kitchen, and of\nforcing him to ask payment for a repast not consumed, but not the less\nlost. Parry had nothing to say to the contrary, and paid.\n\n\"I hope,\" said the king, \"it has not been the same with the horses.\nI don't see that they have eaten at your expense, and it would be a\nmisfortune for travelers like us, who have a long journey to make, to\nhave our horses fail us.\"\n\nBut Cropole, at this doubt, assumed his majestic air, and replied that\nthe stables of _les Medici_ were not less hospitable than its refectory.\n\nThe king mounted his horse; his old servant did the same, and both set\nout towards Paris, without meeting a single person on their road, in the\nstreets or the faubourgs of the city. For the prince the blow was the\nmore severe, as it was a fresh exile. The unfortunates cling to the\nsmallest hopes, as the happy do to the greatest good; and when they are\nobliged to quit the place where that hope has soothed their hearts, they\nexperience the mortal regret which the banished man feels when he places\nhis foot upon the vessel which is to bear him into exile. It appears\nthat the heart already wounded so many times suffers from the least\nscratch; it appears that it considers as a good the momentary absence of\nevil, which is nothing but the absence of pain; and that God, into the\nmost terrible misfortunes, has thrown hope as the drop of water which\nthe rich sinner in hell entreated of Lazarus.\n\nFor one instant even the hope of Charles II. had been more than a\nfugitive joy;--that was when he found himself so kindly welcomed by his\nbrother king; then it had taken a form that had become a reality; then,\nall at once, the refusal of Mazarin had reduced the fictitious reality\nto the state of a dream. This promise of Louis XIV., so soon retracted,\nhad been nothing but a mockery; a mockery like his crown--like his\nscepter--like his friends--like all that had surrounded his royal\nchildhood, and which had abandoned his proscribed youth. Mockery!\neverything was a mockery for Charles II. except the cold, black repose\npromised by death.\n\nSuch were the ideas of the unfortunate prince while sitting listlessly\nupon his horse, to which he abandoned the reins: he rode slowly along\nbeneath the warm May sun, in which the somber misanthropy of the exile\nperceived a last insult to his grief.\n\n\n\nChapter XVI. \"Remember!\"\n\nA horseman going rapidly along the road leading towards Blois, which\nhe had left nearly half an hour before, passed the two travelers, and,\nthough apparently in haste, raised his hat as he passed them. The king\nscarcely observed this young man, who was about twenty-five years of\nage, and who, turning round several times, made friendly signals to a\nman standing before the gate of a handsome white-and-red house; that is\nto say, built of brick and stone, with a slated roof, situated on the\nleft hand of the road the prince was traveling.\n\nThis man, old, tall, and thin, with white hair,--we speak of the one\nstanding by the gate;--this man replied to the farewell signals of the\nyoung one by signs of parting as tender as could have been made by\na father. The young man disappeared at the first turn of the road,\nbordered by fine trees, and the old man was preparing to return to the\nhouse, when the two travelers, arriving in front of the gate, attracted\nhis attention.\n\nThe king, as we have said, was riding with his head cast down, his arms\ninert, leaving his horse to go what pace he liked, whilst Parry, behind\nhim, the better to imbibe the genial influence of the sun, had taken\noff his hat, and was looking about right and left. His eyes encountered\nthose of the old man leaning against the gate; the latter, as if struck\nby some strange spectacle, uttered an exclamation, and made one step\ntowards the two travelers. From Parry his eyes immediately turned\ntowards the king, upon whom they rested for an instant. This\nexamination, however rapid, was instantly reflected in a visible manner\nupon the features of the tall old man. For scarcely had he recognized\nthe younger of the travelers--and we said recognized, for nothing but a\nperfect recognition could have explained such an act--scarcely, we say,\nhad he recognized the younger of the two travelers, than he clapped his\nhands together, with respectful surprise, and, raising his hat from his\nhead, bowed so profoundly that it might have been said he was kneeling.\nThis demonstration, however absent, or rather, however absorbed was the\nking in his reflections, attracted his attention instantly; and checking\nhis horse and turning towards Parry, he exclaimed, \"Good God, Parry,\nwho is that man who salutes me in such a marked manner? Can he know me,\nthink you?\"\n\nParry, much agitated and very pale, had already turned his horse towards\nthe gate. \"Ah, sire!\" said he, stopping suddenly at five or six paces'\ndistance from the still bending old man: \"sire, I am seized with\nastonishment, for I think I recognize that brave man. Yes, it must be\nhe! Will your majesty permit me to speak to him?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Can it be you, Monsieur Grimaud?\" asked Parry.\n\n\"Yes, it is I,\" replied the tall old man, drawing himself up, but\nwithout losing his respectful demeanor.\n\n\"Sire,\" then said Parry, \"I was not deceived. This good man is the\nservant of the Comte de la Fere, and the Comte de la Fere, if you\nremember, is the worthy gentleman of whom I have so often spoken to your\nmajesty that the remembrance of him must remain, not only in your mind,\nbut in your heart.\"\n\n\"He who assisted my father at his last moments?\" asked Charles,\nevidently affected at the remembrance.\n\n\"The same, sire.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said Charles; and then addressing Grimaud, whose penetrating and\nintelligent eyes seemed to search and divine his thoughts.--\"My friend,\"\nsaid he, \"does your master, Monsieur le Comte de la Fere, live in this\nneighborhood?\"\n\n\"There,\" replied Grimaud, pointing with his outstretched arm to the\nwhite-and-red house behind the gate.\n\n\"And is Monsieur le Comte de la Fere at home at present?\"\n\n\"At the back, under the chestnut trees.\"\n\n\"Parry,\" said the king, \"I will not miss this opportunity, so precious\nfor me, to thank the gentleman to whom our house is indebted for such a\nnoble example of devotedness and generosity. Hold my horse, my friend,\nif you please.\" And, throwing the bridle to Grimaud, the king entered\nthe abode of Athos, quite alone, as one equal enters the dwelling\nof another. Charles had been informed by the concise explanation of\nGrimaud,--\"At the back, under the chestnut trees;\" he left, therefore,\nthe house on the left, and went straight down the path indicated. The\nthing was easy; the tops of those noble trees, already covered with\nleaves and flowers, rose above all the rest.\n\nOn arriving under the lozenges, by turns luminous and dark, which\ncheckered the ground of this path according as the trees were more or\nless in leaf, the young prince perceived a gentleman walking with his\narms behind him, apparently plunged in a deep meditation. Without doubt,\nhe had often had this gentleman described to himself, for, without\nhesitating, Charles II. walked straight up to him. At the sound of his\nfootsteps, the Comte de la Fere raised his head, and seeing an unknown\nman of noble and elegant carriage coming towards him, he raised his hat\nand waited. At some paces from him, Charles II. likewise took off his\nhat. Then, as if in reply to the comte's mute interrogation,--\n\n\"Monsieur le Comte,\" said he, \"I come to discharge a debt towards you.\nI have, for a long time, had the expression of a profound gratitude\nto bring you. I am Charles II., son of Charles Stuart, who reigned in\nEngland, and died on the scaffold.\"\n\nOn hearing this illustrious name, Athos felt a kind of shudder creep\nthrough his veins, but at the sight of the young prince standing\nuncovered before him, and stretching out his hand towards him, two\ntears, for an instant, dimmed his brilliant eyes. He bent respectfully,\nbut the prince took him by the hand.\n\n\"See how unfortunate I am, my lord count; it is only due to chance that\nI have met with you. Alas! I ought to have people around me whom I love\nand honor, whereas I am reduced to preserve their services in my heart,\nand their names in my memory: so that if your servant had not recognized\nmine, I should have passed by your door as by that of a stranger.\"\n\n\"It is but too true,\" said Athos, replying with his voice to the first\npart of the king's speech, and with a bow to the second; \"it is but too\ntrue, indeed, that your majesty has seen many evil days.\"\n\n\"And the worst, alas!\" replied Charles, \"are perhaps still to come.\"\n\n\"Sire, let us hope.\"\n\n\"Count, count,\" continued Charles, shaking his head, \"I entertained hope\ntill last night, and that of a good Christian, I swear.\"\n\nAthos looked at the king as if to interrogate him.\n\n\"Oh, the history is soon related,\" said Charles. \"Proscribed, despoiled,\ndisdained, I resolved, in spite of all my repugnance, to tempt fortune\none last time. Is it not written above, that, for our family, all good\nfortune and all bad fortune shall eternally come from France? You know\nsomething of that, monsieur,--you, who are one of the Frenchmen whom my\nunfortunate father found at the foot of his scaffold, on the day of his\ndeath, after having found them at his right hand on the day of battle.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Athos modestly, \"I was not alone. My companions and I did,\nunder the circumstances, our duty as gentlemen, and that was all. Your\nmajesty was about to do me the honor to relate--\"\n\n\"That is true, I had the protection,--pardon my hesitation, count, but,\nfor a Stuart, you, who understand everything, you will comprehend that\nthe word is hard to pronounce;--I had, I say, the protection of my\ncousin the stadtholder of Holland; but without the intervention, or at\nleast without the authorization of France, the stadtholder would not\ntake the initiative. I came, then, to ask this authorization of the king\nof France, who has refused me.\"\n\n\"The king has refused you, sire!\"\n\n\"Oh, not he; all justice must be rendered to my younger brother Louis;\nbut Monsieur de Mazarin--\"\n\nAthos bit his lips.\n\n\"You perhaps think I should have expected this refusal?\" said the king,\nwho had noticed the movement.\n\n\"That was, in truth, my thought, sire,\" replied Athos, respectfully; \"I\nknow that Italian of old.\"\n\n\"Then I determined to come to the test, and know at once the last word\nof my destiny. I told my brother Louis, that, not to compromise either\nFrance or Holland, I would tempt fortune myself in person, as I had\nalready done, with two hundred gentlemen, if he would give them to me;\nand a million, if he would lend it me.\"\n\n\"Well, sire?\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, I am suffering at this moment something strange, and\nthat is, the satisfaction of despair. There is in certain souls,--and I\nhave just discovered that mine is of the number,--a real satisfaction in\nthe assurance that all is lost, and the time is come to yield.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope,\" said Athos, \"that your majesty is not come to that\nextremity.\"\n\n\"To say so, my lord count, to endeavor to revive hope in my heart, you\nmust have ill understood what I have just told you. I came to Blois\nto ask of my brother Louis the alms of a million, with which I had the\nhopes of re-establishing my affairs; and my brother Louis has refused\nme. You see, then, plainly, that all is lost.\"\n\n\"Will your majesty permit me to express a contrary opinion?\"\n\n\"How is that, count? Do you think my heart of so low an order that I do\nnot know how to face my position?\"\n\n\"Sire, I have always seen that it was in desperate positions that\nsuddenly the great turns of fortune have taken place.\"\n\n\"Thank you, count: it is some comfort to meet with a heart like yours;\nthat is to say, sufficiently trustful in God and in monarchy, never to\ndespair of a royal fortune, however low it may be fallen. Unfortunately,\nmy dear count, your words are like those remedies they call 'sovereign,'\nand which, though able to cure curable wounds or diseases, fail against\ndeath. Thank you for your perseverance in consoling me, count, thanks\nfor your devoted remembrance, but I know in what I must trust--nothing\nwill save me now. And see, my friend, I was so convinced, that I was\ntaking the route of exile, with my old Parry; I was returning to devour\nmy poignant griefs in the little hermitage offered me by Holland. There,\nbelieve me, count, all will soon be over, and death will come quickly;\nit is called so often by this body, eaten up by its soul, and by this\nsoul, which aspires to heaven.\"\n\n\"Your majesty has a mother, a sister, and brothers; your majesty is the\nhead of the family, and ought, therefore, to ask a long life of God,\ninstead of imploring Him for a prompt death. Your majesty is an exile,\na fugitive, but you have right on your side; you ought to aspire to\ncombats, dangers, business, and not to rest in heavens.\"\n\n\"Count,\" said Charles II., with a smile of indescribable sadness, \"have\nyou ever heard of a king who reconquered his kingdom with one servant\nthe age of Parry, and with three hundred crowns which that servant\ncarried in his purse?\"\n\n\"No, sire; but I have heard--and that more than once--that a dethroned\nking has recovered his kingdom with a firm will, perseverance, some\nfriends, and a million skillfully employed.\"\n\n\"But you cannot have understood me. The million I asked of my brother\nLouis was refused me.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Athos, \"will your majesty grant me a few minutes, and\nlisten attentively to what remains for me to say to you?\"\n\nCharles II. looked earnestly at Athos. \"Willingly, monsieur,\" said he.\n\n\"Then I will show your majesty the way,\" resumed the count, directing\nhis steps towards the house. He then conducted the king to his study,\nand begged him to be seated. \"Sire,\" said he, \"your majesty just now\ntold me that, in the present state of England, a million would suffice\nfor the recovery of your kingdom.\"\n\n\"To attempt it at least, monsieur; and to die as a king if I should not\nsucceed.\"\n\n\"Well, then, sire, let your majesty, according to the promise you have\nmade me, have the goodness to listen to what I have to say.\" Charles\nmade an affirmative sign with his head. Athos walked straight up to the\ndoor, the bolts of which he drew, after looking to see if anybody was\nnear, and then returned. \"Sire,\" said he, \"your majesty has kindly\nremembered that I lent assistance to the very noble and very unfortunate\nCharles I., when his executioners conducted him from St. James's to\nWhitehall.\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly I do remember it, and always shall remember it.\"\n\n\"Sire, it is a dismal history to be heard by a son who no doubt has\nhad it related to him many times; and yet I ought to repeat it to your\nmajesty without omitting one detail.\"\n\n\"Speak on, monsieur.\"\n\n\"When the king your father ascended the scaffold, or rather when he\npassed from his chamber to the scaffold, on a level with his window,\neverything was prepared for his escape. The executioner was got out of\nthe way; a hole contrived under the floor of his apartment; I myself was\nbeneath the funeral vault, which I heard all at once creak beneath his\nfeet.\"\n\n\"Parry has related to me all these terrible details, monsieur.\"\n\nAthos bowed and resumed. \"But here is something he had not related to\nyou, sire, for what follows passed between God, your father, and myself;\nand never has the revelation of it been made even to my dearest friends.\n'Go a little further off,' said the august prisoner to the executioner;\n'it is but for an instant, and I know that I belong to you; but remember\nnot to strike till I give the signal. I wish to offer up my prayers in\nfreedom.\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said Charles II., turning very pale, \"but you, count, who\nknow so many details of this melancholy event,--details which, as you\nsaid just now, have never been revealed to any one,--do you know the\nname of that infernal executioner, of that base wretch who concealed his\nface that he might assassinate a king with impunity?\"\n\nAthos became slightly pale. \"His name?\" said he, \"yes, I know it, but\ncannot tell it.\"\n\n\"And what is become of him, for nobody in England knows his destiny?\"\n\n\"He is dead.\"\n\n\"But he did not die in his bed; he did not die a calm and peaceful\ndeath; he did not die the death of the good?\"\n\n\"He died a violent death, in a terrible night, rendered so by the\npassions of man and a tempest from God. His body, pierced by a dagger,\nsank to the depths of the ocean. God pardon his murderer!\"\n\n\"Proceed, then,\" said Charles II., seeing that the count was unwilling\nto say more.\n\n\"The king of England, after having, as I have said, spoken thus to the\nmasked executioner, added,--'Observe, you will not strike till I shall\nstretch out my arms, saying--REMEMBER!'\"\n\n\"I was aware,\" said Charles, in an agitated voice, \"that that was the\nlast word pronounced by my unfortunate father. But why and for whom?\"\n\n\"For the French gentleman placed beneath his scaffold.\"\n\n\"For you, then, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire; and every one of the words which he spoke to me, through the\nplanks of the scaffold covered with a black cloth, still sounds in my\nears. The king knelt down on one knee: 'Comte de la Fere,' said he, 'are\nyou there?' 'Yes, sire,' replied I. Then the king stooped towards the\nboards.\"\n\nCharles II., also palpitating with interest, burning with grief, stooped\ntowards Athos, to catch, one by one, every word that escaped from him.\nHis head touched that of the comte.\n\n\"Then,\" continued Athos, \"the king stooped. 'Comte de la Fere,' said\nhe, 'I could not be saved by you: it was not to be. Now, even though I\ncommit a sacrilege, I must speak to you. Yes, I have spoken to men--yes,\nI have spoken to God, and I speak to you the last. To sustain a cause\nwhich I thought sacred, I have lost the throne of my fathers and the\nheritage of my children.'\"\n\nCharles II. concealed his face in his hands, and a bitter tear glided\nbetween his white and slender fingers.\n\n\"'I have still a million in gold,' continued the king. 'I buried it\nin the vaults of the castle of Newcastle, a moment before I left that\ncity.'\" Charles raised his head with an expression of such painful\njoy that it would have drawn tears from any one acquainted with his\nmisfortunes.\n\n\"A million!\" murmured he, \"Oh, count!\"\n\n\"'You alone know that this money exists: employ it when you think it can\nbe of the greatest service to my eldest son. And now, Comte de la Fere,\nbid me adieu!'\n\n\"'Adieu, adieu, sire!' cried I.\"\n\nCharles arose, and went and leant his burning brow against the window.\n\n\"It was then,\" continued Athos, \"that the king pronounced the word\n'REMEMBER!' addressed to me. You see, sire, that I have remembered.\"\n\nThe king could not resist or conceal his emotion. Athos beheld the\nmovement of his shoulders, which undulated convulsively; he heard the\nsobs which burst from his over-charged breast. He was silent himself,\nsuffocated by the flood of bitter remembrances he had just poured upon\nthat royal head. Charles II., with a violent effort, left the window,\ndevoured his tears, and came and sat by Athos. \"Sire,\" said the latter,\n\"I thought till to-day that the time had not yet arrived for the\nemployment of that last resource; but, with my eyes fixed upon England,\nI felt it was approaching. To-morrow I meant to go and inquire in what\npart of the world your majesty was, and then I purposed going to you.\nYou come to me, sire; that is an indication that God is with us.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said Charles, in a voice choked by emotion, \"you are, for me,\nwhat an angel sent from heaven would be,--you are a preserver sent to\nme from the tomb of my father himself; but, believe me, for ten years'\ncivil war has passed over my country, striking down men, tearing up\nsoil, it is no more probable that gold should remain in the entrails of\nthe earth, than love in the hearts of my subjects.\"\n\n\"Sire, the spot in which his majesty buried the million is well known to\nme, and no one, I am sure, has been able to discover it. Besides, is the\ncastle of Newcastle quite destroyed? Have they demolished it stone by\nstone, and uprooted the soil to the last tree?\"\n\n\"No, it is still standing: but at this moment General Monk occupies it\nand is encamped there. The only spot from which I could look for succor,\nwhere I possess a single resource, you see, is invaded by my enemies.\"\n\n\"General Monk, sire, cannot have discovered the treasure which I speak\nof.\"\n\n\"Yes, but can I go and deliver myself up to Monk, in order to recover\nthis treasure? Ah! count, you see plainly I must yield to destiny, since\nit strikes me to the earth every time I rise. What can I do with Parry\nas my only servant, with Parry, whom Monk has already driven from his\npresence? No, no, no, count, we must yield to this last blow.\"\n\n\"But what your majesty cannot do, and what Parry can no more attempt, do\nyou not believe that I could succeed in accomplishing?\"\n\n\"You--you, count--you would go?\"\n\n\"If it please your majesty,\" said Athos, bowing to the king, \"yes, I\nwill go, sire.\"\n\n\"What! you so happy here, count?\"\n\n\"I am never happy when I have a duty left to accomplish, and it is an\nimperative duty which the king your father left me to watch over your\nfortunes, and make a royal use of his money. So, if your majesty honors\nme with a sign, I will go with you.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\" said the king, forgetting all royal etiquette and\nthrowing his arms around the neck of Athos, \"you prove to me that there\nis a God in heaven, and that this God sometimes sends messengers to the\nunfortunate who groan on the earth.\"\n\nAthos, exceedingly moved by this burst of feeling of the young man,\nthanked him with profound respect, and approached the window. \"Grimaud!\"\ncried he, \"bring out my horses.\"\n\n\"What, now--immediately!\" said the king. \"Ah, monsieur, you are indeed a\nwonderful man!\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Athos, \"I know nothing more pressing than your majesty's\nservice. Besides,\" added he, smiling, \"it is a habit contracted long\nsince, in the service of the queen your aunt, and of the king your\nfather. How is it possible for me to lose it at the moment your\nmajesty's service calls for it?\"\n\n\"What a man!\" murmured the king.\n\nThen, after a moment's reflection,--\"But no, count, I cannot expose you\nto such privations. I have no means of rewarding such services.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Athos, laughing. \"Your majesty is joking; have you not a\nmillion? Ah! why am I not possessed of half such a sum! I would already\nhave raised a regiment. But, thank God! I have still a few rolls of gold\nand some family diamonds left. Your majesty will, I hope, deign to share\nwith a devoted servant.\"\n\n\"With a friend--yes, count, but on condition that, in his turn, that\nfriend will share with me hereafter!\"\n\n\"Sire!\" said Athos, opening a casket, form which he drew both gold and\njewels, \"you see, sire, we are too rich. Fortunately, there are four of\nus, in the event of our meeting with thieves.\"\n\nJoy made the blood rush to the pale cheeks of Charles II., as he saw\nAthos's two horses, led by Grimaud, already booted for the journey,\nadvance towards the porch.\n\n\"Blaisois, this letter for the Vicomte de Bragelonne. For everybody\nelse I am gone to Paris. I confide the house to you, Blaisois.\" Blaisois\nbowed, shook hands with Grimaud, and shut the gate.\n\n\n\nChapter XVII. In which Aramis is sought, and only Bazin is found.\n\nTwo hours had scarcely elapsed since the departure of the master of the\nhouse, who, in Blaisois's sight, had taken the road to Paris, when a\nhorseman, mounted on a good pied horse, stopped before the gate,\nand with a sonorous \"_hola!_\" called the stable-boys, who, with the\ngardeners, had formed a circle round Blaisois, the historian-in-ordinary\nto the household of the chateau. This \"_hola_,\" doubtless well known\nto Master Blaisois, made him turn his head and exclaim--\"Monsieur\nd'Artagnan! run quickly, you chaps, and open the gate.\"\n\nA swarm of eight brisk lads flew to the gate, which was opened as if it\nhad been made of feathers; and every one loaded him with attentions, for\nthey knew the welcome this friend was accustomed to receive from their\nmaster; and for such remarks the eye of the valet may always be depended\nupon.\n\n\"Ah!\" said M. d'Artagnan, with an agreeable smile, balancing himself\nupon his stirrup to jump to the ground, \"where is that dear count?\"\n\n\"Ah! how unfortunate you are, monsieur!\" said Blaisois: \"and how\nunfortunate will monsieur le comte, our master, think himself when he\nhears of your coming! As ill luck will have it, monsieur le comte left\nhome two hours ago.\"\n\nD'Artagnan did not trouble himself about such trifles. \"Very good!\" said\nhe. \"You always speak the best French in the world; you shall give me a\nlesson in grammar and correct language, whilst I wait the return of your\nmaster.\"\n\n\"That is impossible, monsieur,\" said Blaisois; \"you would have to wait\ntoo long.\"\n\n\"Will he not come back to-day, then?\"\n\n\"No, nor to-morrow, nor the day after to-morrow. Monsieur le comte has\ngone on a journey.\"\n\n\"A journey!\" said D'Artagnan, surprised; \"that's a fable, Master\nBlaisois.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, it is no more than the truth. Monsieur has done me the honor\nto give me the house in charge; and he added, with his voice so full of\nauthority and kindness--that is all one to me: 'You will say I have gone\nto Paris.'\"\n\n\"Well!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"since he is gone towards Paris, that is all\nI wanted to know! you should have told me so at first, booby! He is then\ntwo hours in advance?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I shall soon overtake him. Is he alone?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Who is with him, then?\"\n\n\"A gentleman whom I don't know, an old man, and M. Grimaud.\"\n\n\"Such a party cannot travel as fast as I can--I will start.\"\n\n\"Will monsieur listen to me an instant?\" said Blaisois, laying his hand\ngently on the reins of the horse.\n\n\"Yes, if you don't favor me with fine speeches, and make haste.\"\n\n\"Well, then, monsieur, that word Paris appears to me to be only an\nexcuse.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said D'Artagnan, seriously, \"an excuse, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur: and monsieur le comte is not going to Paris, I will\nswear.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"This,--M. Grimaud always knows where our master is going; and he had\npromised me that the first time he went to Paris, he would take a little\nmoney for me to my wife.\"\n\n\"What, have you a wife, then?\"\n\n\"I had one--she was of this country; but monsieur thought her a noisy\nscold, and I sent her to Paris; it is sometimes inconvenient, but very\nagreeable at others.\"\n\n\"I understand; but go on. You do not believe the count gone to Paris?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; for then M. Grimaud would have broken his word; he would\nhave perjured himself, and that is impossible.\"\n\n\"That is impossible,\" repeated D'Artagnan, quite in a study, because he\nwas quite convinced. \"Well, my brave Blaisois, many thanks to you.\"\n\nBlaisois bowed.\n\n\"Come, you know I am not curious--I have serious business with your\nmaster. Could you not, by a little bit of a word--you who speak so\nwell--give me to understand--one syllable only--I will guess the rest.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, monsieur, I cannot. I am quite ignorant where monsieur le\ncomte is gone. As to listening at doors, that is contrary to my nature;\nand besides, it is forbidden here.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said D'Artagnan, \"this is a very bad beginning for me.\nNever mind; you know when monsieur le comte will return, at least?\"\n\n\"As little, monsieur, as the place of his destination.\"\n\n\"Come, Blaisois, come, search.\"\n\n\"Monsieur doubts my sincerity? Ah, monsieur, that grieves me much.\"\n\n\"The devil take his gilded tongue!\" grumbled D'Artagnan. \"A clown with a\nword would be worth a dozen of him. Adieu!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I have the honor to present you my respects.\"\n\n\"_Cuistre!_\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"the fellow is unbearable.\" He\ngave another look up to the house, turned his horse's head, and set off\nlike a man who has nothing either annoying or embarrassing in his mind.\nWhen he was at the end of the wall, and out of sight,--\"Well, now, I\nwonder,\" said he, breathing quickly, \"whether Athos was at home. No; all\nthose idlers, standing with their arms crossed, would have been at work\nif the eye of the master was near. Athos gone on a journey?--that is\nincomprehensible. Bah! it is all devilish mysterious! And then--no--he\nis not the man I want. I want one of a cunning, patient mind. My\nbusiness is at Melun, in a certain presbytery I am acquainted with.\nForty-five leagues--four days and a half! Well, it is fine weather, and\nI am free. Never mind the distance!\"\n\nAnd he put his horse into a trot, directing his course towards Paris. On\nthe fourth day he alighted at Melun, as he had intended.\n\nD'Artagnan was never in the habit of asking any one on the road for any\ncommon information. For these sorts of details, unless in very serious\ncircumstances, he confided in his perspicacity, which was so seldom\nat fault, in his experience of thirty years, and in a great habit of\nreading the physiognomies of houses, as well as those of men. At Melun,\nD'Artagnan immediately found the presbytery--a charming house, plastered\nover red brick, with vines climbing along the gutters, and a cross, in\ncarved stone, surmounting the ridge of the roof. From the ground-floor\nof this house came a noise, or rather a confusion of voices, like the\nchirping of young birds when the brood is just hatched under the down.\nOne of these voices was spelling the alphabet distinctly. A voice thick,\nyet pleasant, at the same time scolded the talkers and corrected the\nfaults of the reader. D'Artagnan recognized that voice, and as the\nwindow of the ground-floor was open, he leant down from his horse under\nthe branches and red fibers of the vine and cried, \"Bazin, my dear\nBazin! good-day to you.\"\n\nA short, fat man, with a flat face, a cranium ornamented with a crown\nof gray hairs, cut short, in imitation of a tonsure, and covered with an\nold black velvet cap, arose as soon as he heard D'Artagnan--we ought not\nto say arose, but _bounded up_. In fact, Bazin bounded up, carrying with\nhim his little low chair, which the children tried to take away, with\nbattles more fierce than those of the Greeks endeavoring to recover the\nbody of Patroclus from the hands of the Trojans. Bazin did more than\nbound; he let fall both his alphabet and his ferule. \"You!\" said he;\n\"you, Monsieur D'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Yes, myself! Where is Aramis--no, M. le Chevalier d'Herblay--no, I am\nstill mistaken--Monsieur le Vicaire-General?\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" said Bazin, with dignity, \"monseigneur is at his\ndiocese.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" said D'Artagnan. Bazin repeated the sentence.\n\n\"Ah, ah! but has Aramis a diocese?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur. Why not?\"\n\n\"Is he a bishop, then?\"\n\n\"Why, where can you come from,\" said Bazin, rather irreverently, \"that\nyou don't know that?\"\n\n\"My dear Bazin, we pagans, we men of the sword, know very well when a\nman is made a colonel, or maitre-de-camp, or marshal of France; but if\nhe be made a bishop, arch-bishop, or pope--devil take me if the news\nreaches us before the three quarters of the earth have had the advantage\nof it!\"\n\n\"Hush! hush!\" said Bazin, opening his eyes: \"do not spoil these poor\nchildren, in whom I am endeavoring to inculcate such good principles.\"\nIn fact, the children had surrounded D'Artagnan, whose horse, long\nsword, spurs, and martial air they very much admired. But above all,\nthey admired his strong voice; so that, when he uttered his oath, the\nwhole school cried out, \"The devil take me!\" with fearful bursts\nof laughter, shouts, and bounds, which delighted the musketeer, and\nbewildered the old pedagogue.\n\n\"There!\" said he, \"hold your tongues, you brats! You have come, M.\nd'Artagnan, and all my good principles fly away. With you, as usual,\ncomes disorder. Babel is revived. Ah! Good Lord! Ah! the wild little\nwretches!\" And the worthy Bazin distributed right and left blows which\nincreased the cries of his scholars by changing the nature of them.\n\n\"At least,\" said he, \"you will no longer decoy any one here.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said D'Artagnan, with a smile which made a shudder\ncreep over the shoulders of Bazin.\n\n\"He is capable of it,\" murmured he.\n\n\"Where is your master's diocese?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur Rene is bishop of Vannes.\"\n\n\"Who had him nominated?\"\n\n\"Why, monsieur le surintendant, our neighbor.\"\n\n\"What! Monsieur Fouquet?\"\n\n\"To be sure he did.\"\n\n\"Is Aramis on good terms with him, then?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur preached every Sunday at the house of monsieur le\nsurintendant at Vaux; then they hunted together.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"And monseigneur composed his homilies--no, I mean his sermons--with\nmonsieur le surintendant.\"\n\n\"Bah! he preached in verse, then, this worthy bishop?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, for the love of heaven, do not jest with sacred things.\"\n\n\"There, Bazin, there! So, then, Aramis is at Vannes?\"\n\n\"At Vannes, in Bretagne.\"\n\n\"You are a deceitful old hunks, Bazin; that is not true.\"\n\n\"See, monsieur, if you please; the apartments of the presbytery are\nempty.\"\n\n\"He is right there,\" said D'Artagnan, looking attentively at the house,\nthe aspect of which announced solitude.\n\n\"But monseigneur must have written you an account of his promotion.\"\n\n\"When did it take place?\"\n\n\"A month back.\"\n\n\"Oh! then there is no time lost. Aramis cannot yet have wanted me. But\nhow is it, Bazin, you do not follow your master?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I cannot; I have occupations.\"\n\n\"Your alphabet?\"\n\n\"And my penitents.\"\n\n\"What, do you confess, then? Are you a priest?\"\n\n\"The same as one. I have such a call.\"\n\n\"But the orders?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Bazin, without hesitation, \"now that monseigneur is a bishop,\nI shall soon have my orders, or at least my dispensations.\" And he\nrubbed his hands.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"there will be no means of\nuprooting these people. Get me some supper, Bazin.\"\n\n\"With pleasure, monsieur.\"\n\n\"A fowl, a _bouillon,_ and a bottle of wine.\"\n\n\"This is Saturday night, monsieur--it is a day of abstinence.\"\n\n\"I have a dispensation,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\nBazin looked at him suspiciously.\n\n\"Ah, ah, master hypocrite!\" said the musketeer, \"for whom do you take\nme? If you, who are the valet, hope for dispensation to commit a crime,\nshall not I, the friend of your bishop, have dispensation for eating\nmeat at the call of my stomach? Make yourself agreeable with me, Bazin,\nor by heavens! I will complain to the king, and you shall never confess.\nNow you know that the nomination of bishops rests with the king,--I have\nthe king, I am the stronger.\"\n\nBazin smiled hypocritically. \"Ah, but we have monsieur le surintendant,\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"And you laugh at the king, then?\"\n\nBazin made no reply; his smile was sufficiently eloquent.\n\n\"My supper,\" said D'Artagnan, \"it is getting towards seven o'clock.\"\n\nBazin turned round and ordered the eldest of the pupils to inform the\ncook. In the meantime, D'Artagnan surveyed the presbytery.\n\n\"Phew!\" said he, disdainfully, \"monseigneur lodged his grandeur very\nmeanly here.\"\n\n\"We have the Chateau de Vaux,\" said Bazin.\n\n\"Which is perhaps equal to the Louvre?\" said D'Artagnan, jeeringly.\n\n\"Which is better,\" replied Bazin, with the greatest coolness imaginable.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\nHe would perhaps have prolonged the discussion, and maintained the\nsuperiority of the Louvre, but the lieutenant perceived that his horse\nremained fastened to the bars of a gate.\n\n\"The devil!\" said he. \"Get my horse looked after; your master the bishop\nhas none like him in his stables.\"\n\nBazin cast a sidelong glance at the horse, and replied, \"Monsieur le\nsurintendant gave him four from his own stables; and each of the four is\nworth four of yours.\"\n\nThe blood mounted to the face of D'Artagnan. His hand itched and his eye\nglanced over the head of Bazin, to select the place upon which he should\ndischarge his anger. But it passed away; reflection came, and D'Artagnan\ncontented himself with saying,--\n\n\"The devil! the devil! I have done well to quit the service of the\nking. Tell me, worthy Master Bazin,\" added he, \"how many musketeers does\nmonsieur le surintendant retain in his service?\"\n\n\"He could have all there are in the kingdom with his money,\" replied\nBazin, closing his book, and dismissing the boys with some kindly blows\nof his cane.\n\n\"The devil! the devil!\" repeated D'Artagnan, once more, as if to annoy\nthe pedagogue. But as supper was now announced, he followed the cook,\nwho introduced him into the refectory, where it awaited him. D'Artagnan\nplaced himself at the table, and began a hearty attack upon his fowl.\n\n\"It appears to me,\" said D'Artagnan, biting with all his might at the\ntough fowl they had served up to him, and which they had evidently\nforgotten to fatten,--\"it appears that I have done wrong in not seeking\nservice with that master yonder. A powerful noble this intendant,\nseemingly! In good truth, we poor fellows know nothing at the court, and\nthe rays of the sun prevent our seeing the large stars, which are also\nsuns, at a little greater distance from our earth,--that is all.\"\n\nAs D'Artagnan delighted, both from pleasure and system, in making people\ntalk about things which interested him, he fenced in his best style\nwith Master Bazin, but it was pure loss of time; beyond the tiresome and\nhyperbolical praises of monsieur le surintendant of the finances, Bazin,\nwho, on his side, was on his guard, afforded nothing but platitudes to\nthe curiosity of D'Artagnan, so that our musketeer, in a tolerably bad\nhumor, desired to go to bed as soon as he had supped. D'Artagnan was\nintroduced by Bazin into a mean chamber, in which there was a poor bed;\nbut D'Artagnan was not fastidious in that respect. He had been told that\nAramis had taken away the key of his own private apartment, and as he\nknew Aramis was a very particular man, and had generally many things\nto conceal in his apartment, he had not been surprised. He, therefore,\nalthough it seemed comparatively even harder, attacked the bed as\nbravely as he had done the fowl; and, as he had as good an inclination\nto sleep as he had had to eat, he took scarcely longer time to be\nsnoring harmoniously than he had employed in picking the last bones of\nthe bird.\n\nSince he was no longer in the service of any one, D'Artagnan had\npromised himself to indulge in sleeping as soundly as he had formerly\nslept lightly; but with whatever good faith D'Artagnan had made himself\nthis promise, and whatever desire he might have to keep it religiously,\nhe was awakened in the middle of the night by a loud noise of carriages,\nand servants on horseback. A sudden illumination flashed over the walls\nof his chamber; he jumped out of bed and ran to the window in his shirt.\n\"Can the king be coming this way?\" he thought, rubbing his eyes; \"in\ntruth, such a suite can only be attached to royalty.\"\n\n\"_Vive le monsieur le surintendant!_\" cried, or rather vociferated, from\na window on the ground-floor, a voice which he recognized as Bazin's,\nwho at the same time waved a handkerchief with one hand, and held\na large candle in the other. D'Artagnan then saw something like a\nbrilliant human form leaning out of the principal carriage; at the same\ntime loud bursts of laughter, caused, no doubt, by the strange figure of\nBazin, and issuing from the same carriage, left, as it were, a train of\njoy upon the passage of the rapid _cortege_.\n\n\"I might easily see it was not the king,\" said D'Artagnan; \"people don't\nlaugh so heartily when the king passes. _Hola_, Bazin!\" cried he to his\nneighbor, three-quarters of whose body still hung out of the window, to\nfollow the carriage with his eyes as long as he could. \"What is all that\nabout?\"\n\n\"It is M. Fouquet,\" said Bazin, in a patronizing tone.\n\n\"And all those people?\"\n\n\"That is the court of M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said D'Artagnan; \"what would M. de Mazarin say to that if he\nheard it?\" And he returned to his bed, asking himself how Aramis\nalways contrived to be protected by the most powerful personages in the\nkingdom. \"Is it that he has more luck than I, or that I am a greater\nfool than he? Bah!\" That was the concluding word by the aid of which\nD'Artagnan, having become wise, now terminated every thought and every\nperiod of his style. Formerly he said, \"_Mordioux!_\" which was a\nprick of the spur, but now he had become older, and he murmured that\nphilosophical \"_Bah!_\" which served as a bridle to all the passions.\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII. In which D'Artagnan seeks Porthos, and only finds\nMousqueton.\n\nWhen D'Artagnan had perfectly convinced himself that the absence of\nthe Vicar-General d'Herblay was real, and that his friend was not to be\nfound at Melun or in its vicinity, he left Bazin without regret, cast\nan ill-natured glance at the magnificent Chateau de Vaux, which was\nbeginning to shine with that splendor which brought on its ruin, and,\ncompressing his lips like a man full of mistrust and suspicion, he put\nspurs to his pied horse, saying, \"Well, well! I have still Pierrefonds\nleft, and there I shall find the best man and the best filled coffer.\nAnd that is all I want, for I have an idea of my own.\"\n\nWe will spare our readers the prosaic incidents of D'Artagnan's journey,\nwhich terminated on the morning of the third day within sight of\nPierrefonds. D'Artagnan came by the way of Nanteuil-le-Haudouin and\nCrepy. At a distance he perceived the Castle of Louis of Orleans, which,\nhaving become part of the crown domain, was kept by an old _concierge_.\nThis was one of those marvelous manors of the middle ages, with walls\ntwenty feet in thickness, and a hundred in height.\n\nD'Artagnan rode slowly past its walls, measured its towers with his eye\nand descended into the valley. From afar he looked down upon the chateau\nof Porthos, situated on the shores of a small lake, and contiguous to a\nmagnificent forest. It was the same place we have already had the honor\nof describing to our readers; we shall therefore satisfy ourselves with\nnaming it. The first thing D'Artagnan perceived after the fine trees,\nthe May sun gilding the sides of the green hills, the long rows of\nfeather-topped trees which stretched out towards Compiegne, was a large\nrolling box, pushed forward by two servants and dragged by two others.\nIn this box there was an enormous green-and-gold thing, which went along\nthe smiling glades of the park, thus dragged and pushed. This thing,\nat a distance, could not be distinguished, and signified absolutely\nnothing; nearer, it was a hogshead muffled in gold-bound green cloth;\nwhen close, it was a man, or rather a _poussa_, the inferior extremity\nof whom, spreading over the interior of the box, entirely filled it;\nwhen still closer, the man was Mousqueton--Mousqueton, with gray hair\nand a face as red as Punchinello's.\n\n\"_Pardieu!_\" cried D'Artagnan; \"why, that's my dear Monsieur\nMousqueton!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried the fat man--\"ah! what happiness! what joy! There's M.\nd'Artagnan. Stop, you rascals!\" These last words were addressed to\nthe lackeys who pushed and dragged him. The box stopped, and the four\nlackeys, with a precision quite military, took off their laced hats and\nranged themselves behind it.\n\n\"Oh, Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" said Mousqueton, \"why can I not embrace your\nknees? But I have become impotent, as you see.\"\n\n\"_Dame!_ my dear Mousqueton, it is age.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, it is not age; it is infirmities--troubles.\"\n\n\"Troubles! you, Mousqueton?\" said D'Artagnan, making the tour of the\nbox; \"are you out of your mind, my dear friend? Thank God! you are as\nhearty as a three-hundred-year-old oak.\"\n\n\"Ah! but my legs, monsieur, my legs!\" groaned the faithful servant.\n\n\"What's the matter with your legs?\"\n\n\"Oh, they will no longer bear me!\"\n\n\"Ah, the ungrateful things! And yet you feed them well, Mousqueton,\napparently.\"\n\n\"Alas, yes! They can reproach me with nothing in that respect,\" said\nMousqueton, with a sigh; \"I have always done what I could for my poor\nbody; I am not selfish.\" And Mousqueton sighed afresh.\n\n\"I wonder whether Mousqueton wants to be a baron, too, as he sighs after\nthat fashion?\" thought D'Artagnan.\n\n\"_Mon Dieu_, monsieur!\" said Mousqueton, as if rousing himself from a\npainful reverie; \"how happy monseigneur will be that you have thought of\nhim!\"\n\n\"Kind Porthos!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"I am anxious to embrace him.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mousqueton, much affected, \"I shall certainly write to him.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"you will write to him?\"\n\n\"This very day; I shall not delay it an hour.\"\n\n\"Is he not here, then?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur.\"\n\n\"But is he near at hand?--is he far off?\"\n\n\"Oh, can I tell, monsieur, can I tell?\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" cried the musketeer, stamping with his foot, \"I am\nunfortunate. Porthos is such a stay-at-home!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, there is not a more sedentary man that monseigneur, but--\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"When a friend presses you--\"\n\n\"A friend?\"\n\n\"Doubtless--the worthy M. d'Herblay.\"\n\n\"What, has Aramis pressed Porthos?\"\n\n\"This is how the thing happened, Monsieur d'Artagnan. M. d'Herblay wrote\nto monseigneur--\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"A letter, monsieur, such a pressing letter that it threw us all into a\nbustle.\"\n\n\"Tell me all about it, my dear friend,\" said D'Artagnan; \"but remove\nthese people a little further off first.\"\n\nMousqueton shouted, \"Fall back, you fellows,\" with such powerful lungs\nthat the breath, without the words, would have been sufficient to\ndisperse the four lackeys. D'Artagnan seated himself on the shaft of\nthe box and opened his ears. \"Monsieur,\" said Mousqueton, \"monseigneur,\nthen, received a letter from M. le Vicaire-General d'Herblay, eight or\nnine days ago; it was the day of the rustic pleasures, yes, it must have\nbeen Wednesday.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said D'Artagnan. \"The day of rustic pleasures?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; we have so many pleasures to take in this delightful\ncountry, that we were encumbered by them; so much so, that we have been\nforced to regulate the distribution of them.\"\n\n\"How easily do I recognize Porthos's love of order in that! Now, that\nidea would never have occurred to me; but then I am not encumbered with\npleasures.\"\n\n\"We were, though,\" said Mousqueton.\n\n\"And how did you regulate the matter, let me know?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"It is rather long, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Never mind, we have plenty of time; and you speak so well, my dear\nMousqueton, that it is really a pleasure to hear you.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Mousqueton, with a sigh of satisfaction, which\nemanated evidently from the justice which had been rendered him, \"it is\ntrue I have made great progress in the company of monseigneur.\"\n\n\"I am waiting for the distribution of the pleasures, Mousqueton, and\nwith impatience. I want to know if I have arrived on a lucky day.\"\n\n\"Oh, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Mousqueton in a melancholy tone, \"since\nmonseigneur's departure all the pleasures have gone too!\"\n\n\"Well, my dear Mousqueton, refresh your memory.\"\n\n\"With what day shall I begin?\"\n\n\"Eh, _pardieux!_ begin with Sunday; that is the Lord's day.\"\n\n\"Sunday, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Sunday pleasures are religious: monseigneur goes to mass, makes the\nbread-offering, and has discourses and instructions made to him by his\nalmoner-in-ordinary. That is not very amusing, but we expect a Carmelite\nfrom Paris who will do the duty of our almonry, and who, we are assured,\nspeaks very well, which will keep us awake, whereas our present almoner\nalways sends us to sleep. These are Sunday religious pleasures. On\nMonday, worldly pleasures.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said D'Artagnan, \"what do you mean by that? Let us have a\nglimpse at your worldly pleasures.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, on Monday we go into the world; we pay and receive visits, we\nplay on the lute, we dance, we make verses, and burn a little incense in\nhonor of the ladies.\"\n\n\"_Peste!_ that is the height of gallantry,\" said the musketeer, who was\nobliged to call to his aid all the strength of his facial muscles to\nsuppress an enormous inclination to laugh.\n\n\"Tuesday, learned pleasures.\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"What are they? Detail them, my dear\nMousqueton.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur has bought a sphere or globe, which I shall show you; it\nfills all the perimeter of the great tower, except a gallery which he\nhas had built over the sphere: there are little strings and brass wires\nto which the sun and moon are hooked. It all turns; and that is very\nbeautiful. Monseigneur points out to me the seas and distant countries.\nWe don't intend to visit them, but it is very interesting.\"\n\n\"Interesting! yes, that's the word,\" repeated D'Artagnan. \"And\nWednesday?\"\n\n\"Rustic pleasures, as I have had the honor to tell you, monsieur le\nchevalier. We look over monseigneur's sheep and goats; we make the\nshepherds dance to pipes and reeds, as is written in a book monseigneur\nhas in his library, which is called 'Bergeries.' The author died about a\nmonth ago.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Racan, perhaps,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, that was his name--M. Racan. But that is not all: we angle in\nthe little canal, after which we dine, crowned with flowers. That is\nWednesday.\"\n\n\n\"_Peste!_\" said D'Artagnan; \"you don't divide your pleasures badly. And\nThursday?--what can be left for poor Thursday?\"\n\n\"It is not very unfortunate, monsieur,\" said Mousqueton, smiling.\n\"Thursday, Olympian pleasures. Ah, monsieur, that is superb! We get\ntogether all monseigneur's young vassals, and we make them throw the\ndisc, wrestle, and run races. Monseigneur can't run now, no more can I;\nbut monseigneur throws the disc as nobody else can throw it. And when he\ndoes deal a blow, oh, that proves a misfortune!\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, we were obliged to renounce the cestus. He cracked\nheads; he broke jaws--beat in ribs. It was charming sport; but nobody\nwas willing to play with him.\"\n\n\"Then his wrist--\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, firmer than ever. Monseigneur gets a trifle weaker in his\nlegs,--he confesses that himself; but his strength has all taken refuge\nin his arms, so that--\"\n\n\"So that he can knock down bullocks, as he used to formerly.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, better than that--he beats in walls. Lately, after\nhaving supped with one of our farmers--you know how popular and kind\nmonseigneur is--after supper, as a joke, he struck the wall a blow. The\nwall crumbled away beneath his hand, the roof fell in, and three men and\nan old woman were stifled.\"\n\n\"Good God, Mousqueton! And your master?\"\n\n\"Oh, monseigneur, a little skin was rubbed off his head. We bathed the\nwounds with some water which the monks gave us. But there was nothing\nthe matter with his hand.\"\n\n\"Nothing?\"\n\n\"No, nothing, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Deuce take the Olympic pleasures! They must cost your master too dear;\nfor widows and orphans--\"\n\n\"They all had pensions, monsieur; a tenth of monseigneur's revenue was\nspent in that way.\"\n\n\"Then pass on to Friday,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Friday, noble and warlike pleasures. We hunt, we fence, we dress\nfalcons and break horses. Then, Saturday is the day for intellectual\npleasures: we adorn our minds; we look at monseigneur's pictures and\nstatues; we write, even, and trace plans: and then we fire monseigneur's\ncannon.\"\n\n\"You draw plans, and fire cannon?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Why, my friend,\" said D'Artagnan, \"M. du Vallon, in truth, possesses\nthe most subtle and amiable mind that I know. But there is one kind of\npleasure you have forgotten, it appears to me.\"\n\n\"What is that, monsieur?\" asked Mousqueton, with anxiety.\n\n\"The material pleasures.\"\n\nMousqueton colored. \"What do you mean by that, monsieur?\" said he,\ncasting down his eyes.\n\n\"I mean the table--good wine--evenings occupied in passing the bottle.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur, we don't reckon those pleasures,--we practice them every\nday.\"\n\n\"My brave Mousqueton,\" resumed D'Artagnan, \"pardon me, but I was so\nabsorbed in your charming recital that I have forgotten the\nprincipal object of our conversation, which was to learn what M. le\nVicaire-General d'Herblay could have to write to your master about.\"\n\n\"That is true, monsieur,\" said Mousqueton; \"the pleasures have misled\nus. Well, monsieur, this is the whole affair.\"\n\n\"I am all attention, Mousqueton.\"\n\n\"On Wednesday--\"\n\n\"The day of the rustic pleasures?\"\n\n\"Yes--a letter arrived; he received it from my hands. I had recognized\nthe writing.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nMonseigneur read it and cried out, \"Quick, my horses! my arms!'\"\n\n\"Oh, good Lord! then it was for some duel?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"No, monsieur, there were only these words: 'Dear Porthos, set out, if\nyou would wish to arrive before the Equinox. I expect you.'\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" said D'Artagnan, thoughtfully, \"that was pressing,\napparently.\"\n\n\"I think so; therefore,\" continued Mousqueton, \"monseigneur set out\nthe very same day with his secretary, in order to endeavor to arrive in\ntime.\"\n\n\"And did he arrive in time?\"\n\n\"I hope so. Monseigneur, who is hasty, as you know, monsieur, repeated\nincessantly, '_Tonne Dieu!_ What can this mean? The Equinox? Never mind,\na fellow must be well mounted to arrive before I do.'\"\n\n\"And you think Porthos will have arrived first, do you?\" asked\nD'Artagnan.\n\n\"I am sure of it. This Equinox, however rich he may be, has certainly no\nhorses so good as monseigneur's.\"\n\nD'Artagnan repressed his inclination to laugh, because the brevity of\nAramis's letter gave rise to reflection. He followed Mousqueton, or\nrather Mousqueton's chariot, to the castle. He sat down to a sumptuous\ntable, of which they did him the honors as to a king. But he could draw\nnothing from Mousqueton,--the faithful servant seemed to shed tears at\nwill, but that was all.\n\nD'Artagnan, after a night passed in an excellent bed, reflected much\nupon the meaning of Aramis's letter; puzzled himself as to the relation\nof the Equinox with the affairs of Porthos; and being unable to make\nanything out unless it concerned some amour of the bishop's, for which\nit was necessary that the days and nights should be equal, D'Artagnan\nleft Pierrefonds as he had left Melun, as he had left the chateau of the\nComte de la Fere. It was not, however, without a melancholy, which might\nin good sooth pass for one of the most dismal of D'Artagnan's moods.\nHis head cast down, his eyes fixed, he suffered his legs to hang on each\nside of his horse, and said to himself, in that vague sort of reverie\nwhich ascends sometimes to the sublimest eloquence:\n\n\"No more friends! no more future! no more anything! My energies are\nbroken like the bonds of our ancient friendship. Oh, old age is coming,\ncold and inexorable; it envelopes in its funeral crepe all that was\nbrilliant, all that was embalming in my youth; then it throws that sweet\nburthen on its shoulders and carries it away with the rest into the\nfathomless gulf of death.\"\n\nA shudder crept through the heart of the Gascon, so brave and so strong\nagainst all the misfortunes of life; and during some moments the clouds\nappeared black to him, the earth slippery and full of pits as that of\ncemeteries.\n\n\"Whither am I going?\" said he to himself. \"What am I going to do! Alone,\nquite alone--without family, without friends! Bah!\" cried he all at\nonce. And he clapped spurs to his horse, who, having found nothing\nmelancholy in the heavy oats of Pierrefonds, profited by this permission\nto show his gayety in a gallop which absorbed two leagues. \"To Paris!\"\nsaid D'Artagnan to himself. And on the morrow he alighted in Paris. He\nhad devoted ten days to this journey.\n\n\n\nChapter XIX. What D'Artagnan went to Paris for.\n\nThe lieutenant dismounted before a shop in the Rue des Lombards, at the\nsign of the Pilon d'Or. A man of good appearance, wearing a white apron,\nand stroking his gray mustache with a large hand, uttered a cry of joy\non perceiving the pied horse. \"Monsieur le chevalier,\" said he, \"ah, is\nthat you?\"\n\n\"_Bon jour_, Planchet,\" replied D'Artagnan, stooping to enter the shop.\n\n\"Quick, somebody,\" cried Planchet, \"to look after Monsieur d'Artagnan's\nhorse,--somebody to get ready his room,--somebody to prepare his\nsupper.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Planchet. Good-day, my children!\" said D'Artagnan to the eager\nboys.\n\n\"Allow me to send off this coffee, this treacle, and these\nraisins,\" said Planchet; \"they are for the store-room of monsieur le\nsurintendant.\"\n\n\"Send them off, send them off!\"\n\n\"That is only the affair of a moment, then we shall sup.\"\n\n\"Arrange it that we may sup alone; I want to speak to you.\"\n\nPlanchet looked at his old master in a significant manner.\n\n\"Oh, don't be uneasy, it is nothing unpleasant,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"So much the better--so much the better!\" And Planchet breathed freely\nagain, whilst D'Artagnan seated himself quietly down in the shop, upon\na bale of corks, and made a survey of the premises. The shop was well\nstocked; there was a mingled perfume of ginger, cinnamon, and ground\npepper, which made D'Artagnan sneeze. The shop-boy, proud of being in\ncompany with so renowned a warrior, of a lieutenant of musketeers, who\napproached the person of the king, began to work with an enthusiasm\nwhich was something like delirium, and to serve the customers with a\ndisdainful haste that was noticed by several.\n\nPlanchet put away his money, and made up his accounts, amidst civilities\naddressed to his former master. Planchet had with his equals the\nshort speech and haughty familiarity of the rich shopkeeper who serves\neverybody and waits for nobody. D'Artagnan observed this habit with\na pleasure which we shall analyze presently. He saw night come on by\ndegrees, and at length Planchet conducted him to a chamber on the first\nstory, where, amidst bales and chests, a table very nicely set out\nawaited the two guests.\n\nD'Artagnan took advantage of a moment's pause to examine the countenance\nof Planchet, whom he had not seen for a year. The shrewd Planchet had\nacquired a slight protuberance in front, but his countenance was not\npuffed. His keen eye still played with facility in its deep-sunk orbit;\nand fat, which levels all the characteristic saliences of the human\nface, had not yet touched either his high cheek-bones, the sign of\ncunning and cupidity, or his pointed chin, the sign of acuteness and\nperseverance. Planchet reigned with as much majesty in his dining-room\nas in his shop. He set before his master a frugal, but perfectly\nParisian repast: roast meat, cooked at the baker's, with vegetables,\nsalad, and a dessert borrowed from the shop itself. D'Artagnan was\npleased that the grocer had drawn from behind the fagots a bottle of\nthat Anjou wine which during all his life had been D'Artagnan's favorite\nwine.\n\n\"Formerly, monsieur,\" said Planchet, with a smile full of _bonhomie_,\n\"it was I who drank your wine; now you do me the honor to drink mine.\"\n\n\"And, thank God, friend Planchet, I shall drink it for a long time to\ncome, I hope; for at present I am free.\"\n\n\"Free? You have a leave of absence, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Unlimited.\"\n\n\"You are leaving the service?\" said Planchet, stupefied.\n\n\"Yes, I am resting.\"\n\n\"And the king?\" cried Planchet, who could not suppose it possible that\nthe king could do without the services of such a man as D'Artagnan.\n\n\"The king will try his fortune elsewhere. But we have supped well, you\nare disposed to enjoy yourself; you invite me to confide in you. Open\nyour ears, then.\"\n\n\"They are open.\" And Planchet, with a laugh more frank than cunning,\nopened a bottle of white wine.\n\n\"Leave me my reason, at least.\"\n\n\"Oh, as to you losing your head--you, monsieur!\"\n\n\"Now my head is my own, and I mean to take better care of it than ever.\nIn the first place we shall talk business. How fares our money-box?\"\n\n\"Wonderfully well, monsieur. The twenty thousand livres I had of you are\nstill employed in my trade, in which they bring me nine per cent. I give\nyou seven, so I gain two by you.\"\n\n\"And you are still satisfied?\"\n\n\"Delighted. Have you brought me any more?\"\n\n\"Better than that. But do you want any?\"\n\n\"Oh! not at all. Every one is willing to trust me now. I am extending my\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"That was your intention.\"\n\n\"I play the banker a little. I buy goods of my needy brethren; I lend\nmoney to those who are not ready for their payments.\"\n\n\"Without usury?\"\n\n\"Oh! monsieur, in the course of the last week I have had two meetings on\nthe boulevards, on account of the word you have just pronounced.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You shall see: it concerned a loan. The borrower gives me in pledge\nsome raw sugars, on condition that I should sell if repayment were not\nmade within a fixed period. I lend a thousand livres. He does not pay\nme, and I sell the sugars for thirteen hundred livres. He learns this\nand claims a hundred crowns. _Ma foi!_ I refused, pretending that I\ncould not sell them for more than nine hundred livres. He accused me of\nusury. I begged him to repeat that word to me behind the boulevards. He\nwas an old guard, and he came: and I passed your sword through his left\nthigh.\"\n\n\"_Tu dieu!_ what a pretty sort of banker you make!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"For above thirteen per cent I fight,\" replied Planchet; \"that is my\ncharacter.\"\n\n\"Take only twelve,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and call the rest premium and\nbrokerage.\"\n\n\"You are right, monsieur; but to your business.\"\n\n\"Ah! Planchet, it is very long and very hard to speak.\"\n\n\"Do speak it, nevertheless.\"\n\nD'Artagnan twisted his mustache like a man embarrassed with the\nconfidence he is about to make and mistrustful of his confidant.\n\n\"Is it an investment?\" asked Planchet.\n\n\"Why, yes.\"\n\n\"At good profit?\"\n\n\"A capital profit,--four hundred per cent, Planchet.\"\n\nPlanchet gave such a blow with his fist upon the table, that the bottles\nbounded as if they had been frightened.\n\n\"Good heavens! is that possible?\"\n\n\"I think it will be more,\" replied D'Artagnan coolly; \"but I like to lay\nit at the lowest!\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said Planchet, drawing nearer. \"Why, monsieur, that is\nmagnificent! Can one put much money in it?\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand livres each, Planchet.\"\n\n\"Why, that is all you have, monsieur. For how long a time?\"\n\n\"For a month.\"\n\n\"And that will give us--\"\n\n\"Fifty thousand livres each, profit.\"\n\n\"It is monstrous! It is worth while to fight for such interest as that!\"\n\n\"In fact, I believe it will be necessary to fight not a little,\" said\nD'Artagnan, with the same tranquillity; \"but this time there are two of\nus, Planchet, and I shall take all the blows to myself.\"\n\n\"Oh! monsieur, I will not allow that.\"\n\n\"Planchet, you cannot be concerned in it; you would be obliged to leave\nyour business and your family.\"\n\n\"The affair is not in Paris, then.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Abroad?\"\n\n\"In England.\"\n\n\"A speculative country, that is true,\" said Planchet,--\"a country that\nI know well. What sort of an affair, monsieur, without too much\ncuriosity?\"\n\n\"Planchet, it is a restoration.\"\n\n\"Of monuments?\"\n\n\"Yes, of monuments; we shall restore Whitehall.\"\n\n\"That is important. And in a month, you think?\"\n\n\"I shall undertake it.\"\n\n\"That concerns you, monsieur, and when once you are engaged--\"\n\n\"Yes, that concerns me. I know what I am about; nevertheless, I will\nfreely consult with you.\"\n\n\"You do me great honor; but I know very little about architecture.\"\n\n\"Planchet, you are wrong; you are an excellent architect, quite as good\nas I am, for the case in question.\"\n\n\"Thanks, monsieur. But your old friends of the musketeers?\"\n\n\"I have been, I confess, tempted to speak of the thing to those\ngentlemen, but they are all absent from their houses. It is vexatious,\nfor I know none more bold or able.\"\n\n\"Ah! then it appears there will be an opposition, and the enterprise\nwill be disputed?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Planchet, yes.\"\n\n\"I burn to know the details, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Here they are, Planchet--close all the doors tight.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\" And Planchet double-locked them.\n\n\"That is well; now draw near.\" Planchet obeyed.\n\n\"And open the window, because the noise of the passers-by and the\ncarts will deafen all who might hear us.\" Planchet opened the window\nas desired, and the gust of tumult which filled the chamber with cries,\nwheels, barkings, and steps deafened D'Artagnan himself, as he had\nwished. He then swallowed a glass of white wine, and began in these\nterms: \"Planchet, I have an idea.\"\n\n\"Ah! monsieur, I recognize you so well in that!\" replied Planchet,\npanting with emotion.\n\n\n\nChapter XX. Of the Society which was formed in the Rue des Lombards, at\nthe Sign of the Pilon d'Or, to carry out M. d'Artagnan's Idea.\n\nAfter a moment's silence, in which D'Artagnan appeared to be collecting,\nnot one idea but all his ideas,--\"It cannot be, my dear Planchet,\" said\nhe, \"that you have not heard of his majesty Charles I. of England?\"\n\n\"Alas! yes, monsieur, since you left France in order to assist him, and\nthat, in spite of that assistance, he fell, and was near dragging you\ndown in his fall.\"\n\n\"Exactly so; I see you have a good memory, Planchet.\"\n\n\"_Peste!_ the astonishing thing would be, if I could have lost that\nmemory, however bad it might have been. When one has heard Grimaud, who,\nyou know, is not given to talking, relate how the head of King Charles\nfell, how you sailed the half of a night in a scuttled vessel, and saw\nfloating on the water that good M. Mordaunt with a certain gold-hafted\ndagger buried in his breast, one is not very likely to forget such\nthings.\"\n\n\"And yet there are people who forget them, Planchet.\"\n\n\"Yes, such as have not seen them, or have not heard Grimaud relate\nthem.\"\n\n\"Well, it is all the better that you recollect all that; I shall only\nhave to remind you of one thing, and that is that Charles I. had a son.\"\n\n\"Without contradicting you, monsieur, he had two,\" said Planchet; \"for\nI saw the second one in Paris, M. le Duke of York, one day, as he was\ngoing to the Palais Royal, and I was told that he was not the eldest son\nof Charles I. As to the eldest, I have the honor of knowing him by name,\nbut not personally.\"\n\n\"That is exactly the point, Planchet, we must come to: it is to this\neldest son, formerly called the Prince of Wales, and who is now styled\nCharles II., king of England.\"\n\n\"A king without a kingdom, monsieur,\" replied Planchet, sententiously.\n\n\"Yes, Planchet, and you may add an unfortunate prince, more unfortunate\nthan the poorest man of the people lost in the worst quarter of Paris.\"\n\nPlanchet made a gesture full of that sort of compassion which we grant\nto strangers with whom we think we can never possibly find ourselves in\ncontact. Besides, he did not see in this politico-sentimental operation\nany sign of the commercial idea of M. d'Artagnan, and it was in this\nidea that D'Artagnan, who was, from habit, pretty well acquainted with\nmen and things, had principally interested Planchet.\n\n\"I am come to our business. This young Prince of Wales, a king without\na kingdom, as you have so well said, Planchet, has interested me. I,\nD'Artagnan, have seen him begging assistance of Mazarin, who is a miser,\nand the aid of Louis, who is a child, and it appeared to me, who am\nacquainted with such things, that in the intelligent eye of the fallen\nking, in the nobility of his whole person, a nobility apparent above\nall his miseries, I could discern the stuff of a man and the heart of a\nking.\"\n\nPlanchet tacitly approved of all this; but it did not at all, in his\neyes at least, throw any light upon D'Artagnan's idea. The latter\ncontinued: \"This, then, is the reasoning which I made with myself.\nListen attentively, Planchet, for we are coming to the conclusion.\"\n\n\"I am listening.\"\n\n\"Kings are not so thickly sown upon the earth, that people can find\nthem whenever they want them. Now, this king without a kingdom is, in\nmy opinion, a grain of seed which will blossom in some season or other,\nprovided a skillful, discreet, and vigorous hand sow it duly and truly,\nselecting soil, sky, and time.\"\n\nPlanchet still approved by a nod of his head, which showed that he did\nnot perfectly comprehend all that was said.\n\n\"'Poor little seed of a king,' said I to myself, and really I was\naffected, Planchet, which leads me to think I am entering upon a foolish\nbusiness. And that is why I wished to consult you, my friend.\"\n\nPlanchet colored with pleasure and pride.\n\n\"'Poor little seed of a king! I will pick you up and cast you into good\nground.'\"\n\n\"Good God!\" said Planchet, looking earnestly at his old master, as if in\ndoubt as to the state of his reason.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" said D'Artagnan; \"who hurts you?\"\n\n\"Me! nothing, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You said, 'Good God!'\"\n\n\"Did I?\"\n\n\"I am sure you did. Can you already understand?\"\n\n\"I confess, M. d'Artagnan, that I am afraid--\"\n\n\"To understand?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"To understand that I wish to replace upon his throne this King Charles\nII., who has no throne? Is that it?\"\n\nPlanchet made a prodigious bound in his chair. \"Ah, ah!\" said he, in\nevident terror, \"that is what you call a restoration!\"\n\n\"Yes, Planchet; is it not the proper term for it?\"\n\n\"Oh, no doubt, no doubt! But have you reflected seriously?\"\n\n\"Upon what?\"\n\n\"Upon what is going on yonder.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In England.\"\n\n\"And what is that? Let us see, Planchet.\"\n\n\"In the first place, monsieur, I ask you pardon for meddling in these\nthings, which have nothing to do with my trade; but since it is an\naffair that you propose to me--for you are proposing an affair, are you\nnot?--\"\n\n\"A superb one, Planchet.\"\n\n\"But as it is business you propose to me, I have the right to discuss\nit.\"\n\n\"Discuss it, Planchet; out of discussion is born light.\"\n\n\"Well, then, since I have monsieur's permission, I will tell him that\nthere is yonder, in the first place, the parliament.\"\n\n\"Well, next?\"\n\n\"And then the army.\"\n\n\"Good! Do you see anything else?\"\n\n\"Why, then the nation.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"The nation which consented to the overthrow and death of the late\nking, the father of this one, and which will not be willing to belie its\nacts.\"\n\n\"Planchet,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you argue like a cheese! The nation--the\nnation is tired of these gentlemen who give themselves such barbarous\nnames, and who sing songs to it. Chanting for chanting, my dear\nPlanchet; I have remarked that nations prefer singing a merry chant to\nthe plain chant. Remember the Fronde; what did they sing in those times?\nWell, those were good times.\"\n\n\"Not too good, not too good! I was near being hung in those times.\"\n\n\"Well, but you were not.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And you laid the foundations of your fortune in the midst of all those\nsongs?\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"Then you have nothing to say against them.\"\n\n\"Well, I return, then, to the army and parliament.\"\n\n\"I say that I borrow twenty thousand livres of M. Planchet, and that\nI put twenty thousand livres of my own to it; and with these forty\nthousand livres I raise an army.\"\n\nPlanchet clasped his hands; he saw that D'Artagnan was in earnest, and,\nin good truth, he believed his master had lost his senses.\n\n\"An army!--ah, monsieur,\" said he, with his most agreeable smile,\nfor fear of irritating the madman, and rendering him furious,--\"an\narmy!--how many?\"\n\n\"Of forty men,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Forty against forty thousand! that is not enough. I know very well that\nyou, M. d'Artagnan, alone, are equal to a thousand men; but where are\nwe to find thirty-nine men equal to you? Or, if we could find them, who\nwould furnish you with money to pay them?\"\n\n\"Not bad, Planchet. Ah, the devil! you play the courtier.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, I speak what I think, and that is exactly why I say that,\nin the first pitched battle you fight with your forty men, I am very\nmuch afraid--\"\n\n\"Therefore I shall fight no pitched battles, my dear Planchet,\" said the\nGascon, laughing. \"We have very fine examples in antiquity of skillful\nretreats and marches, which consisted in avoiding the enemy instead of\nattacking them. You should know that, Planchet, you who commanded\nthe Parisians the day on which they ought to have fought against the\nmusketeers, and who so well calculated marches and countermarches, that\nyou never left the Palais Royal.\"\n\nPlanchet could not help laughing. \"It is plain,\" replied he, \"that if\nyour forty men conceal themselves, and are not unskillful, they may hope\nnot to be beaten: but you propose obtaining some result, do you not?\"\n\n\"No doubt. This, then, in my opinion, is the plan to be proceeded upon\nin order quickly to replace his majesty Charles II. on his throne.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Planchet, increasing his attention; \"let us see your plan.\nBut in the first place it seems to me we are forgetting something.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"We have set aside the nation, which prefers singing merry songs to\npsalms, and the army, which we will not fight; but the parliament\nremains, and that seldom sings.\"\n\n\"Nor does it fight. How is it, Planchet, that an intelligent man like\nyourself should take any heed of a set of brawlers who call themselves\nRumps and Barebones? The parliament does not trouble me at all,\nPlanchet.\"\n\n\"As soon as it ceases to trouble you, monsieur, let us pass on.\"\n\n\"Yes, and arrive at the result. You remember Cromwell, Planchet?\"\n\n\"I have heard a great deal of talk about him.\n\n\"He was a rough soldier.\"\n\n\"And a terrible eater, moreover.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Why, at one gulp he swallowed all England.\"\n\n\"Well, Planchet, the evening before the day on which he swallowed\nEngland, if any one had swallowed M. Cromwell?\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, it is one of the axioms of mathematics that the container\nmust be greater than the contained.\"\n\n\"Very well! That is our affair, Planchet.\"\n\n\"But M. Cromwell is dead, and his container is now the tomb.\"\n\n\"My dear Planchet, I see with pleasure that you have not only become a\nmathematician, but a philosopher.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, in my grocery business I use much printed paper, and that\ninstructs me.\"\n\n\"Bravo! You know then, in that case--for you have not learnt mathematics\nand philosophy without a little history--that after this Cromwell so\ngreat, there came one who was very little.\"\n\n\"Yes; he was named Richard, and he as done as you have, M.\nd'Artagnan--he has tendered his resignation.\"\n\n\"Very well said--very well! After the great man who is dead, after the\nlittle one who tendered his resignation, there came a third. This one\nis named Monk; he is an able general, considering he has never fought a\nbattle; he is a skillful diplomatist, considering that he never speaks\nin public, and that having to say 'good-day' to a man, he meditates\ntwelve hours, and ends by saying 'good night;' which makes people\nexclaim '_miracle!_' seeing that it falls out correctly.\"\n\n\"That is rather strong,\" said Planchet; \"but I know another political\nman who resembles him very much.\"\n\n\"M. Mazarin you mean?\"\n\n\"Himself.\"\n\n\"You are right, Planchet; only M. Mazarin does not aspire to the throne\nof France; and that changes everything. Do you see? Well, this M. Monk,\nwho has England ready-roasted in his plate, and who is already opening\nhis mouth to swallow it--this M. Monk, who says to the people of Charles\nII., and to Charles II. himself, '_Nescio vos_'--\"\n\n\"I don't understand English,\" said Planchet.\n\n\"Yes, but I understand it,\" said D'Artagnan. \"'_Nescio vos_' means 'I do\nnot know you.' This M. Monk, the most important man in England, when he\nshall have swallowed it--\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked Planchet.\n\n\"Well, my friend, I shall go over yonder, and with my forty men I shall\ncarry him off, pack him up, and bring him into France, where two modes\nof proceeding present themselves to my dazzled eyes.\"\n\n\"Oh! and to mine too,\" cried Planchet, transported with enthusiasm. \"We\nwill put him in a cage and show him for money.\"\n\n\"Well, Planchet, that is a third plan, of which I had not thought.\"\n\n\"Do you think it a good one?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly, but I think mine better.\"\n\n\"Let us see yours, then.\"\n\n\"In the first place, I shall set a ransom on him.\"\n\n\"Of how much?\"\n\n\"_Peste!_ a fellow like that must be well worth a hundred thousand\ncrowns.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\"\n\n\"You see, then--in the first place, a ransom of a hundred thousand\ncrowns.\"\n\n\"Or else--\"\n\n\"Or else, what is much better, I deliver him up to King Charles, who,\nhaving no longer either a general or an army to fear, nor a diplomatist\nto trick him, will restore himself, and when once restored, will pay\ndown to me the hundred thousand crowns in question. That is the idea I\nhave formed; what do you say to it, Planchet?\"\n\n\"Magnificent, monsieur!\" cried Planchet, trembling with emotion. \"How\ndid you conceive that idea?\"\n\n\"It came to me one morning on the banks of the Loire, whilst our beloved\nking, Louis XIV., was pretending to weep upon the hand of Mademoiselle\nde Mancini.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I declare the idea is sublime. But--\"\n\n\"Ah! is there a _but?_\"\n\n\"Permit me! But this is a little like the skin of that fine bear--you\nknow--that they were about to sell, but which it was necessary to take\nfrom the back of the living bear. Now, to take M. Monk, there will be a\nbit of a scuffle, I should think.\"\n\n\"No doubt; but as I shall raise an army to--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes--I understand, _parbleu!_--a _coup-de-main_. Yes, then,\nmonsieur, you will triumph, for no one equals you in such sorts of\nencounters.\"\n\n\"I certainly am lucky in them,\" said D'Artagnan, with a proud\nsimplicity. \"You know that if for this affair I had my dear Athos, my\nbrave Porthos, and my cunning Aramis, the business would be settled; but\nthey are all lost, as it appears, and nobody knows where to find them.\nI will do it, then, alone. Now, do you find the business good, and the\ninvestment advantageous?\"\n\n\"Too much so--too much so.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\"\n\n\"Because fine things never reach the expected point.\"\n\n\"This is infallible, Planchet, and the proof is that I undertake it. It\nwill be for you a tolerably pretty gain, and for me a very interesting\nstroke. It will be said, 'Such was the old age of M. d'Artagnan,' and I\nshall hold a place in tales and even in history itself, Planchet. I am\ngreedy of honor.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" cried Planchet, \"when I think that it is here, in my home,\nin the midst of my sugar, my prunes, and my cinnamon, that this gigantic\nproject is ripened, my shop seems a palace to me.\"\n\n\"Beware, beware, Planchet! If the least report of this escapes, there is\nthe Bastile for both of us. Beware, my friend, for this is a plot we are\nhatching. M. Monk is the ally of M. Mazarin--beware!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, when a man has had the honor to belong to you, he knows\nnothing of fear; and when he has had the advantage of being bound up in\ninterests with you, he holds his tongue.\"\n\n\"Very well; that is more your affair than mine, seeing that in a week I\nshall be in England.\"\n\n\"Depart, monsieur, depart--the sooner the better.\"\n\n\"Is the money, then, ready?\"\n\n\"It will be to-morrow; to-morrow you shall receive it from my own hands.\nWill you have gold or silver?\"\n\n\"Gold; that is most convenient. But how are we going to arrange this?\nLet us see.\"\n\n\"Oh, good Lord! in the simplest way possible. You shall give me a\nreceipt, that is all.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said D'Artagnan, warmly; \"we must preserve order in all\nthings.\"\n\n\"That is likewise my opinion; but with you, M. d'Artagnan--\"\n\n\"And if I should die yonder--if I should be killed by a musket-ball--if\nI should burst from drinking beer?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I beg you to believe that in that case I should be so much\nafflicted at your death, that I should not think about the money.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Planchet; but no matter. We shall, like two lawyers' clerks,\ndraw up together an agreement, a sort of act, which may be called a deed\nof company.\"\n\n\"Willingly, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I know it is difficult to draw such a thing up, but we can try.\"\n\n\"Let us try, then.\" And Planchet went in search of pens, ink, and\npaper. D'Artagnan took the pen and wrote:--\"Between Messire d'Artagnan,\nex-lieutenant of the king's musketeers, at present residing in the\nRue Tiquetonne, Hotel de la Chevrette; and the Sieur Planchet, grocer,\nresiding in the Rue des Lombards, at the sign of the Pilon d'Or, it has\nbeen agreed as follows:--A company, with a capital of forty thousand\nlivres, and formed for the purpose of carrying out an idea conceived by\nM. d'Artagnan, and the said Planchet approving of it in all points,\nwill place twenty thousand livres in the hands of M. d'Artagnan. He\nwill require neither repayment nor interest before the return of M.\nd'Artagnan from a journey he is about to take into England. On his part,\nM. d'Artagnan undertakes it to find twenty thousand livres, which\nhe will join to the twenty thousand already laid down by the Sieur\nPlanchet. He will employ the said sum of forty thousand livres according\nto his judgment in an undertaking which is described below. On the day\nwhen M. d'Artagnan shall have re-established, by whatever means, his\nmajesty King Charles II. upon the throne of England, he will pay into\nthe hands of M. Planchet the sum of--\"\n\n\"The sum of a hundred and fifty thousand livres,\" said Planchet,\ninnocently, perceiving that D'Artagnan hesitated.\n\n\"Oh, the devil, no!\" said D'Artagnan, \"the division cannot be made by\nhalf; that would not be just.\"\n\n\"And yet, monsieur, we each lay down half,\" objected Planchet, timidly.\n\n\"Yes; but listen to this clause, my dear Planchet, and if you do not\nfind if equitable in every respect when it is written, well, we can\nscratch it out again:--'Nevertheless, as M. d'Artagnan brings to the\nassociation, besides his capital of twenty thousand livres, his time,\nhis idea, his industry, and his skin,--things which he appreciates\nstrongly, particularly the last,--M. d'Artagnan will keep, of the three\nhundred thousand livres, two hundred thousand livres for himself, which\nwill make his share two-thirds.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Planchet.\n\n\"Is it just?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Perfectly just, monsieur.\"\n\n\"And you will be contented with a hundred thousand livres?\"\n\n\"_Peste!_ I think so. A hundred thousand for twenty thousand!\"\n\n\"And in a month, understand.\"\n\n\"How, in a month?\"\n\n\"Yes, I only ask one month.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Planchet, generously, \"I give you six weeks.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" replied the musketeer, politely; after which the two\npartners reperused their deed.\n\n\"That is perfect, monsieur,\" said Planchet; \"and the late M. Coquenard,\nthe first husband of Madame la Baronne du Vallon, could not have done it\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Do you find it so? Let us sign it then.\" And both affixed their\nsignatures.\n\n\"In this fashion,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I shall be under obligations to no\none.\"\n\n\"But I shall be under obligations to you,\" said Planchet.\n\n\"No; for whatever store I set by it, Planchet, I may lose my skin\nyonder, and you will lose all. _A propos--peste!_--that makes me think\nof the principal, an indispensable clause. I shall write it:--'In\ncase of M. d'Artagnan dying in this enterprise, liquidation will be\nconsidered made, and the Sieur Planchet will give quittance from that\nmoment to the shade of Messire d'Artagnan for the twenty thousand livres\npaid by him into the hands of the said company.'\"\n\nThis last clause made Planchet knit his brows a little, but when he saw\nthe brilliant eye, the muscular hand, the supple and strong back of\nhis associate, he regained his courage, and, without regret, he at once\nadded another stroke to his signature. D'Artagnan did the same. Thus was\ndrawn the first known company contract; perhaps such things have been\nabused a little since, both in form and principle.\n\n\"Now,\" said Planchet, pouring out the last glass of Anjou wine for\nD'Artagnan,--\"now go to sleep, my dear master.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"for the most difficult part now remains to be\ndone, and I will think over that difficult part.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Planchet; \"I have such great confidence in you, M.\nd'Artagnan, that I would not give my hundred thousand livres for ninety\nthousand livres down.\"\n\n\"And devil take me if I don't think you are right!\" Upon which\nD'Artagnan took a candle and went up to his bedroom.\n\n\n\nChapter XXI. In which D'Artagnan prepares to travel for the Firm of\nPlanchet & Company.\n\nD'Artagnan reflected to such good purpose during the night that his\nplan was settled by morning. \"This is it,\" said he, sitting up in bed,\nsupporting his elbow on his knee, and his chin in his hand;--\"this is\nit. I shall seek out forty steady, firm men, recruited among people a\nlittle compromised, but having habits of discipline. I shall promise\nthem five hundred livres for a month if they return; nothing if they\ndo not return, or half for their kindred. As to food and lodging, that\nconcerns the English, who have cattle in their pastures, bacon in their\nbacon-racks, fowls in their poultry-yards, and corn in their barns. I\nwill present myself to General Monk with my little body of troops. He\nwill receive me. I shall win his confidence, and take advantage of it,\nas soon as possible.\"\n\nBut without going further, D'Artagnan shook his head and interrupted\nhimself. \"No,\" said he; \"I should not dare to relate this to Athos;\nthe way is therefore not honorable. I must use violence,\" continued\nhe,--\"very certainly I must, but without compromising my loyalty. With\nforty men I will traverse the country as a partisan. But if I fall\nin with, not forty thousand English, as Planchet said, but purely and\nsimply with four hundred, I shall be beaten. Supposing that among my\nforty warriors there should be found at least ten stupid ones--ten who\nwill allow themselves to be killed one after the other, from mere\nfolly? No; it is, in fact, impossible to find forty men to be depended\nupon--they do not exist. I must learn how to be contented with thirty.\nWith ten men less I should have the right of avoiding any armed\nencounter, on account of the small number of my people; and if the\nencounter should take place, my chance is better with thirty men than\nforty. Besides, I should save five thousand francs; that is to say, the\neighth of my capital; that is worth the trial. This being so, I should\nhave thirty men. I shall divide them into three bands,--we will spread\nourselves about over the country, with an injunction to reunite at\na given moment; in this fashion, ten by ten, we should excite no\nsuspicion--we should pass unperceived. Yes, yes, thirty--that is a\nmagic number. There are three tens--three, that divine number! And then,\ntruly, a company of thirty men, when all together, will look rather\nimposing. Ah! stupid wretch that I am!\" continued D'Artagnan, \"I want\nthirty horses. That is ruinous. Where the devil was my head when I\nforgot the horses? We cannot, however, think of striking such a blow\nwithout horses. Well, so be it, that sacrifice must be made; we can\nget the horses in the country--they are not bad, besides. But I\nforgot--_peste!_ Three bands--that necessitates three leaders; there\nis the difficulty. Of the three commanders I have already one--that is\nmyself;--yes, but the two others will of themselves cost almost as much\nmoney as all the rest of the troop. No; positively I must have but one\nlieutenant. In that case, then, I should reduce my troop to twenty men.\nI know very well that twenty men is but very little; but since with\nthirty I was determined not to seek to come to blows, I should do so\nmore carefully still with twenty. Twenty--that is a round number;\nthat, besides, reduces the number of the horses by ten, which is a\nconsideration; and then, with a good lieutenant--_Mordioux!_ what things\npatience and calculation are! Was I not going to embark with forty men,\nand I have now reduced them to twenty for an equal success? Ten thousand\nlivres saved at one stroke, and more safety; that is well! Now, then,\nlet us see; we have nothing to do but to find this lieutenant--let him\nbe found, then; and after--That is not so easy; he must be brave and\ngood, a second myself. Yes, but a lieutenant must have my secret, and as\nthat secret is worth a million, and I shall only pay my man a thousand\nlivres, fifteen hundred at the most, my man will sell the secret to\nMonk. _Mordioux!_ no lieutenant. Besides, this man, were he as mute as\na disciple of Pythagoras,--this man would be sure to have in the troop\nsome favorite soldier, whom he would make his sergeant; the sergeant\nwould penetrate the secret of the lieutenant, in case the latter should\nbe honest and unwilling to sell it. Then the sergeant, less honest and\nless ambitious, will give up the whole for fifty thousand livres. Come,\ncome! that is impossible. The lieutenant is impossible. But then I must\nhave no fractions; I cannot divide my troop in two, and act upon two\npoints, at once, without another self, who--But what is the use of\nacting upon two points, as we have only one man to take? What can be the\nuse of weakening a corps by placing the right here, and the left\nthere? A single corps--_Mordioux!_ a single one, and that commanded by\nD'Artagnan. Very well. But twenty men marching in one band are suspected\nby everybody; twenty horsemen must not be seen marching together, or a\ncompany will be detached against them and the password will be required;\nthe which company, upon seeing them embarrassed to give it, would shoot\nM. d'Artagnan and his men like so many rabbits. I reduce myself then to\nten men; in this fashion I shall act simply and with unity; I shall be\nforced to be prudent, which is half the success in an affair of the kind\nI am undertaking; a greater number might, perhaps, have drawn me into\nsome folly. Ten horses are not many, either, to buy or take. A capital\nidea; what tranquillity it infuses into my mind! no more suspicions--no\npasswords--no more dangers! Ten men, they are valets or clerks. Ten\nmen, leading ten horses laden with merchandise of whatever kind, are\ntolerated, well received everywhere. Ten men travel on account of the\nhouse of Planchet & Co., of France,--nothing can be said against that.\nThese ten men, clothed like manufacturers, have a good cutlass or a good\nmusket at their saddle-bow, and a good pistol in the holster. They never\nallow themselves to be uneasy, because they have no evil designs. They\nare, perhaps, in truth, a little disposed to be smugglers, but what\nharm is in that? Smuggling is not, like polygamy, a hanging offense. The\nworst that can happen to us is the confiscation of our merchandise. Our\nmerchandise confiscated--a fine affair that! Come, come! it is a superb\nplan. Ten men only--ten men, whom I will engage for my service; ten men\nwho shall be as resolute as forty, who would cost me four times as much,\nand to whom, for greater security, I will never open my mouth as to my\ndesigns, and to whom I shall only say 'My friends, there is a blow to be\nstruck.' Things being after this fashion, Satan will be very malicious\nif he plays me one of his tricks. Fifteen thousand livres saved--that's\nsuperb--out of twenty!\"\n\nThus fortified by his laborious calculations, D'Artagnan stopped at this\nplan, and determined to change nothing in it. He had already on a list\nfurnished by his inexhaustible memory, ten men illustrious amongst the\nseekers of adventure, ill-treated by fortune, and not on good terms with\njustice. Upon this D'Artagnan rose, and instantly set off on the search,\ntelling Planchet not to expect him to breakfast, and perhaps not to\ndinner. A day and a half spent in rummaging amongst certain dens of\nParis sufficed for his recruiting; and, without allowing his adventurers\nto communicate with each other, he had picked up and got together, in\nless than thirty hours, a charming collection of ill-looking faces,\nspeaking a French less pure than the English they were about to attempt.\nThese men were, for the most part, guards, whose merit D'Artagnan\nhad had an opportunity of appreciating in various encounters, whom\ndrunkenness, unlucky sword-thrusts, unexpected winnings at play, or the\neconomical reforms of Mazarin, had forced to seek shade and solitude,\nthose two great consolers of irritated and chafing spirits. They\nbore upon their countenances and in their vestments the traces of the\nheartaches they had undergone. Some had their visages scarred,--all\nhad their clothes in rags. D'Artagnan comforted the most needy of\nthese brotherly miseries by a prudent distribution of the crowns of the\ncompany; then, having taken care that these crowns should be employed in\nthe physical improvement of the troop, he appointed a trysting place\nin the north of France, between Bergues and Saint Omer. Six days were\nallowed as the utmost term, and D'Artagnan was sufficiently acquainted\nwith the good-will, the good-humor, and the relative probity of these\nillustrious recruits, to be certain that not one of them would fail in\nhis appointment. These orders given, this rendezvous fixed, he went to\nbid farewell to Planchet, who asked news of his army. D'Artagnan did\nnot think it proper to inform him of the reduction he had made in his\n_personnel_. He feared that the confidence of his associate would be\nabated by such an avowal. Planchet was delighted to learn that the army\nwas levied, and that he (Planchet) found himself a kind of half king,\nwho from his throne-counter kept in pay a body of troops destined\nto make war against perfidious Albion, that enemy of all true French\nhearts. Planchet paid down in double louis, twenty thousand livres\nto D'Artagnan, on the part of himself (Planchet), and twenty thousand\nlivres, still in double louis, in account with D'Artagnan. D'Artagnan\nplaced each of the twenty thousand francs in a bag, and weighing a bag\nin each hand,--\"This money is very embarrassing, my dear Planchet,\" said\nhe. \"Do you know this weighs thirty pounds?\"\n\n\"Bah! your horse will carry that like a feather.\"\n\nD'Artagnan shook his head. \"Don't tell me such things, Planchet: a\nhorse overloaded with thirty pounds, in addition to the rider and his\nportmanteau, cannot cross a river so easily--cannot leap over a wall or\nditch so lightly; and the horse failing, the horseman fails. It is true\nthat you, Planchet, who have served in the infantry, may not be aware of\nall that.\"\n\n\"Then what is to be done, monsieur?\" said Planchet, greatly embarrassed.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" said D'Artagnan. \"I will pay my army on its return home.\nKeep my half of twenty thousand livres, which you can use during that\ntime.\"\n\n\"And my half?\" said Planchet.\n\n\"I shall take that with me.\"\n\n\"Your confidence does me honor,\" said Planchet: \"but supposing you\nshould not return?\"\n\n\"That is possible, though not very probable. Then, Planchet, in case I\nshould not return--give me a pen; I will make my will.\" D'Artagnan took\na pen and some paper, and wrote upon a plain sheet,--\"I, D'Artagnan,\npossess twenty thousand livres, laid up cent per cent during thirty\nyears that I have been in the service of his majesty the king of France.\nI leave five thousand to Athos, five thousand to Porthos, and five\nthousand to Aramis, that they may give the said sums in my name and\ntheir own to my young friend Raoul, Vicomte de Bragelonne. I give the\nremaining five thousand to Planchet, that he may distribute the fifteen\nthousand with less regret among my friends. With which purpose I sign\nthese presents.--D'ARTAGNAN.\"\n\nPlanchet appeared very curious to know what D'Artagnan had written.\n\n\"Here,\" said the musketeer, \"read it.\"\n\nOn reading the last lines the tears came into Planchet's eyes. \"You\nthink, then, that I would not have given the money without that? Then I\nwill have none of your five thousand francs.\"\n\nD'Artagnan smiled. \"Accept it, accept it, Planchet; and in that way you\nwill only lose fifteen thousand francs instead of twenty thousand, and\nyou will not be tempted to disregard the signature of your master and\nfriend, by losing nothing at all.\"\n\nHow well that dear Monsieur d'Artagnan knew the hearts of men and\ngrocers! They who have pronounced Don Quixote mad because he rode out\nto the conquest of an empire with nobody but Sancho his squire, and they\nwho have pronounced Sancho mad because he accompanied his master in\nhis attempt to conquer the said empire,--they certainly will have no\nhesitation in extending the same judgment to D'Artagnan and Planchet.\nAnd yet the first passed for one of the most subtle spirits among the\nastute spirits of the court of France. As to the second, he had acquired\nby good right the reputation of having one of the longest heads\namong the grocers of the Rue des Lombards; consequently of Paris, and\nconsequently of France. Now, to consider these two men from the point of\nview from which you would consider other men, and the means by the aid\nof which they contemplated to restore a monarch to his throne, compared\nwith other means, the shallowest brains of the country where brains are\nmost shallow must have revolted against the presumptuous madness of the\nlieutenant and the stupidity of his associate. Fortunately, D'Artagnan\nwas not a man to listen to the idle talk of those around him, or to the\ncomments that were made on himself. He had adopted the motto, \"Act well,\nand let people talk.\" Planchet, on his part had adopted this, \"Act and\nsay nothing.\" It resulted from this, that, according to the custom\nof all superior geniuses, these two men flattered themselves, _intra\npectus_, with being in the right against all who found fault with them.\n\nAs a beginning, D'Artagnan set out in the finest of possible weather,\nwithout a cloud in the heavens--without a cloud on his mind, joyous\nand strong, calm and decided, great in his resolution, and consequently\ncarrying with him a tenfold dose of that potent fluid which the shocks\nof mind cause to spring from the nerves, and which procure for the\nhuman machine a force and an influence of which future ages will render,\naccording to all probability, a more arithmetical account than we can\npossibly do at present. He was again, as in times past, on that same\nroad of adventures which had led him to Boulogne, and which he was now\ntraveling for the fourth time. It appeared to him that he could almost\nrecognize the trace of his own steps upon the road, and that of his\nfist upon the doors of the hostelries;--his memory, always active and\npresent, brought back that youth which neither thirty years later his\ngreat heart nor his wrist of steel would have belied. What a rich nature\nwas that of this man! He had all the passions, all the defects, all\nthe weaknesses, and the spirit of contradiction familiar to his\nunderstanding changed all these imperfections into corresponding\nqualities. D'Artagnan, thanks to his ever active imagination, was afraid\nof a shadow, and ashamed of being afraid, he marched straight up to that\nshadow, and then became extravagant in his bravery, if the danger proved\nto be real. Thus everything in him was emotion, and therefore enjoyment.\nHe loved the society of others, but never became tired of his own; and\nmore than once, if he could have been heard when he was alone, he might\nhave been seen laughing at the jokes he related to himself or the tricks\nhis imagination created just five minutes before _ennui_ might have been\nlooked for. D'Artagnan was not perhaps so gay this time as he would have\nbeen with the prospect of finding some good friends at Calais, instead\nof joining the ten scamps there; melancholy, however, did not visit him\nmore than once a day, and it was about five visits that he received from\nthat somber deity before he got sight of the sea at Boulogne, and then\nthese visits were indeed but short. But when once D'Artagnan found\nhimself near the field of action, all other feelings but that of\nconfidence disappeared never to return. From Boulogne he followed the\ncoast to Calais. Calais was the place of general rendezvous, and at\nCalais he had named to each of his recruits the hostelry of \"Le Grande\nMonarque,\" where living was not extravagant, where sailors messed, and\nwhere men of the sword, with sheath of leather, be it understood, found\nlodging, table, food, and all the comforts of life, for thirty sous\nper diem. D'Artagnan proposed to himself to take them by surprise\n_in flagrante delicto_ of wandering life, and to judge by the first\nappearance if he could count on them as trusty companions.\n\nHe arrived at Calais at half past four in the afternoon.\n\n\n\nChapter XXII. D'Artagnan travels for the House of Planchet and Company.\n\nThe hostelry of \"Le Grand Monarque\" was situated in a little street\nparallel to the port without looking out upon the port itself. Some\nlanes cut--as steps cut the two parallels of the ladder--the two great\nstraight lines of the port and the street. By these lanes passengers\ncame suddenly from the port into the street, or from the street on to\nthe port. D'Artagnan, arrived at the port, took one of these lanes, and\ncame out in front of the hostelry of \"Le Grand Monarque.\" The moment\nwas well chosen and might remind D'Artagnan of his start in life at\nthe hostelry of the \"Franc-Meunier\" at Meung. Some sailors who had been\nplaying at dice had started a quarrel, and were threatening each other\nfuriously. The host, hostess, and two lads were watching with anxiety\nthe circle of these angry gamblers, from the midst of which war seemed\nready to break forth, bristling with knives and hatchets. The play,\nnevertheless, was continued. A stone bench was occupied by two men, who\nappeared thence to watch the door; four tables, placed at the back of\nthe common chamber, were occupied by eight other individuals. Neither\nthe men at the door, nor those at the tables took any part in the\nplay or the quarrel. D'Artagnan recognized his ten men in these cold,\nindifferent spectators. The quarrel went on increasing. Every passion\nhas, like the sea, its tide which ascends and descends. Reaching the\nclimax of passion, one sailor overturned the table and the money which\nwas upon it. The table fell, and the money rolled about. In an instant\nall belonging to the hostelry threw themselves upon the stakes, and\nmany a piece of silver was picked up by people who stole away whilst the\nsailors were scuffling with each other.\n\nThe two men on the bench and the eight at the tables, although they\nseemed perfect strangers to each other, these ten men alone, we say,\nappeared to have agreed to remain impassible amidst the cries of fury\nand the chinking of money. Two only contented themselves with pushing\nwith their feet combatants who came under their table. Two others,\nrather than take part in this disturbance, buried their hands in their\npockets; and another two jumped upon the table they occupied, as people\ndo to avoid being submerged by overflowing water.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said D'Artagnan to himself, not having lost one of the\ndetails we have related, \"this is a very fair gathering--circumspect,\ncalm, accustomed to disturbance, acquainted with blows! _Peste!_ I have\nbeen lucky.\"\n\nAll at once his attention was called to a particular part of the room.\nThe two men who had pushed the strugglers with their feet, were assailed\nwith abuse by the sailors, who had become reconciled. One of them,\nhalf drunk with passion, and quite drunk with beer, came, in a menacing\nmanner, to demand of the shorter of these two sages by what right he had\ntouched with his foot creatures of the good God, who were not dogs.\nAnd whilst putting this question, in order to make it more direct, he\napplied his great fist to the nose of D'Artagnan's recruit.\n\nThis man became pale, without its being to be discerned whether his\npallor arose from anger or fear; seeing which, the sailor concluded\nit was from fear, and raised his fist with the manifest intention of\nletting it fall upon the head of the stranger. But though the threatened\nman did not appear to move, he dealt the sailor such a severe blow in\nthe stomach that he sent him rolling and howling to the other side of\nthe room. At the same instant, rallied by the _espirit de corps_, all\nthe comrades of the conquered man fell upon the conqueror.\n\nThe latter, with the same coolness of which he had given proof, without\ncommitting the imprudence of touching his weapons, took up a beer-pot\nwith a pewter-lid, and knocked down two or three of his assailants;\nthen, as he was about to yield to numbers, the seven other silent men at\nthe tables, who had not yet stirred, perceived that their cause was at\nstake, and came to the rescue. At the same time, the two indifferent\nspectators at the door turned round with frowning bows, indicating their\nevident intention of taking the enemy in the rear, if the enemy did not\ncease their aggressions.\n\nThe host, his helpers, and two watchmen who were passing, and who from\nthe curiosity had penetrated too far into the room, were mixed up in the\ntumult and showered with blows. The Parisians hit like Cyclops, with an\n_ensemble_ and a tactic delightful to behold. At length, obliged to beat\na retreat before superior numbers, they formed an intrenchment behind\nthe large table, which they raised by main force; whilst the two\nothers, arming themselves each with a trestle, and using it like a great\nsledge-hammer, knocked down at a blow eight sailors upon whose heads\nthey had brought their monstrous catapult in play. The floor was already\nstrewn with wounded, and the room filled with cries and dust, when\nD'Artagnan, satisfied with the test, advanced, sword in hand, and\nstriking with the pommel every head that came in his way, he uttered a\nvigorous _hola!_ which put an instantaneous end to the conflict. A great\nback-flood directly took place from the center to the sides of the room,\nso that D'Artagnan found himself isolated and dominator.\n\n\"What is this all about?\" then demanded he of the assembly, with the\nmajestic tone of Neptune pronouncing the _Quos ego_.\n\nAt the very instant, at the first sound of his voice, to carry on\nthe Virgilian metaphor, D'Artagnan's recruits, recognizing each his\nsovereign lord, discontinued their plank-fighting and trestle blows. On\ntheir side, the sailors, seeing that long naked sword, that martial\nair, and the agile arm which came to the rescue of their enemies, in the\nperson of a man who seemed accustomed to command, the sailors picked up\ntheir wounded and their pitchers. The Parisians wiped their brows, and\nviewed their leader with respect. D'Artagnan was loaded with thanks by\nthe host of \"Le Grand Monarque.\" He received them like a man who knows\nthat nothing is being offered that does not belong to him, and then said\nhe would go and walk upon the port till supper was ready. Immediately\neach of the recruits, who understood the summons, took his hat, brushed\nthe dust off his clothes, and followed D'Artagnan. But D'Artagnan,\nwhilst walking and observing, took care not to stop; he directed\nhis course towards the downs, and the ten men--surprised at finding\nthemselves going in the track of each other, uneasy at seeing on their\nright, on their left, and behind them, companions upon whom they had not\nreckoned--followed him, casting furtive glances at each other. It was\nnot till he had arrived at the hollow part of the deepest down that\nD'Artagnan, smiling to see them outdone, turned towards them, making a\nfriendly sign with his hand.\n\n\"Eh! come, come, gentlemen,\" said he, \"let us not devour each other; you\nare made to live together, to understand each other in all respects, and\nnot to devour one another.\"\n\nInstantly all hesitation ceased; the men breathed as if they had been\ntaken out of a coffin, and examined each other complacently. After this\nexamination they turned their eyes towards their leader, who had long\nbeen acquainted with the art of speaking to men of that class, and who\nimprovised the following little speech, pronounced with an energy truly\nGascon:\n\n\"Gentlemen, you all know who I am. I have engaged you from knowing\nyou to be brave, and willing to associate you with me in a glorious\nenterprise. Imagine that in laboring for me you labor for the king. I\nonly warn you that if you allow anything of this supposition to appear,\nI shall be forced to crack your skulls immediately, in the manner most\nconvenient to me. You are not ignorant, gentlemen, that state secrets\nare like a mortal poison: as long as that poison is in its box and the\nbox is closed, it is not injurious; out of the box, it kills. Now draw\nnear, and you shall know as much of this secret as I am able to tell\nyou.\" All drew close to him with an expression of curiosity. \"Approach,\"\ncontinued D'Artagnan, \"and let not the bird which passes over our heads,\nthe rabbit which sports on the downs, the fish which bounds from the\nwaters, hear us. Our business is to learn and to report to monsieur\nle surintendant of the finances to what extent English smuggling is\ninjurious to the French merchants. I shall enter every place, and see\neverything. We are poor Picard fishermen, thrown upon the coast by a\nstorm. It is certain that we must sell fish, neither more nor less, like\ntrue fishermen. Only people might guess who we are, and might molest\nus; it is therefore necessary that we should be in a condition to defend\nourselves. And this is why I have selected men of spirit and courage. We\nshall lead a steady life, and not incur much danger, seeing that we\nhave behind us a powerful protector, thanks to whom no embarrassment\nis possible. One thing alone puzzles me; but I hope that after a short\nexplanation, you will relieve me from that difficulty. The thing which\npuzzles me is taking with me a crew of stupid fishermen, which crew will\nannoy me immensely, whilst if, by chance, there were among you any who\nhave seen the sea--\"\n\n\"Oh! don't let that trouble you,\" said one of the recruits; \"I was a\nprisoner among the pirates of Tunis three years, and can maneuver a boat\nlike an admiral.\"\n\n\"See,\" said D'Artagnan, \"what an admirable thing chance is!\" D'Artagnan\npronounced these words with an indefinable tone of feigned _bonhomie_,\nfor he knew very well that the victim of the pirates was an old corsair,\nand had engaged him in consequence of that knowledge. But D'Artagnan\nnever said more than there was need to say, in order to leave people in\ndoubt. He paid himself with the explanation, and welcomed the effect,\nwithout appearing to be preoccupied with the cause.\n\n\"And I,\" said a second, \"I, by chance, had an uncle who directed the\nworks of the port of La Rochelle. When quite a child, I played about\nthe boats, and I know how to handle an oar or a sail as well as the best\nPonantais sailor.\" The latter did not lie much more than the first, for\nhe had rowed on board his majesty's galleys six years, at Ciotat. Two\nothers were more frank: they confessed honestly that they had served\non board a vessel as soldiers as punishment, and did not blush for it.\nD'Artagnan found himself, then, the leader of ten men of war and four\nsailors, having at once an land army and a sea force, which would have\ncarried the pride of Planchet to its height, if Planchet had known the\ndetails.\n\nNothing was now left but arranging the general orders, and D'Artagnan\ngave them with precision. He enjoined his men to be ready to set out for\nthe Hague, some following the coast which leads to Breskens, others the\nroad to Antwerp. The rendezvous was given, by calculating each day's\nmarch, a fortnight from that time, upon the chief place at the Hague.\nD'Artagnan recommended his men to go in couples, as they liked best,\nfrom sympathy. He himself selected from among those with the least\ndisreputable look, two guards whom he had formerly known, and whose only\nfaults were being drunkards and gamblers. These men had not entirely\nlost all ideas of civilization, and under proper garments their hearts\nwould beat again. D'Artagnan, not to create any jealousy with the\nothers, made the rest go forward. He kept his two selected ones, clothed\nthem from his own wardrobe, and set out with them.\n\nIt was to these two, whom he seemed to honor with an absolute\nconfidence, that D'Artagnan imparted a false secret, destined to secure\nthe success of the expedition. He confessed to them that the object was\nnot to learn to what extent French merchants were injured by English\nsmuggling, but to learn how far French smuggling could annoy English\ntrade. These men appeared convinced; they were effectively so.\nD'Artagnan was quite sure that at the first debauch, when thoroughly\ndrunk, one of the two would divulge the secret to the whole band. His\ngame appeared infallible.\n\nA fortnight after all we have said had taken place at Calais, the whole\ntroop assembled at the Hague.\n\nThen D'Artagnan perceived that all his men, with remarkable\nintelligence, had already travestied themselves into sailors, more or\nless ill-treated by the sea. D'Artagnan left them to sleep in a den in\nNewkerke street, whilst he lodged comfortably upon the Grand Canal. He\nlearned that the king of England had come back to his old ally, William\nII. of Nassau, stadtholder of Holland. He learned also that the refusal\nof Louis XIV. had a little cooled the protection afforded him up to that\ntime, and in consequence he had gone to reside in a little village house\nat Scheveningen, situated in the downs, on the sea-shore, about a league\nfrom the Hague.\n\nThere, it was said, the unfortunate banished king consoled himself in\nhis exile, by looking, with the melancholy peculiar to the princes\nof his race, at that immense North Sea, which separated him from his\nEngland, as it had formerly separated Mary Stuart from France. There,\nbehind the trees of the beautiful wood of Scheveningen, on the fine sand\nupon which grows the golden broom of the down, Charles II. vegetated as\nit did, more unfortunate, for he had life and thought, and he hoped and\ndespaired by turns.\n\nD'Artagnan went once as far as Scheveningen, in order to be certain that\nall was true that was said of the king. He beheld Charles II., pensive\nand alone, coming out of a little door opening into the wood, and\nwalking on the beach in the setting sun, without even attracting the\nattention of the fishermen, who, on their return in the evening, drew,\nlike the ancient mariners of the Archipelago, their barks up upon the\nsand of the shore.\n\nD'Artagnan recognized the king; he saw him fix his melancholy look upon\nthe immense extent of the waters, and absorb upon his pale countenance\nthe red rays of the sun already cut by the black line of the horizon.\nThen Charles returned to his isolated abode, always alone, slow and sad,\namusing himself with making the friable and moving sand creak beneath\nhis feet.\n\nThat very evening D'Artagnan hired for a thousand livres a fishing-boat\nworth four thousand. He paid a thousand livres down, and deposited the\nthree thousand with a Burgomaster, after which he brought on board,\nwithout their being seen, the six men who formed his land army; and with\nthe rising tide, at three o'clock in the morning, he got into the open\nsea, maneuvering ostensibly with the four others, and depending upon the\nscience of his galley slave as upon that of the first pilot of the port.\n\n\n\nChapter XXIII. In which the Author, very unwillingly, is forced to write\na Little History.\n\nWhile kings and men were thus occupied with England, which governed\nitself quite alone, and which, it must be said in its praise, had never\nbeen so badly governed, a man upon whom God had fixed his eye, and\nplaced his finger, a man predestined to write his name in brilliant\nletters upon the page of history, was pursuing in the face of the world\na work full of mystery and audacity. He went on, and no one knew whither\nhe meant to go, although not only England, but France, and Europe,\nwatched him marching with a firm step and head held high. All that was\nknown of this man we are about to tell.\n\nMonk had just declared himself in favor of the liberty of the Rump\nParliament, a parliament which General Lambert, imitating Cromwell,\nwhose lieutenant he had been, had just blocked up so closely, in order\nto bring it to his will, that no member, during all the blockade, was\nable to go out, and only one, Peter Wentworth, had been able to get in.\n\nLambert and Monk--everything was summed up in these two men; the first\nrepresenting military despotism, the second pure republicanism. These\nmen were the two sole political representatives of that revolution in\nwhich Charles I. had first lost his crown, and afterwards his head. As\nregarded Lambert, he did not dissemble his views; he sought to establish\na military government, and to be himself the head of that government.\n\nMonk, a rigid republican, some said, wished to maintain the Rump\nParliament, that visible though degenerated representative of the\nrepublic. Monk, artful and ambitious, said others, wished simply to make\nof this parliament, which he affected to protect, a solid step by which\nto mount the throne which Cromwell had left empty, but upon which he had\nnever dared to take his seat.\n\nThus Lambert by persecuting the parliament, and Monk by declaring for\nit, had mutually proclaimed themselves enemies of each other. Monk and\nLambert, therefore, had at first thought of creating an army each\nfor himself: Monk in Scotland, where were the Presbyterians and the\nroyalists, that is to say, the malcontents; Lambert in London, where was\nfound, as is always the case, the strongest opposition to the existing\npower which it had beneath its eyes.\n\nMonk had pacified Scotland, he had there formed for himself an army, and\nfound an asylum. The one watched the other. Monk knew that the day was\nnot yet come, the day marked by the Lord for a great change; his sword,\ntherefore, appeared glued to the sheath. Inexpugnable in his wild and\nmountainous Scotland, an absolute general, king of an army of eleven\nthousand old soldiers, whom he had more than once led on to victory; as\nwell informed, nay, even better, of the affairs of London, than Lambert,\nwho held garrison in the city,--such was the position of Monk, when, at\na hundred leagues from London, he declared himself for the parliament.\nLambert, on the contrary, as we have said, lived in the capital. That\nwas the center of all his operations, and he there collected all around\nhim all his friends, and all the people of the lower class, eternally\ninclined to cherish the enemies of constituted power.\n\nIt was then in London that Lambert learnt the support that, from the\nfrontiers of Scotland, Monk lent to the parliament. He judged there was\nno time to be lost, and that the Tweed was not so far distant from\nthe Thames that an army could not march from one river to the other,\nparticularly when it was well commanded. He knew, besides, that as fast\nas the soldiers of Monk penetrated into England, they would form on\ntheir route that ball of snow, the emblem of the globe of fortune, which\nis for the ambitious nothing but a step growing unceasingly higher\nto conduct him to his object. He got together, therefore, his army,\nformidable at the same time for its composition and its numbers, and\nhastened to meet Monk, who, on his part, like a prudent navigator\nsailing amidst rocks, advanced by very short marches, listening to the\nreports which came from London.\n\nThe two armies came in sight of each other near Newcastle; Lambert,\narriving first, encamped in the city itself. Monk, always circumspect,\nstopped where he was, and placed his general quarters at Coldstream, on\nthe Tweed. The sight of Lambert spread joy through Monk's army, whilst,\non the contrary, the sight of Monk threw disorder into Lambert's army.\nIt might have been thought that these intrepid warriors, who had made\nsuch a noise in the streets of London, had set out with the hopes of\nmeeting no one, and that now seeing that they had met an army, and that\nthat army hoisted before them not only a standard, but still further, a\ncause and a principle,--it might have been believed, we say, that\nthese intrepid warriors had begun to reflect that they were less good\nrepublicans than the soldiers of Monk, since the latter supported the\nparliament; whilst Lambert supported nothing, not even himself.\n\nAs to Monk, if he had had to reflect, or if he did reflect, it must have\nbeen after a sad fashion, for history relates--and that modest dame, it\nis well known, never lies--history relates, that the day of his arrival\nat Coldstream search was made in vain throughout the place for a single\nsheep.\n\nIf Monk had commanded an English army, that was enough to have brought\nabout a general desertion. But it is not with the Scots as it is\nwith the English, to whom that fluid flesh which is called blood is\na paramount necessity; the Scots, a poor and sober race, live upon a\nlittle barley crushed between two stones, diluted with the water of the\nfountain, and cooked upon another stone, heated.\n\nThe Scots, their distribution of barley being made, cared very little\nwhether there was or was not any meat in Coldstream. Monk, little\naccustomed to barley-cakes, was hungry, and his staff, at least as\nhungry as himself, looked with anxiety right and left, to know what was\nbeing prepared for supper.\n\nMonk ordered search to be made; his scouts had on arriving in the place\nfound it deserted and the cupboards empty; upon butchers and bakers it\nwas of no use depending in Coldstream. The smallest morsel of bread,\nthen, could not be found for the general's table.\n\nAs accounts succeeded each other, all equally unsatisfactory, Monk,\nseeing terror and discouragement upon every face, declared that he was\nnot hungry; besides, they should eat on the morrow, since Lambert was\nthere probably with the intention of giving battle, and consequently\nwould give up his provisions, if he were forced from Newcastle, or\nforever to relieve Monk's soldiers from hunger if he conquered.\n\nThis consolation was only efficacious upon a very small number; but of\nwhat importance was it to Monk? for Monk was very absolute, under the\nappearance of the most perfect mildness. Every one, therefore, was\nobliged to be satisfied, or at least to appear so. Monk, quite as hungry\nas his people, but affecting perfect indifference for the absent mutton,\ncut a fragment of tobacco, half an inch long, from the _carotte_ of a\nsergeant who formed part of his suite, and began to masticate the said\nfragment, assuring his lieutenant that hunger was a chimera, and that,\nbesides, people were never hungry when they had anything to chew.\n\nThis joke satisfied some of those who had resisted Monk's first\ndeduction drawn from the neighborhood of Lambert's army; the number of\nthe dissentients diminished greatly; the guard took their posts, the\npatrols began, and the general continued his frugal repast beneath his\nopen tent.\n\nBetween his camp and that of the enemy stood an old abbey, of which,\nat the present day, there only remain some ruins, but which then was\nin existence, and was called Newcastle Abbey. It was built upon a vast\nsite, independent at once of the plain and of the river, because it was\nalmost a marsh fed by springs and kept up by rains. Nevertheless, in\nthe midst of these pools of water, covered with long grass, rushes,\nand reeds, were seen solid spots of ground, formerly used as the\nkitchen-garden, the park, the pleasure-gardens, and other dependencies\nof the abbey, looking like one of those great sea-spiders, whose body is\nround, whilst the claws go diverging round from this circumference.\n\nThe kitchen-garden, one of the longest claws of the abbey, extended to\nMonk's camp. Unfortunately it was, as we have said, early in June, and\nthe kitchen-garden, being abandoned, offered no resources.\n\nMonk had ordered this spot to be guarded, as most subject to surprises.\nThe fires of the enemy's general were plainly to be perceived on the\nother side of the abbey. But between these fires and the abbey extended\nthe Tweed, unfolding its luminous scales beneath the thick shade of\ntall green oaks. Monk was perfectly well acquainted with this position,\nNewcastle and its environs having already more than once been his\nheadquarters. He knew that by this day his enemy might without doubt\nthrow a few scouts into these ruins and promote a skirmish, but that by\nnight he would take care to abstain from such a risk. He felt himself,\ntherefore, in security.\n\nThus his soldiers saw him, after what he boastingly called his\nsupper--that is to say, after the exercise of mastication reported by\nus at the commencement of this chapter--like Napoleon on the eve of\nAusterlitz, seated asleep in his rush chair, half beneath the light of\nhis lamp, half beneath the reflection of the moon, commencing its ascent\nin the heavens, which denoted that it was nearly half past nine in the\nevening. All at once Monk was roused from his half sleep, fictitious\nperhaps, by a troop of soldiers, who came with joyous cries, and kicked\nthe poles of his tent with a humming noise as if on purpose to wake him.\nThere was no need of so much noise; the general opened his eyes quickly.\n\n\"Well, my children, what is going on now?\" asked the general.\n\n\"General!\" replied several voices at once, \"General! you shall have some\nsupper.\"\n\n\"I have had my supper, gentlemen,\" replied he quietly, \"and was\ncomfortably digesting it, as you see. But come in, and tell me what\nbrings you hither.\"\n\n\"Good news, general.\"\n\n\"Bah! Has Lambert sent us word that he will fight to-morrow?\"\n\n\"No; but we have just captured a fishing-boat conveying fish to\nNewcastle.\"\n\n\"And you have done very wrong, my friends. These gentlemen from London\nare delicate, must have their first course; you will put them sadly out\nof humor this evening, and to-morrow they will be pitiless. It would\nreally be in good taste to send back to Lambert both his fish and his\nfishermen, unless--\" and the general reflected an instant.\n\n\"Tell me,\" continued he, \"what are these fishermen, if you please?\"\n\n\"Some Picard seamen who were fishing on the coasts of France or Holland,\nand who have been thrown upon ours by a gale of wind.\"\n\n\"Do any among them speak our language?\"\n\n\"The leader spoke some few words of English.\"\n\nThe mistrust of the general was awakened in proportion as fresh\ninformation reached him. \"That is well,\" said he. \"I wish to see these\nmen; bring them to me.\"\n\nAn officer immediately went to fetch them.\n\n\"How many are there of them?\" continued Monk; \"and what is their\nvessel?\"\n\n\"There are ten or twelve of them, general, and they were aboard of a\nkind of _chasse-maree_, as it is called--Dutch-built, apparently.\"\n\n\"And you say they were carrying fish to Lambert's camp?\"\n\n\"Yes, general, and they seem to have had good luck in their fishing.\"\n\n\"Humph! We shall see that,\" said Monk.\n\nAt this moment the officer returned, bringing the leader of the\nfishermen with him. He was a man from fifty to fifty-five years old,\nbut good-looking for his age. He was of middle height, and wore a\n_justaucorps_ of coarse wool, a cap pulled down over his eyes, a cutlass\nhung from his belt, and he walked with the hesitation peculiar to\nsailors, who, never knowing, thanks to the movement of the vessel,\nwhether their foot will be placed upon the plank or upon nothing, give\nto every one of their steps a fall as firm as if they were driving a\npile. Monk, with an acute and penetrating look, examined the fisherman\nfor some time, while the latter smiled, with that smile, half cunning,\nhalf silly, peculiar to French peasants.\n\n\"Do you speak English?\" asked Monk, in excellent French.\n\n\"Ah! but badly, my lord,\" replied the fisherman.\n\nThis reply was made much more with the lively and sharp accentuation of\nthe people beyond the Loire, than with the slightly-drawling accent of\nthe countries of the west and north of France.\n\n\"But you do speak it?\" persisted Monk, in order to examine his accent\nonce more.\n\n\"Eh! we men of the sea,\" replied the fisherman, \"speak a little of all\nlanguages.\"\n\n\"Then you are a sea fisherman?\"\n\n\"I am at present, my lord--a fisherman, and a famous fisherman, too. I\nhave taken a barbel that weighs at least thirty pounds, and more\nthan fifty mullets; I have also some little whitings that will fry\nbeautifully.\"\n\n\"You appear to me to have fished more frequently in the Gulf of Gascony\nthan in the Channel,\" said Monk, smiling.\n\n\"Well, I am from the south; but does that prevent me from being a good\nfisherman, my lord?\"\n\n\"Oh! not at all; I shall buy your fish. And now speak frankly; for whom\ndid you destine them?\"\n\n\"My lord, I will conceal nothing from you. I was going to Newcastle,\nfollowing the coast, when a party of horsemen who were passing along\nin an opposite direction made a sign to my bark to turn back to your\nhonor's camp, under penalty of a discharge of musketry. As I was not\narmed for fighting,\" added the fisherman, smiling, \"I was forced to\nsubmit.\"\n\n\"And why did you go to Lambert's camp in preference to mine?\"\n\n\"My lord, I will be frank; will your lordship permit me?\"\n\n\"Yes, and even if need be shall command you to be so.\"\n\n\"Well, my lord, I was going to M. Lambert's camp because those gentlemen\nfrom the city pay well--whilst your Scotchmen, Puritans, Presbyterians,\nCovenanters, or whatever you chose to call them, eat but little, and pay\nfor nothing.\"\n\nMonk shrugged his shoulders, without, however, being able to refrain\nfrom smiling at the same time. \"How is it that, being from the south,\nyou come to fish on our coasts?\"\n\n\"Because I have been fool enough to marry in Picardy.\"\n\n\"Yes; but even Picardy is not England.\"\n\n\"My lord, man shoves his boat into the sea, but God and the wind do the\nrest, and drive the boat where they please.\"\n\n\"You had, then, no intention of landing on our coasts?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"And what route were you steering?\"\n\n\"We were returning from Ostend, where some mackerel had already been\nseen, when a sharp wind from the south drove us from our course; then,\nseeing that it was useless to struggle against it, we let it drive us.\nIt then became necessary, not to lose our fish, which were good, to go\nand sell them at the nearest English port, and that was Newcastle.\nWe were told the opportunity was good, as there was an increase of\npopulation in the camp, an increase of population in the city; both,\nwe were told, were full of gentlemen, very rich and very hungry. So we\nsteered our course towards Newcastle.\"\n\n\"And your companions, where are they?\"\n\n\"Oh, my companions have remained on board; they are sailors without the\nleast instruction.\"\n\n\"Whilst you--\" said Monk.\n\n\"Who, I?\" said the _patron_, laughing; \"I have sailed about with my\nfather; and I know what is called a sou, a crown, a pistole, a louis,\nand a double louis, in all the languages of Europe; my crew, therefore,\nlisten to me as they would to an oracle, and obey me as if I were an\nadmiral.\"\n\n\"Then it was you who preferred M. Lambert as the best customer?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly. And, to be frank, my lord, was I wrong?\"\n\n\"You will see that by and by.\"\n\n\"At all events, my lord, if there is a fault, the fault is mine; and my\ncomrades should not be dealt hardly with on that account.\"\n\n\"This is decidedly an intelligent, sharp fellow,\" thought Monk.\nThen, after a few minutes' silence employed in scrutinizing the\nfisherman,--\"You come from Ostend, did you not say?\" asked the general.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, in a straight line.\"\n\n\"You have then heard of the affairs of the day; for I have no doubt that\nboth in France and Holland they excite interest. What is he doing who\ncalls himself king of England?\"\n\n\"Oh, my lord!\" cried the fisherman, with loud and expansive frankness,\n\"that is a lucky question, and you could not put it to anybody better\nthan to me, for in truth I can make you a famous reply. Imagine, my\nlord, that when putting into Ostend to sell the few mackerel we had\ncaught, I saw the ex-king walking on the downs waiting for his horses,\nwhich were to take him to the Hague. He is a rather tall, pale man, with\nblack hair, and somewhat hard-featured. He looks ill, and I don't think\nthe air of Holland agrees with him.\"\n\nMonk followed with the greatest attention the rapid, heightened, and\ndiffuse conversation of the fisherman, in a language which was not\nhis own, but which, as we have said, he spoke with great facility. The\nfisherman, on his part, employed sometimes a French word, sometimes an\nEnglish word, and sometimes a word which appeared not to belong to any\nlanguage, but was, in truth, pure Gascon. Fortunately his eyes spoke for\nhim, and that so eloquently, that it was possible to lose a word\nfrom his mouth, but not a single intention from his eyes. The general\nappeared more and more satisfied with his examination. \"You must have\nheard that this ex-king, as you call him, was going to the Hague for\nsome purpose?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the fisherman, \"I heard that.\"\n\n\"And what was his purpose?\"\n\n\"Always the same,\" said the fisherman. \"Must he not always entertain the\nfixed idea of returning to England?\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Monk, pensively.\n\n\"Without reckoning,\" added the fisherman, \"that the stadtholder--you\nknow, my lord, William II.?--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He will assist him with all his power.\"\n\n\"Ah! did you hear that said?\"\n\n\"No, but I think so.\"\n\n\"You are quite a politician, apparently,\" said Monk.\n\n\"Why, we sailors, my lord, who are accustomed to study the water and the\nair--that is to say, the two most changeable things in the world--are\nseldom deceived as to the rest.\"\n\n\"Now, then,\" said Monk, changing the conversation, \"I am told you are\ngoing to provision us.\"\n\n\"I shall do my best, my lord.\"\n\n\"How much do you ask for your fish in the first place?\"\n\n\"Not such a fool as to name a price, my lord.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because my fish is yours.\"\n\n\"By what right?\"\n\n\"By that of the strongest.\"\n\n\"But my intention is to pay you for it.\"\n\n\"That is very generous of you, my lord.\"\n\n\"And the worth of it--\"\n\n\"My lord, I fix no price.\"\n\n\"What do you ask, then?\"\n\n\"I only ask to be permitted to go away.\"\n\n\"Where?--to General Lambert's camp?\"\n\n\"I!\" cried the fisherman; \"what should I go to Newcastle for, now I have\nno longer any fish?\"\n\n\"At all events, listen to me.\"\n\n\"I do, my lord.\"\n\n\"I shall give you some advice.\"\n\n\"How, my lord!--pay me and give me good advice likewise! You overwhelm\nme, my lord.\"\n\nMonk looked more earnestly than ever at the fisherman, about whom he\nstill appeared to entertain some suspicion. \"Yes, I shall pay you, and\ngive you a piece of advice; for the two things are connected. If you\nreturn, then, to General Lambert--\"\n\nThe fisherman made a movement of his head and shoulders, which\nsignified, \"If he persists in it, I won't contradict him.\"\n\n\"Do not cross the marsh,\" continued Monk: \"you will have money in your\npocket, and there are in the marsh some Scottish ambuscaders I have\nplaced there. Those people are very intractable; they understand but\nvery little of the language which you speak, although it appears to me\nto be composed of three languages. They might take from you what I have\ngiven you, and, on your return to your country, you would not fail to\nsay that General Monk has two hands, the one Scottish, and the other\nEnglish; and that he takes back with the Scottish hand what he has given\nwith the English hand.\"\n\n\"Oh! general, I shall go where you like, be sure of that,\" said the\nfisherman, with a fear too expressive not to be exaggerated. \"I only\nwish to remain here, if you will allow me to remain.\"\n\n\"I readily believe you,\" said Monk, with an imperceptible smile, \"but I\ncannot, nevertheless, keep you in my tent.\"\n\n\"I have no such wish, my lord, and desire only that your lordship should\npoint out where you will have me posted. Do not trouble yourself about\nus--with us a night soon passes away.\"\n\n\"You shall be conducted to your bark.\"\n\n\"As your lordship pleases. Only, if your lordship would allow me to be\ntaken back by a carpenter, I should be extremely grateful.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because the gentlemen of your army, in dragging my boat up the river\nwith a cable pulled by their horses, have battered it a little upon\nthe rocks of the shore, so that I have at least two feet of water in my\nhold, my lord.\"\n\n\"The greater reason why you should watch your boat, I think.\"\n\n\"My lord, I am quite at your orders,\" said the fisherman; \"I shall empty\nmy baskets where you wish; then you will pay me, if you please to do so;\nand you will send me away, if it appears right to you. You see I am very\neasily managed and pleased, my lord.\"\n\n\"Come, come, you are a very good sort of fellow,\" said Monk, whose\nscrutinizing glance had not been able to find a single shade in the\nclear eye of the fisherman. \"Holloa, Digby!\" An aid-de-camp appeared.\n\"You will conduct this good fellow and his companions to the little\ntents of the canteens, in front of the marshes, so that they will be\nnear their bark, and yet will not sleep on board to-night. What is the\nmatter, Spithead?\"\n\nSpithead was the sergeant from whom Monk had borrowed a piece of tobacco\nfor his supper. Spithead having entered the general's tent without being\nsent for, had drawn this question from Monk.\n\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"a French gentleman has just presented himself at\nthe outposts and wishes to speak to your honor.\"\n\nAll this was said, be it understood, in English; but, notwithstanding,\nit produced a slight emotion in the fisherman, which Monk, occupied with\nhis sergeant, did not remark.\n\n\"Who is the gentleman?\" asked Monk.\n\n\"My lord,\" replied Spithead, \"he told it me; but those devils of French\nnames are so difficult to pronounce for a Scottish throat, that I could\nnot retain it. I believe, however, from what the guards say, that it is\nthe same gentleman who presented himself yesterday at the halt, and whom\nyour honor would not receive.\"\n\n\"That is true; I was holding a council of officers.\"\n\n\"Will your honor give any orders respecting this gentleman?\"\n\n\"Yes, let him be brought here.\"\n\n\"Must we take any precautions?\"\n\n\"Such as what?\"\n\n\"Blinding his eyes, for instance?\"\n\n\"To what purpose? He can only see what I desire should be seen; that\nis to say, that I have around me eleven thousand brave men, who ask\nno better than to have their throats cut in honor of the parliament of\nScotland and England.\"\n\n\"And this man, my lord?\" said Spithead, pointing to the fisherman, who,\nduring this conversation, had remained standing and motionless, like a\nman who sees but does not understand.\n\n\"Ah, that is true,\" said Monk. Then turning towards the fisherman,--\"I\nshall see you again, my brave fellow,\" said he; \"I have selected a\nlodging for you. Digby, take him to it. Fear nothing; your money shall\nbe sent to you presently.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord,\" said the fisherman, and after having bowed, he\nleft the tent, accompanied by Digby. Before he had gone a hundred paces\nhe found his companions, who were whispering with a volubility which did\nnot appear exempt from uneasiness, but he made them a sign which seemed\nto reassure them. \"_Hola_, you fellows!\" said the _patron_, \"come this\nway. His lordship, General Monk, has the generosity to pay us for our\nfish, and the goodness to give us hospitality for to-night.\"\n\nThe fishermen gathered round their leader, and, conducted by Digby,\nthe little troop proceeded towards the canteens, the post, as may be\nremembered, which had been assigned them. As they went along in the\ndark, the fishermen passed close to the guards who were conducting the\nFrench gentleman to General Monk. This gentleman was on horseback and\nenveloped in a large cloak, which prevented the _patron_ from seeing\nhim, however great his curiosity might be. As to the gentleman, ignorant\nthat he was elbowing compatriots, he did not pay any attention to the\nlittle troop.\n\nThe aid-de-camp settled his guests in a tolerably comfortable tent,\nfrom which was dislodged an Irish canteen woman, who went, with her six\nchildren, to sleep where she could. A large fire was burning in front\nof this tent, and threw its purple light over the grassy pools of the\nmarsh, rippled by a fresh breeze. The arrangements made, the aid-de-camp\nwished the fishermen good-night, calling to their notice that they might\nsee from the door of the tent the masts of their bark, which was tossing\ngently on the Tweed, a proof that it had not yet sunk. The sight of this\nappeared to delight the leader of the fishermen infinitely.\n\n\n\nChapter XXIV. The Treasure.\n\nThe French gentleman whom Spithead had announced to Monk, and who,\nclosely wrapped in his cloak, had passed by the fishermen who left the\ngeneral's tent five minutes before he entered it,--the French gentleman\nwent through the various posts without even casting his eyes around him,\nfor fear of appearing indiscreet. As the order had been given, he was\nconducted to the tent of the general. The gentleman was left alone in\nthe sort of ante-chamber in front of the principal body of the tent,\nwhere he awaited Monk, who only delayed till he had heard the report\nof his people, and observed through the opening of the canvas the\ncountenance of the person who solicited an audience.\n\nWithout doubt, the report of those who had accompanied the French\ngentleman established the discretion with which he had behaved, for the\nfirst impression the stranger received of the welcome made him by the\ngeneral was more favorable than he could have expected at such a moment,\nand on the part of so suspicious a man. Nevertheless, according to his\ncustom, when Monk found himself in the presence of a stranger, he fixed\nupon him his penetrating eyes, which scrutiny, the stranger, on his\npart, sustained without embarrassment or notice. At the end of a few\nseconds, the general made a gesture with his hand and head in sign of\nattention.\n\n\"My lord,\" said the gentleman, in excellent English, \"I have requested\nan interview with your honor, for an affair of importance.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied Monk, in French, \"you speak our language well for a\nson of the continent. I ask your pardon--for doubtless the question is\nindiscreet--do you speak French with the same purity?\"\n\n\"There is nothing surprising, my lord, in my speaking English tolerably;\nI resided for some time in England in my youth, and since then I have\nmade two voyages to this country.\" These words were spoken in French,\nand with a purity of accent that bespoke not only a Frenchman, but a\nFrenchman from the vicinity of Tours.\n\n\"And what part of England have you resided in, monsieur?\"\n\n\"In my youth, London, my lord; then, about 1635, I made a pleasure trip\nto Scotland; and lastly, in 1648, I lived for some time at Newcastle,\nparticularly in the convent, the gardens of which are now occupied by\nyour army.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, monsieur; but you must comprehend that these questions are\nnecessary on my part--do you not?\"\n\n\"It would astonish me, my lord, if they were not asked.\"\n\n\"Now, then, monsieur, what can I do to serve you? What do you wish?\"\n\n\"This, my lord;--but, in the first place, are we alone?\"\n\n\"Perfectly so, monsieur, except, of course, the post which guards us.\"\nSo saying, Monk pulled open the canvas with his hand, and pointed to the\nsoldier placed at ten paces from the tent, and who, at the first call,\ncould have rendered assistance in a second.\n\n\"In that case, my lord,\" said the gentleman, in as calm a tone as if\nhe had been for a length of time in habits of intimacy with his\ninterlocutor, \"I have made up my mind to address myself to you, because\nI believe you to be an honest man. Indeed, the communication I am about\nto make to you will prove to you the esteem in which I hold you.\"\n\nMonk, astonished at this language, which established between him and\nthe French gentleman equality at least, raised his piercing eye to the\nstranger's face, and with a sensible irony conveyed by the inflection\nof his voice alone, for not a muscle of his face moved,--\"I thank you,\nmonsieur,\" said he; \"but, in the first place, to whom have I the honor\nof speaking?\"\n\n\"I sent you my name by your sergeant, my lord.\"\n\n\"Excuse him, monsieur, he is a Scotsman,--he could not retain it.\"\n\n\"I am called the Comte de la Fere, monsieur,\" said Athos, bowing.\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere?\" said Monk, endeavoring to recollect the name.\n\"Pardon me, monsieur, but this appears to be the first time I have ever\nheard that name. Do you fill any post at the court of France?\"\n\n\"None; I am a simple gentleman.\"\n\n\"What dignity?\"\n\n\"King Charles I. made me a knight of the Garter, and Queen Anne of\nAustria has given me the cordon of the Holy Ghost. These are my only\ndignities.\"\n\n\"The Garter! the Holy Ghost! Are you a knight of those two orders,\nmonsieur?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And on what occasions have such favors been bestowed upon you?\"\n\n\"For services rendered to their majesties.\"\n\nMonk looked with astonishment at this man, who appeared to him so simple\nand so great at the same time. Then, as if he had renounced endeavoring\nto penetrate this mystery of a simplicity and grandeur upon which the\nstranger did not seem disposed to give him any other information than\nthat which he had already received,--\"Did you present yourself yesterday\nat our advanced posts?\"\n\n\"And was sent back? Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Many officers, monsieur, would permit no one to enter their camp,\nparticularly on the eve of a probable battle. But I differ from my\ncolleagues, and like to leave nothing behind me. Every advice is good to\nme; all danger is sent to me by God, and I weigh it in my hand with\nthe energy He has given me. So, yesterday, you were only sent back on\naccount of the council I was holding. To-day I am at liberty,--speak.\"\n\n\"My lord, you have done much better in receiving me, for what I have\nto say has nothing to do with the battle you are about to fight with\nGeneral Lambert, or with your camp; and the proof is, that I turned away\nmy head that I might not see your men, and closed my eyes that I might\nnot count your tents. No, I came to speak to you, my lord, on my own\naccount.\"\n\n\"Speak then, monsieur,\" said Monk.\n\n\"Just now,\" continued Athos, \"I had the honor of telling your lordship\nthat for a long time I lived in Newcastle; it was in the time of Charles\nI., and when the king was given up to Cromwell by the Scots.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Monk, coldly.\n\n\"I had at that time a large sum in gold, and on the eve of the battle,\nfrom a presentiment perhaps of the turn which things would take on\nthe morrow, I concealed it in the principal vault of the covenant\nof Newcastle, in the tower whose summit you now see silvered by the\nmoonbeams. My treasure has then remained interred there, and I have come\nto entreat your honor to permit me to withdraw it before, perhaps, the\nbattle turning that way, a mine or some other war engine has destroyed\nthe building and scattered my gold, or rendered it so apparent that the\nsoldiers will take possession of it.\"\n\nMonk was well acquainted with mankind; he saw in the physiognomy of\nthis gentleman all the energy, all the reason, all the circumspection\npossible; he could therefore only attribute to a magnanimous confidence\nthe revelation the Frenchman had made him, and he showed himself\nprofoundly touched by it.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said he, \"you have augured well of me. But is the sum worth\nthe trouble to which you expose yourself? Do you even believe that it\ncan be in the same place where you left it?\"\n\n\"It is there monsieur, I do not doubt.\"\n\n\"That is a reply to one question; but to the other. I asked you if the\nsum was so large as to warrant your exposing yourself thus.\"\n\n\"It is really large; yes, my lord, for it is a million I inclosed in two\nbarrels.\"\n\n\"A million!\" cried Monk, at whom this time, in turn, Athos looked\nearnestly and long. Monk perceived this, and his mistrust returned.\n\n\"Here is a man,\" said he to himself, \"who is laying a snare for me.\nSo you wish to withdraw this money, monsieur,\" replied he, \"as I\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"If you please, my lord.\"\n\n\"To-day?\"\n\n\"This very evening, and that on account of the circumstances I have\nnamed.\"\n\n\"But, monsieur,\" objected Monk, \"General Lambert is as near the abbey\nwhere you have to act as I am. Why, then, have you not addressed\nyourself to him?\"\n\n\"Because, my lord, when one acts in important matters, it is best to\nconsult one's instinct before everything. Well, General Lambert does not\ninspire with me so much confidence as you do.\"\n\n\"Be it so, monsieur. I shall assist you in recovering your money, if,\nhowever, it can still be there; for that is far from likely. Since 1648\ntwelve years have rolled away, and many events have taken place.\" Monk\ndwelt upon this point to see if the French gentleman would seize the\nevasions that were open to him, but Athos did not hesitate.\n\n\"I assure you, my lord,\" he said firmly, \"that my conviction is, that\nthe two barrels have neither changed place nor master.\" This reply\nhad removed one suspicion from the mind of Monk, but it had suggested\nanother. Without doubt this Frenchman was some emissary sent to entice\ninto error the protector of the parliament; the gold was nothing but a\nlure; and by the help of this lure they thought to excite the cupidity\nof the general. This gold might not exist. It was Monk's business, then,\nto seize the Frenchman in the act of falsehood and trick, and to draw\nfrom the false step itself in which his enemies wished to entrap him, a\ntriumph for his renown. When Monk was determined how to act,--\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said he to Athos, \"without doubt you will do me the honor to\nshare my supper this evening?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Athos, bowing; \"for you do me an honor of which\nI feel myself worthy, by the inclination which drew me towards you.\"\n\n\"It is so much the more gracious on your part to accept my invitation\nwith such frankness, as my cooks are but few and inexperienced, and my\nproviders have returned this evening empty-handed; so that if it had not\nbeen for a fisherman of your nation who strayed into our camp, General\nMonk would have gone to bed without his supper to-day; I have, then,\nsome fresh fish to offer you, as the vendor assures me.\"\n\n\"My lord, it is principally for the sake of having the honor to pass an\nhour with you.\"\n\nAfter this exchange of civilities, during which Monk had lost nothing of\nhis circumspection, the supper, or what was to serve for one, had been\nlaid upon a deal table. Monk invited the Comte de la Fere to be seated\nat this table, and took his place opposite to him. A single dish of\nboiled fish, set before the two illustrious guests, was more tempting to\nhungry stomachs than to delicate palates.\n\nWhilst supping, that is, while eating the fish, washed down with bad\nale, Monk got Athos to relate to him the last events of the Fronde, the\nreconciliation of M. de Conde with the king, and the probable marriage\nof the infanta of Spain; but he avoided, as Athos himself avoided it,\nall allusion to the political interests which united, or rather which\ndisunited at this time, England, France and Holland.\n\nMonk, in this conversation, convinced himself of one thing, which he\nmust have remarked after the first words exchanged: that was, that he\nhad to deal with a man of high distinction. He could not be an assassin,\nand it was repugnant to Monk to believe him to be a spy; but there was\nsufficient _finesse_ and at the same time firmness in Athos to lead Monk\nto fancy he was a conspirator. When they had quitted the table, \"You\nstill believe in your treasure, then, monsieur?\" asked Monk.\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Quite seriously?\"\n\n\"Seriously.\"\n\n\"And you think you can find the place again where it was buried?\"\n\n\"At the first inspection.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, from curiosity I shall accompany you. And it is so\nmuch the more necessary that I should accompany you, that you would find\ngreat difficulties in passing through the camp without me or one of my\nlieutenants.\"\n\n\"General, I would not suffer you to inconvenience yourself if I did not,\nin fact, stand in need of your company; but as I recognize that this\ncompany is not only honorable, but necessary, I accept it.\"\n\n\"Do you desire we should take any people with us?\" asked Monk.\n\n\"General, I believe that would be useless, if you yourself do not see\nthe necessity for it. Two men and a horse will suffice to transport the\ntwo casks on board the felucca which brought me hither.\"\n\n\"But it will be necessary to pick, dig, and remove the earth, and split\nstones; you don't intend doing this work yourself, monsieur, do you?\"\n\n\"General, there is no picking or digging required. The treasure is\nburied in the sepulchral vault of the convent, under a stone in which\nis fixed a large iron ring, and under which there are four steps leading\ndown. The two casks are there, placed end to end, covered with a coat of\nplaster in the form of a bier. There is, besides, an inscription, which\nwill enable me to recognize the stone; and as I am not willing, in an\naffair of delicacy and confidence, to keep the secret from your honor,\nhere is the inscription:--'_Hic jacet venerabilis, Petrus Gulielmus\nScott, Canon Honorab. Conventus Novi Castelli. Obiit quarta et decima\nFeb. ann. Dom. MCCVIII. Requiescat in pace._'\"\n\nMonk did not lose a single word. He was astonished either at the\nmarvelous duplicity of this man and the superior style in which he\nplayed his part, or at the good loyal faith with which he presented his\nrequest, in a situation in which concerning a million of money, risked\nagainst the blow from a dagger, amidst an army that would have looked\nupon the theft as a restitution.\n\n\"Very well,\" said he; \"I shall accompany you; and the adventure appears\nto me so wonderful, that I shall carry the torch myself.\" And saying\nthese words, he girded on a short sword, placed a pistol in his belt,\ndisclosing in this movement, which opened his doublet a little, the\nfine rings of a coat of mail, destined to protect him from the first\ndagger-thrust of an assassin. After which he took a Scottish dirk in his\nleft hand, and then turning to Athos, \"Are you ready, monsieur?\" said\nhe.\n\n\"I am.\"\n\nAthos, as if in opposition to what Monk had done, unfastened his\nponiard, which he placed upon the table; unhooked his sword-belt, which\nhe laid close to his poniard; and, without affectation, opening his\ndoublet as if to look for his handkerchief, showed beneath his fine\ncambric shirt his naked breast, without weapons either offensive or\ndefensive.\n\n\"This is truly a singular man,\" said Monk; \"he is without any arms; he\nhas an ambuscade placed somewhere yonder.\"\n\n\"General,\" said he, as if he had divined Monk's thought, \"you wish we\nshould be alone; that is very right, but a great captain ought never to\nexpose himself with temerity. It is night, the passage of the marsh may\npresent dangers; be accompanied.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" replied he, calling Digby. The aid-de-camp appeared.\n\"Fifty men with swords and muskets,\" said he, looking at Athos.\n\n\"That is too few if there is danger, too many if there is not.\"\n\n\"I will go alone,\" said Monk; \"I want nobody. Come, monsieur.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XXV. The Marsh.\n\nAthos and Monk passed over, in going from the camp towards the Tweed,\nthat part of the ground which Digby had traversed with the fishermen\ncoming from the Tweed to the camp. The aspect of this place, the aspect\nof the changes man had wrought in it, was of a nature to produce a great\neffect upon a lively and delicate imagination like that of Athos. Athos\nlooked at nothing but these desolate spots; Monk looked at nothing but\nAthos--at Athos, who, with his eyes sometimes directed towards heaven,\nand sometimes towards the earth, sought, thought, and sighed.\n\nDigby, whom the last orders of the general, and particularly the accent\nwith which he had given them, had at first a little excited, Digby\nfollowed the pair at about twenty paces, but the general having turned\nround as if astonished to find his orders had not been obeyed, the\naid-de-camp perceived his indiscretion, and returned to his tent.\n\nHe supposed that the general wished to make, incognito, one of those\nreviews of vigilance which every experienced captain never fails to\nmake on the eve of a decisive engagement: he explained to himself the\npresence of Athos in this case as an inferior explains all that is\nmysterious on the part of his leader. Athos might be, and, indeed, in\nthe eyes of Digby, must be, a spy, whose information was to enlighten\nthe general.\n\nAt the end of a walk of about ten minutes among the tents and posts,\nwhich were closer together near the headquarters, Monk entered upon a\nlittle causeway which diverged into three branches. That on the left led\nto the river, that in the middle to Newcastle Abbey on the marsh, that\non the right crossed the first lines of Monk's camp; that is to say, the\nlines nearest to Lambert's army. Beyond the river was an advanced post,\nbelonging to Monk's army, which watched the enemy; it was composed of\none hundred and fifty Scots. They had swum across the Tweed, and, in\ncase of attack, were to recross it in the same manner, giving the alarm;\nbut as there was no post at that spot, and as Lambert's soldiers were\nnot so prompt at taking to the water as Monk's were, the latter appeared\nnot to have as much uneasiness on that side. On this side of the river,\nat about five hundred paces from the old abbey, the fishermen had taken\nup their abode amidst a crowd of small tents raised by soldiers of the\nneighboring clans, who had with them their wives and children. All this\nconfusion, seen by the moon's light, presented a striking _coup d'oeil_;\nthe half shadow enlarged every detail, and the light, that flatterer\nwhich only attaches itself to the polished side of things, courted upon\neach rusty musket the point still left intact, and upon every rag of\ncanvas the whitest and least sullied part.\n\nMonk arrived then with Athos, crossing this spot, illumined with a\ndouble light, the silver splendor of the moon, and the red blaze of the\nfires at the meeting of these three causeways; there he stopped, and\naddressing his companion,--\"Monsieur,\" said he, \"do you know your road?\"\n\n\"General, if I am not mistaken, the middle causeway leads straight to\nthe abbey.\"\n\n\"That is right; but we shall want lights to guide us in the vaults.\"\nMonk turned round.\n\n\"Ah! I thought Digby was following us!\" said he. \"So much the better; he\nwill procure us what we want.\"\n\n\"Yes, general, there is a man yonder who has been walking behind us for\nsome time.\"\n\n\"Digby!\" cried Monk. \"Digby! come here, if you please.\"\n\nBut instead of obeying, the shadow made a motion of surprise, and,\nretreating instead of advancing, it bent down and disappeared along\nthe jetty on the left, directing its course towards the lodging of the\nfishermen.\n\n\"It appears not to be Digby,\" said Monk.\n\nBoth had followed the shadow which had vanished. But it was not so rare\na thing for a man to be wandering about at eleven o'clock at night, in\na camp in which are reposing ten or eleven thousand men, as to give Monk\nand Athos any alarm at his disappearance.\n\n\"As it is so,\" said Monk, \"and we must have a light, a lantern, a torch,\nor something by which we may see where to see our feet; let us seek this\nlight.\"\n\n\"General, the first soldier we meet will light us.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Monk, in order to discover if there were not any connivance\nbetween the Comte de la Fere and the fisherman. \"No, I should prefer\none of these French sailors who came this evening to sell me their\nfish. They leave to-morrow, and the secret will be better kept by\nthem; whereas, if a report should be spread in the Scottish army, that\ntreasures are to be found in the abbey of Newcastle, my Highlanders will\nbelieve there is a million concealed beneath every slab, and they will\nnot leave stone upon stone in the building.\"\n\n\"Do as you think best, general,\" replied Athos, in a natural tone of\nvoice, making evident that soldier or fisherman was the same to him, and\nthat he had no preference.\n\nMonk approached the causeway behind which had disappeared the person he\nhad taken for Digby, and met a patrol who, making the tour of the tents,\nwas going towards headquarters; he was stopped with his companion, gave\nthe password, and went on. A soldier, roused by the noise, unrolled his\nplaid, and looked up to see what was going forward. \"Ask him,\" said Monk\nto Athos, \"where the fishermen are; if I were to speak to him, he would\nknow me.\"\n\nAthos went up to the soldier, who pointed out the tent to him;\nimmediately Monk and Athos turned towards it. It appeared to the general\nthat at the moment they came up, a shadow like that they had already\nseen, glided into this tent; but on drawing nearer he perceived he must\nhave been mistaken, for all of them were asleep _pele mele_, and nothing\nwas seen but arms and legs joined, crossed, and mixed. Athos, fearing\nlest he should be suspected of connivance with some of his compatriots,\nremained outside the tent.\n\n\"_Hola!_\" said Monk, in French, \"wake up here.\" Two or three of the\nsleepers got up.\n\n\"I want a man to light me,\" continued Monk.\n\n\"Your honor may depend on us,\" said a voice which made Athos start.\n\"Where do you wish us to go?\"\n\n\"You shall see. A light! come, quickly!\"\n\n\"Yes, your honor. Does it please your honor that I should accompany\nyou?\"\n\n\"You or another; it is of very little consequence, provided I have a\nlight.\"\n\n\"It is strange!\" thought Athos; \"what a singular voice that man has!\"\n\n\"Some fire, you fellows!\" cried the fisherman; \"come, make haste!\"\n\nThen addressing his companion nearest to him in a low voice:--\"Get ready\na light, Menneville,\" said he, \"and hold yourself ready for anything.\"\n\nOne of the fishermen struck light from a stone, set fire to some tinder,\nand by the aid of a match lit a lantern. The light immediately spread\nall over the tent.\n\n\"Are you ready, monsieur?\" said Monk to Athos, who had turned away, not\nto expose his face to the light.\n\n\"Yes, general,\" replied he.\n\n\"Ah! the French gentleman!\" said the leader of the fishermen to himself.\n\"_Peste!_ I have a great mind to charge you with the commission,\nMenneville; he may know me. Light! light!\" This dialogue was pronounced\nat the back of the tent, and in so low a voice that Monk could not hear\na syllable of it; he was, besides, talking with Athos. Menneville got\nhimself ready in the meantime, or rather received the orders of his\nleader.\n\n\"Well?\" said Monk.\n\n\"I am ready, general,\" said the fisherman.\n\nMonk, Athos, and the fisherman left the tent.\n\n\"It is impossible!\" thought Athos. \"What dream could put that into my\nhead?\"\n\n\"Go forward; follow the middle causeway, and stretch out your legs,\"\nsaid Monk to the fisherman.\n\nThey were not twenty paces on their way when the same shadow that had\nappeared to enter the tent came out of it again, crawled along as far\nas the piles, and, protected by that sort of parapet placed along\nthe causeway, carefully observed the march of the general. All three\ndisappeared in the night haze. They were walking towards Newcastle, the\nwhite stones of which appeared to them like sepulchers. After standing\nfor a few seconds under the porch, they penetrated into the interior.\nThe door had been broken open by hatchets. A post of four men slept in\nsafety in a corner, so certain were they that the attack would not take\nplace on that side.\n\n\"Will not these men be in your way?\" said Monk to Athos.\n\n\"On the contrary, monsieur, they will assist in rolling out the barrels,\nif your honor will permit them.\"\n\n\n\"You are right.\"\n\nThe post, though fast asleep, roused up at the first steps of the three\nvisitors amongst the briars and grass that invaded the porch. Monk gave\nthe password, and penetrated into the interior of the convent, preceded\nby the light. He walked last, watching the least movement of Athos, his\nnaked dirk in his sleeve, and ready to plunge it into the back of the\ngentleman at the first suspicious gesture he should see him make. But\nAthos, with a firm and sure step, crossed the chambers and courts.\n\nNot a door, not a window was left in the building. The doors had been\nburnt, some on the spot, and the charcoal of them was still jagged with\nthe action of the fire, which had gone out of itself, powerless, no\ndoubt, to get to the heart of those massive joints of oak fastened\ntogether with iron nails. As to the windows, all the panes having been\nbroken, night birds, alarmed by the torch, flew away through their\nholes. At the same time, gigantic bats began to trace their vast, silent\ncircles around the intruders, whilst the light of the torch made their\nshadows tremble on the high stone walls. Monk concluded that there could\nbe no man in the convent, since wild beasts and birds were there still,\nand fled away at his approach.\n\nAfter having passed the rubbish, and torn away more than one branch of\nivy that had made itself a guardian of the solitude, Athos arrived at\nthe vaults situated beneath the great hall, but the entrance of which\nwas from the chapel. There he stopped. \"Here we are, general,\" said he.\n\n\"This, then, is the slab?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ay, and here is the ring--but the ring is sealed into the stone.\"\n\n\"We must have a lever.\"\n\n\"That's a very easy thing to find.\"\n\nWhilst looking around them, Athos and Monk perceived a little ash of\nabout three inches in diameter, which had shot up in an angle of the\nwall, reaching a window, concealed by its branches.\n\n\"Have you a knife?\" said Monk to the fisherman.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Cut down this tree, then.\"\n\nThe fisherman obeyed, but not without notching his cutlass. When the\nash was cut and fashioned into the shape of a lever, the three men\npenetrated into the vault.\n\n\"Stop where you are,\" said Monk to the fisherman. \"We are going to dig\nup some powder; your light may be dangerous.\"\n\nThe man drew back in a sort of terror, and faithfully kept to the post\nassigned him, whilst Monk and Athos turned behind a column at the foot\nof which, penetrating through a crack, was a moonbeam, reflected exactly\non the stone which the Comte de la Fere had come so far in search.\n\n\"This is it,\" said Athos, pointing out to the general the Latin\ninscription.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Monk.\n\nThen, as if still willing to leave the Frenchman one means of evasion,--\n\n\"Do you not observe that this vault has already been broken into,\"\ncontinued he, \"and that several statues have already been knocked down?\"\n\n\"My lord, you have, without doubt, heard that the religious respect\nof your Scots loves to confide to the statues of the dead the valuable\nobjects they have possessed during their lives. Therefore, the soldiers\nhad reason to think that under the pedestals of the statues which\nornament most of these tombs, a treasure was hidden. They have\nconsequently broken down pedestal and statue: but the tomb of the\nvenerable cannon, with which we have to do, is not distinguished by\nany monument. It is simple, therefore it has been protected by the\nsuperstitious fear which your Puritans have always had of sacrilege. Not\na morsel of the masonry of this tomb has been chipped off.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Monk.\n\nAthos seized the lever.\n\n\"Shall I help you?\" said Monk.\n\n\"Thank you, my lord; but I am not willing that your honor should\nlend your hand to a work of which, perhaps, you would not take the\nresponsibility if you knew the probable consequences of it.\"\n\nMonk raised his head.\n\n\"What do you mean by that, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I mean--but that man--\"\n\n\"Stop,\" said Monk; \"I perceive what you are afraid of. I shall make a\ntrial.\" Monk turned towards the fisherman, the whole of whose profile\nwas thrown upon the wall.\n\n\"Come here, friend!\" said he in English, and in a tone of command.\n\nThe fisherman did not stir.\n\n\"That is well,\" continued he: \"he does not know English. Speak to me,\nthen, in English, if you please, monsieur.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied Athos, \"I have frequently seen men in certain\ncircumstances have sufficient command over themselves not to reply to\na question put to them in a language they understood. The fisherman is\nperhaps more learned than we believe him to be. Send him away, my lord,\nI beg you.\"\n\n\"Decidedly,\" said Monk, \"he wishes to have me alone in this vault. Never\nmind, we shall go through with it; one man is as good as another man;\nand we are alone. My friend,\" said Monk to the fisherman, \"go back\nup the stairs we have just descended, and watch that nobody comes to\ndisturb us.\" The fisherman made a sign of obedience. \"Leave your torch,\"\nsaid Monk; \"it would betray your presence, and might procure you a\nmusket-ball.\"\n\nThe fisherman appeared to appreciate the counsel; he laid down the\nlight, and disappeared under the vault of the stairs. Monk took up the\ntorch, and brought it to the foot of the column.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said he; \"money, then, is concealed under this tomb?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; and in five minutes you will no longer doubt it.\"\n\nAt the same time Athos struck a violent blow upon the plaster, which\nsplit, presenting a chink for the point of the lever. Athos introduced\nthe bar into this crack, and soon large pieces of plaster yielded,\nrising up like rounded slabs. Then the Comte de la Fere seized the\nstones and threw them away with a force that hands so delicate as his\nmight not have been supposed capable of having.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Athos, \"this is plainly the masonry of which I told your\nhonor.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I do not yet see the casks,\" said Monk.\n\n\"If I had a dagger,\" said Athos, looking round him, \"you should soon see\nthem, monsieur. Unfortunately, I left mine in your tent.\"\n\n\"I would willingly offer you mine,\" said Monk, \"but the blade is too\nthin for such work.\"\n\nAthos appeared to look around him for a thing of some kind that might\nserve as a substitute for the weapon he desired. Monk did not lose one\nof the movements of his hands, or one of the expressions of his eyes.\n\"Why do you not ask the fisherman for his cutlass?\" said Monk; \"he has a\ncutlass.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is true,\" said Athos; \"for he cut the tree down with it.\" And\nhe advanced towards the stairs.\n\n\"Friend,\" said he to the fisherman, \"throw me down your cutlass, if you\nplease; I want it.\"\n\nThe noise of the falling weapon sounded on the steps.\n\n\"Take it,\" said Monk; \"it is a solid instrument, as I have seen, and a\nstrong hand might make good use of it.\"\n\nAthos appeared only to give to the words of Monk the natural and simple\nsense under which they were to be heard and understood. Nor did he\nremark, or at least appear to remark, that when he returned with the\nweapon, Monk drew back, placing his left hand on the stock of his\npistol; in the right he already held his dirk. He went to work then,\nturning his back to Monk, placing his life in his hands, without\npossible defense. He then struck, during several seconds, so skillfully\nand sharply upon the intermediary plaster, that it separated into two\nparts, and Monk was able to discern two barrels placed end to end, and\nwhich their weight maintained motionless in their chalky envelope.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Athos, \"you see that my presentiments have not been\ndisappointed.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said Monk, \"and I have good reason to believe you are\nsatisfied; are you not?\"\n\n\"Doubtless I am; the loss of this money would have been inexpressibly\ngreat to me: but I was certain that God, who protects the good cause,\nwould not have permitted this gold, which should procure its triumph, to\nbe diverted to baser purposes.\n\n\"You are, upon my honor, as mysterious in your words as in your actions,\nmonsieur,\" said Monk. \"Just now as I did not perfectly understand\nyou when you said that you were not willing to throw upon me the\nresponsibility of the work we were accomplishing.\"\n\n\"I had reason to say so, my lord.\"\n\n\"And now you speak to me of the good cause. What do you mean by the\nwords 'the good cause?' We are defending at this moment, in England,\nfive or six causes, which does not prevent every one from considering\nhis own not only as the good cause, but as the best. What is yours,\nmonsieur? Speak boldly, that we may see if, upon this point, to which\nyou appear to attach a great importance, we are of the same opinion.\"\n\nAthos fixed upon Monk one of those penetrating looks which seemed to\nconvey to him to whom they are directed a challenge to conceal a single\none of his thoughts; then, taking off his hat, he began in a solemn\nvoice, while his interlocutor, with one hand upon his visage, allowed\nthat long and nervous hand to compress his mustache and beard, while his\nvague and melancholy eye wandered about the recesses of the vaults.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVI. Heart and Mind.\n\n\"My lord,\" said the Comte de la Fere, \"you are an noble Englishman,\nyou are a loyal man; you are speaking to a noble Frenchman, to a man of\nheart. The gold contained in these two casks before us, I have told you\nwas mine. I was wrong--it is the first lie I have pronounced in my life,\na temporary lie, it is true. This gold is the property of King Charles\nII., exiled from his country, driven from his palaces, the orphan at\nonce of his father and his throne, and deprived of everything, even of\nthe melancholy happiness of kissing on his knees the stone upon which\nthe hands of his murderers have written that simple epitaph which will\neternally cry out for vengeance upon them:--'HERE LIES CHARLES I.'\"\n\nMonk grew slightly pale, and an imperceptible shudder crept over his\nskin and raised his gray mustache.\n\n\"I,\" continued Athos, \"I, Comte de la Fere, the last, only faithful\nfriend the poor abandoned prince has left, I have offered him to come\nhither to find the man upon whom now depends the fate of royalty and of\nEngland; and I have come, and placed myself under the eye of this man,\nand have placed myself naked and unarmed in his hands, saying:--'My\nlord, here are the last resources of a prince whom God made your master,\nwhom his birth made your king; upon you, and you alone, depend his life\nand future. Will you employ this money in consoling England for the\nevils it must have suffered from anarchy; that is to say, will you aid,\nand if not aid, will you allow King Charles II. to act? You are master,\nyou are king, all-powerful master and king, for chance sometimes defeats\nthe work of time and God. I am here alone with you, my lord: if divided\nsuccess alarms you, if my complicity annoys you, you are armed, my lord,\nand here is a grave ready dug; if, on the contrary, the enthusiasm of\nyour cause carries you away, if you are what you appear to be, if your\nhand in what it undertakes obeys your mind, and your mind your heart,\nhere are the means of ruining forever the cause of your enemy, Charles\nStuart. Kill, then, the man you have before you, for that man will never\nreturn to him who has sent him without bearing with him the deposit\nwhich Charles I., his father, confided to him, and keep the gold which\nmay assist in carrying on the civil war. Alas! my lord, it is the\nfate of this unfortunate prince. He must either corrupt or kill, for\neverything resists him, everything repulses him, everything is hostile\nto him; and yet he is marked with divine seal, and he must, not to\nbelie his blood, reascend the throne, or die upon the sacred soil of his\ncountry.'\n\n\"My lord, you have heard me. To any other but the illustrious man who\nlistens to me, I would have said: 'My lord, you are poor; my lord, the\nking offers you this million as an earnest of an immense bargain; take\nit, and serve Charles II. as I served Charles I., and I feel assured\nthat God, who listens to us, who sees us, who alone reads in your heart,\nshut up from all human eyes,--I am assured God will give you a happy\neternal life after death.' But to General Monk, to the illustrious man\nof whose standard I believe I have taken measure, I say: 'My lord, there\nis for you in the history of peoples and kings a brilliant place, an\nimmortal, imperishable glory, if alone, without any other interest but\nthe good of your country and the interests of justice, you become the\nsupporter of your king. Many others have been conquerors and glorious\nusurpers; you, my lord, you will be content with being the most\nvirtuous, the most honest, and the most incorruptible of men: you will\nhave held a crown in your hand, and instead of placing it upon your own\nbrow, you will have deposited it upon the head of him for whom it was\nmade. Oh, my lord, act thus, and you will leave to posterity the most\nenviable of names, in which no human creature can rival you.'\"\n\nAthos stopped. During the whole time that the noble gentleman was\nspeaking, Monk had not given one sign of either approbation or\ndisapprobation; scarcely even, during this vehement appeal, had his eyes\nbeen animated with that fire which bespeaks intelligence. The Comte\nde la Fere looked at him sorrowfully, and on seeing that melancholy\ncountenance, felt discouragement penetrate to his very heart. At length\nMonk appeared to recover, and broke the silence.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said he, in a mild, calm tone, \"in reply to you, I will\nmake use of your own words. To any other but yourself I would reply by\nexpulsion, imprisonment, or still worse, for, in fact, you tempt me and\nyou force me at the same time. But you are one of those men, monsieur,\nto whom it is impossible to refuse the attention and respect they merit;\nyou are a brave gentleman, monsieur--I say so, and I am a judge. You\njust now spoke of a deposit which the late king transmitted through you\nto his son--are you, then, one of those Frenchmen who, as I have heard,\nendeavored to carry off Charles I. from Whitehall?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; it was I who was beneath the scaffold during the\nexecution; I, who had not been able to redeem it, received upon my brow\nthe blood of the martyred king. I received, at the same time, the last\nword of Charles I.; it was to me he said, 'REMEMBER!' and in saying,\n'Remember!' he alluded to the money at your feet, my lord.\"\n\n\"I have heard much of you, monsieur,\" said Monk, \"but I am happy to\nhave, in the first place, appreciated you by my own observations, and\nnot by my remembrances. I will give you, then, explanations that I have\ngiven to no other, and you will appreciate what a distinction I make\nbetween you and the persons who have hitherto been sent to me.\"\n\nAthos bowed and prepared to absorb greedily the words which fell, one by\none, from the mouth of Monk,--those words rare and precious as the dew\nin the desert.\n\n\"You spoke to me,\" said Monk, \"of Charles II.; but pray, monsieur, of\nwhat consequence to me is that phantom of a king? I have grown old in a\nwar and in a policy which are nowadays so closely linked together,\nthat every man of the sword must fight in virtue of his rights or his\nambition with a personal interest, and not blindly behind an officer, as\nin ordinary wars. For myself, I perhaps desire nothing, but I fear much.\nIn the war of to-day rests the liberty of England, and, perhaps, that of\nevery Englishman. How can you expect that I, free in the position I\nhave made for myself, should go willingly and hold out my hands to the\nshackles of a stranger? That is all Charles is to me. He has fought\nbattles here which he has lost, he is therefore a bad captain; he has\nsucceeded in no negotiation, he is therefore a bad diplomatist; he has\nparaded his wants and his miseries in all the courts of Europe, he has\ntherefore a weak and pusillanimous heart. Nothing noble, nothing great,\nnothing strong has hitherto emanated from that genius which aspires to\ngovern one of the greatest kingdoms of the earth. I know this Charles,\nthen, under none but bad aspects, and you would wish me, a man of good\nsense, to go and make myself gratuitously the slave of a creature who\nis inferior to me in military capacity, in politics, and in dignity! No,\nmonsieur. When some great and noble action shall have taught me to value\nCharles, I shall perhaps recognize his rights to a throne from which we\ncast the father because he wanted the virtues which his son has hitherto\nlacked, but, in fact of rights, I only recognize my own; the revolution\nmade me a general, my sword will make me protector, if I wish it.\nLet Charles show himself, let him present himself, let him enter the\ncompetition open to genius, and, above all, let him remember that he\nis of a race from whom more will be expected than from any other.\nTherefore, monsieur, say no more about him. I neither refuse nor accept:\nI reserve myself--I wait.\"\n\nAthos knew Monk to be too well informed of all concerning Charles to\nventure to urge the discussion further; it was neither the time nor the\nplace. \"My lord,\" then said he, \"I have nothing to do but thank you.\"\n\n\"And why, monsieur? Because you have formed a correct opinion of me,\nor because I have acted according to your judgment? Is that, in truth,\nworthy of thanks? This gold which you are about to carry to Charles\nwill serve me as a test for him, by seeing the use he will make of it. I\nshall have an opinion which now I have not.\"\n\n\"And yet does not your honor fear to compromise yourself by allowing\nsuch a sum to be carried away for the service of your enemy?\"\n\n\"My enemy, say you? Eh, monsieur, I have no enemies. I am in the service\nof the parliament, which orders me to fight General Lambert and Charles\nStuart--its enemies, and not mine. I fight them. If the parliament, on\nthe contrary, ordered me to unfurl my standards on the port of London,\nand to assemble my soldiers on the banks to receive Charles II.--\"\n\n\"You would obey?\" cried Athos, joyfully.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said Monk, smiling, \"I was going on--I, a gray-headed\nman--in truth, how could I forget myself? was going to speak like a\nfoolish young man.\"\n\n\"Then you would not obey?\" said Athos.\n\n\"I do not say that either, monsieur. The welfare of my country before\neverything. God, who has given me the power, has, no doubt, willed that\nI should have that power for the good of all, and He has given me,\nat the same time, discernment. If the parliament were to order such a\nthing, I should reflect.\"\n\nThe brow of Athos became clouded. \"Then I may positively say that your\nhonor is not inclined to favor King Charles II.?\"\n\n\"You continue to question me, monsieur le comte; allow me to do so in\nturn, if you please.\"\n\n\"Do, monsieur; and may God inspire you with the idea of replying to me\nas frankly as I shall reply to you.\"\n\n\"When you shall have taken this money back to your prince, what advice\nwill you give him?\"\n\nAthos fixed upon Monk a proud and resolute look.\n\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"with this million, which others would perhaps\nemploy in negotiating, I would advise the king to rise two regiments, to\nenter Scotland, which you have just pacified: to give to the people the\nfranchises which the revolution promised them, and in which it has not,\nin all cases, kept its word. I should advise him to command in person\nthis little army, which would, believe me, increase, and to die,\nstandard in hand, and sword in sheath, saying, 'Englishmen! I am the\nthird king of my race you have killed; beware of the justice of God!'\"\n\nMonk hung down his head, and mused for an instant. \"If he succeeded,\"\nsaid he, \"which is very improbable, but not impossible--for everything\nis possible in this world--what would you advise him to do?\"\n\n\"To think that by the will of God he lost his crown, by the good will of\nmen he recovered it.\"\n\nAn ironical smile passed over the lips of Monk.\n\n\"Unfortunately, monsieur,\" said he, \"kings do not know how to follow\ngood advice.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord, Charles II. is not a king,\" replied Athos, smiling in his\nturn, but with a very different expression from Monk.\n\n\"Let us terminate this, monsieur le comte,--that is your desire, is it\nnot?\"\n\nAthos bowed.\n\n\"I shall give orders to have these two casks transported whither you\nplease. Where are you lodging, monsieur?\"\n\n\"In a little hamlet at the mouth of the river, your honor.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know the hamlet; it consists of five or six houses, does it not?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Well, I inhabit the first,--two net-makers occupy it with me;\nit is their bark which brought me ashore.\"\n\n\"But your own vessel, monsieur?\"\n\n\"My vessel is at anchor, a quarter of a mile at sea, and waits for me.\"\n\n\"You do not think, however, of setting out immediately?\"\n\n\"My lord, I shall try once more to convince your honor.\"\n\n\"You will not succeed,\" replied Monk; \"but it is of consequence that you\nshould depart from Newcastle without leaving of your passage the least\nsuspicion that might prove injurious to me or you. To-morrow my officers\nthink Lambert will attack me. I, on the contrary, am convinced he will\nnot stir; it is in my opinion impossible. Lambert leads an army devoid\nof homogeneous principles, and there is no possible army with such\nelements. I have taught my soldiers to consider my authority subordinate\nto another, therefore, after me, round me, and beneath me, they still\nlook for something. It would result that if I were dead, whatever might\nhappen, my army would not be demoralized all at once; it results, that\nif I choose to absent myself, for instance, as it does please me to do\nsometimes, there would not be in the camp the shadow of uneasiness or\ndisorder. I am the magnet--the sympathetic and natural strength of the\nEnglish. All those scattered irons that will be sent against me I shall\nattract to myself. Lambert, at this moment, commands eighteen thousand\ndeserters; but I have never mentioned that to my officers, you may\neasily suppose. Nothing is more useful to an army than the expectation\nof a coming battle; everybody is awake--everybody is on guard. I tell\nyou this that you may live in perfect security. Do not be in a hurry,\nthen, to cross the seas; within a week there will be something fresh,\neither a battle or an accommodation. Then, as you have judged me to be\nan honorable man, and confided your secret to me, I have to thank you\nfor this confidence, and I shall come and pay you a visit or send for\nyou. Do not go before I send word. I repeat the request.\"\n\n\"I promise you, general,\" cried Athos, with a joy so great, that in\nspite of all his circumspection, he could not prevent its sparkling in\nhis eyes.\n\nMonk surprised this flash, and immediately extinguished it by one of\nthose silent smiles which always caused his interlocutors to know they\nhad made no inroad on his mind.\n\n\"Then, my lord, it is a week that you desire me to wait?\"\n\n\"A week? yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"And during those days what shall I do?\"\n\n\"If there should be a battle, keep at a distance from it, I beseech you.\nI know the French delight in such amusements;--you might take a fancy to\nsee how we fight, and you might receive some chance shot. Our Scotsmen\nare very bad marksmen, and I do not wish that a worthy gentleman like\nyou should return to France wounded. Nor should I like to be obliged,\nmyself, to send to your prince his million left here by you; for then it\nwould be said, and with some reason, that I paid the Pretender to enable\nhim to make war against the parliament. Go, then, monsieur, and let it\nbe done as has been agreed upon.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord,\" said Athos, \"what joy it would give me to be the first\nthat penetrated to the noble heart which beats beneath that cloak!\"\n\n\"You think, then, that I have secrets,\" said Monk, without changing the\nhalf cheerful expression of his countenance. \"Why, monsieur, what\nsecret can you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier? But it is\ngetting late, and our torch is almost out; let us call our man.\"\n\n\"_Hola!_\" cried Monk in French, approaching the stairs; \"_hola!_\nfisherman!\"\n\nThe fisherman, benumbed by the cold night air, replied in a hoarse\nvoice, asking what they wanted of him.\n\n\"Go to the post,\" said Monk, \"and order a sergeant, in the name of\nGeneral Monk, to come here immediately.\"\n\nThis was a commission easily performed; for the sergeant, uneasy at the\ngeneral's being in that desolate abbey, had drawn nearer by degrees,\nand was not much further off than the fisherman. The general's order was\ntherefore heard by him, and he hastened to obey it.\n\n\"Get a horse and two men,\" said Monk.\n\n\"A horse and two men?\" repeated the sergeant.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Monk. \"Have you got any means of getting a horse with a\npack-saddle or two panniers?\"\n\n\"No doubt, at a hundred paces off, in the Scottish camp.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"What shall I do with the horse, general.\"\n\n\"Look here.\"\n\nThe sergeant descended the three steps which separated him from Monk,\nand came into the vault.\n\n\"You see,\" said Monk, \"that gentleman yonder?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, general.\"\n\n\"And you see these two casks?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"They are two casks, one containing powder, and the other balls; I wish\nthese casks to be transported to the little hamlet at the mouth of the\nriver, and which I intend to occupy to-morrow with two hundred muskets.\nYou understand that the commission is a secret one, for it is a movement\nthat may decide the fate of the battle.\"\n\n\"Oh, general!\" murmured the sergeant.\n\n\"Mind, then! Let these casks be fastened on to the horse, and let them\nbe escorted by two men and you to the residence of this gentleman, who\nis my friend. But take care that nobody knows it.\"\n\n\"I would go by the marsh if I knew the road,\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"I know one myself,\" said Athos; \"it is not wide, but it is solid,\nhaving been made upon piles; and with care we shall get over safely\nenough.\"\n\n\"Do everything this gentleman shall order you to do.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh! the casks are heavy,\" said the sergeant, trying to lift one.\n\n\"They weigh four hundred pounds each, if they contain what they ought to\ncontain, do they not, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Thereabouts,\" said Athos.\n\nThe sergeant went in search of the two men and the horse. Monk, left\nalone with Athos, affected to speak to him on nothing but indifferent\nsubjects while examining the vault in a cursory manner. Then, hearing\nthe horse's steps,--\n\n\"I leave you with your men, monsieur,\" said he, \"and return to the camp.\nYou are perfectly safe.\"\n\n\"I shall see you again, then, my lord?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"That is agreed upon, monsieur, and with much pleasure.\"\n\nMonk held out his hand to Athos.\n\n\"Ah! my lord, if you would!\" murmured Athos.\n\n\"Hush! monsieur, it is agreed that we shall speak no more of that.\" And\nbowing to Athos, he went up the stairs, meeting about half-way his men,\nwho were coming down. He had not gone twenty paces, when a faint but\nprolonged whistle was heard at a distance. Monk listened, but seeing\nnothing and hearing nothing, he continued his route. Then he remembered\nthe fisherman, and looked about for him; but the fisherman had\ndisappeared. If he had, however, looked with more attention, he might\nhave seen that man, bent double, gliding like a serpent along the stones\nand losing himself in the mist that floated over the surface of the\nmarsh. He might equally have seen, had he attempted to pierce that mist,\na spectacle that might have attracted his attention; and that was the\nrigging of the vessel, which had changed place, and was now nearer the\nshore. But Monk saw nothing; and thinking he had nothing to fear, he\nentered the deserted causeway which led to his camp. It was then that\nthe disappearance of the fisherman appeared strange, and that a real\nsuspicion began to take possession of his mind. He had just placed at\nthe orders of Athos the only post that could protect him. He had a\nmile of causeway to traverse before he could regain his camp. The fog\nincreased with such intensity that he could scarcely distinguish objects\nat ten paces' distance. Monk then thought he heard the sound of an oar\nover the marsh on the right. \"Who goes there?\" said he.\n\nBut nobody answered; then he cocked his pistol, took his sword in his\nhand, and quickened his pace, without, however, being willing to call\nanybody. Such a summons, for which there was no absolute necessity,\nappeared unworthy of him.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVII. The Next Day.\n\nIt was seven o'clock in the morning, the first rays of day lightened the\npools of the marsh, in which the sun was reflected like a red ball, when\nAthos, awakening and opening the window of his bed-chamber, which looked\nout upon the banks of the river, perceived, at fifteen paces' distance\nfrom him, the sergeant and the men who had accompanied him the evening\nbefore, and who, after having deposited the casks at his house, had\nreturned to the camp by the causeway on the right.\n\nWhy had these men come back after having returned to the camp? That was\nthe question which first presented itself to Athos. The sergeant, with\nhis head raised, appeared to be watching the moment when the gentleman\nshould appear to address him. Athos, surprised to see these men, whom he\nhad seen depart the night before, could not refrain from expressing his\nastonishment to them.\n\n\"There is nothing surprising in that, monsieur,\" said the sergeant;\n\"for yesterday the general commanded me to watch over your safety, and I\nthought it right to obey that order.\"\n\n\"Is the general at the camp?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"No doubt he is, monsieur; as when he left you he was going back.\"\n\n\"Well, wait for me a moment; I am going thither to render an account of\nthe fidelity with which you fulfilled your duty, and to get my sword,\nwhich I left upon the table in the tent.\"\n\n\"This happens very well,\" said the sergeant, \"for we were about to\nrequest you to do so.\"\n\nAthos fancied he could detect an air of equivocal _bonhomie_ upon the\ncountenance of the sergeant; but the adventure of the vault might have\nexcited the curiosity of the man, and it was not surprising that he\nallowed some of the feelings which agitated his mind to appear in his\nface. Athos closed the doors carefully, confiding the keys to Grimaud,\nwho had chosen his domicile beneath the shed itself, which led to the\ncellar where the casks had been deposited. The sergeant escorted the\nComte de la Fere to the camp. There a fresh guard awaited him, and\nrelieved the four men who had conducted Athos.\n\nThis fresh guard was commanded by the aid-de-camp Digby, who, on their\nway, fixed upon Athos looks so little encouraging, that the Frenchman\nasked himself whence arose, with regard to him, this vigilance and this\nseverity, when the evening before he had been left perfectly free. He\nnevertheless continued his way to the headquarters, keeping to himself\nthe observations which men and things forced him to make. He found in\nthe general's tent, to which he had been introduced the evening before,\nthree superior officers: these were Monk's lieutenant and two colonels.\nAthos perceived his sword; it was still on the table where he left it.\nNeither of the officers had seen Athos, consequently neither of them\nknew him. Monk's lieutenant asked, at the appearance of Athos, if that\nwere the same gentleman with whom the general had left the tent.\n\n\"Yes, your honor,\" said the sergeant; \"it is the same.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Athos, haughtily, \"I do not deny it, I think; and now,\ngentlemen, in turn, permit me to ask you to what purpose these questions\nare asked, and particularly some explanations upon the tone in which you\nask them?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the lieutenant, \"if we address these questions to\nyou, it is because we have a right to do so, and if we make them in a\nparticular tone, it is because that tone, believe me, agrees with the\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Athos, \"you do not know who I am; but I must tell you\nthat I acknowledge no one here but General Monk as my equal. Where is\nhe? Let me be conducted to him, and if he has any questions to put\nto me, I will answer him and to his satisfaction, I hope. I repeat,\ngentlemen, where is the general?\"\n\n\"Eh! good God! you know better than we do where he is,\" said the\nlieutenant.\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Athos; \"I do not understand you.\"\n\n\"You will understand me--and, in the first place, do not speak so\nloudly.\"\n\nAthos smiled disdainfully.\n\n\"We don't ask you to smile,\" said one of the colonels warmly; \"we\nrequire you to answer.\"\n\n\"And I, gentlemen, declare to you that I will not reply until I am in\nthe presence of the general.\"\n\n\"But,\" replied the same colonel who had already spoken, \"you know very\nwell that is impossible.\"\n\n\"This is the second time I have received this strange reply to the wish\nI express,\" said Athos. \"Is the general absent?\"\n\nThis question was made with such apparent good faith, and the gentleman\nwore an air of such natural surprise, that the three officers exchanged\na meaning look. The lieutenant, by a tacit convention with the other\ntwo, was spokesman.\n\n\"Monsieur, the general left you last night on the borders of the\nmonastery.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"And you went--\"\n\n\"It is not for me to answer you, but for those who have accompanied me.\nThey were your soldiers, ask them.\"\n\n\"But if we please to question you?\"\n\n\"Then it will please me to reply, monsieur, that I do not recognize any\none here, that I know no one here but the general, and that it is to him\nalone I will reply.\"\n\n\"So be it, monsieur; but as we are the masters, we constitute ourselves\na council of war, and when you are before judges you must reply.\"\n\nThe countenance of Athos expressed nothing but astonishment and disdain,\ninstead of the terror the officers expected to read in it at this\nthreat.\n\n\"Scottish or English judges upon me, a subject of the king of France;\nupon me, placed under the safeguard of British honor! You are mad,\ngentlemen!\" said Athos, shrugging his shoulders.\n\nThe officers looked at each other. \"Then, monsieur,\" said one of them,\n\"do you pretend not to know where the general is?\"\n\n\"To that, monsieur, I have already replied.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you have already replied an incredible thing.\"\n\n\"It is true, nevertheless, gentlemen. Men of my rank are not generally\nliars. I am a gentleman, I have told you, and when I have at my side the\nsword which, by an excess of delicacy, I left last night upon the table\nwhereon it still lies, believe me, no man says that to me which I am\nunwilling to hear. I am at this moment disarmed; if you pretend to be my\njudges, try me; if you are but my executioners, kill me.\"\n\n\"But, monsieur--\" asked the lieutenant, in a more courteous voice,\nstruck with the lofty coolness of Athos.\n\n\"Sir, I came to speak confidentially with your general about affairs of\nimportance. It was not an ordinary welcome that he gave me. The accounts\nyour soldiers can give you may convince you of that. If, then, the\ngeneral received me in that manner, he knew my titles to his esteem.\nNow, you do not suspect, I should think, that I should reveal my secrets\nto you, and still less his.\"\n\n\"But these casks, what do they contain?\"\n\n\"Have you not put that question to your soldiers? What was their reply?\"\n\n\"That they contained powder and ball.\"\n\n\"From whom had they that information? They must have told you that.\"\n\n\"From the general; but we are not dupes.\"\n\n\"Beware, gentlemen; it is not to me you are now giving the lie, it is to\nyour leader.\"\n\nThe officers again looked at each other. Athos continued: \"Before your\nsoldiers the general told me to wait a week, and at the expiration of\nthat week he would give me the answer he had to make me. Have I fled\naway? No; I wait.\"\n\n\"He told you to wait a week!\" cried the lieutenant.\n\n\"He told me that so clearly, sir, that I have a sloop at the mouth of\nthe river, which I could with ease have joined yesterday, and embarked.\nNow, if I have remained, it was only in compliance with the desire of\nyour general; his honor having requested me not to depart without a last\naudience, which he fixed at a week hence. I repeat to you, then, I am\nwaiting.\"\n\nThe lieutenant turned towards the other officers, and said, in a low\nvoice: \"If this gentleman speaks truth, there may still be some hope.\nThe general may be carrying out some negotiations so secret, that he\nthought it imprudent to inform even us. Then the time limited for his\nabsence would be a week.\" Then, turning towards Athos: \"Monsieur,\" said\nhe, \"your declaration is of the most serious importance; are you willing\nto repeat it under the seal of an oath?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Athos, \"I have always lived in a world where my simple\nword was regarded as the most sacred of oaths.\"\n\n\"This time, however, monsieur, the circumstance is more grave than any\nyou may have been placed in. The safety of the whole army is at stake.\nReflect; the general has disappeared, and our search for him has been in\nvain. Is this disappearance natural? Has a crime been committed? Are we\nnot bound to carry our investigations to extremity? Have we any right to\nwait with patience? At this moment, everything, monsieur, depends upon\nthe words you are about to pronounce.\"\n\n\"Thus questioned, gentlemen, I no longer hesitate,\" said Athos. \"Yes,\nI came hither to converse confidentially with General Monk, and ask\nhim for an answer regarding certain interests; yes, the general being,\ndoubtless, unable to pronounce before the expected battle, begged me\nto remain a week in the house I inhabit, promising me that in a week I\nshould see him again. Yes, all this is true, and I swear it by God who\nis the absolute master of my life and yours.\" Athos pronounced these\nwords with so much grandeur and solemnity, that the three officers were\nalmost convinced. Nevertheless, one of the colonels made a last attempt.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said he, \"although we may now be persuaded of the truth of\nwhat you say, there is yet a strange mystery in all this. The general is\ntoo prudent a man to have thus abandoned his army on the eve of a battle\nwithout having at least given notice of it to one of us. As for myself,\nI cannot believe but some strange event has been the cause of this\ndisappearance. Yesterday some foreign fishermen came to sell their fish\nhere; they were lodged yonder among the Scots; that is to say, on the\nroad the general took with this gentleman, to go to the abbey, and\nto return from it. It was one of these fishermen that accompanied the\ngeneral with a light. And this morning, bark and fishermen have all\ndisappeared, carried away by the night's tide.\"\n\n\"For my part,\" said the lieutenant, \"I see nothing in that that is not\nquite natural, for these people were not prisoners.\"\n\n\"No; but I repeat it was one of them who lighted the general and this\ngentleman to the abbey, and Digby assures us that the general had strong\nsuspicions concerning those people. Now, who can say whether these\npeople were not connected with this gentleman; and that, the blow\nbeing struck, the gentleman, who is evidently brave, did not remain to\nreassure us by his presence, and to prevent our researches being made in\na right direction?\"\n\nThis speech made an impression upon the other two officers.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Athos, \"permit me to tell you, that your reasoning, though\nspecious in appearance, nevertheless wants consistency, as regards me.\nI have remained, you say, to divert suspicion. Well! on the contrary,\nsuspicions arise in me as well as in you; and I say, it is impossible,\ngentlemen, that the general, on the eve of a battle, should leave his\narmy without saying anything to at least one of his officers. Yes, there\nis some strange event connected with this; instead of being idle\nand waiting, you must display all the activity and all the vigilance\npossible. I am your prisoner, gentlemen, upon parole or otherwise. My\nhonor is concerned in ascertaining what has become of General Monk,\nand to such a point, that if you were to say to me, 'Depart!' I should\nreply: 'No, I will remain!' And if you were to ask my opinion, I should\nadd: 'Yes, the general is the victim of some conspiracy, for, if he had\nintended to leave the camp he would have told me so.' Seek, then, search\nthe land, search the sea; the general has not gone of his own good\nwill.\"\n\nThe lieutenant made a sign to the two other officers.\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" said he, \"no; in your turn you go too far. The general\nhas nothing to suffer from these events, and, no doubt, has directed\nthem. What Monk is now doing he has often done before. We are wrong in\nalarming ourselves; his absence will, doubtless, be of short duration;\ntherefore, let us beware, lest by a pusillanimity which the general\nwould consider a crime, of making his absence public, and by that\nmeans demoralize the army. The general gives a striking proof of his\nconfidence in us; let us show ourselves worthy of it. Gentlemen, let the\nmost profound silence cover all this with an impenetrable veil; we\nwill detain this gentleman, not from mistrust of him with regard to\nthe crime, but to assure more effectively the secret of the general's\nabsence by keeping among ourselves; therefore, until fresh orders, the\ngentleman will remain at headquarters.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Athos, \"you forget that last night the general\nconfided to me a deposit over which I am bound to watch. Give me\nwhatever guard you like, chain me if you like, but leave me the house I\ninhabit for my prison. The general, on his return, would reproach you, I\nswear on the honor of a gentleman, for having displeased him in this.\"\n\n\"So be it, monsieur,\" said the lieutenant; \"return to your abode.\"\n\nThen they placed over Athos a guard of fifty men, who surrounded his\nhouse, without losing sight of him for a minute.\n\nThe secret remained secure, but hours, days passed away without the\ngeneral's returning, or without anything being heard of him.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVIII. Smuggling.\n\nTwo days after the events we have just related, and while General Monk\nwas expected every minute in the camp to which he did not return, a\nlittle Dutch _felucca_, manned by eleven men, cast anchor upon the coast\nof Scheveningen, nearly within cannon-shot of the port. It was night,\nthe darkness was great, the tide rose in the darkness; it was a capital\ntime to land passengers and merchandise.\n\nThe road of Scheveningen forms a vast crescent; it is not very deep\nand not very safe; therefore, nothing is seen stationed there but large\nFlemish hoys, or some of those Dutch barks which fishermen draw up on\nthe sand on rollers, as the ancients did, according to Virgil. When the\ntide is rising, and advancing on land, it is not prudent to bring the\nvessels too close in shore, for, if the wind is fresh, the prows are\nburied in the sand; and the sand of that coast is spongy; it receives\neasily, but does not yield so well. It was on this account, no doubt,\nthat a boat was detached from the bark, as soon as the latter had cast\nanchor, and came with eight sailors, amidst whom was to be seen an\nobject of an oblong form, a sort of large pannier or bale.\n\nThe shore was deserted; the few fishermen inhabiting the down were gone\nto bed. The only sentinel that guarded the coast (a coast very badly\nguarded, seeing that a landing from large ships was impossible), without\nhaving been able to follow the example of the fishermen, who were gone\nto bed, imitated them so far, that he slept at the back of his watch-box\nas soundly as they slept in their beds. The only noise to be heard,\nthen, was the whistling of the night breeze among the bushes and\nthe brambles of the downs. But the people who were approaching were\ndoubtless mistrustful people, for this real silence and apparent\nsolitude did not satisfy them. Their boat, therefore, scarcely as\nvisible as a dark speck upon the ocean, gilded along noiselessly,\navoiding the use of their oars for fear of being heard, and gained the\nnearest land.\n\nScarcely had it touched the ground when a single man jumped out of the\nboat, after having given a brief order, in a manner which denoted the\nhabit of commanding. In consequence of this order, several muskets\nimmediately glittered in the feeble light reflected from that mirror of\nthe heavens, the sea; and the oblong bale of which we spoke, containing\nno doubt some contraband object, was transported to land, with infinite\nprecautions. Immediately after that, the man who had landed first, set\noff at a rapid pace diagonally towards the village of Scheveningen,\ndirecting his course to the nearest point of the wood. When there, he\nsought for that house already described as the temporary residence--and\na very humble residence--of him who was styled by courtesy king of\nEngland.\n\nAll were asleep there, as everywhere else, only a large dog, of the race\nof those which the fishermen of Scheveningen harness to little carts\nto carry fish to the Hague, began to bark formidably as soon as the\nstranger's steps were audible beneath the windows. But the watchfulness,\ninstead of alarming the newly-landed man, appeared, on the contrary, to\ngive him great joy, for his voice might perhaps have proved insufficient\nto rouse the people of the house, whilst, with an auxiliary of that\nsort, his voice became almost useless. The stranger waited, then,\ntill these reiterated and sonorous barkings should, according to all\nprobability, have produced their effect, and then he ventured a summons.\nOn hearing his voice, the dog began to roar with such violence that\nanother voice was soon heard from the interior, quieting the dog. With\nthat the dog was quieted.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked that voice, at the same time weak, broken, and\ncivil.\n\n\"I want his majesty King Charles II., king of England,\" said the\nstranger.\n\n\"What do you want with him?\"\n\n\"I want to speak with him.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Ah! _Mordioux!_ you ask too much; I don't like talking through doors.\"\n\n\"Only tell me your name.\"\n\n\"I don't like to declare my name in the open air, either; besides, you\nmay be sure I shall not eat your dog, and I hope to God he will be as\nreserved with respect to me.\"\n\n\"You bring news, perhaps, monsieur, do you not?\" replied the voice,\npatient and querulous as that of an old man.\n\n\"I will answer for it, I bring you news you little expect. Open the\ndoor, then, if you please, _hein!_\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" persisted the old man, \"do you believe, upon your soul and\nconscience, that your news is worth waking the king?\"\n\n\"For God's sake, my dear monsieur, draw your bolts; you will not be\nsorry, I swear, for the trouble it will give you. I am worth my weight\nin gold, _parole d'honneur!_\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I cannot open the door till you have told me your name.\"\n\n\"Must I, then?\"\n\n\"It is by the order of my master, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, my name is--but, I warn you, my name will tell you absolutely\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Never mind, tell it, notwithstanding.\"\n\n\"Well, I am the Chevalier d'Artagnan.\"\n\nThe voice uttered an exclamation.\n\n\"Oh! good heavens!\" said a voice on the other side of the door.\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan. What happiness! I could not help thinking I knew\nthat voice.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said D'Artagnan. \"My voice is known here! That's flattering.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, we know it,\" said the old man, drawing the bolts; \"and here is\nthe proof.\" And at these words he let in D'Artagnan, who, by the\nlight of the lantern he carried in his hand, recognized his obstinate\ninterlocutor.\n\n\"Ah! _Mordioux!_\" cried he: \"why, it is Parry! I ought to have known\nthat.\"\n\n\"Parry, yes, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, it is I. What joy to see you\nonce again!\"\n\n\"You are right there, what joy!\" said D'Artagnan, pressing the old man's\nhand. \"There, now you'll go and inform the king, will you not?\"\n\n\"But the king is asleep, my dear monsieur.\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_ then wake him. He won't scold you for having disturbed him,\nI will promise you.\"\n\n\"You come on the part of the count, do you not?\"\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere?\"\n\n\"From Athos?\"\n\n\"_Ma foi!_ no; I come on my own part. Come, Parry, quick! The king--I\nwant the king.\"\n\nParry did not think it his duty to resist any longer; he knew D'Artagnan\nof old; he knew that, although a Gascon, his words never promised\nmore than they could stand to. He crossed a court and a little garden,\nappeased the dog, that seemed most anxious to taste of the musketeer's\nflesh, and went to knock at the window of a chamber forming the\nground-floor of a little pavilion. Immediately a little dog inhabiting\nthat chamber replied to the great dog inhabiting the court.\n\n\"Poor king!\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"these are his body-guards. It\nis true he is not the worse guarded on that account.\"\n\n\"What is wanted with me?\" asked the king, from the back of the chamber.\n\n\"Sire, it is M. le Chevalier d'Artagnan, who brings you some news.\"\n\nA noise was immediately heard in the chamber, a door was opened, and\na flood of light inundated the corridor and the garden. The king was\nworking by the light of a lamp. Papers were lying about upon his desk,\nand he had commenced the first copy of a letter which showed, by the\nnumerous erasures, the trouble he had had in writing it.\n\n\"Come in, monsieur le chevalier,\" said he, turning around. Then\nperceiving the fisherman, \"What do you mean, Parry? Where is M. le\nChevalier d'Artagnan?\" asked Charles.\n\n\"He is before you, sire,\" said M. d'Artagnan.\n\n\"What, in that costume?\"\n\n\"Yes; look at me, sire; do you not remember having seen me at Blois, in\nthe ante-chamber of King Louis XIV.?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, and I remember I was much pleased with you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed. \"It was my duty to behave as I did, the moment I knew\nthat I had the honor of being near your majesty.\"\n\n\"You bring me news, do you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"From the king of France?\"\n\n\"_Ma foi!_ no, sire,\" replied D'Artagnan. \"Your majesty must have seen\nyonder that the king of France is only occupied with his own majesty.\"\n\nCharles raised his eyes towards heaven.\n\n\"No, sire, no,\" continued D'Artagnan. \"I bring news entirely composed\nof personal facts. Nevertheless, I hope that your majesty will listen to\nthe facts and news with some favor.\"\n\n\"Speak, monsieur.\"\n\n\"If I am not mistaken, sire, your majesty spoke a great deal at Blois,\nof the embarrassed state in which the affairs of England are.\"\n\nCharles colored. \"Monsieur,\" said he, \"it was to the king of France I\nrelated--\"\n\n\"Oh! your majesty is mistaken,\" said the musketeer, coolly; \"I know how\nto speak to kings in misfortune. It is only when they are in misfortune\nthat they speak to me; once fortunate, they look upon me no more. I\nhave, then, for your majesty, not only the greatest respect, but, still\nmore, the most absolute devotion; and that, believe me, with me, sire,\nmeans something. Now, hearing your majesty complain of fate, I found\nthat you were noble and generous, and bore misfortune well.\"\n\n\"In truth!\" said Charles, much astonished, \"I do not know which I ought\nto prefer, your freedoms or your respects.\"\n\n\"You will choose presently, sire,\" said D'Artagnan. \"Then your\nmajesty complained to your brother, Louis XIV., of the difficulty you\nexperienced in returning to England and regaining your throne for want\nof men and money.\"\n\nCharles allowed a movement of impatience to escape him.\n\n\"And the principal object your majesty found in your way,\" continued\nD'Artagnan, \"was a certain general commanding the armies of the\nparliament, and who was playing yonder the part of another Cromwell. Did\nnot your majesty say so?\"\n\n\"Yes; but I repeat to you, monsieur, those words were for the king's\nears alone.\"\n\n\"And you will see, sire, that it is very fortunate that they fell into\nthose of his lieutenant of musketeers. That man so troublesome to\nyour majesty was one General Monk, I believe; did I not hear his name\ncorrectly, sire?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, but once more, to what purpose are all these questions.\"\n\n\"Oh! I know very well, sire, that etiquette will not allow kings to\nbe questioned. I hope, however, presently you will pardon my want of\netiquette. Your majesty added that, notwithstanding, if you could see\nhim, confer with him, and meet him face to face, you would triumph,\neither by force or persuasion, over that obstacle--the only serious\none, the only insurmountable one, the only real one you met with on your\nroad.\"\n\n\"All that is true, monsieur: my destiny, my future, my obscurity, or my\nglory depend upon that man; but what do you draw from that?\"\n\n\"One thing alone, that if this General Monk is troublesome to the point\nyour majesty describes, it would be expedient to get rid of him or make\nan ally of him.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, a king who has neither army nor money, as you have heard my\nconversation with my brother Louis, has no means of acting against a man\nlike Monk.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, that was your opinion, I know very well: but, fortunately\nfor you, it was not mine.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"That, without an army and without a million, I have done--I,\nmyself--what your majesty thought could alone be done with an army and a\nmillion.\"\n\n\"How! What do you say? What have you done?\"\n\n\"What have I done? Eh! well, sire, I went yonder to take this man who is\nso troublesome to your majesty.\"\n\n\"In England?\"\n\n\"Exactly, sire.\"\n\n\"You went to take Monk in England?\"\n\n\"Should I by chance have done wrong, sire?\"\n\n\"In truth, you are mad, monsieur!\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world, sire.\"\n\n\"You have taken Monk?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In the midst of his camp.\"\n\nThe king trembled with impatience.\n\n\"And having taken him on the causeway of Newcastle, I bring him to your\nmajesty,\" said D'Artagnan, simply.\n\n\"You bring him to me!\" cried the king, almost indignant at what he\nconsidered a mystification.\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" replied D'Artagnan, in the same tone, \"I bring him to you;\nhe is down below yonder, in a large chest pierced with holes, so as to\nallow him to breathe.\"\n\n\"Good God!\"\n\n\"Oh! don't be uneasy, sire, we have taken the greatest possible care\nof him. He comes in good state, and in perfect condition. Would your\nmajesty please to see him, to talk with him, or to have him thrown into\nthe sea?\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\" repeated Charles, \"oh, heavens! do you speak the truth,\nmonsieur? Are you not insulting me with some unworthy joke? You have\naccomplished this unheard-of act of audacity and genius--impossible!\"\n\n\"Will your majesty permit me to open the window?\" said D'Artagnan,\nopening it.\n\nThe king had not time to reply yes or no. D'Artagnan gave a shrill and\nprolonged whistle, which he repeated three times through the silence of\nthe night.\n\n\"There!\" said he, \"he will be brought to your majesty.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XXIX. In which D'Artagnan begins to fear he has placed his Money\nand that of Planchet in the Sinking Fund.\n\nThe king could not overcome his surprise, and looked sometimes at the\nsmiling face of the musketeer, and sometimes at the dark window which\nopened into the night. But before he had fixed his ideas, eight of\nD'Artagnan's men, for two had remained to take care of the bark, brought\nto the house, where Parry received him, that object of an oblong form,\nwhich, for the moment, inclosed the destinies of England. Before he left\nCalais, D'Artagnan had had made in that city a sort of coffin, large and\ndeep enough for a man to turn in it at his ease. The bottom and sides,\nproperly upholstered, formed a bed sufficiently soft to prevent the\nrolling of the ship turning this kind of cage into a rat-trap. The\nlittle grating, of which D'Artagnan had spoken to the king, like the\nvisor of the helmet, was placed opposite to the man's face. It was so\nconstructed that, at the least cry, a sudden pressure would stifle that\ncry, and, if necessary, him who had uttered that cry.\n\nD'Artagnan was so well acquainted with his crew and his prisoner, that\nduring the whole voyage he had been in dread of two things: either that\nthe general would prefer death to this sort of imprisonment, and would\nsmother himself by endeavoring to speak, or that his guards would allow\nthemselves to be tempted by the offers of the prisoner, and put him,\nD'Artagnan, into the box instead of Monk.\n\nD'Artagnan, therefore, had passed the two days and the two nights of the\nvoyage close to the coffin, alone with the general, offering him wine\nand food, which the latter had refused, and constantly endeavoring\nto reassure him upon the destiny which awaited him at the end of this\nsingular captivity. Two pistols on the table and his naked sword made\nD'Artagnan easy with regard to indiscretions from without.\n\nWhen once at Scheveningen he had felt completely reassured. His men\ngreatly dreaded any conflict with the lords of the soil. He had,\nbesides, interested in his cause him who had morally served him as\nlieutenant, and whom we have seen reply to the name of Menneville. The\nlatter, not being a vulgar spirit, had more to risk than the others,\nbecause he had more conscience. He believed in a future in the service\nof D'Artagnan, and consequently would have allowed himself to be cut to\npieces, rather than violate the order given by his leader. Thus it was\nthat, once landed, it was to him that D'Artagnan had confided the care\nof the chest and the general's breathing. It was he, too, he had ordered\nto have the chest brought by the seven men as soon as he should hear the\ntriple whistle. We have seen that the lieutenant obeyed. The coffer\nonce in the house, D'Artagnan dismissed his men with a gracious smile,\nsaying, \"Messieurs, you have rendered a great service to King\nCharles II., who in less than six weeks will be king of England. Your\ngratification will then be doubled. Return to the boat and wait for me.\"\nUpon which they departed with such shouts of joy as terrified even the\ndog himself.\n\nD'Artagnan had caused the coffer to be brought as far as the king's\nante-chamber. He then, with great care, closed the door of this\nante-chamber, after which he opened the coffer, and said to the general:\n\n\"General, I have a thousand excuses to make to you; my manner of acting\nhas not been worthy of such a man as you, I know very well; but I wished\nyou to take me for the captain of a bark. And then England is a very\ninconvenient country for transports. I hope, therefore, you will take\nall that into consideration. But now, general, you are at liberty to get\nup and walk.\" This said, he cut the bonds which fastened the arms and\nhands of the general. The latter got up, and then sat down with the\ncountenance of a man who expects death. D'Artagnan opened the door\nof Charles's study, and said, \"Sire, here is your enemy, M. Monk; I\npromised myself to perform this service for your majesty. It is done;\nnow order as you please. M. Monk,\" added he, turning towards the\nprisoner, \"you are in the presence of his majesty Charles II., sovereign\nlord of Great Britain.\"\n\nMonk raised towards the prince his coldly stoical look, and replied: \"I\nknow no king of Great Britain; I recognize even here no one worthy of\nbearing the name of gentleman: for it is in the name of King Charles\nII. that an emissary, whom I took for an honest man, came and laid an\ninfamous snare for me. I have fallen into that snare; so much the worse\nfor me. Now, you the tempter,\" said he to the king; \"you the executor,\"\nsaid he to D'Artagnan; \"remember what I am about to say to you: you have\nmy body, you may kill it, and I advise you to do so, for you shall never\nhave my mind or my will. And now, ask me not a single word, as from this\nmoment I will not open my mouth even to cry out. I have said.\"\n\nAnd he pronounced these words with the savage, invincible resolution of\nthe most mortified Puritan. D'Artagnan looked at his prisoner like a man\nwho knows the value of every word, and who fixes that value according to\nthe accent with which it has been pronounced.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said he, in a whisper to the king, \"the general is an\nobstinate man; he would not take a mouthful of bread, nor swallow a drop\nof wine, during the two days of our voyage. But as from this moment it\nis your majesty who must decide his fate, I wash my hands of him.\"\n\nMonk, erect, pale, and resigned, waited with his eyes fixed and his arms\nfolded. D'Artagnan turned towards him. \"You will please to understand\nperfectly,\" said he, \"that your speech, otherwise very fine, does not\nsuit anybody, not even yourself. His majesty wished to speak to you, you\nrefused an interview; why, now that you are face to face, that you are\nhere by a force independent of your will, why do you confine yourself to\nthe rigors which I consider useless and absurd? Speak! what the devil!\nspeak, if only to say 'No.'\"\n\nMonk did not unclose his lips; Monk did not turn his eyes; Monk stroked\nhis mustache with a thoughtful air, which announced that matters were\ngoing on badly.\n\nDuring all this time Charles II. had fallen into a profound reverie. For\nthe first time he found himself face to face with Monk; with the man he\nhad so much desired to see; and, with that peculiar glance which God has\ngiven to eagles and kings, he had fathomed the abyss of his heart. He\nbeheld Monk, then, resolved positively to die rather than speak, which\nwas not to be wondered at in so considerable a man, the wound in whose\nmind must at the moment have been cruel. Charles II. formed, on the\ninstant, one of those resolutions upon which an ordinary man risks his\nlife, a general his fortune, and a king his kingdom. \"Monsieur,\" said\nhe to Monk, \"you are perfectly right upon certain points; I do not,\ntherefore, ask you to answer me, but to listen to me.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence, during which the king looked at Monk, who\nremained impassible.\n\n\"You have made me just now a painful reproach, monsieur,\" continued the\nking; \"you said that one of my emissaries had been to Newcastle to lay\na snare for you, and that, parenthetically, cannot be understood by M.\nd'Artagnan here, and to whom, before everything, I owe sincere thanks\nfor his generous, his heroic devotion.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed with respect; Monk took no notice.\n\n\"For M. d'Artagnan--and observe, M. Monk, I do not say this to excuse\nmyself--for M. d'Artagnan,\" continued the king, \"went to England of his\nfree will, without interest, without orders, without hope, like a true\ngentleman as he is, to render a service to an unfortunate king, and to\nadd to the illustrious actions of an existence, already so well filled,\none glorious deed more.\"\n\nD'Artagnan colored a little, and coughed to keep his countenance. Monk\ndid not stir.\n\n\"You do not believe what I tell you, M. Monk,\" continued the king. \"I\ncan understand that,--such proofs of devotion are so rare, that their\nreality may well be put in doubt.\"\n\n\"Monsieur would do wrong not to believe you, sire,\" cried D'Artagnan:\n\"for that which your majesty has said is the exact truth, and the truth\nso exact that it seems, in going to fetch the general, I have done\nsomething which sets everything wrong. In truth, if it be so, I am in\ndespair.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the king, pressing the hand of the\nmusketeer, \"you have obliged me as much as if you had promoted the\nsuccess of my cause, for you have revealed to me an unknown friend, to\nwhom I shall ever be grateful, and whom I shall always love.\" And the\nking pressed his hand cordially. \"And,\" continued he, bowing to Monk,\n\"an enemy whom I shall henceforth esteem at his proper value.\"\n\nThe eyes of the Puritan flashed, but only once, and his countenance, for\nan instant, illuminated by that flash, resumed its somber impassibility.\n\n\"Then, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" continued Charles, \"this is what was about\nto happen: M. le Comte de la Fere, who you know, I believe, has set out\nfor Newcastle.\"\n\n\"What, Athos!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, that was his _nom de guerre_, I believe. The Comte de la Fere had\nthen set out for Newcastle, and was going, perhaps, to bring the\ngeneral to hold a conference with me or with those of my party, when you\nviolently, as it appears, interfered with the negotiation.\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" replied D'Artagnan, \"he entered the camp the very evening\nin which I succeeded in getting into it with my fishermen--\"\n\nAn almost imperceptible frown on the brow of Monk told D'Artagnan that\nhe had surmised rightly.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" muttered he; \"I thought I knew his person; I even fancied I\nknew his voice. Unlucky wretch that I am! Oh! sire, pardon me! I thought\nI had so successfully steered my bark.\"\n\n\"There is nothing ill in it, sir,\" said the king, \"except that the\ngeneral accuses me of having laid a snare for him, which is not the\ncase. No, general, those are not the arms which I contemplated employing\nwith you, as you will soon see. In the meanwhile, when I give you my\nword upon the honor of a gentleman, believe me, sir, believe me! Now,\nMonsieur d'Artagnan, a word with you, if you please.\"\n\n\"I listen on my knees, sire.\"\n\n\"You are truly at my service, are you not?\"\n\n\"Your majesty has seen that I am, too much so.\"\n\n\"That is well; from a man like you one word suffices. In addition to\nthat word you bring actions. General, have the goodness to follow me.\nCome with us, M. d'Artagnan.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, considerably surprised, prepared to obey. Charles II. went\nout, Monk followed him, D'Artagnan followed Monk. Charles took the path\nby which D'Artagnan had come to his abode; the fresh sea breezes soon\ncaressed the faces of the three nocturnal travelers, and, at fifty paces\nfrom the little gate which Charles opened, they found themselves upon\nthe down in the face of the ocean, which, having ceased to rise, reposed\nupon the shore like a wearied monster. Charles II. walked pensively\nalong, his head hanging down and his hand beneath his cloak. Monk\nfollowed him, with crossed arms and an uneasy look. D'Artagnan came\nlast, with his hand on the hilt of his sword.\n\n\"Where is the boat in which you came, gentlemen?\" said Charles to the\nmusketeer.\n\n\"Yonder, sire; I have seven men and an officer waiting me in that little\nbark which is lighted by a fire.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see; the boat is drawn upon the sand; but you certainly did not\ncome from Newcastle in that frail bark?\"\n\n\"No, sire; I freighted a felucca, at my own expense, which is at anchor\nwithin cannon-shot of the downs. It was in that felucca we made the\nvoyage.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the king to Monk, \"you are free.\"\n\nHowever firm his will, Monk could not suppress an exclamation. The king\nadded an affirmative motion of his head, and continued: \"We shall waken\na fisherman of the village, who will put his boat to sea immediately,\nand will take you back to any place you may command him. M. d'Artagnan\nhere will escort your honor. I place M. d'Artagnan under the safeguard\nof your loyalty, M. Monk.\"\n\nMonk allowed a murmur of surprise to escape him, and D'Artagnan a\nprofound sigh. The king, without appearing to notice either, knocked\nagainst the deal trellis which inclosed the cabin of the principal\nfisherman inhabiting the down.\n\n\"Hey! Keyser!\" cried he, \"awake!\"\n\n\"Who calls me?\" asked the fisherman.\n\n\"I, Charles the king.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord!\" cried Keyser, rising ready dressed from the sail in which\nhe slept, as people sleep in a hammock. \"What can I do to serve you?\"\n\n\"Captain Keyser,\" said Charles, \"you must set sail immediately. Here is\na traveler who wishes to freight your bark, and will pay you well; serve\nhim well.\" And the king drew back a few steps to allow Monk to speak to\nthe fisherman.\n\n\"I wish to cross over into England,\" said Monk, who spoke Dutch enough\nto make himself understood.\n\n\"This minute,\" said the _patron_, \"this very minute, if you wish it.\"\n\n\"But will that be long?\" said Monk.\n\n\"Not half an hour, your honor. My eldest son is at this moment preparing\nthe boat, as we were going out fishing at three o'clock in the morning.\"\n\n\"Well, is all arranged?\" asked the king, drawing near.\n\n\"All but the price,\" said the fisherman; \"yes, sire.\"\n\n\"That is my affair,\" said Charles, \"the gentleman is my friend.\"\n\nMonk started and looked at Charles on hearing this word.\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" replied Keyser. And at that moment they heard\nKeyser's son, signaling form the shore with the blast of a bull's horn.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" said the king, \"depart.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said D'Artagnan, \"will it please your majesty to grant me a few\nminutes? I have engaged men, and I am going without them; I must give\nthem notice.\"\n\n\"Whistle to them,\" said Charles, smiling.\n\nD'Artagnan, accordingly, whistled, whilst the _patron_ Keyser replied to\nhis son; and four men, led by Menneville, attended the first summons.\n\n\"Here is some money in account,\" said D'Artagnan, putting into their\nhands a purse containing two thousand five hundred livres in gold. \"Go\nand wait for me at Calais, you know where.\" And D'Artagnan heaved a\nprofound sigh, as he let the purse fall into the hands of Menneville.\n\n\"What, are you leaving us?\" cried the men.\n\n\"For a short time,\" said D'Artagnan, \"or for a long time, who knows? But\nwith 2,500 livres, and the 2,500 you have already received, you are paid\naccording to our agreement. We are quits, then, my friend.\"\n\n\"But the boat?\"\n\n\"Do not trouble yourself about that.\"\n\n\"Our things are on board the felucca.\"\n\n\"Go and seek them, and then set off immediately.\"\n\n\"Yes, captain.\"\n\nD'Artagnan returned to Monk, saying,--\"Monsieur, I await your\norders, for I understand we are to go together, unless my company be\ndisagreeable to you.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, monsieur,\" said Monk.\n\n\"Come, gentlemen, on board,\" cried Keyser's son.\n\nCharles bowed to the general with grace and dignity, saying,--\"You will\npardon me this unfortunate accident, and the violence to which you\nhave been subjected, when you are convinced that I was not the cause of\nthem.\"\n\nMonk bowed profoundly without replying. On his side, Charles affected\nnot to say a word to D'Artagnan in private, but aloud,--\"Once more,\nthanks, monsieur le chevalier,\" said he, \"thanks for your services. They\nwill be repaid you by the Lord God, who, I hope, reserves trials and\ntroubles for me alone.\"\n\nMonk followed Keyser and his son embarked with them. D'Artagnan came\nafter, muttering to himself,--\"Poor Planchet! poor Planchet! I am very\nmuch afraid we have made a bad speculation.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XXX. The Shares of Planchet and Company rise again to Par.\n\n\nDuring the passage, Monk only spoke to D'Artagnan in cases of urgent\nnecessity. Thus, when the Frenchman hesitated to come and take his\nmeals, poor meals, composed of salt fish, biscuit, and Hollands gin,\nMonk called him, saying,--\"To table, monsieur, to table!\"\n\nThis was all. D'Artagnan, from being himself on all great occasions,\nextremely concise, did not draw from the general's conciseness a\nfavorable augury of the result of his mission. Now, as D'Artagnan had\nplenty of time for reflection, he battered his brains during this time\nin endeavoring to find out how Athos had seen King Charles, how he had\nconspired his departure with him, and lastly, how he had entered Monk's\ncamp; and the poor lieutenant of musketeers plucked a hair from his\nmustache every time that he reflected that the horseman who accompanied\nMonk on the night of the famous abduction must have been Athos.\n\nAt length, after a passage of two nights and two days, the _patron_\nKeyser touched at the point where Monk, who had given all the orders\nduring the voyage, had commanded they should land. It was exactly at the\nmouth of the little river, near where Athos had chosen his abode.\n\nDaylight was waning, a splendid sun, like a red steel buckler, was\nplunging the lower extremity of its disc beneath the blue line of the\nsea. The felucca was making fair way up the river, tolerably wide\nin that part, but Monk, in his impatience, desired to be landed, and\nKeyser's boat set him and D'Artagnan upon the muddy bank, amidst the\nreeds. D'Artagnan, resigned to obedience, followed Monk exactly as a\nchained bear follows his master; but the position humiliated him not\na little, and he grumbled to himself that the service of kings was a\nbitter one, and that the best of them was good for nothing. Monk walked\nwith long and hasty strides; it might be thought that he did not yet\nfeel certain of having reached English land. They had already begun to\nperceive distinctly a few of the cottages of the sailors and fishermen\nspread over the little quay of this humble port, when, all at once,\nD'Artagnan cried out,--\"God pardon me, there is a house on fire!\"\n\nMonk raised his eyes, and perceived there was, in fact, a house which\nthe flames were beginning to devour. It had begun at a little shed\nbelonging to the house, the roof of which had caught. The fresh evening\nbreeze agitated the fire. The two travelers quickened their steps,\nhearing loud cries, and seeing, as they drew nearer, soldiers with their\nglittering arms pointed towards the house on fire. It was doubtless this\nmenacing occupation which had made them neglect to signal the felucca.\nMonk stopped short for an instant, and, for the first time, formulated\nhis thoughts into words. \"Eh! but,\" said he, \"perhaps they are not my\nsoldiers but Lambert's.\"\n\nThese words contained at once a sorrow, and apprehension, and a reproach\nperfectly intelligible to D'Artagnan. In fact, during the general's\nabsence, Lambert might have given battle, conquered, and dispersed the\nparliament's army, and taken with his own the place of Monk's army,\ndeprived of its strongest support. At this doubt, which passed from the\nmind of Monk to his own, D'Artagnan reasoned in this manner:--\"One of\ntwo things is going to happen; either Monk has spoken correctly, and\nthere are no longer any but Lambertists in the country--that is to say,\nenemies, who would receive me wonderfully well, since it is to me they\nowe their victory; or nothing is changed, and Monk, transported with joy\nat finding his camp still in the same place, will not prove too severe\nin his settlement with me.\" Whilst thinking thus, the two travelers\nadvanced, and began to mingle with a little knot of sailors, who looked\non with sorrow at the burning house, but did not dare to say anything\non account of the threats of the soldiers. Monk addressed one of these\nsailors:--\"What is going on here?\" asked he.\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the man, not recognizing Monk as an officer, under the\nthick cloak which enveloped him, \"that house was inhabited by a foreign\ngentleman, and this foreigner became suspected by the soldiers. They\nwanted to get into his house under pretense of taking him to the camp;\nbut he, without being frightened by their number, threatened death to\nthe first who should cross the threshold of his door; and as there was\none who did venture, the Frenchman stretched him on the earth with a\npistol-shot.\"\n\n\"Ah! he is a Frenchman, is he?\" said D'Artagnan, rubbing his hands.\n\"Good!\"\n\n\"How good?\" replied the fisherman.\n\n\"No, I don't mean that.--What then--my tongue slipped.\"\n\n\"What then, sir?--why, the other men became as enraged as so many lions:\nthey fired more than a hundred shots at the house; but the Frenchman was\nsheltered by the wall, and every time they tried to enter by the door\nthey met with a shot from his lackey, whose aim is deadly, d'ye see?\nEvery time they threatened the window, they met with a pistol-shot from\nthe master. Look and count--there are seven men down.\"\n\n\"Ah! my brave countryman,\" cried D'Artagnan, \"wait a little, wait a\nlittle. I will be with you; and we will settle with this rabble.\"\n\n\"One instant, sir,\" said Monk, \"wait.\"\n\n\"Long?\"\n\n\"No; only the time to ask a question.\" Then, turning towards the sailor,\n\"My friend,\" asked he, with an emotion which, in spite of all his\nself-command, he could not conceal, \"whose soldiers are these, pray tell\nme?\"\n\n\"Whose should they be but that madman, Monk's?\"\n\n\"There has been no battle, then?\"\n\n\"A battle, ah, yes! for what purpose? Lambert's army is melting away\nlike snow in April. All come to Monk, officers and soldiers. In a week\nLambert won't have fifty men left.\"\n\nThe fisherman was interrupted by a fresh discharge directed against the\nhouse, and by another pistol-shot which replied to the discharge and\nstruck down the most daring of the aggressors. The rage of soldiers\nwas at its height. The fire still continued to increase, and a crest\nof flame and smoke whirled and spread over the roof of the house.\nD'Artagnan could no longer contain himself. \"_Mordioux!_\" said he to\nMonk, glancing at him sideways: \"you are a general, and allow your men\nto burn houses and assassinate people, while you look on and warm your\nhands at the blaze of the conflagration? _Mordioux!_ you are not a man.\"\n\n\"Patience, sir, patience!\" said Monk, smiling.\n\n\"Patience! yes, until that brave gentleman is roasted--is that what you\nmean?\" And D'Artagnan rushed forward.\n\n\"Remain where you are, sir,\" said Monk, in a tone of command. And he\nadvanced towards the house, just as an officer had approached it, saying\nto the besieged: \"The house is burning, you will be roasted within an\nhour! There is still time--come, tell us what you know of General Monk,\nand we will spare your life. Reply, or by Saint Patrick--\"\n\nThe besieged made no answer; he was no doubt reloading his pistol.\n\n\"A reinforcement is expected,\" continued the officer; \"in a quarter of\nan hour there will be a hundred men around your house.\"\n\n\"I reply to you,\" said the Frenchman. \"Let your men be sent away; I will\ncome out freely and repair to the camp alone, or else I will be killed\nhere!\"\n\n\"_Mille tonnerres!_\" shouted D'Artagnan; \"why, that's the voice of\nAthos! _Ah canailles!_\" and the sword of D'Artagnan flashed from its\nsheath. Monk stopped him and advanced himself, exclaiming, in a sonorous\nvoice: \"_Hola!_ what is going on here? Digby, whence this fire? why\nthese cries?\"\n\n\"The general!\" cried Digby, letting the point of his sword fall.\n\n\"The general!\" repeated the soldiers.\n\n\"Well, what is there so astonishing in that?\" said Monk, in a calm\ntone. Then, silence being re-established,--\"Now,\" said he, \"who lit this\nfire?\"\n\nThe soldiers hung their heads.\n\n\"What! do I ask a question, and nobody answers me?\" said Monk. \"What!\ndo I find a fault, and nobody repairs it? The fire is still burning, I\nbelieve.\"\n\nImmediately the twenty men rushed forward, seizing pails, buckets, jars,\nbarrels, and extinguishing the fire with as much ardor as they had, an\ninstant before, employed in promoting it. But already, and before all\nthe rest, D'Artagnan had applied a ladder to the house, crying, \"Athos!\nit is I, D'Artagnan! Do not kill me, my dearest friend!\" And in a moment\nthe count was clasped in his arms. In the meantime, Grimaud, preserving\nhis calmness, dismantled the fortification of the ground-floor, and\nafter having opened the door, stood, with his arms folded, quietly\non the sill. Only, on hearing the voice of D'Artagnan, he uttered an\nexclamation of surprise. The fire being extinguished, the soldiers\npresented themselves, Digby at their head.\n\n\"General,\" said he, \"excuse us; what we have done was for love of your\nhonor, whom we thought lost.\"\n\n\"You are mad, gentlemen. Lost! Is a man like me to be lost? Am I not\npermitted to be absent, according to my pleasure, without giving formal\nnotice? Do you, by chance, take me for a citizen from the city? Is\na gentleman, my friend, my guest, to be besieged, entrapped, and\nthreatened with death, because he is suspected? What signifies the word,\nsuspected? Curse me if I don't have every one of you shot like dogs,\nthat the brave gentleman has left alive!\n\n\"General,\" said Digby, piteously, \"there were twenty-eight of us, and\nsee, there are eight on the ground.\"\n\n\"I authorize M. le Comte de la Fere to send the twenty to join the\neight,\" said Monk, stretching out his hand to Athos. \"Let them return to\ncamp. Mr. Digby, you will consider yourself under arrest for a month.\"\n\n\"General--\"\n\n\"That is to teach you, sir, not to act, another time, without orders.\"\n\n\"I had those of the lieutenant, general.\"\n\n\"The lieutenant had no such orders to give you, and he shall be placed\nunder arrest, instead of you, if he has really commanded you to burn\nthis gentleman.\"\n\n\"He did not command that, general; he commanded us to bring him to the\ncamp; but the count was not willing to follow us.\"\n\n\"I was not willing that they should enter and plunder my house,\" said\nAthos to Monk, with a significant look.\n\n\"And you were quite right. To the camp, I say.\" The soldiers departed\nwith dejected looks. \"Now we are alone,\" said Monk to Athos, \"have the\ngoodness to tell me, monsieur, why you persisted in remaining here,\nwhilst you had your felucca--\"\n\n\"I waited for you, general,\" said Athos. \"Had not your honor appointed\nto meet me in a week?\"\n\nAn eloquent look from D'Artagnan made it clear to Monk that these two\nmen, so brave and so loyal, had not acted in concert for his abduction.\nHe knew already it could not be so.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said he to D'Artagnan, \"you were perfectly right. Have the\nkindness to allow me a moment's conversation with M. le Comte de la\nFere?\"\n\nD'Artagnan took advantage of this to go and ask Grimaud how he was. Monk\nrequested Athos to conduct him to the chamber he lived in.\n\nThis chamber was still full of smoke and rubbish. More than fifty balls\nhad passed through the windows and mutilated the walls. They found a\ntable, inkstand, and materials for writing. Monk took up a pen, wrote\na single line, signed it, folded the paper, sealed the letter with\nthe seal of his ring, and handed over the missive to Athos, saying,\n\"Monsieur, carry, if you please, this letter to King Charles II., and\nset out immediately, if nothing detains you here any longer.\"\n\n\"And the casks?\" said Athos.\n\n\"The fisherman who brought me hither will assist you in transporting\nthem on board. Depart, if possible, within an hour.\"\n\n\"Yes, general,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Monsieur D'Artagnan!\" cried Monk, from the window. D'Artagnan ran up\nprecipitately.\n\n\"Embrace your friend and bid him adieu, sir; he is returning to\nHolland.\"\n\n\"To Holland!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"and I?\"\n\n\"You are at liberty to follow him, monsieur; but I request you to\nremain,\" said Monk. \"Will you refuse me?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, general; I am at your orders.\"\n\nD'Artagnan embraced Athos, and only had time to bid him adieu. Monk\nwatched them both. Then he took upon himself the preparations for the\ndeparture, the transportation of the casks on board, and the embarking\nof Athos; then, taking D'Artagnan by the arm, who was quite amazed and\nagitated, he led him towards Newcastle. Whilst going along, the\ngeneral leaning on his arm, D'Artagnan could not help murmuring to\nhimself,--\"Come, come, it seems to me that the shares of the firm of\nPlanchet and Company are rising.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XXXI. Monk reveals Himself.\n\nD'Artagnan, although he flattered himself with better success, had,\nnevertheless, not too well comprehended his situation. It was a strange\nand grave subject for him to reflect upon--this voyage of Athos into\nEngland; this league of the king with Athos, and that extraordinary\ncombination of his design with that of the Comte de la Fere. The best\nway was to let things follow their own train. An imprudence had been\ncommitted, and, whilst having succeeded, as he had promised, D'Artagnan\nfound that he had gained no advantage by his success. Since everything\nwas lost, he could risk no more.\n\nD'Artagnan followed Monk through his camp. The return of the general had\nproduced a marvelous effect, for his people had thought him lost. But\nMonk, with his austere look and icy demeanor, appeared to ask of his\neager lieutenants and delighted soldiers the cause of all this joy.\nTherefore, to the lieutenants who had come to meet him, and who\nexpressed the uneasiness with which they had learnt his departure,--\n\n\"Why is all this?\" said he; \"am I obliged to give you an account of\nmyself?\"\n\n\"But your honor, the sheep may well tremble without the shepherd.\"\n\n\"Tremble!\" replied Monk, in his calm and powerful voice; \"ah, monsieur,\nwhat a word! Curse me, if my sheep have not both teeth and claws; I\nrenounce being their shepherd. Ah, you tremble, gentlemen, do you?\"\n\n\"Yes, general, for you.\"\n\n\"Oh! pray meddle with your own concerns. If I have not the wit God gave\nto Oliver Cromwell, I have that which He has sent to me: I am satisfied\nwith it, however little it may be.\"\n\nThe officer made no reply; and Monk, having imposed silence on his\npeople, all remained persuaded that he had accomplished some important\nwork or made some important trial. This was forming a very poor\nconception of his patience and scrupulous genius. Monk, if he had the\ngood faith of the Puritans, his allies, must have returned fervent\nthanks to the patron saint who had taken him from the box of M.\nd'Artagnan. Whilst these things were going on, our musketeer could not\nhelp constantly repeating,--\n\n\"God grant that M. Monk may not have as much pride as I have; for I\ndeclare that if any one had put me into a coffer with that grating over\nmy mouth, and carried me packed up, like a calf, across the seas, I\nshould cherish such a memory of my piteous looks in that coffer, and\nsuch an ugly animosity against him who had inclosed me in it, I should\ndread so greatly to see a sarcastic smile blooming upon the face of\nthe malicious wretch, or in his attitude any grotesque imitation of my\nposition in the box, that, _Mordioux!_ I should plunge a good dagger\ninto his throat in compensation for the grating, and would nail him down\nin a veritable bier, in remembrance of the false coffin in which I had\nbeen left in to grow moldy for two days.\"\n\nAnd D'Artagnan spoke honestly when he spoke thus; for the skin of our\nGascon was a very thin one. Monk, fortunately, entertained other ideas.\nHe never opened his mouth to his timid conqueror concerning the past;\nbut he admitted him very near to his person in his labors, took him with\nhim to several reconnoiterings, in such a way as to obtain that which he\nevidently warmly desired,--a rehabilitation in the mind of D'Artagnan.\nThe latter conducted himself like a past-master in the art of flattery:\nhe admired all Monk's tactics, and the ordering of his camp; he joked\nvery pleasantly upon the circumvallations of Lambert's camp, who had,\nhe said, very uselessly given himself the trouble to inclose a camp\nfor twenty thousand men, whilst an acre of ground would have been quite\nsufficient for the corporal and fifty guards who would perhaps remain\nfaithful to him.\n\nMonk, immediately after his arrival, had accepted the proposition\nmade by Lambert the evening before, for an interview, and which\nMonk's lieutenants had refused under the pretext that the general was\nindisposed. This interview was neither long nor interesting: Lambert\ndemanded a profession of faith from his rival. The latter declared he\nhad no other opinion than that of the majority. Lambert asked if it\nwould not be more expedient to terminate the quarrel by an alliance\nthan by a battle. Monk hereupon demanded a week for consideration.\nNow, Lambert could not refuse this: and Lambert, nevertheless, had come\nsaying that he should devour Monk's army. Therefore, at the end of the\ninterview, which Lambert's party watched with impatience, nothing was\ndecided--neither treaty nor battle--the rebel army, as M. d'Artagnan\nhad foreseen, began to prefer the good cause to the bad one, and the\nparliament, rumpish as it was, to the pompous nothings of Lambert's\ndesigns.\n\nThey remembered, likewise, the good feasts of London--the profusion of\nale and sherry with which the citizens of London paid their friends\nthe soldiers;--they looked with terror at the black war bread, at the\ntroubled waters of the Tweed,--too salt for the glass, not enough so for\nthe pot; and they said to themselves, \"Are not the roast meats kept warm\nfor Monk in London?\" From that time nothing was heard of but desertion\nin Lambert's army. The soldiers allowed themselves to be drawn away by\nthe force of principles, which are, like discipline, the obligatory\ntie in everybody constituted for any purpose. Monk defended the\nparliament--Lambert attacked it. Monk had no more inclination to support\nparliament than Lambert, but he had it inscribed on his standards, so\nthat all those of the contrary party were reduced to write upon theirs,\n\"Rebellion,\" which sounded ill to puritan ears. They flocked, then, from\nLambert to Monk, as sinners flock from Baal to God.\n\nMonk made his calculations; at a thousand desertions a day Lambert had\nmen enough to last twenty days; but there is in sinking things such a\ngrowth of weight and swiftness, which combine with each other, that\na hundred left the first day, five hundred the second, a thousand the\nthird. Monk thought he had obtained his rate. But from one thousand the\ndeserters increased to two thousand, then to four thousand, and, a week\nafter, Lambert, perceiving that he had no longer the possibility of\naccepting battle, if it were offered to him, took the wise resolution\nof decamping during the night, returning to London, and being beforehand\nwith Monk in constructing a power with the wreck of the military party.\n\nBut Monk, free and without uneasiness, marched towards London as a\nconqueror, augmenting his army with all the floating parties on the\nway. He encamped at Barnet, that is to say, within four leagues of the\ncapital, cherished by the parliament, which thought it beheld in him a\nprotector, and awaited by the people, who were anxious to see him reveal\nhimself, that they might judge him. D'Artagnan himself had not been able\nto fathom his tactics; he observed--he admired. Monk could not enter\nLondon with a settled determination without bringing about civil war. He\ntemporized for a short time.\n\nSuddenly, when least expected, Monk drove the military party out of\nLondon, and installed himself in the city amidst the citizens, by order\nof the parliament; then, at the moment when the citizens were crying out\nagainst Monk--at the moment when the soldiers themselves were accusing\ntheir leader--Monk, finding himself certain of a majority, declared to\nthe Rump Parliament that it must abdicate--be dissolved--and yield its\nplace to a government which would not be a joke. Monk pronounced this\ndeclaration, supported by fifty thousand swords, to which, that same\nevening, were united, with shouts of delirious joy, the five thousand\ninhabitants of the good city of London. At length, at the moment\nwhen the people, after their triumphs and festive repasts in the open\nstreets, were looking about for a master, it was affirmed that a vessel\nhad left the Hague, bearing King Charles II. and his fortunes.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Monk to his officers, \"I am going to meet the\nlegitimate king. He who loves me will follow me.\" A burst of\nacclamations welcomed these words, which D'Artagnan did not hear without\nthe greatest delight.\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" said he to Monk, \"that is bold, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You will accompany me, will you not?\" said Monk.\n\n\"_Pardieu!_ general. But tell me, I beg, what you wrote by Athos, that\nis to say, the Comte de la Fere--you know--the day of our arrival?\"\n\n\"I have no secrets from you now,\" replied Monk. \"I wrote these words:\n'Sire, I expect your majesty in six weeks at Dover.'\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said D'Artagnan, \"I no longer say it is bold; I say it is well\nplayed; it is a fine stroke!\"\n\n\"You are something of a judge in such matters,\" replied Monk.\n\nAnd this was the only time the general had ever made an allusion to his\nvoyage to Holland.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXII. Athos and D'Artagnan meet once more at the Hostelry of\nthe Corne du Cerf.\n\nThe king of England made his _entree_ into Dover with great pomp, as he\nafterwards did in London. He had sent for his brothers; he had brought\nover his mother and sister. England had been for so long a time given\nup to herself--that is to say, to tyranny, mediocrity and nonsense--that\nthis return of Charles II., whom the English only knew as the son of\nthe man whose head they had cut off, was a festival for three\nkingdoms. Consequently, all the good wishes, all the acclamations\nwhich accompanied his return, struck the young king so forcibly that he\nstooped and whispered in the ear of James of York, his younger brother,\n\"In truth, James, it seems to have been our own fault that we were so\nlong absent from a country where we are so much beloved!\" The pageant\nwas magnificent. Beautiful weather favored the solemnity. Charles\nhad regained all his youth, all his good humor; he appeared to be\ntransfigured; hearts seemed to smile on him like the sun. Amongst this\nnoisy crowd of courtiers and worshipers, who did not appear to remember\nthey had conducted to the scaffold at Whitehall the father of the new\nking, a man, in the garb of a lieutenant of musketeers, looked, with\na smile upon his thin, intellectual lips, sometimes at the people\nvociferating their blessings, and sometimes at the prince, who pretended\nemotion, and who bowed most particularly to the women, whose _bouquets_\nfell beneath his horse's feet.\n\n\"What a fine trade is that of king!\" said this man, so completely\nabsorbed in contemplation that he stopped in the middle of the road,\nleaving the _cortege_ to file past. \"Now, there is, in good truth,\na prince all bespangled over with gold and diamonds, enamelled with\nflowers like a spring meadow; he is about to plunge his empty hands\ninto the immense coffer in which his now faithful--but so lately\nunfaithful--subjects have amassed one or two cartloads of ingots of\ngold. They cast _bouquets_ enough upon him to smother him; and yet, if\nhe had presented himself to them two months ago, they would have sent as\nmany bullets and balls at him as they now throw flowers. Decidedly it is\nworth something to be born in a certain sphere, with due respect to the\nlowly, who pretend that it is of very little advantage to them to be\nborn lowly.\" The _cortege_ continued to file on, and, with the king, the\nacclamations began to die away in the direction of the palace, which,\nhowever, did not prevent our officer from being pushed about.\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" continued the reasoner, \"these people tread upon my toes\nand look upon _me_ as of very little consequence, or rather of none at\nall, seeing that they are Englishmen and I am a Frenchman. If all these\npeople were asked,--'Who is M. d'Artagnan?' they would reply, '_Nescio\nvos_.' But let any one say to them, 'There is the king going by,' 'There\nis M. Monk going by,' they would run away, shouting,--'_Vive le roi!_'\n'_Vive M. Monk!_' till their lungs were exhausted. And yet,\" continued\nhe, surveying, with that look sometimes so keen and sometimes so proud,\nthe diminishing crowd,--\"and yet, reflect a little, my good people, on\nwhat your king has done, on what M. Monk has done, and then think what\nhas been done by this poor unknown, who is called M. d'Artagnan! It is\ntrue you do not know him, since he is here unknown, and that prevents\nyour thinking about the matter! But, bah! what matters it! All that does\nnot prevent Charles II. from being a great king, although he has been\nexiled twelve years, or M. Monk from being a great captain, although he\ndid make a voyage to Holland in a box. Well, then, since it is admitted\nthat one is a great king and the other a great captain,--'_Hurrah for\nKing Charles II.!_--_Hurrah for General Monk!_'\" And his voice mingled\nwith the voices of the hundreds of spectators, over which it sounded for\na moment. Then, the better to play the devoted man, he took off his hat\nand waved it in the air. Some one seized his arm in the very height of\nhis expansive loyalism. (In 1660 that was so termed which we now call\nroyalism.)\n\n\"Athos!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"you here!\" And the two friends seized each\nother's hands.\n\n\"You here!--and being here,\" continued the musketeer, \"you are not in\nthe midst of all these courtiers, my dear comte! What! you, the hero\nof the _fete_, you are not prancing on the left hand of the king, as\nM. Monk is prancing on the right? In truth, I cannot comprehend your\ncharacter, nor that of the prince who owes you so much!\"\n\n\"Always scornful, my dear D'Artagnan!\" said Athos. \"Will you never\ncorrect yourself of that vile habit?\"\n\n\"But you do not form part of the pageant?\"\n\n\"I do not, because I was not willing to do so.\"\n\n\"And why were you not willing?\"\n\n\"Because I am neither envoy nor ambassador, nor representative of the\nking of France; and it does not become me to exhibit myself thus near\nthe person of another king than the one God has given me for a master.\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_ you came very near to the person of the king, his father.\"\n\n\"That was another thing, my friend; he was about to die.\"\n\n\"And yet that which you did for him--\"\n\n\"I did it because it was my duty to do it. But you know I hate all\nostentation. Let King Charles II., then, who no longer stands in need of\nme, leave me to my rest, and the shadow; that is all I claim of him.\"\n\nD'Artagnan sighed.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" said Athos. \"One would say that this\nhappy return of the king to London saddens you, my friend; you who have\ndone at least as much for his majesty as I have.\"\n\n\"Have I not,\" replied D'Artagnan, with his Gascon laugh, \"have I not\ndone much for his majesty, without any one suspecting it?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but the king is well aware of it, my friend,\" cried Athos.\n\n\"He is aware of it!\" said the musketeer bitterly. \"By my faith! I did\nnot suspect so, and I was even a moment ago trying to forget it myself.\"\n\n\"But he, my friend, will not forget it, I will answer for him.\"\n\n\"You tell me that to console me a little, Athos.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_ for all the expense I incurred. I have ruined myself, my\nfriend, ruined myself for the restoration of this young prince who has\njust passed, cantering on his _isabelle_ colored horse.\"\n\n\"The king does not know you have ruined yourself, my friend; but he\nknows he owes you much.\"\n\n\"And say, Athos, does that advance me in any respect? for, to do you\njustice, you have labored nobly. But I--I who in appearance marred\nyour combinations, it was I who really made them succeed. Follow my\ncalculations closely; you might not have, by persuasions or mildness,\nconvinced General Monk, whilst I so roughly treated this dear general,\nthat I furnished your prince with an opportunity of showing himself\ngenerous: this generosity was inspired in him by the fact of my\nfortunate mistake, and Charles is paid by the restoration which Monk has\nbrought about.\"\n\n\"All that, my dear friend, is strikingly true,\" replied Athos.\n\n\"Well, strikingly true as it may be, it is not less true, my friend,\nthat I shall return--greatly beloved by M. Monk, who calls me _dear\ncaptain_ all day long, although I am neither dear to him nor a\ncaptain;--and much appreciated by the king, who has already forgotten my\nname;--it is not less true, I say, that I shall return to my beautiful\ncountry, cursed by the soldiers I had raised with the hopes of large\npay, cursed by the brave Planchet, of who I have borrowed a part of his\nfortune.\"\n\n\"How is that? What the devil had Planchet to do in all this?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, my friend; but this king, so spruce, so smiling, so adored,\nM. Monk fancies he has recalled him, you fancy you have supported him,\nI fancy I have brought him back, the people fancy they have reconquered\nhim, he himself fancies he has negotiated his restoration; and yet\nnothing of all this is true, for Charles II., king of England, Scotland,\nand Ireland, has been replaced upon the throne by a French grocer,\nwho lives in the Rue des Lombards, and is named Planchet. And such is\ngrandeur! 'Vanity!' says the Scripture: vanity, all is vanity.'\"\n\nAthos could not help laughing at this whimsical outbreak of his friend.\n\n\"My dear D'Artagnan,\" said he, pressing his hand affectionately, \"should\nyou not exercise a little more philosophy? Is it not some further\nsatisfaction to you to have saved my life as you did by arriving so\nfortunately with Monk, when those damned parliamentarians wanted to burn\nme alive?\"\n\n\"Well, but you, in some degree, deserved a little burning, my friend.\"\n\n\"How so? What, for having saved King Charles's million?\"\n\n\"What million?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is true! you never knew that, my friend; but you must not\nbe angry, for it was my secret. That word 'REMEMBER' which the king\npronounced upon the scaffold.\"\n\n\"And which means '_souviens-toi!_'\"\n\n\"Exactly. That was signified. 'Remember there is a million buried in the\nvaults of Newcastle Abbey, and that that million belongs to my son.'\"\n\n\"Ah! very well, I understand. But what I understand likewise, and what\nis very frightful, is, that every time his majesty Charles II. will\nthink of me, he will say to himself: 'There is the man who came very\nnear to making me lose my crown. Fortunately I was generous, great,\nfull of presence of mind.' That will be said by the young gentleman in a\nshabby black doublet, who came to the chateau of Blois, hat in hand, to\nask me if I would give him access to the king of France.\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan! D'Artagnan!\" said Athos, laying his hand on the shoulder of\nthe musketeer, \"you are unjust.\"\n\n\"I have a right to be so.\"\n\n\"No--for you are ignorant of the future.\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked his friend full in the face, and began to laugh. \"In\ntruth, my dear Athos,\" said he, \"you have some sayings so superb, that\nthey only belong to you and M. le Cardinal Mazarin.\"\n\nAthos frowned slightly.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" continued D'Artagnan, laughing, \"I beg your pardon\nif I have offended you. The future! _Nein!_ what pretty words are words\nthat promise, and how well they fill the mouth in default of other\nthings! _Mordioux!_ After having met with so many who promised,\nwhen shall I find one who will give? But, let that pass!\" continued\nD'Artagnan. \"What are you doing here, my dear Athos? Are you the king's\ntreasurer?\"\n\n\"How--why the king's treasurer?\"\n\n\"Well, since the king possess a million, he must want a treasurer.\nThe king of France, although he is not worth a sou, has still a\nsuperintendent of finance, M. Fouquet. It is true, that, in exchange, M.\nFouquet, they say, has a good number of millions of his own.\"\n\n\"Oh! our million was spent long ago,\" said Athos, laughing in his turn.\n\n\"I understand; it was frittered away in satin, precious stones, velvet,\nand feathers of all sorts and colors. All these princes and princesses\nstood in great need of tailors and dressmakers. Eh! Athos, do you\nremember what we fellows spent in equipping ourselves for the campaign\nof La Rochelle, and to make our appearance on horseback? Two or three\nthousand livres, by my faith! But a king's robe is the more ample; it\nwould require a million to purchase the stuff. At least, Athos, if you\nare not treasurer, you are on good footing at court.\"\n\n\"By the faith of a gentleman, I know nothing about it,\" said Athos,\nsimply.\n\n\"What! you know nothing about it?\"\n\n\"No! I have not seen the king since we left Dover.\"\n\n\"Then he has forgotten you, too! _Mordioux!_ That is shameful!\"\n\n\"His majesty has had so much business to transact.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried D'Artagnan, with one of those intelligent grimaces which he\nalone knew how to make, \"that is enough to make me recover my love for\nMonseigneur Giulio Mazarini. What, Athos! the king has not seen you\nsince then?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And you are not furious?\"\n\n\"I! why should I be? Do you imagine, my dear D'Artagnan, that it was on\nthe king's account I acted as I have done? I did not know the young man.\nI defended the father, who represented a principle--sacred in my eyes,\nand I allowed myself to be drawn towards the son from sympathy for this\nsame principle. Besides, he was a worthy knight, a noble creature, that\nfather; do you remember him?\"\n\n\"Yes; that is true; he was a brave, an excellent man, who led a sad\nlife, but made a fine end.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear D'Artagnan, understand this; to that king, to that man\nof heart, to that friend of my thoughts, if I durst venture to say so,\nI swore at the last hour to preserve faithfully the secret of a deposit\nwhich was to be transmitted to his son, to assist him in his hour of\nneed. This young man came to me; he described his destitution; he was\nignorant that he was anything to me save a living memory of his father.\nI have accomplished towards Charles II. what I promised Charles I.; that\nis all! Of what consequence is it to me, then, whether he be grateful or\nnot? It is to myself I have rendered a service, by relieving myself of\nthis responsibility, and not to him.\"\n\n\"Well, I have always said,\" replied D'Artagnan, with a sigh, \"that\ndisinterestedness was the finest thing in the world.\"\n\n\"Well, and you, my friend,\" resumed Athos, \"are you not in the same\nsituation as myself? If I have properly understood your words, you\nallowed yourself to be affected by the misfortunes of this young man;\nthat, on your part, was much greater than it was upon mine, for I had a\nduty to fulfill; whilst you were under no obligation to the son of the\nmartyr. You had not, on your part, to pay him the price of that precious\ndrop of blood which he let fall upon my brow, through the floor of the\nscaffold. That which made you act was heart alone--the noble and good\nheart which you possess beneath your apparent skepticism and sarcastic\nirony; you have engaged the fortune of a servitor, and your own, I\nsuspect, my benevolent miser! and your sacrifice is not acknowledged!\nOf what consequence is it? You wish to repay Planchet his money. I can\ncomprehend that, my friend: for it is not becoming in a gentleman\nto borrow from his inferior, without returning to him principal and\ninterest. Well, I will sell La Fere if necessary, and if not, some\nlittle farm. You shall pay Planchet, and there will be enough, believe\nme, of corn left in my granaries for us two and Raoul. In this way, my\nfriend, you will be under obligations to nobody but yourself; and, if\nI know you well, it will not be a small satisfaction to your mind to be\nable to say, 'I have made a king!' Am I right?\"\n\n\"Athos! Athos!\" murmured D'Artagnan, thoughtfully, \"I have told you\nmore than once that the day on which you will preach I shall attend the\nsermon; the day on which you will tell me there is a hell--_Mordioux!_ I\nshall be afraid of the gridiron and the pitch-forks. You are better than\nI, or rather, better than anybody, and I only acknowledge the possession\nof one quality, and that is, of not being jealous. Except that defect,\ndamme, as the English say, if I have not all the rest.\"\n\n\"I know no one equal to D'Artagnan,\" replied Athos; \"but here we\nare, having quietly reached the house I inhabit. Will you come in, my\nfriend?\"\n\n\"Eh! why this is the tavern of the Corne du Cerf, I think,\" said\nD'Artagnan.\n\n\"I confess I chose it on purpose. I like old acquaintances; I like to\nsit down on that place, whereon I sank, overcome by fatigue, overwhelmed\nby despair, when you returned on the 31st of January.\"\n\n\"After having discovered the abode of the masked executioner? Yes, that\nwas a terrible day!\"\n\n\"Come in, then,\" said Athos, interrupting him.\n\nThey entered the large apartment, formerly the common one. The tavern,\nin general, and this room in particular, had undergone great changes;\nthe ancient host of the musketeers, having become tolerably rich for an\ninnkeeper, had closed his shop, and make of this room of which we were\nspeaking, a store-room for colonial provisions. As for the rest of the\nhouse, he let it ready furnished to strangers. It was with unspeakable\nemotion D'Artagnan recognized all the furniture of the chamber of the\nfirst story; the wainscoting, the tapestries, and even that geographical\nchart which Porthos had so fondly studied in his moments of leisure.\n\n\"It is eleven years ago,\" cried D'Artagnan. \"_Mordioux!_ it appears to\nme a century!\"\n\n\"And to me but a day,\" said Athos. \"Imagine the joy I experience, my\nfriend, in seeing you there, in pressing your hand, in casting from me\nsword and dagger, and tasting without mistrust this glass of sherry.\nAnd, oh! what still further joy it would be, if our two friends were\nthere, at the two corners of the table, and Raoul, my beloved Raoul, on\nthe threshold, looking at us with his large eyes, at once so brilliant\nand so soft!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said D'Artagnan, much affected, \"that is true. I approve\nparticularly of the first part of your thought; it is very pleasant to\nsmile there where we have so legitimately shuddered in thinking that\nfrom one moment to another M. Mordaunt might appear upon the landing.\"\n\nAt this moment the door opened, and D'Artagnan, brave as he was, could\nnot restrain a slight movement of fright. Athos understood him, and,\nsmiling,--\n\n\"It is our host,\" said he, \"bringing me a letter.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" said the good man; \"here is a letter for your honor.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Athos, taking the letter without looking at it. \"Tell\nme, my dear host, if you do not remember this gentleman?\"\n\nThe old man raised his head, and looked attentively at D'Artagnan.\n\n\"No,\" said he.\n\n\"It is,\" said Athos, \"one of those friends of whom I have spoken to you,\nand who lodged here with me eleven years ago.\"\n\n\"Oh! but,\" said the old man, \"so many strangers have lodged here!\"\n\n\"But we lodged here on the 30th of January, 1649,\" added Athos,\nbelieving he should stimulate the lazy memory of the host by this\nremark.\n\n\"That is very possible,\" replied he, smiling; \"but it is so long ago!\"\nand he bowed, and went out.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said D'Artagnan--\"perform exploits, accomplish revolutions,\nendeavor to engrave your name in stone or bronze with strong swords!\nthere is something more rebellious, more hard, more forgetful than iron,\nbronze, or stone, and that is, the brain of a lodging-house keeper who\nhas grown rich in the trade;--he does not know me! Well, I should have\nknown him, though.\"\n\nAthos, smiling at his friend's philosophy, unsealed his letter.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"a letter from Parry.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said D'Artagnan; \"read it, my friend, read it! No doubt it\ncontains news.\"\n\n        Athos shook his head, and read:\n\n\"MONSIEUR LE COMTE.--The king has experienced much regret at not seeing\nyou to-day beside him, at his entrance. His majesty commands me to say\nso, and to recall him to your memory. His majesty will expect you this\nevening, at the palace of St. James, between nine and ten o'clock.\n\n\"I am, respectfully, monsieur le comte, your honor's very humble and\nvery obedient servant,--PARRY.\"\n\n\"You see, my dear D'Artagnan,\" said Athos, \"we must not despair of the\nhearts of kings.\"\n\n\"Not despair! you are right to say so!\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh! my dear, very dear friend,\" resumed Athos, whom the almost\nimperceptible bitterness of D'Artagnan had not escaped. \"Pardon me! can\nI have unintentionally wounded my best comrade?\"\n\n\"You are mad, Athos, and to prove it, I shall conduct you to the palace;\nto the very gate, I mean; the walk will do me good.\"\n\n\"You shall go in with me, my friend; I will speak to his majesty.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" replied D'Artagnan, with true pride, free from all mixture;\n\"if there is anything worse than begging yourself, it is making others\nbeg for you. Come, let us go, my friend, the walk will be charming; on\nthe way I shall show you the house of M. Monk, who has detained me\nwith him. A beautiful house, by my faith. Being a general in England is\nbetter than being a marechal in France, please to know.\"\n\nAthos allowed himself to be led along, quite saddened by D'Artagnan's\nforced attempts at gayety. The whole city was in a state of joy; the two\nfriends were jostled at every moment by enthusiasts who required them,\nin their intoxication, to cry out, \"Long live good King Charles!\"\nD'Artagnan replied by a grunt, and Athos by a smile. They arrived thus\nin front of Monk's house, before which, as we have said, they had to\npass on their way to St. James's.\n\nAthos and D'Artagnan said but little on the road, for the simple reason\nthat they would have had so many things to talk about if they had\nspoken. Athos thought that by speaking he should evince satisfaction,\nand that might wound D'Artagnan. The latter feared that in speaking he\nshould allow some little bitterness to steal into his words which would\nrender his company unpleasant to his friend. It was a singular emulation\nof silence between contentment and ill-humor. D'Artagnan gave way\nfirst to that itching at the tip of his tongue which he so habitually\nexperienced.\n\n\"Do you remember, Athos,\" said he, \"the passage of the 'Memoires de\nD'Aubigny,' in which that devoted servant, a Gascon like myself, poor as\nmyself, and, I was going to add, brave as myself, relates instances of\nthe meanness of Henry IV.? My father always told me, I remember, that\nD'Aubigny was a liar. But, nevertheless, examine how all the princes,\nthe issue of the great Henry, keep up the character of the race.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Athos, \"the kings of France misers? You are mad, my\nfriend.\"\n\n\"Oh! you are so perfect yourself, you never agree to the faults of\nothers. But, in reality, Henry IV. was covetous, Louis XIII., his son,\nwas so likewise; we know something of that, don't we? Gaston carried\nthis vice to exaggeration, and has made himself, in this respect,\nhated by all who surround him. Henriette, poor woman, might well be\navaricious, she who did not eat every day, and could not warm herself\nevery winter; and that is an example she has given to her son Charles\nII., grandson of the great Henry IV., who is as covetous as his mother\nand his grandfather. See if I have well traced the genealogy of the\nmisers?\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan, my friend,\" cried Athos, \"you are very rude towards that\neagle race called the Bourbons.\"\n\n\"Eh! and I have forgotten the best instance of all--the other grandson\nof the Bernais, Louis XIV., my ex-master. Well, I hope he is miserly\nenough, he who would not lend a million to his brother Charles! Good! I\nsee you are beginning to be angry. Here we are, by good luck, close to\nmy house, or rather that of my friend, M. Monk.\"\n\n\"My dear D'Artagnan, you do not make me angry, you make me sad; it is\ncruel, in fact, to see a man of your deserts out of the position his\nservices ought to have acquired; it appears to me, my dear friend, that\nyour name is as radiant as the greatest names in war and diplomacy. Tell\nme if the Luynes, the Ballegardes, and the Bassompierres have merited,\nas we have, fortunes and honors? You are right, my friend, a hundred\ntimes right.\"\n\nD'Artagnan sighed, and preceded his friend under the porch of he mansion\nMonk inhabited, at the extremity of the city. \"Permit me,\" said he, \"to\nleave my purse at home; for if in the crowd those clever pickpockets of\nLondon, who are much boasted of, even in Paris, were to steal from\nme the remainder of my poor crowns, I should not be able to return to\nFrance. Now, content I left France, and wild with joy I should return\nto it, seeing that all my prejudices of former days against England have\nreturned, accompanied by many others.\"\n\nAthos made no reply.\n\n\"So, then, my dear friend, one second, and I will follow you,\" said\nD'Artagnan. \"I know you are in a hurry to go yonder to receive your\nreward, but, believe me, I am not less eager to partake of your joy,\nalthough from a distance. Wait for me.\" And D'Artagnan was already\npassing through the vestibule, when a man, half servant, half soldier,\nwho filled in Monk's establishment the double function of porter and\nguard, stopped our musketeer, saying to him in English:\n\n\"I beg your pardon, my Lord d'Artagnan!\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the latter: \"what is it? Is the general going to dismiss\nme? I only needed to be expelled by him.\"\n\nThese words, spoken in French, made no impression upon the person to\nwhom they were addressed, and who himself only spoke an English mixed\nwith the rudest Scots. But Athos was grieved at them, for he began to\nthink D'Artagnan was not wrong.\n\nThe Englishman showed D'Artagnan a letter: \"From the general,\" said he.\n\n\"Aye! that's it, my dismissal!\" replied the Gascon. \"Must I read it,\nAthos?\"\n\n\"You must be deceived,\" said Athos, \"or I know no more honest people in\nthe world but you and myself.\"\n\nD'Artagnan shrugged his shoulders and unsealed the letter, while the\nimpassible Englishman held for him a large lantern, by the light of\nwhich he was enabled to read it.\n\n\"Well, what is the matter?\" said Athos, seeing the countenance of the\nreader change.\n\n\"Read it yourself,\" said the musketeer.\n\nAthos took the paper and read:\n\n\"MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN.--The king regrets very much you did not come to\nSt. Paul's with his _cortege_. He missed you, as I also have missed\nyou, my dear captain. There is but one means of repairing all this. His\nmajesty expects me at nine o'clock at the palace of St. James's: will\nyou be there at the same time with me? His gracious majesty appoints\nthat hour for an audience he grants you.\"\n\nThis letter was from Monk.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIII. The Audience.\n\n\"Well?\" cried Athos with a mild look of reproach, when D'Artagnan had\nread the letter addressed to him by Monk.\n\n\"Well!\" said D'Artagnan, red with pleasure, and a little with shame,\nat having so hastily accused the king and Monk. \"This is a\npoliteness,--which leads to nothing, it is true, but yet it is a\npoliteness.\"\n\n\"I had great difficulty in believing the young prince ungrateful,\" said\nAthos.\n\n\"The fact is, that his present is still too near his past,\" replied\nD'Artagnan; \"after all, everything to the present moment proved me\nright.\"\n\n\"I acknowledge it, my dear friend, I acknowledge it. Ah! there is your\ncheerful look returned. You cannot think how delighted I am.\"\n\n\"Thus you see,\" said D'Artagnan, \"Charles II. receives M. Monk at nine\no'clock; he will receive me at ten; it is a grand audience, of the sort\nwhich at the Louvre are called 'distributions of court holy water.'\nCome, let us go and place ourselves under the spout, my dear friend!\nCome along.\"\n\nAthos replied nothing; and both directed their steps, at a quick pace,\ntowards the palace of St. James's, which the crowd still surrounded,\nto catch, through the windows, the shadows of the courtiers, and the\nreflection of the royal person. Eight o'clock was striking when the\ntwo friends took their places in the gallery filled with courtiers and\npoliticians. Every one looked at these simply-dressed men in foreign\ncostumes, at these two noble heads so full of character and meaning.\nOn their side, Athos and D'Artagnan, having with two glances taken the\nmeasure of the whole assembly, resumed their chat.\n\nA great noise was suddenly heard at the extremity of the gallery,--it\nwas General Monk, who entered, followed by more than twenty officers,\nall eager for a smile, as only the evening before he was master of all\nEngland, and a glorious to-morrow was looked to, for the restorer of the\nStuart family.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Monk, turning round, \"henceforward I beg you to\nremember that I am no longer anything. Lately I commanded the principal\narmy of the republic; now that army is the king's, into whose hands I am\nabout to surrender, at his command, my power of yesterday.\"\n\nGreat surprise was painted on all the countenances, and the circle of\nadulators and suppliants which surrounded Monk an instant before, was\nenlarged by degrees, and ended by being lost in the large undulations\nof the crowd. Monk was going into the ante-chamber as others did.\nD'Artagnan could not help remarking this to the Comte de la Fere,\nwho frowned on beholding it. Suddenly the door of the royal apartment\nopened, and the young king appeared, preceded by two officers of his\nhousehold.\n\n\"Good evening, gentlemen,\" said he. \"Is General Monk here?\"\n\n\"I am here, sire,\" replied the old general.\n\nCharles stepped hastily towards him, and seized his hand with the\nwarmest demonstration of friendship. \"General,\" said the king, aloud,\n\"I have just signed your patent,--you are Duke of Albemarle; and my\nintention is that no one shall equal you in power and fortune in this\nkingdom, where--the noble Montrose excepted--no one has equaled you in\nloyalty, courage, and talent. Gentlemen, the duke is commander of our\narmies of land and sea; pay him your respects, if you please, in that\ncharacter.\"\n\nWhilst every one was pressing round the general, who received all this\nhomage without losing his impassibility for an instant, D'Artagnan said\nto Athos: \"When one thinks that this duchy, this commander of the land\nand sea forces, all these grandeurs, in a word, have been shut up in a\nbox six feet long and three feet wide--\"\n\n\"My friend,\" replied Athos, \"much more imposing grandeurs are confined\nin boxes still smaller,--and remain there forever.\"\n\nAll at once Monk perceived the two gentlemen, who held themselves aside\nuntil the crowd had diminished; he made himself a passage towards\nthem, so that he surprised them in the midst of their philosophical\nreflections. \"Were you speaking of me?\" sad he, with a smile.\n\n\"My lord,\" replied Athos, \"we were speaking likewise of God.\"\n\nMonk reflected for a moment, and then replied gayly: \"Gentlemen, let\nus speak a little of the king likewise, if you please; for you have, I\nbelieve, an audience of his majesty.\"\n\n\"At nine o'clock,\" said Athos.\n\n\"At ten o'clock,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Let us go into this closet at once,\" replied Monk, making a sign to his\ntwo companions to precede him; but to that neither would consent.\n\nThe king, during this discussion so characteristic of the French, had\nreturned to the center of the gallery.\n\n\"Oh! my Frenchmen!\" said he, in that tone of careless gayety which,\nin spite of so much grief and so many crosses, he had never lost. \"My\nFrenchmen! my consolation!\" Athos and D'Artagnan bowed.\n\n\"Duke, conduct these gentlemen into my study. I am at your service,\nmessieurs,\" added he in French. And he promptly expedited his court, to\nreturn to his Frenchmen, as he called them. \"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said\nhe, as he entered his closet, \"I am glad to see you again.\"\n\n\"Sire, my joy is at its height, at having the honor to salute your\nmajesty in your own palace of St. James's.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, you have been willing to render me a great service, and I owe\nyou my gratitude for it. If I did not fear to intrude upon the rights of\nour command general, I would offer you some post worthy of you near our\nperson.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"I have quitted the service of the king of\nFrance, making a promise to my prince not to serve any other king.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said Charles, \"I am sorry to hear that; I should like to do\nmuch for you; I like you very much.\"\n\n\"Sire--\"\n\n\"But, let us see,\" said Charles with a smile, \"if we cannot make you\nbreak your word. Duke, assist me. If you were offered, that is to say,\nif I offered you the chief command of my musketeers?\" D'Artagnan bowed\nlower than before.\n\n\"I should have the regret to refuse what your gracious majesty would\noffer me,\" said he; \"a gentleman has but his word, and that word, as\nI have had the honor to tell your majesty, is engaged to the king of\nFrance.\"\n\n\"We shall say no more about it, then,\" said the king, turning\ntowards Athos, and leaving D'Artagnan plunged in the deepest pangs of\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Ah! I said so!\" muttered the musketeer. \"Words! words! Court holy\nwater! Kings have always a marvelous talent for offering us that which\nthey know we will not accept, and in appearing generous without risk. So\nbe it!--triple fool that I was to have hoped for a moment!\"\n\nDuring this time, Charles took the hand of Athos. \"Comte,\" said he, \"you\nhave been to me a second father; the services you have rendered to me\nare above all price. I have, nevertheless, thought of a recompense. You\nwere created by my father a Knight of the Garter--that is an order which\nall the kings of Europe cannot bear; by the queen regent, Knight of the\nHoly Ghost--which is an order not less illustrious; I join to it that\nof the Golden Fleece sent me by the king of France, to whom the king of\nSpain, his father-in-law, gave two on the occasion of his marriage; but\nin return, I have a service to ask of you.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Athos, with confusion, \"the Golden Fleece for me! when\nthe king of France is the only person in my country who enjoys that\ndistinction?\"\n\n\"I wish you to be in your country and all others the equal of all those\nwhom sovereigns have honored with their favor,\" said Charles, drawing\nthe chain from his neck; \"and I am sure, comte, my father smiles on me\nfrom his grave.\"\n\n\"It is unaccountably strange,\" said D'Artagnan to himself, whilst\nhis friend, on his knees, received the eminent order which the king\nconferred on him--\"it is almost incredible that I have always seen\nshowers of prosperity fall upon all who surrounded me, and that not a\ndrop ever reached me! If I were a jealous man, it would be enough to\nmake one tear one's hair, _parole d'honneur!_\"\n\nAthos rose from his knees, and Charles embraced him tenderly. \"General!\"\nsaid he to Monk--then stopping, with a smile, \"pardon me, duke, I mean.\nNo wonder if I make a mistake; the word duke is too short for me, I\nalways seek some title to lengthen it. I should wish to see you so near\nmy throne, that I might say to you, as to Louis XIV., my brother! Oh!\nI have it; and you will almost be my brother, for I make you viceroy of\nIreland and Scotland, my dear duke. So, after that fashion, henceforward\nI shall not make a mistake.\"\n\nThe duke seized the hand of the king, but without enthusiasm, without\njoy, as he did everything. His heart, however, had been moved by this\nlast favor. Charles, by skillfully husbanding his generosity, had given\nthe duke time to wish, although he might not have wished for so much as\nwas given him.\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" grumbled D'Artagnan, \"there is the shower beginning again!\nOh! it is enough to turn one's brain!\" and he turned away with an air so\nsorrowful and so comically piteous, that the king, who caught it, could\nnot restrain a smile. Monk was preparing to leave the room, to take\nleave of Charles.\n\n\"What! my trusty and well-beloved!\" said the king to the duke, \"are you\ngoing?\"\n\n\"With your majesty's permission, for in truth I am weary. The emotions\nof the day have worn me out; I stand in need of rest.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the king, \"you are not going without M. d'Artagnan, I hope.\"\n\n\"Why not, sire?\" said the old warrior.\n\n\"Well! you know very well why,\" said the king.\n\nMonk looked at Charles with astonishment.\n\n\"Oh! it may be possible; but if you forget, you, M. d'Artagnan, do not.\"\n\nAstonishment was painted on the face of the musketeer.\n\n\"Well, then, duke,\" said the king, \"do you not lodge with M.\nd'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"I had the honor of offering M. d'Artagnan a lodging; yes, sire.\"\n\n\"That idea is your own, and yours solely?\"\n\n\"Mine and mine only; yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Well! but it could not be otherwise--the prisoner always lodges with\nhis conqueror.\"\n\nMonk colored in his turn. \"Ah! that is true,\" said he; \"I am M.\nd'Artagnan's prisoner.\"\n\n\"Without doubt, duke, since you are not yet ransomed; but have no care\nof that; it was I who took you out of M. d'Artagnan's hands, and it is I\nwho will pay your ransom.\"\n\nThe eyes of D'Artagnan regained their gayety and their brilliancy. The\nGascon began to understand. Charles advanced towards him.\n\n\"The general,\" said he, \"is not rich, and cannot pay you what he is\nworth. I am richer, certainly; but now that he is a duke, and if not a\nking, almost a king, he is worth a sum I could not perhaps pay. Come, M.\nd'Artagnan, be moderate with me; how much do I owe you?\"\n\nD'Artagnan, delighted at the turn things were taking, but not for a\nmoment losing his self-possession, replied,--\"Sire, your majesty has no\noccasion to be alarmed. When I had the good fortune to take his grace,\nM. Monk was only a general; it is therefore only a general's ransom that\nis due to me. But if the general will have the kindness to deliver me\nhis sword, I shall consider myself paid; for there is nothing in the\nworld but the general's sword which is worth as much as himself.\"\n\n\"Odds fish! as my father said,\" cried Charles. \"That is a gallant\nproposal, and a gallant man, is he not, duke?\"\n\n\"Upon my honor, yes, sire,\" and he drew his sword. \"Monsieur,\" said\nhe to D'Artagnan, \"here is what you demand. Many have handled a better\nblade; but however modest mine may be, I have never surrendered it to\nany one.\"\n\nD'Artagnan received with pride the sword which had just made a king.\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" cried Charles II.; \"what a sword that has restored me to my\nthrone--to go out of the kingdom--and not, one day, to figure among the\ncrown jewels! No, on my soul! that shall not be! Captain d'Artagnan, I\nwill give you two hundred thousand livres for your sword! If that is too\nlittle, say so.\"\n\n\"It is too little, sire,\" replied D'Artagnan, with inimitable\nseriousness. \"In the first place, I do not at all wish to sell it; but\nyour majesty desires me to do so, and that is an order. I obey, then,\nbut the respect I owe to the illustrious warrior who hears me, commands\nme to estimate a third more the reward of my victory. I ask then three\nhundred thousand livres for the sword, or I shall give it to your\nmajesty for nothing.\" And taking it by the point he presented it to the\nking. Charles broke into hilarious laughter.\n\n\"A gallant man, and a merry companion! Odds fish! is he not, duke? is he\nnot, comte? He pleases me! I like him! Here, Chevalier d'Artagnan, take\nthis.\" And going to the table, he took a pen and wrote an order upon his\ntreasurer for three hundred thousand livres.\n\nD'Artagnan took it, and turning gravely towards Monk: \"I have still\nasked too little, I know,\" said he, \"but believe me, your grace, I would\nrather have died that allow myself to be governed by avarice.\"\n\nThe king began to laugh again, like the happiest cockney of his kingdom.\n\n\"You will come and see me again before you go, chevalier?\" said he; \"I\nshall want to lay in a stock of gayety now my Frenchmen are leaving me.\"\n\n\"Ah! sire, it will not be with the gayety as with the duke's sword; I\nwill give it to your majesty gratis,\" replied D'Artagnan, whose feet\nscarcely seemed to touch the ground.\n\n\"And you, comte,\" added Charles, turning towards Athos, \"come again,\nalso; I have an important message to confide to you. Your hand, duke.\"\nMonk pressed the hand of the king.\n\n\"Adieu! gentlemen,\" said Charles, holding out each of his hands to the\ntwo Frenchmen, who carried them to their lips.\n\n\"Well,\" said Athos, when they were out of the palace, \"are you\nsatisfied?\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said D'Artagnan, wild with joy, \"I have not yet returned from\nthe treasurer's--a shutter may fall upon my head.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIV. Of the Embarrassment of Riches.\n\nD'Artagnan lost no time, and as soon as the thing was suitable and\nopportune, he paid a visit to the lord treasurer of his majesty. He had\nthen the satisfaction to exchange a piece of paper, covered with very\nugly writing, for a prodigious number of crowns, recently stamped with\nthe _effigies_ of his very gracious majesty Charles II.\n\nD'Artagnan easily controlled himself: and yet, on this occasion, he\ncould not help evincing a joy which the reader will perhaps comprehend,\nif he deigns to have some indulgence for a man who, since his birth, had\nnever seen so many pieces and rolls of pieces juxta-placed in an order\ntruly agreeable to the eye. The treasurer placed all the rolls in bags,\nand closed each bag with a stamp sealed with the arms of England, a\nfavor which treasurers do not grant to everybody. Then, impassible,\nand just as polite as he ought to be towards a man honored with the\nfriendship of the king, he said to D'Artagnan:\n\n\"Take away your money, sir.\" _Your money!_ These words made a thousand\nchords vibrate in the heart of D'Artagnan, which he had never felt\nbefore. He had the bags packed in a small cart, and returned home\nmeditating deeply. A man who possessed three hundred thousand livres\ncan no longer expect to wear a smooth brow; a wrinkle for every hundred\nthousand livres is not too much.\n\nD'Artagnan shut himself up, ate no dinner, closed his door to everybody,\nand, with a lighted lamp, and a loaded pistol on the table, he watched\nall night, ruminating upon the means of preventing these lovely crowns,\nwhich from the coffers of the king had passed into his coffers, from\npassing from his coffers into the pockets of any thief whatever. The\nbest means discovered by the Gascon was to inclose his treasure, for\nthe present, under locks so solid that no wrist could break them, and\nso complicated that no master-key could open them. D'Artagnan remembered\nthat the English are masters in mechanics and conservative industry;\nand he determined to go in the morning in search of a mechanic who would\nsell him a strong box. He did not go far; Master Will Jobson, dwelling\nin Piccadilly, listened to his propositions, comprehended his wishes,\nand promised to make him a safety lock that should relieve him from all\nfuture fear.\n\n\"I will give you,\" said he, \"a piece of mechanism entirely new. At the\nfirst serious attempt upon your lock, an invisible plate will open\nof itself and vomit forth a pretty copper bullet the weight of a\nmark--which will knock down the intruder, and not with a loud report.\nWhat do you think of it?\"\n\n\"I think it very ingenuous,\" cried D'Artagnan; \"the little copper bullet\npleases me mightily. So now, sir mechanic, the terms?\"\n\n\"A fortnight for the execution, and fifteen hundred livres payable on\ndelivery,\" replied the artisan.\n\nD'Artagnan's brow darkened. A fortnight was delay enough to allow the\nthieves of London time to remove all occasion for the strong box. As\nto the fifteen hundred livres--that would be paying too dear for what a\nlittle vigilance would procure him for nothing.\n\n\"I will think of it,\" said he; \"thank you, sir.\" And he returned home\nat full speed; nobody had yet touched his treasure. That same day Athos\npaid a visit to his friend and found him so thoughtful that he could not\nhelp expressing his surprise.\n\n\"How is this?\" said he, \"you are rich and not gay--you, who were so\nanxious for wealth!\"\n\n\"My friend, the pleasures to which we are not accustomed oppress us more\nthan the griefs with which we are familiar. Give me your opinion, if you\nplease. I can ask you, who have always had money: when we have money,\nwhat do we do with it?\"\n\n\"That depends.\"\n\n\"What have you done with yours, seeing that it has not made you a miser\nor a prodigal? For avarice dries up the heart, and prodigality drowns\nit--is that not so?\"\n\n\"Fabricius could not have spoken more justly. But in truth, my money has\nnever been a burden to me.\"\n\n\"How so? Do you place it out at interest?\"\n\n\"No; you know I have a tolerably handsome house; and that house composes\nthe better part of my property.\"\n\n\"I know it does.\"\n\n\"So that you can be as rich as I am, and, indeed, more rich, whenever\nyou like, by the same means.\"\n\n\"But your rents,--do you lay them by?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What do you think of a chest concealed in a wall?\"\n\n\"I never made use of such a thing.\"\n\n\"Then you must have some confidant, some safe man of business who pays\nyou interest at a fair rate.\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Good heavens! what do you do with it, then?\"\n\n\"I spend all I have, and I only have what I spend, my dear D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Ah! that may be. But you are something of a prince; fifteen or sixteen\nthousand livres melt away between your fingers; and then you have\nexpenses and appearances--\"\n\n\"Well, I don't see why you should be less of a noble than I am, my\nfriend; your money would be quite sufficient.\"\n\n\"Three hundred thousand livres! Two-thirds too much!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon--did you not tell me?--I thought I heard you say--I\nfancied you had a partner--\"\n\n\"Ah! _Mordioux!_ that's true,\" cried D'Artagnan, coloring; \"there is\nPlanchet. I had forgotten Planchet, upon my life! Well! there are my\nthree hundred thousand livres broken into. That's a pity! it was a round\nsum, and sounded well. That is true, Athos; I am no longer rich. What a\nmemory you have!\"\n\n\"Tolerably good; yes, thank God!\"\n\n\"The worthy Planchet!\" grumbled D'Artagnan; \"his was not a bad dream!\nWhat a speculation! _Peste!_ Well! what is said is said.\"\n\n\"How much are you to give him?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said D'Artagnan, \"he is not a bad fellow; I shall arrange matters\nwith him. I have had a great deal of trouble, you see, and expenses; all\nthat must be taken into account.\"\n\n\"My dear friend, I can depend on you, and have no fear for the worthy\nPlanchet; his interests are better in your hands than in his own. But\nnow that you have nothing more to do here, we shall depart, if you\nplease. You can go and thank his majesty, ask if he has any commands,\nand in six days we may be able to get sight of the towers of Notre\nDame.\"\n\n\"My friend, I am most anxious to be off, and will go at once and pay my\nrespects to the king.\"\n\n\"I,\" said Athos, \"am going to call upon some friends in the city, and\nshall then be at your service.\"\n\n\"Will you lend me Grimaud?\"\n\n\"With all my heart. What do you want to do with him?\"\n\n\"Something very simple, and which will not fatigue him; I shall only beg\nhim to take charge of my pistols, which lie there on the table near that\ncoffer.\"\n\n\"Very well!\" replied Athos, imperturbably.\n\n\"And he will not stir, will he?\"\n\n\"Not more than the pistols themselves.\"\n\n\"Then I shall go and take leave of his majesty. _Au revoir!_\"\n\nD'Artagnan arrived at St. James's, where Charles II., who was busy\nwriting, kept him in the ante-chamber a full hour. Whilst walking about\nin the gallery, from the door to the window, from the window to the\ndoor, he thought he saw a cloak like Athos's cross the vestibule; but at\nthe moment he was going to ascertain if it were he, the usher summoned\nhim to his majesty's presence. Charles II. rubbed his hands while\nreceiving the thanks of our friend.\n\n\"Chevalier,\" said he, \"you are wrong to express gratitude to me; I have\nnot paid you a quarter of the value of the history of the box into which\nyou put the brave general--the excellent Duke of Albemarle, I mean.\" And\nthe king laughed heartily.\n\nD'Artagnan did not think it proper to interrupt his majesty, and he\nbowed with much modesty.\n\n\"_A propos_,\" continued Charles, \"do you think my dear Monk has really\npardoned you?\"\n\n\"Pardoned me! yes, I hope so, sire!\"\n\n\"Eh!--but it was a cruel trick! Odds fish! to pack up the first\npersonage of the English revolution like a herring. In your place I\nwould not trust him, chevalier.\"\n\n\"But, sire--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know very well Monk calls you his friend, but he has too\npenetrating an eye not to have a memory, and too lofty a brow not to be\nvery proud, you know, _grande supercilium_.\"\n\n\"I shall certainly learn Latin,\" said D'Artagnan to himself.\n\n\"But stop,\" cried the merry monarch, \"I must manage your reconciliation;\nI know how to set about it; so--\"\n\nD'Artagnan bit his mustache. \"Will your majesty permit me to tell you\nthe truth?\"\n\n\"Speak, chevalier, speak.\"\n\n\"Well, sire, you alarm me greatly. If your majesty undertakes the\naffair, as you seem inclined to do, I am a lost man; the duke will have\nme assassinated.\"\n\nThe king burst into a fresh roar of laughter, which changed D'Artagnan's\nalarm into downright terror.\n\n\"Sire, I beg you to allow me to settle this matter myself, and if your\nmajesty has no further need of my services--\"\n\n\"No, chevalier. What, do you want to leave us?\" replied Charles, with a\nhilarity that grew more and more alarming.\n\n\"If your majesty has no more commands for me.\"\n\nCharles became more serious.\n\n\"One single thing. See my sister, the Lady Henrietta. Do you know her?\"\n\n\"No, sire, but--an old soldier like me is not an agreeable spectacle for\na young and gay princess.\"\n\n\"Ah! but my sister must know you; she must in case of need have you to\ndepend upon.\"\n\n\"Sire, every one that is dear to your majesty will be sacred to me.\"\n\n\"Very well!--Parry! Come here, Parry!\"\n\nThe side door opened and Parry entered, his face beaming with pleasure\nas soon as he saw D'Artagnan.\n\n\"What is Rochester doing?\" said the king.\n\n\"He is on the canal with the ladies,\" replied Parry.\n\n\"And Buckingham?\"\n\n\"He is there also.\"\n\n\"That is well. You will conduct the chevalier to Villiers; that is\nthe Duke of Buckingham, chevalier; and beg the duke to introduce M.\nd'Artagnan to the Princess Henrietta.\"\n\nParry bowed and smiled to D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Chevalier,\" continued the king, \"this is your parting audience; you can\nafterwards set out as soon as you please.\"\n\n\"Sire, I thank you.\"\n\n\"But be sure you make your peace with Monk!\"\n\n\"Oh, sire--\"\n\n\"You know there is one of my vessels at your disposal?\"\n\n\"Sire, you overpower me; I cannot think of putting your majesty's\nofficers to inconvenience on my account.\"\n\nThe king slapped D'Artagnan upon the shoulder.\n\n\"Nobody will be inconvenienced on your account, chevalier, but for that\nof an ambassador I am about sending to France, and to whom you will\nwillingly serve as a companion, I fancy, for you know him.\"\n\nD'Artagnan appeared astonished.\n\n\"He is a certain Comte de la Fere,--whom you call Athos,\" added the\nking; terminating the conversation, as he had begun it, by a joyous\nburst of laughter. \"Adieu, chevalier, adieu. Love me as I love you.\" And\nthereupon, making a sign to Parry to ask if there were any one waiting\nfor him in the adjoining closet, the king disappeared into that closet,\nleaving the chevalier perfectly astonished by this singular audience.\nThe old man took his arm in a friendly way, and led him towards the\ngarden.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXV. On the Canal.\n\n\nUpon the green waters of the canal bordered with marble, upon which time\nhad already scattered black spots and tufts of mossy grass, there\nglided majestically a long, flat bark adorned with the arms of England,\nsurmounted by a dais, and carpeted with long damasked stuffs, which\ntrailed their fringes in the water. Eight rowers, leaning lazily to\ntheir oars, made it move upon the canal with the graceful slowness of\nthe swans, which, disturbed in their ancient possessions by the approach\nof the bark, looked from a distance at this splendid and noisy pageant.\nWe say noisy--for the bark contained four guitar and lute players, two\nsingers, and several courtiers, all sparkling with gold and precious\nstones, and showing their white teeth in emulation of each other, to\nplease the Lady Henrietta Stuart, grand-daughter of Henry IV., daughter\nof Charles I., and sister of Charles II., who occupied the seat of honor\nunder the dais of the bark. We know this young princess, we have seen\nher at the Louvre with her mother, wanting wood, wanting bread, and fed\nby the _coadjuteur_ and the parliament. She had, therefore, like her\nbrothers, passed through an uneasy youth; then, all at once, she had\njust awakened from a long and horrible dream, seated on the steps of\na throne, surrounded by courtiers and flatterers. Like Mary Stuart on\nleaving prison, she aspired not only to life and liberty, but to power\nand wealth.\n\nThe Lady Henrietta, in growing, had attained remarkable beauty, which\nthe recent restoration had rendered celebrated. Misfortune had taken\nfrom her the luster of pride, but prosperity had restored it to her.\nShe was resplendent, then, in her joy and her happiness,--like those\nhot-house flowers which, forgotten during a frosty autumn night, have\nhung their heads, but which on the morrow, warmed once more by the\natmosphere in which they were born, rise again with greater splendor\nthan ever. Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, son of him who played so\nconspicuous a part in the early chapters of this history,--Villiers of\nBuckingham, a handsome cavalier, melancholy with women, a jester\nwith men,--and Wilmot, Lord Rochester, a jester with both sexes,\nwere standing at this moment before the Lady Henrietta, disputing the\nprivilege of making her smile. As to that young and beautiful princess,\nreclining upon a cushion of velvet bordered with gold, her hands hanging\nlistlessly so as to dip in the water, she listened carelessly to the\nmusicians without hearing them, and heard the two courtiers without\nappearing to listen to them.\n\nThis Lady Henrietta--this charming creature--this woman who joined the\ngraces of France to the beauties of England, not having yet loved, was\ncruel in her coquetry. The smile, then,--that innocent favor of young\ngirls,--did not even lighten her countenance; and if, at times, she did\nraise her eyes, it was to fasten them upon one or other of the cavaliers\nwith such a fixity, that their gallantry, bold as it generally was, took\nthe alarm, and became timid.\n\nIn the meanwhile the boat continued its course, the musicians made a\ngreat noise, and the courtiers began, like them, to be out of breath.\nBesides, the excursion became doubtless monotonous to the princess,\nfor all at once, shaking her head with an air of impatience,--\"Come\ngentlemen,--enough of this;--let us land.\"\n\n\"Ah, madam,\" said Buckingham, \"we are very unfortunate! We have not\nsucceeded in making the excursion agreeable to your royal highness.\"\n\n\"My mother expects me,\" replied the princess; \"and I must frankly admit,\ngentlemen, I am bored.\" And whilst uttering this cruel word, Henrietta\nendeavored to console by a look each of the two young men, who appeared\nterrified at such frankness. The look produced its effect--the two faces\nbrightened; but immediately, as if the royal coquette thought she had\ndone too much for simple mortals, she made a movement, turned her back\non both her adorers, and appeared plunged in a reverie in which it was\nevident they had no part.\n\nBuckingham bit his lips with anger, for he was truly in love with the\nLady Henrietta, and, in that case, took everything in a serious light.\nRochester bit his lips likewise; but his wit always dominated over\nhis heart, it was purely and simply to repress a malicious smile. The\nprincess was then allowing the eyes she turned from the young nobles to\nwander over the green and flowery turf of the park, when she perceived\nParry and D'Artagnan at a distance.\n\n\"Who is coming yonder?\" said she.\n\nThe two young men turned round with the rapidity of lightning.\n\n\"Parry,\" replied Buckingham; \"nobody but Parry.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Rochester, \"but I think he has a companion.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the princess, at first with languor, but then,--\"What mean\nthose words, 'Nobody but Parry;' say, my lord?\"\n\n\"Because, madam,\" replied Buckingham, piqued, \"because the faithful\nParry, the wandering Parry, the eternal Parry, is not, I believe, of\nmuch consequence.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, duke. Parry--the wandering Parry, as you call\nhim--has always wandered in the service of my family, and the sight of\nthat old man always gives me satisfaction.\"\n\nThe Lady Henrietta followed the usual progress of pretty women,\nparticularly coquettish women; she passed from caprice to\ncontradiction;--the gallant had undergone the caprice, the courtier\nmust bend beneath the contradictory humor. Buckingham bowed, but made no\nreply.\n\n\"It is true, madam,\" said Rochester, bowing in his turn, \"that Parry is\nthe model of servants; but, madam, he is no longer young, and we laugh\nonly when we see cheerful objects. Is an old man a gay object?\"\n\n\"Enough, my lord,\" said the princess, coolly; \"the subject of\nconversation is unpleasant to me.\"\n\nThen, as if speaking to herself, \"It is really unaccountable,\" said she,\n\"how little regard my brother's friends have for his servants.\"\n\n\"Ah, madam,\" cried Buckingham, \"your royal highness pierces my heart\nwith a dagger forged by your own hands.\"\n\n\"What is the meaning of that speech, which is turned so like a French\nmadrigal, duke? I do not understand it.\"\n\n\"It means, madam, that you yourself, so good, so charming, so sensible,\nyou have laughed sometimes--smiled, I should say--at the idle prattle of\nthat good Parry, for whom your royal highness to-day entertains such a\nmarvelous susceptibility.\"\n\n\"Well, my lord, if I have forgotten myself so far,\" said Henrietta, \"you\ndo wrong to remind me of it.\" And she made a sign of impatience. \"The\ngood Parry wants to speak to me, I believe: please order them to row to\nthe shore, my Lord Rochester.\"\n\nRochester hastened to repeat the princess's command; and a moment later\nthe boat touched the bank.\n\n\"Let us land, gentlemen,\" said Henrietta, taking the arm which Rochester\noffered her, although Buckingham was nearer to her, and had presented\nhis. Then Rochester, with an ill-dissembled pride, which pierced the\nheart of the unhappy Buckingham through and through, led the princess\nacross the little bridge which the rowers had cast from the royal boat\nto the shore.\n\n\"Which way will your highness go?\" asked Rochester.\n\n\"You see, my lord, towards that good Parry, who is wandering, as my lord\nof Buckingham says, and seeking me with eyes weakened by the tears he\nhas shed over our misfortunes.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Rochester, \"how sad your royal highness is to-day;\nin truth we seem ridiculous fools to you, madam.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself, my lord,\" interrupted Buckingham with vexation;\n\"for my part, I displease her royal highness to such a degree, that I\nappear absolutely nothing to her.\"\n\nNeither Rochester nor the princess made any reply; Henrietta only urged\nher companion more quickly on. Buckingham remained behind, and took\nadvantage of this isolation to give himself up to his anger; he bit his\nhandkerchief so furiously that it was soon in shreds.\n\n\"Parry, my good Parry,\" said the princess, with her gentle voice, \"come\nhither. I see you are seeking me, and I am waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Ah, madam,\" said Rochester, coming charitably to the help of his\ncompanion, who had remained, as we have said, behind, \"if Parry cannot\nsee your royal highness, the man who follows him is a sufficient\nguide, even for a blind man; for he has eyes of flame. That man is a\ndouble-lamped lantern.\"\n\n\"Lighting a very handsome martial countenance,\" said the princess,\ndetermined to be as ill-natured as possible. Rochester bowed. \"One of\nthose vigorous soldiers' heads seen nowhere but in France,\" added the\nprincess, with the perseverance of a woman sure of impunity.\n\nRochester and Buckingham looked at each other, as much as to say,--\"What\ncan be the matter with her?\"\n\n\"See, my lord of Buckingham, what Parry wants,\" said Henrietta. \"Go!\"\n\nThe young man, who considered this order as a favor, resumed his\ncourage, and hastened to meet Parry, who, followed by D'Artagnan,\nadvanced slowly on account of his age. D'Artagnan walked slowly but\nnobly, as D'Artagnan, doubled by the third of a million, ought to walk,\nthat is to say, without conceit or swagger, but without timidity. When\nBuckingham, very eager to comply with the desire of the princess, who\nhad seated herself on a marble bench, as if fatigued with the few steps\nshe had gone,--when Buckingham, we say, was at a distance of only a few\npaces from Parry, the latter recognized him.\n\n\"Ah! my lord!\" cried he, quite out of breath, \"will your grace obey the\nking?\"\n\n\"In what, Mr. Parry?\" said the young man, with a kind of coolness\ntempered by a desire to make himself agreeable to the princess.\n\n\"Well, his majesty begs your grace to present this gentleman to her\nroyal highness the Princess Henrietta.\"\n\n\"In the first place, what is the gentleman's name?\" said the duke,\nhaughtily.\n\nD'Artagnan, as we know, was easily affronted, and the Duke of\nBuckingham's tone displeased him. He surveyed the courtier from head to\nfoot, and two flashes beamed from beneath his bent brows. But, after\na struggle,--\"Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan, my lord,\" replied he,\nquietly.\n\n\"Pardon me, sir, that teaches me your name, but nothing more.\"\n\n\"You mean--\"\n\n\"I mean I do not know you.\"\n\n\"I am more fortunate than you, sir,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"for I have\nhad the honor of knowing your family, and particularly my lord Duke of\nBuckingham, your illustrious father.\"\n\n\"My father?\" said Buckingham. \"Well, I think I now remember. Monsieur le\nChevalier d'Artagnan, do you say?\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed. \"In person,\" said he.\n\n\"Pardon me, but are you one of those Frenchmen who had secret relations\nwith my father?\"\n\n\"Exactly, my lord duke, I am one of those Frenchmen.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, permit me to say that it was strange my father never heard\nof you during his lifetime.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, but he heard of me at the moment of his death: it was I\nwho sent to him, through the hands of the _valet de chambre_ of Anne of\nAustria, notice of the dangers which threatened him; unfortunately, it\ncame too late.\"\n\n\"Never mind, monsieur,\" said Buckingham. \"I understand now, that, having\nhad the intention of rendering a service to the father, you have come to\nclaim the protection of the son.\"\n\n\"In the first place, my lord,\" replied D'Artagnan, phlegmatically, \"I\nclaim the protection of no man. His majesty, Charles II., to whom I have\nhad the honor of rendering some services--I may tell you, my lord, my\nlife has been passed in such occupations--King Charles II., then, who\nwishes to honor me with some kindness, desires me to be presented to\nher royal highness the Princess Henrietta, his sister, to whom I shall,\nperhaps, have the good fortune to be of service hereafter. Now, the king\nknew that you at this moment were with her royal highness, and sent me\nto you. There is no other mystery, I ask absolutely nothing of you; and\nif you will not present me to her royal highness, I shall be compelled\nto do without you, and present myself.\"\n\n\"At least, sir,\" said Buckingham, determined to have the last word, \"you\nwill not refuse me an explanation provoked by yourself.\"\n\n\"I never refuse, my lord,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"As you have had relations with my father, you must be acquainted with\nsome private details?\"\n\n\"These relations are already far removed from us, my lord--for you were\nnot then born--and for some unfortunate diamond studs, which I received\nfrom his hands and carried back to France, it is really not worth while\nawakening so many remembrances.\"\n\n\"Ah! sir,\" said Buckingham, warmly, going up to D'Artagnan, and holding\nout his hand to him, \"it is you, then--you whom my father sought\neverywhere and who had a right to expect so much from us.\"\n\n\"To expect, my lord, in truth, that is my _forte_; all my life I have\nexpected.\"\n\nAt this moment, the princess, who was tired of not seeing the stranger\napproach her, arose and came towards them.\n\n\"At least, sir,\" said Buckingham, \"you shall not wait for the\npresentation you claim of me.\"\n\nThen turning towards the princess and bowing: \"Madam,\" said the young\nman, \"the king, your brother, desires me to have the honor of presenting\nto your royal highness, Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"In order that your royal highness may have, in case of need, a firm\nsupport and a sure friend,\" added Parry. D'Artagnan bowed.\n\n\"You have still something to say, Parry,\" replied Henrietta, smiling\nupon D'Artagnan, while addressing the old servant.\n\n\"Yes, madam, the king desires you to preserve religiously in your memory\nthe name and merit of M. d'Artagnan, to whom his majesty owes, he says,\nthe recovery of his kingdom.\" Buckingham, the princess, and Rochester\nlooked at each other.\n\n\"That,\" said D'Artagnan, \"is another little secret, of which, in all\nprobability, I shall not boast to his majesty's son, as I have done to\nyou with respect to the diamond studs.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" said Buckingham, \"monsieur has just, for the second time,\nrecalled to my memory an event which excites my curiosity to such a\ndegree, that I shall venture to ask your permission to take him to one\nside for a moment, to converse in private.\"\n\n\"Do, my lord,\" said the princess; \"but restore to the sister, as quickly\nas possible, this friend so devoted to the brother.\" And she took the\narm of Rochester, whilst Buckingham took that of D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh! tell me, chevalier,\" said Buckingham, \"all that affair of the\ndiamonds, which nobody knows in England, not even the son of him who was\nthe hero of it.\"\n\n\"My lord, one person alone had a right to relate all that affair, as you\ncall it, and that was your father; he thought it proper to be silent, I\nmust beg you to allow me to be so likewise.\" And D'Artagnan bowed like a\nman upon whom it was evident no entreaties could prevail.\n\n\"Since it is so, sir,\" said Buckingham, \"pardon my indiscretion, I beg\nyou; and if, at any time, I should go into France--\" and he turned round\nto take a last look at the princess, who took but little notice of\nhim, totally occupied as she was, or appeared to be, with Rochester.\nBuckingham sighed.\n\n\"Well?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I was saying that if, any day, I were to go to France--\"\n\n\"You will go, my lord,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I shall answer for that.\"\n\n\"And how so?\"\n\n\"Oh, I have strange powers of prediction; if I do predict anything I am\nseldom mistaken. If, then, you do come to France?\"\n\n\"Well, then, monsieur, you, of whom kings ask that valuable friendship\nwhich restores crowns to them, I will venture to beg of you a little of\nthat great interest you took in my father.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"believe me, I shall deem myself highly\nhonored if, in France, you remember having seen me here. And now\npermit--\"\n\nThen, turning towards the princess: \"Madam,\" said he, \"your royal\nhighness is a daughter of France; and in that quality I hope to see you\nagain in Paris. One of my happy days will be on that on which your royal\nhighness shall give me any command whatever, thus proving to me that you\nhave not forgotten the recommendations of your august brother.\" And he\nbowed respectfully to the young princess, who gave him her hand to kiss\nwith a right royal grace.\n\n\"Ah! madam,\" said Buckingham, in a subdued voice, \"what can a man do to\nobtain a similar favor from your royal highness?\"\n\n\"_Dame!_ my lord,\" replied Henrietta, \"ask Monsieur d'Artagnan; he will\ntell you.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVI. How D'Artagnan drew, as a Fairy would have done, a\nCountry-Seat from a Deal Box.\n\nThe king's words regarding the wounded pride of Monk had inspired\nD'Artagnan with no small portion of apprehension. The lieutenant had\nhad, all his life, the great art of choosing his enemies; and when he\nhad found them implacable and invincible, it was when he had not been\nable, under any pretense, to make them otherwise. But points of view\nchange greatly in the course of a life. It is a magic lantern, of which\nthe eye of man every year changes the aspects. It results that from the\nlast day of a year on which we saw white, to the first day of the year\non which we shall see black, there is the interval of but a single\nnight.\n\nNow, D'Artagnan, when he left Calais with his ten scamps, would have\nhesitated as little in attacking a Goliath, a Nebuchadnezzar, or a\nHolofernes, as he would in crossing swords with a recruit or caviling\nwith a land-lady. Then he resembled the sparrow-hawk, which,\nwhen fasting, will attack a ram. Hunger is blind. But D'Artagnan\nsatisfied--D'Artagnan rich--D'Artagnan a conqueror--D'Artagnan proud of\nso difficult a triumph--D'Artagnan had too much to lose not to reckon,\nfigure by figure, with probable misfortune.\n\nHis thoughts were employed, therefore, all the way on the road from his\npresentation, with one thing, and that was, how he should conciliate a\nman like Monk, a man whom Charles himself, king as he was, conciliated\nwith difficulty; for, scarcely established, the protected might again\nstand in need of the protector, and would, consequently, not refuse\nhim, such being the case, the petty satisfaction of transporting M.\nd'Artagnan, or of confining him in one of the Middlesex prisons, or\ndrowning him a little on his passage from Dover to Boulogne. Such sorts\nof satisfaction kings are accustomed to render to viceroys without\ndisagreeable consequences.\n\nIt would not be at all necessary for the king to be active in that\n_contrepartie_ of the play in which Monk should take his revenge. The\npart of the king would be confined to simply pardoning the viceroy of\nIreland all he should undertake against D'Artagnan. Nothing more was\nnecessary to place the conscience of the Duke of Albemarle at rest than\na _te absolvo_ said with a laugh, or the scrawl of \"Charles the King,\"\ntraced at the foot of a parchment; and with these two words pronounced,\nand these two words written, poor D'Artagnan was forever crushed beneath\nthe ruins of his imagination.\n\nAnd then, a thing sufficiently disquieting for a man with such foresight\nas our musketeer, he found himself alone; and even the friendship of\nAthos could not restore his confidence. Certainly if the affair had only\nconcerned a free distribution of sword-thrusts, the musketeer would have\ncounted upon his companion; but in delicate dealings with a king, when\nthe _perhaps_ of an unlucky chance should arise in justification of Monk\nor of Charles of England, D'Artagnan knew Athos well enough to be sure\nhe would give the best possible coloring to the loyalty of the survivor,\nand would content himself with shedding floods of tears on the tomb of\nthe dead, supposing the dead to be his friend, and afterwards composing\nhis epitaph in the most pompous superlatives.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" thought the Gascon; and this thought was the result of the\nreflections which he had just whispered to himself and which we have\nrepeated aloud--\"decidedly, I must be reconciled with M. Monk, and\nacquire proof of his perfect indifference for the past. If, and God\nforbid it should be so! he is still sulky and reserved in the expression\nof this sentiment, I shall give my money to Athos to take away with him,\nand remain in England just long enough to unmask him, then, as I have\na quick eye and a light foot, I shall notice the first hostile sign;\nto decamp or conceal myself at the residence of my lord Buckingham, who\nseems a good sort of devil at the bottom, and to whom, in return for his\nhospitality, I shall relate all that history of the diamonds, which can\nnow compromise nobody but an old queen, who need not be ashamed, after\nbeing the wife of a miserly creature like Mazarin, of having formerly\nbeen the mistress of a handsome nobleman like Buckingham. _Mordioux!_\nthat is the thing, and this Monk shall not get the better of me. Eh? and\nbesides I have an idea!\"\n\nWe know that, in general, D'Artagnan was not wanting in ideas; and\nduring this soliloquy, D'Artagnan buttoned his vest up to the chin, and\nnothing excited his imagination like this preparation for a combat of\nany kind, called _accinction_ by the Romans. He was quite heated when he\nreached the mansion of the Duke of Albemarle. He was introduced to the\nviceroy with a promptitude which proved that he was considered as one of\nthe household. Monk was in his business-closet.\n\n\"My lord,\" said D'Artagnan, with that expression of frankness which the\nGascon knew so well how to assume, \"my lord, I have come to ask your\ngrace's advice!\"\n\nMonk, as closely buttoned up morally as his antagonist was physically,\nreplied: \"Ask, my friend;\" and his countenance presented an expression\nnot less open than that of D'Artagnan.\n\n\"My lord, in the first place, promise me secrecy and indulgence.\"\n\n\"I promise you all you wish. What is the matter? Speak!\"\n\n\"It is, my lord, that I am not quite pleased with the king.\"\n\n\"Indeed! And on what account, my dear lieutenant?\"\n\n\"Because his majesty gives way sometimes to jests very compromising for\nhis servants; and jesting, my lord, is a weapon that seriously wounds\nmen of the sword, as we are.\"\n\nMonk did all in his power not to betray his thought, but D'Artagnan\nwatched him with too close attention not to detect an almost\nimperceptible flush upon his face. \"Well, now, for my part,\" said he,\nwith the most natural air possible, \"I am not an enemy of jesting, my\ndear Monsieur d'Artagnan; my soldiers will tell you that even many times\nin camp, I listened very indifferently, and with a certain pleasure,\nto the satirical songs which the army of Lambert passed into mine,\nand which, certainly, would have caused the ears of a general more\nsusceptible than I am to tingle.\"\n\n\"Oh, my lord,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I know you are a complete man; I know\nyou have been, for a long time, placed above human miseries; but\nthere are jests and jests of a certain kind, which have the power of\nirritating me beyond expression.\"\n\n\"May I inquire what kind, my friend?\"\n\n\"Such as are directed against my friends or against people I respect, my\nlord!\"\n\nMonk made a slight movement, which D'Artagnan perceived. \"Eh! and in\nwhat,\" asked Monk, \"in what can the stroke of a pin which scratches\nanother tickle your skin? Answer me that.\"\n\n\"My lord, I can explain it to you in a single sentence; it concerns\nyou.\"\n\nMonk advanced a single step towards D'Artagnan. \"Concerns me?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, and this is what I cannot explain; but that arises, perhaps, from\nmy want of knowledge of his character. How can the king have the\nheart to jest about a man who has rendered him so many and such great\nservices? How can one understand that he should amuse himself in setting\nby the ears a lion like you with a gnat like me?\"\n\n\"I cannot conceive that in any way,\" said Monk.\n\n\"But so it is. The king, who owed me a reward, might have rewarded me as\na soldier, without contriving that history of the ransom, which affects\nyou, my lord.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Monk, laughing: \"it does not affect me in any way, I can\nassure you.\"\n\n\"Not as regards me, I can understand; you know me, my lord, I am so\ndiscreet that the grave would appear a babbler compared to me; but--do\nyou understand, my lord?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Monk, with persistent obstinacy.\n\n\"If another knew the secret which I know--\"\n\n\"What secret?\"\n\n\"Eh! my lord, why, that unfortunate secret of Newcastle.\"\n\n\"Oh! the million of the Comte de la Fere?\"\n\n\"No, my lord, no; the enterprise made upon your grace's person.\"\n\n\"It was well played, chevalier, that is all, and no more is to be said\nabout it: you are a soldier, both brave and cunning, which proves that\nyou unite the qualities of Fabius and Hannibal. You employed your means,\nforce and cunning: there is nothing to be said against that: I ought to\nhave been on guard.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes; I know, my lord, and I expected nothing less from your\npartiality; so that if it were only the abduction in itself, _Mordioux!_\nthat would be nothing; but there are--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The circumstances of that abduction.\"\n\n\"What circumstances?\"\n\n\"Oh! you know very well what I mean, my lord.\"\n\n\"No, curse me if I do.\"\n\n\"There is--in truth, it is difficult to speak it.\"\n\n\"There is?\"\n\n\"Well, there is that devil of a box!\"\n\nMonk colored visibly. \"Well, I have forgotten it.\"\n\n\"Deal box,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"with holes for the nose and mouth.\nIn truth, my lord, all the rest was well; but the box, the box! that\nwas really a coarse joke.\" Monk fidgeted about in his chair. \"And,\nnotwithstanding my having done that,\" resumed D'Artagnan, \"I, a soldier\nof fortune, it was quite simple, because by the side of that action, a\nlittle inconsiderate I admit, which I committed, but which the gravity\nof the case may excuse, I am circumspect and reserved.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Monk, \"believe me, I know you well, Monsieur d'Artagnan, and\nI appreciate you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan never took his eyes off Monk; studying all which passed in\nthe mind of the general, as he prosecuted _his idea_. \"But it does not\nconcern me,\" resumed he.\n\n\"Well, then, who does it concern?\" said Monk, who began to grow a little\nimpatient.\n\n\"It relates to the king, who will never restrain his tongue.\"\n\n\"Well! and suppose he should say all he knows?\" said Monk, with a degree\nof hesitation.\n\n\"My lord,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"do not dissemble, I implore you, with\na man who speaks so frankly as I do. You have a right to feel your\nsusceptibility excited, however benignant it may be. What, the devil!\nit is not the place for a man like you, a man who plays with crowns and\nscepters as a Bohemian plays with his balls; it is not the place of a\nserious man, I said, to be shut up in a box like some freak of natural\nhistory; for you must understand it would make all your enemies ready to\nburst with laughter, and you are so great, so noble, so generous, that\nyou must have many enemies. This secret is enough to set half the human\nrace laughing, if you were represented in that box. It is not decent to\nhave the second personage in the kingdom laughed at.\"\n\nMonk was quite out of countenance at the idea of seeing himself\nrepresented in this box. Ridicule, as D'Artagnan had judiciously\nforeseen, acted upon him in a manner which neither the chances of war,\nthe aspirations of ambition, nor the fear of death had been able to do.\n\n\"Good,\" thought the Gascon, \"he is frightened: I am safe.\"\n\n\"Oh! as to the king,\" said Monk, \"fear nothing, my dear Monsieur\nd'Artagnan; the king will not jest with Monk, I assure you!\"\n\nThe momentary flash of his eye was noticed by D'Artagnan. Monk lowered\nhis tone immediately: \"The king,\" continued he, \"is of too noble a\nnature, the king's heart is too high to allow him to wish ill to those\nwho do him good.\"\n\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried D'Artagnan. \"I am entirely of your grace's\nopinion with regard to his heart, but not as to his head--it is good,\nbut it is trifling.\"\n\n\"The king will not trifle with Monk, be assured.\"\n\n\"Then you are quite at ease, my lord?\"\n\n\"On that side, at least! yes, perfectly!\"\n\n\"Oh! I understand you; you are at ease as far as the king is concerned?\"\n\n\"I have told you I was.\"\n\n\"But you are not so much so on my account?\"\n\n\"I thought I had told you that I had faith in your loyalty and\ndiscretion.\"\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt, but you must remember one thing--\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That I was not alone, that I had companions; and what companions!\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, I know them.\"\n\n\"And, unfortunately, my lord, they know you, too!\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well; they are yonder, at Boulogne, waiting for me.\"\n\n\"And you fear--\"\n\n\"Yes, I fear that in my absence--_Parbleu!_ If I were near them, I could\nanswer for their silence.\"\n\n\"Was I not right in saying that the danger, if there was any danger,\nwould not come from his majesty, however disposed he may be to jest,\nbut from your companions, as you say? To be laughed at by a king may be\ntolerable, but by the horse-boys and scamps of the army! Damn it!\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand, that would be unbearable; that is why, my lord, I\ncame to say,--do you not think it would be better for me to set out for\nFrance as soon as possible?\"\n\n\"Certainly, if you think your presence--\"\n\n\"Would impose silence upon those scoundrels? Oh! I am sure of that, my\nlord.\"\n\n\"Your presence will not prevent the report from spreading, if the tale\nhas already transpired.\"\n\n\"Oh! it has not transpired, my lord, I will wager. At all events, be\nassured that I am determined upon one thing.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"To blow out the brains of the first who shall have propagated that\nreport, and of the first who has heard it. After which I shall return to\nEngland to seek an asylum, and perhaps employment with your grace.\"\n\n\"Oh, come back! come back!\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, my lord, I am acquainted with nobody here but your\ngrace, and if I should no longer find you, or if you should have\nforgotten me in your greatness?\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" replied Monk; \"you are a superior\nman, full of intelligence and courage; you deserve all the good fortune\nthis world can bring you; come with me into Scotland, and, I swear to\nyou, I shall arrange for you a fate which all may envy.\"\n\n\"Oh! my lord, that is impossible. At present I have a sacred duty to\nperform; I have to watch over your glory, I have to prevent a low jester\nfrom tarnishing in the eyes of our contemporaries--who knows? in the\neyes of posterity--the splendor of your name.\"\n\n\"Of posterity, Monsieur d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Doubtless. It is necessary, as regards posterity, that all the\ndetails of that history should remain a mystery; for, admit that this\nunfortunate history of the deal box should spread, and it should be\nasserted that you had not re-established the king loyally, and of\nyour own free will, but in consequence of a compromise entered into at\nScheveningen between you two. It would be vain for me to declare how the\nthing came about, for though I know I should not be believed, it would\nbe said that I had received my part of the cake, and was eating it.\"\n\nMonk knitted his brow.--\"Glory, honor, probity!\" said he, \"you are but\nempty words.\"\n\n\"Mist!\" replied D'Artagnan; \"nothing but mist, through which nobody can\nsee clearly.\"\n\n\"Well, then, go to France, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Monk; \"go,\nand to render England more attractive and agreeable to you, accept a\nremembrance of me.\"\n\n\"What now?\" thought D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I have on the banks of the Clyde,\" continued Monk, \"a little house in\na grove, cottage as it is called here. To this house are attached a\nhundred acres of land. Accept it as a souvenir.\"\n\n\"Oh, my lord!--\"\n\n\"Faith! you will be there in your own home, and that will be the place\nof refuge you spoke of just now.\"\n\n\"For me to be obliged to your lordship to such an extent! Really, your\ngrace, I am ashamed.\"\n\n\"Not at all, not at all, monsieur,\" replied Monk, with an arch smile;\n\"it is I who shall be obliged to you. And,\" pressing the hand of the\nmusketeer, \"I shall go and draw up the deed of gift,\"--and he left the\nroom.\n\nD'Artagnan looked at him as he went out with something of a pensive and\neven an agitated air.\n\n\"After all,\" said he, \"he is a brave man. It is only a sad reflection\nthat it is from fear of me, and not affection that he acts thus. Well,\nI shall endeavor that affection may follow.\" Then, after an instant's\ndeeper reflection,--\"Bah!\" said he, \"to what purpose? He is an\nEnglishman.\" And he in turn went out, a little confused after the\ncombat.\n\n\"So,\" said he, \"I am a land-owner! But how the devil am I to share\nthe cottage with Planchet? Unless I give him the land, and I take the\nchateau, or the he takes the house and I--nonsense! M. Monk will never\nallow me to share a house he has inhabited, with a grocer. He is too\nproud for that. Besides, why should I say anything about it to him? It\nwas not with the money of the company I have acquired that property, it\nwas with my mother-wit alone; it is all mine, then. So, now I will go\nand find Athos.\" And he directed his steps towards the dwelling of the\nComte de la Fere.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVII. How D'Artagnan regulated the \"Assets\" of the Company\nbefore he established its \"Liabilities.\"\n\n\"Decidedly,\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"I have struck a good vein.\nThat star which shines once in the life of every man, which shone for\nJob and Iris, the most unfortunate of the Jews and the poorest of the\nGreeks, is come at last to shine on me. I will commit no folly, I will\ntake advantage of it; it comes quite late enough to find me reasonable.\"\n\nHe supped that evening, in very good humor, with his friend Athos;\nhe said nothing to him about the expected donation, but he could not\nforbear questioning his friend, while eating, about country produce,\nsowing, and planting. Athos replied complacently, as he always did. His\nidea was that D'Artagnan wished to become a land-owner, only he could\nnot help regretting, more than once, the absence of the lively humor\nand amusing sallies of the cheerful companion of former days. In fact,\nD'Artagnan was so absorbed, that, with his knife, he took advantage of\nthe grease left at the bottom of his plate, to trace ciphers and make\nadditions of surprising rotundity.\n\nThe order, or rather license, for their embarkation, arrived at Athos's\nlodgings that evening. While this paper was remitted to the comte,\nanother messenger brought to D'Artagnan a little bundle of parchments,\nadorned with all the seals employed in setting off property deeds in\nEngland. Athos surprised him turning over the leaves of these different\nacts which established the transmission of property. The prudent\nMonk--others would say the generous Monk--had commuted the donation\ninto a sale, and acknowledged the receipt of the sum of fifteen thousand\ncrowns as the price of the property ceded. The messenger was gone.\nD'Artagnan still continued reading, Athos watched him with a smile.\nD'Artagnan, surprising one of those smiles over his shoulder, put the\nbundle in its wrapper.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Oh! not at all, my friend,\" replied the lieutenant, \"I shall tell\nyou--\"\n\n\"No, don't tell me anything, I beg you; orders are things so sacred,\nthat to one's brother, one's father, the person charged with such orders\nshould never open his mouth. Thus I, who speak to you, and love you more\ntenderly than brother, father, or all the world--\"\n\n\"Except your Raoul?\"\n\n\"I shall love Raoul still better when he shall be a man, and I shall\nhave seen him develop himself in all the phases of his character and his\nactions--as I have seen you, my friend.\"\n\n\"You said, then, that you had an order likewise, and that you would not\ncommunicate it to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear D'Artagnan.\"\n\nThe Gascon sighed. \"There was a time,\" said he, \"when you would have\nplaced that order open upon the table, saying, 'D'Artagnan, read this\nscrawl to Porthos, Aramis, and to me.'\"\n\n\"That is true. Oh! that was the time of youth, confidence, the generous\nseason when the blood commands, when it is warmed by feeling!\"\n\n\"Well! Athos, will you allow me to tell you?\"\n\n\"Speak, my friend!\"\n\n\"That delightful time, that generous season, that ruling by warm blood,\nwere all very fine things, no doubt: but I do not regret them at all.\nIt is absolutely like the period of studies. I have constantly met with\nfools who would boast of the days of pensums, ferules, and crusts of dry\nbread. It is singular, but I never loved all that; for my part, however\nactive and sober I might be (you know if I was so, Athos), however\nsimple I might appear in my clothes, I would not the less have preferred\nthe braveries and embroideries of Porthos to my little perforated\ncassock, which gave passage to the wind in winter and the sun in summer.\nI should always, my friend, mistrust him who would pretend to prefer\nevil to good. Now, in times past all went wrong with me, and every month\nfound a fresh hole in my cassock and in my skin, a gold crown less in my\npoor purse; of that execrable time of small beer and see-saw, I regret\nabsolutely nothing, nothing, nothing save our friendship; for within me\nI have a heart, and it is a miracle that heart has not been dried up by\nthe wind of poverty which passed through all the holes of my cloak, or\npierced by the swords of all shapes which passed through the holes in my\npoor flesh.\"\n\n\"Do not regret our friendship,\" said Athos, \"that will only die with\nourselves. Friendship is composed, above all things, of memories and\nhabits, and if you have just now made a little satire upon mine, because\nI hesitate to tell you the nature of my mission into France--\"\n\n\"Who! I?--Oh! heavens! if you knew, my dear friend, how indifferent all\nthe missions of the world will henceforth become to me!\" And he laid his\nhand upon the parchment in his vest pocket.\n\nAthos rose from the table and called the host in order to pay the\nreckoning.\n\n\"Since I have known you, my friend,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I have never\ndischarged the reckoning. Porthos often did, Aramis sometimes, and you,\nyou almost always drew out your purse with the dessert. I am now rich,\nand should like to try if it is heroic to pay.\"\n\n\"Do so,\" said Athos, returning his purse to his pocket.\n\nThe two friends then directed their steps towards the port, not,\nhowever, without D'Artagnan's frequently turning round to watch the\ntransportation of his dear crowns. Night had just spread her thick veil\nover the yellow waters of the Thames; they heard those noises of casks\nand pulleys, the preliminaries of preparing to sail which had so many\ntimes made the hearts of the musketeers beat when the dangers of the sea\nwere the least of those they were going to face. This time they were\nto embark on board a large vessel which awaited them at Gravesend,\nand Charles II., always delicate in small affairs, had sent one of\nhis yachts, with twelve men of his Scots guard, to do honor to the\nambassador he was sending to France. At midnight the yacht had deposited\nits passengers on board the vessel, and at eight o'clock in the\nmorning, the vessel landed the ambassador and his friend on the wharf at\nBoulogne. Whilst the comte, with Grimaud, was busy procuring horses\nto go straight to Paris, D'Artagnan hastened to the hostelry where,\naccording to his orders, his little army was to wait for him. These\ngentlemen were at breakfast upon oysters, fish, and spiced brandy, when\nD'Artagnan appeared. They were all very gay, but not one of them had\nyet exceeded the bounds of reason. A hurrah of joy welcomed the general.\n\"Here I am,\" said D'Artagnan, \"the campaign is ended. I am come to bring\neach his supplement of pay, as agreed upon.\" Their eyes sparkled.\n\"I will lay a wager there are not, at this moment, a hundred crowns\nremaining in the purse of the richest among you.\"\n\n\"That is true!\" cried they in chorus.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said D'Artagnan, \"then, this is the last order. The treaty\nof commerce has been concluded, thanks to our _coup-de-main_ which made\nus masters of the most skillful financier of England, for now I am\nat liberty to confess to you that the man we had to carry off was the\ntreasurer of General Monk.\"\n\nThis word treasurer produced a certain effect on his army. D'Artagnan\nobserved that the eyes of Menneville alone did not evince perfect faith.\n\"This treasurer,\" he continued, \"I conveyed to a neutral territory,\nHolland; I forced him to sign the treaty; I have even reconducted him\nto Newcastle, and he was obliged to be satisfied with our proceedings\ntowards him--the deal coffer being always carried without jolting, and\nbeing lined softly, I asked a gratification for you. Here it is.\" He\nthrew a respectable-looking purse upon the cloth; and all involuntarily\nstretched out their hands. \"One moment, my lambs,\" said D'Artagnan; \"if\nthere are profits, there are also charges.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" murmured they.\n\n\"We are about to find ourselves, my friends, in a position which would\nnot be tenable for people without brains. I speak plainly; we are\nbetween the gallows and the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Oh! Oh!\" said the chorus.\n\n\"That is easily understood. It was necessary to explain to General Monk\nthe disappearance of his treasurer. I waited, for that purpose, till the\nunhoped-for moment of the restoration of King Charles II., who is one of\nmy friends.\"\n\nThis army exchanged a glance of satisfaction in reply to the\nsufficiently proud look of D'Artagnan. \"The king being restored, I\nrestored to Monk his man of business, a little plucked, it is true, but,\nin short, I restored him. Now, General Monk, when he pardoned me, for\nhe has pardoned me, could not help repeating these words to me, which I\ncharge every one of you to engrave deeply there, between the eyes, under\nthe vault of the cranium:--'Monsieur, the joke has been a good one, but\nI don't naturally like jokes; if ever a word of what you have done' (you\nunderstand me, Menneville) 'escapes from your lips, or the lips of your\ncompanions, I have, in my government of Scotland and Ireland, seven\nhundred and forty-one wooden gibbets, of strong oak, clamped with iron,\nand freshly greased every week. I will make a present of one of these\ngibbets to each of you, and observe well, M. d'Artagnan,' added he\n(observe it also, M. Menneville), 'I shall still have seven hundred and\nthirty left for my private pleasure. And still further--'\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said the auxiliaries, \"is there still more?\"\n\n\"A mere trifle. 'Monsieur d'Artagnan, I send to the king of France the\ntreaty in question, with a request that he will cast into the Bastile\nprovisionally, and then send to me, all who have taken part in this\nexpedition; and that is a prayer with which the king will certainly\ncomply.'\"\n\nA cry of terror broke from all corners of the table.\n\n\"There! there! there!\" said D'Artagnan, \"this brave M. Monk has\nforgotten one thing, and that is he does not know the name of any one of\nyou; I alone know you, and it is not I, you well may believe, who will\nbetray you. Why should I? As for you--I cannot suppose you will be silly\nenough to denounce yourselves, for then the king, to spare himself the\nexpense of feeding and lodging you, will send you off to Scotland, where\nthe seven hundred and forty-one gibbets are to be found. That is all,\nmessieurs; I have not another word to add to what I have had the honor\nto tell you. I am sure you have understood me perfectly well, have you\nnot, M. Menneville?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" replied the latter.\n\n\"Now the crowns!\" said D'Artagnan. \"Shut the doors,\" he cried, and\nopened the bag upon the table, from which rolled several fine gold\ncrowns. Every one made a movement towards the floor.\n\n\"Gently!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"Let no one stoop, and then I shall not\nbe out in my reckoning.\" He found it all right, gave fifty of those\nsplendid crowns to each man, and received as many benedictions as he\nbestowed pieces. \"Now,\" said he, \"if it were possible for you to reform\na little, if you could become good and honest citizens--\"\n\n\"That is rather difficult,\" said one of the troop.\n\n\"What then, captain?\" said another.\n\n\"Because I might be able to find you again, and, who knows what other\ngood fortune?\" He made a sign to Menneville, who listened to all he said\nwith a composed air. \"Menneville,\" said he, \"come with me. Adieu, my\nbrave fellows! I need not warn you to be discreet.\"\n\nMenneville followed him, whilst the salutations of the auxiliaries were\nmingled with the sweet sound of the money clinking in their pockets.\n\n\"Menneville,\" said D'Artagnan, when they were once in the street, \"you\nwere not my dupe; beware of being so. You did not appear to have any\nfear of the gibbets of Monk, or the Bastile of his majesty, King Louis\nXIV., but you will do me the favor of being afraid of me. Then listen;\nat the smallest word that shall escape you, I will kill you as I would a\nfowl. I have absolution from our holy father, the pope, in my pocket.\"\n\n\"I assure you I know absolutely nothing, my dear M. d'Artagnan, and that\nyour words have all been to me so many articles of faith.\"\n\n\"I was quite sure you were an intelligent fellow,\" said the musketeer;\n\"I have tried you for a length of time. These fifty crowns which I give\nyou above the rest will prove the esteem I have for you. Take them.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Menneville.\n\n\"With that sum you can really become an honest man,\" replied D'Artagnan,\nin the most serious tone possible. \"It would be disgraceful for a mind\nlike yours, and a name you no longer dare to bear, to sink forever under\nthe rust of an evil life. Become a gallant man, Menneville, and live for\na year upon those hundred gold crowns: it is a good provision; twice\nthe pay of a high officer. In a year come to me, and, _Mordioux!_ I will\nmake something of you.\"\n\nMenneville swore, as his comrades had sworn, that he would be as silent\nas the grave. And yet some one must have spoken; and as, certainly, it\nwas not one of the nine companions, and quite as certainly, it was\nnot Menneville, it must have been D'Artagnan, who, in his quality of a\nGascon, had his tongue very near to his lips. For, in short, if it were\nnot he, who could it be? And how can it be explained that the secret of\nthe deal coffer pierced with holes should come to our knowledge, and\nin so complete a fashion that we have, as has been seen, related the\nhistory of it in all its most minute details; details which, besides,\nthrow a light as new as unexpected upon all that portion of the history\nof England which has been left, up to the present day, completely in\ndarkness by the historian of our neighbors?\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVIII. In which it is seen that the French Grocer had already\nbeen established in the Seventeenth Century.\n\nHis accounts once settled, and his recommendations made, D'Artagnan\nthought of nothing but returning to Paris as soon as possible. Athos, on\nhis part, was anxious to reach home and to rest a little. However whole\nthe character and the man may remain after the fatigues of a voyage, the\ntraveler perceives with pleasure, at the close of the day--even though\nthe day has been a fine one--that night is approaching, and will bring\na little sleep with it. So, from Boulogne to Paris, jogging on, side by\nside, the two friends, in some degree absorbed each in his individual\nthoughts, conversed of nothing sufficiently interesting for us to repeat\nto our readers. Each of them given up to his personal reflections, and\nconstructing his future after his own fashion, was, above all, anxious\nto abridge the distance by speed. Athos and D'Artagnan arrived at the\ngates of Paris on the evening of the fourth day after leaving Boulogne.\n\n\"Where are you going, my friend?\" asked Athos. \"I shall direct my course\nstraight to my hotel.\"\n\n\"And I straight to my partner's.\"\n\n\"To Planchet's?\"\n\n\"Yes; at the Pilon d'Or.\"\n\n\"Well, but shall we not meet again?\"\n\n\"If you remain in Paris, yes; for I shall stay here.\"\n\n\"No: after having embraced Raoul, with whom I have appointed a meeting\nat my hotel, I shall set out immediately for La Fere.\"\n\n\"Well, adieu, then, dear and true friend.\"\n\n\"_Au revoir!_ I should rather say, for why can you not come and live\nwith me at Blois? You are free, you are rich, I shall purchase for\nyou, if you like, a handsome estate in the vicinity of Cheverny or of\nBracieux. On the one side you will have the finest woods in the world,\nwhich join those of Chambord; on the other, admirable marshes. You who\nlove sporting, and who, whether you admit it or not, are a poet, my dear\nfriend, you will find pheasants, rail and teal, without counting sunsets\nand excursions on the water, to make you fancy yourself Nimrod and\nApollo themselves. While awaiting the purchase, you can live at La Fere,\nand we shall go together to fly our hawks among the vines, as Louis\nXIII. used to do. That is a quiet amusement for old fellows like us.\"\n\nD'Artagnan took the hands of Athos in his own. \"Dear count,\" said he,\n\"I shall say neither 'Yes' nor 'No.' Let me pass in Paris the time\nnecessary for the regulation of my affairs, and accustom myself, by\ndegrees, to the heavy and glittering idea which is beating in my brain\nand dazzles me. I am rich, you see, and from this moment until the time\nwhen I shall have acquired the habit of being rich, I know myself, and I\nshall be an insupportable animal. Now, I am not enough of a fool to\nwish to appear to have lost my wits before a friend like you, Athos. The\ncloak is handsome, the cloak is richly gilded, but it is new, and does\nnot seem to fit me.\"\n\nAthos smiled. \"So be it,\" said he. \"But _a propos_ of this cloak, dear\nD'Artagnan, will you allow me to offer you a little advice?\"\n\n\"Yes, willingly.\"\n\n\"You will not be angry?\"\n\n\"Proceed.\"\n\n\"When wealth comes to a man late in life or all at once, that man, in\norder not to change, must most likely become a miser--that is to say,\nnot spend much more money than he had done before; or else become a\nprodigal, and contract so many debts as to become poor again.\"\n\n\"Oh! but what you say looks very much like a sophism, my dear\nphilosophic friend.\"\n\n\"I do not think so. Will you become a miser?\"\n\n\"No, _pardieu!_ I was one already, having nothing. Let us change.\"\n\n\"Then be prodigal.\"\n\n\"Still less, _Mordioux!_ Debts terrify me. Creditors appear to me, by\nanticipation, like those devils who turn the damned upon the gridirons,\nand as patience is not my dominant virtue, I am always tempted to thrash\nthose devils.\"\n\n\"You are the wisest man I know, and stand in no need of advice from any\none. Great fools must they be who think they have anything to teach you.\nBut are we not at the Rue Saint Honore?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear Athos.\"\n\n\"Look yonder, on the left, that small, long white house is the hotel\nwhere I lodge. You may observe that it has but two stories; I occupy\nthe first; the other is let to an officer whose duties oblige him to be\nabsent eight or nine months in the year,--so I am in that house as in my\nown home, without the expense.\"\n\n\"Oh! how well you manage, Athos! What order and what liberality! They\nare what I wish to unite! But, of what use trying! that comes from\nbirth, and cannot be acquired.\"\n\n\"You are a flatterer! Well! adieu, dear friend. _A propos_, remember me\nto Master Planchet; he always was a bright fellow.\"\n\n\"And a man of heart, too, Athos. Adieu.\"\n\nAnd the separated. During all this conversation, D'Artagnan had not for\na moment lost sight of a certain pack-horse, in whose panniers, under\nsome hay, were spread the _sacoches_ (messenger's bags) with the\nportmanteau. Nine o'clock was striking at Saint-Merri. Planchet's helps\nwere shutting up his shop. D'Artagnan stopped the postilion who rode the\npack-horse, at the corner of the Rue des Lombards, under a pent-house,\nand calling one of Planchet's boys, he desired him not only to take care\nof the two horses, but to watch the postilion; after which he entered\nthe shop of the grocer, who had just finished supper, and who, in his\nlittle private room, was, with a degree of anxiety, consulting the\ncalendar, on which, every evening, he scratched out the day that was\npast. At the moment when Planchet, according to his daily custom, with\nthe back of his pen, erased another day, D'Artagnan kicked the door\nwith his foot, and the blow made his steel spur jingle. \"Oh! good\nLord!\" cried Planchet. The worthy grocer could say no more; he had just\nperceived his partner. D'Artagnan entered with a bent back and a dull\neye: the Gascon had an idea with regard to Planchet.\n\n\"Good God!\" thought the grocer, looking earnestly at the traveler, \"he\nlooks sad!\" The musketeer sat down.\n\n\"My dear Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" said Planchet, with a horrible\npalpitation of the heart. \"Here you are! and your health?\"\n\n\"Tolerably good, Planchet, tolerably good!\" said D'Artagnan, with a\nprofound sigh.\n\n\"You have not been wounded, I hope?\"\n\n\"Phew!\"\n\n\"Ah, I see,\" continued Planchet, more and more alarmed, \"the expedition\nhas been a trying one?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said D'Artagnan. A shudder ran down Planchet's back. \"I should\nlike to have something to drink,\" said the musketeer, raising his head\npiteously.\n\nPlanchet ran to the cupboard, and poured out to D'Artagnan some wine in\na large glass. D'Artagnan examined the bottle.\n\n\"What wine is that?\" asked he.\n\n\"Alas! that which you prefer, monsieur,\" said Planchet; \"that good old\nAnjou wine, which was one day nearly costing us all so dear.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" replied D'Artagnan, with a melancholy smile, \"Ah! my poor\nPlanchet, ought I still to drink good wine?\"\n\n\"Come! my dear master,\" said Planchet, making a super-human effort,\nwhilst all his contracted muscles, his pallor and his trembling betrayed\nthe most acute anguish. \"Come! I have been a soldier and consequently\nhave some courage; do not make me linger, dear Monsieur d'Artagnan; our\nmoney is lost, is it not?\"\n\nBefore he answered, D'Artagnan took his time, and that appeared an age\nto the poor grocer. Nevertheless he did nothing but turn about on his\nchair.\n\n\"And if that were the case,\" said he, slowly, moving his head up and\ndown, \"if that were the case, what would you say, my dear friend?\"\n\nPlanchet, from being pale, turned yellow. It might have been thought he\nwas going to swallow his tongue, so full became his throat, so red were\nhis eyes!\n\n\"Twenty thousand livres!\" murmured he. \"Twenty thousand livres, and\nyet--\"\n\nD'Artagnan, with his neck elongated, his legs stretched out, and his\nhands hanging listlessly, looked like a statue of discouragement.\nPlanchet drew up a sigh from the deepest cavities of his breast.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I see how it is. Let us be men! It is all over, is it\nnot? The principal thing is, monsieur, that your life is safe.\"\n\n\"Doubtless! doubtless!--life is something--but I am ruined!\"\n\n\"_Cordieu!_ monsieur!\" said Planchet, \"If it is so, we must not despair\nfor that; you shall become a grocer with me; I shall take you for my\npartner, we will share the profits, and if there should be no more\nprofits, well, why then we shall share the almonds, raisins and prunes,\nand we will nibble together the last quarter of Dutch cheese.\"\n\nD'Artagnan could hold out no longer. \"_Mordioux!_\" cried he, with great\nemotion, \"thou art a brave fellow, on my honor, Planchet. You have not\nbeen playing a part, have you? You have not seen the pack-horse with the\nbags under the shed yonder?\"\n\n\"What horse? What bags?\" said Planchet, whose trembling heart began to\nsuggest that D'Artagnan was mad.\n\n\"Why, the English bags, _Mordioux!_\" said D'Artagnan, all radiant, quite\ntransfigured.\n\n\"Ah! good God!\" articulated Planchet, drawing back before the dazzling\nfire of his looks.\n\n\"Imbecile!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"you think me mad! _Mordioux!_ On the\ncontrary, never was my head more clear, or my heart more joyous. To the\nbags, Planchet, to the bags!\"\n\n\"But to what bags, good heavens!\"\n\nD'Artagnan pushed Planchet towards the window.\n\n\"Under that shed yonder, don't you see a horse?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Don't you see how his back is laden?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\"\n\n\"Don't you see your lad talking with the postilion?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\"\n\n\"Well, you know the name of that lad, because he is your own. Call him.\"\n\n\"Abdon! Abdon!\" vociferated Planchet, from the window.\n\n\"Bring the horse!\" shouted D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Bring the horse!\" screamed Planchet.\n\n\"Now give ten livres to the postilion,\" said D'Artagnan, in the tone he\nwould have employed in commanding a maneuver; \"two lads to bring up the\nfirst two bags, two to bring up the two last,--and move, _Mordioux!_ be\nlively!\"\n\nPlanchet rushed down the stairs, as if the devil had been at his heels.\nA moment later the lads ascended the stairs, bending beneath their\nburden. D'Artagnan sent them off to their garrets, carefully closed the\ndoor, and addressing Planchet, who, in his turn, looked a little wild,--\n\n\"Now, we are by ourselves,\" said he; and he spread upon the floor a\nlarge cover, and emptied the first bag into it. Planchet did the same\nwith the second; then D'Artagnan, all in a tremble, let out the precious\nbowels of the third with a knife. When Planchet heard the provoking\nsound of the silver and gold--when he saw bubbling out of the bags the\nshining crowns, which glittered like fish from the sweep-net--when he\nfelt himself plunging his hands up to the elbows in that still rising\ntide of yellow and white coins, a giddiness seized him, and like a man\nstruck by lightning, he sank heavily down upon the enormous heap, which\nhis weight caused to roll away in all directions. Planchet, suffocated\nwith joy, had lost his senses. D'Artagnan threw a glass of white wine in\nhis face, which incontinently recalled him to life.\n\n\"Ah! good heavens! good heavens! good heavens!\" said Planchet, wiping\nhis mustache and beard.\n\nAt that time, as they do now, grocers wore the cavalier mustache and the\nlansquenet beard, only the money baths, already rare in those days, have\nbecome almost unknown now.\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" said D'Artagnan, \"there are a hundred thousand livres for\nyou, partner. Draw your share, if you please, and I will draw mine.\"\n\n\"Oh! the lovely sum! Monsieur d'Artagnan, the lovely sum!\"\n\n\"I confess that half an hour ago I regretted that I had to give you so\nmuch; but now I no longer regret it; thou art a brave grocer, Planchet.\nThere, let us close our accounts, for, as they say, short reckonings\nmake long friends.\"\n\n\"Oh! rather, in the first place, tell me the whole history,\" said\nPlanchet; \"that must be better than the money.\"\n\n\"_Ma foi!_\" said D'Artagnan, stroking his mustache, \"I can't say no; and\nif ever the historian turns to me for information, he will be able\nto say he has not dipped his bucket into a dry spring. Listen, then,\nPlanchet, I will tell you all about it.\"\n\n\"And I shall build piles of crowns,\" said Planchet. \"Begin, my dear\nmaster.\"\n\n\"Well, this is it,\" said D'Artagnan, drawing his breath.\n\n\"And that is it,\" said Planchet, picking up his first handful of crowns.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIX. Mazarin's Gaming Party.\n\nIn a large chamber of the Palais Royal, hung with a dark colored velvet,\nwhich threw into strong relief the gilded frames of a great number\nof magnificent pictures, on the evening of the arrival of the two\nFrenchmen, the whole court was assembled before the alcove of M. le\nCardinal de Mazarin, who gave a card party to the king and queen.\n\nA small screen separated three prepared tables. At one of these tables\nthe king and the two queens were seated. Louis XIV., placed opposite to\nthe young queen, his wife, smiled upon her with an expression of real\nhappiness. Anne of Austria held the cards against the cardinal, and her\ndaughter-in-law assisted her in the game, when she was not engaged in\nsmiling at her husband. As for the cardinal, who was lying on his bed\nwith a weary and careworn face, his cards were held by the Comtesse de\nSoissons, and he watched them with an incessant look of interest and\ncupidity.\n\nThe cardinal's face had been painted by Bernouin; but the rouge, which\nglowed only on his cheeks, threw into stronger contrast the sickly\npallor of his countenance and the shining yellow of his brow. His eyes\nalone acquired a more brilliant luster from this auxiliary, and upon\nthose sick man's eyes were, from time to time, turned the uneasy looks\nof the king, the queen, and the courtiers. The fact is, that the two\neyes of the Signor Mazarin were the stars more or less brilliant in\nwhich the France of the seventeenth century read its destiny every\nevening and every morning.\n\nMonseigneur neither won nor lost; he was, therefore, neither gay nor\nsad. It was a stagnation in which, full of pity for him, Anne of Austria\nwould not have willingly left him; but in order to attract the attention\nof the sick man by some brilliant stroke, she must have either won\nor lost. To win would have been dangerous, because Mazarin would have\nchanged his indifference into an ugly grimace; to lose would likewise\nhave been dangerous, because she must have cheated, and the infanta,\nwho watched her game, would, doubtless, have exclaimed against her\npartiality for Mazarin. Profiting by this calm, the courtiers were\nchatting. When not in a bad humor, M. de Mazarin was a very _debonnaire_\nprince, and he, who prevented nobody from singing, provided they paid,\nwas not tyrant enough to prevent people from talking, provided they made\nup their minds to lose.\n\nThey were therefore chatting. At the first table, the king's younger\nbrother, Philip, Duc d'Anjou, was admiring his handsome face in the\nglass of a box. His favorite, the Chevalier de Lorraine, leaning over\nthe back of the prince's chair, was listening, with secret envy, to\nthe Comte de Guiche, another of Philip's favorites, who was relating in\nchoice terms the various vicissitudes of fortune of the royal adventurer\nCharles II. He told, as so many fabulous events, all the history of his\nperigrinations in Scotland, and his terrors when the enemy's party was\nso closely on his track; of nights spent in trees, and days spent\nin hunger and combats. By degrees, the fate of the unfortunate king\ninterested his auditors so greatly, that the play languished even at the\nroyal table, and the young king, with a pensive look and downcast eye,\nfollowed, without appearing to give any attention to it, the smallest\ndetails of this Odyssey, very picturesquely related by the Comte de\nGuiche.\n\nThe Comtesse de Soissons interrupted the narrator: \"Confess, count, you\nare inventing.\"\n\n\"Madame, I am repeating like a parrot all the stories related to me by\ndifferent Englishmen. To my shame I am compelled to say, I am as exact\nas a copy.\"\n\n\"Charles II. would have died before he could have endured all that.\"\n\nLouis XIV. raised his intelligent and proud head. \"Madame,\" said he, in\na grave tone, still partaking something of the timid child, \"monsieur\nle cardinal will tell you that during my minority the affairs of France\nwere in jeopardy,--and that if I had been older, and obliged to take\nsword in hand, it would sometimes have been for the purpose of procuring\nthe evening meal.\"\n\n\"Thanks to God,\" said the cardinal, who spoke for the first time, \"your\nmajesty exaggerates, and your supper has always been ready with that of\nyour servants.\"\n\nThe king colored.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Philip, inconsiderately, from his place, and without ceasing\nto admire himself,--\"I recollect once, at Melun, the supper was laid\nfor nobody, and that the king ate two-thirds of a slice of bread, and\nabandoned to me the other third.\"\n\nThe whole assembly, seeing Mazarin smile, began to laugh. Courtiers\nflatter kings with the remembrance of past distresses, as with the hopes\nof future good fortune.\n\n\"It is not to be denied that the crown of France has always remained\nfirm upon the heads of its kings,\" Anne of Austria hastened to say,\n\"and that it has fallen off of that of the king of England; and when by\nchance that crown oscillated a little,--for there are throne-quakes as\nwell as earthquakes,--every time, I say, that rebellion threatened it, a\ngood victory restored tranquillity.\"\n\n\"With a few gems added to the crown,\" said Mazarin.\n\nThe Comte de Guiche was silent: the king composed his countenance, and\nMazarin exchanged looks with Anne of Austria, as if to thank her for her\nintervention.\n\n\"It is of no consequence,\" said Philip, smoothing his hair; \"my cousin\nCharles is not handsome, but he is very brave, and fought like a\nlandsknecht; and if he continues to fight thus, no doubt he will finish\nby gaining a battle, like Rocroi--\"\n\n\"He has no soldiers,\" interrupted the Chevalier de Lorraine.\n\n\"The king of Holland, his ally, will give him some. I would willingly\nhave given him some if I had been king of France.\"\n\nLouis XIV. blushed excessively. Mazarin affected to be more attentive to\nhis game than ever.\n\n\"By this time,\" resumed the Comte de Guiche, \"the fortune of this\nunhappy prince is decided. If he has been deceived by Monk, he is\nruined. Imprisonment, perhaps death, will finish what exiles, battles,\nand privations have commenced.\"\n\nMazarin's brow became clouded.\n\n\"It is certain,\" said Louis XIV., \"that his majesty Charles II., has\nquitted the Hague?\"\n\n\"Quite certain, your majesty,\" replied the young man; \"my father has\nreceived a letter containing all the details; it is even known that the\nking has landed at Dover; some fishermen saw him entering the port; the\nrest is still a mystery.\"\n\n\"I should like to know the rest,\" said Philip, impetuously. \"You\nknow,--you, my brother.\"\n\nLouis XIV. colored again. That was the third time within an hour. \"Ask\nmy lord cardinal,\" replied he, in a tone which made Mazarin, Anne of\nAustria, and everybody else open their eyes.\n\n\"That means, my son,\" said Anne of Austria, laughing, \"that the king\ndoes not like affairs of state to be talked of out of the council.\"\n\nPhilip received the reprimand with good grace, and bowed, first smiling\nat his brother, and then at his mother. But Mazarin saw from the corner\nof his eye that a group was about to be formed in the corner of the\nroom, and that the Duc d'Anjou, with the Comte de Guiche, and the\nChevalier de Lorraine, prevented from talking aloud, might say, in a\nwhisper, what it was not convenient should be said. He was beginning,\nthen, to dart at them glances full of mistrust and uneasiness, inviting\nAnne of Austria to throw perturbation in the midst of the unlawful\nassembly, when, suddenly, Bernouin, entering from behind the tapestry\nof the bedroom, whispered in the ear of Mazarin, \"Monseigneur, an envoy\nfrom his majesty, the king of England.\"\n\nMazarin could not help exhibiting a slight emotion, which was perceived\nby the king. To avoid being indiscreet, rather than to appear useless,\nLouis XIV. rose immediately, and approaching his eminence, wished him\ngood-night. All the assembly had risen with a great noise of rolling of\nchairs and tables being pushed away.\n\n\"Let everybody depart by degrees,\" said Mazarin in a whisper to Louis\nXIV., \"and be so good as to excuse me a few minutes. I am going to\ndispatch an affair about which I wish to converse with your majesty this\nvery evening.\"\n\n\"And the queens?\" asked Louis XIV.\n\n\"And M. le Duc d'Anjou,\" said his eminence.\n\nAt the same time he turned round in his _ruelle_, the curtains of which,\nin falling, concealed the bed. The cardinal, nevertheless, did not lose\nsight of the conspirators.\n\n\"M. le Comte de Guiche,\" said he, in a fretful voice, whilst putting on,\nbehind the curtain, his dressing-gown, with the assistance of Bernouin.\n\n\"I am here, my lord,\" said the young man, as he approached.\n\n\"Take my cards, you are lucky. Win a little money for me of these\ngentlemen.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\nThe young man sat down at the table from which the king withdrew to talk\nwith the two queens. A serious game was commenced between the comte\nand several rich courtiers. In the meantime Philip was discussing the\nquestions of dress with the Chevalier de Lorraine, and they had ceased\nto hear the rustling of the cardinal's silk robe from behind the\ncurtain. His eminence had followed Bernouin into the closet adjoining\nthe bedroom.\n\n\n\nChapter XL: An Affair of State.\n\nThe cardinal, on passing into his cabinet, found the Comte de la Fere,\nwho was waiting for him, engaged in admiring a very fine Raphael placed\nover a sideboard covered with a plate. His eminence came in softly,\nlightly, and as silently as a shadow, and surprised the countenance\nof the comte, as he was accustomed to do, pretending to divine by the\nsimple expression of the face of his interlocutor what would be the\nresult of the conversation.\n\nBut this time Mazarin was foiled in his expectation: he read nothing\nupon the face of Athos, not even the respect he was accustomed to see on\nall faces. Athos was dressed in black, with a simple lacing of silver.\nHe wore the Holy Ghost, the Garter, and the Golden Fleece, three orders\nof such importance, that a king alone, or else a player, could wear them\nat once.\n\nMazarin rummaged a long time in his somewhat troubled memory to recall\nthe name he ought to give to this icy figure, but he did not succeed. \"I\nam told,\" said he, at length, \"you have a message from England for me.\"\n\nAnd he sat down, dismissing Bernouin, who, in his quality of secretary,\nwas getting his pen ready.\n\n\"On the part of his majesty, the king of England, yes, your eminence.\"\n\n\"You speak very good French for an Englishman, monsieur,\" said Mazarin,\ngraciously, looking through his fingers at the Holy Ghost, Garter, and\nGolden Fleece, but more particularly at the face of the messenger.\n\n\"I am not an Englishman, but a Frenchman, monsieur le cardinal,\" replied\nAthos.\n\n\"It is remarkable that the king of England should choose a Frenchman for\nhis ambassador; it is an excellent augury. Your name, monsieur, if you\nplease.\"\n\n\"Comte de la Fere,\" replied Athos, bowing more slightly than the\nceremonial and pride of the all-powerful minister required.\n\nMazarin bent his shoulders, as if to say:--\n\n\"I do not know that name.\"\n\nAthos did not alter his carriage.\n\n\"And you come, monsieur,\" continued Mazarin, \"to tell me--\"\n\n\"I come on the part of his majesty the king of Great Britain to announce\nto the king of France\"--Mazarin frowned--\"to announce to the king of\nFrance,\" continued Athos, imperturbably, \"the happy restoration of his\nmajesty Charles II. to the throne of his ancestors.\"\n\nThis shade did not escape his cunning eminence. Mazarin was too much\naccustomed to mankind, not to see in the cold and almost haughty\npoliteness of Athos, an index of hostility, which was not of the\ntemperature of that hot-house called a court.\n\n\"You have powers, I suppose?\" asked Mazarin, in a short, querulous tone.\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\" And the word \"monseigneur\" came so painfully from\nthe lips of Athos that it might be said it skinned them.\n\nAthos took from an embroidered velvet bag which he carried under his\ndoublet a dispatch. The cardinal held out his hand for it. \"Your pardon,\nmonseigneur,\" said Athos. \"My dispatch is for the king.\"\n\n\"Since you are a Frenchman, monsieur, you ought to know the position of\na prime minister at the court of France.\"\n\n\"There was a time,\" replied Athos, \"when I occupied myself with the\nimportance of prime ministers; but I have formed, long ago, a resolution\nto treat no longer with any but the king.\"\n\n\"Then, monsieur,\" said Mazarin, who began to be irritated, \"you will\nneither see the minister nor the king.\"\n\nMazarin rose. Athos replaced his dispatch in its bag, bowed gravely, and\nmade several steps towards the door. This coolness exasperated Mazarin.\n\"What strange diplomatic proceedings are these!\" cried he. \"Have we\nreturned to the times when Cromwell sent us bullies in the guise of\n_charges d'affaires?_ You want nothing, monsieur, but the steel cap on\nyour head, and a Bible at your girdle.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Athos, dryly, \"I have never had, as you have, the\nadvantage of treating with Cromwell; and I have only seen his _charges\nd'affaires_ sword in hand; I am therefore ignorant of how he treated\nwith prime ministers. As for the king of England, Charles II., I know\nthat when he writes to his majesty King Louis XIV., he does not write\nto his eminence the Cardinal Mazarin. I see no diplomacy in that\ndistinction.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Mazarin, raising his attenuated hand, and striking his head,\n\"I remember now!\" Athos looked at him in astonishment. \"Yes, that is\nit!\" said the cardinal, continuing to look at his interlocutor; \"yes,\nthat is certainly it. I know you now, monsieur. Ah! _diavolo!_ I am no\nlonger astonished.\"\n\n\"In fact, I was astonished that, with your eminence's excellent memory,\"\nreplied Athos, smiling, \"you had not recognized me before.\"\n\n\"Always refractory and grumbling--monsieur--monsieur--What do they call\nyou? Stop--a name of a river--Potamos; no--the name of an island--Naxos;\nno, _per Giove!_--the name of a mountain--Athos! now I have it.\nDelighted to see you again, and to be no longer at Rueil, where you\nand your damned companions made me pay ransom. Fronde! still Fronde!\naccursed Fronde! Oh, what grudges! Why, monsieur, have your antipathies\nsurvived mine? If any one has cause to complain, I think it could not\nbe you, who got out of the affair not only in a sound skin, but with the\n_cordon_ of the Holy Ghost around your neck.\"\n\n\"My lord cardinal,\" replied Athos, \"permit me not to enter into\nconsiderations of that kind. I have a mission to fulfill. Will you\nfacilitate the means of my fulfilling that mission, or will you not?\"\n\n\"I am astonished,\" said Mazarin,--quite delighted at having\nrecovered his memory, and bristling with malice,--\"I am astonished,\nMonsieur--Athos--that a _Frondeur_ like you should have accepted a\nmission for the Perfidious Mazarin, as used to be said in the good old\ntimes--\" And Mazarin began to laugh, in spite of a painful cough, which\ncut short his sentences, converting them into sobs.\n\n\"I have only accepted the mission near the king of France, monsieur le\ncardinal,\" retorted the comte, though with less asperity, for he thought\nhe had sufficiently the advantage to show himself moderate.\n\n\"And yet, _Monsieur le Frondeur_,\" said Mazarin, gayly, \"the affair\nwhich you have taken in charge must, from the king--\"\n\n\"With which I have been given in charge, monseigneur. I do not run after\naffairs.\"\n\n\"Be it so. I say that this negotiation must pass through my hands. Let\nus lose no precious time, then. Tell me the conditions.\"\n\n\"I have had the honor of assuring your eminence that only the letter of\nhis majesty King Charles II. contains the revelation of his wishes.\"\n\n\"Pooh! you are ridiculous with your obstinacy, Monsieur Athos. It is\nplain you have kept company with the Puritans yonder. As to your secret,\nI know it better than you do; and you have done wrongly, perhaps, in\nnot having shown some respect for a very old and suffering man, who\nhas labored much during his life, and kept the field for his ideas as\nbravely as you have for yours. You will not communicate your letter to\nme? You will say nothing to me? Very well! Come with me into my chamber;\nyou shall speak to the king--and before the king.--Now, then, one last\nword: who gave you the Fleece? I remember you passed for having the\nGarter; but as to the Fleece, I do not know--\"\n\n\"Recently, my lord, Spain, on the occasion of the marriage of his\nmajesty Louis XIV., sent King Charles II. a brevet of the Fleece in\nblank; Charles II. immediately transmitted it to me, filling up the\nblank with my name.\"\n\nMazarin arose, and leaning on the arm of Bernouin, he returned to his\n_ruelle_ at the moment the name of M. le Prince was being announced. The\nPrince de Conde, the first prince of the blood, the conqueror of\nRocroi, Lens, and Nordlingen, was, in fact, entering the apartment\nof Monseigneur de Mazarin, followed by his gentlemen, and had already\nsaluted the king, when the prime minister raised his curtain. Athos had\ntime to see Raoul pressing the hand of the Comte de Guiche, and send him\na smile in return for his respectful bow. He had time, likewise, to see\nthe radiant countenance of the cardinal, when he perceived before him,\nupon the table, an enormous heap of gold, which the Comte de Guiche had\nwon in a run of luck, after his eminence had confided his cards to him.\nSo forgetting ambassador, embassy and prince, his first thought was of\nthe gold. \"What!\" cried the old man--\"all that--won?\"\n\n\"Some fifty thousand crowns; yes, monseigneur,\" replied the Comte de\nGuiche, rising. \"Must I give up my place to your eminence, or shall I\ncontinue?\"\n\n\"Give up! give up! you are mad. You would lose all you have won.\n_Peste!_\"\n\n\"My lord!\" said the Prince de Conde, bowing.\n\n\"Good-evening, monsieur le prince,\" said the minister, in a careless\ntone; \"it is very kind of you to visit an old sick friend.\"\n\n\"A friend!\" murmured the Comte de la Fere, at witnessing with stupor\nthis monstrous alliance of words;--\"friends! when the parties are Conde\nand Mazarin!\"\n\nMazarin seemed to divine the thoughts of the _Frondeur_, for he smiled\nupon him with triumph, and immediately,--\"Sire,\" said he to the king,\n\"I have the honor of presenting to your majesty, Monsieur le Comte de\nla Fere, ambassador from his Britannic majesty. An affair of state,\ngentlemen,\" added he, waving his hand to all who filled the chamber, and\nwho, the Prince de Conde at their head, all disappeared at the simple\ngesture. Raoul, after a last look cast at the comte, followed M. de\nConde. Philip of Anjou and the queen appeared to be consulting about\ndeparting.\n\n\"A family affair,\" said Mazarin, suddenly, detaining them in their\nseats. \"This gentleman is the bearer of a letter in which King Charles\nII., completely restored to his throne, demands an alliance between\nMonsieur, the brother of the king, and Mademoiselle Henrietta,\ngrand-daughter of Henry IV. Will you remit your letter of credit to the\nking, monsieur le comte?\"\n\nAthos remained for a minute stupefied. How could the minister possibly\nknow the contents of the letter, which had never been out of his keeping\nfor a single instant? Nevertheless, always master of himself, he held\nout the dispatch to the young king, Louis XIV., who took it with a\nblush. A solemn silence reigned in the cardinal's chamber. It was only\ntroubled by the dull sound of the gold, which Mazarin, with his yellow,\ndry hand, piled up in a casket, whilst the king was reading.\n\n\n\nChapter XLI. The Recital.\n\nThe maliciousness of the cardinal did not leave much for the ambassador\nto say; nevertheless, the word \"restoration\" had struck the king,\nwho, addressing the comte, upon whom his eyes had been fixed since his\nentrance,--\"Monsieur,\" said he, \"will you have the kindness to give\nus some details concerning the affairs of England. You come from that\ncountry, you are a Frenchman, and the orders which I see glittering\nupon your person announce you to be a man of merit as well as a man of\nquality.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the cardinal, turning towards the queen-mother, \"is an\nancient servant of your majesty's, Monsieur le Comte de la Fere.\"\n\nAnne of Austria was as oblivious as a queen whose life had been mingled\nwith fine and stormy days. She looked at Mazarin, whose evil smile\npromised her something disagreeable; then she solicited from Athos, by\nanother look, an explanation.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" continued the cardinal, \"was a Treville musketeer, in the\nservice of the late king. Monsieur is well acquainted with England,\nwhither he has made several voyages at various periods; he is a subject\nof the highest merit.\"\n\nThese words made allusion to all the memories which Anne of Austria\ntrembled to evoke. England, that was her hatred of Richelieu and her\nlove for Buckingham; a Treville musketeer, that was the whole Odyssey of\nthe triumphs which had made the heart of the young woman throb, and of\nthe dangers which had been so near overturning the throne of the young\nqueen. These words had much power, for they rendered mute and attentive\nall the royal personages, who, with very various sentiments, set about\nrecomposing at the same time the mysteries which the young had not seen,\nand which the old had believed to be forever effaced.\n\n\"Speak, monsieur,\" said Louis XIV., the first to escape from troubles,\nsuspicions, and remembrances.\n\n\"Yes, speak,\" added Mazarin, to whom the little malicious thrust\ndirected against Anne of Austria had restored energy and gayety.\n\n\"Sire,\" said the comte, \"a sort of miracle has changed the whole destiny\nof Charles II. That which men, till that time, had been unable to do,\nGod resolved to accomplish.\"\n\nMazarin coughed while tossing about in his bed.\n\n\"King Charles II.,\" continued Athos, \"left the Hague neither as a\nfugitive nor a conqueror, but as an absolute king, who, after a distant\nvoyage from his kingdom, returns amidst universal benedictions.\"\n\n\"A great miracle, indeed,\" said Mazarin; \"for, if the news was true,\nKing Charles II., who has just returned amidst benedictions, went away\namidst musket-shots.\"\n\nThe king remained impassible. Philip, younger and more frivolous, could\nnot repress a smile, which flattered Mazarin as an applause of his\npleasantry.\n\n\"It is plain,\" said the king, \"there is a miracle; but God, who does so\nmuch for kings, monsieur le comte, nevertheless employs the hand of man\nto bring about the triumph of His designs. To what men does Charles II.\nprincipally owe his re-establishment?\"\n\n\"Why,\" interrupted Mazarin, without any regard for the king's\npride--\"does not your majesty know that it is to M. Monk?\"\n\n\"I ought to know it,\" replied Louis XIV., resolutely; \"and yet I ask my\nlord ambassador, the causes of the change in this General Monk?\"\n\n\"And your majesty touches precisely the question,\" replied Athos; \"for\nwithout the miracle of which I have had the honor to speak, General\nMonk would probably have remained an implacable enemy of Charles II. God\nwilled that a strange, bold, and ingenious idea should enter into\nthe mind of a certain man, whilst a devoted and courageous idea took\npossession of the mind of another man. The combinations of these two\nideas brought about such a change in the position of M. Monk, that, from\nan inveterate enemy, he became a friend to the deposed king.\"\n\n\"These are exactly the details I asked for,\" said the king. \"Who and\nwhat are the two men of whom you speak?\"\n\n\"Two Frenchmen, sire.\"\n\n\"Indeed! I am glad of that.\"\n\n\"And the two ideas,\" said Mazarin;--\"I am more curious about ideas than\nabout men, for my part.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured the king.\n\n\"The second idea, the devoted, reasonable idea--the least important,\nsir--was to go and dig up a million in gold, buried by King Charles I.\nat Newcastle, and to purchase with that gold the adherence of Monk.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Mazarin, reanimated by the word million. \"But Newcastle\nwas at the time occupied by Monk.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur le cardinal, and that is why I venture to call the idea\ncourageous as well as devoted. It was necessary, if Monk refused the\noffers of the negotiator, to reinstate King Charles II. in possession of\nthis million, which was to be torn, as it were, from the loyalty and\nnot the loyalism of General Monk. This was effected in spite of many\ndifficulties: the general proved to be loyal, and allowed the money to\nbe taken away.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said the timid, thoughtful king, \"that Charles II.\ncould not have known of this million whilst he was in Paris.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" rejoined the cardinal, maliciously, \"that his majesty\nthe king of Great Britain knew perfectly well of this million, but that\nhe preferred having two millions to having one.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Athos, firmly, \"the king of England, whilst in France, was\nso poor that he had not even money to take the post; so destitute of\nhope that he frequently thought of dying. He was so entirely ignorant of\nthe existence of the million at Newcastle, that but for a gentleman--one\nof your majesty's subjects--the moral depositary of the million, who\nrevealed the secret to King Charles II., that prince would still be\nvegetating in the most cruel forgetfulness.\"\n\n\"Let us pass on to the strange, bold and ingenious idea,\" interrupted\nMazarin, whose sagacity foresaw a check. \"What was that idea?\"\n\n\"This--M. Monk formed the only obstacle to the re-establishment of\nthe fallen king. A Frenchman imagined the idea of suppressing this\nobstacle.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh! but he is a scoundrel, that Frenchman,\" said Mazarin; \"and the\nidea is not so ingenious as to prevent its author being tied up by the\nneck at the Place de Greve, by decree of the parliament.\"\n\n\"Your eminence is mistaken,\" replied Athos, dryly; \"I did not say that\nthe Frenchman in question had resolved to assassinate M. Monk, but only\nto suppress him. The words of the French language have a value which the\ngentlemen of France know perfectly. Besides, this is an affair of\nwar; and when men serve kings against their enemies they are not to be\ncondemned by a parliament--God is their judge. This French gentleman,\nthen, formed the idea of gaining possession of the person of Monk, and\nhe executed his plan.\"\n\nThe king became animated at the recital of great actions. The king's\nyounger brother struck the table with his hand, exclaiming, \"Ah! that is\nfine!\"\n\n\"He carried off Monk?\" said the king. \"Why, Monk was in his camp.\"\n\n\"And the gentleman was alone, sire.\"\n\n\"That is marvelous!\" said Philip.\n\n\"Marvelous, indeed!\" cried the king.\n\n\"Good! There are the two little lions unchained,\" murmured the cardinal.\nAnd with an air of spite, which he did not dissemble: \"I am unacquainted\nwith these details, will you guarantee their authenticity, monsieur?\"\n\n\"All the more easily, my lord cardinal, from having seen the events.\"\n\n\"You have?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\n\nThe king had involuntarily drawn close to the count, the Duc d'Anjou had\nturned sharply round, and pressed Athos on the other side.\n\n\"What next? monsieur, what next?\" cried they both at the same time.\n\n\"Sire, M. Monk, being taken by the Frenchman, was brought to King\nCharles II., at the Hague. The king gave back his freedom to Monk, and\nthe grateful general, in return, gave Charles II. the throne of Great\nBritain, for which so many valiant men had fought in vain.\"\n\nPhilip clapped his hands with enthusiasm, Louis XIV., more reflective,\nturned towards the Comte de la Fere.\n\n\"Is this true,\" said he, \"in all its details?\"\n\n\"Absolutely true, sire.\"\n\n\"That one of my gentlemen knew the secret of the million, and kept it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"The name of that gentleman?\"\n\n\"It was your humble servant,\" said Athos, simply, and bowing.\n\nA murmur of admiration made the heart of Athos swell with pleasure. He\nhad reason to be proud, at least. Mazarin, himself, had raised his arms\ntowards heaven.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the king, \"I shall seek and find means to reward you.\"\nAthos made a movement. \"Oh, not for your honesty, to be paid for that\nwould humiliate you; but I owe you a reward for having participated in\nthe restoration of my brother, King Charles II.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"It is the triumph of a good cause which fills the whole house of France\nwith joy,\" said Anne of Austria.\n\n\"I continue,\" said Louis XIV.: \"Is it also true that a single man\npenetrated to Monk, in his camp, and carried him off?\"\n\n\"That man had ten auxiliaries, taken from a very inferior rank.\"\n\n\"And nothing more but them?\"\n\n\"Nothing more.\"\n\n\"And he is named?\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan, formerly lieutenant of the musketeers of your\nmajesty.\"\n\nAnne of Austria colored; Mazarin became yellow with shame; Louis XIV.\nwas deeply thoughtful, and a drop of moisture fell from his pale brow.\n\"What men!\" murmured he. And, involuntarily, he darted a glance at the\nminister which would have terrified him, if Mazarin, at the moment, had\nnot concealed his head under his pillow.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the young Duc d'Anjou, placing his hand, delicate and\nwhite as that of a woman, upon the arm of Athos, \"tell that brave man,\nI beg you, that Monsieur, brother of the king, will to-morrow drink his\nhealth before five hundred of the best gentlemen of France.\" And, on\nfinishing those words, the young man, perceiving that his enthusiasm had\nderanged one of his ruffles, set to work to put it to rights with the\ngreatest care imaginable.\n\n\"Let us resume business, sire,\" interrupted Mazarin, who never was\nenthusiastic, and who wore no ruffles.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied Louis XIV. \"Pursue your communication, monsieur\nle comte,\" added he, turning towards Athos.\n\nAthos immediately began and offered in due form the hand of the Princess\nHenrietta Stuart to the young prince, the king's brother. The conference\nlasted an hour; after which the doors of the chamber were thrown open to\nthe courtiers, who resumed their places as if nothing had been kept from\nthem in the occupations of that evening. Athos then found himself again\nwith Raoul, and the father and son were able to clasp each other's\nhands.\n\n\n\nChapter XLII. In which Mazarin becomes Prodigal.\n\nWhilst Mazarin was endeavoring to recover from the serious alarm he\nhad just experienced, Athos and Raoul were exchanging a few words in\na corner of the apartment. \"Well, here you are at Paris, then, Raoul?\"\nsaid the comte.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, since the return of M. le Prince.\"\n\n\"I cannot converse freely with you here, because we are observed; but I\nshall return home presently, and shall expect you as soon as your duty\npermits.\"\n\nRaoul bowed, and, at that moment, M. le Prince came up to them. The\nprince had that clear and keen look which distinguishes birds of prey\nof the noble species; his physiognomy itself presented several distinct\ntraits of this resemblance. It is known that in the Prince de Conde,\nthe aquiline nose rose out sharply and incisively from a brow slightly\nretreating, rather low than high, and according to the railers of the\ncourt,--a pitiless race without mercy even for genius,--constituted\nrather an eagle's beak than a human nose, in the heir of the illustrious\nprinces of the house of Conde. This penetrating look, this imperious\nexpression of the whole countenance, generally disturbed those to whom\nthe prince spoke, more than either majesty or regular beauty could\nhave done in the conqueror of Rocroi. Besides this, the fire mounted\nso suddenly to his projecting eyes, that with the prince every sort of\nanimation resembled passion. Now, on account of his rank, everybody at\nthe court respected M. le Prince, and many even, seeing only the man,\ncarried their respect as far as terror.\n\nLouis de Conde then advanced towards the Comte de la Fere and Raoul,\nwith the marked intention of being saluted by the one, and of speaking\nwith the other. No man bowed with more reserved grace than the Comte de\nla Fere. He disdained to put into a salutation all the shades which a\ncourtier ordinarily borrows from the same color--the desire to please.\nAthos knew his own personal value, and bowed to the prince like a man,\ncorrecting by something sympathetic and undefinable that which might\nhave appeared offensive to the pride of the highest rank in the\ninflexibility of his attitude. The prince was about to speak to Raoul.\nAthos forestalled him. \"If M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne,\" said he, \"were\nnot one of the humble servants of your royal highness, I would beg him\nto pronounce my name before you--_mon prince_.\"\n\n\"I have the honor to address Monsieur le Comte de la Fere,\" said Conde,\ninstantly.\n\n\"My protector,\" added Raoul, blushing.\n\n\"One of the most honorable men in the kingdom,\" continued the prince;\n\"one of the first gentlemen of France, and of whom I have heard so much\nthat I have frequently desired to number him among my friends.\"\n\n\"An honor of which I should be unworthy,\" replied Athos, \"but for the\nrespect and admiration I entertain for your royal highness.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Bragelonne,\" said the prince, \"is a good officer, and it is\nplainly seen that he has been to a good school. Ah, monsieur le comte,\nin your time, generals had soldiers!\"\n\n\"That is true, my lord, but nowadays soldiers have generals.\"\n\nThis compliment, which savored so little of flattery, gave a thrill of\njoy to the man whom already Europe considered a hero; and who might be\nthought to be satiated with praise.\n\n\"I regret very much,\" continued the prince, \"that you should have\nretired from the service, monsieur le comte; for it is more than\nprobable that the king will soon have a war with Holland or England, and\nopportunities for distinguishing himself would not be wanting for a man\nwho, like you, knows Great Britain as well as you do France.\"\n\n\"I believe I may say, monseigneur, that I have acted wisely in retiring\nfrom the service,\" said Athos, smiling. \"France and Great Britain will\nhenceforward live like two sisters, if I can trust my presentiments.\"\n\n\"Your presentiments?\"\n\n\"Stop, monseigneur, listen to what is being said yonder, at the table of\nmy lord the cardinal.\"\n\n\"Where they are playing?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\nThe cardinal had just raised himself on one elbow, and made a sign to\nthe king's brother, who went to him.\n\n\"My lord,\" said the cardinal, \"pick up, if you please, all those gold\ncrowns.\" And he pointed to the enormous pile of yellow and glittering\npieces which the Comte de Guiche had raised by degrees before him by a\nsurprising run of luck at play.\n\n\"For me?\" cried the Duc d'Anjou.\n\n\"Those fifty thousand crowns; yes, monseigneur, they are yours.\"\n\n\"Do you give them to me?\"\n\n\"I have been playing on your account, monseigneur,\" replied the\ncardinal, getting weaker and weaker, as if this effort of giving money\nhad exhausted all his physical and moral faculties.\n\n\"Oh, good heavens!\" exclaimed Philip, wild with joy, \"what a fortunate\nday!\" And he himself, making a rake of his fingers, drew a part of the\nsum into his pockets, which he filled, and still full a third remained\non the table.\n\n\"Chevalier,\" said Philip to his favorite, the Chevalier de Lorraine,\n\"come hither, chevalier.\" The favorite quickly obeyed. \"Pocket the\nrest,\" said the young prince.\n\nThis singular scene was considered by the persons present only as a\ntouching kind of family _fete_. The cardinal assumed the airs of a\nfather with the sons of France, and the two princes had grown up under\nhis wing. No one then imputed to pride, or even impertinence, as would\nbe done nowadays, this liberality on the part of the first minister. The\ncourtiers were satisfied with envying the prince.--The king turned away\nhis head.\n\n\"I never had so much money before,\" said the young prince, joyously,\nas he crossed the chamber with his favorite to go to his carriage. \"No,\nnever! What a weight these crowns are!\"\n\n\"But why has monsieur le cardinal given away all this money at once?\"\nasked M. le Prince of the Comte de la Fere. \"He must be very ill, the\ndear cardinal!\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord, very ill, without doubt; he looks very ill, as your royal\nhighness may perceive.\"\n\n\"But surely he will die of it. A hundred and fifty thousand livres! Oh,\nit is incredible! But, comte, tell me a reason for it?\"\n\n\"Patience, monseigneur, I beg of you. Here comes M. le Duc d'Anjou,\ntalking with the Chevalier de Lorraine; I should not be surprised if\nthey spared us the trouble of being indiscreet. Listen to them.\"\n\nIn fact the chevalier said to the prince in a low voice, \"My lord, it\nis not natural for M. Mazarin to give you so much money. Take care! you\nwill let some of the pieces fall, my lord. What design has the cardinal\nupon you to make him so generous?\"\n\n\"As I said,\" whispered Athos in the prince's ear; \"that, perhaps, is the\nbest reply to your question.\"\n\n\"Tell me, my lord,\" repeated the chevalier impatiently, as he was\ncalculating, by weighing them in his pocket, the quota of the sum which\nhad fallen to his share by rebound.\n\n\"My dear chevalier, a wedding present.\"\n\n\"How a wedding present?\"\n\n\"Eh! yes, I am going to be married,\" replied the Duc d'Anjou, without\nperceiving, at the moment, he was passing the prince and Athos, who both\nbowed respectfully.\n\nThe chevalier darted at the young duke a glance so strange, and so\nmalicious, that the Comte de la Fere quite started on beholding it.\n\n\"You! you to be married!\" repeated he; \"oh! that's impossible. You would\nnot commit such a folly!\"\n\n\"Bah! I don't do it myself; I am made to do it,\" replied the Duc\nd'Anjou. \"But come, quick! let us get rid of our money.\" Thereupon he\ndisappeared with his companion, laughing and talking, whilst all heads\nwere bowed on his passage.\n\n\"Then,\" whispered the prince to Athos, \"that is the secret.\"\n\n\"It was not I who told you so, my lord.\"\n\n\"He is to marry the sister of Charles II.?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\nThe prince reflected for a moment, and his eye shot forth one of its not\ninfrequent flashes. \"Humph!\" said he slowly, as if speaking to himself;\n\"our swords are once more to be hung on the wall--for a long time!\" and\nhe sighed.\n\nAll that sigh contained of ambition silently stifled, of extinguished\nillusions and disappointed hopes, Athos alone divined, for he alone\nheard that sigh. Immediately after, the prince took leave and the king\nleft the apartment. Athos, by a sign made to Bragelonne, renewed the\ndesire he had expressed at the beginning of the scene. By degrees the\nchamber was deserted, and Mazarin was left alone, a prey to suffering\nwhich he could no longer dissemble. \"Bernouin! Bernouin!\" cried he in a\nbroken voice.\n\n\"What does monseigneur want?\"\n\n\"Guenaud--let Guenaud be sent for,\" said his eminence. \"I think I'm\ndying.\"\n\nBernouin, in great terror, rushed into the cabinet to give the order,\nand the _piqueur_, who hastened to fetch the physician, passed the\nking's carriage in the Rue Saint Honore.\n\n\n\nChapter XLIII. Guenaud.\n\nThe cardinal's order was pressing; Guenaud quickly obeyed it. He found\nhis patient stretched on his bed, his legs swelled, his face livid, and\nhis stomach collapsed. Mazarin had a severe attack of gout. He suffered\ntortures with the impatience of a man who has not been accustomed to\nresistances. On seeing Guenaud: \"Ah!\" said he; \"now I am saved!\"\n\nGuenaud was a very learned and circumspect man, who stood in no need of\nthe critiques of Boileau to obtain a reputation. When facing a disease,\nif it were personified in a king, he treated the patient as a Turk\ntreats a Moor. He did not, therefore, reply to Mazarin as the minister\nexpected: \"Here is the doctor; good-bye disease!\" On the contrary, on\nexamining his patient, with a very serious air:\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said he.\n\n\"Eh! what! Guenaud! How you look at me!\"\n\n\"I look as I should on seeing your complaint, my lord; it is a very\ndangerous one.\"\n\n\"The gout--oh! yes, the gout.\"\n\n\"With complications, my lord.\"\n\nMazarin raised himself upon his elbow, and, questioning by look and\ngesture: \"What do you mean by that? Am I worse than I believe myself to\nbe?\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said Guenaud, seating himself beside the bed; \"your eminence\nhas worked very hard during your life; your eminence has suffered much.\"\n\n\"But I am not old, I fancy. The late M. de Richelieu was but seventeen\nmonths younger than I am when he died, and died of a mortal disease. I\nam young, Guenaud: remember, I am scarcely fifty-two.\"\n\n\"Oh! my lord, you are much more than that. How long did the Fronde\nlast?\"\n\n\"For what purpose do you put such a question to me?\"\n\n\"For a medical calculation, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Well, some ten years--off and on.\"\n\n\"Very well; be kind enough to reckon every year of the Fronde as three\nyears--that makes thirty; now twenty and fifty-two makes seventy-two\nyears. You are seventy-two, my lord; and that is a great age.\"\n\nWhilst saying this, he felt the pulse of his patient. This pulse\nwas full of such fatal indications, that the physician continued,\nnotwithstanding the interruptions of the patient: \"Put down the years of\nthe Fronde at four each, and you have lived eighty-two years.\"\n\n\"Are you speaking seriously, Guenaud?\"\n\n\"Alas! yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"You take a roundabout way, then, to inform me that I am very ill?\"\n\n\"_Ma foi!_ yes, my lord, and with a man of the mind and courage of your\neminence, it ought not to be necessary to do so.\"\n\nThe cardinal breathed with such difficulty that he inspired pity even\nin a pitiless physician. \"There are diseases and diseases,\" resumed\nMazarin. \"From some of them people escape.\"\n\n\"That is true, my lord.\"\n\n\"Is it not?\" cried Mazarin, almost joyously; \"for, in short, what else\nwould be the use of power, of strength of will? What would the use of\ngenius be--your genius, Guenaud? What would be the use of science and\nart, if the patient, who disposes of all that, cannot be saved from\nperil?\"\n\nGuenaud was about to open his mouth, but Mazarin continued:\n\n\"Remember,\" said he, \"I am the most confiding of your patients; remember\nI obey you blindly, and that consequently--\"\n\n\"I know all that,\" said Guenaud.\n\n\"I shall be cured, then?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, there is neither strength of will, nor power, nor genius,\nnor science that can resist a disease which God doubtless sends, or\nwhich He cast upon the earth at the creation, with full power to destroy\nand kill mankind. When the disease is mortal, and nothing can--\"\n\n\"Is--my--disease--mortal?\" asked Mazarin.\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\nHis eminence sank down for a moment, like an unfortunate wretch who is\ncrushed by a falling column. But the spirit of Mazarin was a strong one,\nor rather his mind was a firm one. \"Guenaud,\" said he, recovering from\nhis first shock, \"you will permit me to appeal from your judgment. I\nwill call together the most learned men of Europe: I will consult them.\nI will live, in short, by the virtue of I care not what remedy.\"\n\n\"My lord must not suppose,\" said Guenaud, \"that I have the presumption\nto pronounce alone upon an existence so valuable as yours. I have\nalready assembled all the good physicians and practitioners of France\nand Europe. There were twelve of them.\"\n\n\"And they said--\"\n\n\"They said that your eminence was suffering from a mortal disease; I\nhave the consultation signed in my portfolio. If your eminence will\nplease to see it, you will find the names of all the incurable diseases\nwe have met with. There is first--\"\n\n\"No, no!\" cried Mazarin, pushing away the paper. \"No, no, Guenaud,\nI yield! I yield!\" And a profound silence, during which the cardinal\nresumed his senses and recovered his strength, succeeded to the\nagitation of this scene. \"There is another thing,\" murmured Mazarin;\n\"there are empirics and charlatans. In my country, those whom physicians\nabandon run the chance of a quack, who kills them ten times but saves\nthem a hundred times.\"\n\n\"Has not your eminence observed, that during the last month I have\nchanged my remedies ten times?\"\n\n\"Yes. Well?\"\n\n\"Well, I have spent fifty thousand crowns in purchasing the secrets of\nall these fellows: the list is exhausted, and so is my purse. You are\nnot cured: and, but for my art, you would be dead.\"\n\n\"That ends it!\" murmured the cardinal; \"that ends it.\" And he threw a\nmelancholy look upon the riches which surrounded him. \"And must I quit\nall that?\" sighed he. \"I am dying, Guenaud! I am dying!\"\n\n\"Oh! not yet, my lord,\" said the physician.\n\nMazarin seized his hand. \"In what time?\" asked he, fixing his two large\neyes upon the impassible countenance of the physician.\n\n\"My lord, we never tell that.\"\n\n\"To ordinary men, perhaps not;--but to me--to me, whose every minute is\nworth a treasure. Tell me, Guenaud, tell me!\"\n\n\"No, no, my lord.\"\n\n\"I insist upon it, I tell you. Oh! give me a month, and for every one of\nthose thirty days I will pay you a hundred thousand crowns.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied Guenaud, in a firm voice, \"it is God who can give you\ndays of grace, and not I. God only allows you a fortnight.\"\n\nThe cardinal breathed a painful sigh, and sank back down upon his\npillow, murmuring, \"Thank you, Guenaud, thank you!\"\n\nThe physician was about to depart; the dying man, raising himself up:\n\"Silence!\" said he, with flaming eyes, \"silence!\"\n\n\"My lord, I have known this secret two months; you see that I have kept\nit faithfully.\"\n\n\"Go, Guenaud; I will take care of your fortunes; go, and tell Brienne to\nsend me a clerk called M. Colbert. Go!\"\n\n\n\nChapter XLIV. Colbert.\n\nColbert was not far off. During the whole evening he had remained in one\nof the corridors, chatting with Bernouin and Brienne, and commenting,\nwith the ordinary skill of people of court, upon the news which\ndeveloped like air-bubbles upon the water, on the surface of each\nevent. It is doubtless time to trace, in a few words, one of the most\ninteresting portraits of the age, and to trace it with as much truth,\nperhaps, as contemporary painters have been able to do. Colbert was a\nman in whom the historian and the moralist have an equal right.\n\nHe was thirteen years older than Louis XIV., his future master. Of\nmiddle height, rather lean than otherwise, he had deep-set eyes, a\nmean appearance, his hair was coarse, black and thin, which, say the\nbiographers of his time, made him take early to the skull-cap. A look of\nseverity, of harshness even, a sort of stiffness, which, with inferiors,\nwas pride, with superiors an affectation of superior virtue; a surly\ncast of countenance upon all occasions, even when looking at himself in\na glass alone--such is the exterior of his personage. As to the moral\npart of his character, the depth of his talent for accounts, and his\ningenuity in making sterility itself productive, were much boasted of.\nColbert had formed the idea of forcing governors of frontier places to\nfeed the garrisons without pay, with what they drew from contributions.\nSuch a valuable quality made Mazarin think of replacing Joubert, his\nintendant, who had recently died, by M. Colbert, who had such skill\nin nibbling down allowances. Colbert by degrees crept into court,\nnotwithstanding his lowly birth, for he was the son of a man who sold\nwine as his father had done, but who afterwards sold cloth, and then\nsilk stuffs. Colbert, destined for trade, had been clerk in Lyons to\na merchant, whom he had quitted to come to Paris in the office of a\nChatlet procureur named Biterne. It was here he learned the art of\ndrawing up an account, and the much more valuable one of complicating\nit.\n\nThis stiffness of manner in Colbert had been of great service to him; it\nis so true that Fortune, when she has a caprice, resembles those women\nof antiquity, who, when they had a fancy, were disgusted by no physical\nor moral defects in either men or things. Colbert, placed with Michel\nLetellier, secretary of state in 1648, by his cousin Colbert, Seigneur\nde Saint-Penange, who protected him, received one day from the minister\na commission for Cardinal Mazarin. His eminence was then in the\nenjoyment of flourishing health, and the bad years of the Fronde had\nnot yet counted triple and quadruple for him. He was at Sedan, very much\nannoyed at a court intrigue in which Anne of Austria seemed inclined to\ndesert his cause.\n\nOf this intrigue Letellier held the thread. He had just received a\nletter from Anne of Austria, a letter very valuable to him, and strongly\ncompromising Mazarin; but, as he already played the double part which\nserved him so well, and by which he always managed two enemies so as to\ndraw advantage from both, either by embroiling them more and more or\nby reconciling them, Michel Letellier wished to send Anne of Austria's\nletter to Mazarin, in order that he might be acquainted with it,\nand consequently pleased with his having so willingly rendered him a\nservice. To send the letter was an easy matter; to recover it again,\nafter having communicated it, that was the difficulty. Letellier cast\nhis eyes around him, and seeing the black and meager clerk with the\nscowling brow, scribbling away in his office, he preferred him to the\nbest gendarme for the execution of this design.\n\nColbert was commanded to set out for Sedan, with positive orders to\ncarry the letter to Mazarin, and bring it back to Letellier. He listened\nto his orders with scrupulous attention, required the instructions to be\nrepeated twice, and was particular in learning whether the bringing back\nwas as necessary as the communicating, and Letellier replied sternly,\n\"More necessary.\" Then he set out, traveled like a courier, without any\ncare for his body, and placed in the hands of Mazarin, first a letter\nfrom Letellier, which announced to the cardinal the sending of the\nprecious letter, and then that letter itself. Mazarin colored greatly\nwhilst reading Anne of Austria's letter, gave Colbert a gracious smile\nand dismissed him.\n\n\"When shall I have the answer, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"To-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\nThe clerk turned upon his heel, after making his very best bow. The next\nday he was at his post at seven o'clock. Mazarin made him wait till\nten. He remained patiently in the ante-chamber; his turn having come,\nhe entered; Mazarin gave him a sealed packet. On the envelope of this\npacket were these words:--Monsieur Michel Letellier, etc. Colbert\nlooked at the packet with much attention; the cardinal put on a pleasant\ncountenance and pushed him towards the door.\n\n\"And the letter of the queen-mother, my lord?\" asked Colbert.\n\n\"It is in with the rest, in the packet,\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"Oh! very well,\" replied Colbert; and placing his hat between his knees,\nhe began to unseal the packet.\n\nMazarin uttered a cry. \"What are you doing?\" said he, angrily.\n\n\"I am unsealing the packet, my lord.\"\n\n\"You mistrust me, then, master pedant, do you? Did any one ever see such\nimpertinence?\"\n\n\"Oh! my lord, do not be angry with me! It is certainly not your\neminence's word I place in doubt, God forbid!\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"It is the carefulness of your chancery, my lord. What is a letter? A\nrag. May not a rag be forgotten? And look, my lord, look if I was not\nright. Your clerks have forgotten the rag; the letter is not in the\npacket.\"\n\n\"You are an insolent fellow, and you have not looked,\" cried Mazarin,\nvery angrily; \"begone and wait my pleasure.\" Whilst saying these words,\nwith perfectly Italian subtlety he snatched the packet from the hands of\nColbert, and re-entered his apartments.\n\nBut this anger could not last so long as to be replaced in time by\nreason. Mazarin, every morning, on opening his closet door, found\nthe figure of Colbert like a sentinel behind the bench, and this\ndisagreeable figure never failed to ask him humbly, but with tenacity,\nfor the queen-mother's letter. Mazarin could hold out no longer, and\nwas obliged to give it up. He accompanied this restitution with a most\nsevere reprimand, during which Colbert contented himself with examining,\nfeeling, even smelling, as it were, the paper, the characters, and\nthe signature, neither more nor less than if he had to deal with the\ngreatest forger in the kingdom. Mazarin behaved still more rudely to\nhim, but Colbert, still impassible, having obtained a certainty that the\nletter was the true one, went off as if he had been deaf. This conduct\nobtained for him afterwards the post of Joubert; for Mazarin, instead\nof bearing malice, admired him, and was desirous of attaching so much\nfidelity to himself.\n\nIt may be judged by this single anecdote, what the character of Colbert\nwas. Events, developing themselves, by degrees allowed all the powers of\nhis mind to act freely. Colbert was not long in insinuating himself to\nthe good graces of the cardinal: he became even indispensable to him.\nThe clerk was acquainted with all his accounts without the cardinal's\never having spoken to him about them. This secret between them was a\npowerful tie, and this was why, when about to appear before the Master\nof another world, Mazarin was desirous of taking good counsel in\ndisposing the wealth he was so unwillingly obliged to leave in this\nworld. After the visit of Guenaud, he therefore sent for Colbert,\ndesired him to sit down, and said to him: \"Let us converse, Monsieur\nColbert, and seriously, for I am very ill, and I may chance to die.\"\n\n\"Man is mortal,\" replied Colbert.\n\n\"I have always remembered that, M. Colbert, and I have worked with that\nend in view. You know that I have amassed a little wealth.\"\n\n\"I know you have, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"At how much do you estimate, as near as you can, the amount of this\nwealth, M. Colbert?\"\n\n\"At forty millions, five hundred and sixty thousand, two hundred livres,\nnine cents, eight farthings,\" replied Colbert.\n\nThe cardinal heaved a deep sigh, and looked at Colbert with wonder, but\nhe allowed a smile to steal across his lips.\n\n\"Known money,\" added Colbert, in reply to that smile.\n\nThe cardinal gave quite a start in bed. \"What do you mean by that?\" said\nhe.\n\n\"I mean,\" said Colbert, \"that besides those forty millions, five hundred\nand sixty thousand, two hundred livres, nine cents, eight farthings,\nthere are thirteen millions that are not known.\"\n\n\"_Ouf!_\" sighed Mazarin, \"what a man!\"\n\nAt this moment, the head of Bernouin appeared through the embrasure of\nthe door.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Mazarin, \"and why do you disturb me?\"\n\n\"The Theatin father, your eminence's director, was sent for this\nevening; and he cannot come again to my lord till after to-morrow.\"\n\nMazarin looked a Colbert, who rose and took his hat, saying: \"I shall\ncome again, my lord.\"\n\nMazarin hesitated. \"No, no,\" said he; \"I have as much business to\ntransact with you as with him. Besides, you are my other confessor--and\nwhat I have to say to one the other may hear. Remain where you are,\nColbert.\"\n\n\"But my lord, if there be no secret of penitence, will the director\nconsent to my being here?\"\n\n\"Do not trouble yourself about that; come into the _ruelle_.\"\n\n\"I can wait outside, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"No, no, it will do you good to hear the confession of a rich man.\"\n\nColbert bowed and went into the _ruelle_.\n\n\"Introduce the Theatin father,\" said Mazarin, closing the curtains.\n\n\n\nChapter XLV. Confession of a Man of Wealth.\n\nThe Theatin entered deliberately, without being too much astonished\nat the noise and agitation which anxiety for the cardinal's health had\nraised in his household. \"Come in, my reverend father,\" said Mazarin,\nafter a last look at the _ruelle_, \"come in and console me.\"\n\n\"That is my duty, my lord,\" replied the Theatin.\n\n\"Begin by sitting down, and making yourself comfortable, for I am going\nto begin with a general confession; you will afterwards give me a good\nabsolution, and I shall believe myself more tranquil.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said the father, \"you are not so ill as to make a general\nconfession urgent--and it will be very fatiguing--take care.\"\n\n\"You suspect, then, that it may be long, father?\"\n\n\"How can I think it otherwise, when a man has lived so completely as\nyour eminence has done?\"\n\n\"Ah! that is true!--yes--the recital may be long.\"\n\n\"The mercy of God is great,\" snuffled the Theatin.\n\n\"Stop,\" said Mazarin; \"there I begin to terrify myself with having\nallowed so many things to pass which the Lord might reprove.\"\n\n\"Is that not always so?\" said the Theatin naively, removing further from\nthe lamp his thin pointed face, like that of a mole. \"Sinners are so\nforgetful beforehand, and scrupulous when it is too late.\"\n\n\"Sinners?\" replied Mazarin. \"Do you use that word ironically, and to\nreproach me with all the genealogies I have allowed to be made on my\naccount--I--the son of a fisherman, in fact?\"\n\n[This is quite untranslatable--it being a play upon the words _pecheur_\n(with a grave over the first e), a sinner, and _pecheur_ (with an\naccent circumflex over the first e), a fisherman. It is in very bad\ntaste.--TRANS.]\n\n\"Hum!\" said the Theatin.\n\n\"That is a first sin, father; for I have allowed myself made to descend\nfrom two old Roman consuls, S. Geganius Macerinus 1st, Macerinus 2d, and\nProculus Macerinus 3d, of whom the Chronicle of Haolander speaks.\nFrom Macerinus to Mazarin the proximity was tempting. Macerinus, a\ndiminutive, means leanish, poorish, out of case. Oh! reverend father!\nMazarini may now be carried to the augmentative _Maigre_, thin as\nLazarus. Look!\"--and he showed his fleshless arms.\n\n\"In your having been born of a family of fishermen I see nothing\ninjurious to you; for--St. Peter was a fisherman; and if you are a\nprince of the church, my lord, he was the supreme head of it. Pass on,\nif you please.\"\n\n\"So much the more for my having threatened with the Bastile a certain\nBounet, a priest of Avignon, who wanted to publish a genealogy of the\nCasa Mazarini much too marvelous.\"\n\n\"To be probable?\" replied the Theatin.\n\n\"Oh! if I had acted up to his idea, father, that would have been the\nvice of pride--another sin.\"\n\n\"It was an excess of wit, and a person is not to be reproached with such\nsorts of abuses. Pass on, pass on!\"\n\n\"I was all pride. Look you, father, I will endeavor to divide that into\ncapital sins.\"\n\n\"I like divisions, when well made.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that. You must know that in 1630--alas! that is thirty-one\nyears ago--\"\n\n\"You were then twenty-nine years old, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"A hot-headed age. I was then something of a soldier, and I threw myself\nat Casal into the arquebusades, to show that I rode on horseback as well\nas an officer. It is true, I restored peace between the French and the\nSpaniards. That redeems my sin a little.\"\n\n\"I see no sin in being able to ride well on horseback,\" said the\nTheatin; \"that is in perfect good taste, and does honor to our gown. As\na Christian, I approve of your having prevented the effusion of blood;\nas a monk, I am proud of the bravery a monk has exhibited.\"\n\nMazarin bowed his head humbly. \"Yes,\" said he, \"but the consequences?\"\n\n\"What consequences?\"\n\n\"Eh! that damned sin of pride has roots without end. From the time\nthat I threw myself in that manner between two armies, that I had smelt\npowder and faced lines of soldiers, I have held generals a little in\ncontempt.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the father.\n\n\"There is the evil; so that I have not found one endurable since that\ntime.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said the Theatin, \"that the generals we have had have not\nbeen remarkable.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Mazarin, \"there was Monsieur le Prince. I have tormented him\nthoroughly!\"\n\n\"He is not much to be pitied: he has acquired sufficient glory, and\nsufficient wealth.\"\n\n\"That may be, for Monsieur le Prince; but M. Beaufort, for example--whom\nI held suffering so long in the dungeon of Vincennes?\"\n\n\"Ah! but he was a rebel, and the safety of the state required that you\nshould make a sacrifice. Pass on!\"\n\n\"I believe I have exhausted pride. There is another sin which I am\nafraid to qualify.\"\n\n\"I can qualify it myself. Tell it.\"\n\n\"A great sin, reverend father!\"\n\n\"We shall judge, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"You cannot fail to have heard of certain relations which I have\nhad--with her majesty the queen-mother;--the malevolent--\"\n\n\"The malevolent, my lord, are fools. Was it not necessary for the good\nof the state and the interests of the young king, that you should live\nin good intelligence with the queen? Pass on, pass on!\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" said Mazarin, \"you remove a terrible weight from my\nbreast.\"\n\n\"These are all trifles!--look for something serious.\"\n\n\"I have had much ambition, father.\"\n\n\"That is the march of great minds and things, my lord.\"\n\n\"Even the longing for the tiara?\"\n\n\"To be pope is to be the first of Christians. Why should you not desire\nthat?\"\n\n\"It has been printed that, to gain that object, I had sold Cambria to\nthe Spaniards.\"\n\n\"You have, perhaps, yourself written pamphlets without severely\npersecuting pamphleteers.\"\n\n\"Then, reverend father, I have truly a clean breast. I feel nothing\nremaining but slight peccadilloes.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"Play.\"\n\n\"That is rather worldly: but you were obliged by the duties of greatness\nto keep a good house.\"\n\n\"I like to win.\"\n\n\"No player plays to lose.\"\n\n\"I cheated a little.\"\n\n\"You took your advantage. Pass on.\"\n\n\"Well! reverend father, I feel nothing else upon my conscience. Give me\nabsolution, and my soul will be able, when God shall please to call it,\nto mount without obstacle to the throne--\"\n\nThe Theatin moved neither his arms nor his lips. \"What are you waiting\nfor, father?\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"I am waiting for the end.\"\n\n\"The end of what?\"\n\n\"Of the confession, monsieur.\"\n\n\"But I have ended.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; your eminence is mistaken.\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"Search diligently.\"\n\n\"I have searched as well as possible.\"\n\n\"Then I shall assist your memory.\"\n\n\"Do.\"\n\nThe Theatin coughed several times. \"You have said nothing of avarice,\nanother capital sin, nor of those millions,\" said he.\n\n\"What millions, father?\"\n\n\"Why, those you possess, my lord.\"\n\n\"Father, that money is mine, why should I speak to you about that?\"\n\n\"Because, you see, our opinions differ. You say that money is yours,\nwhilst I--I believe it is rather the property of others.\"\n\nMazarin lifted his cold hand to his brow, which was beaded with\nperspiration. \"How so?\" stammered he.\n\n\"This way. Your excellency had gained much wealth--in the service of the\nking.\"\n\n\"Hum! much--that is, not too much.\"\n\n\"Whatever it may be, whence came that wealth?\"\n\n\"From the state.\"\n\n\"The state; that is the king.\"\n\n\"But what do you conclude from that, father?\" said Mazarin, who began to\ntremble.\n\n\"I cannot conclude without seeing a list of the riches you possess. Let\nus reckon a little, if you please. You have the bishopric of Metz?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The abbeys of St. Clement, St. Arnould, and St. Vincent, all at Metz?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You have the abbey of St. Denis, in France, magnificent property?\"\n\n\"Yes, father.\"\n\n\"You have the abbey of Cluny, which is rich?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"That of St. Medard at Soissons, with a revenue of one hundred thousand\nlivres?\"\n\n\"I cannot deny it.\"\n\n\"That of St. Victor, at Marseilles,--one of the best in the south?\"\n\n\"Yes father.\"\n\n\"A good million a year. With the emoluments of the cardinalship and the\nministry, I say too little when I say two millions a year.\"\n\n\"Eh!\"\n\n\"In ten years that is twenty millions--and twenty millions put out\nat fifty per cent. give, by progression, twenty-three millions in ten\nyears.\"\n\n\"How well you reckon for a Theatin!\"\n\n\"Since your eminence placed our order in the convent we occupy, near St.\nGermain des Pres, in 1644, I have kept the accounts of the society.\"\n\n\"And mine likewise, apparently, father.\"\n\n\"One ought to know a little of everything, my lord.\"\n\n\"Very well. Conclude, at present.\"\n\n\"I conclude that your baggage is too heavy to allow you to pass through\nthe gates of Paradise.\"\n\n\"Shall I be damned?\"\n\n\"If you do not make restitution, yes.\"\n\nMazarin uttered a piteous cry. \"Restitution!--but to whom, good God?\"\n\n\"To the owner of that money,--to the king.\"\n\n\"But the king did not give it all to me.\"\n\n\"One moment,--does not the king sign the _ordonances_?\"\n\nMazarin passed from sighs to groans. \"Absolution! absolution!\" cried he.\n\n\"Impossible, my lord. Restitution! restitution!\" replied the Theatin.\n\n\"But you absolve me from all other sins, why not from that?\"\n\n\"Because,\" replied the father, \"to absolve you for that motive would be\na sin for which the king would never absolve me, my lord.\"\n\nThereupon the confessor quitted his penitent with an air full of\ncompunction. He then went out in the same manner he had entered.\n\n\"Oh, good God!\" groaned the cardinal. \"Come here, Colbert, I am very,\nvery ill indeed, my friend.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XLVI. The Donation.\n\nColbert reappeared beneath the curtains.\n\n\"Have you heard?\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"Alas! yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Can he be right? Can all this money be badly acquired?\"\n\n\"A Theatin, monseigneur, is a bad judge in matters of finance,\" replied\nColbert, coolly. \"And yet it is very possible that, according to his\ntheological views, your eminence has been, in a certain degree, in the\nwrong. People generally find they have been so,--when they die.\"\n\n\"In the first place, they commit the wrong of dying, Colbert.\"\n\n\"That is true, my lord. Against whom, however, did the Theatin make out\nthat you had committed these wrongs? Against the king?\"\n\nMazarin shrugged his shoulders. \"As if I had not saved both his state\nand his finances.\"\n\n\"That admits of no contradiction, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does it? Then I have received a merely legitimate salary, in spite of\nthe opinion of my confessor?\"\n\n\"That is beyond doubt.\"\n\n\"And I might fairly keep for my own family, which is so needy, a good\nfortune,--the whole, even, of which I have earned?\"\n\n\"I see no impediment to that, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"I felt assured that in consulting you, Colbert, I should have good\nadvice,\" replied Mazarin, greatly delighted.\n\nColbert resumed his pedantic look. \"My lord,\" interrupted he, \"I think\nit would be quite as well to examine whether what the Theatin said is\nnot a _snare_.\"\n\n\"Oh! no; a snare? What for? The Theatin is an honest man.\"\n\n\"He believed your eminence to be at death's door, because your eminence\nconsulted him. Did I not hear him say--'Distinguish that which the king\nhas given you from that which you have given yourself.' Recollect, my\nlord, if he did not say something a little like that to you?--that is\nquite a theatrical speech.\"\n\n\"That is possible.\"\n\n\"In which case, my lord, I should consider you as required by the\nTheatin to--\"\n\n\"To make restitution!\" cried Mazarin, with great warmth.\n\n\"Eh! I do not say no.\"\n\n\"What, of all! You do not dream of such a thing! You speak just as the\nconfessor did.\"\n\n\"To make restitution of a part,--that is to say, his majesty's part; and\nthat, monseigneur, may have its dangers. Your eminence is too skillful a\npolitician not to know that, at this moment, the king does not possess a\nhundred and fifty thousand livres clear in his coffers.\"\n\n\"That is not my affair,\" said Mazarin, triumphantly; \"that belongs to M.\nle Surintendant Fouquet, whose accounts I gave you to verify some months\nago.\"\n\nColbert bit his lips at the name of Fouquet. \"His majesty,\" said he,\nbetween his teeth, \"has no money but that which M. Fouquet collects:\nyour money, monseigneur, would afford him a delicious banquet.\"\n\n\"Well, but I am not the superintendent of his majesty's finances--I\nhave my purse--surely I would do much for his majesty's welfare--some\nlegacy--but I cannot disappoint my family.\"\n\n\"The legacy of a part would dishonor you and offend the king. Leaving\na part to his majesty, is to avow that that part has inspired you with\ndoubts as to the lawfulness of the means of acquisition.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Colbert!\"\n\n\"I thought your eminence did me the honor to ask my advice?\"\n\n\"Yes, but you are ignorant of the principal details of the question.\"\n\n\"I am ignorant of nothing, my lord; during ten years, all the columns\nof figures which are found in France, have passed into review before me;\nand if I have painfully nailed them into my brain, they are there now\nso well riveted, that, from the office of M. Letellier, who is sober,\nto the little secret largesses of M. Fouquet, who is prodigal, I could\nrecite, figure by figure, all the money that is spent in France from\nMarseilles to Cherbourg.\"\n\n\"Then, you would have me throw all my money into the coffers of the\nking!\" cried Mazarin, ironically; and from whom, at the same time the\ngout forced painful moans. \"Surely the king would reproach me with\nnothing, but he would laugh at me, while squandering my millions, and\nwith good reason.\"\n\n\"Your eminence has misunderstood me. I did not, the least in the world,\npretend that his majesty ought to spend your money.\"\n\n\"You said so, clearly, it seems to me, when you advised me to give it to\nhim.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" replied Colbert, \"that is because your eminence, absorbed as you\nare by your disease, entirely loses sight of the character of Louis\nXIV.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"That character, if I may venture to express myself thus, resembles that\nwhich my lord confessed just now to the Theatin.\"\n\n\"Go on--that is?\"\n\n\"Pride! Pardon me, my lord, haughtiness, nobleness; kings have no pride,\nthat is a human passion.\"\n\n\"Pride,--yes, you are right. Next?\"\n\n\"Well, my lord, if I have divined rightly, your eminence has but to give\nall your money to the king, and that immediately.\"\n\n\"But for what?\" said Mazarin, quite bewildered.\n\n\"Because the king will not accept of the whole.\"\n\n\"What, and he a young man, and devoured by ambition?\"\n\n\"Just so.\"\n\n\"A young man who is anxious for my death--\"\n\n\"My lord!\"\n\n\"To inherit, yes, Colbert, yes; he is anxious for my death, in order to\ninherit. Triple fool that I am! I would prevent him!\"\n\n\"Exactly: if the donation were made in a certain form he would refuse\nit.\"\n\n\"Well; but how?\"\n\n\"That is plain enough. A young man who has yet done nothing--who burns\nto distinguish himself--who burns to reign alone, will never take\nanything ready built, he will construct for himself. This prince,\nmonseigneur, will never be content with the Palais Royal, which M. de\nRichelieu left him, nor with the Palais Mazarin, which you have had\nso superbly constructed, nor with the Louvre, which his ancestors\ninhabited; nor with St. Germain, where he was born. All that does not\nproceed from himself, I predict, he will disdain.\"\n\n\"And you will guarantee, that if I give my forty millions to the king--\"\n\n\"Saying certain things to him at the same time, I guarantee he will\nrefuse them.\"\n\n\"But those things--what are they?\"\n\n\"I will write them, if my lord will have the goodness to dictate them.\"\n\n\"Well, but, after all, what advantage will that be to me?\"\n\n\"An enormous one. Nobody will afterwards be able to accuse your eminence\nof that unjust avarice with which pamphleteers have reproached the most\nbrilliant mind of the present age.\"\n\n\"You are right, Colbert, you are right; go, and seek the king, on my\npart, and take him my will.\"\n\n\"Your donation, my lord.\"\n\n\"But, if he should accept it; if he should even think of accepting it!\"\n\n\"Then there would remain thirteen millions for your family, and that is\na good round sum.\"\n\n\"But then you would be either a fool or a traitor.\"\n\n\"And I am neither the one nor the other, my lord. You appear to be much\nafraid that the king will accept; you have a deal more reason to fear\nthat he will not accept.\"\n\n\"But, see you, if he does not accept, I should like to guarantee my\nthirteen reserved millions to him--yes, I will do so--yes. But my pains\nare returning, I shall faint. I am very, very ill, Colbert; I am near my\nend!\"\n\nColbert started. The cardinal was indeed very ill; large drops of sweat\nflowed down upon his bed of agony, and the frightful pallor of a\nface streaming with water was a spectacle which the most hardened\npractitioner could not have beheld without much compassion. Colbert was,\nwithout doubt, very much affected, for he quitted the chamber, calling\nBernouin to attend to the dying man, and went into the corridor. There,\nwalking about with a meditative expression, which almost gave nobility\nto his vulgar head, his shoulders thrown up, his neck stretched out,\nhis lips half open, to give vent to unconnected fragments of incoherent\nthoughts, he lashed up his courage to the pitch of the undertaking\ncontemplated, whilst within ten paces of him, separated only by a wall,\nhis master was being stifled by anguish which drew from him lamentable\ncries, thinking no more of the treasures of the earth, or of the joys\nof Paradise, but much of all the horrors of hell. Whilst burning-hot\nnapkins, physic, revulsives, and Guenaud, who was recalled, were\nperforming their functions with increased activity, Colbert, holding\nhis great head in both his hands, to compress within it the fever of\nthe projects engendered by the brain, was meditating the tenor of the\ndonation he would make Mazarin write, at the first hour of respite his\ndisease should afford him. It would appear as if all the cries of the\ncardinal, and all the attacks of death upon this representative of the\npast, were stimulants for the genius of this thinker with the\nbushy eyebrows, who was turning already towards the rising sun of a\nregenerated society. Colbert resumed his place at Mazarin's pillow at\nthe first interval of pain, and persuaded him to dictate a donation thus\nconceived.\n\n\"About to appear before God, the Master of mankind, I beg the king,\nwho was my master on earth, to resume the wealth which his bounty has\nbestowed upon me, and which my family would be happy to see pass\ninto such illustrious hands. The particulars of my property will be\nfound--they are drawn up--at the first requisition of his majesty, or at\nthe last sigh of his most devoted servant,\n\n\"JULES, _Cardinal de Mazarin._\"\n\nThe cardinal sighed heavily as he signed this; Colbert sealed the\npacket, and carried it immediately to the Louvre, whither the king had\nreturned.\n\nHe then went back to his own home, rubbing his hands with the confidence\nof workman who has done a good day's work.\n\n\n\nChapter XLVII. How Anne of Austria gave one Piece of Advice to Louis\nXIV., and how M. Fouquet gave him Another.\n\nThe news of the extreme illness of the cardinal had already spread, and\nattracted at least as much attention among the people of the Louvre\nas the news of the marriage of Monsieur, the king's brother, which had\nalready been announced as an official fact. Scarcely had Louis XIV.\nreturned home, with his thoughts fully occupied with the various things\nhe had seen and heard in the course of the evening, when an usher\nannounced that the same crowd of courtiers who, in the morning, had\nthronged his _lever_, presented themselves again at his _coucher_, a\nremarkable piece of respect which, during the reign of the cardinal,\nthe court, not very discreet in its performance, had accorded to the\nminister, without caring about displeasing the king.\n\nBut the minister had had, as we have said, an alarming attack of gout,\nand the tide of flattery was mounting towards the throne. Courtiers have\na marvelous instinct in scenting the turn of events; courtiers possess\na supreme kind of science; they are diplomatists in throwing light upon\nthe unraveling of complicated intrigues, captains in divining the issue\nof battles, and physicians in curing the sick. Louis XIV., to whom his\nmother had taught this axiom, together with many others, understood at\nonce that the cardinal must be very ill.\n\nScarcely had Anne of Austria conducted the young queen to her apartments\nand taken from her brow the head-dress of ceremony, when she went to see\nher son in his cabinet, where, alone, melancholy, and depressed, he was\nindulging, as if to exercise his will, in one of those terrible inward\npassions--king's passions--which create events when they break out, and\nwith Louis XIV., thanks to his astonishing command over himself, became\nsuch benign tempests, that his most violent, his only passion, that\nwhich Saint Simon mentions with astonishment, was that famous fit of\nanger which he exhibited fifty years later, on the occasion of a little\nconcealment of the Duc de Maine's, and which had for result a shower of\nblows inflicted with a cane upon the back of a poor valet who had stolen\na biscuit. The young king then was, as we have seen, a prey to a\ndouble excitement; and he said to himself as he looked in a glass,\n\"O king!--king by name, and not in fact;--phantom, vain phantom art\nthou!--inert statue, which has no other power than that of provoking\nsalutations from courtiers, when wilt thou be able to raise thy velvet\narm, or clench thy silken hand? when wilt thou be able to open, for\nany purpose but to sigh, or smile, lips condemned to the motionless\nstupidity of the marbles in thy gallery?\"\n\nThen, passing his hand over his brow, and feeling the want of air, he\napproached a window, and looking down, saw below some horsemen talking\ntogether, and groups of timid observers. These horsemen were a fraction\nof the watch: the groups were busy portions of the people, to whom a\nking is always a curious thing, the same as a rhinoceros, a crocodile,\nor a serpent. He struck his brow with his open hand, crying,--\"King of\nFrance! what a title! People of France! what a heap of creatures! I\nhave just returned to my Louvre; my horses, just unharnessed, are still\nsmoking, and I have created interest enough to induce scarcely twenty\npersons to look at me as I passed. Twenty! what do I say? no; there were\nnot twenty anxious to see the king of France. There are not even ten\narchers to guard my palace of residence: archers, people, guards, all\nare at the Palais Royal! Why, my good God! have not I, the king, the\nright to ask of you all that?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said a voice, replying to his, and which sounded from the\nother side of the door of the cabinet, \"because at the Palais Royal\nlies all the gold,--that is to say, all the power of him who desires to\nreign.\"\n\nLouis turned round sharply. The voice which had pronounced these words\nwas that of Anne of Austria. The king started, and advanced towards\nher. \"I hope,\" said he, \"your majesty has paid no attention to the vain\ndeclamations which the solitude and disgust familiar to kings suggest to\nthe happiest dispositions?\"\n\n\"I only paid attention to one thing, my son, and that was, that you were\ncomplaining.\"\n\n\"Who! I? Not at all,\" said Louis XIV.; \"no, in truth, you err, madame.\"\n\n\"What were you doing, then?\"\n\n\"I thought I was under the ferule of my professor, and developing a\nsubject of amplification.\"\n\n\"My son,\" replied Anne of Austria, shaking her head, \"you are wrong not\nto trust my word; you are wrong not to grant me your confidence. A\nday will come, and perhaps quickly, wherein you will have occasion to\nremember that axiom:--'Gold is universal power; and they alone are kings\nwho are all-powerful.'\"\n\n\"Your intention,\" continued the king, \"was not, however, to cast blame\nupon the rich men of this age, was it?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the queen, warmly; \"no, sire; they who are rich in this age,\nunder your reign, are rich because you have been willing they should\nbe so, and I entertain against them neither malice nor envy; they have,\nwithout doubt, served your majesty sufficiently well for your majesty to\nhave permitted them to reward themselves. That is what I mean to say by\nthe words for which you reproach me.\"\n\n\"God forbid, madame, that I should ever reproach my mother with\nanything!\"\n\n\"Besides,\" continued Anne of Austria, \"the Lord never gives the goods\nof this world but for a season; the Lord--as correctives to honor and\nriches--the Lord has placed sufferings, sickness, and death; and no\none,\" added she, with a melancholy smile, which proved she made the\napplication of the funeral precept to herself, \"no man can take his\nwealth or greatness with him to the grave. It results, therefore, that\nthe young gather the abundant harvest prepared for them by the old.\"\n\nLouis listened with increased attention to the words which Anne of\nAustria, no doubt, pronounced with a view to console him. \"Madame,\" said\nhe, looking earnestly at his mother, \"one would almost say in truth that\nyou had something else to announce to me.\"\n\n\"I have absolutely nothing, my son; only you cannot have failed to\nremark that his eminence the cardinal is very ill.\"\n\nLouis looked at his mother, expecting some emotion in her voice, some\nsorrow in her countenance. The face of Anne of Austria appeared a little\nchanged, but that was from sufferings of quite a personal character.\nPerhaps the alteration was caused by the cancer which had begun to\nconsume her breast. \"Yes, madame,\" said the king; \"yes, M. de Mazarin is\nvery ill.\"\n\n\"And it would be a great loss to the kingdom if God were to summon his\neminence away. Is not that your opinion as well as mine, my son?\" said\nthe queen.\n\n\"Yes, madame; yes, certainly, it would be a great loss for the kingdom,\"\nsaid Louis, coloring; \"but the peril does not seem to me to be so great;\nbesides, the cardinal is still young.\" The king had scarcely ceased\nspeaking when an usher lifted the tapestry, and stood with a paper in\nhis hand, waiting for the king to speak to him.\n\n\"What have you there?\" asked the king.\n\n\"A message from M. de Mazarin,\" replied the usher.\n\n\"Give it to me,\" said the king; and he took the paper. But at the moment\nhe was about to open it, there was a great noise in the gallery, the\nante-chamber, and the court.\n\n\"Ah, ah,\" said Louis XIV., who doubtless knew the meaning of that\ntriple noise. \"How could I say there was but one king in France! I was\nmistaken, there are two.\"\n\nAs he spoke or thought thus, the door opened, and the superintendent\nof finances, Fouquet, appeared before his nominal master. It was he who\nmade the noise in the ante-chamber, it was his horse that made the noise\nin the courtyard. In addition to all this, a loud murmur was heard along\nhis passage, which did not die away till some time after he had passed.\nIt was this murmur which Louis XIV. regretted so deeply not hearing as\nhe passed, and dying away behind him.\n\n\"He is not precisely a king, as you fancy,\" said Anne of Austria to her\nson; \"he is only a man who is much too rich--that is all.\"\n\nWhilst saying these words, a bitter feeling gave to these words of the\nqueen a most hateful expression; whereas the brow of the king, calm and\nself-possessed, on the contrary, was without the slightest wrinkle. He\nnodded, therefore, familiarly to Fouquet, whilst he continued to unfold\nthe paper given to him by the usher. Fouquet perceived this movement,\nand with a politeness at once easy and respectful, advanced towards the\nqueen, so as not to disturb the king. Louis had opened the paper, and\nyet he did not read it. He listened to Fouquet paying the most charming\ncompliments to the queen upon her hand and arm. Anne of Austria's frown\nrelaxed a little, she even almost smiled. Fouquet perceived that the\nking, instead of reading, was looking at him; he turned half round,\ntherefore, and while continuing his conversation with the queen, faced\nthe king.\n\n\"You know, Monsieur Fouquet,\" said Louis, \"how ill M. Mazarin is?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, I know that,\" said Fouquet; \"in fact, he is very ill. I was\nat my country-house of Vaux when the news reached me; and the affair\nseemed so pressing that I left at once.\"\n\n\"You left Vaux this evening, monsieur?\"\n\n\"An hour and a half ago, yes, your majesty,\" said Fouquet, consulting a\nwatch, richly ornamented with diamonds.\n\n\"An hour and a half!\" said the king, still able to restrain his anger,\nbut not to conceal his astonishment.\n\n\"I understand you, sire. Your majesty doubts my word, and you have\nreason to do so; but I have really come in that time, though it is\nwonderful! I received from England three pairs of very fast horses, as\nI had been assured. They were placed at distances of four leagues apart,\nand I tried them this evening. They really brought me from Vaux to\nthe Louvre in an hour and a half, so your majesty sees I have not been\ncheated.\" The queen-mother smiled with something like secret envy. But\nFouquet caught her thought. \"Thus, madame,\" he promptly said, \"such\nhorses are made for kings, not for subjects; for kings ought never to\nyield to any one in anything.\"\n\nThe king looked up.\n\n\"And yet,\" interrupted Anne of Austria, \"you are not a king, that I know\nof, M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"Truly not, madame; therefore the horses only await the orders of his\nmajesty to enter the royal stables; and if I allowed myself to try\nthem, it was only for fear of offering to the king anything that was not\npositively wonderful.\"\n\nThe king became quite red.\n\n\"You know, Monsieur Fouquet,\" said the queen, \"that at the court of\nFrance it is not the custom for a subject to offer anything to his\nking.\"\n\nLouis started.\n\n\"I hoped, madame,\" said Fouquet, much agitated, \"that my love for his\nmajesty, my incessant desire to please him, would serve to compensate\nthe want of etiquette. It was not so much a present that I permitted\nmyself to offer, as the tribute I paid.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Monsieur Fouquet,\" said the king politely, \"and I am\ngratified by your intention, for I love good horses; but you know I\nam not very rich; you, who are my superintendent of finances, know it\nbetter than any one else. I am not able, then, however willing I may be,\nto purchase such a valuable set of horses.\"\n\nFouquet darted a haughty glance at the queen-mother, who appeared to\ntriumph at the false position in which the minister had placed himself,\nand replied:--\n\n\"Luxury is the virtue of kings, sire: it is luxury which makes them\nresemble God; it is by luxury they are more than other men. With luxury\na king nourishes his subjects, and honors them. Under the mild heat\nof this luxury of kings springs the luxury of individuals, a source of\nriches for the people. His majesty, by accepting the gift of these six\nincomparable horses, would stimulate the pride of his own breeders,\nof Limousin, Perche, and Normandy; and this emulation would have\nbeen beneficial to all. But the king is silent, and consequently I am\ncondemned.\"\n\nDuring this speech, Louis was, unconsciously, folding and unfolding\nMazarin's paper, upon which he had not cast his eyes. At length he\nglanced upon it, and uttered a faint cry at reading the first line.\n\n\"What is the matter, my son?\" asked the queen, anxiously, and going\ntowards the king.\n\n\"From the cardinal,\" replied the king, continuing to read; \"yes, yes, it\nis really from him.\"\n\n\"Is he worse, then?\"\n\n\"Read!\" said the king, passing the parchment to his mother, as if he\nthought that nothing less than reading would convince Anne of Austria of\na thing so astonishing as was conveyed in that paper.\n\nAnne of Austria read in turn, and as she read, her eyes sparkled\nwith joy all the greater from her useless endeavor to hide it, which\nattracted the attention of Fouquet.\n\n\"Oh! a regularly drawn up deed of gift,\" said she.\n\n\"A gift?\" repeated Fouquet.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the king, replying pointedly to the superintendent of\nfinances, \"yes, at the point of death, monsieur le cardinal makes me a\ndonation of all his wealth.\"\n\n\"Forty millions,\" cried the queen. \"Oh, my son! this is very noble on\nthe part of his eminence, and will silence all malicious rumors; forty\nmillions scraped together slowly, coming back all in one heap to the\ntreasury! It is the act of a faithful subject and a good Christian.\" And\nhaving once more cast her eyes over the act, she restored it to Louis\nXIV., whom the announcement of the sum greatly agitated. Fouquet had\ntaken some steps backwards and remained silent. The king looked at him,\nand held the paper out to him, in turn. The superintendent only bestowed\na haughty look of a second upon it; then bowing,--\"Yes, sire,\" said he,\n\"a donation, I see.\"\n\n\"You must reply to it, my son,\" said Anne of Austria; \"you must reply to\nit, and immediately.\"\n\n\"But how, madame?\"\n\n\"By a visit to the cardinal.\"\n\n\"Why, it is but an hour since I left his eminence,\" said the king.\n\n\"Write, then, sire.\"\n\n\"Write!\" said the young king, with evident repugnance.\n\n\"Well!\" replied Anne of Austria, \"it seems to me, my son, that a man who\nhas just made such a present, has a good right to expect to be thanked\nfor it with some degree of promptitude.\" Then turning towards Fouquet:\n\"Is not that likewise your opinion, monsieur?\"\n\n\"That the present is worth the trouble? Yes, madame,\" said Fouquet, with\na lofty air that did not escape the king.\n\n\"Accept, then, and thank him,\" insisted Anne of Austria.\n\n\"What says M. Fouquet?\" asked Louis XIV.\n\n\"Does your majesty wish to know my opinion?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Thank him, sire--\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the queen.\n\n\"But do not accept,\" continued Fouquet.\n\n\"And why not?\" asked the queen.\n\n\"You have yourself said why, madame,\" replied Fouquet; \"because kings\ncannot and ought not to receive presents from their subjects.\"\n\nThe king remained silent between these two contrary opinions.\n\n\"But forty millions!\" said Anne of Austria, in the same tone as that in\nwhich, at a later period, poor Marie Antoinette replied, \"You will tell\nme as much!\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Fouquet, laughing, \"forty millions makes a good round\nsum,--such a sum as could almost tempt a royal conscience.\"\n\n\"But, monsieur,\" said Anne of Austria, \"instead of persuading the king\nnot to receive this present, recall to his majesty's mind, you, whose\nduty it is, that these forty millions are a fortune to him.\"\n\n\"It is precisely, madame, because these forty millions would be a\nfortune that I will say to the king, 'Sire, if it be not decent for a\nking to accept from a subject six horses, worth twenty thousand livres,\nit would be disgraceful for him to owe a fortune to another subject,\nmore or less scrupulous in the choice of the materials which contributed\nto the building up of that fortune.'\"\n\n\"It ill becomes you, monsieur, to give your king a lesson,\" said Anne\nof Austria; \"better procure for him forty millions to replace those you\nmake him lose.\"\n\n\"The king shall have them whenever he wishes,\" said the superintendent\nof finances, bowing.\n\n\"Yes, by oppressing the people,\" said the queen.\n\n\"And were they not oppressed, madame,\" replied Fouquet, \"when they were\nmade to sweat the forty millions given by this deed? Furthermore, his\nmajesty has asked my opinion, I have given it; if his majesty ask my\nconcurrence, it will be the same.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! accept, my son, accept,\" said Anne of Austria. \"You are above\nreports and interpretations.\"\n\n\"Refuse, sire,\" said Fouquet. \"As long as a king lives, he has no other\nmeasure but his conscience,--no other judge than his own desires; but\nwhen dead, he has posterity, which applauds or accuses.\"\n\n\"Thank you, mother,\" replied Louis, bowing respectfully to the queen.\n\"Thank you Monsieur, Fouquet,\" said he, dismissing the superintendent\ncivilly.\n\n\"Do you accept?\" asked Anne of Austria, once more.\n\n\"I shall consider of it,\" replied he, looking at Fouquet.\n\n\n\nChapter XLVIII. Agony.\n\nThe day that the deed of gift had been sent to the king, the cardinal\ncaused himself to be transported to Vincennes. The king and the court\nfollowed him thither. The last flashes of this torch still cast splendor\nenough around to absorb all other lights in its rays. Besides, as it\nhas been seen, the faithful satellite of his minister, young Louis\nXIV., marched to the last minute in accordance with his gravitation. The\ndisease, as Guenaud had predicted, had become worse; it was no longer an\nattack of gout, it was an attack of death; then there was another thing\nwhich made that agony more agonizing still,--and that was the agitation\nbrought into his mind by the donation he had sent to the king, and\nwhich, according to Colbert, the king ought to send back unaccepted\nto the cardinal. The cardinal had, as we have said, great faith in the\npredictions of his secretary; but the sum was a large one, and whatever\nmight be the genius of Colbert, from time to time the cardinal thought\nto himself that the Theatin also might possibly have been mistaken, and\nthere was at least as much chance of his not being damned, as there was\nof Louis XIV. sending back his millions.\n\nBesides, the longer the donation was in coming back, the more Mazarin\nthought that forty millions were worth a little risk, particularly of\nso hypothetic a thing as the soul. Mazarin, in his character of cardinal\nand prime minister, was almost an atheist, and quite a materialist.\nEvery time that the door opened, he turned sharply round towards that\ndoor, expecting to see the return of his unfortunate donation; then,\ndeceived in his hope, he fell back again with a sigh, and found his\npains so much the greater for having forgotten them for an instant.\n\nAnne of Austria had also followed the cardinal; her heart, though age\nhad made it selfish, could not help evincing towards the dying man\na sorrow which she owed him as a wife, according to some; and as a\nsovereign, according to others. She had, in some sort, put on a mourning\ncountenance beforehand, and all the court wore it as she did.\n\nLouis, in order not to show on his face what was passing at the bottom\nof his heart, persisted in remaining in his own apartments, where his\nnurse alone kept him company; the more he saw the approach of the time\nwhen all constraint would be at an end, the more humble and patient\nhe was, falling back upon himself, as all strong men do when they form\ngreat designs, in order to gain more spring at the decisive moment.\nExtreme unction had been administered to the cardinal, who, faithful\nto his habits of dissimulation, struggled against appearances, and even\nagainst reality, receiving company in his bed, as if he only suffered\nfrom a temporary complaint.\n\nGuenaud, on his part, preserved profound secrecy; wearied with visits\nand questions, he answered nothing but \"his eminence is still full of\nyouth and strength, but God wills that which He wills, and when He has\ndecided that man is to be laid low, he will be laid low.\" These words,\nwhich he scattered with a sort of discretion, reserve, and preference,\nwere commented upon earnestly by two persons,--the king and the\ncardinal. Mazarin, notwithstanding the prophecy of Guenaud, still lured\nhimself with a hope, or rather played his part so well, that the most\ncunning, when saying that he lured himself, proved that they were his\ndupes.\n\nLouis, absent from the cardinal for two days; Louis, with his eyes fixed\nupon that same donation which so constantly preoccupied the cardinal;\nLouis did not exactly know how to make out Mazarin's conduct. The son\nof Louis XIII., following the paternal traditions, had, up to that time,\nbeen so little of a king that, whilst ardently desiring royalty, he\ndesired it with that terror which always accompanies the unknown. Thus,\nhaving formed his resolution, which, besides, he communicated to nobody,\nhe determined to have an interview with Mazarin. It was Anne of Austria,\nwho, constant in her attendance upon the cardinal, first heard this\nproposition of the king's, and transmitted it to the dying man, whom it\ngreatly agitated. For what purpose could Louis wish for an interview?\nWas it to return the deed, as Colbert had said he would? Was it to keep\nit, after thanking him, as Mazarin thought he would? Nevertheless, as\nthe dying man felt that the uncertainty increased his torments, he did\nnot hesitate an instant.\n\n\"His majesty will be welcome,--yes, very welcome,\" cried he, making a\nsign to Colbert, who was seated at the foot of the bed, and which the\nlatter understood perfectly. \"Madame,\" continued Mazarin, \"will your\nmajesty be good enough to assure the king yourself of the truth of what\nI have just said?\"\n\nAnne of Austria rose; she herself was anxious to have the question of\nthe forty millions settled--the question which seemed to lie heavy on\nthe mind of everyone. Anne of Austria went out; Mazarin made a great\neffort, and, raising himself up towards Colbert: \"Well, Colbert,\" said\nhe, \"two days have passed away--two mortal days--and, you see, nothing\nhas been returned from yonder.\"\n\n\"Patience, my lord,\" said Colbert.\n\n\"Are you mad, you wretch? You advise me to have patience! Oh, in sad\ntruth, Colbert, you are laughing at me. I am dying and you call out to\nme to wait!\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said Colbert, with his habitual coolness, \"it is impossible\nthat things should not come out as I have said. His majesty is coming to\nsee you, and no doubt he brings back the deed himself.\"\n\n\"Do you think so? Well, I, on the contrary, am sure that his majesty is\ncoming to thank me.\"\n\nAt this moment Anne of Austria returned. On her way to the apartments of\nher son she had met with a new empiric. This was a powder which was said\nto have power to save the cardinal; and she brought a portion of this\npowder with her. But this was not what Mazarin expected; therefore he\nwould not even look at it, declaring that life was not worth the\npains that were taken to preserve it. But, whilst professing this\nphilosophical axiom, his long-confined secret escaped him at last.\n\n\"That, madame,\" said he, \"that is not the interesting part of my\nsituation. I made, two days ago, a little donation to the king; up to\nthis time, from delicacy, no doubt, his majesty has not condescended\nto say anything about it; but the time for explanation is come, and I\nimplore your majesty to tell me if the king has made up his mind on that\nmatter.\"\n\nAnne of Austria was about to reply, when Mazarin stopped her.\n\n\"The truth, madame,\" said he--\"in the name of Heaven, the truth! Do not\nflatter a dying man with a hope that may prove vain.\" There he stopped,\na look from Colbert telling him he was on the wrong track.\n\n\"I know,\" said Anne of Austria, taking the cardinal's hand, \"I know that\nyou have generously made, not a little donation, as you modestly call\nit, but a magnificent gift. I know how painful it would be to you if the\nking--\"\n\nMazarin listened, dying as he was, as ten living men could not have\nlistened.\n\n\"If the king--\" replied he.\n\n\"If the king,\" continued Anne of Austria, \"should not freely accept what\nyou offer so nobly.\"\n\nMazarin allowed himself to sink back upon his pillow like Pantaloon;\nthat is to say, with all the despair of a man who bows before the\ntempest; but he still preserved sufficient strength and presence of\nmind to cast upon Colbert one of those looks which are well worth ten\nsonnets, which is to say, ten long poems.\n\n\"Should you not,\" added the queen, \"have considered the refusal of\nthe king as a sort of insult?\" Mazarin rolled his head about upon his\npillow, without articulating a syllable. The queen was deceived, or\nfeigned to be deceived, by this demonstration.\n\n\"Therefore,\" resumed she, \"I have circumvented him with good counsels;\nand as certain minds, jealous, no doubt, of the glory you are about to\nacquire by this generosity, have endeavored to prove to the king that he\nought not to accept this donation, I have struggled in your favor, and\nso well I have struggled, that you will not have, I hope, that distress\nto undergo.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" murmured Mazarin, with languishing eyes, \"ah! that is a service I\nshall never forget for a single minute of the few hours I still have to\nlive.\"\n\n\"I must admit,\" continued the queen, \"that it was not without trouble I\nrendered it to your eminence.\"\n\n\"Ah, _peste!_ I believe that. Oh! oh!\"\n\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\"\n\n\"I am burning!\"\n\n\"Do you suffer much?\"\n\n\"As much as one of the damned.\"\n\nColbert would have liked to sink through the floor.\n\n\"So, then,\" resumed Mazarin, \"your majesty thinks that the king--\" he\nstopped several seconds--\"that the king is coming here to offer me some\nsmall thanks?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" said queen. Mazarin annihilated Colbert with his last\nlook.\n\nAt that moment the ushers announced that the king was in the\nante-chambers, which were filled with people. This announcement produced\na stir of which Colbert took advantage to escape by the door of the\n_ruelle_. Anne of Austria arose, and awaited her son, standing. Louis\nXIV. appeared at the threshold of the door, with his eyes fixed upon the\ndying man, who did not even think it worth while to notice that majesty\nfrom whom he thought he had nothing more to expect. An usher placed\nan armchair close to the bed. Louis bowed to his mother, then to the\ncardinal, and sat down. The queen took a seat in her turn.\n\nThen, as the king looked behind him, the usher understood that look, and\nmade a sign to the courtiers who filled up the doorway to go out,\nwhich they instantly did. Silence fell upon the chamber with the velvet\ncurtains. The king, still very young, and very timid in the presence of\nhim who had been his master from his birth, still respected him much,\nparticularly now, in the supreme majesty of death. He did not dare,\ntherefore, to begin the conversation, feeling that every word must have\nits weight not only upon things of this world, but of the next. As to\nthe cardinal, at that moment he had but one thought--his donation. It\nwas not physical pain which gave him that air of despondency, and that\nlugubrious look; it was the expectation of the thanks that were about\nto issue from the king's mouth, and cut off all hope of restitution.\nMazarin was the first to break the silence. \"Is your majesty come to\nmake any stay at Vincennes?\" said he.\n\nLouis made an affirmative sign with his head.\n\n\"That is a gracious favor,\" continued Mazarin, \"granted to a dying man,\nand which will render death less painful to him.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" replied the king, \"I am come to visit, not a dying man, but a\nsick man, susceptible of cure.\"\n\nMazarin replied by a movement of the head.\n\n\"Your majesty is very kind; but I know more than you on that subject.\nThe last visit, sire,\" said he, \"the last visit.\"\n\n\"If it were so, monsieur le cardinal,\" said Louis, \"I would come a last\ntime to ask the counsels of a guide to whom I owe everything.\"\n\nAnne of Austria was a woman; she could not restrain her tears. Louis\nshowed himself much affected, and Mazarin still more than his two\nguests, but from very different motives. Here the silence returned. The\nqueen wiped her eyes, and the king resumed his firmness.\n\n\"I was saying,\" continued the king, \"that I owed much to your eminence.\"\nThe eyes of the cardinal had devoured the king, for he felt the great\nmoment had come. \"And,\" continued Louis, \"the principal object of my\nvisit was to offer you very sincere thanks for the last evidence of\nfriendship you have kindly sent me.\"\n\nThe cheeks of the cardinal became sunken, his lips partially opened, and\nthe most lamentable sigh he had ever uttered was about to issue from his\nchest.\n\n\"Sire,\" said he, \"I shall have despoiled my poor family; I shall have\nruined all who belong to me, which may be imputed to me as an error;\nbut, at least, it shall not be said of me that I have refused to\nsacrifice everything to my king.\"\n\nAnne of Austria's tears flowed afresh.\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Mazarin,\" said the king, in a more serious tone than\nmight have been expected from his youth, \"you have misunderstood me,\napparently.\"\n\nMazarin raised himself upon his elbow.\n\n\"I have no purpose to despoil your dear family, nor to ruin your\nservants. Oh, no, that must never be!\"\n\n\"Humph!\" thought Mazarin, \"he is going to restore me some scraps; let us\nget the largest piece we can.\"\n\n\"The king is going to be foolishly affected and play generous,\" thought\nthe queen; \"he must not be allowed to impoverish himself; such an\nopportunity for getting a fortune will never occur again.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said the cardinal, aloud, \"my family is very numerous, and my\nnieces will be destitute when I am gone.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" interrupted the queen, eagerly, \"have no uneasiness with respect\nto your family, dear Monsieur Mazarin; we have no friends dearer than\nyour friends; your nieces shall be my children, the sisters of his\nmajesty; and if a favor be distributed in France, it shall be to those\nyou love.\"\n\n\"Smoke!\" thought Mazarin, who knew better than any one the faith that\ncan be put in the promises of kings. Louis read the dying man's thought\nin his face.\n\n\"Be comforted, my dear Monsieur Mazarin,\" said he, with a half-smile,\nsad beneath its irony; \"the Mesdemoiselles de Mancini will lose, in\nlosing you, their most precious good; but they shall none the less be\nthe richest heiresses of France; and since you have been kind enough to\ngive me their dowry\"--the cardinal was panting--\"I restore it to\nthem,\" continued Louis, drawing from his breast and holding towards the\ncardinal's bed the parchment which contained the donation that, during\ntwo days, had kept alive such tempests in the mind of Mazarin.\n\n\"What did I tell you, my lord?\" murmured in the alcove a voice which\npassed away like a breath.\n\n\"Your majesty returns my donation!\" cried Mazarin, so disturbed by joy\nas to forget his character of a benefactor.\n\n\"Your majesty rejects the forty millions!\" cried Anne of Austria, so\nstupefied as to forget her character of an afflicted wife, or queen.\n\n\"Yes, my lord cardinal; yes, madame,\" replied Louis XIV., tearing\nthe parchment which Mazarin had not yet ventured to clutch; \"yes,\nI annihilate this deed, which despoiled a whole family. The wealth\nacquired by his eminence in my service is his own wealth and not mine.\"\n\n\"But, sire, does your majesty reflect,\" said Anne of Austria, \"that you\nhave not ten thousand crowns in your coffers?\"\n\n\"Madame, I have just performed my first royal action, and I hope it will\nworthily inaugurate my reign.\"\n\n\"Ah! sire, you are right!\" cried Mazarin; \"that is truly great--that is\ntruly generous which you have just done.\" And he looked, one after the\nother, at the pieces of the act spread over his bed, to assure himself\nthat it was the original and not a copy that had been torn. At\nlength his eyes fell upon the fragment which bore his signature, and\nrecognizing it, he sunk back on his bolster in a swoon. Anne of Austria,\nwithout strength to conceal her regret, raised her hands and eyes\ntowards heaven.\n\n\"Oh! sire,\" cried Mazarin, \"may you be blessed! My God! May you be\nbeloved by all my family. _Per Baccho!_ If ever any of those belonging\nto me should cause your displeasure, sire, only frown, and I will rise\nfrom my tomb!\"\n\nThis _pantalonnade_ did not produce all the effect Mazarin had counted\nupon. Louis had already passed to considerations of a higher nature, and\nas to Anne of Austria, unable to bear, without abandoning herself to the\nanger she felt burning within her, the magnanimity of her son and the\nhypocrisy of the cardinal, she arose and left the chamber, heedless\nof thus betraying the extent of her grief. Mazarin saw all this, and\nfearing that Louis XIV. might repent his decision, in order to draw\nattention another way he began to cry out, as, at a later period, Scapin\nwas to cry out, in that sublime piece of pleasantry with which the\nmorose and grumbling Boileau dared to reproach Moliere. His cries,\nhowever, by degrees, became fainter; and when Anne of Austria left the\napartment, they ceased altogether.\n\n\"Monsieur le cardinal,\" said the king, \"have you any recommendations to\nmake me?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Mazarin, \"you are already wisdom itself, prudence\npersonified; of your generosity I shall not venture to speak; that which\nyou have just done exceeds all that the most generous men of antiquity\nor of modern times have ever done.\"\n\nThe king received this praise coldly.\n\n\"So you confine yourself,\" said he, \"to your thanks--and your\nexperience, much more extensive than my wisdom, my prudence, or my\ngenerosity, does not furnish you with a single piece of friendly advice\nto guide my future.\" Mazarin reflected for a moment. \"You have just done\nmuch for me, sire,\" said he, \"that is, for my family.\"\n\n\"Say no more about that,\" said the king.\n\n\"Well!\" continued Mazarin, \"I shall give you something in exchange for\nthese forty millions you have refused so royally.\"\n\nLouis XIV. indicated by a movement that these flatteries were\ndispleasing to him. \"I shall give you a piece of advice,\" continued\nMazarin; \"yes, a piece of advice--advice more precious than the forty\nmillions.\"\n\n\"My lord cardinal!\" interrupted Louis.\n\n\"Sire, listen to this advice.\"\n\n\"I am listening.\"\n\n\"Come nearer, sire, for I am weak!--nearer, sire, nearer!\"\n\nThe king bent over the dying man. \"Sire,\" said Mazarin, in so low a tone\nthat the breath of his words arrived only like a recommendation from\nthe tomb in the attentive ears of the king--\"Sire, never have a prime\nminister.\"\n\nLouis drew back astonished. The advice was a confession--a treasure, in\nfact, was that sincere confession of Mazarin. The legacy of the cardinal\nto the young king was composed of six words only, but those six words,\nas Mazarin had said, were worth forty millions. Louis remained for\nan instant bewildered. As for Mazarin, he appeared only to have said\nsomething quite natural. A little scratching was heard along the\ncurtains of the alcove. Mazarin understood: \"Yes, yes!\" cried he,\nwarmly, \"yes, sire, I recommend to you a wise man, an honest man, and a\nclever man.\"\n\n\"Tell me his name, my lord.\"\n\n\"His name is yet almost unknown, sire; it is M. Colbert, my attendant.\nOh! try him,\" added Mazarin, in an earnest voice; \"all that he has\npredicted has come to pass; he has a safe glance, he is never mistaken\neither in things or in men--which is more surprising still. Sire, I owe\nyou much, but I think I acquit myself of all towards you in giving you\nM. Colbert.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Louis, faintly, for, as Mazarin had said, the name of\nColbert was quite unknown to him, and he thought the enthusiasm of the\ncardinal partook of the delirium of a dying man. The cardinal sank back\non his pillows.\n\n\"For the present, adieu, sire! adieu,\" murmured Mazarin. \"I am tired,\nand I have yet a rough journey to take before I present myself to my new\nMaster. Adieu, sire!\"\n\nThe young king felt the tears rise to his eyes; he bent over the dying\nman, already half a corpse, and then hastily retired.\n\n\n\nChapter XLIX. The First Appearance of Colbert.\n\nThe whole night was passed in anguish, common to the dying man and to\nthe king: the dying man expected his deliverance, the king awaited his\nliberty. Louis did not go to bed. An hour after leaving the chamber\nof the cardinal, he learned that the dying man, recovering a little\nstrength, had insisted upon being dressed, adorned and painted, and\nseeing the ambassadors. Like Augustus, he no doubt considered the world\na great stage, and was desirous of playing out the last act of the\ncomedy. Anne of Austria reappeared no more in the cardinal's apartments;\nshe had nothing more to do there. Propriety was the pretext for her\nabsence. On his part, the cardinal did not ask for her: the advice the\nqueen had giver her son rankled in his heart.\n\nTowards midnight, while still painted, Mazarin's mortal agony came on.\nHe had revised his will, and as this will was the exact expression of\nhis wishes, and as he feared that some interested influence might take\nadvantage of his weakness to make him change something in it, he had\ngiven orders to Colbert, who walked up and down the corridor which led\nto the cardinal's bed-chamber, like the most vigilant of sentinels. The\nking, shut up in his own apartment, dispatched his nurse every hour to\nMazarin's chamber, with orders to bring him back an exact bulletin\nof the cardinal's state. After having heard that Mazarin was dressed,\npainted, and had seen the ambassadors, Louis herd that the prayers\nfor the dying were being read for the cardinal. At one o'clock in the\nmorning, Guenaud had administered the last remedy. This was a relic of\nthe old customs of that fencing time, which was about to disappear to\ngive place to another time, to believe that death could be kept off\nby some good secret thrust. Mazarin, after having taken the remedy,\nrespired freely for nearly ten minutes. He immediately gave orders that\nthe news should be spread everywhere of a fortunate crisis. The king, on\nlearning this, felt as if a cold sweat were passing over his brow;--he\nhad had a glimpse of the light of liberty; slavery appeared to him more\ndark and less acceptable than ever. But the bulletin which followed\nentirely changed the face of things. Mazarin could no longer breathe\nat all, and could scarcely follow the prayers which the cure of\nSaint-Nicholas-des-Champs recited near him. The king resumed his\nagitated walk about his chamber, and consulted, as he walked, several\npapers drawn from a casket of which he alone had the key. A third time\nthe nurse returned. M. de Mazarin had just uttered a joke, and had\nordered his \"Flora,\" by Titian, to be revarnished. At length, towards\ntwo o'clock in the morning, the king could no longer resist his\nweariness: he had not slept for twenty-four hours. Sleep, so powerful\nat his age, overcame him for about an hour. But he did not go to bed for\nthat hour; he slept in a _fauteuil_. About four o'clock his nurse awoke\nhim by entering the room.\n\n\"Well?\" asked the king.\n\n\"Well, my dear sire,\" said the nurse, clasping her hands with an air of\ncommiseration. \"Well; he is dead!\"\n\nThe king arose at a bound, as if a steel spring had been applied to his\nlegs. \"Dead!\" cried he.\n\n\"Alas! yes.\"\n\n\"Is it quite certain?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Official?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Has the news been made public?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Who told you, then, that the cardinal was dead?\"\n\n\"M. Colbert.\"\n\n\"M. Colbert?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And he was sure of what he said?\"\n\n\"He came out of the chamber, and had held a glass for some minutes\nbefore the cardinal's lips.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the king. \"And what is become of M. Colbert?\"\n\n\"He has just left his eminence's chamber.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He followed me.\"\n\n\"So that he is--\"\n\n\"Sire, waiting at your door, till it shall be your good pleasure to\nreceive him.\"\n\nLouis ran to the door, opened it himself, and perceived Colbert standing\nwaiting in the passage. The king started at sight of this statue, all\nclothed in black. Colbert, bowing with profound respect, advanced two\nsteps towards his majesty. Louis re-entered his chamber, making Colbert\na sign to follow. Colbert entered; Louis dismissed the nurse, who closed\nthe door as she went out. Colbert remained modestly standing near that\ndoor.\n\n\"What do you come to announce to me, monsieur?\" said Louis, very much\ntroubled at being thus surprised in his private thoughts, which he could\nnot completely conceal.\n\n\"That monsieur le cardinal has just expired, sire; and that I bring your\nmajesty his last adieu.\"\n\nThe king remained pensive for a minute; and during that minute he looked\nattentively at Colbert;--it was evident that the cardinal's last words\nwere in his mind. \"Are you, then, M. Colbert?\" asked he.\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"His faithful servant, as his eminence himself told me?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"The depositary of many of his secrets?\"\n\n\"Of all of them.\"\n\n\"The friends and servants of his eminence will be dear to me, monsieur,\nand I shall take care that you are well placed in my employment.\"\n\nColbert bowed.\n\n\"You are a financier, monsieur, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And did monsieur le cardinal employ you in his stewardship?\"\n\n\"I had that honor, sire.\"\n\n\"You never did anything personally for my household, I believe?\"\n\n\"Pardon me, sire, it was I who had the honor of giving monsieur le\ncardinal the idea of an economy which puts three hundred thousand francs\na year into your majesty's coffers.\"\n\n\"What economy was that, monsieur?\" asked Louis XIV.\n\n\"Your majesty knows that the hundred Swiss have silver lace on each side\nof their ribbons?\"\n\n\"Doubtless.\"\n\n\"Well, sire, it was I who proposed that imitation silver lace should\nbe placed upon these ribbons; it could not be detected, and a hundred\nthousand crowns serve to feed a regiment during six months; and is the\nprice of ten thousand good muskets or the value of a vessel of ten guns,\nready for sea.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Louis XIV., considering more attentively, \"and,\n_ma foi!_ that was a well placed economy; besides, it was ridiculous for\nsoldiers to wear the same lace as noblemen.\"\n\n\"I am happy to be approved of by your majesty.\"\n\n\"Is that the only appointment you held about the cardinal?\" asked the\nking.\n\n\"It was I who was appointed to examine the accounts of the\nsuperintendent, sire.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Louis, who was about to dismiss Colbert, but whom that word\nstopped; \"ah! it was you whom his eminence had charged to control M.\nFouquet, was it? And the result of that examination?\"\n\n\"Is that there is a deficit, sire; but if your majesty will permit me--\"\n\n\"Speak, M. Colbert.\"\n\n\"I ought to give your majesty some explanations.\"\n\n\"Not at all, monsieur, it is you who have controlled these accounts;\ngive me the result.\"\n\n\"That is very easily done, sire: emptiness everywhere, money nowhere.\"\n\n\"Beware, monsieur; you are roughly attacking the administration of M.\nFouquet, who, nevertheless, I have heard say, is an able man.\"\n\nColbert colored, and then became pale, for he felt that from that minute\nhe entered upon a struggle with a man whose power almost equaled the\nsway of him who had just died. \"Yes, sire, a very able man,\" repeated\nColbert, bowing.\n\n\"But if M. Fouquet is an able man, and, in spite of that ability, if\nmoney be wanting, whose fault is it?\"\n\n\"I do not accuse, sire, I verify.\"\n\n\"That is well; make out your accounts, and present them to me. There is\na deficit, you say? A deficit may be temporary; credit returns and funds\nare restored.\"\n\n\"No, sire.\"\n\n\"Upon this year, perhaps, I understand that; but upon next year?\"\n\n\"Next year is eaten as bare as the current year.\"\n\n\"But the year after, then?\"\n\n\"Will be just like next year.\"\n\n\"What do you tell me, Monsieur Colbert?\"\n\n\"I say there are four years engaged beforehand.\"\n\n\"They must have a loan, then.\"\n\n\"They must have three, sire.\"\n\n\"I will create offices to make them resign, and the salary of the posts\nshall be paid into the treasury.\"\n\n\"Impossible, sire, for there have already been creations upon creations\nof offices, the provisions of which are given in blank, so that the\npurchasers enjoy them without filling them. That is why your majesty\ncannot make them resign. Further, upon each agreement M. Fouquet has\nmade an abatement of a third, so that the people have been plundered,\nwithout your majesty profiting by it.\"\n\nThe king started. \"Explain me that, M. Colbert,\" he said.\n\n\"Let your majesty set down clearly your thought, and tell me what you\nwish me to explain.\"\n\n\"You are right, clearness is what you wish, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, clearness. God is God above all things, because He made\nlight.\"\n\n\"Well, for example,\" resumed Louis XIV., \"if to-day, the cardinal being\ndead, and I being king, suppose I wanted money?\"\n\n\"Your majesty would not have any.\"\n\n\"Oh! that is strange, monsieur! How! my superintendent would not find me\nany money?\"\n\nColbert shook his large head.\n\n\"How is that?\" said the king; \"is the income of the state so much in\ndebt that there is no longer any revenue?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\nThe king frowned and said, \"If it be so, I will get together the\n_ordonnances_ to obtain a discharge from the holders, a liquidation at a\ncheap rate.\"\n\n\"Impossible, for the _ordonnances_ have been converted into bills, which\nbills, for the convenience of return and facility of transaction,\nare divided into so many parts that the originals can no longer be\nrecognized.\"\n\nLouis, very much agitated, walked about, still frowning. \"But, if this\nis as you say, Monsieur Colbert,\" said he, stopping all at once, \"I\nshall be ruined before I begin to reign.\"\n\n\"You are, in fact, sire,\" said the impassible caster-up of figures.\n\n\"Well, but yet, monsieur, the money is somewhere?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, and even as a beginning, I bring your majesty a note of\nfunds which M. le Cardinal Mazarin was not willing to set down in his\ntestament, neither in any act whatever, but which he confided to me.\"\n\n\"To you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, with an injunction to remit it to your majesty.\"\n\n\"What! besides the forty millions of the testament?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"M. de Mazarin had still other funds?\"\n\nColbert bowed.\n\n\"Why, that man was a gulf!\" murmured the king. \"M. de Mazarin on one\nside, M. Fouquet on the other,--more than a hundred millions perhaps\nbetween them! No wonder my coffers should be empty!\" Colbert waited\nwithout stirring.\n\n\"And is the sum you bring me worth the trouble?\" asked the king.\n\n\"Yes, sire, it is a round sum.\"\n\n\"Amounting to how much?\"\n\n\"To thirteen millions of livres, sire.\"\n\n\"Thirteen millions!\" cried Louis, trembling with joy; \"do you say\nthirteen millions, Monsieur Colbert?\"\n\n\"I said thirteen millions, yes, your majesty.\"\n\n\"Of which everybody is ignorant?\"\n\n\"Of which everybody is ignorant.\"\n\n\"Which are in your hands?\"\n\n\"In my hands, yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And which I can have?\"\n\n\"Within two hours, sire.\"\n\n\"But where are they, then?\"\n\n\"In the cellar of a house which the cardinal possessed in the city, and\nwhich he was so kind as to leave me by a particular clause of his will.\"\n\n\"You are acquainted with the cardinal's will, then?\"\n\n\"I have a duplicate of it, signed by his hand.\"\n\n\"A duplicate?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, and here it is.\" Colbert drew the deed quietly from his\npocket, and showed it to the king. The king read the article relative to\nthe donation of the house.\n\n\"But,\" said he, \"there is no question here but of the house; there is\nnothing said of the money.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, sire, it is in my conscience.\"\n\n\"And Monsieur Mazarin has intrusted it to you?\"\n\n\"Why not, sire?\"\n\n\"He! a man mistrustful of everybody?\"\n\n\"He was not so of me, sire, as your majesty may perceive.\"\n\nLouis fixed his eyes with admiration upon that vulgar but expressive\nface. \"You are an honest man, M. Colbert,\" said the king.\n\n\"That is not a virtue, it is a duty,\" replied Colbert, coolly.\n\n\"But,\" added Louis, \"does not the money belong to the family?\"\n\n\"If this money belonged to the family it would be disposed of in the\ntestament, as the rest of the fortune is. If this money belonged to the\nfamily, I, who drew up the deed of donation in favor of your majesty,\nshould have added the sum of thirteen millions to that of forty millions\nwhich was offered to you.\"\n\n\"How!\" exclaimed Louis XIV., \"was it you who drew up the deed of\ndonation?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And yet the cardinal was attached to you?\" added the king, ingenuously.\n\n\"I had assured his eminence you would by no means accept the gift,\" said\nColbert, in that same quiet manner we have described, and which, even in\nthe common habits of life, had something solemn in it.\n\nLouis passed his hand over his brow: \"Oh! how young I am,\" murmured he,\n\"to have command of men.\"\n\nColbert waited the end of this monologue. He saw Louis raise his head.\n\"At what hour shall I send the money to your majesty?\" asked he.\n\n\"To-night, at eleven o'clock; I desire that no one may know that I\npossess this money.\"\n\nColbert made no more reply than if the thing had not been said to him.\n\n\"Is the amount in ingots, or coined gold?\"\n\n\"In coined gold, sire.\"\n\n\"That is well.\"\n\n\"Where shall I send it?\"\n\n\"To the Louvre. Thank you, M. Colbert.\"\n\nColbert bowed and retired. \"Thirteen millions!\" exclaimed Louis, as soon\nas he was alone. \"This must be a dream!\" Then he allowed his head to\nsink between his hands, as if he were really asleep. But, at the end\nof a moment, he arose, and opening the window violently, he bathed his\nburning brow in the keen morning air, which brought to his senses the\nscent of the trees, and the perfume of the flowers. A splendid dawn was\ngilding the horizon, and the first rays of the sun bathed in flame the\nyoung king's brow. \"This is the dawn of my reign,\" murmured Louis XIV.\n\"It's a presage sent by the Almighty.\"\n\n\n\nChapter L: The First Day of the Royalty of Louis XIV.\n\nIn the morning, the news of the death of the cardinal was spread through\nthe castle, and thence speedily reached the city. The ministers Fouquet,\nLyonne, and Letellier entered _la salle des seances_, to hold a council.\nThe king sent for them immediately. \"Messieurs,\" said he, \"as long as\nmonsieur le cardinal lived, I allowed him to govern my affairs; but now\nI mean to govern them myself. You will give me your advice when I ask\nit. You may go.\"\n\nThe ministers looked at each other with surprise. If they concealed a\nsmile it was with a great effort, for they knew that the prince, brought\nup in absolute ignorance of business, by this took upon himself a burden\nmuch too heavy for his strength. Fouquet took leave of his colleagues\nupon the stairs, saying:--\"Messieurs! there will be so much the less\nlabor for us.\"\n\nAnd he gayly climbed into his carriage. The others, a little uneasy\nat the turn things had taken, went back to Paris together. Towards ten\no'clock the king repaired to the apartment of his mother, with whom\nhe had a long and private conversation. After dinner, he got into\nhis carriage, and went straight to the Louvre. There he received much\ncompany, and took a degree of pleasure in remarking the hesitation of\neach, and the curiosity of all. Towards evening he ordered the doors of\nthe Louvre to be closed, with the exception of only one, which opened on\nthe quay. He placed on duty at this point two hundred Swiss, who did not\nspeak a word of French, with orders to admit all who carried packages,\nbut no others; and by no means to allow any one to go out. At eleven\no'clock precisely, he heard the rolling of a heavy carriage under the\narch, then of another, then of a third; after which the gate grated upon\nits hinges to be closed. Soon after, somebody scratched with his nail at\nthe door of the cabinet. The king opened it himself, and beheld Colbert,\nwhose first word was this:--\"The money is in your majesty's cellar.\"\n\nThe king then descended and went himself to see the barrels of specie,\nin gold and silver, which, under the direction of Colbert, four men had\njust rolled into a cellar of which the king had given Colbert the key\nin the morning. This review completed, Louis returned to his apartments,\nfollowed by Colbert, who had not apparently warmed with one ray of\npersonal satisfaction.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the king, \"what do you wish that I should give you, as\na recompense for this devotedness and probity?\"\n\n\"Absolutely nothing, sire.\"\n\n\"How! nothing? Not even an opportunity of serving me?\"\n\n\"If your majesty were not to furnish me with that opportunity, I should\nnot the less serve you. It is impossible for me not to be the best\nservant of the king.\"\n\n\"You shall be intendant of the finances, M. Colbert.\"\n\n\"But there is already a superintendent, sire.\"\n\n\"I know that.\"\n\n\"Sire, the superintendent of the finances is the most powerful man in\nthe kingdom.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Louis, coloring, \"do you think so?\"\n\n\"He will crush me in a week, sire. Your majesty gives me a\n_controle_ for which strength is indispensable. An intendant under a\nsuperintendent,--that is inferiority.\"\n\n\"You want support--you do not reckon upon me?\"\n\n\"I had the honor of telling your majesty, that during the lifetime of\nM. de Mazarin, M. Fouquet was the second man in the kingdom; now M. de\nMazarin is dead, M. Fouquet is become the first.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I agree to what you told me of all things up to to-day; but\nto-morrow, please to remember, I shall no longer suffer it.\"\n\n\"Then I shall be of no use to your majesty?\"\n\n\"You are already, since you fear to compromise yourself in serving me.\"\n\n\"I only fear to be placed so that I cannot serve your majesty.\"\n\n\"What do you wish, then?\"\n\n\"I wish your majesty to allow me assistance in the labors of the office\nof intendant.\"\n\n\"That post would lose its value.\"\n\n\"It would gain in security.\"\n\n\"Choose your colleagues.\"\n\n\"Messieurs Breteuil, Marin, Hervart.\"\n\n\"To-morrow the _ordonnance_ shall appear.\"\n\n\"Sire, I thank you.\"\n\n\"Is that all you ask?\"\n\n\"No, sire, one thing more.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Allow me to compose a chamber of justice.\"\n\n\"What would this chamber of justice do?\"\n\n\"Try the farmers-general and contractors, who, during ten years, have\nbeen robbing the state.\"\n\n\"Well, but what would you do with them?\"\n\n\"Hang two or three, and that would make the rest disgorge.\"\n\n\"I cannot commence my reign with executions, Monsieur Colbert.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, sire, you had better, in order not to have to end with\nthem.\"\n\nThe king made no reply. \"Does your majesty consent?\" said Colbert.\n\n\"I will reflect upon it, monsieur.\"\n\n\"It will be too late when reflection may be made.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you have to deal with people stronger than ourselves, if they\nare warned.\"\n\n\"Compose that chamber of justice, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I will, sire.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"No, sire; there is still another important affair. What rights does\nyour majesty attach to this office of intendant?\"\n\n\"Well--I do not know--the customary ones.\"\n\n\"Sire, I desire that this office be invested with the right of reading\nthe correspondence with England.\"\n\n\"Impossible, monsieur, for that correspondence is kept from the council;\nmonsieur le cardinal himself carried it on.\"\n\n\"I thought your majesty had this morning declared that there should no\nlonger be a council?\"\n\n\"Yes, I said so.\"\n\n\"Let your majesty then have the goodness to read all the letters\nyourself, particularly those from England; I hold strongly to this\narticle.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, you shall have that correspondence, and render me an account\nof it.\"\n\n\"Now, sire, what shall I do with respect to the finances?\"\n\n\"Everything M. Fouquet has _not_ done.\"\n\n\"That is all I ask of your majesty. Thanks, sire, I depart in peace;\"\nand at these words he took his leave. Louis watched his departure.\nColbert was not yet a hundred paces from the Louvre when the king\nreceived a courier from England. After having looked at and examined the\nenvelope, the king broke the seal precipitately, and found a letter from\nCharles II. The following is what the English prince wrote to his royal\nbrother:--\n\n\"Your majesty must be rendered very uneasy by the illness of M. le\nCardinal Mazarin; but the excess of danger can only prove of service to\nyou. The cardinal is given over by his physician. I thank you for the\ngracious reply you have made to my communication touching the Princess\nHenrietta, my sister, and, in a week, the princess and her court will\nset out for Paris. It is gratifying to me to acknowledge the fraternal\nfriendship you have evinced towards me, and to call you, more justly\nthan ever, my brother. It is gratifying to me, above everything, to\nprove to your majesty how much I am interested in all that may please\nyou. You are wrong in having Belle-Ile-en-Mer secretly fortified. That\nis wrong. We shall never be at war against each other. That measure does\nnot make me uneasy, it makes me sad. You are spending useless millions;\ntell your ministers so; and rest assured that I am well informed; render\nme the same service, my brother, if occasion offers.\"\n\nThe king rang his bell violently, and his _valet de chambre_ appeared.\n\"Monsieur Colbert is just gone; he cannot be far off. Let him be called\nback!\" exclaimed he.\n\nThe valet was about to execute the order, when the king stopped him.\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"no; I see the whole scheme of that man. Belle-Isle\nbelongs to M. Fouquet; Belle-Isle is being fortified: that is a\nconspiracy on the part of M. Fouquet. The discovery of that conspiracy\nis the ruin of the superintendent, and that discovery is the result of\nthe correspondence with England: this is why Colbert wished to have that\ncorrespondence. Oh! but I cannot place all my dependence upon that man;\nhe has a good head, but I must have an arm!\" Louis, all at once, uttered\na joyful cry. \"I had,\" said he, \"a lieutenant of musketeers!\"\n\n\"Yes, sire--Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"He quitted the service for a time.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Let him be found, and be here to-morrow the first thing in the\nmorning.\"\n\nThe _valet de chambre_ bowed and went out.\n\n\"Thirteen millions in my cellar,\" said the king; \"Colbert carrying my\npurse and D'Artagnan my sword--_I am king_.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LI. A Passion.\n\nThe day of his arrival, on returning from the Palais Royal, Athos, as we\nhave seen, went straight to his hotel in the Rue Saint-Honore. He there\nfound the Vicomte de Bragelonne waiting for him in his chamber, chatting\nwith Grimaud. It was not an easy thing to talk with this old servant.\nTwo men only possessed the secret, Athos and D'Artagnan. The first\nsucceeded, because Grimaud sought to make him speak himself; D'Artagnan,\non the contrary, because he knew how to make Grimaud talk. Raoul was\noccupied in making him describe the voyage to England, and Grimaud had\nrelated it in all its details, with a limited number of gestures and\neight words, neither more nor less. He had, at first, indicated by an\nundulating movement of his hand, that his master and he had crossed the\nsea. \"Upon some expedition?\" Raoul had asked.\n\nGrimaud by bending down his head had answered, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"When monsieur le comte incurred much danger?\" asked Raoul.\n\n\"Neither too much nor too little,\" was replied by a shrug of the\nshoulders.\n\n\"But still, what sort of danger?\" insisted Raoul.\n\nGrimaud pointed to the sword; he pointed to the fire and to a musket\nthat was hanging on the wall.\n\n\"Monsieur le comte had an enemy there, then?\" cried Raoul.\n\n\"Monk,\" replied Grimaud.\n\n\"It is strange,\" continued Raoul, \"that monsieur le comte persists in\nconsidering me a novice, and not allowing me to partake the honor and\ndanger of his adventure.\"\n\nGrimaud smiled. It was at this moment Athos came in. The host was\nlighting him up the stairs, and Grimaud, recognizing the step of his\nmaster, hastened to meet him, which cut short the conversation. But\nRaoul was launched on the sea of interrogatories, and did not\nstop. Taking both hands of the comte, with warm, but respectful\ntenderness,--\"How is it, monsieur,\" said he, \"that you have set out upon\na dangerous voyage without bidding me adieu, without commanding the aid\nof my sword, of myself, who ought to be your support, now I have the\nstrength; whom you have brought up like a man? Ah! monsieur, can you\nexpose me to the cruel trial of never seeing you again?\"\n\n\"Who told you, Raoul,\" said the comte, placing his cloak and hat in the\nhands of Grimaud, who had unbuckled his sword, \"who told you that my\nvoyage was a dangerous one?\"\n\n\"I,\" said Grimaud.\n\n\"And why did you do so?\" said Athos, sternly.\n\nGrimaud was embarrassed; Raoul came to his assistance, by answering for\nhim. \"It is natural, monsieur, that our good Grimaud should tell me the\ntruth in what concerns you. By whom should you be loved an supported, if\nnot by me?\"\n\nAthos did not reply. He made a friendly motion to Grimaud, which sent\nhim out of the room; he then seated himself in a _fauteuil_, whilst\nRaoul remained standing before him.\n\n\"But it is true,\" continued Raoul, \"that your voyage was an expedition,\nand that steel and fire threatened you?\"\n\n\"Say no more about that, vicomte,\" said Athos, mildly. \"I set out\nhastily, it is true: but the service of King Charles II. required a\nprompt departure. As to your anxiety, I thank you for it, and I know\nthat I can depend on you. You have not wanted for anything, vicomte, in\nmy absence, have you?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, thank you.\"\n\n\"I left orders with Blaisois to pay you a hundred pistoles, if you\nshould stand in need of money.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I have not seen Blaisois.\"\n\n\"You have been without money, then?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I had thirty pistoles left from the sale of the horses I took\nin my last campaign, and M. le Prince had the kindness to allow me to\nwin two hundred pistoles at his play-table three months ago.\"\n\n\"Do you play? I don't like that, Raoul.\"\n\n\"I never play, monsieur; it was M. le Prince who ordered me to hold his\ncards at Chantilly--one night when a courier came to him from the king.\nI won, and M. le Prince commanded me to take the stakes.\"\n\n\"Is that a practice in the household, Raoul?\" asked Athos with a frown.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; every week M. le Prince affords, upon one occasion or\nanother, a similar advantage to one of his gentlemen. There are fifty\ngentlemen in his highness's household; it was my turn.\"\n\n\"Very well! You went into Spain, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, I made a very delightful and interesting journey.\"\n\n\"You have been back a month, have you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"And in the course of that month?\"\n\n\"In that month--\"\n\n\"What have you done?\"\n\n\"My duty, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Have you not been home, to La Fere?\"\n\nRaoul colored. Athos looked at him with a fixed but tranquil expression.\n\n\"You would be wrong not to believe me,\" said Raoul. \"I feel that I\ncolored, and in spite of myself. The question you did me the honor\nto ask me is of a nature to raise in me much emotion. I color, then,\nbecause I am agitated, not because I meditate a falsehood.\"\n\n\"I know, Raoul, you never lie.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Besides, my young friend, you would be wrong; what I wanted to say--\"\n\n\"I know quite well, monsieur. You would ask me if I have not been to\nBlois?\"\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\n\"I have not been there; I have not even seen the person to whom you\nallude.\"\n\nRaoul's voice trembled as he pronounced these words. Athos, a sovereign\njudge in all matters of delicacy, immediately added, \"Raoul, you answer\nme with a painful feeling; you are unhappy.\"\n\n\"Very, monsieur; you have forbidden me to go to Blois, or to see\nMademoiselle de la Valliere again.\" Here the young man stopped. That\ndear name, so delightful to pronounce, made his heart bleed, although so\nsweet upon his lips.\n\n\"And I have acted rightly, Raoul.\" Athos hastened to reply. \"I am\nneither an unjust nor a barbarous father; I respect true love; but I\nlook forward for you to a future--an immense future. A new reign is\nabout to break upon us like a fresh dawn. War calls upon a young king\nfull of chivalric spirit. What is wanting to assist this heroic ardor\nis a battalion of young and free lieutenants who would rush to the fight\nwith enthusiasm, and fall, crying: '_Vive le Roi!_' instead of 'Adieu,\nmy dear wife.' You understand that, Raoul. However brutal my reasoning\nmay appear, I conjure you, then, to believe me, and to turn away your\nthoughts from those early days of youth in which you took up this habit\nof love--days of effeminate carelessness, which soften the heart and\nrender it incapable of consuming those strong bitter draughts called\nglory and adversity. Therefore, Raoul, I repeat to you, you should see\nin my counsel only the desire of being useful to you, only the ambition\nof seeing you prosper. I believe you capable of becoming a remarkable\nman. March alone, and you will march better, and more quickly.\"\n\n\"You have commanded, monsieur,\" replied Raoul, \"and I obey.\"\n\n\"Commanded!\" cried Athos. \"Is it thus you reply to me? I have commanded\nyou! Oh! you distort my words as you misconceive my intentions. I do not\ncommand you; I request you.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, you have commanded,\" said Raoul, persistently; \"had you\nrequested me, your request is even more effective than your order. I\nhave not seen Mademoiselle de la Valliere again.\"\n\n\"But you are unhappy! you are unhappy!\" insisted Athos.\n\nRaoul made no reply.\n\n\"I find you pale; I find you dull. The sentiment is strong, then?\"\n\n\"It is a passion,\" replied Raoul.\n\n\"No--a habit.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, you know I have traveled much, that I have passed two years\nfar away from her. A habit would yield to an absence of two years, I\nbelieve; whereas, on my return, I loved not more, that was impossible,\nbut as much. Mademoiselle de la Valliere is for me the one lady above\nall others; but you are for me a god upon earth--to you I sacrifice\neverything.\"\n\n\"You are wrong,\" said Athos; \"I have no longer any right over you. Age\nhas emancipated you; you no longer even stand in need of my consent.\nBesides, I will not refuse my consent after what you have told me. Marry\nMademoiselle de la Valliere, if you like.\"\n\nRaoul was startled, but suddenly: \"You are very kind, monsieur,\" said\nhe; \"and your concession excites my warmest gratitude, but I will not\naccept it.\"\n\n\"Then you now refuse?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I will not oppose you in anything, Raoul.\"\n\n\"But you have at the bottom of your heart an idea against this marriage:\nit is not your choice.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"That is sufficient to make me resist: I will wait.\"\n\n\"Beware, Raoul! What you are now saying is serious.\"\n\n\"I know it is, monsieur; as I said, I will wait.\"\n\n\"Until I die?\" said Athos, much agitated.\n\n\"Oh! monsieur,\" cried Raoul, with tears in his eyes, \"is it possible\nthat you should wound my heart thus? I have never given you cause of\ncomplaint!\"\n\n\"Dear boy, that is true,\" murmured Athos, pressing his lips violently\ntogether to conceal the emotion of which he was no longer master. \"No,\nI will no longer afflict you; only I do not comprehend what you mean by\nwaiting. Will you wait till you love no longer?\"\n\n\"Ah! for that!--no, monsieur. I will wait till you change your opinion.\"\n\n\"I should wish to put the matter to a test, Raoul; I should like to see\nif Mademoiselle de la Valliere will wait as you do.\"\n\n\"I hope so, monsieur.\"\n\n\"But, take care, Raoul! suppose she did not wait? Ah, you are young, so\nconfiding, so loyal! Women are changeable.\"\n\n\"You have never spoken ill to me of women, monsieur; you have never\nhad to complain of them; why should you doubt of Mademoiselle de la\nValliere?\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Athos, casting down his eyes; \"I have never spoken\nill to you of women; I have never had to complain of them; Mademoiselle\nde la Valliere never gave birth to a suspicion; but when we are looking\nforward, we must go even to exceptions, even to improbabilities! _If_, I\nsay, Mademoiselle de la Valliere should not wait for you?\"\n\n\"How, monsieur?\"\n\n\"If she turned her eyes another way.\"\n\n\"If she looked favorably upon another, do you mean, monsieur?\" said\nRaoul, pale with agony.\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, I would kill him,\" said Raoul, simply, \"and all the men\nwhom Mademoiselle de la Valliere should choose, until one of them had\nkilled me, or Mademoiselle de la Valliere had restored me her heart.\"\n\nAthos started. \"I thought,\" resumed he, in an agitated voice, \"that you\ncalled my just now your god, your law in this world.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Raoul, trembling, \"you would forbid me the duel?\"\n\n\"Suppose I _did_ forbid it, Raoul?\"\n\n\"You would not forbid me to hope, monsieur; consequently you would not\nforbid me to die.\"\n\nAthos raised his eyes toward the vicomte. He had pronounced these\nwords with the most melancholy look. \"Enough,\" said Athos, after a long\nsilence, \"enough of this subject, upon which we both go too far. Live as\nwell as you are able, Raoul, perform your duties, love Mademoiselle de\nla Valliere; in a word, act like a man, since you have attained the\nage of a man; only do not forget that I love you tenderly, and that you\nprofess to love me.\"\n\n\"Ah! monsieur le comte!\" cried Raoul, pressing the hand of Athos to his\nheart.\n\n\"Enough, dear boy, leave me; I want rest. _A propos_, M. d'Artagnan has\nreturned from England with me; you owe him a visit.\"\n\n\"I will pay it, monsieur, with great pleasure. I love Monsieur\nd'Artagnan exceedingly.\"\n\n\"You are right in doing so; he is a worthy man and a brave cavalier.\"\n\n\"Who loves you dearly.\"\n\n\"I am sure of that. Do you know his address?\"\n\n\"At the Louvre, I suppose, or wherever the king is. Does he not command\nthe musketeers?\"\n\n\"No; at present M. d'Artagnan is absent on leave; he is resting for\nawhile. Do not, therefore, seek him at the posts of his service. You\nwill hear of him at the house of a certain Planchet.\"\n\n\"His former lackey?\"\n\n\"Exactly; turned grocer.\"\n\n\"I know; Rue des Lombards?\"\n\n\"Somewhere thereabouts, or Rue des Arcis.\"\n\n\"I will find it, monsieur--I will find it.\"\n\n\"You will say a thousand kind things to him, on my part, and ask him to\ncome and dine with me before I set out for La Fere.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Good-might, Raoul!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I see you wear an order I never saw you wear before; accept\nmy compliments.\"\n\n\"The Fleece!--that is true. A bauble, my boy, which no longer amuses an\nold child like myself. Good-night, Raoul!\"\n\n\n\nChapter LII. D'Artagnan's Lesson.\n\nRaoul did not meet with D'Artagnan the next day, as he had hoped. He\nonly met with Planchet, whose joy was great at seeing the young man\nagain, and who contrived to pay him two or three little soldierly\ncompliments, savoring very little of the grocer's shop. But as Raoul\nwas returning the next day from Vincennes at the head of fifty dragoons\nconfided to him by Monsieur le Prince, he perceived, in La Place\nBaudoyer, a man with his nose in the air, examining a house as we\nexamine a horse we have a fancy to buy. This man, dressed in a citizen\ncostume buttoned up like a military _pourpoint_, a very small hat on his\nhead, but a long shagreen-mounted sword by his side, turned his head as\nsoon as he heard the steps of the horses, and left off looking at the\nhouse to look at the dragoons. It was simply M. d'Artagnan; D'Artagnan\non foot; D'Artagnan with his hands behind him, passing a little review\nupon the dragoons, after having reviewed the buildings. Not a man, not\na tag, not a horse's hoof escaped his inspection. Raoul rode at the side\nof his troop; D'Artagnan perceived him the last. \"Eh!\" said he, \"Eh!\n_Mordioux!_\"\n\n\"I was not mistaken!\" cried Raoul, turning his horse towards him.\n\n\"Mistaken--no! Good-day to you,\" replied the ex-musketeer; whilst Raoul\neagerly pressed the hand of his old friend. \"Take care, Raoul,\" said\nD'Artagnan, \"the second horse of the fifth rank will lose a shoe\nbefore he gets to the Pont Marie; he has only two nails left in his off\nfore-foot.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, I will come back,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Can you quit your detachment?\"\n\n\"The cornet is there to take my place.\"\n\n\"Then you will come and dine with me?\"\n\n\"Most willingly, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Be quick, then; leave your horse, or make them give me one.\"\n\n\"I prefer coming back on foot with you.\"\n\nRaoul hastened to give notice to the cornet, who took his post; he\nthen dismounted, gave his horse to one of the dragoons, and with great\ndelight seized the arm of M. d'Artagnan, who had watched him during all\nthese little evolutions with the satisfaction of a connoisseur.\n\n\"What, do you come from Vincennes?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur le chevalier.\"\n\n\"And the cardinal?\"\n\n\"Is very ill; it is even reported he is dead.\"\n\n\"Are you on good terms with M. Fouquet?\" asked D'Artagnan, with a\ndisdainful movement of the shoulders, proving that the death of Mazarin\ndid not affect him beyond measure.\n\n\"With M. Fouquet?\" said Raoul; \"I do not know him.\"\n\n\"So much the worse! so much the worse! for a new king always seeks to\nget good men in his employment.\"\n\n\"Oh! the king means no harm,\" replied the young man.\n\n\"I say nothing about the crown,\" cried D'Artagnan; \"I am speaking of the\nking--the king, that is M. Fouquet, if the cardinal is dead. You must\ncontrive to stand well with M. Fouquet, if you do not wish to molder\naway all your life as I have moldered. It is true you have, fortunately,\nother protectors.\"\n\n\"M. le Prince, for instance.\"\n\n\"Worn out! worn out!\"\n\n\"M. le Comte de la Fere?\"\n\n\"Athos! Oh! that's different; yes, Athos--and if you have any wish to\nmake your way in England, you cannot apply to a better person; I can\neven say, without too much vanity, that I myself have some credit at the\ncourt of Charles II. There is a king--God speed him!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Raoul, with the natural curiosity of well-born young people,\nwhile listening to experience and courage.\n\n\"Yes, a king who amuses himself, it is true, but who has had a sword\nin his hand, and can appreciate useful men. Athos is on good terms\nwith Charles II. Take service there, and leave these scoundrels of\ncontractors and farmers-general, who steal as well with French hands as\nothers have done with Italian hands; leave the little snivelling\nking, who is going to give us another reign of Francis II. Do you know\nanything of history, Raoul?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur le chevalier.\"\n\n\"Do you know, then, that Francis II. had always the earache?\"\n\n\"No, I did not know that.\"\n\n\"That Charles IV. had always the headache?\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"And Henry III. had always the stomach-ache?\"\n\nRaoul began to laugh.\n\n\"Well, my dear friend, Louis XIV. always has the heart-ache; it is\ndeplorable to see a king sighing from morning till night without saying\nonce in the course of the day, _ventre-saint-gris! corboef!_ or anything\nto rouse one.\"\n\n\"Was that the reason why you quitted the service, monsieur le\nchevalier?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But you yourself, M. d'Artagnan, are throwing the handle after the axe;\nyou will not make a fortune.\"\n\n\"Who? I?\" replied D'Artagnan, in a careless tone; \"I am settled--I had\nsome family property.\"\n\nRaoul looked at him. The poverty of D'Artagnan was proverbial. A Gascon,\nhe exceeded in ill-luck all the gasconnades of France and Navarre; Raoul\nhad a hundred times heard Job and D'Artagnan named together, as the\ntwins Romulus and Remus. D'Artagnan caught Raoul's look of astonishment.\n\n\"And has not your father told you I have been in England?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur le chevalier.\"\n\n\"And that I there met with a very lucky chance?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, I did not know that.\"\n\n\"Yes, a very worthy friend of mine, a great nobleman, the viceroy of\nScotland and Ireland, has endowed me with an inheritance.\"\n\n\"An inheritance?\"\n\n\"And a good one, too.\"\n\n\"Then you are rich?\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"Receive my sincere congratulation.\"\n\n\"Thank you! Look, that is my house.\"\n\n\"Place de Greve?\"\n\n\"Yes; don't you like this quarter?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, the look-out over the water is pleasant. Oh! what a\npretty old house!\"\n\n\"The sign Notre Dame; it is an old _cabaret_, which I have transformed\ninto a private house in two days.\"\n\n\"But the _cabaret_ is still open?\"\n\n\"_Pardieu!_\"\n\n\"And where do you lodge, then?\"\n\n\"I? I lodge with Planchet.\"\n\n\"You said, just now, 'This is my house.'\"\n\n\"I said so, because, in fact, it is my house. I have bought it.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Raoul.\n\n\"At ten years' purchase, my dear Raoul; a superb affair; I bought the\nhouse for thirty thousand livres; it has a garden which opens to the Rue\nde la Mortillerie; the _cabaret_ lets for a thousand livres, with the\nfirst story; the garret, or second floor, for five hundred livres.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"Five hundred livres for a garret? Why, it is not habitable.\"\n\n\"Therefore no one inhabits it; only, you see, this garret has two\nwindows which look out upon the Place.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, then, every time anybody is broken on the wheel or hung,\nquartered, or burnt, these two windows let for twenty pistoles.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Raoul, with horror.\n\n\"It is disgusting, is it not?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh!\" repeated Raoul.\n\n\"It is disgusting, but so it is. These Parisian cockneys are sometimes\nreal anthropophagi. I cannot conceive how men, Christians, can make such\nspeculation.\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"As for myself,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"if I inhabited that house, on\ndays of execution I would shut it up to the very keyholes; but I do not\ninhabit it.\"\n\n\"And you let the garret for five hundred livres?\"\n\n\"To the ferocious _cabaretier_, who sub-lets it. I said, then, fifteen\nhundred livres.\"\n\n\"The natural interest of money,\" said Raoul,--\"five per cent.\"\n\n\"Exactly so. I then have left the side of the house at the back,\nstore-rooms, and cellars, inundated every winter, two hundred livres;\nand the garden, which is very fine, well planted, well shaded under the\nwalls and the portal of Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais, thirteen hundred\nlivres.\"\n\n\"Thirteen hundred livres! why, that is royal!\"\n\n\"This is the whole history. I strongly suspect some canon of the parish\n(these canons are all rich as Croesus)--I suspect some canon of having\nhired the garden to take his pleasure in. The tenant has given the name\nof M. Godard. That is either a false name or a real name; if true, he is\na canon; if false, he is some unknown; but of what consequence is it to\nme? he always pays in advance. I had also an idea just now, when I met\nyou, of buying a house in the Place Baudoyer, the back premises of which\njoin my garden, and would make a magnificent property. Your dragoons\ninterrupted my calculations. But come, let us take the Rue de la\nVannerie: that will lead us straight to M. Planchet's.\" D'Artagnan\nmended his pace, and conducted Raoul to Planchet's dwelling, a chamber\nof which the grocer had given up to his old master. Planchet was out,\nbut the dinner was ready. There was a remains of military regularity and\npunctuality preserved in the grocer's household. D'Artagnan returned to\nthe subject of Raoul's future.\n\n\"Your father brings you up rather strictly?\" said he.\n\n\"Justly, monsieur le chevalier.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I know Athos is just; but close, perhaps?\"\n\n\"A royal hand, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Well, never want, my boy! If ever you stand in need of a few pistoles,\nthe old musketeer is at hand.\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur d'Artagnan!\"\n\n\"Do you play a little?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Successful with the ladies, then?--Oh! my little Aramis! That, my dear\nfriend, costs even more than play. It is true we fight when we lose;\nthat is a compensation. Bah! that little sniveller, the king, makes\nwinners give him his revenge. What a reign! my poor Raoul, what a reign!\nWhen we think that, in my time, the musketeers were besieged in their\nhouses like Hector and Priam in the city of Troy; and the women wept,\nand then the walls laughed, and then five hundred beggarly fellows\nclapped their hands and cried, 'Kill! kill!' when not one musketeer was\nhurt. _Mordioux!_ you will never see anything like that.\"\n\n\"You are very hard upon the king, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan and yet\nyou scarcely know him.\"\n\n\"I! Listen, Raoul. Day by day, hour by hour,--take note of my words,--I\nwill predict what he will do. The cardinal being dead, he will fret;\nvery well, that is the least silly thing he will do, particularly if he\ndoes not shed a tear.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Why, then he will get M. Fouquet to allow him a pension, and will go\nand compose verses at Fontainebleau, upon some Mancini or other, whose\neyes the queen will scratch out. She is a Spaniard, you see,--this queen\nof ours; and she has, for mother-in-law, Madame Anne of Austria. I know\nsomething of the Spaniards of the house of Austria.\"\n\n\"And next?\"\n\n\"Well, after having torn the silver lace from the uniforms of his Swiss,\nbecause lace is too expensive, he will dismount his musketeers, because\noats and hay of a horse cost five sols a day.\"\n\n\"Oh! do not say that.\"\n\n\"Of what consequence is it to _me?_ I am no longer a musketeer, am\nI? Let them be on horseback, let them be on foot, let them carry a\nlarding-pin, a spit, a sword, or nothing--what is it to _me?_\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, I beseech you speak no more ill of the\nking. I am almost in his service, and my father would be very angry\nwith me for having heard, even from your mouth, words injurious to his\nmajesty.\"\n\n\"Your father, eh! He is a knight in every bad cause. _Pardieu!_ yes,\nyour father is a brave man, a Caesar, it is true--but a man without\nperception.\"\n\n\"Now, my dear chevalier,\" exclaimed Raoul, laughing, \"are you going to\nspeak ill of my father, of him you call the great Athos? Truly you are\nin a bad vein to-day; riches render you as sour as poverty renders other\npeople.\"\n\n\"_Pardieu!_ you are right. I am a rascal and in my dotage; I am an\nunhappy wretch grown old; a tent-cord untwisted, a pierced cuirass, a\nboot without a sole, a spur without a rowel;--but do me the pleasure to\nadd one thing.\"\n\n\"What is that, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Simply say: 'Mazarin was a pitiful wretch.'\"\n\n\"Perhaps he is dead.\"\n\n\"More the reason--I say _was_; if I did not hope that he was dead, I\nwould entreat you to say: 'Mazarin is a pitiful wretch.' Come, say so,\nsay so, for love of me.\"\n\n\"Well, I will.\"\n\n\"Say it!\"\n\n\"Mazarin was a pitiful wretch,\" said Raoul, smiling at the musketeer,\nwho roared with laughter, as in his best days.\n\n\"A moment,\" said the latter; \"you have spoken my first proposition,\nhere is the conclusion of it,--repeat, Raoul, repeat: 'But I regret\nMazarin.'\"\n\n\"Chevalier!\"\n\n\"You will not say it? Well, then, I will say it twice for you.\"\n\n\"But you would regret Mazarin?\"\n\nAnd they were still laughing and discussing this profession of\nprinciples, when one of the shop-boys entered. \"A letter, monsieur,\"\nsaid he, \"for M. d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Thank you; give it me,\" cried the musketeer.\n\n\"The handwriting of monsieur le comte,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\" And D'Artagnan broke the seal.\n\n\"Dear friend,\" said Athos, \"a person has just been here to beg me to\nseek for you, on the part of the king.\"\n\n\"Seek me!\" said D'Artagnan, letting the paper fall upon the table. Raoul\npicked it up, and continued to read aloud:--\n\n\"Make haste. His majesty is very anxious to speak to you, and expects\nyou at the Louvre.\"\n\n\"Expects me?\" again repeated the musketeer.\n\n\"He, he, he!\" laughed Raoul.\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" replied D'Artagnan. \"What the devil can this mean?\"\n\n\n\nChapter LIII. The King.\n\nThe first moment of surprise over, D'Artagnan reperused Athos's note.\n\"It is strange,\" said he, \"that the king should send for me.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" said Raoul; \"do you not think, monsieur, that the king must\nregret such a servant as you?\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" cried the officer, laughing with all his might; \"you are\npoking fun at me, Master Raoul. If the king had regretted me, he would\nnot have let me leave him. No, no; I see in it something better, or\nworse, if you like.\"\n\n\"Worse! What can that be, monsieur le chevalier?\"\n\n\"You are young, you are a boy, you are admirable. Oh, how I should like\nto be as you are! To be but twenty-four, with an unfortunate brow,\nunder which the brain is void of everything but women, love, and good\nintentions. Oh, Raoul, as long as you have not received the smiles\nof kings, the confidence of queens; as long as you have not had two\ncardinals killed under you, the one a tiger, the other a fox; as long as\nyou have not--But what is the good of all this trifling? We must part,\nRaoul.\"\n\n\"How you say the word! What a serious face!\"\n\n\"Eh! but the occasion is worthy of it. Listen to me. I have a very good\nrecommendation to tender you.\"\n\n\"I am all attention, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"You will go and inform your father of my departure.\"\n\n\"Your departure?\"\n\n\"_Pardieu!_ You will tell him I am gone into England; and that I am\nliving in my little country-house.\"\n\n\"In England, you!--And the king's orders?\"\n\n\"You get more and more silly: do you imagine that I am going to\nthe Louvre, to place myself at the disposal of that little crowned\nwolf-cub?\"\n\n\"The king a wolf-cub? Why, monsieur le chevalier, you are mad!\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I never was so sane. You do not know what he wants to\ndo with me, this worthy son of _Louis le Juste!_--But, _mordioux!_ that\nis policy. He wishes to ensconce me snugly in the Bastile--purely and\nsimply, look you!\"\n\n\"What for?\" cried Raoul, terrified at what he heard.\n\n\"On account of what I told him one day at Blois. I was warm; he\nremembers it.\"\n\n\"You told him what?\"\n\n\"That he was mean, cowardly, and silly.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" cried Raoul, \"is it possible that such words should have\nissued from your mouth?\"\n\n\"Perhaps I don't give the letter of my speech, but I give the sense of\nit.\"\n\n\"But did not the king have you arrested immediately?\"\n\n\"By whom? It was I who commanded the musketeers; he must have commanded\nme to convey myself to prison; I would never have consented: I would\nhave resisted myself. And then I went into England--no more D'Artagnan.\nNow, the cardinal is dead, or nearly so, they learn that I am in Paris,\nand they lay their hands on me.\"\n\n\"The cardinal was your protector?\"\n\n\"The cardinal knew me; he knew certain particularities of me; I also\nknew some of his; we appreciated each other mutually. And then, on\nrendering his soul to the devil, he would recommend Anne of Austria to\nmake me the inhabitant of a safe place. Go, then, and find your father,\nrelate the fact to him--and adieu!\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Raoul, very much agitated, after\nhaving looked out the window, \"you cannot even fly!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because there is below an officer of the Swiss guards waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, he will arrest you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan broke into a Homeric laugh.\n\n\"Oh! I know very well that you will resist, that you will fight, even;\nI know very well that you will prove the conqueror; but that amounts to\nrebellion, and you are an officer yourself, knowing what discipline is.\"\n\n\"Devil of a boy, how logical that is!\" grumbled D'Artagnan.\n\n\"You approve of it, do you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, instead of passing into the street, where that idiot is waiting\nfor me, I will slip quietly out at the back. I have a horse in the\nstable, and a good one. I will ride him to death; my means permit me\nto do so, and by killing one horse after another, I shall arrive at\nBoulogne in eleven hours; I know the road. Only tell your father one\nthing.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That is--that the thing he knows about is placed at Planchet's house,\nexcept a fifth, and that--\"\n\n\"But, my dear D'Artagnan, rest assured that if you fly, two things will\nbe said of you.\"\n\n\"What are they, my dear friend?\"\n\n\"The first, that you have been afraid.\"\n\n\"Ah! and who will dare to say that?\"\n\n\"The king first.\"\n\n\"Well! but he will tell the truth,--I am afraid.\"\n\n\"The second, that you knew yourself guilty.\"\n\n\"Guilty of what?\"\n\n\"Why, of the crimes they wish to impute to you.\"\n\n\"That is true again. So, then, you advise me to go and get myself made a\nprisoner in the Bastile?\"\n\n\"M. le Comte de la Fere would advise you just as I do.\"\n\n\"_Pardieu!_ I know he would,\" said D'Artagnan thoughtfully. \"You are\nright, I shall not escape. But if they cast me into the Bastile?\"\n\n\"We will get you out again,\" said Raoul, with a quiet, calm air.\n\n\"_Mordioux!_ You said that after a brave fashion, Raoul,\" said\nD'Artagnan, seizing his hand; \"that savors of Athos, distinctly. Well, I\nwill go, then. Do not forget my last word.\"\n\n\"Except a fifth,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Yes, you are a fine boy! and I wish you to add one thing to that last\nword.\"\n\n\"Speak, chevalier!\"\n\n\"It is that if you cannot get me out of the Bastile, and I remain\nthere--Oh! that will be so, and I shall be a detestable prisoner; I, who\nhave been a passable man,--in that case, I give three-fifths to you, and\nthe fourth to your father.\"\n\n\"Chevalier!\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_ If you will have some masses said for me, you are welcome.\"\n\nThat being said, D'Artagnan took his belt from the hook, girded on his\nsword, took a hat the feather of which was fresh, and held his hand out\nto Raoul, who threw himself into his arms. When in the shop, he cast a\nquick glance at the shop-lads, who looked upon the scene with a pride\nmingled with some inquietude; then plunging his hands into a chest of\ncurrants, he went straight to the officer who was waiting for him at the\ndoor.\n\n\"Those features! Can it be you, Monsieur de Friedisch?\" cried\nD'Artagnan, gayly. \"Eh! eh! what, do we arrest our friends?\"\n\n\"Arrest!\" whispered the lads among themselves.\n\n\"Ja, it is I, Monsieur d'Artagnan! Good-day to you!\" said the Swiss, in\nhis mountain _patois_.\n\n\"Must I give you up my sword? I warn you that it is long and heavy;\nyou had better let me wear if to the Louvre: I feel quite lost in the\nstreets without a sword, and you would be more at a loss that I should,\nwith two.\"\n\n\"The king has given me no orders about it,\" replied the Swiss, \"so keep\nyour sword.\"\n\n\"Well, that is very polite on the part of the king. Let us go, at once.\"\n\nMonsieur Friedisch was not a talker, and D'Artagnan had too many things\nto think about to say much. From Planchet's shop to the Louvre was not\nfar,--they arrived in ten minutes. It was a dark night. M. de Friedisch\nwanted to enter by the wicket. \"No,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you would lose\ntime by that; take the little staircase.\"\n\nThe Swiss did as D'Artagnan advised, and conducted him to the vestibule\nof the king's cabinet. When arrived there, he bowed to his prisoner,\nand, without saying anything, returned to his post. D'Artagnan had not\nhad time to ask why his sword was not taken from him, when the door of\nthe cabinet opened, and a _valet de chambre_ called, \"M. d'Artagnan!\"\nThe musketeer assumed his parade carriage, and entered, with his large\neyes wide open, his brow calm, his moustache stiff. The king was seated\nat a table writing. He did not disturb himself when the step of the\nmusketeer resounded on the floor; he did not even turn his head.\nD'Artagnan advanced as far as the middle of the room, and seeing that\nthe king paid no attention to him, and suspecting, besides, that this\nwas nothing but affectation, a sort of tormenting preamble to the\nexplanation that was preparing, he turned his back on the prince, and\nbegan to examine the frescoes on the cornices, and the cracks in the\nceiling. This maneuver was accompanied by a little tacit monologue. \"Ah!\nyou want to humble me, do you?--you, whom I have seen so young--you,\nwhom I have saved as I would my own child,--you, whom I have served as I\nwould a God--that is to say, for nothing. Wait awhile! wait awhile! you\nshall see what a man can do who has suffered the air of the fire of the\nHuguenots, under the beard of monsieur le cardinal--the true cardinal.\"\nAt this moment Louis turned round.\n\n\"Ah! are you there, Monsieur d'Artagnan?\" said he.\n\nD'Artagnan saw the movement and imitated it. \"Yes, sire,\" said he.\n\n\"Very well; have the goodness to wait till I have cast this up.\"\n\nD'Artagnan made no reply; he only bowed. \"That is polite enough,\"\nthought he; \"I have nothing to say.\"\n\nLouis made a violent dash with his pen, and threw it angrily away.\n\n\"Ah! go on, work yourself up!\" thought the musketeer; \"you will put me\nat my ease. You shall find I did not empty the bag, the other day, at\nBlois.\"\n\nLouis rose from his seat, passed his hand over his brow, then, stopping\nopposite to D'Artagnan, he looked at him with an air at once imperious\nand kind, \"What the devil does he want with me? I wish he would begin!\"\nthought the musketeer.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the king, \"you know, without doubt, that monsieur le\ncardinal is dead?\"\n\n\"I suspected so, sire.\"\n\n\"You know that, consequently, I am master in my own kingdom?\"\n\n\"That is not a thing that dates from the death of monsieur le cardinal,\nsire; a man is always master in his own house, when he wishes to be so.\"\n\n\"Yes; but do you not remember all you said to me at Blois?\"\n\n\"Now we come to it,\" thought D'Artagnan; \"I was not deceived. Well, so\nmuch the better, it is a sign that my scent is tolerably keen yet.\"\n\n\"You do not answer me,\" said Louis.\n\n\"Sire, I think I recollect.\"\n\n\"You only think?\"\n\n\"It is so long ago.\"\n\n\"If you do not remember, I do. You said to me,--listen with attention.\"\n\n\"Ah! I shall listen with all my ears, sire; for it is very likely the\nconversation will turn in a fashion very interesting to me.\"\n\nLouis once more looked at the musketeer. The latter smoothed the feather\nof his hat, then his mustache, and waited bravely. Louis XIV. continued:\n\"You quitted my service, monsieur, after having told me the whole\ntruth?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"That is, after having declared to me all you thought to be true, with\nregard to my mode of thinking and acting. That is always a merit. You\nbegan by telling me that you had served my family thirty years, and were\nfatigued.\"\n\n\"I said so; yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And you afterwards admitted that that fatigue was a pretext, and that\ndiscontent was the real cause.\"\n\n\"I was discontented, in fact; but that discontent has never betrayed\nitself, that I know of, and if, like a man of heart, I have spoken\nout before your majesty, I have not even thought of the matter before\nanybody else.\"\n\n\"Do not excuse yourself, D'Artagnan, but continue to listen to me. When\nmaking me the reproach that you were discontented, you received in reply\na promise:--'Wait.'--Is that not true?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, as true as what I told you.\"\n\n\"You answered me, 'Hereafter! No, now, immediately.' Do not excuse\nyourself, I tell you. It was natural, but you had no charity for your\npoor prince, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Sire!--charity for a king, on the part of a poor soldier!\"\n\n\"You understand me very well; you knew that I stood in need of it; you\nknew very well that I was not master; you knew very well that my hope\nwas in the future. Now, you answered me when I spoke of the future, 'My\ndischarge,--and that directly.'\"\n\n\"That is true,\" murmured D'Artagnan, biting his mustache.\n\n\"You did not flatter me when I was in distress,\" added Louis.\n\n\"But,\" said D'Artagnan, raising his head nobly, \"if I did not flatter\nyour majesty when poor, neither did I betray you. I have shed my blood\nfor nothing; I have watched like a dog at a door, knowing full well that\nneither bread nor bone would be thrown to me. I, although poor likewise,\nasked nothing of your majesty but the discharge you speak of.\"\n\n\"I know you are a brave man, but I was a young man, and you ought to\nhave had some indulgence for me. What had you to reproach the king\nwith?--that he left King Charles II. without assistance?--let us say\nfurther--that he did not marry Mademoiselle de Mancini?\" When saying\nthese words, the king fixed upon the musketeer a searching look.\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" thought the latter, \"he is doing far more than remembering, he\ndivines. The devil!\"\n\n\"Your sentence,\" continued Louis, \"fell upon the king and fell upon the\nman. But, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that weakness, for you considered it\na weakness?\"--D'Artagnan made no reply--\"you reproached me also with\nregard to monsieur, the defunct cardinal. Now, monsieur le cardinal,\ndid he not bring me up, did he not support me?--elevating himself\nand supporting himself at the same time, I admit; but the benefit was\ndischarged. As an ingrate or an egotist, would you, then, have better\nloved or served me?\"\n\n\"Sire!\"\n\n\"We will say no more about it, monsieur; it would only create in you too\nmany regrets, and me too much pain.\"\n\nD'Artagnan was not convinced. The young king, in adopting a tone of\n_hauteur_ with him, did not forward his purpose.\n\n\"You have since reflected?\" resumed Louis.\n\n\"Upon what, sire?\" asked D'Artagnan, politely.\n\n\"Why, upon all that I have said to you, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, no doubt--\"\n\n\"And you have only waited for an opportunity of retracting your words?\"\n\n\"Sire!\"\n\n\"You hesitate, it seems.\"\n\n\"I do not understand what your majesty did me the honor to say to me.\"\n\nLouis's brow became cloudy.\n\n\"Have the goodness to excuse me, sire; my understanding is particularly\nthick; things do not penetrate it without difficulty; but it is true,\nonce they get in, they remain there.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; you appear to have a memory.\"\n\n\"Almost as good a one as your majesty's.\"\n\n\"Then give me quickly one solution. My time is valuable. What have you\nbeen doing since your discharge?\"\n\n\"Making my fortune, sire.\"\n\n\"The expression is crude, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Your majesty takes it in bad part, certainly. I entertain nothing but\nthe profoundest respect for the king; and if I have been impolite, which\nmight be excused by my long sojourn in camps and barracks, your majesty\nis too much above me to be offended at a word that innocently escapes\nfrom a soldier.\"\n\n\"In fact, I know you performed a brilliant action in England, monsieur.\nI only regret that you have broken your promise.\"\n\n\"I!\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Doubtless. You engaged your word not to serve any other prince on\nquitting my service. Now it was for King Charles II. that you undertook\nthe marvelous carrying off of M. Monk.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, sire; it was for myself.\"\n\n\"And did you succeed?\"\n\n\"Like the captains of the fifteenth century, _coups-de-main_ and\nadventures.\"\n\n\"What do you call succeeding?--a fortune?\"\n\n\"A hundred thousand crowns, sire, which I now possess--that is, in one\nweek three times as much money as I ever had in fifty years.\"\n\n\"It is a handsome sum. But you are ambitious, I perceive.\"\n\n\"I, sire? The quarter of that would be a treasure; and I swear to you I\nhave no thought of augmenting it.\"\n\n\"What! you contemplate remaining idle?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"You mean to drop the sword?\"\n\n\"That I have already done.\"\n\n\"Impossible, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Louis, firmly.\n\n\"But, sire--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"And why, sire?\"\n\n\"Because it is _my_ wish you should not!\" said the young prince, in a\nvoice so stern and imperious that D'Artagnan evinced surprise and even\nuneasiness.\n\n\"Will your majesty allow me one word of reply?\" said he.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"I formed that resolution when I was poor and destitute.\"\n\n\"So be it. Go on.\"\n\n\"Now, when by my energy I have acquired a comfortable means of\nsubsistence, would your majesty despoil me of my liberty? Your majesty\nwould condemn me to the lowest, when I have gained the highest?\"\n\n\"Who gave you permission, monsieur, to fathom my designs, or to reckon\nwith me?\" replied Louis, in a voice almost angry; \"who told you what I\nshall do or what you will yourself do?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said the musketeer, quietly, \"as far as I see, freedom is\nnot the order of the conversation, as it was on the day we came to an\nexplanation at Blois.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; everything is changed.\"\n\n\"I tender your majesty my sincere compliments upon that, but--\"\n\n\"But you don't believe it?\"\n\n\"I am not a great statesman, and yet I have my eye upon affairs; it\nseldom fails; now, I do not see exactly as your majesty does, sire. The\nreign of Mazarin is over, but that of the financiers is begun. They have\nthe money; your majesty will not often see much of it. To live under\nthe paw of these hungry wolves is hard for a man who reckoned upon\nindependence.\"\n\nAt this moment someone scratched at the door of the cabinet; the king\nraised his head proudly. \"Your pardon, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said he;\n\"it is M. Colbert, who comes to make me a report. Come in, M. Colbert.\"\n\nD'Artagnan drew back. Colbert entered with papers in his hand, and went\nup to the king. There can be little doubt that the Gascon did not lose\nthe opportunity of applying his keen, quick glance to the new figure\nwhich presented itself.\n\n\"Is the inquiry made?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And the opinion of the inquisitors?\"\n\n\"Is that the accused merit confiscation and death.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said the king, without changing countenance, and casting an\noblique look at D'Artagnan. \"And your own opinion, M. Colbert?\" said he.\n\nColbert looked at D'Artagnan is his turn. That imposing countenance\nchecked the words upon his lips. Louis perceived this. \"Do not disturb\nyourself,\" said he; \"it is M. d'Artagnan,--do you not know M. d'Artagnan\nagain?\"\n\nThese two men looked at each other--D'Artagnan, with eyes open and\nbright as the day--Colbert, with his half closed, and dim. The frank\nintrepidity of the financier annoyed the other; the circumspection of\nthe financier disgusted the soldier. \"Ah! ah! this is the gentleman\nwho made that brilliant stroke in England,\" said Colbert. And he bowed\nslightly to D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said the Gascon, \"this is the gentleman who clipped off the\nlace from the uniform of the Swiss! A praiseworthy piece of economy.\"\n\nThe financier thought to pierce the musketeer; but the musketeer ran the\nfinancier through.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" resumed the king, who had not remarked all the\nshades of which Mazarin would have missed not one, \"this concerns the\nfarmers of the revenue who have robbed me, whom I am hanging, and whose\ndeath-warrants I am about to sign.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said D'Artagnan, starting.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"Oh! nothing, sire. This is no business of mine.\"\n\nThe king had already taken up the pen, and was applying it to the paper.\n\"Sire,\" said Colbert in a subdued voice, \"I beg to warn your majesty,\nthat if an example be necessary, there will be difficulty in the\nexecution of your orders.\"\n\n\"What do you say?\" said Louis.\n\n\"You must not conceal from yourself,\" continued Colbert quietly, \"that\nattacking the farmers-general is attacking the superintendence. The\ntwo unfortunate guilty men in question are the particular friends of\na powerful personage, and the punishment, which otherwise might be\ncomfortably confined to the Chatlet, will doubtless be a signal for\ndisturbances!\"\n\nLouis colored and turned towards D'Artagnan, who took a slight bite at\nhis mustache, not without a smile of pity for the financier, and for\nthe king who had to listen to him so long. But Louis seized the pen, and\nwith a movement so rapid that his hand shook, he affixed his signature\nat the bottom of the two papers presented by Colbert,--then looking the\nlatter in the face,--\"Monsieur Colbert,\" said he, \"when you speak to\nme on business, exclude more frequently the word difficulty from your\nreasonings and opinions; as to the word impossibility, never pronounce\nit.\"\n\nColbert bowed, much humiliated at having to undergo such a lesson before\nthe musketeer; he was about to go out, but, jealous to repair his check:\n\"I forgot to announce to your majesty,\" said he, \"that the confiscations\namount to the sum of five millions of livres.\"\n\n\"That's pretty well!\" thought D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Which makes in my coffers?\" said the king.\n\n\"Eighteen millions of livres, sire,\" replied Colbert, bowing.\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" growled D'Artagnan, \"that's glorious!\"\n\n\"Monsieur Colbert,\" added the king, \"you will, if you please, go through\nthe gallery where M. Lyonne is waiting, and will tell him to bring\nhither what he has drawn up--by my order.\"\n\n\"Directly, sire; if your majesty wants me no more this evening?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur: good-night!\" And Colbert went out.\n\n\"Now, let us return to our affair, M. d'Artagnan,\" said the king, as\nif nothing had happened. \"You see that, with respect to money, there is\nalready a notable change.\"\n\n\"Something to the tune of from zero to eighteen millions,\" replied the\nmusketeer gayly. \"Ah! that was what your majesty wanted the day King\nCharles II. came to Blois. The two states would not have been embroiled\nto-day; for I must say, that there also I see another stumbling-block.\"\n\n\"Well, in the first place,\" replied Louis, \"you are unjust, monsieur;\nfor, if Providence had made me able to give my brother the million that\nday, you would not have quitted my service, and, consequently, you would\nnot have made your fortune, as you told me just now you have done. But,\nin addition to this, I have had another piece of good fortune; and my\ndifference with Great Britain need not alarm you.\"\n\nA _valet de chambre_ interrupted the king by announcing M. Lyonne. \"Come\nin, monsieur,\" said the king; \"you are punctual; that is like a good\nservant. Let us see your letter to my brother Charles II.\"\n\nD'Artagnan pricked up his ears. \"A moment, monsieur,\" said Louis\ncarelessly to the Gascon; \"I must expedite to London my consent to the\nmarriage of my brother, M. le Duc d'Anjou, with the Princess Henrietta\nStuart.\"\n\n\"He is knocking me about, it seems,\" murmured D'Artagnan, whilst the\nking signed the letter, and dismissed M. de Lyonne; \"but _ma foi!_ the\nmore he knocks me about in this manner, the better I like it.\"\n\nThe king followed M. de Lyonne with his eyes, till the door was\nclosed behind him; he even made three steps, as if he would follow the\nminister; but, after these three steps, stopping, passing, and coming\nback to the musketeer,--\"Now, monsieur,\" said he, \"let us hasten to\nterminate our affair. You told me the other day, at Blois, that you were\nnot rich?\"\n\n\"But I am now, sire.\"\n\n\"Yes, but that does not concern me; you have your own money, not mine;\n_that_ does not enter into my account.\"\n\n\"I do not well understand what your majesty means.\"\n\n\"Then, instead of leaving you to draw out words, speak spontaneously.\nShould you be satisfied with twenty thousand livres a year as a fixed\nincome?\"\n\n\"But, sire\" said D'Artagnan, opening his eyes to the utmost.\n\n\"Would you be satisfied with four horses furnished and kept, and with\na supplement of funds such as you might require, according to occasions\nand needs, or would you prefer a fixed sum which would be, for example,\nforty thousand livres? Answer.\"\n\n\"Sire, your majesty--\"\n\n\"Yes, you are surprised; that is natural, and I expected it. Answer me,\ncome! or I shall think you have no longer that rapidity of judgment I\nhave so much admired in you.\"\n\n\"It is certain, sire, that twenty thousand livres a year make a handsome\nsum; but--\"\n\n\"No buts! Yes or no, is it an honorable indemnity?\"\n\n\"Oh! very certainly.\"\n\n\"You will be satisfied with it? That is well. It will be better to\nreckon the extra expenses separately; you can arrange that with Colbert.\nNow let us pass to something more important.\"\n\n\"But, sire, I told your majesty--\"\n\n\"That you wanted rest, I know you did: only I replied that I would not\nallow it--I am master, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"That is well. You were formerly in the way of becoming captain of the\nmusketeers?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Well, here is your commission signed. I place it in this drawer.\nThe day on which you return from a certain expedition which I have to\nconfide to you, on that day you may yourself take the commission from\nthe drawer.\" D'Artagnan still hesitated, and hung down his head. \"Come,\nmonsieur,\" said the king, \"one would believe, to look at you, that\nyou did not know that at the court of the most Christian king, the\ncaptain-general of the musketeers takes precedence of the marechals of\nFrance.\"\n\n\"Sire, I know he does.\"\n\n\"Then, am I to think you do put no faith in my word?\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, never--never dream of such a thing.\"\n\n\"I have wished to prove to you, that you, so good a servant, had lost a\ngood master; am I anything like the master that will suit you?\"\n\n\"I begin to think you are, sire.\"\n\n\"Then, monsieur, you will resume your functions. Your company is quite\ndisorganized since your departure, and the men go about drinking and\nrioting in the _cabarets_, where they fight, in spite of my edicts,\nand those of my father. You will reorganize the service as soon as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"You will not again quit my person.\"\n\n\"Very well, sire.\"\n\n\"You will march with me to the army, you will encamp round my tent.\"\n\n\"Then, sire,\" said D'Artagnan, \"if it is only to impose upon me a\nservice like that, your majesty need not give me twenty thousand livres\na year. I shall not earn them.\"\n\n\"I desire that you shall keep open house; I desire that you should keep\na liberal table; I desire that my captain of musketeers should be a\npersonage.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said D'Artagnan, bluntly; \"I do not like easily found money;\nI like money won! Your majesty gives me an idle trade, which the first\ncomer would perform for four thousand livres.\"\n\nLouis XIV. began to laugh. \"You are a true Gascon, Monsieur d'Artagnan;\nyou will draw my heart's secret from me.\"\n\n\"Bah! has your majesty a secret, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well! then I accept the twenty thousand livres, for I will keep that\nsecret, and discretion is above all price, in these times. Will your\nmajesty speak now?\"\n\n\"Boot yourself, Monsieur d'Artagnan, and to horse!\"\n\n\"Directly, sire.\"\n\n\"Within two days.\"\n\n\"That is well, sire: for I have my affairs to settle before I set out;\nparticularly if it is likely there should be any blows stirring.\"\n\n\"That _may_ happen.\"\n\n\"We can receive them! But, sire, you have addressed yourself to avarice,\nto ambition; you have addressed yourself to the heart of M. d'Artagnan,\nbut you have forgotten one thing.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"You have said nothing to his vanity; when shall I be a knight of the\nking's orders?\"\n\n\"Does that interest you?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, sire. My friend Athos is quite covered with orders, and that\ndazzles me.\"\n\n\"You shall be a knight of my order a month after you have taken your\ncommission of captain.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said the officer, thoughtfully, \"after the expedition.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"Where is your majesty going to send me?\"\n\n\"Are you acquainted with Bretagne?\"\n\n\"No, sire.\"\n\n\"Have you any friends there?\"\n\n\"In Bretagne? No, _ma foi!_\"\n\n\"So much the better. Do you know anything about fortifications?\"\n\n\"I believe I do, sire,\" said D'Artagnan, smiling.\n\n\"That is to say you can readily distinguish a fortress from a simple\nfortification, such as is allowed to _chatelains_ or vassals?\"\n\n\"I distinguish a fort from a rampart as I distinguish a cuirass from a\nraised pie-crust, sire. Is that sufficient?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur. You will set out, then.\"\n\n\"For Bretagne?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"Absolutely alone. That is to say, you must not even take a lackey with\nyou.\"\n\n\"May I ask your majesty for what reason?\"\n\n\"Because, monsieur, it will be necessary to disguise yourself sometimes,\nas the servant of a good family. Your face is very well known in France,\nM. d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"And then, sire?\"\n\n\"And then you will travel slowly through Bretagne, and will examine the\nfortifications of that country.\"\n\n\"The coasts?\"\n\n\"Yes, and the isles; commencing by Belle-Ile-en-Mer.\"\n\n\"Ah! which belongs to M. Fouquet!\" said D'Artagnan, in a serious tone,\nraising his intelligent eye to Louis XIV.\n\n\"I fancy you are right, monsieur, and that Bell-Isle does belong to M.\nFouquet, in fact.\"\n\n\"Then your majesty wishes me to ascertain if Belle-Isle is a strong\nplace?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"If the fortifications of it are new or old?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"And if the vassals of M. Fouquet are sufficiently numerous to form a\ngarrison?\"\n\n\"That is what I want to know; you have placed your finger on the\nquestion.\"\n\n\"And if they are not fortifying, sire?\"\n\n\"You will travel about Bretagne, listening and judging.\"\n\n\"Then I am a king's spy?\" said D'Artagnan, bluntly, twisting his\nmustache.\n\n\"No, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Your pardon sire; I spy on your majesty's account.\"\n\n\"You start on a voyage of discovery, monsieur. Would you march at the\nhead of your musketeers, with your sword in your hand, to observe any\nspot whatever, or an enemy's position?\"\n\nAt this word D'Artagnan started.\n\n\"Do you,\" continued the king, \"imagine yourself to be a spy?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said D'Artagnan, but pensively; \"the thing changes its face\nwhen one observes an enemy: one is but a soldier. And if they are\nfortifying Belle-Isle?\" added he, quickly.\n\n\"You will take an exact plan of the fortifications.\"\n\n\"Will they permit me to enter?\"\n\n\"That does not concern me; that is _your_ affair. Did you not understand\nthat I reserved for you a supplement of twenty thousand livres per\nannum, if you wished it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire; but if they are not fortifying?\"\n\n\"You will return quietly, without fatiguing your horse.\"\n\n\"Sire, I am ready.\"\n\n\"You will begin to-morrow by going to monsieur le surintendant's to take\nthe first quarter of the pension I give you. Do you know M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"Very little, sire; but I beg your majesty to observe that I don't think\nit immediately necessary that I _should_ know him.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, monsieur; for he will refuse you the money I wish you to\ntake; and it is that refusal I look for.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said D'Artagnan. \"Then, sire?\"\n\n\"The money being refused, you will go and seek it at M. Colbert's. _A\npropos_, have you a good horse?\"\n\n\"An excellent one, sire.\"\n\n\"How much did it cost you?\"\n\n\"A hundred and fifty pistoles.\"\n\n\"I will buy it of you. Here is a note for two hundred pistoles.\"\n\n\"But I want a horse for my journey, sire.\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"Well, and you take mine from me.\"\n\n\"Not at all. On the contrary, I give it you. Only as it is now mine and\nnot yours, I am sure you will not spare it.\"\n\n\"Your majesty is in a hurry, then?\"\n\n\"A great hurry.\"\n\n\"Then what compels me to wait two days?\"\n\n\"Reasons known to myself.\"\n\n\"That's a different affair. The horse may make up the two days, in the\neight he has to travel; and then there is the post.\"\n\n\"No, no, the post compromises, Monsieur d'Artagnan. Begone and do not\nforget you are my servant.\"\n\n\"Sire, it is not my duty to forget it! At what hour to-morrow shall I\ntake my leave of your majesty?\"\n\n\"Whence do you lodge?\"\n\n\"I must henceforward lodge at the Louvre.\"\n\n\"That must not be now--keep your lodgings in the city: I will pay for\nthem. As to your departure, it must take place at night; you must set\nout without being seen by any one, or, if you are seen, it must not be\nknown that you belong to me. Keep your mouth shut, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Your majesty spoils all you have said by that single word.\"\n\n\"I asked where you lodged, for I cannot always send to M. le Comte de la\nFere to seek you.\"\n\n\"I lodge with M. Planchet, a grocer, Rue des Lombards, at the sign of\nthe Pilon d'Or.\"\n\n\"Go out but little, show yourself less, and await my orders.\"\n\n\"And yet, sire, I must go for the money.\"\n\n\"That is true, but when going to the superintendence, where so many\npeople are constantly going, you must mingle with the crowd.\"\n\n\"I want the notes, sire, for the money.\"\n\n\"Here they are.\" The king signed them, and D'Artagnan looked on, to\nassure himself of their regularity.\n\n\"Adieu! Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" added the king; \"I think you have\nperfectly understood me.\"\n\n\"I? I understand that your majesty sends me to Belle-Ile-en-Mer, that is\nall.\"\n\n\"To learn?\"\n\n\"To learn how M. Fouquet's works are going on; that is all.\"\n\n\"Very well: I admit you may be taken.\"\n\n\"And I do not admit it,\" replied the Gascon, boldly.\n\n\"I admit you may be killed,\" continued the king.\n\n\"That is not probable, sire.\"\n\n\"In the first case, you must not speak; in the second there must be no\npapers found upon you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan shrugged his shoulders without ceremony, and took leave of\nthe king, saying to himself:--\"The English shower continues--let us\nremain under the spout!\"\n\n\n\nChapter LIV. The Houses of M. Fouquet.\n\nWhilst D'Artagnan was returning to Planchet's house, his head aching and\nbewildered with all that had happened to him, there was passing a scene\nof quite a different character, and which, nevertheless, is not foreign\nto the conversation our musketeer had just had with the king; only\nthis scene took place out of Paris, in a house possessed by the\nsuperintendent Fouquet in the village of Saint-Mande. The minister had\njust arrived at this country-house, followed by his principal clerk, who\ncarried an enormous portfolio full of papers to be examined, and\nothers waiting for signature. As it might be about five o'clock in the\nafternoon, the masters had dined: supper was being prepared for twenty\nsubaltern guests. The superintendent did not stop: on alighting from his\ncarriage, he, at the same bound, sprang through the doorway, traversed\nthe apartments and gained his cabinet, where he declared he would shut\nhimself up to work, commanding that he should not be disturbed for\nanything but an order from the king. As soon as this order was given,\nFouquet shut himself up, and two footmen were placed as sentinels at his\ndoor. Then Fouquet pushed a bolt which displaced a panel that walled\nup the entrance, and prevented everything that passed in this apartment\nfrom being either seen or heard. But, against all probability, it was\nonly for the sake of shutting himself up that Fouquet shut himself up\nthus, for he went straight to a bureau, seated himself at it, opened\nthe portfolio, and began to make a choice amongst the enormous mass\nof papers it contained. It was not more than ten minutes after he had\nentered, and taken all the precautions we have described, when the\nrepeated noise of several slight equal knocks struck his ear, and\nappeared to fix his utmost attention. Fouquet raised his head, turned\nhis ear, and listened.\n\nThe strokes continued. Then the worker arose with a slight movement of\nimpatience and walked straight up to a glass behind which the blows were\nstruck by a hand, or by some invisible mechanism. It was a large glass\nlet into a panel. Three other glasses, exactly similar to it, completed\nthe symmetry of the apartment. Nothing distinguished that one from the\nothers. Without doubt, these reiterated knocks were a signal; for, at\nthe moment Fouquet approached the glass listening, the same noise was\nrenewed, and in the same measure. \"Oh! oh!\" murmured the _intendant_,\nwith surprise, \"who is yonder? I did not expect anybody to-day.\" And\nwithout doubt, to respond to the signal, he pulled out a gilded nail\nnear the glass, and shook it thrice. Then returning to his place, and\nseating himself again, \"_Ma foi!_ let them wait,\" said he. And plunging\nagain into the ocean of papers unrolled before him, he appeared to think\nof nothing now but work. In fact, with incredible rapidity and marvelous\nlucidity, Fouquet deciphered the largest papers and most complicated\nwritings, correcting them, annotating them with a pen moved as if by\na fever, and the work melting under his hands, signatures, figures,\nreferences, became multiplied as if ten clerks--that is to say, a\nhundred fingers and ten brains had performed the duties, instead of\nthe five fingers and single brain of this man. From time to time, only,\nFouquet, absorbed by his work, raised his head to cast a furtive glance\nupon a clock placed before him. The reason of this was, Fouquet set\nhimself a task, and when this task was once set, in one hour's work\nhe, by himself, did what another would not have accomplished in a day;\nalways certain, consequently, provided he was not disturbed, of arriving\nat the close in the time his devouring activity had fixed. But in the\nmidst of his ardent labor, the soft strokes upon the little bell placed\nbehind the glass sounded again, hasty, and, consequently, more urgent.\n\n\"The lady appears to be impatient,\" said Fouquet. \"Humph! a calm! That\nmust be the comtesse; but, no, the comtesse is gone to Rambouillet\nfor three days. The presidente, then? Oh! no, the presidente would not\nassume such grand airs; she would ring very humbly, then she would wait\nmy good pleasure. The greatest certainty is, that I do not know who\nit can be, but that I know who it cannot be. And since it is not you,\nmarquise, since it cannot be you, deuce take the rest!\" And he went on\nwith his work in spite of the reiterated appeals of the bell. At the end\nof a quarter of an hour, however, impatience prevailed over Fouquet in\nhis turn: he might be said to consume, rather than to complete the\nrest of his work; he thrust his papers into his portfolio, and giving a\nglance at the mirror, whilst the taps continued faster than ever: \"Oh!\noh!\" said he, \"whence comes all this racket? What has happened, and who\ncan the Ariadne be who expects me so impatiently. Let us see!\"\n\nHe then applied the tip of his finger to the nail parallel to the one\nhe had drawn. Immediately the glass moved like a folding-door and\ndiscovered a secret closet, rather deep, into which the superintendent\ndisappeared as if going into a vast box. When there, he touched another\nspring, which opened, not a board, but a block of the wall, and he went\nout by that opening, leaving the door to shut of itself. Then Fouquet\ndescended about a score of steps which sank, winding, underground,\nand came to a long, subterranean passage, lighted by imperceptible\nloopholes. The walls of this vault were covered with slabs or tiles,\nand the floor with carpeting. This passage was under the street itself,\nwhich separated Fouquet's house from the Park of Vincennes. At the end\nof the passage ascended a winding staircase parallel with that by which\nFouquet had entered. He mounted these other stairs, entered by means\nof a spring placed in a closet similar to that in his cabinet, and from\nthis closet an untenanted chamber furnished with the utmost elegance.\nAs soon as he entered, he examined carefully whether the glass\nclosed without leaving any trace, and, doubtless satisfied with\nhis observation, he opened by means of a small gold key the triple\nfastenings of a door in front of him. This time the door opened upon\na handsome cabinet, sumptuously furnished, in which was seated upon\ncushions a lady of surpassing beauty, who at the sound of the lock\nsprang towards Fouquet. \"Ah! good heavens!\" cried the latter, starting\nback with astonishment. \"Madame la Marquise de Belliere, you here?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured la marquise. \"Yes; it is I, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Marquise! dear marquise!\" added Fouquet, ready to prostrate himself.\n\"Ah! my God! how did you come here? And I, to keep you waiting!\"\n\n\"A long time, monsieur; yes, a very long time!\"\n\n\"I am happy in thinking this waiting has appeared long to you,\nmarquise!\"\n\n\"Oh! an eternity, monsieur; oh! I rang more than twenty times. Did you\nnot hear me?\"\n\n\"Marquise, you are pale, you tremble.\"\n\n\"Did you not hear, then, that you were summoned?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I heard plainly enough, madame; but I could not come. After\nyour rigors and your refusals, how could I dream it was you? If I could\nhave had any suspicion of the happiness that awaited me, believe me,\nmadame, I would have quitted everything to fall at your feet, as I do at\nthis moment.\"\n\n\"Are we quite alone, monsieur?\" asked the marquise, looking round the\nroom.\n\n\"Oh, yes, madame, I can assure you of that.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said the marquise, in a melancholy tone.\n\n\"You sigh!\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"What mysteries! what precautions!\" said the marquise, with a slight\nbitterness of expression; \"and how evident it is that you fear the least\nsuspicion of your amours to escape.\"\n\n\"Would you prefer their being made public?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; you act like a delicate man,\" said the marquise, smiling.\n\n\"Come, dear marquise, punish me not with reproaches, I implore you.\"\n\n\"Reproaches! Have I a right to make you any?\"\n\n\"No, unfortunately, no; but tell me, you, who during a year I have loved\nwithout return or hope--\"\n\n\"You are mistaken--without hope it is true, but not without return.\"\n\n\"What! for me, of my love! there is but one proof, and that proof I\nstill want.\"\n\n\"I am here to bring it, monsieur.\"\n\nFouquet wished to clasp her in his arms, but she disengaged herself with\na gesture.\n\n\"You persist in deceiving yourself, monsieur, and will never accept of\nme the only thing I am willing to give you--devotion.\"\n\n\"Ah, then, you do not love me? Devotion is but a virtue, love is a\npassion.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, I implore you: I should not have come hither without a\nserious motive: you are well assured of that, are you not?\"\n\n\"The motive is of very little consequence, so that you are but here--so\nthat I see you--so that I speak to you!\"\n\n\"You are right; the principal thing is that I am here without any one\nhaving seen me, and that I can speak to you.\"--Fouquet sank on his knees\nbefore her. \"Speak! speak, madame!\" said he, \"I listen to you.\"\n\nThe marquise looked at Fouquet, on his knees at her feet, and there\nwas in the looks of the woman a strange mixture of love and melancholy.\n\"Oh!\" at length murmured she, \"would that I were she who has the right\nof seeing you every minute, of speaking to you every instant! would\nthat I were she who might watch over you, she who would have no need of\nmysterious springs to summon and cause to appear, like a sylph, the man\nshe loves, to look at him for an hour, and then see him disappear in the\ndarkness of a mystery, still more strange at his going out than at his\ncoming in. Oh! that would be to live like a happy woman!\"\n\n\"Do you happen, marquise,\" said Fouquet, smiling, \"to be speaking of my\nwife?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly, of her I spoke.\"\n\n\"Well, you need not envy her lot, marquise; of all the women with whom\nI have had any relations, Madame Fouquet is the one I see the least of,\nand who has the least intercourse with me.\"\n\n\"At least, monsieur, she is not reduced to place, as I have done, her\nhand upon the ornament of a glass to call you to her; at least you do\nnot reply to her by the mysterious, alarming sound of a bell, the spring\nof which comes from I don't know where; at least you have not forbidden\nher to endeavor to discover the secret of these communications under\npain of breaking off forever your connections with her, as you have\nforbidden all who come here before me, and who will come after me.\"\n\n\"Dear marquise, how unjust you are, and how little do you know what you\nare doing in thus exclaiming against mystery; it is with mystery alone\nwe can love without trouble; it is with love without trouble alone that\nwe can be happy. But let us return to ourselves, to that devotion\nof which you were speaking, or rather let me labor under a pleasing\ndelusion, and believe this devotion is love.\"\n\n\"Just now,\" repeated the marquise, passing over her eyes a hand that\nmight have been a model for the graceful contours of antiquity; \"just\nnow I was prepared to speak, my ideas were clear and bold; now I am\nquite confused, quite troubled; I fear I bring you bad news.\"\n\n\"If it is to that bad news I owe your presence, marquise, welcome be\neven that bad news! or rather, marquise, since you allow that I am not\nquite indifferent to you, let me hear nothing of the bad news, but speak\nof yourself.\"\n\n\"No, no, on the contrary, demand it of me; require me to tell it to you\ninstantly, and not to allow myself to be turned aside by any feeling\nwhatever. Fouquet, my friend! it is of immense importance.\"\n\n\"You astonish me, marquise; I will even say you almost frighten me. You,\nso serious, so collected; you who know the world we live in so well. Is\nit, then, important?\"\n\n\"Oh! very important.\"\n\n\"In the first place, how did you come here?\"\n\n\"You shall know that presently; but first to something of more\nconsequence.\"\n\n\"Speak, marquise, speak! I implore you, have pity on my impatience.\"\n\n\"Do you know that Colbert is made intendant of the finances?\"\n\n\"Bah! Colbert, little Colbert.\"\n\n\"Yes, Colbert, _little_ Colbert.\"\n\n\"Mazarin's factotum?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"Well! what do you see so terrific in that, dear marquise? little\nColbert is intendant; that is astonishing I confess, but is not\nterrible.\"\n\n\"Do you think the king has given, without pressing motive, such a place\nto one you call a little _cuistre?_\"\n\n\"In the first place, is it positively true that the king has given it to\nhim?\"\n\n\"It is so said.\"\n\n\"Ay, but who says so?\"\n\n\"Everybody.\"\n\n\"Everybody, that's nobody; mention some one likely to be well informed\nwho says so.\"\n\n\"Madame Vanel.\"\n\n\"Ah! now you begin to frighten me in earnest,\" said Fouquet, laughing;\n\"if any one is well informed, or ought to be well informed, it is the\nperson you name.\"\n\n\"Do not speak ill of poor Marguerite, Monsieur Fouquet, for she still\nloves you.\"\n\n\"Bah! indeed? That is scarcely credible. I thought little Colbert, as\nyou said just now, had passed over that love, and left the impression\nupon it of a spot of ink or a stain of grease.\"\n\n\"Fouquet! Fouquet! Is this the way you always treat the poor creatures\nyou desert?\"\n\n\"Why, you surely are not going to undertake the defense of Madame\nVanel?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will undertake it; for, I repeat, she loves you still, and the\nproof is she saves you.\"\n\n\"But your interposition, marquise; that is very cunning on her part. No\nangel could be more agreeable to me, or could lead me more certainly to\nsalvation. But, let me ask you, do you know Marguerite?\"\n\n\"She was my convent friend.\"\n\n\"And you say that she has informed you that Monsieur Colbert was named\nintendant?\"\n\n\"Yes, she did.\"\n\n\"Well, enlighten me, marquise; granted Monsieur Colbert is intendant--so\nbe it. In what can an intendant, that is to say my subordinate, my\nclerk, give me umbrage or injure me, even if he is Monsieur Colbert?\"\n\n\"You do not reflect, monsieur, apparently,\" replied the marquise.\n\n\"Upon what?\"\n\n\"This: that Monsieur Colbert hates you.\"\n\n\"Hates me?\" cried Fouquet. \"Good heavens! marquise, whence do you come?\nwhere can you live? Hates me! why all the world hates me, he, of course,\nas others do.\"\n\n\"He more than others.\"\n\n\"More than others--let him.\"\n\n\"He is ambitious.\"\n\n\"Who is not, marquise.\"\n\n\"Yes, but with him ambition has no bounds.\"\n\n\"I am quite aware of that, since he made it a point to succeed me with\nMadame Vanel.\"\n\n\"And obtained his end; look at that.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say he has the presumption to pass from intendant to\nsuperintendent?\"\n\n\"Have you not yourself already had the same fear?\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said Fouquet, \"to succeed with Madame Vanel is one thing, to\nsucceed me with the king is another. France is not to be purchased so\neasily as the wife of a _maitre des comptes_.\"\n\n\"Eh! monsieur, everything is to be bought; if not by gold, by intrigue.\"\n\n\"Nobody knows to the contrary better than you, madame, you to whom I\nhave offered millions.\"\n\n\"Instead of millions, Fouquet, you should have offered me a true, only\nand boundless love: I might have accepted that. So you see, still,\neverything is to be bought, if not in one way, by another.\"\n\n\"So, Colbert, in your opinion, is in a fair way of bargaining for\nmy place of superintendent. Make yourself easy on that head, my dear\nmarquise; he is not yet rich enough to purchase it.\"\n\n\"But if he should rob you of it?\"\n\n\"Ah! that is another thing. Unfortunately, before he can reach me, that\nis to say, the body of the place, he must destroy, must make a breach in\nthe advanced works, and I am devilishly well fortified, marquise.\"\n\n\"What you call your advanced works are your creatures, are they\nnot--your friends?\"\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\n\"And is M. d'Eymeris one of your creatures?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is.\"\n\n\"Is M. Lyodot one of your friends?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"M. de Vanin?\"\n\n\"M. de Vanin! ah! they may do what they like with him, but--\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"But they must not touch the others!\"\n\n\"Well, if you are anxious they should not touch MM. d'Eymeris and\nLyodot, it is time to look about you.\"\n\n\"Who threatens them?\"\n\n\"Will you listen to me now?\"\n\n\"Attentively, marquise.\"\n\n\"Without interrupting me?\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Well, this morning Marguerite sent for me.\"\n\n\"And what did she want with you?\"\n\n\"'I dare not see M. Fouquet myself,' said she.\"\n\n\"Bah! why should she think I would reproach her? Poor woman, she vastly\ndeceives herself.\"\n\n\"'See him yourself,' said she, 'and tell him to beware of M. Colbert.'\"\n\n\"What! she warned me to beware of her lover?\"\n\n\"I have told you she still loves you.\"\n\n\"Go on, marquise.\"\n\n\"'M. Colbert,' she added, 'came to me two hours ago, to inform me he was\nappointed intendant.'\"\n\n\"I have already told you, marquise, that M. Colbert would only be the\nmore in my power for that.\"\n\n\"Yes, but that is not all: Marguerite is intimate, as you know, with\nMadame d'Eymeris and Madame Lyodot.\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\n\"Well, M. Colbert put many questions to her, relative to the fortunes of\nthese two gentlemen, and as to the devotion they had for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, as to those two, I can answer for them; they must be killed before\nthey will cease to be mine.\"\n\n\"Then, as Madame Vanel was obliged to quit M. Colbert for an instant to\nreceive a visitor, and as M. Colbert is industrious, scarcely was the\nnew intendant left alone, before he took a pencil from his pocket, and,\nthere was paper on the table, began to make notes.\"\n\n\"Notes concerning d'Eymeris and Lyodot?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"I should like to know what those notes were about.\"\n\n\"And that is just what I have brought you.\"\n\n\"Madame Vanel has taken Colbert's notes and sent them to me?\"\n\n\"No; but by a chance which resembles a miracle, she has a duplicate of\nthose notes.\"\n\n\"How could she get that?\"\n\n\"Listen; I told you that Colbert found paper on the table.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That he took a pencil from his pocket.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And wrote upon that paper.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, this pencil was a lead-pencil, consequently hard; so, it marked\nin black upon the first sheet, and in white upon the second.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"Colbert, when tearing off the first sheet, took no notice of the\nsecond.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, on the second was to be read what had been written on the first;\nMadame Vanel read it, and sent for me.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Then, when she was assured I was your devoted friend, she gave me the\npaper, and told me the secret of this house.\"\n\n\"And this paper?\" said Fouquet, in some degree of agitation.\n\n\"Here it is, monsieur--read it,\" said the marquise.\n\nFouquet read:\n\n\"Names of the farmers of revenue to be condemned by the Chamber of\nJustice: D'Eymeris, friend of M. F.; Lyodot, friend of M. F.; De Vanin,\nindif.\"\n\n\"D'Eymeris and Lyodot!\" cried Fouquet, reading the paper eagerly again.\n\n\"Friends of M. F.,\" pointed the marquise with her finger.\n\n\"But what is the meaning of these words: 'To be condemned by the Chamber\nof Justice'?\"\n\n\"_Dame!_\" said the marquise, \"that is clear enough, I think. Besides,\nthat is not all. Read on, read on;\" and Fouquet continued,--\"The two\nfirst to death, the third to be dismissed, with MM. d'Hautemont and de\nla Vallette, who will only have their property confiscated.\"\n\n\"Great God!\" cried Fouquet, \"to death, to death! Lyodot and D'Eymeris.\nBut even if the Chamber of Justice should condemn them to death, the\nking will never ratify their condemnation, and they cannot be executed\nwithout the king's signature.\"\n\n\"The king has made M. Colbert intendant.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Fouquet, as if he caught a glimpse of the abyss that yawned\nbeneath his feet, \"impossible! impossible! But who passed a pencil over\nthe marks made by Colbert?\"\n\n\"I did. I was afraid the first would be effaced.\"\n\n\"Oh! I will know all.\"\n\n\"You will know nothing, monsieur; you despise your enemy too much for\nthat.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, my dear marquise; excuse me; yes, M. Colbert is my enemy, I\nbelieve him to be so; yes, M. Colbert is a man to be dreaded, I admit.\nBut I! I have time, and as you are here, as you have assured me of\nyour devotion, as you have allowed me to hope for your love, as we are\nalone--\"\n\n\"I came here to save you, Monsieur Fouquet, and not to ruin myself,\"\nsaid the marquise, rising--\"therefore, beware!--\"\n\n\"Marquise, in truth you terrify yourself too much at least, unless this\nterror is but a pretext--\"\n\n\"He is very deep, very deep; this M. Colbert: beware!\"\n\nFouquet, in his turn, drew himself up. \"And I?\" asked he.\n\n\"And you, you have only a noble heart. Beware! beware!\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"I have done what was right, my friend, at the risk of my reputation.\nAdieu!\"\n\n\"Not adieu, _au revoir!_\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said the marquise, giving her hand to Fouquet to kiss, and\nwalking towards the door with so firm a step, that he did not dare to\nbar her passage. As to Fouquet, he retook, with his head hanging down\nand a fixed cloud on his brow, the path of the subterranean passage\nalong which ran the metal wires that communicated from one house to\nthe other, transmitting, through two glasses, the wishes and signals of\nhidden correspondents.\n\n\n\nChapter LV. The Abbe Fouquet.\n\nFouquet hastened back to his apartment by the subterranean passage, and\nimmediately closed the mirror with the spring. He was scarcely in his\n well-known voice crying:--\"Open the door, monseigneur, I entreat you,\nopen the door!\" Fouquet quickly restored a little order to everything\nthat might have revealed either his absence or his agitation: he spread\nhis papers over the desk, took up a pen, and, to gain time, said,\nthrough the closed door,--\"Who is there?\"\n\n\"What, monseigneur, do you not know me?\" replied the voice.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Fouquet to himself, \"yes, my friend, I know you well\nenough.\" And then, aloud: \"Is it not Gourville?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, monseigneur.\"\n\nFouquet arose, cast a look at one of his glasses, went to the door,\npushed back the bolt, and Gourville entered. \"Ah! monseigneur!\nmonseigneur!\" cried he, \"what cruelty!\"\n\n\"In what?\"\n\n\"I have been a quarter of an hour imploring you to open the door, and\nyou would not even answer me.\"\n\n\"Once and for all, you know that I will not be disturbed when I am busy.\nNow, although I might make you an exception, Gourville, I insist upon my\norders being respected by others.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, at this moment, orders, doors, bolts, locks, and walls I\ncould have broken, forced and overthrown!\"\n\n\"Ah! ah! it relates to some great event, then?\" asked Fouquet.\n\n\"Oh! I assure you it does, monseigneur,\" replied Gourville.\n\n\"And what is this event?\" said Fouquet, a little troubled by the evident\nagitation of his most intimate confidant.\n\n\"There is a secret chamber of justice instituted, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"I know there is, but do the members meet, Gourville?\"\n\n\"They not only meet, but they have passed a sentence, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"A sentence?\" said the superintendent, with a shudder and pallor he\ncould not conceal. \"A sentence!--and on whom?\"\n\n\"Two of your best friends.\"\n\n\"Lyodot and D'Eymeris, do you mean? But what sort of a sentence?\"\n\n\"Sentence of death.\"\n\n\"Passed? Oh! you must be mistaken, Gourville; that is impossible.\"\n\n\"Here is a copy of the sentence which the king is to sign to-day, if he\nhas not already signed it.\"\n\nFouquet seized the paper eagerly, read it, and returned it to Gourville.\n\"The king will never sign that,\" said he.\n\nGourville shook his head.\n\n\"Monseigneur, M. Colbert is a bold councilor: do not be too confident!\"\n\n\"Monsieur Colbert again!\" cried Fouquet. \"How is it that that name rises\nupon all occasions to torment my ears, during the last two or three\ndays? You make so trifling a subject of too much importance, Gourville.\nLet M. Colbert appear, I will face him; let him raise his head, I will\ncrush him; but you understand, there must be an outline upon which\nmy look may fall, there must be a surface upon which my feet may be\nplaced.\"\n\n\"Patience, monseigneur; for you do not know what Colbert is--study him\nquickly; it is with this dark financier as it is with meteors, which the\neye never sees completely before their disastrous invasion; when we feel\nthem we are dead.\"\n\n\"Oh! Gourville, this is going too far,\" replied Fouquet, smiling; \"allow\nme, my friend, not to be so easily frightened; M. Colbert a meteor!\n_Corbleu_, we confront the meteor. Let us see acts, and not words. What\nhas he done?\"\n\n\"He has ordered two gibbets of the executioner of Paris,\" answered\nGourville.\n\nFouquet raised his head, and a flash gleamed from his eyes. \"Are you\nsure of what you say?\" cried he.\n\n\"Here is the proof, monseigneur.\" And Gourville held out to the\nsuperintendent a note communicated by a certain secretary of the Hotel\nde Ville, who was one of Fouquet's creatures.\n\n\"Yes, that is true,\" murmured the minister; \"the scaffold may be\nprepared, but the king has not signed; Gourville, the king will not\nsign.\"\n\n\"I shall soon know,\" said Gourville.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"If the king has signed, the gibbets will be sent this evening to the\nHotel de Ville, in order to be got up and ready by to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, no!\" cried the superintendent, once again; \"you are all\ndeceived, and deceive me in my turn; Lyodot came to see me only the\nday before yesterday; only three days ago I received a present of some\nSyracuse wine from poor D'Eymeris.\"\n\n\"What does that prove?\" replied Gourville, \"except that the chamber of\njustice has been secretly assembled, has deliberated in the absence of\nthe accused, and that the whole proceeding was complete when they were\narrested.\"\n\n\"What! are they, then, arrested?\"\n\n\"No doubt they are.\"\n\n\"But where, when, and how have they been arrested?\"\n\n\"Lyodot, yesterday at daybreak; D'Eymeris, the day before yesterday, in\nthe evening, as he was returning from the house of his mistress; their\ndisappearances had disturbed nobody; but at length M. Colbert all at\nonce raised the mask, and caused the affair to be published; it is\nbeing cried by sound of trumpet, at this moment in Paris, and, in truth,\nmonseigneur, there is scarcely anybody but yourself ignorant of the\nevent.\"\n\nFouquet began to walk about in his chamber with an uneasiness that\nbecame more and more serious.\n\n\"What do you decide upon, monseigneur?\" said Gourville.\n\n\"If it were really as easy as you say, I would go to the king,\" cried\nFouquet. \"But as I go to the Louvre, I will pass by the Hotel de Ville.\nWe shall see if the sentence is signed.\"\n\n\"Incredulity! thou art the pest of all great minds,\" said Gourville,\nshrugging his shoulders.\n\n\"Gourville!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" continued he, \"and incredulity! thou ruinest, as contagion\ndestroys the most robust health; that is to say, in an instant.\"\n\n\"Let us go,\" cried Fouquet; \"desire the door to be opened, Gourville.\"\n\n\"Be cautious,\" said the latter, \"the Abbe Fouquet is there.\"\n\n\"Ah! my brother,\" replied Fouquet, in a tone of annoyance; \"he is there,\nis he? he knows all the ill news, then, and is rejoiced to bring it to\nme, as usual. The devil! if my brother is there, my affairs are bad,\nGourville; why did you not tell me that sooner: I should have been the\nmore readily convinced.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur calumniates him,\" said Gourville, laughing; \"if he is come,\nit is not with a bad intention.\"\n\n\"What, do you excuse him?\" cried Fouquet; \"a fellow without a heart,\nwithout ideas; a devourer of wealth.\"\n\n\"He knows you are rich.\"\n\n\"And would ruin me.\"\n\n\"No, but he would have your purse. That is all.\"\n\n\"Enough! enough! A hundred thousand crowns per month, during two\nyears. _Corbleu!_ it is I that pay, Gourville, and I know my figures.\"\nGourville laughed in a silent, sly manner. \"Yes, yes, you mean to say\nit is the king pays,\" said the superintendent. \"Ah, Gourville, that is a\nvile joke; this is not the place.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, do not be angry.\"\n\n\"Well, then, send away the Abbe Fouquet; I have not a sou.\" Gourville\nmade a step towards the door. \"He has been a month without seeing me,\"\ncontinued Fouquet, \"why could he not be _two_ months?\"\n\n\"Because he repents of living in bad company,\" said Gourville, \"and\nprefers you to all his bandits.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the preference! You make a strange advocate, Gourville,\nto-day--the advocate of the Abbe Fouquet!\"\n\n\"Eh! but everything and every man has a good side--their useful side,\nmonseigneur.\"\n\n\"The bandits whom the abbe keeps in pay and drink have their useful\nside, have they? Prove that, if you please.\"\n\n\"Let the circumstance arise, monseigneur, and you will be very glad to\nhave these bandits under your hand.\"\n\n\"You advise me, then, to be reconciled to the abbe?\" said Fouquet,\nironically.\n\n\"I advise you, monseigneur, not to quarrel with a hundred or a hundred\nand twenty loose fellows, who, by putting their rapiers end to end,\nwould form a cordon of steel capable of surrounding three thousand men.\"\n\nFouquet darted a searching glance at Gourville, and passing before\nhim,--\"That is all very well; let M. l'Abbe Fouquet be introduced,\" said\nhe to the footman. \"You are right, Gourville.\"\n\nTwo minutes after, the Abbe Fouquet appeared in the doorway, with\nprofound reverence. He was a man of from forty to forty-five years of\nage, half churchman, half soldier,--a _spadassin_ grafted upon an abbe;\nupon seeing that he had not a sword by his side, you might be sure\nhe had pistols. Fouquet saluted him more as elder brother than as a\nminister.\n\n\"What can I do to serve you, monsieur l'abbe?\" said he.\n\n\"Oh! oh! how coldly you speak to me, brother!\"\n\n\"I speak like a man who is in a hurry, monsieur.\"\n\nThe abbe looked maliciously at Gourville, and anxiously at Fouquet, and\nsaid, \"I have three hundred pistoles to pay to M. de Bregi this evening.\nA play debt, a sacred debt.\"\n\n\"What next?\" said Fouquet bravely, for he comprehended that the Abbe\nFouquet would not have disturbed him for such a want.\n\n\"A thousand to my butcher, who will supply no more meat.\"\n\n\"Next?\"\n\n\"Twelve hundred to my tailor,\" continued the abbe; \"the fellow has made\nme take back seven suits of my people's, which compromises my liveries,\nand my mistress talks of replacing me by a farmer of the revenue, which\nwould be a humiliation for the church.\"\n\n\"What else?\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"You will please to remark,\" said the abbe, humbly, \"that I have asked\nnothing for myself.\"\n\n\"That is delicate, monsieur,\" replied Fouquet; \"so, as you see, I wait.\"\n\n\"And I ask nothing, oh! no,--it is not for want of need, though, I\nassure you.\"\n\nThe minister reflected for a minute. \"Twelve hundred pistoles to the\ntailor; that seems a great deal for clothes,\" said he.\n\n\"I maintain a hundred men,\" said the abbe, proudly; \"that is a charge, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"Why a hundred men?\" said Fouquet. \"Are you a Richelieu or a Mazarin,\nto require a hundred men as a guard? What use do you make of these\nmen?--speak.\"\n\n\"And do you ask me that?\" cried the Abbe Fouquet; \"ah! how can you put\nsuch a question,--why I maintain a hundred men? Ah!\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I do put that question to you. What have you to do with a\nhundred men?--answer.\"\n\n\"Ingrate!\" continued the abbe, more and more affected.\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"Why, monsieur the superintendent, I only want one _valet de chambre_,\nfor _my_ part, and even if I were alone, could help myself very well;\nbut you, you who have so many enemies--a hundred men are not enough for\nme to defend you with. A hundred men!--you ought to have ten thousand. I\nmaintain, then, these men in order that in public places, in assemblies,\nno voice may be raised against you; and without them, monsieur, you\nwould be loaded with imprecations, you would be torn to pieces, you\nwould not last a week; no, not a week, do you understand?\"\n\n\"Ah! I did not know you were my champion to such an extent, monsieur le\nabbe.\"\n\n\"You doubt it!\" cried the abbe. \"Listen, then, to what happened,\nno longer ago than yesterday, in the Rue de la Hochette. A man was\ncheapening a fowl.\"\n\n\"Well, how could that injure me, abbe?\"\n\n\"This way. The fowl was not fat. The purchaser refused to give eighteen\nsous for it, saying that he could not afford eighteen sous for the skin\nof a fowl from which M. Fouquet had sucked all the fat.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"The joke caused a deal of laughter,\" continued the abbe; \"laughter at\nyour expense, death to the devils! and the _canaille_ were delighted.\nThe joker added, 'Give me a fowl fed by M. Colbert, if you like! and I\nwill pay all you ask.' And immediately there was a clapping of hands. A\nfrightful scandal! you understand; a scandal which forces a brother to\nhide his face.\"\n\nFouquet colored. \"And you veiled it?\" said the superintendent.\n\n\"No, for so it happened I had one of my men in the crowd; a new recruit\nfrom the provinces, one M. Menneville, whom I like very much. He\nmade his way through the press, saying to the joker: '_Mille barbes!_\nMonsieur the false joker, here's a thrust for Colbert!' 'And one for\nFouquet,' replied the joker. Upon which they drew in front of the\ncook's shop, with a hedge of the curious round them, and five hundred as\ncurious at the windows.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"Well, monsieur, my Menneville spitted the joker, to the great\nastonishment of the spectators, and said to the cook:--'Take this goose,\nmy friend, for it is fatter than your fowl.' That is the way, monsieur,\"\nended the abbe, triumphantly, \"in which I spend my revenues; I maintain\nthe honor of the family, monsieur.\" Fouquet hung his head. \"And I have a\nhundred as good as he,\" continued the abbe.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Fouquet, \"give the account to Gourville, and remain\nhere this evening.\"\n\n\"Shall we have supper?\"\n\n\"Yes, there will be supper.\"\n\n\"But the chest is closed.\"\n\n\"Gourville will open it for you. Leave us, monsieur l'abbe, leave us.\"\n\n\"Then we are friends?\" said the abbe, with a bow.\n\n\"Oh, yes, friends. Come, Gourville.\"\n\n\"Are you going out? You will not stay to supper, then?\"\n\n\"I shall be back in an hour; rest easy, abbe.\" Then aside to\nGourville,--\"Let them put to my English horses,\" said he, \"and direct\nthe coachman to stop at the Hotel de Ville de Paris.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LVI. M. de la Fontaine's Wine.\n\nCarriages were already bringing the guests of Fouquet to Saint-Mande;\nalready the whole house was getting warm with the preparations for\nsupper, when the superintendent launched his fleet horses upon the roads\nto Paris, and going by the quays, in order to meet fewer people on the\nway, soon reached the Hotel de Ville. It wanted a quarter to eight.\nFouquet alighted at the corner of the Rue de Long-Pont, and, on\nfoot, directed his course towards the Place de Greve, accompanied by\nGourville. At the turning of the Place they saw a man dressed in black\nand violet, of dignified mien, who was preparing to stop at Vincennes.\nHe had before him a large hamper filled with bottles, which he had just\npurchased at the _cabaret_ with the sign of \"L'Image-de-Notre-Dame.\"\n\n\"Eh, but! that is Vatel! my _maitre d'hotel!_\" said Fouquet to\nGourville.\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur,\" replied the latter.\n\n\"What can he have been doing at the sign of L'Image-de-Notre-Dame?\"\n\n\"Buying wine, no doubt.\"\n\n\"What! buy wine for me, at a _cabaret?_\" said Fouquet. \"My cellar, then,\nmust be in a miserable condition!\" and he advanced towards the _maitre\nd'hotel_, who was arranging his bottles in the carriage with the most\nminute care.\n\n\"_Hola!_ Vatel,\" said he, in the voice of a master.\n\n\"Take care, monseigneur!\" said Gourville, \"you will be recognized.\"\n\n\"Very well! Of what consequence?--Vatel!\"\n\nThe man dressed in black and violet turned round. He had a good and\nmild countenance, without expression--a mathematician minus the pride. A\ncertain fire sparkled in the eyes of this personage, a rather sly smile\nplayed round his lips; but the observer might soon have remarked that\nthis fire and this smile applied to nothing, enlightened nothing. Vatel\nlaughed like an absent man, and amused himself like a child. At\nthe sound of his master's voice he turned round, exclaiming: \"Oh!\nmonseigneur!\"\n\n\"Yes, it is I. What the devil are you doing here, Vatel? Wine! You are\nbuying wine at a _cabaret_ in the Place de Greve!\"\n\n\"But, monseigneur,\" said Vatel, quietly after having darted a hostile\nglance at Gourville, \"why am I interfered with here? Is my cellar kept\nin bad order?\"\n\n\"No, certes, Vatel, no; but--\"\n\n\"But what?\" replied Vatel. Gourville touched Fouquet's elbow.\n\n\"Don't be angry, Vatel; I thought my cellar--your cellar--sufficiently\nwell stocked for us to be able to dispense with recourse to the cellar\nof L'Image-de-Notre-Dame.\"\n\n\"Eh, monsieur,\" said Vatel, shrinking from monseigneur to monsieur with\na degree of disdain: \"your cellar is so well stocked that when certain\nof your guests dine with you they have nothing to drink.\"\n\nFouquet, in great surprise, looked at Gourville. \"What do you mean by\nthat?\"\n\n\"I mean that your butler had not wine for all tastes, monsieur; and that\nM. de la Fontaine, M. Pelisson, and M. Conrart, do not drink when they\ncome to the house--these gentlemen do not like strong wine. What is to\nbe done, then?\"\n\n\"Well, and therefore?\"\n\n\"Well, then, I have found here a _vin de Joigny_, which they like. I\nknow they come here once a week to drink at the Image-de-Notre-Dame.\nThat is the reason I am making this provision.\"\n\nFouquet had no more to say; he was convinced. Vatel, on his part, had\nmuch more to say, without doubt, and it was plain he was getting warm.\n\"It is just as if you would reproach me, monseigneur, for going to the\nRue Planche Milbray, to fetch, myself, the cider M. Loret drinks when he\ncomes to dine at your house.\"\n\n\"Loret drinks cider at my house!\" cried Fouquet, laughing.\n\n\"Certainly he does, monsieur, and that is the reason why he dines there\nwith pleasure.\"\n\n\"Vatel,\" cried Fouquet, pressing the hand of his _maitre d'hotel_, \"you\nare a man! I thank you, Vatel, for having understood that at my house\nM. de la Fontaine, M. Conrart, and M. Loret are as great as dukes and\npeers, as great as princes, greater than myself. Vatel, you are a good\nservant, and I double your salary.\"\n\nVatel did not even thank his master, he merely shrugged his shoulders a\nlittle, murmuring this superb sentiment: \"To be thanked for having done\none's duty is humiliating.\"\n\n\"He is right,\" said Gourville, as he drew Fouquet's attention, by a\ngesture, to another point. He showed him a low-built tumbrel, drawn by\ntwo horses, upon which rocked two strong gibbets, bound together,\nback to back, by chains, whilst an archer, seated upon the cross-beam,\nsuffered, as well as he could, with his head cast down, the comments\nof a hundred vagabonds, who guessed the destination of the gibbets,\nand were escorting them to the Hotel de Ville. Fouquet started. \"It is\ndecided, you see,\" said Gourville.\n\n\"But it is not done,\" replied Fouquet.\n\n\"Oh, do not flatter yourself, monseigneur; if they have thus lulled your\nfriendship and suspicions--if things have gone so far, you will be able\nto undo nothing.\"\n\n\"But I have not given my sanction.\"\n\n\"M. de Lyonne has ratified for you.\"\n\n\"I will go to the Louvre.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, you will not.\"\n\n\"Would you advise such baseness?\" cried Fouquet, \"would you advise me to\nabandon my friends? would you advise me, whilst able to fight, to throw\nthe arms I hold in my hand to the ground?\"\n\n\"I do not advise you to do anything of the kind, monseigneur. Are you in\na position to quit the post of superintendent at this moment?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, if the king wishes to displace you--\"\n\n\"He will displace me absent as well as present.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you will not have insulted him.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I shall have been base; now I am not willing that my friends\nshould die; and they shall _not_ die!\"\n\n\"For that it is necessary you should go to the Louvre, is it not?\"\n\n\"Gourville!\"\n\n\"Beware! once at the Louvre, you will be forced to defend your friends\nopenly, that is to say, to make a profession of faith; or you will be\nforced to abandon them irrevocably.\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"Pardon me;--the king will propose the alternative to you, rigorously,\nor else you will propose it to him yourself.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"That is the reason why conflict must be avoided. Let us return to\nSaint-Mande, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Gourville, I will not stir from this place, where the crime is to be\ncarried out, where my disgrace is to be accomplished; I will not stir, I\nsay, till I have found some means of combating my enemies.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" replied Gourville, \"you would excite my pity, if I did\nnot know you for one of the great spirits of this world. You possess a\nhundred and fifty millions, you are equal to the king in position, and\na hundred and fifty millions his superior in money. M. Colbert has not\neven had the wit to have the will of Mazarin accepted. Now, when a man\nis the richest person in a kingdom, and will take the trouble to spend\nthe money, if things are done he does not like, it is because he is a\npoor man. Let us return to Saint-Mande, I say.\"\n\n\"To consult with Pelisson?--we will.\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur, to count your money.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Fouquet, with angry eyes;--\"yes, yes, to Saint-Mande!\"\nHe got into his carriage again, and Gourville with him. Upon their\nroad, at the end of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, they overtook the humble\nequipage of Vatel, who was quietly conveying home his _vin de Joigny_.\nThe black horses, going at a swift pace, alarmed, as they passed, the\ntimid hack of the _maitre d'hotel_, who, putting his head out at the\nwindow, cried, in a fright, \"Take care of my bottles!\" [2]\n\n\n\nChapter LVII. The Gallery of Saint-Mande.\n\nFifty persons were waiting for the superintendent. He did not even take\nthe time to place himself in the hands of his _valet de chambre_ for a\nminute, but from the _perron_ went straight into the _premier salon_.\nThere his friends were assembled in full chat. The intendant was about\nto order supper to be served, but, above all, the Abbe Fouquet watched\nfor the return of his brother, and was endeavoring to do the honors\nof the house in his absence. Upon the arrival of the superintendent, a\nmurmur of joy and affection was heard; Fouquet, full of affability, good\nhumor, and munificence, was beloved by his poets, his artists, and his\nmen of business. His brow, upon which his little court read, as upon\nthat of a god, all the movements of his soul, and thence drew rules\nof conduct,--his brow, upon which affairs of state never impressed a\nwrinkle, was this evening paler than usual, and more than one friendly\neye remarked that pallor. Fouquet placed himself at the head of the\ntable, and presided gayly during supper. He recounted Vatel's expedition\nto La Fontaine, he related the history of Menneville and the skinny fowl\nto Pelisson, in such a manner that all the table heard it. A tempest of\nlaughter and jokes ensued, which was only checked by a serious and\neven sad gesture from Pelisson. The Abbe Fouquet, not being able to\ncomprehend why his brother should have led the conversation in that\ndirection, listened with all his ears, and sought in the countenance\nof Gourville, or in that of his brother, an explanation which nothing\nafforded him. Pelisson took up the matter:--\"Did they mention M.\nColbert, then?\" said he.\n\n\"Why not?\" replied Fouquet; \"if true, as it is said to be, that the king\nhas made him his intendant?\" Scarcely had Fouquet uttered these words,\nwith a marked intention, than an explosion broke forth among the guests.\n\n\"The miser!\" said one.\n\n\"The mean, pitiful fellow!\" said another.\n\n\"The hypocrite!\" said a third.\n\nPelisson exchanged a meaning look with Fouquet. \"Messieurs,\" said\nhe, \"in truth we are abusing a man whom no one knows: it is neither\ncharitable nor reasonable; and here is monsieur le surintendant, who, I\nam sure, agrees with me.\"\n\n\"Entirely,\" replied Fouquet. \"Let the fat fowls of M. Colbert alone; our\nbusiness to-day is with the _faisans truffes_ of M. Vatel.\" This speech\nstopped the dark cloud which was beginning to throw its shade over the\nguests. Gourville succeeded so well in animating the poets with the _vin\nde Joigny_; the abbe, intelligent as a man who stands in need of his\nhost's money, so enlivened the financiers and the men of the sword,\nthat, amidst the vapors of this joy and the noise of conversation,\ninquietudes disappeared completely. The will of Cardinal Mazarin was the\ntext of the conversation at the second course and dessert; then Fouquet\nordered bowls of sweetmeats and fountains of liquor to be carried into\nthe _salon_ adjoining the gallery. He led the way thither, conducting\nby the hand a lady, the queen, by his preference, of the evening. The\nmusicians then supped, and the promenades in the gallery and the gardens\ncommenced, beneath a spring sky, mild and flower-scented. Pelisson\nthen approached the superintendent, and said: \"Something troubles\nmonseigneur?\"\n\n\"Greatly,\" replied the minister; \"ask Gourville to tell you what it is.\"\nPelisson, on turning round, found La Fontaine treading upon his heels.\nHe was obliged to listen to a Latin verse, which the poet had composed\nupon Vatel. La Fontaine had, for an hour, been scanning this verse in\nall corners, seeking some one to pour it out upon advantageously. He\nthought he had caught Pelisson, but the latter escaped him; he turned\ntowards Sorel, who had, himself, just composed a _quatrain_ in honor of\nthe supper, and the _Amphytrion_. La Fontaine in vain endeavored to\ngain attention to his verses; Sorel wanted to obtain a hearing for his\n_quatrain_. He was obliged to retreat before M. le Comte de Charost,\nwhose arm Fouquet had just taken. L'Abbe Fouquet perceived that the\npoet, absent-minded, as usual, was about to follow the two talkers; and\nhe interposed. La Fontaine seized upon him, and recited his verses. The\nabbe, who was quite innocent of Latin, nodded his head, in cadence, at\nevery roll which La Fontaine impressed upon his body, according to the\nundulations of the dactyls and spondees. While this was going on,\nbehind the confiture-basins, Fouquet related the event of the day to his\nson-in-law, M. de Charost. \"We will send the idle and useless to look at\nthe fireworks,\" said Pelisson to Gourville, \"whilst we converse here.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Gourville, addressing four words to Vatel. The latter\nthen led towards the gardens the major part of the beaux, the ladies and\nthe chatterers, whilst the men walked in the gallery, lighted by three\nhundred wax-lights, in the sight of all; the admirers of fireworks all\nran away towards the garden. Gourville approached Fouquet, and said:\n\"Monsieur, we are here.\"\n\n\"All?\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"Yes,--count.\" The superintendent counted; there were eight persons.\nPelisson and Gourville walked arm in arm, as if conversing upon vague\nand frivolous subjects. Sorel and two officers imitated them, and in an\nopposite direction. The Abbe Fouquet walked alone. Fouquet, with M.\nde Charost, walked as if entirely absorbed in the conversation of his\nson-in-law. \"Messieurs,\" said he, \"let no one of you raise his head as\nhe walks, or appear to pay attention to me; continue walking, we are\nalone, listen to me.\"\n\nA perfect silence ensued, disturbed only by the distant cries of the\njoyous guests, from the groves whence they beheld the fireworks. It was\na whimsical spectacle this, of these men walking in groups, as if each\none was occupied about something, whilst lending attention really only\nto one amongst them, who, himself, seemed to be speaking only to his\ncompanion. \"Messieurs,\" said Fouquet, \"you have, without doubt, remarked\nthe absence of two of my friends this evening, who were with us on\nWednesday. For God's sake, abbe, do not stop,--it is not necessary to\nenable you to listen; walk on, carrying your head in a natural way, and\nas you have excellent sight, place yourself at the window, and if any\none returns towards the gallery, give us notice by coughing.\"\n\nThe abbe obeyed.\n\n\"I have not observed their absence,\" said Pelisson, who, at this moment,\nwas turning his back to Fouquet, and walking the other way.\n\n\"I do not see M. Lyodot,\" said Sorel, \"who pays me my pension.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said the abbe, at the window, \"do not see M. d'Eymeris, who\nowes me eleven hundred livres from our last game of brelan.\"\n\n\"Sorel,\" continued Fouquet, walking bent, and gloomily, \"you will never\nreceive your pension any more from M. Lyodot; and you, abbe, will never\nbe paid you eleven hundred livres by M. d'Eymeris; for both are doomed\nto die.\"\n\n\"To die!\" exclaimed the whole assembly, arrested, in spite of\nthemselves, in the comedy they were playing, by that terrible word.\n\n\"Recover yourselves, messieurs,\" said Fouquet, \"for perhaps we are\nwatched--I said: to die!\"\n\n\"To die!\" repeated Pelisson; \"what, the men I saw six days ago, full\nof health, gayety, and the spirit of the future! What then is man, good\nGod! that disease should thus bring him down all at once!\"\n\n\"It is not a disease,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"Then there is a remedy,\" said Sorel.\n\n\"No remedy. Messieurs de Lyodot and D'Eymeris are on the eve of their\nlast day.\"\n\n\"Of what are these gentlemen dying, then?\" asked an officer.\n\n\"Ask of him who kills them,\" replied Fouquet.\n\n\"Who kills them? Are they being killed, then?\" cried the terrified\nchorus.\n\n\"They do better still; the are hanging them,\" murmured Fouquet, in a\nsinister voice, which sounded like a funeral knell in that rich gallery,\nsplendid with pictures, flowers, velvet, and gold. Involuntarily\nevery one stopped; the abbe quitted his window; the first fuses of\nthe fireworks began to mount above the trees. A prolonged cry from the\ngardens attracted the superintendent to enjoy the spectacle. He\ndrew near to a window, and his friends placed themselves behind him,\nattentive to his least wish.\n\n\"Messieurs,\" said he, \"M. Colbert has caused to be arrested, tried and\nwill execute my two friends; what does it become me to do?\"\n\n\"_Mordieu!_\" exclaimed the abbe, the first one to speak, \"run M. Colbert\nthrough the body.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said Pelisson, \"you must speak to his majesty.\"\n\n\"The king, my dear Pelisson, himself signed the order for the\nexecution.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said the Comte de Charost, \"the execution must not take place,\nthen; that is all.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" said Gourville, \"unless we could corrupt the jailers.\"\n\n\"Or the governor,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"This night the prisoners might be allowed to escape.\"\n\n\"Which of you will take charge of the transaction?\"\n\n\"I,\" said the abbe, \"will carry the money.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Pelisson, \"will be the bearer of the words.\"\n\n\"Words and money,\" said Fouquet, \"five hundred thousand livres to the\ngovernor of the _conciergerie_ that is sufficient; nevertheless, it\nshall be a million, if necessary.\"\n\n\"A million!\" cried the abbe; \"why, for less than half, I would have half\nParis sacked.\"\n\n\"There must be no disorder,\" said Pelisson. \"The governor being gained,\nthe two prisoners escape; once clear of the fangs of the law, they will\ncall together the enemies of Colbert, and prove to the king that his\nyoung justice, like all other monstrosities, is not infallible.\"\n\n\"Go to Paris, then, Pelisson,\" said Fouquet, \"and bring hither the two\nvictims; to-morrow we shall see.\"\n\nGourville gave Pelisson the five hundred thousand livres. \"Take care the\nwind does not carry you away,\" said the abbe; \"what a responsibility.\n_Peste!_ Let me help you a little.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" said Fouquet, \"somebody is coming. Ah! the fireworks are\nproducing a magical effect.\" At this moment a shower of sparks fell\nrustling among the branches of the neighboring trees. Pelisson and\nGourville went out together by the door of the gallery; Fouquet\ndescended to the garden with the five last plotters.\n\n\n\nChapter LVIII. Epicureans.\n\nAs Fouquet was giving, or appearing to give, all his attention to\nthe brilliant illuminations, the languishing music of the violins\nand hautboys, the sparkling sheaves of the artificial fires, which,\ninflaming the heavens with glowing reflections, marked behind the\ntrees the dark profile of the donjon of Vincennes; as, we say, the\nsuperintendent was smiling on the ladies and the poets, the _fete_ was\nevery whit as gay as usual; and Vatel, whose restless, even jealous\nlook, earnestly consulted the aspect of Fouquet, did not appear\ndissatisfied with the welcome given to the ordering of the evening's\nentertainment. The fireworks over, the company dispersed about the\ngardens and beneath the marble porticoes with the delightful liberty\nwhich reveals in the master of the house so much forgetfulness\nof greatness, so much courteous hospitality, so much magnificent\ncarelessness. The poets wandered about, arm in arm, through the groves;\nsome reclined upon beds of moss, to the great damage of velvet clothes\nand curled heads, into which little dried leaves and blades of grass\ninsinuated themselves. The ladies, in small numbers, listened to the\nsongs of the singers and the verses of the poets; others listened to the\nprose, spoken with much art, by men who were neither actors nor poets,\nbut to whom youth and solitude gave an unaccustomed eloquence, which\nappeared to them better than everything else in the world. \"Why,\" said\nLa Fontaine, \"does not our master Epicurus descend into the garden?\nEpicurus never abandoned his pupils; the master is wrong.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Conrart, \"you yourself are in the wrong persisting in\ndecorating yourself with the name of an Epicurean; indeed, nothing here\nreminds me of the doctrine of the philosopher of Gargetta.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said La Fontaine, \"is it not written that Epicurus purchased a\nlarge garden and lived in it tranquilly with his friends?\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"Well, has not M. Fouquet purchased a large garden at Saint-Mande, and\ndo we not live here very tranquilly with him and his friends?\"\n\n\"Yes, without doubt; unfortunately it is neither the garden nor the\nfriends which constitute the resemblance. Now, what likeness is there\nbetween the doctrine of Epicurus and that of M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"This--pleasure gives happiness.\"\n\n\"Next?\"\n\n\"Well, I do not think we ought to consider ourselves unfortunate, for\nmy part, at least. A good repast--_vin de Joigny_, which they have the\ndelicacy to go and fetch for me from my favorite _cabaret_--not one\nimpertinence heard during a supper an hour long, in spite of the\npresence of ten millionaires and twenty poets.\"\n\n\"I stop you there. You mentioned _vin de Joigny_, and a good repast; do\nyou persist in that?\"\n\n\"I persist,--_anteco_, as they say at Port Royal.\"\n\n\"Then please to recollect that the great Epicurus lived, and made his\npupils live, upon bread, vegetables, and water.\"\n\n\"That is not certain,\" said La Fontaine; \"and you appear to me to be\nconfounding Epicurus with Pythagoras, my dear Conrart.\"\n\n\"Remember, likewise, that the ancient philosopher was rather a bad\nfriend of the gods and the magistrates.\"\n\n\"Oh! that is what I will not admit,\" replied La Fontaine. \"Epicurus was\nlike M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"Do not compare him to monsieur le surintendant,\" said Conrart, in an\nagitated voice, \"or you would accredit the reports which are circulating\nconcerning him and us.\"\n\n\"What reports?\"\n\n\"That we are bad Frenchmen, lukewarm with regard to the king, deaf to\nthe law.\"\n\n\"I return, then, to my text,\" said La Fontaine. \"Listen, Conrart, this\nis the morality of Epicurus, whom, besides, I consider, if I must tell\nyou so, as a myth. Antiquity is mostly mythical. Jupiter, if we give\na little attention to it, is life. Alcides is strength. The words are\nthere to bear me out; Zeus, that is, _zen_, to live. Alcides, that\nis, _alce_, vigor. Well, Epicurus, that is mild watchfulness, that\nis protection; now who watches better over the state, or who protects\nindividuals better than M. Fouquet does?\"\n\n\"You talk etymology and not morality; I say that we modern Epicureans\nare indifferent citizens.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried La Fontaine, \"if we become bad citizens, it is not through\nfollowing the maxims of our master. Listen to one of his principal\naphorisms.\"\n\n\"I--will.\"\n\n\"Pray for good leaders.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well! what does M. Fouquet say to us every day? 'When shall we be\ngoverned?' Does he say so? Come, Conrart, be frank.\"\n\n\"He says so, that is true.\"\n\n\"Well, that is a doctrine of Epicurus.\"\n\n\"Yes; but that is a little seditious, observe.\"\n\n\"What! seditious to wish to be governed by good heads or leaders?\"\n\n\"Certainly, when those who govern are bad.\"\n\n\"Patience, I have a reply for all.\"\n\n\"Even for what I have just said to you?\"\n\n\"Listen! would you submit to those who govern ill? Oh! it is written:\n_Cacos politeuousi_. You grant me the text?\"\n\n\"_Pardieu!_ I think so. Do you know, you speak Greek as well as Aesop\ndid, my dear La Fontaine.\"\n\n\"Is there any wickedness in that, my dear Conrart?\"\n\n\"God forbid I should say so.\"\n\n\"Then let us return to M. Fouquet. What did he repeat to us all the day?\nWas it not this? 'What a _cuistre_ is that Mazarin! what an ass! what\na leech! We must, however, submit to that fellow.' Now, Conrart, did he\nsay so, or did he not?\"\n\n\"I confess that he said it, and even perhaps too often.\"\n\n\"Like Epicurus, my friend, still like Epicurus; I repeat, we are\nEpicureans, and that is very amusing.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I am afraid there will rise up, by the side of us, a sect like\nthat of Epictetus; you know him well; the philosopher of Hierapolis,\nhe who called bread luxury, vegetables prodigality, and clear water\ndrunkenness; he who, being beaten by his master, said to him, grumbling\na little it is true, but without being angry, 'I will lay a wager you\nhave broken my leg!'--and who won his wager.\"\n\n\"He was a goose, that fellow Epictetus.\"\n\n\"Granted, but he might easily become the fashion by only changing his\nname into that of Colbert.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" replied La Fontaine, \"that is impossible. Never will you find\nColbert in Epictetus.\"\n\n\"You are right, I shall find--_Coluber_ there, at the most.\"\n\n\"Ah! you are beaten, Conrart; you are reduced to a play upon words. M.\nArnaud pretends that I have no logic; I have more than M. Nicole.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Conrart, \"you have logic, but you are a Jansenist.\"\n\nThis peroration was hailed with a boisterous shout of laughter; by\ndegrees the promenaders had been attracted by the exclamations of the\ntwo disputants around the arbor under which they were arguing. The\ndiscussion had been religiously listened to, and Fouquet himself,\nscarcely able to suppress his laughter, had given an example of\nmoderation. But with the _denouement_ of the scene he threw off all\nrestraint, and laughed aloud. Everybody laughed as he did, and the two\nphilosophers were saluted with unanimous felicitations. La Fontaine,\nhowever, was declared conqueror, on account of his profound erudition\nand his irrefragable logic. Conrart obtained the compensation due to\nan unsuccessful combatant; he was praised for the loyalty of his\nintentions, and the purity of his conscience.\n\nAt the moment when this jollity was manifesting itself by the most\nlively demonstrations, when the ladies were reproaching the two\nadversaries with not having admitted women into the system of Epicurean\nhappiness, Gourville was seen hastening from the other end of the\ngarden, approaching Fouquet, and detaching him, by his presence alone,\nfrom the group. The superintendent preserved on his face the smile and\ncharacter of carelessness; but scarcely was he out of sight than he\nthrew off the mask.\n\n\"Well!\" said he, eagerly, \"where is Pelisson! What is he doing?\"\n\n\"Pelisson has returned from Paris.\"\n\n\"Has he brought back the prisoners?\"\n\n\"He has not even seen the _concierge_ of the prison.\"\n\n\"What! did he not tell him he came from me?\"\n\n\"He told him so, but the _concierge_ sent him this reply: 'If any one\ncame to me from M. Fouquet, he would have a letter from M. Fouquet.'\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried the latter, \"if a letter is all he wants--\"\n\n\"It is useless, monsieur!\" said Pelisson, showing himself at the corner\nof the little wood, \"useless! Go yourself, and speak in your own name.\"\n\n\"You are right. I will go in, as if to work; let the horses remain\nharnessed, Pelisson. Entertain my friends, Gourville.\"\n\n\"One last word of advice, monseigneur,\" replied the latter.\n\n\"Speak, Gourville.\"\n\n\"Do not go to the _concierge_ save at the last minute; it is brave, but\nit is not wise. Excuse me, Monsieur Pelisson, if I am not of the same\nopinion as you; but take my advice, monseigneur, send again a message to\nthis _concierge_,--he is a worthy man, but do not carry it yourself.\"\n\n\"I will think of it,\" said Fouquet; \"besides, we have all the night\nbefore us.\"\n\n\"Do not reckon too much on time; were the hours we have twice as many as\nthey are, they would not be too much,\" replied Pelisson; \"it is never a\nfault to arrive too soon.\"\n\n\"Adieu!\" said the superintendent; \"come with me, Pelisson. Gourville, I\ncommend my guests to your care.\" And he set off. The Epicureans did\nnot perceive that the head of the school had left them; the violins\ncontinued playing all night long.\n\n\n\nChapter LIX. A Quarter of an Hour's Delay.\n\nFouquet, on leaving his house for the second time that day, felt himself\nless heavy and less disturbed than might have been expected. He turned\ntowards Pelisson, who was meditating in the corner of the carriage some\ngood arguments against the violent proceedings of Colbert.\n\n\"My dear Pelisson,\" said Fouquet, \"it is a great pity you are not a\nwoman.\"\n\n\"I think, on the contrary, it is very fortunate,\" replied Pelisson,\n\"for, monseigneur, I am excessively ugly.\"\n\n\"Pelisson! Pelisson!\" said the superintendent, laughing: \"You repeat too\noften, you are 'ugly', not to leave people to believe that it gives you\nmuch pain.\"\n\n\"In fact it does, monseigneur, much pain; there is no man more\nunfortunate than I: I was handsome, the small-pox rendered me hideous;\nI am deprived of a great means of attraction; now, I am your principal\nclerk, or something of that sort; I take great interest in your affairs,\nand if, at this moment, I were a pretty woman, I could render you an\nimportant service.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I would go and find the _concierge_ of the Palais. I would seduce him,\nfor he is a gallant man, extravagantly partial to women; then I would\nget away our two prisoners.\"\n\n\"I hope to be able to do so myself, although I am not a pretty woman,\"\nreplied Fouquet.\n\n\"Granted, monseigneur; but you are compromising yourself very much.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Fouquet, suddenly, with one of those secret transports which\nthe generous blood of youth, or the remembrance of some sweet emotion,\ninfuses into the heart. \"Oh! I know a woman who will enact the personage\nwe stand in need of, with the lieutenant-governor of the _concierge_.\"\n\n\"And, on my part, I know fifty, monseigneur; fifty trumpets, which\nwill inform the universe of your generosity, of your devotion to your\nfriends, and, consequently, will ruin you sooner or later in ruining\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"I do not speak of such women, Pelisson; I speak of a noble and\nbeautiful creature who joins to the intelligence and wit of her sex the\nvalor and coolness of ours; I speak of a woman, handsome enough to make\nthe walls of a prison bow down to salute her, discreet enough to let no\none suspect by whom she has been sent.\"\n\n\"A treasure!\" said Pelisson; \"you would make a famous present to\nmonsieur the governor of the _concierge! Peste!_ monseigneur, he\nmight have his head cut off; but he would, before dying, have had such\nhappiness as no man had enjoyed before him.\"\n\n\"And I add,\" said Fouquet, \"that the _concierge_ of the Palais would not\nhave his head cut off, for he would receive of me my horses, to\neffect his escape, and five hundred thousand livres wherewith to live\ncomfortably in England: I add, that this lady, my friend, would give him\nnothing but the horses and the money. Let us go and seek her, Pelisson.\"\n\nThe superintendent reached forth his hand towards the golden and silken\ncord placed in the interior of his carriage, but Pelisson stopped him.\n\"Monseigneur,\" said he, \"you are going to lose as much time in seeking\nthis lady as Columbus took to discover the new world. Now, we have but\ntwo hours in which we can possibly succeed; the _concierge_ once gone to\nbed, how shall we get at him without making a disturbance? When daylight\ndawns, how can we conceal our proceedings? Go, go yourself, monseigneur,\nand do not seek either woman or angel to-night.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Pelisson, here we are before her door.\"\n\n\"What! before the angel's door?\"\n\n\"Why, yes.\"\n\n\"This is the hotel of Madame de Belliere!\"\n\n\"Hush!\"\n\n\"Ah! Good Lord!\" exclaimed Pelisson.\n\n\"What have you to say against her?\"\n\n\"Nothing, alas! and it is that which causes my despair. Nothing,\nabsolutely nothing. Why can I not, on the contrary, say ill enough of\nher to prevent your going to her?\"\n\nBut Fouquet had already given orders to stop, and the carriage was\nmotionless. \"Prevent me!\" cried Fouquet; \"why, no power on earth should\nprevent my going to pay my compliments to Madame de Plessis-Belliere;\nbesides, who knows that we shall not stand in need of her!\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur, no!\"\n\n\"But I do not wish you to wait for me, Pelisson,\" replied Fouquet,\nsincerely courteous.\n\n\"The more reason I should, monseigneur; knowing that you are keeping\nme waiting, you will, perhaps, stay a shorter time. Take care! You\nsee there is a carriage in the courtyard: she has some one with her.\"\nFouquet leaned towards the steps of the carriage. \"One word more,\" cried\nPelisson; \"do not go to this lady till you have been to the _concierge_,\nfor Heaven's sake!\"\n\n\"Eh! five minutes, Pelisson,\" replied Fouquet, alighting at the steps\nof the hotel, leaving Pelisson in the carriage, in a very ill-humor.\nFouquet ran upstairs, told his name to the footman, which excited an\neagerness and a respect that showed the habit the mistress of the house\nhad of honoring that name in her family. \"Monsieur le surintendant,\"\ncried the marquise, advancing, very pale, to meet him; \"what an honor!\nwhat an unexpected pleasure!\" said she. Then, in a low voice, \"Take\ncare!\" added the marquise, \"Marguerite Vanel is here!\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied Fouquet, rather agitated, \"I came on business. One\nsingle word, and quickly, if you please!\" And he entered the _salon_.\nMadame Vanel had risen, paler, more livid, than Envy herself. Fouquet\nin vain addressed her, with the most agreeable, most pacific salutation;\nshe only replied by a terrible glance darted at the marquise and\nFouquet. This keen glance of a jealous woman is a stiletto which pierces\nevery cuirass; Marguerite Vanel plunged it straight into the hearts of\nthe two confidants. She made a courtesy to _her friend_, a more profound\none to Fouquet, and took leave, under pretense of having a number of\nvisits to make, without the marquise trying to prevent her, or Fouquet,\na prey to anxiety, thinking further about her. She was scarcely out\nof the room, and Fouquet left alone with the marquise, before he threw\nhimself on his knees, without saying a word. \"I expected you,\" said the\nmarquise, with a tender sigh.\n\n\"Oh! no,\" cried he, \"or you would have sent away that woman.\"\n\n\"She has been here little more than half an hour, and I had no\nexpectation she would come this evening.\"\n\n\"You love me just a little, then, marquise?\"\n\n\"That is not the question now; it is of your danger; how are your\naffairs going on?\"\n\n\"I am going this evening to get my friends out of the prisons of the\nPalais.\"\n\n\"How will you do that?\"\n\n\"By buying and bribing the governor.\"\n\n\"He is a friend of mine; can I assist you, without injuring you?\"\n\n\"Oh! marquise, it would be a signal service; but how can you be employed\nwithout your being compromised? Now, never shall my life, my power, or\neven my liberty, be purchased at the expense of a single tear from your\neyes, or of one frown of pain upon your brow.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, no more such words, they bewilder me; I have been culpable\nin trying to serve you, without calculating the extent of what I was\ndoing. I love you in reality, as a tender friend; and as a friend, I am\ngrateful for your delicate attentions--but, alas!--alas! you will never\nfind a mistress in me.\"\n\n\"Marquise!\" cried Fouquet, in a tone of despair; \"why not?\"\n\n\"Because you are too much beloved,\" said the young woman, in a low\nvoice; \"because you are too much beloved by too many people--because\nthe splendor of glory and fortune wound my eyes, whilst the darkness\nof sorrow attracts them; because, in short, I, who have repulsed you in\nyour proud magnificence; I who scarcely looked at you in your splendor,\nI came, like a mad woman, to throw myself, as it were, into your arms,\nwhen I saw a misfortune hovering over your head. You understand me now,\nmonseigneur? Become happy again, that I may remain chaste in heart and\nin thought: your misfortune entails my ruin.\"\n\n\"Oh! madame,\" said Fouquet, with an emotion he had never before felt;\n\"were I to fall to the lowest degree of human misery, and hear from your\nmouth that word which you now refuse me, that day, madame, you will\nbe mistaken in your noble egotism; that day you will fancy you are\nconsoling the most unfortunate of men, and you will have said, _I love\nyou_, to the most illustrious, the most delighted, the most triumphant\nof the happy beings of this world.\"\n\nHe was still at her feet, kissing her hand, when Pelisson entered\nprecipitately, crying, in very ill-humor, \"Monseigneur! madame! for\nHeaven's sake! excuse me. Monseigneur, you have been here half an hour.\nOh! do not both look at me so reproachfully. Madame, pray who is that\nlady who left your house soon after monseigneur came in?\"\n\n\"Madame Vanel,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"Ha!\" cried Pelisson, \"I was sure of that.\"\n\n\"Well! what then?\"\n\n\"Why, she got into her carriage, looking deadly pale.\"\n\n\"What consequence is that to me?\"\n\n\"Yes, but what she said to her coachman is of consequence to you.\"\n\n\"Kind heaven!\" cried the marquise, \"what was that?\"\n\n\"To M. Colbert's!\" said Pelisson, in a hoarse voice.\n\n\"_Bon Dieu!_--begone, begone, monseigneur!\" replied the marquise,\npushing Fouquet out of the salon, whilst Pelisson dragged him by the\nhand.\n\n\"Am I, then, indeed,\" said the superintendent, \"become a child, to be\nfrightened by a shadow?\"\n\n\"You are a giant,\" said the marquise, \"whom a viper is trying to bite in\nthe heel.\"\n\nPelisson continued to drag Fouquet to the carriage. \"To the Palais at\nfull speed!\" cried Pelisson to the coachman. The horses set off like\nlightening; no obstacle relaxed their pace for an instant. Only, at the\narcade Saint-Jean, as they were coming out upon the Place de Greve, a\nlong file of horsemen, barring the narrow passage, stopped the carriage\nof the superintendent. There was no means of forcing this barrier; it\nwas necessary to wait till the mounted archers of the watch, for it was\nthey who stopped the way, had passed with the heavy carriage they\nwere escorting, and which ascended rapidly towards the Place Baudoyer.\nFouquet and Pelisson took no further account of this circumstance beyond\ndeploring the minute's delay they had thus to submit to. They entered\nthe habitation of the _concierge du Palais_ five minutes after. That\nofficer was still walking about in the front court. At the name\nof Fouquet, whispered in his ear by Pelisson, the governor eagerly\napproached the carriage, and, hat in hand, was profuse in his\nattentions. \"What an honor for me, monseigneur,\" said he.\n\n\"One word, monsieur le governeur, will you take the trouble to get into\nmy carriage?\" The officer placed himself opposite Fouquet in the coach.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Fouquet, \"I have a service to ask of you.\"\n\n\"Speak, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"A service that will be compromising for you, monsieur, but which will\nassure to you forever my protection and my friendship.\"\n\n\"Were it to cast myself into the fire for you, monseigneur, I would do\nit.\"\n\n\"That is well,\" said Fouquet; \"what I require is much more simple.\"\n\n\"That being so, monseigneur, what is it?\"\n\n\"To conduct me to the chamber of Messieurs Lyodot and D'Eymeris.\"\n\n\"Will monseigneur have the kindness to say for what purpose?\"\n\n\"I will tell you that in their presence, monsieur; at the same time that\nI will give you ample means of palliating this escape.\"\n\n\"Escape! Why, then, monseigneur does not know?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That Messieurs Lyodot and D'Eymeris are no longer here.\"\n\n\"Since when?\" cried Fouquet, in great agitation.\n\n\"About a quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"Whither have they gone, then?\"\n\n\"To Vincennes--to the donjon.\"\n\n\"Who took them from here?\"\n\n\"An order from the king.\"\n\n\"Oh! woe! woe!\" exclaimed Fouquet, striking his forehead. \"Woe!\" and\nwithout saying a single word more to the governor, he threw himself back\ninto his carriage, despair in his heart, and death on his countenance.\n\n\"Well!\" said Pelisson, with great anxiety.\n\n\"Our friends are lost. Colbert is conveying them to the donjon. They\ncrossed our path under the arcade Saint-Jean.\"\n\nPelisson, struck as by a thunderbolt, made no reply. With a single\nreproach he would have killed his master. \"Where is monseigneur going?\"\nsaid the footman.\n\n\"Home--to Paris. You, Pelisson, return to Saint-Mande, and bring the\nAbbe Fouquet to me within an hour. Begone!\"\n\n\n\nChapter LX. Plan of Battle.\n\nThe night was already far advanced when the Abbe Fouquet joined his\nbrother. Gourville had accompanied him. These three men, pale with dread\nof future events, resembled less three powers of the day than three\nconspirators, united by one single thought of violence. Fouquet walked\nfor a long time, with his eyes fixed upon the floor, striking his hands\none against the other. At length, taking courage, in the midst of a deep\nsigh: \"Abbe,\" said he, \"you were speaking to me only to-day of certain\npeople you maintain.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied the abbe.\n\n\"Tell me precisely who are these people.\" The abbe hesitated.\n\n\"Come! no fear, I am not threatening; no romancing, for I am not\njoking.\"\n\n\"Since you demand the truth, monseigneur, here it is:--I have a hundred\nand twenty friends or companions of pleasure, who are sworn to me as the\nthief is to the gallows.\"\n\n\"And you think you can depend on them?\"\n\n\"Entirely.\"\n\n\"And you will not compromise yourself?\"\n\n\"I will not even make my appearance.\"\n\n\"Are they men of resolution?\"\n\n\"They would burn Paris, if I promised them they should not be burnt in\nturn.\"\n\n\"The thing I ask of you, abbe,\" said Fouquet, wiping the sweat which\nfell from his brow, \"is to throw your hundred and twenty men upon\nthe people I will point out to you, at a certain moment given--is it\npossible?\"\n\n\"It will not be the first time such a thing has happened to them,\nmonseigneur.\"\n\n\"That is well: but would these bandits attack an armed force?\"\n\n\"They are used to that.\"\n\n\"Then get your hundred and twenty men together, abbe.\"\n\n\"Directly. But where?\"\n\n\"On the road to Vincennes, to-morrow, at two o'clock precisely.\"\n\n\"To carry off Lyodot and D'Eymeris? There will be blows to be got!\"\n\n\"A number, no doubt; are you afraid?\"\n\n\"Not for myself, but for you.\"\n\n\"Your men will know, then, what they have to do?\"\n\n\"They are too intelligent not to guess it. Now, a minister who gets up a\nriot against his king--exposes himself--\"\n\n\n\"Of what importance is that to you, I pray? Besides, if I fall, you fall\nwith me.\"\n\n\"It would then be more prudent, monsieur, not to stir in the affair, and\nleave the king to take this little satisfaction.\"\n\n\"Think well of this, abbe, Lyodot and D'Eymeris at Vincennes are a\nprelude of ruin for my house. I repeat it--I arrested, you will be\nimprisoned--I imprisoned, you will be exiled.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I am at your orders; have you any to give me?\"\n\n\"What I told you--I wish that, to-morrow, the two financiers of whom\nthey mean to make victims, whilst there remain so many criminals\nunpunished, should be snatched from the fury of my enemies. Take your\nmeasures accordingly. Is it possible?\"\n\n\"It is possible.\"\n\n\"Describe your plan.\"\n\n\"It is of rich simplicity. The ordinary guard at executions consists of\ntwelve archers.\"\n\n\"There will be a hundred to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I reckon so. I even say more--there will be two hundred.\"\n\n\"Then your hundred and twenty men will not be enough.\"\n\n\"Pardon me. In every crowd composed of a hundred thousand spectators,\nthere are ten thousand bandits or cut-purses--only they dare not take\nthe initiative.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"There will then be, to-morrow, on the Place de Greve, which I choose as\nmy battle-field, ten thousand auxiliaries to my hundred and twenty men.\nThe attack commenced by the latter, the others will finish it.\"\n\n\"That all appears feasible. But what will be done with regard to the\nprisoners upon the Place de Greve?\"\n\n\"This: they must be thrust into some house--that will make a siege\nnecessary to get them out again. And stop! here is another idea, more\nsublime still: certain houses have two issues--one upon the Place,\nand the other into the Rue de la Mortellerie, or la Vannerie, or\nla Tixeranderie. The prisoners entering by one door will go out at\nanother.\"\n\n\"Yes; but fix upon something positive.\"\n\n\"I am seeking to do so.\"\n\n\"And I,\" cried Fouquet, \"I have found it. Listen to what has occurred to\nme at this moment.\"\n\n\"I am listening.\"\n\nFouquet made a sign to Gourville, who appeared to understand. \"One of\nmy friends lends me sometimes the keys of a house which he rents, Rue\nBaudoyer, the spacious gardens of which extend behind a certain house on\nthe Place de Greve.\"\n\n\"That is the place for us,\" said the abbe. \"What house?\"\n\n\"A _cabaret_, pretty well frequented, whose sign represents the image of\nNotre Dame.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said the abbe.\n\n\"This _cabaret_ has windows opening upon the Place, a place of exit into\nthe court, which must abut upon the gardens of my friend by a door of\ncommunication.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the abbe.\n\n\"Enter by the _cabaret_, take the prisoners in; defend the door while\nyou enable them to fly by the garden and the Place Baudoyer.\"\n\n\"That is all plain. Monsieur, you would make an excellent general, like\nmonsieur le prince.\"\n\n\"Have you understood me?\"\n\n\"Perfectly well.\"\n\n\"How much will it amount to, to make your bandits all drunk with wine,\nand to satisfy them with gold?\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, what an expression! Oh! monsieur, if they heard you! some\nof them are very susceptible.\"\n\n\"I mean to say they must be brought to the point where they cannot tell\nthe heavens from the earth; for I shall to-morrow contend with the king;\nand when I fight I mean to conquer--please to understand.\"\n\n\"It shall be done, monsieur. Give me your other ideas.\"\n\n\"That is your business.\"\n\n\"Then give me your purse.\"\n\n\"Gourville, count a hundred thousand livres for the abbe.\"\n\n\"Good! and spare nothing, did you not say?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"That is well.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" objected Gourville, \"if this should be known, we should\nlose our heads.\"\n\n\"Eh! Gourville,\" replied Fouquet, purple with anger, \"you excite my\npity. Speak for yourself, if you please. My head does not shake in that\nmanner upon my shoulders. Now, abbe, is everything arranged?\"\n\n\"Everything.\"\n\n\"At two o'clock to-morrow.\"\n\n\"At twelve, because it will be necessary to prepare our auxiliaries in a\nsecret manner.\"\n\n\"That is true; do not spare the wine of the _cabaretier_.\"\n\n\"I will spare neither his wine nor his house,\" replied the abbe, with\na sneering laugh. \"I have my plan, I tell you; leave me to set it in\noperation, and you shall see.\"\n\n\"Where shall you be yourself?\"\n\n\"Everywhere; nowhere.\"\n\n\"And how shall I receive information?\"\n\n\"By a courier whose horse shall be kept in the very same garden of your\nfriend. _A propos_, the name of your friend?\"\n\nFouquet looked again at Gourville. The latter came to the succor of his\nmaster, saying, [\"The name is of no importance.\"\n\nFouquet continued, \"Accompany] monsieur l'abbe, for several reasons, but\nthe house is easily to be known--the 'Image-de-Notre-Dame' in the front,\na garden, the only one in the quarter, behind.\"\n\n     [The text is corrupt at this point. The suggested reading,\n     in brackets, is my own.--JB.]\n\n\"Good, good! I will go and give notice to my soldiers.\"\n\n\"Accompany him, Gourville,\" said Fouquet, \"and count him down the money.\nOne moment, abbe--one moment, Gourville--what name will be given to this\ncarrying off?\"\n\n\"A very natural one, monsieur--the Riot.\"\n\n\"The riot on account of what? For, if ever the people of Paris\nare disposed to pay their court to the king, it is when he hangs\nfinanciers.\"\n\n\"I will manage that,\" said the abbe.\n\n\"Yes; but you may manage it badly, and people will guess.\"\n\n\"Not at all,--not at all. I have another idea.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"My men shall cry out, '_Colbert, vive Colbert!_' and shall throw\nthemselves upon the prisoners as if they would tear them in pieces, and\nshall force them from the gibbets, as too mild a punishment.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is an idea,\" said Gourville. \"_Peste!_ monsieur l'abbe, what\nan imagination you have!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, we are worthy of our family,\" replied the abbe, proudly.\n\n\"Strange fellow,\" murmured Fouquet. Then he added, \"That is ingenious.\nCarry it out, but shed no blood.\"\n\nGourville and the abbe set off together, with their heads full of the\nmeditated riot. The superintendent laid himself down upon some cushions,\nhalf valiant with respect to the sinister projects of the morrow, half\ndreaming of love.\n\n\n\nChapter LXI. The Cabaret of the Image-de-Notre-Dame.\n\nAt two o'clock the next day fifty thousand spectators had taken their\nposition upon the Place, around the two gibbets which had been elevated\nbetween the Quai de la Greve and the Quai Pelletier; one close to the\nother, with their backs to the embankment of the river. In the morning\nalso, all the sworn criers of the good city of Paris had traversed the\nquarters of the city, particularly the _halles_ and the _faubourgs_,\nannouncing with their hoarse and indefatigable voices the great justice\ndone by the king upon two speculators, two thieves, devourers of the\npeople. And these people, whose interests were so warmly looked after,\nin order not to fail in respect for their king, quitted shops, stalls,\nand _atliers_, to go and evince a little gratitude to Louis XIV.,\nabsolutely like invited guests, who feared to commit an impoliteness in\nnot repairing to the house of him who had invited them. According to the\ntenor of the sentence, which the criers read aloud and incorrectly, two\nfarmers of the revenues, monopolists of money, dilapidators of the royal\nprovisions, extortioners, and forgers, were about to undergo capital\npunishment on the Place de Greve, with their names blazoned over their\nheads, according to their sentence. As to those names, the sentence made\nno mention of them. The curiosity of the Parisians was at its height,\nand, as we have said, an immense crowd waited with feverish impatience\nthe hour fixed for the execution. The news had already spread that the\nprisoners, transferred to the Chateau of Vincennes, would be conducted\nfrom that prison to the Place de Greve. Consequently, the faubourg and\nthe Rue Saint Antoine were crowded; for the population of Paris in those\ndays of great executions was divided into two categories: those who\ncame to see the condemned pass--these were of timid and mild hearts,\nbut philosophically curious--and those who wished to see the condemned\ndie--these had hearts that hungered for sensation. On this day M.\nd'Artagnan received his last instructions from the king, and made his\nadieus to his friends, the number of whom was, at the moment, reduced\nto Planchet, then he traced the plan of his day, as every busy man\nwhose moments are counted ought to do, because he appreciates their\nimportance.\n\n\"My departure is to be,\" said he, \"at break of day, three o'clock in\nthe morning; I have then fifteen hours before me. Take from them the\nsix hours of sleep which are indispensable for me--six; one hour for\nrepasts--seven; one hour for a farewell visit to Athos--eight; two hours\nfor chance circumstances--total, ten. There are then five hours left.\nOne hour to get my money,--that is, to have payment refused by M.\nFouquet; another hour to go and receive my money of M. Colbert, together\nwith his questions and grimaces; one hour to look over my clothes and\narms, and get my boots cleaned. I still have two hours left. _Mordioux!_\nhow rich I am.\" And so saying, D'Artagnan felt a strange joy, a joy of\nyouth, a perfume of those great and happy years of former times mount\ninto his brain and intoxicate him. \"During these two hours I will\ngo,\" said the musketeer, \"and take my quarter's rent of the\nImage-de-Notre-Dame. That will be pleasant. Three hundred and\nseventy-five livres! _Mordioux!_ but that is astonishing! If the poor\nman who has but one livre in his pocket, found a livre and twelve\ndeniers, that would be justice, that would be excellent; but never does\nsuch a godsend fall to the lot of the poor man. The rich man, on the\ncontrary, makes himself revenue with his money, which he does not even\ntouch. Here are three hundred and seventy-five livres which fall to\nme from heaven. I will go then to the Image-de-Notre-Dame, and drink a\nglass of Spanish wine with my tenant, which he cannot fail to offer me.\nBut order must be observed, Monsieur d'Artagnan, order must be observed!\nLet us organize our time, then, and distribute the employment of it!\nArt. 1st, Athos; Art. 2d, the Image-de-Notre-Dame; Art. 3rd, M. Fouquet;\nArt. 4th, M. Colbert; Art. 5th, supper; Art. 6th, clothes, boots, horse,\nportmanteau; Art. 7th and last, sleep.\"\n\nIn consequence of this arrangement, D'Artagnan went straight to the\nComte de la Fere, to whom, modestly and ingenuously, he related a part\nof his fortunate adventures. Athos had not been without uneasiness on\nthe subject of D'Artagnan's visit to the king; but few words sufficed\nfor an explanation of that. Athos divined that Louis had charged\nD'Artagnan with some important mission, and did not even make an effort\nto draw the secret from him. He only recommended him to take care of\nhimself, and offered discreetly to accompany him if that were desirable.\n\n\"But, my dear friend,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I am going nowhere.\"\n\n\"What! you come and bid me adieu, and are going nowhere?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, yes,\" replied D'Artagnan, coloring a little, \"I am going to\nmake an acquisition.\"\n\n\"That is quite another thing. Then I change my formula. Instead of 'Do\nnot get yourself killed,' I will say,--'Do not get yourself robbed.'\"\n\n\"My friend, I will inform you if I set eyes on any property that pleases\nme, and shall expect you will favor me with your opinion.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Athos, too delicate to permit himself even the\nconsolation of a smile. Raoul imitated the paternal reserve. But\nD'Artagnan thought it would appear too mysterious to leave his friends\nunder a pretense, without even telling them the route he was about to\ntake.\n\n\"I have chosen Le Mans,\" said he to Athos. \"It is a good country?\"\n\n\"Excellent, my friend,\" replied the count, without making him observe\nthat Le Mans was in the same directions as La Touraine, and that\nby waiting two days, at most, he might travel with a friend. But\nD'Artagnan, more embarrassed than the count, dug, at every explanation,\ndeeper into the mud, into which he sank by degrees. \"I shall set out\nto-morrow at daybreak,\" said he at last. \"Till that time, will you come\nwith me, Raoul?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur le chevalier,\" said the young man, \"if monsieur le comte\ndoes not want me.\"\n\n\"No, Raoul; I am to have an audience to-day of Monsieur, the king's\nbrother; that is all I have to do.\"\n\nRaoul asked Grimaud for his sword, which the old man brought him\nimmediately. \"Now then,\" added D'Artagnan, opening his arms to Athos,\n\"adieu, my dear friend!\" Athos held him in a long embrace, and the\nmusketeer, who knew his discretion so well, murmured in his ear--\"An\naffair of state,\" to which Athos only replied by a pressure of the hand,\nstill more significant. They then separated. Raoul took the arm of his\nold friend, who led him along the Rue Saint-Honore. \"I an conducting\nyou to the abode of the god Plutus,\" said D'Artagnan to the young man;\n\"prepare yourself. The whole day you will witness the piling up of\ncrowns. Heavens! how I am changed!\"\n\n\"Oh! what numbers of people there are in the street!\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Is there a procession to-day?\" asked D'Artagnan of a passer-by.\n\n\"Monsieur, it is a hanging,\" replied the man.\n\n\"What! a hanging at the Greve?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"The devil take the rogue who gets himself hung the day I want to go and\ntake my rent!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"Raoul, did you ever see anybody hung?\"\n\n\"Never, monsieur--thank God!\"\n\n\"Oh! how young that sounds! If you were on guard in the trenches, as I\nwas, and a spy! But, pardon me, Raoul, I am doting--you are quite right,\nit is a hideous sight to see a person hung! At what hour do they hang\nthem, monsieur, if you please?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the stranger respectfully, delighted at joining\nconversation with two men of the sword, \"it will take place at about\nthree o'clock.\"\n\n\"Aha! it is now only half-past one; let us step out, we shall be there\nin time to touch my three hundred and seventy-five livres, and get away\nbefore the arrival of the malefactor.\"\n\n\"Malefactors, monsieur,\" continued the _bourgeois_; \"there are two of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I return to you many thanks,\" said D'Artagnan, who as he grew\nolder, had become polite to a degree. Drawing Raoul along, he directed\nhis course rapidly in the direction of La Greve. Without that great\nexperience musketeers have of a crowd, to which were joined an\nirresistible strength of wrist, and an uncommon suppleness of shoulders,\nour two travelers would not have arrived at their place of destination.\nThey followed the line of the Quai, which they had gained on quitting\nthe Rue Saint-Honore, where they left Athos. D'Artagnan went first; his\nelbow, his wrist, his shoulder formed three wedges which he knew how to\ninsinuate with skill into the groups, to make them split and separate\nlike firewood. He made use sometimes of the hilt of his sword as an\nadditional help: introducing it between ribs that were too rebellious,\nmaking it take the part of a lever or crowbar, to separate husband from\nwife, uncle from nephew, and brother from brother. And all that was done\nso naturally, and with such gracious smiles, that people must have had\nribs of bronze not to cry thank you when the wrist made its play, or\nhearts of diamond not to be enchanted when such a bland smile enlivened\nthe lips of the musketeer. Raoul, following his friend, cajoled the\nwomen who admired his beauty, pushed back the men who felt the rigidity\nof his muscles, and both opened, thanks to these maneuvers, the compact\nand muddy tide of the populace. They arrived in sight of the two\ngibbets, from which Raoul turned away his eyes in disgust. As for\nD'Artagnan, he did not even see them; his house with its gabled roof,\nits windows crowded with the curious, attracted and even absorbed all\nthe attention he was capable of. He distinguished in the Place and\naround the houses a good number of musketeers on leave, who, some with\nwomen, others with friends, awaited the crowning ceremony. What rejoiced\nhim above all was to see that his tenant, the _cabaretier_, was so\nbusy he hardly knew which way to turn. Three lads could not supply\nthe drinkers. They filled the shop, the chambers, and the court, even.\nD'Artagnan called Raoul's attention to this concourse, adding: \"The\nfellow will have no excuse for not paying his rent. Look at those\ndrinkers, Raoul, one would say they were jolly companions. _Mordioux!_\nwhy, there is no room anywhere!\" D'Artagnan, however, contrived to catch\nhold of the master by the corner of his apron, and to make himself known\nto him.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur le chevalier,\" said the _cabaretier_, half distracted,\n\"one minute if you please. I have here a hundred mad devils turning my\ncellar upside down.\"\n\n\"The cellar, if you like, but not the money-box.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, your thirty-seven and a half pistoles are all counted\nout ready for you, upstairs in my chamber; but there are in that chamber\nthirty customers, who are sucking the staves of a little barrel\nof Oporto which I tapped for them this very morning. Give me a\nminute,--only a minute?\"\n\n\"So be it; so be it.\"\n\n\"I will go,\" said Raoul, in a low voice, to D'Artagnan; \"this hilarity\nis vile!\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied D'Artagnan, sternly, \"you will please to remain\nwhere you are. The soldier ought to familiarize himself with all kinds\nof spectacles. There are in the eye, when it is young, fibers which we\nmust learn how to harden; and we are not truly generous and good save\nfrom the moment when the eye has become hardened, and the heart remains\ntender. Besides, my little Raoul, would you leave me alone here? That\nwould be very wrong of you. Look, there is yonder in the lower court a\ntree, and under the shade of that tree we shall breathe more freely than\nin this hot atmosphere of spilt wine.\"\n\nFrom the spot on which they had placed themselves the two new guests of\nthe Image-de-Notre-Dame heard the ever-increasing hubbub of the tide of\npeople, and lost neither a cry nor a gesture of the drinkers, at tables\nin the _cabaret_, or disseminated in the chambers. If D'Artagnan had\nwished to place himself as a _vidette_ for an expedition, he could not\nhave succeeded better. The tree under which he and Raoul were seated\ncovered them with its already thick foliage; it was a low, thick\nchestnut-tree, with inclined branches, that cast their shade over a\ntable so dilapidated the drinkers had abandoned it. We said that from\nthis post D'Artagnan saw everything. He observed the goings and comings\nof the waiters; the arrival of fresh drinkers; the welcome, sometimes\nfriendly, sometimes hostile, given to the newcomers by others already\ninstalled. He observed all this to amuse himself, for the thirty-seven\nand a half pistoles were a long time coming. Raoul recalled his\nattention to it. \"Monsieur,\" said he, \"you do not hurry your tenant,\nand the condemned will soon be here. There will then be such a press we\nshall not be able to get out.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said the musketeer; \"_Hola!_ oh! somebody there!\n_Mordioux!_\" But it was in vain he cried and knocked upon the wreck\nof the old table, which fell to pieces beneath his fist; nobody came.\nD'Artagnan was preparing to go and seek the _cabaretier_ himself, to\nforce him to a definite explanation, when the door of the court in which\nhe was with Raoul, a door which communicated with the garden situated at\nthe back, opened, and a man dressed as a cavalier, with his sword in the\nsheath, but not at his belt, crossed the court without closing the\ndoor; and having cast an oblique glance at D'Artagnan and his companion,\ndirected his course towards the _cabaret_ itself, looking about in\nall directions with his eyes capable of piercing walls of consciences.\n\"Humph!\" said D'Artagnan, \"my tenants are communicating. That, no doubt,\nnow, is some amateur in hanging matters.\" At the same moment the cries\nand disturbance in the upper chambers ceased. Silence, under such\ncircumstances, surprises more than a twofold increase of noise.\nD'Artagnan wished to see what was the cause of this sudden silence. He\nthen perceived that this man, dressed as a cavalier, had just entered\nthe principal chamber, and was haranguing the tipplers, who all listened\nto him with the greatest attention. D'Artagnan would perhaps have heard\nhis speech but for the dominant noise of the popular clamors, which made\na formidable accompaniment to the harangue of the orator. But it was\nsoon finished, and all the people the _cabaret_ contained came out, one\nafter the other, in little groups, so that there only remained six\nin the chamber; one of these six, the man with the sword, took the\n_cabaretier_ aside, engaging him in discourse more or less serious,\nwhilst the others lit a great fire in the chimney-place--a circumstance\nrendered strange by the fine weather and the heat.\n\n\"It is very singular,\" said D'Artagnan to Raoul, \"but I think I know\nthose faces yonder.\"\n\n\"Don't you think you can smell the smoke here?\" said Raoul.\n\n\"I rather think I can smell a conspiracy,\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\nHe had not finished speaking, when four of these men came down into the\ncourt, and without the appearance of any bad design, mounted guard at\nthe door of communication, casting, at intervals, glances at D'Artagnan,\nwhich signified many things.\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" said D'Artagnan, in a low voice, \"there is something going\non. Are you curious, Raoul?\"\n\n\"According to the subject, chevalier.\"\n\n\"Well, I am as curious as an old woman. Come a little more in front; we\nshall get a better view of the place. I would lay a wager that view will\nbe something curious.\"\n\n\"But you know, monsieur le chevalier, that I am not willing to become a\npassive and indifferent spectator of the death of the two poor devils.\"\n\n\"And I, then--do you think I am a savage? We will go in again, when it\nis time to do so. Come along!\" And they made their way towards the front\nof the house, and placed themselves near the window which, still more\nstrangely than the rest, remained unoccupied. The two last drinkers,\ninstead of looking out at this window, kept up the fire. On seeing\nD'Artagnan and his friend enter:--\"Ah! ah! a reinforcement,\" murmured\nthey.\n\nD'Artagnan jogged Raoul's elbow. \"Yes, my braves, a reinforcement,\" said\nhe; \"_cordieu!_ there is a famous fire. Whom are you going to cook?\"\n\nThe two men uttered a shout of jovial laughter, and, instead of\nanswering, threw on more wood. D'Artagnan could not take his eyes off\nthem.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said one of the fire-makers, \"they sent you to tell us the\ntime--did not they?\"\n\n\"Without doubt they have,\" said D'Artagnan, anxious to know what was\ngoing on; \"why should I be here else, if it were not for that?\"\n\n\"Then place yourself at the window, if you please, and observe.\"\nD'Artagnan smiled in his mustache, made a sign to Raoul, and placed\nhimself at the window.\n\n\n\nChapter LXII. Vive Colbert!\n\nThe spectacle which the Greve now presented was a frightful one. The\nheads, leveled by the perspective, extended afar, thick and agitated as\nthe ears of corn in a vast plain. From time to time a fresh report, or a\ndistant rumor, made the heads oscillate and thousands of eyes flash. Now\nand then there were great movements. All those ears of corn bent, and\nbecame waves more agitated than those of the ocean, which rolled from\nthe extremities to the center, and beat, like the tides, against the\nhedge of archers who surrounded the gibbets. Then the handles of\nthe halberds were let fall upon the heads and shoulders of the rash\ninvaders; at times, also, it was the steel as well as the wood, and,\nin that case, a large empty circle was formed around the guard; a space\nconquered upon the extremities, which underwent, in their turn the\noppression of the sudden movement, which drove them against the parapets\nof the Seine. From the window, that commanded a view of the whole Place,\nD'Artagnan saw, with interior satisfaction, that such of the musketeers\nand guards as found themselves involved in the crowd, were able, with\nblows of their fists and the hilts of theirs swords, to keep room. He\neven remarked that they had succeeded, by that _esprit de corps_ which\ndoubles the strength of the soldier, in getting together in one group to\nthe amount of about fifty men; and that, with the exception of a dozen\nstragglers whom he still saw rolling here and there, the nucleus was\ncomplete, and within reach of his voice. But it was not the musketeers\nand guards that drew the attention of D'Artagnan. Around the gibbets,\nand particularly at the entrances to the arcade of Saint-Jean, moved\na noisy mass, a busy mass; daring faces, resolute demeanors were to be\nseen here and there, mingled with silly faces and indifferent demeanors;\nsignals were exchanged, hands given and taken. D'Artagnan remarked among\nthe groups, and those groups the most animated, the face of the cavalier\nwhom he had seen enter by the door of communication from his garden, and\nwho had gone upstairs to harangue the drinkers. That man was organizing\ntroops and giving orders.\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"I was not deceived; I know\nthat man,--it is Menneville. What the devil is he doing here?\"\n\nA distant murmur, which became more distinct by degrees, stopped\nthis reflection, and drew his attention another way. This murmur was\noccasioned by the arrival of the culprits; a strong picket of archers\npreceded them, and appeared at the angle of the arcade. The entire crowd\nnow joined as if in one cry; all the cries united formed one immense\nhowl. D'Artagnan saw Raoul was becoming pale, and he slapped him roughly\non the shoulder. The fire-keepers turned round on hearing the great\ncry, and asked what was going on. \"The condemned are arrived,\" said\nD'Artagnan. \"That's well,\" replied they, again replenishing the fire.\nD'Artagnan looked at them with much uneasiness; it was evident that\nthese men who were making such a fire for no apparent purpose had some\nstrange intentions. The condemned appeared upon the Place. They were\nwalking, the executioner before them, whilst fifty archers formed a\nhedge on their right and their left. Both were dressed in black; they\nappeared pale, but firm. They looked impatiently over the people's\nheads, standing on tip-toe at every step. D'Artagnan remarked this.\n\"_Mordioux!_\" cried he, \"they are in a great hurry to get a sight of the\ngibbet!\" Raoul drew back, without, however, having the power to leave\nthe window. Terror even has its attractions.\n\n\"To the death! to the death!\" cried fifty thousand voices.\n\n\"Yes; to the death!\" howled a hundred frantic others, as if the great\nmass had given them the reply.\n\n\"To the halter! to the halter!\" cried the great whole; \"_Vive le roi!_\"\n\n\"Well,\" said D'Artagnan, \"this is droll; I should have thought it was M.\nColbert who had caused them to be hung.\"\n\nThere was, at this moment, a great rolling movement in the crowd, which\nstopped for a moment the march of the condemned. The people of a bold\nand resolute mien, whom D'Artagnan had observed, by dint of pressing,\npushing, and lifting themselves up, had succeeded in almost touching the\nhedge of archers. The _cortege_ resumed its march. All at once, to cries\nof \"_Vive Colbert!_\" those men, of whom D'Artagnan never lost sight,\nfell upon the escort, which in vain endeavored to stand against them.\nBehind these men was the crowd. Then commenced, amidst a frightful\ntumult, as frightful a confusion. This time there was something more\nthan cries of expectation or cries of joy, there were cries of pain.\nHalberds struck men down, swords ran through them, muskets were\ndischarged at them. The confusion became then so great that D'Artagnan\ncould no longer distinguish anything. Then, from this chaos, suddenly\nsurged something like a visible intention, like a will pronounced. The\ncondemned had been torn from the hands of the guards, and were being\ndragged towards the house of L'Image-de-Notre-Dame. Those who dragged\nthem shouted, \"_Vive Colbert!_\" The people hesitated, not knowing which\nthey ought to fall upon, the archers or the aggressors. What stopped the\npeople was, that those who cried \"_Vive Colbert!_\" began to cry, at the\nsame time, \"No halter! no halter! to the fire! to the fire! burn the\nthieves! burn the extortioners!\" This cry, shouted with an _ensemble_,\nobtained enthusiastic success. The populace had come to witness an\nexecution, and here was an opportunity offered them of performing one\nthemselves. It was this that must be most agreeable to the populace:\ntherefore, they ranged themselves immediately on the party of the\naggressors against the archers, crying with the minority, which had\nbecome, thanks to them, the most compact majority: \"Yes, yes: to the\nfire with the thieves! _Vive Colbert!_\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, \"this begins to look serious.\"\n\nOne of the men who remained near the chimney approached the window, a\nfirebrand in his hand. \"Ah, ah!\" said he, \"it gets warm.\" Then, turning\nto his companion: \"There is the signal,\" added he; and he immediately\napplied the burning brand to the wainscoting. Now, this _cabaret_ of the\nImage-de-Notre-Dame was not a very newly built house, and therefore, did\nnot require much entreating to take fire. In a second the boards began\nto crackle, and the flames arose sparkling to the ceiling. A howling\nfrom without replied to the shouts of the incendiaries. D'Artagnan, who\nhad not seen what passed, from being engaged at the window, felt, at the\nsame time, the smoke which choked him and the fire that scorched him.\n\"_Hola!_\" cried he, turning round, \"is the fire here? Are you drunk or\nmad, my masters?\"\n\nThe two men looked at each other with an air of astonishment. \"In what?\"\nasked they of D'Artagnan; \"was it not a thing agreed upon?\"\n\n\"A thing agreed upon that you should burn my house!\" vociferated\nD'Artagnan, snatching the brand from the hand of the incendiary, and\nstriking him with it across the face. The second wanted to assist his\ncomrade, but Raoul, seizing him by the middle, threw him out of the\nwindow, whilst D'Artagnan pushed his man down the stairs. Raoul, first\ndisengaged, tore the burning wainscoting down, and threw it flaming into\nthe chamber. At a glance D'Artagnan saw there was nothing to be feared\nfrom the fire, and sprang to the window. The disorder was at its height.\nThe air was filled with simultaneous cries of \"To the fire!\" \"To the\ndeath!\" \"To the halter!\" \"To the stake!\" \"_Vive Colbert!_\" \"_Vive le\nroi!_\" The group which had forced the culprits from the hands of the\narchers had drawn close to the house, which appeared to be the goal\ntowards which they dragged them. Menneville was at the head of this\ngroup, shouting louder than all the others, \"To the fire! to the fire!\n_Vive Colbert!_\" D'Artagnan began to comprehend what was meant. They\nwanted to burn the condemned, and his house was to serve as a funeral\npile.\n\n\"Halt, there!\" cried he, sword in hand, and one foot upon the window.\n\"Menneville, what do you want to do?\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" cried the latter; \"give way, give way!\"\n\n\"To the fire! to the fire with the thieves! _Vive Colbert!_\"\n\nThese cries exasperated D'Artagnan. \"_Mordioux!_\" said he. \"What! burn\nthe poor devils who are only condemned to be hung? that is infamous!\"\n\nBefore the door, however, the mass of anxious spectators, rolled\nback against the walls, had become more thick, and closed up the way.\nMenneville and his men, who were dragging along the culprits, were\nwithin ten paces of the door.\n\nMenneville made a last effort. \"Passage! passage!\" cried he, pistol in\nhand.\n\n\"Burn them! burn them!\" repeated the crowd. \"The Image-de-Notre-Dame\nis on fire! Burn the thieves! burn the monopolists in the\nImage-de-Notre-Dame!\"\n\nThere now remained no doubt, it was plainly D'Artagnan's house that was\ntheir object. D'Artagnan remembered the old cry, always so effective\nfrom his mouth: \"_A moi! mousquetaires!_\" shouted he, with the voice of\na giant, with one of those voices which dominate over cannon, the sea,\nthe tempest. \"_A moi! mousquetaires!_\" And suspending himself by the\narm from the balcony, he allowed himself to drop amidst the crowd, which\nbegan to draw back form a house that rained men. Raoul was on the ground\nas soon as he, both sword in hand. All the musketeers on the Place\nheard that challenging cry--all turned round at that cry, and recognized\nD'Artagnan. \"To the captain, to the captain!\" cried they, in their turn.\nAnd the crowd opened before them as though before the prow of a vessel.\nAt that moment D'Artagnan and Menneville found themselves face to face.\n\"Passage, passage!\" cried Menneville, seeing that he was within an arm's\nlength from the door.\n\n\"No one passes here,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Take that, then!\" said Menneville, firing his pistol almost within\nan arm's length. But before the cock fell, D'Artagnan had struck up\nMenneville's arm with the hilt of his sword and passed the blade through\nhis body.\n\n\"I told you plainly to keep yourself quiet,\" said D'Artagnan to\nMenneville, who rolled at his feet.\n\n\"Passage! passage!\" cried the companions of Menneville, at first\nterrified, but soon recovering, when they found they had only to do with\ntwo men. But those two men were hundred-armed giants; the swords flew\nabout in their hands like the burning _glaive_ of the archangel. They\npierce with its point, strike with the flat, cut with the edge; every\nstroke brings down a man. \"For the king!\" cried D'Artagnan, to every man\nhe struck at, that is to say, to every man that fell. This cry became\nthe charging word for the musketeers, who, guided by it, joined\nD'Artagnan. During this time the archers, recovering from the panic they\nhad undergone, charge the aggressors in the rear, and regular as mill\nstrokes, overturn or knock down all that opposed them. The crowd, which\nsees swords gleaming, and drops of blood flying in the air--the crowd\nfalls back and crushes itself. At length cries for mercy and of despair\nresound; that is, the farewell of the vanquished. The two condemned are\nagain in the hands of the archers. D'Artagnan approaches them, seeing\nthem pale and sinking: \"Console yourselves, poor men,\" said he, \"you\nwill not undergo the frightful torture with which these wretches\nthreatened you. The king has condemned you to be hung: you shall only be\nhung. Go on, hang them, and it will be over.\"\n\nThere is no longer anything going on at the Image-de-Notre-Dame. The\nfire has been extinguished with two tuns of wine in default of water.\nThe conspirators have fled by the garden. The archers are dragging the\nculprits to the gibbets. From this moment the affair did not occupy much\ntime. The executioner, heedless about operating according to the rules\nof the art, made such haste that he dispatched the condemned in a couple\nof minutes. In the meantime the people gathered around D'Artagnan,--they\nfelicitated, they cheered him. He wiped his brow, streaming with sweat,\nand his sword, streaming with blood. He shrugged his shoulders at seeing\nMenneville writhing at his feet in the last convulsions. And, while\nRaoul turned away his eyes in compassion, he pointed to the musketeers\nthe gibbets laden with their melancholy fruit. \"Poor devils!\" said he,\n\"I hope they died blessing me, for I saved them with great difficulty.\"\nThese words caught the ear of Menneville at the moment when he himself\nwas breathing his last sigh. A dark, ironical smile flitted across his\nlips; he wished to reply, but the effort hastened the snapping of the\nchord of life--he expired.\n\n\"Oh! all this is very frightful!\" murmured Raoul: \"let us begone,\nmonsieur le chevalier.\"\n\n\"You are not wounded?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Not at all; thank you.\"\n\n\"That's well! Thou art a brave fellow, _mordioux!_ The head of the\nfather, and the arm of Porthos. Ah! if he had been here, good Porthos,\nyou would have seen something worth looking at.\" Then as if by way of\nremembrance--\n\n\"But where the devil can that brave Porthos be?\" murmured D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Come, chevalier, pray come away,\" urged Raoul.\n\n\"One minute, my friend; let me take my thirty-seven and a half\npistols, and I am at your service. The house is a good property,\" added\nD'Artagnan, as he entered the Image-de-Notre-Dame, \"but decidedly,\neven if it were less profitable, I should prefer its being in another\nquarter.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LXIII. How M. d'Eymeris's Diamond passed into the Hands of M.\nd'Artagnan.\n\nWhilst this violent, noisy, and bloody scene was passing on the Greve,\nseveral men, barricaded behind the gate of communication with the\ngarden, replaced their swords in their sheaths, assisted one among them\nto mount a ready saddled horse which was waiting in the garden, and like\na flock of startled birds, fled in all directions, some climbing the\nwalls, others rushing out at the gates with all the fury of a panic. He\nwho mounted the horse, and gave him the spur so sharply that the animal\nwas near leaping the wall, this cavalier, we say, crossed the Place\nBaudoyer, passed like lightening before the crowd in the streets, riding\nagainst, running over and knocking down all that came in his way, and,\nten minutes after, arrived at the gates of the superintendent, more out\nof breath than his horse. The Abbe Fouquet, at the clatter of hoofs on\nthe pavement, appeared at a window of the court, and before even the\ncavalier had set foot to the ground, \"Well! Danicamp?\" cried he, leaning\nhalf out of the window.\n\n\"Well, it is all over,\" replied the cavalier.\n\n\"All over!\" cried the abbe. \"Then they are saved?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" replied the cavalier, \"they are hung.\"\n\n\"Hung!\" repeated the abbe, turning pale. A lateral door suddenly opened,\nand Fouquet appeared in the chamber, pale, distracted, with lips\nhalf opened, breathing a cry of grief and anger. He stopped upon the\nthreshold to listen to what was addressed from the court to the window.\n\n\"Miserable wretches!\" said the abbe, \"you did not fight, then?\"\n\n\"Like lions.\"\n\n\"Say like cowards.\"\n\n\"Monsieur!\"\n\n\"A hundred men accustomed to war, sword in hand, are worth ten thousand\narchers in a surprise. Where is Menneville, that boaster, that braggart,\nwho was to come back either dead or a conqueror?\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, he kept his word. He is dead!\"\n\n\"Dead! Who killed him?\"\n\n\"A demon disguised as a man, a giant armed with ten flaming swords--a\nmadman, who at one blow extinguished the fire, put down the riot,\nand caused a hundred musketeers to rise up out of the pavement of the\nGreve.\"\n\nFouquet raised his brow, streaming with sweat, murmuring, \"Oh! Lyodot\nand D'Eymeris! dead! dead! dead! and I dishonored.\"\n\nThe abbe turned round, and perceiving his brother, despairing and livid,\n\"Come, come,\" said he, \"it is a blow of fate, monsieur; we must not\nlament thus. Our attempt has failed because God--\"\n\n\"Be silent, abbe! be silent!\" cried Fouquet; \"your excuses are\nblasphemies. Order that man up here, and let him relate the details of\nthis terrible event.\"\n\n\"But, brother--\"\n\n\"Obey, monsieur!\"\n\nThe abbe made a sign, and in half a minute the man's step was heard upon\nthe stairs. At the same time Gourville appeared behind Fouquet, like the\nguardian angel of the superintendent, pressing one finger on his lips\nto enjoin observation even amidst the bursts of his grief. The minister\nresumed all the serenity that human strength left at the disposal of a\nheart half broken with sorrow. Danicamp appeared. \"Make your report,\"\nsaid Gourville.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the messenger, \"we received orders to carry off the\nprisoners, and to cry '_Vive Colbert!_' whilst carrying them off.\"\n\n\"To burn them alive, was it not, abbe?\" interrupted Gourville.\n\n\"Yes, yes, the order was given to Menneville. Menneville knew what was\nto be done, and Menneville is dead.\"\n\nThis news appeared rather to reassure Gourville than to sadden him.\n\n\"Yes, certainly to burn them alive,\" said the abbe, eagerly.\n\n\"Granted, monsieur, granted,\" said the man, looking into the eyes\nand the faces of the two interlocutors, to ascertain what there was\nprofitable or disadvantageous to himself in telling the truth.\n\n\"Now, proceed,\" said Gourville.\n\n\"The prisoners,\" cried Danicamp, \"were brought to the Greve, and the\npeople, in a fury, insisted upon their being burnt instead of being\nhung.\"\n\n\"And the people were right,\" said the abbe. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"But,\" resumed the man, \"at the moment the archers were broken, at the\nmoment the fire was set to one of the houses of the Place destined to\nserve as a funeral-pile for the guilty, this fury, this demon, this\ngiant of whom I told you, and who, we had been informed, was the\nproprietor of the house in question, aided by a young man who\naccompanied him, threw out of the window those who kept the fire, called\nto his assistance the musketeers who were in the crowd, leaped himself\nfrom the window of the first story into the Place, and plied his\nsword so desperately that the victory was restored to the archers, the\nprisoners were retaken, and Menneville killed. When once recaptured,\nthe condemned were executed in three minutes.\" Fouquet, in spite of his\nself-command, could not prevent a deep groan escaping him.\n\n\"And this man, the proprietor of the house, what is his name?\" said the\nabbe.\n\n\"I cannot tell you, not having even been able to get sight of him; my\npost had been appointed in the garden, and I remained at my post: only\nthe affair was related to me as I repeat it. I was ordered, when once\nthe affair was at an end, to come at best speed and announce to you the\nmanner in which it finished. According to this order, I set out, full\ngallop, and here I am.\"\n\n\"Very well, monsieur, we have nothing else to ask of you,\" said the\nabbe, more and more dejected, in proportion as the moment approached for\nfinding himself alone with his brother.\n\n\"Have you been paid?\" asked Gourville.\n\n\"Partly, monsieur,\" replied Danicamp.\n\n\"Here are twenty pistols. Begone, monsieur, and never forget to defend,\nas this time has been done, the true interests of the king.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said the man, bowing and pocketing the money. After\nwhich he went out. Scarcely had the door closed after him when Fouquet,\nwho had remained motionless, advanced with a rapid step and stood\nbetween the abbe and Gourville. Both of them at the same time opened\ntheir mouths to speak to him. \"No excuses,\" said he, \"no recriminations\nagainst anybody. If I had not been a false friend I should not have\nconfided to any one the care of delivering Lyodot and D'Eymeris. I alone\nam guilty; to me alone are reproaches and remorse due. Leave me, abbe.\"\n\n\"And yet, monsieur, you will not prevent me,\" replied the latter, \"from\nendeavoring to find out the miserable fellow who has intervened to the\nadvantage of M. Colbert in this so well-arranged affair; for, if it is\ngood policy to love our friends dearly, I do not believe that is bad\nwhich consists in obstinately pursuing our enemies.\"\n\n\"A truce to policy, abbe; begone, I beg of you, and do not let me hear\nany more of you till I send for you; what we most need is circumspection\nand silence. You have a terrible example before you, gentlemen: no\nreprisals, I forbid them.\"\n\n\"There are no orders,\" grumbled the abbe, \"which will prevent me from\navenging a family affront upon the guilty person.\"\n\n\"And I,\" cried Fouquet, in that imperative tone to which one feels there\nis nothing to reply, \"if you entertain one thought, one single thought,\nwhich is not the absolute expression of my will, I will have you cast\ninto the Bastile two hours after that thought has manifested itself.\nRegulate your conduct accordingly, abbe.\"\n\nThe abbe colored and bowed. Fouquet made a sign to Gourville to follow\nhim, and was already directing his steps towards his cabinet, when the\nusher announced with a loud voice: \"Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\" said Fouquet, negligently, to Gourville.\n\n\"An ex-lieutenant of his majesty's musketeers,\" replied Gourville, in\nthe same tone. Fouquet did not even take the trouble to reflect, and\nresumed his walk. \"I beg your pardon, monseigneur!\" said Gourville, \"but\nI have remembered; this brave man has quitted the king's service, and\nprobably comes to receive an installment of some pension or other.\"\n\n\"Devil take him!\" said Fouquet, \"why does he choose his opportunity so\nill?\"\n\n\"Permit me then, monseigneur, to announce your refusal to him; for he is\none of my acquaintance, and is a man whom, in our present circumstances,\nit would be better to have as a friend than an enemy.\"\n\n\"Answer him as you please,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"Eh! good Lord!\" said the abbe, still full of malice, like an\negotistical man; \"tell him there is no money, particularly for\nmusketeers.\"\n\nBut scarcely had the abbe uttered this imprudent speech, when the partly\nopen door was thrown back, and D'Artagnan appeared.\n\n\"Eh! Monsieur Fouquet,\" said he, \"I was well aware there was no money\nfor musketeers here. Therefore I did not come to obtain any, but to have\nit refused. That being done, receive my thanks. I give you good-day, and\nwill go and seek it at M. Colbert's.\" And he went out, making an easy\nbow.\n\n\"Gourville,\" said Fouquet, \"run after that man and bring him back.\"\nGourville obeyed, and overtook D'Artagnan on the stairs.\n\nD'Artagnan, hearing steps behind him, turned round and perceived\nGourville. \"_Mordioux!_ my dear monsieur,\" said he, \"there are sad\nlessons which you gentlemen of finance teach us; I come to M. Fouquet\nto receive a sum accorded by his majesty, and I am received like a\nmendicant who comes to ask charity, or a thief who comes to steal a\npiece of plate.\"\n\n\"But you pronounced the name of M. Colbert, my dear M. d'Artagnan; you\nsaid you were going to M. Colbert's?\"\n\n\"I certainly am going there, were it only to ask satisfaction of the\npeople who try to burn houses, crying '_Vive Colbert!_'\"\n\nGourville pricked up his ears. \"Oh, oh!\" said he, \"you allude to what\nhas just happened at the Greve?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"And in what did that which has taken place concern you?\"\n\n\"What! do you ask me whether it concerns me or does not concern me, if\nM. Colbert pleases to make a funeral-pile of my house?\"\n\n\"So, ho, _your_ house--was it your house they wanted to burn?\"\n\n\"_Pardieu!_ was it!\"\n\n\"Is the _cabaret_ of the Image-de-Notre-Dame yours, then?\"\n\n\"It has been this week.\"\n\n\"Well, then, are you the brave captain, are you the valiant blade who\ndispersed those who wished to burn the condemned?\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Gourville, put yourself in my place. I was an agent\nof the public force and a landlord, too. As a captain, it is my duty to\nhave the orders of the king accomplished. As a proprietor, it is to my\ninterest my house should not be burnt. I have at the same time attended\nto the laws of interest and duty in replacing Messieurs Lyodot and\nD'Eymeris in the hands of the archers.\"\n\n\"Then it was you who threw the man out of the window?\"\n\n\"It was I, myself,\" replied D'Artagnan, modestly.\n\n\"And you who killed Menneville?\"\n\n\"I had that misfortune,\" said D'Artagnan, bowing like a man who is being\ncongratulated.\n\n\"It was you, then, in short, who caused the two condemned persons to be\nhung?\"\n\n\"Instead of being burnt, yes, monsieur, and I am proud of it. I saved\nthe poor devils from horrible tortures. Understand, my dear Monsieur de\nGourville, that they wanted to burn them alive. It exceeds imagination!\"\n\n\"Go, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, go,\" said Gourville, anxious to spare\nFouquet the sight of the man who had just caused him such profound\ngrief.\n\n\"No,\" said Fouquet, who had heard all from the door of the ante-chamber;\n\"not so; on the contrary, Monsieur d'Artagnan, come in.\"\n\nD'Artagnan wiped from the hilt of his sword a last bloody trace, which\nhad escaped his notice, and returned. He then found himself face to\nface with these three men, whose countenances wore very different\nexpressions. With the abbe it was anger, with Gourville stupor, with\nFouquet it was dejection.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, monsieur le ministre,\" said D'Artagnan, \"but my\ntime is short; I have to go to the office of the intendant, to have an\nexplanation with Monsieur Colbert, and to receive my quarter's pension.\"\n\n\"But, monsieur,\" said Fouquet, \"there is money here.\" D'Artagnan\nlooked at the superintendent with astonishment. \"You have been answered\ninconsiderately, monsieur, I know, because I heard it,\" said the\nminister; \"a man of your merit ought to be known by everybody.\"\nD'Artagnan bowed. \"Have you an order?\" added Fouquet.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Give it me, I will pay you myself; come with me.\" He made a sign to\nGourville and the abbe, who remained in the chamber where they were.\nHe led D'Artagnan into his cabinet. As soon as the door was shut,--\"how\nmuch is due to you, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Why, something like five thousand livres, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"For arrears of pay?\"\n\n\"For a quarter's pay.\"\n\n\"A quarter consisting of five thousand livres!\" said Fouquet, fixing\nupon the musketeer a searching look. \"Does the king, then, give you\ntwenty thousand livres a year?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur, twenty thousand livres a year. Do you think it is too\nmuch?\"\n\n\"I?\" cried Fouquet, and he smiled bitterly. \"If I had any knowledge of\nmankind, if I were--instead of being a frivolous, inconsequent, and vain\nspirit--of a prudent and reflective spirit; if, in a word, I had, as\ncertain persons have known how, regulated my life, you would not receive\ntwenty thousand livres a year, but a hundred thousand, and you would\nbelong not to the king but to me.\"\n\nD'Artagnan colored slightly. There is sometimes in the manner in which\na eulogium is given, in the voice, in the affectionate tone, a poison so\nsweet, that the strongest mind is intoxicated by it. The superintendent\nterminated his speech by opening a drawer, and taking from it four\n_rouleaux_, which he placed before D'Artagnan. The Gascon opened one.\n\"Gold!\" said he.\n\n\"It will be less burdensome, monsieur.\"\n\n\"But, then, monsieur, these make twenty thousand livres.\"\n\n\"No doubt they do.\"\n\n\"But only five are due to me.\"\n\n\"I wish to spare you the trouble of coming four times to my office.\"\n\n\"You overwhelm me, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I do only what I ought to do, monsieur le chevalier; and I hope you\nwill not bear me any malice on account of the rude reception my brother\ngave you. He is of a sour, capricious disposition.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said D'Artagnan, \"believe me, nothing would grieve me more\nthan an excuse from you.\"\n\n\"Therefore I will make no more, and will content myself with asking you\na favor.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur.\"\n\nFouquet drew from his finger a ring worth about three thousand pistoles.\n\"Monsieur,\" said he, \"this stone was given me by a friend of my\nchildhood, by a man to whom you have rendered a great service.\"\n\n\"A service--I?\" said the musketeer; \"I have rendered a service to one of\nyour friends?\"\n\n\"You cannot have forgotten it, monsieur, for it dates this very day.\"\n\n\"And that friend's name was--\"\n\n\"M. d'Eymeris.\"\n\n\"One of the condemned?\"\n\n\"Yes, one of the victims. Well! Monsieur d'Artagnan, in return for the\nservice you have rendered him, I beg you to accept this diamond. Do so\nfor my sake.\"\n\n\"Monsieur! you--\"\n\n\"Accept it, I say. To-day is with me a day of mourning; hereafter you\nwill, perhaps, learn why; to-day I have lost one friend; well, I will\ntry to get another.\"\n\n\"But, Monsieur Fouquet--\"\n\n\"Adieu! Monsieur d'Artagnan, adieu!\" cried Fouquet, with much emotion;\n\"or rather, _au revoir_.\" And the minister quitted the cabinet, leaving\nin the hands of the musketeer the ring and the twenty thousand livres.\n\n\"Oh!\" said D'Artagnan, after a moment's dark reflection. \"How on earth\nam I to understand what this means? _Mordioux!_ I can understand this\nmuch, only: he is a gallant man! I will go and explain matters to M.\nColbert.\" And he went out.\n\n\n\nChapter LXIV. Of the Notable Difference D'Artagnan finds between\nMonsieur the Intendant and Monsieur the Superintendent.\n\nM. Colbert resided in the Rue Neuve des Petits-Champs, in a house which\nhad belonged to Beautru. D'Artagnan's legs cleared the distance in a\nshort quarter of an hour. When he arrived at the residence of the\nnew favorite, the court was full of archers and police, who came to\ncongratulate him, or to excuse themselves, according to whether\nhe should choose to praise or blame. The sentiment of flattery is\ninstinctive with people of abject condition; they have the sense of it,\nas the wild animal has that of hearing and smell. These people, or their\nleader, understood that there was a pleasure to offer to M. Colbert,\nin rendering him an account of the fashion in which his name had been\npronounced during the rash enterprise of the morning. D'Artagnan made\nhis appearance just as the chief of the watch was giving his report. He\nstood close to the door, behind the archers. That officer took Colbert\non one side, in spite of his resistance and the contradiction of his\nbushy eyebrows. \"In case,\" said he, \"you really desired, monsieur, that\nthe people should do justice on the two traitors, it would have been\nwise to warn us of it; for, indeed, monsieur, in spite of our regret at\ndispleasing you, or thwarting your views, we had our orders to execute.\"\n\n\"Triple fool!\" replied Colbert, furiously shaking his hair, thick and\nblack as a mane; \"what are you telling me? What! that _I_ could have had\nan idea of a riot! Are you mad or drunk?\"\n\n\"But, monsieur, they cried '_Vive Colbert!_'\" replied the trembling\nwatch.\n\n\"A handful of conspirators--\"\n\n\"No, no; a mass of people.\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed,\" said Colbert, expanding. \"A mass of people cried '_Vive\nColbert!_' Are you certain of what you say, monsieur?\"\n\n\"We had nothing to do but open our ears, or rather to close them, so\nterrible were the cries.\"\n\n\"And this was from the people, the real people?\"\n\n\"Certainly, monsieur; only these real people beat us.\"\n\n\"Oh! very well,\" continued Colbert, thoughtfully. \"Then you suppose it\nwas the people alone who wished to burn the condemned?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"That is quite another thing. You strongly resisted, then?\"\n\n\"We had three of our men crushed to death, monsieur!\"\n\n\"But you killed nobody yourselves?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, a few of the rioters were left upon the square, and one among\nthem who was not a common man.\"\n\n\"Who was he?\"\n\n\"A certain Menneville, upon whom the police have a long time had an\neye.\"\n\n\"Menneville!\" cried Colbert, \"what, he who killed Rue de la Huchette, a\nworthy man who wanted a fat fowl?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; the same.\"\n\n\"And did this Menneville also cry, '_Vive Colbert_'?\"\n\n\"Louder than all the rest; like a madman.\"\n\nColbert's brow grew dark and wrinkled. A kind of ambitious glory which\nhad lighted his face was extinguished, like the light of glow-worms we\ncrush beneath the grass. \"Then you say,\" resumed the deceived intendant,\n\"that the initiative came from the people? Menneville was my enemy; I\nwould have had him hung, and he knew it well. Menneville belonged to\nthe Abbe Fouquet--the affair originated with Fouquet; does not everybody\nknow that the condemned were his friends from childhood?\"\n\n\"That is true,\" thought D'Artagnan, \"and thus are all my doubts cleared\nup. I repeat it, Monsieur Fouquet may be called what they please, but he\nis a very gentlemanly man.\"\n\n\"And,\" continued Colbert, \"are you quite sure Menneville is dead?\"\n\nD'Artagnan thought the time was come for him to make his appearance.\n\"Perfectly, monsieur;\" replied he, advancing suddenly.\n\n\"Oh! is that you, monsieur?\" said Colbert.\n\n\"In person,\" replied the musketeer with his deliberate tone; \"it appears\nthat you had in Menneville a pretty enemy.\"\n\n\"It was not I, monsieur, who had an enemy,\" replied Colbert; \"it was the\nking.\"\n\n\"Double brute!\" thought D'Artagnan, \"to think to play the great man and\nthe hypocrite with me. Well,\" continued he to Colbert, \"I am very happy\nto have rendered so good a service to the king; will you take upon you\nto tell his majesty, monsieur l'intendant?\"\n\n\"What commission is this you give me, and what do you charge me to tell\nhis majesty, monsieur? Be precise, if you please,\" said Colbert, in a\nsharp voice, tuned beforehand to hostility.\n\n\"I give you no commission,\" replied D'Artagnan, with that calmness which\nnever abandons the banterer; \"I thought it would be easy for you to\nannounce to his majesty that it was I who, being there by chance, did\njustice upon Menneville and restored order to things.\"\n\nColbert opened his eyes and interrogated the chief of the watch with a\nlook--\"Ah! it is very true,\" said the latter, \"that this gentleman saved\nus.\"\n\n\"Why did you not tell me, monsieur, that you came to relate me this?\"\nsaid Colbert with envy; \"everything is explained, and more favorably for\nyou than for anybody else.\"\n\n\"You are in error, monsieur l'intendant, I did not at all come for the\npurpose of relating that to you.\"\n\n\"It is an exploit, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the musketeer carelessly, \"constant habit blunts the mind.\"\n\n\"To what do I owe the honor of your visit, then?\"\n\n\"Simply to this: the king ordered me to come to you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Colbert, recovering himself when he saw D'Artagnan draw a\npaper from his pocket; \"it is to demand some money of me?\"\n\n\"Precisely, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Have the goodness to wait, if you please, monsieur, till I have\ndispatched the report of the watch.\"\n\nD'Artagnan turned upon his heel, insolently enough, and finding himself\nface to face with Colbert, after his first turn, he bowed to him as a\nharlequin would have done; then, after a second evolution, he directed\nhis steps towards the door in quick time. Colbert was struck with this\npointed rudeness, to which he was not accustomed. In general, men of\nthe sword, when they came to his office, had such a want of money, that\nthough their feet seemed to take root in the marble, they hardly lost\ntheir patience. Was D'Artagnan going straight to the king? Would he go\nand describe his rough reception, or recount his exploit? This was a\nmatter for grave consideration. At all events, the moment was badly\nchosen to send D'Artagnan away, whether he came from the king, or on his\nown account. The musketeer had rendered too great a service, and that\ntoo recently, for it to be already forgotten. Therefore Colbert thought\nit would be better to shake off his arrogance and call D'Artagnan back.\n\"Ho! Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" cried Colbert, \"what! are you leaving me\nthus?\"\n\nD'Artagnan turned round: \"Why not?\" said he, quietly, \"we have no more\nto say to each other, have we?\"\n\n\"You have, at least, money to receive, as you have an order?\"\n\n\"Who, I? Oh! not at all, my dear Monsieur Colbert.\"\n\n\"But, monsieur, you have an order. And, in the same manner as you give a\nsword-thrust, when you are required, I, on my part, pay when an order is\npresented to me. Present yours.\"\n\n\"It is useless, my dear Monsieur Colbert,\" said D'Artagnan, who inwardly\nenjoyed this confusion in the ideas of Colbert; \"my order is paid.\"\n\n\"Paid, by whom?\"\n\n\"By monsieur le surintendant.\"\n\nColbert grew pale.\n\n\"Explain yourself,\" said he, in a stifled voice--\"if you are paid why do\nyou show me that paper?\"\n\n\"In consequence of the word of order of which you spoke to me so\ningeniously just now, dear M. Colbert; the king told me to take a\nquarter of the pension he is pleased to make me.\"\n\n\"Of me?\" said Colbert.\n\n\"Not exactly. The king said to me: 'Go to M. Fouquet; the superintendent\nwill, perhaps, have no money, then you will go and draw it of M.\nColbert.'\"\n\nThe countenance of M. Colbert brightened for a moment; but it was with\nhis unfortunate physiognomy as with a stormy sky, sometimes radiant,\nsometimes dark as night, according as the lightening gleams or the cloud\npasses. \"Eh! and was there any money in the superintendent's coffers?\"\nasked he.\n\n\"Why, yes, he could not be badly off for money,\" replied D'Artagnan--\"it\nmay be believed, since M. Fouquet, instead of paying me a quarter or\nfive thousand livres--\"\n\n\"A quarter or five thousand livres!\" cried Colbert, struck, as Fouquet\nhad been, with the generosity of the sum for a soldier's pension, \"why,\nthat would be a pension of twenty thousand livres?\"\n\n\"Exactly, M. Colbert. _Peste!_ you reckon like old Pythagoras; yes,\ntwenty thousand livres.\"\n\n\"Ten times the appointment of an intendant of the finances. I beg to\noffer you my compliments,\" said Colbert, with a vicious smile.\n\n\"Oh!\" said D'Artagnan, \"the king apologized for giving me so little;\nbut he promised to make it more hereafter, when he should be rich; but I\nmust be gone, having much to do--\"\n\n\"So, then, notwithstanding the expectation of the king, the\nsuperintendent paid you, did he?\"\n\n\"In the same manner, as, in opposition to the king's expectation, you\nrefused to pay me.\"\n\n\"I did not refuse, monsieur, I only begged you to wait. And you say that\nM. Fouquet paid you your five thousand livres?\"\n\n\"Yes, as _you_ might have done; but he did even better than that, M.\nColbert.\"\n\n\"And what did he do?\"\n\n\"He politely counted me down the sum-total, saying, that for the king,\nhis coffers were always full.\"\n\n\"The sum-total! M. Fouquet has given you twenty thousand livres instead\nof five thousand?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"And what for?\"\n\n\"In order to spare me three visits to the money-chest of the\nsuperintendent, so that I have the twenty thousand livres in my pocket\nin good new coin. You see, then, that I am able to go away without\nstanding in need of you, having come here only for form's sake.\"\nAnd D'Artagnan slapped his hand upon his pocket, with a laugh which\ndisclosed to Colbert thirty-two magnificent teeth, as white as teeth of\ntwenty-five years old, and which seemed to say in their language: \"Serve\nup to us thirty-two little Colberts, and we will chew them willingly.\"\nThe serpent is as brave as the lion, the hawk as courageous as the\neagle, that cannot be contested. It can only be said of animals that are\ndecidedly cowardly, and are so called, that they will be brave only\nwhen they have to defend themselves. Colbert was not frightened at the\nthirty-two teeth of D'Artagnan. He recovered, and suddenly,--\"Monsieur,\"\nsaid he, \"monsieur le surintendant has done what he had no right to do.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I mean that your note--will you let me see your note, if you please?\"\n\n\"Very willingly; here it is.\"\n\nColbert seized the paper with an eagerness which the musketeer did not\nremark without uneasiness, and particularly without a certain degree of\nregret at having trusted him with it. \"Well, monsieur, the royal order\nsays thus:--'At sight, I command that there be paid to M. d'Artagnan\nthe sum of five thousand livres, forming a quarter of the pension I have\nmade him.'\"\n\n\"So, in fact, it is written,\" said D'Artagnan, affecting calmness.\n\n\"Very well; the king only owed you five thousand livres; why has more\nbeen given to you?\"\n\n\"Because there was more; and M. Fouquet was willing to give me more;\nthat does not concern anybody.\"\n\n\"It is natural,\" said Colbert with a proud ease, \"that you should be\nignorant of the usages of state-finance; but, monsieur, when you have a\nthousand livres to pay, what do you do?\"\n\n\"I never have a thousand livres to pay,\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Once more,\" said Colbert, irritated--\"once more, if you had any sum to\npay, would you not pay what you ought?\"\n\n\"That only proves one thing,\" said D'Artagnan; \"and that is, that you\nhave your own particular customs in finance, and M. Fouquet has his\nown.\"\n\n\"Mine, monsieur, are the correct ones.\"\n\n\"I do not say that they are not.\"\n\n\"And you have accepted what was not due to you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan's eyes flashed. \"What is not due to me yet, you meant to\nsay, M. Colbert; for if I have received what was not due to me at all, I\nshould have committed a theft.\"\n\nColbert made no reply to this subtlety. \"You then owe fifteen thousand\nlivres to the public chest,\" said he, carried away by his jealous ardor.\n\n\"Then you must give me credit for them,\" replied D'Artagnan, with his\nimperceptible irony.\n\n\"Not at all, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well! what will you do, then? You will not take my _rouleaux_ from me,\nwill you?\"\n\n\"You must return them to my chest.\"\n\n\"I! Oh! Monsieur Colbert, don't reckon upon that.\"\n\n\"The king wants his money, monsieur.\"\n\n\"And I, monsieur, I want the king's money.\"\n\n\"That may be so; but you must return this.\"\n\n\"Not a _sou_. I have always understood that in matters of\n_comptabilite_, as you call it, a good cashier never gives back or takes\nback.\"\n\n\"Then, monsieur, we shall see what the king will say about it. I will\nshow him this note, which proves that M. Fouquet not only pays what he\ndoes not owe, but that he does not even take care of vouchers for the\nsums that he has paid.\"\n\n\"Ah! now I understand why you have taken that paper, M. Colbert!\"\n\nColbert did not perceive all that there was of a threatening character\nin his name pronounced in a certain manner. \"You shall see hereafter\nwhat use I will make of it,\" said he, holding up the paper in his\nfingers.\n\n\"Oh!\" said D'Artagnan, snatching the paper from him with a rapid\nmovement; \"I understand perfectly well, M. Colbert; I have no occasion\nto wait for that.\" And he crumpled up the paper he had so cleverly\nseized.\n\n\"Monsieur, monsieur!\" cried Colbert, \"this is violence!\"\n\n\"Nonsense! You must not be particular about a soldier's manners!\"\nreplied D'Artagnan. \"I kiss your hands, my dear M. Colbert.\" And he went\nout, laughing in the face of the future minister.\n\n\"That man, now,\" muttered he, \"was about to grow quite friendly; it is a\ngreat pity I was obliged to cut his company so soon.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LXV. Philosophy of the Heart and Mind.\n\nFor a man who had seen so many much more dangerous ones, the position\nof D'Artagnan with respect to M. Colbert was only comic. D'Artagnan,\ntherefore, did not deny himself the satisfaction of laughing at the\nexpense of monsieur l'intendant, from the Rue des Petits-Champs to the\nRue des Lombards. It was a great while since D'Artagnan had laughed so\nlong together. He was still laughing when Planchet appeared, laughing\nlikewise, at the door of his house; for Planchet, since the return\nof his patron, since the entrance of the English guineas, passed the\ngreater part of his life in doing what D'Artagnan had only done from the\nRue Neuve des Petits-Champs to the Rue des Lombards.\n\n\"You are home, then, my dear master?\" said Planchet.\n\n\"No, my friend,\" replied the musketeer; \"I am off, and that quickly. I\nwill sup with you, go to bed, sleep five hours, and at break of day leap\ninto my saddle. Has my horse had an extra feed?\"\n\n\"Eh! my dear master,\" replied Planchet, \"you know very well that your\nhorse is the jewel of the family; that my lads are caressing it all day,\nand cramming it with sugar, nuts, and biscuits. You ask me if he has had\nan extra feed of oats; you should ask if he has not had enough to burst\nhim.\"\n\n\"Very well, Planchet, that is all right. Now, then, I pass to what\nconcerns me--my supper?\"\n\n\"Ready. A smoking roast joint, white wine, crayfish, and fresh-gathered\ncherries. All ready, my master.\"\n\n\"You are a capital fellow, Planchet; come on, then, let us sup, and I\nwill go to bed.\"\n\nDuring supper D'Artagnan observed that Planchet kept rubbing his\nforehead, as if to facilitate the issue of some idea closely pent within\nhis brain. He looked with an air of kindness at this worthy companion of\nformer adventures and misadventures, and, clinking glass against glass,\n\"Come, Planchet,\" said he, \"let us see what it is that gives you so much\ntrouble to bring forth. _Mordioux!_ Speak freely, and quickly.\"\n\n\"Well, this is it,\" replied Planchet: \"you appear to me to be going on\nsome expedition or another.\"\n\n\"I don't say that I am not.\"\n\n\"Then you have some new idea?\"\n\n\"That is possible, too, Planchet.\"\n\n\"Then there will be fresh capital to be ventured? I will lay down\nfifty thousand livres upon the idea you are about to carry out.\" And so\nsaying, Planchet rubbed his hands one against the other with a rapidity\nevincing great delight.\n\n\"Planchet,\" said D'Artagnan, \"there is but one misfortune in it.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"That the idea is not mine. I can risk nothing upon it.\"\n\nThese words drew a deep sigh from the heart of Planchet. That Avarice\nis an ardent counselor; she carries away her man, as Satan did Jesus,\nto the mountain, and when once she has shown to an unfortunate all the\nkingdoms of the earth, she is able to repose herself, knowing full well\nthat she has left her companion, Envy, to gnaw at his heart. Planchet\nhad tasted of riches easily acquired, and was never afterwards likely\nto stop in his desires; but, as he had a good heart in spite of his\ncovetousness, as he adored D'Artagnan, he could not refrain from making\nhim a thousand recommendations, each more affectionate than the others.\nHe would not have been sorry, nevertheless, to have caught a little hint\nof the secret his master concealed so well; tricks, turns, counsels, and\ntraps were all useless, D'Artagnan let nothing confidential escape\nhim. The evening passed thus. After supper the portmanteau occupied\nD'Artagnan, he took a turn to the stable, patted his horse, and examined\nhis shoes and legs; then, having counted over his money, he went to\nbed, sleeping as if only twenty, because he had neither inquietude nor\nremorse; he closed his eyes five minutes after he had blown out his\nlamp. Many events might, however, have kept him awake. Thought boiled\nin his brain, conjectures abounded, and D'Artagnan was a great drawer\nof horoscopes; but, with that imperturbable phlegm which does more\nthan genius for the fortune and happiness of men of action, he put off\nreflection till the next day, for fear, he said, not to be fresh when he\nwanted to be so.\n\nThe day came. The Rue des Lombards had its share of the caresses of\nAurora with the rosy fingers, and D'Artagnan arose like Aurora. He did\nnot awaken anybody, he placed his portmanteau under his arm, descended\nthe stairs without making one of them creak, and without disturbing one\nof the sonorous snorings in every story from the garret to the cellar,\nthen, having saddled his horse, shut the stable and house doors, he set\noff, at a foot-pace, on his expedition to Bretagne. He had done quite\nright not to trouble himself with all the political and diplomatic\naffairs which solicited his attention; for, in the morning, in freshness\nand mild twilight, his ideas developed themselves in purity and\nabundance. In the first place, he passed before the house of Fouquet,\nand threw in a large gaping box the fortunate order which, the evening\nbefore, he had had so much trouble to recover from the hooked fingers of\nthe intendant. Placed in an envelope, and addressed to Fouquet, it\nhad not even been divined by Planchet, who in divination was equal to\nCalchas or the Pythian Apollo. D'Artagnan thus sent back the order to\nFouquet, without compromising himself, and without having thenceforward\nany reproaches to make himself. When he had effected this proper\nrestitution, \"Now,\" he said to himself, \"let us inhale much maternal\nair, much freedom from cares, much health, let us allow the horse\nZephyr, whose flanks puff as if he had to respire an atmosphere, to\nbreathe, and let us be very ingenious in our little calculations. It is\ntime,\" said D'Artagnan, \"to form a plan of the campaign, and, according\nto the method of M. Turenne, who has a large head full of all sorts of\ngood counsels, before the plan of the campaign it is advisable to draw\na striking portrait of the generals to whom we are opposed. In the first\nplace, M. Fouquet presents himself. What is M. Fouquet? M. Fouquet,\"\nreplied D'Artagnan to himself, \"is a handsome man, very much beloved by\nthe women, a generous man very much beloved by the poets; a man of wit,\nmuch execrated by pretenders. Well, now I am neither woman, poet, nor\npretender: I neither love not hate monsieur le surintendant. I find\nmyself, therefore, in the same position in which M. Turenne found\nhimself when opposed to the Prince de Conde at Jargeau, Gien and the\nFaubourg Saint-Antoine. He did not execrate monsieur le prince, it is\ntrue, but he obeyed the king. Monsieur le prince is an agreeable man,\nbut the king is king. Turenne heaved a deep sigh, called Conde 'My\ncousin,' and swept away his army. Now what does the king wish? That\ndoes not concern me. Now, what does M. Colbert wish? Oh, that's another\nthing. M. Colbert wishes all that M. Fouquet does not wish. Then what\ndoes M. Fouquet wish? Oh, that is serious. M. Fouquet wishes precisely\nfor all the king wishes.\"\n\nThis monologue ended, D'Artagnan began to laugh, whilst making his whip\nwhistle in the air. He was already on the high road, frightening the\nbirds in the hedges, listening to the livres chinking and dancing in his\nleather pocket, at every step; and, let us confess it, every time that\nD'Artagnan found himself in such conditions, tenderness was not his\ndominant vice. \"Come,\" said he, \"I cannot think the expedition a very\ndangerous one; and it will fall out with my voyage as with that piece\nM. Monk took me to see in London, which was called, I think, 'Much Ado\nabout Nothing.'\"\n\n\n\nChapter LXVI. The Journey.\n\nIt was perhaps the fiftieth time since the day on which we open this\nhistory, that this man, with a heart of bronze and muscles of steel, had\nleft house and friends, everything, in short, to go in search of fortune\nand death. The one--that is to say, death--had constantly retreated\nbefore him, as if afraid of him; the other--that is to say, fortune--for\nonly a month past had really made an alliance with him. Although he\nwas not a great philosopher, after the fashion of either Epicurus\nor Socrates, he was a powerful spirit, having knowledge of life, and\nendowed with thought. No one is as brave, as adventurous, or as\nskillful as D'Artagnan, without at the same time being inclined to be\na _dreamer_. He had picked up, here and there, some scraps of M. de\nla Rochefoucault, worthy of being translated into Latin by MM. de Port\nRoyal; and he had made a collection, _en passant_, in the society of\nAthos and Aramis, of many morsels of Seneca and Cicero, translated by\nthem, and applied to the uses of common life. That contempt of riches\nwhich our Gascon had observed as an article of faith during the\nthirty-five first years of his life, had for a long time been considered\nby him as the first article of the code of bravery. \"Article first,\"\nsaid he, \"A man is brave because he has nothing. A man has nothing\nbecause he despises riches.\" Therefore, with these principles, which,\nas we have said, had regulated the thirty-five first years of his life,\nD'Artagnan was no sooner possessed of riches, than he felt it necessary\nto ask himself if, in spite of his riches, he were still brave. To this,\nfor any other but D'Artagnan, the events of the Place de Greve might\nhave served as a reply. Many consciences would have been satisfied\nwith them, but D'Artagnan was brave enough to ask himself sincerely and\nconscientiously if he were brave. Therefore to this:--\n\n\"But it appears to me that I drew promptly enough, and cut and thrust\npretty freely on the Place de Greve, to be satisfied of my bravery,\"\nD'Artagnan had himself replied. \"Gently, captain, that is not an answer.\nI was brave that day, because they were burning my house, and there\nare a hundred, and even a thousand, to speak against one, that if those\ngentlemen of the riots had not formed that unlucky idea, their plan of\nattack would have succeeded, or, at least, it would not have been I who\nwould have opposed myself to it. Now, what will be brought against me? I\nhave no house to be burnt in Bretagne; I have no treasure there that\ncan be taken from me.--No; but I have my skin; that precious skin of M.\nd'Artagnan, which to him is worth more than all the houses and all the\ntreasures of the world. That skin to which I cling above everything,\nbecause it is, everything considered, the binding of a body which\nencloses a heart very warm and ready to fight, and, consequently, to\nlive. Then, I do desire to live: and, in reality, I live much better,\nmore completely, since I have become rich. Who the devil ever said that\nmoney spoiled life? Upon my soul, it is no such thing, on the contrary,\nit seems as if I absorbed a double quantity of air and sun. _Mordioux!_\nwhat will it be then, if I double that fortune; and if, instead of\nthe switch I now hold in my hand, I should ever carry the baton of a\nmarechal? Then I really don't know if there will be, from that moment,\nenough of air and sun for me. In fact, this is not a dream, who the\ndevil would oppose it, if the king made me a marechal, as his father,\nKing Louis XIII., made a duke and constable of Albert de Luynes? Am I\nnot as brave, and much more intelligent, than that imbecile De Vitry?\nAh! that's exactly what will prevent my advancement: I have too much\nwit. Luckily, if there is any justice in this world, fortune owes me\nmany compensations. She owes me certainly a recompense for all I did for\nAnne of Austria, and an indemnification for all she has not done for me.\nThen, at the present, I am very well with a king, and with a king who\nhas the appearance of determining to reign. May God keep him in that\nillustrious road! For, if he is resolved to reign, he will want me;\nand if he wants me, he will give me what he has promised me--warmth and\nlight; so that I march, comparatively, now, as I marched formerly,--from\nnothing to everything. Only the nothing of to-day is the all of former\ndays; there has only this little change taken place in my life. And\nnow let us see! let us take the part of the heart, as I just now was\nspeaking of it. But in truth, I only spoke of it from memory.\" And the\nGascon applied his hand to his breast, as if he were actually seeking\nthe place where his heart was.\n\n\"Ah! wretch!\" murmured he, smiling with bitterness. \"Ah! poor mortal\nspecies! You hoped, for an instant, that you had not a heart, and now\nyou find you have one--bad courtier as thou art,--and even one of the\nmost seditious. You have a heart which speaks to you in favor of M.\nFouquet. And what is M. Fouquet, when the king is in question?--A\nconspirator, a real conspirator, who did not even give himself the\ntrouble to conceal his being a conspirator; therefore, what a weapon\nwould you not have against him, if his good grace, and his intelligence\nhad not made a scabbard for that weapon. An armed revolt!--for, in fact,\nM. Fouquet has been guilty of an armed revolt. Thus, while the king\nvaguely suspects M. Fouquet of rebellion, I know it--I could prove\nthat M. Fouquet had caused the shedding of the blood of his majesty's\nsubjects. Now, then, let us see. Knowing all that, and holding my\ntongue, what further would this heart wish in return for a kind action\nof M. Fouquet's, for an advance of fifteen thousand livres, for a\ndiamond worth a thousand pistoles, for a smile in which there was as\nmuch bitterness as kindness?--I save his life.\"\n\n\"Now, then, I hope,\" continued the musketeer, \"that this imbecile of\na heart is going to preserve silence, and so be fairly quits with M.\nFouquet. Now, then, the king becomes my sun, and as my heart is quits\nwith M. Fouquet, let him beware who places himself between me and my\nsun! Forward, for his majesty Louis XIV.!--Forward!\"\n\nThese reflections were the only impediments which were able to retard\nthe progress of D'Artagnan. These reflections once made, he increased\nthe speed of his horse. But, however perfect his horse Zephyr might\nbe, it could not hold out at such a pace forever. The day after his\ndeparture from Paris, his mount was left at Chartres, at the house of an\nold friend D'Artagnan had met with in an _hotelier_ of that city. From\nthat moment the musketeer travelled on post-horses. Thanks to this\nmode of locomotion, he traversed the space separating Chartres from\nChateaubriand. In the last of these two cities, far enough from the\ncoast to prevent any one guessing that D'Artagnan wished to reach the\nsea--far enough from Paris to prevent all suspicion of his being a\nmessenger from Louis XIV., whom D'Artagnan had called his sun, without\nsuspecting that he who was only at present a rather poor star in the\nheaven of royalty, would, one day, make that star his emblem; the\nmessenger of Louis XIV., we say, quitted his post and purchased a\n_bidet_ of the meanest appearance,--one of those animals which an\nofficer of the cavalry would never choose, for fear of being disgraced.\nExcepting the color, this new acquisition recalled to the mind of\nD'Artagnan the famous orange-colored horse, with which, or rather upon\nwhich, he had made his first appearance in the world. Truth to say, from\nthe moment he crossed this new steed, it was no longer D'Artagnan\nwho was travelling,--it was a good man clothed in an iron-gray\n_justaucorps_, brown _haut-de-chausses_, holding the medium between a\npriest and a layman; that which brought him nearest to the churchman\nwas, that D'Artagnan had placed on his head a _calotte_ of threadbare\nvelvet, and over the _calotte_, a large black hat; no more sword, a\nstick hung by a cord to his wrist, but to which, he promised himself,\nas an unexpected auxiliary, to join, upon occasion, a good dagger,\nten inches long, concealed under his cloak. The _bidet_ purchased at\nChateaubriand completed the metamorphosis; it was called, or rather\nD'Artagnan called if, Furet (ferret).\n\n\"If I have changed Zephyr into Furet,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I must make\nsome diminutive or other of my own name. So, instead of D'Artagnan, I\nwill be Agnan, short; that is a concession which I naturally owe to my\ngray coat, my round hat, and my rusty _calotte_.\"\n\nMonsieur d'Artagnan traveled, then, pretty easily upon Furet, who\nambled like a true butter-woman's pad, and who, with his amble, managed\ncheerfully about twelve leagues a day, upon four spindle-shanks, of\nwhich the practiced eye of D'Artagnan had appreciated the strength and\nsafety beneath the thick mass of hair which covered them. Jogging\nalong, the traveler took notes, studied the country, which he traversed\nreserved and silent, ever seeking the most plausible pretext for\nreaching Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and for seeing everything without arousing\nsuspicion. In this manner, he was enabled to convince himself of the\nimportance the event assumed in proportion as he drew near to it. In\nthis remote country, in this ancient duchy of Bretagne, which was not\nFrance at that period, and is not so even now, the people knew nothing\nof the king of France. They not only did not know him, but were\nunwilling to know him. One face--a single one--floated visibly for them\nupon the political current. Their ancient dukes no longer ruled them;\ngovernment was a void--nothing more. In place of the sovereign duke,\nthe seigneurs of parishes reigned without control; and, above these\nseigneurs, God, who has never been forgotten in Bretagne. Among these\nsuzerains of chateaux and belfries, the most powerful, the richest,\nthe most popular, was M. Fouquet, seigneur of Belle-Isle. Even in\nthe country, even within sight of that mysterious isle, legends and\ntraditions consecrate its wonders. Every one might not penetrate it: the\nisle, of an extent of six leagues in length, and six in breadth, was\na seignorial property, which the people had for a long time respected,\ncovered as it was with the name of Retz, so redoubtable in the country.\nShortly after the erection of this seignory into a marquistate,\nBelle-Isle passed to M. Fouquet. The celebrity of the isle did not date\nfrom yesterday; its name, or rather its qualification, is traced back to\nthe remotest antiquity. The ancients called it Kalonese, from two\nGreek words, signifying beautiful isle. Thus, at a distance of eighteen\nhundred years, it had borne, in another idiom, the same name it still\nbears. There was, then, something in itself in this property of M.\nFouquet's, besides its position of six leagues off the coast of France;\na position which makes it a sovereign in its maritime solitude, like\na majestic ship which disdains roads, and proudly casts anchor in\nmid-ocean.\n\nD'Artagnan learnt all this without appearing the least in the world\nastonished. He also learnt the best way to get intelligence was to go\nto La Roche-Bernard, a tolerably important city at the mouth of the\nVilaine. Perhaps there he could embark; if not, crossing the salt\nmarshes, he would repair to Guerande or Le Croisic, to wait for an\nopportunity to cross over to Belle-Isle. He had discovered, besides,\nsince his departure from Chateaubriand, that nothing would be impossible\nfor Furet under the impulsion of M. Agnan, and nothing to M. Agnan\nthrough the initiative of Furet. He prepared, then, to sup off a teal\nand a _torteau_, in a hotel of La Roche-Bernard, and ordered to be\nbrought from the cellar, to wash down these two Breton dishes, some\ncider, which, the moment it touched his lips, he perceived to be more\nBreton still.\n\n\n\nChapter LXVII. How D'Artagnan became Acquainted with a Poet, who had\nturned Printer for the Sake of Printing his own Verses.\n\nBefore taking his place at table, D'Artagnan acquired, as was his\ncustom, all the information he could; but it is an axiom of curiosity,\nthat every man who wishes to question well and fruitfully ought in the\nfirst place to lay himself open to questions. D'Artagnan sought, then,\nwith his usual skill, a promising questioner in the hostelry of La\nRoche-Bernard. At the moment, there were in the house, on the first\nstory, two travelers either preparing for supper, or at supper itself.\nD'Artagnan had seen their nags in the stable, and their equipages in\nthe _salle_. One traveled with a lackey, undoubtedly a person of\nconsideration;--two Perche mares, sleek, sound beasts, were suitable\nmeans of locomotion. The other, a little fellow, a traveler of meagre\nappearance, wearing a dusty surtout, dirty linen, and boots more worn by\nthe pavement than the stirrup, had come from Nantes with a cart drawn\nby a horse so like Furet in color, that D'Artagnan might have gone a\nhundred miles without finding a better match. This cart contained divers\nlarge packets wrapped in pieces of old stuff.\n\n\"That traveler yonder,\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"is the man for my\nmoney. He will do, he suits me; I ought to do for him and suit him; M.\nAgnan, with the gray doublet and the rusty _calotte_, is not unworthy of\nsupping with the gentleman of the old boots and still older horse.\"\n\nThis said, D'Artagnan called the host, and desired him to send his\nteal, _tourteau_, and cider up to the chamber of the gentleman of modest\nexterior. He himself climbed, a plate in his hand, the wooden staircase\nwhich led to the chamber, and began to knock at the door.\n\n\"Come in!\" said the unknown. D'Artagnan entered, with a simper on his\nlips, his plate under his arm, his hat in one hand, his candle in the\nother.\n\n\"Excuse me, monsieur,\" said he, \"I am as you are, a traveler; I know no\none in the hotel, and I have the bad habit of losing my spirits when\nI eat alone; so that my repast appears a bad one to me, and does not\nnourish me. Your face, which I saw just now, when you came down to\nhave some oysters opened,--your face pleased me much. Besides, I have\nobserved you have a horse just like mine, and that the host, no doubt on\naccount of that resemblance, has placed them side by side in the\nstable, where they appear to agree amazingly well together. I therefore,\nmonsieur, do not see any reason why the masters should be separated when\nthe horses are united. Accordingly, I am come to request the pleasure\nof being admitted to your table. My name is Agnan, at your service,\nmonsieur, the unworthy steward of a rich seigneur, who wishes to\npurchase some salt-mines in this country, and sends me to examine his\nfuture acquisitions. In truth, monsieur, I should be well pleased if\nmy countenance were as agreeable to you as yours is to me; for, upon my\nhonor, I am quite at your service.\"\n\nThe stranger, whom D'Artagnan saw for the first time,--for before he\nhad only caught a glimpse of him,--the stranger had black and brilliant\neyes, a yellow complexion, a brow a little wrinkled by the weight of\nfifty years, _bonhomie_ in his features collectively, but some cunning\nin his look.\n\n\"One would say,\" thought D'Artagnan, \"that this merry fellow has never\nexercised more than the upper part of his head, his eyes, and his\nbrain. He must be a man of science: his mouth, nose, and chin signify\nabsolutely nothing.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the latter, with whose mind and person we have been\nmaking so free, \"you do me much honor; not that I am ever _ennuye_,\nfor I have,\" added he, smiling, \"a company which amuses me always: but,\nnever mind that, I am happy to receive you.\" But when saying this, the\nman with the worn boots cast an uneasy look at his table, from which\nthe oysters had disappeared, and upon which there was nothing left but a\nmorsel of salt bacon.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" D'Artagnan hastened to say, \"the host is bringing me up a\npretty piece of roasted poultry and a superb _tourteau_.\" D'Artagnan had\nread in the look of his companion, however rapidly it disappeared, the\nfear of an attack by a parasite: he divined justly. At this opening,\nthe features of the man of modest exterior relaxed; and, as if he had\nwatched the moment for his entrance, as D'Artagnan spoke, the host\nappeared, bearing the announced dishes. The _tourteau_ and the teal were\nadded to the morsel of broiled bacon; D'Artagnan and his guest bowed,\nsat down opposite to each other, and, like two brothers, shared the\nbacon and the other dishes.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you must confess that association is a\nwonderful thing.\"\n\n\"How so?\" replied the stranger, with his mouth full.\n\n\"Well, I will tell you,\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\nThe stranger gave a short truce to the movement of his jaws, in order to\nhear the better.\n\n\"In the first place,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"instead of one candle,\nwhich each of us had, we have two.\"\n\n\"That is true!\" said the stranger, struck with the extreme lucidity of\nthe observation.\n\n\"Then I see that you eat my _tourteau_ in preference, whilst I, in\npreference, eat your bacon.\"\n\n\"That is true again.\"\n\n\"And then, in addition to being better lighted and eating what we\nprefer, I place the pleasure of your company.\"\n\n\"Truly, monsieur, you are very jovial,\" said the unknown, cheerfully.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; jovial, as all people are who carry nothing on their\nminds, or, for that matter, in their heads. Oh! I can see it is quite\nanother sort of thing with you,\" continued D'Artagnan; \"I can read in\nyour eyes all sorts of genius.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur!\"\n\n\"Come, confess one thing.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That you are a learned man.\"\n\n\"_Ma foi!_ monsieur.\"\n\n\"_Hein?_\"\n\n\"Almost.\"\n\n\"Come, then!\"\n\n\"I am an author.\"\n\n\"There!\" cried D'Artagnan, clapping his hands, \"I knew I could not be\ndeceived! It is a miracle!\"\n\n\"Monsieur--\"\n\n\"What, shall I have the honor of passing the evening in the society of\nan author, of a celebrated author, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the unknown, blushing, \"celebrated, monsieur, celebrated is\nnot the word.\"\n\n\"Modest!\" cried D'Artagnan, transported, \"he is modest!\" Then, turning\ntowards the stranger, with a character of blunt _bonhomie_: \"But tell\nme at least the name of your works, monsieur; for you will please to\nobserve you have not told me your name, and I have been forced to divine\nyour genius.\"\n\n\"My name is Jupenet, monsieur,\" said the author.\n\n\"A fine name! a grand name! upon my honor; and I do not know why--pardon\nme the mistake, if it be one--but surely I have heard that name\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"I have made verses,\" said the poet, modestly.\n\n\"Ah! that is it, then; I have heard them read.\"\n\n\"A tragedy.\"\n\n\"I must have seen it played.\"\n\nThe poet blushed again, and said: \"I do not think that can be the case,\nfor my verses have never been printed.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it must have been the tragedy which informed me of your\nname.\"\n\n\"You are again mistaken, for MM. the comedians of the Hotel de\nBourgogne, would have nothing to do with it,\" said the poet, with a\nsmile, the receipt for which certain sorts of pride alone knew the\nsecret. D'Artagnan bit his lips. \"Thus, then, you see, monsieur,\"\ncontinued the poet, \"you are in error on my account, and that not being\nat all known to you, you have never heard tell of me.\"\n\n\"Ah! that confounds me. That name, Jupenet, appears to me, nevertheless,\na fine name, and quite as worthy of being known as those of MM.\nCorneille, or Rotrou, or Garnier. I hope, monsieur, you will have the\ngoodness to repeat to me a part of your tragedy presently, by way of\ndessert, for instance. That will be sugared roast meat,--_mordioux!_ Ah!\npardon me, monsieur, that was a little oath which escaped me, because\nit is a habit with my lord and master. I sometimes allow myself to usurp\nthat little oath, as it seems in pretty good taste. I take this liberty\nonly in his absence, please to observe, for you may understand that in\nhis presence--but, in truth, monsieur, this cider is abominable; do you\nnot think so? And besides, the pot is of such an irregular shape it will\nnot stand on the table.\"\n\n\"Suppose we were to make it level?\"\n\n\"To be sure; but with what?\"\n\n\"With this knife.\"\n\n\"And the teal, with what shall we cut that up? Do you not, by chance,\nmean to touch the teal?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, then--\"\n\n\"Wait.\"\n\nAnd the poet rummaged in his pocket, and drew out a piece of brass,\noblong, quadrangular, about a line in thickness, and an inch and a half\nin length. But scarcely had this little piece of brass seen the light,\nthan the poet appeared to have committed an imprudence, and made a\nmovement to put it back again in his pocket. D'Artagnan perceived this,\nfor he was a man that nothing escaped. He stretched forth his hand\ntowards the piece of brass: \"Humph! that which you hold in your hand is\npretty; will you allow me to look at it?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the poet, who appeared to have yielded too soon to a\nfirst impulse. \"Certainly, you may look at it: but it will be in vain\nfor you to look at it,\" added he, with a satisfied air; \"if I were not\nto tell you its use, you would never guess it.\"\n\nD'Artagnan had seized as an avowal the hesitation of the poet, and\nhis eagerness to conceal the piece of brass which a first movement had\ninduced him to take out of his pocket. His attention, therefore, once\nawakened on this point, he surrounded himself with a circumspection\nwhich gave him a superiority on all occasions. Besides, whatever M.\nJupenet might say about it, by a simple inspection of the object, he\nperfectly well knew what it was. It was a character in printing.\n\n\"Can you guess, now, what this is?\" continued the poet.\n\n\"No,\" said D'Artagnan, \"no, _ma foi!_\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur,\" said M. Jupenet, \"this little piece of metal is a\nprinting letter.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"A capital.\"\n\n\"Stop, stop, stop,\" said D'Artagnan, opening his eyes very innocently.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, a capital; the first letter of my name.\"\n\n\"And this is a letter, is it?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, I will confess one thing to you.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"No, I will not, I was going to say something stupid.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Master Jupenet, with a patronizing air.\n\n\"Well, then, I cannot comprehend, if that is a letter, how you can make\na word.\"\n\n\"A word?\"\n\n\"Yes, a printed word.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's very easy.\"\n\n\"Let me see.\"\n\n\"Does it interest you?\"\n\n\"Enormously.\"\n\n\"Well, I will explain the thing to you. Attend.\"\n\n\"I am attending.\"\n\n\"This is it.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"Look attentively.\"\n\n\"I am looking.\" D'Artagnan, in fact, appeared absorbed in observations.\nJupenet drew from his pocket seven or eight other pieces of brass\nsmaller than the first.\n\n\"Ah, ah,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"You have, then, a whole printing-office in your pocket. _Peste!_ that\nis curious, indeed.\"\n\n\"Is it not?\"\n\n\"Good God, what a number of things we learn by traveling.\"\n\n\"To your health!\" said Jupenet, quite enchanted.\n\n\"To yours, _mordioux_, to yours. But--an instant--not in this cider. It\nis an abominable drink, unworthy of a man who quenches his thirst at the\nHippocrene fountain--is not it so you call your fountain, you poets?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, our fountain is so called. That comes from two Greek\nwords--_hippos_, which means a horse, and--\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" interrupted D'Artagnan, \"you shall drink of a liquor which\ncomes from one single French word, and is none the worse for that--from\nthe word _grape_; this cider gives me the heartburn. Allow me to inquire\nof your host if there is not a good bottle of Beaugency, or of the Ceran\ngrowth, at the back of the large bins in his cellar.\"\n\nThe host, being sent for, immediately attended.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" interrupted the poet, \"take care, we shall not have time to\ndrink the wine, unless we make great haste, for I must take advantage of\nthe tide to secure the boat.\"\n\n\"What boat?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Why the boat which sets out for Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"Ah--for Belle-Isle,\" said the musketeer, \"that is good.\"\n\n\"Bah! you will have plenty of time, monsieur,\" replied the _hotelier_,\nuncorking the bottle, \"the boat will not leave this hour.\"\n\n\"But who will give me notice?\" said the poet.\n\n\"Your fellow-traveler,\" replied the host.\n\n\"But I scarcely know him.\"\n\n\"When you hear him departing, it will be time for you to go.\"\n\n\"Is he going to Belle-Isle, likewise, then?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The traveler who has a lackey?\" asked D'Artagnan. \"He is some\ngentleman, no doubt?\"\n\n\"I know nothing of him.\"\n\n\"What!--know nothing of him?\"\n\n\"No, all I know is, that he is drinking the same wine as you.\"\n\n\"_Peste!_--that is a great honor for us,\" said D'Artagnan, filling his\ncompanion's glass, whilst the host went out.\n\n\"So,\" resumed the poet, returning to his dominant ideas, \"you never saw\nany printing done?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Well, then, take the letters thus, which compose the word, you see:\nA B; _ma foi!_ here is an R, two E E, then a G.\" And he assembled the\nletters with a swiftness and skill which did not escape the eye of\nD'Artagnan.\n\n\"_Abrege_,\" said he, as he ended.\n\n\"Good!\" said D'Artagnan; \"here are plenty of letters got together; but\nhow are they kept so?\" And he poured out a second glass for the poet.\nM. Jupenet smiled like a man who has an answer for everything; then he\npulled out--still from his pocket--a little metal ruler, composed of two\nparts, like a carpenter's rule, against which he put together, and in a\nline, the characters, holding them under his left thumb.\n\n\"And what do you call that little metal ruler?\" said D'Artagnan, \"for, I\nsuppose, all these things have names.\"\n\n\"This is called a composing-stick,\" said Jupenet; \"it is by the aid of\nthis stick that the lines are formed.\"\n\n\"Come, then, I was not mistaken in what I said; you have a press in your\npocket,\" said D'Artagnan, laughing with an air of simplicity so stupid,\nthat the poet was completely his dupe.\n\n\"No,\" replied he; \"but I am too lazy to write, and when I have a verse\nin my head, I print it immediately. That is a labor spared.\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" thought D'Artagnan to himself, \"this must be cleared up.\"\nAnd under a pretext, which did not embarrass the musketeer, who was\nfertile in expedients, he left the table, went downstairs, ran to the\nshed under which stood the poet's little cart, and poked the point of\nhis poniard into the stuff which enveloped one of the packages, which he\nfound full of types, like those which the poet had in his pocket.\n\n\"Humph!\" said D'Artagnan, \"I do not yet know whether M. Fouquet wishes\nto fortify Belle-Isle; but, at all events, here are some spiritual\nmunitions for the castle.\" Then, enchanted with his rich discovery, he\nran upstairs again, and resumed his place at the table.\n\nD'Artagnan had learnt what he wished to know. He, however, remained,\nnone the less, face to face with his partner, to the moment when they\nheard from the next room symptoms of a person's being about to go out.\nThe printer was immediately on foot; he had given orders for his horse\nto be got ready. His carriage was waiting at the door. The second\ntraveler got into his saddle, in the courtyard, with his lackey.\nD'Artagnan followed Jupenet to the door; he embarked his cart and horse\non board the boat. As to the opulent traveler, he did the same with\nhis two horses and servant. But all the wit D'Artagnan employed in\nendeavoring to find out his name was lost--he could learn nothing. Only\nhe took such notice of his countenance, that it was impressed upon his\nmind forever. D'Artagnan had a great inclination to embark with the\ntwo travelers, but an interest more powerful than curiosity--that of\nsuccess--repelled him from the shore, and brought him back again to the\nhostelry. He entered with a sigh, and went to bed directly in order to\nbe ready early in the morning with fresh ideas and the sage counsel of\nsufficing sleep.\n\n\n\nChapter LXVIII. D'Artagnan continues his Investigations.\n\nAt daybreak D'Artagnan saddled Furet, who had fared sumptuously\nall night, devouring the remainder of the oats and hay left by his\ncompanions. The musketeer sifted all he possibly could out of the host,\nwho he found cunning, mistrustful, and devoted, body and soul, to M.\nFouquet. In order not to awaken the suspicions of this man, he carried\non his fable of being a probable purchaser of some salt-mines. To have\nembarked for Belle-Isle at Roche-Bernard, would have been to expose\nhimself still further to comments which had, perhaps, been already made,\nand would be carried to the castle. Moreover, it was singular that this\ntraveler and his lackey should have remained a mystery to D'Artagnan, in\nspite of all the questions addressed by him to the host, who appeared\nto know him perfectly well. The musketeer then made some inquiries\nconcerning the salt-mines, and took the road to the marshes, leaving\nthe sea on his right, and penetrating into that vast and desolate plain\nwhich resembles a sea of mud, of which, here and there, a few crests\nof salt silver the undulations. Furet walked admirably, with his\nlittle nervous legs, along the foot-wide causeways which separate the\nsalt-mines. D'Artagnan, aware of the consequences of a fall, which would\nresult in a cold bath, allowed him to go as he liked, contenting\nhimself with looking at, on the horizon, three rocks, that rose up like\nlance-blades from the bosom of the plain, destitute of verdure. Piriac,\nthe bourgs of Batz and Le Croisic, exactly resembling each other,\nattracted and suspended his attention. If the traveler turned round, the\nbetter to make his observations, he saw on the other side an horizon of\nthree other steeples, Guerande, Le Pouliguen, and Saint-Joachim, which,\nin their circumference, represented a set of skittles, of which he and\nFuret were but the wandering ball. Piriac was the first little port on\nhis right. He went thither, with the names of the principal salters on\nhis lips. At the moment he reached the little port of Piriac, five\nlarge barges, laden with stone, were leaving it. It appeared strange\nto D'Artagnan, that stones should be leaving a country where none are\nfound. He had recourse to all the amenity of M. Agnan to learn from\nthe people of the port the cause of this singular arrangement. An old\nfisherman replied to M. Agnan, that the stones very certainly did not\ncome from Piriac or the marshes.\n\n\"Where do they come from, then?\" asked the musketeer.\n\n\"Monsieur, they come from Nantes and Paimboeuf.\"\n\n\"Where are they going, then?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, to Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said D'Artagnan, in the same tone he had assumed to tell\nthe printer that his character interested him; \"are they building at\nBelle-Isle, then?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, monsieur, M. Fouquet has the walls of the castle repaired\nevery year.\"\n\n\"It is in ruins, then?\"\n\n\"It is old.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"nothing is more natural;\nevery proprietor has a right to repair his own property. It would be\nlike telling me I was fortifying the Image-de-Notre-Dame, when I was\nsimply obliged to make repairs. In good truth, I believe false reports\nhave been made to his majesty, and he is very likely to be in the\nwrong.\"\n\n\"You must confess,\" continued he then, aloud, and addressing the\nfisherman--for his part of a suspicious man was imposed upon him by the\nobject even of his mission--\"you must confess, my dear monsieur, that\nthese stones travel in a very curious fashion.\"\n\n\"How so?\" said the fisherman.\n\n\"They come from Nantes or Paimboeuf by the Loire, do they not?\"\n\n\"With the tide.\"\n\n\"That is convenient,--I don't say it is not; but why do they not go\nstraight from Saint-Nazaire to Belle-Isle?\"\n\n\"Eh! because the _chalands_ (barges) are fresh-water boats, and take the\nsea badly,\" replied the fisherman.\n\n\"That is not sufficient reason.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, monsieur, one may see that you have never been a sailor,\"\nadded the fisherman, not without a sort of disdain.\n\n\"Explain to me, if you please, my good man. It appears to me that to\ncome from Paimboeuf to Piriac, and go from Piriac to Belle-Isle, is as\nif we went from Roche-Bernard to Nantes, and from Nantes to Piriac.\"\n\n\"By water that would be the nearest way,\" replied the fisherman\nimperturbably.\n\n\"But there is an elbow?\"\n\nThe fisherman shook his head.\n\n\"The shortest road from one place to another is a straight line,\"\ncontinued D'Artagnan.\n\n\"You forget the tide, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well! take the tide.\"\n\n\"And the wind.\"\n\n\"Well, and the wind.\"\n\n\"Without doubt; the current of the Loire carries barks almost as far as\nCroisic. If they want to lie by a little, or to refresh the crew, they\ncome to Piriac along the coast; from Piriac they find another inverse\ncurrent, which carries them to the Isle-Dumal, two leagues and a half.\"\n\n\"Granted.\"\n\n\"There the current of the Vilaine throws them upon another isle, the\nIsle of Hoedic.\"\n\n\"I agree with that.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, from that isle to Belle-Isle the way is quite straight.\nThe sea, broken both above and below, passes like a canal--like a mirror\nbetween the two isles; the _chalands_ glide along upon it like ducks\nupon the Loire; that's how it is.\"\n\n\"It does not signify,\" said the obstinate M. Agnan; \"it is a long way\nround.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes; but M. Fouquet will have it so,\" replied, as conclusive,\nthe fisherman, taking off his woolen cap at the enunciation of that\nrespected name.\n\nA look from D'Artagnan, a look as keen and piercing as a sword-blade,\nfound nothing in the heart of the old man but a simple confidence--on\nhis features, nothing but satisfaction and indifference. He said, \"M.\nFouquet will have it so,\" as he would have said, \"God has willed it.\"\n\nD'Artagnan had already advanced too far in this direction; besides, the\n_chalands_ being gone, there remained nothing at Piriac but a single\nbark--that of the old man, and it did not look fit for sea without great\npreparation. D'Artagnan therefore patted Furet, who, as a new proof\nof his charming character, resumed his march with his feet in the\nsalt-mines, and his nose to the dry wind, which bends the furze and the\nbroom of this country. They reached Le Croisic about five o'clock.\n\nIf D'Artagnan had been a poet, it was a beautiful spectacle: the immense\nstrand of a league or more, the sea covers at high tide, and which, at\nthe reflux, appears gray and desolate, strewed with polypi and seaweed,\nwith pebbles sparse and white, like bones in some vast old cemetery. But\nthe soldier, the politician, and the ambitious man, had no longer the\nsweet consolation of looking towards heaven to read there a hope or\na warning. A red sky signifies nothing to such people but wind and\ndisturbance. White and fleecy clouds upon the azure only say that the\nsea will be smooth and peaceful. D'Artagnan found the sky blue, the\nbreeze embalmed with saline perfumes, and he said: \"I will embark with\nthe first tide, if it be but in a nutshell.\"\n\nAt Le Croisic as at Piriac, he had remarked enormous heaps of stone\nlying along the shore. These gigantic walls, diminished every tide\nby the barges for Belle-Isle, were, in the eyes of the musketeer, the\nconsequence and the proof of what he had well divined at Piriac. Was it\na wall that M. Fouquet was constructing? Was it a fortification that\nhe was erecting? To ascertain that, he must make fuller observations.\nD'Artagnan put Furet into a stable; supped, went to bed, and on the\nmorrow took a walk upon the port or rather upon the shingle. Le Croisic\nhas a port of fifty feet; it has a look-out which resembles an enormous\n_brioche_ (a kind of cake) elevated on a dish. The flat strand is the\ndish. Hundreds of barrowsful of earth amalgamated with pebbles, and\nrounded into cones, with sinuous passages between, are look-outs and\n_brioches_ at the same time. It is so now, and it was so two hundred\nyears ago, only the _brioche_ was not so large, and probably there were\nto be seen to trellises of lath around the _brioche_, which constitute\nan ornament, planted like _gardes-fous_ along the passages that wind\ntowards the little terrace. Upon the shingle lounged three or four\nfishermen talking about sardines and shrimps. D'Artagnan, with his eyes\nanimated by a rough gayety, and a smile upon his lips, approached these\nfishermen.\n\n\"Any fishing going on to-day?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied one of them, \"we are only waiting for the\ntide.\"\n\n\"Where do you fish, my friends?\"\n\n\"Upon the coasts, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Which are the best coasts?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is all according. The tour of the isles, for example?\"\n\n\"Yes, but they are a long way off, those isles, are they not?\"\n\n\"Not very; four leagues.\"\n\n\"Four leagues! That is a voyage.\"\n\nThe fishermen laughed in M. Agnan's face.\n\n\"Hear me, then,\" said the latter with an air of simple stupidity; \"four\nleagues off you lose sight of land, do you not?\"\n\n\"Why, not always.\"\n\n\"Ah, it is a long way--too long, or else I would have asked you to take\nme aboard, and to show me what I have never seen.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"A live sea-fish.\"\n\n\"Monsieur comes from the province?\" said a fisherman.\n\n\"Yes, I come from Paris.\"\n\nThe Breton shrugged his shoulders; then:\n\n\"Have you ever seen M. Fouquet in Paris?\" asked he.\n\n\"Often,\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Often!\" repeated the fishermen, closing their circle round the\nParisian. \"Do you know him?\"\n\n\"A little; he is the intimate friend of my master.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the fishermen, in astonishment.\n\n\"And,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I have seen all his chateaux of Saint Mande, of\nVaux, and his hotel in Paris.\"\n\n\"Is that a fine place?\"\n\n\"Superb.\"\n\n\"It is not so fine a place as Belle-Isle,\" said the fisherman.\n\n\"Bah!\" cried M. d'Artagnan, breaking into a laugh so loud that he\nangered all his auditors.\n\n\"It is very plain that you have never seen Belle-Isle,\" said the most\ncurious of the fishermen. \"Do you know that there are six leagues of\nit, and that there are such trees on it as cannot be equaled even at\nNates-sur-le-Fosse?\"\n\n\"Trees in the sea!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"well, I should like to see them.\"\n\n\"That can be easily done; we are fishing at the Isle de Hoedic--come\nwith us. From that place you will see, as a Paradise, the black trees of\nBelle-Isle against the sky; you will see the white line of the castle,\nwhich cuts the horizon of the sea like a blade.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that must be very beautiful. But do you know\nthere are a hundred belfries at M. Fouquet's chateau of Vaux?\"\n\nThe Breton raised his head in profound admiration, but he was not\nconvinced. \"A hundred belfries! Ah, that may be; but Belle-Isle is finer\nthan that. Should you like to see Belle-Isle?\"\n\n\"Is that possible?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, with permission of the governor.\"\n\n\"But I do not know the governor.\"\n\n\"As you know M. Fouquet, you can tell your name.\"\n\n\"Oh, my friends, I am not a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Everybody enters Belle-Isle,\" continued the fisherman in his strong,\npure language, \"provided he means no harm to Belle-Isle or its master.\"\n\nA slight shudder crept over the body of the musketeer. \"That is true,\"\nthought he. Then recovering himself, \"If I were sure,\" said he, \"not to\nbe sea-sick.\"\n\n\"What, upon _her?_\" said the fisherman, pointing with pride to his\npretty round-bottomed bark.\n\n\"Well, you almost persuade me,\" cried M. Agnan; \"I will go and see\nBelle-Isle, but they will not admit me.\"\n\n\"We shall enter, safe enough.\"\n\n\"You! What for?\"\n\n\"Why, _dame!_ to sell fish to the corsairs.\"\n\n\"Ha! Corsairs--what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, I mean that M. Fouquet is having two corsairs built to chase the\nDutch and the English, and we sell our fish to the crews of those little\nvessels.\"\n\n\"Come, come!\" said D'Artagnan to himself--\"better and better. A\nprinting-press, bastions, and corsairs! Well, M. Fouquet is not an\nenemy to be despised, as I presumed to fancy. He is worth the trouble of\ntravelling to see him nearer.\"\n\n\"We set out at half-past five,\" said the fisherman gravely.\n\n\"I am quite ready, and I will not leave you now.\" So D'Artagnan saw the\nfishermen haul their barks to meet the tide with a windlass. The sea\nrose; M. Agnan allowed himself to be hoisted on board, not without\nsporting a little fear and awkwardness, to the amusement of the young\nbeach-urchins who watched him with their large intelligent eyes. He laid\nhimself down upon a folded sail, not interfering with anything whilst\nthe bark prepared for sea; and, with its large square sail, it was\nfairly out within two hours. The fishermen, who prosecuted their\noccupation as they proceeded, did not perceive that their passenger had\nnot become pale, neither groaned nor suffered; that in spite of that\nhorrible tossing and rolling of the bark, to which no hand imparted\ndirection, the novice passenger had preserved his presence of mind and\nhis appetite. They fished, and their fishing was sufficiently fortunate.\nTo lines bated with prawn, soles came, with numerous gambols, to bite.\nTwo nets had already been broken by the immense weight of congers and\nhaddocks; three sea-eels plowed the hold with their slimy folds and\ntheir dying contortions. D'Artagnan brought them good luck; they told\nhim so. The soldier found the occupation so pleasant, that he put his\nhand to the work--that is to say, to the lines--and uttered roars of\njoy, and _mordioux_ enough to have astonished his musketeers themselves,\nevery time that a shock given to his line by the captured fish required\nthe play of the muscles of his arm, and the employment of his best\ndexterity. The party of pleasure had made him forget his diplomatic\nmission. He was struggling with a very large conger, and holding fast\nwith one hand to the side of the vessel, in order to seize with the\nother the gaping jowl of his antagonist, when the master said to him,\n\"Take care they don't see you from Belle-Isle!\"\n\nThese words produced the same effect upon D'Artagnan as the hissing of\nthe first bullet on a day of battle; he let go of both line and conger,\nwhich, dragging each other, returned again to the water. D'Artagnan\nperceived, within half a league at most, the blue and marked profile\nof the rocks of Belle-Isle, dominated by the majestic whiteness of the\ncastle. In the distance, the land with its forests and verdant plains;\ncattle on the grass. This was what first attracted the attention of\nthe musketeer. The sun darted its rays of gold upon the sea, raising\na shining mist round this enchanted isle. Little could be seen of it,\nowing to this dazzling light, but the salient points; every shadow was\nstrongly marked, and cut with bands of darkness the luminous fields and\nwalls. \"Eh! eh!\" said D'Artagnan, at the aspect of those masses of\nblack rocks, \"these are fortifications which do not stand in need of any\nengineer to render a landing difficult. How the devil can a landing be\neffected on that isle which God has defended so completely?\"\n\n\"This way,\" replied the patron of the bark, changing the sail, and\nimpressing upon the rudder a twist which turned the boat in the\ndirection of a pretty little port, quite coquettish, round, and newly\nbattlemented.\n\n\"What the devil do I see yonder?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"You see Locmaria,\" replied the fisherman.\n\n\"Well, but there?\"\n\n\"That is Bangor.\"\n\n\"And further on?\"\n\n\"Sauzon, and then Le Palais.\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_ It is a world. Ah! there are some soldiers.\"\n\n\"There are seventeen hundred men in Belle-Isle, monsieur,\" replied the\nfisherman, proudly. \"Do you know that the least garrison is of twenty\ncompanies of infantry?\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" cried D'Artagnan, stamping with his foot. \"His majesty was\nright enough.\"\n\nThey landed.\n\n\n\nChapter LXIX. In which the Reader, no Doubt, will be as astonished as\nD'Artagnan was to meet an Old Acquaintance.\n\nThere is always something in a landing, if it be only from the smallest\nsea-boat--a trouble and a confusion which do not leave the mind the\nliberty of which it stands in need in order to study at the first glance\nthe new locality presented to it. The moveable bridges, the agitated\nsailors, the noise of the water on the pebbles, the cries and\nimportunities of those who wait upon the shores, are multiplied details\nof that sensation which is summed up in one single result--hesitation.\nIt was not, then, till after standing several minutes on the shore that\nD'Artagnan saw upon the port, but more particularly in the interior of\nthe isle, an immense number of workmen in motion. At his feet D'Artagnan\nrecognized the five _chalands_ laden with rough stone he had seen leave\nthe port of Piriac. The smaller stones were transported to the shore\nby means of a chain formed by twenty-five or thirty peasants. The large\nstones were loaded on trollies which conveyed them in the same direction\nas the others, that is to say, towards the works, of which D'Artagnan\ncould as yet appreciate neither the strength nor the extent. Everywhere\nwas to be seen an activity equal to that which Telemachus observed\non his landing at Salentum. D'Artagnan felt a strong inclination to\npenetrate into the interior; but he could not, under the penalty of\nexciting mistrust, exhibit too much curiosity. He advanced then little\nby little, scarcely going beyond the line formed by the fishermen on the\nbeach, observing everything, saying nothing, and meeting all suspicion\nthat might have been excited with a half-silly question or a polite bow.\nAnd yet, whilst his companions carried on their trade, giving or selling\ntheir fish to the workmen or the inhabitants of the city, D'Artagnan had\ngained by degrees, and, reassured by the little attention paid to him,\nhe began to cast an intelligent and confident look upon the men and\nthings that appeared before his eyes. And his very first glance fell on\ncertain movements of earth about which the eye of a soldier could not be\nmistaken. At the two extremities of the port, in order that their fires\nshould converge upon the great axis of the ellipse formed by the basin,\nin the first place, two batteries had been raised, evidently destined\nto receive flank pieces, for D'Artagnan saw the workmen finishing the\nplatform and making ready the demi-circumference in wood upon which\nthe wheels of the pieces might turn to embrace every direction over the\nepaulement. By the side of each of these batteries other workmen were\nstrengthening gabions filled with earth, the lining of another battery.\nThe latter had embrasures, and the overseer of the works called\nsuccessively men who, with cords, tied the _saucissons_ and cut the\nlozenges and right angles of turfs destined to retain the matting of\nthe embrasures. By the activity displayed in these works, already so\nfar advanced, they might be considered as finished: they were not yet\nfurnished with their cannons, but the platforms had their _gites_\nand their _madriers_ all prepared; the earth, beaten carefully, was\nconsolidated; and supposing the artillery to be on the island, in less\nthan two or three days the port might be completely armed. That which\nastonished D'Artagnan, when he turned his eyes from the coast batteries\nto the fortifications of the city, was to see that Belle-Isle was\ndefended by an entirely new system, of which he had often heard the\nComte de la Fere speak as a wonderful advance, but of which he had as\nyet never seen the application. These fortifications belonged neither to\nthe Dutch method of Marollais, nor to the French method of the Chevalier\nAntoine de Ville, but to the system of Manesson Mallet, a skillful\nengineer, who about six or eight years previously had quitted the\nservice of Portugal to enter that of France. The works had this\npeculiarity, that instead of rising above the earth, as did the\nancient ramparts destined to defend a city from escalades, they, on the\ncontrary, sank into it; and what created the height of the walls was the\ndepth of the ditches. It did not take long to make D'Artagnan perceive\nthe superiority of such a system, which gives no advantage to cannon.\nBesides, as the _fosses_ were lower than, or on a level with, the sea,\nthese _fosses_ could be instantly inundated by means of subterranean\nsluices. Otherwise, the works were almost complete, and a group of\nworkmen, receiving orders from a man who appeared to be conductor of\nthe works, were occupied in placing the last stones. A bridge of planks\nthrown over the _fosses_ for the greater convenience of the maneuvers\nconnected with the barrows, joined the interior to the exterior. With\nan air of simple curiosity D'Artagnan asked if he might be permitted\nto cross the bridge, and he was told that no order prevented it.\nConsequently he crossed the bridge, and advanced towards the group.\n\nThis group was superintended by the man whom D'Artagnan had already\nremarked, and who appeared to be the engineer-in-chief. A plan was lying\nopen before him upon a large stone forming a table, and at some paces\nfrom him a crane was in action. This engineer, who by his evident\nimportance first attracted the attention of D'Artagnan, wore a\n_justaucorps_, which, from its sumptuousness, was scarcely in harmony\nwith the work he was employed in, that rather necessitated the costume\nof a master-mason than of a noble. He was a man of immense stature\nand great square shoulders, and wore a hat covered with feathers. He\ngesticulated in the most majestic manner, and appeared, for D'Artagnan\nonly saw his back, to be scolding the workmen for their idleness and\nwant of strength.\n\nD'Artagnan continued to draw nearer. At that moment the man with the\nfeathers ceased to gesticulate, and, with his hands placed upon his\nknees, was following, half-bent, the effort of six workmen to raise a\nblock of hewn stone to the top of a piece of timber destined to support\nthat stone, so that the cord of the crane might be passed under it. The\nsix men, all on one side of the stone, united their efforts to raise it\nto eight or ten inches from the ground, sweating and blowing, whilst a\nseventh got ready for when there should be daylight enough beneath it\nto slide in the roller that was to support it. But the stone had already\ntwice escaped from their hands before gaining a sufficient height for\nthe roller to be introduced. There can be no doubt that every time the\nstone escaped them, they bounded quickly backwards, to keep their\nfeet from being crushed by the refalling stone. Every time, the stone,\nabandoned by them, sunk deeper into the damp earth, which rendered the\noperation more and more difficult. A third effort was followed by no\nbetter success, but with progressive discouragement. And yet, when\nthe six men were bent towards the stone, the man with the feathers had\nhimself, with a powerful voice, given the word of command, \"_Ferme!_\"\nwhich regulates maneuvers of strength. Then he drew himself up.\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said he, \"what is this all about? Have I to do with men of\nstraw? _Corne de boeuf!_ stand on one side, and you shall see how this\nis to be done.\"\n\n\"_Peste!_\" said D'Artagnan, \"will he pretend to raise that rock? that\nwould be a sight worth looking at.\"\n\nThe workmen, as commanded by the engineer, drew back with their ears\ndown, and shaking their heads, with the exception of the one who held\nthe plank, who prepared to perform the office. The man with the feathers\nwent up to the stone, stooped, slipped his hands under the face lying\nupon the ground, stiffened his Herculean muscles, and without a strain,\nwith a slow motion, like that of a machine, lifted the end of the rock\na foot from the ground. The workman who held the plank profited by the\nspace thus given him, and slipped the roller under the stone.\n\n\"That's the way,\" said the giant, not letting the rock fall again, but\nplacing it upon its support.\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" cried D'Artagnan, \"I know but one man capable of such a\nfeat of strength.\"\n\n\"_Hein!_\" cried the colossus, turning round.\n\n\"Porthos!\" murmured D'Artagnan, seized with stupor, \"Porthos at\nBelle-Isle!\"\n\nOn his part, the man with the feathers fixed his eyes upon the disguised\nlieutenant, and, in spite of his metamorphosis, recognized him.\n\"D'Artagnan!\" cried he; and the color mounted to his face. \"Hush!\" said\nhe to D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Hush!\" in his turn, said the musketeer. In fact, if Porthos had just\nbeen discovered by D'Artagnan, D'Artagnan had just been discovered by\nPorthos. The interest of the particular secret of each struck them both\nat the same instant. Nevertheless the first movement of the two men was\nto throw their arms around each other. What they wished to conceal from\nthe bystanders, was not their friendship, but their names. But, after\nthe embrace, came reflection.\n\n\"What the devil brings Porthos to Belle-Isle, lifting stones?\" said\nD'Artagnan; only D'Artagnan uttered that question in a low voice. Less\nstrong in diplomacy than his friend, Porthos thought aloud.\n\n\"How the devil did you come to Belle-Isle?\" asked he of D'Artagnan;\n\"and what do you want to do here?\" It was necessary to reply without\nhesitation. To hesitate in answer to Porthos would have been a check,\nfor which the self-love of D'Artagnan would never have consoled itself.\n\n\"_Pardieu!_ my friend, I am at Belle-Isle because you are here.\"\n\n\"Ah, bah!\" said Porthos, visibly stupefied with the argument and seeking\nto account for it to himself, with the felicity of deduction we know to\nbe particular to him.\n\n\"Without doubt,\" continued D'Artagnan, unwilling to give his friend time\nto recollect himself, \"I have been to see you at Pierrefonds.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you did not find me there?\"\n\n\"No, but I found Mouston.\"\n\n\"Is he well?\"\n\n\"_Peste!_\"\n\n\"Well, but Mouston did not tell you I was here.\"\n\n\"Why should he _not?_ Have I, perchance, deserved to lose his\nconfidence?\"\n\n\"No; but he did not know it.\"\n\n\"Well; that is a reason at least that does not offend my self-love.\"\n\n\"Then how did you manage to find me?\"\n\n\"My dear friend, a great noble like you always leaves traced behind him\non his passage; and I should think but poorly of myself, if I were not\nsharp enough to follow the traces of my friends.\" This explanation,\nflattering as it was, did not entirely satisfy Porthos.\n\n\"But I left no traces behind me, for I came here disguised,\" said\nPorthos.\n\n\"Ah! You came disguised did you?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And how?\"\n\n\"As a miller.\"\n\n\"And do you think a great noble, like you, Porthos, can affect common\nmanners so as to deceive people?\"\n\n\"Well, I swear to you my friend, that I played my part so well that\n_everybody_ was deceived.\"\n\n\"Indeed! so well, that I have not discovered and joined you?\"\n\n\"Yes; but _how_ did you discover and join me?\"\n\n\"Stop a bit. I was going to tell you how. Do you imagine Mouston--\"\n\n\"Ah! it was that fellow, Mouston,\" said Porthos, gathering up those two\ntriumphant arches which served him for eyebrows.\n\n\"But stop, I tell you--it was no fault of Mouston's because he was\nignorant of where you were.\"\n\n\"I know he was; and that is why I am in such haste to understand--\"\n\n\"Oh! how impatient you are, Porthos.\"\n\n\"When I do not comprehend, I am terrible.\"\n\n\"Well, you will understand. Aramis wrote to you at Pierrefonds, did he\nnot?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And he told you to come before the equinox.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"Well! that is it,\" said D'Artagnan, hoping that this reason would\nmystify Porthos. Porthos appeared to give himself up to a violent mental\nlabor.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said he, \"I understand. As Aramis told me to come before\nthe equinox, you have understood that that was to join him. You then\ninquired where Aramis was, saying to yourself, 'Where Aramis is, there\nPorthos will be.' You have learnt that Aramis was in Bretagne, and you\nsaid to yourself, 'Porthos is in Bretagne.'\"\n\n\"Exactly. In good truth, Porthos, I cannot tell why you have not turned\nconjuror. So you understand that, arriving at Roche-Bernard, I heard of\nthe splendid fortifications going on at Belle-Isle. The account raised\nmy curiosity, I embarked in a fishing boat, without dreaming that you\nwere here: I came, and I saw a monstrous fine fellow lifting a stone\nAjax could not have stirred. I cried out, 'Nobody but the Baron de\nBracieux could have performed such a feat of strength.' You heard me,\nyou turned round, you recognized me, we embraced; and, _ma foi!_ if you\nlike, my dear friend, we will embrace again.\"\n\n\"Ah! now all is explained,\" said Porthos; and he embraced D'Artagnan\nwith so much friendship as to deprive the musketeer of his breath for\nfive minutes.\n\n\"Why, you are stronger than ever,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and still, happily,\nin your arms.\" Porthos saluted D'Artagnan with a gracious smile. During\nthe five minutes D'Artagnan was recovering his breath, he reflected that\nhe had a very difficult part to play. It was necessary that he always\nshould question and never reply. By the time his respiration returned,\nhe had fixed his plans for the campaign.\n\n\n\nChapter LXX. Wherein the Ideas of D'Artagnan, at first strangely\nclouded, begin to clear up a little.\n\nD'Artagnan immediately took the offensive. \"Now that I have told you\nall, dear friend, or rather you have guessed all, tell me what you are\ndoing here, covered with dust and mud?\"\n\nPorthos wiped his brow, and looked around him with pride. \"Why, it\nappears,\" said he, \"that you may see what I am doing here.\"\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt, you lift great stones.\"\n\n\"Oh! to show these idle fellows what a _man_ is,\" said Porthos, with\ncontempt. \"But you understand--\"\n\n\"Yes, that is not your place to lift stones, although there are many\nwhose place it is, who cannot lift them as you do. It was that which\nmade me ask you, just now. What are you doing here, baron?\"\n\n\"I am studying topography, chevalier.\"\n\n\"You are studying topography?\"\n\n\"Yes; but you--what are you doing in that common dress?\"\n\nD'Artagnan perceived he had committed a fault in giving expression to\nhis astonishment. Porthos had taken advantage of it, to retort with a\nquestion. \"Why,\" said he, \"you know I am a bourgeois, in fact; my\ndress, then, has nothing astonishing in it, since it conforms with my\ncondition.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! you are a musketeer.\"\n\n\"You are wrong, my friend; I have given in my resignation.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"Oh, _mon Dieu!_ yes.\"\n\n\"And you have abandoned the service?\"\n\n\"I have quitted it.\"\n\n\"You have abandoned the king?\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\nPorthos raised his arms towards heaven, like a man who has heard\nextraordinary news. \"Well, that _does_ confound me,\" said he.\n\n\"It is nevertheless true.\"\n\n\"And what led you to form such a resolution.\"\n\n\"The king displeased me. Mazarin had disgusted me for a long time, as\nyou know; so I threw my cassock to the nettles.\"\n\n\"But Mazarin is dead.\"\n\n\"I know that well enough, _parbleu!_ Only, at the period of his death,\nmy resignation had been given in and accepted two months. Then, feeling\nmyself free, I set off for Pierrefonds, to see my friend Porthos. I\nhad heard talk of the happy division you had made of your time, and I\nwished, for a fortnight, to divide mine after your fashion.\"\n\n\"My friend, you know that it is not for a fortnight my house is open to\nyou; it is for a year--for ten years--for life.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Porthos.\"\n\n\"Ah! but perhaps you want money--do you?\" said Porthos, making something\nlike fifty louis chink in his pocket. \"In that case, you know--\"\n\n\"No, thank you; I am not in want of anything. I placed my savings with\nPlanchet, who pays me the interest of them.\"\n\n\"Your savings?\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure,\" said D'Artagnan: \"why should I not put by my savings,\nas well as another, Porthos?\"\n\n\"Oh, there is no reason why; on the contrary, I always suspected\nyou--that is to say, Aramis always suspected you to have savings. For\nmy own part, d'ye see, I take no concern about the management of my\nhousehold; but I presume the savings of a musketeer must be small.\"\n\n\"No doubt, relative to yourself, Porthos, who are a millionaire; but you\nshall judge. I had laid by twenty-five thousand livres.\"\n\n\"That's pretty well,\" said Porthos, with an affable air.\n\n\"And,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"on the twenty-eighth of last month I added\nto it two hundred thousand livres more.\"\n\nPorthos opened his large eyes, which eloquently demanded of the\nmusketeer, \"Where the devil did you steal such a sum as that, my dear\nfriend?\" \"Two hundred thousand livres!\" cried he, at length.\n\n\"Yes; which, with the twenty-five I had, and twenty thousand I have\nabout me, complete the sum of two hundred and forty-five thousand\nlivres.\"\n\n\"But tell me, whence comes this fortune?\"\n\n\"I will tell you all about it presently, dear friend; but as you have,\nin the first place, many things to tell me yourself, let us have my\nrecital in its proper order.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" said Porthos; \"then we are both rich. But what can I have to\nrelate to you?\"\n\n\"You have to relate to me how Aramis came to be named--\"\n\n\"Ah! bishop of Vannes.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said D'Artagnan, \"bishop of Vannes. Dear Aramis! do you\nknow how he succeeded so well?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; without reckoning that he does not mean to stop there.\"\n\n\"What! do you mean he will not be contented with violet stockings, and\nthat he wants a red hat?\"\n\n\"Hush! that is _promised_ him.\"\n\n\"Bah! by the king?\"\n\n\"By somebody more powerful than the king.\"\n\n\"Ah! the devil! Porthos: what incredible things you tell me, my friend!\"\n\n\"Why incredible? Is there not always somebody in France more powerful\nthan the king?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; in the time of King Louis XIII. it was Cardinal Richelieu; in\nthe time of the regency it was Cardinal Mazarin. In the time of Louis\nXIV. it is M--\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"It is M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"Jove! you have hit it the first time.\"\n\n\"So, then, I suppose it is M. Fouquet who has promised Aramis the red\nhat.\"\n\nPorthos assumed an air of reserve. \"Dear friend,\" said he, \"God preserve\nme from meddling with the affairs of others, above all from revealing\nsecrets it may be to their interest to keep. When you see Aramis, he\nwill tell you all he thinks he ought to tell you.\"\n\n\"You are right, Porthos; and you are quite a padlock for safety. But, to\nrevert to yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"You said just now you came hither to study topography?\"\n\n\"I did so.\"\n\n\"_Tudieu!_ my friend, what fine things you will do!\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, these fortifications are admirable.\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion?\"\n\n\"Decidedly it is. In truth, to anything but a regular siege, Belle-Isle\nis absolutely impregnable.\"\n\nPorthos rubbed his hands. \"That is my opinion,\" said he.\n\n\"But who the devil has fortified this paltry little place in this\nmanner?\"\n\nPorthos drew himself up proudly: \"Did I not tell you who?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you not suspect?\"\n\n\"No; all I can say is that he is a man who has studied all the systems,\nand who appears to me to have stopped at the best.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Porthos; \"consider my modesty, my dear D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"In truth,\" replied the musketeer, \"can it be you--who--oh!\"\n\n\"Pray--my dear friend--\"\n\n\"You who have imagined, traced, and combined between these bastions,\nthese redans, these curtains, these half-moons; and are preparing that\ncovered way?\"\n\n\"I beg you--\"\n\n\"You who have built that lunette with its retiring angles and its\nsalient edges?\"\n\n\"My friend--\"\n\n\"You who have given that inclination to the openings of your embrasures,\nby means of which you so effectively protect the men who serve the\nguns?\"\n\n\"Eh! _mon Dieu!_ yes.\"\n\n\"Oh! Porthos, Porthos! I must bow down before you--I must admire you!\nBut you have always concealed from us this superb, this incomparable\ngenius. I hope, my dear friend, you will show me all this in detail.\"\n\n\"Nothing more easy. Here lies my original sketch, my plan.\"\n\n\"Show it me.\" Porthos led D'Artagnan towards the stone that served him\nfor a table, and upon which the plan was spread. At the foot of the plan\nwas written, in the formidable writing of Porthos, writing of which we\nhave already had occasion to speak:--\n\n\"Instead of making use of the square or rectangle, as has been done to\nthis time, you will suppose your place inclosed in a regular hexagon,\nthis polygon having the advantage of offering more angles than the\nquadrilateral one. Every side of your hexagon, of which you will\ndetermine the length in proportion to the dimensions taken upon the\nplace, will be divided into two parts, and upon the middle point you\nwill elevate a perpendicular towards the center of the polygon, which\nwill equal in length the sixth part of the side. By the extremities of\neach side of the polygon, you will trace two diagonals, which will cut\nthe perpendicular. These will form the precise lines of your defense.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said D'Artagnan, stopping at this point of the\ndemonstration; \"why, this is a complete system, Porthos.\"\n\n\"Entirely,\" said Porthos. \"Continue.\"\n\n\"No; I have read enough of it; but, since it is you, my dear Porthos,\nwho direct the works, what need have you of setting down your system so\nformally in writing?\"\n\n\"Oh! my dear friend, death!\"\n\n\"How! death?\"\n\n\"Why, we are all mortal, are we not?\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said D'Artagnan; \"you have a reply for everything, my\nfriend.\" And he replaced the plan upon the stone.\n\nBut however short the time he had the plan in his hands, D'Artagnan had\nbeen able to distinguish, under the enormous writing of Porthos, a\nmuch more delicate hand, which reminded him of certain letters to\nMarie Michon, with which he had been acquainted in his youth. Only the\nIndia-rubber had passed and repassed so often over this writing that it\nmight have escaped a less practiced eye than that of our musketeer.\n\n\"Bravo! my friend, bravo!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"And now you know all that you want to know, do you not?\" said Porthos,\nwheeling about.\n\n\"_Mordioux!_ yes, only do me one last favor, dear friend!\"\n\n\"Speak, I am master here.\"\n\n\"Do me the pleasure to tell me the name of that gentleman who is walking\nyonder.\"\n\n\"Where, there?\"\n\n\"Behind the soldiers.\"\n\n\"Followed by a lackey?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"In company with a mean sort of fellow, dressed in black?\"\n\n\"Yes, I mean him.\"\n\n\"That is M. Getard.\"\n\n\"And who is Getard, my friend?\"\n\n\"He is the architect of the house.\"\n\n\"Of what house?\"\n\n\"Of M. Fouquet's house.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"you are of the household of M. Fouquet,\nthen, Porthos?\"\n\n\"I! what do you mean by that?\" said the topographer, blushing to the top\nof his ears.\n\n\"Why, you say the house, when speaking of Belle-Isle, as if you were\nspeaking of the chateau of Pierrefonds.\"\n\nPorthos bit his lip. \"Belle-Isle, my friend,\" said he, \"belongs to M.\nFouquet, does it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe so.\"\n\n\"As Pierrefonds belongs to me?\"\n\n\"I told you I believed so; there are no two words to _that_.\"\n\n\"Did you ever see a man there who is accustomed to walk about with a\nruler in his hand?\"\n\n\"No; but I might have seen him there, if he really walked there.\"\n\n\"Well, that gentleman is M. Boulingrin.\"\n\n\"Who is M. Boulingrin?\"\n\n\"Now we are coming to it. If, when this gentleman is walking with a\nruler in his hand, any one should ask me,--'who is M. Boulingrin?' I\nshould reply: 'He is the architect of the house.' Well! M. Getard is\nthe Boulingrin of M. Fouquet. But he has nothing to do with the\nfortifications, which are my department alone; do you understand? mine,\nabsolutely mine.\"\n\n\"Ah! Porthos,\" cried D'Artagnan, letting his arms fall as a conquered\nman gives up his sword; \"ah! my friend, you are not only a Herculean\ntopographer, you are, still further, a dialectician of the first water.\"\n\n\"Is it not powerfully reasoned?\" said Porthos: and he puffed and blew\nlike the conger which D'Artagnan had let slip from his hand.\n\n\"And now,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that shabby-looking man, who accompanies M.\nGetard, is he also of the household of M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Porthos, with contempt; \"it is one M. Jupenet, or\nJuponet, a sort of poet.\"\n\n\"Who is come to establish himself here?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\n\"I thought M. Fouquet had poets enough, yonder--Scudery, Loret,\nPelisson, La Fontaine? If I must tell you the truth, Porthos, that poet\ndisgraces you.\"\n\n\"Eh!--my friend; but what saves us is that he is not here as a poet.\"\n\n\"As what, then, is he?\"\n\n\"As printer. And you make me remember, I have a word to say to the\n_cuistre_.\"\n\n\"Say it, then.\"\n\nPorthos made a sign to Jupenet, who perfectly recollected D'Artagnan,\nand did not care to come nearer; which naturally produced another sign\nfrom Porthos. This was so imperative, he was obliged to obey. As he\napproached, \"Come hither!\" said Porthos. \"You only landed yesterday and\nyou have begun your tricks already.\"\n\n\"How so, monsieur le baron?\" asked Jupenet, trembling.\n\n\"Your press was groaning all night, monsieur,\" said Porthos, \"and you\nprevented my sleeping, _corne de boeuf!_\"\n\n\"Monsieur--\" objected Jupenet, timidly.\n\n\"You have nothing yet to print: therefore you have no occasion to set\nyour press going. What did you print last night?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, a light poem of my own composition.\"\n\n\"Light! no, no, monsieur; the press groaned pitifully beneath it. Let it\nnot happen again. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You promise me?\"\n\n\"I do, monsieur!\"\n\n\"Very well; this time I pardon you. Adieu!\"\n\nThe poet retreated as humbly as he had approached.\n\n\"Well, now we have combed that fellow's head, let us breakfast.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"let us breakfast.\"\n\n\"Only,\" said Porthos, \"I beg you to observe, my friend, that we only\nhave two hours for our repast.\"\n\n\"What would you have? We will try to make two hours suffice. But why\nhave you only two hours?\"\n\n\"Because it is high tide at one o'clock, and, with the tide, I am going\nto Vannes. But, as I shall return to-morrow, my dear friend, you can\nstay here; you shall be master; I have a good cook and a good cellar.\"\n\n\"No,\" interrupted D'Artagnan, \"better than that.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You are going to Vannes, you say?\"\n\n\"To a certainty.\"\n\n\"To see Aramis?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well! I came from Paris on purpose to see Aramis.\"\n\n\"That's true.\"\n\n\"I will go with you then.\"\n\n\"Do; that's the thing.\"\n\n\"Only, I ought to have seen Aramis first, and you after. But man\nproposes, and God disposes. I have begun with you, and will finish with\nAramis.\"\n\n\"Very well!\"\n\n\"And in how many hours can you go from here to Vannes?\"\n\n\"Oh! _pardieu!_ in six hours. Three hours by sea to Sarzeau, three hours\nby road from Sarzeau to Vannes.\"\n\n\"How convenient that is! Being so near to the bishopric; do you often go\nto Vannes?\"\n\n\"Yes; once a week. But, stop till I get my plan.\"\n\nPorthos picked up his plan, folded it carefully, and engulfed it in his\nlarge pocket.\n\n\"Good!\" said D'Artagnan aside; \"I think I now know the real engineer who\nis fortifying Belle-Isle.\"\n\nTwo hours after, at high tide, Porthos and D'Artagnan set out for\nSarzeau.\n\n\n\nChapter LXXI. A Procession at Vannes.\n\nThe passage from Belle-Isle to Sarzeau was made rapidly enough, thanks\nto one of those little corsairs of which D'Artagnan had been told during\nhis voyage, and which, shaped for fast sailing and destined for the\nchase, were sheltered at that time in the roadstead of Locmaria, where\none of them, with a quarter of its war-crew, performed duty between\nBelle-Isle and the continent. D'Artagnan had an opportunity of\nconvincing himself that Porthos, though engineer and topographer, was\nnot deeply versed in affairs of state. His perfect ignorance, with any\nother, might have passed for well-informed dissimulation. But D'Artagnan\nknew too well all the folds and refolds of his Porthos, not to find\na secret if there were one there; like those regular, minute old\nbachelors, who know how to find, with their eyes shut, each book on the\nshelves of their library and each piece of linen in their wardrobe.\nSo if he had found nothing, our cunning D'Artagnan, in rolling and\nunrolling his Porthos, it was because, in truth, there was nothing to be\nfound.\n\n\"Be it so,\" said D'Artagnan; \"I shall get to know more at Vannes in half\nan hour than Porthos has discovered at Belle-Isle in two months. Only,\nin order that I may know something, it is important that Porthos should\nnot make use of the only stratagem I leave at his disposal. He must not\nwarn Aramis of my arrival.\" All the care of the musketeer was then, for\nthe moment, confined to the watching of Porthos. And let us hasten to\nsay, Porthos did not deserve all this mistrust. Porthos thought of no\nevil. Perhaps, on first seeing him, D'Artagnan had inspired him with a\nlittle suspicion; but almost immediately D'Artagnan had reconquered in\nthat good and brave heart the place he had always occupied, and not the\nleast cloud darkened the large eye of Porthos, fixed from time to time\nwith tenderness on his friend.\n\nOn landing, Porthos inquired if his horses were waiting and soon\nperceived them at the crossing of the road that winds round Sarzeau, and\nwhich, without passing through that little city, leads towards Vannes.\nThese horses were two in number, one for M. de Vallon, and one for his\nequerry; for Porthos had an equerry since Mouston was only able to use\na carriage as a means of locomotion. D'Artagnan expected that Porthos\nwould propose to send forward his equerry upon one horse to bring\nback another, and he--D'Artagnan--had made up his mind to oppose this\nproposition. But nothing D'Artagnan had expected happened. Porthos\nsimply told the equerry to dismount and await his return at Sarzeau,\nwhilst D'Artagnan would ride his horse; which was arranged.\n\n\"Eh! but you are quite a man of precaution, my dear Porthos,\" said\nD'Artagnan to his friend, when he found himself in the saddle, upon the\nequerry's horse.\n\n\"Yes; but this is a kindness on the part of Aramis. I have not my stud\nhere, and Aramis has placed his stables at my disposal.\"\n\n\"Good horses for bishop's horses, _mordioux!_\" said D'Artagnan. \"It is\ntrue, Aramis is a bishop of a peculiar kind.\"\n\n\"He is a holy man!\" replied Porthos, in a tone almost nasal, and with\nhis eyes raised towards heaven.\n\n\"Then he is much changed,\" said D'Artagnan; \"you and I have known him\npassably profane.\"\n\n\"Grace has touched him,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Bravo,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that redoubles my desire to see my dear old\nfriend.\" And he spurred his horse, which sprang off into a more rapid\npace.\n\n\"_Peste!_\" said Porthos, \"if we go on at this rate, we shall only take\none hour instead of two.\"\n\n\"To go how far, do you say, Porthos?\"\n\n\"Four leagues and a half.\"\n\n\"That will be a good pace.\"\n\n\"I could have embarked you on the canal, but the devil take rowers and\nboat-horses! The first are like tortoises; the second like snails; and\nwhen a man is able to put a good horse between his knees, that horse is\nbetter than rowers or any other means.\"\n\n\"You are right; you above all, Porthos, who always look magnificent on\nhorseback.\"\n\n\"Rather heavy, my friend; I was weighed the other day.\"\n\n\"And what do you weigh?\"\n\n\"Three hundred-weight!\" said Porthos, proudly.\n\n\"Bravo!\"\n\n\"So that you must perceive, I am forced to choose horses whose loins are\nstraight and wide, otherwise I break them down in two hours.\"\n\n\"Yes, giant's horses you must have, must you not?\"\n\n\"You are very polite, my friend,\" replied the engineer, with\naffectionate majesty.\n\n\"As a case in point,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"your horse seems to sweat\nalready.\"\n\n\"_Dame!_ It is hot! Ah, ah! do you see Vannes now?\"\n\n\"Yes, perfectly. It is a handsome city, apparently.\"\n\n\"Charming, according to Aramis, at least; but I think it black; but\nblack seems to be considered handsome by artists: I am sorry for it.\"\n\n\"Why so, Porthos?\"\n\n\"Because I have lately had my chateau of Pierrefonds, which was gray\nwith age, plastered white.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said D'Artagnan, \"and white is more cheerful.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it is less august, as Aramis tells me. Fortunately there are\ndealers in black as well as white. I will have Pierrefonds replastered\nin black; that's all there is about it. If gray is handsome, you\nunderstand, my friend, black must be superb.\"\n\n\"_Dame!_\" said D'Artagnan, \"that appears logical.\"\n\n\"Were you never at Vannes, D'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Then you know nothing of the city?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, look!\" said Porthos, raising himself in his stirrups, which made\nthe fore-quarters of his horse bend sadly,--\"do you see that corner, in\nthe sun, yonder?\"\n\n\"Yes, I see it plainly.\"\n\n\"Well, that is the cathedral.\"\n\n\"Which is called?\"\n\n\"Saint-Pierre. Now look again--in the faubourg on the left, do you see\nanother cross?\"\n\n\"Perfectly well.\"\n\n\"That is Saint-Patern, the parish preferred by Aramis.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Without doubt. Saint-Patern, you see, passes for having been the first\nbishop of Vannes. It is true that Aramis pretends he was not. But he is\nso learned that that may be only a paro--a para--\"\n\n\"A paradox,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Precisely; thank you! my tongue trips, I am so hot.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said D'Artagnan, \"continue your interesting description, I\nbeg. What is that large white building with many windows?\"\n\n\"Oh! that is the college of the Jesuits. _Pardieu!_ you have an apt\nhand. Do you see, close to the college, a large house with steeples,\nturrets, built in a handsome Gothic style, as that fool, M. Getard,\nsays?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is plainly to be seen. Well?\"\n\n\"Well, that is where Aramis resides.\"\n\n\"What! does he not reside at the episcopal palace?\"\n\n\"No; that is in ruins. The palace likewise is in the city, and Aramis\nprefers the faubourgs. That is why, as I told you, he is partial to\nSaint-Patern; Saint-Patern is in the faubourg. Besides, there are in\nthis faubourg a mall, a tennis-court, and a house of Dominicans. Look,\nthat where the handsome steeple rises to the heavens.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Next, you see the faubourg is like a separate city, it has its walls,\nits towers, its ditches; the quay is upon it likewise, and the boats\nland at the quay. If our little corsair did not draw eight feet of\nwater, we could have come full sail up to Aramis's windows.\"\n\n\"Porthos, Porthos,\" cried D'Artagnan, \"you are a well of knowledge, a\nspring of ingenious and profound reflections. Porthos, you no longer\nsurprise me, you confound me.\"\n\n\"Here we are,\" said Porthos, turning the conversation with his usual\nmodesty.\n\n\"And high time we were,\" thought D'Artagnan, \"for Aramis's horse is\nmelting away like a steed of ice.\"\n\nThey entered almost at the same instant the faubourg; but scarcely had\nthey gone a hundred paces when they were surprised to find the streets\nstrewed with leaves and flowers. Against the old walls of Vannes, hung\nthe oldest and the strangest tapestries of France. From over balconies\nfell long white sheets stuck all over with bouquets. The streets were\ndeserted; it was plain the entire population was assembled on one point.\nThe blinds were closed, and the breeze penetrated into the houses under\nthe hangings, which cast long, black shades between their places of\nissue and the walls. Suddenly, at the turning of a street, chants\nstruck the ears of the newly arrived travelers. A crowd in holiday garb\nappeared through the vapors of incense which mounted to the heavens in\nblue fleeces, and clouds of rose-leaves fluttered as high as the first\nstories. Above all heads were to be seen the cross and banners, the\nsacred symbols of religion. Then, beneath these crosses and banners,\nas if protected by them, walked a whole world of young girls clothed\nin white, crowned with corn-flowers. At the two sides of the street,\ninclosing the _cortege_, marched the guards of the garrison, carrying\nbouquets in the barrels of their muskets and on the points of their\nlances. This was the procession.\n\nWhilst D'Artagnan and Porthos were looking on with critical glances,\nwhich disguised an extreme impatience to get forward, a magnificent dais\napproached preceded by a hundred Jesuits and a hundred Dominicans, and\nescorted by two archdeacons, a treasurer, a penitent and twelve canons.\nA singer with a thundering voice--a man certainly picked out from all\nthe voices of France, as was the drum-major of the imperial guard from\nall the giants of the empire--escorted by four other chanters, who\nappeared to be there only to serve him as an accompaniment, made the air\nresound, and the windows of the houses vibrate. Under the dais appeared\na pale and noble countenance with black eyes, black hair streaked with\nthreads of white, a delicate, compressed mouth, a prominent and angular\nchin. His head, full of graceful majesty, was covered with the episcopal\nmitre, a headdress which gave it, in addition to the character of\nsovereignty, that of asceticism and evangelic meditation.\n\n\"Aramis!\" cried the musketeer, involuntarily, as this lofty countenance\npassed before him. The prelate started at the sound of the voice. He\nraised his large black eyes, with their long lashes, and turned them\nwithout hesitation towards the spot whence the exclamation proceeded.\nAt a glance, he saw Porthos and D'Artagnan close to him. On his part,\nD'Artagnan, thanks to the keenness of his sight, had seen all, seized\nall. The full portrait of the prelate had entered his memory, never to\nleave it. One thing had particularly struck D'Artagnan. On perceiving\nhim, Aramis had colored, then he had concentrated under his eyelids the\nfire of the look of the master, and the indefinable affection of\nthe friend. It was evident that Aramis had asked himself this\nquestion:--\"Why is D'Artagnan with Porthos, and what does he want\nat Vannes?\" Aramis comprehended all that was passing in the mind of\nD'Artagnan, on turning his look upon him again, and seeing that he had\nnot lowered his eyes. He knew the acuteness and intelligence of his\nfriend; he feared to let him divine the secret of his blush and his\nastonishment. He was still the same Aramis, always having a secret to\nconceal. Therefore, to put an end to his look of an inquisitor, which it\nwas necessary to get rid of at all events, as, at any price, a general\nextinguishes a battery which annoys him, Aramis stretched forth his\nbeautiful white hand, upon which sparkled the amethyst of the pastoral\nring; he cut the air with sign of the cross, and poured out his\nbenediction upon his two friends. Perhaps thoughtful and absent,\nD'Artagnan, impious in spite of himself, might not have bent beneath\nthis holy benediction; but Porthos saw his distraction, and laying\nhis friendly hand upon the back of his companion, he crushed him down\ntowards the earth. D'Artagnan was forced to give way; indeed, he was\nlittle short of being flat on the ground. In the meantime Aramis had\npassed. D'Artagnan, like Antaeus, had only touched the ground, and he\nturned towards Porthos, almost angry. But there was no mistaking the\nintention of the brave Hercules; it was a feeling of religious propriety\nthat had influenced him. Besides, speech with Porthos, instead of\ndisguising his thought, always completed it.\n\n\"It is very polite of him,\" said he, \"to have given his benediction to\nus alone. Decidedly, he is a holy man, and a brave man.\" Less convinced\nthan Porthos, D'Artagnan made no reply.\n\n\"Observe my friend,\" continued Porthos, \"he has seen us; and, instead\nof continuing to walk on at the simple pace of the procession, as he did\njust now,--see, what a hurry he is in; do you see how the _cortege_ is\nincreasing its speed? He is eager to join us and embrace us, is that\ndear Aramis.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" replied D'Artagnan, aloud.--Then to himself:--\"It is\nequally true he has seen me, the fox, and will have time to prepare\nhimself to receive me.\"\n\nBut the procession had passed; the road was free. D'Artagnan and Porthos\nwalked straight up to the episcopal palace, which was surrounded by a\nnumerous crowd anxious to see the prelate return. D'Artagnan remarked\nthat this crowd was composed principally of citizens and military\nmen. He recognized in the nature of these partisans the address of his\nfriend. Aramis was not the man to seek for a useless popularity. He\ncared very little for being beloved by people who could be of no service\nto him. Women, children, and old men, that is to say, the _cortege_ of\nordinary pastors; was not the _cortege_ for him.\n\nTen minutes after the two friends had passed the threshold of the\npalace, Aramis returned like a triumphant conqueror; the soldiers\npresented arms to him as to a superior; the citizens bowed to him as to\na friend and a patron, rather than as a head of the Church. There was\nsomething in Aramis resembling those Roman senators who had their\ndoors always surrounded by clients. At the foot of the steps, he had a\nconference of half a minute with a Jesuit, who, in order to speak to him\nmore secretly, passed his head under the dais. He then re-entered his\npalace; the doors closed slowly, and the crowd melted away, whilst\nchants and prayers were still resounding abroad. It was a magnificent\nday. Earthly perfumes were mingled with the perfumes of the air and the\nsea. The city breathed happiness, joy, and strength. D'Artagnan\nfelt something like the presence of an invisible hand which had,\nall-powerfully, created this strength, this joy, this happiness, and\nspread everywhere these perfumes.\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said he, \"Porthos has got fat; but Aramis is grown taller.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LXXII. The Grandeur of the Bishop of Vannes.\n\nPorthos and D'Artagnan had entered the bishop's residence by a private\ndoor, as his personal friends. Of course, Porthos served D'Artagnan as\nguide. The worthy baron comported himself everywhere rather as if he\nwere at home. Nevertheless, whether it was a tacit acknowledgement of\nthe sanctity of the personage of Aramis and his character, or the habit\nof respecting him who imposed upon him morally, a worthy habit which had\nalways made Porthos a model soldier and an excellent companion; for all\nthese reasons, say we, Porthos preserved in the palace of His Greatness\nthe Bishop of Vannes a sort of reserve which D'Artagnan remarked at\nonce, in the attitude he took with respect to the valets and officers.\nAnd yet this reserve did not go so far as to prevent his asking\nquestions. Porthos questioned. They learned that His Greatness had\njust returned to his apartment and was preparing to appear in familiar\nintimacy, less majestic than he had appeared with his flock. After\na quarter of an hour, which D'Artagnan and Porthos passed in looking\nmutually at each other with the white of their eyes, and turning their\nthumbs in all the different evolutions which go from north to south, a\ndoor of the chamber opened and His Greatness appeared, dressed in the\nundress, complete, of a prelate. Aramis carried his head high, like a\nman accustomed to command: his violet robe was tucked up on one side,\nand his white hand was on his hip. He had retained the fine mustache,\nand the lengthened _royale_ of the time of Louis XIII. He exhaled, on\nentering, that delicate perfume which, among elegant men and women\nof high fashion, never changes, and appears to be incorporated in the\nperson, of whom it has become the natural emanation. In this case\nonly, the perfume had retained something of the religious sublimity of\nincense. It no longer intoxicated, it penetrated; it no longer inspired\ndesire, it inspired respect. Aramis, on entering the chamber, did not\nhesitate an instant; and without pronouncing one word, which, whatever\nit might be, would have been cold on such an occasion, he went straight\nup to the musketeer, so well disguised under the costume of M. Agnan,\nand pressed him in his arms with a tenderness which the most distrustful\ncould not have suspected of coldness or affectation.\n\nD'Artagnan, on his part, embraced him with equal ardor. Porthos pressed\nthe delicate hand of Aramis in his immense hands, and D'Artagnan\nremarked that His Greatness gave him his left hand, probably from habit,\nseeing that Porthos already ten times had been near injuring his fingers\ncovered with rings, by pounding his flesh in the vise of his fist.\nWarned by the pain, Aramis was cautious, and only presented flesh to be\nbruised, and not fingers to be crushed, against the gold or the angles\nof diamonds.\n\nBetween two embraces, Aramis looked D'Artagnan in the face, offered him\na chair, sitting down himself in the shade, observing that the light\nfell full upon the face of his interlocutor. This maneuver, familiar to\ndiplomatists and women, resembles much the advantage of the guard which,\naccording to their skill or habit, combatants endeavor to take on the\nground at a duel. D'Artagnan was not the dupe of this maneuver; but he\ndid not appear to perceive it. He felt himself caught; but, precisely\nbecause he was caught he felt himself on the road to discovery, and\nit little imported to him, old condottiere as he was, to be beaten in\nappearance, provided he drew from his pretended defeat the advantages of\nvictory. Aramis began the conversation.\n\n\"Ah! dear friend! my good D'Artagnan,\" said he, \"what an excellent\nchance!\"\n\n\"It is a chance, my reverend companion,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that I will\ncall friendship. I seek you, as I always have sought you, when I had\nany grand enterprise to propose to you, or some hours of liberty to give\nyou.\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed,\" said Aramis, without explosion, \"you have been seeking\nme?\"\n\n\"Eh! yes, he has been seeking you, Aramis,\" said Porthos, \"and the proof\nis that he has unharbored me at Belle-Isle. That is amiable, is it not?\"\n\n\"Ah! yes,\" said Aramis, \"at Belle-Isle! certainly!\"\n\n\"Good!\" said D'Artagnan; \"there is my booby Porthos, without thinking of\nit, has fired the first cannon of attack.\"\n\n\"At Belle-Isle!\" said Aramis, \"in that hole, in that desert! That is\nkind, indeed!\"\n\n\"And it was I who told him you were at Vannes,\" continued Porthos, in\nthe same tone.\n\nD'Artagnan armed his mouth with a finesse almost ironical.\n\n\"Yes, I knew, but I was willing to see,\" replied he.\n\n\"To see what?\"\n\n\"If our old friendship still held out; if, on seeing each other, our\nhearts, hardened as they are by age, would still let the old cry of joy\nescape, which salutes the coming of a friend.\"\n\n\"Well, and you must have been satisfied,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"So, so.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"Yes, Porthos said hush! and you--\"\n\n\"Well! and I?\"\n\n\"And you gave me your benediction.\"\n\n\"What would you have, my friend?\" said Aramis, smiling; \"that is the\nmost precious thing that a poor prelate, like me, has to give.\"\n\n\"Indeed, my dear friend!\"\n\n\"Doubtless.\"\n\n\"And yet they say at Paris that the bishopric of Vannes is one of the\nbest in France.\"\n\n\"Ah! you are now speaking of temporal wealth,\" said Aramis, with a\ncareless air.\n\n\"To be sure, I wish to speak of that; I hold by it, on my part.\"\n\n\"In that case, let me speak of it,\" said Aramis, with a smile.\n\n\"You own yourself to be one of the richest prelates in France?\"\n\n\"My friend, since you ask me to give you an account, I will tell you\nthat the bishopric of Vannes is worth about twenty thousand livres a\nyear, neither more nor less. It is a diocese which contains a hundred\nand sixty parishes.\"\n\n\"That is very pretty,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"It is superb!\" said Porthos.\n\n\"And yet,\" resumed D'Artagnan, throwing his eyes over Aramis, \"you don't\nmean to bury yourself here forever?\"\n\n\"Pardon me. Only I do not admit the word _bury_.\"\n\n\"But it seems to me, that at this distance from Paris a man is buried,\nor nearly so.\"\n\n\"My friend, I am getting old,\" said Aramis; \"the noise and bustle of\na city no longer suit me. At fifty-seven we ought to seek calm and\nmeditation. I have found them here. What is there more beautiful,\nand stern at the same time, than this old Armorica. I find here, dear\nD'Artagnan, all that is opposite to what I formerly loved, and that is\nwhat must happen at the end of life, which is opposite to the beginning.\nA little of my old pleasure of former times still comes to salute me\nhere, now and then, without diverting me from the road of salvation. I\nam still of this world, and yet every step that I take brings me nearer\nto God.\"\n\n\"Eloquent, wise and discreet; you are an accomplished prelate, Aramis,\nand I offer you my congratulations.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Aramis smiling, \"you did not come here only for the purpose\nof paying me compliments. Speak; what brings you hither? May it be that,\nin some fashion or other, you want me?\"\n\n\"Thank God, no, my friend,\" said D'Artagnan, \"it is nothing of that\nkind.--I am rich and free.\"\n\n\"Rich!\" exclaimed Aramis.\n\n\"Yes, rich for me; not for you or Porthos, understand. I have an income\nof about fifteen thousand livres.\"\n\nAramis looked at him suspiciously. He could not believe--particularly\non seeing his friend in such humble guise--that he had made so fine a\nfortune. Then D'Artagnan, seeing that the hour of explanations was come,\nrelated the history of his English adventures. During the recital he\nsaw, ten times, the eyes of the prelate sparkle, and his slender fingers\nwork convulsively. As to Porthos, it was not admiration he manifested\nfor D'Artagnan; it was enthusiasm, it was delirium. When D'Artagnan had\nfinished, \"Well!\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Well!\" said D'Artagnan, \"you see, then, I have in England friends and\nproperty, in France a treasure. If your heart tells you so, I offer them\nto you. That is what I came here for.\"\n\nHowever firm was his look, he could not this time support the look of\nAramis. He allowed, therefore, his eye to stray upon Porthos--like the\nsword which yields to too powerful a pressure, and seeks another road.\n\n\"At all events,\" said the bishop, \"you have assumed a singular traveling\ncostume, old friend.\"\n\n\"Frightful! I know it is. You may understand why I would not travel as a\ncavalier or a noble; since I became rich, I am miserly.\"\n\n\"And you say, then, you came to Belle-Isle?\" said Aramis, without\ntransition.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"I knew I should find you and Porthos there.\"\n\n\"Find me!\" cried Aramis. \"Me! for the last year past I have not once\ncrossed the sea.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I should never have supposed you such a\nhousekeeper.\"\n\n\"Ah, dear friend, I must tell you that I am no longer the Aramis of\nformer times. Riding on horseback is unpleasant to me; the sea fatigues\nme. I am a poor, ailing priest, always complaining, always grumbling,\nand inclined to the austerities which appear to accord with old\nage,--preliminary parleyings with death. I linger, my dear D'Artagnan, I\nlinger.\"\n\n\"Well, that is all the better, my friend, for we shall probably be\nneighbors soon.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Aramis with a degree of surprise he did not even seek to\ndissemble. \"You my neighbor!\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_ yes.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"I am about to purchase some very profitable salt-mines, which are\nsituated between Piriac and Le Croisic. Imagine, my dear friend, a\nclear profit of twelve per cent. Never any deficiency, never any idle\nexpenses; the ocean, faithful and regular, brings every twelve hours\nits contingency to my coffers. I am the first Parisian who has dreamt of\nsuch a speculation. Do not say anything about it, I beg of you, and in a\nshort time we will communicate on the matter. I am to have three leagues\nof country for thirty thousand livres.\"\n\nAramis darted a look at Porthos, as if to ask if all this were true,\nif some snare were not concealed beneath this outward indifference.\nBut soon, as if ashamed of having consulted this poor auxiliary, he\ncollected all his forces for a fresh assault and new defense. \"I heard\nthat you had had some difference with the court, but that you had come\nout of it as you know how to get through everything, D'Artagnan, with\nthe honors of war.\"\n\n\"I!\" said the musketeer, with a burst of laughter that did not conceal\nhis embarrassment: for, from those words, Aramis was not unlikely to be\nacquainted with his last relations with the king. \"I! Oh, tell me all\nabout that, pray, Aramis?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was related to me, a poor bishop, lost in the middle of the\n_Landes_, that the king had taken you as the confidant of his amours.\"\n\n\"With whom?\"\n\n\"With Mademoiselle de Mancini.\"\n\nD'Artagnan breathed freely again. \"Ah! I don't say no to that,\" replied\nhe.\n\n\"It appears that the king took you one morning, over the bridge of Blois\nto talk with his lady-love.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said D'Artagnan. \"And you know that, do you? Well, then,\nyou must know that the same day I gave in my resignation!\"\n\n\"What, sincerely?\"\n\n\"Nothing more so.\"\n\n\"It was after that, then, that you went to the Comte de la Fere's?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Afterwards to me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And then Porthos?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Was it in order to pay us a simple visit?\"\n\n\"No, I did no know you were engaged, and I wished to take you with me\ninto England.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand; and then you executed alone, wonderful man as you\nare, what you wanted to propose to us all four. I suspected you had\nsomething to do with that famous restoration, when I learned that you\nhad been seen at King Charles's receptions, and that he appeared to\ntreat you like a friend, or rather like a person to whom he was under an\nobligation.\"\n\n\"But how the devil did you learn all that?\" asked D'Artagnan, who began\nto fear that the investigation of Aramis had extended further than he\nwished.\n\n\"Dear D'Artagnan,\" said the prelate, \"my friendship resembles, in a\ndegree, the solicitude of that night watch whom we have in the little\ntower of the mole, at the extremity of the quay. That brave man, every\nnight, lights a lantern to direct the barks that come from sea. He is\nconcealed in his sentry-box, and the fishermen do not see him; but he\nfollows them with interest; he divines them; he calls them; he attracts\nthem into the way to the port. I resemble this watcher; from time to\ntime some news reaches me, and recalls to my remembrance all those I\nloved. Then I follow the friends of old days over the stormy ocean of\nthe world, I, a poor watcher, to whom God has kindly given the shelter\nof a sentry-box.\"\n\n\"Well, what did I do when I came from England?\"\n\n\"Ah! there,\" replied Aramis, \"you get beyond my depth. I know nothing of\nyou since your return. D'Artagnan, my eyes are dim. I regretted you did\nnot think of me. I wept over your forgetfulness. I was wrong. I see you\nagain, and it is a festival, a great festival, I assure you, solemnly!\nHow is Athos?\"\n\n\"Very well, thank you.\"\n\n\"And our young pupil, Raoul?\"\n\n\"He seems to have inherited the skill of his father, Athos, and the\nstrength of his tutor, Porthos.\"\n\n\"And on what occasion have you been able to judge of that?\"\n\n\"Eh! _mon Dieu!_ on the eve of my departure from Paris.\"\n\n\"Indeed! tell me all about it!\"\n\n\"Yes; there was an execution at the Greve, and in consequence of that\nexecution, a riot. We happened, by accident, to be in the riot; and in\nthis riot we were obliged to have recourse to our swords. And he did\nwonders.\"\n\n\"Bah! what did he do?\"\n\n\"Why, in the first place, he threw a man out of the window, as he would\nhave flung a sack full of flock.\"\n\n\"Come, that's pretty well,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Then he drew, and cut and thrust away, as we fellows used to do in the\ngood old times.\"\n\n\"And what was the cause of this riot?\" said Porthos.\n\nD'Artagnan remarked upon the face of Aramis a complete indifference to\nthis question of Porthos. \"Why,\" said he, fixing his eyes upon Aramis,\n\"on account of the two farmers of the revenue, friends of M. Fouquet,\nwhom the king forced to disgorge their plunder, and then hanged them.\"\n\nA scarcely perceptible contraction of the prelate's brow showed that he\nhad heard D'Artagnan's reply. \"Oh, oh!\" said Porthos; \"and what were the\nnames of these friends of M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"MM. d'Eymeris and Lyodot,\" said D'Artagnan. \"Do you know these names,\nAramis?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the prelate, disdainfully; \"they sound like the names of\nfinanciers.\"\n\n\"Exactly; so they were.\"\n\n\"Oh! M. Fouquet allows his friends to be hanged, then,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"And why not?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Why, it seems to me--\"\n\n\"If these culprits were hanged, it was by order of the king. Now M.\nFouquet, although superintendent of the finances, has not, I believe,\nthe right of life and death.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" said Porthos; \"but in the place of M. Fouquet--\"\n\nAramis was afraid Porthos was about to say something awkward, so\ninterrupted him. \"Come, D'Artagnan,\" said he; \"this is quite enough\nabout other people, let us talk a little about you.\"\n\n\"Of me you know all that I can tell you. On the contrary let me hear a\nlittle about you, Aramis.\"\n\n\"I have told you, my friend. There is nothing of Aramis left in me.\"\n\n\"Nor of the Abbe d'Herblay even?\"\n\n\"No, not even of him. You see a man whom Providence has taken by the\nhand, whom he has conducted to a position that he could never have dared\neven to hope for.\"\n\n\"Providence?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, that is strange! I was told it was M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\" cried Aramis, without being able, with all the\npower of his will, to prevent the color rising to his cheeks.\n\n\"_Ma foi!_ why, Bazin!\"\n\n\"The fool!\"\n\n\"I do not say he is a man of genius, it is true; but he told me so; and\nafter him, I repeat it to you.\"\n\n\"I have never even seen M. Fouquet,\" replied Aramis with a look as pure\nand calm as that of a virgin who has never told a lie.\n\n\"Well, but if you had seen him and known him, there is no harm in that,\"\nreplied D'Artagnan. \"M. Fouquet is a very good sort of a man.\"\n\n\"Humph!\"\n\n\"A great politician.\" Aramis made a gesture of indifference.\n\n\"An all-powerful minister.\"\n\n\"I only hold to the king and the pope.\"\n\n\"_Dame!_ listen then,\" said D'Artagnan, in the most natural tone\nimaginable. \"I said that because everybody here swears by M. Fouquet.\nThe plain is M. Fouquet's; the salt-mines I am about to buy are\nM. Fouquet's; the island in which Porthos studies topography is M.\nFouquet's; the garrison is M. Fouquet's; the galleys are M. Fouquet's. I\nconfess, then, that nothing would have surprised me in your enfeoffment,\nor rather in that of your diocese, to M. Fouquet. He is a different\nmaster from the king, that is all; but quite as powerful as Louis.\"\n\n\"Thank God! I am not vassal to anybody; I belong to nobody, and am\nentirely my own master,\" replied Aramis, who, during this conversation,\nfollowed with his eye every gesture of D'Artagnan, every glance of\nPorthos. But D'Artagnan was impassible and Porthos motionless; the\nthrusts aimed so skillfully were parried by an able adversary; not one\nhit the mark. Nevertheless, both began to feel the fatigue of such a\ncontest, and the announcement of supper was well received by everybody.\nSupper changed the course of conversation. Besides, they felt that, upon\ntheir guard as each one had been, they could neither of them boast of\nhaving the advantage. Porthos had understood nothing of what had been\nmeant. He had held himself motionless, because Aramis had made him a\nsign not to stir. Supper, for him, was nothing but supper; but that\nwas quite enough for Porthos. The supper, then, went off very well.\nD'Artagnan was in high spirits. Aramis exceeded himself in kind\naffability. Porthos ate like old Pelops. Their talk was of war, finance,\nthe arts, and love. Aramis played astonishment at every word of politics\nD'Artagnan risked. This long series of surprises increased the mistrust\nof D'Artagnan, as the eternal indifference of D'Artagnan provoked the\nsuspicions of Aramis. At length D'Artagnan, designedly, uttered the name\nof Colbert: he had reserved that stroke for the last.\n\n\"Who is this Colbert?\" asked the bishop.\n\n\"Oh! come,\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"that is too strong! We must be\ncareful, _mordioux!_ we must be careful.\"\n\nAnd he then gave Aramis all the information respecting M. Colbert he\ncould desire. The supper, or rather, the conversation, was prolonged\ntill one o'clock in the morning between D'Artagnan and Aramis. At ten\no'clock precisely, Porthos had fallen asleep in his chair and snored\nlike an organ. At midnight he woke up and they sent him to bed. \"Hum!\"\nsaid he, \"I was near falling asleep; but that was all very interesting\nyou were talking about.\"\n\nAt one o'clock Aramis conducted D'Artagnan to the chamber destined for\nhim, which was the best in the episcopal residence. Two servants were\nplaced at his command. \"To-morrow, at eight o'clock,\" said he, taking\nleave of D'Artagnan, \"we will take, if agreeable to you, a ride on\nhorseback with Porthos.\"\n\n\"At eight o'clock!\" said D'Artagnan; \"so late?\"\n\n\"You know that I require seven hours' sleep,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"Good-night, dear friend!\" And he embraced the musketeer cordially.\n\nD'Artagnan allowed him to depart; then, as soon as the door closed,\n\"Good!\" cried he, \"at five o'clock I will be on foot.\"\n\nThis determination being made, he went to bed and quietly, \"put two and\ntwo together,\" as people say.\n\n\n\nChapter LXXIII. In which Porthos begins to be sorry for having come with\nD'Artagnan.\n\nScarcely had D'Artagnan extinguished his taper, when Aramis, who had\nwatched through his curtains the last glimmer of light in his friend's\napartment, traversed the corridor on tiptoe, and went to Porthos's room.\nThe giant who had been in bed nearly an hour and a half, lay grandly\nstretched out on the down bed. He was in that happy calm of the first\nsleep, which, with Porthos, resisted the noise of bells or the report of\ncannon: his head swam in that soft oscillation which reminds us of the\nsoothing movement of a ship. In a moment Porthos would have begun to\ndream. The door of the chamber opened softly under the delicate pressure\nof the hand of Aramis. The bishop approached the sleeper. A thick carpet\ndeadened his steps, besides which Porthos snored in a manner to drown\nall noise. He laid one hand on his shoulder--\"Rouse,\" said he, \"wake up,\nmy dear Porthos.\" The voice of Aramis was soft and kind, but it conveyed\nmore than a notice,--it conveyed an order. His hand was light, but it\nindicated danger. Porthos heard the voice and felt the hand of Aramis,\neven in the depth of sleep. He started up. \"Who goes there?\" cried he,\nin his giant's voice.\n\n\"Hush! hush! It is I,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"You, my friend? And what the devil do you wake me for?\"\n\n\"To tell you that you must set off directly.\"\n\n\"Set off?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where for?\"\n\n\"For Paris.\"\n\nPorthos bounded up in his bed, and then sank back down again, fixing his\ngreat eyes in agitation upon Aramis.\n\n\"For Paris?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"A hundred leagues?\" said he.\n\n\"A hundred and four,\" replied the bishop.\n\n\"Oh! _mon Dieu!_\" sighed Porthos, lying down again, like children who\ncontend with their _bonne_ to gain an hour or two more sleep.\n\n\"Thirty hours' riding,\" said Aramis, firmly. \"You know there are good\nrelays.\"\n\nPorthos pushed out one leg, allowing a groan to escape him.\n\n\"Come, come! my friend,\" insisted the prelate with a sort of impatience.\n\nPorthos drew the other leg out of the bed. \"And is it absolutely\nnecessary that I should go, at once?\"\n\n\"Urgently necessary.\"\n\nPorthos got upon his feet, and began to shake both walls and floors with\nhis steps of a marble statue.\n\n\"Hush! hush! for the love of Heaven, my dear Porthos!\" said Aramis, \"you\nwill wake somebody.\"\n\n\"Ah! that's true,\" replied Porthos, in a voice of thunder, \"I forgot\nthat; but be satisfied, I am on guard.\" And so saying, he let fall a\nbelt loaded with his sword and pistols, and a purse, from which the\ncrowns escaped with a vibrating and prolonged noise. This noise made the\nblood of Aramis boil, whilst it drew from Porthos a formidable burst of\nlaughter. \"How droll that is!\" said he, in the same voice.\n\n\"Not so loud, Porthos, not so loud.\"\n\n\"True, true!\" and he lowered his voice a half-note.\n\n\"I was going to say,\" continued Porthos, \"that it is droll that we are\nnever so slow as when we are in a hurry, and never make so much noise as\nwhen we wish to be silent.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true; but let us give the proverb the lie, Porthos; let us\nmake haste, and hold our tongue.\"\n\n\"You see I am doing my best,\" said Porthos, putting on his _haut de\nchausses_.\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"This is something in haste?\"\n\n\"It is more than that, it is serious, Porthos.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan has questioned you, has he not?\"\n\n\"Questioned me?\"\n\n\"Yes, at Belle-Isle?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of that, Porthos?\"\n\n\"_Parbleu!_\"\n\n\"It is impossible. Recollect yourself.\" \"He asked me what I was doing,\nand I told him--studying topography. I would have made use of another\nword which you employed one day.\"\n\n\"'Castrametation'?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it; but I never could recollect it.\"\n\n\"All the better. What more did he ask you?\"\n\n\"Who M. Getard was.\"\n\n\"Next?\"\n\n\"Who M. Jupenet was.\"\n\n\"He did not happen to see our plan of fortifications, did he?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The devil he did!\"\n\n\"But don't be alarmed, I had rubbed out your writing with India-rubber.\nIt was impossible for him to suppose you had given me any advice in\nthose works.\"\n\n\"Ay; but our friend has phenomenally keen eyes.\"\n\n\"What are you afraid of?\"\n\n\"I fear that everything is discovered, Porthos; the matter is, then, to\nprevent a great misfortune. I have given orders to my people to close\nall the gates and doors. D'Artagnan will not be able to get out before\ndaybreak. Your horse is ready saddled; you will gain the first relay;\nby five o'clock in the morning you will have traversed fifteen leagues.\nCome!\"\n\nAramis then assisted Porthos to dress, piece by piece, with as much\ncelerity as the most skillful _valet de chambre_ could have done.\nPorthos, half stupefied, let him do as he liked, and confounded himself\nin excuses. When he was ready, Aramis took him by the hand, and led him,\nmaking him place his foot with precaution on every step of the stairs,\npreventing him running against door-frames, turning him this way and\nthat, as if Aramis had been the giant and Porthos the dwarf. Soul set\nfire to and animated matter. A horse was waiting, ready saddled, in the\ncourtyard. Porthos mounted. Then Aramis himself took the horse by the\nbridle, and led him over some dung spread in the yard, with the evident\nintention of suppressing noise. He, at the same time, held tight the\nhorse's nose, to prevent him neighing. When arrived at the outward gate,\ndrawing Porthos towards him, who was going off without even asking him\nwhat for: \"Now, friend Porthos, now; without drawing bridle, till you\nget to Paris,\" whispered he in his ears; \"eat on horseback, drink on\nhorseback, but lose not a minute.\"\n\n\"That's enough; I will not stop.\"\n\n\"This letter to M. Fouquet; cost what it may, he must have it to-morrow\nbefore mid-day.\"\n\n\"He shall.\"\n\n\"And do not forget _one_ thing, my friend.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That you are riding out on a hunt for your _brevet_ of _duc_ and peer.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said Porthos, with his eyes sparkling; \"I will do it in\ntwenty-four hours, in that case.\"\n\n\"Try.\"\n\n\"Then let go the bridle--and forward, Goliath!\"\n\nAramis did let go, not the bridle, but the horse's nose. Porthos\nreleased his hand, clapped spurs to his horse, which set off at a\ngallop. As long as he could distinguish Porthos through the darkness,\nAramis followed him with his eyes: when he was completely out of sight,\nhe re-entered the yard. Nothing had stirred in D'Artagnan's apartment.\nThe _valet_ placed on watch at the door had neither seen any light, nor\nheard any noise. Aramis closed his door carefully, sent the lackey to\nbed, and quickly sought his own. D'Artagnan really suspected nothing,\ntherefore thought he had gained everything, when he awoke in the\nmorning, about half-past four. He ran to the window in his shirt.\nThe window looked out upon the court. Day was dawning. The court was\ndeserted; the fowls, even, had not left their roosts. Not a servant\nappeared. Every door was closed.\n\n\"Good! all is still,\" said D'Artagnan to himself. \"Never mind: I am\nup first in the house. Let us dress; that will be so much done.\" And\nD'Artagnan dressed himself. But, this time, he endeavored not to give\nto the costume of M. Agnan that _bourgeoise_ and almost ecclesiastical\nrigidity he had affected before; he managed, by drawing his belt\ntighter, by buttoning his clothes in a different fashion, and by putting\non his hat a little on one side, to restore to his person a little of\nthat military character, the absence of which had surprised Aramis. This\nbeing done, he made free, or affected to make free with his host, and\nentered his chamber without ceremony. Aramis was asleep or feigned to\nbe so. A large book lay open upon his night-desk, a wax-light was still\nburning in its silver sconce. This was more than enough to prove\nto D'Artagnan the quiescence of the prelate's night, and the good\nintentions of his waking. The musketeer did to the bishop precisely as\nthe bishop had done to Porthos--he tapped him on the shoulder. Evidently\nAramis pretended to sleep; for, instead of waking suddenly, he who slept\nso lightly required a repetition of the summons.\n\n\"Ah! ah! is that you?\" said he, stretching his arms. \"What an agreeable\nsurprise! _Ma foi!_ Sleep had made me forget I had the happiness to\npossess you. What o'clock is it?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said D'Artagnan, a little embarrassed. \"Early, I\nbelieve. But, you know, that devil of a habit of waking with the day,\nsticks to me still.\"\n\n\"Do you wish that we should go out so soon?\" asked Aramis. \"It appears\nto me to be very early.\"\n\n\"Just as you like.\"\n\n\"I thought we had agreed not to get on horseback before eight.\"\n\n\"Possibly; but I had so great a wish to see you, that I said to myself,\nthe sooner the better.\"\n\n\"And my seven hours' sleep!\" said Aramis: \"Take care; I had reckoned\nupon them, and what I lose of them I must make up.\"\n\n\"But it seems to me that, formerly, you were less of a sleeper than\nthat, dear friend; your blood was alive, and you were never to be found\nin bed.\"\n\n\"And it is exactly on account of what you tell me, that I am so fond of\nbeing there now.\"\n\n\"Then you confess, that it is not for the sake of sleeping, that you\nhave put me off till eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"I have been afraid you would laugh at me, if I told you the truth.\"\n\n\"Tell me, notwithstanding.\"\n\n\"Well, from six to eight, I am accustomed to perform my devotions.\"\n\n\"Your devotions?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I did not believe a bishop's exercises were so severe.\"\n\n\"A bishop, my friend, must sacrifice more to appearance than a simple\ncleric.\"\n\n\"_Mordioux!_ Aramis, that is a word which reconciles me with your\ngreatness. To appearances! That is a musketeer's word, in good truth!\n_Vivent les apparences_, Aramis!\"\n\n\"Instead of felicitating me upon it, pardon me, D'Artagnan. It is a very\nmundane word which I had allowed to escape me.\"\n\n\"Must I leave you, then?\"\n\n\"I want time to collect my thoughts, my friend, and for my usual\nprayers.\"\n\n\"Well, I leave you to them; but on account of that poor pagan,\nD'Artagnan, abridge them for once, I beg; I thirst for speech with you.\"\n\n\"Well, D'Artagnan, I promise you that within an hour and a half--\"\n\n\"An hour and a half of devotions! Ah! my friend, be as reasonable with\nme as you can. Let me have the best bargain possible.\"\n\nAramis began to laugh.\n\n\"Still agreeable, still young, still gay,\" said he. \"You have come into\nmy diocese to set me quarreling with grace.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"And you know well that I was never able to resist your seductions; you\nwill cost me my salvation, D'Artagnan.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bit his lips.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I will take the sin on my own head, favor me with one\nsimple Christian sign of the cross, favor me with one prayer, and we\nwill part.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Aramis, \"we are already no longer alone, I hear strangers\ncoming up.\"\n\n\"Well, dismiss them.\"\n\n\"Impossible; I made an appointment with them yesterday; it is the\nprincipal of the college of the Jesuits, and the superior of the\nDominicans.\"\n\n\"Your staff? Well, so be it.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I will go and wake Porthos, and remain in his company till you have\nfinished the conference.\"\n\nAramis did not stir, his brow remained unbent, he betrayed himself by no\ngesture or word; \"Go,\" said he, as D'Artagnan advanced to the door. \"_A\npropos_, do you know where Porthos sleeps?\"\n\n\"No, but I will inquire.\"\n\n\"Take the corridor, and open the second door on the left.\"\n\n\"Thank you! _au revoir_.\" And D'Artagnan departed in the direction\npointed out by Aramis.\n\nTen minutes had not passed away when he came back. He found Aramis\nseated between the superior of the Dominicans and the principal of the\ncollege of the Jesuits, exactly in the same situation as he had found\nhim formerly in the auberge at Crevecoeur. This company did not at all\nterrify the musketeer.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Aramis, quietly. \"You have apparently something to\nsay to me, my friend.\"\n\n\"It is,\" replied D'Artagnan, fixing his eyes upon Aramis, \"it is that\nPorthos is not in his apartment.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Aramis calmly; \"are you sure?\"\n\n\"_Pardieu!_ I came from his chamber.\"\n\n\"Where can he be, then?\"\n\n\"That is what I am asking _you_.\"\n\n\"And have you not inquired?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have.\"\n\n\"And what answer did you get?\"\n\n\"That Porthos, often walking out in a morning, without saying anything,\nhad probably gone out.\"\n\n\"What did you do, then?\"\n\n\"I went to the stables,\" replied D'Artagnan, carelessly.\n\n\"What to do?\"\n\n\"To see if Porthos had departed on horseback.\"\n\n\"And?\" interrogated the bishop.\n\n\"Well, there is a horse missing, stall No. 3, Goliath.\"\n\nAll this dialogue, it may be easily understood, was not exempt from\na certain affectation on the part of the musketeer, and a perfect\ncomplaisance on the part of Aramis.\n\n\"Oh! I guess how it is,\" said Aramis, after having considered for a\nmoment, \"Porthos is gone out to give us a surprise.\"\n\n\"A surprise?\"\n\n\"Yes; the canal which goes from Vannes to the sea abounds in teal and\nsnipes; that is Porthos's favorite sport, and he will bring us back a\ndozen for breakfast.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I am sure of it. Where else can he be? I would lay a wager he took a\ngun with him.\"\n\n\"Well, that is possible,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Do one thing, my friend. Get on horseback, and join him.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I will.\"\n\n\"Shall I go with you?\"\n\n\"No, thank you; Porthos is a rather remarkable man: I will inquire as I\ngo along.\"\n\n\"Will you take an arquebus?\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Order what horse you like to be saddled.\"\n\n\"The one I rode yesterday, on coming from Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"So be it: use the horse as your own.\"\n\nAramis rang, and gave orders to have the horse M. d'Artagnan had chosen\nsaddled.\n\nD'Artagnan followed the servant charged with the execution of this\norder. When arrived at the door, the servant drew on one side to allow\nM. d'Artagnan to pass; and at that moment he caught the eye of his\nmaster. A knitting of the brow gave the intelligent spy to understand\nthat all should be given to D'Artagnan he wished. D'Artagnan got into\nthe saddle, and Aramis heard the steps of his horse on the pavement. An\ninstant after, the servant returned.\n\n\"Well?\" asked the bishop.\n\n\"Monseigneur, he has followed the course of the canal, and is going\ntowards the sea,\" said the servant.\n\n\"Very well!\" said Aramis.\n\nIn fact, D'Artagnan, dismissing all suspicion, hastened towards the\nocean, constantly hoping to see in the _Landes_, or on the beach, the\ncolossal profile of Porthos. He persisted in fancying he could trace a\nhorse's steps in every puddle. Sometimes he imagined he heard the report\nof a gun. This illusion lasted three hours; during two of which he went\nforward in search of his friend--in the last he returned to the house.\n\n\"We must have crossed,\" said he, \"and I shall find them waiting for me\nat table.\"\n\nD'Artagnan was mistaken. He no more found Porthos at the palace than he\nhad found him on the sea-shore. Aramis was waiting for him at the top of\nthe stairs, looking very much concerned.\n\n\"Did my people not find you, my dear D'Artagnan?\" cried he, as soon as\nhe caught sight of the musketeer.\n\n\"No; did you send any one after me?\"\n\n\"I am deeply concerned, my friend, deeply, to have induced you to\nmake such a useless search; but, about seven o'clock, the almoner of\nSaint-Patern came here. He had met Du Vallon, who was going away, and\nwho, being unwilling to disturb anybody at the palace, had charged him\nto tell me that, fearing M. Getard would play him some ill turn in his\nabsence, he was going to take advantage of the morning tide to make a\ntour of Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"But tell me, Goliath has not crossed the four leagues of sea, I should\nthink.\"\n\n\"There are full six,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"That makes it less probable still.\"\n\n\"Therefore, my friend,\" said Aramis, with one of his blandest smiles,\n\"Goliath is in the stable, well pleased, I will answer for it, that\nPorthos is no longer on his back.\" In fact, the horse had been brought\nback from the relay by the direction of the prelate, from whom no detail\nescaped. D'Artagnan appeared as well satisfied with as possible with\nthe explanation. He entered upon a part of dissimulation which agreed\nperfectly with the suspicions that arose more strongly in his mind. He\nbreakfasted between the Jesuit and Aramis, having the Dominican in front\nof him, and smiling particularly at the Dominican, whose jolly, fat face\npleased him much. The repast was long and sumptuous; excellent Spanish\nwine, fine Morbihan oysters, exquisite fish from the mouth of the Loire,\nenormous prawns from Paimboeuf, and delicious game from the moors,\nconstituted the principal part of it. D'Artagnan ate much, and drank but\nlittle. Aramis drank nothing, unless it was water. After the repast,--\n\n\"You offered me an arquebus,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Lend it me, then.\"\n\n\"Are you going shooting?\"\n\n\"Whilst waiting for Porthos, it is the best thing I can do, I think.\"\n\n\"Take which you like from the trophy.\"\n\n\"Will you not come with me?\"\n\n\"I would with great pleasure; but, alas! my friend, sporting is\nforbidden to bishops.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said D'Artagnan, \"I did not know that.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" continued Aramis, \"I shall be busy till mid-day.\"\n\n\"I shall go alone, then?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I am sorry to say you must; but come back to dinner.\"\n\n\"_Pardieu!_ the eating at your house is too good to make me think of not\ncoming back.\" And thereupon D'Artagnan quitted his host, bowed to the\nguests, and took his arquebus; but instead of shooting, went straight to\nthe little port of Vannes. He looked in vain to observe if anybody saw\nhim; he could discern neither thing nor person. He engaged a little\nfishing boat for twenty-five livres, and set off at half-past eleven,\nconvinced that he had not been followed; and that was true, he had not\nbeen followed; only a Jesuit brother, placed in the top of the steeple\nof his church, had not, since the morning, by the help of an excellent\nglass, lost sight of one of his steps. At three quarters past eleven,\nAramis was informed that D'Artagnan was sailing towards Belle-Isle. The\nvoyage was rapid; a good north north-east wind drove him towards the\nisle. As he approached, his eyes were constantly fixed upon the coast.\nHe looked to see if, upon the shore or upon the fortifications the\nbrilliant dress and vast stature of Porthos should stand out against\na slightly clouded sky; but his search was in vain. He landed without\nhaving seen anything; and learnt from the first soldier interrogated by\nhim, that M. du Vallon had not yet returned from Vannes. Then, without\nlosing an instant, D'Artagnan ordered his little bark to put its head\ntowards Sarzeau. We know that the wind changes with the different hours\nof the day. The breeze had veered from the north north-east to the\nsouth-east; the wind, then, was almost as good for the return to\nSarzeau, as it had been for the voyage to Belle-Isle. In three hours\nD'Artagnan had touched the continent; two hours more sufficed for his\nride to Vannes. In spite of the rapidity of his passage, what D'Artagnan\nendured of impatience and anger during that short passage, the deck\nalone of the vessel, upon which he stamped backwards and forwards for\nthree hours, could testify. He made but one bound from the quay whereon\nhe landed to the episcopal palace. He thought to terrify Aramis by the\npromptitude of his return; he wished to reproach him with his duplicity,\nand yet with reserve; but with sufficient spirit, nevertheless, to make\nhim feel all the consequences of it, and force from him a part of his\nsecret. He hoped, in short--thanks to that heat of expression which is\nto _secrets_ what the charge with the bayonet is to redoubts--to bring\nthe mysterious Aramis to some manifestation or other. But he found,\nin the vestibule of the palace, the _valet de chambre_, who closed his\npassage, while smiling upon him with a stupid air.\n\n\"Monseigneur?\" cried D'Artagnan, endeavoring to put him aside with his\nhand. Moved for an instant the valet resumed his station.\n\n\"Monseigneur?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, to be sure; do you not know me, _imbecile?_\"\n\n\"Yes; you are the Chevalier d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Then let me pass.\"\n\n\"It is of no use.\"\n\n\"Why of no use?\"\n\n\"Because His Greatness is not at home.\"\n\n\"What! His Greatness is not at home? where is he, then?\"\n\n\"Gone.\"\n\n\"Gone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Whither?\"\n\n\"I don't know; but perhaps he tells monsieur le chevalier.\"\n\n\"And how? where? in what fashion?\"\n\n\"In this letter, which he gave me for monsieur le chevalier.\" And the\n_valet de chambre_ drew a letter form his pocket.\n\n\"Give it me, then, you rascal,\" said D'Artagnan, snatching it from his\nhand. \"Oh, yes,\" continued he, at the first line, \"yes, I understand;\"\nand he read:--\n\n\"Dear Friend,--An affair of the most urgent nature calls me to a distant\nparish of my diocese. I hoped to see you again before I set out; but I\nlose that hope in thinking that you are going, no doubt, to remain two\nor three days at Belle-Isle, with our dear Porthos. Amuse yourself as\nwell as you can; but do not attempt to hold out against him at table.\nThis is a counsel I might have given even to Athos, in his most\nbrilliant and best days. Adieu, dear friend; believe that I regret\ngreatly not having better, and for a longer time, profited by your\nexcellent company.\"\n\n_\"Mordioux!_\" cried D'Artagnan. \"I am tricked. Ah! blockhead, brute,\ntriple fool that I am! But those laugh best who laugh last. Oh, duped,\nduped like a monkey, cheated with an empty nutshell!\" And with a hearty\nblow bestowed upon the nose of the smirking _valet de chambre_, he made\nall haste out of the episcopal palace. Furet, however good a trotter,\nwas not equal to present circumstances. D'Artagnan therefore took the\npost, and chose a horse which he soon caused to demonstrate, with\ngood spurs and a light hand, that deer are not the swiftest animals in\nnature.\n\n\n\nChapter LXXIV. In which D'Artagnan makes all Speed, Porthos snores, and\nAramis counsels.\n\nFrom thirty to thirty-five hours after the events we have just related,\nas M. Fouquet, according to his custom, having interdicted his door, was\nworking in the cabinet of his house at Saint-Mande, with which we are\nalready acquainted, a carriage, drawn by four horses steaming with\nsweat, entered the court at full gallop. This carriage was, probably,\nexpected; for three or four lackeys hastened to the door, which they\nopened. Whilst M. Fouquet rose from his bureau and ran to the window,\na man got painfully out of the carriage, descending with difficulty the\nthree steps of the door, leaning upon the shoulders of the lackeys. He\nhad scarcely uttered his name, when the _valet_ upon whom he was not\nleaning, sprang up to the _perron_, and disappeared in the vestibule.\nThis man went to inform his master; but he had no occasion to knock at\nthe door: Fouquet was standing on the threshold.\n\n\"Monseigneur, the Bishop of Vannes,\" said he.\n\n\"Very well!\" replied his master.\n\nThen, leaning over the banister of the staircase, of which Aramis was\nbeginning to ascend the first steps,--\n\n\"Ah, dear friend!\" said he, \"you, so soon!\"\n\n\"Yes; I, myself, monsieur! but bruised, battered, as you see.\"\n\n\"Oh! my poor friend,\" said Fouquet, presenting him his arm, on which\nAramis leant, whilst the servants drew back respectfully.\n\n\"Bah!\" replied Aramis, \"it is nothing, since I am here; the principal\nthing was that I should _get_ here, and here I am.\"\n\n\"Speak quickly,\" said Fouquet, closing the door of the cabinet behind\nAramis and himself.\n\n\"Are we alone?\"\n\n\"Yes, perfectly.\"\n\n\"No one observes us?--no one can hear us?\"\n\n\"Be satisfied; nobody.\"\n\n\"Is M. du Vallon arrived?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you have received my letter?\"\n\n\"Yes. The affair is serious, apparently, since it necessitates your\nattendance in Paris, at a moment when your presence was so urgent\nelsewhere.\"\n\n\"You are right, it could not be more serious.\"\n\n\"Thank you! thank you! What is it about? But, for God's sake! before\nanything else, take time to breathe, dear friend. You are so pale, you\nfrighten me.\"\n\n\"I am really in great pain. But, for Heaven's sake, think nothing about\nme. Did M. du Vallon tell you nothing, when he delivered the letter to\nyou?\"\n\n\"No; I heard a great noise; I went to the window; I saw at the foot\nof the _perron_ a sort of horseman of marble; I went down, he held the\nletter out to me, and his horse fell down dead.\"\n\n\"But he?\"\n\n\"He fell with the horse; he was lifted, and carried to an apartment.\nHaving read the letter, I went up to him, in hopes of obtaining more\nample information; but he was asleep, and, after such a fashion, that it\nwas impossible to wake him. I took pity on him; I gave orders that his\nboots should be cut from off his legs, and that he should be left quite\nundisturbed.\"\n\n\"So far well; now, this is the question in hand, monseigneur. You have\nseen M. d'Artagnan in Paris, have you not?\"\n\n\"_Certes_, and think him a man of intelligence, and even a man of heart;\nalthough he did bring about the death of our dear friends, Lyodot and\nD'Eymeris.\"\n\n\"Alas! yes, I heard of that. At Tours I met the courier who was bringing\nthe letter from Gourville, and the dispatches from Pelisson. Have you\nseriously reflected on that event, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And in it you perceived a direct attack upon your sovereignty?\"\n\n\"And do you believe it to be so?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I think so.\"\n\n\"Well, I must confess, that sad idea occurred to me likewise.\"\n\n\"Do not blind yourself, monsieur, in the name of Heaven! Listen\nattentively to me,--I return to D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"I am all attention.\"\n\n\"Under what circumstances did you see him?\"\n\n\"He came here for money.\"\n\n\"With what kind of order?\"\n\n\"With an order from the king.\"\n\n\"Direct?\"\n\n\"Signed by his majesty.\"\n\n\"There, then! Well, D'Artagnan has been to Belle-Isle; he was disguised;\nhe came in the character of some sort of an _intendant_, charged by his\nmaster to purchase salt-mines. Now, D'Artagnan has no other master but\nthe king: he came, then, sent by the king. He saw Porthos.\"\n\n\"Who is Porthos?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, I made a mistake. He saw M. du Vallon at Belle-Isle;\nand he knows, as well as you and I do, that Belle-Isle is fortified.\"\n\n\"And you think that the king sent him there?\" said Fouquet, pensively.\n\n\"I certainly do.\"\n\n\"And D'Artagnan, in the hands of the king, is a dangerous instrument?\"\n\n\"The most dangerous imaginable.\"\n\n\"Then I formed a correct opinion of him at the first glance.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"I wished to attach him to myself.\"\n\n\"If you judged him to be the bravest, the most acute, and the most\nadroit man in France, you judged correctly.\"\n\n\"He must be had then, at any price.\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Is that not your opinion?\"\n\n\"It may be my opinion, but you will never get him.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because we have allowed the time to go by. He was dissatisfied with the\ncourt, we should have profited by that; since that, he has passed into\nEngland; there he powerfully assisted in the restoration, there he\ngained a fortune, and, after all, he returned to the service of the\nking. Well, if he has returned to the service of the king, it is because\nhe is well paid in that service.\"\n\n\"We will pay him even better, that is all.\"\n\n\"Oh! monsieur, excuse me; D'Artagnan has a high respect for his word,\nand where that is once engaged he keeps it.\"\n\n\"What do you conclude, then?\" said Fouquet, with great inquietude.\n\n\"At present, the principal thing is to parry a dangerous blow.\"\n\n\"And how is it to be parried?\"\n\n\"Listen.\"\n\n\"But D'Artagnan will come and render an account to the king of his\nmission.\"\n\n\"Oh, we have time enough to think about that.\"\n\n\"How so? You are much in advance of him, I presume?\"\n\n\"Nearly ten hours.\"\n\n\"Well, in ten hours--\"\n\nAramis shook his pale head. \"Look at these clouds which flit across\nthe heavens; at these swallows which cut the air. D'Artagnan moves\nmore quickly than the clouds or the birds; D'Artagnan is the wind which\ncarries them.\"\n\n\"A strange man!\"\n\n\"I tell you, he is superhuman, monsieur. He is of my own age, and I have\nknown him these five-and-thirty years.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, listen to my calculation, monsieur. I send M. du Vallon off to\nyou two hours after midnight. M. du Vallon was eight hours in advance of\nme; when did M. du Vallon arrive?\"\n\n\"About four hours ago.\"\n\n\"You see, then, that I gained four upon him; and yet Porthos is a\nstaunch horseman, and he has left on the road eight dead horses, whose\nbodies I came to successively. I rode post fifty leagues; but I have the\ngout, the gravel, and what else I know not; so that fatigue kills me.\nI was obliged to dismount at Tours; since that, rolling along in a\ncarriage, half dead, sometimes overturned, drawn upon the sides, and\nsometimes on the back of the carriage, always with four spirited\nhorses at full gallop, I have arrived--arrived, gaining four hours upon\nPorthos; but, see you, D'Artagnan does not weigh three hundred-weight,\nas Porthos does; D'Artagnan has not the gout and gravel, as I have; he\nis not a horseman, he is a centaur. D'Artagnan, look you, set out for\nBelle-Isle when I set out for Paris; and D'Artagnan, notwithstanding my\nten hours' advance, D'Artagnan will arrive within two hours after me.\"\n\n\"But, then, accidents?\"\n\n\"He never meets with accidents.\"\n\n\"Horses may fail him.\"\n\n\"He will run as fast as a horse.\"\n\n\"Good God! what a man!\"\n\n\"Yes, he is a man whom I love and admire. I love him because he is good,\ngreat, and loyal; I admire him because he represents in my eyes the\nculminating point of human power; but, whilst loving and admiring him, I\nfear him, and am on my guard against him. Now then, I resume, monsieur;\nin two hours D'Artagnan will be here; be beforehand with him. Go to the\nLouvre, and see the king, before he sees D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"What shall I say to the king?\"\n\n\"Nothing; give him Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"Oh! Monsieur d'Herblay! Monsieur d'Herblay,\" cried Fouquet, \"what\nprojects crushed all at once!\"\n\n\"After one project that has failed, there is always another project that\nmay lead to fortune; we should never despair. Go, monsieur, and go at\nonce.\"\n\n\"But that garrison, so carefully chosen, the king will change it\ndirectly.\"\n\n\"That garrison, monsieur, was the king's when it entered Belle-Isle;\nit is yours now; it is the same with all garrisons after a fortnight's\noccupation. Let things go on, monsieur. Do you see any inconvenience in\nhaving an army at the end of a year, instead of two regiments? Do you\nnot see that your garrison of to-day will make you partisans at La\nRochelle, Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse--in short, wherever they may be\nsent to? Go to the king, monsieur; go; time flies, and D'Artagnan, while\nwe are losing time, is flying, like an arrow, along the high-road.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Herblay, you know that each word from you is a germ which\nfructifies in my thoughts. I will go to the Louvre.\"\n\n\"Instantly, will you not?\"\n\n\"I only ask time to change my dress.\"\n\n\"Remember that D'Artagnan has no need to pass through Saint-Mande; but\nwill go straight to the Louvre; that is cutting off an hour from the\nadvantage that yet remains to us.\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan may have everything except my English horses. I shall be\nat the Louvre in twenty-five minutes.\" And, without losing a second,\nFouquet gave orders for his departure.\n\nAramis had only time to say to him, \"Return as quickly as you go; for I\nshall await you impatiently.\"\n\nFive minutes after, the superintendent was flying along the road to\nParis. During this time, Aramis desired to be shown the chamber in which\nPorthos was sleeping. At the door of Fouquet's cabinet he was folded in\nthe arms of Pelisson, who had just heard of his arrival, and had left\nhis office to see him. Aramis received, with that friendly dignity which\nhe knew so well how to assume, these caresses, respectful as earnest;\nbut all at once stopping on the landing-place, \"What is that I hear up\nyonder?\"\n\nThere was, in fact, a hoarse, growling kind of noise, like the roar of\na hungry tiger, or an impatient lion. \"Oh, that is nothing,\" said\nPelisson, smiling.\n\n\"Well; but--\"\n\n\"It is M. du Vallon snoring.\"\n\n\"Ah! true,\" said Aramis: \"I had forgotten. No one but he is capable\nof making such a noise. Allow me, Pelisson, to inquire if he wants\nanything.\"\n\n\"And you will permit me to accompany you?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly;\" and both entered the chamber. Porthos was stretched\nupon the bed; his face was violet rather than red; his eyes were\nswelled; his mouth was wide open. The roaring which escaped from the\ndeep cavities of his chest made the glass of the windows vibrate. To\nthose developed and clearly defined muscles starting from his face, to\nhis hair matted with sweat, to the energetic heaving of his chin and\nshoulders, it was impossible to refuse a certain degree of admiration.\nStrength carried to this point is semi-divine. The Herculean legs and\nfeet of Porthos had, by swelling, burst his stockings; all the strength\nof his huge body was converted into the rigidity of stone. Porthos moved\nno more than does the giant of granite which reclines upon the plains of\nAgrigentum. According to Pelisson's orders, his boots had been cut off,\nfor no human power could have pulled them off. Four lackeys had tried\nin vain, pulling at them as they would have pulled capstans; and yet all\nthis did not awaken him. They had hacked off his boots in fragments, and\nhis legs had fallen back upon the bed. They then cut off the rest of\nhis clothes, carried him to a bath, in which they let him soak a\nconsiderable time. They then put on him clean linen, and placed him in\na well-warmed bed--the whole with efforts and pains which might have\nroused a dead man, but which did not make Porthos open an eye, or\ninterrupt for a second the formidable diapason of his snoring. Aramis\nwished on his part, with his nervous nature, armed with extraordinary\ncourage, to outbrave fatigue, and employ himself with Gourville and\nPelisson, but he fainted in the chair in which he had persisted sitting.\nHe was carried into the adjoining room, where the repose of bed soon\nsoothed his failing brain.\n\n\n\nChapter LXXV. In which Monsieur Fouquet Acts.\n\nIn the meantime Fouquet was hastening to the Louvre, at the best speed\nof his English horses. The king was at work with Colbert. All at once\nthe king became thoughtful. The two sentences of death he had signed\non mounting his throne sometimes recurred to his memory; they were two\nblack spots which he saw with his eyes open; two spots of blood which\nhe saw when his eyes were closed. \"Monsieur,\" said he rather sharply, to\nthe intendant; \"it sometimes seems to me that those two men you made me\ncondemn were not very great culprits.\"\n\n\"Sire, they were picked out from the herd of the farmers of the\nfinanciers, which wanted decimating.\"\n\n\"Picked out by whom?\"\n\n\"By necessity, sire,\" replied Colbert, coldly.\n\n\"Necessity!--a great word,\" murmured the young king.\n\n\"A great goddess, sire.\"\n\n\"They were devoted friends of the superintendent, were they not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire; friends who would have given up their lives for Monsieur\nFouquet.\"\n\n\"They have given them, monsieur,\" said the king.\n\n\"That is true;--but uselessly, by good luck,--which was not their\nintention.\"\n\n\"How much money had these men fraudulently obtained?\"\n\n\"Ten millions, perhaps; of which six have been confiscated.\"\n\n\"And is that money in my coffers?\" said the king with a certain air of\nrepugnance.\n\n\"It is there, sire; but this confiscation, whilst threatening M.\nFouquet, has not touched him.\"\n\n\"You conclude, then, M. Colbert--\"\n\n\"That if M. Fouquet has raised against your majesty a troop of factious\nrioters to extricate his friends from punishment, he will raise an army\nwhen he has in turn to extricate _himself_ from punishment.\"\n\nThe king darted at his confidant one of those looks which resemble the\nlivid fire of a flash of lightning, one of those looks which illuminate\nthe darkness of the basest consciences. \"I am astonished,\" said he,\n\"that, thinking such things of M. Fouquet, you did not come to give me\nyour counsels thereupon.\"\n\n\"Counsels upon what, sire?\"\n\n\"Tell me, in the first place, clearly and precisely, what you think, M.\nColbert.\"\n\n\"Upon what subject, sire?\"\n\n\"Upon the conduct of M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"I think, sire, that M. Fouquet, not satisfied with attracting all the\nmoney to himself, as M. Mazarin did, and by that means depriving your\nmajesty of one part of your power, still wishes to attract to himself\nall the friends of easy life and pleasure--of what idlers call poetry,\nand politicians, corruption. I think that, by holding the subjects\nof your majesty in pay, he trespasses upon the royal prerogative, and\ncannot, if this continues so, be long in placing your majesty among the\nweak and the obscure.\"\n\n\"How would you qualify all these projects, M. Colbert?\"\n\n\"The projects of M. Fouquet, sire?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"They are called crimes of _lese majeste_.\"\n\n\"And what is done to criminals guilty of _lese majeste?_\"\n\n\"They are arrested, tried, and punished.\"\n\n\"You are quite certain that M. Fouquet has conceived the idea of the\ncrime you impute to him?\"\n\n\"I can say more, sire; there is even a commencement of the execution of\nit.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I return to that which I was saying, M. Colbert.\"\n\n\"And you were saying, sire?\"\n\n\"Give me counsel.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, sire; but in the first place, I have something to add.\"\n\n\"Say--what?\"\n\n\"An evident, palpable, material proof of treason.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"I have just learnt that M. Fouquet is fortifying Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed!\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Perfectly. Do you know, sire, what soldiers there are in Belle-Isle?\"\n\n\"No, _ma foi!_ Do you?\"\n\n\"I am ignorant, likewise, sire; I should therefore propose to your\nmajesty to send somebody to Belle-Isle?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Me, for instance.\"\n\n\"And what would you do at Belle-Isle?\"\n\n\"Inform myself whether, after the example of the ancient feudal lords,\nM. Fouquet was battlementing his walls.\"\n\n\"And with what purpose could he do that?\"\n\n\"With the purpose of defending himself someday against his king.\"\n\n\"But, if it be thus, M. Colbert,\" said Louis, \"we must immediately do as\nyou say; M. Fouquet must be arrested.\"\n\n\"That is impossible.\"\n\n\"I thought I had already told you, monsieur, that I suppressed that word\nin my service.\"\n\n\"The service of your majesty cannot prevent M. Fouquet from being\nsurintendant-general.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"That, in consequence of holding that post, he has for him all the\nparliament, as he has all the army by his largesses, literature by his\nfavors, and the _noblesse_ by his presents.\"\n\n\"That is to say, then, that I can do nothing against M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"Absolutely nothing,--at least at present, sire.\"\n\n\"You are a sterile counselor, M. Colbert.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sire; for I will not confine myself to pointing out the peril\nto your majesty.\"\n\n\"Come, then, where shall we begin to undermine this Colossus; let us\nsee;\" and his majesty began to laugh bitterly.\n\n\"He has grown great by money; kill him by money, sire.\"\n\n\"If I were to deprive him of his charge?\"\n\n\"A bad means, sire.\"\n\n\"The good--the good, then?\"\n\n\"Ruin him, sire, that is the way.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"Occasions will not be wanting; take advantage of all occasions.\"\n\n\"Point them out to me.\"\n\n\"Here is one at once. His royal highness Monsieur is about to be\nmarried; his nuptials must be magnificent. That is a good occasion for\nyour majesty to demand a million of M. Fouquet. M. Fouquet, who\npays twenty thousand livres down when he need not pay more than five\nthousand, will easily find that million when your majesty demands it.\"\n\n\"That is all very well; I _will_ demand it,\" said Louis.\n\n\"If your majesty will sign the _ordonnance_ I will have the money\ngot together myself.\" And Colbert pushed a paper before the king, and\npresented a pen to him.\n\nAt that moment the usher opened the door and announced monsieur le\nsurintendant. Louis turned pale. Colbert let the pen fall, and drew\nback from the king, over whom he extended his black wings like an evil\nspirit. The superintendent made his entrance like a man of the court,\nto whom a single glance was sufficient to make him appreciate the\nsituation. That situation was not very encouraging for Fouquet, whatever\nmight be his consciousness of strength. The small black eye of Colbert,\ndilated by envy, and the limpid eye of Louis XIV. inflamed by anger,\nsignalled some pressing danger. Courtiers are, with regard to court\nrumors, like old soldiers, who distinguish through the blasts of wind\nand bluster of leaves the sound of the distant steps of an armed troop.\nThey can, after having listened, tell pretty nearly how many men are\nmarching, how many arms resound, how many cannons roll. Fouquet had then\nonly to interrogate the silence which his arrival had produced; he found\nit big with menacing revelations. The king allowed him time enough to\nadvance as far as the middle of the chamber. His adolescent modesty\ncommanded this forbearance of the moment. Fouquet boldly seized the\nopportunity.\n\n\"Sire,\" said he, \"I was impatient to see your majesty.\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked Louis.\n\n\"To announce some good news to you.\"\n\nColbert, minus grandeur of person, less largeness of heart, resembled\nFouquet in many points. He had the same penetration, the same knowledge\nof men; moreover, that great power of self-compression which gives to\nhypocrites time to reflect, and gather themselves up to take a spring.\nHe guessed that Fouquet was going to meet the blow he was about to deal\nhim. His eyes glittered ominously.\n\n\"What news?\" asked the king. Fouquet placed a roll of papers on the\ntable.\n\n\"Let your majesty have the goodness to cast your eyes over this work,\"\nsaid he. The king slowly unfolded the paper.\n\n\"Plans?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And what are these plans?\"\n\n\"A new fortification, sire.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said the king, \"you amuse yourself with tactics and strategies\nthen, M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"I occupy myself with everything that may be useful to the reign of your\nmajesty,\" replied Fouquet.\n\n\"Beautiful descriptions!\" said the king, looking at the design.\n\n\"Your majesty comprehends, without doubt,\" said Fouquet, bending over\nthe paper; \"here is the circle of the walls, here are the forts, there\nthe advanced works.\"\n\n\"And what do I see here, monsieur?\"\n\n\"The sea.\"\n\n\"The sea all round?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And what is, then, the name of this place of which you show me the\nplan?\"\n\n\"Sire, it is Belle-Ile-en-Mer,\" replied Fouquet with simplicity.\n\nAt this word, at this name, Colbert made so marked a movement, that the\nking turned round to enforce the necessity for reserve. Fouquet did\nnot appear to be the least in the world concerned by the movement of\nColbert, or the king's signal.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" continued Louis, \"you have then fortified Belle-Isle?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire; and I have brought the plan and the accounts to your\nmajesty,\" replied Fouquet; \"I have expended sixteen hundred livres in\nthis operation.\"\n\n\"What to do?\" replied Louis, coldly, having taken the initiative from a\nmalicious look of the intendant.\n\n\"For an aim very easy to seize,\" replied Fouquet. \"Your majesty was on\ncool terms with Great Britain.\"\n\n\"Yes; but since the restoration of King Charles II. I have formed an\nalliance with him.\"\n\n\"A month since, sire, your majesty has truly said; but it is more than\nsix months since the fortifications of Belle-Isle were begun.\"\n\n\"Then they have become useless.\"\n\n\"Sire, fortifications are never useless. I fortified Belle-Isle against\nMM. Monk and Lambert and all those London citizens who were playing at\nsoldiers. Belle-Isle will be ready fortified against the Dutch, against\nwhom either England or your majesty cannot fail to make war.\"\n\nThe king was again silent, and looked askant at Colbert. \"Belle-Isle, I\nbelieve,\" added Louis, \"is yours, M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"No, sire.\"\n\n\"Whose then?\"\n\n\"Your majesty's.\"\n\nColbert was seized with as much terror as if a gulf had opened beneath\nhis feet. Louis started with admiration, either at the genius or the\ndevotion of Fouquet.\n\n\"Explain yourself, monsieur,\" said he.\n\n\"Nothing more easy, sire; Belle-Isle is one of my estates; I have\nfortified it at my own expense. But as nothing in the world can oppose\na subject making an humble present to his king, I offer your majesty the\nproprietorship of the estate, of which you will leave me the usufruct.\nBelle-Isle, as a place of war, ought to be occupied by the king. Your\nmajesty will be able, henceforth, to keep a safe garrison there.\"\n\nColbert felt almost sinking down upon the floor. To keep himself from\nfalling, he was obliged to hold by the columns of the wainscoting.\n\n\"This is a piece of great skill in the art of war that you have\nexhibited here, monsieur,\" said Louis.\n\n\"Sire, the initiative did not come from me,\" replied Fouquet; \"many\nofficers have inspired me with it. The plans themselves have been made\nby one of the most distinguished engineers.\"\n\n\"His name?\"\n\n\"M. du Vallon.\"\n\n\"M. du Vallon?\" resumed Louis; \"I do not know him. It is much to be\nlamented, M. Colbert,\" continued he, \"that I do not know the names of\nthe men of talent who do honor to my reign.\" And while saying these\nwords he turned towards Colbert. The latter felt himself crushed, the\nsweat flowed from his brow, no word presented itself to his lips, he\nsuffered an inexpressible martyrdom. \"You will recollect that name,\"\nadded Louis XIV.\n\nColbert bowed, but was paler than his ruffles of Flemish lace. Fouquet\ncontinued:\n\n\"The masonries are of Roman concrete; the architects amalgamated it for\nme after the best accounts of antiquity.\"\n\n\"And the cannon?\" asked Louis.\n\n\"Oh! sire, that concerns your majesty; it did not become me to place\ncannon in my own house, unless your majesty had told me it was yours.\"\n\nLouis began to float, undetermined between the hatred which this so\npowerful man inspired him with, and the pity he felt for the other,\nso cast down, who seemed to him the counterfeit of the former. But the\nconsciousness of his kingly duty prevailed over the feelings of the man,\nand he stretched out his finger to the paper.\n\n\"It must have cost you a great deal of money to carry these plans into\nexecution,\" said he.\n\n\"I believe I had the honor of telling your majesty the amount.\"\n\n\"Repeat it if you please, I have forgotten it.\"\n\n\"Sixteen hundred thousand livres.\"\n\n\"Sixteen hundred thousand livres! you are enormously rich, monsieur.\"\n\n\"It is your majesty who is rich, since Belle-Isle is yours.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you; but however rich I may be, M. Fouquet--\" The king\nstopped.\n\n\"Well, sire?\" asked the superintendent.\n\n\"I foresee the moment when I shall want money.\"\n\n\"You, sire? And at what moment then?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, for example.\"\n\n\"Will your majesty do me the honor to explain yourself?\"\n\n\"My brother is going to marry the English Princess.\"\n\n\"Well, sire?\"\n\n\"Well, I ought to give the bride a reception worthy of the granddaughter\nof Henry IV.\"\n\n\"That is but just, sire.\"\n\n\"Then I shall want money.\"\n\n\"No doubt.\"\n\n\"I shall want--\" Louis hesitated. The sum he was going to demand was the\nsame that he had been obliged to refuse Charles II. He turned towards\nColbert, that he might give the blow.\n\n\"I shall want, to-morrow--\" repeated he, looking at Colbert.\n\n\"A million,\" said the latter, bluntly; delighted to take his revenge.\n\nFouquet turned his back upon the intendant to listen to the king. He did\nnot turn round, but waited till the king repeated, or rather murmured,\n\"A million.\"\n\n\"Oh! sire,\" replied Fouquet disdainfully, \"a million! what will your\nmajesty do with a million?\"\n\n\"It appears to me, nevertheless--\" said Louis XIV.\n\n\"That is not more than is spent at the nuptials of one of the most petty\nprinces of Germany.\"\n\n\"Monsieur!\"\n\n\"Your majesty must have two millions at least. The horses alone would\nrun away with five hundred thousand livres. I shall have the honor of\nsending your majesty sixteen hundred thousand livres this evening.\"\n\n\"How,\" said the king, \"sixteen hundred thousand livres?\"\n\n\"Look, sire,\" replied Fouquet, without even turning towards Colbert, \"I\nknow that wants four hundred thousand livres of the two millions. But\nthis monsieur of l'intendance\" (pointing over his shoulder to Colbert,\nwho if possible, became paler, behind him) \"has in his coffers nine\nhundred thousand livres of mine.\"\n\nThe king turned round to look at Colbert.\n\n\"But--\" said the latter.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" continued Fouquet, still speaking indirectly to Colbert,\n\"monsieur has received, a week ago, sixteen hundred thousand livres; he\nhas paid a hundred thousand livres to the guards, sixty-four thousand\nlivres to the hospitals, twenty-five thousand to the Swiss, an hundred\nand thirty thousand for provisions, a thousand for arms, ten thousand\nfor accidental expenses; I do not err, then, in reckoning upon nine\nhundred thousand livres that are left.\" Then turning towards Colbert,\nlike a disdainful head of office towards his inferior, \"Take care,\nmonsieur,\" said he, \"that those nine hundred thousand livres be remitted\nto his majesty this evening, in gold.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the king, \"that will make two millions five hundred thousand\nlivres.\"\n\n\"Sire, the five hundred thousand livres over will serve as pocket money\nfor his royal highness. You understand, Monsieur Colbert, this evening\nbefore eight o'clock.\"\n\nAnd with these words, bowing respectfully to the king, the\nsuperintendent made his exit backwards, without honoring with a single\nlook the envious man, whose head he had just half shaved.\n\nColbert tore his ruffles to pieces in his rage, and bit his lips till\nthey bled.\n\nFouquet had not passed the door of the cabinet, when an usher pushing by\nhim, exclaimed: \"A courier from Bretagne for his majesty.\"\n\n\"M. d'Herblay was right,\" murmured Fouquet, pulling out his watch; \"an\nhour and fifty-five minutes. It was quite true.\"\n\n\n\nEnd of The Vicomte de Bragelonne. The next text in the series is Ten\nYears Later.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[Footnote 1: The correct name of the city is Brighthelmstone.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
