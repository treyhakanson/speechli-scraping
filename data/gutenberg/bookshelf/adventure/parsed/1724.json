It narrates, through the mouth of Allan\nQuatermain, the consummation of the vengeance of the wizard\nZikali, alias The Opener of Roads, or\n\"The-Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born,\" upon the royal Zulu\nHouse of which Senzangacona was the founder and Cetewayo, our\nenemy in the war of 1879, the last representative who ruled as a\nking.  Although, of course, much is added for the purposes of\nromance, the main facts of history have been adhered to with some\nfaithfulness.\n\nWith these the author became acquainted a full generation ago,\nFortune having given him a part in the events that preceded the\nZulu War.  Indeed he believes that with the exception of Colonel\nPhillips, who, as a lieutenant, commanded the famous escort of\ntwenty-five policemen, he is now the last survivor of the party\nwho, under the leadership of Sir Theophilus Shepstone, or Sompseu\nas the natives called him from the Zambesi to the Cape, were\nconcerned in the annexation of the Transvaal in 1877.  Recently\nalso he has been called upon as a public servant to revisit South\nAfrica and took the opportunity to travel through Zululand, in\norder to refresh his knowledge of its people, their customs,\ntheir mysteries, and better to prepare himself for the writing of\nthis book.  Here he stood by the fatal Mount of Isandhlawana\nwhich, with some details of the battle, is described in these\npages, among the graves of many whom once he knew, Colonels\nDurnford, Pulleine and others.  Also he saw Ulundi's plain where\nthe traces of war still lie thick, and talked with an old Zulu\nwho fought in the attacking Impi until it crumbled away before\nthe fire of the Martinis and shells from the heavy guns.  The\nbattle of the Wall of Sheet Iron, he called it, perhaps because\nof the flashing fence of bayonets.\n\nLastly, in a mealie patch, he found the spot on which the corn\ngrows thin, where King Cetewayo breathed his last, poisoned\nwithout a doubt, as he has known for many years.  It is to be\nseen at the Kraal, ominously named Jazi or, translated into\nEnglish, \"Finished.\"  The tragedy happened long ago, but even now\nthe quiet-faced Zulu who told the tale, looking about him as he\nspoke, would not tell it all.  \"Yes, as a young man, I was there\nat the time, but I do not remember, I do not know--the Inkoosi\nLundanda (i.e., this Chronicler, so named in past years by the\nZulus) stands on the very place where the king died--His bed was\non the left of the door-hole of the hut,\" and so forth, but no\ncertain word as to the exact reason of this sudden and violent\ndeath or by whom it was caused.  The name of that destroyer of a\nking is for ever hid.\n\nIn this story the actual and immediate cause of the declaration\nof war against the British Power is represented as the appearance\nof the white goddess, or spirit of the Zulus, who is, or was,\ncalled Nomkubulwana or Inkosazana-y-Zulu, i.e., the Princess of\nHeaven.  The exact circumstances which led to this decision are\nnot now ascertainable, though it is known that there was much\ndifference of opinion among the Zulu Indunas or great captains,\nand like the writer, many believe that King Cetewayo was\npersonally averse to war against his old allies, the English.\n\nThe author's friend, Mr. J. Y. Gibson, at present the\nrepresentative of the Union in Zululand, writes in his admirable\nhistory: \"There was a good deal of discussion amongst the\nassembled Zulu notables at Ulundi, but of how counsel was swayed\nit is not possible now to obtain a reliable account.\"\n\nThe late Mr. F. B. Fynney, F.R.G.S., who also was his friend in\ndays bygone, and, with the exception of Sir Theophilus Shepstone,\nwho perhaps knew the Zulus and their language better than any\nother official of his day, speaking of this fabled goddess wrote:\n\"I remember that just before the Zulu War Nomkubulwana appeared\nrevealing something or other which had a great effect throughout\nthe land.\"\n\nThe use made of this strange traditional Guardian Angel in the\nfollowing tale is not therefore an unsupported flight of fancy,\nand the same may be said of many other incidents, such as the\naccount of the reading of the proclamation annexing the Transvaal\nat Pretoria in 1877, which have been introduced to serve the\npurposes of the romance.\n\nMameena, who haunts its pages, in a literal as well as figurative\nsense, is the heroine of _Child of Storm,_ a book to which she\ngave her own poetic title.\n\n\n1916.\nTHE AUTHOR.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\n\n\nALLAN QUATERMAIN MEETS ANSCOMBE\n\n\n\n\n\nYou, my friend, into whose hand, if you live, I hope these\nscribblings of mine will pass one day, must well remember the\n12th of April of the year 1877 at Pretoria.  Sir Theophilus\nShepstone, or Sompseu, for I prefer to call him by his native\nname, having investigated the affairs of the Transvaal for a\ncouple of months or so, had made up his mind to annex that\ncountry to the British Crown.  It so happened that I, Allan\nQuatermain, had been on a shooting and trading expedition at the\nback of the Lydenburg district where there was plenty of game to\nbe killed in those times.  Hearing that great events were toward\nI made up my mind, curiosity being one of my weaknesses, to come\nround by Pretoria, which after all was not very far out of my\nway, instead of striking straight back to Natal.  As it chanced I\nreached the town about eleven o'clock on this very morning of the\n12th of April and, trekking to the Church Square, proceeded to\noutspan there, as was usual in the Seventies.  The place was full\nof people, English and Dutch together, and I noted that the\nformer seemed very elated and were talking excitedly, while the\nlatter for the most part appeared to be sullen and depressed.\n\nPresently I saw a man I knew, a tall, dark man, a very good\nfellow and an excellent shot, named Robinson.  By the way you\nknew him also, for afterwards he was an officer in the Pretoria\nHorse at the time of the Zulu war, the corps in which you held a\ncommission.  I called to him and asked what was up.\n\n\"A good deal, Allan,\" he said as he shook my hand.  \"Indeed we\nshall be lucky if all isn't up, or something like it, before the\nday is over.  Shepstone's Proclamation annexing the Transvaal is\ngoing to be read presently.\"\n\nI whistled and asked,\n\n\"How will our Boer friends take it?  They don't look very\npleased.\"\n\n\"That's just what no one knows, Allan.  Burgers the President is\nsquared, they say.  He is to have a pension; also he thinks it\nthe only thing to be done.  Most of the Hollanders up here don't\nlike it, but I doubt whether they will put out their hands\nfurther than they can draw them back.  The question is--what will\nbe the line of the Boers themselves?  There are a lot of them\nabout, all armed, you see, and more outside the town.\"\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\n\"Can't tell you.  Anything may happen.  They may shoot Shepstone\nand his staff and the twenty-five policemen, or they may just\ngrumble and go home.  Probably they have no fixed plan.\"\n\n\"How about the English?\"\n\n\"Oh! we are all crazy with joy, but of course there is no\norganization and many have no arms.  Also there are only a few of\nus.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I answered, \"I came here to look for excitement, life\nhaving been dull for me of late, and it seems that I have found\nit.  Still I bet you those Dutchmen do nothing, except protest.\nThey are slim and know that the shooting of an unarmed mission\nwould bring England on their heads.\"\n\n\"Can't say, I am sure.  They like Shepstone who understands them,\nand the move is so bold that it takes their breath away.  But as\nthe Kaffirs say, when a strong wind blows a small spark will make\nthe whole veld burn.  It just depends upon whether the spark is\nthere.  If an Englishman and a Boer began to fight for instance,\nanything might happen.  Goodbye, I have got a message to deliver.\nIf things go right we might dine at the European tonight, and if\nthey don't, goodness knows where we shall dine.\"\n\nI nodded sagely and he departed.  Then I went to my wagon to tell\nthe boys not to send the oxen off to graze at present, for I\nfeared lest they should be stolen if there were trouble, but to\nkeep them tied to the trek-tow.  After this I put on the best\ncoat and hat I had, feeling that as an Englishman it was my duty\nto look decent on such an occasion, washed, brushed my hair--with\nme a ceremony without meaning, for it always sticks up--and\nslipped a loaded Smith & Wesson revolver into my inner poacher\npocket.  Then I started out to see the fun, and avoiding the\ngroups of surly-looking Boers, mingled with the crowd that I saw\nwas gathering in front of a long, low building with a broad\nstoep, which I supposed, rightly, to be one of the Government\noffices.\n\nPresently I found myself standing by a tall, rather loosely-built\nman whose face attracted me.  It was clean-shaven and much\nbronzed by the sun, but not in any way good-looking; the features\nwere too irregular and the nose was a trifle too long for good\nlooks.  Still the impression it gave was pleasant and the steady\nblue eyes had that twinkle in them which suggests humour.  He\nmight have been thirty or thirty-five years of age, and\nnotwithstanding his rough dress that consisted mainly of a pair\nof trousers held up by a belt to which hung a pistol, and a\ncommon flannel shirt, for he wore no coat, I guessed at once that\nhe was English-born.\n\nFor a while neither of us said anything after the taciturn habit\nof our people even on the veld, and indeed I was fully occupied\nin listening to the truculent talk of a little party of mounted\nBoers behind us.  I put my pipe into my mouth and began to hunt\nfor my tobacco, taking the opportunity to show the hilt of my\nrevolver, so that these men might see that I was armed.  It was\nnot to be found, I had left it in the wagon.\n\n\"If you smoke Boer tobacco,\" said the stranger, \"I can help you,\"\nand I noted that the voice was as pleasant as the face, and knew\nat once that the owner of it was a gentleman.\n\n\"Thank you, Sir.  I never smoke anything else,\" I answered,\nwhereon he produced from his trousers pocket a pouch made of lion\nskin of unusually dark colour.\n\n\"I never saw a lion as black as this, except once beyond Buluwayo\non the borders of Lobengula's country,\" I said by way of making\nconversation.\n\n\"Curious,\" answered the stranger, \"for that's where I shot the\nbrute a few months ago.  I tried to keep the whole skin but the\nwhite ants got at it.\"\n\n\"Been trading up there?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nothing so useful,\" he said.  \"Just idling and shooting.  Came\nto this country because it was one of the very few I had never\nseen, and have only been here a year.  I think I have had about\nenough of it, though.  Can you tell me of any boats running from\nDurban to India?  I should like to see those wild sheep in\nKashmir.\"\n\nI told him that I did not know for certain as I had never taken\nany interest in India, being an African elephant-hunter and\ntrader, but I thought they did occasionally.  Just then Robinson\npassed by and called to me--\n\n\"They'll be here presently, Quatermain, but Sompseu isn't coming\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Does your name happen to be Allan Quatermain?\" asked the\nstranger.  \"If so I have heard plenty about you up in Lobengula's\ncountry, and of your wonderful shooting.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"but as for the shooting, natives always\nexaggerate.\"\n\n\"They never exaggerated about mine,\" he said with a twinkle in\nhis eye.  \"Anyhow I am very glad to see you in the flesh, though\nin the spirit you rather bored me because I heard too much of\nyou.  Whenever I made a particularly bad miss, my gun-bearer,\nwho at some time seems to have been yours, would say, 'Ah! if\nonly it had been the Inkosi Macumazahn, how different would have\nbeen the end!'  My name is Anscombe, Maurice Anscombe,\" he added\nrather shyly.  (Afterwards I discovered from a book of reference\nthat he was a younger son of Lord Mountford, one of the richest\npeers in England.)\n\nThen we both laughed and he said--\n\n\"Tell me, Mr. Quatermain, if you will, what those Boers are\nsaying behind us.  I am sure it is something unpleasant, but as\nthe only Dutch I know is 'Guten Tag' and 'Vootsack' (Good-day and\nGet out) that takes me no forwarder.\"\n\n\"It ought to,\" I answered, \"for the substance of their talk is\nthat they object to be 'vootsacked' by the British Government as\nrepresented by Sir Theophilus Shepstone.  They are declaring that\nthey won the land 'with their blood' and want to keep their own\nflag flying over it.\"\n\n\"A very natural sentiment,\" broke in Anscombe.\n\n\"They say that they wish to shoot all damned Englishmen,\nespecially Shepstone and his people, and that they would make a\nbeginning now were they not afraid that the damned English\nGovernment, being angered, would send thousands of damned English\nrooibatjes, that is, red-coats, and shoot _them_ out of evil\nrevenge.\"\n\n\"A very natural conclusion,\" laughed Anscombe again, \"which I\nshould advise them to leave untested.  Hush!  Here comes the\nshow.\"\n\nI looked and saw a body of blackcoated gentlemen with one officer\nin the uniform of a Colonel of Engineers, advancing slowly.  I\nremember that it reminded me of a funeral procession following\nthe corpse of the Republic that had gone on ahead out of sight.\nThe procession arrived upon the stoep opposite to us and began to\nsort itself out, whereon the English present raised a cheer and\nthe Boers behind us cursed audibly.  In the middle appeared an\nelderly gentleman with whiskers and a stoop, in whom I recognized\nMr. Osborn, known by the Kaffirs as Malimati, the Chief of the\nStaff.  By his side was a tall young fellow, yourself, my friend,\nscarcely more than a lad then, carrying papers.  The rest stood\nto right and left in a formal line.  _You_ gave a printed\ndocument to Mr. Osborn who put on his glasses and began to read\nin a low voice which few could hear, and I noticed that his hand\ntrembled.  Presently he grew confused, lost his place, found it,\nlost it again and came to a full stop.\n\n\"A nervous-natured man,\" remarked Mr. Anscombe.  \"Perhaps he\nthinks that those gentlemen are going to shoot.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't trouble him,\" I answered, who knew him well.  \"His\nfears are purely mental.\"\n\nThat was true since I know that this same Sir Melmoth Osborn as\nhe is now, as I have told in the book I called _Child of Storm_,\nswam the Tugela alone to watch the battle of Indondakasuka raging\nround him, and on another occasion killed two Kaffirs rushing at\nhim with a right and left shot without turning a hair.  It was\nreading this paper that paralyzed him, not any fear of what might\nhappen.\n\nThere followed a very awkward pause such as occurs when a man\nbreaks down in a speech.  The members of the Staff looked at him\nand at each other, then behold! you, my friend, grabbed the paper\nfrom his hand and went on reading it in a loud clear voice.\n\n\"That young man has plenty of nerve,\" said Mr. Anscombe.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied in a whisper.  \"Quite right though.  Would have\nbeen a bad omen if the thing had come to a stop.\"\n\nWell, there were no more breakdowns, and at last the long\ndocument was finished and the Transvaal annexed.  The Britishers\nbegan to cheer but stopped to listen to the formal protest of the\nBoer Government, if it could be called a government when\neverything had collapsed and the officials were being paid in\npostage stamps.  I can't remember whether this was read by\nPresident Burgers himself or by the officer who was called State\nSecretary.  Anyway, it was read, after which there came an\nawkward pause as though people were waiting to see something\nhappen.  I looked round at the Boers who were muttering and\nhandling their rifles uneasily.  Had they found a leader I really\nthink that some of the wilder spirits among them would have begun\nto shoot, but none appeared and the crisis passed.\n\nThe crowd began to disperse, the English among them cheering and\nthrowing up their hats, the Dutch with very sullen faces.  The\nCommissioner's staff went away as it had come, back to the\nbuilding with blue gums in front of it, which afterwards became\nGovernment House, that is all except you.  You started across the\nsquare alone with a bundle of printed proclamations in your hand\nwhich evidently you had been charged to leave at the various\npublic offices.\n\n\"Let us follow him,\" I said to Mr. Anscombe.  \"He might get into\ntrouble and want a friend.\"\n\nHe nodded and we strolled after you unostentatiously.  Sure\nenough you nearly did get into trouble.  In front of the first\noffice door to which you came, stood a group of Boers, two of\nwhom, big fellows, drew together with the evident intention of\nbarring your way.\n\n\"Mynheeren,\" you said, \"I pray you to let me pass on the Queen's\nbusiness.\"\n\nThey took no heed except to draw closer together and laugh\ninsolently.  Again you made your request and again they laughed.\nThen I saw you lift your leg and deliberately stamp upon the foot\nof one of the Boers.  He drew back with an exclamation, and for a\nmoment I believed that he or his fellow was going to do something\nviolent.  Perhaps they thought better of it, or perhaps they saw\nus two Englishmen behind and noticed Anscombe's pistol.  At any\nrate you marched into the office triumphant and delivered your\ndocument.\n\n\"Neatly done,\" said Mr. Anscombe.\n\n\"Rash,\" I said, shaking my head, \"very rash.  Well, he's young\nand must be excused.\"\n\nBut from that moment I took a great liking to you, my friend,\nperhaps because I wondered whether in your place I should have\nbeen daredevil enough to act in the same way.  For you see I am\nEnglish, and I like to see an Englishman hold his own against\nodds and keep up the credit of the country.  Although, of course,\nI sympathized with the Boers who, through their own fault, were\nlosing their land without a blow struck.  As you know well, for\nyou were living near Majuba at the time, plenty of blows were\nstruck afterwards, but of that business I cannot bear to write.\nI wonder how it will all work out after I am dead and if I shall\never learn what happens in the end.\n\nNow I have only mentioned this business of the Annexation and the\npart you played in it, because it was on that occasion that I\nbecame acquainted with Anscombe.  For you have nothing to do with\nthis story which is about the destruction of the Zulus, the\naccomplishment of the vengeance of Zikali the wizard at the kraal\nnamed Finished, and incidentally, the love affairs of two people\nin which that old wizard took a hand, as I did to my sorrow.\n\nIt happened that Mr. Anscombe had ridden on ahead of his wagons\nwhich could not arrive at Pretoria for a day or two, and as he\nfound it impossible to get accommodation at the European or\nelsewhere, I offered to let him sleep in mine, or rather\nalongside in a tent I had.  He accepted and soon we became very\ngood friends.  Before the day was out I discovered that he had\nserved in a crack cavalry regiment, but resigned his commission\nsome years before.  I asked him why.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I came into a good lot of money on my mother's\ndeath and could not see a prospect of any active service.  While\nthe regiment was abroad I liked the life well enough, but at home\nit bored me.  Too much society for my taste, and that sort of\nthing.  Also I wanted to travel; nothing else really amuses me.\"\n\n\"You will soon get tired of it,\" I answered, \"and as you are well\noff, marry some fine lady and settle down at home.\"\n\n\"Don't think so.  I doubt if I should ever be happily married, I\nwant too much.  One doesn't pick up an earthly angel with a\ncast-iron constitution who adores you, which are the bare\nnecessities of marriage, under every bush.\" Here I laughed.\n\"Also,\" he added, the laughter going out of his eyes, \"I have had\nenough of fine ladies and their ways.\"\n\n\"Marriage is better than scrapes,\" I remarked sententiously.\n\n\"Quite so, but one might get them both together.  No, I shall\nnever marry, although I suppose I ought as my brothers have no\nchildren.\"\n\n\"Won't you, my friend,\" thought I to myself, \"when the skin grows\nagain on your burnt fingers.\"\n\nFor I was sure they had been burnt, perhaps more than once.  How,\nI never learned, for which I am rather sorry for it interests me\nto study burnt fingers, if they do not happen to be my own.  Then\nwe changed the subject.\n\nAnscombe's wagons were delayed for a day or two by a broken axle\nor a bog hole, I forget which.  So, as I had nothing particular\nto do until the Natal post-cart left, we spent the time in\nwandering about Pretoria, which did not take us long as it was\nbut a little dorp in those days, and chatting with all and\nsundry.  Also we went up to Government House as it was now\ncalled, and left cards, or rather wrote our names in a book for\nwe had no cards, being told by one of the Staff whom we met that\nwe should do so.  An hour later a note arrived asking us both to\ndinner that night and telling us very nicely not to mind if we\nhad no dress things.  Of course we had to go, Anscombe rigged up\nin my second best clothes that did not fit him in the least, as\nhe was a much taller man than I am, and a black satin bow that he\nhad bought at Becket's Store together with a pair of shiny pumps.\n\nI actually met you, my friend, for the first time that evening,\nand in trouble too, though you may have forgotten the incident.\nWe had made a mistake about the time of dinner, and arriving half\nan hour too soon, were shown into a long room that opened on to\nthe verandah.  You were working there, being I believe a private\nsecretary at the time, copying some despatch; I think you said\nthat which gave an account of the Annexation.  The room was lit\nby a paraffin lamp behind you, for it was quite dark and the\nwindow was open, or at any rate unshuttered.  The gentleman who\nshowed us in, seeing that you were very busy, took us to the far\nend of the room, where we stood talking in the shadow.  Just then\na door opened opposite to that which led to the verandah, and\nthrough it came His Excellency the Administrator, Sir Theophilus\nShepstone, a stout man of medium height with a very clever,\nthoughtful face, as I have always thought, one of the greatest of\nAfrican statesmen.  He did not see us, but he caught sight of you\nand said testily--\n\n\"Are you mad?\" To which you answered with a laugh--\n\n\"I hope not more than usual, Sir, but why?\"\n\n\"Have I not told you always to let down the blinds after dark?\nYet there you sit with your head against the light, about the\nbest target for a bullet that could be imagined.\"\n\n\"I don't think the Boers would trouble to shoot me, Sir.  If you\nhad been here I would have drawn the blinds and shut the shutters\ntoo,\" you answered, laughing again.\n\n\"Go to dress or you will be late for dinner,\" he said still\nrather sternly, and you went.  But when you had gone and after we\nhad been announced to him, he smiled and added something which I\nwill not repeat to you even now.  I think it was about what you\ndid on the Annexation day of which the story had come to him.\n\nI mention this incident because whenever I think of Shepstone,\nwhom I had known off and on for years in the way that a hunter\nknows a prominent Government official, it always recurs to my\nmind, embodying as it does his caution and appreciation of danger\nderived from long experience of the country, and the sternness he\nsometimes affected which could never conceal his love towards his\nfriends.  Oh! there was greatness in this man, although they did\ncall him an \"African Talleyrand.\"  If it had not been so would\nevery native from the Cape to the Zambesi have known and revered\nhis name, as perhaps that of no other white man has been revered?\nBut I must get on with my tale and leave historical discussions\nto others more fitted to deal with them.\n\nWe had a very pleasant dinner that night, although I was so\nashamed of my clothes with smart uniforms and white ties all\nabout me, and Anscombe kept fidgeting his feet because he was\nsuffering agony from his new pumps which were a size too small.\nEverybody was in the best of spirits, for from all directions\ncame the news that the Annexation was well received and that the\ndanger of any trouble had passed away.  Ah! if we had only known\nwhat the end of it would be!\n\nIt was on our way back to the wagon that I chanced to mention to\nAnscombe that there was still a herd of buffalo within a few\ndays' trek of Lydenburg, of which I had shot two not a month\nbefore.\n\n\"Are there, by Jove!\" he said.  \"As it happens I never got a\nbuffalo; always I just missed them in one sense or another, and I\ncan't leave Africa with a pair of bought horns.  Let's go there\nand shoot some.\"\n\nI shook my head and replied that I had been idling long enough\nand must try to make some money, news at which he seemed very\ndisappointed.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, \"forgive me for mentioning it, but business\nis business.  If you'll come you shan't be a loser.\"\n\nAgain I shook my head, whereat he looked more disappointed than\nbefore.\n\n\"Very well,\" he exclaimed, \"then I must go alone.  For kill a\nbuffalo I will; that is unless the buffalo kills me, in which\ncase my blood will be on your hands.\"\n\nI don't know why, but at that moment there came into my mind a\nconviction that if he did go alone a buffalo or something would\nkill him and that then I should be sorry all my life.\n\n\"They are dangerous brutes, much worse than lions,\" I said.\n\n\"And yet you, who pretend to have a conscience, would expose me\nto their rage unprotected and alone,\" he replied with a twinkle\nin his eye which I could see even by moonlight. \"Oh! Quatermain,\nhow I have been mistaken in your character.\"\n\n\"Look here, Mr. Anscombe,\" I said, \"it's no use.  I cannot\npossibly go on a shooting expedition with you just now.  Only\nto-day I have heard from Natal that my boy is not well and must\nundergo an operation which will lay him up for quite six weeks,\nand may be dangerous.  So I must get down to Durban before it\ntakes place.  After that I have a contract in Matabeleland whence\nyou have just come, to take charge of a trading store there for a\nyear; also perhaps to try to shoot a little ivory for myself.  So\nI am fully booked up till, let us say, October, 1878, that is for\nabout eighteen months, by which time I daresay I shall be dead.\"\n\n\"Eighteen months,\" replied this cool young man.  \"That will suit\nme very well.  I will go on to India as I intended, then home for\na bit and will meet you on the 1st of October, 1878, after which\nwe will proceed to the Lydenburg district and shoot those\nbuffalo, or if they have departed, other buffalo.  Is it a\nbargain?\"\n\nI stared at him, thinking that the Administrator's champagne had\ngot into his head.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" I exclaimed.  \"Who knows where you will be in\neighteen months?  Why, by that time you will have forgotten all\nabout me.\"\n\n\"If I am alive and well, on the 1st of October, 1878, I shall be\nexactly where I am now, upon this very square in Pretoria, with a\nwagon, or wagons, prepared for a hunting trip.  But as not\nunnaturally you have doubts upon that point, I am prepared to pay\nforfeit if I fail, or even if circumstances cause you to fail.\"\n\nHere he took a cheque-book from his letter-case and spread it out\non the little table in the tent, on which there were ink and a\npen, adding--\n\n\"Now, Mr. Quatermain, will it meet your views if I fill this up\nfor #250?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered; \"taking everything into consideration the sum\nis excessive.  But if you do not mind facing the risks of my\nnon-appearance, to say nothing of your own, you may make it #50.\"\n\n\"You are very moderate in your demands,\" he said as he handed me\nthe cheque which I put in my pocket, reflecting that it would\njust pay for my son's operation.\n\n\"And you are very foolish in your offers,\" I replied.  \"Tell me,\nwhy do you make such crack-brained arrangements?\"\n\n\"I don't quite know.  Something in me seems to say that we\n_shall_ make this expedition and that it will have a very\nimportant effect upon my life.  Mind you, it is to be to the\nLydenburg district and nowhere else.  And now I am tired, so\nlet's turn in.\"\n\nNext morning we parted and went our separate ways.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\n\n\nMR. MARNHAM\n\n\n\n\n\nSo much for preliminaries, now for the story.\n\nThe eighteen months had gone by, bringing with them to me their\nshare of adventure, weal and woe, with all of which at present I\nhave no concern.  Behold me arriving very hot and tired in the\npost-cart from Kimberley, whither I had gone to invest what I had\nsaved out of my Matabeleland contract in a very promising\nspeculation whereof, today, the promise remains and no more.  I\nhad been obliged to leave Kimberly in a great hurry, before I\nought indeed, because of the silly bargain which I have just\nrecorded.  Of course I was sure that I should never see Mr.\nAnscombe again, especially as I had heard nothing of him during\nall this while, and had no reason to suppose that he was in\nAfrica.  Still I had taken his #50 and he _might_ come.  Also I\nhave always prided myself upon keeping an appointment.\n\nThe post-cart halted with a jerk in front of the European Hotel,\nand I crawled, dusty and tired, from its interior, to find myself\nface to face with Anscombe, who was smoking a pipe upon the\nstoep!\n\n\"Hullo, Quatermain,\" he said in his pleasant, drawling voice,\n\"here you are, up to time.  I have been making bets with these\nfive gentlemen,\" and he nodded at a group of loungers on the\nstoep, \"as to whether you would or would not appear, I putting\nten to one on you in drinks.  Therefore you must now consume five\nwhiskies and sodas, which will save them from consuming fifty and\na subsequent appearance at the Police Court.\"\n\nI laughed and said I would be their debtor to the extent of one,\nwhich was duly produced.\n\nAfter it was drunk Anscombe and I had a chat.  He said that he\nhad been to India, shot, or shot at whatever game he meant to\nkill there, visited his relations in England and thence proceeded\nto keep his appointment with me in Africa.  At Durban he had\nfitted himself out in a regal way with two wagons, full teams,\nand some spare oxen, and trekked to Pretoria where he had arrived\na few days before.  Now he was ready to start for the Lydenburg\ndistrict and look for those buffalo.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"the buffalo probably long ago departed.  Also\nthere has been a war with Sekukuni, the Basuto chief who rules\nall that country, which remains undecided, although I believe\nsome kind of a peace has been patched up.  This may make hunting\nin this neighborhood dangerous.  Why not try some other ground,\nto the north of the Transvaal, for instance?\"\n\n\"Quatermain,\" he answered, \"I have come all the way from England,\nI will not say to kill, but to try to kill buffalo in the\nLydenburg district, with you if possible, if not, without you,\nand thither I am going.  If you think it unsafe to accompany me,\ndon't come; I will get on as best I can alone, or with some other\nskilled person if I can find one.\"\n\n\"If you put it like that I shall certainly come,\" I replied,\n\"with the proviso that should the buffalo prove to be\nnon-existent or the pursuit of them impossible, we either give up\nthe trip, or go somewhere else, perhaps to the country at the\nback of Delagoa Bay.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" he said; after which we discussed terms, he paying me\nmy salary in advance.\n\nOn further consideration we determined, as two were quite\nunnecessary for a trip of the sort, to leave one of my wagons and\nhalf the cattle in charge of a very respectable man, a farmer who\nlived about five miles from Pretoria just over the pass near to\nthe famous Wonder-boom tree which is one of the sights of the\nplace.  Should we need this wagon it could always be sent for;\nor, if we found the Lydenburg hunting-ground, which he was so set\nupon visiting, unproductive or impossible, we could return to\nPretoria over the high-veld and pick it up before proceeding\nelsewhere.\n\nThese arrangements took us a couple of days or so.  On the third\nwe started, without seeing you, my friend, or any one else that I\nknew, since just at that time every one seemed to be away from\nPretoria.  You, I remember, had by now become the Master of the\nHigh Court and were, they informed me at your office, absent on\ncircuit.\n\nThe morning of our departure was particularly lovely and we\ntrekked away in the best of spirits, as so often happens to\npeople who are marching into trouble.  Of our journey there is\nlittle to say as everything went smoothly, so that we arrived at\nthe edge of the high-veld feeling as happy as the country which\nhas no history is reported to do.  Our road led us past the\nlittle mining settlement of Pilgrim's Rest where a number of\nadventurous spirits, most of them English, were engaged in\nwashing for gold, a job at which I once took a turn near this\nvery place without any startling success.  Of the locality I need\nonly say that the mountainous scenery is among the most\nbeautiful, the hills are the steepest and the roads are, or were,\nthe worst that I have ever travelled over in a wagon.\n\nHowever, \"going softly\" as the natives say, we negotiated them\nwithout accident and, leaving Pilgrim's Rest behind us, began to\ndescend towards the low-veld where I was informed a herd of\nbuffalo could still be found, since, owing to the war with\nSekukuni, no one had shot at them of late.  This war had been\nsuspended for a while, and the Land-drost at Pilgrim's Rest told\nme he thought it would be safe to hunt on the borders of that\nChief's country, though he should not care to do so himself.\n\nGame of the smaller sort began to be plentiful about here, so not\nmore than a dozen miles from Pilgrim's Rest we outspanned early\nin the afternoon to try to get a blue wildebeeste or two, for I\nhad seen the spoor of these creatures in a patch of soft ground,\nor failing them some other buck.  Accordingly, leaving the wagon\nby a charming stream that wound and gurgled over a bed of\ngranite, we mounted our salted horses, which were part of\nAnscombe's outfit, and set forth rejoicing.  Riding through the\nscattered thorns and following the spoor where I could, within\nhalf an hour we came to a little glade.  There, not fifty yards\naway, I caught sight of a single blue wildebeeste bull standing in the\nshadow of the trees on the further side of the glade, and pointed\nout the ugly beast, for it is the most grotesque of all the\nantelopes, to Anscombe.\n\n\"Off you get,\" I whispered.  \"It's a lovely shot, you can't miss\nit.\"\n\n\"Oh, can't I!\" replied Anscombe.  \"Do you shoot.\"\n\nI refused, so he dismounted, giving me his horse to hold, and\nkneeling down solemnly and slowly covered the bull.  Bang went\nhis rifle, and I saw a bough about a yard above the wildebeeste\nfall on to its back.  Off it went like lightning, whereon\nAnscombe let drive with the left barrel of the Express, almost at\nhazard as it seemed to me, and by some chance hit it above the\nnear fore-knee, breaking its leg.\n\n\"That was a good shot,\" he cried, jumping on to his horse.\n\n\"Excellent,\" I answered.  \"But what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Catch it.  It is cruel to leave a wounded animal,\" and off he\nstarted.\n\nOf course I had to follow, but the ensuing ride remains among the\nmore painful of my hunting memories.  We tore through thorn trees\nthat scratched my face and damaged my clothes; we struck a patch\nof antbear holes, into one of which my horse fell so that my\nstomach bumped against its head; we slithered down granite\nkoppies, and this was the worst of it, at the end of each\nchapter, so to speak, always caught sight of that accursed bull\nwhich I fondly hoped would have vanished into space.  At length\nafter half an hour or so of this game we reached a stretch of\nopen, rolling ground, and there not fifty yards ahead of us was\nthe animal still going like a hare, though how it could do so on\nthree legs I am sure I do not know.  We coursed it like\ngreyhounds, till at last Anscombe, whose horse was the faster,\ncame alongside of the exhausted creature, whereon it turned\nsuddenly and charged.\n\nAnscombe held out his rifle in his right hand and pulled the\ntrigger, which, as he had forgotten to reload it, was a mere\ntheatrical performance.  Next second there was such a mix-up that\nfor a while I could not distinguish which was Anscombe, which was\nthe wildebeeste, and which the horse.  They all seemed to be\ngoing round and round in a cloud of dust.  When things settled\nthemselves a little I discovered the horse rolling on the ground,\nAnscombe on his back with his hands up in an attitude of prayer\nand the wildebeeste trying to make up its mind which of them it\nshould finish first.  I settled the poor thing's doubts by\nshooting it through the heart, which I flatter myself was rather\nclever of me under the circumstances.  Then I dismounted to\nexamine Anscombe, who, I presumed, was done for.  Not a bit of\nit.  There he sat upon the ground blowing like a blacksmith's\nbellows and panting out--\n\n\"What a glorious gallop.  I finished it very well, didn't I?  You\ncouldn't have made a better shot yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"you finished it very well as you will find\nout if you will take the trouble to open your rifle and count\nyour cartridges.  I may add that if we are going to hunt together\nI hope you will never lead me such a fool's chase again.\"\n\nHe rose, opened the rifle and saw that it was empty, for although\nhe had never re-loaded he had thrown out the two cartridges which\nhe had discharged in the glen.\n\n\"By Jingo,\" he said, \"you must have shot it, though I could have\nsworn that it was I.  Quatermain, has it ever struck you what a\nstrange thing is the human imagination?\"\n\n\"Drat the human imagination,\" I answered, wiping away the blood\nthat was trickling into my eye from a thorn scratch.  \"Let's look\nat your horse.  If it is lamed you will have to ride Imagination\nback to the wagon which must be six miles away, that is if we can\nfind it before dark.\"\n\nSighing out something about a painfully practical mind, he\nobeyed, and when the beast was proved to be nothing more than\nblown and a little bruised, made remarks as to the inadvisability\nof dwelling on future evil events, which I reminded him had\nalready been better summed up in the New Testament.\n\nAfter this we contemplated the carcasse of the wildebeeste which\nit seemed a pity to leave to rot.  Just then Anscombe, who had\nmoved a few yards to the right out of the shadow of an\nobstructing tree, exclaimed--\n\n\"I say, Quatermain, come here and tell me if I have been knocked\nsilly, or if I really see a quite uncommon kind of house built in\nancient Greek style set in a divine landscape.\"\n\n\"Temple to Diana, I expect,\" I remarked as I joined him on the\nfurther side of the tree.\n\nI looked and rubbed my eyes.  There, about half a mile away,\nsituated in a bay of the sweeping hills and overlooking the\nmeasureless expanse of bush-veld beneath, was a remarkable house,\nat least for those days and that part of Africa.  To begin with\nthe situation was superb.  It stood on a green and swelling mound\nbehind which was a wooded kloof where ran a stream that at last\nprecipitated itself in a waterfall over a great cliff.  Then in\nfront was that glorious view of the bush-veld, at which a man\nmight look for a lifetime and not grow tired, stretching away to\nthe Oliphant's river and melting at last into the dim line of the\nhorizon.\n\nThe house itself also, although not large, was of a kind new to\nme.  It was deep, but narrow fronted, and before it were four\ncolumns that carried the roof which projected so as to form a\nwide verandah.  Moreover it seemed to be built of marble which\nglistened like snow in the setting sun.  In short in that lonely\nwilderness, at any rate from this distance, it did look like the\ndeserted shrine of some forgotten god.\n\n\"Well, I'm bothered!\" I said.\n\n\"So am I,\" answered Anscombe, \"to know the name of the Lydenburg\ndistrict architect whom I should like to employ; though I suspect\nit is the surroundings that make the place look so beautiful.\nHullo! here comes somebody, but he doesn't look like an\narchitect; he looks like a wicked baronet disguised as a Boer.\"\n\nTrue enough, round a clump of bush appeared an unusual looking\nperson, mounted on a very good horse.  He was tall, thin and old,\nat least he had a long white beard which suggested age, although\nhis figure, so far as it could be seen beneath his rough clothes,\nseemed vigorous.  His face was clean cut and handsome, with a\nrather hooked nose, and his eyes were grey, but as I saw when he\ncame up to us, somewhat bloodshot at the corners.  His general\naspect was refined and benevolent, and as soon as he opened his\nmouth I perceived that he was a person of gentle breeding.\n\nAnd yet there was something about him, something in his\natmosphere, so to speak, that I did not like.  Before we parted\nthat evening I felt sure that in one way or another he was a\nwrong-doer, not straight; also that he had a violent temper.\n\nHe rode up to us and asked in a pleasant voice, although the\nmanner of his question, which was put in bad Dutch, was not\npleasant,\n\n\"Who gave you leave to shoot on our land?\"\n\n\"I did not know that any leave was required; it is not customary\nin these parts,\" I answered politely in English.  \"Moreover, this\nbuck was wounded miles away.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed in the same tongue, \"that makes a difference,\nthough I expect it was still on our land, for we have a lot; it\nis cheap about here.\"  Then after studying a little, he added\napologetically, \"You mustn't think me strange, but the fact is my\ndaughter hates things to be killed near the house, which is why\nthere's so much game about.\"\n\n\"Then pray make her our apologies,\" said Anscombe, \"and say that\nit shall not happen again.\"\n\nHe stroked his long beard and looked at us, for by now he had\ndismounted, then said--\n\n\"Might I ask you gentlemen your names?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied.  \"I am Allan Quatermain and my friend is\nthe Hon. Maurice Anscombe.\"\n\nHe started and said--\n\n\"Of Allan Quatermain of course I have heard.  The natives told me\nthat you were trekking to those parts; and if you, sir, are one\nof Lord Mountford's sons, oddly enough I think I must have known\nyour father in my youth.  Indeed I served with him in the\nGuards.\"\n\n\"How very strange,\" said Anscombe.  \"He's dead now and my brother\nis Lord Mountford.  Do you like life here better than that in the\nGuards?  I am sure I should.\"\n\n\"Both of them have their advantages,\" he answered evasively, \"of\nwhich, if, as I think, you are also a soldier, you can judge for\nyourself.  But won't you come up to the house?  My daughter Heda\nis away, and my partner Mr. Rodd\" (as he mentioned this name I\nsaw a blue vein, which showed above his cheek bone, swell as\nthough under pressure of some secret emotion) \"is a retiring sort\nof a man--indeed some might think him sulky until they came to\nknow him.  Still, we can make you comfortable and even give you a\ndecent bottle of wine.\"\n\n\"No, thank you very much,\" I answered, \"we must get back to the\nwagon or our servants will think that we have come to grief.\nPerhaps you will accept the wildebeeste if it is of any use to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he said in a voice that suggested regret struggling\nwith relief.  To the buck he made no allusion, perhaps because he\nconsidered that it was already his own property.  \"Do you know\nyour way?  I believe your wagon is camped out there to the east\nby what we call the Granite stream.  If you follow this Kaffir\npath,\" and he pointed to a track near by, \"it will take you quite\nclose.\"\n\n\"Where does the path run to?\"  I asked.  \"There are no kraals\nabout, are there?\"\n\n\"Oh! to the Temple, as my daughter calls our house.  My partner\nand I are labour agents, we recruit natives for the Kimberley\nMines,\" he said in explanation, adding, \"Where do you propose to\nshoot?\"\n\nI told him.\n\n\"Isn't that rather a risky district?\" he said.  \"I think that\nSekukuni will soon be giving more trouble, although there is a\ntruce between him and the English.  Still he might send a\nregiment to raid that way.\"\n\nI wondered how our friend knew so much of Sekukuni's possible\nintentions, but only answered that I was accustomed to deal with\nnatives and did not fear them.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"well, you know your own business best.  But if\nyou should get into any difficulty, make straight for this place.\nThe Basutos will not interfere with you here.\"\n\nAgain I wondered why the Basutos should look upon this particular\nspot as sacred, but thinking it wisest to ask no questions, I\nonly answered--\n\n\"Thank you very much.  We'll bear your invitation in mind, Mr.--\"\n\n\"Marnham.\"\n\n\"Marnham,\" I repeated after him.  \"Good-bye and many thanks for\nyour kindness.\"\n\n\"One question,\" broke in Anscombe, \"if you will not think me\nrude.  What is the name of the architect who designed that most\nromantic-looking house of yours which seems to be built of\nmarble?\"\n\n\"My daughter designed it, or at least I think she copied it from\nsome old drawing of a ruin.  Also it _is_ marble; there's a whole\nhill of the stuff not a hundred yards from the door, so it was\ncheaper to use than anything else.  I hope you will come and see\nit on your way back, though it is not as fine as it appears from\na distance.  It would be very pleasant after all these years to\ntalk to an English gentleman again.\"\n\nThen we parted, I rather offended because he did not seem to\ninclude me in the description, he calling after us--\n\n\"Stick close to the path through the patch of big trees, for the\nground is rather swampy there and it's getting dark.\"\n\nPresently we came to the place he mentioned where the timber,\nalthough scattered, was quite large for South Africa, of the\nyellow-wood species, and interspersed wherever the ground was dry\nwith huge euphorbias, of which the tall finger-like growths and\nsad grey colouring looked unreal and ghostlike in the waning\nlight.  Following the advice given to us, we rode in single file\nalong the narrow path, fearing lest otherwise we should tumble\ninto some bog hole, until we came to higher land covered with the\nscattered thorns of the country.\n\n\"Did that bush give you any particular impression?\" asked\nAnscombe a minute or two later.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"it gave me the impression that we might catch\nfever there.  See the mist that lies over it,\" and turning in my\nsaddle I pointed with the rifle in my hand to what looked like a\nmass of cotton wool over which, without permeating it, hung the\nlast red glow of sunset, producing a curious and indeed rather\nunearthly effect.  \"I expect that thousands of years ago there\nwas a lake yonder, which is why trees grow so big in the rich\nsoil.\"\n\n\"You are curiously mundane, Quatermain,\" he answered.  \"I ask you\nof spiritual impressions and you dilate to me of geological\nformations and the growth of timber.  You felt nothing in the\nspiritual line?\"\n\n\"I felt nothing except a chill,\" I answered, for I was tired and\nhungry.  \"What the devil are you driving at?\"\n\n\"Have you got that flask of Hollands about you, Quatermain?\"\n\n\"Oh! those are the spirits you are referring to,\" I remarked with\nsarcasm as I handed it to him.\n\nHe took a good pull and replied--\n\n\"Not at all, except in the sense that bad spirits require good\nspirits to correct them, as the Bible teaches.  To come to\nfacts,\" he added in a changed voice, \"I have never been in a\nplace that depressed me more than that thrice accursed patch of\nbush.\"\n\n\"Why did it depress you?\" I asked, studying him as well as I\ncould in the fading light.  To tell the truth I feared lest he\nhad knocked his head when the wildebeeste upset him, and was\nsuffering from delayed concussion.\n\n\"Can't tell you, Quatermain.  I don't look like a criminal, do I?\nWell, I entered those trees feeling a fairly honest man, and I\ncame out of them feeling like a murderer.  It was as though\nsomething terrible had happened to me there; it was as though I\nhad killed someone there.  Ugh!\" and he shivered and took another\npull at the Hollands.\n\n\"What bosh!\" I said.  \"Besides, even if it were to come true, I\nam sorry to say I've killed lots of men in the way of business\nand they don't bother me overmuch.\"\n\n\"Did you ever kill one to win a woman?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.  Why, that would be murder.  How can you ask me\nsuch a thing?  But I have killed several to win cattle,\" I\nreflected aloud, remembering my expedition with Saduko against\nthe chief Bangu, and some other incidents in my career.\n\n\"I appreciate the difference, Quatermain.  If you kill for cows,\nit is justifiable homicide; if you kill for women, it is murder.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"that is how it seems to work out in Africa.\nYou see, women are higher in the scale of creation than cows,\ntherefore crimes committed for their sake are enormously greater\nthan those committed for cows, which just makes the difference\nbetween justifiable homicide and murder.\"\n\n\"Good lord! what an argument,\" he exclaimed and relapsed into\nsilence.  Had he been accustomed to natives and their ways he\nwould have understood the point much better than he did, though I\nadmit it is difficult to explain.\n\nIn due course we reached the wagon without further trouble.\nWhile we were shielding our pipes after an excellent supper I\nasked Anscombe his impressions of Mr. Marnham.\n\n\"Queer cove, I think,\" he answered.  \"Been a gentleman, too, and\nstill keeps the manners, which isn't strange if he is one of the\nMarnhams, for they are a good family.  I wonder he mentioned\nhaving served with my father.\"\n\n\"It slipped out of him.  Men who live a lot alone are apt to be\nsurprised into saying things they regret afterwards, as I noticed\nhe did.  But why do you wonder?\"\n\n\"Because as it happens, although I have only just recalled it, my\nfather used to tell some story about a man named Marnham in his\nregiment.  I can't remember the details, but it had to do with\ncards when high stakes were being played for, and with the\nstriking of a superior officer in the quarrel that ensued, as a\nresult of which the striker was requested to send in his papers.\"\n\n\"It may not have been the same man.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not, for I believe that more than one Marnham served in\nthat regiment.  But I remember my father saying, by way of excuse\nfor the person concerned, that he had a most ungovernable temper.\nI think he added, that he left the country and took service in\nsome army on the Continent.  I should rather like to clear the\nthing up.\"\n\n\"It isn't probable that you will, for even if you should ever\nmeet this Marnham again, I fancy you would find he held his\ntongue about his acquaintance with your father.\"\n\n\"I wonder what Miss Heda is like,\" went on Anscombe after a\npause.  \"I am curious to see a girl who designs a house on the\nmodel of an ancient ruin.\"\n\n\"Well, you won't, for she's away somewhere.  Besides we are\nlooking for buffalo, not girls, which is a good thing as they are\nless dangerous.\"\n\nI spoke thus decisively because I had taken a dislike to Mr.\nMarnham and everything to do with him, and did not wish to\nencourage the idea of further meetings.\n\n\"No, never, I suppose.  And yet I feel as though I were certainly\ndestined to see that accursed yellow-wood swamp again.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" I replied as I rose to turn in.  Ah! if I had but\nknown!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\n\n\nTHE HUNTERS HUNTED\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I was taking off my boots I heard a noise of jabbering in\nsome native tongue which I took to be Sisutu, and not wishing to\ngo to the trouble of putting them on again, called to the driver\nof the wagon to find out what it was.  This man was a Cape Colony\nKaffir, a Fingo I think, with a touch of Hottentot in him.  He\nwas an excellent driver, indeed I do not think I have ever seen a\nbetter, and by no means a bad shot.  Among Europeans he rejoiced\nin the name of Footsack, a Boer Dutch term which is generally\naddressed to troublesome dogs and means \"Get out.\"  To tell the\ntruth, had I been his master he would have got out, as I\nsuspected him of drinking, and generally did not altogether trust\nhim.  Anscombe, however, was fond of him because he had shown\ncourage in some hunting adventure in Matabeleland, I think it was\nat the shooting of that very dark-coloured lion whose skin had\nbeen the means of making us acquainted nearly two years before.\nIndeed he said that on this occasion Footsack had saved his life,\nthough from all that I could gather I do not think this was quite\nthe case.  Also the man, who had been on many hunting trips with\nsportsmen, could talk Dutch well and English enough to make\nhimself understood, and therefore was useful.\n\nHe went as I bade him, and coming back presently, told me that a\nparty of Basutos, about thirty in number, who were returning from\nKimberley, where they had been at work in the mines, under the\nleadership of a Bastard named Karl, asked leave to camp by the\nwagon for the night, as they were afraid to go on to \"Tampel\" in\nthe dark.\n\nAt first I could not make out what \"Tampel\" was, as it did not\nsound like a native name.  Then I remembered that Mr. Marnham had\nspoken of his house as being called the Temple, of which, of\ncourse, Tampel was a corruption; also that he said he and his\npartner were labour agents.\n\n\"Why are they afraid?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because, Baas, they say that they must go through a wood in a\nswamp, which they think is haunted by spooks, and they much\nafraid of spooks;\" that is of ghosts.\n\n\"What spooks?\" I asked.\n\n\"Don't know, Baas.  They say spook of some one who has been\nkilled.\"\n\n\"Rubbish,\" I replied.  \"Tell them to go and catch the spook; we\ndon't want a lot of noisy fellows howling chanties here all\nnight.\"\n\nThen it was that Anscombe broke in in his humorous, rather\ndrawling voice.\n\n\"How can you be so hard-hearted, Quatermain?  After the\nsupernatural terror which, as I told you, I experienced in that\nvery place, I wouldn't condemn a kicking mule to go through it in\nthis darkness.  Let the poor devils stay; I daresay they are\ntired.\"\n\nSo I gave in, and presently saw their fires beginning to burn\nthrough the end canvas of the wagon which was unlaced because the\nnight was hot.  Also later on I woke up, about midnight I think,\nand heard voices talking, one of which I reflected sleepily,\nsounded very like that of Footsack.\n\nWaking very early, as is my habit, I peeped out of the wagon, and\nthrough the morning mist perceived Footsack in converse with a\nparticularly villainous-looking person.  I at once concluded this\nmust be Karl, evidently a Bastard compounded of about fifteen\nparts of various native bloods to one of white, who, to add to\nhis attractions, was deeply scarred with smallpox and possessed a\nreally alarming squint.  It seemed to me that Footsack handed to\nthis man something that looked suspiciously like a bottle of\nsquareface gin wrapped up in dried grass, and that the man handed\nback to Footsack some small object which he put in his mouth.\n\nNow, I wondered to myself, what is there of value that one who\ndoes not eat sweets would stow away in his mouth.  Gold coin\nperhaps, or a quid of tobacco, or a stone.  Gold was too much to\npay for a bottle of gin, tobacco was too little, but how about\nthe stone?  What stone?  Who wanted stones?  Then suddenly I\nremembered that these people were said to come from Kimberley,\nand whistled to myself.  Still I did nothing, principally because\nthe mist was still so dense that although I could see the men's\nfaces, I could not clearly see the articles which they passed to\neach other about two feet lower, where it still lay very thickly,\nand to bring any accusation against a native which he can prove\nto be false is apt to destroy authority.  So I held my tongue and\nwaited my chance.  It did not come at once, for before I was\ndressed those Basutos had departed together with their leader\nKarl, for now that the sun was up they no longer feared the\nhaunted bush.\n\nIt came later, thus: We were trekking along between the thorns\nupon a level and easy track which enabled the driver Footsack to\nsit upon the \"voorkisse\" or driving box of the wagon, leaving the\nlad who is called the voorlooper to lead the oxen.  Anscombe was\nriding parallel to the wagon in the hope of killing some\nguineafowl for the pot (though a very poor shot with a rifle he\nwas good with a shot-gun).  I, who did not care for this small\ngame, was seated smoking by the side of Footsack who, I noted,\nsmelt of gin and generally showed signs of dissipation.  Suddenly\nI said to him--\n\n\"Show me that diamond which the Bastard Karl gave you this\nmorning in payment for the bottle of your master's drink.\"\n\nIt was a bow drawn at a venture, but the effect of the shot was\nremarkable.  Had I not caught it, the long bamboo whip Footsack\nheld would have fallen to the ground, while he collapsed in his\nseat like a man who has received a bullet in his stomach.\n\n\"Baas,\" he gasped, \"Baas, how did you know?\"\n\n\"I knew,\" I replied grandly, \"in the same way that I know\neverything.  Show me the diamond.\"\n\n\"Baas,\" he said, \"it was not the Baas Anscombe's gin, it was some\nI bought in Pilgrim's Rest.\"\n\n\"I have counted the bottles in the case and know very well whose\ngin it was,\" I replied ambiguously, for the reason that I had\ndone nothing of the sort.  \"Show me the diamond.\"\n\nFootsack fumbled about his person, his hair, his waistcoat\npockets and even his moocha, and ultimately from somewhere\nproduced a stone which he handed to me.  I looked at it, and from\nthe purity of colour and size, judged it to be a diamond worth\n#200, or possibly more.  After careful examination I put it into\nmy pocket, saying,\n\n\"This is the price of your master's gin and therefore belongs to\nhim as much as it does to anybody.  Now if you want to keep out\nof trouble, tell me--whence came it into the hands of that man,\nKarl?\"\n\n\"Baas,\" replied Footsack, trembling all over, \"how do I know?  He\nand the rest have been working at the mines; I suppose he found\nit there.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  And did he find others of the same sort?\"\n\n\"I think so, Baas.  At least he said that he had been buying\nbottles of gin with such stones all the way down from Kimberley.\nKarl is a great drunkard, Baas, as I am sure, who have known him\nfor years.\"\n\n\"That is not all,\" I remarked, keeping my eyes fixed on him.\n\"What else did he say?\"\n\n\"He said, Baas, that he was very much afraid of returning to the\nBaas Marnham whom the Kaffirs call White-beard, with only a few\nstones left.\"\n\n\"Why was he afraid?\"\n\n\"Because the Baas Whitebeard, he who dwells at Tampel, is, he\nsays, a very angry man if he thinks himself cheated, and Karl is\nafraid lest he should kill him as another was killed, he whose\nspook haunts the wood through which those silly people feared to\npass last night.\"\n\n\"Who was killed and who killed him?\" I asked.\n\n\"Baas, I don't know,\" replied Footsack, collapsing into sullen\nsilence in a way that Kaffirs have when suddenly they realize\nthat they have said too much.  Nor did I press the matter\nfurther, having learned enough.\n\nWhat had I learned?  This: that Messrs. Marnham & Rodd were\nillicit diamond buyers, I.D.B.'s as they are called, who had\ncunningly situated themselves at a great distance from the scene\nof operations practically beyond the reach of civilized law.\nProbably they were engaged also in other nefarious dealings with\nKaffirs, such as supplying them with guns wherewith to make war\nupon the Whites.  Sekukuni had been fighting us recently, so that\nthere would be a very brisk market for rifles.  This, too, would\naccount for Marnham's apparent knowledge of that Chief's plans.\nPossibly, however, he had no knowledge and only made a pretence\nof it to keep us out of the country.\n\nLater on I confided the whole story and my suspicions to\nAnscombe, who was much interested.\n\n\"What picturesque scoundrels!\" he exclaimed, \"We really ought to\ngo back to the Temple.  I have always longed to meet some real\nlive I.D.B.'s.\"\n\n\"It is probable that you have done that already without knowing\nit.  For the rest, if you wish to visit that den of iniquity, you\nmust do so alone.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't whited sepulchre be a better term, especially as it\nseems to cover dead men's bones?\" he replied in his frivolous\nmanner.\n\nThen I asked him what he was going to do about Footsack and the\nbottle of gin, which he countered by asking me what I was going\nto do with that diamond.\n\n\"Give it to you as Footsack's master,\" I said, suiting the action\nto the word.  \"I don't wish to be mixed up in doubtful\ntransactions.\"\n\nThen followed a long argument as to who was the real owner of the\nstone, which ended in its being hidden away be produced if called\nfor, and in Footsack, who ought have had a round dozen, receiving\na scolding from his master, coupled with the threat that if he\nstole more gin he would be handed over to a magistrate--when we\nmet one.\n\nOn the following day we reached the hot, low-lying veld which the\nherd of buffalo was said to inhabit.  Next morning, however, when\nwe were making ready to begin hunting, a Basuto Kaffir appeared\nwho, on being questioned, said that he was one of Sekukuni's\npeople sent to this district to look for two lost oxen.  I did\nnot believe this story, thinking it more probable that he was a\nspy, but asked him whether in his hunt for oxen he had come\nacross buffalo.\n\nHe replied that he had, a herd of thirty-two of them, counting\nthe calves, but that they were over the Oliphant's River about\nfive-and-twenty miles away, in a valley between some outlying\nhills and the rugged range of mountains, beyond which was\nsituated Sekukuni's town.  Moreover, in proof of his story he\nshowed me spoor of the beasts heading in that direction which was\nquite a week old.\n\nNow for my part, as I did not think it wise to get too near to\nSekukuni, I should have given them up and gone to hunt something\nelse.  Anscombe, however, was of a different opinion and pleaded\nhard that we should follow them.  They were the only herd within\na hundred miles, he said, if indeed there were any others this\nside of the Lebombo Mountains.  As I still demurred, he\nsuggested, in the nicest possible manner, that if I thought the\nbusiness risky, I should camp somewhere with the wagon, while he\nwent on with Footsack to look for the buffalo.  I answered that I\nwas well used to risks, which in a sense were my trade, and that\nas he was more or less in my charge I was thinking of him, not of\nmyself, who was quite prepared to follow the buffalo, not only to\nSekukuni's Mountains but over them.  Then fearing that he had\nhurt my feelings, he apologized, and offered to go elsewhere if I\nliked.  The upshot was that we decided to trek to the Oliphant's\nRiver, camp there and explore the bush on the other side on\nhorseback, never going so far from the wagon that we could not\nreach it again before nightfall.\n\nThis, then, we did, outspanning that evening by the hot but\nbeautiful river which was still haunted by a few hippopotamus and\nmany crocodiles, one of which we shot before turning in.  Next\nmorning, having breakfasted off cold guineafowl, we mounted,\ncrossed the river by a ford that was quite as deep as I liked, to\nwhich the Kaffir path led us, and, leaving Footsack with the two\nother boys in charge of the wagon, began to hunt for the buffalo\nin the rather swampy bush that stretched from the further bank to\nthe slope of the first hills, eight or ten miles away.  I did not\nmuch expect to find them, as the Basuto had said that they had\ngone over these hills, but either he lied or they had moved back\nagain.\n\nNot half a mile from the river bank, just as I was about to\ndismount to stalk a fine waterbuck of which I caught sight\nstanding among some coarse grass and bushes, my eye fell upon\nbuffalo spoor that from its appearance I knew could not be more\nthan a few hours old.  Evidently the beasts had been feeding here\nduring the night and at dawn had moved away to sleep in the dry\nbush nearer the hills.  Beckoning to Anscombe, who fortunately\nhad not seen the waterbuck, at which he would certainly have\nfired, thereby perhaps frightening the buffalo, I showed him the\nspoor that we at once started to follow.\n\nSoon it led us into other spoor, that of a whole herd of thirty\nor forty beasts indeed, which made our task quite easy, at least\ntill we came to harder ground, for the animals had gone a long\nway.  An hour or more later, when we were about seven miles from\nthe river, I perceived ahead of us, for we were now almost at the\nfoot of the hills, a cool and densely-wooded kloof.\n\n\"That is where they will be,\" I said.  \"Now come on carefully and\nmake no noise.\"\n\nWe rode to the wide mouth of the kloof where the signs of the\nbuffalo were numerous and fresh, dismounted and tied our horses\nto a thorn, so as to approach them silently on foot.  We had not\ngone two hundred yards through the bush when suddenly about fifty\npaces away, standing broadside on in the shadow between two\ntrees, I saw a splendid old bull with a tremendous pair of horns.\n\n\"Shoot,\" I whispered to Anscombe, \"you will never get a better\nchance.  It is the sentinel of the herd.\"\n\nHe knelt down, his face quite white with excitement, and covered\nthe bull with his Express.\n\n\"Keep cool,\" I whispered again, \"and aim behind the shoulder,\nhalf-way down.\"\n\nI don't think he understood me, for at that moment off went the\nrifle.  He hit the beast somewhere, as I heard the bullet clap,\nbut not fatally, for it turned and lumbered off up the kloof,\napparently unhurt, whereon he sent the second barrel after it, a\nclean miss this time.  Then of a sudden all about us appeared\nbuffaloes that had, I suppose, been sleeping invisible to us.\nThese, with snorts and bellows, rushed off towards the river, for\nhaving their senses about them, they had no mind to be trapped in\nthe kloof.  I could only manage a shot at one of them, a large\nand long-horned cow which I knocked over quite dead.  If I had\nfired again it would have been but to wound, a thing I hate.  The\nwhole business was over in a minute.  We went and looked at my\ndead cow which I had caught through the heart.\n\n\"It's cruel to kill these things,\" I said, \"for I don't know what\nuse we are going to make of them, and they must love life as much\nas we do.\"\n\n\"We'll cut the horns off,\" said Anscombe.\n\n\"You may if you like,\" I answered, \"but you will find it a tough\njob with a sheath knife.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think that shall be the task of the worthy Footsack\nto-morrow,\" he replied.  \"Meanwhile let us go and finish off my\nbull, as Footsack & Co. may as well bring home two pair of horns\nas one.\"\n\nI looked at the dense bush, and knowing something of the habits\nof wounded buffaloes, reflected that it would be a nasty job.\nStill I said nothing, because if I hesitated, I knew he would\nwant to go alone.  So we started.  Evidently the beast had been\nbadly hit, for the blood spoor was easy to follow.  Yet it had\nbeen able to retreat up to the end of the kloof that terminated\nin a cliff over which trickled a stream of water.  Here it was\nnot more than a hundred paces wide, and on either side of it were\nother precipitous cliffs.  As we went from one of these a\nwar-horn, such as the Basutos use, was blown.  Although I heard\nit, oddly enough, I paid no attention to it at the time, being\nutterly intent upon the business in hand.\n\nFollowing a wounded buffalo bull up a tree-clad and stony kloof\nis no game for children, as these beasts have a habit of\nreturning on their tracks and then rushing out to gore you.  So I\nwent on with every sense alert, keeping Anscombe well behind me.\nAs it happened our bull had either been knocked silly or\ninherited no guile from his parents.  When he found he could go\nno further he stopped, waited behind a bush, and when he saw us\nhe charged in a simple and primitive fashion.  I let Anscombe\nfire, as I wished him to have the credit of killing it all to\nhimself, but somehow or other he managed to miss both barrels.\nThen, trouble being imminent, I let drive as the beast lowered\nits head, and was lucky enough to break its spine (to shoot at\nthe head of a buffalo is useless), so that it rolled over quite\ndead at our feet.\n\n\"You have got a magnificent pair of horns,\" I said, contemplating\nthe fallen giant.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Anscombe, with a twinkle of his humorous eyes,\n\"and if it hadn't been for you I think that I should have got\nthem in more senses than one.\"\n\nAs the words passed his lips some missile, from its peculiar\nsound I judged it was the leg off an iron pot, hurtled past my\nhead, fired evidently from a smoothbore gun with a large charge\nof bad powder.  Then I remembered the war-horn and all that it\nmeant.\n\n\"Off you go,\" I said, \"we are ambushed by Kaffirs.\"\n\nWe were indeed, for as we tailed down that kloof, from the top of\nboth cliffs above us came a continuous but luckily ill-directed\nfire.  Lead-coated stones, pot legs and bullets whirred and\nwhistled all round us, yet until the last, just when we were\nreaching the tree to which we had tied our horses, quite\nharmlessly.  Then suddenly I saw Anscombe begin to limp.  Still\nhe managed to run on and mount, though I observed that he did not\nput his right foot into the stirrup.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked as we galloped off.\n\n\"Shot through the instep, I think,\" he answered with a laugh,\n\"but it doesn't hurt a bit.\"\n\n\"I expect it will later,\" I replied.  \"Meanwhile, thank God it\nwasn't at the top of the kloof.  They won't catch us on the\nhorses, which they never thought of killing first.\"\n\n\"They are going to try though.  Look behind you.\"\n\nI looked and saw twenty or thirty men emerging from the mouth of\nthe kloof in pursuit.\n\n\"No time to stop to get those horns,\" he said with a sigh.\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"unless you are particularly anxious to say\ngood-bye to the world pinned over a broken ant-heap in the sun,\nor something pleasant of the sort.\"\n\nThen we rode on in silence, I thinking what a fool I had been\nfirst to allow myself to be overruled by Anscombe and cross the\nriver, and secondly not to have taken warning from that war-horn.\nWe could not go very fast because of the difficult and swampy\nnature of the ground; also the great heat of the day told on the\nhorses.  Thus it came about that when we reached the ford we were\nnot more than ten minutes ahead of our active pursuers, good\nrunners every one of them, and accustomed to the country.  I\nsuppose that they had orders to kill or capture us at any cost,\nfor instead of giving up the chase, as I hoped they would, they\nstuck to us in surprising fashion.\n\nWe splashed through the river, and luckily on the further bank\nwere met by Footsack who had seen us coming and guessed that\nsomething was wrong.\n\n\"Inspan!\" I shouted to him, \"and be quick about it if you want to\nsee tomorrow's light.  The Basutos are after us.\"\n\nOff he went like a shot, his face quite green with fear.\n\n\"Now,\" I said to Anscombe, as we let our horses take a drink for\nwhich they were mad, \"we have got to hold this ford until the\nwagon is ready, or those devils will get us after all.  Dismount\nand I'll tie up the horses.\"\n\nHe did so with some difficulty, and at my suggestion, while I\nmade the beasts fast, cut the lace of his boot which was full of\nblood, and soaked his wounded foot, that I had no time to\nexamine, in the cool water.  These things done, I helped him to\nthe rear of a thorn tree which was thick enough to shield most of\nhis body, and took my own stand behind a similar thorn at a\ndistance of a few paces.\n\nPresently the Basutos appeared, trotting along close together\nwhereon Anscombe, who was seated behind the tree, fired both\nbarrels of his Express at them at a range of about two hundred\nyards.  It was a foolish thing to do, first because he missed\nthem clean, for he had over-estimated the range and the bullets\nwent above their heads, and secondly because it caused them to\nscatter and made them careful, whereas had they come on in a lump\nwe could have taught them a lesson.  However I said nothing, as I\nknew that reproaches would only make him nervous.  Down went\nthose scoundrels on to their hands and knees and, taking cover\nbehind stones and bushes on the further bank, began to fire at\nus, for they were all armed with guns of one sort and another,\nand there was only about a hundred yards of water between us.  As\nthey effected this manoeuvre I am glad to say I was able to get\ntwo of them, while Anscombe, I think, wounded another.\n\nAfter this our position grew quite warm, for as I have said the\nthorn trunks were not very broad, and three or four of the\nnatives, who had probably been hunters, were by no means bad\nshots, though the rest of them fired wildly.  Anscombe, in poking\nhis head round the tree to shoot, had his hat knocked off by a\nbullet, while a slug went through the lappet of my coat.  Then a\nworse thing happened.  Either by chance or design Anscombe's\nhorse was struck in the neck and fell struggling, whereon my\nbeast, growing frightened, broke its riem and galloped to the\nwagon.  That is where I ought to have left them at first, only I\nthought that we might need them to make a bolt on, or to carry\nAnscombe if he could not walk.\n\nQuite a long while went by before, glancing behind me, I saw\nthat the oxen that had been grazing at a little distance had at\nlength arrived and were being inspanned in furious haste.  The\nBasutos saw it also, and fearing lest we should escape,\ndetermined to try to end the business.  Suddenly they leapt from\ntheir cover, and with more courage than I should have expected of\nthem, rushed into the river, proposing to storm us, which, to\nspeak truth, I think they would have done had I not been a fairly\nquick shot.\n\nAs it was, finding that they were losing too heavily from our\nfire, they retreated in a hurry, leaving their dead behind them,\nand even a wounded man who was clinging to a rock.  He, poor\nwretch, was in mortal terror lest we should shoot him again,\nwhich I had not the heart to do, although as his leg was\nshattered above the knee by an Express bullet, it might have been\ntrue kindness.  Again and again he called out for mercy, saying\nthat he only attacked us because his chief, who had been warned\nof our coming \"by the White Man,\" ordered him to take our guns\nand cattle.\n\n\"What white man?\" I shouted.  \"Speak or I shoot.\"\n\nThere was no answer, for at this moment he fainted from loss of\nblood and vanished beneath the water.  Then another Basuto, I\nsuppose he was their captain, but do not know for he was hidden\nin some bushes, called out--\n\n\"Do not think that you shall escape, White Men.  There are many\nmore of our people coming, and we will kill you in the night when\nyou cannot see to shoot us.\"\n\nAt this moment, too, Footsack shouted that the wagon was\ninspanned and ready.  Now I hesitated what to do.  If we made for\nthe wagon, which must be very slowly because of Anscombe's\nwounded foot, we had to cross seventy or eighty yards of rising\nground almost devoid of cover.  If, on the other hand, we stayed\nwhere we were till nightfall a shot might catch one of us, or\nother Basutos might arrive and rush us.  There was also a third\npossibility, that our terrified servants might trek off and leave\nus in order to save their own lives, which verily I believe they\nwould have done, not being of Zulu blood.  I put the problem to\nAnscombe, who shook his head and looked at his foot.  Then he\nproduced a lucky penny which he carried in his pocket and said--\n\n\"Let us invoke the Fates.  Heads we run like heroes; tails we\nstay here like heroes,\" and he spun the penny, while I stared at\nhim open-mouthed and not without admiration.\n\nNever, I thought to myself, had this primitive method of cutting\na gordian knot been resorted to in such strange and urgent\ncircumstances.\n\n\"Heads it is!\" he said coolly.  \"Now, my boy, do you run and I'll\ncrawl after you.  If I don't arrive, you know my people's\naddress, and I bequeath to you all my African belongings in\nmemory of a most pleasant trip.\"\n\n\"Don't play the fool,\" I replied sternly.  \"Come, put your right\narm round my neck and hop on your left leg as you never hopped\nbefore.\"\n\nThen we started, and really our transit was quite lively, for\nall those Basutos began what for them was rapid firing.  I think,\nhowever, that their best shots must have fallen, for not a bullet\ntouched us, although before we got out of their range one or two\nwent very near.\n\n\"There,\" said Anscombe, as a last amazing hop brought him to the\nwagon rail, \"there, you see how wise it is give Providence a\nchance sometimes.\"\n\n\"In the shape of a lucky penny,\" I grumbled as I hoisted him up.\n\n\"Certainly, for why should not Providence inhabit a penny as much\nas it does any other mundane thing?  Oh, my dear Quatermain, have\nyou never been taught to look to the pence and let the rest take\ncare of itself?\"\n\n\"Stop talking rubbish and look to your foot, for the wagon is\nstarting,\" I replied.\n\nThen off we went at a good round trot, for never have I seen oxen\nmore scientifically driven than they were by Footsack and his\nfriends on this occasion, or a greater pace got out of them.  As\nsoon as we reached a fairly level piece of ground I made Anscombe\nlie down on the cartel of the wagon and examined his wound as\nwell as circumstances would allow.  I found that the bullet or\nwhatever the missile may have been, had gone through his right\ninstep just beneath the big sinew, but so far as I could judge\nwithout injuring any bone.  There was nothing to be done except\nrub in some carbolic ointment, which fortunately he had in his\nmedicine chest, and bind up the wound as best I could with a\nclean handkerchief, after which I tied a towel, that was _not_\nclean, over the whole foot.\n\nBy this time evening was coming on, so we ate of such as we had\nwith us, which we needed badly enough, without stopping the\nwagon.  I remember that it consisted of cheese and hard biscuits.\nAt dark we were obliged to halt a little by a stream until the\nmoon rose, which fortunately she did very soon, as she was only\njust past her full.  As soon as she was up we started again, and\nwith a breathing space or two, trekked all that night, which I\nspent seated on the after part of the wagon and keeping a sharp\nlook out, while, notwithstanding the roughness of the road and\nhis hurt, Anscombe slept like a child upon the cartel inside.\n\nI was very tired, so tired that the fear of surprise was the only\nthing that kept me awake, and I recall reflecting in a stupid\nkind of way, that it seemed always to have been my lot in life to\nwatch thus, in one sense or another, while others slept.\n\nThe night passed somehow without anything happening, and at dawn\nwe halted for a while to water the oxen, which we did with\nbuckets, and let them eat what grass they could reach from their\nyokes, since we did not dare to outspan them.  Just as we were\nstarting on again the voortrekker, whom I had set to watch at a\nlittle distance, ran up with his eyes bulging out of his head,\nand reported that he had seen a Basuto with an assegai hanging\nabout in the bush, as though to keep touch with us, after which\nwe delayed no more.\n\nAll that day we blundered on, thrashing the weary cattle that at\nevery halt tried to lie down, and by nightfall came to the\noutspan near to the house called the Temple, where we had met the\nKaffirs returning from the diamond fields.  This journey we had\naccomplished in exactly half the time it had taken on the outward\ntrip.  Here we were obliged to stop, as our team must have rest\nand food.  So we outspanned and slept that night without much\nfear, since I thought it most improbable that the Basutos would\nattempt to follow us so far, as we were now within a day's trek\nof Pilgrim's Rest, whither we proposed to proceed on the morrow.\nBut that is just where I made a mistake.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\n\n\nDOCTOR RODD\n\n\n\n\n\nI did get a little sleep that night, with one eye open, but\nbefore dawn I was up again seeing to the feeding of our remaining\nhorse with some mealies that we carried, and other matters.  The\noxen we had been obliged to unyoke that they might fill\nthemselves with grass and water, since otherwise I feared that we\nshould never get them on to their feet again.  As it was, the\npoor brutes were so tired that some of them could scarcely eat,\nand all lay down at the first opportunity.\n\nHaving awakened Footsack and the other boys that they might be\nready to take advantage of the light when it came, for I was\nanxious to be away, I drank a nip of Hollands and water and ate a\nbiscuit, making Anscombe do the same.  Coffee would have been\nmore acceptable, but I thought it wiser not to light a fire for\nfear of showing our whereabouts.\n\nNow a faint glimmer in the east told me that the dawn was coming.\nJust by the wagon grew a fair-sized, green-leaved tree, and as it\nwas quite easy to climb even by starlight, up it I went so as to\nget above the ground mist and take a look round before we\ntrekked.  Presently the sky grew pearly and light began to\ngather; then the edge of the sun appeared, throwing long level\nrays across the world.  Everywhere the mist lay dense as cotton\nwool, except at one spot about a mile behind us where there was a\nlittle hill or rather a wave of the ground, over which we had\ntrekked upon the preceding evening.  The top of this rise was\nabove mist level, and on it no trees grew because the granite\ncame to the surface.  Having discovered nothing, I called to the\nboys to drive up the oxen, some of which had risen and were\neating again, and prepared to descend from my tree.\n\nAs I did so, out of the corner of my eye I caught sight of\nsomething that glittered far away, so far that it would only have\nattracted the notice of a trained hunter.  Yes, something was\nshining on the brow of the rise of which I have spoken.  I stared\nat it through my glasses and saw what I had feared to see.  A\nbody of natives was crossing the rise and the glitter was caused\nby the rays of dawn striking on their spears and gun-barrels.\n\nI came down out of that tree like a frightened wild cat and ran\nto the wagon, thinking hard as I went.  The Basutos were after\nus, meaning to attack as soon as there was sufficient light.  In\nten minutes or less they would be here.  There was no time to\ninspan the oxen, and even if there had been, stiff and weary as\nthe beasts were, we should be overtaken before we had gone a\nhundred yards on that bad road.  What then was to be done? Run\nfor it? It was impossible, Anscombe could not run.  My eye fell\nupon the horse munching the last of his mealies.\n\n\"Footsack,\" I said as quietly as I could, \"never mind about\ninspanning yet, but saddle up the horse.  Be quick now.\"\n\nHe looked at me doubtfully, but obeyed, having seen nothing.  If\nhe had seen I knew that he would have been off.  I nipped round\nto the end of the wagon, calling to the other two boys to let the\noxen be a while and come to me.\n\n\"Now, Anscombe,\" I said, \"hand out the rifles and cartridges.\nDon't stop to ask questions, but do what I tell you.  They are on\nthe rack by your side.  So.  Now put on your revolver and let me\nhelp you down.  Man, don't forget your hat.\"\n\nHe obeyed quickly enough, and presently was standing on one leg\nby my side, looking cramped and tottery.\n\n\"The Basutos are on us,\" I said.\n\nHe whistled and remarked something about Chapter No. 2.\n\n\"Footsack,\" I called, \"bring the horse here; the Baas wishes to\nride a little to ease his leg.\"\n\nHe did so, stopping a moment to pull the second girth tight.\nThen we helped Anscombe into the saddle.\n\n\"Which way?\" he asked.\n\nI looked at the long slope in front of us.  It was steep and bad\ngoing.  Anscombe might get up it on the horse before the Kaffirs\novertook us, but it was extremely problematical if we could do\nso.  I might perhaps if I mounted behind him and the horse could\nbear us both, which was doubtful, but how about our poor\nservants? He saw the doubt upon my face and said in his quiet\nway,\n\n\"You may remember that our white-bearded friend told us to make\nstraight for his place in case of any difficulty with the\nBasutos.  It seems to have arisen.\"\n\n\"I know he did,\" I answered, \"but I cannot make up my mind which\nis the more dangerous, Marnham or the Basutos.  I rather think\nthat he set them on to us.\"\n\n\"It is impossible to solve problems at this hour of the morning,\nQuatermain, and there is no time to toss.  So I vote for the\nTemple.\"\n\n\"It seems our best chance.  At any rate that's your choice, so\nlet's go.\"\n\nThen I sang out to the Kaffirs, \"The Basutos are on us.  We go to\nTampel for refuge.  Run!\"\n\nMy word! they did run.  I never saw athletes make better time\nover the first quarter of a mile.  We ran, too, or at least the\nhorse did, I hanging on to the stirrup and Anscombe holding both\nthe rifles beneath his arm.  But the beast was tired, also blown\nout with that morning feed of mealies, so our progress was not\nvery fast.  When we were about two hundred yards from the wagon I\nlooked back and saw the Basutos beginning to arrive.  They saw us\nalso, and uttering a sort of whistling war cry, started in\npursuit.\n\nAfter this we had quite an interesting time.  I scrambled on to\nthe horse behind Anscombe, whereon that intelligent animal,\nfeeling the double weight, reduced its pace proportionately, to a\nslow tripple, indeed, out of which it could not be persuaded to\nmove.  So I slipped off again over its tail and we went on as\nbefore.  Meanwhile the Basutos, very active fellows, were coming\nup.  By this time the yellow-wood grove in the swamp, of which I\nhave already written, was close to us, and it became quite a\nquestion which of us would get there first (I may mention that\nFootsack & Co.  had already attained its friendly shelter).\nAnscombe kicked the horse with his sound heel and I thumped it\nwith my fist, thereby persuading it to a hand gallop.\n\nAs we reached the outlying trees of the wood the first Basuto, a\nlank fellow with a mouth like a rat trap, arrived and threw an\nassegai at us which passed between Anscombe's back and my nose.\nThen he closed and tried to stab with another assegai.  I could\ndo nothing, but Anscombe showed himself cleverer than I expected.\nDropping the reins, he drew his pistol and managed to send a\nbullet through that child of nature's head, so that he went down\nlike a stone.\n\n\"And you tell me I am a bad shot,\" he drawled.\n\n\"It was a fluke,\" I gasped, for even in these circumstances truth\nwould prevail.\n\n\"Wait and you'll see,\" he replied, re-cocking the revolver.\n\nAs a matter of fact there was no need for more shooting, since at\nthe verge of the swamp the Basutos pulled up.  I do not think\nthat the death of their companion caused them to do this, for\nthey seemed to take no notice of him.  It was as though they had\nreached some boundary which they knew it would not be lawful for\nthem to pass.  They simply stopped, took the dead man's assegai\nand shield from the body and walked quietly back towards the\nwagon, leaving him where he lay.  The horse stopped also, or\nrather proceeded at a walk.\n\n\"There!\" exclaimed Anscombe.  \"Did I not tell you I had a\npresentiment that I should kill a man in this accursed wood?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said as soon as I had recovered my breath, \"but you\nmixed up a woman with the matter and I don't see one.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" he replied, \"I hope we shan't meet her later.\"\n\nThen we went on as quickly as we could, which was not very fast,\nfor I feared lest the Basutos should change their minds and\nfollow us.  As the risk of this became less our spirits rose,\nsince if we had lost the wagon and the oxen, at least we had\nsaved our lives, which was almost more than we could have\nexpected in the circumstances.  At last we came to that glade\nwhere we had killed the wildebeeste not a week before.  There lay\nits skeleton picked clean by the great brown kites that frequent\nthe bush-veld, some of which still sat about in the trees.\n\n\"Well, I suppose we must go on to Tampel,\" said Anscombe rather\nfaintly, for I could see that his wound was giving him a good\ndeal of pain.\n\nAs he spoke from round the tree whence he had first emerged,\nappeared Mr. Marnham, riding the same horse and wearing the same\nclothes.  The only difference between his two entries was that\nthe first took place in the late evening and the second in the\nearly morning.\n\n\"So here you are again,\" he said cheerfully.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"and it is strange to meet you at the same\nspot.  Were you expecting us?\"\n\n\"Not more than I expect many things,\" he replied with a shrewd\nglance at me, adding, \"I always rise with the sun, and thinking\nthat I heard a shot fired in the distance, came to see what was\nhappening.  The Basutos attacked you at daybreak, did they not?\"\n\n\"They did, but how did you know that, Mr. Marnham?\"\n\n\"Your servants told me.  I met them running to the house looking\nvery frightened.  You are wounded, Mr. Anscombe?\"\n\n\"Yes, a couple of days ago on the border of Sekukuni's country\nwhere the natives tried to murder us.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he replied without surprise.  \"I warned you the trip was\ndangerous, did I not?  Well, come on home where my partner, Rodd,\nwho luckily has had medical experience, will attend to you.  Mr.\nQuatermain can tell me the story as we go.\"\n\nSo we went on up the long slope, I relating our adventures, to\nwhich Mr. Marnham listened without comment.\n\n\"I expect that the Kaffirs will have looted the wagon and be on\nthe way home with your oxen by now,\" he said when I had finished.\n\n\"Are you not afraid that they will follow us here?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh no, Mr. Quatermain.  We do business with these people, also\nthey sometimes come to be doctored by Rodd when they are sick, so\nthis place is sacred ground to them.  They stopped hunting you\nwhen they got to the Yellow-wood swamp where our land begins, did\nthey not?\"\n\n\"Yes, but now I want to hunt them.  Can you give me any help?\nThose oxen are tired out and footsore, so we might be able to\ncatch them up.\"\n\nHe shook his head.  \"We have very few people here, and by the\ntime that you could get assistance from the Camp at Barberton, if\nthe Commandant is able and willing to give you any, which I\nrather doubt, they will be far away.  Moreover,\" he added,\ndropping his voice, \"let us come to an understanding.  You are\nmost welcome to any help or hospitality that I can offer, but if\nyou wish to do more fighting I must ask you to go elsewhere.  As\nI have told you, we are peaceful men who trade with these people,\nand do not wish to be involved in a quarrel with them, which\nmight expose us to attack or bring us into trouble with the\nBritish Government which has annexed but not conquered their\ncountry.  Do I make myself clear?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.  While we are with you we will do nothing, but\nafterwards we hold ourselves at liberty to act as we think best.\"\n\n\"Quite so.  Meanwhile I hope that you and Mr. Anscombe will make\nyourselves comfortable with us for as long as you like.\"\n\nIn my own mind I came to the conclusion that this would be for\nthe shortest time possible, but I only said--\n\n\"It is most kind of you to take in complete strangers thus.  No,\nnot complete,\" I added, looking towards Anscombe who was\nfollowing on the tired horse a few paces behind, \"for you knew\nhis father, did you not?\"\n\n\"His father?\" he said, lifting his eyebrows.  \"No.  Oh! I\nremember, I said something to that effect the other night, but it\nwas a mistake.  I mixed up two names, as one often does after a\nlapse of many years.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I answered, but remembering Anscombe's story I\nreflected to myself that our venerable host was an excellent\nliar.  Or more probably he meant to convey that he wished the\nsubject of his youthful reminiscences to be taboo.\n\nJust then we reached the house which had a pretty patch of\nwell-kept flower-garden in front of it, surrounded by a fence\ncovered with wire netting to keep out buck.  By the gate squatted\nour three retainers, looking very blown and rather ashamed of\nthemselves.\n\n\"Your master wishes to thank you for your help in a dark hour,\nFootsack, and I wish to congratulate you all upon the swiftness\nof your feet,\" I said in Dutch.\n\n\"Oh! Baas, the Basutos were many and their spears are sharp,\" he\nbegan apologetically.\n\n\"Be silent, you running dog,\" I said, \"and go help your master to\ndismount.\"\n\nThen we went through the gate, Anscombe leaning on my shoulder\nand on that of Mr. Marnham, and up the path which was bordered\nwith fences of the monthly rose, towards the house.  Really this\nwas almost as charming to look at near at hand as it had been\nfrom far away.  Of course the whole thing was crude in detail.\nRough, half-shaped blocks of marble from the neighbouring quarry\nhad been built into walls and columns.  Nothing was finished, and\nconsidered bit by bit all was coarse and ugly.  Yet the general\neffect was beautiful because it was an effect of design, the\npicture of an artist who did not fully understand the\ntechnicalities of painting, the work of a great writer who had as\nyet no proper skill in words.  Never did I see a small building\nthat struck me more.  But then what experience have I of\nbuildings, and, as Anscombe reminded me afterwards, it was but a\ncopy of something designed when the world was young, or rather\nwhen civilization was young, and man new risen from the infinite\nages of savagery, saw beauty in his dreams and tried to symbolize\nit in shapes of stone.\n\nWe came to the broad stoep, to which several rough blocks of\nmarble served as steps.  On it in a long chair made of native\nwood and seated with hide rimpis, sat or rather lolled a man in a\ndressing-gown who was reading a book.  He raised himself as we\ncame and the light of the sun, for the verandah faced to the\neast, shone full upon his face, so that I saw him well.  It was\nthat of a man of something under forty years of age, dark,\npowerful, and weary--not a good face, I thought.  Indeed, it gave\nme the impression of one who had allowed the evil which exists in\nthe nature of all of us to become his master, or had even\nencouraged it to do so.\n\nIn the Psalms and elsewhere we are always reading of the\nrighteous and the unrighteous until those terms grow wearisome.\nIt is only of late years that I have discovered, or think that I\nhave discovered, what they mean.  Our lives cannot be judged by\nour deeds; they must be judged by our desires or rather by our\nmoral attitude.  It is not what we do so much as what we try to\ndo that counts in the formation of character.  All fall short,\nall fail, but in the end those who seek to climb out of the pit,\nthose who strive, however vainly, to fashion failure to success,\nare, by comparison, the righteous, while those who are content to\nwallow in our native mire and to glut themselves with the daily\nbread of vice, are the unrighteous.  To turn our backs thereon\nwilfully and without cause, is the real unforgiveable sin against\nthe Spirit.  At least that is the best definition of the problem\nat which I in my simplicity can arrive.\n\nSuch thoughts have often occurred to me in considering the\ncharacter of Dr. Rodd and some others whom I have known; indeed\nthe germ of them arose in my mind which, being wearied at the\ntime and therefore somewhat vacant, was perhaps the more open to\nexternal impressions, as I looked upon the face of this stranger\non the stoep.  Moreover, as I am proud to record, I did not judge\nhim altogether wrongly.  He was a blackguard who, under other\ninfluences or with a few added grains of self-restraint and of\nthe power of recovery, might have become a good or even a saintly\nman.  But by some malice of Fate or some evil inheritance from an\nunknown past, those grains were lacking, and therefore he went\nnot up but down the hill.\n\n\"Case for you, Rodd,\" called out Marnham.\n\n\"Indeed,\" he answered, getting to his feet and speaking in a full\nvoice, which, like his partner's, was that of an educated\nEnglishman.  \"What's the matter.  Horse accident?\"\n\nThen we were introduced, and Anscombe began to explain his\ninjury.\n\n\"Um!\" said the doctor, studying him with dark eyes.  \"Kaffir\nbullet through the foot some days ago.  Ought to be attended to\nat once.  Also you look pretty done, so don't tire yourself with\nthe story, which I can get from Mr. Quatermain.  Come and lie\ndown and I'll have a look at you while they are cooking\nbreakfast.\"\n\nThen he guided us to a room of which the double French windows\nopened on to the stoep, a very pretty room with two beds in it.\nMaking Anscombe lie down on one of these he turned up his\ntrouser, undid my rough bandage and examined the wound.\n\n\"Painful?\" he asked.\n\n\"Very,\" answered Anscombe, \"right up to the thigh.\"\n\nAfter this he drew off the nether garments and made a further\nexamination.\n\n\"Um,\" he said again, \"I must syringe this out.  Stay still while\nI get some stuff.\"\n\nI followed him from the room, and when we were out of hearing on\nthe stoep inquired what he thought.  I did not like the look of\nthat leg.\n\n\"It is very bad,\" he answered, \"so bad that I am wondering if it\nwouldn't be best to remove the limb below the knee and make it a\njob.  You can see for yourself that it is septic and the\ninflammation is spreading up rapidly.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" I exclaimed, \"do you fear mortification?\"\n\nHe nodded.  \"Can't say what was on that slug or bit of old iron\nand he hasn't had the best chance since.  Mortification, or\ntetanus, or both, are more than possible.  Is he a temperate\nman?\"\n\n\"So far as I know,\" I answered, and stared at him while he\nthought.  Then he said with decision,\n\n\"That makes a difference.  To lose a foot is a serious thing;\nsome might think almost as bad as death.  I'll give him a chance,\nbut if those symptoms do not abate in twenty-four hours, I must\noperate.  You needn't be afraid, I was house surgeon at a London\nHospital--once, and I keep my hand in.  Lucky you came straight\nhere.\"\n\nHaving made his preparations and washed his hands, he returned,\nsyringed the wound with some antiseptic stuff, and dressed and\nbandaged the leg up to the knee.  After this he gave Anscombe hot\nmilk to drink, with two eggs broken into it, and told him to rest\na while as he must not eat anything solid at present.  Then he\nthrew a blanket over him, and, signing to me to come away, let\ndown a mat over the window.\n\n\"I put a little something into that milk,\" he said outside,\n\"which will send him to sleep for a few hours.  So we will leave\nhim quiet.  Now you'll want a wash.\"\n\n\"Where are you going to take Mr. Quatermain?\" asked Marnham who\nwas seated on the stoep.\n\n\"Into my room,\" he answered.\n\n\"Why? There's Heda's ready.\"\n\n\"Heda might return at any moment,\" replied the doctor.  \"Also Mr.\nQuatermain had better sleep in Mr. Anscombe's room.  He will very\nlikely want some one to look after him at night.\"\n\nMarnham opened his mouth to speak again, then changed his mind\nand was silent, as a servant is silent under rebuke.  The\nincident was quite trifling, yet it revealed to me the relative\nattitude of these two men.  Without a doubt Rodd was the master\nof his partner, who did not even care to dispute with him about\nthe matter of the use of his daughter's bedroom.  They were a\nqueer couple who, had it not been for my anxiety as to Anscombe's\nillness, would have interested me very much, as indeed they were\ndestined to do.\n\nWell, I went to tidy up in the doctor's room, and as he left me\nalone while I washed, had the opportunity of studying it a\nlittle.  Like the rest of the house it was lined with native wood\nwhich was made to serve as the backs of bookshelves and of\ncupboards filled with medicines and instruments.  The books\nformed a queer collection.  There were medical works,\nphilosophical works, histories, novels, most of them French, and\nother volumes of a sort that I imagine are generally kept under\nlock and key; also some that had to do with occult matters.\nThere was even a Bible.  I opened it thoughtlessly, half in idle\ncuriosity, to see whether it was ever used, only to replace it in\nhaste.  For at the very page that my eye fell on, I remember it\nwas one of my favourite chapters in Isaiah, was a stamp in violet\nink marked H. M.'s Prison--well, I won't say where.\n\nI may state, however, that the clue enabled me in after years to\nlearn an episode in this man's life which had brought about his\nruin.  There is no need to repeat it or to say more than that\ngambling and an evil use of his medical knowledge to provide the\nmoney to pay his debts, were the cause of his fall.  The strange\nthing is that he should have kept the book which had probably\nbeen given to him by the prison chaplain.  Still everybody makes\nmistakes sometimes.  Or it may have had associations for him, and\nof course he had never seen this stamp upon an unread page, which\nhappened to leap to my eye.\n\nNow I was able to make a shrewd guess at his later career.  After\nhis trouble he had emigrated and began to practise in South\nAfrica.  Somehow his identity had been discovered; his past was\ndragged up against him, possibly by rivals jealous of his skill;\nhis business went and he found it advisable to retire to the\nTransvaal before the Annexation, at that time the home of sundry\npeople of broken repute.  Even there he did not stop in a town,\nbut hid himself upon the edge of savagery.  Here he foregathered\nwith another man of queer character, Marnham, and in his company\nentered upon some doubtful but lucrative form of trade while\nstill indulging his love of medicine by doctoring and operating\nupon natives, over whom he would in this way acquire great\ninfluence.  Indeed, as I discovered before the day was over, he\nhad quite a little hospital at the back of the house in which\nwere four or five beds occupied by Kaffirs and served by two male\nnative nurses whom he had trained.  Also numbers of out-patients\nvisited him, some of whom travelled from great distances, and\noccasionally, but not often, he attended white people who chanced\nto be in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe three of us breakfasted in a really charming room from the\nwindow of which could be studied a view as beautiful as any I\nknow.  The Kaffirs who waited were well trained and dressed in\nneat linen uniforms.  The cooking was good; there was real silver\non the table, then a strange sight in that part of Africa, and\namongst engravings and other pictures upon the walls, hung an oil\nportrait of a very beautiful young woman with dark hair and eyes.\n\n\"Is that your daughter, Mr. Marnham?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" he replied rather shortly, \"it is her mother.\"\n\nImmediately afterwards he was called from the room to speak to\nsome one, whereon the doctor said--\n\n\"A foreigner as you see, a Hungarian; the Hungarian women are\nvery good looking and very charming.\"\n\n\"So I have understood,\" I answered, \"but does this lady live\nhere?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.  She is dead, or I believe that she is dead.  I am not\nsure, because I make it a rule never to pry into people's private\naffairs.  All I know about her is that she was a beauty whom\nMarnham married late in life upon the Continent when she was but\neighteen.  As is common in such cases he was very jealous of her,\nbut it didn't last long, as she died, or I understand that she\ndied, within a year of her daughter's birth.  The loss affected\nhim so much that he emigrated to South Africa with the child and\nbegan life anew.  I do not think that they correspond with\nHungary, and he never speaks of her even to his daughter, which\nsuggests that she is dead.\"\n\nI reflected that all these circumstances might equally well\nsuggest several other things, but said nothing, thinking it\nwisest not to pursue the subject.  Presently Marnham returned and\ninformed me that a native had just brought him word that the\nBasutos had made off homeward with our cattle, but had left the\nwagon and its contents quite untouched, not even stealing the\nspare guns and ammunition.\n\n\"That's luck,\" I said, astonished, \"but extremely strange.  How\ndo you explain it, Mr. Marnham?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and answered--\n\n\"As every one knows, you are a much greater expert in native\nhabits and customs than I am, Mr. Quatermain.\"\n\n\"There are only two things that I can think of,\" I said.  \"One is\nthat for some reason or other they thought the wagon tagati,\nbewitched you know, and that it would bring evil on them to touch\nit, though this did not apply to the oxen.  The other is that\nthey supposed it, but not the oxen, to belong to some friend of\ntheir own whose property they did not wish to injure.\"\n\nHe looked at me sharply but said nothing, and I went on to tell\nthem the details of the attack that had been made upon us,\nadding--\n\n\"The odd part of the affair is that one of those Basutos called\nout to us that some infernal scoundrel of a white had warned\nSekukuni of our coming and that he had ordered them to take our\nguns and cattle.  This Basuto, who was wounded and praying for\nmercy, was drowned before he could tell me who the white man\nwas.\"\n\n\"A Boer, I expect,\" said Marnham quietly.  \"As you know they are\nnot particularly well affected towards us English just now.  Also\nI happen to be aware that some of them are intriguing with\nSekukuni against the British through Makurupiji, his 'Mouth' or\nprime-minister, a very clever old scamp who likes to have two\nstools to sit on.\"\n\n\"And doubtless will end by falling between them.  Well, you see,\nnow that I think of it, the wounded Kaffir only said that they\nwere ordered to take our guns and oxen, and incidentally our\nlives.  The wagon was not mentioned.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Mr. Quatermain.  I will send some of our boys to help\nyour servants to bring everything it contains up here.\"\n\n\"Can't you lend me a team of oxen,\" I asked, \"to drag it to the\nhouse?\"\n\n\"No, we have nothing but young cattle left.  Both red-water and\nlung-sickness have been so bad this season that all the horned\nstock have been swept out of the country.  I doubt whether you\ncould beg, borrow or steal a team of oxen this side of Pretoria,\nexcept from some of the Dutchmen who won't part.\"\n\n\"That's awkward.  I hoped to be able to trek in a day or two.\"\n\n\"Your friend won't be able to trek for a good many days at the\nbest,\" broke in the doctor, who had been listening unconcernedly,\n\"but of course you could get away on the horse after it has\nrested.\"\n\n\"You told me you left a span of oxen at Pretoria,\" said Marnham.\n\"Why not go and fetch them here, or if you don't like to leave\nMr. Anscombe, send your driver and the boys.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the idea.  I will think it over,\" I answered.\n\nThat morning after Footsack and the voorlooper had been sent with\nsome of the servants from the Temple to fetch up the contents of\nthe wagon, for I was too tired to accompany them, having found\nthat Anscombe was still asleep, I determined to follow his\nexample.  Finding a long chair on the stoep, I sat down and\nslumbered in it sweetly for hours.  I dreamt of all sorts of\nthings, then through my dreams it seemed to me that I heard two\nvoices talking, those of our Marnham and Rodd, not on the stoep,\nbut at a distance from it.  As a matter of fact they were\ntalking, but so far away that in my ordinary waking state I could\nnever have heard them.  My own belief is that the senses, and I\nmay add the semi-spiritual part of us, are much more acute when\nwe lie half bound in the bonds of sleep, than when we are what is\ncalled wide awake.  Doubtless when we are quite bound they attain\nthe limits of their power and, I think, sail at times to the\nuttermost ends of being.  But unhappily of their experiences we\nremember nothing when we awake.  In half sleep it is different;\nthen we do retain some recollection.\n\nIn this curious condition of mind it seemed to me that Rodd said\nto Marnham--\n\n\"Why have you brought these men here?\"\n\n\"I did not bring them here,\" he answered.  \"Luck, Fate, Fortune,\nGod or the Devil, call it what you will, brought them here,\nthough if you had your wish, it is true they would never have\ncome.  Still, as they have come, I am glad.  It is something to\nme, living in this hell, to get a chance of talking to English\ngentlemen again before I die.\"\n\n\"English gentlemen,\" remarked Rodd reflectively, \"Well, Anscombe\nis of course, but how about that other hunter?  After all, in\nwhat way is he better than the scores of other hunters and Kaffir\ntraders and wanderers whom one meets in this strange land?\"\n\n\"In what way indeed?\" thought I to myself, in my dream.\n\n\"If you can't see, I can't explain to you.  But as I happen to\nknow, the man is of blood as good as mine--and a great deal\nbetter than yours,\" he added with a touch of insolence.\n\"Moreover, he has an honest name among white and black, which is\nmuch in this country.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the doctor in the same reflective voice, \"I agree\nwith you, I let him pass as a gentleman.  But I repeat, Why did\nyou bring them here when with one more word it would have been so\neasy--\" and he stopped.\n\n\"I have told you, it was not I.  What are you driving at?\"\n\n\"Do you think it is exactly convenient, especially when we are\nunder the British flag again, to have two people who, we both\nadmit, are English gentlemen, that is, clean, clear-eyed men,\nconsidering us and our affairs for an indefinite period, just\nbecause you wish for the pleasure of their society?  Would it not\nhave been better to tell those Basutos to let them trek on to\nPretoria?\"\n\n\"I don't know what would have been better.  I repeat, what are\nyou driving at?\n\n\"Heda is coming home in a day or two; she might be here any\ntime,\" remarked Rodd as he knocked the ashes out of his pipe.\n\n\"Yes, because you made me write and say that I wanted her.  But\nwhat of that?\"\n\n\"Nothing in particular, except that I am not sure that I wish her\nto associate with 'an English gentleman' like this Anscombe.\"\n\nMarnham laughed scornfully.  \"Ah! I understand,\" he said.  \"Too\nclean and straight.  Complications might ensue and the rest of\nit.  Well, I wish to God they would, for I know the Anscombes, or\nused to, and I know the genus called Rodd.\"\n\n\"Don't be insulting; you may carry the thing too far one day, and\nwhatever I have done I have paid for.  But you've not paid--yet.\"\n\n\"The man is very ill.  You are a skilled doctor.  If you're\nafraid of him, why don't you kill him?\" asked Marnham with bitter\nscorn.\n\n\"There you have me,\" replied Rodd.  \"Men may shed much, but most\nof them never shed their professional honour.  I shall do my\nhonest best to cure Mr. Anscombe, and I tell you that he will\ntake some curing.\"\n\n\nThen I woke up, and as no one was in sight, wondered whether or\nno I had been dreaming.  The upshot of it was that I made up my\nmind to send Footsack to Pretoria for the oxen, not to go myself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\n\n\nA GAME OF CARDS\n\n\n\n\n\nI slept in Anscombe's room that night and looked after him.  He\nwas very feverish and the pain in his leg kept him awake a good\ndeal.  He told me that he could not bear Dr. Rodd and wished to\nget away at once.  I had to explain to him that this was\nimpossible until his spare oxen arrived which I was going to send\nfor to Pretoria, but of other matters, including that of the\ndangerous state of his foot, I said nothing.  I was thankful when\ntowards two in the morning, he fell into a sound sleep and\nallowed me to do the same.\n\nBefore breakfast time, just as I had finished dressing myself in\nsome of the clean things which had been brought from the wagon,\nRodd came and made a thorough and business-like examination of\nhis patient, while I awaited the result with anxiety on the\nstoep.  At length he appeared and said--\n\n\"Well, I think that we shall be able to save the foot, though I\ncan't be quite sure for another twenty-four hours.  The worst\nsymptoms have abated and his temperature is down by two degrees.\nAnyway he will have to stay in bed and live on light food till it\nis normal, after which he might lie in a long chair on the stoep.\nOn no account must he attempt to stand.\"\n\nI thanked him for his information heartily enough and asked him\nif he knew where Marnham was, as I wanted to speak to him with\nreference to the despatch of Footsack to fetch the oxen from\nPretoria.\n\n\"Not up yet, I think,\" he answered.  \"I fancy that yesterday was\none of his 'wet' nights, excitement of meeting strangers and so\non.\"\n\n\"Wet nights?\" I queried, wishing for a clearer explanation.\n\n\"Yes, he is a grand old fellow, one of the best, but like most\nother people he has his little weaknesses, and when the fit is on\nhim he can put away a surprising amount of liquor.  I tell you so\nthat you should not be astonished if you notice anything, or try\nto argue with him when he is in that state, as then his temper is\napt to be--well, lively.  Now I must go and give him a pint of\nwarm milk; that is his favourite antidote, and in fact the best\nthere is.\"\n\nI thought to myself that we had struck a nice establishment in\nwhich to be tied, literally by the leg, for an indefinite period.\nI was not particularly flush at the time, but I know I would have\npaid a #100 to be out of it; before the end I should have been\nglad to throw in everything that I had.  But mercifully that was\nhidden from me.\n\nRodd and I breakfasted together and discoursed of Kaffir customs,\nas to which he was singularly well informed.  Then I accompanied\nhim to see his native patients in the little hospital of which I\nhave spoken.  Believing the man to be a thorough scamp as I did,\nit was astonishing to me to note how gentle and forbearing he was\nto these people.  Of his skill I need say nothing, as that was\nevident.  He was going to perform an internal operation upon a\nburly old savage, rather a serious one I believe; at any rate it\nnecessitated chloroform.  He asked me if I would like to assist,\nbut I declined respectfully, having no taste for such things.  So\nI left him boiling his instruments and putting on what looked\nlike a clean nightgown over his clothes, and returned to the\nstoep.\n\nHere I found Marnham, whose eyes were rather bloodshot, though\notherwise, except for a shaky hand, he seemed right enough.  He\nmurmured something about having overslept himself and inquired\nvery politely, for his manners were beautiful, after Anscombe and\nas to whether we were quite comfortable and so forth.  After this\nI consulted him as to the best road for our servants to travel by\nto Pretoria, and later on despatched them, giving Footsack\nvarious notes to ensure the delivery of the oxen to him.  Also I\ngave him some money to pay for their keep and told him with many\nthreats to get back with the beasts as quick as he could travel.\nThen I sent him and the two other boys off, not without\nmisgivings, although he was an experienced man in his way and\npromised faithfully to fulfil every injunction to the letter.  To\nme he seemed so curiously glad to go that I inquired the reason,\nsince after a journey like ours, it would have been more natural\nif he had wished to rest.\n\n\"Oh! Baas,\" he said, \"I don't think this Tampel very healthy for\ncoloured people.  I am told of some who have died here.  That man\nKarl who gave me the diamond, I think he must have died also, at\nleast I saw his spook last night standing over me and shaking his\nhead, and the boys saw it too.\"\n\n\"Oh! be off with your talk of spooks,\" I said, \"and come back\nquickly with those oxen, or I promise you that you will die and\nbe a spook yourself.\"\n\n\"I will, Baas, I will!\" he ejaculated and departed almost at a\nrun, leaving me rather uncomfortable.\n\nI believed nothing of the tale of the spook of Karl, but I saw\nthat Footsack believed in it, and was afraid lest he might be\nthereby prevented from returning.  I would much rather have gone\nmyself, but it was impossible for me to leave Anscombe so ill in\nthe hands of our strange hosts.  And there was no one else whom I\ncould send.  I might perhaps have ridden to Pilgrim's Rest and\ntried to find a white messenger there; indeed afterwards I\nregretted not having done so, although it would have involved at\nleast a day's absence at a very critical time.  But the truth is\nI never thought of it until too late, and probably if I had, I\nshould not have been able to discover anyone whom I could trust.\n\nAs I walked back to the house, having parted from Footsack on\nthe top of a neighbouring ridge whence I could point out his path\nto him, I met Marnham riding away.  He pulled up and said that he\nwas going down to the Granite stream to arrange about setting\nsome one up to watch the wagon.  I expressed sorrow that he\nshould have the trouble, which should have been mine if I could\nhave got away, whereon he answered that he was glad of the\nopportunity for a ride, as it was something to do.\n\n\"How do you fill in your time here,\" I asked carelessly, \"as you\ndon't farm?\"\n\n\"Oh! by trading,\" he replied, and with a nod set his horse to a\ncanter.\n\nA queer sort of trading, thought I to myself, where there is no\nstore.  Now what exactly does he trade in, I wonder?\n\nAs it happened I was destined to find out before I was an hour\nolder.  Having given Anscombe a look and found that he was\ncomfortable, I thought that I would inspect the quarry whence the\nmarble came of which the house was built, as it had occurred to\nme that if there was plenty of it, it might be worth exploiting\nsome time in the future.  It had been pointed out to me in the\nmidst of some thorns in a gully that ran at right angles to the\nmain kloof not more than a few hundred yards from the house.\nFollowing a path over which the stones had been dragged\noriginally, I came to the spot and discovered that a little\ncavity had been quarried in what seemed to me to be a positive\nmountain of pure white marble.  I examined the place as\nthoroughly as I could, climbing among some bushes that grew in\nsurface earth which had been washed down from the top, in order\nto do so.\n\nAt the back of these bushes there was a hole large enough for a\nman to creep through.  I crept through with the object of\nascertaining whether the marble veins continued.  To my surprise\nI found a stout yellow-wood door within feet of the mouth of the\nhole.  Reflecting that no doubt it was here that the quarrymen\nkept, or had kept tools and explosives, I gave it a push.  I\nsuppose it had been left unfastened accidentally, or that\nsomething had gone wrong with the lock; at any rate it swung\nopen.  Pursuing my researches as to the depth of the marble I\nadvanced boldly and, the place being dark, struck a match.\nEvidently the marble did continue, as I could see by the\nglittering roof of a cavern, for such it was.  But the floor\nattracted my attention as well as the roof, for on it were\nnumerous cases not unlike coffins, bearing the stamp of a\nwell-known Birmingham firm, labelled \"fencing iron\" and\naddressed to Messrs. Marnham & Rodd, Transvaal, _via_ Delagoa\nBay.\n\nI knew at once what they were, having seen the like before, but\nif any doubt remained in my mind it was easy to solve, for as it\nchanced one of the cases was open and half emptied.  I slipped my\nhand into it.  As I thought it contained the ordinary Kaffir gun\nof commerce, cost delivered in Africa, say 35s.; cost delivered\nto native chief in cash or cattle, say #10, which, when the\nmarket is eager, allows for a decent profit.  Contemplating those\ncases, survivors probably of a much larger stock, I understood\nhow it came about that Sekukuni had dared to show fight against\nthe Government.  Doubtless it was hence that the guns had come\nwhich sent a bullet through Anscombe's foot and nearly polished\noff both of us.\n\nMoreover, as further matches showed me, that cave contained other\nstores--item, kegs of gunpowder; item, casks of cheap spirit;\nitem, bars of lead, also a box marked \"bullet moulds\" and another\nmarked \"Percussion caps.\" I think, too, there were some innocent\nbags full of beads and a few packages of Birmingham-made assegai\nblades.  There may have been other things, but if so I did not\nwait to investigate them.  Gathering up the ends of my matches\nand, in case there should be any dust in the place that would\nshow footmarks, flapping the stone floor behind me with my pocket\nhandkerchief, I retired and continued my investigations of that\nwonderful marble deposit from the bottom of the quarry, to which,\nhaving re-arranged the bushes, I descended by another route,\nleaping like a buck from stone to stone.\n\nIt was just as well that I did so, for a few minutes later Dr.\nRodd appeared.\n\n\"Made a good job of your operation?\" I asked cheerfully.\n\n\"Pretty fair, thanks,\" he answered, \"although that Kaffir tried\nto brain the nurse-man when he was coming out of the anesthetic.\nBut are you interested in geology?\"\n\n\"A little,\" I replied, \"that is if there is any chance of making\nmoney out of it, which there ought to be here, as this marble\nlooks almost as good as that of Carrara.  But flint instruments\nare more my line, that is in an ignorant and amateur way, as I\nthink they are in yours, for I saw some in your room.  Tell me,\nwhat do you think of this.  Is it a scraper?\" and I produced a\nstone out of my pocket which I had found a week before in the\nbush-veld.\n\nAt once he forgot his suspicions, of which I could see he arrived\nvery full indeed.  This curious man, as it happened, was really\nfond of flint instruments, of which he knew a great deal.\n\n\"Did you find this here?\" he asked.\n\nI led him several yards further from the mouth of the cave and\npointed out the exact spot where I said I had picked it up\namongst some quarry debris.  Then followed a most learned\ndiscussion, for it appeared that this was a flint instrument of\nthe rarest and most valuable type, one that Noah might have used,\nor Job might have scraped himself with, and the question was how\nthe dickens had it come among that quarry debris.  In the end we\nleft the problem undecided, and having presented the article to\nDr. Rodd, a gift for which he thanked me with real warmth, I\nreturned to the house filled with the glow that rewards one who\nhas made a valuable discovery.\n\nOf the following three days I have nothing particular to say,\nexcept that during them I was perhaps more acutely bored than\never I had been in my life before.  The house was beautiful in\nits own fashion; the food was excellent; there was everything I\ncould want to drink, and Rodd announced that he no longer feared\nthe necessity of operation upon Anscombe's leg.  His recovery was\nnow a mere matter of time, and meanwhile he must not use his foot\nor let the blood run into it more than could be helped, which\nmeant that he must keep himself in a recumbent position.  The\ntrouble was that I had nothing on earth do except study the\ncharacters of our hosts, which I found disagreeable and\ndepressing.  I might have gone out shooting, but nothing of the\nsort was allowed upon the property in obedience to the wish of\nMiss Heda, a mysterious young person who was always expected and\nnever appeared, and beyond it I was afraid to travel for fear of\nBasutos.  I might have gone to Pilgrim's Rest or Lydenburg to\nmake report of the nefarious deeds of the said Basutos, but at\nbest it would have taken one or two days, and possibly I should\nhave been detained by officials who never consider any one's time\nexcept their own.\n\nThis meant that I should have been obliged to leave Anscombe\nalone, which I did not wish to do, so I just sat still and, as I\nhave said, was intensely bored, hanging about the place and\nsmoking more than was good for me.\n\nIn due course Anscombe emerged on to the stoep, where he lay with\nhis leg up, and was also bored, especially after he had tried to\npump old Marnham about his past in the Guards and completely\nfailed.  It was in this mood of utter dejection that we agreed to\nplay a game of cards one evening.  Not that either of us cared\nfor cards; indeed, personally, I have always detested them\nbecause, with various-coloured counters to represent money which\nnever passed, they had formed one of the afflictions of my youth.\n\nIt was so annoying if you won, to be handed a number of green\ncounters and be informed that they represented so many hundreds\nor thousands of pounds, or vice-versa if you lost, for as it cost\nno one anything, my dear father insisted upon playing for\nenormous stakes.  Never in any aspect of life have I cared for\nfooling.  Anscombe also disliked cards, I think because his\nancestors too had played with counters, such as some that I have\nseen belonging to the Cocoa-Tree Club and other gambling places\nof a past generation, marked as high as a thousand guineas, which\ncounters must next morning be redeemed in hard cash, whereby his\nfamily had been not a little impoverished.\n\n\"I fancy you will find they are high-fliers,\" he said when the\npair had left to fetch a suitable table, for the night being very\nhot we were going to play on the stoep by the light of the\nhanging paraffin lamp and some candles.  I replied to the effect\nthat I could not afford to lose large sums of money, especially\nto men who for aught I knew might then be engaged in marking the\ncards.\n\n\"I understand,\" he answered.  \"Don't you bother about that, old\nfellow.  This is my affair, arranged for my special amusement.  I\nshan't grumble if the fun costs something, for I am sure there\nwill be fun.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said, \"only if we should happen to win money, it's\nyours, not mine.\"\n\nTo myself I reflected, however, that with these two opponents we\nhad about as much chance of winning as a snowflake has of\nresisting the atmosphere of the lower regions.\n\nPresently they returned with the table, which had a green cloth\nover it that hung down half-way to the ground.  Also one of the\nnative boys brought a tray with spirits, from which I judged by\nvarious signs, old Marnham, who had already drunk his share at\ndinner, had helped himself freely on the way.  Soon we were\narranged, Anscombe, who was to be my partner, opposite to me in\nhis long chair, and the game began.\n\nI forget what particular variant of cards it was we played,\nthough I know it admitted of high and progressive stakes.  At\nfirst, however, these were quite moderate and we won, as I\nsuppose we were meant to do.  After half an hour or so Marnham\nrose to help himself to brandy and water, a great deal of brandy\nand very little water, while I took a nip of Hollands, and\nAnscombe and Rodd filled their pipes.\n\n\"I think this is getting rather slow,\" said Rodd to Anscombe.  \"I\nvote we put a bit more on.\"\n\n\"As much as you like,\" answered Anscombe with a little drawl and\ntwinkle of the eye, which always showed that he was amused.\n\"Both Quatermain and I are born gamblers.  Don't look angry,\nQuatermain, you know you are.  Only if we lose you will have to\ntake a cheque, for I have precious little cash.\"\n\n\"I think that will be good enough,\" replied the doctor\nquietly--\"if you lose.\"\n\nSo the stakes were increased to an amount that made my hair stand\nup stiffer even than usual, and the game went on.  Behold! a\nmarvel came to pass.  How it happened I do not know, unless\nMarnham had brought the wrong cards by mistake or had grown too\nfuddled to understand his partner's telegraphic signals, which I,\nbeing accustomed to observe, saw him make, not once but often,\nstill we won!  What is more, with a few set-backs, we went on\nwinning, till presently the sums written down to our credit, for\nno actual cash passed, were considerable.  And all the while, at\nthe end of each bout Marnham helped himself to more brandy, while\nthe doctor grew more mad in a suppressed-thunder kind of a way.\nFor my part I became alarmed, especially as I perceived that\nAnscombe was on the verge of breaking into open merriment, and\nhis legs being up I could not kick him under the table.\n\n\"My partner ought to go to bed.  Don't you think we should stop?\"\nI said.\n\n\"On the whole I do,\" replied Rodd, glowering at Marnham, who,\nsomewhat unsteadily, was engaged in wiping drops of brandy from\nhis long beard.\n\n\"D----d if I do,\" exclaimed that worthy.  \"When I was young and\nplayed with gentlemen they always gave losers an opportunity of\nrevenge.\"\n\n\"Then,\" replied Anscombe with a flash of his eyes, \"let us try to\nfollow in the footsteps of the gentlemen with whom you played in\nyour youth.  I suggest that we double the stakes.\"\n\n\"That's right!  That's the old form!\" said Marnham.\n\nThe doctor half rose from his chair, then sat down again.\nWatching him, I concluded that he believed his partner, a\nseasoned vessel, was not so drunk as he pretended to be, and\neither in an actual or a figurative sense, had a card up his\nsleeve.  If so, it remained there, for again we won; all the luck\nwas with us.\n\n\"I am getting tired,\" drawled Anscombe.  \"Lemon and water are not\nsustaining.  Shall we stop?\"\n\n\"By Heaven! no,\" shouted Marnham, to which Anscombe replied that\nif it was wished, he would play another hand, but no more.\n\n\"All right,\" said Marnham, \"but let it be for double or quits.\"\n\nHe spoke quite quietly and seemed suddenly to have grown sober.\nNow I think that Rodd made up his mind that he really was acting\nand that he really had that card up his sleeve.  At any rate he\ndid not object.  I, however, was of a different opinion, having\noften seen drunken men succumb to an access of sobriety under the\nstress of excitement and remarked that it did not last long.\n\n\"Do you really mean that?\" I said, speaking for the first time\nand addressing myself to the doctor.  \"I don't quite know what\nthe sum involved is, but it must be large.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he answered.\n\nThen remembering that at the worst Anscombe stood to lose\nnothing, I shrugged my shoulders and held my tongue.  It was\nMarnham's deal, and although he was somewhat in the shadow of the\nhanging lamp and the candles had guttered out, I distinctly saw\nhim play some hocus-pocus with the cards, but in the\ncircumstances made no protest.  As it chanced he must have\nhocus-pocused them wrong, for though _his_ hand was full of\ntrumps, Rodd held nothing at all.  The battle that ensued was\nquite exciting, but the end of it was that an ace in the hand of\nAnscombe, who really was quite a good player, did the business,\nand we won again.\n\nIn the rather awful silence that followed Anscombe remarked in\nhis cheerful drawl--\n\n\"I'm not sure that my addition is quite right; we'll check that\nin the morning, but I make out that you two gentlemen owe\nQuatermain and myself #749 10s.\"\n\nThen the doctor broke out.\n\n\"You accursed old fool,\" he hissed--there is no other word for\nit--at Marnham.  \"How are you going to pay all this money that\nyou have gambled away, drunken beast that you are!\"\n\n\"Easily enough, you felon,\" shouted Marnham.  \"So,\" and thrusting\nhis hand into his pocket he pulled out a number of diamonds which\nhe threw upon the table, adding, \"there's what will cover it\ntwice over, and there are more where they came from, as you know\nwell enough, my medical jailbird.\"\n\n\"You dare to call me that,\" gasped the doctor in a voice laden\nwith fury, so intense that it had deprived him of his reason,\n\"you--you--murderer!  Oh! why don't I kill you as I shall some\nday?\" and lifting his glass, which was half full, he threw the\ncontents into Marnham's face.\n\n\"That's a nice man for a prospective, son-in-law, isn't he?\"\nexclaimed the old scamp, as, seizing the brandy decanter, he\nhurled it straight at Rodd's head, only missing him by an inch.\n\n\"Don't you think you had both better go to bed, gentlemen?\" I\ninquired.  \"You are saying things you might regret in the\nmorning.\"\n\nApparently they did think it, for without another word they rose\nand marched off in different directions to their respective\nrooms, which I heard both of them lock.  For my part I collected\nthe I.O.U.'s; also the diamonds which still lay upon the table,\nwhile Anscombe examined the cards.\n\n\"Marked, by Jove!\" he said.  \"Oh! my dear Quatermain, never have I\nhad such an amusing evening in all my life.\"\n\n\"Shut up, you silly idiot,\" I answered.  \"There'll be murder done\nover this business, and I only hope it won't be on us.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\n\n\nMISS HEDA\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might be thought that after all this there would have been a\npainful explanation on the following morning, but nothing of the\nsort happened.  After all the greatest art is the art of ignoring\nthings, without which the world could scarcely go on, even among\nthe savage races.  Thus on this occasion the two chief actors in\nthe scene of the previous night pretended that they had forgotten\nwhat took place, as I believe, to a large extent truly.  The\nfierce flame of drink in the one and of passion in the other had\nburnt the web of remembrance to ashes.  They knew that something\nunpleasant had occurred and its main outlines; the rest had\nvanished away; perhaps because they knew also that they were not\nresponsible for what they said and did, and therefore that what\noccurred had no right to a permanent niche in their memories.  It\nwas, as it were, something outside of their normal selves.  At\nleast so I conjectured, and their conduct seemed to give colour\nto my guess.\n\nThe doctor spoke to me of the matter first.\n\n\"I fear there was a row last night,\" he said; \"it has happened\nhere before over cards, and will no doubt happen again until\nmatters clear themselves up somehow.  Marnham, as you see,\ndrinks, and when drunk is the biggest liar in the world, and I, I\nam sorry to say, am cursed with a violent temper.  Don't judge\neither of us too harshly.  If you were a doctor you would know\nthat all these things come to us with our blood, and we didn't\nfashion our own clay, did we?  Have some coffee, won't you?\"\n\nSubsequently when Rodd wasn't there, Marnham spoke also and with\nthat fine air of courtesy which was peculiar to him.\n\n\"I owe a deep apology,\" he said, \"to yourself and Mr. Anscombe.\nI do not recall much about it, but I know there was a scene last\nnight over those cursed cards.  A weakness overtakes me\nsometimes.  I will say no more, except that you, who are also a\nman who perhaps have felt weaknesses of one sort or another,\nwill, I hope, make allowances for me and pay no attention to\nanything that I may have said or done in the presence of guests;\nyes, that is what pains me--in the presence of guests.\"\n\nSomething in his distinguished manner caused me to reflect upon\nevery peccadillo that I had ever committed, setting it in its\nvery worst light.\n\n\"Quite so,\" I answered, \"quite so.  Pray do not mention the\nmatter any more, although--\" These words seemed to jerk\nthemselves out of my throat, \"you did call each other by such\nvery hard names.\"\n\n\"I daresay,\" he answered with a vacant smile, \"but if so they\nmeant nothing.\"\n\n\"No, I understand, just like a lovers' quarrel.  But look here,\nyou left some diamonds on the table which I took to keep the\nKaffirs out of temptation.  I will fetch them.\"\n\n\"Did I?  Well, probably I left some I.O.U.'s also which might\nserve for pipelights.  So suppose we set the one against the\nother.  I don't know the value of either the diamonds or the\npipelights, it may be less or more, but for God's sake don't let\nme see the beastly things again.  There's no need, I have\nplenty.\"\n\n\"I must speak to Anscombe,\" I answered.  \"The money at stake was\nhis, not mine.\"\n\n\"Speak to whom you will,\" he replied, and I noted that the\nthrobbing vein upon his forehead indicated a rising temper.  \"But\nnever let me see those diamonds again.  Throw them into the\ngutter if you wish, but never let me see them again, or there\nwill be trouble.\"\n\nThen he flung out of the room, leaving his breakfast almost\nuntasted.\n\nReflecting that this queer old bird probably did not wish to be\ncross-questioned as to his possession of so many uncut diamonds,\nor that they were worth much less than the sum he had lost, or\npossibly that they were not diamonds at all but glass, I went to\nreport the matter to Anscombe.  He only laughed and said that as\nI had got the things I had better keep them until something\nhappened, for we had both got it into our heads that something\nwould happen before we had done with that establishment.\n\nSo I went to put the stones away as safely as I could.  While I\nwas doing so I heard the rumble of wheels, and came out just in\ntime to see a Cape cart, drawn by four very good horses and\ndriven by a Hottentot in a smart hat and a red waistband, pull up\nat the garden gate.  Out of this cart presently emerged a neatly\ndressed lady, of whom all I could see was that she was young,\nslender and rather tall; also, as her back was towards me, that\nshe had a great deal of auburn hair.\n\n\"There!\" said Anscombe.  \"I knew that something would happen.\nHeda has happened.  Quatermain, as neither her venerated parent\nnor her loving fiance, for such I gather he is, seems to be\nabout, you had better go and give her a hand.\"\n\nI obeyed with a groan, heartily wishing that Heda hadn't\nhappened, since some sense warned me that she would only add to\nthe present complications.  At the gate, having given some\ninstructions to a very stout young coloured woman who, I took it,\nwas her maid, about a basket of flower roots in the cart, she\nturned round suddenly and we came face to face with the gate\nbetween us.  For a moment we stared at each other, I reflecting\nthat she really was very pretty with her delicately-shaped\nfeatures, her fresh, healthy-looking complexion, her long dark\neyelashes and her lithe and charming figure.  What she reflected\nabout me I don't know, probably nothing half so complimentary.\nSuddenly, however, her large greyish eyes grew troubled and a\nlook of alarm appeared upon her face.\n\n\"Is anything wrong with my father?\" she asked.  \"I don't see\nhim.\"\n\n\"If you mean Mr. Marnham,\" I replied, lifting my hat, \"I believe\nthat Dr. Rodd and he--\"\n\n\"Never mind about Dr. Rodd,\" she broke in with a contemptuous\nlittle jerk of her chin, \"how is my father?\"\n\n\"I imagine much as usual.  He and Dr. Rodd were here a little\nwhile ago, I suppose that they have gone out\" (as a matter of\nfact they had, but in different directions).\n\n\"Then that's all right,\" she said with a sigh of relief.  \"You\nsee, I heard that he was very ill, which is why I have come\nback.\"\n\nSo, thought I to myself, she loves that old scamp and\nshe--doesn't love the doctor.  There will be more trouble as sure\nas five and two are seven.  All we wanted was a woman to make the\npot boil over.\n\nThen I opened the gate and took a travelling bag from her hand\nwith my politest bow.\n\n\"My name is Quatermain and that of my friend Anscombe.  We are\nstaying here, you know,\" I said rather awkwardly.\n\n\"Indeed,\" she answered with a delightful smile, \"what a very\nstrange place to choose to stay in.\"\n\n\"It is a beautiful house,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Not bad, although I designed it, more or less.  But I was\nalluding to its inhabitants.\"\n\nThis finished me, and I am sure she felt that I could think of\nnothing nice to say about those inhabitants, for I heard her\nsigh.  We walked side by side up the rose-fringed path and\npresently arrived at the stoep, where Anscombe, whose hair I had\ncut very nicely on the previous day, was watching us from his\nlong chair.  They looked at each other, and I saw both of them\ncolour a little, out of mere foolishness, I suppose.\n\n\"Anscombe,\" I said, \"this is--\" and I paused, not being quite\ncertain whether she also was called Marnham.  \"Heda Marnham,\" she\ninterrupted.\n\n\"Yes--Miss Heda Marnham, and this is the Honourable Maurice\nAnscombe.\"\n\n\"Forgive me for not rising, Miss Marnham,\" said Anscombe in his\npleasant voice (by the way hers was pleasant too, full and rather\nlow, with just a suggestion of something foreign about it).  \"A\nshot through the foot prevents me at present.\"\n\n\"Who shot you?\" she asked quickly.\n\n\"Oh! only a Kaffir.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry, I hope you will get well soon.  Forgive me now, I\nmust go to look for my father.\"\n\n\"She is uncommonly pretty,\" remarked Anscombe, \"and a lady into\nthe bargain.  In reflecting on old Marnham's sins we must put it\nto his credit that he has produced a charming daughter.\"\n\n\"Too pretty and charming by half,\" I grunted.\n\n\"Perhaps Dr. Rodd is of the same way of thinking.  Great shame\nthat such a girl should be handed over to a medical scoundrel\nlike Dr. Rodd.  I wonder if she cares for him?\"\n\n\"Just about as much as a canary cares for a tom-cat.  I have\nfound that out already.\"\n\n\"Really, Quatermain, you are admirable.  I never knew anyone who\ncould make a better use of the briefest opportunity.\"\n\nThen we were silent, waiting, not without a certain impatience,\nfor the return of Miss Heda.  She did return with surprising\nquickness considering that she had found time to search for her\nparent, to change into a clean white dress, and to pin a single\nhibiscus flower on to her bodice which gave just the touch of\ncolour that was necessary to complete her costume.\n\n\"I can't find my father,\" she said, \"but the boys say he has gone\nout riding.  I can't find anybody.  When you have been summoned\nfrom a long way off and travelled post-haste, rather to your own\ninconvenience, it is amusing, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Wagons and carts in South Africa don't arrive like express\ntrains, Miss Marnham,\" said Anscombe, \"so you shouldn't be\noffended.\"\n\n\"I am not at all offended, Mr. Anscombe.  Now that I know there\nis nothing the matter with my father I'm--But, tell me, how did\nyou get your wound?\"\n\nSo he told her with much amusing detail after his fashion.  She\nlistened quietly with a puckered up brow and only made one\ncomment.  It was,--\n\n\"I wonder what white man told those Sekukuni Kaffirs that you\nwere coming.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered, \"but he deserves a bullet through\nhim somewhere above the ankle.\"\n\n\"Yes, though few people get what they deserve in this wicked\nworld.\"\n\n\"So I have often thought.  Had it been otherwise, for example, I\nshould have been--\"\n\n\"What would you have been?\" she asked, considering him curiously.\n\n\"Oh! a better shot than Mr. Allan Quatermain, and as beautiful as\na lady I once saw in my youth.\"\n\n\"Don't talk rubbish before luncheon,\" I remarked sternly, and we\nall laughed, the first wholesome laughter that I had heard at the\nTemple.  For this young lady seemed to bring happiness and\nmerriment with her.  I remember wondering what it was of which\nher coming reminded me, and concluding that it was like the sight\nand smell of a peach orchard in full bloom stumbled on suddenly\nin the black desert of the burnt winter veld.\n\nAfter this we became quite friendly.  She dilated on her skill in\nhaving produced the Temple from an old engraving, which she\nfetched and showed to us, at no greater an expense than it would\nhave cost to build an ordinary house.\n\n\"That is because the marble was at hand,\" said Anscombe.\n\n\"Quite so,\" she replied demurely.  \"Speaking in a general sense\none can do many things in life--if the marble is at hand.  Only\nmost of us when we look for marble find sandstone or mud.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" said Anscombe, \"I have generally lit upon the\nsandstone.\"\n\n\"And I on the mud,\" she mused.\n\n\"And I on all three, for the earth contains marble and mud and\nsandstone, to say nothing of gold and jewels,\" I broke in, being\ntired of silence.\n\nBut neither of them paid much attention to me.  Anscombe did say,\nout of politeness, I suppose, that pitch and subterranean fires\nshould be added, or some such nonsense.\n\nThen she began to tell him of her infantile memories of Hungary,\nwhich were extremely faint; of how they came this place and lived\nfirst of all in two large Kaffir huts, until suddenly they began\nto grow rich; of her school days at Maritzburg; of the friends\nwith whom she had been staying, and I know not what, until at\nlast I got up and went out for a walk.\n\nWhen I returned an hour or so later they were still talking, and\nso continued to do until Dr. Rodd arrived upon the scene.  At\nfirst they did not see him, for he stood at an angle to them, but\nI saw him and watched his face with a great deal of interest.\nIt, or rather its expression, was not pleasant; before now I have\nseen something like it on that of a wild beast which thinks that\nit is about to be robbed of its prey by a stronger wild beast, in\nshort, a mixture of hate, fear and jealousy--especially jealousy.\nAt the last I did not wonder, for these two seemed to be getting\non uncommonly well.\n\nThey were, so to speak, well matched.  She, of course, was the\nbetter looking of the two, a really pretty and attractive young\nwoman indeed, but the vivacity of Anscombe's face, the twinkle of\nhis merry blue eyes and its general refinement made up for what\nhe lacked--regularity of feature.  I think he had just told her\none of his good stories which he always managed to make so\nhumorous by a trick of pleasing and harmless exaggeration, and\nthey were both laughing merrily.  Then she caught sight of the\ndoctor and her merriment evaporated like a drop of water on a hot\nshovel.  Distinctly I saw her pull herself together and prepare\nfor something.\n\n\"How do you do?\" she said rapidly, rising and holding out her\nslim sun-browned hand.  \"But I need not ask, you look so well.\"\n\n\"How do you do, my dear,\" with a heavy emphasis on the \"dear\" he\nanswered slowly.  \"But I needn't ask, for I see that you are in\nperfect health and spirits,\" and he bent forward as though to\nkiss her.\n\nSomehow or other she avoided that endearment or seal of\npossession.  I don't quite know how, as I turned my head away,\nnot wishing to witness what I felt to be unpleasant.  When I\nlooked up again, however, I saw that she had avoided it, the\nscowl on his face the demureness of hers and Anscombe's evident\namusement assured me of this.  She was asking about her father;\nhe answered that he also seemed quite well.\n\n\"Then why did you write to tell me that I ought to come as he was\nnot at all well?\" she inquired, with a lifting of her delicate\neyebrows.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at that moment Marnham\nhimself appeared.\n\n\"Oh! father,\" she said, and rushed into his arms, while he kissed\nher tenderly on both cheeks.\n\nSo I was not mistaken, thought I to myself, she does really love\nthis moral wreck, and what is more, he loves her, which shows\nthat there must be good in him.  Is anyone truly bad, I wondered,\nor for the matter of that, truly good either?  Is it not all a\nquestion of circumstance and blood?\n\nNeither then or at any other time have I found an answer to the\nproblem.  At any rate to me there seemed something beautiful\nabout the meeting of these two.\n\nThe influence of Miss Heda in the house was felt at once.  The\nboys became smarter and put on clean clothes.  Vases of flowers\nappeared in the various rooms; ours was turned out and cleaned, a\ndisagreeable process so far as we were concerned.  Moreover, at\ndinner both Marnham and Rodd wore dress clothes with short\njackets, a circumstance that put Anscombe and myself to shame\nsince we had none.  It was curious to see how with those dress\nclothes, which doubtless awoke old associations within him,\nMarnham changed his colour like a chameleon.  Really he might\nhave been the colonel of a cavalry regiment rising to toast the\nQueen after he had sent round the wine, so polite and polished\nwas his talk.  Who could have identified the man with the dry old\nruffian of twenty-four hours before, he who was drinking claret\n(and very good claret too) mixed with water and listening with a\npolite interest to all the details of his daughter's journey?\nEven the doctor looked a gentleman, which doubtless he was once\nupon a time, in evening dress.  Moreover, some kind of truce had\nbeen arranged.  He no longer called Miss Heda \"My dear\" or\nattempted any familiarities, while she on more than one occasion\nvery distinctly called him Dr. Rodd.\n\nSo much for that night and for several others that followed.  As\nfor the days they went by pleasantly and idly.  Heda walked about\non her father's arm, conversed in friendly fashion with the\ndoctor, always watching him, I noticed, as a cat watches a dog\nthat she knows is waiting an opportunity to spring, and for the\nrest associated with us as much as she could.  Particularly did\nshe seem to take refuge behind my own insignificance, having, I\nsuppose, come to the conclusion that I was a harmless person who\nmight possibly prove useful.  But all the while I felt that the\nstorm was banking up.  Indeed Marnham himself, at any rate to a\ngreat extent, played the part of the cloud-compelling Jove, for\nsoon it became evident to me, and without doubt to Dr. Rodd also,\nthat he was encouraging the intimacy between his daughter and\nAnscombe by every means in his power.\n\nIn one way and another he had fully informed himself as to\nAnscombe's prospects in life, which were brilliant enough.\nMoreover he liked the man who, as the remnant of the better\nperceptions of his youth told him, was one of the best class of\nEnglishmen, and what is more, he saw that Heda liked him also, as\nmuch indeed as she disliked Rodd.  He even spoke to me of the\nmatter in a round-about kind of fashion, saying that the young\nwoman who married Anscombe would be lucky and that the father who\nhad him for a son-in-law might go to his grave confident of his\nchild's happiness.  I answered that I agreed with him, unless the\nlady's affections had already caused her to form other ties.\n\n\"Affections!\" he exclaimed, dropping all pretence, \"there are\nnone involved in this accursed business, as you are quite sharp\nenough to have seen for yourself.\"\n\n\"I understood that an engagement was involved,\" I remarked.\n\n\"On my part, perhaps, not on hers,\" he answered.  \"Oh! can't you\nunderstand, Quatermain, that sometimes men find themselves forced\ninto strange situations against their will?\"\n\nRemembering the very ugly name that I had heard Rodd call Marnham\non the night of the card party, I reflected that I could\nunderstand well enough, but I only said--\n\n\"After all marriage is a matter that concerns a woman even more\nthan it does her father, one, in short, of which she must be the\njudge.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Quatermain, but there are some daughters who are\nprepared to make great sacrifices for their fathers.  Well, she\nwill be of age ere long, if only I can stave it off till then.\nBut how, how?\" and with a groan he turned and left me.\n\nThat old gentleman's neck is in some kind of a noose, thought I\nto myself, and his difficulty is to prevent the rope from being\ndrawn tight.  Meanwhile this poor girl's happiness and future are\nat stake.\n\n\"Allan,\" said Anscombe to me a little later, for by now he called\nme by my Christian name, \"I suppose you haven't heard anything\nabout those oxen, have you?\"\n\n\"No, I could scarcely expect to yet, but why do you ask?\"\n\nHe smiled in his droll fashion and replied, \"Because, interesting\nas this household is in sundry ways, I think it is about time\nthat we, or at any rate that I, got out of it.\"\n\n\"Your leg isn't fit to travel yet, Anscombe, although Rodd says\nthat all the symptoms are very satisfactory.\"\n\n\"Yes, but to tell you the truth I am experiencing other symptoms\nquite unknown to that beloved physician and so unfamiliar to\nmyself that I attribute them to the influences of the locality.\nAltitude affects the heart, does it not, and this house stands\nhigh.\"\n\n\"Don't play off your jokes on me,\" I said sternly.  \"What do you\nmean?\"\n\n\"I wonder if you find Miss Heda attractive, Allan, or if you are\ntoo old.  I believe there comes an age when the only beauties\nthat can move a man are those of architecture, or scenery, or\nproperly cooked food.\"\n\n\"Hang it all! I am not Methusaleh,\" I replied; \"but if you mean\nthat you are falling in love with Heda, why the deuce don't you\nsay so, instead of wasting my time and your own?\"\n\n\"Because time was given to us to waste.  Properly considered it\nis the best use to which it can be put, or at any rate the one\nthat does least mischief.  Also because I wished to make you say\nit for me that I might judge from the effect of your words\nwhether it is or is not true.  I may add that I fear the former\nto be the case.\"\n\n\"Well, if you are in love with the girl you can't expect one so\nancient as myself, who is quite out of touch with such follies,\nto teach you how to act.\"\n\n\"No, Allan.  Unfortunately there are occasions when one must\nrely upon one's own wisdom, and mine, what there is of it, tells\nme I had better get out of this.  But I can't ride even if I took\nthe horse and you ran behind, and the oxen haven't come.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you could borrow Miss Marnham's cart in which to run\naway from her,\" I suggested sarcastically.\n\n\"Perhaps, though I believe it would be fatal to my foot to sit up\nin a cart for the next few days, and the horses seem to have been\nsent off somewhere.  Look here, old fellow,\" he went on, dropping\nhis bantering tone, \"it's rather awkward to make a fool of\noneself over a lady who is engaged to some one else, especially\nif one suspects that with a little encouragement she might begin\nto walk the same road.  The truth is I have taken the fever\npretty bad, worse than ever I did before, and if it isn't stopped\nsoon it will become chronic.\"\n\n\"Oh no, Anscombe, only intermittent at the worst, and African\nmalaria nearly always yields to a change of climate.\"\n\n\"How can I expect a cynic and a misogynist to understand the\nsimple fervour of an inexperienced soul--Oh! drat it all,\nQuatermain, stop your acid chaff and tell me what is to be done.\nReally I am in a tight place.\"\n\n\"Very; so tight that I rejoice to think, as you were kind enough\nto point out, that my years protect me from anything of the sort.\nI have no advice to give; I think you had better ask it of the\nlady.\"\n\n\"Well, we did have a little conversation, hypothetical of course,\nabout some friends of ours who found themselves similarly\nsituated, and I regret to say without result.\"\n\n\"Indeed.  I did not know you had any mutual acquaintances.  What\ndid she say and do?\"\n\n\"She said nothing, only sighed and looked as though she were\ngoing to burst into tears, and all she did was to walk away.  I'd\nhave followed her if I could, but as my crutch wasn't there it\nwas impossible.  It seemed to me that suddenly I had come up\nagainst a brick wall, that there was something on her mind which\nshe could not or would not let out.\"\n\n\"Yes, and if you want to know, I will tell you what it is.  Rodd\nhas got a hold over Marnham of a sort that would bring him\nsomewhere near the gallows.  As the price of his silence Marnham\nhas promised him his daughter.  The daughter knows that her\nfather is in this man's power, though I think she does not know\nin what way, and being a good girl--\"\n\n\"An angel you mean--do call her by her right name, especially in\na place where angels are so much wanted.\"\n\n\"Well, an angel if you like--she has promised on her part to\nmarry a man she loathes in order to save her parent's bacon.\"\n\n\"Just what I concluded, from what we heard in the row.  I wonder\nwhich of that pair is the bigger blackguard.  Well, Allan, that\nsettles it.  You and I are on the side of the angel.  You will\nhave to get her out of this scrape and--if she'll have me, I'll\nmarry her; and if she won't, why it can't be helped.  Now that's\na fair division of labour.  How are you going to do it? I haven't\nan idea, and if I had, I should not presume to interfere with one\nso much older and wiser than myself.\"\n\n\"I suppose that by the time you appeared in it, the game of heads\nI win and tails you lose had died out of the world,\" I replied\nwith an indignant snort.  \"I think the best thing I can do will\nbe to take the horse and look for those oxen.  Meanwhile you can\nsettle your business by the light of your native genius, and I\nonly hope you'll finish it without murder and sudden death.\"\n\n\"I say, old fellow,\" said Anscombe earnestly, \"you don't really\nmean to go off and leave me in this hideousness? I haven't\nbothered much up to the present because I was sure that you would\nfind a way out, which would be nothing to a man of your intellect\nand experience.  I mean it honestly, I do indeed.\"\n\n\"Do you?  Well, I can only say that my mind is a perfect blank,\nbut if you will stop talking I will try to think the matter over.\nThere's Miss Heda in the garden cutting flowers.  I will go to\nhelp her, which will be a very pleasant change.\"\n\nAnd I went, leaving him to stare after me jealously.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\n\n\nTHE STOEP\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I reached Miss Heda she was collecting half-opened monthly\nroses from the hedge, and not quite knowing what to say I made\nthe appropriate quotation.  At least it was appropriate to my\nthought, and, from her answer, to hers also.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I am gathering them while I may,\" and she\nsighed and, as I thought, glanced towards the verandah, though of\nthis I could not be sure because of the wide brim of the hat she\nwas wearing.\n\nThen we talked a little on indifferent matters, while I pricked\nmy fingers helping to pluck the roses.  She asked me if I thought\nthat Anscombe was getting on well, and how long it would be\nbefore he could travel.  I replied that Dr. Rodd could tell her\nbetter than myself, but that I hoped in about a week.\n\n\"In a week!\" she said, and although she tried to speak lightly\nthere was dismay in her voice.\n\n\"I hope you don't think it too long,\" I answered; \"but even if he\nis fit to go, the oxen have not come yet, and I don't quite know\nwhen they will.\"\n\n\"Too long!\" she exclaimed.  \"Too long!  Oh! if you only knew what\nit is to me to have such guests as you are in this place,\" and\nher dark eyes filled with tears.\n\nBy now we had passed to the side of the house in search of some\nother flower that grew in the shade, I think it was mignonette,\nand were out of sight of the verandah and quite alone.\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain,\"  she said hurriedly, \"I am wondering whether to\nask your advice about something, if you would give it.  I have no\none to consult here,\" she added rather piteously.\n\n\"That is for you to decide.  If you wish to do so I am old enough\nto be your father, and will do my best to help.\"\n\nWe walked on to an orange grove that stood about forty yards\naway, ostensibly to pick some fruit, but really because we knew\nthat there we should be out of hearing and could see any one who\napproached.\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain,\" she said presently in a low voice, \"I am in\ngreat trouble, almost the greatest a woman can have.  I am\nengaged to be married to a man whom I do not care for.\"\n\n\"Then why not break it off?  It may be unpleasant, but it is\ngenerally best to face unpleasant things, and nothing can be so\nbad as marrying a man whom you do not--care for.\"\n\n\"Because I cannot--I dare not.  I have to obey.\"\n\n\"How old are you, Miss Marnham?\"\n\n\"I shall be of age in three months' time.  You may guess that I\ndid not intend to return here until they were over, but I was,\nwell--trapped.  He wrote to me that my father was ill and I\ncame.\"\n\n\"At any rate when they are over you will not have to obey any\none.  It is not long to wait.\"\n\n\"It is an eternity.  Besides this is not so much a question of\nobedience as of duty and of love.  I love my father who, whatever\nhis faults, has always been very kind to me.\"\n\n\"And I am sure he loves you.  Why not go to him and tell him your\ntrouble?\"\n\n\"He knows it already, Mr. Quatermain, and hates this marriage\neven more than I do, if that is possible.  But he is driven to\nit, as I am.  Oh! I must tell the truth.  The doctor has some\nhold over him.  My father has done something dreadful; I don't\nknow what and I don't want to know, but if it came out it would\nruin my father, or worse, worse.  I am the price of his silence.\nOn the day of our marriage he will destroy the proofs.  If I\nrefuse to marry him, they will be produced and then--\"\n\n\"It is difficult,\" I said.\n\n\"It is more than difficult, it is terrible.  If you could see all\nthere is in my heart, you would know how terrible.\"\n\n\"I think I can see, Miss Heda.  Don't say any more now.  Give me\ntime to consider.  In case of necessity come to me again, and be\nsure that I will protect you.\"\n\n\"But you are going in a week.\"\n\n\"Many things happen in a week.  Sufficient to the day is its\nevil.  At the end of the week we will come to some decision\nunless everything is already decided.\"\n\nFor the next twenty-four hours I reflected on this pretty problem\nas hard as ever I did on anything in all my life.  Here was a\nyoung woman who must somehow be protected from a scoundrel, but who\ncould not be protected because she herself had to protect another\nscoundrel--to wit, her own father.  Could the thing be faced out?\nImpossible, for I was sure that Marnham had committed a murder,\nor murders, of which Rodd possessed evidence that would hang him.\nCould Heda be married to Anscombe at once?  Yes, if both were\nwilling, but then Marnham would still be hung.  Could they elope?\nPossibly, but with the same result.  Could I take her away and\nput her under the protection of the Court at Pretoria?  Yes, but\nwith the same result.  I wondered what my Hottentot retainer,\nHans, would have advised, he who was named Light-in-Darkness, and\nin his own savage way was the cleverest and most cunning man that\nI have met.  Alas! I could not raise him from the grave to tell\nme, and yet I knew well what he would have answered.\n\n\"Baas,\" he would have said, \"this is a rope which only the pale\nold man (i.e., death) can cut.  Let this doctor die or let the\nfather die, and the maiden will be free.  Surely heaven is\nlonging for one or both of them, and if necessary, Baas, I\nbelieve that I can point out a path to heaven!\"\n\nI laughed to myself at the thought, which was one that a white\nman could not entertain even as a thought.  And I felt that the\nhypothetical Hans was right, death alone could cut this knot, and\nthe reflection made me shiver.\n\nThat night I slept uneasily and dreamed.  I dreamed that once\nmore I was in the Black Kloof in Zululand, seated in front of the\nhuts at the end of the kloof.  Before me squatted the old wizard,\nZikali, wrapped up in his kaross--Zikali, the\n\"Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born,\" whom I had not seen for\nyears.  Near him were the ashes of a fire, by the help of which I\nknew he had been practising divination.  He looked up and laughed\none of his terrible laughs.\n\n\"So you are here again, Macumazahn,\" he said, \"grown older, but\nstill the same; here at the appointed hour.  What do you come to\nseek from the Opener of Roads?  Not Mameena as I think this time.\nNo, no, it is she who seeks you this time, Macumazahn.  She found\nyou once, did she not?  Far away to the north among a strange\npeople who worshipped an Ivory Child, a people of whom I knew in\nmy youth, and afterwards, for was not their prophet, Harut, a\nfriend of mine and one of our brotherhood?  She found you beneath\nthe tusks of the elephant, Jana, whom Macumazahn the skilful\ncould not hit.  Oh! do not look astonished.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" I asked in my dream.\n\n\"Very simply, Macumazahn.  A little yellow man named Hans has\nbeen with me and told me all the story not an hour ago, after\nwhich I sent for Mameena to learn if it were true.  She will be\nglad to meet you, Macumazahn, she who has a hungry heart that\ndoes not forget.  Oh! don't be afraid.  I mean here beneath the\nsun, in the land beyond there will be no need for her to meet you\nsince she will dwell ever at your side.\"\n\n\"Why do you lie to me, Zikali?\" I seemed to ask.  \"How can a dead\nman speak to you and how can I meet a woman who is dead?\"\n\n\"Seek the answer to that question in the hour of the battle when\nthe white men, your brothers, fall beneath assegai as weeds fall\nbefore the hoe--or perhaps before it.  But have done with\nMameena, since she who never grows more old can well afford to\nwait.  It is not of Mameena that you came to speak to me; it is\nof a fair white woman named Heddana you would speak, and of the\nman she loves, you, who will ever be mixing yourself up in\naffairs of others, and therefore must bear their burdens with no\npay save that of honour.  Hearken, for the time is short.  When\nthe storm bursts upon them bring hither the fair maiden, Heddana,\nand the white lord, Mauriti, and I will shelter them for your\nsake.  Take them nowhere else.  Bring them hither if they would\nescape trouble.  I shall be glad to see you, Macumazahn, for at\nlast I am about to smite the Zulu House of Senzangacona, my foes,\nwith a bladder full of blood, and oh! it stains their doorposts\nred.\"\n\nThen I woke up, feeling afraid, as one does after a nightmare,\nand was comforted to hear Anscombe sleeping quietly on the other\nside of the room.\n\n\"Mauriti.  Why did Zikali call him Mauriti?\" I wondered drowsily\nto myself.  \"Oh! of course his name is Maurice, and it was a Zulu\ncorruption of a common sort as was Heddana of Heda.\"  Then I\ndozed off again, and by the morning had forgotten all about my\ndream until it was brought back to me by subsequent events.\nStill it was this and nothing else that put it into my head to\nfly to Zululand on an emergency that was to arise ere long.*\n\n[*--For the history of Zikali and Mameena see the book called\n_Child of Storm_ by H. Rider Haggard.]\n\nThat evening Rodd was absent from dinner, and on inquiring where\nhe might be, I was informed that he had ridden to visit a Kaffir\nheadman, a patient of his who lived at a distance, and would very\nprobably sleep at the kraal, returning early next day.  One of\nthe topics of conversation during dinner was as to where the\nexact boundary line used to run between the Transvaal and the\ncountry over which the Basuto chief, Sekukuni, claimed ownership\nand jurisdiction.  Marnham said that it passed within a couple of\nmiles of his house, and when we rose, the moon being very bright,\noffered to show me where the beacons had been placed years before\nby a Boer Commission.  I accepted, as the night was lovely for a\nstroll after the hot day.  Also I was half conscious of another\nundefined purpose in my mind, which perhaps may have spread to\nthat of Marnham.  Those two young people looked very happy\ntogether there on the stoep, and as they must part so soon it\nwould, I thought, be kind to give them the opportunity of a quiet\nchat.\n\nSo off we went to the brow of the hill on which the Temple stood,\nwhence old Marnham pointed out to me a beacon, which I could not\nsee in the dim, silvery bush-veld below, and how the line ran\nfrom it to another beacon somewhere else.\n\n\"You know the Yellow-wood swamp,\" he said.  \"It passes straight\nthrough that.  That is why those Basutos who were following you\npulled up upon the edge of the swamp, though as a matter of fact,\naccording to their ideas, they had a perfect right to kill you on\ntheir side of the line which cuts through the middle.\"\n\nI made some remark to the effect that I presumed that the line\nhad in fact ceased to exist at all, as the Basuto territory had\npractically become British; after which we strolled back to the\nhouse.  Walking quietly between the tall rose hedges and without\nspeaking, for each of us was preoccupied with his own thoughts,\nsuddenly we came upon a very pretty scene.\n\nWe had left Anscombe and Heda seated side by side on the stoep.\nThey were still there, but much closer together.  In fact his\narms were round her, and they were kissing each other in a\nremarkably whole-hearted way.  About this there could be no\nmistake, since the rimpi-strung couch on which they sat was\nimmediately under the hanging lamp--a somewhat unfortunate\nsituation for such endearments.  But what did they think of\nhanging lamps or any other lights, save those of their own eyes,\nthey who were content to kiss and murmur words of passion as\nthough they were as much alone as Adam and Eve in Eden?  What did\nthey think either of the serpent coiled about the bole of this\ntree of knowledge whereof they had just plucked the ripe and\nmaddening fruit?\n\nBy a mutual instinct Marnham and I withdrew ourselves, very\ngently indeed, purposing to skirt round the house and enter it\nfrom behind, or to be seized with a fit of coughing at the gate,\nor to do something to announce our presence at a convenient\ndistance.  When we had gone a little way we heard a crash in the\nbushes.\n\n\"Another of those cursed baboons robbing the garden,\" remarked\nMarnham reflectively.\n\n\"I think he is going to rob the house also,\" I replied, turning\nto point to something dark that seemed to be leaping up on to the\nverandah.\n\nNext moment we heard Heda utter a little cry of alarm, and a man\nsay in a low fierce voice--\n\n\"So I have caught you at last, have I!\"\n\n\"The doctor has returned from his business rounds sooner than was\nexpected, and I think that we had better join the party,\" I\nremarked, and made a bee line for the stoep, Marnham following\nme.\n\nI think that I arrived just in time to prevent mischief.  There,\nwith a revolver in his hand, stood Rodd, tall and formidable, his\ndark face looking like that of Satan himself, a very monument of\nrage and jealousy.  There in front of him on the couch sat Heda,\ngrasping its edge with her fingers, her cheeks as pale as a sheet\nand her eyes shining.  By her side was Anscombe, cool and\ncollected as usual, I noticed, but evidently perplexed.\n\n\"If there is any shooting to be done,\" he was saying, \"I think\nyou had better begin with me.\"\n\nHis calmness seemed to exasperate Rodd, who lifted the revolver.\nBut I too was prepared, for in that house I always went armed.\nThere was no time to get at the man, who was perhaps fifteen feet\naway, and I did not want to hurt him.  So I did the best I could;\nthat is, I fired at the pistol in his hand, and the light being\ngood, struck it near the hilt and knocked it off the barrel\nbefore the he could press the trigger, if he really meant to\nshoot.\n\n\"That's a good shot,\" remarked Anscombe who had seen me, while\nRodd stared at the hilt which he still held.\n\n\"A lucky one,\" I answered, walking forward.  \"And now, Dr. Rodd,\nwill you be so good as to tell me what you mean by flourishing a\nrevolver, presumably loaded, in the faces of a lady and an\nunarmed man?\"\n\n\"What the devil is that to you,\" he asked furiously, \"and what do\nyou mean by firing at me?\"\n\n\"A great deal,\" I answered, \"seeing that a young woman and my\nfriend are concerned.  As for firing at you, had I done so you\nwould not be asking questions now.  I fired at the pistol in your\nhand, but if there is more trouble next time it shall be at the\nholder,\" and I glanced at my revolver.\n\nSeeing that I meant business he made no reply, but turned upon\nMarnham who had followed me.\n\n\"This is your work, you old villain,\" he said in a low voice that\nwas heavy with hate.  \"You promised your daughter to me.  She is\nengaged to me, and now I find her in this wanderer's arms.\"\n\n\"What have I to do with it?\" said Marnham.  \"Perhaps she has\nchanged her mind.  You had better ask her.\"\n\n\"There is no need to ask me,\" interrupted Heda, who now seemed to\nhave got her nerve again.  \"I _have_ changed my mind.  I never\nloved you, Dr. Rodd, and I will not marry you.  I love Mr.\nAnscombe here, and as he has asked me to be his wife I mean to\nmarry him.\"\n\n\"I see,\" he sneered, \"you want to be a peeress one day, no doubt.\nWell, you never shall if I can help it.  Perhaps, too, this fine\ngentleman of yours will not be so particularly anxious to marry\nyou when he learns that you are the daughter of a murderer.\"\n\nThat word was like a bombshell bursting among us.  We looked at\neach other as people, yet dazed with the shock, might on a\nbattlefield when the noise of the explosion has died and the\nsmoke cleared away, to see who is still alive.  Anscombe spoke\nthe first.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean or to what you refer,\" he said\nquietly.  \"But at any rate this lady who has promised to marry me\nis innocent, and therefore if all her ancestors had been\nmurderers it would not in the slightest turn me from my purpose\nof marrying her.\"\n\nShe looked at him, and all the gratitude in the world shone in\nher frightened eyes.  Marnham stepped, or rather staggered\nforward, the blue vein throbbing on forehead.\n\n\"He lies,\" he said hoarsely, tugging at his long beard.  \"Listen\nnow and I will tell you the truth.  Once, more than a year ago, I\nwas drunk and in a rage.  In this state I fired at a Kaffir to\nfrighten him, and by some devil's chance shot him dead.  That's\nwhat he calls being a murderer.\"\n\n\"I have another tale,\" said Rodd, \"with which I will not trouble\nthis company just now.  Look here, Heda, either you fulfil your\npromise and marry me, or your father swings.\"\n\nShe gasped and sank together on the seat as though she had been\nshot.  Then I took up my parable.\n\n\"Are you the man,\" I asked, \"to accuse others of crime?  Let us\nsee.  You have spent several months in an English prison (I gave\nthe name) for a crime I won't mention.\"\n\n\"How do you know--\" he began.\n\n\"Never mind, I do know and the prison books will show it.\nFurther, your business is that of selling guns and ammunition to\nthe Basutos of Sekukuni's tribe, who, although the expedition\nagainst them has been temporarily recalled, are still the Queen's\nenemies.  Don't deny it, for I have the proofs.  Further, it was\nyou who advised Sekukuni to kill us when we went down to his\ncountry to shoot the other day, because you were afraid that we\nshould discover whence he got his guns.\"  (This was a bow drawn\nat a venture, but the arrow went home, for I saw his jaw drop.)\n\"Further, I believe you to be an illicit diamond buyer, and I\nbelieve also that you have again been arranging with the Basutos\nto make an end of us, though of these last two items at present I\nlack positive proof.  Now, Dr. Rodd, I ask you for the second\ntime whether you are a person to accuse others of crimes and\nwhether, should you do so, you will be considered a credible\nwitness when your own are brought to light?\"\n\n\"If I had been guilty of any of these things, which I am not, it is\nobvious that my partner must have shared in all of them, except\nthe first.  So if you inform against me, you inform against him,\nand the father of Heda, whom your friend wishes to marry, will,\naccording to your showing, be proved a gun-runner, a thief and a\nwould-be murderer of his guests.  I should advise you to leave\nthat business alone, Mr. Quatermain.\"\n\nThe reply was bold and clever, so much so that I regarded this\nblackguard with a certain amount of admiration, as I answered--\n\n\"I shall take your advice if you take mine to leave another\nbusiness alone, that of this young lady and her father, but not\notherwise.\"\n\n\"Then spare your breath and do your worst; only careful, sharp as\nyou think yourself, that your meddling does not recoil on your\nown head.  Listen, Heda, either you make up your mind to marry me\nat once and arrange that this young gentleman, who as a doctor I\nassure you is now quite fit to travel without injury to his\nhealth, leaves this house to-morrow with the spy Quatermain--you\nmight lend him the Cape cart to go in--or I start with the proofs\nto lay a charge of murder against your father.  I give you till\nto-morrow morning to have a family council to think it over.\nGood-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" I answered as he passed me, \"and please be careful\nthat none of us see your face again before to-morrow morning.  As\nyou may happen to have heard, my native name means\nWatcher-by-Night,\" and I looked at the revolver in my hand.\n\nWhen he had vanished I remarked in as cheerful voice as I could\ncommand, that I thought it was bedtime, and as nobody stirred,\nadded, \"Don't be afraid, young lady.  If you feel lonely, you\nmust tell that stout maid of yours to sleep in your room.  Also,\nas the night is so hot I shall take my nap on the stoep, there,\njust opposite your window.  No, don't let us talk any more now.\nThere will be plenty of time for that to-morrow.\"\n\nShe rose, looked at Anscombe, looked at me, looked at her father\nvery pitifully; then with a little exclamation of despair passed\ninto her room by the French window, where presently I heard her\ncall the native maid and tell her that she was to sleep with her.\n\nMarnham watched her depart.  Then he too went with his head bowed\nand staggering a little in his walk.  Next Anscombe rose and\nlimped off into his room, I following him.\n\n\"Well, young man,\" I said, \"you have put us all in the soup now\nand no mistake.\"\n\n\"Yes, Allan, I am afraid I have.  But on the whole don't you\nthink it rather interesting soup--so many unexpected ingredients,\nyou see!\"\n\n\"Interesting soup!  Unexpected ingredients!\" I repeated after\nhim, adding, \"Why not call it hell's broth at once?\"\n\nThen he became serious, dreadfully serious.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, \"I love Heda, and whatever her family\nhistory may be I mean to marry her and face the row at home.\"\n\n\"You could scarcely do less in all the circumstances, and as for\nrows, that young lady would soon fit herself into any place that\nyou can give her.  But the question is, how can you marry her?\"\n\n\"Oh! something will happen,\" he replied optimistically.\n\n\"You are quite right there.  Something will certainly happen, but\nthe point is--what? Something was very near happening when I\nturned up on that stoep, so near that I think it was lucky for\nyou, or for Miss Heda, or both, that I have learned how to handle\na pistol.  Now let me see your foot, and don't speak another word\nto me about all this business to-night.  I'd rather tackle it\nwhen I am clear-headed in the morning.\"\n\nWell, I examined his instep and leg very carefully and found\nthat Rodd was right.  Although it still hurt him to walk, the\nwound was quite healed and all inflammation had gone from the\nlimb.  Now it was only a question of time for the sinews to right\nthemselves.  While I was thus engaged he held forth on the\nvirtues and charms of Heda, I making no comment.\n\n\"Lie down and get to sleep, if you can,\" I said when I had\nfinished.  \"The door is locked and I am going on to the stoep, so\nyou needn't be afraid of the windows.  Good-night.\"\n\nI went out and sat myself down in such a position that by the\nlight of the hanging lamp, which still burned, I could make sure\nthat no one could approach either Heda's or my room without my\nseeing him.  For the rest, all my life I have been accustomed to\nnight vigils, and the loaded revolver hung from my wrist by a\nloop of hide.  Moreover, never had I felt less sleepy.  There I\nsat hour after hour, thinking.\n\nThe substance of my thoughts does not matter, since the events\nthat followed make them superfluous to the story.  I will merely\nrecord, therefore, that towards dawn a great horror took hold of\nme.  I did not know of what I was afraid, but I was much afraid\nof something.  Nothing was passing in either Heda's or our room,\nof that I made sure by personal examination.  Therefore it would\nseem that my terrors were unnecessary, and yet they grew and\ngrew.  I felt sure that something was happening somewhere, a\ndread occurrence which it was beyond my power to prevent, though\nwhether it were in this house or at the other end of Africa I did\nnot know.\n\nThe mental depression increased and culminated.  Then of a sudden\nit passed completely away, and as I mopped the sweat from off my\nbrow I noticed that dawn was breaking.  It was a tender and\nbeautiful dawn, and in a dim way I took it as a good omen.  Of\ncourse it was nothing but the daily resurrection of the sun, and\nyet it brought to me comfort and hope.  The night was past with\nall its fears; the light had come with all its joys.  From that\nmoment I was certain that we should triumph over these\ndifficulties and that the end of them would be peace.\n\nSo sure was I that I ventured to take a nap, knowing that the\nslightest movement or sound would wake me.  I suppose I slept\nuntil six o'clock, when I was aroused by a footfall.  I sprang\nup, and saw before me one of our native servants.  He was\ntrembling and his face was ashen beneath the black.  Moreover he\ncould not speak.  All he did was to put his head on one side,\nlike a dead man, and keep on pointing downwards.  Then with his\nmouth open and starting eyes he beckoned to me to follow him.\n\nI followed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\n\n\nRODD'S LAST CARD\n\n\n\n\n\nThe man led me to Marnham's room, which I had never entered\nbefore.  All I could see at first, for the shutters were closed,\nwas that the place seemed large, as bedchambers go in South\nAfrica.  When my eyes grew accustomed to the light, I made out\nthe figure of a man seated in a chair with his head bent forward\nover a table that was placed at the foot of the bed almost in the\ncentre of the room.  I threw open the shutters and the morning\nlight poured in.  The man was Marnham.  On the table were writing\nmaterials, also a brandy bottle with only a dreg of spirit in it.\nI looked for the glass and found it by his side on the floor,\nshattered, not merely broken.\n\n\"Drunk,\" I said aloud, whereon the servant, who understood me,\nspoke for the first time, saying in a frightened voice in Dutch--\n\n\"No, Baas, dead, half cold.  I found him so just now.\"\n\nI bent down and examined Marnham, also felt his face.  Sure\nenough, he was dead, for his jaw had fallen; also his flesh was\nchill, and from him came a horrible smell of brandy.  I thought\nfor a moment, then bade the boy fetch Dr. Rodd and say nothing\nto any one else, He went, and now for the first time I noticed a\nlarge envelope addressed \"Allan Quatermain, Esq.\" in a somewhat\nshaky hand.  This I picked up and slipped into my pocket.\n\nRodd arrived half dressed.\n\n\"What's the matter now?\" he growled.\n\nI pointed to Marnham, saying--\n\n\"That is a question for you to answer.\n\n\"Oh! drunk again, I suppose,\" he said.  Then he did as I had\ndone, bent down and examined him.  A few seconds later he stepped\nor reeled back, looking as frightened as a man could be, and\nexclaiming--\n\n\"Dead as a stone, by God! Dead these three hours or more.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" I answered, \"but what killed him?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" he asked savagely.  \"Do you suspect me of\npoisoning him?\"\n\n\"My mind is open,\" I replied; \"but as you quarrelled so bitterly\nlast night, others might.\"\n\nThe bolt went home; he saw his danger.\n\n\"Probably the old sot died in a fit, or of too much brandy.  How\ncan one know without a post-mortem?  But that mustn't be made by\nme.  I'm off to inform the magistrate and get hold of another\ndoctor.  Let the body remain as it is until I return.\"\n\nI reflected quickly.  Ought I to let him go or not?  If he had\nany hand in this business, doubtless he intended to escape.\nWell, supposing this were so and he did escapee, that would be a\ngood thing for Heda, and really it was no affair of mine to bring\nthe fellow to justice.  Moreover there was nothing to show that\nhe was guilty; his whole manner seemed to point another way,\nthough of course he might be acting.\n\n\"Very well,\" I replied, \"but return as quickly as possible.\"\n\nHe stood for a few seconds like a man who is dazed.  It occurred\nto me that it might have come into his mind with Marnham's death\nthat he had lost his hold over Heda.  But if so he said nothing\nof it, but only asked--\n\n\"Will you go instead of me?\"\n\n\"On the whole I think not,\" I replied, \"and if I did, the story I\nshould have to tell might not tend to your advantage.\"\n\n\"That's true, damn you!\" he exclaimed and left the room.\n\nTen minutes later he was galloping towards Pilgrim's Rest.\nBefore I departed from the death chamber I examined the place\ncarefully to see if I could find any poison or other deadly\nthing, but without success.  One thing I did discover, however.\nTurning the leaf of a blotting-book that was by Marnham's elbow,\nI came upon a sheet of paper on which were written these words in\nhis hand, \"Greater love hath no man than this--\" that was all.\n\nEither he had forgotten the end of the quotation or changed his\nmind, or was unable through weakness to finish the sentence.\nThis paper also I put in my pocket.  Bolting the shutters and\nlocking the door I returned to the stoep, where I was alone, for\nas yet no one else was stirring.  Then I remembered the letter in\nmy pocket and opened it.  It ran--\n\n\n\"Dear Mr. Quatermain,--\n\n\"I have remembered that those who quarrel with Dr. Rodd are apt\nto die soon and suddenly; at any rate life at my age is always\nuncertain.  Therefore, as I know you to be an honest man, I am\nenclosing my will that it may be in safe keeping and purpose to\nsend it to your room to-morrow morning.  Perhaps when you return\nto Pretoria you will deposit it in the Standard Bank there, and\nif I am still alive, forward me the receipt.  You will see that I\nleave everything to my daughter whom I dearly love, and that\nthere is enough to keep the wolf from her door, besides my share\nin this property, if it is ever realized.\n\n\"After all that has passed to-night I do not feel up to writing a\nlong letter, so\n\n\"Remain sincerely yours,\n\n\"H. A. Marnham.\"\n\n\n\"PS.--I should like to state clearly upon paper that my earnest\nhope and wish are that Heda may get clear of that black-hearted,\nmurderous, scoundrel Rodd and marry Mr. Anscombe, whom I like and\nwho, I am sure, would make her a good husband.\"\n\n\nThinking to myself this did not look very like the letter of a\nsuicide, I glanced through the will, as the testator seemed to\nhave wished that I should do so.  It was short, but properly\ndrawn, signed, and witnessed, and bequeathed a sum of #9,000,\nwhich was on deposit at the Standard Bank, together with all his\nother property, real and personal, to Heda for her own sole use,\nfree from the debts and engagements of her husband, should she\nmarry.  Also she was forbidden to spend more than #1,000 of the\ncapital.  In short the money was strictly tied up.  With the will\nwere some other papers that apparently referred to certain\nproperty in Hungary to which Heda might become entitled, but\nabout these I did not trouble.\n\nReplacing these documents in a safe inner pocket in the lining of\nmy waistcoat, I went into our room and woke up Anscombe who was\nsleeping soundly, a fact that caused an unreasonable irritation\nin my mind.  When at length he was thoroughly aroused I said to\nhim--\n\n\"You are in luck's way, my friend.  Marnham is dead.\"\n\n\"Oh! poor Heda,\" he exclaimed, \"she loved him.  It will half\nbreak her heart.\"\n\n\"If it breaks half of her heart,\" I replied, \"it will mend the\nother half, for now her filial affection can't force her to marry\nRodd, and that is where you are in luck's way.\"\n\nThen I told him all the story.\n\n\"Was he murdered or did he commit suicide?\" he asked when I had\nfinished.\n\n\"I don't know, and to tell you the truth I don't want to know;\nnor will you if you are wise, unless knowledge is forced upon\nyou.  It is enough that he is dead, and for his daughter's sake\nthe less the circumstances of his end are examined into the\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Poor Heda!\" he said again, \"who will tell her?  I can't.  _You_\nfound him, Allan.\"\n\n\"I expected that job would be my share of the business, Anscombe.\nWell, the sooner it is over the better.  Now dress yourself and\ncome on to the stoep.\"\n\nThen I left him and next minute met Heda's fat, half-breed maid,\na stupid but good sort of a woman who was called Kaatje, emerging\nfrom her mistress's room with a jug, to fetch hot water, I\nsuppose.\n\n\"Kaatje,\" I said, \"go back and tell the Missie Heda that I want\nto speak to her as soon as I can.  Never mind the hot water, but\nstop and help her to dress.\"\n\nShe began to grumble a little in a good-natured way, but\nsomething in my eye stopped her and she went back into the room.\nTen minutes later Heda was by my side.\n\n\"What is it, Mr. Quatermain?\" she asked.  \"I feel sure that\nsomething dreadful has happened.\"\n\n\"It has, my dear,\" I answered, \"that is, if death is dreadful.\nYour father died last night.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she said, \"oh!\" and sank back on to the seat.\n\n\"Bear up,\" I went on, \"we must all die one day, and he had\nreached the full age of man.\"\n\n\"But I loved him,\" she moaned.  \"He had many faults I know, still\nI loved him.\"\n\n\"It is the lot of life, Heda, that we should lose what we love.\nBe thankful, therefore, that you have some one left to love.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank God! that's true.  If it had been him--no, it's\nwicked to say that.\"\n\nThen I told her the story, and while I was doing so, Anscombe\njoined us, walking by aid of his stick.  Also I showed them both\nMarnham's letter to me and the will, but the other bit of paper I\ndid not speak of or show.\n\nShe sat very pale and quiet and listened till I had done.  Then\nshe said--\n\n\"I should like to see him.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is as well,\" I answered.  \"If you can bear it, come\nat once, and do you come also, Anscombe.\"\n\nWe went to the room, Anscombe and Heda holding each other by the\nhand.  I unlocked the door and, entering, threw open a shutter.\nThere sat the dead man as I had left him, only his head had\nfallen over a little.  She gazed at him, trembling, then advanced\nand kissed his cold forehead, muttering,\n\n\"Good-bye, father.  Oh! good-bye, father.\"\n\nA thought struck me, and I asked--\n\n\"Is there any place here where your father locked up things? As I\nhave shown you, you are his heiress, and if so it might be as\nwell in this house that you should possess yourself of his\nproperty.\"\n\n\"There is a safe in the corner,\" she answered, \"of which he\nalways kept the key in his trouser pocket.\"\n\n\"Then with your leave I will open it in your presence.\"\n\nGoing to the dead man I searched his pocket and found in it a\nbunch of keys.  These I withdrew and went to the safe over which\na skin rug was thrown.  I unlocked it easily enough.  Within were\ntwo bags of gold, each marked #100; also another larger bag\nmarked \"My wife's jewelry.  For Heda\"; also some papers and a\nminiature of the lady whose portrait hung in the sitting-room;\nalso some loose gold.\n\n\"Now who will take charge of these?\" I asked.  \"I do not think it\nsafe to leave them here.\"\n\n\"You, of course,\" said Anscombe, while Heda nodded.\n\nSo with a groan I consigned all these valuables to my capacious\npockets.  Then I locked up the empty safe, replaced the keys\nwhere I had found them on Marnham, fastened the shutter and left\nthe room with Anscombe, waiting for a while outside till Heda\njoined us, sobbing a little.  After this we got something to eat,\ninsisting on Heda doing the same.\n\nOn leaving the table I saw a curious sight, namely, the patients\nwhom Rodd was attending in the little hospital of which I have\nspoken, departing towards the bush-veld, those of them who could\nwalk well and the attendants assisting the others.  They were\nalready some distance away, too far indeed for me to follow, as I\ndid not wish to leave the house.  The incident filled me with\nsuspicion, and I went round to the back to make inquiries, but\ncould find no one.  As I passed the hospital door, however, I\nheard a voice calling in Sisutu--\n\n\"Do not leave me behind, my brothers.\"\n\nI entered and saw the man on whom Rodd had operated the day of\nour arrival, lying in bed and quite alone.  I asked him where the\nothers had gone.  At first he would not answer, but when I\npretended to leave him, called out that it was back to their own\ncountry.  Finally, to cut the story short, I extracted from him\nthat they had left because they had news that the Temple was\ngoing to be attacked by Sekukuni and did not wish to be here when\nI and Anscombe were killed.  How the news reached him he refused,\nor could not, say; nor did he seem to know anything of the death\nof Marnham.  When I pressed him on the former point, he only\ngroaned and cried for water, for he was in pain and thirsty.  I\nasked him who had told Sekukuni's people to kill us, but he\nrefused to speak.\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, \"then you shall lie here alone and die of\nthirst,\" and again I turned towards the door.\n\nAt this he cried out--\n\n\"I will tell you.  It was the white medicine-man who lives here;\nhe who cut me open.  He arranged it all a few days ago because he\nhates you.  Last night he rode to tell the impi when to come.\"\n\n\"When is it to come?\" I asked, holding the jug of water towards\nhim.\n\n\"To-night at the rising of the moon, so that it may get far away\nbefore the dawn.  My people are thirsty for your blood and for\nthat of the other white chief, because you killed so many of them\nby the river.  The others they will not harm.\"\n\n\"How did you learn all this?\" I asked him again, but without\nresult, for he became incoherent and only muttered something\nabout being left alone because the others could not carry him.\nSo I gave him some water, after which he fell asleep, or\npretended to do so, and I left him, wondering whether he was\ndelirious, or spoke truth.  As I passed the stables I saw that my\nown horse was there, for in this district horses are always shut\nup at night to keep them from catching sickness, but that the\nfour beasts that had brought Heda from Natal in the Cape cart\nwere gone, though it was evident that they had been kraaled here\ntill within an hour or two.  I threw my horse a bundle of forage\nand returned to the house by the back entrance.  The kitchen was\nempty, but crouched by the door of Marnham's room sat the boy who\nhad found him dead.  He had been attached to his master and\nseemed half dazed.  I asked him where the other servants were, to\nwhich he replied that they had all run away.  Then I asked him\nwhere the horses were.  He answered that the Baas Rodd had\nordered them to be turned out before he rode off that morning.  I\nbade him accompany me to the stoep, as I dared not let him out of\nmy sight, which he did unwillingly enough.\n\nThere I found Anscombe and Heda.  They were seated side by side\nupon the couch.  Tears were running down her face and he, looking\nvery troubled, held her by the hand.  Somehow that picture of\nHeda has always remained fixed in my mind.  Sorrow becomes some\nwomen and she was one of them.  Her beautiful dark grey eyes did\nnot grow red with weeping; the tears just welled up in them and\nfell like dewdrops from the heart of a flower.\n\nShe sat very upright and very still, as he did, looking straight\nin front of her, while a ray of sunshine, falling on her head,\nshowed the chestnut-hued lights in her waving hair, of which she\nhad a great abundance.\n\nIndeed the pair of them, thus seated side by side, reminded me of\nan engraving I had seen somewhere of the statues of a husband and\nwife in an old Egyptian tomb.  With just such a look did the\nwoman of thousands of years ago sit gazing in patient hope into\nthe darkness of the future.  Death had made her sad, but it was\ngone by, and the little wistful smile about her lips seemed to\nsuggest that in this darkness her sorrowful eyes already saw the\nstirring of the new life to be.  Moreover, was not the man she\nloved the companion of her hopes as he had been of her woes.\nSuch was the fanciful thought that sprang up in my mind, even in\nthe midst of those great anxieties, like a single flower in a\nstony wilderness of thorns or one star on the blackness of the\nnight.\n\nIn a moment it had gone and I was telling them of what I had\nlearned.  They listened till I had finished.  Then Anscombe said\nslowly--\n\n\"Two of us can't hold this house against an impi.  We must get\nout of it.\"\n\n\"Both your conclusions seem quite sound,\" I remarked, \"that is if\nyonder old Kaffir is telling the truth.  But the question\nis--how?  We can't all three of us ride on one nag, as you are\nstill a cripple.\"\n\n\"There is the Cape cart,\" suggested Heda.\n\n\"Yes, but the horses have been turned out, and I don't know where\nto look for them.  Nor dare I send that boy alone, for probably\nhe would bolt like the others.  I think that you had better get\non my horse and ride for it, leaving us to take our chance.  I\ndaresay the whole thing is a lie and that we shall be in no\ndanger,\" I added by way of softening the suggestion.\n\n\"That I will never do,\" she replied with so much quiet conviction\nthat I saw it was useless to pursue the argument.\n\nI thought for a moment, as the position was very difficult.  The\nboy was not to be trusted, and if I went with him I should be\nleaving these two alone and, in Anscombe's state, almost\ndefenceless.  Still it seemed as though I must.  Just then I\nlooked up, and there at the garden gate saw Anscombe's driver,\nFootsack, the man whom I had despatched to Pretoria to fetch his\noxen.  I noted that he looked frightened and was breathless, for\nhis eyes started out of his head.  Also his hat was gone and he\nbled a little from his face.\n\nSeeing us he ran up the path and sat down as though he were\ntired.\n\n\"Where are the oxen?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh! Baas,\" he answered, \"the Basutos have got them.  We heard\nfrom an old black woman that Sekukuni had an impi out, so we\nwaited on the top of that hill about an hour's ride away to see\nif it was true.  Then suddenly the doctor Baas appeared riding,\nand I ran out and asked him if it were safe to go on.  He knew me\nagain and answered--\n\n\"'Yes, quite safe, for have I not just ridden this road without\nmeeting so much as a black child.  Go on, man; your masters will\nbe glad to have their oxen, as they wish to trek, or will by\nnightfall.'  Then he laughed and rode away.\n\n\"So we went on, driving the oxen.  But when we came to the belt\nof thorns at the bottom of the hill, we found that the doctor\nBaas had either lied to us or he had not seen.  For there\nsuddenly the tall grass on either side of the path grew spears;\nyes, everywhere were spears.  In a minute the two voorloopers\nwere assegaied.  As for me, I ran forward, not back, since the\nKaffirs were behind me, across the path, Baas, driving off the\noxen.  They sprang at me, but I jumped this way and that way and\navoided them.  Then they threw assegais--see, one of them cut my\ncheek, but the rest missed.  They had guns in their hands also,\nbut none shot.  I think they did not wish to make a noise.  Only\none of them shouted after me--\n\n\"'Tell Macumazahn that we are going to call on him tonight when\nhe cannot see to shoot.  We have a message for him from our\nbrothers whom he killed at the drift of the Oliphant's River.'\n\n\"Then I ran on here without stopping, but I saw no more Kaffirs.\nThat is all, Baas.\"\n\nNow I did not delay to cross-examine the man or to sift the true\nfrom the false in his story, since it was clear to me that he had\nrun into a company of Basutos, or rather been beguiled thereto by\nRodd, and lost our cattle, also his companions, who were either\nkilled as he said, or had escaped some other way.\n\n\"Listen, man,\" I said.  \"I am going to fetch some horses.  Do you\nstay here and help the Missie to pack the cart and make the\nharness ready.  If you disobey me or run away, then I will find\nyou and you will never run again.  Do you understand?\"\n\nHe vowed that he did and went to get some water, while I\nexplained everything to Anscombe and Heda, pointing out that all\nthe information we could gather seemed to show that no attack was\nto be made upon the house before nightfall, and that therefore we\nhad the day before us.  As this was so I proposed to go to look\nfor the horses myself, since otherwise I was sure we should never\nfind them.  Meanwhile Heda must pack and make ready the cart with\nthe help of Footsack, Anscombe superintending everything, as he\ncould very well do since he was now able to walk leaning on a\nstick.\n\nOf course neither of them liked my leaving them, but in view of\nour necessities they raised no objection.  So off I went, taking\nthe boy with me.  He did not want to go, being, as I have said,\nhalf dazed with grief or fear, or both, but when I had pointed\nout to him clearly that I was quite prepared to shoot him if he\nplayed tricks, he changed his mind.  Having saddled my mare that\nwas now fresh and fat, we started, the boy guiding me to a\ncertain kloof at the foot of which there was a small plain of\ngood grass where he said the horses were accustomed to graze.\n\nHere sure enough we found two of them, and as they had been\nturned out with their headstalls on, were able to tie them to\ntrees with the riems which were attached to the headstalls.  But\nthe others were not there, and as two horses could not drag a\nheavy Cape cart, I was obliged to continue the search.  Oh! what\na hunt those beasts gave me.  Finding themselves free, for as\nRodd's object was that they should stray, he had ordered the\nstable-boy not to kneel-halter them, after filling themselves\nwith grass they had started off for the farm where they were\nbred, which, it seemed, was about fifty miles away, grazing as\nthey went.  Of course I did not know this at the time, so for\nseveral hours I rode up and down the neighbouring kloofs, as the\nground was too hard for me to hope to follow them by their spoor.\n\nIt occurred to me to ask the boy where the horses came from, a\nquestion that he happened to be able to answer, as he had brought\nthem home when they were bought the year before.  Having learned\nin what direction the place lay I rode for it at an angle, or\nrather for the path that led to it, making the boy run alongside,\nholding to my stirrup leather.  About three o'clock in the\nafternoon I struck this path, or rather track, at a point ten or\ntwelve miles away from the Temple, and there, just mounting a\nrise, met the two horses quietly walking towards me.  Had I been\na quarter of an hour later they would have passed and vanished\ninto a sea of thorn-veld.  We caught them without trouble and\nonce more headed homewards, leading them by their riems.\n\nReaching the glade where the other two were tied up, we collected\nthem also and returned to the house, where we arrived at five\no'clock.  As everything seemed quiet I put my mare into the\nstable, slipped its bit and gave it some forage.  Then I went\nround the house, and to my great joy found Anscombe and Heda\nwaiting anxiously, but with nothing to report, and with them\nFootsack.  Very hastily I swallowed some food, while Footsack\ninspanned the horses.  In a quarter of an hour all was ready.\nThen suddenly, in an inconsequent female fashion, Heda developed\na dislike to leaving her father unburied.\n\n\"My dear young lady,\" I said, \"it seems that you must choose\nbetween that and our all stopping to be buried with him.\"\n\nShe saw the point and compromised upon paying him a visit of\nfarewell, which I left her to do in Anscombe's company, while I\nfetched my mare.  To tell the truth I felt as though I had seen\nenough of the unhappy Marnham, and not for #50 would I have\nentered that room again.  As I passed the door of the hospital,\nleading my horse, I heard the old Kaffir screaming within and\nsent the boy who was with me to find out what was the matter with\nhim.  That was the last I saw of either of them, or ever shall\nsee this side of kingdom come.  I wonder what became of them?\n\nWhen I got back to the front of the house I found the cart\nstanding ready at the gate, Footsack at the head of the horses\nand Heda with Anscombe at her side.  It had been neatly packed\nduring the day by Heda with such of her and our belongings as it\nwould hold, including our arms and ammunition.  The rest, of\ncourse, we were obliged to abandon.  Also there were two baskets\nfull of food, some bottles of brandy and a good supply of\novercoats and wraps.  I told Footsack to take the reins, as I\nknew him to be a good driver, and helped Anscombe to a seat at\nhis side, while Heda and the maid Kaatje got in behind in order\nto balance the vehicle.  I determined to ride, at any rate for\nthe present.\n\n\"Which way, Baas?\" asked Footsack.\n\n\"Down to the Granite Stream where the wagon stands,\" I answered.\n\n\"That will be through the Yellow-wood Swamp.  Can't we take the\nother road to Pilgrim's Rest and Lydenburg, or to Barberton?\"\nasked Anscombe in a vague way, and as I thought, rather\nnervously.\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"that is unless you wish to meet those Basutos\nwho stole the oxen and Dr. Rodd returning, if he means to\nreturn.\"\n\n\"Oh! let us go through the Yellow-wood,\" exclaimed Heda, who, I\nthink, would rather have met the devil than Dr. Rodd.\n\nAh! if I had but known that we were heading straight for that\nperson, sooner would I have faced the Basutos twice over.  But I\ndid what seemed wisest, thinking that he would be sure to return\nwith another doctor or a magistrate by the shorter and easier\npath which he had followed in the morning.  It just shows once\nmore how useless are all our care and foresight, or how strong is\nFate, have it which way you will.\n\nSo we started down the slope, and I, riding behind, noted poor\nHeda staring at the marble house, which grew ever more beautiful\nas it receded and the roughness of its building disappeared,\nespecially at that part of it which hid the body of her old scamp\nof a father whom still she loved.  We came down to the glen and\nonce more saw the bones of the blue wildebeeste that we had\nshot--oh! years and years ago, or so it seemed.  Then we struck\nout for the Granite Stream.\n\nBefore we reached the patch of Yellow-wood forest where I knew\nthat the cart must travel very slowly because of the trees and\nthe swampy nature of the ground, I pushed on ahead to\nreconnoitre, fearing lest there might be Basutos hidden in this\ncover.  Riding straight through it I went as far as the deserted\nwagon at a sharp canter, seeing nothing and no one.  Once indeed,\ntowards the end of the wood where it was more dense, I thought\nthat I heard a man cough and peered about me through the gloom,\nfor here the rays of the sun, which was getting low in the\nheavens, scarcely penetrated.  As I could perceive no one I came\nto the conclusion that I must have been deceived by my fancy.  Or\nperhaps it was some baboon that coughed, though it was strange\nthat a baboon should have come to such a low-lying spot where\nthere was nothing for it to eat.\n\nThe place was eerie, so much so that I bethought me of tales of\nthe ghosts whereby it was supposed to be haunted.  Also, oddly\nenough, of Anscombe's presentiment which he had fulfilled by\nkilling a Basuto.  Look! There lay his grinning skull with some\npatches of hair still on it, dragged away from the rest of the\nbones by a hyena.  I cantered on down the slope beyond the wood\nand through the scattered thorns to the stream on the banks of\nwhich the wagon should be.  It had gone, and by the freshness of\nthe trail, within an hour or two.  A moment's reflection told me\nwhat had happened.  Having stolen our oxen the Basutos drove them\nto the wagon, inspanned them and departed with their loot.  On\nthe whole I was glad to see this, since it suggested that they\nhad retired towards their own country, leaving our road open.\n\nTurning my horse I rode back again to meet the cart.  As I\nreached the edge of the wood at the top of the slope I heard a\nwhistle blown, a very shrill whistle, of which the sound would\ntravel for a mile or two on that still air.  Also I heard the\nsound of men's voices in altercation and caught words, such\nas--\"Let go, or by Heaven--!\" then a furious laugh and other\nwords which seemed to be--\"In five minutes the Kaffirs will be\nhere.  In ten you will be dead.  Can I help it if they kill you\nafter I have warned you to turn back?\"  Then a woman's scream.\n\nRodd's voice, Anscombe's voice and Kaatje's scream--not Heda's\nbut Kaatje's!\n\nThen as I rode furiously round the last patch of intervening\ntrees the sound of a pistol shot.  I was out of them now and saw\neverything.  There was the cart on the further side of a swamp.\nThe horses were standing still and snorting.  Holding the rein of\none of the leaders was Rodd, whose horse also stood close by.  He\nwas rocking on his feet and as I leapt from my mare and ran up, I\nsaw his face.  It was horrible, full of pain and devilish rage.\nWith his disengaged hand he pointed to Anscombe sitting in the\ncart and grasping a pistol that still smoked.\n\n\"You've killed me,\" he said in a hoarse, choking voice, for he\nwas shot through the lung, \"to get her,\" and he waved his hand\ntowards Heda who was peering at him between the heads of the two\nmen.  \"You are a murderer, as her father was, and as David was\nbefore you.  Well, I hope you won't keep her long.  I hope you'll\ndie as I do and break her false heart, you damned thief.\"\n\nAll of this he said in a slow voice, pausing between the words\nand speaking ever more thickly as the blood from his wound choked\nhim.  Then of a sudden it burst in a stream from his lips, and\nstill pointing with an accusing finger at Anscombe, he fell\nbackwards into the slimy pool behind him and there vanished\nwithout a struggle.\n\nSo horrible was the sight that the driver, Footsack, leapt from\nthe cart, uttering a kind of low howl, ran to Rodd's horse,\nscrambled into the saddle and galloped off, striking it with his\nfist, where to I do not know.  Anscombe put his hand before his\neyes, Heda sank down on the seat in a heap, and the coloured\nwoman, Kaatje, beat her breast and said something in Dutch about\nbeing accursed or bewitched.  Luckily I kept my wits and went to\nthe horses' heads, fearing lest they should start and drag the\ntrap into the pool.  \"Wake up,\" I said.  \"That fellow has only\ngot what he deserved, and you were quite right to shoot him.\"\n\n\"I am glad you think so,\" answered Anscombe absently.  \"It was so\nlike murder.  Don't you remember I told you I should kill a man\nin this place and about a woman?\"\n\n\"I remember nothing,\" I answered boldly, \"except that if we stop\nhere much longer we shall have those Basutos on us.  That brute\nwas whistling to them and holding the horses till they came to\nkill us.  Pull yourself together, take the reins and follow me.\"\n\nHe obeyed, being a skilful whip enough who, as he informed me\nafterwards, had been accustomed to drive a four-in-hand at home.\nMounting my horse, which stood by, I guided the cart out of the\nwood and down the slope beyond, till at length we came to our old\noutspan where I proposed to turn on to the wagon track which ran\nto Pilgrim's Rest.  I say proposed, for when I looked up it I\nperceived about five hundred yards away a number of armed Basutos\nrunning towards us, the red light of the sunset shining on their\nspears.  Evidently the scout or spy to whom Rodd whistled, had\ncalled them out of their ambush which they had set for us on the\nPilgrim's Rest road in order that they might catch us if we tried\nto escape that way.\n\nNow there was only one thing to be done.  At this spot a native\ntrack ran across the little stream and up a steepish slope\nbeyond.  On the first occasion of our outspanning here I had the\ncuriosity to mount this slope, reflecting as I did so that\nalthough rough it would be quite practicable for a wagon.  At the\ntop of it I found a wide flat plain, almost high-veld, for the\nbushes were very few, across which the track ran on.  On\nsubsequent inquiry I discovered that it was one used by the\nSwazis and other natives when they made their raids upon the\nBasutos, or when bodies of them went to work in the mines.\n\n\"Follow me,\" I shouted and crossed the stream which was shallow\nbetween the little pools, then led the way up the stony slope.\nThe four horses negotiated it very well and the Cape cart, being\nsplendidly built, took no harm.  At the top I looked back and saw\nthat the Basutos were following us.\n\n\"Flog the horses!\" I cried to Anscombe, and off we went at a hand\ngallop along the native track, the cart swaying and bumping upon\nthe rough veld.  The sun was setting now, in half an hour it\nwould be quite dark.\n\nCould we keep ahead of them for that half hour?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\n\n\nFLIGHT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sun sank in a blaze of glory.  Looking back by the light of\nits last rays I saw a single native silhouetted against the red\nsky.  He was standing on a mound that we had passed a mile or\nmore behind us, doubtless waiting for his companions whom he had\noutrun.  So they had not given up the chase.  What was to be\ndone?  Once it was completely dark we could not go on.  We should\nlose our way; the horses would get into ant-bear holes and break\ntheir legs.  Perhaps we might become bogged in some hollow,\ntherefore we must wait till the moon rose, which would not be for\na couple of hours.\n\nMeanwhile those accursed Basutos would be following us even in\nthe dark.  This would hamper them, no doubt, but they would keep\nthe path, with which they were probably familiar, beneath their\nfeet, and what is more, the ground being soft with recent rain,\nthey could feel the wheel spoor with their fingers.  I looked\nabout me.  Just here another track started off in a nor'-westerly\ndirection from that which we were following.  Perhaps it ran to\nLydenburg; I do not know.  To our left, not more than a hundred\nyards or so away, the higher veld came to an end and sloped in an\neasterly direction down to bush-land below.\n\nShould I take the westerly road which ran over a great plain?\nNo, for then we might be seen for miles and cut off.  Moreover,\neven if we escaped the natives, was it desirable we should plunge\ninto civilization just now and tell all our story, as in that\ncase we must do.  Rodd's death was quite justified, but it had\nhappened on Transvaal territory and would require a deal of\nexplanation.  Fortunately there was no witness of it, except\nourselves.  Yes, there was though--the driver Footsack, if he had\ngot away, which, being mounted, would seem probable, a man who,\nfor my part, I would not trust for a moment.  It would be an ugly\nthing to see Anscombe in the dock charged with murder and\npossibly myself, with Footsack giving evidence against us before\na Boer jury who might be hard on Englishmen.  Also there was the\nbody with a bullet in it.\n\nSuddenly there came into my mind a recollection of the very vivid\ndream of Zikali which had visited me, and I reflected that in\nZululand there would be little need to trouble about the death of\nRodd.  But Zululand was a long way off, and if we were to avoid\nthe Transvaal, there was only one way of going there, namely\nthrough Swaziland.  Well, among the Swazis we should be quite\nsafe from the Basutos, since the two peoples were at fierce\nenmity.  Moreover I knew the Swazi chiefs and king very well,\nhaving traded there, and could explain that I came to collect\ndebts owing to me.\n\nThere was another difficulty.  I had heard that the trouble\nbetween the English Government and Cetewayo, the Zulu king, was\ncoming to a head, and that the High Commissioner, Sir Bartle\nFrere, talked of presenting him with an ultimatum.  It would be\nawkward if this arrived while we were in the country, though even\nso, being on such friendly terms with the Zulus of all classes, I\ndid not think that I, or any with me, would run great risks.\n\nAll these thoughts rushed through my brain while I considered\nwhat to do.  At the moment it was useless to ask the opinion of\nthe others who were but children in native matters.  I and I\nalone must take the responsibility and act, praying that I might\ndo so aright.  Another moment and I had made up my mind.\n\nSigning to Anscombe to follow me, I rode about a hundred yards or\nmore down the nor'-westerly path.  Then I turned sharply along a\nrather stony ridge of ground, the cart following me all the time,\nand came back across our own track, my object being of course\nto puzzle any Kaffirs who might spoor us.  Now we were on the\nedge of the gentle slope that led down to the bush-veld.  Over\nthis I rode towards a deserted cattle kraal built of stones, in\nthe rich soil of which grew sundry trees; doubtless one of those\nwhich had been abandoned when Mosilikatze swept all this country\non his way north about the year 1838.  The way to it was easy,\nsince the surrounding stones had been collected to build the\nkraal generations before.  As we passed over the edge of the\nslope in the gathering gloom, Heda cried--\n\n\"Look!\" and pointed in the direction whence we came.  Far away a\nsheet of flame shot upwards.\n\n\"The house is burning,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"it can be nothing else;\" adding to myself, \"a\ngood job too, for now there will be no postmortem on old\nMarnham.\"\n\nWho fired the place I never learnt.  It may have been the\nBasutos, or Marnham's body-servant, or Footsack, or a spark from\nthe kitchen fire.  At any rate it blazed merrily enough\nnotwithstanding the marble walls, as a wood-lined and thatched\nbuilding of course would do.  On the whole I suspected the boy,\nwho may very well have feared lest he should be accused of having\nhad a hand in his master's death.  At least it was gone, and\nwatching the distant flames I bethought me that with it went all\nHeda's past.  Twenty-four hours before her father was alive, the\nbondservant of Rodd and a criminal.  Now he was ashes and Rodd\nwas dead, while she and the man she loved were free, with all the\nworld before them.  I wished that I could have added that they\nwere safe.  Afterwards she told me that much the same ideas\npassed through her own mind.\n\nDismounting I led the horses into the old kraal through the gap\nin the wall which once had been the gateway.  It was a large\nkraal that probably in bygone days had held the cattle of some\nforgotten head chief whose town would have stood on the brow of\nthe rise; so large that notwithstanding the trees I have\nmentioned, there was plenty of room for the cart and horses in\nits centre.  Moreover, on such soil the grass grew so richly that\nafter we had slipped their bits, the horses were able to fill\nthemselves without being unharnessed.  Also a little stream from\na spring on the brow ran within a few yards whence, with the help\nof Kaatje, a strong woman, I watered them with the bucket which\nhung underneath the cart.  Next we drank ourselves and ate some\nfood in the darkness that was now complete.  Then leaving Kaatje\nto stand at the head of the horses in case they should attempt\nany sudden movement, I climbed into the cart, and we discussed\nthings in low whispers.\n\nIt was a curious debate in that intense gloom which, close as our\nfaces were together, prevented us from seeing anything of each\nother, except once when a sudden flare of summer lightning\nrevealed them, white and unnatural as those of ghosts.  On our\npresent dangers I did not dwell, putting them aside lightly,\nthough I knew they were not light.  But of the alternative as to\nwhether we should try to escape to Lydenburg and civilization, or\nto Zululand and savagery, I felt it to be my duty to speak.\n\n\"To put it plainly,\" said Anscombe in his slow way when I had\nfinished, \"you mean that in the Transvaal I might be tried as a\nmurderer and perhaps convicted, whereas if we vanish into\nZululand the probability is that this would not happen.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" I whispered back, \"that we might both be tried and, if\nFootsack should chance to appear and give evidence, find\nourselves in an awkward position.  Also there is another\nwitness--Kaatje, and for the matter of that, Heda herself.  Of\ncourse her evidence would be in our favour, but to make it\nunderstood by a jury she would have to explain a great deal of\nwhich she might prefer not to speak.  Further, at the best, the\nwhole business would get into the English papers, which you and\nyour relatives might think disagreeable, especially in view of\nthe fact that, as I understand, you and Heda intend to marry.\"\n\n\"Still I think that I would rather face it out,\" he said in his\noutspoken way, \"even if it should mean that I could never return\nto England.  After all, of what have I to be afraid?  I shot this\nscoundrel because I was obliged to do so.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it is of this that you may have to convince a jury who\nmight possibly find a motive in Rodd's past, and your present,\nrelationship to the same lady.  But what has she to say?\"\n\n\"I have to say,\" whispered Heda, \"that for myself I care nothing,\nbut that I could never bear to see all these stories about my\npoor father raked up.  Also there is Maurice to be considered.\nIt would be terrible if they put him in prison--or worse.  Let us\ngo to Zululand, Mr. Quatermain, and afterwards get out of Africa.\nDon't you agree, Maurice?\"\n\n\"What does Mr. Quatermain think himself?\" he answered.  \"He is\nthe oldest and by far the wisest of us and I will be guided by\nhim.\"\n\nNow I considered and said--\n\n\"There is such a thing as flying from present troubles to others\nthat may be worse, the 'ills we know not of.'  Zululand is\ndisturbed.  If war broke out there we might all be killed.  On\nthe other hand we might not, and it ought to be possible for you\nto work up to Delagoa Bay and there get some ship home, that is\nif you wish to keep clear of British law.  I cannot do so, as I\nmust stay in Africa.  Nor can I take the responsibility of\nsettling what you are to do, since if things went wrong, it would\nbe on my head.  However, if you decide for the Transvaal or Natal\nand we escape, I must tell you that I shall go to the first\nmagistrate we find and make a full deposition of all that has\nhappened.  It is not possible for me to live with the charge of\nhaving been concerned in the shooting of a white man hanging over\nme that might be brought up at any time, perhaps when no one was\nleft in the country to give evidence on my behalf, for then, even\nif I were acquitted my name would always be tarnished.  In\nZululand, on the other hand, there are no magistrates before whom\nI could depose, and if this business should come out, I can\nalways say that we went there to escape from the Basutos.  Now I\nam going to get down to see if the horses are all right.  Do you\ntwo talk the thing over and make up your minds.  Whatever you\nagree on, I shall accept and do my best to carry through.\"  Then,\nwithout waiting for an answer, I slipped from the cart.\n\nHaving examined the horses, who were cropping all the grass\nwithin reach of them, I crept to the wall of the kraal so as to\nbe quite out of earshot.  The night was now pitch dark, dark as\nit only knows how to be in Africa.  More, a thunderstorm was\ncoming up of which that flash of sheet lightning had been a\npresage.  The air was electric.  From the vast bush-clad valley\nbeneath us came a wild, moaning sound caused, I suppose, by wind\namong the trees, though here I felt none; far away a sudden spear\nof lightning stabbed the sky.  The brooding trouble of nature\nspread to my own heart.  I was afraid, and not of our present\ndangers, though these were real enough, so real that in a few\nhours we might all be dead.\n\nTo dangers I was accustomed; for years they had been my daily\nfood by day and by night, and, as I think I have said elsewhere,\nI am a fatalist, one who knows full well that when God wants me\nHe will take me; that is if He can want such a poor, erring\ncreature.  Nothing that I did or left undone could postpone or\nhasten His summons for a moment, though of course I knew it to be\nmy duty to fight against death and to avoid it for as long as I\nmight, because that I should do so was a portion of His plan.\nFor we are all part of a great pattern, and the continuance or\ncessation of our lives re-acts upon other lives, and therefore\nlife is a trust.\n\nNo, it was of greater things that I felt afraid, things terrible\nand imminent which I could not grasp and much less understand.  I\nunderstand them now, but who would have guessed that on the issue\nof that whispered colloquy in the cart behind me, depended the\nfate of a people and many thousands of lives?  As I was to learn\nin days to come, if Anscombe and Heda had determined upon heading\nfor the Transvaal, there would, as I believe, have been no Zulu\nwar, which in its turn meant that there would have been no Boer\nRebellion and that the mysterious course of history would have\nbeen changed.\n\nI shook myself together and returned to the cart.\n\n\"Well,\" I whispered, but there was no answer.  A moment later\nthere came another flash of lightning.\n\n\"There,\" said Heda, \"how many do you make it?\n\n\"Ninety-eight,\" he answered.\n\n\"I counted ninety-nine,\" she said, \"but anyway it was within the\nhundred.  Mr. Quatermain, we will go to Zululand, if you please,\nif you will show us the way there.\"\n\n\"Right,\"  I answered, \"but might I ask what that has to do with\nyour both counting a hundred?\"\n\n\"Only this,\" she said, \"we could not make up our minds.  Maurice\nwas for the Transvaal, I was for Zululand.  So you see we agreed\nthat if another flash came before we counted a hundred, we would\ngo to Zululand, and if it didn't, to Pretoria.  A very good way\nof settling, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" I replied, \"quite excellent for those who could\nthink of such a thing.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact I don't know which of them thought of it\nbecause I never inquired.  But I did remember afterwards how\nAnscombe had tossed with a lucky penny when it was a question\nwhether we should or should not run for the wagon during our\ndifficulty by the Oliphant's River; also when I asked him the\nreason for this strange proceeding he answered that Providence\nmight inhabit a penny as well as anything else, and that he\nwished to give it--I mean Providence--a chance.  How much more\nthen, he may have argued, could it inhabit a flash of lightning\nwhich has always been considered a divine manifestation from the\ntime of the Roman Jove, and no doubt far before him.\n\nForty or fifty generations ago, which is not long, our ancestors\nset great store by the behaviour of lightning and thunder, and\ndoubtless the instinct is still in our blood, in the same way\nthat all our existing superstitions about the moon come down to\nus from the time when our forefathers worshipped her.  They did\nthis for tens of hundreds or thousands of years, and can we\nexpect a few coatings of the veneer that we politely call\ncivilization, which after all is only one of our conventions that\nvanish in any human stress such as war, to kill out the human\nimpulse it seems to hide?  I do not know, though I have my own\nopinion, and probably these young people never reasoned the\nmatter out.  They just acted on an intuition as ancient as that\nwhich had attracted them to each other, namely a desire to\nconsult the ruling fates by omens or symbols.  Or perhaps\nAnscombe thought that as his experience with the penny had proved\nso successful, he would give Providence another \"chance.\"  If so\nit took it and no mistake.  Confound it! I don't know what he\nthought; I only dwell on the matter because of the great results\nwhich followed this consultation of the Sybilline books of\nheaven.\n\nAs it happened my speculations, if I really indulged in any at\nthat time, were suddenly extinguished by the bursting of the\nstorm.  It was of the usual character, short but very violent.\nOf a sudden the sky became alive with lightnings and the\natmosphere with the roar of winds.  One flash struck a tree quite\nnear the kraal, and I saw that tree seem to melt in its fiery\nembrace, while about where it had been, rose a column of dust\nfrom the ground beneath.  The horses were so frightened that\nluckily they stood quite quiet, as I have often known animals to\ndo in such circumstances.  Then came the rain, a torrential rain\nas I, who was out in it holding the horses, became painfully\naware.  It thinned after a while, however, as the storm rolled\naway.\n\nSuddenly in a silence between the tremendous echoes of the\npassing thunder I thought that I heard voices somewhere on the\nbrow of the slope, and as the horses were now quite calm, I crept\nthrough the trees to that part of the enclosure which I judged to\nbe nearest to them.\n\nVoices they were sure enough, and of the Basutos who were\npursuing us.  What was more, they were coming down the slope.\nThe top of the old wall reached almost to my chin.  Taking off my\nhat I thrust my head forward between two loose stones, that I\nmight hear the better.\n\nThe men were talking together in Sisutu.  One, whom I took to be\ntheir captain, said to the others--\n\n\"That white-headed old jackal, Macumazahn, has given us the slip\nagain.  He doubled on his tracks and drove the horses down the\nhillside to the lower path in the valley.  I could feel where the\nwheels went over the edge.\"\n\n\"It is so, Father,\" answered another voice, \"but we shall catch\nhim and the others at the bottom if we get there before the moon\nrises, since they cannot have moved far in this rain and\ndarkness.  Let me go first and guide you who know every tree and\nstone upon this slope where I used to herd cattle when I was a\nchild.\"\n\n\"Do so,\" said the captain.  \"I can see nothing now the lightning\nhas gone, and were it not that I have sworn to dip my spear in\nthe blood of Macumazahn who has fooled us again, I would give up\nthe hunt.\"\n\n\"I think it would be better to give it up in any case,\" said a\nthird voice, \"since it is known throughout the land that no luck\nhas ever come to those who tried to trap the Watcher-by-Night.\nOh! he is a leopard who springs and is gone again.  How many are\nthe throats in which his fangs have met.  Leave him alone, I say,\nlest our fate should be that of the white doctor in the\nYellow-wood Swamp, he who set us on this hunt.  We have his wagon\nand his cattle; let us be satisfied.\"\n\n\"I will leave him alone when he sleeps for the last time, and not\nbefore,\" answered the captain, \"he who shot my brother in the\ndrift the other day.  What would Sekukuni say if we let him\nescape to bring the Swazis on us?  Moreover, we want that white\nmaiden for a hostage in case the English should attack us again.\nCome, you who know the road, and lead us.\"\n\nThere was some disturbance as this man passed to the front.  Then\nI heard the line move forward.  Presently they were going by the\nwall within a foot or two of me.  Indeed by ill-luck just as we\nwere opposite to each other the captain stumbled and fell against\nthe wall.\n\n\"There is an old cattle kraal here,\" he said.  \"What if those\nwhite rats have hidden in it?\"\n\nI trembled as I heard the words.  If a horse should neigh or make\nany noise that could be heard above the hiss of the rain! I did\nnot dare to move for fear lest I should betray myself.  There I\nstood so close to the Kaffirs that I could smell them and hear\nthe rain pattering on their bodies.  Only very stealthily I drew\nmy hunting knife with my right hand.  At that moment the\nlightning, which I thought had quite gone by, flashed again for\nthe last time, revealing the fat face of the Basuto captain\nwithin a foot of my own, for he was turned towards the wall on\nwhich one of his hands rested.  Moreover, the blue and ghastly\nlight revealed mine to him thrust forward between the two stones,\nmy eyes glaring at him.\n\n\"The head of a dead man is set upon the wall!\" he cried in\nterror.  \"It is the ghost of--\"\n\nHe got no further, for as the last word passed his lips I drove\nthe knife at him with all my strength deep into his throat.  He\nfell back into the arms of his followers, and next instant I\nheard the sound of many feet rushing in terror down the hill.\nWhat became of him I do not know, but if he still lives, probably\nhe agrees with his tribesman that Macumazahn--Watcher-by-Night,\nor his ghost \"is a leopard who springs and kills and is gone\nagain\"; also, that those who try to trap him meet with no luck.\nI say, or his ghost--because I am sure he thought that I was a\nspirit of the dead; doubtless I must have looked like one with my\nwhite, rain-drowned face appearing there between the stones and\nmade ghastly and livid by the lightning.\n\nWell, they had gone, the whole band of them, not less than thirty\nor forty men, so I went also, back to the cart where I found the\nothers very comfortable indeed beneath the rainproof tilt.\nSaying nothing of what had happened, of which they were as\ninnocent as babes, I took a stiff tot of brandy, for I was\nchilled through by the wet, and while waiting for the moon to\nrise, busied myself with getting the bits back into the horses'\nmouths--an awkward job in the dark.  At length it appeared in a\nclear sky, for the storm had quite departed and the rain ceased.\nAs soon as there was light enough I took the near leader by the\nbridle and led the cart to the brow of the hill, which was not\neasy under the conditions, making Kaatje follow with my horse.\n\nThen, as there were no signs of any Basutos, we started on again,\nI riding about a hundred yards ahead, keeping a sharp look-out\nfor a possible ambush.  Fortunately, however, the veld was bare\nand open, consisting of long waves of ground.  One start I did\nget, thinking that I saw men's heads just on the crest of a wave,\nwhich turned out to be only a herd of springbuck feeding among\nthe tussocks of grass.  I was very glad to see them, since their\npresence assured me that no human being had recently passed that\nway.\n\nAll night long we trekked, following the Kaffir path for as long\nas I could see it, and after that going by my compass.  I knew\nwhereabouts the drift of the Crocodile River should be, as I had\ncrossed it twice before in my life, and kept my eyes open for a\ncertain tall koppie which stood within half a mile it on the Swazi\nside of the river.  Ultimately to my joy I caught sight of this hill\nfaintly outlined against the sky and headed for it.  Half a mile\nfurther on I struck a wagon-track made by Boers trekking into\nSwazi-Land to trade or shoot.  Then I knew that the drift was\nstraight ahead of us, and called to Anscombe to flog up the\nweary horses.\n\nWe reached the river just before the dawn.  To my horror it was\nvery full, so full that the drift looked dangerous, for it had\nbeen swollen by the thunder-rain of the previous night.  Indeed\nsome wandering Swazis on the further bank shouted to us that we\nshould be drowned if we tried to cross.\n\n\"Which means that the only thing to do is to stay until the water\nruns down,\" I said to Anscombe, for the two women, tired out,\nwere asleep.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" he answered, \"unless those Basutos--\"\n\nI looked back up the long slope down which we had come and saw no\none.  Then I raised myself in my stirrups and looked along\nanother track that joined the road just here, leading from the\nbush-veld, as ours led from the high-veld.  The sun was rising\nnow, dispersing the mist that hung about the trees after the wet.\nSearching among these with my eyes, presently I perceived the\nlight gleaming upon what I knew must be the points of spears\nprojecting above the level of the ground vapour.\n\n\"Those devils are after us by the lower road,\" I said to\nAnscombe, adding, \"I heard them pass the old cattle kraal last\nnight.  They followed our spoor over the edge of the hill, but in\nthe dark lost it among the stones.\"\n\nHe whistled and asked what was to be done.\n\n\"That is for you to decide,\" I answered.  \"For my part I'd rather\nrisk the river than the Basutos,\" and I looked at the slumbering\nHeda.\n\n\"Can we bolt back the way we came, Allan?\"\n\n\"The horses are very spent and we might meet more Basutos,\" and\nagain I looked at Heda.\n\n\"A hard choice, Allan.  It is wonderful how women complicate\neverything in life, because they are life, I suppose.\"  He\nthought a moment and went on, \"Let's try the river.  If we fail,\nit will be soon over, and it is better to drown than be speared.\"\n\n\"Or be kept alive by savages who hate us,\" I exclaimed, with my\neyes still fixed upon Heda.\n\nThen I got to business.  There were hide riems on the bridles of\nthe leaders.  I undid these and knotted their loose ends firmly\ntogether.  To them I made fast the riem of my own mare, slipping\na loop I tied in it, over my right hand and saying--\n\n\"Now I will go first, leading the horses.  Do you drive after me\nfor all you are worth, even if they are swept off their feet.  I\ncan trust my beast to swim straight, and being a mare, I hope\nthat the horses will follow her as they have done all night.\nWake up Heda and Kaatje.\"\n\nHe nodded, and looking very pale, said--\n\n\"Heda my dear, I am sorry to disturb you, but we have to get over\na river with a rough bottom, so you and Kaatje must hang on and\nsit tight.  Don't be frightened, you are as safe as a church.\"\n\n\"God forgive him for that lie,\" thought I to myself as, having\ntightened the girths, I mounted my mare.  Then gripping the riem\nI kicked the beast to a canter, Anscombe flogging up the team as\nwe swung down the bank to the edge of the foaming torrent, on the\nfurther side of which the Swazis shouted and gesticulated to us\nto go back.\n\nWe were in it now, for, as I had hoped, the horses followed the\nmare without hesitation.  For the first twenty yards or so all\nwent well, I heading up the stream.  Then suddenly I felt that\nthe mare was swimming.\n\n\"Flog the horses and don't let them turn,\" I shouted to Anscombe.\n\nTen more yards and I glanced over my shoulder.  The team was\nswimming also, and behind them the cart rocked and bobbed like a\nboat swinging in a heavy sea.  There came a strain on the riem;\nthe leaders were trying to turn! I pulled hard and encouraged\nthem with my voice, while Anscombe, who drove splendidly, kept\ntheir heads as straight as he could.  Mercifully they came round\nagain and struck out for the further shore, the water-logged cart\nfloating after them.  Would it turn over? That was the question\nin my mind.  Five seconds; ten seconds and it was still upright.\nOh! it was going.  No, a fierce back eddy caught it and set it\nstraight again.  My mare touched bottom and there was hope.  It\nstruggled forward, being swept down the stream all the time.  Now\nthe horses in the cart also found their footing and we were\nsaved.\n\nNo, the wet had caused the knot of one of the riems to slip\nbeneath the strain, or perhaps it broke--I don't know.  Feeling\nthe pull slacken the leaders whipped round on to the wheelers.\nThere they all stood in a heap, their heads and part of their\nnecks above water, while the cart floated behind them on its\nside.  Kaatje screamed and Anscombe flogged.  I leapt from my\nmare and struggled to the leaders, the water up to my chin.\nGrasping their bits I managed to keep them from turning further.\nBut I could do no more and death came very near to us.  Had it\nnot been for some of those brave Swazis on the bank it would have\nfound us, every one.  But they plunged in, eight of them, holding\neach other's hands, and half-swimming, half-wading, reached us.\nThey got the horses by the head and straightened them out, while\nAnscombe plied his whip.  A dash forward and the wheels were on\nthe bottom again.\n\nThree minutes later we were safe on the further bank, which my\nmare had already reached, where I lay gasping on my face,\nejaculating prayers of thankfulness and spitting out muddy water.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\n\n\nNOMBE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Swazis, shivering, for all these people hate cold, and\nshaking themselves like a dog when he comes to shore, gathered\nround, examining me.\n\n\"Why!\" said one of them, an elderly man who seemed to be their\nleader, \"this is none other than Macumazahn, Watcher-by-Night,\nthe old friend of all us black people.  Surely the spirits of our\nfathers have been with us who might have risked our lives to save\na Boer or a half-breed.\" (The Swazis, I may explain, did not like\nthe Boers for reasons they considered sound.)\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, sitting up, \"it is I, Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"Then why,\" asked the man, \"did you, whom all know to be wise,\nshow yourself to have suddenly become a fool?\" and he pointed to\nthe raging river.\n\n\"And why,\" I asked, \"do you show yourself a fool by supposing\nthat I, whom you know to be none, am a fool?  Look across the\nwater for your answer.\"\n\nHe looked and saw the Basutos, fifty or more of them, arriving,\njust too late.\n\n\"Who are these?\" he asked.\n\n\"They are the people of Sekukuni whom you should know well\nenough.  They have hunted us all night, yes, and before, seeking\nto murder us; also they have stolen our oxen, thirty-two fine\noxen which I give to your king if he can take them back.  Now\nperhaps you understand why we dared the Crocodile River in its\nrage.\"\n\nAt the name of Sekukuni the man, who it seemed was the captain of\nsome border guards, stiffened all over like a terrier which\nperceives a rat.  \"What!\" he exclaimed, \"do these dirty Basuto\ndogs dare to carry spears so near our country?  Have they not yet\nlearned their lesson?\"\n\nThen he rushed into the water, shaking an assegai he had snatched\nup, and shouted,\n\n\"Bide a while, you fleas from the kaross of Sekukuni, till I can\ncome across and crack you between my thumb and finger.  Or at the\nleast wait until Macumazahn has time to get his rifle.  No, put\ndown those guns of yours; for every shot you fire I swear that I\nwill cut ten Basuto throats when we come to storm your koppies,\nas we shall do ere long.\"\n\n\"Be silent,\" I said, \"and let me speak.\"\n\nThen I, too, called across the river, asking where was that fat\ncaptain of theirs, as I would talk with him.  One of the men\nshouted back that he had stopped behind, very sick, because of a\nghost that he had seen.\n\n\"Ah!\" I answered, \"a ghost who pricked him in the throat.  Well,\nI was that ghost, and such are the things that happen to those\nwho would harm Macumazahn and his friends.  Did you not say last\nnight that he is a leopard who leaps out in the dark, bites and\nis gone again?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the man shouted back, \"and it is true, though had we\nknown, O Macumazahn, that you were the ghost hiding in those\nstones, you should never have leapt again.  Oh! that white\nmedicine-man who is dead has sent us on a mad errand.\"\n\n\"So you will think when I come to visit you among your koppies.\nGo home and take a message from Macumazahn to Sekukuni, who\nbelieves that the English have run away from him.  Tell him that\nthey will return again and these Swazis with them, and that then\nhe will cease to live and his town will be burnt and his tribe\nwill no more be a tribe.  Away now, more swiftly than you came,\nsince the water by which you thought to trap us is falling, and a\nSwazi impi gathers to make an end of every one of you.\"\n\nThe man attempted no answer, nor did his people so much as fire\non us.  They turned tail and crept off like a pack of frightened\njackals--pursued by the mocking of the Swazis.\n\nStill in a way they had the laugh of us, seeing that they gave us\na terrible fright and stole our wagon and thirty-two oxen.  Well,\na year or two later I helped to pay them back for that fright and\neven recovered some of the oxen.\n\nWhen they had gone the Swazis led us to a kraal about two miles\nfrom the river, sending on a runner with orders to make huts and\nfood ready for us.  It was just as much as we could do to reach\nit, for we were all utterly worn out, as were the horses.  Still\nwe did get there at last, the hot sun warming us as we went.\nArrived at the kraal I helped Heda and Kaatje from the cart--the\nformer could scarcely walk, poor dear--and into the guest hut\nwhich seemed clean, where food of a sort and fur karosses were\nbrought to them in which to wrap themselves while their clothes\ndried.\n\nLeaving them in charge of two old women, I went to see to\nAnscombe, who as yet could not do much for himself, also to the\noutspanning of the horses which were put into a cattle kraal,\nwhere they lay down at once without attempting to eat the green\nforage which was given to them.  After this I gave our goods into\nthe charge of the kraal-head, a nice old fellow whom I had never\nmet before, and he led Anscombe to another hut close to that\nwhere the women were.  Here we drank some maas, that is curdled\nmilk, ate a little mutton, though we were too fatigued to be very\nhungry, and stripping off our wet clothes, threw them out into\nthe sun to dry.\n\n\"That was a close shave,\" said Anscombe as he wrapped up in the\nkaross.\n\n\"Very,\" I answered.  \"So close that I think you must have been\nstarted in life with an extra strong guardian angel well\naccustomed to native ways.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"and, old fellow, I believe that on earth he\ngoes by the name of Allan Quatermain.\"\n\nAfter this I remember no more, for I went to sleep, and so\nremained for about twenty-four hours.  This was not wonderful,\nseeing that for two days and nights practically I had not rested,\nduring which time I went through much fatigue and many emotions.\n\nWhen at length I did wake up, the first thing I saw was Anscombe\nalready dressed, engaged in cleaning my clothes with a brush from\nhis toilet case.  I remember thinking how smart and incongruous\nthat dressing-bag, made appropriately enough of crocodile hide,\nlooked in this Kaffir hut with its silver-topped bottles and its\nivory-handled razors.\n\n\"Time to get up, Sir.  Bath ready, Sir,\" he said in his jolly,\ndrawling voice, pointing to a calabash full of hot water.  \"Hope\nyou slept as well as I did, Sir.\"\n\n\"You appear to have recovered your spirits,\" I remarked as I rose\nand began to wash myself.\n\n\"Yes, Sir, and why not?  Heda is quite well, for I have seen her.\nThese Swazis are very good people, and as Kaatje understands\ntheir language, bring us all we want.  Our troubles seem to be\ndone with.  Old Marnham is dead, and doubtless cremated; Rodd is\ndead and, let us hope, in heaven; the Basutos have melted away,\nthe morning is fine and warm and a whole kid is cooking for\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"I wish there were two, for I am ravenous,\" I remarked.\n\n\"The horses are getting rested and feeding well, though some of\ntheir legs have filled, and the trap is little the worse, for I\nhave walked to look at them, or rather hopped, leaning on the\nshoulder of a very sniffy Swazi boy.  Do you know, old fellow, I\nbelieve there never were any Basutos; also that the venerable\nMarnham and the lurid Rodd had no real existence, that they were\nbut illusions, a prolonged nightmare--no more.  Here is your\nshirt.  I am sorry that I have not had time to wash it, but it\nhas cooked well in the sun, which, being flannel, is almost as\ngood.\"\n\n\"At any rate Heda remains,\" I remarked, cutting his nonsense\nshort, \"and I suppose she is not a nightmare or a delusion.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank God! she remains,\" he replied with earnestness.  \"Oh!\nAllan, I thought she must drown in that river, and if I had lost\nher, I think I should have gone mad.  Indeed, at the moment I\nfelt myself going mad while I dragged and flogged at those\nhorses.\"\n\n\"Well, you didn't lose her, and if she had drowned, you would\nhave drowned also.  So don't talk any more about it.  She is\nsafe, and now we have got to keep her so, for you are not married\nyet, my boy, and there are generally more trees in a wood than\none can see.  Still we are alive and well, which is more than we\nhad any right to expect, and, as you say, let us thank God for\nthat.\"\n\nThen I put on my coat and my boots which Anscombe had greased as\nhe had no blacking, and crept from the hut.\n\nThere, only a few yards away, engaged in setting the breakfast in\nthe shadow of another hut on a tanned hide that served for a\ntablecloth while Kaatje saw to the cooking close by, I found\nHeda, still a little pale and sorrowful but otherwise quite well\nand rested.  Moreover, she had managed to dress herself very\nnicely, I suppose by help of spare clothes in the cart, and\ntherefore looked as charming as she always did.  I think that her\nperfect manners were one of her greatest attractions.  Thus on\nthis morning her first thought was to thank me very sweetly for\nall she was good enough to say I had done for her and Anscombe,\nthereby, as she put it, saving their lives several times over.\n\n\"My dear young lady,\" I answered as roughly as I could, \"don't\nflatter yourself on that point; it was my own life of which I was\nthinking.\"\n\nBut she only smiled and, shaking her head in a fascinating way\nthat was peculiar to her, remarked that I could not deceive her\nas I did the Kaffirs.  After this the solid Kaatje brought the\nfood and we breakfasted very heartily, or at least I did.\n\nNow I am not going to set out all the details of our journey\nthrough Swazi-Land, for though in some ways it was interesting\nenough, also as comfortable as a stay among savages can be, for\neverywhere we were kindly received, to do so would be too long,\nand I must get on with my story.  At the king's kraal, which we\ndid not reach for some days as the absence of roads and the\nflooded state of the rivers, also the need of sparing our horses,\ncaused us to travel very slowly, I met a Boer who I think was\nconcession hunting.\n\nHe told me that things were really serious in Zululand, so\nserious that he thought there was a probability of immediate war\nbetween the English and the Zulus.  He said also that Cetewayo,\nthe Zulu king, had sent messengers to stir up the Basutos and\nother tribes against the white men, with the result that Sekukuni\nhad already made a raid towards Pilgrim's Rest and Lydenburg.\n\nI expressed surprise and asked innocently if he had done any\nharm.  The Boer replied he understood that they had stolen some\ncattle, killed two white men, if not more, and burnt their house.\nHe added, however, that he was not sure whether the white men had\nbeen killed by the Kaffirs or by other white men with whom they\nhad quarrelled.  There was a rumour to this effect, and he\nunderstood that the magistrate of Barberton had gone with some\nmounted police and armed natives to investigate the matter.\n\nThen we parted, as, having got his concession to which the king\nUmbandine had put his mark when he was drunk on brandy that the\nBoer himself had brought with him as a present, he was anxious to\nbe gone before he grew sober and revoked it.  Indeed, he was in\nso great a hurry that he never stopped to inquire what I was\ndoing in Swazi-Land, nor do I think he realized that I was not\nalone.  Certainly he was quite unaware that I had been mixed up\nin these Basuto troubles.  Still his story as to the\ninvestigation concerning the deaths of Marnham and Rodd made me\nuneasy, since I feared lest he should hear something on his\njourney and put two and two together, though as a matter of fact\nI don't think he ever did either of these things.\n\nThe Swazis told me much the same story as to the brewing Zulu\nstorm.  In fact an old Induna or councillor, whom I knew,\ninformed me that Cetewayo had sent messengers to them, asking for\ntheir help if it should come to fighting with the white men, but\nthat the king and councillors answered that they had always been\nthe Queen's children (which was not strictly true, as they were\nnever under English rule) and did not wish to \"bite her feet if\nshe should have to fight with her hands.\"  I replied that I hoped\nthey would always act up to these fine words, and changed the\nsubject.\n\nNow once more the question arose as to whether we should make for\nNatal or press on to Zululand.  The rumour of coming war\nsuggested that the first would be our better course, while the\nBoer's story as to the investigation of Rodd's death pointed the\nother way.  Really I did not know which to do, and as usual\nAnscombe and Heda seemed inclined to leave the decision to me.  I\nthink that after all Natal would have gained the day had it not\nbeen for a singular circumstance, not a flash of lightning this\ntime.  Indeed, I had almost made up my mind to risk trouble and\ninquiry as to Rodd's death, remembering that in Natal these two\nyoung people could get married, which, being in loco parentis, I\nthought it desirable they should do as soon as possible, if only\nto ease me of my responsibilities.  Also thence I could attend to\nthe matter of Heda's inheritance and rid myself of her father's\nwill that already had been somewhat damaged in the Crocodile\nRiver, though not as much as it might have been since I had taken\nthe precaution to enclose it in Anscombe's sponge bag before we\nleft the house.\n\nThe circumstance was this: On emerging from the cart one morning,\nwhere I slept to keep an eye upon the valuables, for it will be\nremembered that we had a considerable sum in gold with us, also\nHeda's jewels, a Swazi informed me that a messenger wished to see\nme.  I asked what messenger and whence did he come.  He replied\nthat the messenger was a witch-doctoress named Nombe, and that\nshe came from Zululand and said that I knew her father.\n\nI bade the man bring her to me, wondering who on earth she could\nbe, for it is not usual for the Zulus to send women as\nmessengers, and from whom she came.  However, I knew exactly what\nshe would be like, some hideous old hag smelling horribly of\ngrease and other abominations, with a worn snake skin and some\nhuman bones tied about her.\n\nPresently she came, escorted by the Swazi who was grinning, for I\nthink he guessed what I expected to see.  I stared and rubbed my\neyes, thinking that I must still be asleep, for instead of a fat\nold Isanusi there appeared a tall and graceful young woman,\nrather light-coloured, with deep and quiet eyes and a by no means\nill-favoured face, remarkable for a fixed and somewhat mysterious\nsmile.  She was a witch-doctoress sure enough, for she wore in\nher hair the regulation bladders and about her neck the circlet\nof baboon's teeth, also round her middle a girdle from which hung\nlittle bags of medicines.\n\nShe contemplated me gravely and I contemplated her, waiting till\nshe should choose to speak.  At length, having examined me inch\nby inch, she saluted by raising her rounded arm and tapering\nhand, and remarked in a soft, full voice--\n\n\"All is as the picture told.  I perceive before me the lord\nMacumazahn.\"\n\nI thought this a strange saying, seeing that I could not\nrecollect having given my photograph to any one in Zululand.\n\n\"You need no magic to tell you that, doctoress,\" I remarked, \"but\nwhere did you see my picture?\"\n\n\"In the dust far away,\" she replied.\n\n\"And who showed it to you?\"\n\n\"One who knew you, O Macumazahn, in the years before I came out\nof the Darkness, one named Opener of Roads, and with him another\nwho also knew you in those years, one who has gone down to the\nDarkness.\"\n\nNow for some occult reason I shrank from asking the name of this\n\"one who had gone down to the Darkness,\" although I was sure that\nshe was waiting for the question.  So I merely remarked, without\nshowing surprise--\n\n\"So Zikali still lives, does he?  He should have been dead long\nago.\"\n\n\"You know well that he lives, Macumazahn, for how could he die\ntill his work was accomplished?  Moreover, you will remember that\nhe spoke to you when last moon was but just past her full--in a\ndream, Macumazahn.  I brought that dream, although you did not\nsee me.\"\n\n\"Pish!\" I exclaimed.  \"Have done with your talk of dreams.  Who\nthinks anything of dreams?\"\n\n\"You do,\" she replied even more placidly than before, \"you whom\nthat dream has brought hither--with others.\"\n\n\"You lie,\" I said rudely.  \"The Basutos brought me here.\"\n\n\"The Watcher-by-Night is pleased to say that I lie, so doubtless\nI do lie,\" she answered, her fixed smile deepening a little.\nThen she folded her arms across her breast and remained silent.\n\n\"You are a messenger, O seer of pictures in the dust and bearer\nof the cup of dreams,\" I said with sarcasm.  \"Who sends a message\nby your lips for me, and what are the words of the message?\"\n\n\"My Lords the Spirits spoke the message by the mouth of the\nmaster Zikali.  He sends it on to you by the lips of your\nservant, the doctoress Nombe.\"\n\n\"Are you indeed a doctoress, being so young?\" I asked, for\nsomehow I wished to postpone the hearing of that message.\n\n\"O Macumazahn, I have heard the call, I have felt the pain in my\nback, I have drunk of the black medicine and of the white\nmedicine, yes, for a whole year. I have been visited by the\nmultitude of Spirits and seen the shades of those who live and of\nthose who are dead.  I have dived into the river and drawn my\nsnake from its mud; see, its skin is about me now,\" and opening\nthe mantle she wore she showed what looked like the skin of a\nblack mamba, fastened round her slender body.  \"I have dwelt in\nthe wilderness alone and listened to its voices.  I have sat at\nthe feet of my master, the Opener of Roads, and looked down the\nroad and drunk of his wisdom.  Yes, I am in truth a doctoress.\"\n\n\"Well, after all this, you should be as wise as you are pretty.\"\n\n\"Once before, Macumazahn, you told a maid of my people that she\nwas pretty and she came to no good end; though to one that was\ngreat.  Therefore do not say to me that I am pretty, though I am\nglad that you should think so who can compare me with so many\nwhom you have known,\" and she dropped her eyes, looking a little\nshy.\n\nIt was the first human touch I had seen about her, and I was glad\nto have found a weak spot in her armour.  Moreover, from that\nmoment she was always my friend.\n\n\"As you will, Nombe.  Now for your message.\"\n\n\"My Lords the Spirits, speaking through Zikali as one who makes\nmusic speak through a pipe of reeds, say--\"\n\n\"Never mind what the spirits say.  Tell me what Zikali says,\" I\ninterrupted.\n\n\"So be it, Macumazahn.  These are the words of Zikali: 'O\nWatcher-by-Night, the time draws on when the\nThing-who-should-never-have-been-born will be as though he never\nhad been born, whereat he rejoices.  But first there is much for\nhim to do, and as he told you nearly three hundred moons ago, in\nwhat must be done you will have your part.  Of that he will speak\nto you afterwards.  Macumazahn, you dreamed a dream, did you not,\nlying asleep in the house that was built of white stone which now\nis black with fire?  I, Zikali, sent you that dream through the\narts of a child of mine who is named Nombe, she to whom I have\ngiven a Spirit to guide her feet.  You did well to follow it,\nMacumazahn, for had you tried the other path, which would have\nled you back to the towns of the white men, you and those with\nyou must have been killed, how it does not matter.  Now by the\nmouth of Nombe I say to you, do not follow the thought that is in\nyour mind as she speaks to you and go to Natal, since if you do\nso, you and those with you will come to much shame and trouble\nthat to you would be worse than death, over the matter of the\nkilling of a certain white doctor in a swamp where grow\nyellow-wood trees.  For there in Natal you will be taken, all of\nyou, and sent back to the Transvaal to be tried before a man who\nwears upon his head horse's hair stained white.  But if you come\nto Zululand this shadow shall pass away from you, since great\nthings are about to happen which will cause so small a matter to\nbe forgot.  Moreover, I Zikali, who do not lie, promise this:\nThat however great may be their dangers here in Zululand, those\nhalf-fledged ones whom you, the old night-hawk, cover with your\nwings, shall in the end suffer no harm; those of whom I spoke to\nyou in your dream, the white lord, Mauriti, and the white lady,\nHeddana, who stretch out their arms one to another.  I wait to\nwelcome you, here at the Black Kloof, whither my daughter Nombe\nwill guide you.  Cetewayo, the king, also will welcome you, and\nso will another whose name I do not utter.  Now choose.  I have\nspoken.'\"\n\nHaving delivered her message Nombe stood quite still, smiling as\nbefore, and apparently indifferent as to its effect.\n\n\"How do I know that you come from Zikali?\" I asked.  \"You may be\nbut the bait set upon a trap.\"\n\nFrom somewhere within her robe she produced a knife and handed it\nto me, remarking--\n\n\"The Master says you will remember this, and by it know that the\nmessage comes from him.  He bade me add that with it was carved a\ncertain image that once he gave to you at Panda's kraal, wrapped\nround with a woman's hair, which image you still have.\"\n\nI looked at the knife and did remember it, for it was one of\nthose of Swedish make with a wooden handle, the first that I had\never seen in Africa.  I had made a present of it to Zikali when I\nreturned to Zululand before the war between the Princes.  The\nimage, too, I still possessed.  It was that of the woman called\nMameena who brought about the war, and the wrapping which covered\nit was of the hair that once grew upon her head.\n\n\"The words are Zikali's,\" I said, returning her the knife, \"but\nwhy do you call yourself the child of one who is too old to be a\nfather?\"\n\n\"The Master says that my great-grandmother was his daughter and\nthat therefore I am his child.  Now, Macumazahn, I go to eat with\nmy people, for I have servants with me.  Then I must speak with\nthe Swazi king, for whom I also have a message, which I cannot do\nat present because he is still drunk with the white man's liquor.\nAfter that I shall be ready to return with you to Zululand.\"\n\n\"I never said that I was going to Zululand, Nombe.\"\n\n\"Yet your heart has gone there already, Macumazahn, and you must\nfollow your heart.  Does not the image which was carved with the\nknife you gave, hold a white heart in its hand, and although it\nseems to be but a bit of Umzimbeete wood, is it not alive and\nbewitched, which perhaps is why you could never make up your mind\nto burn it, Macumazahn?\"\n\n\"I wish I had,\" I replied angrily; but having thrown this last\nspear, with a flash of her unholy eyes Nombe had turned and gone.\n\nA clever woman and thoroughly coached, thought I.  Well, Zikali\nwas never one to suffer fools, and doubtless she is another of\nthe pawns whom he uses on his board of policy.  Oh! she, or\nrather he was right; my heart was in Zululand, though not in the\nway he thought, and I longed to see the end of that great game\nplayed by a wizard against a despot and his hosts.\n\nSo we went to Zululand because after talking it over we all came\nto the conclusion that this was the best thing to do, especially\nas there we seemed to be sure of a welcome.  For later in the day\nNombe repeated to Anscombe and Heda the invitation which she had\ndelivered to me, assuring them also that in Zululand they would\ncome to no harm.\n\nIt was curious to watch the meeting between Heda and Nombe.  The\ndoctoress appeared just as we had risen from breakfast, and Heda,\nturning round, came face to face with her.\n\n\"Is this your witch, Mr. Quatermain?\" she asked me in her\nvivacious way.  \"Why, she is different from what I expected,\nquite good-looking and, yes, impressive.  I am not sure that she\ndoes not frighten me a little.\"\n\n\"What does the Inkosikaasi (i.e., the chieftainess) say\nconcerning me, Macumazahn?\" asked Nombe.\n\n\"Only what I said, that you are young who she thought would be\nold, and pretty who she thought would be ugly.\"\n\n\"To grow old we must first be young, Macumazahn, and in due\nseason all of us will become ugly, even the Inkosikaasi.  But I\nthought she said also that she feared me.\"\n\n\"Do you know English, Nombe?\"\n\n\"Nay, but I know how to read eyes, and the Inkosikaasi has eyes\nthat talk.  Tell her that she has no reason to fear me who would\nbe her friend, though I think that she will bring me little\nluck.\"\n\nIt was scarcely necessary, so far as Heda was concerned, but I\ntranslated, leaving out the last sentence.\n\n\"Say to her that I am grateful who have few friends, and that I\nwill fear her no more,\" said Heda.\n\nAgain I translated, whereon Nombe stretched out her hand,\nsaying--\n\n\"Let her not scorn to take it, it is clean.  It has brought no\nman to his death--\" Here she looked at Heda meaningly.\n\"Moreover, though she is white and I am black, I like herself am\nof high blood and come of a race of warriors who did nothing\nsmall, and lastly, we are of an age, and if she is beautiful, I\nam wise and have gifts great as her own.\"\n\nOnce more I interpreted for the benefit of Anscombe, for Heda\nunderstood Zulu well enough, although she had pretended not to do\nso, after which the two shook hands, to Anscombe's amusement and\nmy wonder.  For I felt this scene to be strained and one that\nhid, or presaged, something I did not comprehend.\n\n\"This is the Chief she loves?\" said Nombe to me, studying\nAnscombe with her steady eyes after Heda had gone.  \"Well, he is\nno common man and brave, if idle; one, too, who may grow tall in\nthe world, should he live, when he has learned to think.  But,\nMacumazahn, if she met you both at the same time why did she not\nchoose you?\"\n\n\"Just now you said you were wise, Nombe,\" I replied laughing,\n\"but now I see that, like most of your trade, you are but a vain\nboaster.  Is there a hat upon my head that you cannot see the\ncolour of my hair, and is it natural that youth should turn to\nage?\"\n\n\"Sometimes if the mind is old, Macumazahn, which is why I love\nthe Spirits only who are more ancient than the mountains, and\nwith them Zikali their servant, who was young before the Zulus\nwere a people, or so he says, and still year by year gathers\nwisdom as the bee gathers honey.  Inspan your horses, Macumazahn,\nfor I have done my business and am ready to start.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\n\n\nZIKALI\n\n\n\n\n\nTen days had gone by when once more I found myself drawing near\nto the mouth of the Black Kloof where dwelt Zikali the Wizard.\nOur journey in Zululand had been tedious and uneventful.  It\nseemed to me that we met extraordinarily few people; it was as\nthough the place had suddenly become depopulated, and I even\npassed great kraals where there was no one to be seen.  I asked\nNombe what was the meaning of this, for she and three silent men\nshe had with her were acting as our guides.  Once she answered\nthat the people had moved because of lack of food, as the season\nhad been one of great scarcity owing to drought, and once that\nthey had been summoned to a gathering at the king's kraal near\nUlundi.  At any rate they were not there, and the few who did\nappear stared at us strangely.\n\nMoreover, I noticed that they were not allowed to speak to us.\nAlso Heda was kept in the cart and Nombe insisted that the rear\ncanvas curtain should be closed and a blanket fastened behind\nAnscombe who drove, evidently with the object that she should not\nbe seen.  Further, on the plea of weariness, from the time that\nwe entered Zulu territory Nombe asked to be allowed to ride in\nthe cart with Kaatje and Heda, her real reason, as I was sure,\nbeing that she might keep a watch on them.  Lastly we travelled\nby little-frequented tracks, halting at night in out-of-the-way\nplaces, where, however, we always found food awaiting us,\ndoubtless by arrangement.\n\nWith one man whom I had known in past days and who recognized me,\nI did manage to have a short talk.  He asked me what I was doing\nin Zululand at that time.  I replied that I was on a visit to\nZikali, whereon he said I should be safer with him than with any\none else.\n\nOur conversation went no further, for just then one of Nombe's\nservants appeared and made some remark to the man of which I\ncould not catch the meaning, whereon he promptly turned and\ndeported, leaving me wondering and uneasy.\n\nEvidently we were being isolated, but when I remonstrated with\nNombe she only answered with her most unfathomable smile--\n\n\"O Macumazahn, you must ask Zikali of all these things.  I am no\none and know nothing, who only do what the Master tells me is for\nyour good.\"\n\n\"I am minded to turn and depart from Zululand,\" I said angrily,\n\"for in this low veld whither you have led us there is fever and\nthe horses will catch sickness or be bitten by the tsetse fly and\nperish.\"\n\n\"I cannot say, Macumazahn, who only travel by the road the Master\npointed out.  Yet if you will be guided by me, you will not try\nto leave Zululand.\"\n\n\"You mean that I am in a trap, Nombe.\"\n\n\"I mean that the country is full of soldiers and that all white\nmen have fled from it.  Therefore, even if you were allowed to\npass because the Zulus love you, Macumazahn, it might well happen\nthat those with you would stay behind, sound asleep, Macumazahn,\nfor which, like you, I should be sorry.\"\n\nAfter this I said no more, for I knew that she meant to warn me.\nWe had entered on this business and must see it through to its\nend, sweet or bitter.\n\nAs for Anscombe and Heda their happiness seemed to be complete.\nThe novelty of the life charmed them, and of its dangers they\ntook no thought, being content to leave me, in whom they had a\nblind faith, to manage everything.  Moreover, Heda, who in the\njoy of her love was beginning to forget the sorrow of her\nfather's death and the other tragic events through which she had\njust passed, took a great fancy to the young witch-doctoress who\nconversed with her in Zulu, a language of which, having lived so\nlong in Natal, Heda knew much already.  Indeed, when I suggested\nto her that to be over-trusting was not wise, she fired up and\nreplied that she had been accustomed to natives all her life and\ncould judge them, adding that she had every confidence in Nombe.\n\nAfter this I held my tongue and said no more of my doubts.  What\nwas the use since Heda would not listen to them, and at that time\nAnscombe was nothing but her echo?\n\nSo this, for me, very dull journey continued, till at length,\nafter being held up for a couple of days by a flooded river where\nthere was nothing to do but sit and smoke, as Nombe requested me\nnot to make a noise by shooting at the big game that abounded, we\nbegan to emerge from the bush-veld on to the lovely uplands in\nthe neighbourhood of Nongoma.  Leaving these on our right we\nheaded for a place called Ceza, a natural stronghold consisting\nof a flat plain on the top of a mountain, which plain is\nsurrounded by bush.  It is at the foot of this stronghold that\nthe Black Kloof lies, being one of the ravines that run up into\nthe mountain.\n\nSo thither we came at last.  It was drawing towards sunset, a\ntremendous and stormy sunset, as we approached the place, and lo!\nit looked exactly as it had done when first I saw it more than a\nscore of years before, forbidding as the mouth of hell, vast and\nlonesome.  There stood the columns of boulders fantastically\npiled one upon another; there grew the sparse trees upon its\nsteep sides, mingled with aloes that looked like the shapes of\nmen; there was the granite bottom swept almost clean by floods in\nsome dim age, and the little stream that flowed along it.  There,\ntoo, was the spot where once I had outspanned my wagons on the\nnight when my servants swore that they saw the Imikovu, or\nwizard-raised spectres, floating past them on the air in the\nshapes of the Princes and others who were soon to fall at the\nbattle of the Tugela.  Up it we went, I riding and Nombe, who had\ndescended from the cart that followed, walking by my side and\nwatching me.\n\n\"You seem sad, Macumazahn,\" she said at length.\n\n\"Yes, Nombe, I am sad.  This place makes me so.\"\n\n\"Is it the place, Macumazahn, or is it the thought of one whom\nonce you met in the place, one who is dead?\"\n\nI looked at her, pretending not to understand, and she went on--\n\n\"I have the gift of vision, Macumazahn, which comes at times to\nthose of my trade, and now and again, amongst others, I have\nseemed to see the spirit of a certain woman haunting this kloof\nas though she were waiting for some one.\"\n\n\"Indeed, and what may that woman be like?\" I inquired carelessly.\n\n\"As it chances I can see her now gliding backwards in front of you\njust there, and therefore am able to answer your question,\nMacumazahn.  She is tall and slender, beautifully made, and\nlight-coloured for one of us black people.  She has large eyes\nlike a buck, and those eyes are full of fire that does not come\nfrom the sun but from within.  Her face is tender yet proud, oh!\nso proud that she makes me afraid.  She wears a cloak of grey\nfur, and about her neck there is a circlet of big blue beads with\nwhich her fingers play.  A thought comes from her to me.  These\nare the words of the thought: 'I have waited long in this dark\nplace, watching by day and night till you, the Watcher-by-Night,\nreturn to meet me here.  At length you have come, and in this\nenchanted place my hungry spirit can feed upon your spirit for a\nwhile.  I thank you for coming, who now am no more lonely.  Fear\nnothing, Macumazahn, for by a certain kiss I swear to you that\ntill the appointed hour when you become as I am, I will be a\nshield upon your arm and a spear in your hand.'  Such are the\nwords of her thought, Macumazahn, but she has gone away and I\nhear no more.  It was as though your horse rode over her and she\npassed through you.\"\n\nThen, like one who wished to answer no questions, Nombe turned\nand went back to the cart, where she began to talk indifferently\nwith Heda, for as soon as we entered the kloof her servants had\ndrawn back the curtains and let fall the blanket.  As for me, I\ngroaned, for of course I knew that Zikali, who was well\nacquainted with the appearance of Mameena, had instructed Nombe\nto say all this to me in order to impress my mind for some reason\nof his own.  Yet he had done it cleverly, for such words as those\nMameena might well have uttered could her great spirit have need\nto walk the earth again.  Was such a thing possible, I wondered?\nNo, it was not possible, yet it was true that her atmosphere\nseemed to cling about this place and that my imagination, excited\nby memory and Nombe's suggestions, seemed to apprehend her\npresence.\n\nAs I reflected the horse advanced round the little bend in the\never-narrowing cliffs, and there in front of me, under the\ngigantic mass of overhanging rock, appeared the kraal of Zikali\nsurrounded by its reed fence.  The gate of the fence was open, and\nbeyond it, on his stool in front of the large hut, sat Zikali.\nEven at that distance it was impossible to mistake his figure,\nwhich was like no other that I had known in the world.  A\nbroad-shouldered dwarf with a huge head, deep, sunken eyes and\nsnowy hair that hung upon his shoulders; the whole frame and face\npervaded with an air of great antiquity, and yet owing to the\nplumpness of the flesh and that freshness of skin which is\nsometimes seen in the aged, comparatively young-looking.\n\nSuch was the great wizard Zikali, known throughout the land for\nlonger than any living man could remember as \"Opener of Roads,\" a\ntitle that referred to his powers of spiritual vision, also as\nthe \"Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born,\" a name given to him\nby Chaka, the first and greatest of the Zulu kings, because of\nhis deformity.\n\nThere he sat silent, impassive, staring open-eyed at the red ball\nof the setting sun, looking more like some unshapely statue than\na man.  His silent, fierce-faced servants appeared.  To me they\nlooked like the same men whom I had seen here three and twenty\nyears before, only grown older.  Indeed, I think they were, for\nthey greeted me by name and saluted by raising their broad\nspears.  I dismounted and waited while Anscombe, whose foot was\nnow quite well again, helped Heda from the cart which was led\naway by the servants.  Anscombe, who seemed a little oppressed,\nremarked that this was a strange place.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Heda, \"but it is magnificent.  I like it.\"\n\nThen her eye fell upon Zikali seated before the hut and she\nturned pale.\n\n\"Oh! what a terrible-looking man,\" she murmured, \"if he is a\nman.\"\n\nThe maid Kaatje saw him also and uttered a little cry.\n\n\"Don't be frightened, dear,\" said Anscombe, \"he is only an old\ndwarf.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" she exclaimed doubtfully, \"but to me he is like\nthe devil.\"\n\nNombe slid past us.  She threw off the kaross she wore and for\nthe first time appeared naked except for the mucha about her\nmiddle and her ornaments.  Down she went on her hands and knees\nand in this humble posture crept towards Zikali.  Arriving in\nfront of him she touched the ground with her forehead, then\nlifting her right arm, gave the salute of Makosi, to which as a\ngreat wizard he was entitled, being supposed to be the home of\nmany spirits.  So far as I could see he took no notice of her.\nPresently she moved and squatted herself down on his right hand,\nwhile two of his attendants appeared from behind the hut and took\ntheir stand between him and its doorway, holding their spears\nraised.  About a minute later Nombe beckoned to us to approach,\nand we went forward across the courtyard, I a little ahead of the\nothers.  As we drew near Zikali opened his mouth and uttered a\nloud and terrifying laugh.  How well I remembered that laugh\nwhich I had first heard at Dingaan's kraal as a boy after the\nmurder of Retief and the Boers.*\n\n[*--See the book called _Marie,_ by H. Rider Haggard.]\n\n\"I begin to think that you are right and that this old gentleman\nmust be the devil,\" said Anscombe to Heda, then lapsed into\nsilence.\n\nAs I was determined not to speak first I took the opportunity to\nfill my pipe.  Zikali, who was watching me, although all the\nwhile he seemed to be staring at the setting sun, made a sign.\nOne of the servants dashed away and immediately returned, bearing\na flaming brand which he proffered to me as a pipe-lighter.  Then he\ndeparted again to bring three carved stools of red wood which he\nplaced for us.  I looked at mine and knew it again by the\ncarvings.  It was the same on which I had sat when first I met\nZikali.  At length he spoke in his deep, slow voice.\n\n\"Many years have gone by, Macumazahn, since you made use of that\nstool.  They are cut in notches upon the leg you hold and you may\ncount them if you will.\"\n\nI examined the leg.  There were the notches, twenty-two or three\nof them.  On the other legs were more notches too numerous to\nreckon.\n\n\"Do not look at those, Macumazahn, for they have nothing to do\nwith you.  They tell the years since the first of the House of\nSenzangacona sat upon that stool, since Chaka sat upon it, since\nDingaan and others sat upon it, one Mameena among them.  Well,\nmuch has happened since it served you for a rest.  You have\nwandered far and seen strange things and lived where others would\nhave died because it was your lot to live, of all of which we\nwill talk afterwards.  And now when you are grey you have come\nback here, as the Opener of Roads told you you would do, bringing\nwith you new companions, you who have the art of making friends\neven when you are old, which is one given to few men.  Where are\nthose with whom you used to company, Macumazahn?  Where are\nSaduko and Mameena and the rest?  All gone except the\nThing-who-should-never-have-been-born,\" and again he laughed\nloudly.\n\n\"And who it seems has never learned when to die,\" I remarked,\nspeaking for the first time.\n\n\"Just so, Macumazahn, because I cannot die until my work is\nfinished.  But thanks be to the spirits of my fathers and to my\nown that I live on to glut with vengeance, the end draws near at\nlast, and as I promised you in the dead days, you shall have your\nshare in it, Macumazahn.\"\n\nHe paused, then continued, still staring at the sinking sun,\nwhich made his remarks about us, whom he did not seem to see,\nuncanny--\n\n\"That white man with you is brave and well-born, one who loves\nfighting, I think, and the maiden is fair and sweet, with a high\nspirit.  She is thinking to herself that I am an old wizard whom,\nif she were not afraid of me, she would ask to tell her her\nfortune.  See, she understands and starts.  Well, perhaps I will\none day.  Meanwhile, here is a little bit of it.  She will have\nfive children, of whom two will die and one will give her so much\ntrouble that she will wish it had died also.  But who their\nfather will be I do not say.  Nombe my child, lead away this\nWhite One and her woman to the hut that has been made ready for\nher, for she is weary and would rest.  See, too, that she lacks\nfor nothing which we can give her who is our guest.  Let the\nwhite lord, Mauriti, accompany her to the hut and be shown that\nnext to it in which he and Macumazahn will sleep, so that he may\nbe sure that she is safe, and attend to the horses if he wills.\nThere is a place to tether them behind the huts, and the men who\ntravelled with you will help him.  Afterwards, when I have spoken\nwith him, Macumazahn can join them that they may eat before they\nsleep.\"\n\nThese directions I translated to Anscombe, who went gladly enough\nwith Heda, for I think they were both afraid of the terrible old\ndwarf and did not desire his company in the gathering gloom.\n\n\"The sun sinks once more, Macumazahn,\" he said when they were\ngone, \"and the air grows chill.  Come with me now into my hut\nwhere the fire burns, for I am aged and the cold strikes through\nme.  Also there we can be alone.\"\n\nSo speaking he turned and crawled into the hut, looking like a\ngigantic white-headed beetle as he did so, a creature, I\nremembered, to which I had once compared him in the past.  I\nfollowed, carrying the historic stool, and when he had seated\nhimself on his kaross on the further side of the fire, took up my\nposition opposite to him.  This fire was fed with some kind of\nroot or wood that gave a thin clear flame with little or no\nsmoke.  Over it he crouched, so closely that his great head\nseemed to be almost in the flame at which he stared with\nunblinking eyes as he had done at the sun, circumstances which\nadded to his terrifying appearance and made me think of a certain\nregion and its inhabitants.\n\n\"Why do you come here, Macumazahn?\" he asked after studying me\nfor a while through that window of fire.\n\n\"Because you brought me, Zikali, partly through your messenger,\nNombe, and partly by means of a dream which she says you sent.\"\n\n\"Did I, Macumazahn?  If so, I have forgotten it.  Dreams are as\nmany as gnats by the water; they bite us while we sleep, but when\nwe wake up we forget them.  Also it is foolishness to say that\none man can send a dream to another.\"\n\n\"Then your messenger lied, Zikali, especially as she added that\nshe brought it.\"\n\n\"Of course she lied, Macumazahn.  Is she not my pupil whom I have\ntrained from a child?  Moreover, she lied well, it would seem,\nwho guessed what sort of a dream you would have when you thought\nof turning your steps to Zululand.\"\n\n\"Why do you play at sticks (i.e., fence) with me, Zikali, seeing\nthat neither of us are children?\"\n\n\"O Macumazahn, that is where you are mistaken, seeing that both\nof us, old though we be and cunning though we think ourselves,\nare nothing but babes in the arms of Fate.  Well, well, I will\ntell you the truth, since it would be foolish to try to throw\ndust into such eyes as yours.  I knew that you were down in\nSekukuni's country and I was watching you--through my spies.  You\nhave been nowhere during all these years that I was not watching\nyou--through my spies.  For instance, that Arab-looking man named\nHarut, whom first you met at a big kraal in a far country, was a\nspy of mine.  He has visited me lately and told me much of your\ndoings.  No, don't ask me of him now who would talk to you of\nother matters--\"\n\n\"Does Harut still live then, and has he found a new god in place\nof the Ivory Child?\" I interrupted.\n\n\"Macumazahn, if he did not live, how could he visit and speak\nwith me?  Well, I watched you there by the Oliphant's River where\nyou fought Sekukuni's people, and afterwards in the marble hut\nwhere you found the old white man dead in his chair and got the\nwritings that you have in your pocket which concern the maiden\nHeddana; also afterwards when the white man, your friend, killed\nthe doctor who fell into a mud hole and the Basutos stole his\ncattle and wagon.\"\n\n\"How do you know all these things, Zikali?\"\n\n\"Have I not told you--through my spies.  Was there not a\nhalf-breed driver called Footsack, and do not the Basutos come\nand go between the Black Kloof and Sekukuni's town, bearing me\ntidings?\"\n\n\"Yes, Zikali, and so does the wind and so do the birds.\"\n\n\"True!  O Macumazahn, I see that you are one who has watched\nNature and its ways as closely as my spies watch you.  So I\nlearned these matters and knew that you were in trouble over the\ndeath of these white men, and your friends likewise, and as you\nwere always dear to me, I sent that child Nombe to bring you to\nme, thinking from what I knew of you that you would be more\nlikely to follow a woman who is both wise and good to look at,\nthan a man who might be neither.  I told her to say to you that\nyou and the others would be safer here than in Natal at present.\nIt seems that you hearkened and came.  That is all.\"\n\n\"Yes, I hearkened and came.  But, Zikali, that is not all, for\nyou know well that you sent for me for your own sake, not for\nmine.\"\n\n\"O Macumazahn, who can prevent a needle from piercing cloth when\nit is pushed by a finger like yours?  Your wits are too sharp for\nme, Macumazahn; your eyes read through the blanket of cunning\nwith which I would hide my thought.  You speak truly.  I did send\nfor you for my own sake as well as for yours.  I sent for you\nbecause I wanted your counsel, Macumazahn, and because Cetewayo\nthe king also wants your counsel, and I wished to see you before\nyou saw Cetewayo.  Now you have the whole truth.\"\n\n\"What do you want my counsel about, Zikali?\"\n\nHe leaned forward till his white locks almost seemed to mingle\nwith the thin flame, through which he glared at me with eyes that\nwere fiercer than the fire.\n\n\"Macumazahn, you remember the story that I told you long ago, do\nyou not?\"\n\n\"Very well, Zikali.  It was that you hate the House of\nSenzangacona which has given all its kings to Zululand.  First,\nbecause you are one of the Dwandwe tribe whom the Zulus crushed\nand mocked at.  Secondly, because Chaka the Lion named you the\n'Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born' and killed your wives,\nfor which crime you brought about the death of Chaka.  Thirdly,\nbecause you have matched your single wit for many years against\nall the power of the royal House and yet kept your life in you,\nnotably when Panda threatened you in my presence at the trial of\none who has 'gone down,' and you told him to kill you if he\ndared.  Now you would prove that you were right by causing your\ncunning to triumph over the royal House.\"\n\n\"True, quite true, O Macumazahn.  You have a good memory,\nMacumazahn, especially for anything that has to do with that\nwoman who has 'gone down.'  I sent her down, but how was she\nnamed, Macumazahn?  I forget, I forget, whose mind being old,\nfalls suddenly into black pits of darkness--like her who went\ndown.\"\n\nHe paused and we stared at each other through the veil of fire.\nThen as I made no answer, he went on--\n\n\"Oh! I remember now, she was called Mameena, was she not, a name\ntaken from the wailing of the wind?  Hark!  It is wailing now.\"\n\nI listened; it was, and I shivered to hear it, since but a minute\nbefore the night had been quite still.  Yes, the wind moaned and\nwailed about the rocks of the Black Kloof.\n\n\"Well, enough of her.  Why trouble about the dead when there are\nso many to be sent to join them?  Macumazahn, the hour is at\nhand.  The fool Cetewayo has quarrelled with your people, the\nEnglish, and on my counsel.  He has sent and killed women, or\nallowed others to do so, across the river in Natal.  His\nmessengers came to me asking what he should do.  I answered,\n'Shall a king of the blood of Chaka fear to allow his own wicked\nones to be slain because they have stepped across a strip of\nwater, and still call himself king of the Zulus?'  So those women\nwere dragged back across the water and killed; and now the\nQueen's man from the Cape asks many things, great fines of\ncattle, the giving up of the slayers, and that an end should be\nmade of the Zulu army, which is to lay down its spears and set to\nhoeing like the old women in the kraals.\"\n\n\"And if the king refuses, what then, Zikali?\"\n\n\"Then, Macumazahn, the Queen's man will declare war on the Zulus;\nalready he gathers his soldiers for the war.\"\n\n\"Will Cetewayo refuse, Zikali?\"\n\n\"I do not know.  His mind swings this way and that, like a pole\nbalanced on a rock.  The ends of the pole are weighted with much\ncounsel, and it hangs so even that if a grasshopper lit on one\nend or the other, it would turn the scale.\"\n\n\"And do you wish me to be that grasshopper, Zikali?\"\n\n\"Who else?  That is why I brought you to Zululand.\"\n\n\"So you wish me to counsel Cetewayo to lie down in the bed that\nthe English have made for him.  If he seeks my advice I will do\nso gladly, for so I am sure he will sleep well.\"\n\n\"Why do you mock me, Macumazahn?  I wish you to counsel Cetewayo\nto throw back his word into the teeth of the Queen's man and to\nfight the English.\"\n\n\"And thus bring destruction on the Zulus and death to thousands\nof them and of my own people, and in return gain nothing but\nremorse.  Do you think me mad or wicked, or both, that I should\ndo this thing?\"\n\n\"Nay, Macumazahn, you would gain much.  I could show you where\nthe king's cattle are hidden.  The English will never find them,\nand after the war you might take as many as you chose.  But it\nwould be useless, for knowing you well, I am sure that you would\nonly hand them over to the British Government, as once you handed\nover the cattle of Bangu, being fashioned that way by the\nGreat-Great, Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I might, but then what should I gain, Zikali?\"\n\n\"This: you would so bring things about that, being broken by war,\nthe Zulu power could never again menace the white men, which\nwould be a great and good deed, Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"Mayhap--I am not sure.  But of this I am sure, that I will not\nthrust my face into your nest of wasps, that the English hornets\nmay steal the honey when they are disturbed.  I leave such\nmatters to the Queen and those who rule under her.  So have done\nwith such talk, for you do but waste your breath, Zikali.\"\n\n\"It is as I guessed it would be,\" he answered, shaking his great\nhead.  \"You are too honest to prosper in the world, Macumazahn.\nWell, I must find other means to bring the House of Cetewayo to\nthe end that he deserves, who has been an evil and a cruel king.\"\n\nAll this he said, showing neither surprise nor resentment, which\nconvinced me of what I had suspected throughout, that never for\nan instant did he believe that I should fall in with his\nsuggestions and try to influence the Zulus to declare war.  No,\nthis talk of his was but a blind; there was some deeper scheme at\nwork in his cunning old brain which he was hiding from me.  Why\nexactly had he beguiled me to Zululand?  I could not divine, and\nto ask him would be worse than useless, but then and there I made\nup my mind that I would get away from the Black Kloof early on\nthe following morning, if that were possible.\n\nHe began to speak of other matters in a low, droning voice, like\na man who converses with himself.  Sad, all of them, such as the\nhaunted death of Saduko who had betrayed his lord, the Prince\nUmbelazi, because of a woman, every circumstance of which seemed\nto be familiar to him.\n\nI made no answer, who was waiting for an opportunity to leave the\nhut, and did not care to dwell on these events.  He ceased and\nbrooded for a while, then said suddenly--\n\n\"You are hungry and would eat, Macumazahn, and I who eat little\nwould sleep, for in sleep the multitudes of Spirits visit me,\nbringing tidings from afar.  Well, we have spoken together and of\nthat I am glad, for who knows when the chance will come again,\nthough I think that soon we shall meet at Ulundi, Ulundi where\nFate spreads its net.  What was it I had to say to you?  Ah! I\nremember.  There is one who is always in your thoughts and whom\nyou wish to see, one too who wishes to see you.  You shall, you\nshall in payment for the trouble you have taken in coming so far\nto visit a poor old Zulu doctor whom, as you told me long ago,\nyou know to be nothing but a cheat.\"\n\nHe paused and, why I could not tell, I grew weak with fear of I\nknew not what, and bethought me of flight.\n\n\"It is cold in this hut, is it not?\" he went on.  \"Burn up, fire,\nburn up!\" and plunging his hand into a catskin bag of medicines\nwhich he wore, he drew out some powder which he threw upon the\nembers that instantly burst into bright flame.\n\n\"Look now, Macumazahn,\" he said, \"look to your right.\"\n\nI looked and oh Heaven! there before me with outstretched arms\nand infinite yearning on her face, stood Mameena, Mameena as I\nhad last seen her after I gave her the promised kiss that she\nused to cover her taking of the poison.  For five seconds,\nmayhap, she stood thus, living, wonderful, but still as death,\nthe fierce light showing all.  Then the flame died down again and\nshe was gone.\n\nI turned and next instant was out of the hut, pursued by the\nterrible laughter of Zikali.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\n\n\nTRAPPED\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside in the cool night air I recovered myself, sufficiently at\nany rate to be able to think, and saw at once that the thing was\nan illusion for which Zikali had prepared my mind very carefully\nby means of the young witch-doctoress, Nombe.  He knew well\nenough that this remarkable woman, Mameena, had made a deep\nimpression on me nearly a quarter of a century before, as she had\ndone upon other men with whom she had been associated.  Therefore\nit was probable that she would always be present to my thought,\nsince whatever a man forgets, he remembers the women who have\nshown him favour, true or false, for Nature has decreed it thus.\n\nMoreover, this was one to be remembered for herself, since she\nwas beautiful and most attractive in her wild way.  Also she had\nbrought about a great war, causing the death of thousands, and\nlastly her end might fairly be called majestic.  All these\nimpressions Zikali had instructed Nombe to revivify by her\ncontinual allusions to Mameena, and lastly by her pretence that\nshe saw her walking in front of me.  Then when I was tired and\nhungry, in that place which for me was so closely connected with\nthis woman, and in his own uncanny company, either by mesmerism\nor through the action of the drug he threw upon the fire, he had\nsucceeded in calling up the illusion of her presence to my\ncharmed sight.  All this was clear enough, what remained obscure\nwas his object.\n\nPossibly he had none beyond an impish desire to frighten me,\nwhich is common enough among practitioners of magic in all lands.\nWell, for a little while he had succeeded, although to speak\ntruth I remained uncertain whether in a sense I was not more\nthrilled and rejoiced than frightened.  Mameena had never been so\nill to look upon, and I knew that dead or living I had nothing to\nfear from her who would have walked through hell fire for my\nsake, would have done anything, except perhaps sacrifice her\nambition.  No, even if this were her ghost I should have been\nglad to see her again.\n\nBut it was not a ghost; it was only a fancy reproduced exactly as\nmy mind had photographed her, almost as my eyes last saw her,\nwhen her kiss was still warm upon my lips.\n\nSuch were my thoughts as I stood outside that hut with the cold\nperspiration running down my face, for to tell the truth my\nnerves were upset, although without reason.  So upset were they\nthat when suddenly a silent-footed man appeared out of the\ndarkness I jumped as high as though I had set my foot on a\npuff-adder, and until I recognized him by his voice as one of\nNombe's servants who had accompanied us from Swazi-Land, felt\nquite alarmed.  As a matter of fact he had only come to tell me\nthat our meal was ready and that the other \"high White Ones\" were\nwaiting for me.\n\nHe led me round the fence that encircled Zikali's dwelling-place,\nto two huts that stood nearly behind it, almost against the face\nof the rock which, overhanging in a curve, formed a kind of\nnatural roof above them.  I thought they must have been built\nsince I visited the place, as I, who have a good memory for such\nthings, did not remember them.  Indeed, on subsequent examination\nI found that they were quite new, for the poles that formed their\nuprights were still green and the grass of the thatch was\nscarcely dry.  It looked to me as if they had been specially\nconstructed for our accommodation.\n\nIn one of these huts, that to the right which was allotted to\nAnscombe and myself, I found the others waiting for me, also the\nfood.  It was good of its sort and well cooked, and we ate it by\nthe light of some candles that we had with us, Kaatje serving us.\nYet, although a little while before I had been desperately\nhungry, now my appetite seemed to have left me and I made but a\npoor meal.  Heda and Anscombe also seemed oppressed and ate\nsparingly.  We did not talk much until Kaatje had taken away the\ntin plates and gone to eat her own supper by a fire that burned\noutside the hut.  Then Heda broke out, saying that she was\nterrified of this place and especially of its master, the old\ndwarf, and felt sure that something terrible was going to happen\nto her.  Anscombe did his best to calm her, and I also told her\nshe had nothing to fear.\n\n\"If there is nothing to fear, Mr. Quatermain,\" she answered,\nturning on me, \"why do you look so frightened yourself?  By your\nface you might have seen a ghost.\"\n\nThis sudden and singularly accurate thrust, for after all I had\nseen something that looked very like a ghost, startled me, and\nbefore I could invent any soothing and appropriate fib, Nombe\nappeared, saying that she had come to lead Heda to her\nsleeping-place.  After this further conversation was impossible\nsince, although Nombe knew but few words of English, she was a\ngreat thought-reader and I feared to speak of anything secret in\nher presence.  So we all went out of the hut, Nombe and I drawing\nback a little to the fire while the lovers said good-night to\neach other.\n\n\"Nombe,\" I said, \"the Inkosikazi Heddana is afraid.  The rocks of\nthis kloof lie heavy on her heart; the face of the Opener of\nRoads is fearful to her and his laughter grates upon her ears.\nDo you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand, Macumazahn, and it is as I expected.  When you\nyourself are frightened it is natural that she, an untried\nmaiden, should be frightened also in this home of spirits.\"\n\n\"It is men we fear, not spirits, now when all Zululand is boiling\nlike a pot,\" I replied angrily.\n\n\"Have it as you will, Macumazahn,\" she said, and at that moment\nher quiet, searching eyes and fixed smile were hateful to me.\n\"At least you admit that you do fear.  Well, for the lady Heddana\nfear nothing.  I sleep across the door of her hut, and while I\nwho have learned to love her, live, I say--for her fear nothing,\nwhatever may chance or whatever you may see or hear.\"\n\n\"I believe you, but, Nombe, you might die.\"\n\n\"Yes, I may die, but be sure of this, that when I die she will be\nsafe, and he who loves her also.  Sleep well, Macumazahn, and do\nnot dream too much of what you heard and saw in Zikali's house.\"\n\nThen before I could speak she turned and left me.\n\nI did _not_ sleep well; I slept very badly.  To begin with,\nMaurice Anscombe, generally the most cheerful and nonchalant of\nmortals with a jest for every woe, was in a most depressed\ncondition, and informed me of it several times, while I was\ngetting ready to turn in.  He said he thought the place hateful\nand felt as if people he could not see were looking at him (I had\nthe same sensation but did not mention the fact to him).  When I\ntold him he was talking stuff, he only replied that he could not\nhelp it, and pointed out that it was not his general habit to be\ndowncast in any danger, which was quite true.  Now, he added, he\nwas enjoying much the same sensations as he did when first he saw\nthe Yellow-wood Swamp and got the idea into his head that he\nwould kill some one there, which happened in due course.\n\n\"Do you mean that you think you are going to kill somebody else?\"\nI asked anxiously.\n\n\"No,\" he answered, \"I think I am going to be killed, or something\nlike it, probably by that accursed old villain of a witch-doctor,\nwho I don't believe is altogether human.\"\n\n\"Others have thought that before now, Anscombe, and to be plain,\nI don't know that he is.  He lives too much with the dead to be\nlike other people.\"\n\n\"And with Satan, to whom I expect he makes sacrifices.  The truth\nis I'm afraid of his playing some of his tricks with Heda.  It is\nfor her I fear, not for myself, Allan.  Oh! why on earth did you\ncome here?\"\n\n\"Because you wished it and it seemed the safest thing to do.\nLook here, my boy, as usual the trouble comes through a woman.\nWhen a man's single--you know the rest.  You used to be able to\nlaugh at anything, but now that you are practically double you\ncan't laugh any more.  Well, that's the common lot of man and\nyou've got to put up with it.  Adam was pretty jolly in his\ngarden until Eve was started, but you know what happened\nafterwards.  The rest of his life was a compound of temptation,\nanxiety, family troubles, remorse, hard labour with primitive\ninstruments, and a flaming sword behind him.  If you had left\nyour Eve alone you would have escaped all this.  But you see you\ndidn't, and as a matter of fact, nobody ever does who is worth\nhis salt, for Nature has arranged it so.\"\n\n\"You appear to talk with experience, Allan,\" he retorted blandly.\n\"By the way, that girl Nombe, when she isn't star-gazing or\nmuttering incantations, is always trying to explain to Heda some\ntale about you and a lady called Mameena.  I gather that you were\nintroduced to her in this neighbourhood where, Nombe says, you\nwere in the habit of kissing her in public, which sounds an odd\nkind of a thing to do; all of which happened before she, Nombe,\nwas born.  She adds, according to Kaatje's interpretation, that\nyou met her again this afternoon, which, as I understand the\nyoung woman has been long dead, seems so incomprehensible that I\nwish you would explain.\"\n\n\"With reference to Heda,\" I said, ignoring the rest as unworthy\nof notice, \"I think you may make your mind easy.  Zikali knows\nthat she is in my charge and I don't believe that he wants to\nquarrel with me.  Still, as you are uncomfortable here, the best\nthing to do will be to get away as early as possible to-morrow\nmorning, where to we can decide afterwards.  And now I am going\nto sleep, so please stop arguing.\"\n\nAs I have already hinted, my attempts in the sleep line proved a\nfailure, for whenever I did drop off I was pursued by bad dreams,\nwhich resulted from lying down so soon after supper.  I heard the\ncries of desperate men in their mortal agony.  I saw a\nrain-swollen river; its waters were red with blood.  I beheld a\nvision of one who I knew by his dress to be a Zulu king, although\nI could not see his face.  He was flying and staggering with\nweariness as he fled.  A great hound followed him.  It lifted its\nhead from the spoor; it was that of Zikali set upon the hound's\nbody, Zikali who laughed instead of baying.  Then one whose\ncopper ornaments tinkled as she walked, entered beside me,\nwhispering into my ear.  \"A quarter of a hundred years have gone\nby since we talked together in this haunted kloof,\" she seemed to\nwhisper, \"and before we talk again face to face there remain to\npass of years\"--\n\nHere she ceased, though naturally I should have liked to hear the\nnumber.  But that is just where dreams break down.  They tell us\nonly of what we know, or can evolve therefrom.  Of what it is\nimpossible for us to know they tell us nothing--at least as a\ngeneral rule.\n\nI woke up with a start, and feeling stifled in that hot place and\naggravated by the sound of Anscombe's peaceful breathing, threw a\ncoat about me and, removing the door-board, crept into the air.\nThe night was still, the stars shone, and at a little distance\nthe embers of the fire still glowed.  By it was seated a figure\nwrapped in a kaross.  The end of a piece of wood that the fire\nhad eaten through fell on to the red ashes and flamed up\nbrightly.  By its light I saw that the figure was Nombe's.  The\neternal smile was still upon her face, the smile which suggested\na knowledge of hidden things that from moment to moment amused\nher soul.  Her lips moved as though she were talking to an\ninvisible companion, and from time to time, like one who acts\nupon directions, she took a pinch of ashes and blew them, either\ntowards Heda's hut or ours.  Yes, she did this when all decent\nyoung women should have been asleep, like one who keeps some\nunholy, midnight assignation.\n\nTalking with her master, Zikali, or trying to cast spells upon\nus, confound her! thought I to myself, and very silently crept\nback into the hut.  Afterwards it occurred to me that she might\nhave had another motive, namely of watching to see that none of\nus left the huts.\n\nThe rest of the night went by somehow.  Once, listening with all\nmy ears, I thought that I caught the sound of a number of men\ntramping and of some low word of command, but as I heard no more,\nconcluded that fancy had deceived me.  There I lay, puzzling over\nthe situation till my head ached, and wondering how we were to\nget clear of the Black Kloof and Zikali, and out of Zululand\nwhich I gathered was no place for white people at the moment.\n\nIt seemed to me that the only thing was to make start for Dundee\non the Natal border, and for the rest to trust to fortune.  If we\ngot into trouble over the death of Rodd, unpleasant as this would\nbe, the matter must be faced out, that was all.  For even if any\nwitness appeared against us, the man had been killed in\nself-defence whilst trying to bring about our deaths at the hands\nof Basutos.  I could see now that I was foolish not to have taken\nthis line from the first, but as I think I have already\nexplained, what weighed with me was the terror of involving these\nyoung people in a scandal which might shadow all their future\nlives.  Also some fate inch by inch had dragged me into Zululand.\nFortunately in life there are few mistakes, and even worse than\nmistakes that cannot be repaired, if the wish towards reparation\nis real and earnest.  Were it otherwise not many of us would\nescape destruction in one form or another.\n\nThus I reflected until at length light flowing faintly through\nthe smoke-hole of the hut told me that dawn was at hand.  Seeing\nit I rose quietly, for I did not wish to wake Anscombe, dressed\nand left the hut.  My object was to find Nombe, who I hoped would\nbe still sitting by the fire, and send her to Zikali with a\nmessage that I wished to speak with him at once.  Glancing round\nme in the grey dawn I saw that she was gone and that as yet no\none seemed to be stirring.  Hearing a horse snort at a little\ndistance, I made my way towards the sound and in a little bay of\nthe overhanging cliff discovered the cart and near by our beasts\ntied up with a plentiful supply of forage.  Since so far as I\ncould judge in that uncertain light, nothing seemed to be wrong\nwith them except weariness, for three of them were still lying\ndown, I walked on to the gate of the fence which surrounded\nZikali's big hut, proposing to wait there until some one appeared\nby whom I could send my message.\n\nI reached the gate which I tried and found to be fastened on its\ninner side.  Then I sat down, lit my pipe and waited.  It was\nextraordinarily lonesome in that place; at least this was the\nfeeling that came over me.  No doubt the sun was up behind the\nCeza Stronghold that I have mentioned, which towered high behind\nme, for the sky above grew light with the red rays of its rising.\nBut all the vast Black Kloof with its huge fantastic rocks was\nstill plunged in gloom, whereof the shadows seemed to oppress my\nheart, weary as I was with my wakeful night and many anxieties.\nI was horribly nervous also and, as it proved, not without\nreason.  Presently I heard rustlings on the further side of the\nfence as of people creeping about cautiously, and the sound of\nwhispering.  Then of a sudden the gate was thrown open and\nthrough it emerged about a dozen Zulu warriors, all of them\nringed men, who instantly surrounded me, seated there upon the\nground.\n\nI looked at them and they looked at me for quite a long while,\nsince following my usual rule, I determined not to be the first\nto speak.  Moreover, if they meant to kill me there was no use in\nspeaking.  At length their leader, an elderly man with thin legs,\na large stomach and a rather pleasant countenance, saluted\npolitely, saying--\n\n\"Good morning, O Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"Good morning, O Captain, whose name and business I do not know,\"\nI answered.\n\n\"The winds know the mountain on which they blow, but the mountain\ndoes not know the winds which it cannot see,\" he remarked with\npoetical courtesy; a Zulu way of saying that more people are\nacquainted with Tom Fool than Tom Fool is aware of.\n\n\"Perhaps, Captain; yet the mountain can feel the winds,\" and I\nmight have added, smell them, for the Kloof was close and these\nKaffirs had not recently bathed.\n\n\"I am named Goza and come on an errand from the king, O\nMacumazahn.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Goza, and is your errand to cut my throat?\"\n\n\"Not at present, Macumazahn, that is, unless you refuse to do\nwhat the king wishes.\"\n\n\"And what does the king wish, Goza?\"\n\n\"He wishes, Macumazahn, that you, his friend, should visit him.\"\n\n\"Which is just what I was on my way to do, Goza.\"  (This was not\ntrue, but it didn't matter, for, if a lie, in the words of the\nschoolgirl's definition, is an abomination to the Lord, it is a\nvery present help in time of trouble.)  \"After we have eaten I\nand my friends will accompany you to the king's kraal at Ulundi.\"\n\n\"Not so, Macumazahn.  The king said nothing about your friends,\nof whom I do not think he has ever heard any more than we have.\nMoreover, if your friends are white, you will do well not to\nmention them, since the order is that all white people in\nZululand who have not come here by the king's desire, are to be\nkilled at once, except yourself, Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"Is it so, Goza?  Well, as you will have understood, I am quite\nalone here and have no friends.  Only I did not wish to travel so\nearly.\"\n\n\"Of course we understand that you are quite alone and have no\nfriends, is it not so, my brothers?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, we understand,\" they exclaimed in chorus, one of them\nadding, \"and shall so report to the King.\"\n\n\"What kind of blankets do you like; the plain grey ones or the\nwhite ones with the blue stripes?\" I asked, desiring to confirm\nthem in this determination.\n\n\"The grey ones are warmer, Macumazahn, and do not show dirt so\nmuch,\" answered Goza thoughtfully.\n\n\"Good, I will remember when I have the chance.\"\n\n\"The promise of Macumazahn is known from of old to be as a tree\nthat elephants cannot pull down and white ants will not eat,\"\nsaid the sententious Goza, thereby intimating his belief that\nsome time or other they would receive those blankets.  As a\nmatter of fact the survivors of the party and the families of the\nothers did receive them after the war, for in dealing with\nnatives I have always made a point of trying to fulfil any\npromise or engagement made for value received.\n\n\"And now,\" went on Goza, \"will the Inkosi be pleased to start, as\nwe have to travel far to-day?\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" I replied.  \"Before I leave I must eat, for who can\njourney upon yesterday's food?  Also I must saddle my horse,\ncollect what belongs to me, and bid farewell to my host, Zikali.\"\n\n\"Of meat we have plenty with us, Macumazahn, and therefore you\nwill not hunger on the way.  Your horse and everything that is\nyours shall be brought after you; since were you mounted on that\nswift beast and minded to escape, how could we catch you with our\nfeet, and did you please to shoot us with your rifle, how could\nwe who have only spears, save ourselves from dying?  As for the\nOpener of Roads, his servants have told us that he means to sleep\nall to-day that he may talk with spirits in his dreams, and\ntherefore it is useless for you to wait to bid him farewell.\nMoreover, the orders of the king are that we should bring you to\nhim at once.\"\n\nAfter this for a time there was silence, while I sat immovable\nrevolving the situation, and the Zulus regarded me with a\nbenignant interest.  Goza took his snuff-box from his ear, shook\nout some into the palm of his hand and, after offering it to me\nin vain, inhaled it himself.\n\n\"The orders of the king are (sneeze) that we should bring you to\nhim alive if possible, and if not (sneeze) dead.  Choose which\nyou will, Macumazahn.  Perhaps you may prefer to go to Ulundi\ndead, which would--ah! how strong is this snuff, it makes me weep\nlike a woman--save you the trouble of walking.  But if you prefer\nthat we should carry you, be so good, Macumazahn, first to write\nthe words which will cause the grey blankets to be delivered to\nus, for we know well that even your bones would desire to keep\nyour promise.  Is it not a proverb in the land from the time of\nthe slaying of Bangu when you gave the cattle you had earned to\nSaduko's wanderers?\"\n\nI listened and an idea occurred to me, as perhaps it had to Goza.\n\n\"I hear you, Goza,\" I said, \"and I will start for Ulundi on my\nfeet--to save _you_ the trouble of carrying me.  But as the times\nare rough and accidents may always happen; as, too, I wish to\nmake sure that you should get those blankets, and it may chance\nthat I shall arrive there on my back, first I will write words\nwhich, if they are delivered to the witch-doctoress Nombe, will,\nsooner or later, turn into blankets.\"\n\n\"Write the words quickly, Macumazahn, and they will be\ndelivered,\" said Goza.\n\nSo I drew out my pocket-book and wrote--\n\n\n\"DEAR ANSCOMBE,--\n\n\"There is treachery afoot and I think that Zikali is at the\nbottom of it.  I am being carried off to Cetewayo at Ulundi, by a\nparty of armed Zulus who will not allow me to communicate with\nyou, probably by Zikali's orders.  You must do the best you can\nfor Heda and yourself.  Escape to Natal if you are able.  Of\ncourse I will help if I get the chance, but if war is about to\nbreak out Cetewayo may kill me.  I think that you can trust\nNombe; also that Zikali does not wish to work you any ill unless\nhe is obliged, though I have no doubt that he has trapped us here\nfor some dark purpose of his own.  Tell him through Nombe that if\nharm comes to you I will kill him if I live, and that if I die, I\nwill settle the score with him afterwards.  God save and bless\nyou both.  Keep up your courage and use your wits.\n\n\"Your friend,\n\n\"A. Q.\"\n\n\nI tore out the sheet, folded, addressed it and presented it to\nGoza, remarking that although it seemed to be but paper, it\nreally was fourteen blankets--if given at once to Nombe.\n\nHe nodded and handed it to one of his men, who departed in the\ndirection of our huts.  So, thought I to myself, Nombe knows all\nabout this business, which means that it is being worked by\nZikali.  That is why she spoke to me as she did last night.\n\n\"It is time to start, Macumazahn, and I think you told us that\nyou would prefer to do so on your feet,\" said Goza, looking\nsuggestively at his spear.\n\n\"I am ready,\" I said, rising because I must.  For a moment I\ncontemplated the door in the kraal fence, wondering whether it\nwould be safe to bolt through it and take refuge with Zikali.\nNo, it was not safe, since Zikali sat there in his hut pulling\nthe strings and probably might refuse to see me.  Moreover, it\nwas likely enough that before I could find him one of those broad\nspears would find my heart.  There was nothing to be done except\nsubmit.  Still I did call out in a loud voice--\n\n\"Farewell, Zikali.  I leave you without a present against my will\nwho am being taken by soldiers to visit the king at Ulundi.  When\nwe meet again I will talk all this matter over with you.\"\n\nThere was no answer, and as Goza took the opportunity to say that\nhe disliked the noise of shouting extremely, which sometimes made\nhim do things that he afterwards regretted, I became silent.\nThen we departed, I in the exact centre of that guard of Zulus,\nheavy-hearted and filled with fears both for myself and those I\nleft behind me.\n\nDown the Black Kloof we tramped, emerging on the sunlit plain\nbeyond without meeting any one.  A couple of miles further on we\ncame to a small stream where Goza announced we would halt to eat.\nSo we ate of cold toasted meat which one of the men produced from\na basket he carried, unpalatable food but better than nothing.\nJust as we had finished I looked up and saw the soldier to whom\nmy note had been given.  He was leading my mare that had been\nsaddled.  On it were my large saddle-bags packed with my\nbelongings, also my thick overcoat, mackintosh, waterbottle, and\nother articles down to a bag of tobacco, a spare pipe and a box\nof wax matches.  Moreover, the man carried my double-barrelled\nExpress rifle and a shot-gun that could be used for ball,\ntogether with two bags of cartridges.  Practically nothing\nbelonging to me had been forgotten.\n\nI asked him who had collected the things.  He replied the\ndoctress Nombe had done so and had brought him the horse saddled\nto carry them.  He did not know who saddled the horse as he had\nseen no one but Nombe to whom he had given the writing which she\nhid away.  In answer to further questions, he said that Nombe had\nsent me a message.  It was--\n\n\"I bid farewell to Macumazahn for a little while and wish him\ngood fortune till we meet again.  Let him not be afraid in the\nbattle, for even if he is hurt it will not be to death, since\nthose go with him whom he cannot see, and protect him with their\nshields.  Say to Macumazahn that I, Nombe, remember in the\nmorning what I said in the night and that what seems to be quite\nlost is ofttimes found again.  Wish him good fortune and tell him\nI am sorry that I had not time to cause his spare garments to be\ncleansed with water, but that I have been careful to find his\nlittle box with the white man's medicines.\"\n\nI could extract nothing more from this soldier, who was either\nvery stupid, or chose to appear so; nor indeed did I dare to put\ndirect questions about the cart and those who travelled in it.\n\nSoon we marched again, for Goza would not allow me to ride the\nhorse, fearing that I should escape on it.  Nor would he let me\ncarry either of the guns lest I should make use of them.  All day\nwe travelled, reaching the Nongoma heights in the late afternoon.\nOn this beautiful spot we found a kraal situated where afterwards\na magistracy was built when we conquered the country, whence\nthere is one of the finest views in Zululand.  There was no one\nin the kraal except two old women who appeared to be deaf and\ndumb for all I could get out of them.  These aged dames, however,\nor others who were hidden, had made ready for our arrival, since\na calf lay skinned and prepared for cooking, and by it big gourds\nfilled with Kaffir beer and \"maas\" or curdled milk.\n\nIn due course we ate of these provisions, and after we had\nfinished I gave Goza a stiff tot of brandy, of which Nombe, or\nperhaps Anscombe, had thoughtfully sent a bottle with my other\nbaggage.  The strong liquor made the old fellow talkative and\nenabled me to get a good deal of information out of him.  Thus I\nlearned that certain demands, as to which he was rather vague,\nhad been made upon Cetewayo by the English Government, and that\nthe King was now considering whether he should accede to them or\nfight.  The Great Council of the nation was summoned to attend at\nUlundi within a few days, when the matter would be decided.\nMeanwhile all the regiments were being gathered, or, as we should\nsay, mobilized; an army, said Goza, greater than any that Chaka\nhad ever led.\n\nI asked him what I had to do with this business, that I, a\npeaceful traveller and an old friend of the Zulus, should be made\nprisoner and dragged off to Ulundi.  He replied he did not know\nwho was not in the council of the High Ones, but he thought that\nCetewayo the king wished to see me because I was their friend,\nperhaps that he might send me as a messenger to the white people.\nI asked him how the king knew that I was in the country, to which\nhe replied that Zikali had told him I was coming, he did not know\nhow, whereon he, Goza, was sent at once to fetch me.  I could get\nno more out of him.\n\nI wondered if it would be worth while to make him quite drunk and\nthen attempt to escape on the horse, but gave up the idea.  To\nbegin with, his men were at hand and there was not enough brandy\nto make them all drunk.  Also even if I succeeded in winning away\nhere in the heart of Zululand, it would not help Anscombe or Heda\nand I should probably be cut off and killed before I could get\nout of the country.  So I abandoned the plan and went to sleep\ninstead.\n\nNext morning we left Nongoma early in the hope of reaching Ulundi\nthat evening if the Ivuna and Black Umfolozi Rivers proved\nfordable.  As it chanced, although they were high, we were able\nto cross them, I seated on the horse which two of the Zulus led.\nNext we tramped for miles through the terrible Bekameezi Valley,\na hot and desolate place which the Zulus swear is haunted.  So\nunhealthy is this valley, which is the home of large game, that\nwhole kraals full of people who have tried to cultivate the rich\nland, have died in it of fever, or fled away leaving their crops\nunreaped.  Now no man dwells there.  After this we climbed a\nterrible mount to the high land of Mahlabatini, and having eaten,\npushed on once more.\n\nAt length we sighted the great hill-encircled plain of Ulundi\nwhich may be called the cradle of the Zulu race as, politically\nspeaking, it was destined to be its coffin.  On the ridge to the\nwest once stood the Nobamba kraal where dwelt Senzangacona, the\nfather of Chaka the Lion.  Nearer to the White Umfolozi was\nPanda's dwelling-place, Nodwengu, which once I knew so well,\nwhile on the slope of the hills of the north-east stood the town\nof Ulundi in which Cetewayo dwelt, bathed in the lights of\nsunset.\n\nIndeed it and all the vast plain were red as though with blood,\nred as they were destined to be on the coming day of the last\nbattle of the Zulus.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\n\n\nCETEWAYO\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was dark when at last we reached the Ulundi kraal, for the\ngrowing moon was obscured by clouds.  Therefore I could see\nnothing and was only aware, by the sound of voices and the\ncontinual challenging, that we were passing through great numbers\nof men.  At length we were admitted at the eastern gate and I was\ntaken to a hut where I at once flung myself down to sleep, being\nso weary that I could not attempt to eat.  Next morning as I was\nfinishing my breakfast in the little fenced courtyard of this\nguest-hut, Goza appeared and said that the king commanded me to\nbe brought to him at once, adding that I must \"speak softly\" to\nhim, as he was \"very angry.\"\n\nSo off we went across the great cattle kraal where a regiment of\nyoung men, two thousand strong or so, were drilling with a fierce\nintensity which showed they knew that they were out for more than\nexercise.  About the sides of the kraal also stood hundreds of\nsoldiers, all of them talking and, it seemed to me, excited, for\nthey stamped upon the ground and even jumped into the air to give\npoint to their arguments.  Suddenly some of them caught sight of\nme, whereon a tall, truculent fellow called out--\n\n\"What does a white man at Ulundi at such a time, when even John\nDunn dare not come?  Let us kill him and send his head as a\npresent to the English general across the Tugela.  That will\nsettle this long talk about peace or war.\"\n\nOthers of a like mind echoed this kind proposal, with the result\nthat presently a score or so of them made a rush at me,\nbrandishing their sticks, since they might not carry arms in the\nroyal kraal.  Goza did his best to keep them off, but was swept\naside like a feather, or rather knocked over, for I saw him on\nhis back with his thin legs in the air.\n\n\"You must climb out of this pit by yourself,\" he began,\naddressing me in his pompous and figurative way.  Then somebody\nstamped on his face, and fixing his teeth in his assailant's\nheel, he grew silent for a while.\n\nThe truculent blackguard, who was about six feet three high and\nhad a mouth like a wolf's throat, arrived in front of me and,\nbending down, roared out--\n\n\"We are going to kill you, White Man.\"\n\nI had a pistol in my pocket and could perfectly well have killed\nhim, as I was much tempted to do.  A second's reflection showed\nme, however, that this would be useless, and in a sense put me in\nthe wrong, though when the matter came on for argument it would\ninterest me no more.  So I just folded my arms and, looking up at\nhim, said--\n\n\"Why, Black Man?\"\n\n\"Because your face is white,\" he roared.\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"because your heart is black and your eyes are\nso full of blood that you do not know Macumazahn when you see\nhim.\"\n\n\"Wow!\" said one, \"it is Watcher-by-Night whom our fathers knew\nbefore us.  Leave him alone.\"\n\n\"No,\" shouted the great fellow, \"I will send him to watch where\nit is always night, I who keep a club for white rats,\" and he\nbrandished his stick over me.\n\nNow my temper rose.  Watching my opportunity, I stretched out my\nright foot and hooked him round the ankle, at the same time\nstriking up with all my force.  My fist caught him beneath the\nchin and over he went backwards sprawling on the ground.\n\n\"Son of a dog!\"  I said, \"if a single stick touches me, at least\nyou shall go first,\" and whipping out my revolver, I pointed it\nat him.\n\nHe lay quiet enough, but how the matter would have ended I do not\nknow, for passion was running high, had not Goza at this moment\nrisen with a bleeding nose and called out--\n\n\"O Fools, would you kill the king's guest to whom the king\nhimself has given safe-conduct.  Surely you are pots full of\nbeer, not men.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" answered one.  \"This is the Place of Soldiers.  The\nking's house is yonder.  Give the old jackal a start of a length\nof ten assegais.  If he reaches it first, he can shake hands with\nhis friend, the king.  If not we will make him into medicine.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, run for it, Jackal,\" clamoured the others, knocking\ntheir shields with their sticks, as men do who would frighten a\nbuck, and opening out to make a road for me.\n\nNow while all this was going on, with some kind of sixth sense I\nhad noted a big man whose face was shrouded by a blanket thrown\nover his head, who very quietly had joined these drunken rioters,\nand vaguely wondered who he might be.\n\n\"I will not run,\" I said slowly, \"that I may be saved by the\nking.  Nay, I will die here, though some of you shall die first.\nGo to the king, Goza, and tell him how his servants have served\nhis guest,\" and I lifted my pistol, waiting till the first stick\ntouched me to put a bullet through the bully on the ground.\n\n\"There is no need,\" said a deep voice that proceeded from the\ndraped man of whom I have spoken, \"for the king has come to see\nfor himself.\"\n\nThen the blanket was thrown back, revealing Cetewayo grown fat\nand much aged since last I saw him, but undoubtedly Cetewayo.\n\n\"Bayete!\" roared the mob in salute, while some of those who had\nbeen most active in the tumult tried to slip away.\n\n\"Let no man stir,\" said Cetewayo, and they stood as though they\nwere rooted to the ground, while I slipped my pistol back into my\npocket.\n\n\"Who are you, White Man?\" he asked, looking at me, \"and what do\nyou here?\"\n\n\"The King should know Macumazahn,\" I answered, lifting my hat,\n\"whom Dingaan knew, whom Panda knew well, and whom the King knew\nbefore he was a king.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know you,\" he answered, \"although since we spoke together\nyou have shrunk like an oxhide in the sun, and time has stained\nyour beard white.\"\n\n\"And the King has grown fat like the ox on summer grass.  As for\nwhat I do here, did not the King send for me by Goza, and was I\nnot brought like a baby in a blanket.\"\n\n\"The last time we met,\" he went on, taking no heed of my words,\n\"was yonder at Nodwengu when the witch Mameena was tried for\nsorcery, she who made my brother mad and brought about the great\nbattle, in which you fought for him with the Amawombe regiment.\nDo you not remember how she kissed you, Macumazahn, and took\npoison between the kisses, and how before she grew silent she\nspoke evil words to me, saying that I was doomed to pull down my\nown House and to die as she died, words that have haunted me ever\nsince and now haunt me most of all?  I wish to speak to you\nconcerning them, Macumazahn, for it is said in the land that this\nbeautiful witch loved you alone and that you only knew her mind.\"\n\nI made no reply, who was heartily tired of this subject of\nMameena whom no one seemed able to forget.\n\n\"Well,\" he went on, \"we will talk of that matter alone, since it\nis not natural that you should wish to speak of your dead\ndarlings before the world,\" and with a wave of the hand he put\nthe matter aside.  Then suddenly his attitude changed.  His face,\nthat had been thoughtful and almost soft, became fierce, his form\nseemed to swell and he grew terrible.\n\n\"What was that dog doing?\" he asked of Goza, pointing to the\nbrute whom I had knocked down and who still lay prostrate on his\nback, afraid to stir.\n\n\"O King,\" answered Goza, \"he was trying to kill Macumazahn\nbecause he is a white man, although I told him that he was your\nguest, being brought to you by the royal command.  He was trying\nto kill him by giving him a start of ten spears' length and\nmaking him run to the isigodhlo (the king's house) and beating\nhim to death with the sticks of these men if they caught him,\nwhich, as he is old and they are young, they must have done.\nOnly the Watcher-by-Night would not run; no, although he is so\nsmall he knocked him to the earth with his fist, and there he\nlies.  That is all, O King.\"\n\n\"Rise, dog,\" said Cetewayo, and the man rose trembling with fear,\nand, being bidden, gave his name, which I forget.\n\n\"Listen, dog,\" went on the king in the same cold voice.  \"What\nGoza says is true, for I saw and heard it all with my eyes and\nears.  You would have made yourself as the king.  You dared to\ntry to kill the king's guest to whom he had given safe-conduct,\nand to stain the king's doorposts with his blood, thereby\ndefiling his house and showing him to the white people as a\nmurderer of one of them whom he had promised to protect.\nMacumazahn, do _you_ say how he shall die, and I will have it\ndone.\"\n\n\"I do not wish him to die,\" I answered, \"I think that he and\nthose with him were drunk.  Let him go, O King.\"\n\n\"Aye, Macumazahn, I will let him go.  See now, we are in the\ncentre of the cattle-kraal, and to the eastern gate is as far as\nto the isigodhlo.  Let this man have a start of ten spears'\nlength and run to the eastern gate, as he would have made\nMacumazahn run to the king's house, and let his companions, those\nwho would have hunted Macumazahn, hunt him.\n\n\"If he wins through to the gate he can go on to the Government in\nNatal and tell them of the cruelty of the Zulus.  Only then, let\nthose who hunted him be brought before me for trial and perhaps\nwe shall see how _they_ can run.\"\n\nNow the poor wretch caught hold of my hand, begging me to\nintercede for him, but soldiers who had come up dragged him away\nand, having measured the distance allowed him, set him on a mark\nmade upon the ground.  Presently at a word off he sped like an\narrow, and after him went his friends, ten or more of them.  I\nthink they caught him just by the gate doubling like a hare, or\nso the shouts of laughter from the watching regiment told me, for\nmyself I would not look.\n\n\"That dog ate his own stomach,\" said Cetewayo grimly, thereby\nindicating in native fashion that the biter had been bit or the\nengineer hoist with his petard.  \"It is long since there has been\na war in the land, and some of these young soldiers who have\nnever used an assegai save to skin an ox or cut the head from a\nchicken, shout too loud and leap too high.  Now they will be\nquieter, and while you stay here you may walk where you will in\nsafety, Macumazahn,\" he added thoughtfully.\n\nThen dismissing the matter from his mind, as we white people\ndismiss any trivial incident in a morning stroll, he talked for a\nfew minutes to the commanding officer of the regiment that was\ndrilling, who ran up to make some report to him, and walked back\ntowards the isigodhlo, beckoning me to follow with Goza.\n\nAfter waiting for a little while outside the gate in the\nsurrounding fence, a body-servant ordered us to enter, which we\ndid to find the king seated on the shady side of his big hut\nquite alone.  At a sign I also sat myself down upon a stool that\nhad been set for me, while Goza, whose nose was still bleeding,\nsquatted at my side.\n\n\"Your manners are not so good as they were once, Macumazahn,\"\nsaid Cetewayo presently, \"or perhaps you have been so long away\nfrom the royal kraal that you have forgotten its customs.\"\n\nI stared at him, wondering what he could mean, whereon he added\nwith a laugh--\n\n\"What is that in your pocket?  Is it not a loaded pistol, and do\nyou not remember that it is death to appear before the king\narmed?  Now I might kill you and have no blame, although you are\nmy guest, for who knows that you are not sent by the English\nQueen to shoot me?\"\n\n\"I ask the King's pardon,\" I said humbly enough.  \"I did not\nthink about the pistol.  Let your servants take it away.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is safer in your pocket, where I saw you place it in\nthe cattle-kraal, Macumazahn, than in their hands, which do not\nknow how to hold such things.  Moreover, I know that you are not\none who stabs in the dark, even when our peoples growl round each\nother like two dogs about to fight, and if you were, in this\nplace your life would have to pay for mine.  There is beer by\nyour side; drink and fear nothing.  Did you see the Opener of\nRoads, Goza, and if so, what is his answer to my message?\"\n\n\"O King, I saw him,\" answered Goza.  \"The Father of the doctors,\nthe friend and master of the Spirits, says he has heard the\nKing's word, yes, that he heard it as it passed the King's lips,\nand that although he is very old, he will travel to Ulundi and be\npresent at the Great Council of the nation which is to be\nsummoned on the eighth day from this, that of the full moon.  Yet\nhe makes a prayer of the King.  It is that a place may be\nprepared for him, for his people and for his servants who carry\nhim, away from this town of Ulundi, where he may sojourn quite\nalone, a decree of death being pronounced against any who attempt\nto break in upon his privacy, either where he dwells or upon his\njourney.  These are his very words, O King:\n\n\"'I, who am the most ancient man in Zululand, dwell with the\nspirits of my fathers, who will not suffer strangers to come nigh\nthem and who, if they are offended, will bring great woes upon\nthe land.  Moreover, I have sworn that while there is a king in\nZululand and I draw the breath of life, never again will I set\nfoot in a royal kraal, because when last I did so at the slaying\nof the witch, Mameena, the king who is dead thought it well to\nutter threats against me, and never more will I, the Opener of\nRoads, be threatened by a mortal.  Therefore if the King and his\nCouncil seek to drink of the water of my wisdom, it must be in\nthe place and hour of my own choosing.  If this cannot be, let me\nabide here in my house and let the King seek light from other\ndoctors, since mine shall remain as a lamp to my own heart.'\"\n\nNow I saw that these words greatly disturbed Cetewayo who feared\nZikali, as indeed did all the land.\n\n\"What does the old wizard mean?\" he asked angrily.  \"He lives\nalone like a bat in a cave and for years has been seen of none.\nYet as a bat flies forth at night, ranging far and wide in search\nof prey, so does his spirit seem to fly through Zululand.\nEverywhere I hear the same word.  It is--'What says the Opener of\nRoads?'  It is--'How can aught be done unless the Opener of Roads\nhas declared that it shall be done, he who was here before the\nBlack One (Chaka) was born, he who it is said was the friend of\nInkosi Umkulu, the father of the Zulus who died before our\ngreat-grandfathers could remember; he who has all knowledge and\nis almost a spirit, if indeed he be not a spirit?'  I ask you,\nMacumazahn, who are his friend, what does he mean, and why should\nI not kill him and be done?\"\n\n\"O King,\" I answered, \"in the days of your uncle Dingaan, when\nDingaan slew the Boers who were his guests, and thus began the\nwar between the White and the Black, I, who was a lad, heard the\nlaughter of Zikali for the first time yonder at the kraal\nUngungundhlovu, I who rode with Retief and escaped the slaughter,\nbut his face I did not see.  Many years later, in the days of\nPanda your father, I saw his face and therefore you name me his\nfriend.  Yet this friend who drew me to visit him, perhaps by\nyour will, O King, has now caused me to be brought here to Ulundi\ndoubtless by your will, O King, but against my own, for who\nwishes to come to a town where he is well-nigh slain by the first\nbrawler he meets in the cattle kraal?\"\n\n\"Yet you were not slain, Macumazahn, and perhaps you do not know\nall the story of that brawler,\" replied Cetewayo almost humbly,\nlike one who begs pardon, though the rest of what I had said he\nignored.  \"But still you are Zikali's friend, for between you and\nhim there is a rope which enabled him to draw you to Zululand,\nwhich rope I have heard called by a woman's name.  Therefore by\nthe spirit of that woman, which still can draw you like a rope, I\ncharge you, tell me--what does this old wizard mean, and why\nshould I not kill him and be rid of one who haunts my heart like\nan evil vision of the night and, as I sometimes think, is an\numtakati, an evil-doer, who would work ill to me and all my\nHouse, yes, and to all my people?\"\n\n\"How should I know what he means, O King?\" I answered with\nindignation, though in fact I could guess well enough.  \"As for\nkilling him, cannot the King kill whom he will?  Yet I remember\nthat once I heard you father ask much the same question and of\nZikali himself, saying that he was minded to find out whether or\nno he were mortal like other men.  I remember also Zikali\nanswered that there was a saying that when the Opener of Roads\ncame to the end of his road, there would be no more a king of\nZululand, as there was none when first he set foot upon his road.\nNow I have spoken, who am a white man and do not understand your\nsayings.\"\n\n\"I remember it also, Macumazahn, who was present at the time,\" he\nreplied heavily.  \"My father feared this Zikali and his father\nfeared him, and I have heard that the Black One himself, who\nfeared nothing, feared him also.  And I, too, fear him, so much\nthat I dare not make up my mind upon a great matter without his\ncounsel, lest he should bewitch me and the nation and bring us to\nnothing.\"\n\nHe paused, then turning to Goza, asked, \"Did the Opener of Roads\ntell you where he wished to dwell when he comes to visit me here\nat Ulundi?\"\n\n\"O King,\" answered Goza, \"yonder in the hills, not further away\nthan an aged man can walk in the half of an hour, is a place\ncalled the Valley of Bones, because there in the days of those\nwho went before the King, and even in the King's day, many\nevildoers have been led to die.  Zikali would dwell in this\nValley of Bones, and there and nowhere else would meet the King\nand the Great Council, not in the daylight but after sunset when\nthe moon has risen.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Cetewayo, starting, \"the place is ill-omened and,\nthey say, haunted, one that no man dares to approach after the\nfall of darkness for fear lest the ghosts of the dead should leap\nupon him gibbering.\"\n\n\"Such were the words of the Opener of Roads, O King,\" replied\nGoza.  \"There and nowhere else will he meet the King, and there\nhe demands that three huts should be built to shelter him and his\nfolk and stored with all things needful.  If this be not granted\nto him, then he refuses to visit the King or to give counsel to\nthe nation.\"\n\n\"So be it then,\" said Cetewayo.  \"Send messengers to the Opener\nof Roads, Goza, saying that what he desires shall be done.  Let\nmy command go out that under pain of death none spy upon him\nwhile he journeys hither or returns.  Let the huts be built\nforthwith, and when it is known that he is coming, let food in\nplenty be placed in them and afterwards morning by morning taken\nto the mouth of the valley.  Bid him announce his arrival and the\nhour he chooses for our meeting by messenger.  Begone.\"\n\nGoza leapt up, gave the royal salute, and retreated backwards\nfrom the presence of the king, leaving us alone.  I also rose to\ndepart, but Cetewayo motioned to me to be seated.\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" he said, \"the Great Queen's man who has come to\nNatal (Sir Bartle Frere) threatens me with war because two\nevil-doing women were taken on the Natal side of the Tugela and\nbrought back to Zululand and killed by Mehlokazulu, being the\nwives of his father, Sirayo, which was done without my knowledge.\nAlso two white men were driven away from an island in the Tugela\nRiver by some of my soldiers.\"\n\n\"Is that all, O King?\" I asked.\n\n\"No.  The Queen's man says I kill my people without trial, which\nis a lie told him by the missionaries, and that girls have been\nkilled also who refused to marry those to whom they were given\nand ran away with other men.  Also that wizards are smelt out and\nslain, which happens but rarely now; all of this contrary to the\npromises I made to Sompseu when he came to recognize me as king\nupon my father's death, and some other such small matters.\"\n\n\"What is demanded if you would avoid war, O King?\"\n\n\"Nothing less than this, Macumazahn: That the Zulu army should be\nabolished and the soldiers allowed to marry whom and when they\nplease, because, says the Queen's man, he fears lest it should be\nused to attack the English, as though I who love the English, as\nthose have done who went before me, desire to lay a finger on\nthem.  Also that another Queen's man should be sent to dwell here\nin my country, to be the eyes and ears of the English Government\nand have power with me in the land; yes, and more demands which\nwould destroy the Zulus as a people and make me, their king, but\na petty kraal-head.\"\n\n\"And what will the King answer?\" I asked.\n\n\"I know not what to answer.  The fine of two thousand cattle I\nwill pay for the killing of the women.  If it may be, I wish no\nquarrel with the English, though gladly I would have fought the\nDutch had not Sompseu stretched out his arm over their land.  But\nhow can I disband the army and make an end of the regiments that\nhave conquered in so many wars?  Macumazahn, I tell you that if I\ndid this, in a moon I should be dead.  Oh! you white people think\nthere is but one will in Zululand, that of the king.  But it is\nnot so, for he is but a single man among ten thousand thousand,\nwho lives to work the people's wish.  If he beats them with too\nthick a stick, or if he brings them to shame or does what the\nmost of them do not wish, then where is the king?  Then, I say,\nhe goes a road that was trodden by Chaka and Dingaan who were\nbefore me, yes, the red road of the assegai.  Therefore today, I\nstand like a man between two falling cliffs.  If I run towards\nthe English the Zulu cliff falls upon me.  If I run towards my\nown people, the English cliff falls upon me, and in either case I\nam crushed and no more seen.  Tell me then, Macumazahn, you whose\nheart is honest, what must I do?\"\n\nSo he spoke, wringing his hands, with tears starting to his eyes,\nand upon my word, although I never liked Cetewayo as I had liked\nhis father, Panda, perhaps because I loved his brother, Umbelazi,\nwhom he killed, and had known him do many cruel deeds, my heart\nbled for him.\n\n\"I cannot tell you, King,\" I answered, thinking that I must say\nsomething, \"but I pray you do not make war against the queen, for\nshe is the most mighty One in the whole earth, and though her\nfoot, of which you see but the little toe here in Africa, seems\nsmall to you, yet if she is angered, it will stamp the Zulus\nflat, so that they cease to be.\"\n\n\"Many have told me this, Macumazahn.  Yes, even Uhamu, the son of\nmy uncle Unzibe, or, as some say, the son of his spirit, to which\nhis mother was married after Unzibe was dead, and others\nthroughout the land, and in truth I think it myself.  But who can\nhold the army which shouts for war?  Ow! the Council must decide,\nwhich, means perhaps that Zikali will decide, for now all hang\nupon his lips.\"\n\n\"Then I am sorry,\" I exclaimed.\n\nHe looked at me shrewdly.\n\n\"Are you?  So am I.  Yet his counsel must be asked, and better\nthat it should be here in my presence than yonder secretly at the\nBlack Kloof.  I would kill him if I dared, but I dare not, who am\nsure--why I may not say--that the same sun will see his death and\nmine.\"\n\nHe waved his hand to show that the talk on this matter was ended,\nthen added--\n\n\"Macumazahn, you are my prisoner for a while, but give me your\nword that you will not try to escape and you may go where you\nwill within an hour's ride of Ulundi.  I would pay you well to\nstop here with me, but this I know you would never do should\nthere be trouble between us and your people.  Therefore I promise\nyou that if war breaks out I will send you safely to Natal, or\nperhaps sooner, as my messenger, whence doubtless you will return\nto fight against me.  Know that I have given orders that every\nother white man or woman who is found in Zululand shall be killed\nas a spy.  Even John Dunn has fled or is flying, or so I hear,\nJohn Dunn who has fed out of my hand and grown rich on my gifts.\nYou yourself would have been killed as you came from Swazi-Land\nin your cart, had not command been sent to those chiefs through\nwhose lands you passed that neither they nor their people were so\nmuch as to look at you.\"\n\nNow for one intense moment I thought, as hard as ever I had done\nin my life.  It was evident--unless he dealing very cunningly\nwith me, which I did not believe--that Cetewayo knew nothing of\nAnscombe and Heda, but thought that I had come into Zululand\nalone.  Should I or should I not tell him and beg his protection\nfor them? If I did so he might refuse or be unable to give it to\nthem far away in the midst of a savage population aflame with the\nlust of war.  As the incident of the morning showed, it was as\nmuch as he could do to protect myself, although the Zulus knew me\nfor their friend.  On the other hand no one who dwelt under\nZikali's blanket, to use the Kaffir idiom, would be touched,\nbecause he was looked on as half divine and therefore everything\nunder it down to the rat in his thatch was sacred.  Now Zikali by\nimplication and Nombe with emphasis, had promised to safeguard\nthese two.  Surely, therefore, they would run less risk in the\nBlack Kloof than here at Ulundi, if ever they got so far.\n\nAll this went through my brain in an instant, with the result\nthat I made up my mind to say nothing.  As the issue proved, this\nwas a terrible mistake, but who can always judge rightly?  Had I\nspoken out it seems to me probable that Cetewayo would have\ngranted my prayer and ordered that these two should be escorted\nout of Zululand before hostilities began, although of course they\nmight have been murdered on the way.  Also, for a reason that\nwill become evident later, it is possible that there would never\nhave been any hostilities.  All I can plead is, that I acted for\nthe best and Fate would have it so.  Another moment and the\nchance was gone.\n\nThe gate opened and a body-servant appeared announcing that one\nof the great captains with some of his officers waited to see the\nking.  Cetewayo made a sign, whereon the servant called out\nsomething, and they entered, three or four of them, saluting\nloudly.  Seeing me they stopped and stared, whereon Cetewayo\nshortly, but with much clearness, repeated to them and to an\ninduna who accompanied them, what he had already said to me,\nnamely that I was his guest, sent for by him that he might use me\nas a messenger if he thought fit.  He added that the man who\ndared to speak a word against me, or even to look at me askance,\nshould pay the price with his life, however high his station, and\nhe commanded that the heralds should proclaim this his decree\nthroughout Ulundi and the neighbouring kraals.  Then he held out\nhis hand to me in token of friendship, bidding me to \"go softly\"\nand come to see him whenever I wished, and dismissed me in charge\nof the induna, one of the captains and some soldiers.\n\nWithin five minutes of reaching my hut I heard a loud-voiced\ncrier proclaiming the order of the king and knew that I had no\nmore to fear.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\n\n\nTHE VALLEY OF BONES\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week that followed my interview with Cetewayo was indeed a\nmiserable time for me.  For myself, as I have said, I had no\nfear, for the king's orders were strictly obeyed.  Moreover, the\ntale of what had happened to the brute who wished to hunt me down\nin the cattle-kraal had travelled far and wide and none sought to\nshare his fate.  My hut was inviolate and well supplied with\nnecessary food, as was my mare, and I could wander where I liked\nand talk with whom I would.  I could even ride to exercise the\nhorse, though this I did very sparingly and only in the immediate\nneighbourhood of the town for fear of exciting suspicion or\nmeeting Zulus whom the king's word had not reached.  Indeed on\nthese occasions I was always accompanied by a guard of\nswift-footed and armed soldiers sent \"to protect me,\" or more\nprobably to kill me if I did anything that seemed suspicious.\n\nIn the course of my rambles I met sundry natives whom I had known\nin the old days, some of them a long while ago.  They all seemed\nglad to see me and were quite ready to talk of past times, but of\nthe present they would say little or nothing, except that they\nwere certain there would be war.  Of Anscombe and Heda I could\nhear nothing, and indeed did not dare to make any direct\ninquiries concerning them, but several reliable men assured me\nthat the last missionaries and traders having departed, there was\nnot a white man, woman or child left in Zululand except myself.\nIt was \"all black\" they said, referring to the colour of their\npeople, as it had been before the time of Chaka.  So I was forced\nto eat out my heart with anxiety in silence, hoping and praying\nthat Zikali had played an honest part and sent them away safely.\n\nWhy should he not have done so, seeing that it was my presence he\nhad desired, not theirs?  They were only taken, or rather snared,\nbecause they were with me and could not be separated, or so I\nbelieved at the time.\n\nOne ray of comfort I did get.  About the fifth day after my\ninterview I saw Goza, who told me that the king's messengers were\nback from the Black Kloof and had brought \"a word\" for me from\nZikali himself.  The word was--\n\n\"Bid Goza say to Macumazahn that I was sorry not to see him to\nsay good-bye, because that morning I slept heavily.  Bid him say\nthat I am glad he has seen the king, since for this purpose I\nsought his presence in Zululand.  Bid him say that he is to fear\nnothing, and that if his heart is heavy about others whom he\nloves, he should make it light again, since the Spirits have them\nin their keeping as they have him, and never were they or he more\nsafe than they are to-day.\"\n\nNow I looked at Goza and asked if I could see this messenger.  He\nreplied, No, as he had already been despatched upon another\nerrand.  Then I asked him if the messenger had said anything\nelse.  He answered, Yes, one thing that he had forgotten, namely\nthat the writing about blankets should now be in Natal.  Then\nsuddenly he changed the subject and asked me if I would like to\naccompany him to the Valley of Bones where he was ordered to\ninspect the huts which were being built for Zikali and his\npeople.  Of course I said I should, hoping, quite without result,\nthat I might get something more out of him on the road.\n\nNow this town of Cetewayo's stands, or rather stood, for it has\nlong been burnt, on the slope of the hills to the north-east of\nthe plains of Ulundi.  Above it these hills grow steeper, and\ndeep in the recesses of one of them is the Valley of Bones.\nThere is nothing particularly imposing about the place; no\ntowering cliffs or pillars of piled granite, as at the Black\nKloof.  It is just a vale cut out by water, bordered by steep\nslopes on either side, and a still steeper slope strown with\nlarge rocks at its end.  Dotted here and there on these slopes\ngrew tall aloes that from a little distance looked like scattered\nmen, whereof the lower leaves were shrivelled and blackened by\nveld fires.  Also there were a few euphorbias, grey,\nnaked-looking things that end in points like fingers on a hand,\nand among them some sparse thorn trees, struggling to live in an\ninhospitable soil.\n\nThe place has one peculiarity.  Jutting into it from the hillside\nis a ridge or spur, sixty or seventy yards in length by perhaps\ntwenty broad, that ends in a flat point of rock which stands\nabout forty feet above the level of the rest of the little\nvalley.  On this ridge also grew tall aloes until near its\nextremity the soil ceased, or had been washed away from the\nwater-worn core of rock.\n\nIt was, and no doubt still is, a desolate-looking spot, at any\nrate for most of the day when owing to the shadow of the\nsurrounding hills, it receives but little sun.  Everything about\nit, especially when I was there in a time of rain, seemed dank\nand miserable, although the flat floor of the kloof was clothed\nwith a growth of tall, coarse grass, and weeds that bore an\nevil-smelling flower.  Perhaps some sense of appropriateness had\ncaused the Zulu kings to choose this lonesome, deathly-looking\ngorge as one of their execution grounds.  At any rate many had\nbeen slain here, for skulls and the larger human bones, some of\nthem black with age, lay all about among the grass, as they had\nbeen scattered by hyenas and jackals.  They were particularly\nthick beneath and around the table-like rock that I have\nmentioned.\n\nGoza told me that this was because the King's Slayers made a\ncustom of dragging the victim along the projecting tongue to the\nedge of this rock and hurling him, either dead or living, to the\nground beneath; or, in the case of witches; driving them over\nafter they had been blinded.\n\nSuch was the spot that Zikali had selected to abide in during his\nvisit to Ulundi.  Certainly where privacy was an object it was\nwell chosen, for, as Cetewayo had said and as Goza emphasized to\nme, it had the repute of being the most thoroughly haunted place\nin all Zululand, with the sole exception, perhaps, of the ridge\nopposite to Dingaan's old kraal where once I shot the vultures\nfor my life and those of my companions.*  Even in the daytime\npeople gave it a wide berth, and at night nothing would induce\nthem to approach it, at any rate alone.\n\n[*--See the book called _Marie,_ by H. Rider Haggard.]\n\nHere to one side of and near the root of the tongue of land of\nwhich I have spoken, the huts that Zikali had demanded for\nhimself and his company were being rapidly built, close to a\nspring of water, by a large body of men who laboured as though\nthey wished to be done with their task.  Also about half way up\nthe donga, for really it was nothing more, at a distance of\nperhaps five and twenty paces from its flat point whence the\ncondemned were hurled, a circular space of ground had been\ncleared and levelled which was large enough to accommodate fifty\nor sixty men.  On this space, Goza told me, the King and the\nCouncil were to sit when they came to seek light from Zikali.\n\nIn my heart I reflected that the light they were likely to get\nfrom him would be such as may be supposed to be thrown by hell\nfire.  For be it remembered I knew what these people never seemed\nto understand, that Zikali was the most bitter of their enemies.\nTo begin with, he was of Undwandwe blood, one of the people whom\nthe great king Chaka had destroyed.  Then this same Chaka had\nrobbed him of his wives and murdered his children, in revenge for\nwhich he had plotted the slaying of Chaka, as he did that of his\nbrothers, Umhlangana and Dingaan, the latter of whom he involved\nin a quarrel with the Boers.  Subsequently he brought about the\nwar between the princes Cetewayo and Umbelazi, in which I played\na part.\n\nNow I was certain that he intended to bring about another war\nbetween the English and the Zulus, knowing well that in the end\nthe latter would be destroyed, and with them the royal House of\nSenzangacona which he had sworn to level with the dust.  Had he\nnot told me as much years ago, and was he one to go back upon his\nword?  Had he not used Mameena with her beauty and ambitions as\nhis tool, and when she was of no further service to him, given\nher to death, as he had used scores of others and in due season\ngiven them to death?  Was I not myself perhaps one of those tools\ndestined to be thrown into the pit of doom when my turn came,\nthough in what way I could help his plots was more than I could\nsee, since he knew well that I should do my best to oppose him?\nOh! I had half a mind to go to Cetewayo and tell him all I knew\nabout Zikali, even if it involved the breaking of confidences.\n\nBut stay!  Even if I were believed, this far-seeing wizard held\nhostages for my good behaviour, and if I betrayed him what would\nhappen to those hostages?  He sent me messages saying that they\nwere safe, suggesting that they had escaped to Natal.  How was I\nto know that these were true?  I was utterly bewildered; I could\nnot guess why I had been beguiled into Zululand, and I dared not\nstep either this way or that for fear lest I should fall into\nsome pit dug by his cunning hands and, what was worse, drag down\nothers with me.\n\nMoreover, was this man quite human, or perhaps an emissary of\nSatan upon earth who had knowledge denied to other men and a\ncertain mastery over the Powers of Ill?  Again I could not say.\nHis term of life seemed to be extraordinarily prolonged, though\nnone knew how old exactly he might be.  Also he had a wonderful\nknowledge of what was passing in the minds of others, and by his\narts, as I had experienced only the other day, could summon up\napparitions or illusions before their eyes.  Further, he was\naware of events which had happened at a distance and could send\nor read dreams, since otherwise how did Nombe know what I had\ndreamt at Marnham's house?  Lastly he could foretell the future,\nas once he had done in my own case, prophecying that I should be\ninjured by a buffalo with a split horn.\n\nYet all of this might be nothing more than a mixture of keen\nobservation, clever spying, trickery and mesmerism.  I could not\nsay which it was, nor can I with certainty to this hour.\n\nSuch were the thoughts that passed through my mind as I walked\nback from the Vale of Bones by the side of the big-paunched Goza,\nwhom I caught eyeing me from time to time as a curious crow eyes\nany object that has attracted his attention.\n\n\"Goza,\" I said at last, \"do the Zulus really mean to fight the\nEnglish?\"\n\nHe turned and pointed to a spot where the hills ran down into the\ngreat plain.  Here two regiments were manoeuvring.  One of these\nheld the slopes of the hill and the other was attacking them from\nthe plain, so fiercely that at a distance their onslaught looked\nlike that of actual warfare.\n\n\"That looks like fighting, does it not, Macumazahn?\" he replied.\n\n\"Yes, Goza, yet it may be but play.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Macumazahn.  It may be fighting or it may be but play.\nAm I a prophet that I should be able to say which it is?  Of that\nthere is but one man in Zululand who knows the truth.  It is he\nfor whom the new huts are being built up yonder.\"\n\n\"You think he really knows, Goza?\"\n\n\"No, Macumazahn, I do not think, I am sure.  He is the greatest\nof all wizards, as he was when my father held on to his mother's\napron.  He pulls the strings and the Great-ones of the country\ndance.  If he wishes war, there will be war.  If he wishes peace,\nthere will be peace.\"\n\n\"And which does he wish, Goza?\"\n\n\"I thought perhaps you could tell me that, Macumazahn, who, he\nsays, are such an old friend of his; also why he chooses to\nsojourn in a dark hole among the dead instead of in the sunshine\namong the living, here at Ulundi.\"\n\n\"Well, I cannot, Goza, since the Opener of Roads does not open\nhis heart to me but keeps his secrets to himself.  For the rest,\nthose who talk with the dead may prefer to dwell among the dead.\"\n\n\"Now as always you speak truth, Macumazahn,\" said Goza, looking\nat me in a way which suggested to me that he believed I spoke\nanything but the truth.\n\nIndeed I am convinced he thought that I was in the council of\nZikali and acquainted with his plans.  Also I am sure he knew\nthat I had not come to Zululand alone, the incident of the\nblankets, which I had promised to him a bribe to keep silence,\nshowed it, and suspected that my companions were parties to some\nplot together with myself.  And yet at the time I could not be\nquite sure, and therefore dared not ask anything concerning them\nlest thus I should reveal their existence and bring them to\ndeath.\n\nAs a matter of fact I need not have been anxious on this point,\nsince if Goza, who I may state, was a kind of secret service\nofficer as well as a head messenger, knew, as I think probable,\nhe had been commanded by Zikali to hold his tongue under penalty\nof a curse.  Perhaps the same was true of the soldiers who had\ncome with him to take me to Ulundi.  The hint of Zikali was as\npowerful as the word of the king, since they, like thousands of\nothers, believed that whereas Cetewayo could kill them, Zikali,\nlike Satan, could blast their spirits as well as their bodies.\nBut how was I to guess all these things at that time?\n\n\nDuring the next two days nothing happened, though I heard that\nthere had been one if not two meetings of the Council at the\nKing's House during which the position of affairs was discussed.\nCetewayo I did not see, although twice he sent messengers to me\nbringing gifts of food, who were charged to inquire whether I was\nwell and happy and if any had offered me hurt or insult.  To\nthese I answered that I was well and unmolested but not happy,\nwho grew lonesome, being but a solitary white man among so many\nthousands of the Zulus.\n\nOn the third morning, that of the day of the full moon, Goza came\nand informed me that Zikali had arrived at the Valley of Bones\nbefore dawn.  I asked him how he, who was so old and feeble, had\nwalked so far.  He answered that he had not walked, or so he\nunderstood, but had been carried in a litter, or rather in two\nlitters, one for himself and one for his \"spirit.\" This staggered\nme even where Zikali was concerned, and I inquired what on earth\nGoza meant.\n\n\"Macumazahn, how can I tell you who only know what I myself am\ntold?\" he exclaimed.  \"Such is the report that the Opener of\nRoads has made himself by messengers to the king.  None have seen\nhim, for he journeys only in the night.  Moreover, when Zikali\npasses all men are blind and even women's tongues grow dumb.\nPerchance by 'his spirit' he means his medicine or the\nwitch-doctoress, Nombe, whom folks say he created, since none\nhave seen her father or her mother, or heard who begat her; or\nperchance his snake is hid behind the mats of the second litter,\nif in truth there was one.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" I said, feeling that it was useless to pursue the\nmatter.  \"Now, Goza, I would see Zikali and at once.\"\n\n\"That cannot be, Macumazahn, since he has given out that he will\nsee no one, who rests after his journey, and the king has issued\norders that any who attempt to approach the Valley of Bones shall\ndie, even if they be of the royal blood.  Yes, if so much as a\ndog dares to draw near that place, it must die.  The soldiers who\nring it round have killed one already, so strict are the orders,\nalso a boy who went towards it searching for a calf, which I\nthink a bad omen.\"\n\n\"Then I will send a message to him,\" I persisted.\n\n\"Do so,\" mocked Goza.  \"Look, yonder sails a vulture.  Ask it to\ntake your message, for nothing else will.  Be not foolish,\nMacumazahn, but have patience, for to-night you shall see the\nOpener of Roads when he attends the Council of the king in the\nValley of Bones.  This is the order of the king--that at the\nrising of the moon I lead you thither, so that you may be present\nat the Council in case he wishes to ask you any questions about\nthe White People or to give you any message to the Government in\nNatal.  Therefore at sunset I will come for you.  Till then,\nfarewell.  I have business that cannot wait.\"\n\n\"Can I see the king?\" I cried.\n\n\"Not so, Macumazahn.  All to-day he makes sacrifice to the\nspirits of his ancestors and must not be approached,\" Goza called\nback as he departed.\n\nAvailing myself of the permission of the king to go where I\nwould, a little later in the day I walked out of the town towards\nthe Valley of Bones in order to ascertain for myself whether what\nGoza had told me was true.  So it proved, for about three hundred\nyards from the mouth of the valley, which at that distance looked\nlike a black hole in the hills, I found soldiers stationed about\nten paces apart in a great circle which ran right up the hillside\nand vanished over the crest.  Strolling up to one of these, whose\nface I thought I knew, I asked him if he would let me pass to see\nmy friend, the Opener of Roads.\n\nThe man, who was something of a humourist replied--\n\n\"Certainly if you wish, Macumazahn.  That is to say, I will let\nyour spirit pass, but to do this, if you come one step nearer I\nmust first make a hole in you with my spear out of which it can\nfly.\"\n\nI thanked him for his information and gave him some snuff, which\nhe took gratefully, being bored by his long vigil.  Then I asked\nhim how many people the great witch-doctor had with him.  He said\nhe did not know, but he had seen a number of tall men come to the\nmouth of the donga to fetch food that had been placed there.\nAgain I inquired if he had seen any women, whereon he replied\nnone, Zikali being, he understood, too old to trouble himself\nabout the other sex.  Just then an officer, making his rounds,\ncame up and looked at me so sternly that I thought it well to\nretreat.  Evidently there was no chance of getting through that\nline.\n\nOn my way back I walked as near the fence of the King's House as\nI dared, and saw witch-doctors passing in and out in their\nhideous official panoply.  This told me that here also Goza had\nspoken the truth--the king was performing magical ceremonies,\nwhich meant that it would be impossible to approach him.  In\nevery direction I met with failure.  The Fates were against me;\nit lay over me like a spell.  Indeed I grew superstitious and\nbegan to think that Zikali had bewitched me, as he was said to\nhave the power to do.  Well, perhaps he had, for the mere fact of\nfinding myself opposed by this persistent wall of difficulties\nand silence convinced me that there was something behind it to be\nlearned.\n\nI went back very dejected to my hut and talked to my mare which\nwhinnied and rubbed its nose against me, for although it was well\nfed and looked after, the poor beast seemed as lonely as I was\nmyself.  No wonder, since like myself it was separated from all\nits kind and weary of inaction.  After this I ate and smoked and\nfinally dozed, no more, for whenever I tried to go to sleep I\nthought that I heard Zikali laughing at me, as mayhap he was\ndoing yonder in his hut.\n\nAt length that wearisome day drew towards its end.  The sun began\nto sink, a huge red ball of fire, now and again veiled by clouds,\nfor the sky was stormy.  Its fierce rays, striking upon other\nclouds, peopled the enormous heavens with fantastic shapes of\nlight which were thickest over the hills wherein was the Valley\nof Bones.  To my strained mind these clouds looked like battling\narmies, figures of flame warring against figures of darkness.\nThe darkness won; no, the light broke out again and conquered it.\nAnd see, there above them both squatted a strange black presence\ncrowned with fire.  It might have been that of Zikali magnified\nten thousand times, and hark! it laughed with the low\nreverberating voice of distant thunder.\n\nSuddenly I felt that I was no longer alone and looking round, saw\nGoza at my side.\n\n\"What do you see up there, Macumazahn, that you stare so hard?\"\nhe asked, pointing at the sky with his stick.\n\n\"Impis fighting,\" I answered briefly.\n\n\"Then you must be a 'heaven-doctor,' Macumazahn, for I only see\nblack and red clouds.  Well, it is time to go to learn whether or\nno the impis will fight, for Zikali awaits us and the Council has\nstarted already.  By the way, the king says that you will do well\nto put your pistol in your pocket in case any should seek to harm\nyou in the dark.\"\n\n\"It is there.  But, Goza, I pray you to protect me, since in the\ndark bullets fly wide, and if I began to shoot, one might hit\nyou, Goza.\"\n\nHe smiled, making no answer, but I noticed that during the rest\nof that night he was careful to keep behind me as much as\npossible.\n\nOur way led us through the town where everybody seemed to be\nstanding about doing nothing and speaking very little.  There was\na curious air of expectancy upon their faces.  They knew that the\ncrisis was at hand, that their nation's fate hung upon the\nscales, and they watched my every look and movement as though in\nthem they expected to read an omen.  I too watched them out of\nthe corners of my eyes, wondering whether I should escape from\ntheir savage company alive.  If once the blood lust broke out\namong them, it seemed to me that I should have about as much\nchance as a chopped fox among a pack of hungry hounds.\n\nOnce out of the town we saw no one until we came to the circle of\nguards which I have already mentioned, who stood there like an\nendless line of black statues.  In answer to their challenge Goza\ngave some complicated password in which my name occurred, whereon\nthey opened out and let us through.  Then we marched on to the\nmouth of the kloof.  The place was very dark, for now the sun was\ndown in the west and the moon in the east was cut off from us by\nthe hills and would not be visible here for half an hour or more.\nPresently I saw a spot of light.  It was a small fire burning\nnear the tongue of rock which I have described.\n\nAt a distance, in front of the fire on the patch of prepared\nground, squatted a number of men, between twenty and thirty of\nthem, in a semicircle.  They were wrapped up in karosses and\nblankets, and in their centre sat a large figure on a chair of\nwood.\n\n\"The King and the Great Council,\" whispered Goza.\n\nOne of them looked round and saw us.  At some sign from the king\nhe rose, and against the fire I saw that he was the Prime\nMinister, Umnyamana.  He came to me and, with a nod of\nrecognition, conducted me some paces to the right where a\neuphorbia tree grew among the rank herbage.  Here I found a stool\nplaced ready on which I sat down, Goza, who of course was not of\nthe Council, squatting at my side in the grass.\n\nNow I found that I was so situated that I could not well be seen\nfrom the fire, or even from the rock above it, while I, by moving\nmy head a little, could see both quite clearly.  After this as\nthe last reflection from the sunk sun faded, the darkness\nincreased until nothing remained visible except the fire and the\nmassive outline of the rock behind.  The silence was complete,\nfor none of the Council spoke.  They were so still that they\nmight have been dead, so still that a beetle suddenly booming\npast me made me start as though it had been a bullet.  The\ngeneral impression was almost mesmeric.  I felt as though I were\ngoing to sleep and yet my mind remained painfully awake, so that\nI was able to think things out.\n\nI understood clearly that the body of men to my left had come\ntogether to decide whether there should be peace or war; that\nthere were divisions of opinion among them; that the king was\nready to follow the party which should prove itself the\nstrongest, but that the real voice of decision would speak from\nbehind that fire.  It was the case of the Delphic Oracle over\nagain with a priest instead of a priestess, and what a priest!\n\nIt was evident to me also that Zikali, who knew human nature, and\nespecially savage human nature, had arranged all this with a view\nto scenic and indeed supernatural effect.  Moreover, he had done\nit very well, since I knew myself that in this place and hour\nwords and occurrences would affect me deeply at which I should\nhave laughed in the sunlight and open plain.  Already the Zulus\nwere affected, for I could hear the teeth of some of them\nchattering, and Goza began to shiver at my side.  He muttered\nthat it was cold, and lied for the donga was extremely hot and\nstuffy.\n\nAt length the silver radiance of the moon spread itself on the\nhigh curtain of the dark.  Then the edge of her orb appeared\nabove the hill and an arrow of white light fell into the little\nvalley.  It struck upon and about the jutting rock, revealing a\nmisshapen, white-headed figure squatted between its base and the\nfire, the figure of Zikali.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT COUNCIL\n\n\n\n\n\nNone had seen or heard him come, and though doubtless he had but\ncrept round the rock and taken his place in the darkness, there\nappeared to be something mysterious about this sudden appearance\nof Zikali.  So the Zulu nobles thought at any rate, for they\nuttered a low \"Ow!\" of fear and wonder.\n\nThere he sat like a huge ape staring at the sky, for the\nfirelight shone on his deep and burning eyes.  The moonlight\nincreased, but now and again it was broken by little clouds which\ncaused strange shadows to appear about the rock.  Some of these\nshadows looked as though veiled figures were approaching the\nwizard, bending over him and departing again, after giving him\ntheir message or counsel.\n\n\"His Spirits visit him,\" whispered Goza, but I made no answer.\n\nThis went on for quite a long time, until the full round of the\nmoon appeared above the hill indeed, and, for the while, the\nclouds had cleared away.  Still Zikali sat silent and I, who was\nacquainted with the habits of this people, knew that I was\nwitnessing a conflict between two they considered to be\nrespectively a spiritual and an earthly king.  It is my belief\nthat unless he were first addressed, Zikali would have sat all\nnight without opening his lips.  Possibly Cetewayo would have\ndone the same if the impatience of public opinion had allowed\nhim.  At any was rate it was he who gave way.\n\n\"Makosi, master of many Spirits, on behalf of the Council and the\nPeople of the Zulus I, the King, greet you here in the place that\nyou have chosen,\" said Cetewayo.\n\nZikali made no answer.\n\nThe silence went on as before, till at length, after a pause and\nsome whispering, Cetewayo repeated his salutation, adding--\n\n\"Has age made you deaf, O Opener of Roads, that you cannot hear\nthe voice of the King?\"\n\nThen at last Zikali answered in his low voice that yet seemed to\nfill all the kloof--\n\n\"Nay, Child of Senzangacona, age has not made me deaf, but my\nspirit in these latter days floats far from my body.  It is like\na bladder filled with air that a child holds by a string, and\nbefore I can speak I must draw it from the heavens to earth\nagain.  What did you say about the place that I have chosen?\nWell, what better place could I choose, seeing that it was here\nin this very Vale of Bones that I met the first king of the\nZulus, Chaka the Wild Beast, who was your uncle?  Why then should\nI not choose it to meet the last king of the Zulus?\"\n\nNow I, listening, knew at once that this saying might be\nunderstood in two ways, namely that Cetewayo was the reigning\nking, or that he was the last king who would ever reign.  But the\nCouncil interpreted it in the latter and worse sense, for I saw a\nquiver of fear go through them.\n\n\"Why should I not choose it,\" went on Zikali, \"seeing also that\nthis place is holy to me?  Here it was, O Son of Panda, that\nChaka brought my children to be killed and forced me, sitting\nwhere you sit, to watch their deaths.  There on the rock above me\nthey were killed, four of them, three sons and a daughter, and\nthe slayers--they came to an evil end, those slayers, as did\nChaka--laughed and cast them down from the rock before me.  Yes,\nand Chaka laughed, and I too laughed, for had not the king the\nright to kill my children and to steal their mothers, and was I\nnot glad that they should be taken from the world and gathered\nto that of Spirits whence they always talk to me, yes, even now?\nThat is why I did not hear you at first, King, because they were\ntalking to me.\"\n\nHe paused, turning one ear upwards, then continued in a new and\ntender voice, \"What is it you say to me, Noma, my dear little\nNoma?  Oh! I hear you, I hear you.\"\n\nNow he shifted himself along the ground on his haunches some\npaces to the right, and began to search about, groping with his\nlong fingers.  \"Where, where?\" he muttered.  \"Oh, I understand,\nfurther under the root, a jackal buried it, did it?  Pah!  how\nhard is this soil.  Ah! I have it, but look, Noma, a stone has\ncut my finger.  I have it, I have it,\" and from beneath the root\nof some fallen tree he drew out the skull of a child and, holding\nit in his right hand, softly rubbed the mould off it with his\nleft.\n\n\"Yes, Noma, it might be yours, it is of the right size, but how\ncan I be sure?  What is it you say?  The teeth?  Ah! now I\nremember.  Only the day before you were taken I pulled out that\nfront tooth, did I not, and beneath it was another that was\nstrangely split in two.  If this skull was yours, it will be\nthere.  Come to the fire, Noma, and let us look; the moonlight is\nfaint, is it not?\"\n\nBack to the fire he shifted himself, and bending towards the\nblaze, made an examination.\n\n\"True, Noma, true!  Here is the split tooth, white as when I saw\nit all those years ago.  Oh! dear child of my body, dear child of\nmy spirit, for we do not beget with the body alone, Noma, as you\nknow better than I do to-day, I greet you,\" and pressing the\nskull to his lips, he kissed it, then set it down in front of him\nbetween himself and the fire with the face part pointing to the\nking, and burst into one of his eerie and terrible laughs.\n\nA low moan went up from his audience, and I felt the skin of\nGoza, who had shrunk against me, break into a profuse sweat.\nThen suddenly Zikali's voice changed one more and became hard and\nbusinesslike, if I may call it so, similar to that of other\nprofessional doctors.\n\n\"You have sent for me, O King, as those who went before you have\nsent when great things were about to happen.  What is the matter\non which you would speak to me?\"\n\n\"You know well, Opener of Roads,\" answered Cetewayo, rather\nshakily I thought.  \"The matter is one of peace or war.  The\nEnglish threaten me and my people and make great demands on me;\namongst others that the army should be disbanded.  I can set them\nall out if you will.  If I refuse to do as they bid me, then\nwithin a few days they will invade Zululand; indeed their\nsoldiers are already gathered at the drifts.\"\n\n\"It is not needful, King,\" answered Zikali, \"since I know what\nall know, neither more nor less.  The winds whisper the demands\nof the white men, the birds sing them, the hyenas howl them at\nnight.  Let us see how the matter stands.  When your father died\nSompseu (Sir T. Shepstone), the great white chief, came from the\nEnglish Government to name you king.  This he could not do\naccording to our law, since how can a stranger name the King of\nthe Zulus? Therefore the Council of the Nation and the doctors--I\nwas not among them, King--moved the spirit of Chaka the Lion into\nthe body of Sompseu and made him as Chaka was and gave him power\nto name you to rule over the Zulus.  So it came about that to the\nEnglish Queen through the spirit of Chaka you swore certain\nthings; that slaying for witchcraft should be abolished; that no\nman should die without fair and open trial, and other matters.\"\n\nHe paused a while, then went on, \"These oaths you have broken, O\nKing, as being of the blood you are and what you are, you must\ndo.\"\n\nHere there was disturbance among the Council and Cetewayo half\nrose from his seat, then sat down again.  Zikali, gazing at the\nsky, waited till it had died away, then went on--\n\n\"Do any question my words?  If so, then let them ask of the white\nmen whether they be true or no.  Let them ask also of the spirits\nof those who have died for witchcraft, and of the spirits of the\nwomen who have been slain and whose bodies were laid at the\ncross-roads because they married the men they chose and not the\nsoldiers to whom the king gave them.\"\n\n\"How can I ask the white men who are far away?\" broke out\nCetewayo, ignoring the rest.\n\n\"Are the white men so far away, King?  It is true that I see none\nand hear none, yet I seem to smell one of them close at hand.\"\nHere he took up the skull which he had laid down and whispered to\nit.  \"Ah! I thank you, my child.  It seems, King, that there is a\nwhite man here hidden in this kloof, he who is named Macumazahn,\na good man and a truthful, known to many of us from of old, who\ncan tell you what his people think, though he is not one of their\nindunas.  If you question my words, ask him.\"\n\n\"We know what the white men think,\" said Cetewayo, \"so there is\nno need to ask Macumazahn to sing us an old song.  The question\nis--what must the Zulus do?  Must they swallow their spears and,\nceasing to be a nation, become servants, or must they strike with\nthem and drive the English into the sea, and after them the\nBoers?\"\n\n\"Tell me first, King, who dwell far away and alone, knowing\nlittle of what passes in the land of Life, what the Zulus desire\nto do.  Before me sits the Great Council of the Nation.  Let it\nspeak.\"\n\nThen one by one the members of the Council uttered their opinions\nin order of rank or seniority.  I do not remember the names of\nall who were present, or what each of them said.  I recall,\nhowever, that Sigananda, a very old chief--he must have been over\nninety--spoke the first.  He told them that he had been friend of\nChaka and one of his captains, and had fought in most of his\nbattles.  That afterwards he had been a general of Dingaan's\nuntil that king killed the Boers under Retief, when he left him\nand finally sided with Panda in the civil war in which Dingaan\nwas killed with the help of the Boers.  That he had been present\nat the battle of the Tugela, though he took no actual part in the\nfighting, and afterwards became a councillor of Panda's and then\nof Cetewayo his son.  It was a long and interesting historical\nrecital covering the whole period of the Zulu monarchy which\nended suddenly with these words--\n\n\"I have noted, O King and Councillors, that whenever the black\nvulture of the Zulus was content to attack birds of his own\nfeather, he has conquered.  But when it has met the grey eagles\nof the white men, which come from over the sea, he has been\nconquered, and my heart tells me that as it was in the past, so\nit shall be in the future.  Chaka was a friend of the English, so\nwas Panda, and so has Cetewayo been until this hour.  I say,\ntherefore, let not the King tear the hand which fed him because\nit seems weak, lest it should grow strong and clutch him by the\nthroat and choke him.\"\n\nNext spoke Undabuko, Dabulamanzi and Magwenga, brothers of the\nking, who all favoured war, though the two last were guarded in\ntheir speech.  After these came Uhamu, the king's uncle--he who\nwas said to be the son of a Spirit--who was strong for peace,\nurging that the king should submit to the demands of the English,\nmaking the best terms he could, that he \"should bend like a reed\nbefore the storm, so that after the storm had swept by, he might\nstand up straight again, and with him all the other reeds of the\npeople of the Zulus.\"\n\nSo, too, said Seketwayo, chief of the Umdhlalosi, and more whom I\ncannot recall, six or seven of them.  But Usibebu and the induna\nUntshingwayo, who afterwards commanded at Isandhlwana, were for\nfighting, as were Sirayo, the husband of the two women who had\nbeen taken on English territory and killed, and Umbilini, the\nchief of Swazi blood whose surrender was demanded by Sir Bartle\nFrere and who afterwards commanded the Zulus in the battle at\nIhlobane.  Last of all spoke the Prime Minister, Umnyamana, who\ndeclared fiercely that if the Zulu buffalo hid itself in the\nswamp like a timid calf when the white bull challenged it on the\nhills, the spirits of Chaka and all his forefathers would thrust\nits head into the mud and choke it.\n\nWhen all had finished Cetewayo spoke, saying--\n\n\"That is a bad council which has two voices, for to which of them\nmust the Captain listen when the impis of the foe gather in front\nof him?  Here I have sat while the moon climbs high and counted,\nand what do I find?  That one half of you, men of wisdom and\nrenown, say Yes, and that the other half of you, men of wisdom\nand renown, say No.  Which then is it to be, Yes or No?  Are we\nto fight the English, or are we to sit still?\"\n\n\"That is for the king to decide,\" said a voice.\n\n\"See what it is to be a king,\" went on Cetewayo with passion.\n\"If I declare for war and we win, shall I be greater than I am?\nIf victory gives me more land, more subjects, more wives and more\ncattle, what is the use of these things to me who already have\nenough of all of them?  And if defeat should take everything from\nme, even my life perhaps, then what shall I have gained?  I will\ntell you--the curse of the Zulus upon my name from father to son\nfor ever.  They will say, 'Cetewayo, son of Panda, pulled down a\nHouse that once was great.  Because of some small matter he\nquarrelled with the English who were always the friends of our\npeople, and brought the Zulus to the dust.'  Sintwangu, my\nmessenger, who brought heavy words from the Queen's induna which\nwe must answer with other words or with spears, says that the\nEnglish soldiers in Natal are few, so few that we Zulus can\nswallow them like bits of meat and still be hungry.  But are\nthese all the soldiers of the English?  I am not sure.  You are\none of that people, Macumazahn,\" he added, turning his massive\nshape towards me, \"tell us now, how many soldiers has your\nQueen?\"\n\n\"King,\" I answered, \"I do not know for certain.  But if the Zulus\ncan muster fifty thousand spears, the Queen, if there be need,\ncan send against them ten times fifty thousand, and if she grows\nangry, another ten times fifty, every one armed with a rifle that\nwill fire five bullets a minute, and to accompany the soldiers,\nhundreds of cannon whereof a single shot would give Ulundi to the\nflames.  Out of the sea they will come, shipload after shipload,\nwhite men from where the sun sets and black men from where the\nsun rises, so many that Zululand would not hold them.\"\n\nNow at these words, which I delivered as grandly as I could,\nsomething like a groan burst from the Council, though one man\ncried--\n\n\"Do not listen to the white traitor, O King, who is sent here to\nturn our hearts to water with his lies.\"\n\n\"Macumazahn may lie to us,\" went on Cetewayo, \"though in the past\nnone in the land have ever known him to lie, but he was not sent\nto do so, for I brought him here.  For my part I do not believe\nthat he lies.  I believe that these English are as many as the\npebbles in a river bed, and that to them Natal, yes, and all the\nCape is but as a single, outlying cattle kraal, one cattle kraal\nout of a hundred.  Did not Sompseu once tell us that they were\ncountless, on that day when he came many years ago after the\nbattle of the Tugela to name me to succeed my father Panda, the\nday when my faction, the Usutu, roared round him for hours like a\nriver in flood, and he sat still like a rock in the centre of a\nriver?  Also I am minded of the words that Chaka said when\nDingaan and Umbopa had stabbed him and he lay dying at the kraal\nDuguza, that although the dogs of his own House whom his hand\nfed, had eaten him up, he heard the sound of the running of the\nfeet of a great white people that should stamp them and the Zulus\nflat.\"\n\nHe paused; and the silence was so intense that the crackling of\nZikali's fire, which kept on burning brightly although I saw no\nfuel added to it, sounded quite loud.  Presently it was broken,\nfirst by a dog near at hand, howling horribly at the moon, and\nnext by the hooting of a great owl that flitted across the donga,\nthe shadow of its wide wings falling for a moment on the king.\n\n\"Listen!\" exclaimed Cetewayo, \"a dog that howls!  Methinks that\nit stands upon the roof of the House of Senzangacona.  And an owl\nthat hoots.  Methinks that owl has its nest in the world of\nSpirits!  Are these good omens, Councillors?  I trow not.  I say\nthat I will not decide this matter of peace or war.  If there is\none of my own blood here who will do so, come, let him take my\nplace and let me go away to my own lordship of Gikazi that I had\nwhen I was a prince before the witch Mameena who played with all\nmen and loved but one\"--here everybody turned and stared towards\nme, yes, even Zikali whom nothing else had seemed to move, till I\nwished that the ground would swallow me up--\"caused the war\nbetween me and my brother Umbelazi whose blood earth will not\nswallow nor suns dry--\"\n\n\"How can that be, O King?\" broke in Umnyamana the Prime Minister.\n\"How can any of your race sit in your seat while you still live?\nThen indeed there would be war, war between tribe and tribe and\nZulu and Zulu till none were left, and the white hyenas from\nNatal would come and chew our bones and with them the Boers that\nhave passed the Vaal.  See now.  Why is this Nyanga (i.e.\nwitch-doctor) here?\" and he pointed to Zikali beyond the fire.\n\"Why has the Opener of Roads been brought from the Black Kloof\nwhich he has not left for years?  Is it not that he may give us\ncounsel in our need and show us a sign that his counsel is good,\nwhether it be for war or peace?  Then when he has made divination\nand given the counsel and shown the sign, then, O King, do you\nspeak the word of war or peace, and send it to the Queen by\nyonder white man, and by that word we, the people, will abide.\"\n\nAt this suggestion, which I had no doubt was made by some secret\nagreement between Umnyamana and Zikali, Cetewayo seemed to grasp.\nPerhaps this was because it postponed for a little while the\ndreadful moment of decision, or perhaps because he hoped that in\nthe eyes of the nation it would shift the responsibility from his\nshoulders to those of the Spirits speaking through the lips of\ntheir prophet.  At any rate he nodded and answered--\n\n\"It is so.  Let the Opener of Roads open us a road through the\nforests and the swamps and the rocks of doubt, danger and fear.\nLet him give us a sign that it is a good road on which we may\nsafely travel, and let him tell us whether I shall live to walk\nthat road and what I shall meet thereon.  I promise him in return\nthe greatest fee that ever yet was paid to a doctor in Zululand.\"\n\nNow Zikali lifted his big head, shook his grey locks, and opening\nhis wide mouth as though he expected manna to fall into it from\nthe sky, he laughed out loud.\n\n\"O-ho-ho,\" he laughed, \"Oho-ho-ho-o, it is worth while to have\nlived so long when life has brought me to such an hour as this.\nWhat is it that my ears hear?  That I, the Indwande dwarf, I whom\nChaka named 'The-Thing-that-never-should-have-been-born,' I, one\nof the race conquered and despised by the Zulus, am here to speak\na word which the Zulus dare not utter, which the King of the\nZulus dares not utter.  O-ho-ho-ho! And what does the King offer\nto me?  A fee, a great fee for the word that shall paint the\nZulus red with blood or white with the slime of shame.  Nay, I\ntake no fee that is the price of blood or shame.  Before I speak\nthat word unknown--for as yet my heart has not heard it, and what\nthe heart has not heard the lips cannot shape--I ask but one\nthing.  It is an oath that whatever follows on the word, while\nthere is a Zulu left living in the world, I, the Voice of the\nSpirits, shall be safe from hurt or from reproach, I and those of\nmy House and those over whom I throw my blanket, be they black or\nbe they white.  That is my fee, without which I am silent.\"\n\n\"Izwa!  We hear you.  We swear it on behalf of the people,\" said\nevery councillor in the semi-circle in front of him; yes, and the\nking said it also, stretching out his hand.\n\n\"Good,\" said Zikali, \"it is an oath, it is an oath, sworn here\nupon the bones of the dead.  Evil-doers you call them, but I say\nto you that many of those who sit before me have more evil in\ntheir hearts than had those dead.  Well, let it be proclaimed, O\nKing, and with it this--that ill shall it go with him who breaks\nthe oath, with his family, with his kraal and all with whom he\nhas to do.\n\n\"Now what is it you ask of me?  First of all, counsel as to\nwhether you should fight the English Queen, a matter on which\nyou, the Great Ones, are evenly divided in opinion, as is the\nnation behind you.  O King, Indunas, and Captains, who am I that\nI should judge of such a matter which is beyond my trade, a\nmatter of the world above and of men's bodies, not of the world\nbelow and of men's spirits?  Yet there was one who made the Zulu\npeople out of nothing, as a potter fashions a vessel from clay,\nas a smith fashions an assegai out of the ore of the hills, yes,\nand tempers it with human blood.*  Chaka the Lion, the Wild\nBeast, the King among Kings, the Conqueror.  I knew Chaka as I\nknew his father, yes, and _his_ father.  Others still living knew\nhim also, say you, Sigananda there for instance,\" and he pointed\nto the old chief who had spoken first.  \"Yes, Sigananda knew him\nas a boy knows a great man, as a soldier knows a general.  But I\nknew his heart, aye, I shaped his heart, I was its thought.  Had\nit not been for me he would never have been great.  Then he\nwronged me\"--here Zikali took up the skull which he said was that\nof his daughter, and stroked it--\"and I left him.\n\n[*--The old Zulu smiths dipped their choicest blades in the blood\nof men.--A. Q.]\n\n\"He was not wise, he should have killed one whom he had wronged,\nbut perhaps he knew that I could not be killed; perhaps he had\ntried and found that he was but throwing spears at the moon which\nfell back on his own head.  I forget.  It is so long ago, and\nwhat does it matter?  At least I took away from him the prop of\nmy wisdom, and he fell--to rise no more.  And so it has been with\nothers.  So it has been with others.  Yet while he was great I\nknew his heart who lived in his heart, and therefore I ask\nmyself, had he been sitting where the King sits to-day, what\nwould Chaka have done?  I will tell you.  If not only the English\nbut the Boers also and with them the Pondos, the Basutos and all\nthe tribes of Africa had threatened him, he would have fought\nthem--yes, and set his heel upon their necks.  Therefore,\nalthough I give no counsel upon such a matter, I say to you that\nthe counsel of Chaka is--fight--and conquer.  Hearken to it or\npass it by--I care not which.\"\n\nHe paused and a loud \"Ow\" of wonder and admiration rose from his\naudience.  Myself I nearly joined in it, for I thought this one\nof the cleverest bits of statecraft that ever I had heard of or\nseen.  The old wizard had taken no responsibility and given no\nanswer to the demand for advice.  All this he had thrust on to\nthe shoulders of a dead man, and that man one whose name was\nmagical to every Zulu, the king whose memory they adored, the\ngreat General who had gorged them with victory and power.\nSpeaking as Chaka, after a long period of peace, he urged them\nonce more to lift their spears and know the joys of triumph,\nthereby making themselves the greatest nation in Southern Africa.\nFrom the moment I heard this cunning appeal, I know what the end\nwould be; all the rest was but of minor and semi-personal\ninterest.  I knew also for the first time how truly great was\nZikali and wondered what he might have become had Fortune set him\nin different circumstances among a civilized people.\n\nNow he was speaking again, and quickly before the impression died\naway.\n\n\"Such is the word of Chaka spoken by me who was his secret\ncouncillor, the Councillor who was seldom seen, and never heard.\nDoes not Sigananda yonder know the voice which amongst all those\npresent echoes in his ears alone?\"\n\n\"I know it,\" cried the old chief.  Then with his eyes starting\nalmost from his head, Sigananda leapt up and raising his hand,\ngave the royal salute, the Bayete, to the spirit of Chaka, as\nthough the dead king stood before him.\n\nI think that most of those there thought that it did stand before\nhim, for some of them also gave the Bayete and even Cetewayo\nraised his arm.\n\nSigananda squatted down again and Zikali went on.\n\n\"You have heard.  This captain of the Lion knows his voice.  So,\nthat is done with.  Now you ask of me something else--that I who\nam a doctor, the oldest of all the doctors and, it is thought--I\nknow not--the wisest, should be able to answer.  You ask of\nme--How shall this war prosper, if it is made--and what shall\nchance to the King during and after the war, and lastly you ask\nof me a sign.  What I tell to you is true, is it not so?\"\n\n\"It is true,\" answered the Council.\n\n\"Asking is easy,\" continued Zikali in a grumbling voice, \"but\nanswering is another matter.  How can I answer without\npreparation, without the needful medicines also that I have not\nwith me, who did not know what would be sought of me, who thought\nthat my opinion was desired and no more?  Go away now and return\non the sixth night and I will tell you what I can do.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" cried the king.  \"We refuse to go, for the matter is\nimmediate.  Speak at once, Opener of Roads, lest it should be\nsaid in the land that after all you are but an ancient cheat, a\nstick that snaps in two when it is leant on.\"\n\n\"Ancient cheat!  I remember that is what Macumazahn yonder once\ntold me I am, though afterwards--Perhaps he was right, for who in\nhis heart knows whether or not he be a cheat, a cheat who\ndeceives himself and through himself others.  A stick that snaps\nin two when it is leant on!  Some have thought me so and some\nhave thought otherwise.  Well, you would have answers which I\nknow not how to give, being without medicine and in face of those\nwho are quite ignorant and therefore cannot lend me their\nthoughts, as it sometimes happens that men do when workers of\nevil are sought out in the common fashion.  For then, as you may\nhave guessed, it is the evil-doer who himself tells the doctor of\nhis crime, though he may not know that he is telling it.  Yet\nthere is another stone that I alone can throw, another plan that\nI alone can practise, and that not always.  But of this I would\nnot make use since it is terrible and might frighten you or even\nsend you back to your huts raving so that your wives, yes, and\nthe very dogs fled, from you.\"\n\nHe stopped and for the first time did something to his fire, for\nI saw his hands going backwards and forwards, as though he warmed\nthem at the flames.\n\nAt length an awed voice, I think it was that of Dabulamanzi,\nasked--\n\n\"What is this plan, Inyanga?  Let us hear that we may judge.\"\n\n\"The plan of calling one from the dead and hearkening to the\nvoice of the dead.  Is it your desire that I should draw water\nfrom this fount of wisdom, O King and Councillors?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\n\n\nWAR\n\n\n\n\n\nNow men began to whisper together and Goza groaned at my side.\n\n\"Rather would I look down a live lion's throat than see the\ndead,\" he murmured.  But I, who was anxious to learn how far\nZikali would carry his tricks, contemptuously told him to be\nsilent.\n\nPresently the king called me to him and said--\n\n\"Macumazahn, you white men are reported to know all things.  Tell\nme now, is it possible for the dead to appear?\"\n\n\"I am not sure,\" I answered doubtfully; \"some say that it is and\nsome say that it is not possible.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the king.  \"Have you ever seen one you knew in life\nafter death?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"that is--yes.  That is--I do not know.  When\nyou will tell me, King, where waking ends and sleep begins, then\nI will answer.\"\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" he exclaimed, \"just now I announced that you were\nno liar, who perceive that after all you are a liar, for how can\nyou both have seen, and not seen, the dead?  Indeed I remember\nthat you lied long ago, when you gave it out that the witch\nMameena was not your lover, and afterwards showed that she was by\nkissing her before all men, for who kisses a woman who is not his\nlover, or his mother?  Return, since you will not tell me the\ntruth.\"\n\nSo I went back to my stool, feeling very small and yet indignant,\nfor how was it possible to be definite about ghosts, or to\nexplain the exact facts of the Mameena myth which clung to me\nlike a Wait-a-bit thorn.\n\nThen after a little consultation Cetewayo said--\n\n\"It is our desire, O Opener of Roads, that you should draw wisdom\nfrom the fount of Death, if indeed you can do so.  Now let any\nwho are afraid depart and wait for us who are not afraid, alone\nand in silence at the mouth of the kloof.\"\n\nAt this some of the audience rose, but after hesitating a little,\nsat down again.  Only Goza actually took a step forward, but on\nmy remarking that he would probably meet the dead coming up that\nway, collapsed, muttering something about my pistol, for the fool\nseemed to think I could shoot a spirit.\n\n\"If indeed I can do so,\" repeated Zikali in a careless fashion.\n\"That is to be proved, is it not?  Perhaps, too, it may be better\nfor every one of you if I fail than if I succeed.  Of one thing I\nwarn you, should the dead appear stir not, and above all touch\nnot, for he who does either of these things will, I think, never\nlive to look upon the sun again.  But first let me try an easier\nfashion.\"\n\nThen once again he took up the skull that he said had been his\ndaughter's, and whispered to it, only to lay it down presently.\n\n\"It will not serve,\" he said with a sigh and shaking his locks.\n\"Noma tells me that she died a child, one who had no knowledge of\nwar or matters of policy, and that in all these things of the\nworld she still remains a child.  She says that I must seek some\none who thought much of them; one, too who still lives in the\nheart of a man who is present here, if that be possible, since\nfrom such a heart alone can the strength be drawn to enable the\ndead to appear and speak.  Now let there be silence--Let there be\nsilence, and woe to him that breaks it.\"\n\nSilence there was indeed, and in it Zikali crouched himself down\ntill his head almost rested on his knee, and seemed to go to\nsleep.  He awoke again and chanted for half a minute or so in\nsome language I could not understand.  Then voices began to\nanswer him, as it seemed to me from all over the kloof, also from\nthe sky or rock above.  Whether the effect was produced by\nventriloquism or whether he had confederates posted at various\npoints, I do not know.\n\nAt any rate this lord of \"multitudes of spirits\" seemed to be\nengaged in conversation with some of them.  What is more, the\nthing was extremely well done, since each voice differed from the\nother; also I seemed to recognize some of them, Dingaan's for\ninstance, and Panda's, yes, and that of Umbelazi the Handsome,\nthe brother of the king whose death I witnessed down by the\nTugela.\n\nYou will ask me what they said.  I do not know.  Either the words\nwere confused or the events that followed have blotted them from\nmy brain.  All I remember is that each of them seemed to be\nspeaking of the Zulus and their fate and to be very anxious to\nrefer further discussion of the matter to some one else.  In\nshort they seemed to talk under protest, or that was my\nimpression, although Goza, the only person with whom I had any\nsubsequent debate upon the subject, appeared to have gathered one\nthat was different, though what it was I do not recall.  The only\nwords that remained clear to me must, I thought, have come from\nthe spirit of Chaka, or rather from Zikali or one of his\nmyrmidons assuming that character.  They were uttered in a deep\nfull voice, spiced with mockery, and received by the wizard with\n\"Sibonga,\" or titles of praise, which I who am versed in Zulu\nhistory and idiom knew had only been given to the great king, and\nindeed since his death had become unlawful, not to be used.  The\nwords were--\n\n\"What, Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born, do you think\nyourself a Thing-that-should-never-die, that you still sit\nbeneath the moon and weave witchcrafts as of old? Often have I\nhunted for you in the Under-world who have an account to settle\nwith you, as you have an account to settle with me.  So, so, what\ndoes it matter since we must meet at last, even if you hide\nyourself at the back of the furthest star?  Why do you bring me\nup to this place where I see some whom I would forget?  Yes, they\nbuild bone on bone and taking the red earth, mould it into flesh\nand stand before me as last I saw them newly dead.  Oh! your\nmagic is good, Spell-weaver, and your hate is deep and your\nvengeance is keen.  No, I have nothing to tell you to-day, who\nrule a greater people than the Zulus in another land.  Who are\nthese little men who sit before you?  One of them has a look of\nDingaan, my brother who slew me, yes, and wears his armlet.  Is\nhe the king?  Answer not, for I do not care to know.  Surely\nyonder withered thing is Sigananda.  I know his eye and the Iziqu\non his breast.  Yes, I gave it to him after the great battle with\nZweede in which he killed five men.  Does he remember it, I\nwonder?  Greeting, Sigananda; old as you are you have still\ntwenty and one years to live, and then we will talk of the battle\nwith Zweede.  Let me begone, this place burns my spirit, and in\nit there is a stench of mortal blood.  Farewell, O Conqueror!\"\n\nThese were the words that I thought I heard Chaka say, though I\ndaresay that I dreamt them.  Indeed had it been otherwise, I mean\nhad they really been spoken by Zikali, there would surely have\nbeen more in them, something that might have served his purpose,\nnot mere talk which had all the inconsequence of a dream.  Also\nno one else seemed to pay any particular attention to them,\nthough this may have been because so many voices were sounding\nfrom different places at once, for as I have said, Zikali\narranged his performance very well, as well as any medium could\nhave done on a prepared stage in London.\n\nIn a moment, as though at a signal, the voices died away.  Then\nother things happened.  To begin with I felt very faint, as\nthough all the strength were being taken out of me.  Some queer\nfancy got a hold of me.  I don't quite know what it was, but it\nhad to do with the Bible story of Adam when he fell asleep and a\nrib was removed from him and made into a woman.  I reflected that\nI felt as Adam must have done when he came out of his trance\nafter this terrific operation, very weak and empty.  Also, as it\nchanced, presently I saw Eve--or rather a woman.  Looking at the\nfire in a kind of disembodied way, I perceived that dense smoke\nwas rising from it, which smoke spread itself out like a fan.  It\nthinned by degrees, and through the veil of smoke I perceived\nsomething else, namely, a woman very like one whom once I had\nknown.  There she stood, lightly clad enough, her fingers playing\nwith the blue beads of her necklace, an inscrutable smile upon\nher face and her large eyes fixed on nothingness.\n\nOh! Heaven, I knew her, or rather thought I did at the moment,\nfor now I am almost sure that it was Nombe dressed, or undressed,\nfor the part.  That knowledge came with reflection, but then I\ncould have sworn, being deceived by the uncertain light, that the\nlong dead Mameena stood before us as she had seemed to stand\nbefore me in the hut of Zikali, radiating a kind of supernatural\nlife and beauty.\n\nA little wind arose, shaking the dry leaves of the aloes in the\nkloof; I thought it whispered--_Hail, Mameena!_  Some of the\nolder men, too, among them a few who had seen her die, in\ntrembling voices murmured, \"It is Mameena!\" whereon Zikali\nscowled at them and they grew silent.\n\nAs for the figure it stood there patient and unmoved, like one\nwho has all time at its disposal, playing with the blue beads.  I\nheard them tinkle against each other, which proves that it was\nhuman, for how could a wraith cause beads to tinkle, although it\nis true that Christmas-story ghosts are said to clank their\nchains.  Her eyes roved idly and without interest over the\nsemi-circle of terrified men before her.  Then by degrees they\nfixed themselves upon the tree behind which I was crouching,\nwhereon Goza sank paralyzed to the ground.  She contemplated this\ntree for a while that seemed to me interminable; it reminded me\nof a setter pointing game it winded but could not see, for her\nwhole frame grew intent and alert.  She ceased playing with the\nbeads and stretched out her slender hand towards me.  Her lips\nmoved.  She spoke in a sweet, slow voice, saying--\n\n\"O Watcher-by-Night, is it thus you greet her to whom you have\ngiven strength to stand once more beneath the moon?  Come hither\nand tell me, have you no kiss for one from whom you parted with a\nkiss?\"\n\nI heard.  Without doubt the voice was the very voice of Mameena\n(so well had Nombe been instructed).  Still I determined not to\nobey it, who would not be made a public laughing-stock for a\nsecond time in my life.  Also I confess this jesting with the\ndead seemed to me somewhat unholy, and not on any account would I\ntake a part in it.\n\nAll the company turned and stared at me, even Goza lifted his\nhead and stared, but I sat still and contemplated the beauties of\nthe night.\n\n\"If it is the spirit of Mameena, he will come,\" whispered\nCetewayo to Umnyamana.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered the Prime Minister, \"for the rope of his\nlove will draw him.  He who has once kissed Mameena, _must_ kiss\nher again when she asks.\"\n\nHearing this I grew furiously indignant and was about to break\ninto explanations, when to my horror I found myself rising from\nthat stool.  I tried to cling to it, but, as it only came into\nthe air with me, let it go.\n\n\"Hold me, Goza,\" I muttered, and he like a good fellow clutched\nme by the ankle, whereon I promptly kicked him in the mouth, at\nleast my foot kicked him, not my will.  Now I was walking towards\nthat Shape--shadow or woman--like a man in his sleep, and as I\ncame she stretched out her arms and smiled oh! as sweetly as an\nangel, though I felt quite sure that she was nothing of the sort.\n\nNow I stood opposite to her alongside the fire of which the smoke\nsmelt like roses at the dawn, and she seemed to bend towards me.\nWith shame and humiliation I perceived that in another moment\nthose arms would be about me.  But somehow they never touched me;\nI lost sight of them in the rose-scented smoke, only the sweet,\nslow voice which I could have sworn was that of Mameena, murmured\nin my ear--well, words known to her and me alone that I had never\nbreathed to any living being, though of course I am aware now\nthat they must also have been known to somebody else.\n\n\"Do you doubt me any longer?\" went on the murmuring.  \"Say, am I\nNombe now? Or--or am I in truth that Mameena, whose kiss thrills\nyour lips and soul?  Hearken, Macumazahn, for the time is short.\nIn the rout of the great battle that shall be, do not fly with\nthe white men, but set your face towards Ulundi.  One who was\nyour friend will guard you, and whoever dies, no harm shall come\nto you now that the fire which burns in my heart has set all\nZululand aflame.  Hearken once more.  Hans, the little yellow man\nwho was named Light-in-Darkness, he who died among the Kendah\npeople, sends you salutations and gives you praise.  He bids me\ntell you that now of his own accord he renders to me, Mameena,\nthe royal salute, because royal I must ever be; because also he\nand I who are so far apart are yet one in the love that is our\nlife.\"\n\nThe smoke blew into my face, causing me to reel back.  Cetewayo\ncaught me by the arm, saying--\n\n\"Tell us, are the lips of the dead witch warm or cold?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" I groaned, \"for I never touched her.\"\n\n\"How he lies!  Oh! how he lies even about what our eyes saw,\"\nsaid Cetewayo reflectively as I blundered past him back to my\nseat, on which I sank half swooning.  When I got my wits again\nthe figure that pretended to be Mameena was speaking, I suppose\nin answer to some question of Zikali's which I had not heard.  It\nsaid--\n\n\"O Lord of the Spirits, you have called me from the land of\nSpirits to make reply as to two matters which have not yet\nhappened upon the earth.  These replies I will give but no\nothers, since the mortal strength that I have borrowed returns\nwhence it came.  The first matter is, if there be war between the\nWhite and Black, what will happen in that war?  I see a plain\nringed round with hills and on it a strange-shaped mount.  I see\na great battle; I see the white men go down like corn before a\ntempest; I see the spears of the impis redden; I see the white\nsoldiers lie like leaves cut from a tree by frost.  They are\ndead, all dead, save a handful that have fled away.  I hear the\ningoma of victory sung here at Ulundi.  It is finished.\n\n\"The second matter is--what shall chance to the king?  I see him\ntossed on the Black Water; I see him in a land full of houses,\ntalking with a royal woman and her councillors.  There, too, he\nconquers, for they offer him tribute of many gifts.  I see him\nhere, back here in Zululand, and hear him greeted with the royal\nsalute.  Last of all I see him dead, as men must die, and hear\nthe voice of Zikali and the mourning of the women of his house.\nIt is finished.  Farewell, King Cetewayo, I pass to tell Panda,\nyour father, how it fares with you.  When last we parted did I\nnot prophesy to you that we should meet again at the bottom of a\ngulf?  Was it this gulf, think you, or another?  One day you\nshall learn.  Farewell, or fare ill, as it may happen!\"\n\nOnce more the smoke spread out like a fan.  When it thinned and\ndrew together again, the Shape was gone.\n\nNow I thought that the Zulus would be so impressed by this very\nqueer exhibition, that they would seek no more supernatural\nguidance, but make up their minds for war at once.  This,\nhowever, was just what they did not do.  As it happened, among\nthe assembled chiefs, was one who himself had a great repute as a\nwitch-doctor, and therefore burned with jealousy of Zikali who\nappeared to be able to do things that he had never even\nattempted.  This man leapt up and declared that all which they\nhad seemed to hear and see was but cunning trickery, carried out\nafter long preparation by Zikali and his confederates.  The\nvoices, he said, came from persons placed in certain spots, or\nsometimes were produced by Zikali himself.  As for the vision, it\nwas not that of a spirit but of a real woman, in proof of which\nhe called attention to certain anatomical details of the figure.\nFinally, with much sense, he pointed out that the Council would\nbe mad to come to any decision upon such evidence, or to give\nfaith to prophecies, whereof the truth or falsity could only be\nknown in the future.\n\nNow a fierce debate broke out, the war party maintaining that the\nmanifestations were genuine, the peace party that they were a\nfraud.  In the end, as neither side would give way and as Zikali,\nwhen appealed to, sat silent as a stone, refusing any\nexplanation, the king said--\n\n\"Must we sit here talking, talking, till daylight?  There is but\none man who can know the truth, that is Macumazahn.  Let him deny\nit as he will, he was the lover of this Mameena while she was\nalive, for with my own eyes I saw him kiss her before she killed\nherself.  It is certain, therefore, that he knows if the woman we\nseemed to see was Mameena or another, since there are things\nwhich a man never forgets.  I propose, therefore, that we should\nquestion him and form our own judgment of his answer.\"\n\nThis advice, which seemed to promise a road out of a blind ally,\nmet with instant acceptance.\n\n\"Let it be so,\" they cried with one voice, and in another minute\nI was once more conducted from behind my tree and set down upon\nthe stool in front of the Council, with my back to the fire and\nZikali, \"that his eyes might not charm me.\"\n\n\"Now, Watcher-by-Night,\" said Cetewayo, \"although you have lied\nto us in a certain matter, of this we do not think much, since it\nis one upon which both men and women always lie, as every judge\nwill know.  Therefore we still believe you to be an honest man,\nas your dealings have proved for many years.  As an honest man,\ntherefore, we beg you to give us a true answer to a plain\nquestion.  Was the Shape we saw before us just now a woman or a\nspirit, and if a spirit, was it the ghost of Mameena, the\nbeautiful witch who died near this place nearly the quarter of a\nhundred years ago, she whom you loved, or who loved you, which is\njust the same thing, since a man always loves a woman who loves\nhim, or thinks that he does?\"\n\nNow after reflection I replied in these words and as\nconscientiously as I could--\n\n\"King and Councillors, I do not know if what we all saw was a\nghost or a living person, but, as I do not believe in ghosts, or\nat any rate that they come back to the world on such errands, I\nconclude that it was a living person.  Still it may have been\nneither, but only a mere picture produced before us by the arts\nof Zikali.  So much for the first question.  Your second is--was\nthis spirit or woman or shadow, that of her whom I remember\nmeeting in Zululand many years ago?  King and Councillors, I can\nonly say that it was very like her.  Still one handsome young\nwoman often greatly resembles another of the same age and\ncolouring.  Further, the moon gives an uncertain light,\nespecially when it is tempered by smoke from a fire.  Lastly,\nmemory plays strange tricks with all of us, as you will know if\nyou try to think of the face of any one who has been dead for\nmore than twenty years.  For the rest, the voice seemed similar,\nthe beads and ornaments seemed similar, and the figure repeated\nto me certain words which I thought I alone had heard come from\nthe lips of her who is dead.  Also she gave me a strange message\nfrom another who is dead, referring to a matter which I believed\nwas known only to me and that other.  Yet Zikali is very clever\nand may have learned these things in some way unguessed by me,\nand what he has learned, others may have learned also.  King and\nCouncillors, I do not think that what we saw was the spirit of\nMameena.  I think it a woman not unlike to her who had been\ntaught her lesson.  I have nothing more to say, and therefore I\npray you not to ask me any further questions about Mameena of\nwhose name I grow weary.\"\n\nAt this point Zikali seemed to wake out of his indifference, or\nhis torpor, for he looked up and said darkly--\n\n\"It is strange that the cleverest are always those who first fall\ninto the trap.  They go along, gazing at the stars at night, and\nforget the pit which they themselves have dug in the morning.\nO-ho-ho! Oho-ho!\"\n\nNow the wrangling broke out afresh.  The peace party pointed\ntriumphantly to the fact that I, the white man who ought to know,\nput no faith in this apparition, which was therefore without\ndoubt a fraud.  The war party on the other hand declared that I\nwas deceiving them for reasons of my own, one of which would be\nthat I did not wish to see the Zulus eat up my people.  So fierce\ngrew the debate that I thought it would end in blows and perhaps\nin an attack on myself or Zikali who all the while sat quite\ncareless and unmoved, staring at the moon.  At length Cetewayo\nshouted for silence, spitting, as was his habit when angry.\n\n\"Make an end,\" he cried, \"lest I cause some of you to grow quiet\nfor ever,\" whereon the recriminations ceased.  \"Opener of Roads,\"\nhe went on, \"many of those who are present think like Macumazahn\nhere, that you are but an old cheat, though whether or no I be\none of these I will not say.  They demand a sign of you that none\ncan dispute, and I demand it also before I speak the word of\npeace or war.  Give us then that sign or begone to whence you\ncame and show your face no more at Ulundi.\"\n\n\"What sign does the Council require, Son of Panda?\" asked Zikali\nquietly.  \"Let them agree on one together and tell me now at\nonce, for I who am old grow weary and would sleep.  Then if it\ncan be given I will give it; and if I cannot give it, I will get\nme back to my own house and show my face no more at Ulundi, who\ndo not desire to listen again to fools who babble like contending\nwaters round a stone and yet never stir the stone because they\nrun two ways at once.\"\n\nNow the Councillors stared at each other, for none knew what sign\nto ask.  At length old Sigananda said--\n\n\"O King, it is well known that the Black One who went before you\nhad a certain little assegai handled with the royal red wood,\nwhich drank the blood of many.  It was with this assegai that\nMopo his servant, who vanished from the land after the death of\nDingaan, let out the life of the Black One at the kraal Duguza,\nbut what became of it afterwards none have heard for certain.\nSome say that it was buried with the Black One, some that Mopo\nstole it.  Others that Dingaan and Umhlagana burned it.  Still a\nsaying rose like a wind in the land that when that spear shall\nfall from heaven at the feet of the king who reigns in the place\nof the Black One, then the Zulus shall make their last great war\nand win a victory of which all the world shall hear.  Now let the\nOpener of Roads give us this sign of the falling of the Black\nOne's spear and I shall be content.\"\n\n\"Would you know the spear if it fell?\" asked Cetewayo.\n\n\"I should know it, O King, who have often held it in my hand.\nThe end of the haft is gnawed, for when he was angry the Black\nOne used to bite it.  Also a thumb's length from the blade is a\nblack mark made with hot iron.  Once the Black One made a bet\nwith one of his captains that at a distance of ten paces he would\nthrow the spear deeper into the body of a chief whom he wished to\nkill, than the captain could.  The captain threw first, for I saw\nhim with my eyes, and the spear sank to that place on the shaft\nwhere the mark is, for the Black One burned it there.  Then the\nBlack One threw and the spear went through the body of the chief\nwho, as he died, called to him that he too should know the feel\nof it in his heart, as indeed he did.\"\n\nI think that Cetewayo was about to assent to this suggestion,\nsince he who desired peace believed it impossible that Zikali\nshould suddenly cause this identical spear to fall from heaven.\nBut Umnyamana, the Prime Induna, interposed hurriedly--\n\n\"It is not enough, O King.  Zikali may have stolen the spear, for\nhe was living and at the kraal Duguza at that time.  Also he may\nhave put about the prophecy whereof Sigananda speaks, or at least\nso men would say.  Let him give us a greater sign than this that\nall may be content, so that whether we make war or peace it may\nbe with a single mind.  Now it is known that we Zulus have a\nguardian spirit who watches over us from the skies, she who is\ncalled Nomkubulwana, or by some the Inkosazana-y-Zulu, the\nPrincess of Heaven.  It is known also that this Princess, who is\nwhite of skin and ruddy-haired, appears always before great\nthings happen in our land.  Thus she appeared before the Black\nOne died.  Also she appeared to a number of children before the\nbattle of the Tugela.  It is said, too, that but lately she\nappeared to a woman near the coast and warned her to cross the\nTugela because there would be war, though this woman cannot now\nbe found.  Let the Opener of Roads call down Nomkubulwana before\nour eyes from heaven and we will admit, every man of us, that\nthis is a sign which cannot be questioned.\"\n\n\"And if he does this thing, which I hold no doctor in the world\ncan do, what shall it signify?\" asked Cetewayo.\n\n\"O King,\" answered Umnyamana, \"if he does so, it shall signify\nwar and victory.  If he does not do so, it shall signify peace,\nand we will bow our heads before the Amalungwana basi bodwe\"\n(i.e., \"the little English,\" used as a term of derision).\n\n\"Do all agree?\" asked Cetewayo.\n\n\"We agree,\" answered every man, stretching out his hand.\n\n\"Then, Opener of Roads, it stands thus: If you can call\nNomkubulwana, should there be such a spirit, to appear before our\neyes, the Council will take it as a sign that the Heavens direct\nus to fight the English.\"\n\nSo spoke Cetewayo, and I noted a tone of triumph in his voice,\nfor his heart shrank from this war, and he was certain that\nZikali could do nothing of the sort.  Still the opinion of the\nnation, or rather of the army, was so strong in favour of it that\nhe feared lest his refusal might bring about his deposition, if\nnot his death.  From this dilemma the supernatural test suggested\nby the Prime Minister and approved by the Council that\nrepresented the various tribes of people, seemed to offer a path\nof escape.  So I read the situation, as I think rightly.\n\nUpon hearing these words for the first time that night Zikali\nseemed to grow disturbed.\n\n\"What do my ears hear?\" he exclaimed excitedly.  \"Am I the\nUmkulukulu, the Great-Great (i.e., God) himself, that it should\nbe asked of me to draw the Princess of Heaven from beyond the\nstars, she who comes and goes like the wind, but like the wind\ncannot be commanded?  Do they hear that if she will not come to\nmy beckoning, then the great Zulu people must put a yoke upon\ntheir shoulders and be as slaves?  Surely the King must have been\nlistening to the doctrines of those English teachers who wear a\nwhite ribbon tied about their necks, and tell us of a god who\nsuffered himself to be nailed to a cross of wood, rather than\nmake war upon his foes, one whom they call the Prince of Peace.\nTimes have changed indeed since the days of the Black One.  Yes,\ngenerals have become like women; the captains of the impis are\nset to milk the cows.  Well, what have I to do with all this?\nWhat does it matter to me who am so very old that only my head\nremains above the level of the earth, the rest of me being buried\nin the grave, who am not even a Zulu to boot, but a Dwandwe, one\nof the despised Dwandwe whom the Zulus mocked and conquered?\n\n\"Hearken to me, Spirits of the House of Senzangacona\"--here he\naddressed about a dozen of Cetewayo's ancestors by name, going\nback for many generations.  \"Hearken to me, O Princess of Heaven,\nappointed by the Great-Great to be the guardian of the Zulu race.\nIt is asked that you should appear, should it be your wish to\nsignify to these your children that they must stand upon their\nfeet and resist the white men who already gather upon their\nborders.  And should it be your wish that they should lay down\ntheir spears and go home to sleep with their wives and hoe the\ngardens while the white men count the cattle and set each to his\nwork upon the roads, then that you should not appear.  Do what\nyou will, O Spirits of the House of Senzangacona, do what you\nwill, O Princess of Heaven.  What does it matter to the\nThing-that-never-should-have-been-born, who soon will be as\nthough he never had been born, whether the House of Senzangacona\nand the Zulu people stand or fall?\n\n\"I, the old doctor, was summoned here to give counsel.  I gave\ncounsel, but it passed over the heads of these wise ones like a\nshadow of which none took note.  I was asked to prophesy of what\nwould chance if war came.  I called the dead from their graves;\nthey came in voices, and one of them put on the flesh again and\nspoke from the lips of flesh.  The white man to whom she spoke\ndenied her who had been his love, and the wise ones said that she\nwas a cheat, yes, a doll that I had dressed up to deceive them.\nThis spirit that had put on flesh, told of what would chance in\nthe war, if war there were, and what would chance to the King,\nbut they mock at the prophecy and now they demand a sign.  Come\nthen, Nomkubulwana, and give them the sign if you will and let\nthere be war.  Or stay away and give them no sign if you will,\nand let there be peace.  It is nought to me, nought to the\nThing-that-should-never-have-been-born.\"\n\nThus he rambled on, as it occurred to me who watched and\nlistened, talking against time.  For I observed that while he\nspoke a cloud was passing over the face of the moon, and that\nwhen he ceased speaking it was quite obscured by this cloud, so\nthat the Vale of Bones was plunged in a deep twilight that was\nalmost darkness.  Further, in a nervous kind of way, he did\nsomething more to his wizard's fire which again caused it to\nthrow out a fan of smoke that hid him and the execution rock in\nfront of which he sat.\n\nThe cloud floated by and the moon came out as though from an\neclipse; the smoke of the fire, too, thinned by degrees.  As it\nmelted and the light grew again, I became aware that something\nwas materializing, or had appeared on the point of the rock above\nus.  A few seconds later, to my wonder and amazement, I perceived\nthat this something was the spirit-like form of a white woman\nwhich stood quite still upon the very point of the rock.  She was\nclad in some garment of gleaming white cut low upon her breast,\nthat may have been of linen, but from the way it shone, suggested\nthat it was of glittering feathers, egrets' for instance.  Her\nruddy hair was outspread, and in it, too, something glittered,\nlike mica or jewels.  Her feet and milk-hued arms were bare and\npoised in her right hand was a little spear.\n\nNor did I see alone, since a moan of fear and worship went up\nfrom the Councillors.  Then they grew silent stared and stared.\n\nSuddenly Zikali lifted his head and looked at them through the\nthin flame of the fire which made his eyes shine like those of a\ntiger or of a cornered baboon.\n\n\"At what do you gaze so hard, King and Councillors?\" he asked.\n\"I see nothing.  At what then do you gaze so hard?\"\n\n\"On the rock above you stands a white spirit in her glory.  It is\nthe Inkosazana herself,\" muttered Cetewayo.\n\n\"Has she come then?\" mocked the old wizard.  \"Nay, surely it is\nbut a dream, or another of my tricks; some black woman painted\nwhite that I have smuggled here in my medicine bag, or rolled up\nin the blanket on my back.  How can I prove to you that this is\nnot another cheat like to that of the spirit of Mameena whom the\nwhite man, her lover, did not know again?  Go near to her you\nmust not, even if you could, seeing that if by chance she should\n_not_ be a cheat, you would die, every man of you, for woe to him\nwhom Nomkubulwana touches.  How then, how?  Ah! I have it.\nDoubtless in his pocket Macumazahn yonder hides a little gun,\nMacumazahn who with such a gun can cut a reed in two at thirty\npaces, or shave the hair from the chin of a man, as is well known\nin the land.  Let him then take his little gun and shoot at that\nwhich you say stands upon the rock.  If it be a black woman\npainted white, doubtless she will fall down dead, as so many have\nfallen from that rock.  But if it be the Princess of Heaven, then\nthe bullet will pass through her or turn aside and she will take\nno harm, though whether Macumazahn will take any harm is more\nthan I can say.\"\n\nNow when they heard this many remained silent, but some of the\npeace party began to clamour that I should be ordered to shoot at\nthe apparition.  At length Cetewayo seemed to give way to this\npressure.  I say seemed, because I think he wished to give way.\nWhether or not a spirit stood before him, he knew no more than\nthe rest, but he did know that unless the vision were proved to\nbe mortal he would be driven into war with the English.\nTherefore he took the only chance that remained to him.\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" he said, \"I know you have your pistol on you, for\nonly the other day you brought it into my presence, and through\nlight and darkness you nurse it as a mother does her firstborn.\nNow since the Opener of Roads desires it, I command you to fire\nat that which seems to stand above us.  If it be a mortal woman,\nshe is a cheat and deserves to die.  If it be a spirit from\nheaven it can take no harm.  Nor can you take harm who only do\nthat which you must.\"\n\n\"Woman or spirit, I will not shoot, King,\" I answered.\n\n\"Is it so?  What! do you defy me, White Man?  Do so if you will,\nbut learn that then your bones shall whiten here in this Vale of\nBones.  Yes, you shall be the first of the English to go below,\"\nand turning, he whispered something to two of the Councillors.\n\nNow I saw that I must either obey or die.  For a moment my mind\ngrew confused in face of this awful alternative.  I did not\nbelieve that I saw a spirit.  I believed that what stood above me\nwas Nombe cunningly tricked out with some native pigments which\nat that distance and in that light made her look like a white\nwoman.  For oddly enough at that time the truth did not occur to\nme, perhaps because I was too surprised.  Well, if it were Nombe,\nshe deserved to be shot for playing such a trick, and what is\nmore her death, by revealing the fraud of Zikali, would perhaps\navert a great war.  But then why did he make the suggestion that\nI should be commanded to fire at this figure?  Slowly I drew out\nmy pistol and brought it to the full cock, for it was loaded.\n\n\"I will obey, King,\" I said, \"to save myself from being murdered.\nBut on your head be all that may follow from this deed.\"\n\nThen it was for the first time that a new idea struck me so\nclearly that I believe it was conveyed direct from Zikali's brain\nto my own.  _I might shoot, but there was no need for me to hit._\nAfter that everything grew plain.\n\n\"King,\" I said, \"if yonder be a mortal, she is about to die.  Only a\nspirit can escape my aim.  Watch now the centre of her forehead,\nfor there the bullet will strike!\"\n\nI lifted the pistol and appeared to cover the figure with much\ncare.  As I did so, even from that distance I thought I saw a\nlook of terror in its eyes.  Then I fired, with a little jerk of\nthe wrist sending the ball a good yard above her head.\n\n\"She is unharmed,\" cried a voice.  \"Macumazahn missed her.\"\n\n\"Macumazahn does not miss,\" I replied loftily.  \"If that at which\nhe aimed is unharmed, it is because it cannot be hit.\"\n\n\"O-ho-o!\" laughed Zikali, \"the White Man who does not know the\ntaste of his own love's lips, says that he has fired at that\nwhich cannot be hit.  Let him try again.  No, let him choose\nanother target.  The Spirit is the Spirit, but he who summoned\nher may still be a cheat.  There is another bullet in your little\ngun, White Man; see if it can pierce the heart of Zikali, that\nthe King and Council may learn whether he be a true prophet, the\ngreatest of all the prophets that ever was, or whether he be but\na common cheat.\"\n\nNow a sudden rage filled me against this old rascal.  I\nremembered how he had brought Mameena to her death, when he\nthought that it would serve him, and since then filled the land\nwith stories concerning her and me, which met me whatever way I\nturned.  I remembered that for years he had plotted to bring\nabout the destruction of the Zulus, and to further his dark ends,\nwas now engaged in causing a fearful war which would cost the\nlives of thousands.  I remembered that he had trapped me into\nZululand and then handed me over to Cetewayo, separating me from\nmy friends who were in my charge, and for aught I knew, giving\nthem to death.  Surely the world would be well rid of him.\n\n\"Have your will,\" I shouted and covered him with the pistol.\n\nThen there came into my mind a certain saying--\"Judge not that ye\nbe not judged.\"  Who and what was I that I should dare to arraign\nand pass sentence upon this man who after all had suffered many\nwrongs?  As I was about to fire I caught sight of some bright\nobject flashing towards the king from above, and instantaneously\nshifted my aim and pressed the trigger.  The thing, whatever it\nmight be, flew in two.  One part of it fell upon Zikali, the\nother part travelled on and struck Cetewayo upon the knee.\n\nThere followed a great confusion and a cry of \"The king is\nstabbed!\"  I ran forward to look and saw the blade of a little\nassegai lying on the ground and on Cetewayo's knee a slight cut\nfrom which blood trickled.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" I said, \"a scratch, no more, though had not the\nspear been stopped in its course it might have been otherwise.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Zikali, \"but what was it that caused the cut?  Take\nthis, Sigananda, and tell me what it may be,\" and he threw\ntowards him a piece of red wood.\n\nSigananda looked at it.  \"It is the haft of the Black One's\nspear,\" he exclaimed, \"which the bullet of Macumazahn has severed\nfrom the blade.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Zikali, \"and the blade has drawn the blood of the\nBlack One's child.  Read me this omen, Sigananda; or ask it of\nher who stands above you.\"\n\nNow all looked to the rock, but it was empty.  The figure had\nvanished.\n\n\"Your word, King,\" said Zikali.  \"Is it for peace or war?\"\n\nCetewayo looked at the assegai, looked at the blood trickling\nfrom his knee, looked at the faces of the councillors.\n\n\"Blood calls for blood,\" he moaned.  \"My word is--_War!_\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\n\n\nKAATJE BRINGS NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\nZikali burst into one of his peals of laughter, so unholy that\nit caused the blood in me to run cold.\n\n\"The King's word is _war_,\" he cried.  \"Let Nomkubulwana take\nthat word back to heaven.  Let Macumazahn take it to the White\nMen.  Let the captains cry it to the regiments and let the world\ngrow red.  The King has chosen, though mayhap, had I been he, I\nshould have chosen otherwise; yet what am I but a hollow reed\nstuck in the ground up which the spirits speak to men?  It is\nfinished, and I, too, am finished for a while.  Farewell, O King!\nWhere shall we meet again, I wonder?  On the earth or under it?\nFarewell, Macumazahn, I know where we shall meet, though you do\nnot.  O King, I return to my own place, I pray you to command\nthat none come near me or trouble me with words, for I am spent.\"\n\n\"It is commanded,\" said Cetewayo.\n\nAs he spoke the fire went out mysteriously, and the wizard rose\nand hobbled off at a surprising pace round the corner of the\nprojecting rock.\n\n\"Stay!\" I called, \"I would speak with you;\" but although I am\nsure he heard me, he did not stop or look round.\n\nI sprang up to follow him, but at some sign from Cetewayo two\nindunas barred my way.\n\n\"Did you not hear the King's command, White Man?\" one of them\nasked coldly, and the tone of his question told me that war\nhaving been declared, I was now looked upon as a foe.  I was\nabout to answer sharply when Cetewayo himself addressed me.\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" he said, \"you are now my enemy, like all your\npeople, and from sunrise to-morrow morning your safe-conduct here\nends, for if you are found at Ulundi two hours after that time,\nit will be lawful for any man to kill you.  Yet as you are still\nmy guest, I will give you an escort to the borders of the land.\nMoreover, you shall take a message from me to the Queen's\nofficers and captains.  It is--that I will send an answer to\ntheir demands upon the point of an assegai.  Yet add this, that\nnot I but the English, to whom I have always been a friend,\nsought this war.  If Sompseu had suffered me to fight the Boers\nas I wished to do, it would never have come about.  But he threw\nthe Queen's blanket over the Transvaal and stood upon it, and now\nhe declares that lands which were always the property of the\nZulus, belong to the Boers.  Therefore I take back all the\npromises which I made to him when he came hither to call me King\nin the Queen's name, and no more do I call him my father.  As for\nthe disbanding of my impis, let the English disband them if they\ncan.  I have spoken.\"\n\n\"And I have heard,\" I answered, \"and will deliver your words\nfaithfully, though I hold, King, that they come from the lips of\none whom the Heavens have made mad.\"\n\nAt this bold speech some of the Councillors started up with\nthreatening gestures.  Cetewayo waved them back and answered\nquietly, \"Perhaps it was the Queen of Heaven who stood on yonder\nrock who made me mad.  Or perhaps she made me wise, as being the\nSpirit of our people she should surely do.  That is a question\nwhich the future will decide, and if ever we should meet after it\nis decided, we will talk it over.  Now, hamba gachle! (go in\npeace).\"\n\n\"I hear the king and I will go, but first I would speak with\nZikali.\"\n\n\"Then, White Man, you must wait till this war is finished or till\nyou meet him in the Land of Spirits.  Goza, lead Macumazahn back\nto his hut and set a guard about it.  At the dawn a company of\nsoldiers will be waiting with orders to take him to the border.\nYou will go with him and answer for his safety with your life.\nLet him be well treated on the road as my messenger.\"\n\nThen Cetewayo rose and stood while all present gave him the royal\nsalute, after which he walked away down the kloof.  I remained\nfor a moment, making pretence to examine the blade of the little\nassegai that had been thrown by the figure on the rock, which I\nhad picked from the ground.  This historical piece of iron which\nI have no doubt is the same that Chaka always carried, wherewith,\ntoo, he is said to have killed his mother, Nandie, by the way I\nstill possess, for I slipped it into my pocket and none tried to\ntake it from me.\n\nReally, however, I was wondering whether I could in any way gain\naccess to Zikali, a problem that was settled for me by a sharp\nrequest to move on, uttered in a tone which admitted of no\nfurther argument.\n\nWell, I trudged back to my hut in the company of Goza, who was so\novercome by all the wonders he had seen that he could scarcely\nspeak.  Indeed, when I asked him what he thought of the figure\nthat had appeared upon the rock, he replied petulantly that it\nwas not given to him to know whence spirits came or of what stuff\nthey were made, which showed me that he at any rate believed in\nits supernatural origin and that it had appeared to direct the\nZulus to make war.  This was all I wanted to find out, so I said\nnothing more, but gave up my mind to thought of my own position\nand difficulties.\n\nHere I was, ordered on pain of death to depart from Ulundi at the\ndawn.  And yet how could I obey without seeing Zikali and\nlearning from him what had happened to Anscombe and Heda, or at\nany rate without communicating with him?  Once more only did I\nbreak silence, offering to give Goza a gun if he would take a\nmessage from me to the great wizard.  But with a shake of his big\nhead, he answered that to do so would mean death, and guns were\nof no good to a dead man since, as I had shown myself that night,\nthey had no power to shoot a spirit.\n\nThis closed the business on which I need not have troubled to\nenter, since an answer to all my questionings was at hand.\n\nWe reached the hut where Goza gave me over to the guard of\nsoldiers, telling their officer that none were to be permitted to\nenter it save myself and that I was not to be to permitted to\ncome out of it until he, Goza, came to fetch me a little before\nthe dawn.\n\nThe officer asked if any one else was to be permitted to come\nout, a question that surprised me, though vaguely, for I was\nthinking of other things.  Then Goza departed, remarking that he\nhoped I should sleep better than he would, who \"felt spirits in\nhis bones and did not wish to kiss them as I seemed to like to\ndo.\"  I replied facetiously, thinking of the bottle of brandy,\nthat ere long I meant to feel them in my stomach, whereat he\nshook his head again with the air of one whom nothing connected\nwith me could surprise, and vanished.\n\nI crawled into the hut and put the board over the bee-hole-like\nentrance behind me.  Then I began to hunt for the matches in my\npocket and pricked my finger with the point of Chaka's historical\nassegai.  While I was sucking it to my amazement I heard the\nsound of some one breathing on the further side of the hut.  At\nfirst I thought of calling the guard, but on reflection found the\nmatches and lit the candle, which stood by the blankets that\nserved me as a bed.  As soon as it burned up I looked towards the\nsound, and to my horror perceived the figure of a sleeping woman,\nwhich frightened me so much that I nearly dropped the candle.\n\nTo tell the truth, so obsessed was I with Zikali and his ghosts\nthat for a few moments it occurred to me that this might be the\nShape with which I had talked an hour or two before.  I mean that\nwhich had seemed to resemble the long-dead lady Mameena, or\nrather the person made up to her likeness, come here to continue\nour conversation.  At any rate I was sure, and rightly, that here\nwas more of the handiwork of Zikali who wished to put me in some\ndreadful position for reasons of his own.\n\nPulling myself together I advanced upon the lady, only to find\nmyself no wiser, since she was totally covered by a kaross.  Now\nwhat was to be done?  To escape, of which of course I had thought\nat once, was impossible since it meant an assegai in my ribs.  To\ncall to the guard for help seemed indiscreet, for who knew what\nthose fools might say?  To kick or shake her would undoubtedly be\nrude and, if it chanced to be the person who had played Mameena,\nwould certainly provoke remarks that I should not care to face.\nThere seemed to be only one resource, to sit down and wait till\nshe woke up.\n\nThis I did for quite a long time, till at last the absurdity of\nthe position and, I will admit, my own curiosity overcame me,\nespecially as I was very tired and wanted to go to sleep.  So\nadvancing most gingerly, I turned down the kaross from over the\nhead of the sleeping woman, much wondering whom I should see, for\nwhat man is there that a veiled woman does not interest?  Indeed,\ndoes not half the interest of woman lie in the fact that her\nnature is veiled from man, in short a mystery which he is always\nseeking to solve at his peril, and I might add, never succeeds in\nsolving?\n\nWell, I turned down that kaross and next instant stepped back\namazed and, to tell the truth, somewhat disappointed, for there,\nwith her mouth open, lay no wondrous and spiritual Mameena, but\nthe stout, earthly and most prosaic--Kaatje!\n\n\"Confound the woman!\" thought I to myself.  \"What is she doing\nhere?\"\n\nThen I remembered how wrong it was to give way to a sense of\nromantic disappointment at such a time, though as a matter of\nfact it is always in a moment of crisis or of strained nerves\nthat we are most open to the insidious advances of romance.  Also\nthat there was no one on earth, or beyond it, whom I ought more\ngreatly to have rejoiced to see.  I had left Kaatje with Anscombe\nand Heda; therefore Kaatje could tell me what had become of them.\nAnd at this thought my heart sank--why was she here in this most\ninappropriate meeting-place, alone?  Feeling that these were\nquestions which must be answered at once, I prodded Kaatje in the\nribs with my toe until, after a good deal of prodding, she awoke,\nsat up and yawned, revealing an excellent set of teeth in her\ncavernous, quarter-cast mouth.  Then perceiving a man she opened\nthat mouth even wider, as I thought with the idea of screaming\nfor help.  But here I was first with her, for before a sound\ncould issue I had filled it full with the corner of the kaross,\nexclaiming in Dutch as I did so--\n\n\"Idiot of a woman, do you not know the Heer Quatermain when you\nsee him?\"\n\n\"Oh! Baas,\" she answered, \"I thought you were some wicked Zulu\ncome to do me a mischief.\" Then she burst into tears and sobs\nwhich I could not stop for at least three minutes.\n\n\"Be quiet, you fat fool!\" I cried exasperated, \"and tell me,\nwhere are your mistress and the Heer Anscombe?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Baas, but I hope in heaven\" (Kaatje was some kind\nof a Christian), she replied between her sobs.\n\n\"In heaven!  What do you mean?\" I asked, horrified.\n\n\"I mean, Baas, that I hope they are in heaven, because when last\nI saw them they were both dead, and dead people must be either in\nheaven or hell, and heaven, they say, is better than hell.\"\n\n\"_Dead!_  Where did you see them dead?\"\n\n\"In that Black Kloof, Baas, some days after you left us and went\naway.  The old baboon man who is called Zikali gave us leave\nthrough the witch-girl, Nombe, to go also.  So the Baas Anscombe\nset to work to inspan the horses, the Missie Heda helping him,\nwhile I packed the things.  When I had nearly finished Nombe\ncame, smiling like a cat that has caught two mice, and beckoned\nto me to follow her.  I went and saw the cart inspanned with the\nfour horses all looking as though they were asleep, for their\nheads hung down.  Then after she had stared at me for a long\nwhile Nombe led me past the horses into the shadow of the\noverhanging cliff.  There I saw my mistress and the Baas Anscombe\nlying side by side quite dead.\"\n\n\"How do you know that they were dead?\" I gasped.  \"What had\nkilled them?\"\n\n\"I know that they were dead because they _were_ dead, Baas.\nTheir mouths and eyes were open and they lay upon their backs\nwith their arms stretched out.  The witch-girl, Nombe, said some\nKaffirs had come and strangled them and then gone away again, or\nso I understood who cannot speak Zulu so very well.  Who the\nKaffirs were or why they came she did not say.\"\n\n\"Then what did you do?\" I asked.\n\nI ran back to the hut, Baas, fearing lest I should be strangled\nalso, and wept there till I grew hungry.  When I came out of it\nagain they were gone.  Nombe showed me a place under a tree where\nthe earth was disturbed.  She said that they were buried there by\norder of her master, Zikali.  I don't know what became of the\nhorses or the cart.\"\n\n\"And what happened to you afterwards?\"\n\n\"Baas, I was kept for several days, I cannot remember how many,\nand only allowed out within the fence round the huts.  Nombe came\nto see me once, bringing this,\" and she produced a package sewn\nup in a skin.  \"She said that I was to give it to you with a\nmessage that those whom you loved were quite safe with One who is\ngreater than any in the land, and therefore that you must not\ngrieve for them whose troubles were over.  I think it was two\nnights after this that four Zulus came, two men and two women,\nand led me away, as I thought to kill me.  But they did not kill\nme; indeed they were very kind to me, although when I spoke to\nthem they pretended not to understand.  They took me a long\njourney, travelling for the most part in the dark and sleeping in\nthe day.  This evening when the sun set they brought me through a\nKaffir town and thrust me into the hut where I am without\nspeaking to any one.  Here, being very tired, I went to sleep,\nand that is all.\"\n\nAnd quite enough too, thought I to myself.  Then I put her\nthrough a cross-examination, but Kaatje was a stupid woman\nalthough a good and faithful servant, and all her terrible\nexperiences had not sharpened her intelligence.  Indeed, when I\npressed her she grew utterly confused, began to cry, thereby\ntaking refuge in the last impregnable female fortification, and\nsnivelled out that she could not bear to talk of her dear\nmistress any more.  So I gave it up, and two minutes later she\nwas literally snoring, being very tired, poor thing.\n\nNow I tried to think matters out as well as this disturbance\nwould allow, for nothing hinders thought so much as snores.  But\nwhat was the use of thinking?  There was her story to take or to\nleave, and evidently the honest creature believed what she said.\nFurther, how could she be deceived on such a point?  She swore\nthat she had seen Anscombe and Heda dead and afterwards had seen\ntheir graves.\n\nMoreover, there was confirmation in Nombe's message which could\nnot well have been invented, that spoke of their being well in\nthe charge of a \"Great One,\" a term by which the Zulus designate\nGod, with all their troubles finished.  The reason and manner of\ntheir end were left unrevealed.  Zikali might have murdered them\nfor his own purposes, or the Zulus might have killed them in\nobedience to the king's order that no white people in the land\nwere to be allowed to live.  Or perhaps the Basutos from\nSekukuni's country, with whom the Zulus had some understanding,\nhad followed and done them to death; indeed the strangling\nsounded more Basuto than Zulu--if they were really strangled.\n\nAlmost overcome though I was, I bethought me of the package and\nopened it, only to find another apparent proof of their end, for\nit contained Heda's jewels as I had found them in the bag in the\nsafe; also a spare gold watch belonging to Anscombe with his\ncoat-of-arms engraved upon it.  That which he wore was of silver\nand no doubt was buried with him, since for superstitious reasons\nthe natives would not have touched anything on his person after\ndeath.  This seemed to me to settle the matter, presumptively at\nany rate, since to show that robbery was not the cause of their\nmurder, their most valuable possessions which were not upon their\npersons had been sent to me, their friend.\n\nSo this was the end of all my efforts to secure the safety and\nwell-being of that most unlucky pair.  I wept when I thought of\nit there in the darkness of the hut, for the candle had burned\nout, and going on to my knees, put up an earnest prayer for the\nwelfare of their souls; also that I might be forgiven my folly in\nleading them into such danger.  And yet I did it for the best,\ntrying to judge wisely in the light of such experience of the\nworld as I possessed.\n\nNow alas! when I am old I have come to the conclusion that those\nthings which one tries to do for the best one generally does\nwrong, because nearly always there is some tricky fate at hand to\nmar them, which in this instance was named Zikali.  The fact is,\nI suppose, that man who thinks himself a free agent, can scarcely\nbe thus called, at any rate so far as immediate results are\nconcerned.  But that is a dangerous doctrine about which I will\nsay no more, for I daresay that he is engaged in weaving a great\nlife-pattern of which he only sees the tiniest piece.\n\nOne thing comforted me a little.  If these two were dead I could\nnow leave Zululand without qualms.  Of course I was obliged to\nleave in any case, or die, but somehow that fact would not have\neased my conscience.  Indeed I think that had I believed they\nstill lived, in this way or in that I should have tried not to\nleave, because I should have thought it for the best to stay to\nhelp them, whereby in all human probability I should have brought\nabout my own death without helping them at all.  Well, it had\nfallen out otherwise and there was an end.  Now I could only hope\nthat they had gone to some place where there are no more\ntroubles, even if, at the worst, it were a place of rest too deep\nfor dreams.\n\nMusing thus at last I dozed off, for I was so tired that I think\nI should have slept although execution awaited me at the dawn\ninstead of another journey.  I did not sleep well because of that\nsnoring female on the other side of the hut whose presence\noutraged my sense of propriety and caused me to be invaded by\nprophetic dreams of the talk that would ensue among those\nscandalmongering Zulus.  Yes, it was of this I dreamed, not of\nthe great dangers that threatened me or of the terrible loss of\nmy friends, perhaps because to many men, of whom I suppose I am\none, the fear of scandal or of being the object of public notice,\nis more than the fear of danger or the smart of sorrow.\n\nSo the night wore away, till at length I woke to see the gleam of\ndawn penetrating the smoke-hole and dimly illuminating the\nrecumbent form of Kaatje, which to me looked most unattractive.\nPresently I heard a discreet tapping on the doorboard of the hut\nwhich I at once removed, wriggling swiftly through the hole,\ncareless in my misery as to whether I met an assegai the other\nside of it or not.  Without a guard of eight soldiers was\nstanding, and with them Goza, who asked me if I were ready to\nstart.\n\n\"Quite,\" I answered, \"as soon as I have saddled my horse,\" which\nby the way had been led up to the hut.\n\nVery soon this was done, for I brought out most of my few\nbelongings with me and the bag of jewels was in my pocket.  Then\nit was that the officer of the guard, a thin and\nmelancholy-looking person, said in a hollow voice, addressing\nhimself to Goza--\n\n\"The orders are that the White Man's wife is to go with him.\nWhere is she?\"\n\n\"Where a man's wife should be, in his hut I suppose,\" answered\nGoza sleepily.\n\nRage filled me at the words.  Seldom do I remember being so\nangry.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"if you mean that Half-cast whom someone has\nthrust upon me, she is in there.  So if she is to come with us,\nperhaps you will get her out.\"\n\nThus adjured the melancholy-looking captain, who was named\nIndudu, perhaps because he or his father had longed to the Dudu\nregiment, crawled into the hut, whence presently emerged sounds\nnot unlike those which once I heard when a ringhals cobra\nfollowed a hare that I had wounded into a hole, a muffled sound\nof struggling and terror.  These ended in the sudden and violent\nappearance of Kaatje's fat and dishevelled form, followed by that\nof the snakelike Indudu.\n\nSeeing me standing there before a bevy of armed Zulus, she\npromptly fell upon my neck with a cry for help, for the silly\nwoman thought she was going to be killed by them.  Gripping me as\nan octopus grips its prey, she proceeded to faint, dragging me to\nmy knees beneath the weight of eleven stone of solid flesh.\n\n\"Ah!\" said one of the Zulus not unkindly, \"she is much afraid for\nher husband whom she loves.\"\n\nWell, I disentangled myself somehow, and seizing what I took to\nbe a gourd of water in that dim light, poured it over her head,\nonly to discover too late that it was not water but clotted milk.\nHowever the result was the same, for presently she sat up, made a\ndreadful-looking object by this liberal application of curds and\nwhey, whereon I explained matters to her to the best of my power.\nThe end of it was that after Indudu and Goza had wiped her down\nwith tufts of thatch dragged from the hut and I had collected her\ngear with the rest of my own, we set her on the horse\nstraddlewise, and started, the objects of much interest among\nsuch Zulus as were already abroad.\n\nAt the gate of the town there was a delay which made me nervous,\nsince in such a case as mine delay might always mean a\ndeath-warrant.  I knew that it was quite possible Cetewayo had\nchanged, or been persuaded to change his mind and issue a command\nthat I should be killed as one who had seen and knew too much.\nIndeed this fear was my constant companion during all the long\njourney to the Drift of the Tugela, causing me to look askance at\nevery man we met or who overtook us, lest he should prove to be a\nmessenger of doom.\n\nNor were these doubts groundless, for as I learned in the after\ndays, the Prime Minister, Umnyamana, and others had urged\nCetewayo strongly to kill me, and what we were waiting for at the\ngate were his final orders on the subject.  However, in this\nmatter, as in more that I could mention, the king played the part\nof a man of honour, and although he seemed to hesitate for\nreasons of policy, never had any intention of allowing me to be\nharmed.  On the contrary the command brought was that any one who\nharmed Macumazahn, the king's guest and messenger, should die\nwith all his House.\n\nWhilst we tarried a number of women gathered round us whose\nconversation I could not help overhearing.  One of them said to\nanother--\n\n\"Look at the white man, Watcher-by-Night, who can knock a fly off\nan ox's horn with a bullet from further away than we could see\nit.  He it was who loved and was loved by the witch Mameena,\nwhose beauty is still famous in the land.  They say she killed\nherself for his sake, because she declared that she would never\nlive to grow old and ugly, so that he turned away from her.  My\nmother told me all about it only last night.\"\n\nThen you have a liar for a mother, thought I to myself, for to\ncontradict such a one openly would have been undignified.\n\n\"Is it so?\" asked one of her friends, deeply interested.  \"Then\nthe lady Mameena must have had a strange taste in men, for this\none is an ugly little fellow with hair like the grey ash of\nstubble and a wrinkled face of the colour of a flayed skin that\nhas lain unstretched in the sun.  However, I have been told that\nwitches always love those who look unnatural.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Number one, \"but you see now that he is old he has to\nbe satisfied with a different sort of wife.  She is not\nbeautiful, is she, although she has dipped her head in milk to\nmake herself look white?\"\n\nSo it went on till at length a runner arrived and whispered\nsomething to Indudu who saluted, showing me that it was a royal\nmessage, and ordered us to move.  Of this I was glad, for had I\nstopped there much longer, I think I should have personally\nassaulted those gossiping female idiots.\n\n\nOf our journey through Zululand there is nothing particular to\nsay.  We saw but few people, since most of the men had been\ncalled up to the army, and many of the kraals seemed to be\ndeserted by the women and children who perhaps were hidden away\nwith the cattle.  Once, however, we met an impi about five\nthousand strong, that seemed to cover the hillside like a herd of\ngame.  It consisted of the Nodwengu and the Nokenke regiments,\nboth of which afterwards fought at Isandhlwana.  Some of their\ncaptains with a small guard came to see who we were, fine,\nfierce-looking men.  They stared at me curiously, and with one of\nthem, whom I knew, I had a little talk.  He said that I was the\nlast white man in Zululand and that I was lucky to be alive, for\nsoon these, and he pointed to the hordes of warriors who were\nstreaming past, would eat up the English to \"the last bone.\"  I\nanswered that this remained to be seen, as the English were also\ngreat eaters, whereat he laughed, replying, that it was true that\nthe white men had already taken the first bite--a very little\none, from which I gathered that some small engagement had\nhappened.\n\n\"Well, farewell, Macumazahn,\" he said, as he turned to go, \"I\nhope that we shall meet in the battle, for I want to see if you\ncan run as well as you can shoot.\"\n\nThis roused my temper and I answered him--\n\n\"I hope for your sake that we shall not meet, for if we do I\npromise that before I run I will show you what you never saw\nbefore, the gateway of the world of Spirits.\"\n\nI mention this conversation because by some strange chance it\nhappened at Isandhlwana that I killed this man, who was named\nSimpofu.\n\nDuring all those days of trudging through hot suns and\nthunderstorms, for I had to give up the mare to Kaatje who was\ntoo fat to walk, or said she was, I was literally haunted by\nthoughts of my murdered friends.  Heaven knows how bitterly I\nreproached myself for having brought them into Zululand.  It\nseemed so terribly sad that these young people who loved each\nother and had so bright a future before them, should have escaped\nfrom a tragic past merely to be overwhelmed by such a fate.\nAgain and again I questioned that lump Kaatje as to the details\nof their end and of all that went before and followed after the\nmurder.\n\nBut it was quite useless; indeed, as time went on she seemed to\nbecome more nebulous on the point as though a picture were fading\nfrom her mind.  But as to one thing she was always quite clear,\nthat she had seen them dead and had seen their new-made grave.\nThis she swore \"by God in Heaven,\" completing the oath with an\noutburst of tears in a way that would have carried conviction to\nany jury, as it did to me.\n\nAnd after all, what was more likely in the circumstances?  Zikali\nhad killed them, or caused them to be killed; or possibly they\nwere killed in spite of him in obedience to the express, or\ngeneral, order of the king, if the deed was not done by the\nBasutos.  And yet an idea occurred to me.  How about the woman on\nthe rock that the Zulus thought was their Princess of the\nHeavens?  Obviously this must be nonsense, since no such deity\nexisted, therefore the person must either have been a white woman\nor one painted up to resemble a white woman; seen from a distance\nin moonlight it was impossible to say which.  Now, if it were a\nwhite woman, she might, from her shape and height and the colour\nof her hair, be Heda herself.  Yet it seemed incredible that\nHeda, whom Kaatje had seen dead some days before, could be\nmasquerading in such a part and make no sign of recognition to\nme, even when I covered her with my pistol, whereas that Nombe\nwould play it was likely enough.\n\nOnly then Nombe must be something of a quick-change artist since\nbut a little while before she was beyond doubt personating the\ndead Mameena.  If it were not so I must have been suffering from\nillusions, for certainly I seemed to see some one who looked like\nMameena, and only Zikali, and through him Nombe, had sufficient\nknowledge to enable her to fill that role with such success.\nPerhaps the whole business was an illusion, though if so Zikali's\npowers must be great indeed.  But then how about the assegai that\nNomkubulwana, or rather her effigy, had seemed to hold and throw,\nwhereof the blade was at present in my saddle-bag.  That at any\nrate was tangible and real, though of course there was nothing to\nprove that it had really been Chaka's famous weapon.\n\nAnother thing that tormented me was my failure to see Zikali.  I\nfelt as though I had committed a crime in leaving Zululand\nwithout doing this and hearing from his own lips--well, whatever\nhe chose to tell me.  I forget if I said that while we were\nwaiting at the gate where those silly women talked so much\nnonsense about Mameena and Kaatje, that I made another effort\nthrough Goza to get into touch with the wizard, but quite without\navail.  Goza only answered what he said before, that if I wished\nto die at once I had better take ten steps towards the Valley of\nBones, whence, he added parenthetically, the Opener of Roads had\nalready departed on his homeward journey.  This might or might\nnot be true; at any rate I could find no possible way of coming\nface to face with him, or even of getting a message to his ear.\nNo, I was not to blame; I had done all I could, and yet in my\nheart I felt guilty.  But then, as cynics would, say, failure is\nguilt.\n\nAt length we came to the ford of the Tugela, and as fortunately\nthe water was just low enough, bade farewell to our escort before\ncrossing to the Natal side.  My parting with Goza was quite\ntouching, for we felt that it partook of the nature of a deathbed\nadieu, which indeed it did.  I told him and the others that I\nhoped their ends be easy, and that whether they met them by\nbullets or by bayonet thrusts, the wounds would prove quickly\nmortal so that they might not linger in discomfort or pain.\nRecognizing my kind thought for their true welfare they thanked\nme for it, though with no enthusiasm.  Indudu, however, filled\nwith the spirit of repartee, or rather of \"tu quoque\", said in\nhis melancholy fashion that if he and I came face to face in war,\nhe would be sure to remember my words and to cut me up in the\nbest style, since he could not bear to think of me languishing on\na bed of sickness without my wife Kaatje to nurse me (they knew I\nwas touchy about Kaatje).  Then we shook hands and parted.\nKaatje, hung round with paraphernalia like the White Knight in\n\"Alice through the Looking-glass,\" clinging to a cooking-pot and\nweeping tears of terror, faced the foaming flood upon the mare,\nwhile I grasped its tail.\n\nWhen we were as I judged out of assegai shot, I turned, with the\nwater up to my armpits, and shouted some valedictory words.\n\n\"Tell your king,\" I said, \"that he is the greatest fool in the\nworld to fight the English, since it will bring his country to\ndestruction and himself to disgrace and death, as at last, in the\nwords of your proverb, 'the swimmer goes down with the stream.'\"\n\nHere, as it happened, I slipped off the stone on which I was\nstanding and nearly went down with the stream myself.\n\nEmerging with my mouth full of muddy water I waited till they had\ndone laughing and continued--\n\n\"Tell that old rogue, Zikali, that I know he has murdered my\nfriends and that when we meet again he and all who were in the\nplot shall pay for it with their lives.\"\n\nNow an irritated Zulu flung an assegai, and as the range proved\nto be shorter than I thought, for it went through Kaatje's dress,\ncausing her to scream with alarm, I ceased from eloquence, and we\nstruggled on to the further bank, where at length we were safe.\n\nThus ended this unlucky trip of mine to Zululand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\n\n\nISANDHLWANA\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had crossed the Tugela by what is known as the Middle Drift.\nA mile or so on the further side of it I was challenged by a\nyoung fellow in charge of some mounted natives, and found that I\nhad stumbled into what was known as No. 2 Column, which consisted\nof a rocket battery, three battalions of the Native Contingent\nand some troops of mounted natives, all under the command of\nColonel Durnford, R.E.\n\nAfter explanations I was taken to this officer's head-quarter\ntent.  He was a tall, nervous-looking man with a fair, handsome\nface and long side-whiskers.  One of his arms, I remember, was\nsupported by a sling, I think it had been injured in some Kaffir\nfighting.  When I was introduced to him he was very busy, having,\nI understood from some one on his staff, just received orders to\n\"operate against Matshana.\"\n\nLearning that I had come from Zululand and was acquainted with\nthe Zulus, he at once began to cross-examine me about Matshana, a\nchief of whom he seemed to know very little indeed.  I told him\nwhat I could, which was not much, and before I could give him any\ninformation of real importance, was shown out and most hospitably\nentertained at luncheon, a meal of which I partook with gratitude\nin some garments that I had borrowed from one of the officers,\nwhile my own were set in the sun to dry.  Well can I recall how\nmuch I enjoyed the first whisky and soda that I had tasted since\nI left \"the Temple,\" and the good English food by which it was\naccompanied.\n\nPresently I remembered Kaatje, whom I had left outside with some\nnative women, and went to see what had happened to her.  I found\nher finishing a hearty meal and engaged in conversation with a\nyoung gentleman who was writing in a notebook.  Afterwards I\ndiscovered that he was a newspaper correspondent.  What she told\nhim and what he imagined, I do not know, but I may as well state\nthe results at once.  Within a few days there appeared in one of\nthe Natal papers and, for aught I know, all over the earth, an\nannouncement that Mr. Allan Quatermain, a well-known hunter in\nZululand, after many adventures, had escaped from that country,\n\"together with his favourite native wife, the only survivor of\nhis extensive domestic establishment.\"  Then followed some wild\ndetails as to the murder of my other wives by a Zulu wizard\ncalled \"Road Mender, or Sick Ass\" (i.e., Opener of Roads, or\nZikali), and so on.\n\nI was furious and interviewed the editor, a mild and apologetic\nlittle man, who assured me that the despatch was printed exactly\nas it had been received, as though that bettered the case.  After\nthis I commenced an action for libel, but as I was absent through\ncircumstances over which I had no control when it came on for\ntrial, the case was dismissed.  I suppose the truth was that they\nmixed me up with a certain well-known white man in Zululand, who\nhad a large \"domestic establishment,\" but however this may be, it\nwas a long while before I heard the last of that \"favourite\nnative wife.\"\n\nLater in the day I and Kaatje, who stuck to me like a burr,\ndeparted from the camp.\n\nThe rest of our journey was uneventful, except for more\nmisunderstandings about Kaatje, one of which, wherein a clergyman\nwas concerned, was too painful to relate.  At last we reached\nMaritzburg, where I deposited Kaatje in a boarding-house kept by\nanother half-cast, and with a sigh of relief betook myself to the\nPlough Hotel, which was a long way off her.\n\nSubsequently she obtained a place as a cook at Howick, and for a\nwhile I saw her no more.\n\nAt Maritzburg, as in duty bound, I called upon various persons in\nauthority and delivered Cetewayo's message, leaving out all\nZikali's witchcraft which would have sounded absurd.  It did not\nproduce much impression as, hostilities having already occurred,\nit was superfluous.  Also no one was inclined to pay attention to\nthe words of one who was neither an official nor a military\nofficer, but a mere hunter supposed to have brought a native wife\nout of Zululand.\n\nI did, however, report the murder of Anscombe and Heda, though in\nsuch times this caused no excitement, especially as they were not\nknown to the officials concerned with such matters.  Indeed the\noccurrence never so much as got into the papers, any more than\ndid the deaths of Rodd and Marnham on the borders of Sekukuni's\ncountry.  When people are expecting to be massacred themselves,\nthey do not trouble about the past killing of others far away.\nLastly, I posted Marnham's will to the Pretoria bank, advising\nthem that they had better keep it safely until some claim arose,\nand deposited Heda's jewels and valuables in another branch of\nthe same bank in Maritzburg with a sealed statement as to how\nthey came into my possession.\n\nThese things done, I found it necessary to turn myself to the\neternal problem of earning my living.  I am a very rich man now\nas I write these reminiscences here in Yorkshire--King Solomon's\nmines made me that--but up to the time of my journey to Kukuana\nLand with my friends, Curtis and Good, although plenty of money\npassed through my hands on one occasion and another, little of it\never seemed to stick.  In this way or that it was lost or melted;\nalso I was not born one to make the best of his opportunities in\nthe way of acquiring wealth.  Perhaps this was good for me, since\nif I had gained the cash early I should not have met with the\nexperiences, and during our few transitory years, experience is\nof more real value than cash.  It may prepare us for other things\nbeyond, whereas the mere possession of a bank balance can prepare\nus for nothing in a land where gold ceases to be an object of\nworship as it is here.  Yet wealth is our god, not knowledge or\nwisdom, a fact which shows that the real essence of Christianity\nhas not yet permeated human morals.  It just runs over their\nsurface, no more, and for every eye that is turned towards the\ndivine Vision, a thousand are fixed night and day upon Mammon's\nglittering image.\n\nNow I owned certain wagons and oxen, and just then the demand for\nthese was keen.  So I hired them out to the military authorities\nfor service in the war, and incidentally myself with them.  I\ndrove what I considered a splendid bargain with an officer who\nwrote as many letters after his name as a Governor-General, but\nwas really something quite humble.  At least I thought it\nsplendid until outside his tent I met a certain transport rider\nof my acquaintance whom I had always looked upon as a perfect\nfool, who told me that not half an hour before he had got twenty\nper cent. more for unsalted oxen and very rickety wagons.\nHowever, it did not matter much in the end as the whole outfit\nwas lost at Isandhlwana, and owing to the lack of some formality\nwhich I had overlooked, I never recovered more than a tithe of\ntheir value.  I think it was that I neglected to claim within a\ncertain specified time.\n\nAt last my wagons were laden with ammunition and other Government\ngoods and I trekked over awful roads to Helpmakaar, a place on\nthe Highlands not far from Rorke's Drift where No. 3 Column was\nstationed.  Here we were delayed awhile, I and my wagons having\nmoved to a ford of the Buffalo, together with many others.  It\nwas during this time that I ventured to make very urgent\nrepresentations to certain highly placed officers, I will not\nmention which, as to the necessity of laagering, that is, forming\nfortified camps, as soon as Zululand was entered, since from my\nintimate knowledge of its people I was sure that they would\nattack in force.  These warnings of mine were received with the\nmost perfect politeness and offers of gin to drink, which all\ntransport riders were supposed to love, but in effect were\ntreated with the contempt that they were held to deserve.  The\nsubject is painful and one on which I will not dwell.  Why should\nI complain when I know that cautions from notable persons such as\nSir Melmoth Osborn, and J. J. Uys, a member of one the old Dutch\nfighting families, met with a like fate.\n\nBy the way it was while I was waiting on the banks of the river\nthat I came across an old friend of mine, a Zulu named Magepa,\nwith whom I had fought at the battle of the Tugela.  A few days\nlater this man performed an extraordinary feat in saving his\ngrandchild from death by his great swiftness in running, whereof\nI have preserved a note somewhere or other.\n\nUltimately on January 11 we received our marching orders and\ncrossed the river by the drift, the general scheme of the\ncampaign being that the various columns were to converge upon\nUlundi.  The roads, if so they can be called, were in such a\nfearful state that it took us ten days to cover as many miles.\nAt length we trekked over a stony nek about five hundred yards in\nwidth.  To the right of us was a stony eminence and to our left,\nits sheer brown cliffs of rock rising like the walls of some\ncyclopean fortress, the strange, abrupt mount of Isandhlwana,\nwhich reminded me of a huge lion crouching above the\nhill-encircled plain beyond.  At the foot of this isolated mount,\nwhereof the aspect somehow filled me with alarm, we camped on the\nnight of January 21, taking no precautions against attack by way\nof laagering the wagons.  Indeed the last thing that seemed to\noccur to those in command was that there would be serious\nfighting; men marched forward to their deaths as though they were\ngoing on a shooting-party, or to a picnic.  I even saw cricketing\nbats and wickets occupying some of the scanty space upon the\nwagons.\n\nNow I am not going to set out all the military details that\npreceded the massacre of Isandhlwana, for these are written in\nhistory.  It is enough to say that on the night of January 21,\nMajor Dartnell, who was in command of the Natal Mounted Police\nand had been sent out to reconnoitre the country beyond\nIsandhlwana, reported a strong force of Zulus in front of us.\nThereon Lord Chelmsford, the General-in-Chief, moved out from the\ncamp at dawn to his support, taking with him six companies of the\n24th regiment, together with four guns and the mounted infantry.\nThere were left in the camp two guns and about eight hundred\nwhite and nine hundred native troops, also some transport riders\nsuch as myself and a number of miscellaneous camp-followers.  I\nsaw him go from between the curtains of one of my wagons where I\nhad made my bed on the top of a pile of baggage.  Indeed I had\nalready dressed myself at the time, for that night I slept very\nill because I knew our danger, and my heart was heavy with fear.\n\nAbout ten o'clock in the morning Colonel Durnford, whom I have\nmentioned already, rode up with five hundred Natal Zulus, about\nhalf of whom were mounted, and two rocket tubes which, of course,\nwere worked by white men.  This was after a patrol had reported\nthat they had come into touch with some Zulus on the left front,\nwho retired before them.  As a matter of fact these Zulus were\nforaging in the mealie fields, since owing to the drought food\nwas very scarce in Zululand that year and the regiments were\nhungry.  I happened to see the meeting between Colonel Pulleine,\na short, stout man who was then in command of the camp, and\nColonel Durnford who, as his senior officer, took it over from\nhim, and heard Colonel Pulleine say that his orders were \"to\ndefend the camp,\" but what else passed between them I do not\nknow.\n\nPresently Colonel Durnford saw and recognized me.\n\n\"Do you think the Zulus will attack us, Mr. Quatermain?\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think so, Sir,\" I answered, \"as it is the day of the new\nmoon which they hold unlucky.  But to-morrow it may be\ndifferent.\"\n\nThen he gave certain orders, dispatching Captain George Shepstone\nwith a body of mounted natives along the ridge to the left, where\npresently they came in contact with the Zulus about three miles\naway, and making other dispositions.  A little later he moved out\nto the front with a strong escort, followed by the rocket\nbattery, which ultimately advanced to a small conical hill on the\nleft front, round which it passed, never to return again.\n\nJust before he started Colonel Durnford, seeing me still standing\nthere, asked me if I would like to accompany him, adding that as\nI knew the Zulus so well I might be useful.  I answered,\nCertainly, and called to my head driver, a man named Jan, to\nbring me my mare, the same that I had ridden out of Zululand,\nwhile I slipped into the wagon and, in addition to the beltful\nthat I wore, filled all my available pockets with cartridges for\nmy double-barrelled Express rifle.\n\nAs I mounted I gave Jan certain directions about the wagon and\noxen, to which he listened, and then to my astonishment held out\nhis hand to me, saying--\n\n\"Good-bye, Baas.  You have been a kind master to me and I thank\nyou.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because, Baas, all the Kaffirs declare that the great Zulu impi\nwill be on to us in an hour or two and eat up every man.  I can't\ntell how they know it, but so they swear.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" I answered, \"it is the day of new moon when the Zulus\ndon't fight.  Still if anything of the sort should happen, you\nand the other boys had better slip away to Natal, since the\nGovernment must pay for the wagons and oxen.\"\n\nThis I said half joking, but it was a lucky jest for Jan and the\nrest of my servants, since they interpreted it in earnest and\nwith the exception of one of them who went back to get a gun, got\noff before the Zulu horn closed round the camp, and crossed the\nriver in safety.\n\nNext moment I was cantering away after Colonel Durnford, whom I\ncaught up about a quarter of a mile from the camp.\n\nNow of course I did not see all of the terrible battle that\nfollowed and can only tell of that part of it in which I had a\nshare.  Colonel Durnford rode out about three and a half miles to\nthe left front, I really don't quite know why, for already we\nwere hearing firing on the top of the Nqutu Hills almost behind\nus, where Captain Shepstone was engaging the Zulus, or so I\nbelieve.  Suddenly we met a trooper of the Natal Carabineers\nwhose name was Whitelaw, who had been out scouting.  He reported\nthat an enormous impi was just ahead of us seated in an umkumbi,\nor semi-circle, as is the fashion of the Zulus before they\ncharge.  At least some of them, he said, were so seated, but\nothers were already advancing.\n\nPresently these appeared over the crest of the hill, ten thousand\nof them I should say, and amongst them I recognized the shields\nof the Nodwengu, the Dududu, the Nokenke and the Ingoba-makosi\nregiments.  Now there was nothing to be done except retreat, for\nthe impi was attacking in earnest.  The General Untshingwayo,\ntogether with Undabuko, Cetewayo's brother, and the chief Usibebu\nwho commanded the scouts, had agreed not to fight this day for\nthe reason I have given, because it was that of the new moon, but\ncircumstances had forced their hand and the regiments could no\nlonger be restrained.  So to the number of twenty thousand or\nmore, say one-third of the total Zulu army, they hurled\nthemselves upon the little English force that, owing to lack of\ngeneralship, was scattered here and there over a wide front and\nhad no fortified base upon which to withdraw.\n\nWe fell back to a donga which we held for a little while, and\nthen as we saw that there we should presently be overwhelmed,\nwithdrew gradually for another two miles or so, keeping off the\nZulus by our fire.  In so doing we came upon the remains of the\nrocket battery near the foot of the conical hill I have\nmentioned, which had been destroyed by some regiment that passed\nbehind us in its rush on the camp.  There lay all the soldiers\ndead, assegaied through and through, and I noticed that one young\nfellow who had been shot through the head, still held a rocket in\nhis hands.\n\nNow somewhat behind and perhaps half a mile to the right of this\nhill a long, shallow donga runs across the Isandhlwana plain.\nThis we gained, and being there reinforced by about fifty of the\nNatal Carabineers under Captain Bradstreet, held it for a long\nwhile, keeping off the Zulus by our terrible fire which cut down\nscores of them every time they attempted to advance.  At this\nspot I alone killed from twelve to fifteen of them, for if the\nbig bullet from my Express rifle struck a man, he did not live.\nMessengers were sent back to the camp for more ammunition, but\nnone arrived, Heaven knows why.  My own belief is that the\nreserve cartridges were packed away in boxes and could not be got\nat.  At last our supply began to run short, so there was nothing\nto be done except retreat upon the camp which was perhaps half a\nmile behind us.\n\nTaking advantage of a pause in the Zulu advance which had lain\ndown while waiting for reserves, Colonel Durnford ordered a\nretirement that was carried out very well.  Up to that time we\nhad lost only quite a few men, for the Zulu fire was wild and\nhigh and they had not been able to get at us with the assegai.\nAs we rode towards the mount I observed that firing was going on\nin all directions, especially on the nek that connected it with\nthe Nqutu range where Captain Shepstone and his mounted Basutos\nwere wiped out while trying to hold back the Zulu right horn.\nThe guns, too, were firing heavily and doing great execution.\n\nAfter this all grew confused.  Colonel Durnford gave orders to\ncertain officers who came up to him, Captain Essex was one and\nLieutenant Cochrane another.  Then his force made for their\nwagons to get more ammunition.  I kept near to the Colonel and a\nwhile later found myself with him and a large, mixed body of men\na little to the right of the nek which we had crossed in our\nadvance from the river.  Not long afterwards there was a cry of\n\"The Zulus are getting round us!\" and looking to the left I saw\nthem pouring in hundreds across the ridge that joins Isandhlwana\nMountain to the Nqutu Range.  Also they were advancing straight\non to the camp.\n\nThen the rout began.  Already the native auxiliaries were\nslipping away and now the others followed.  Of course this battle\nwas but a small affair, yet I think that few have been more\nterrible, at any rate in modern times.  The aspect of those\nplumed and shielded Zulus as they charged, shouting their\nwar-cries and waving their spears, was awesome.  They were mown\ndown in hundreds by the Martini fire, but still they came on, and\nI knew that the game was up.  A maddened horde of fugitives,\nmostly natives, began to flow past us over the nek, making for\nwhat was afterwards called Fugitives' Drift, nine miles away, and\nwith them went white soldiers, some mounted, some on foot.\nMingled with all these people, following them, on either side of\nthem, rushed Zulus, stabbing as they ran.  Other groups of\nsoldiers formed themselves into rough squares, on which the\nsavage warriors broke like water on a rock.  By degrees ammunition\nran out; only the bayonet remained.  Still the Zulus could not\nbreak those squares.  So they took another counsel.  Withdrawing\na few paces beyond the reach of the bayonets, they overwhelmed\nthe soldiers by throwing assegais, then rushed in and finished\nthem.\n\nThis was what happened to us, among whom were men of the 24th,\nNatal Carabineers and Mounted Police.  Some had dismounted, but I\nsat on my horse, which stood quite still, I think from fright,\nand fired away so long as I had any ammunition.  With my very\nlast cartridge I killed the Captain Indudu who had been in charge\nof the escort that conducted me to the Tugela.  He had caught\nsight of me and called out--\n\n\"Now, Macumazahn, I will cut you up nicely as I promised.\"\n\nHe got no further in his speech, for at that moment I sent an\nExpress bullet through him and his tall, melancholy figure\ndoubled up and collapsed.\n\nAll this while Colonel Durnford had been behaving as a British\nofficer should do.  Scorning to attempt flight, whenever I looked\nround I caught sight of his tall form, easy to recognize by the\nlong fair moustaches and his arm in a sling, moving to and fro\nencouraging us to stand firm and die like men.  Then suddenly I\nsaw a Kaffir, who carried a big old smooth-bore gun, aim at him\nfrom a distance of about twenty yards, and fire.  He went down,\nas I believe dead, and that was the end of a very gallant officer\nand gentleman whose military memory has in my opinion been most\nunjustly attacked.  The real blame for that disaster does not\nrest upon the shoulders of either Colonel Durnford or Colonel\nPulleine.\n\nAfter this things grew very awful.  Some fled, but the most stood\nand died where they were.  Oddly enough during all this time I\nwas never touched.  Men fell to my right and left and in front of\nme; bullets and assegais whizzed past me, yet I remained quite\nunhurt.  It was as though some Power protected me, which no doubt\nit did.\n\nAt length when nearly all had fallen and I had nothing left to\ndefend myself with except my revolver, I made up my mind that it\nwas time to go.  My first impulse was to ride for the river nine\nmiles away.  Looking behind me I saw that the rough road was full\nof Zulus hunting down those who tried to escape.  Still I thought\nI would try it, when suddenly there flashed across my brain the\nsaying of whoever it was that personated Mameena in the Valley of\nBones, to the effect that in the great rout of the battle I was\nnot to join the flying but to set my face towards Ulundi and that\nif I did so I should be protected and no harm would come to me.\nI knew that all this prophecy was but a vain thing fondly\nimagined, although it was true that the battle and the rout had\ncome.  And yet I acted on it--why Heaven knows alone.\n\nSetting the spurs to my horse I galloped off past Isandhlwana\nMount, on the southern slopes of which a body of the 24th were\nstill fighting their last fight, and heading for the Nqutu Range.\nThe plain was full of Zulus, reserves running up; also to the\nright of me the Ulundi and Gikazi divisions were streaming\nforward.  These, or some of them, formed the left horn of the\nimpi, but owing to the unprepared nature of the Zulu battle, for\nit must always be remembered that they did not mean to fight that\nday, their advance had been delayed until it was too late for\nthem entirely to enclose the camp.  Thus the road, if it can so\nbe called, to Fugitives' Drift was left open for a while, and by\nit some effected their escape.  It was this horn, or part of it,\nthat afterwards moved on and attacked Rorke's Drift, with results\ndisastrous to itself.\n\nFor some hundreds of yards I rode on thus recklessly, because\nrecklessness seemed my only chance.  Thrice I met bodies of\nZulus, but on each occasion they scattered before me, calling out\nwords that I could not catch.  It was as though they were\nfrightened of something they saw about me.  Perhaps they thought\nthat I was mad to ride thus among them.  Indeed I must have\nlooked mad, or perhaps there was something else.  At any rate I\nbelieved that I was going to win right through them when an\naccident happened.\n\nA bullet struck my mare somewhere in the back.  I don't know\nwhere it came from, but as I saw no Zulu shoot, I think it must\nhave been one fired by a soldier who was still fighting on the\nslopes of the mount.  The effect of it was to make the poor beast\nquite ungovernable.  Round she wheeled and galloped at headlong\nspeed back towards the peak, leaping over dead and dying and\nbreaking through the living as she went.  In two minutes we were\nrushing up its northern flank, which seemed to be quite\nuntenanted, towards the sheer brown cliff which rose above it,\nfor the fighting was in progress on the other side.  Suddenly at\nthe foot of this cliff the mare stopped, shivered and sank down\ndead, probably from internal bleeding.\n\nI looked about me desperately.  To attempt the plain on foot\nmeant death.  What then was I to do?  Glancing at the cliff I saw\nthat there was a gully in it worn by thousands of years of\nrainfall, in which grew scanty bushes.  Into this I ran, and\nfinding it practicable though difficult, began to climb upwards,\nquite unnoticed by the Zulus who were all employed upon the\nfurther side.  The end of it was that I reached the very crest of\nthe mount, a patch of bare, brown rock, except at one spot on its\nsouthern front where there was a little hollow in which at this\nrainy season of the year herbage and ferns grew in the\naccumulated soil, also a few stunted, aloe-like plants.\n\nInto this patch I crept, having first slaked my thirst from a\nlittle pool of rain water that lay in a cup-like depression of\nthe rock, which tasted more delicious than any nectar, and seemed\nto give me new life.  Then covering myself as well as I could\nwith grasses and dried leaves from the aloe plants, I lay still.\n\nNow I was right on the brink of the cliff and had the best view\nof the Isandhlwana plain and the surrounding country that can be\nimagined.  From my lofty eyrie some hundreds of feet in the air,\nI could see everything that happened beneath.  Thus I witnessed\nthe destruction of the last of the soldiers on the slopes below.\nThey made a gallant end, so gallant that I was proud to be of the\nsame blood with them.  One fine young fellow escaped up the peak\nand reached a plateau about fifty feet beneath me.  He was\nfollowed by a number of Zulus, but took refuge in a little cave\nwhence he shot three or four of them; then his cartridges were\nexhausted and I heard the savages speaking in praise of\nhim--dead.  I think he was the last to die on the field of\nIsandhlwana.\n\nThe looting of the camp began; it was a terrible scene.  The oxen\nand those of the horses that could be caught were driven away,\nexcept certain of the former which were harnessed to the guns and\nsome of the wagons and, as I afterwards learned, taken to Ulundi\nin proof of victory.  Then the slain were stripped and Kaffirs\nappeared wearing the red coats of the soldiers and carrying their\nrifles.  The stores were broken into and all the spirits drunk.\nEven the medical drugs were swallowed by these ignorant men, with\nthe result that I saw some of them reeling about in agony and\nothers fall down and go to sleep.\n\nAn hour or two later an officer who came from the direction in\nwhich the General had marched, cantered right into the camp where\nthe tents were still standing and even the flag was flying.  I\nlonged to be able to warn him, but could not.  He rode up to the\nheadquarters marquee, whence suddenly issued a Zulu waving a\ngreat spear.  I saw the officer pull up his horse, remain for a\nmoment as though indecisive, then turn and gallop madly away,\nquite unharmed, though one or two assegais were thrown and many\nshots fired at him.  After this considerable movements of the\nZulus went on, of which the net result was, that they evacuated\nthe place.\n\nNow I hoped that I might escape, but it was not to be, since on\nevery side numbers of them crept up Isandhlwana Mountain and hid\nbehind rocks or among the tall grasses, evidently for purposes of\nobservation.  Moreover some captains arrived on the little\nplateau where was the cave in which the soldier had been killed,\nand camped there.  At least at sundown they unrolled their mats\nand ate, though they lighted no fire.\n\nThe darkness fell and in it escape for me from that guarded place\nwas impossible, since I could not see where to set my feet and\none false step on the steep rock would have meant my death.  From\nthe direction of Rorke's Drift I could hear continuous firing;\nevidently some great fight was going on there, I wondered\nvaguely--with what result.  A little later also I heard the\ndistant tramp of horses and the roll of gun wheels.  The captains\nbelow heard it too and said one to another that it was the\nEnglish soldiers returning, who had marched out of the camp at\ndawn.  They debated one with another whether it would be possible\nto collect a force to fall upon them, but abandoned the idea\nbecause the regiments who had fought that day were now at a\ndistance and too tired, and the others had rushed forward with\norders to attack the white men on and beyond the river.\n\nSo they lay still and listened, and I too lay still and listened,\nfor on that cloudy, moonless night I could see nothing.  I heard\nsmothered words of command.  I heard the force halt because it\ncould not travel further in the gloom.  Then they lay down, the\nliving among the dead, wondering doubtless if they themselves\nwould not soon be dead, as of course must have happened had the\nZulu generalship been better, for if even five thousand men had\nbeen available to attack at dawn not one of them could have\nescaped.  But Providence ordained it otherwise.  Some were taken\nand the others left.\n\nAbout an hour before daylight I heard them stirring again, and\nwhen its first gleams came all of them had vanished over the nek\nof slaughter, with what thoughts in their hearts, I wondered, and\nto what fate.  The captains on the plateau beneath had gone also,\nand so had the circle of guards upon the slopes of the mount, for\nI saw these depart through the grey mist.  As the light gathered,\nhowever, I observed bodies of men collecting on the nek, or\nrather on both neks, which made it impossible for me to do what I\nhad hoped, and run to overtake the English troops.  From these I\nwas utterly cut off.  Nor could I remain longer without food on\nmy point of rock, especially as I was sure that soon some Zulus\nwould climb there to use it as an outlook post.  So while I was\nstill more or less hidden by the mist and morning shadows, I\nclimbed down it by the same road that I had climbed up, and thus\nreached the plain.  Not a living man, white or black, was to be\nseen, only the dead, only the dead.  I was the last Englishman to\nstand upon the plain of Isandhlwana for weeks or rather months to\ncome.\n\nOf all my experiences this was, I think, the strangest, after\nthat night of hell, to find myself alone upon this field of\ndeath, staring everywhere at the distorted faces which on the\nprevious morn I had seen so full of life.  Yet my physical needs\nasserted themselves.  I was very hungry, who for twenty-four\nhours had eaten nothing, faint with hunger indeed.  I passed a\nprovision wagon that had been looted by the Zulus.  Tins of bully\nbeef lay about, also, among a wreck of broken glass, some bottles\nof Bass's beer which had escaped their notice.  I found an\nassegai, cleaned it in the ground which it needed, and opening\none of the tins, lay down in a tuft of grass by a dead man, or\nrather between him and some Zulus whom he had killed, and\ndevoured its contents.  Also I knocked the tops off a couple of\nthe beer bottles and drank my fill.  While I was doing this a\nlarge rough dog with a silver-mounted collar on its neck, I think\nof the sort that is called an Airedale terrier, came up to me\nwhining.  At first I thought it was an hyena, but discovering my\nmistake, threw it some bits of meat which it ate greedily.\nDoubtless it had belonged to some dead officer, though there was\nno name on the collar.  The poor beast, which I named Lost, at\nonce attached itself to me, and here I may say that I kept it\ntill its death, which occurred of jaundice at Durban not long\nbefore I started on my journey to King Solomon's Mines.  No man\never had a more faithful friend and companion.\n\nWhen I had eaten and drunk I looked about me, wondering what I\nshould do.  Fifty yards away I saw a stout Basuto pony still\nsaddled and bridled, although the saddle was twisted out of its\nproper position, which was cropping the grass as well as it could\nwith the bit in its mouth.  Advancing gently I caught it without\ntrouble, and led it back to the plundered wagon.  Evidently from\nthe marks upon the saddlery it had belonged to Captain\nShepstone's force of mounted natives.\n\nHere I filled the large saddlebags made of buckskin with tins of\nbeef, a couple more bottles of beer and a packet of tandstickor\nmatches which I was fortunate enough to find.  Also I took the\nMartini rifle from a dead soldier, together with a score or so of\ncartridges that remained in his belt, for apparently he must have\nbeen killed rather early in the fight.\n\nThus equipped I mounted the pony and once more bethought me of\nescaping to Natal.  A look towards the nek cured me of that idea,\nfor coming over it I saw the plumed heads of a whole horde of\nwarriors.  Doubtless these were returning from the unsuccessful\nattack on Rorke's Drift, though of that I knew nothing at the\ntime.  So whistling to the dog I bore to the left for the Nqutu\nHills, riding as fast as the rough ground would allow, and in\nhalf an hour was out of sight of that accursed plain.\n\nOne more thing too I did.  On its confines I came across a group\nof dead Zulus who appeared to have been killed by a shell.\nDismounting I took the headdress of one of them and put it on,\nfor I forgot to say that I had lost my hat.  It was made of a\nband of otterskin from which rose large tufts of the black\nfeathers of the finch which the natives call \"sakabula.\"  Also I\ntied his kilt of white oxtails about my middle, precautions to\nwhich I have little doubt I owe my life, since from a distance\nthey made me look like a Kaffir mounted on a captured pony.\n\nThen I started on again, whither I knew not.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\n\n\nALLAN AWAKES\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I have no intention of setting down all the details of that\ndreadful journey through Zululand, even if I could recall them,\nwhich, for a reason to be stated, I cannot do.  I remember that\nat first I thought of proceeding to Ulundi with some wild idea of\nthrowing myself on the mercy of Cetewayo under pretence that I\nbrought him a message from Natal.  Within a couple of hours,\nhowever, from the top of a hill I saw ahead of me an impi and\nwith it captured wagons, which was evidently heading for the\nking's kraal.  So as I knew what kind of a greeting these\nwarriors would give me, I bore away in another direction with the\nhope of reaching the border by a circuitous route.  In this too I\nhad no luck, since presently I caught sight of outposts stationed\nupon rocks, which doubtless belonged to another impi or regiment.\nIndeed one soldier, thinking from my dress that I also was a\nZulu, called to me for news from about half a mile away, in that\npeculiar carrying voice which Kaffirs can command.  I shouted\nback something about victory and that the white men were wiped\nout, then put an end to the conversation by vanishing into a\npatch of dense bush.\n\nIt is a fact that after this I have only the dimmest recollection\nof what happened.  I remember off-saddling at night on several\noccasions.  I remember being very hungry because all the food was\neaten and the dog, Lost, catching a bush buck fawn, some of which\nI partially cooked on a fire of dead wood, and devoured.  Next I\nremember--I suppose this was a day or two later--riding at night\nin a thunderstorm and a particularly brilliant flash of lightning\nwhich revealed scenery that seemed to be familiar to me, after\nwhich came a shock and total unconsciousness.\n\n\nAt length my mind returned to me.  It was reborn very slowly and\nwith horrible convulsions, out of the womb of death and terror.\nI saw blood flowing round me in rivers, I heard the cries of\ntriumph and of agony.  I saw myself standing, the sole survivor,\non a grey field of death, and the utter loneliness of it ate into\nmy soul, so that with all its strength it prayed that it might be\nnumbered in this harvest.  But oh! it was so strong, that soul\nwhich could not, would not die or fly away.  So strong, that\nthen, for the first time, I understood its immortality and that\nit could _never_ die.  This everlasting thing still clung for a\nwhile to the body of its humiliation, the mass of clay and nerves\nand appetites which it was doomed to animate, and yet knew its\nown separateness and eternal individuality.  Striving to be free\nof earth, still it seemed to walk the earth, a spirit and a\nshadow, aware of the hatefulness of that to which it was chained,\nas we might imagine some lovely butterfly to be that is fated by\nnature to suck its strength from carrion, and remains unable to\nsoar away into the clean air of heaven.\n\nSomething touched my hand and I reflected dreamily that if I had\nbeen still alive, for in a way I believed that I was dead, I\nshould have thought it was a dog's tongue.  With a great effort I\nlifted my arm, opened my eyes and looked at the hand against the\nlight, for there was light, to see it was so thin that this light\nshone through between the bones.  Then I let it fall again, and\nlo! it rested on the head of a dog which went on licking it.\n\nA dog!  What dog?  Now I remembered; one that I had found on the\nfield of Isandhlwana.  Then I must be still alive.  The thought\nmade me cry, for I could feel the tears run down my cheeks, not\nwith joy but with sorrow.  I did not wish to go on living.  Life\nwas too full of struggle and of bloodshed and bereavement and\nfear and all horrible things.  I was prepared to exchange my part\nin it just for rest, for the blessing of deep, unending sleep in\nwhich no more dreams could come, no more cups of joy could be\nheld to thirsting lips, only to be snatched away.\n\nI heard something shuffling towards me at which the dog growled,\nthen seemed to slink away as though it were afraid.  I opened my\neyes again, looked, and closed them once more in terror, for what\nI saw suggested that perhaps I was dead after all and had reached\nthat hell which a certain class of earnest Christian promises to\nus as the reward of the failings that Nature and those who begat\nus have handed on to us as a birth doom.  It was something\nunnatural, grey-headed, terrific--doubtless a devil come to\ntorment me in the inquisition vaults of Hades.  Yet I had known\nthe like when I was alive.  How had it been called?  I\nremembered, \"The-thing-that-never-should-have-been-born.\"  Hark!\nIt was speaking in that full deep voice which was unlike to any\nother.\n\n\"Greeting, Macumazahn,\" it said.  \"I see that you have come back\nfrom among the dead with whom you have been dwelling for a moon\nand more.  It is not wise of you, Macumazahn, yet I am glad who\nhave matched my skill against Death and won, for now you will\nhave much to tell me about his kingdom.\"\n\nSo it was Zikali--Zikali who had butchered my friends.\n\n\"Away from me, murderer!\" I said faintly, \"and let me die, or\nkill me as you did the others.\"\n\nHe laughed, but very softly, not in his usual terrific fashion,\nrepeating the word \"murderer\" two or three times.  Then with his\ngreat hand he lifted my head gently as a woman might, saying--\n\n\"Look before you, Macumazahn.\"\n\nI looked and saw that I was in some kind of a cave.  Outside the\nsun was setting and against its brightness I perceived two\nfigures, a white man and a white woman who were walking hand in\nhand and gazing into each other's eyes.  They were Anscombe and\nHeda passing the mouth of the cave.\n\n\"Behold the murdered, O Macumazahn, dealer of hard words.\"\n\n\"It is only a trick,\" I murmured.  \"Kaatje saw them dead and\nburied.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I forgot.  The fat fool-woman saw them dead and\nburied.  Well, sometimes the dead come to life again and for good\npurpose, as you should know, Macumazahn, who followed the counsel\nof a certain Mameena and wandered here instead of rushing onto\nthe Zulu spears.\"\n\nI tried to think the thing out and could not, so only asked--\n\n\"How did I come?  What happened to me?\"\n\n\"I think the sun smote you first who had no covering on your head\nand the lightning smote you afterwards.  Yet all the while that\nreason had left you, One led your horse and after the Heavens had\ntried to kill you and failed, perhaps because my magic was too\nstrong for them, One sent that beast which you found, yes, sent\nit here to lead us to where you lay.  There you were discovered\nand brought hither.  Now sleep lest you should go further than\neven I can fetch you back again.\"\n\nHe held his hands above my head, seeming to grow in stature till\nhis white hair touched the roof of the cave, and in an instant I\nfancied that I was falling away, deep, deep into a gulf of\nnothingness.\n\nThere followed another period of dreaming, in which dreams I\nseemed to meet all sorts of people, dead and living, especially\nLady Ragnall, a friend of mine with whom I had been concerned in\na very strange adventure among the Kendah people* and with whom\nin days to come I was destined to be concerned again, although of\ncourse I knew nothing of this, in a still stranger adventure of\nwhat I may call a spiritual order, which I may or may not try to\nreduce to writing.  It seemed to me that I was constantly dining\nwith her tete-a-tete and that she told me all sorts of queer\nthings between the courses.  Doubtless these illusions occurred\nwhen I was fed.\n\n[*--See the book called _The Ivory Child._--EDITOR.]\n\nAt length I woke up again, feeling much stronger, and saw the\ndog, Lost, watching me with its great tender eyes--oh! they talk\nof the eyes of women, but are they ever as beautiful as those of\na loving dog?  It lay by my low bed-stead, a rough affair\nfashioned of poles and strung with rimpis or strings of raw hide,\nand by it, stroking its head, sat the witch-doctoress, Nombe.  I\nremember how pleasing she looked, a perfect type of the eternal\nfeminine with her graceful, rounded shape and her continual,\nmysterious smile which suggested so much more than any mortal\nwoman has to give.\n\n\"Good-day to you, Macumazahn,\" she said in her gentle voice, \"you\nhave gone through much since last we met on the night before Goza\ntook you away to Ulundi.\"\n\nNow remembering all, I was filled with indignation against this\nlittle humbug.\n\n\"The last time we met, Nombe,\" I said, \"was when you played the\npart of a woman who is dead in the Vale of Bones by the king's\nkraal.\"\n\nShe regarded me with a kindly commiseration, and answered,\nshaking her head--\n\n\"You have been very ill, Macumazahn, and your spirit still tricks\nyou.  I played the part of no woman in any valley by the king's\nkraal, nor were my eyes rejoiced with the sight of you there or\nelsewhere till they brought you to this place, so changed that I\nshould scarcely have known you.\"\n\n\"You little liar!\" I said rudely.\n\n\"Do the white people always name those liars who tell them true\nthings they cannot understand?\" she inquired with a sweet\ninnocence.  Then without waiting for an answer, she patted my\nhand as though I were a fretful child and gave me some soup in a\ngourd, saying, \"Drink it, it is good.  The lady Heddana made it\nherself in the white man's fashion.\"\n\nI drank the soup, which was very good, and as I handed back the\ngourd, answered--\n\n\"Kaatje has told me that the lady Heddana is dead.  Can the dead\nmake soup?\"\n\nShe considered the point while she threw some bits of meat out of\nthe bottom of the gourd to the dog, Lost, then replied--\n\n\"I do not know, Macumazahn, or indeed whether the dead eat as we\ndo.  Next time my Spirit visits me I will make inquiry and tell\nyou the answer.  But I do know that it is very strange that you,\nwho always turn your back upon the truth, are so ready to accept\nfalsehoods.  Why should you believe that the lady Heddana is dead\njust because Kaatje told you so, when I who am still alive had\nsworn to you that I would protect her with my life?  Nay, speak\nno more now.  To-morrow if you are well enough you shall see and\njudge for yourself.\"\n\nShe drew up the kaross over me, again patted my hand in her\nmotherly fashion and departed, still smiling, after which I went\nto sleep again, so dreamlessly that I think there was some native\nsoporific in that soup.\n\nOn the following day two of Zikali's servants who did the rougher\nwork of my sick room, if I may so call it, arrived and said that\nthey were going to carry me out of the cave for a while, if that\nwere my will.  I who longed to breathe the fresh air again, said\nthat it was very much my will, whereon they grasped the rough\nbedstead which I have described by either end and very carefully\nbore me down the cave and through its narrow entrance, where they\nset the bedstead in the shadow of the overhanging rock without.\nWhen I had recovered a little, for even that short journey tired\nme, I looked about me and perceived that as I had expected, I was\nin the Black Kloof, for there in front of me were the very huts\nwhich we had occupied on our arrival from Swazi-Land.\n\nI lay a while drawing in the sweet air which to me was like a\ndraught of nectar, and wondering whether I were not still in a\ndream.  For instance, I wondered if I had truly seen the figures\nof Anscombe and Heda pass the mouth of the cave, on that day when\nI awoke, or if these were but another of Zikali's illusions\nimprinted on my weakened mind by his will power.  For of what he\nand Nombe told me I believed nothing.  Thus marvelling I fell\ninto a doze and in my doze heard whisperings.  I opened my eyes\nand lo! there before me stood Anscombe and Heda.  It was she who\nspoke the first, for I was tongue-tied; I could not open my lips.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Quatermain, dear Mr. Quatermain!\" she murmured in her\nsweet voice, then paused.\n\nNow at last words came to me.  \"I thought you were both dead,\" I\nsaid.  \"Tell me, are you really alive?\"\n\nShe bent down and kissed my brow, while Anscombe took my hand.\n\n\"Now you know,\" she answered.  \"We are both of us alive and\nwell.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" I exclaimed.  \"Kaatje swore that she saw you dead\nand buried.\"\n\n\"One sees strange things in the Black Kloof,\" replied Anscombe\nspeaking for the first time, \"and much has happened to us since\nwe were parted, to which you are not strong enough to listen now.\nWhen you are better, then we will tell you all.  So grow well as\nsoon as you can.\"\n\nAfter this I think I fainted, for when I came to myself again I\nwas back in the cave.\n\nAnother ten days or so went by before I could even leave my bed,\nfor my recovery was very slow.  Indeed for weeks I could scarcely\nwalk at all, and six whole months passed before I really got my\nstrength again and became as I used to be.  During those days I\noften saw Anscombe and Heda, but only for a few minutes at a\ntime.  Also occasionally Zikali would visit me, speaking a\nlittle, generally about past history, or something of the sort,\nbut never of the war, and go away.  At length one day he said to\nme--\n\n\"Macumazahn, now I am sure you are going to live, a matter as to\nwhich I was doubtful, even after you seemed to recover.  For,\nMacumazahn, you have endured three shocks, of which to-day I am\nnot afraid to talk to you.  First there was that of the battle of\nIsandhlwana where you were the last white man left alive.\"\n\n\"How do you know that, Zikali?\" I asked.\n\n\"It does not matter.  I do know.  Did you not ride through the\nZulus who parted this way and that before you, shouting what you\ncould not understand? One of them you may remember even saluted\nwith his spear.\"\n\n\"I did, Zikali.  Tell me, why did they behave thus, and what did\nthey shout?\"\n\n\"I shall not tell you, Macumazahn.  Think over it for the rest of\nyour life and conclude what you choose; it will not be so\nwonderful as the truth.  At least they did so, as a certain doll\nI dressed up yonder in the Vale of Bones told you they would, she\nwhose advice you followed in riding towards Ulundi instead of\nback to the river where you would have met your death, like so\nmany others of the white people.\"\n\n\"Who was that doll, Zikali?\"\n\n\"Nay, ask me not.  Perhaps it was Nombe, perhaps another.  I have\nforgotten.  I am very old and my memory begins to play me strange\ntricks.  Still I recollect that she was a good doll, so like a\ndead woman called Mameena that I could scarcely have known them\napart.  Ah! that was a great game I played in the Vale of Bones,\nwas it not, Macumazahn?\"\n\n\"Yes, Zikali, yet I do not understand why it was played.\"\n\n\"Being so young you still have the impatience of youth,\nMacumazahn, although your hair grows white.  Wait a while and you\nwill understand all.  Well, you lay that night on the topmost\nrock of Isandhlwana, and there you saw and heard strange things.\nYou heard the rest of the white soldiers come and lie down to\nrest among their dead brothers, and depart again unharmed.  Oh!\nwhat fools are these Zulu generals nowadays.  They send out an\nimpi to attack men behind walls, spears against rifles, and are\ndefeated.  Had they kept that impi to fall on the rest of the\nEnglish when they walked into the trap, not a man of your people\nwould have been left alive.  Would that have happened in the time\nof Chaka?\"\n\n\"I think not, Zikali.  Still I am glad that it did happen.\"\n\n\"I think not too, Macumazahn, but small men, small wit.  Also\nlike you I am glad that it did not happen, since it is the Zulus\nI hate, not the English who have now learned a lesson and will\nnot be caught again.  Oh! many a captain in Zululand is to-day\nflat as a pricked bladder, and even their victory, as they call\nit, cost them dear.  For, mind you, Macumazahn, for every white\nman they killed two of them died.  So, so!  In the morning you\nleft the hill--do not look astonished, Macumazahn.  Perhaps those\ncaptains on the rock beneath you let you go for their own\npurposes, or because they were commanded, for though weak I can\nstill lift a stone or two, Macumazahn, and afterwards told me all\nabout it.  Then you found yourself alone among the dead, like the\nlast man in the world, Macumazahn, and that dog at your side,\nalso a horse came to you.  Perhaps I sent them, perhaps it was a\nchance.  Who knows?  Not I myself, for as I have said, my memory\nhas grown so bad.  That was your first shock, Macumazahn, the\nshock of standing alone among the dead like the last man in the\nworld.  You felt it, did you not?\"\n\n\"As I hope I shall never feel anything again.  It nearly drove me\nmad,\" I answered.\n\n\"Very nearly indeed, though I have felt worse things and only\nlaughed, as I would tell you, had I the time.  Well, then the sun\nstruck you, for at this season of the year it is very hot in\nthose valleys for a white man with no covering to his head, and\nyou went quite mad, though fortunately the dog and the horse\nremained as Heaven had made them.  That was the second shock.\nThen the storm burst and the lightning fell.  It ran down the\nrifle that you still carried, Macumazahn.  I will show it to you\nand you will see that its stock is shattered.  Perhaps I turned\nthe flash aside, for I am a great thunder-herd, or perhaps it was\nOne mightier than I.  That was the third shock, Macumazahn.  Then\nyou were found, still living--how, the white man, your friend,\nwill tell you.  But you should cherish that dog of yours,\nMacumazahn, for many a man might have served you worse.  And\nbeing strong, though small, or perhaps because you still have\nwork left to do in the world before you leave it for a while, you\nhave lived through all these things and will in time recover,\nthough not yet.\"\n\n\"I hope so, Zikali, though on the whole I am not sure that I wish\nto recover.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do, Macumazahn, because the religion of you white men\nmakes you fear death and what may come after it.  You think of\nwhat you call your sins and are afraid lest you should be\ntortured because of them, not understanding that the spirit must\nbe judged not by what the flesh has done but by what the spirit\ndesired to do, by _will_ not by _deed,_ Macumazahn.  The evil man\nis he who wishes to do evil, not he who wishes to do good and\nfalls now and again into evil.  Oh! I have hearkened to your\nwhite teachers and I know, I know.\"\n\n\"Then by your own standard you are evil, Zikali, since you wished\nto bring about war, and not in vain.\"\n\n\"Oho! Macumazahn, you think that, do you, who cannot understand\nthat what seems to be evil is often good.  I wished to bring\nabout war and brought it about, and maybe what bred the wish was\nall that I have suffered in the past.  But say you, who have seen\nwhat the Zulu Power means, who have seen men, women and children\nkilled by the thousand to feed that Power, and who have seen,\ntoo, what the English Power means, is it evil that I should wish\nto destroy the House of the Zulu kings that the English House may\ntake its place and that in a time to come the Black people may be\nfree?\"\n\n\"You are clever, Zikali, but it is of your own wrongs that you\nthink.  How about that skull which you kissed in the Vale of\nBones?\"\n\n\"Mayhap, Macumazahn, but my wrongs are the wrongs of a nation,\ntherefore I think of the nation, and at least I do not fear death\nlike you white men.  Now hearken.  Presently your friends will\ntell you a story.  The lady Heddana will tell you how I made use\nof her for a certain purpose, for which purpose indeed I drew the\nthree of you into Zululand, because without her I could not have\nbrought about this war into which Cetewayo did not wish to enter.\nWhen you have heard that story, do not judge me too hardly,\nMacumazahn, who had a great end to gain.\"\n\n\"Yet whatever the story may be, I do judge you hardly, Zikali,\nwho tormented me with a false tale, causing the woman Kaatje to\nlie to me and swear that she saw these two dead before her--how I\nknow not.\"\n\n\"She did not lie to you, Macumazahn.  Has not such a one as I the\npower to make a fat fool think that she saw what she did not see?\nAs to how!  How did I make you think in yonder hut of mine that\nyou saw what you did not see--perhaps.\"\n\n\"But why did you mock me in this fashion, Zikali?\"\n\n\"Truly, Macumazahn, you are blind as a bat in sunlight.  When\nyour friends have told you the story, you will understand why.\nYet I admit to you that things went wrong.  You should have heard\nthat tale _before_ Cetewayo brought you to the Vale of Bones.\nBut the fool-woman delayed and blundered, and when she reached\nUlundi the gates were shut against her as a spy, and not opened\ntill too late, so that you only found her when you returned from\nthe Council.  I knew this, and that was why I dared to bid you\nfire at that which stood upon the rock.  Had you heard Kaatje's\ntale you might have aimed straight, as also you would have\ncertainly shot straight at me, out of revenge for the deaths of\nthose you loved, Macumazahn, though whether you could have killed\nme before all the game is played is another matter.  As it was, I\nwas sure that you would not pierce the heart of one who _might_\nbe a certain white woman, sure also that you would not pierce my\nheart whose death _might_ bring about her death and that of\nanother.\"\n\n\"You are very subtle, Zikali,\" I said in astonishment.\n\n\"So you hold because I am very simple, who understand the spirit\nof man--and some other things.  For the rest, had you not\nbelieved that these two were dead, you would never have left\nZululand.  You would have tried to escape to get to them and have\nbeen killed.  Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I should have tried, Zikali.  But why did you keep\nthem prisoner?\"\n\n\"For the same reason that I still keep them--and you--to hold\nthem back a while from the world of ghosts.  Had I sent them away\nafter that night of the declaration of war, they would have been\nkilled before they had gone an hour's journey.  Oh! I am not so\nbad as you think, Macumazahn, and I never break my word.  Now I\nhave done.\"\n\n\"How goes the war?\" I asked as he shuffled to his feet.\n\n\"As it must go, very ill for the Zulus.  They have driven back\nthe white men who gather strength from over the Black Water and\nwill come on presently and wipe them out.  Umnyamana would have\nhad Cetewayo invade Natal and sweep it clean, as of course he\nshould have done.  But I sent him word that if he did so\nNomkubulwana, yes, she and no other, had told me that all the\nspirits would be against him, and he hearkened.  When next you\nthink me wicked, remember that, Macumazahn.  Now it is but a\nmatter of time, and here you must bide till all is finished.\nThat will be good for you who need rest, though the other two\nfind it wearisome.  Still for them it is good also to watch the\nfruit ripen on their tree of love.  It will be the sweeter when\nthey eat it, Macumazahn, and teach them how to live together.\nOho! Oho-ho!\" and he shambled off.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\n\n\nHEDA'S TALE\n\n\n\n\n\nThat evening when I was lying on my bed outside the cave, I heard\nthe tale of Anscombe and Heda.  Up to a certain point he told it,\nthen she went on with the story.\n\n\"On the morning after our arrival at this place, Allan,\" said\nAnscombe, \"I woke up to find you gone from the hut.  As you did\nnot come back I concluded that you were with Zikali, and walked\nabout looking for you.  Then food was brought to us and Heda and\nI breakfasted together, after which we went to where we heard the\nhorses neighing and found that yours was gone.  Returning, much\nfrightened, we met Nombe, who gave me your note which explained\neverything, and we inquired of her why this had been done and\nwhat was to become of us.  She smiled and answered that we had\nbetter ask the first question of the king and the second of her\nmaster Zikali, and in the meanwhile be at peace since we were\nquite safe.\n\n\"I tried to see Zikali but could not.  Then I went to inspan the\nhorses with the idea of following you, only to find that they\nwere gone.  Indeed I have not seen them from that day to this.\nNext we thought of starting on foot, for we were quite desperate.\nBut Nombe intervened and told us that if we ventured out of the\nBlack Kloof we should be killed.  In short we were prisoners.\n\n\"This went on for some days, during which we were well treated\nbut could not succeed in seeing Zikali.  At length one morning he\nsent for us and we were taken to the enclosure in front of his\nhut, Kaatje coming with us as interpreter.  For a while he sat\nstill, looking very grim and terrible.  Then he said--\n\n\"'White Chief and Lady, you think ill of me because Macumazahn\nhas gone and you are kept prisoners here, and before all is done\nyou will think worse.  Yet I counsel you to trust me since\neverything that happens is for your good.'\n\n\"At this point Heda, who, as you know, talked Zulu fairly well,\nthough not so well as she does now, broke in, and said some very\nangry things to him.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" interrupted Heda.  \"I told him that he was a liar and I\nbelieved that he had murdered you and meant to murder us.\"\n\n\"He listened stonily,\" continued Anscombe, \"and answered, 'I\nperceive, Lady Heddana, that you understand enough of our tongue\nto enable me to talk to you; therefore I will send away this\nhalf-breed woman, since what I have to say is secret.'\n\n\"Then he called servants by clapping his hands and ordered them\nto remove Kaatje, which was done.\n\n\"'Now, Lady Heddana,' he said, speaking very slowly so that Heda\nmight interpret to me and repeating his words whenever she did\nnot understand, 'I have a proposal to make to you.  For my own\nends it is necessary that you should play a part and appear\nbefore the king and the Council as the goddess of this land who\nis called the Chieftainess of Heaven, which goddess is always\nseen as a white woman.  Therefore you must travel with me to\nUlundi and there do those things which I shall tell you.'\n\n\"'And if I refuse to play this trick,' said Heda, 'what then?'\n\n\"'Then, Lady Heddana, this white lord whom you love and who is to\nbe your husband will--die--and after he is dead you must still do\nwhat I desire of you, or--die also.'\n\n\"'Would he come with me to Ulundi?' asked Heda.\n\n\"'Not so, Lady.  He would stay here under guard, but quite safe,\nand you will be brought back to him, safe.  Choose now, with\ndeath on the one hand and safety on the other.  I would sleep a\nlittle.  Talk the matter over in your own tongue and when it is\nsettled awaken me again,' and he shut his eyes and appeared to go\nto sleep.\n\n\"So we discussed the situation, if you can call it discussion\nwhen we were both nearly mad.  Heda wished to go.  I begged her\nto let me be killed rather than trust herself into the hands of\nthis old villain.  She pointed out that even if I were killed,\nwhich she admitted might not happen, she would still be in his\nhands whence she could only escape by her own death, whereas if\nshe went there was a chance that we might both continue to live,\nand that after all death was easy to find.  So in the end I gave\nway and we woke up Zikali and told him so.\n\n\"He seemed pleased and spoke to us gently, saying, 'I was sure\nthat wisdom dwelt behind those bright eyes of yours, Lady, and\nagain I promise you that neither you nor the lord your lover\nshall come to any harm.  Also that in payment I and my child,\nNombe, will protect you even with our lives, and further, that I\nwill bring back your friend, Macumazahn, to you, though not yet.\nNow go and be happy together.  Nombe will tell the lady Heddana\nwhen she is to start.  Of all this say nothing on your peril to\nthe woman Kaatje, since if you do, it will be necessary that she\nshould be made silent.  Indeed, lest she should learn something,\nto-morrow I shall send her on to await you at Ulundi, therefore\nbe not surprised if you see her go, and take no heed of aught she\nmay say in going.  Nombe, my child, will fill her place as\nservant to the lady Heddana and sleep with her at night that she\nmay not be lonely or afraid.'\n\n\"Then he clapped his hands again and servants came and conducted\nus back to the huts.  And now, Allan, Heda will go on with the\nstory.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Quatermain,\" she said, \"nothing more happened that day\nwhich we spent with bursting hearts.  Kaatje did not question us\nas to what the witch-doctor had said after she was sent away.\nIndeed I noticed that she was growing very stupid and drowsy,\nlike a person who has been drugged, as I daresay she was, and\nwould insist upon beginning to pack up the things in a foolish\nkind of way, muttering something about our trekking on the\nfollowing day.  The night passed as usual, Kaatje sleeping very\nheavily by my side and snoring so much\" (here I groaned\nsympathetically) \"that I could get little rest.  On the next\nmorning after breakfast as the huts were very hot, Nombe\nsuggested that we should sit under the shadow of the overhanging\nrock, just where we are now.  Accordingly we went, and being\ntired out with all our troubles and bad nights, I fell into a\ndoze, and so, I think, did Maurice, Nombe sitting near to us and\nsinging all the while, a very queer kind of song.\n\n\"Presently, through my doze as it were, I saw Kaatje approaching.\nNombe went to meet her, still singing, and taking her hand, led\nher to the cart, where they seemed to talk to the horses, which\nsurprised me as there were no horses.  Then she brought her round\nthe cart and pointed to us, still singing.  Now Kaatje began to\nweep and throw her hands about, while Nombe patted her on the\nshoulder.  I tried to speak to her but could not.  My tongue was\ntied, why I don't know, but I suppose because I was really\nasleep, and Maurice also was asleep and did not wake at all.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Anscombe, \"I remember nothing of all this business.\"\n\n\"After a while Kaatje went away, still weeping, and then I fell\nasleep in earnest and did not wake until the sun was going down,\nwhen I roused Maurice and we both went back to the hut, where I\nfound that Nombe had cooked our evening meal.  I looked for\nKaatje, but could not find her.  Also in searching through my\nthings I missed the bag of jewels.  I called to Nombe and asked\nwhere Kaatje was, whereon she smiled and said that she had gone\naway, taking the bag with her.  This pained me, for I had always\nfound Kaatje quite honest--\"\n\n\"Which she is,\" I remarked, \"for those jewels are now in a bank\nat Maritzburg.\"\n\nHeda nodded and went on, \"I am glad to hear it; indeed,\nremembering what Zikali had said, I never really suspected her of\nbeing a thief, but thought it was all part of some plan.  After\nthis things went on as before, except that Nombe took Kaatje's\nplace and was with me day and night.  Of Kaatje's disappearance\nshe would say nothing.  Zikali we did not see.\n\n\"On the third evening after the vanishing of Kaatje, Nombe came\nand said that I must make ready for a journey, and while she\nspoke men arrived with a litter that had grass mats hung round\nit.  Nombe brought out my long cape and put it over me, also a\nkind of veil of white stuff which she threw over my head, so as\nto hide my face.  I think it was made out of one of our\ntravelling mosquito nets.  Then she said I must say good-bye to\nMaurice for a while.  There was a scene as you may imagine.  He\ngrew angry and said that he would come with me, whereon armed men\nappeared, six of them, and pushed him away with the handles of\ntheir spears.  In another minute I was lifted into the litter\nwhich Nombe entered with me, and so we were parted, wondering if\nwe should ever see each other more.  At the mouth of the kloof I\nsaw another litter surrounded by a number of Zulus, which Nombe\nsaid contained Zikali.\n\n\"We travelled all that night and two succeeding nights, resting\nduring the day in deserted kraals that appeared to have been made\nready for us.  It was a strange journey, for although the armed\nmen flitted about us, neither they nor the bearers ever spoke,\nnor did I see Zikali, or indeed any one else.  Only Nombe\ncomforted me from time to time, telling me there was nothing to\nfear.  Towards dawn on the third night we travelled over some\nhills and I was put into a new hut and told that my journey was\ndone as we had reached a place near Ulundi.\n\n\"I slept most of the following day, but after I had eaten towards\nevening, Zikali crept into the hut, just as a great toad might\ndo, and squatted down in front of me.\n\n\"'Lady,' he said, 'listen.  To-night, perhaps one hour after\nsundown, perhaps two, perhaps three, Nombe will lead you, dressed\nin a certain fashion, from this hut.  See now, outside of it\nthere is a tongue of rock up which you may climb unnoted by the\nlittle path that runs between those big stones.  Look,' and he\nshowed me the place through the door-hole.  'The path ends on a\nflat boulder at the end of the rock.  There you will take your\nstand, holding in your right hand a little assegai which will be\ngiven to you.  Nombe will not accompany you to the rock, but she\nwill crouch between the stones at the head of the path and\nperhaps from time to time whisper to you what to do.  Thus when\nshe tells you, you must throw the little spear into the air, so\nthat it falls among a number of men gathered in debate who will\nbe seated about twenty paces from the rock.  For the rest you are\nto stand quite still, saying nothing and showing no alarm\nwhatever you may hear or see.  Among the men before you may be\nyour friend, Macumazahn, but you must not appear to recognize\nhim, and if he speaks to you, you must make no answer.  Even if\nhe should seem to shoot at you, do not be afraid.  Do you\nunderstand?  If so, repeat what I have told you.'  I obeyed him\nand asked what would happen if I did not do these things, or some\nof them.\n\n\"He answered, 'You will be killed, Nombe will be killed, the lord\nMauriti your lover will be killed, and your friend Macumazahn\nwill be killed.  Perhaps even I shall be killed and we will talk\nthe matter over in the land of ghosts.'\n\n\"On hearing this I said I would do my best to carry out his\norders, and after making me repeat them once more, he went away.\nLater, Nombe dressed me up as you saw me, Mr. Quatermain, put\nsome glittering powder into my hair and touched me beneath the\neyes with a dark kind of pigment.  Also she gave me the little\nspear and made me practise standing quite still with it raised in\nmy right hand, telling me that when I heard her say the word\n'Throw,' I was to cast it into the air.  Then the moon rose and\nwe heard men talking at a distance.  At last some one came to the\nhut and whispered to Nombe, who led me out to the little path\nbetween the rocks.\n\n\"This must have been nearly two hours after I heard the men begin\nto talk--\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" I interrupted, \"but where was Nombe all those two\nhours?\"\n\n\"With me.  She never left my side, Mr. Quatermain, and while I\nwas on the rock she was crouched within three paces of me between\ntwo big stones at the mouth of the path.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I replied faintly, \"this is very interesting.  Please\ncontinue--but one word, how was Nombe dressed?  Did she wear a\nnecklace of blue beads?\"\n\n\"Just as she always is, or rather less so, for she had nothing on\nexcept her moocha, and certainly no blue beads.  But why do you\nask?\"\n\n\"From curiosity merely.  I mean, I will tell you afterwards, pray\ngo on.\"\n\n\"Well, I stepped forward on to the rock and at first saw nothing,\nbecause at that moment the moon was hid by a cloud; indeed Nombe\nhad waited for the cloud to pass over its face, before she thrust\nme forward.  Also some smoke from a fire below was rising\nstraight in front of me.  Presently the cloud passed, the smoke\nthinned, and I saw the circle of those savage men seated beneath,\nand in their centre a great chief wearing a leopard's skin cloak\nwho I guessed was the king.  You I did not see, Mr. Quatermain,\nbecause you were behind a tree, yet I felt that you were there, a\nfriend among all those foes.  I stood still, as I had been taught\nto do, and heard the murmur of astonishment and caught the gleam\nof the moonlight from the white feathers that were sewn upon my\nrobe.\n\n\"Then I heard also the voice of Zikali speaking from beneath.  He\ncalled on you to come out to shoot at me, and the man whom I took\nto be the king, ordered you to obey.  You appeared from behind\nthe tree, and I was certain from the look upon your face that at\nthat distance you did not know who I was in my strange and\nglittering raiment.  You lifted the pistol and I was terribly\nafraid, for I had seen you shoot with it before on the verandah\nof the Temple and knew well that you do not miss.  Very nearly I\nscreamed out to you, but remembered and was silent, thinking that\nafter all it did not much matter if I died, except for the sake\nof Maurice here.  Also by now I guessed that I was being used to\ndeceive those men before me into some terrible act, and that if I\ndied, at least they would be undeceived.\n\n\"I thought that an age passed between the time you pointed the\npistol and I saw the flash for which I was waiting.\"\n\n\"You need not have waited, Heda,\" I interposed, \"for if I had\nreally aimed at you you would never have seen that flash, at\nleast so it is said.  I too guessed enough to shoot above you,\nalthough at the time I did not know that it was you on the rock;\nindeed I thought it was Nombe painted up.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard the bullet sing over me.  Then I heard the voice of\nZikali challenging you to shoot him, and to tell the truth, hoped\nthat you would do so.  Just before you fired for the second time,\nNombe whispered to me--'Throw' and I threw the little red-handled\nspear into the air.  Then as the pistol went off Nombe\nwhispered--'Come.'  I slipped away down the path and back with\nher into the hut, where she kissed me and said that I had done\nwell indeed, after which she took off my strange robe and helped\nme to put on my own dress.\n\n\"That is all I know, except that some hours later I was awakened\nfrom sleep and put into the litter where I went to sleep again,\nfor what I had gone through tired me very much.  I need not\ntrouble you with the rest, for we journeyed here in the same way\nthat we had journeyed to Ulundi--by night.  I did not see Zikali,\nbut in answer to my questions, Nombe told me that the Zulus had\ndeclared war against the English.  What part in the business I\nhad played, she would not tell me, and I do not know to this\nhour, but I am sure that it was a great one.\n\n\"So we came back to the Black Kloof, where I found Maurice quite\nwell, and now he had better go on with the tale, for if I begin\nto tell you of our meeting I shall become foolish.\"\n\n\"There isn't much more to tell,\" said Anscombe, \"except about\nyourself.  While Heda was away I was kept a prisoner and watched\nday and night by Zikali's people who would not let me stir a\nyard, but otherwise treated me kindly.  Then one day at sunrise,\nor shortly after it, Heda re-appeared and told me all this story,\nfor the end of which, as you may imagine, I thanked God.\n\n\"After that we just lived on here, happily enough since we were\ntogether, until one day Nombe told us that there had been a great\nbattle in which the Zulus had wiped out the English, killing\nhundreds and hundreds of them, although for every soldier that\nthey killed, they had lost two.  Of course this made us very sad,\nespecially as we were afraid you might be with our troops.  We\nasked Nombe if you were present at the battle.  She answered that\nshe would inquire of her Spirit and went through some very\nstrange performances with ashes and knuckle bones, after which\nshe announced that you had been in the battle but were alive and\ncoming this way with a dog that had silver on it.  We laughed at\nher, saying that she could not possibly know anything of the\nsort, also that dogs as a rule did not carry silver.  Whereon she\nonly smiled and said--'Wait.'\n\n\"I think it was three days later that one night towards dawn I\nwas awakened by hearing a dog barking outside my hut, as though\nit wished to call attention to its presence.  It barked so\npersistently and in a way so unlike a Kaffir dog, that at length\nabout dawn I went out of the hut to see what was the matter.\nThere, standing a few yards away surrounded by some of Zikali's\npeople, I saw Lost and knew at once that it was an English\nAiredale, for I have had several of the breed.  It looked very\ntired and frightened, and while I was wondering whence on earth\nit could have come, I noticed that it had a silver-mounted collar\nand remembered Nombe and her talk about you and a dog that\ncarried silver on it.  From that moment, Allan, I was certain\nthat you were somewhere near, especially as the beast ran up to\nme--it would take no notice of the Kaffirs--and kept looking\ntowards the mouth of the kloof, as though it wished me to follow\nit.  Just then Nombe arrived, and on seeing the dog looked at me\noddly.\n\n\"'I have a message for you from my master, Mauriti,' she said to\nme through Heda, who by now had arrived upon the scene, having\nalso been aroused by Lost's barking.  'It is that if you wish to\ntake a walk with a strange dog you can do so, and bring back\nanything you may find.'\"\n\n\"The end of it was that after we had fed Lost with milk and meat,\nI and six of Zikali's men started down the kloof, Lost going\nahead of us and now and again running back and whining.  At the\nmouth of the kloof it led us over a hill and down into a\nbush-veld valley where the thorns grew very thick.  When we had\ngone along the valley for about two miles, one of the Kaffirs saw\na Basuto pony still saddled, and caught it.  The dog went on past\nthe pony to a tree that had been shattered by lightning, and\nthere within a few yards of the tree we found you lying\nsenseless, Allan, or, as I thought at first, dead, and by your\nside a Martini rifle of which the stock also seemed to have been\nbroken by lightning.\n\n\"Well, we put you on a shield and carried you here, meeting no\none, and that is all the story, Allan.\"\n\nHe stopped and we stared at each other.  Then I called Lost and\npatted its head, and the dear beast licked my hand as though it\nunderstood that it was being thanked.\n\n\"A strange tale,\" I said, \"but God Almighty has put much wisdom\ninto His creatures of which we know nothing.  Let us thank Him,\"\nand in our hearts we did.\n\nThus was I rescued from death by the intelligence and fidelity of\na four-footed creature.  Doubtless in my semi-conscious state\nthat resulted from shock, weariness and sun-stroke, I had all the\nwhile headed sub-consciously and without any definite object for\nthe Black Kloof.  When I was within a few miles of it I was\nstunned by the lightning which ran down the rifle to the ground,\nthough not actually struck.  Then the dog, which had escaped,\nplayed its part, wandering about the country to find help for me,\nand so I was saved.\n\n\nNow of the long months that followed I have little to tell.  They\nwere not unhappy in their way, for week by week I felt myself\ngrowing stronger, though very slowly.  There was a path, steep,\ndifficult and secret, which could be gained through one of the\ncaves in the precipice, not that in which I slept.  This path ran\nup a water-cut kloof through a patch of thorns to a flat\ntableland that was part of the Ceza stronghold.  By it, when I\nhad gained sufficient strength, sometimes we used to climb to the\nplateau, and there take exercise.  It was an agreeable change from\nthe stifling atmosphere of the Black Kloof.  The days were very\ndull, for we were as much out of the world as though we had been\nmarooned on a desert island.  Still from time to time we heard of\nthe progress of the war through Nombe, for Zikali I saw but\nseldom.\n\nShe told of disasters to the English, of the death of a great\nyoung Chief who was deserted by his companions and died fighting\nbravely--afterwards I discovered that this was the Prince\nImperial of France--of the advance of our armies, of defeats\ninflicted upon Cetewayo's impis, and finally of the destruction\nof the Zulus on the battlefield of Ulundi, where they hurled\nthemselves by thousands upon the British square, to be swept away\nby case-shot and the hail of bullets.  This battle, by the way,\nthe Zulus call, not Ulundi or Nodwengu, for it was fought in\nfront of Panda's old kraal of that name, but Ocwecweni, which\nmeans--\"the fight of the sheet-iron fortress.\"  I suppose they\ngive it this name because the hedge of bayonets, flashing in the\nsunlight, reminded them of sheet-iron.  Or it may be because\nthese proved as impenetrable as would have done walls of iron.\nAt any rate they dashed their naked bodies against the storm of\nlead and fell in heaps, only about a dozen of our men being\nkilled, as the little graveyard in the centre of the square\nentrenchment, about which still lie the empty cartridge cases,\nrecords to-day.\n\nThere, then, on that plain perished the Zulu kingdom which was\nbuilt up by Chaka.\n\nNow it was after this event that I saw Zikali and begged him to\nlet us go.  I found him triumphant and yet strangely disturbed\nand, as I thought, more apprehensive than I had ever seen him.\n\n\"So, Zikali,\" I said, \"if what I hear is true, you have had your\nway and destroyed the Zulu people.  Now you should be happy.\"\n\n\"Is man ever happy, Macumazahn, when he has gained that which he\nsought for years?  The two out there sigh and are sad because\nthey cannot be married after their own white fashion, though what\nthere is to keep them apart I do not know.  Well, in time they\nwill be married, only to find that they are not so happy as they\nthought they would be.  Oh! a day will come when they will talk\nto each other and say--'Those moons which we spent waiting\ntogether in the Black Kloof were the true moons of sweetness, for\nthen we had something to gain; now we have gained all--and what\nis it?'\n\n\"So it is with me, Macumazahn.  Since the Zulus under Chaka\nkilled out my people, the Ndwandwe, year by year I have plotted\nand waited to see them wedded to the assegai.  Now it has come\nabout.  You white men have stamped them flat upon the plain of\nUlundi; they are no more a nation.  And yet I am not happy, for\nafter all it was the House of Senzangacona and not the people of\nthe Zulus, that harmed me and mine, and Cetewayo still lives.\nWhile the queen bee remains there may be a hive again.  While an\nember still glows in the dead ashes, the forest may yet be fired.\nPerhaps when Cetewayo is dead, then I shall be happy.  Only his\ndeath and mine are set by Fate as close together as two sister\ngrains of corn upon the cob.\"\n\nI turned the subject, again asking his leave to depart to Natal\nor to join the English army.\n\n\"You cannot go yet,\" he answered sternly, \"so trouble me no more.\nThe land is full of wandering bands of Zulus who would kill you\nand your blood would be on my head.  Moreover, if they saw a\nwhite woman who had sheltered with me, might they not guess\nsomething?  To dress a doll for the part of the Inkosazana-y-Zulu\nis the greatest crime in the world, Macumazahn, and what would\nhappen to the Opener of Roads and all his House if it were even\nbreathed that he had dressed that doll and thus brought about the\nwar which ruined them?  When Cetewayo is killed and the dead are\nburied and peace falls upon the land, the peace of death, then\nyou shall go, Macumazahn, and not before.\"\n\n\"At least, Zikali, send a message to the captains of the English\narmy and tell them that we are here.\"\n\n\"Send a message to the hyenas and tell them where the carcase is;\nsend a message to the hunters and tell them where the buck Zikali\ncrouches on its form!  Hearken, Macumazahn, if you do this, or\neven urge me again to do it, neither you nor your friends shall\never leave the Black Kloof.  I have spoken.\"\n\nThen understanding that the case was hopeless, I left him and he\nglowered after me, for fear had made him cruel.  He had won the\nlong game and success had turned to ashes in his mouth.  Or\nrather, he had not won--yet--since his war was against the House\nof Senzangacona from which he and his tribe had suffered cruel\nwrong.  To pull it down he must pull down the Zulu nation; it was\nlike burning a city to destroy a compromising letter.  He had\nburnt the city, but the letter still remained intact and might be\nproduced in evidence against him.  In other words Cetewayo yet\nlived.  Therefore his vengeance remained quite unslaked and his\ndanger was as great, or perhaps greater than it had ever been\nbefore.  For was he not the prophet who by producing the Princess\nof Heaven, the traditional goddess of the Zulus, before the eyes\nof the king and Council, had caused them to decide for war?  And\nsupposing it were so much as breathed that this spirit which they\nseemed to see, had been but a trick and a fraud, what then?  He\nwould be tortured to death if his dupes had time, or torn limb\nfrom limb if they had not, that is if he could die like other\nmen--a matter as to which personally I had no doubts.\n\nShortly after I left Zikali Heda and I ate our evening meal\ntogether.  Anscombe, as it chanced, had gone by the secret path\nto the tableland of which I have spoken, where he amused himself,\nas of course we were not allowed to fire a gun, by catching\npartridges, with the help of an ingenious system of grass nets\nwhich he had invented.  There were springs on this tableland that\nformed little pools of water, at which the partridges, also\noccasionally guineafowl and bush pheasants, came to drink at\nsunrise and sunset.  Here it was that he set his nets and retired\nto work them at those hours by means of strings that he pulled\nfrom hiding-places.  So Heda and I were alone.\n\nI told her of my ill success with Zikali, at which she was much\ndisappointed.  Then by an afterthought I suggested that perhaps\nshe might try to do something in the way of getting a message\nthrough to the English camp at Ulundi, or elsewhere, by help of\nthe witch-doctoress, Nombe, adding that I would speak to her\nmyself had I not observed that I seemed to be out of favour with\nher of late.  Heda shook her head and answered that she thought\nit would be useless to try, also too dangerous.  Remembering\nZikali's threat, on reflection I agreed with her.\n\n\"Tell me, Mr. Quatermain,\" she added, \"is it possible for one\nwoman to be in love with another?\"\n\nI stared at her and replied that I did not understand what she\nmeant, since women, so far as I had observed them, were generally\nin love either with a man or with themselves, perhaps more often\nwith the latter than the former.  Rather a cheap joke I admit,\nwith just enough truth in it to make it acceptable--in the Black\nKloof.\n\n\"So I thought,\" she answered, \"but really Nombe behaves in a most\npeculiar way.  As you know she took a fancy to me from the\nbeginning, perhaps because she had never had any other woman with\nwhom to associate, having, so far as I can make out, been brought\nup here among men from a child.  Indeed, her story is that she\nwas one of twins and therefore as the younger, was exposed to die\naccording to the Zulu superstition.  Zikali, however, or a\nservant of his who knew what was happening, rescued and reared\nher, so practically I am the only female with whom she has ever\nbeen intimate.  At any rate her affection for me has grown and\ngrown until, although it seems ungrateful to say so, it has\nbecome something of a nuisance.  She has told me again and again\nthat she would die to protect me, and that if by chance anything\nhappened to me, she would kill herself and follow me into another\nworld.  She is continually making divinations about my future,\nand as these, in which she entirely believes, always show me as\nliving without her, she is much distressed and at times bursts\ninto tears.\"\n\n\"Hysteria!  It is very common among the Zulu women, and\nespecially those of them who practise magic arts,\" I answered.\n\n\"Perhaps, but as it results in the most intense jealousy, Nombe's\nhysteria is awkward.  For instance, she is horribly jealous of\nMaurice.\"\n\n\"The instincts of a chaperone developed early,\" I suggested\nagain.\n\n\"That won't quite do, Mr. Quatermain,\" answered Heda with a\nlaugh, \"since she is even more jealous of you.  With reference to\nMaurice, she explains frankly that if we marry she might, as she\nputs it, 'continue to sit outside the hut,' but that in your case\nyou live 'in my head,' where she cannot come between you and me.\"\n\n\"Mad,\" I remarked, \"quite mad.  Still madness has to be dealt\nwith in this world like other things, and Nombe, being an\nabnormal person, may suffer from abnormal ideas.  It just amounts\nto this; she has conceived a passionate devotion to you, at which\nI am sure neither Maurice nor I can wonder.\"\n\n\"Are those the kind of compliments you used to pay in your youth,\nMr. Quatermain?  I expect so, and now that you are old you cannot\nstop them.  Well, I thank you all the same, because perhaps you\nmean what you say.  But what is to be done about Nombe?  Hush!\nhere she comes.  I will leave you to reason with her, if you get\nthe chance,\" and she departed in a hurry.\n\nNombe arrived, and something in her aspect told me that I was\ngoing to get the chance.  Her eternal smile was almost gone and\nher dark, beautiful eyes flashed ominously.  Still she began by\nasking in a mild voice whether the lady Heddana had eaten her\nsupper with appetite.  It will be observed that she was not\ninterested in my appetite or whether enough was left for Anscombe\nwhen he returned.  I replied that so far as I noted she had\nconsumed about half a partridge, with other things.\n\n\"I am glad,\" said Nombe, \"since I was not here to attend upon\nher, having been summoned to speak with the Master.\"\n\nThen she sat down and looked at me like a thunder storm.\n\n\"I nursed you when you were so ill, Macumazahn,\" she began, \"but\nnow I learn that for the milk with which I fed you, you would\nforce me to drink bitter water that will poison me.\"\n\nI replied I was well aware that without her nursing I should long\nago have been dead, which was what caused me to love her like my\nown daughter.  But would she kindly explain?  This she did at\nonce.\n\n\"You have been plotting to take away from me the lady Heddana who\nto me is as mother and sister and child.  It is useless to lie to\nme, for the Master has told me all; moreover, I knew it for\nmyself, both through my Spirit and because I had watched you.\"\n\n\"I have no intention of lying to you, Nombe, about this or any\nother matter, though I think that sometimes in the past you have\nlied to me.  Tell me, do you expect the Inkosi Mauriti, the lady\nHeddana and myself to pass the rest of our lives in the Black\nKloof, when they wish to get married and go across the Black\nWater to where their home will be, and I wish to attend to my\naffairs?\"\n\n\"I do not know what I expect, Macumazahn, but I do know that\nnever while I live will I be parted from the lady Heddana.  At\nlast I have found some one to love, and you and the other would\nsteal her away from me.\"\n\nI studied her for a while, then asked--\n\n\"Why do you not marry, Nombe, and have a husband, and children to\nlove?\"\n\n\"Marry?\" she replied.  \"I am married to my Spirit which does not\ndwell beneath the sun, and my children are not of earth;\nmoreover, all men are hateful to me,\" and her eyes added,\n\"especially you.\"\n\n\"That is a calf with a dog's head,\" I replied in the words of the\nnative proverb, meaning that she said what was not natural.\n\"Well, Nombe, if you are so fond of the lady Heddana, you had\nbetter arrange with her and the Inkosi Mauriti to go away with\nthem.\"\n\n\"You know well I cannot, Macumazahn.  I am tied to my Master by\nropes that are stronger than iron, and if I attempted to break\nthem my Spirit would wither and I should wither with it.\"\n\n\"Dear me! what a dreadful business.  That is what comes of taking\nto magic.  Well, Nombe, I am afraid I have nothing to suggest,\nnor, to tell you the truth, can I see what I have to do with the\nmatter.\"\n\nThen she sprang up in a rage, saying--\n\n\"I understand that not only will you give me no help, but that\nyou also mock at me, Macumazahn.  Moreover, as it is with you, so\nit is with Mauriti, who pretends to love my lady so much, though\nI love her more with my little finger than he does with all his\nbody and what he calls his soul.  Yes, he too mocks at me.  Now\nif you were both dead,\" she added with sudden venom, \"my lady\nwould not wish to go away.  Be careful lest a spell should fall\nupon you, Macumazahn,\" and without more words she turned and\nwent.\n\nAt first I was inclined to laugh; the whole thing seemed so\nabsurd.  On reflection, however, I perceived that in reality it\nwas very serious to people situated as we were.  This woman was a\nsavage; more, a mystic savage of considerable powers of mind--a\nformidable combination.  Also there were no restraints upon her,\nsince public opinion had as little authority in the Black Kloof\nas the Queen's Writ.  Lastly, it was not unknown for women to\nconceive these violent affections which, if thwarted, filled them\nwith something like madness.  Thus I remembered a very terrible\noccurrence of my youth which resulted in the death of one who was\nmost dear to me.  I will not dwell on it, but this, too, was the\nwork of a passionate creature, woman I can scarcely call her, who\nthought she was being robbed of one whom she adored.\n\nThe end of it was that I did not enjoy my pipe that night, though\nluckily Anscombe returned after a successful evening's netting,\nabout which he was so full of talk that there was no need for me\nto say much.  So I put off any discussion of the problem until\nthe morrow.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\n\n\nTHE KING VISITS ZIKALI\n\n\n\n\n\nNext morning, as a result of my cogitations, I went to see\nZikali.  I was admitted after a good deal of trouble and delay,\nfor although his retinue was limited and, with the exception of\nNombe, entirely male, this old prophet kept a kind of semi-state\nand was about as difficult to approach as a European monarch.  I\nfound him crouching over a fire in his hut, since at this season\nof the year even in that hot place the air was chilly until\nmidday.\n\n\"What is it, Macumazahn?\" he asked.  \"As to your going away, have\npatience.  I learn that he who was King of the Zulus is in full\nflight, with the white men tracking him like a wounded buck.\nWhen the buck is caught and killed, then you can go.\"\n\n\"It is about Nombe,\" I answered, and told him all the story,\nwhich did not seem to surprise him at all.\n\n\"Now see, Macumazahn,\" he said, taking some snuff, \"how hard it\nis to dam up the stream of nature.  This child, Nombe, is of my\nblood, one whom I saved from death in a strange way, not because\nshe was of my blood but that I might make an experiment with her.\nWomen, as you who are wise and have seen much will know, are in\ntruth superior to men, though, because they are weaker in body,\nmen have the upper hand of them and think themselves their\nmasters, a state they are forced to accept because they must live\nand cannot defend themselves.  Yet their brains are keener, as an\nassegai is keener than a hoe; they are more in touch with the\nhidden things that shape out fate for people and for nations;\nthey are more faithful and more patient, and by instinct if not\nby reason, more far-seeing, or at least the best of them are so,\nand by their best, like men, they should be judged.  Yet this is\nthe hole in their shield.  When they love they become the slaves\nof love, and for love's sake all else is brought to naught, and\nfor this reason they cannot be trusted.  With men, as you know,\nthis is otherwise.  They, too, love, by Nature's law, but always\nbehind there is something greater than love, although often they\ndo not understand what that may be.  To be powerful, therefore, a\nwoman must be one who does not love too much.  If she cannot love\nat all, then she is hated and has no power, but she must not love\ntoo much.\n\n\"Once I thought that I had found such a woman; she was named\nMameena, whom all men worshipped and who played with all men, as\nI played with her.  But what was the end of it?  Just as things\nwere going very well she learned to love too much some man of\nstrange notions, who would have thwarted me and brought\neverything to nothing, and therefore I had to kill her, for which\nI was sorry.\"\n\nHere he paused to take some more snuff, watching me over the\nspoon as he drew it up his great nostrils, but as I said nothing,\nwent on--\n\n\"Now after Mameena was dead I bethought me that I would rear up a\nwoman who could still love but should never love a man and\ntherefore never become mad or foolish, because I believed that it\nwas only man who in taking her heart from woman, would take her\nwits also.  This child, Nombe, came to my hand, and as I thought,\nso I did.  Never mind how I did it, by medicine perhaps, by magic\nperhaps, by watering her pride and making it grow tall perhaps,\nor by all three.  At least it was done, and this I know of Nombe,\nshe will never care for any man except as a woman may care for a\nbrother.\n\n\"But now see what happens.  She, the wise, the instructed, the\nman-despiser, meets a woman of another race who is sweet and\ngood, and learns to love her, not as maids and mothers love, but\nas one loves the Spirit that she worships.  Yes, yes, to her she\nis a goddess to be worshipped, one whom she desires to serve with\nall her heart and strength, to bow down before, making offerings,\nand at the end to follow into death.  So it comes about that this\nNombe, whose mind I thought to make as the wings of a bird\nfloating on the air while it searches for its prey, has become\neven madder than other women.  It is a disappointment to me,\nMacumazahn.\"\n\n\"It may be a disappointment to you, Zikali, and all that you say\nis very interesting.  But to us it is a danger.  Tell me, will\nyou command Nombe to cease from her folly?\"\n\n\"Will I forbid the mist to rise, or the wind to blow, or the\nlightning to strike?  As she is, she is.  Her heart is filled\nwith black jealousy of Mauriti and of you, as a butcher's gourd\nis filled with blood, for she is not one who desires that her\ngoddess should have other worshippers; she would keep her for\nherself alone.\"\n\n\"Then in this way or in that the gourd must be emptied, Zikali,\nlest we should be forced to drink from it and that black blood\nshould poison us.\"\n\n\"How, unless it be broken, Macumazahn?  If Heddana departs and\nleaves her, she will go mad, and accompany her she cannot, for\nher Spirit dwells here,\" and he tapped his own breast.  \"It would\npull her back again and she would become a great trouble to me,\nfor then that Spirit of hers would not suffer me to sleep, with\nits continual startings in search of what it had lost, and its\nreturnings empty-handed.  Well, have no fear, for at the worst\nthe bowl can be broken and the blood poured upon the earth, as I\nhave broken finer bowls than this before; had I all the bits of\nthem they would make a heap so high, Macumazahn!\" and he held out\nhis hand on a level with his head, a gesture that made my back\ncreep.  \"I will tell her this and it may keep her quiet for a\nwhile.  Of poison you need not be afraid, since unlike mine, her\nSpirit hates it.  Poison is not one of its weapons as it is with\nmine.  But of spells, beware, for her Spirit has some which are\nvery powerful.\"\n\nNow I jumped up, filled with indignation, saying--\n\n\"I do not believe in Nombe's spells, and in any case how am I to\nguard against them?\"\n\n\"If you do not believe there is no need to guard, and if you do\nbelieve, then it is for you to find out how to guard, Macumazahn.\nOh! I could tell you the story of a white teacher who did not\nbelieve and would not guard--but never mind, never mind.\nGood-bye, Macumazahn, I will speak with Nombe.  Ask her for a\nlock of her hair to wear upon your heart after she has enchanted\nit.  The charm is good against spells.  O-ho--Oho-o!  What fools\nwe are, white and black together!  That is what Cetewayo is\nthinking to-day.\"\n\nAfter this Nombe became much more agreeable.  That is to say she\nwas very polite, her smile was more fixed and her eyes more\nunfathomable than ever.  Evidently Zikali had spoken to her and\nshe had listened.  Yet to tell the truth my distrust of this\nhandsome young woman grew deeper day by day.  I recognized that\nthere was a great gulf between her and the normal, that she was a\ncreature fashioned by Zikali who had trained her as a gardener\ntrains a tree, nay, who had done more, who had grafted some\nforeign growth of exotic and unnatural spiritualism on to her\nprimitive nature.  The nature remained the same, but the graft or\ngrafts bore strange flowers and fruit, unholy flowers and\npoisonous fruit.  Therefore she was not to blame--sometimes I\nwonder whether in this curious world, could one see their past\nand their future, anybody is to blame for anything--but this did\nnot make her the less dangerous.\n\nSome talks I had with her only increased my apprehensions, for I\nfound that in a way she had no conscience.  Life, she told me,\nwas but a dream, and all its laws as evolved by man were but\nillusions.  The real life was elsewhere.  There was the distant\nlake on which the flower of our true existence floated.  Without\nthis unseen lake of supernatural water the flower could not\nfloat; indeed there would be no flower.  Moreover, the flower did\nnot matter; sometimes it would have this shape and colour,\nsometimes that.  It was but a thing destined to grow and bloom\nand rot, and during its day to be ugly or to be beautiful, to\nsmell sweet or ill, as it might chance, and ultimately to be\nabsorbed back into the general water of Life.\n\nI pointed out to her that all flowers had roots which grew in\nsoil.  Looking at an orchid-like plant that crept along the bough\nof a tree, she answered that this was not true as some grew upon\nair.  But however this might be, the soil, or the moisture in the\nair, was distilled from thousands of other flower lives that had\nflourished in their day and been forgotten.  It did not matter\nwhen they died or how many other flowers they choked that they\nmight live.  Yet each flower had its own spirit which always had\nbeen and always would be.\n\nI asked her of the end and the object of that spirit.  She\nanswered darkly that she did not know and if she did, would not\nsay, but that these were very dreadful.\n\nSuch were some of her vague and figurative assertions which I\nonly record to indicate their uncomfortable and indeed but half\nhuman nature.  I forgot to add that she declared that every\nflower or life had a twin flower or life, which in each\nsuccessive growth it was bound to find and bloom beside, or\nwither to the root and spring again and that ultimately these two\nwould become one, and as one flourish eternally.  Of all of which\nI understood and understand little, except that she had grasped\nthe elements of some truth which she could not express in clear\nand definite language.\n\n\nOne day I was seated in Zikali's hut whither by permission I had\ncome to ask the latest news, when suddenly Nombe appeared and\ncrouched down before him.\n\n\"Who gave you leave to enter here, and what is your business?\" he\nasked angrily.\n\n\"Home of Spirits,\" she replied in a humble voice, \"be not angry\nwith your servant.  Necessity gave me leave, and my business is\nto tell you that strangers approach.\"\n\n\"Who are they that dare to enter the Black Kloof unannounced?\"\n\n\"Cetewayo the King is one of them, the others I do not know, but\nthey are many, armed all of them.  They approach your gate;\nbefore a man can count two hundred they will be here.\"\n\n\"Where are the white chief and the lady Heddana?\" asked Zikali.\n\n\"By good fortune they have gone by the secret path to the\ntableland and will not be back till sunset.  They wished to be\nalone, so I did not accompany them, and Macumazahn here said that\nhe was too weary to do so.\"  (This was true.  Also like Nombe I\nthought that they wished to be alone.)\n\n\"Good.  Go, tell the king that I knew of his coming and am\nawaiting him.  Bid my servants kill the ox which is in the kraal,\nthe fat ox that they thought is sick and therefore fit food for a\nsick king,\" he added bitterly.\n\nShe glided away like a startled snake.  Then Zikali turned to me\nand said swiftly--\n\n\"Macumazahn, you are in great danger.  If you are found here you\nwill be killed, and so will the others whom I will send to warn\nnot to return till this king has gone away.  Go at once to join\nthem.  No, it is too late, I hear the Zulus come.  Take that\nkaross, cover yourself with it and lie among the baskets and\nbeerpots here near the entrance of the hut in the deepest of the\nshadows, so that if any enter, perchance you will not be found.\nI too am in danger who shall be held to account for all that has\nhappened.  Perhaps they will kill me, if I can be killed.  If so,\nget away with the others as best you can.  Nombe will tell you\nwhere your horses are hidden.  In that case let Heddana take\nNombe with her, for when I am dead she will go, and shake her off\nin Natal if she troubles her.  Whatever chances, remember,\nMacumazahn, that I have done my best to keep my word to you and\nto protect you and your friends.  Now I go to look on this\npricked bladder who was once a king.\"\n\nHe scrambled from the hut with slow, toad-like motions, while I\nwith motions that were anything but slow, grabbed the grey\ncatskin kaross and ensconced myself among the beerpots and mats\nin such a position that my head, over which I set a three-legged\ncarved stool of Zikali's own cutting, was but a few inches to the\nleft of the door-hole and therefore in the deepest of the\nshadows.  Thence by stretching out my neck a little, I could see\nthrough the hole, also hear all that passed outside.  Unless a\ndeliberate search of the hut should be made I was fairly safe\nfrom observation, even if it were entered by strangers.  One fear\nI had, however, it was lest the dog Lost should get into the\nplace and smell me out.  I had left him tied to the centre pole\nin my own hut, because he hated Zikali and always growled at him.\nBut suppose he gnawed through the cord, or any one let him loose!\n\nScarcely had Zikali seated himself in his accustomed place before\nthe hut, than the gate of the outer fence opened and approaching\nthrough it I saw forty or fifty fierce and way-worn men.  In\nfront of them, riding on a tired horse that was led by a servant,\nwas Cetewayo himself.  He was assisted to dismount, or rather\nthrew his great bulk into the arms that were waiting to receive\nhim.\n\nThen after some words with his following and with one of Zikali's\npeople, followed by three or four indunas and leaning on the arm\nof Umnyamana, the Prime Minister, he entered the enclosure, the\nrest remaining without.  Zikali, who sat as though asleep,\nsuddenly appeared to wake up and perceive him.  Struggling to his\nfeet he lifted his right arm and gave the royal salute of Bayete,\nand with it titles of praise, such as \"Black One!\" \"Elephant!\"\n\"Earth-Shaker!\" \"Conqueror!\" \"Eater-up of the White men!\" \"Child\nof the Wild Beast (Chaka) whose teeth are sharper than the Wild\nBeast's ever were!\" and so on, until Cetewayo, growing\nimpatient, cried out--\n\n\"Be silent, Wizard.  Is this a time for fine words?  Do you not\nknow my case that you offend my ears with them?  Give us food to\neat if you have it, after which I would speak with you alone.  Be\nswift also; here I may not stay for long, since the white dogs\nare at my heels.\"\n\n\"I knew that you were coming, O King, to honour my poor house\nwith a visit,\" said Zikali slowly, \"and therefore the ox is\nalready killed and the meat will soon be on the fire.  Meanwhile\ndrink a sup of beer, and rest.\"\n\nHe clapped his hands, whereon Nombe and some servants appeared\nwith pots of beer, of which, after Zikali had tasted it to show\nthat it was not poisoned, the king and his people drank\nthirstily.  Then it was taken to those outside.\n\n\"What is this that my ears hear?\" asked Zikali when Nombe and the\nothers had gone, \"that the White Dogs are on the spoor of the\nBlack Bull?\"\n\nCetewayo nodded heavily, and answered--\n\n\"My impis were broken to pieces on the plain of Ulundi; the\ncowards ran from the bullets as children run from bees.  My\nkraals are burnt and I, the King, with but a faithful remnant fly\nfor my life.  The prophecy of the Black One has come true.  The\npeople of the Zulus are stamped flat beneath the feet of the\ngreat White People.\"\n\n\"I remember that prophecy, O King.  Mopo told it to me within an\nhour of the death of the Black One when he gave me the little\nred-handled assegai that he snatched from the Black One's hand to\ndo the deed.  It makes me almost young again to think of it,\nalthough even then I was old,\" replied Zikali in a dreamy voice\nlike one who speaks to himself.\n\nHearing him from under my kaross I bethought me that he had\nreally grown old at last, who for the moment evidently forgot the\npart which this very assegai had played a few months before in\nthe Vale of Bones.  Well, even the greatest masters make such\nslips at times when their minds are full of other things.  But if\nZikali forgot, Cetewayo and his councillors remembered, as I\ncould see by the look of quick intelligence that flashed from\nface to face.\n\n\"So!  Mopo the murderer, he who vanished from the land after the\ndeath of my uncle Dingaan, gave you the little red assegai, did\nhe, Opener of Roads!  And but a few months ago that assegai,\nwhich old Sigananda knew again, thrown by the hand of the\nInkosazana-y-Zulu, drew blood from my body after the white man,\nMacumazahn, had severed its shaft with his bullet.  Now tell me,\nOpener of Roads, how did it pass from your keeping into that of\nthe spirit Nomkubulwana?\"\n\nAt this question I distinctly saw a shiver shake the frame of\nZikali who realized too late the terrible mistake he had made.\nYet as only the great can do, he retrieved and even triumphed\nover his error.\n\n\"Oho-ho!\" he laughed, \"who am I that I can tell how such things\nhappen?  Do you not know, O King, that the Spirits leave what\nthey will and take what they will, whether it be but a blade of\ngrass, or the life of a man\"--here he looked at Cetewayo--\"or\neven of a people?  Sometimes they take the shadow and sometimes\nthe substance, since spirit or matter, all is theirs.  As for the\nlittle assegai, I lost it years ago.  I remember that the last\ntime I saw it was in the hands of a woman named Mameena to whom I\nshowed it as a strange and bloody thing.  After her death I found\nthat it was gone, so doubtless she took it with her to the\nUnder-world and there gave it to the Queen Nomkubulwana, with\nwhom you may remember this Mameena returned from that Under-world\nyonder in the Bones.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" said Cetewayo sullenly, \"yet it was no spirit\niron that cut my thigh, but what do I know of the ways of\nSpirits?  Wizard, I would speak with you in your hut alone where\nno ear can hear us.\"\n\n\"My hut is the King's,\" answered Zikali, \"yet let the King\nremember that those Spirits of which he does not know the ways,\ncan always hear, yes, even the thoughts of men, and on them do\njudgment.\"\n\n\"Fear not,\" said Cetewayo, \"amongst many other things I remember\nthis also.\"\n\nThen Zikali turned and crept into the hut, whispering as he\npassed me--\n\n\"Lie silent for your life.\"  And Cetewayo having bidden his\nretinue to depart outside the fence and await him there, followed\nafter him.\n\nThey sat them down on either side of the smouldering fire and\nstared at each other through the thin smoke there in the gloom of\nthe hut.  By turning my head that the foot of the king had\nbrushed as he passed, I could watch them both.  Cetewayo spoke\nthe first in a hoarse, slow voice, saying--\n\n\"Wizard, I am in danger of my life and I have come to you who\nknow all the secrets of this land, that you may tell me in what\nplace I may hide where the white men cannot find me.  It must be\ntold into my ear alone, since I dare not trust the matter to any\nother, at any rate until I must.  They are traitors every man of\nthem, yes, even those who seem to be most faithful.  The fallen\nman has no friends, least of all if he chances to be a king.\nOnly the dead will keep his counsel.  Tell me of the place I\nneed.\"\n\n\"Dingaan, who was before you, once asked this same thing of me, O\nKing, when he was flying from Panda your father, and the Boers.\nI gave him advice that he did not take, but sought a refuge of\nhis own upon a certain Ghost-mountain.  What happened to him\nthere that Mopo, of whom you spoke a while ago, can tell you if\nhe still lives.\"*\n\n[*--See _Nada the Lily._--EDITOR.]\n\n\"Surely you are an ill-omened night-bird who thus croak to me\ncontinually of the death of kings,\" broke in Cetewayo with\nsuppressed rage.  Then calming himself with an effort added,\n\"Tell me now, where shall I hide?\"\n\n\"Would you know, King?  Then hearken.  On the south slope of the\nIngome Range west of the Ibululwana River, on the outskirts of\nthe great forest, there is a kloof whereof the entrance, which\nonly one man can pass at a time, is covered by a thicket of\nthorns and marked by a black rock shaped like a great toad with\nan open mouth, or, as some say, like myself,\n'The-Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born.'  Near to this rock\ndwells an old woman, blind of one eye and lacking a hand, which\nthe Black One cut off shortly before his death, because when he\nkilled her father, she saw the future and prophesied a like death\nto him, although then she was but a child.  This woman is of our\ncompany, being a witch-doctoress.  I will send a Spirit to her,\nif you so will it, to warn her to watch for you and your company,\nO King, and show you the mouth of the kloof, where are some old\nhuts and water.  There you will never be found unless you are\nbetrayed.\"\n\n\"Who can betray me when none know whither I am going?\" asked\nCetewayo.  \"Send the Spirit, send it at once, that this one-armed\nwitch may make ready.\"\n\n\"What is the hurry, King, seeing that the forest is far away?\nYet be it as you will.  Keep silence now, lest evil should befall\nyou.\"\n\nThen of a sudden Zikali seemed to go off into one of his trances.\nHis form grew rigid, his eyes closed, his face became fixed as\nthough in death, and foam appeared upon his lips.  He was a\ndreadful sight to look on, there in the gloomy hut.\n\nCetewayo watched him and shivered.  Then he opened his blanket\nand I perceived that fastened about him by a loop of hide in such\na fashion that it could be drawn out in a moment, was the blade\nof a broad assegai, the shaft of which was shortened to about six\ninches.  His hand grasped this shaft, and I understood that he\nwas contemplating the murder of Zikali.  Then it seemed to me\nthat he changed his mind and that his lips shaped the words--\"Not\nyet,\" though whether he really spoke them I do not know.  At\nleast he withdrew his hand and closed the blanket.\n\nSlowly Zikali opened his eyes, staring at the roof of the hut,\nwhence came a curious sound as of squeaking bats.  He looked like\na dead man coming to life again.  For a few moments he turned up\nhis ear as though he listened to the squealing, then said--\n\n\"It is well.  The Spirit that I summoned has visited her of our\ncompany who is named One-hand and returned with the answer.  Did\nyou not hear it speaking in the thatch, O King?\"\n\n\"I heard something, Wizard,\" answered Cetewayo in an awed voice.\n\"I thought it was a bat.\"\n\n\"A bat it is, O King, one with wide wings and swift.  This bat\nsays that my sister, One-hand, will meet you on the third day\nfrom now at this hour on the further side of the ford of the\nIbululwana, where three milk-trees grow together on a knoll.  She\nwill be sitting under the centre milk-tree and will wait for two\nhours, no more, to show you the secret entrance to the kloof.\"\n\n\"The road is rough and long, I shall have to hurry when worn out\nwith travelling,\" said Cetewayo.\n\n\"That is so, O King.  Therefore my counsel is that you begin the\njourney as soon as possible, especially as I seem to hear the\nbaying of the white dogs not far away.\"\n\n\"By Chaka's head! I will not,\" growled Cetewayo, \"who thought to\nsleep here in peace this night.\"\n\n\"As the King wills.  All that I have is the King's.  Only then\nOne-hand will not be waiting and some other place of hiding must\nbe found, since this is known to me only and to her; also that\nSpirit which I sent will make no second journey, nor can I travel\nto show it to the King.\"\n\n\"Yes, Wizard, it is known to you and to myself.  Methinks it\nwould be better were it known to me alone.  I have a spoonful of\nsnuff to share (i.e., a bone to pick) with you, Wizard.  It would\nseem that you set my feet and those of the Zulu people upon a\nfalse road, yonder in the Vale of Bones, causing me to declare\nwar upon the white men and thereby bringing us all to ruin.\"\n\n\"Mayhap my memory grows bad, O King, for I do not remember that I\ndid these things.  I remember that the spirit of a certain\nMameena whom I called up from the dead, prophesied victory to the\nKing, which victory has been his.  Also it prophesied other\nvictories to the King in a far land across the water, which\nvictories doubtless shall be his in due season; for myself I gave\nno 'counsel to the King or to his indunas and generals.'\"\n\n\"You lie, Wizard,\" exclaimed Cetewayo hoarsely.  \"Did you not\nsummon the shape of the Princess of Heaven to be the sign of war,\nand did she not hold in her hand that assegai of the Black One\nwhich you have told me was in your keeping?  How did it pass from\nyour keeping into the hand of a spirit?\"\n\n\"As to that matter I have spoken, O King.  For the rest, is\nNomkubulwana my servant to come and go at my bidding?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" said Cetewayo coldly.  \"I think also that you who\nknow the place where I purpose to hide, would do well to forget\nit.  Surely you have lived too long, O Opener of Roads, and done\nenough evil to the House of Senzangacona, which you ever hated.\"\n\nSo he spoke, and once more I saw his hand steal towards the\nspearhead which was hidden beneath the blanket that he wore.\n\nZikali saw it also and laughed.  \"Oho!\" he laughed, \"forgetting\nall my warnings, and that the day of my death will be his own,\nthe King thinks to kill me because I am old and feeble and alone\nand unarmed.  He thinks to kill me as the Black One thought, as\nDingaan thought, as even Panda thought, yet I live on to this\nday.  Well, I bear no malice since it is natural that the King\nshould wish to kill one who knows the secret of where he would\nhide himself for his own life's sake.  That spearhead which the\nKing is fingering is sharp, so sharp that my bare breast cannot\nturn its edge.  I must find me a shield!  I must find me a\nshield!  Fire, you are not yet dead.  Awake, make smoke to be my\nshield!\" and he waved his long, monkey-like arms over the embers,\nfrom which instantly there sprang up a reek of thin white smoke\nthat appeared to take a vague and indefinite shape which\nsuggested the shadow of a man; for to me it seemed a nebulous and\nwavering shadow, no more.\n\n\"What are you staring at, O King?\" went on Zikali in a fierce and\nthrilling voice.  \"Who is it that you see?  Who has the fire sent\nto be my shield?  Ghosts are so thick here that I do not know.  I\ncannot tell one of them from the other.  Who is it?  Who, who of\nall that you have slain and who therefore are your foes?\"\n\n\"Umbelazi, my brother,\" groaned Cetewayo.  \"My brother Umbelazi\nstands before me with spear raised; he whom I brought to his\ndeath at the battle of the Tugela.  His eyes flame upon me, his\nspear is raised to strike.  He speaks words I cannot understand.\nProtect me, O Wizard!  Lord of Spirits, protect me from the\nspirit of Umbelazi.\"\n\nZikali laughed wildly and continued to wave his arms above the\nfire from which smoke poured ever more densely, till the hut was\nfull of it.\n\nWhen it cleared away again Cetewayo was gone!\n\n\"Saw you ever the like of that?\" said Zikali, addressing the\nkaross under which I was sweltering.  \"Tell me, Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, thrusting out my head as a tortoise does,\n\"when in this very hut you seemed to produce the shape, also out\nof smoke, I think, of one whom I used to know.  Say, how do you\ndo it, Zikali?\"\n\n\"Do it.  Who knows?  Perchance I do nothing.  Perchance I think\nand you fools see, no more.  Or perchance the spirits of the dead\nwho are so near to us, come at my call and take themselves bodies\nout of the charmed smoke of my fire.  You white men are wise,\nanswer your own question, Macumazahn.  At least that smoke or\nthat ghost saved me from a spear thrust in the heart, wherewith\nCetewayo was minded to pay me for showing him a hiding-place\nwhich he desired should be secret to himself alone.  Well, well,\nI can pay as well as Cetewayo and my count is longer.  Now lie\nyou still, Macumazahn, for I go out to watch.  He will not bide\nlong in this place which he deems haunted and ill-omened.  He\nwill be gone ere sunset, that is within an hour, and sleep\nelsewhere.\"\n\nThen he crept from the hut and presently, though I could see\nnothing, for now the gate of the fence was shut, I heard voices\ndebating and finally that of Cetewayo say angrily--\n\n\"Have done!  It is my will.  You can eat your food outside of\nthis place which is bewitched; the girl will show us where are\nthe huts of which the wizard speaks.\"\n\nA few minutes later Zikali crept back into the hut, laughing to\nhimself.\n\n\"All is safe,\" he said, \"and you can come out of your hole, old\njackal.  He who calls himself a king is gone, taking with him\nthose whom he thinks faithful, most of whom are but waiting a\nchance to betray him.  What did I say, a king?  Nay, in all\nAfrica there is no slave so humble or so wretched as this broken\nman.  Oh! feather by feather I have plucked my fowl and by and by\nI shall cut his throat.  You will be there, Macumazahn, you will\nbe there.\"\n\n\"I trust not,\" I answered as I mopped my brow.  \"We have been\nnear enough to throat-cutting this afternoon to last me a long\nwhile.  Where has the king gone?\"\n\n\"Not far, Macumazahn.  I have sent Nombe to guide him to the huts\nin the little dip five spear throws to the right of the mouth of\nthe kloof where live the old herdsman and his people who guard my\ncattle.  He and all the rest are away with the cattle that are\nhidden in the Ceza Forest out of reach of the white men, so the\nhuts are empty.  Oh! now I read what you are thinking.  I do not\nmean that he should be taken there.  It is too near my house and\nthe king still has friends.\"\n\n\"Why did you send Nombe?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because he would have no other guide, who does not trust my men.\nHe means to keep her with him for some days and then let her go,\nand thus she will be out of mischief.  Meanwhile you and your\nfriends can depart untroubled by her fancies, and join the white\nmen who are near.  Tomorrow you shall start.\"\n\n\"That is good,\" I said with a sigh of relief.  Then an idea\nstruck me and I added, \"I suppose no harm will come to Nombe, who\nmight be thought to know too much?\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" he replied indifferently, \"but that is a matter for\nher Spirit to decide.  Now go, Macumazahn, for I am weary.\"\n\nI also was weary after my prolonged seclusion under that very hot\nskin rug.  For be it remembered I was not yet strong again, and\nalthough this was not the real reason why I had stopped behind\nwhen the others went to the plateau, I still grew easily tired.\nMy real reason was that of Nombe--that I thought they preferred\nto be alone.  I looked about me and saw with relief that Cetewayo\nand every man of his retinue were really gone.  They had not even\nwaited to eat the ox that had been killed for them, but had\ncarried off the meat with other provisions to their\nsleeping-place outside the kloof.  Having made sure of this I\nwent to my hut and loosed Lost that fortunately enough had been\nunable to gnaw through the thick buffalo-hide riem with which I\nhad fastened him to the pole.\n\nHe greeted me with rapture as though we had been parted for\nyears.  Had he belonged to Ulysses himself he could not have been\nmore joyful.  When one is despondent and lonesome, how grateful\nis the whole-hearted welcome of a dog which, we are sometimes\ntempted to think, is the only creature that really cares for us\nin the world.  Every other living thing has side interests of its\nown, but that of a dog is centred in its master, though it is\ntrue that it also dreams affectionately of dinner and rabbits.\n\nThen with Lost at my feet I sat outside the hut smoking and\nwaiting for the return of Anscombe and Heda.  Presently I caught\nsight of them in the gloaming.  Their arms were around one\nanother, and in some remarkable way they had managed to dispose\ntheir heads, forgetting that the sky was still light behind them,\nin such fashion that it was difficult to tell one from the other.\nI reflected that it was a good thing that at last we were\nescaping from this confounded kloof and country for one where\nthey could marry and make an end, and became afflicted with a\nsneezing fit.\n\nHeda asked where Nombe was and why supper was not ready, for\nNombe played the part of cook and parlourmaid combined.  I told\nher something of what had happened, whereon Heda, who did not\nappreciate its importance in the least, remarked that she, Nombe,\nmight as well have put on the pot before she went and done sundry\nother things which I forget.  Ultimately we got something to eat\nand turned in, Heda grumbling a little because she must sleep\nalone, for she had grown used to the company of the ever-watchful\nNombe, who made her bed across the door-hole of the hut.\n\nAnscombe was soon lost in dreams, if he did dream, but I could\nnot sleep well that night.  I was fearful of I knew not what, and\nso, I think, was Lost, for he fidgeted and kept poking me with\nhis nose.  At last, I think it must have been about two hours\nafter midnight, he began to growl.  I could hear nothing,\nalthough my ears are sharp, but as he went on growling I crept to\nthe door-hole and drew aside the board.  Lost slipped out and\nvanished, while I waited, listening.  Presently I thought I heard\na soft foot-fall and a whisper, also that I saw the shape of a\nwoman which reminded me of Nombe, shown faintly by the starlight.\nIt vanished in a moment and Lost returned wagging his tail, as he\nmight well have done if it were Nombe who was attached to the\ndog.  As nothing further happened I went back to bed, reflecting\nthat I was probably mistaken, since Nombe had been sent away for\nsome days by Zikali and would scarcely dare to return at once,\neven if she could do so.\n\nShortly before daylight Lost began to growl again in a subdued\nand thunderous fashion.  This time I got up and dressed myself\nmore or less.  Then I went out.  The dawn was just breaking and\nby its light I saw a strange scene.  About fifty yards away in\nthe narrow nek that ran over some boulders to the site of our\nhuts, stood what seemed to be the goddess Nomkubulwana as I had\nseen her on the point of rock in the Vale of Bones.  She wore the\nsame radiant dress and in the dim glow had all the appearance of\na white woman.  I stood amazed, thinking that I dreamt, when from\nround the bend emerged a number of Zulus, creeping forward\nstealthily with raised spears.\n\nThey caught sight of the supernatural figure which barred their\nroad, halted and whispered to each other.  Then they turned to\nfly, but before they went one of them, as it seemed to me through\nsheer terror, hurled his assegai at the figure which remained\nstill and unmoved.\n\nIn thirty seconds they were gone; in sixty their footsteps had\ndied away.  Then the figure wheeled slowly round and by the\nstrengthening light I perceived that a spear transfixed its\nbreast.\n\nAs it sank to the ground I ran up to it.  It was Nombe with her\nface and arms whitened and her life-blood running down the\nglittering feather robe.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\n\n\nTHE MADNESS OF NOMBE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dog reached Nombe first and began to lick her face, its\ntongue removing patches of the white which had not had time to\ndry.  She was lying, her back supported by one of the boulders.\nWith her left hand she patted the dog's head feebly and with her\nright drew out the assegai from her body, letting it fall upon\nthe ground.  Recognizing me she smiled in her usual mysterious\nfashion and said--\n\n\"All is well, Macumazahn, all is very well.  I have deserved to\ndie and I do not die in vain.\"\n\n\"Don't talk, let me see your wound,\" I exclaimed.\n\nShe opened her robe and pointed; it was quite a small gash\nbeneath the breast from which blood ebbed slowly.\n\n\"Let it be, Macumazahn,\" she said.  \"I am bleeding inside and it\nis mortal.  But I shall not die yet.  Listen to me while I have\nmy mind.  Yesterday when Mauriti and Heddana went up to the plain\nI wished to go with them because I had news that Zulus were\nwandering everywhere and thought that I might be able to protect\nmy mistress from danger.  Mauriti spoke to me roughly, telling me\nthat I was not wanted.  Of that I thought little, for to such\nwords I am accustomed from him; moreover, they are to be forgiven\nto a man in love.  But it did not end there, for my lady Heddana\nalso pierced me with her tongue, which hurt more than this spear\nthrust does, Macumazahn, for I could see that her speech had been\nprepared and that she took this chance to throw it at me.  She\nsaid that I did not know where I should sit; that I was a thorn\nbeneath her nail, and that whenever she wished to talk with\nMauriti, or with you, Macumazahn, I was ever there with my ear\nopen like the mouth of a gourd.  She commanded me in future to\ncome only when I was called; all of which things I am sure\nMauriti had taught her, who in herself is too gentle even to\nthink them--unless you taught her, Macumazahn.\"\n\nI shook my head and she went on--\n\n\"No, it was not you who also are too gentle, and having suffered\nyourself, can feel for those who suffer, which Mauriti who has\nnever suffered cannot do.  Still, you too thought me a trouble,\none that sticks in the flesh like a hooked thorn, or a tick from\nthe grass, and cannot be unfastened.  You spoke to the Master\nabout it and he spoke to me.\"\n\nThis time I nodded in assent.\n\n\"I do not blame you, Macumazahn; indeed now I see that you were\nwise, for what right has a poor black doctoress to seek the love,\nor even to look upon the face of the great white lady whom for a\nlittle while Fate has caused to walk upon the same path with her?\nBut yesterday I forgot that, Macumazahn, for you see we are all\nof us, not one self, but many selves, and each self has its times\nof rule.  Nombe alive and well was one woman, Nombe dying is\nanother, and doubtless Nombe dead will be a third, unless, as she\nprays, she should sleep for ever.\n\n\"Macumazahn, those words of Heddana's were to me what gall is to\nsweet milk.  My blood clotted and my heart turned sour.  It was\nnot against her that I was angry, because that can never happen,\nbut against Mauriti and against you.  My Spirit whispered in my\near.  It said, 'If Mauriti and Macumazahn were dead the lady\nHeddana would be left alone in a strange land.  Then she would\nlearn to rest upon you as upon a stick, and learn to love the\nstick on which she rested, though it be so rough and homely.'\nBut how can I kill them, I asked of my Spirit, and myself escape\ndeath?\n\n\"'Poison is forbidden to you by the pact between us,' answered my\nSpirit, 'yet I will show you a way, who am bound to serve you in\nall things good or ill.'\n\n\"Then we nodded to each other in my breast, Macumazahn, and I\nwaited for what should happen who knew that my Spirit would not\nlie.  Yes, I waited for a chance to kill you both, forgetting, as\nthe wicked forget in their madness, that even if I were not found\nout, soon or late Heddana would guess the truth and then, even if\nshe had learned to love me a thousand times more than she ever\ncould, would come to hate me as a mother hates a snake that has\nslain her child.  Or even if she never learned or guessed in\nlife, after death she would learn and hunt me and spit on me from\nworld to world as a traitoress and a murderer, one who has sinned\npast pardon.\"\n\nHere she seemed to grow faint and I turned to seek for help.  But\nshe caught hold of my coat and said--\n\n\"Hear me out, Macumazahn, or I will run after you till I fall and\ndie.\"\n\nSo thinking it best, I stayed and she went on--\n\n\"My Spirit, which must be an evil one since Zikali gave it me\nwhen I was made a doctoress, dealt truly with me, for presently\nthe king and his people came.  Moreover, my Spirit brought it\nabout that the king would have no other guide but me to lead him\nto the kraal where he slept last night, and I went as though\nunwillingly.  At the kraal the king sent for me and questioned me\nin a dark hut, pretending to be alone, but I who am a doctoress\nknew that two other men were in that hut, taking note of all my\nwords.  He asked me of the Inkosazana-y-Zulu who appeared in the\nVale of Bones and of the little assegai she held in her hand, and\nof the magic of the Opener of Roads, and many other things.  I\nsaid that I knew nothing of the Inkosazana, but that without\ndoubt my Master was a great magician.  He did not believe me.  He\nthreatened that I should be tortured very horribly and was about\nto call his servants to torment me till I told the truth.  Then\nmy Spirit spoke in my heart saying, 'Now the door is open to you,\nas I promised.  Tell the king of the two white men whom the\nMaster hides, and he will send to kill them, leaving the lady\nHeddana and you alone together.'  So I pretended to be afraid and\ntold him, whereon he laughed and answered--\n\n\"'For your sake I am glad, girl, that you have spoken the truth;\nbesides it is useless to torture a witch, since then the spirit\nin her only vomits lies.'\n\n\"Next he called aloud and a man came, who it was I could not see\nin the dark.  The king commanded him to take me to one of the\nother huts and tie me up there to the roof-pole.  The man obeyed,\nbut he did not tie me up; he only blocked the hut with the\ndoor-board, and sat with me there in the dark alone.\n\n\"Now I grew cunning and began to talk with him, spreading a net\nof sweet words, as the fowler spreads a net for cranes from which\nhe would tear the crests.  Soon by his talk I found out that the\nking and his people knew more than I guessed.  Macumazahn, they\nhad seen the cart which still stands under the overhanging rock\nby the mouth of the cave.  I asked him if that were all,\npretending that the cart belonged to my Master, to whom it had\nbeen brought from the field of Isandhlwana, that he might be\ndrawn about in it, who was too weak to walk.\n\n\"The man said that if I would kiss him he would tell me\neverything.  I bade him tell me first, swearing that then I would\nkiss him.  Yes, Macumazahn, I, whom no man's lips have ever\ntouched, fell as low as this.  So he grew foolish and told me.\nHe told me that they had also seen a kappje such as white women\nwear, hanging on the hut fence, and I remembered that after\nwashing the headdress of my mistress I had set it there to dry in\nthe sun.  He told me also that the King suspected that she who\nwore that kappje was she who had played the part of the\nInkosazana in the Vale of Bones.  I asked him what the king would\ndo about the matter, at the same time denying that there was any\nwhite woman in the Black Kloof.  He said that at dawn the king\nwould send and kill these foreign rats, whom the Opener of Roads\nkept in the thatch of his hut.  Now he drew near and asked his\npay.  I gave it to him--with a knife-point, Macumazahn.  Oh! that\nwas a good thrust.  He never spoke again.  Then I slipped away,\nfor all the others were asleep, and was here a little after\nmidnight.\"\n\n\"I thought I saw you, Nombe,\" I said, \"but was not sure, so I did\nnothing.\"\n\nShe smiled and answered--\n\n\"Ah! I was afraid that the Watcher-by-Night would be watching by\nnight; also the dog ran up to me, but he knew me and I sent him\nback again.  Now while I was coming home, thoughts entered my\nheart.  I saw, as one sees by a lightning flash, all that I had\ndone.  The king and his people were not sure that the Master was\nhiding white folk here and would never have sent back to kill\nthem on the chance.  I had made them sure, as indeed, being mad,\nI meant to do.  Moreover, in throwing spears at the kites I had\nkilled my own dove, since it was on the false Inkosazana who had\ncaused them to declare war and brought the land to ruin, that\nthey wished to be avenged, and perchance on him who taught her\nher part, not on one or two wandering white men.  I saw that when\nCetewayo's people came, and there were many more of them outside,\nseveral hundreds I think, they would shave the whole head and\nburn the whole tree.  Every one in the kloof would be killed.\n\n\"How could I undo the knot that I had tied and stamp out the fire\nthat I had lit?  That was the question.  I bethought me of coming\nto you, but without arms how could you help?  I bethought me of\ngoing to the Master, but I was ashamed.  Also, what could he do\nwith but a few servants, for the most of his people are away with\nthe cattle?  He is too weak to climb the steep path to the plain\nabove, nor was there time to gather folk to carry him.  Lastly,\neven if there were time which there was not, and we went thither\nthey would track us out and kill us.  For the rest I did not\ncare, nor for myself, but that the lady Heddana should be\nbutchered who was more to me than a hundred lives, and through my\ntreachery--ah! for that I cared.\n\n\"I called on my Spirit to help me, but it would not come.  My\nSpirit was dead in me because now I would do good and not ill.\nYet another Spirit came, that of one Mameena whom once you knew.\nShe came angrily, like a storm, and I shrank before her.  She\nsaid, 'Vile witch, you have plotted to murder Macumazahn, and for\nthat you shall answer to me before another sun has set over this\nearth of yours.  Now you seek a way of escape from your own\nwickedness.  Well, it can be had, but at a price.'\n\n\"'What price, O Lady of Death?' I asked.\n\n\"'The price of your own life, Witch.'\n\n\"I laughed into that ghost face of hers and said--\n\n\"'Is this all?  Be swift and show me the way, O Lady of Death,\nand afterwards we will balance our account.'\n\n\"Then she whispered into the ear of my heart and was gone.  I ran\non, for the dawn was near.  I whitened myself with lime, I put on\nthe glittering cloak and powdered my hair with the sparkling\nearth.  I took a little stick in my hand since I could find no\nspear and had no time to search, and just as day began to break,\nI crept out and stood in the bend of the path.  The slayers came,\ntwelve or so of them, but behind were many more.  They saw the\nInkosazana-y-Zulu barring their way and were much afraid.  They\nfled, but out of his fright one of them threw a spear which went\nhome, as I knew it would.  He watched to see if I should fall,\nbut I would not fall.  Then he fled faster than the rest, knowing\nhimself accursed who had lifted steel against the Queen of\nHeaven, and oh! I am glad, I am glad!\"\n\nShe ceased, exhausted, yet with a great exultation in her\nbeautiful eyes; indeed at that moment she looked a most\ntriumphant creature.  I stared at her, thrilled through and\nthrough.  She had been wicked, no doubt, but how splendid was her\nend; and, thank Heaven! she was troubled with no thought of what\nmight befall her after that end, although I was sure she believed\nthat she would live again to face Mameena.\n\nI knew not what to do.  I did not like to leave her, especially\nas no earthly power could help her case, since slowly but quite\nsurely she was bleeding to death from an internal wound.  By now\nthe sun was up and Zikali's people were about.  One of them\nappeared suddenly and saw, then with a howl of terror turned to\nfly away.\n\n\"Fool!  Fool!\" I cried, \"go summon the lady Heddana and the\nInkosi Mauriti.  Bid them come swiftly if they would see the\ndoctoress Nombe before she dies.\"\n\nThe man leapt off like a buck, and within a few minutes I saw\nHeda and Anscombe running towards us, half dressed, and went to\nmeet them.\n\n\"What is it?\" she gasped.\n\n\"I have only time to tell you this,\" I answered.  \"Nombe is\ndying.  She gave her life to save you, how I will explain\nafterwards.  The assegai that pierced her was meant for your\nheart.  Go, thank her, and bid her farewell.  Anscombe, stop back\nwith me.\"\n\nWe stood still and watched from a little distance.  Heda knelt\ndown and put her arms about Nombe.  They whispered together into\neach other's ears.  Then they kissed.\n\nIt was at this moment that Zikali appeared, leaning on two of his\nservants.  By some occult art or instinct he seemed to know all\nthat had happened, and oh! he looked terrible.  He crouched down\nin front of the dying woman and, toadlike, spat his venom at her.\n\n\"You lost your Spirit, did you?\" he said.  \"Well, it came back to\nme laden with the black honey of your treachery, to me, its home,\nas a bee comes to its hive.  It has told me everything, and well\nfor you, Witch, it is that you are dying.  But think not that you\nshall escape me there in the world below, for thither I will\nfollow you.  Curses on you, traitress, who would have betrayed me\nand brought all my plans to naught.  Ow! in a day to come I will\npay you back a full harvest for this seed of shame that you have\nsown.\"\n\nShe opened her eyes and looked at him, then answered quite\nsoftly--\n\n\"I think your chain is broken, O Zikali, no more my master.  I\nthink that love has cut your chain in two and I fear you never\nmore.  Keep the spirit you lent to me; it is yours, but the rest\nof me is my own, and in the house of my heart another comes to\ndwell.\"\n\nThen once more she stretched out her arms towards Heda and\nmurmuring, \"Sister, forget me not, Sister, who will await you for\na thousand years,\" she passed away.\n\n\nIt was a good ending to a bad business, and I confess I felt glad\nwhen it was finished.  Only afterwards I regretted very much that\nI had not found an opportunity to ask her whether or no she had\nmasqueraded as Mameena in the Valley of Bones.  Now it is too\nlate.\n\n\nWe buried poor Nombe decently in her own little hut where she\nused to practise her incantations.  Zikali and his people wished\napparently to throw her to the vultures for some secret reason\nthat had to do with their superstitions.  But Heda, who, now that\nNombe was dead, developed a great affection for her not unmixed\nwith a certain amount of compunction for which really she had no\ncause, withstood him to his face and insisted upon a decent\ninterment.  So she was laid to earth still plastered with the\nwhite pigment and wrapped in the bloodstained feather robe.  I\nmay add that on the following morning one of Zikali's servants\ninformed me solemnly that because of this she had been seen\nduring the night riding up and down the rocks on a baboon as Zulu\numtagati are supposed to do.  I have small doubt that as soon as\nwe were gone they dug her up again and threw her to the vultures\nand the jackals according to their first intention.\n\nOn this day we at length escaped from the Black Kloof, and in our\nown cart, for during the night our horses arrived mysteriously\nfrom somewhere, in good condition though rather wild.  I went to\nsay good-bye to Zikali, who said little, except that we should\nmeet once more after many moons.  Anscombe and Heda he would not\nsee at all, but only sent them a message, to the effect that he\nhoped they would think kindly of him through the long years to\ncome, since he had kept his promise and preserved them safe\nthrough many dangers.  I might have answered that he had first of\nall put them into the dangers, but considered it wise to hold my\ntongue.  I think, however, that he guessed my thought, if one can\ntalk of guessing in connection with Zikali, for he said that they\nhad no reason to thank him, since if he had served their turn\nthey had served his, adding--\n\n\"It will be strange in the times to be for the lady Heddana to\nremember that it was she and no other who crumpled up the Zulus\nlike a frostbitten winter reed, since had she not appeared upon\nthe rock in the Valley of Bones, there would have been no war.\"\n\n\"She did not do this, you did it, Zikali,\" I said, \"making her\nyour tool through love and fear.\"\n\n\"Nay, Macumazahn, I did not do it; it was done by what you call\nGod and I call Fate in whose hand I am the tool.  Well, say to\nthe lady Heddana that in payment I will hold back the ghost of\nNombe from haunting her, if I can.  Say also that if I had not\nbrought her and her lover to Zululand they would have been\nkilled.\"\n\n\nSo we went from that hateful kloof which I have never seen since\nand hope I shall never see again, two of Zikali's men escorting\nus until we got into touch with white people.  To these we said\nas little as possible.  I think they believed that we were only\npremature tourists who had made a dash into Zululand to visit\nsome of the battlefields.  Indeed none of us ever reported our\nstrange adventures, and after my experience with Kaatje we were\nparticularly careful to say nothing in the hearing of any\ngentleman connected with the Press.  But as a matter of fact\nthere were so many people moving about and such a continual\ncoming and going of soldiers and their belongings, that after we\nhad managed to buy some decent clothes, which we did at the\nlittle town of Newcastle, nobody paid any attention to us.\n\nOn our way to Maritzburg one amusing thing did happen.  We met\nKaatje!  It was about sunset that we were driving up a steep hill\nnot far from Howick.  At least I was driving, but Anscombe and\nHeda were walking about a hundred yards ahead of the cart, when\nsuddenly Kaatje appeared over a rise and came face to face with\nthem while taking an evening stroll, or as I concluded\nafterwards, making some journey.  She saw, she stared, she\nuttered one wild yell, and suddenly bundled over the edge of the\nroad.  Never would I have believed that such a fat woman could\nhave run so fast.  In a minute she was down the slope and had\nvanished into a dense kloof where, as night was closing in and we\nwere very tired, it was impossible for us to follow her.  Nor did\nsubsequent inquiry in Howick tell us where she was living or\nwhence she came, for some months before she had left the place\nshe had taken there as a cook.\n\nSuch was the end of Kaatje so far as we were concerned.\nDoubtless to her dying day she remained, or will remain, a firm\nbeliever in ghosts.\n\nAnscombe and Heda were married at Maritzburg as soon as the\nnecessary formalities had been completed.  I could not attend the\nceremony, which was a disappointment to me and I hope to them,\nbut unfortunately I had a return of my illness and was laid up\nfor a week.  Perhaps this was owing to the hot sun that struck me\non the neck one afternoon coming down the Town Hill where I was\nobliged to hang on to the rear of the cart because the brakes had\ngiven out.  However I was able to send Heda a wedding gift in the\nshape of her jewels and money that I recovered from the bank,\nwhich she had never expected to see again; also to arrange\neverything about her property.\n\nThey went down to Durban for their honeymoon and, some convenient\nopportunity arising, sailed thence for England.  I received an\naffectionate letter from them both, which I still treasure,\nthanking me very much for all I had done for them, that after all\nwas little enough.  Also Anscombe enclosed a blank cheque,\nbegging me to fill it in for whatever sum I considered he was\nindebted to me on the balance of account.  I thought this very\nkind of him and a great mark of confidence, but the cheque\nremained blank.\n\nI never saw either of them again, and though I believe that they\nare both living, for the most part abroad--in Hungary I think--I\ndo not suppose that I ever shall.  When I came to England some\nyears later after King Solomon's mines had made me rich, I wrote\nAnscombe a letter.  He never answered it, which hurt me at the\ntime.  Afterwards I remembered that in their fine position it was\nvery natural that they should not wish to renew acquaintance with\nan individual who had so intimate a knowledge of certain\nincidents that they probably regarded as hateful, such as the\ndeaths of Marnham and Dr. Rodd, and all the surrounding\ncircumstances.  If so, I daresay that they were wise, but of\ncourse it may have been only carelessness.  It is so easy for\nbusy and fashionable folk not to answer a rather troublesome\nletter, or to forget to put that answer in the post.  Or, indeed,\nthe letter may never have reached them--such things often go\nastray, especially when people live abroad.  At any rate, perhaps\nthrough my own fault, we have drifted apart.  I daresay they\nbelieve that I am dead, or not to be found somewhere in Africa.\nHowever, I always think of them with affection, for Anscombe was\none of the best travelling companions I ever had, and his wife a\nmost charming girl, and wonder whether Zikali's prophecy about\ntheir children will come true.  Good luck go with them!\n\nAs it chances, since then I passed the place where the Temple\nstood, though at a little distance.  I had the curiosity,\nhowever, at some inconvenience, to ride round and examine the\nspot.  I suppose that Heda had sold the property, for a back-veld\nBoer, who was absent at the time, had turned what used to be\nRodd's hospital into his house.  Close by, grim and gaunt, stood\nthe burnt-out marble walls of the Temple.  The verandah was still\nroofed over, and standing on the spot whence I had shot the\npistol out of Rodd's hand, I was filled with many memories.\n\nI could trace the whole plan of the building and visited that\npart of it which had been Marnham's room.  The iron safe that\nstood in the corner had been taken away, but the legs of the\nbedstead remained.  Also not far from it, over grown with running\nplants, was a little heap which I took to be the ashes of his\ndesk, for bits of burnt wood protruded.  I grubbed among them\nwith my foot and riding crop and presently came across the\nremains of a charred human skull.  Then I departed in a hurry.\n\nMy way took me through the Yellow-wood grove, past the horns of\nthe blue wildebeeste which still lay there, past that mud-hole\nalso into which Rodd had fallen dead.  Here, however, I made no\nmore search, who had seen enough of bones.  To this day I do not\nknow whether he still lies beneath the slimy ooze, or was removed\nand buried.\n\nAlso I saw the site of our wagon camp where the Basutos attacked\nus.  But I will have done with these reminiscences which induce\nmelancholy, though really there is no reason why they should.\n\nTout lasse, tout casse, tout passe--everything wears out,\neverything crumbles, everything vanishes--in the words of the\nFrench proverb that my friend Sir Henry Curtis is so fond of\nquoting, that at last I wrote it down in my pocket-book, only to\nremember afterwards that when I was a boy I had heard it from the\nlips of an old scamp of a Frenchman, of the name of Leblanc, who\nonce gave me and another lessons in the Gallic tongue.  But of\nhim I have already written in _Marie,_ which is the first chapter\nin the Book of the fall of the Zulus.  That headed _Child of\nStorm_ is the second.  These pages form the third and last.\n\nAh! indeed, tout lasse, tout casse, tout passe!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\n\n\nTHE KRAAL JAZI\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I shall pass over all the Zulu record of the next four years,\nsince after all it has nothing to do with my tale and I do not\npretend to be writing a history.\n\nSir Garnet Wolseley set up his Kilkenny cat Government in\nZululand, or the Home Government did it for him, I do not know\nwhich.  In place of one king, thirteen chiefs were erected who\ngot to work to cut the throats of each other and of the people.\n\nAs I expected would be the case, Zikali informed the military\nauthorities of the secret hiding-place in the Ingome Forest where\nhe suggested to Cetewayo that he should refuge.  The ex-king was\nduly captured there and taken first to the Cape and then to\nEngland, where, after the disgrace of poor Sir Bartle Frere, an\nagitation had been set on foot on his behalf.  Here he saw the\nQueen and her ministers, once more conquering, as it had been\nprophesied that he would by her who wore the shape of Mameena at\nthe memorable scene in the Valley of Bones when I was present.\nOften I have thought of him dressed in a black coat and seated in\nthat villa in Melbury Road in the suburb of London which I\nunderstand is populated by artists.  A strange contrast truly to\nthe savage prince receiving the salute of triumph after the\nBattle of the Tugela in which he won the kingship, or to the\nroyal monarch to whose presence I had been summoned at Ulundi.\nHowever, he was brought back to Zululand again by a British\nman-of-war, re-installed to a limited chieftainship by Sir\nTheophilus Shepstone, and freed from the strangling embrace of\nthe black coat.\n\nThen of course there was more fighting, as every one knew would\nhappen, except the British Colonial Office; indeed all Zululand\nran with blood.  For in England Cetewayo and his rights, or\nwrongs, had, like the Boers and their rights, or wrongs, become a\nmatter of Party politics to which everything else must give way.\nOften I wonder whether Party politics will not in the end prove\nthe ruin of the British Empire.  Well, thank Heaven, I shall not\nlive to learn.\n\nSo Cetewayo came back and fought and was defeated by those who\nonce had been his subjects.  Now for the last scene, that is all\nwith which I need concern myself.\n\nAt the beginning of February, 1884, business took me to Zululand;\nit had to do with a deal in cattle and blankets.  As I was\nreturning towards the Tugela who should I meet but friend Goza,\nhe who had escorted me from the Black Kloof to Ulundi before the\noutbreak of war, and who afterwards escorted me and that\nunutterable nuisance, Kaatje, out of the country.  At first I\nthought that we came together by accident, or perhaps that he had\njourneyed a little way to thank me for the blankets which I had\nsent to him, remembering my ancient promise, but afterwards I\nchanged my opinion on this point.\n\nWell, we talked over many matters, the war, the disasters that\nhad befallen Zululand, and so forth.  Especially did we talk of\nthat night in the Valley of Bones and the things we had seen\nthere side by side.  I asked him if the people still believed in\nthe Inkosazana-y-Zulu who then appeared in the moonlight on the\nrock.  He answered that some did and some did not.  For his part,\nhe added, looking at me fixedly, he did not, since it was\nrumoured that Zikali had dressed up a white woman to play the\npart of the Spirit.  Yet he could not be sure of the matter,\nsince it was also said that when some of Cetewayo's people went\nto kill this white woman in the Black Kloof, Nomkubulwana, the\nPrincess of Heaven herself, rose before them and frightened them\naway.\n\nI remarked that this was very strange, and then quite casually\nasked him whom Zikali had dressed up to play the part of the dead\nMameena upon that same occasion, since this was a point upon\nwhich I always thirsted for definite intelligence.  He stared at\nme and replied that I ought to be able to answer my own question,\nsince I had been much nearer to her who looked like Mameena than\nany one else, so near indeed that all present distinctly saw her\nkiss me, as it was well known she had liked to do while still\nalive.  I replied indignantly that they saw wrong and repeated my\nquestion.  Then he answered straight out--\n\n\"O Macumazahn, we Zulus believe that what we saw on that night\nwas not Nombe or another dressed up, but the spirit of the witch\nMameena itself.  We believe it because we could see the light of\nZikali's fire through her, not always, but sometimes; also\nbecause all that she said has come true, though everything is not\nyet finished.\"\n\nI could get no more out of him about the matter, for when I tried\nto speak of it again, he turned the subject, telling me of his\nwonderful escapes during the war.  Presently he rose to go and\nsaid casually--\n\n\"Surely I grow old in these times of trouble, Macumazahn, for\nthoughts slip through my head like water through the fingers.\nAlmost I had forgotten what I wished to say to you.  The other\nday I met Zikali, the Opener of Roads.  He told me that you were\nin Zululand and that I should meet you--he did not say where,\nonly that when I did meet you, I was to give you a message.  This\nwas the message--that when on your way to Natal you came to the\nkraal Jazi, you would find him there; also another whom you used\nto know, and must be sure not to go away without seeing him,\nsince that was about to happen in which you must take your part.\"\n\n\"Zikali!\" I exclaimed.  \"I have heard nothing of him since the\nwar.  I thought that by now he was certainly dead.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, Macumazahn, he is certainly not dead, but just the same\nas ever.  Indeed it is believed that he and no other has kept all\nthis broth of trouble on the boil, some say for Cetewayo's sake,\nand some say because he wishes to destroy Cetewayo.  But what do\nI know of such matters who only desire to live in peace under\nwhatever chief the English Queen sends to us, as she has a right\nto do having conquered us in war?  When you meet the Opener of\nRoads at the kraal Jazi, ask him, Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"Where the devil is the kraal Jazi?\" I inquired with irritation.\n\"I never heard of such a place.\"\n\n\"Nor did I, therefore I cannot tell you, Macumazahn.  For aught I\ncan say it may be down beneath where dead men go.  But wherever\nit is there certainly you will meet the Opener of Roads.  Now\nfarewell, Macumazahn.  If it should chance that we never look\ninto each other's eyes again, I am sure you will think of me\nsometimes, as I shall of you, and of all that we have seen\ntogether, especially on that night in the Vale of Bones when the\nghost of the witch Mameena prophesied to us and kissed you before\nus all.  She must have been very beautiful, Macumazahn, as indeed\nI have heard from those who remember her, and I don't wonder that\nyou loved her so much.  Still for my part I had rather be kissed\nby a living woman than by one who is dead, though doubtless it is\nbest to be kissed by none at all.  Again, farewell, and be sure\nto tell the Opener of Roads that I gave you his message, lest he\nshould lay some evil charm upon me, who have seen enough evil of\nlate.\"\n\nThus talking Goza departed.  I never saw him again, and do not\nknow if he is dead or alive.  Well, he was a kindly old fellow,\nif no hero.\n\n\nI had almost forgotten the incident of this meeting when a while\nlater I found myself in the neighbourhood of the beautiful but\nsemi-tropical place called Eshowe, which since those days has\nbecome the official home of the British Resident in Zululand.\nIndeed, although the house was not then finished, if it had been\nbegun, Sir Melmoth Osborn already had an office there.  I wished\nto see him in order to give him some rather important\ninformation, but when I reached a kraal of about fifty huts some\nfive hundred yards from the site of the present Residency, my\nwagon stuck fast in the boggy ground.  While I was trying to get\nit out a quiet-faced Zulu, whose name, I remember, was Umnikwa,\ninformed me that Malimati, that is Sir Melmoth Osborn's native\nname, was somewhere at a little distance from Eshowe, too far\naway for me to get to him that night.  I answered, Very well, I\nwould sleep where I was, and asked the name of the kraal.\n\nHe replied, Jazi, at which I started, but only said that it was a\nstrange name, seeing that it meant \"Finished,\" or \"Finished with\njoy.\"  Umnikwa answered, Yes, but that it had been so called\nbecause the chief Umfokaki, or The Stranger, who married a sister\nof the king, was killed at this kraal by his brother, Gundane, or\nthe Bat.  I remarked that it was an ill-omened kind of name, to\nwhich the man replied, Yes, and likely to become more so, since\nthe King Cetewayo who had been sheltering there \"beneath the\narmpit\" of Malimati, the white lord, for some months, lay in it\ndying.  I asked him of what he was dying, and he replied that he\ndid not know, but that doubtless the father of the witch-doctors,\nnamed Zikali, the Opener of Roads, would be able to tell me, as\nhe was attending on Cetewayo.\n\n\"He has sent me to bid you to come at once, O Macumazahn,\" he\nadded casually, \"having had news that you were arriving here.\"\n\nShowing no surprise, I answered that I would come, although\ngoodness knows I was surprised enough, and leaving my servants to\nget my wagon out of the bog, I walked into the kraal with the\nmessenger.  He took me to a large hut placed within a fence about\nthe gate of which some women were gathered, who all looked very\nanxious and disturbed.  Among them I saw Dabuko the king's\nbrother, whom I knew slightly.  He greeted me and told me that\nCetewayo was at the point of death within the hut, but like\nUmnikwa, professed ignorance of the cause of his illness.\n\nFor a long while, over an hour I should think, I sat there\noutside the hut, or walked to and fro.  Until darkness came I\ncould occupy myself with contemplating the scenery of the\nencircling hills, which is among the most beautiful in Zululand\nwith its swelling contours and rich colouring.  But after it had\nset in only my thoughts remained, and these I found depressing.\n\nAt length I made up my mind that I would go away, for after all\nwhat had I to do with this business of the death of Cetewayo, if\nin truth he was dying?  I wished to see no more of Cetewayo of\nwhom all my recollections were terrific or sorrowful.  I rose to\ndepart, when suddenly a woman emerged from the hut.  I could not\nsee who she was or even what she was like, because of the gloom;\nalso for the reason that she had the corner of her blanket thrown\nover her face as though she wished to keep it hidden.  For a\nmoment she stopped opposite to me and said--\n\n\"The king who is sick desires to see you, Macumazahn.\"  Then she\npointed to the door-hole of the hut and vanished, shutting the\ngate of the fence behind her.  Curiosity overcame me and I\ncrawled into the hut, pushing aside the door-board in order to do\nso and setting it up again when I was through.\n\nInside burned a single candle fixed in the neck of a bottle,\nfaintly illuminating that big and gloomy place.  By its feeble\nlight I saw a low bedstead on the left of the entrance and lying\non it a man half covered by a blanket in whom I recognized\nCetewayo.  His face was shrunken and distorted with pain, and his\ngreat bulk seemed less, but still without doubt it was Cetewayo.\n\n\"Greeting, Macumazahn,\" he said feebly, \"you find me in evil\ncase, but I heard that you were here and thought that I should\nlike to see you before I die, because I know that you are honest\nand will report my words faithfully.  I wish you to tell the\nwhite men that my heart never really was against them; they have\nalways been the friends of my heart, but others forced me down a\nroad I did not wish to travel, of which now I have come to the\nend.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with you, King?\" I asked.\n\n\"I do not know, Macumazahn, but I have been sick for some days.\nThe Opener of Roads who came to doctor me, because my wives\nbelieved those white medicine-men wished me dead, says that I\nhave been poisoned and must die.  If you had been here at first\nyou might perhaps have given me some medicine.  But now it is too\nlate,\" he added with a groan.\n\n\"Who then poisoned you, King?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you, Macumazahn.  Perhaps my enemies, perhaps my\nbrothers, perhaps my wives.  All wish to have done with me, and\nthe Great One, who is no longer wanted, is soon dead.  Be\nthankful, Macumazahn, that you never were a king, for sad is the\nlot of kings.\"\n\n\"Where, then, is the Opener of Roads?\" I asked.\n\n\"He was here a little while ago.  Perhaps he has gone out to take\nthe King's head\" (i.e., to announce his death) \"to Malimati and\nthe white men,\" he answered in a faint voice.\n\nJust then I heard a shuffling noise proceeding from that part of\nthe hut where the shadow was deepest, and looking, saw an\nemaciated arm projected into the circle of the light.  It was\nfollowed by another arm, then by a vast head covered with long\nwhite hair that trailed upon the ground, then by a big, misshapen\nbody, so wasted that it looked like a skeleton covered with\ncorrugated black skin.  Slowly, like a chameleon climbing a\nbough, the thing crept forward, and I knew it for Zikali.  He\nreached the side of the bed and squatted down in his toad-like\nfashion, then, again like a chameleon, without moving his head\nturned his deep and glowing eyes towards me.\n\n\"Hail, O Macumazahn,\" he said in his low voice.  \"Did I not\npromise you long ago that you should be with me at the last, and\nare you not with me and another?\"\n\n\"It seems so, Zikali,\" I answered.  \"But why do you not send for\nthe white doctors to cure the king?\"\n\n\"All the doctors, white and black, in the whole world cannot cure\nhim, Macumazahn.  The Spirits call him and he dies.  At his call\nI came fast and far, but even I cannot cure him--although because\nof him I myself must die.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Look at me, Macumazahn, and say if I am one who should travel.\nWell, all come to their end at last, even the\n'Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born.'\"\n\nCetewayo lifted his head and looked at him, then said heavily--\n\n\"Perchance it would have been better for our House if that end\nhad been sooner.  Now that I lie dying many sayings concerning\nyou come into my mind that I had forgotten.  Moreover, Opener of\nRoads, I never sent for you, whoever may have done so, and it was\nnot until after you came here that the great pain seized me.  How\ndid it happen,\" he went on with gathering force, \"that the white\nmen caught me in the secret place where you told me I should\nhide?  Who pointed out that hidden hole to the white men?  But\nwhat does it matter now?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all, O Son of Panda,\" answered Zikali, \"even less\nthan it matters how I escaped the spear-head hidden in your robe,\nyonder in my hut in the Black Kloof where, had it not been for a\ncertain spirit that stood between you and me, you would have\nmurdered me.  Tell me, Son of Panda, during these last three days\nhave you thought at all of your brother Umbelazi, and of certain\nother brethren of yours whom you killed at the battle of the\nTugela, when the white man here led the charge of the Amawombe\nagainst your regiments and ate up three of them?\"\n\nCetewayo groaned but said nothing.  I think he had become too\nfaint to speak.\n\n\"Listen, Son of Panda,\" went on Zikali in an intense and hissing\nvoice.  \"Many, many years ago, before Senzangacona, your\ngrandfather, saw the light--who knows how long before--a man was\nborn of high blood in the Dwandwe tribe, which man was a dwarf.\nChaka the Black One conquered the Dwandwe, but this man of high\nblood was spared because he was a dwarf, an abortion, to whom\nChaka gave the name of the\n'Thing-that-never-should-have-been-born,' keeping him about him\nto be a mock in times of peace and safety, and because he was\nwise and learned in magic, to be a counsellor in times of\ntrouble.  Moreover, Chaka killed this man's wives and children\nfor his sport, save one whom he kept to be his 'sister.'\n\n\"Therefore for the sake of his people and his butchered wives and\nchildren, this wizard swore an oath of vengeance against Chaka\nand all his House.  Working beneath the ground like a rat, he\nundermined the throne of Chaka and brought him to his death by\nthe spears of his brethren and of Mopo his servant, whom Chaka\nhad wronged.  Still working in the dark like a rat, he caused\nDingaan, who stabbed Chaka, to murder the Boer Retief and his\npeople, and thus called down upon his head the vengeance of the\nWhites, and afterwards brought Dingaan to his death.  Then Panda,\nyour father, arose, and his life this\n'Thing-that-never-should-have-been-born' spared because once\nPanda had done him a kindness.  Only through the witch Mameena he\nbrought sorrow on him, causing war to arise between his children,\none of whom was named Cetewayo.\n\n\"Then this Cetewayo ruled, first with his father Panda and\nafterwards in his place, and trouble arose between him and the\nEnglish.  Son of Panda, you will remember that this Cetewayo was\nin doubt whether to fight the English and demanded a sign of the\nThing-that-never-should-have-been-born.  He gave the sign,\ncausing the Inkosazana-y-Zulu, the Princess of Heaven, to appear\nbefore him and thereby lifting the spear of War.  Son of Panda,\nyou know how that war went, how this Cetewayo was defeated and\ncame to the 'Thing-that-never-should-have-been-born' like a\nhunted hyena, to learn of a hole where he might hide.  You know,\ntoo, how he strove to murder the poor old doctor who showed him\nsuch a hole; how he was taken prisoner and sent across the water\nand afterwards set up again in the land that had learned to hate\nhim, to bring its children to death by thousands.  And you know\nhow at last he took refuge beneath the wing of the white chief,\nhere in the kraal Jazi, and lived, spat upon, an outcast, until\nat length he fell sick, as such men are apt to do, and the\nThing-that-never-should-have-been-born was sent for to doctor\nhim.  And you know also how he lies dying, within him an agony as\nthough he had swallowed a red hot spear, and before him a great\nblackness peopled by the ghosts of those whom he has slain, and\nof his forefathers whose House he has pulled down and burned.\"\n\nZikali ceased, and thrusting his hideous head to within an inch\nor two of that of the dying man, he glowered at him with his\nfierce and fiery eves.  Then he began to whisper into the king's\near, who quivered at his words, as the victim quivers beneath the\ntorturer's looks.\n\nAt that moment the end of the candle fell into the bottle which\nwas of clear white glass, and there burned for a little while\ndully before it went out.  Never shall I forget the scene\nillumined by its blue and ghastly light.  The dying man lying on\nthe low couch, rocking his head to and fro; the wizard bending\nover him like some grey vampire bat sucking the life-blood from\nhis helpless throat.  The terror in the eyes of the one, the\ninsatiable hate in the eyes of the other.  Oh! it was awful!\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" gasped Cetewayo in a rattling whisper, \"help me,\nMacumazahn.  I say that I am poisoned by this Zikali, who hates\nme.  Oh! drive away the ghosts! Drive them away!\"\n\nI looked at him and at his tormentor squatted by him like a\nmocking fiend, and as I looked the candle went out.\n\nThen my nerve broke, the cold sweat poured from my face and I\nfled from the hut as a man might from a scene in hell, followed\nby the low mocking laugh of Zikali.\n\nOutside the women and others were gathered in the gloom.  I told\nthem to go to the king, who was dying, and blundered up the slope\nto search for some white man.  No one was to be found, but a\nKaffir messenger by the office told me that Malimati was still\naway and had been sent for.  So I returned to my wagon and lay\ndown in it exhausted, for what more could I do?\n\n\nIt was a rough night.  Thunder muttered and rain fell in driving\ngusts.  I dozed off, only to be awakened by a sound of wailing.\nThen I knew that the king was dead, for this was the Isililo, the\ncry of mourning.  I wondered whether the murderers--for that he\nwas poisoned I had no doubt--were among those who wailed.\n\nTowards dawn the storm rolled off and the night grew serene and\nclear, for a waning moon was shining in the sky.  The heat of\nthat stiffing place oppressed me; my blood seemed to be afire.  I\nknew that there was a stream in a gorge about half a mile away,\nfor it had been pointed out to me.  I longed for a swim in cool\nwater, who, to tell truth, had found none for some days, and\nbethought me that I would bathe in this stream before I trekked\nfrom that hateful spot, for to me it had become hateful.  Calling\nmy driver, who was awake and talking with the voorloopers, for\nthey knew what was passing at the kraal and were alarmed, I told\nthem to get the oxen ready to start as I would be back presently.\nThen I set off for the stream and, after a longish walk,\nscrambled down a steep ravine to its banks, following a path made\nby Kaffir women going to draw water.  Arrived there at last I\nfound that it was in flood and rising rapidly, at least so I\njudged from the sound, for in that deep, tree-hung place the\nlight was too faint to allow me to see anything.  So I sat down\nwaiting for the dawn and wishing that I had not come because of\nthe mosquitoes.\n\nAt length it broke and the mists lifted, showing that the spot\nwas one of great beauty.  Opposite to me was a waterfall twenty\nor thirty feet high, over which the torrent rushed into a black\npool below.  Everywhere grew tall ferns and beyond these graceful\ntrees, from whose leaves hung raindrops.  In the centre of the\nstream on the edge of the fall was a rock not a dozen feet away\nfrom me, round which the water foamed.  Something was squatted on\nthis rock, at first I could not see what because of the mist, but\nthought that it was a grey-headed baboon, or some other animal,\nand regretted that I had not brought a gun with me.  Presently I\nbecame aware that it must be a man, for, in a chanting voice, it\nbegan to speak or pray in Zulu, and hidden behind a flowering\nbush, I could hear the words.  They were to this effect--\n\n\"O my Spirit, here where thou foundest me when I was young,\nhundreds of years ago\" (he said hundreds, but I suppose he meant\ntens), \"I come back to thee.  In this pool I dived and beneath\nthe waters found thee, my Snake, and thou didst wind thyself\nabout my body and about my heart\" (here I understood that the\nspeaker was alluding to his initiation as a witch-doctor which\ngenerally includes, or used to include, the finding of a snake in\na river that coils itself about the neophyte).  \"About my body\nand in my heart thou hast dwelt from that sun to this, giving me\nwisdom and good and evil counsel, and that which thou hast\ncounselled, I have done.  Now I return thee whence thou camest,\nthere to await me in the new birth.\n\n\"O Spirits of my fathers, toiling through many years I have\navenged you on the House of Senzangacona, and never again will\nthere be a king of the Zulus, for the last of them lies dead by\nmy hand.  O my murdered wives and my children, I have offered up\nto you a mighty sacrifice, a sacrifice of thousands upon\nthousands.\n\n\"O Umkulu-kulu, Great One of the heavens, who sentest me to\nearth, I have done thy work upon the earth and bring back to thee\nthy harvest of the seed that thou hast sown, a blood-red harvest,\nO Umkulu-kulu.  Be still, be still, my Snake, the sun arises, and\nsoon, soon shalt thou rest in the water that wast thine from the\nbeginning of the world!\"\n\n\nThe voice ceased, and presently a spear of light piercing the\nmists, lit upon the speaker.  It was Zikali and about him was\nwound a great yellow-bellied snake, of which the black head with\nflickering tongue waved above his head and seemed from time to\ntime to lick him on the brow.  (I suppose it had come to him from\nthe water, for its skin glittered as though with wet.)  He stood\nup on tottering feet, staring at the red eye of the rising sun,\nthen crying, _\"Finished, finished with joy!\"_ with a loud and\ndreadful laughter, he plunged into the foaming pool beneath.\n\n\nSuch was the end of Zikali the Wizard, Opener of Roads, the\n\"Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born,\" and such was the\nvengeance that he worked upon the great House of Senzangacona,\nbringing it to naught and with it the nation of the Zulus.\n\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FINISHED***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 1724.txt or 1724.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/7/2/1724\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n\n\n"}
