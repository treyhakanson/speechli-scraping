He recognized a fact and based a game on it, with\nthe result that his game endures.  And what he clearly recognized was\nthis:  That no king matters much as long as your side is playing a\nwinning game.  You can leave your king in his corner then to amuse\nhimself in dignified unimportance. But the minute you begin to lose,\nyour king becomes a source of anxiety.\n\nIn what is called real life (which is only a great game, although a\nmighty good one) it makes no difference what you call your king.  Call\nhim Pope if you want to, or President, or Chairman. He grows in\nimportance in proportion as the other side develops the attack.  You've\ngot to keep your symbol of authority protected or you lose.\n\nNevertheless, your game is not lost as long as your king can move.\nThat's why the men who want to hurry up and start a new political era\nimprison kings and cut their heads off.  With no head on his shoulders\nyour king can only move in the direction of the cemetery, which is over\nthe line and doesn't count.\n\nI love a good fight, and have been told I ought to be ashamed of it.\nI've noticed, though, that the folk who propose to elevate my morals\nfight just as hard, and less cleanly, with their tongue than some of us\ndo with our fists and sinews.  I'm told, too, quite frequently that as\nan American I ought to be ashamed of fighting for a king.  Dear old\nladies of both sexes have assured me that it isn't moral to give aid and\ncomfort to a gallant gentleman--a godless Mohammedan, too;  which makes\nit much worse--who is striving gamely and without malice to keep his\ngiven word and save his country.\n\nBut if you've got all you want, do you know of any better fun than\nlending a hand while some man you happen to like gets his? I don't.  Of\ncourse, some fellows want too much, and it's bad manners as well as\nwaste of time to inflict your opinion on them. But given a reasonable\npurpose and a friend who needs your assistance, is there any better\nsport on earth than risking your own neck to help him put it over?\n\nWalk wide of the man and particularly of the woman, who makes a noise\nabout lining your pocket or improving your condition.  An altruist is my\nfriend James Schuyler Grim, but he makes less noise than a panther on a\ndark night;  and I never knew a man less given to persuading you.  He\nhas one purpose, but almost never talks about it.  It's a sure bet that\nif we hadn't struck up a close friendship, sounding each other out\ncarefully as opportunity occurred, I would have been in the dark about\nit until this minute.\n\nAll the news of Asia from Alexandretta to the Persian Gulf and from\nNorthern Turkestan to South Arabia reaches Grim's ears sooner or later.\nHe earns his bread and butter knitting all that mess of cross-grained\ninformation into one intelligible pattern; after which he interprets it\nand acts suddenly without advance notices.\n\nTime and again, lone-handed, he has done better than an army corps, by\nplaying chief against chief in a land where the only law is individual\ninterpretation of the Koran.\n\nBut it wasn't until our rescue of Jeremy Ross from near Abu Kem, that I\never heard Grim come out openly and admit that he was working to\nestablish Feisul, third son of the King of Mecca, as king of just as\nmany Arabs as might care to have him over them. That was the cat he had\nbeen keeping in a bag for seven years.\n\nRight down to the minute when Grim, Jeremy and I sat down with Ben Saoud\nthe Avenger on a stricken field at Abu Kem, and Grim and Jeremy played\ntheir hands so cleverly that the Avenger was made, unwitting guardian of\nJeremy's secret gold-mine, and Feisul's open and sworn supporter in the\nbargain, the heart of Grim's purpose continued to be a mystery even to\nme;  and I have been as intimate with him as any man.\n\nHe doles out what he has in mind as grudgingly as any Scot spends the\nshillings in his purse.  But the Scots are generous when they have to\nbe, and so is Grim.  There being nothing else for it on that occasion,\nhe spilled the beans, the whole beans, and nothing but the beans.\nHaving admitted us two to his secret, he dilated on it all the way back\nto Jerusalem, telling us all he knew of Feisul (which would fill a\nbook), and growing almost lyrical at times as he related incidents in\nproof of his contention that Feisul, lineal descendant of the Prophet\nMohammed, is the \"whitest\" Arab and most gallant leader of his race\nsince Saladin.\n\nKnowing Grim and how carefully suppressed his enthusiasm usually is, I\ncouldn't help being fired by all he said on that occasion.\n\nAnd as for Jeremy, well--it was like meat and drink to him.  You meet\nmen more or less like Jeremy Ross in any of earth's wild places,\nalthough you rarely meet his equal for audacity, irreverence and riotous\ngood-fellowship.  He isn't the only Australian by a long shot who\nupholds Australia by fist and boast and astounding gallantry, yet stays\naway from home.  You couldn't fix Jeremy with concrete;  he'd find some\nmeans of bursting any mould.\n\nHe had been too long lost in the heart of Arabia for anything except the\nthought of Sydney Bluffs and the homesteads that lie beyond to tempt him\nfor the first few days.\n\n\"You fellers come with me,\" he insisted.  \"You chuck the Army, Grim, and\nI'll show you a country where the cows have to bend their backs to let\nthe sun go down.  Ha-ha!  Show you women too--red-lipped girls in\nsunbonnets, that'll look good after the splay-footed crows you see out\nhere.  Tell you what:  We'll pick up the Orient boat at Port Said--no P.\nand O. for me;  I'm a passenger aboard ship, not a horrible example!--\nand make a wake for the Bull's Kid.  Murder!  Won't the scoff taste\ngood!\n\n\"We'll hit the Bull's Kid hard for about a week--mix it with the fellers\nin from way back--you know--dry-blowers, pearlers, spending it easy--\nhanding their money to Bessie behind the bar and restless because she\nmakes it last too long;  watch them a while and get in touch with all\nthat's happening;  then flit out of Sydney like bats out of--and hump\nblue--eh?\"\n\n\"Something'll turn up;  it always does.  I've got money in the bank--\nabout, two thousand here in gold dust with me,--and if what you say's\ntrue, Grim, about me still being a trooper, then the Army owes me three\nyears' back pay, and I'll have it or go to Buckingham Palace and tear\noff a piece of the King!  We're capitalists, by Jupiter!  Besides, you\nfellers agreed that if I shut down the mine at Abu Kem you'd join me and\nwe'd be Grim, Ramsden and Ross.\"\n\n\"I'll keep the bargain if you hold me to it when the time comes,\" Grim\nanswered.\n\n\"You bet I'll hold you to it!  Rammy here, and you and I could trade the\nchosen people off the map between us.  We're a combination.  What's time\ngot to do with it?\"\n\n\"We've got to use your mine,\" Grim answered.\n\n\"I'm game.  But let's see Australia first.\"\n\n\"Suppose we fix up your discharge, and you go home,\" Grim suggested.\n\"Come back when you've had a vacation, and by that time Ramsden and I\nwill have done what's possible for Feisul. He's in Damascus now, but the\nFrench have got him backed into a corner.  No money--not much\nammunition--French propaganda undermining the allegiance of his men--\ntime working against him, and nothing to do but wait.\"\n\n\"What in hell have the French got to do with it?\"\n\n\"They want Syria.  They've got the coast towns now.  They mean to have\nDamascus;  and if they can catch Feisul and jail him to keep him out of\nmischief they will.\"\n\n\"But damn it!  Didn't they promise the Arabs that Feisul should be King\nof Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia, and all that?\"\n\n\"They did.  The Allies all promised, France included.  But since the\nArmistice the British have made a present of Palestine to the Jews, and\nthe French have demanded Syria for themselves.  The British are\npro-Feisul, but the French don't want him anywhere except dead or in\njail. They know they've given him and the Arabs a raw deal;  and they\nseem to think the simplest way out is to blacken Feisul's character and\nditch him.  If the French once catch him in Damascus he's done for and\nthe Arab cause is lost.\"\n\n\"Why lost?\" demanded Jeremy.  \"There are plenty more Arabs.\"\n\n\"But only one Feisul.  He's the only man who can unite them all.\"\n\n\"I know a chance for him,\" said Jeremy.  \"Let him come with us three to\nAustralia.  There are thousands of fellers there who fought alongside\nhim and don't care a damn for the French. They'll raise all the hell\nthere is before they'll see him ditched.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh!  London's the place for him,\" Grim answered.  \"The British like\nhim, and they're ashamed of the way he's been treated.  They'll give him\nMesopotamia.  Baghdad's the old Arab capital, and that'll do for a\nbeginning;  after that it's up to the Arabs themselves.\"\n\n\"Well?  Where does my gold mine come in?\" Jeremy asked.\n\n\"Feisul has no money.  If it was made clear to him that he could serve\nthe Arabs best by going to London, he'd consider it.  The objection\nwould be, though, that he'd have to make terms in advance with\nhog-financiers, who'd work through the Foreign Office to tie up all the\noil and mine and irrigation concessions. If we tell him privately about\nyour gold mine at Abu Kem he can laugh at financiers.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Jeremy, \"I'll give him the gold mine.  Let him erect a\nmodern plant and he'll have millions!\"\n\n\"Uh-huh!  Keep the mine secret.  Let him go to London and arrange about\nMespot.  Just at present High Finance could find a hundred ways of\ndisputing his title to the mine, but once he's king with the Arabs all\nrooting for him things'll be different.  He'll treat you right when that\ntime comes, don't worry.\"\n\n\"Worry?  Me?\" said Jeremy.  \"All that worries me is having to see this\nbusiness through before we can make a wake for Sydney.  I'm homesick.\nBut never mind.  All right, you fellers, I'll make one to give this\nFeisul boy a hoist!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\"Atcha, Jimgrim sahib!  Atcha!\"\n\n\nThat conversation and Jeremy's conversion to the big idea took place on\nthe way across the desert to Jerusalem--a journey that took us a week on\ncamel-back--a rowdy, hot journey with the stifling simoom blowing grit\ninto our followers' throats, who sang and argued alternately\nnevertheless.  For, besides our old Ali Baba and his sixteen sons and\ngrandsons, there were Jeremy's ten pickups from Arabia's byways, whom he\ncouldn't leave behind because they knew the secret of his gold-mine.\n\nGrim's authority is always at its height on the outbound trail, for then\neverybody knows that success, and even safety, depends on his swift\nthinking;  on the way home afterward reaction sets in sometimes, because\nArabs are made light-headed by success, and it isn't a simple matter to\ndiscipline free men when you have no obvious hold over them.\n\nBut that was where Jeremy came in.  Jeremy could do tricks, and the\nArabs were like children when he performed for them.  They would be good\nif he would make one live chicken into two live ones by pulling it\napart.  They would pitch the tents without fighting if he would swallow\na dozen eggs and produce them presently from under a camel's tail.  If\nhe would turn on his ventriloquism and make a camel say its prayers,\nthey were willing to forgive--for the moment anyhow--even their nearest\nenemies.\n\nSo we became a sort of travelling sideshow, with Jeremy ballyhooing for\nhimself in an amazing flow of colloquial Arabic, and hardly ever\nrepeating the same trick.\n\nAll of which was very good for our crowd and convenient at the moment,\nbut hardly so good for Jeremy's equilibrium.  He is one of those\nhandsome, perpetually youthful fellows, whose heads have been a wee mite\nturned by the sunshine of the world's warm smile. I don't mean by that\nthat he isn't a tophole man, or a thorough-going friend with guts and\ngumption, who would chance his neck for anyone he likes without a\nsecond's hesitation, for he's every bit of that.  He has horse sense,\ntoo, and isn't fooled by the sort of flattery that women lavish on men\nwho have laughing eyes and a little dark moustache.\n\nBut he hasn't been yet in a predicament that he couldn't laugh or fight\nhis way out of;  he has never yet found a job that he cared to stick at\nfor more than a year or two, and seldom one that could hold him for six\nmonths.\n\nHe jumps from one thing to another, finding all the world so interesting\nand amusing, and most folk so ready to make friends with him, that he\nalways feels sure of landing softly somewhere over the horizon.\n\nSo by the time we reached Jerusalem friend Jeremy was ripe for almost\nanything except the plan we had agreed on.  Having talked that over\npretty steadily most of the way from Abu Kem, it seemed already about as\nstale and unattractive to him as some of his oldest tricks.  And\nJerusalem provided plenty of distraction.  We hadn't been in Grim's\nquarters half an hour when Jeremy was up to his ears in a dispute that\nlooked like separating us.\n\nGrim, who wears his Arab clothes from preference and never gets into\nuniform if he can help it, went straight to the telephone to report\nbriefly to headquarters.  I took Jeremy upstairs to discard my Indian\ndisguise and hunt out clothes for Jeremy that would fit him, but found\nnone, I being nearly as heavy as Grim and Jeremy together.  He had\nfinished clowning in the kit I offered him, and had got back into his\nArab things while I was shaving off the black whiskers with which Nature\nadorns my face whenever I neglect the razor for a few days, when an auto\ncame tooting and roaring down the narrow street, and a moment later\nthree staff officers took the stairs at a run.  So far, good; that was\nunofficial, good-natured, human and entirely decent. The three of them\nburst through the bed  room door, all grins, and took turns pumping with\nJeremy's right arm--glad to see him--proud to know him--pleased to see\nhim looking fit and well, and all that kind of thing.  Even men who had\nfought all through the war had forgotten some of its red tape by that\ntime, and Jeremy not being in uniform they treated him like a fellow\nhuman being. And he reciprocated, Australian fashion, free and easy,\nthrowing up his long legs on my bed and yelling for somebody to bring\ndrinks for the crowd, while they showered questions on him.\n\nIt wasn't until Jeremy turned the tables and began to question them that\nthe first cloud showed itself.\n\n\"Say, old top,\" he demanded of a man who wore the crossed swords of a\nbrigadier.  \"Grim tells me I'm a trooper.  When can I get my discharge?\"\n\n\nThe effect was instantaneous.  You would have thought they had touched a\nleper by the way they drew themselves up and changed face.\n\n\"Never thought of that.  Oh, I say--this is a complication.  You\nmean...?\"\n\n\"I mean this,\" Jeremy answered dryly, because nobody could have helped\nnotice their change of attitude:  \"I was made prisoner by Arabs and\ncarried off.  That's more than three years ago.  The war's over.  Grim\ntells me all Australians have been sent home and discharged.  What about\nme?\"\n\n\"Um-m-m!  Ah!  This will have to be considered.  Let's see;  to whom did\nyou surrender?\"\n\n\"Damn you, I didn't surrender!  I met Grim in the desert, and reported\nto him for duty.\"\n\n\"Met Major Grim, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Grim, appearing in the door.  \"I came across him in the\ndesert;  he reported for duty;  I gave him an order, and he obeyed it.\nEverything's regular.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m!  How'd you make that out--regular?  Have you any proof he\nwasn't a deserter?  He'll have to be charged with desertion and tried by\ncourt martial, I'm afraid.  Possibly a mere formality, but it'll have to\nbe done, you know, before he can be given a clear discharge.  If he\ncan't be proved guilty of desertion he'll be cleared.\"\n\n\"How long will that take?\" Jeremy demanded.\n\nHis voice rang sharp with the challenge note that means debate has\nceased and quarrel started.  It isn't the right note for dissolving\ndifficulties.\n\n\"Couldn't tell you,\" said the brigadier.  \"My advice to you is to keep\nyourself as inconspicuous as possible until the administrator gets\nback.\"\n\nIt was good advice, but Grim, standing behind the brigadier, made\nsignals to Jeremy in vain.  Few Australians talk peace when there is no\npeace, and when there's a fight in prospect they like to get it over.\n\n\"I remember you,\" said Jeremy, speaking rather, slowly, and throwing in\na little catchy laugh that was like a war-cry heard through a\nmicrophone.  \"You were the Fusileer major they lent to the Jordan\nHighlanders--fine force that--no advance without security--lost two men,\nif I remember--snakebite one;  the other shot for looting.  Am I right?\nSo they've made you a brigadier! Aren't you the staff officer they sent\nto strafe a regiment of Anzacs for going into action without orders?  We\nchased you to cover!  I can see you now running for fear we'd shoot you!\nHah!\"\n\nGrim took the only course possible in the circumstances.  The\nbrigadier's neck was crimson, and Jeremy had to be saved somehow.\n\n\"Touch of sun, sir--that and hardship have unhinged him a bit. Suffers\nfrom delusions.  Suppose I keep him here until the doctor sees him?\"\n\n\"Um-m-m!  Ah!  Yes, you'd better.  See he gets no whisky, will you?  Too\nbad!  Too bad!  What a pity!\"\n\nOur three visitors left in a hurry, contriving to look devilish\nimportant.  Grim followed them out.\n\n\"Rammy, old cock,\" said Jeremy, sprawling on the bed again and laughing,\n\"don't look all that serious.  Bring back your brigadier and I'll kiss\nhim on both cheeks while you hold him! But say;  suppose that doctor's\none of these swabs who serve out number nine pills for shell-shock,\nbroken leg, dyspepsia, housemaid's knee and the creeping itch?  Suppose\nhe swears I'm luny?  What then?\"\n\n\"Grim will find somebody to swear to anything once,\" I answered. \"But\nyou look altogether too dashed healthy--got to give the doctor-man a\nchance--here, get between the sheets and kid that something hurts you.\"\n\n\"Get out!  The doc 'ud put a cast-iron splint on it, and order me into a\nhospital.  How about toothache?  That do?  Do they give you bread and\nwater for it?\"\n\nSo toothache was selected as an alibi, and Jeremy wrapped his jaw in a\ntowel, after jabbing his cheek with a pin so as to remember on which\nside the pain should be.  But it was artifice wasted, for Grim had\nturned a better trick.  He had found an Australian doctor in the\nhospital for Sikhs--the only other Australian in Jerusalem just then--\nand brought him cooee-ing upstairs in a way that proved he knew the\nwhole story already.\n\n\nThe autopsy, as he called it, was a riot.  We didn't talk of anything\nbut fights at Gaza--the surprise at Nazareth, when the German General\nStaff fled up the road on foot in its pyjamas--the three-day scrap at\nNebi Samwil, when Australians and Turks took and retook the same hill\nhalf a dozen times, and parched enemies took turns drinking from one\nflask while the shells of both sides burst above them.  It seems to have\nbeen almost like old-fashioned war in Palestine from their account of\nit, either side conceding that the other played the game.\n\nWhen they had thrashed the whole campaign over from start to finish,\nmaking maps on my bed with hair brushes, razors and things, they got to\ntalking of Australia;  and that was all about fighting too:  dog fights,\nfist fights between bullockies on the long road from Northern\nQueensland, riots in Perth when the pearlers came in off the Barrier\nReef to spend their pay, rows in the big shearing sheds when the Union\nmen objected to unskilled labour--you'd have thought Australia was one\nbig battlefield, with nothing else but fights worth talking of from dawn\ntill dark.\n\nThe doctor was one of those tightly-knit, dark-complexioned little men\nwith large freckles and brown eyes, who surprise you with a mixture of\nintense domestic virtue and a capacity, that shouldn't mix with it at\nall, for turning up in all the unexpected places.  You meet his sort\neverywhere, and they always have a wife along, who worships them and\nmakes a home out of tin cans and packing-cases that would put the\nstay-at-home housekeepers to shame.  They always have a picture on the\nwall of cows standing knee-deep in the water, and no matter what their\ncircumstances are, there's always something in reserve, for guests,\noffered frankly without apology.  Never hesitate with those folk, but\ndon't let them go too far, for they'll beggar themselves to help you in\na tight place, if you'll let them. Ticknor his name was.  He's a good\nman.\n\n\"Say, Grim, there's a case in the Sikh hospital that ought to interest\nyou,\" he said at last.  \"Fellow from Damascus--Arab--one of Feisul's\ncrowd.  He wouldn't let them take him to the Zionist hospital--swore a\nJew knifed him and that the others would finish the job if they got half\na chance.  They'd have been arguing yet, and he dead and buried, if I\nhadn't gone shopping with Mabel. She saw the crowd first (I was in\nNoureddin's store) and jabbed her way in with her umbrella--she yelled\nto me and I bucked the line.\n\n\"The Jews wanted to tell me I had no right to take that chap to the Sikh\nhospital, and no more had I;  so I plugged him up a bit, and put him in\na cab, and let him take himself there, Mabel and me beside him.  Seeing\nI was paying for the cab, I didn't see why Mabel should walk.  Of\ncourse, once we had him in there he was too sick to be moved;  but the\nArmy won't pay for him, so I sent a bill to the Zionists, and they\nreturned it with a rude remark on the margin.  Maybe I can get the money\nout of Feisul some day; otherwise I'm stuck.\"\n\n\"I'll settle that,\" said Grim.  \"What's the tune he plays?\"\n\n\"Utter mystery.  Swears a Jew stabbed him, but that Damascus outfit\nblame the Jews for everything.  He's only just down from Damascus.  I\nthink he's one of Feisul's officers, although he's not in uniform--\nprob'ly on a secret mission.  Suppose you go and see him?  But say,\nwatch out for the doc on duty--he's a meddler. Tell him nothing!\"\n\n\"Sure.  How about Jeremy?  What's the verdict?\"\n\n\"What do you want done with him?\"\n\n\"I want him out of reach of trouble here pending his discharge. No need\nto certify him mad, is there?\"\n\n\"Mad?  All Australians are mad.  None of us need a certificate for that.\nHave you arrested him?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Then you're too late!  He's suffering from bad food and exposure.  The\nair of Jerusalem's bad for him, and he's liable to get pugnacious if\nargued with.  That runs in the blood.  I order him off duty, and shall\nrecommend him within twenty minutes to the P.M.O. for leave of absence\nat his own expense.  If you know of any general who dares override the\nP.M.O. I'll show you a brass hat in the wind.  Come on;  d'you want to\nbet on it?\"\n\n\"Will the P.M.O. fall?\" asked Grim.\n\n\"Like a new chum off a brumby.  Signs anything I shove under his nose.\nComes round to our house to eat Mabel's damper and syrup three nights a\nweek.  You bet he'll sign it:  Besides, he's white;  pulled out of the\nfiring-line by an Australian at Gaza, and hasn't forgotten it.  He'd\nsign anything but checks to help an Anzac.  I'll be going.\n\n\"You trot up to the slaughter-shop, Grim, and interview that Arab--Sidi\nbin Something-or-Other--forget his name--he lies in number nineteen cot\non the left-hand side of the long ward, next to a Pathan who's shy both\nlegs.  You can't mistake him.  I'll write out a medical certificate for\nJeremy and follow.  And say; wait a minute!  What price the lot of you\neating Mabel's chow tonight at our house?  We don't keep a cook, so you\nwon't get poisoned.  That's settled;  I'll tell Mabel you're coming.\nTootleloo!\"\n\nBut there was a chance that the brigadier might carry resentment to the\npoint of sending up a provost-marshal's guard to arrest Jeremy on the\nwell-known principle that a bird in the hand can be strafed more easily\nthan one with a medical certificate.  The bush was the place for our\nbird until such time as the P.M.O.'s signature should adorn the\nnecessary piece of paper;  so we three rode up in a cab together to the\nSikh hospital, and had a rare time trying to get in.\n\nYou see, there was a Sikh on guard outside, who respected nothing under\nheaven but his orders.  He wouldn't have known Grim in any event, being\nonly recently from India;  Grim's uniform would have passed him in, but\nhe and Jeremy were still arrayed as Arabs, and my civilian clothes\nentitled me in the sentry's opinion to protection lest I commit the\nheinous sin of impertinence.  An Arab in his eyes was as an insect, and\na white man, who consorted with such creatures, not a person to be taken\nseriously.\n\nBut our friend Narayan Singh was in the hospital, enjoying the wise\nveteran's prerogative of resting on full pay after his strenuous\nadventures along with us at Abu Kem.  There was nothing whatever the\nmatter with him.  He recognized Grim's voice and emerged through the\nfront door with a milk-white smile flashing in the midst of newly-curled\nblack hair--dignified, immense, and full of instant understanding.\n\nGrim said a few words to Narayan Singh in Arabic, which so far as the\nsentry was concerned wasn't a language, but Narayan Singh spoke in turn\nin Punjabi, and the man just out from India began to droop like Jonah's\ngourd under the old soldier's scorn.\n\nIn consequence we got a full salute with arms presented, and walked in\nwithout having to trouble anybody in authority, Narayan Singh leading\nwith the air of an old-time butler showing royalty to their rooms.  He\neven ascertained in an aside, that the doctor of the day was busy\noperating, and broke that good news with consummate tact:\n\n\"The sahibs' lightest wish is law, but if they should wish to speak with\nthe doctor sahib, it would be necessary to call him forth from the\nsurgery, where he works behind locked doors.  Is it desired that I\nshould summon him?\"\n\n\"Operation serious?\" asked Grim, and neither man smiled.  It was perfect\nacting.\n\n\"Very, sahib.  He removes the half of a sepoy's liver.\"\n\n\"Uh!  Couldn't think of interrupting him.  Too bad!  Lead the way.\"\n\nBut we didn't enter the ward until Narayan Singh and an orderly had\nplaced two screens around number nineteen cot, in the way they do when a\nman is dying, and had placed three chairs at the bedside contrary to the\nregulations printed on the wall.  Then Narayan Singh stood on guard\noutside the screens, but didn't miss much of the conversation, I\nbelieve.\n\nThe man in bed was wounded badly, but not fatally, and though his eyes\nblazed with fever he seemed to have some of his wits about him.  He\nrecognized Grim after staring hard at him for about a minute.\n\n\"Jimgrim!\"\n\n\"Sidi bin Tagim, isn't it?  Well, well I thought it might be you,\" said\nGrim, speaking the northern dialect of Arabic, which differs quite a bit\nfrom that spoken around Jerusalem.\n\n\"Who are these?\" asked the man in bed, speaking hoarsely as he stared\nfirst at Jeremy and then at me.\n\n\"Jmil Ras, a friend of mine,\" Grim answered.\n\n\"And that one?\"\n\nHe didn't like the look of me at all.  Western clothes and a shaven face\nspell nothing reassuring to the Arab when in trouble; he has been\n\"helped\" by the foreigner a time or two too often.\n\n\"An American named Ramsden.  Also a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"Oh!  An Amirikani?  A hakim?\"\n\n\"No.  Not a doctor.  Not a man to fear.  He is a friend of Feisul.\"\n\n\"On whose word?\"\n\n\"Mine,\" Grim answered.\n\nSidi bin Tagim nodded.  He seemed willing to take Grim's word for\nanything.\n\n\"Why did you say a Jew stabbed you?\" Grim asked suddenly.\n\n\"So that they might hang a Jew or two.  Wallah!  Are the Jews not at the\nbottom of all trouble?  If a Greek should kill a Maltese it would be a\nJew who planned it!  May the curse of Allah change their faces and the\nfire of Eblis consume them!\"\n\n\"Did you see the man who stabbed you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAnd was he a Jew?\"\n\n\"Jimgrim, you know better than to ask that!  A Jew always hires another\nto do the killing.  He who struck me was a hireling, who shall die by my\nhand, as Allah is my witness.  But may Allah do more to me and bring me\ndown into the dust unburied unless I make ten Jews pay for this!\"\n\n\"Any one Jew in particular?\" Grim asked, and the man in bed closed up\nlike a clam that has been touched.\n\nHe was a strange-looking fellow--rather like one of those lean Spaniards\nwhom Goya used to paint, with a scant beard turning grey, and hollow\ncheeks.  He had thrown off the grey army blanket because fever burned\nhim, and his lean, hard muscles stood out as if cast in bronze.\n\n\"But for the Jews, Feisul would be king of all this land this minute!\"\nhe said suddenly, and closed up tight again.\n\nGrim smiled.  He nearly always does smile when apparently at a loose\nend.  At moments when most cross-examiners would browbeat he grows\nsympathetic--humours his man, and, by following whatever detour offers,\ngets back on the trail again.\n\n\"How about the French?\" he asked.\n\n\"May Allah smite them!  They are all in the pay of Jews!\"\n\n\"Can you prove it?\"\n\n\"Wallah!  That I can!\"\n\nGrim looked incredulous.  Those baffling eyes of his twinkled with quiet\namusement, and the man in bed resented it.\n\n\"You laugh, Jimgrim, but if you would listen I might tell you\nsomething.\"\n\nBut Grim only smiled more broadly than ever.\n\n\"Sidi bin Tagim, you're one of those fanatics who think the world is all\nleagued against you.  Why should the Jews think you sufficiently\nimportant to be murdered?\"\n\n\"Wallah!  There are few who hold the reins of happenings as I do.\"\n\n\"If they'd killed you they'd have stopped the clock, eh?\"\n\n\"That is as Allah may determine.  I am not dead.\"\n\n\"Have you friends in Jerusalem?\"\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"Strange that they haven't been to see you.\"\n\n\"Wallah!  Not strange at all.\"\n\n\"I see.  They regard you as a man without authority, who might make\ntrouble and leave other men to face it, eh?\"\n\n\"Who says I have no authority?\"\n\n\"Well, if you could prove you have--\"\n\n\"What then?\" the man in bed demanded, trying to sit up.  \"Feisul, for\ninstance, is a friend of mine, and these men with me are his friends\ntoo.  You have no letter, of course, for that would be dangerous...\"\n\n\"Jimgrim, in the name of the Most High, I swear I had a letter! He who\nstabbed me took it.  I--\"\n\n\"Was the letter from Feisul?\"\n\n\"Malaish--no matter.  It was sealed, and bore a number for the\nsignature.  If you can get that letter for me, Jimgrim--but what is the\nuse! You are a servant of the British.\"\n\n\"Tell me who stabbed you and I'll get you the letter.\"\n\n\"No, for you are clever.  You would learn too much.  Better tell the\ndoctor of this place to hurry up and heal me;  then I will attend to my\nown affairs.\"\n\n\"I'd like to keep you out of jail, if that's possible,\" Grim answered.\n\"You and I are old acquaintances, Sidi bin Tagim.  But of course, if\nyou're here to sow sedition, and should there be a document at large in\nproof of it, which document should fall into the hands of the police--\nwell, I couldn't do much for you then. You'd better tell me who stabbed\nyou, and I'll get after him.\"\n\n\"Ah!  But if you get the letter?\"\n\n\"I shall read it, of course.\"\n\n\"But to whom will you show it?\"\n\n\"Perhaps to my friends here.\"\n\n\"Are they bound by your honour?\"\n\n\"I shall hold them so.\"\n\nThere was the glint in Grim's eye now that should warn anyone who knew\nhim that the scent was hot;  added to the fact that the rest of his\nexpression suggested waning interest, that look of his forebode fine\nhunting.\n\n\"There's one other I might consult,\" he admitted casually.  \"On my way\nhere I saw one of Feisul's staff captains driving in a cab toward the\nJaffa Gate.\"\n\nThe instant effect of that remark was to throw the wounded man into a\nparoxysm of mingled rage and fear.  He almost threw a fit. His already\nbloodless face grew ashy grey and livid blue alternately, and he would\nhave screamed at Grim if the cough that began to rack his whole body\nwould have let him.  As it was, he gasped out unintelligible words and\nsought to make Grim understand by signs.  And Grim apparently did\nunderstand.\n\n\"Very well,\" he laughed, \"tell me who stabbed you and I won't mention\nyour name to Staff-Captain Abd el Kadir.\"\n\n\"And these men?  Will they say nothing?\"\n\n\"Not a word.  Who stabbed you?\"\n\n\"Yussuf Dakmar!  May Allah cut him off from love and mercy!\"\n\n\"Golly!\" exploded Jeremy, forgetting not to talk English. \"There's a\nswine for you!  Yussuf Dakmar's the son of a sea-cook who used to sell\nsheep to the Army four times over--drive 'em into camp and get a\nreceipt--drive 'em out again next night--bring 'em back in the morning--\nget a receipt again--drive 'em off--bring 'em back--us chaps too busy\nshifting brother Turk to cotton on.  He'll be the boy I kicked out of\ncamp once.  Maybe remembers it too.  I'll bet his backbone's twanging\nyet!  Lead me to him, Grim, old cock, I'd like another piece of him!\"\n\nBut Grim was humming to himself, playing piano on the bed-sheet with his\nfingers.\n\n\"Is that man not an Arab?\" asked the fellow in bed, taking alarm all\nover again.\n\n\"Arab your aunt!\" laughed Jeremy:  \"I eat Arabs!  I'm the only original\ngenuine woolly bad man from way back!  I'm the plumber who pulled the\nplug out of Arabia!  You know English?  Good!  You know what a dose of\nsalts is then?  You've seen it work? Experienced it, maybe?  Hah!\nYou'll understand me.  I'm a grain of the Epsom Salt that went through\nBeersheba, time the Turks had all the booze in sight and we were\nthirsty.  Muddy booze it was too--oozy booze--not fit for washing hogs!\nEver heard of Anzacs? Well, I'm one of 'em.  Now you know what the\nscorpion who stung you's up against!  You lie there and think about it,\ncocky;  I'll show you his shirt tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"Suppose we go now,\" suggested Grim.  \"I've got the drift of this thing.\nGet the rest elsewhere.\"\n\n\"You can fan that Joskins for a lot more yet,\" Jeremy objected. \"The\nplug's pulled.  He'll flow if you let him.\"\n\nGrim nodded.\n\n\"Sure he would.  Don't want too much from him.  Don't want to have to\narrest him.  Get me?\"\n\n\"Come on then,\" answered Jeremy, \"I've promised him a shirt!\"\n\nBeyond the screen Narayan Singh stood like a statue, deaf, dumb,\nimmovable.  Even his eyes were fixed with a blank stare on the wall\nopposite.\n\n\"How much did you hear?\" Grim asked him.\n\n\"I, sahib?  I am a sick man.  I have been asleep.\"\n\n\"Dream anything?\"\n\n\"As your honour pleases!\"\n\n\"Hospital's stuffy, isn't it?  Think you could recover health more\nrapidly outdoors?  Sick-leave continued of course, but--how about a\nlittle exercise?\"\n\nThe Sikh's eyes twinkled.\n\n\"Sahib, you know I need exercise!\"\n\n\"I'll speak to the doctor for you.  In case he signs a new certificate,\nreport to me tonight.\"\n\n\"Atcha, Jimgrim sahib!  Atcha!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\"Hum Dekta hai\"\n\n\nLike most of the quarters occupied by British officers, the house\noccupied by Major Roger Ticknor and his wife Mabel was \"enemy property,\"\nand its only virtue consisted in its being rent free. Grim, Jeremy,\nlittle Ticknor and his smaller wife, and I sat facing across a small\ndeal table with a stuttering oil-lamp between us.  In a house not far\naway some Orthodox Jews, arrayed in purple and green and orange, with\nfox-fur around the edges of their hats, were drunk and celebrating\nnoisily the Feast of Esther;  so you can work out the exact date if\nyou're curious enough.  The time was nine p.m.  We had talked the Anzac\nhurricane-drive through Palestine all over again from the beginning,\ntaking world-known names in vain and doing honour to others that will\nstay unsung for lack of recognition, when one of those unaccountable\npauses came, and for the sake of breaking silence, Mabel Ticknor asked a\nquestion.  She was a little, plucky, pale-faced thing whom you called\ninstinctively by her first name at the end of half an hour--a sort of\nlittle mother of loose-ended men, who can make silk purses out of sows'\nears, and wouldn't know how to brag if she were tempted.\n\n\"Say, Jim,\" she asked, turning her head quickly like a bird toward Grim\non my left, \"what's your verdict about that man from Syria that Roger\ntook in a cab to the Sikh hospital?  I'm out a new pair of riding\nbreeches if Roger has to pay the bill for him. I want my money's worth.\nTell me his story.\"\n\n\"Go ahead and buy the breeches, Mabel.  I'll settle that bill,\" he\nanswered.\n\n\"No, you won't, Jim!  You're always squandering money.  Half your pay\ngoes to the scallywags you've landed in jail.  This one's up to Roger\nand me;  we found him.\"\n\nGrim laughed.\n\n\"I can charge his keep under the head of 'information paid for.' I shall\nsign the voucher without a qualm.\"\n\n\"You'd get blood out of a stone, Jim!  Go on, tell us!\"\n\n\"I'm hired to keep secrets as well as discover them,\" Grim answered,\nsmiling broadly.\n\n\"Of course you are,\" she retorted.  \"But I know all Roger's secrets, and\nhe's a doctor, mind you!  Am I right, Roger?  Come along!  There are no\nservants--no eavesdroppers.  Wait.  I'll put tea on the table, and then\nwe'll all listen.\"\n\nShe made tea Australian fashion in a billy, which is quick and simple,\nbut causes alleged dyspepsia cures to sell well all the way from\nAdelaide to the Gulf of Carpentraia.\n\n\"You'll have to tell her, Jim,\" said Jeremy.\n\n\"Mabel's safe as an iron roof,\" put in her husband.  \"Noisy in the rain,\nbut doesn't leak.\"\n\nBut neither man nor woman could have extracted a story from James\nSchuyler Grim unless it suited him to tell it.  Mabel Ticknor is one of\nthose honest little women who carry men's secrets with them up and down\nthe world.  Being confided in by nearly every man who met her was a\nhabit.  But Grim tells only when the telling may accomplish something,\nand I wondered, as he laid his elbow on the table to begin, just what\nuse he meant to make of Mabel Ticknor.  He uses what he knows as other\nlevel-headed men use coin, spending thriftily for fair advantage.\n\n\"That is secret,\" he began, as soon as Mabel had dumped the contents of\nthe billy into a huge brown teapot.  \"I expect Narayan Singh here\npresently.  He'll have a letter with him, taken from the Syrian who\nstabbed that man in the hospital.\"\n\n\"Whoa, hoss!\" Jeremy interrupted.  \"You mean you've sent that Sikh to\nget the shirt of Yussuf Dakmar?\"\n\nGrim nodded.\n\n\"That was my job,\" Jeremy objected.\n\n\"Whoa, hoss, yourself, Jeremy!\" Grim answered.  \"You'd have gone down\ninto the bazaar like a bull into a china-shop.  Narayan Singh knows\nwhere to find him.  If he shows fight, he'll be simply handed over to\nthe Sikh patrol for attacking a man in uniform, and by the time he\nreaches the lock-up that letter will be here on the table between us.\"\n\n\"All the same, that's a lark you've done me out of,\" Jeremy insisted.\n\"That Yussuf Dakmar's a stinker.  I know all about him.  Two whole\nsquadrons had to eat lousy biscuit for a week because that swab sold the\nsame meat five times over.  But I'll get him yet!\"\n\n\"Well, as I was saying,\" Grim resumed, \"there's a letter in Jerusalem\nthat's supposed to be from Feisul.  But when Feisul writes anything he\nsigns his name to it, whereas a number is the signature on this.  Now\nthat fellow Sidi bin Tagim in the hospital is an honest old kite in his\nway.  He's a great rooter for Feisul.  And the only easy way to ditch a\nman like Feisul, who's as honest as the day is long, and no man's fool,\nis to convince his fanatical admirers that for his own sake he ought to\nbe forced along a certain course.  The game's as old as Adam. You fill\nup a man like Sidi bin Tagim with tales about Jews--convince him that\nJews stand between Feisul and a kingdom--and he'll lend a hand in any\nscheme ostensibly directed against Jews. Get me?\"\n\n\"So would I!\" swore Jeremy.  \"I'm against 'em too!  I camped alongside\nthe Jordan Highlanders one time when--\"\n\nBut we had had that story twice that evening with variations. He was\nbalancing his chair on two legs, so I pushed him over backward, and\nbefore he could pick himself up again Grim resumed.\n\n\"Feisul is in Damascus, and the Syrian Convention has proclaimed him\nking.  That don't suit the French, who detest him.  The feeling's\nmutual.  When Feisul went to Paris for the Peace Conference, the French\nimagined he was easy.  They thought, here's another of these Eastern\nprinces who can be taken in the old trap. So they staged a special\nperformance at the Opera for him, and invited him to supper afterward\nbehind the scenes with the usual sort of ladies in full war-paint in\nattendance.\"\n\n\"Shall we cut that too?\" suggested Mabel.\n\n\"Sure.  Feisul did!  He's not that kind of moth.  Ever since then the\nFrench have declared he's a hypocrite;  and because he won't yield his\nrights they've been busy inventing wrongs of their own and insisting on\nimmediate adjustment.  The French haven't left one stone unturned that\ncould irritate Feisul into making a false move.\"\n\n\"To hell with them!\" suggested Jeremy, reaching for more tea.\n\n\"But Feisul's not easy to irritate,\" Grim went on.  \"He's one of those\nrare men, who get born once in an epoch, who force you to believe that\nvirtue isn't extinct.  He's almost like a child in some things--like a\ngood woman in others--and a man of iron courage all the time, who can\nfire Arabs in the same way Saladin did five centuries ago.\"\n\n\"He looks like a saint,\" said Jeremy. \"I've seen him.\"\n\n\"But he's no soft liver,\" continued Grim.  \"He was brought up in the\ndesert among Bedouins, and has their stoical endurance with a sort of\nreligious patience added.  Gets that maybe from being a descendant of\nthe Prophet.\"\n\n\"Awful sort to have to fight, that kind are,\" said Jeremy.  \"They wear\nyou down!\"\n\n\"So the French decided some time ago to persuade Feisul's intimates to\nmake a bad break which he couldn't repudiate.\"\n\n\"Why don't he cut loose with forty or fifty thousand men and boot the\nFrench into the sea?\" demanded Jeremy.  \"I'll make one to help him!  I\nknew a Frenchman once, who--\"\n\n\"We'll come to that presently,\" said Grim.  \"I dare say you didn't hear\nof Verdun.\"\n\n\"Objection sustained.  Hand it to 'em.  They've got guts,\" grinned\nJeremy.  \"Fire away, old top.\"\n\n\"Well, they ran foul of an awkward predicament, which is that there are\nsome darned decent fellows among the officers of their army of\noccupation.  There's more than a scattering of decent gentlemen who\ndon't like dirt.  I won't say they tell Feisul secrets, or disobey\norders;  but if you want to give a man   a square deal there are ways of\ndoing it without sending him telegrams.\"\n\nMabel put the tea back on the kerosene stove to stew, with an extra\nhandful of black leaves in it.  Grim continued:\n\n\"Another thing:  The French are half afraid that if they take the field\nagainst Feisul on some trumped-up pretext, he'll get assistance from the\nBritish.  They could send him things he needs more than money, and can't\nget.  Ninety-nine per cent of the British are pro-Feisul.  Some of them\nwould risk their jobs to help him in a pinch.  The French have got to\nstall those men before they can attack Feisul safely.\"\n\n\"How d'you mean--stall 'em?\" demanded Jeremy.  \"Not all the British are\nfools--only their statesmen, and generals, and sixty percent of the\njunior officers and rank and file.  The rest don't have to be fed pap\nfrom a bottle;  they're good men.  Takes more than talk to stall that\nkind off a man they like.\"\n\n\"You've got the idea, Jeremy.  You have to show them.  Well, why not\nstir up revolution here in Palestine in Feisul's name?  Why not get the\nmalcontents to murder Jews wholesale, with propaganda blowing full blast\nto make it look as if Feisul's hand is directing it all?  It's as simple\nas falling off a log.  French agents who look like honest Arabs approach\nthe most hairbrained zealots who happen to be on the inside with Feisul,\nand suggest to them that the French and British are allies;  therefore\nthe only way to keep the British from helping the French will be to\nstart red-hot trouble in Palestine that will keep the British busy\nprotecting themselves and the Jews.\n\n\"The secret agents point out that although Feisul is against anything of\nthe sort, he must be committed to it for his own sake.  And they make\ngreat capital out of Feisul's promise that he will protect the Jews if\nrecognized as king of independent Syria.  Kill all the Jews beforehand,\nso there won't be any for him to protect when the time comes--that's the\nargument.\"\n\nMabel interrupted.\n\n\"Haven't you warned Feisul?\"\n\nShe had both elbows on the table and her chin between her hands, and I\ndare say she had listened in just that attitude to fifty inside stories\nthat the newspapers would scatter gold in vain to get.\n\n\"I sure did.  And he has sent one of his staff down here to keep an eye\non things.  I saw him this afternoon riding in a cab toward the Jaffa\nGate.  I said as much to that fellow in the hospital, and he was scared\nstiff at the idea of my recovering the supposed Feisul letter and\nshowing it to an officer who is really in Feisul's confidence.  That--I\nmean the man's fear--linked everything up.\"\n\n\"You talk like Sherlock Holmes,\" laughed Jeremy.  \"I'll bet you a new\nhat nothing comes of it.\"\n\n\"That bet's on,\" Grim answered.  \"It's to be a female hat, and Mabel\ngets it.  Order an expensive one from Paris, Mabel;  Jeremy shall pay.\nWe've lots of other information.  The troops here have been warned of an\nintended massacre of Jews.  The arrival of this letter probably puts a\ndate to it.\n\n\"But it puts a date to something else on which the whole future of the\nNear East hangs;  and that means the future of half the world, and maybe\nthe whole of it, because about three hundred million Mohammedans are\nwatching Feisul and will govern themselves accordingly.  India, Persia,\nMesopotamia, Egypt, all Northern Africa--there's almost no limit to what\ndepends on Feisul's safety;  and the French can't or won't understand\nthat.\"\n\nThere came the sound of heavy ammunition boots outside on the stone\nstep, followed by a cough that I believe I could recognize among a\nthousand.  Narayan Singh coughs either of two ways--once, deep bass, for\nall's well;  twice, almost falsetto, for a hint of danger.  This time it\nwas the single deep bass cough.  But it was followed after half a minute\nby the two high-pitched barks, and Grim held up a hand for silence.  At\nthe end of perhaps a minute there came from the veranda a perfect\nimitation of the lascar's ungrammatical, whining singsong from a\nfo'castle-head:\n\n\"Hum dekta hai!--I'm on the watch.\"\n\nGrim nodded--to himself, I suppose, for none had spoken to him.\n\n\"Do you mind stepping out and getting that letter from him, Ramsden?\nKeep in the shadow, please, and give him this pistol; he may need it.\"\n\nSo I slipped out through the screen door and spent a minute looking for\nNarayan Singh.  I'm an old hunter, but it wasn't until Narayan Singh\ndeliberately moved a hand to call attention to himself that I discovered\nhim within ten feet of me.\n\nThe risk of being seen from the street in case some spy were lurking out\nthere was obvious.  So I walked all the way round the house, and came\nand stood below him on his left hand where the house cast impenetrable\nshadow;  but though I took my time and moved stealthily he heard me and\npassed me a letter through the veranda rails, accepting the pistol in\nexchange without comment.\n\nI could see him distinctly from that angle.  His uniform on one side was\ntorn almost into rags, and his turban was all awry, as if he had lost it\nin a scuffle and hadn't spared time to rewind it properly--a sure sign\nof desperate haste;  for a male tiger in the spring-time is no more\ncareful of his whiskers than a Sikh is of the thirty yards of cloth he\nwinds around his head.\n\nAs he didn't speak or make any more movement than was necessary to pass\nme the letter and take the pistol, I returned the way I had come,\nentered by the back door, tossed the letter to Grim, and crept back\nagain to bear a hand in case of need.  Grim said nothing, but Jeremy\nfollowed me, and two minutes later the Australian and I were crouching\nin darkness below the veranda. This time I don't think Narayan Singh was\naware of friends at hand.\n\nHis eyes were fixed on the slightly lighter gap in a dark wall that was\nthe garden gate but looked more like a dim hole leading into a cave.\nThere being no other entrance that we knew of, Jeremy and I doubled up\non the same job, and a rat couldn't have come through without one of the\nthree of us detecting him.  If we had had our senses with us we might\nhave realized that Narayan Singh was perfectly capable of watching that\nsingle narrow space, and have used our own eyes to better advantage.\nHowever, we're all three alive today, and two of us learned a lesson.\n\n\nIt wasn't long--perhaps five minutes--before a man showed himself\noutside the gate, like a spectre dodging this and that way in response\nto unearthly impulse.  Once or twice he started forward, as if on the\npoint of sneaking in, but thought better of it and retreated.  Once his\nattitude suggested that he might be taking aim with a pistol;  but if\nthat was so, he chose not to waste a shot or start an alarm by firing at\na mark he couldn't see.  What he did accomplish was to keep six keen\neyes fixed on him.\n\nAnd that gave three other men their chance to gain an entrance at the\nrear of the wall in the garden, and creep up unawares.  It was probably\nsheer accident that led all three of them along the far side of the\nhouse, but it was fortunate for Jeremy and me, for otherwise cold steel\nbetween our shoulder-blades would likely have been our first intimation\nof their presence.\n\nWe never suspected their existence until they gained the veranda by the\nend opposite to where we waited;  and I think they would have done their\nmurder if the man outside the gate hadn't lost his head from excitement,\nor some similar emotion and tried to make a signal to them.  All three\nhad brought up against the end window, where a shade torn in two places\nprovided a good view into the room in which Grim, Mabel and the doctor\nwere still sitting.  Each of them had a pistol, and their intention\ndidn't admit of doubt.\n\n\"Are you there, sahib?\" Narayan Singh whispered.\n\nBut Jeremy and I were aware of them almost as soon as he, and rather\nthan make a noise by vaulting the veranda rail, we took the longer route\nby way of the front steps.  Jeremy, who was wearing sandals, kicked them\noff and not having to creep so carefully, moved faster.\n\nOf course, the obvious question is, why didn't Narayan Singh shoot?  I\nhad a pistol too;  why didn't I use it?  Well, I'll tell you.  None but\nthe irresponsible criminal shoots a man except in obedience to orders or\nin self-defence.\n\nYou may argue that those three night-prowlers might have shot Ticknor\nand his wife and Grim through the window while we aired our superior\nvirtue.  The answer to that is, that they didn't, although that was\ntheir intention.  Narayan Singh, already once that night in danger of\nhis life, and a \"godless, heathen Sikh,\" as I have heard a missionary\ncall him, pocketed the pistol I had given him before proceeding to\nengage, he being also a white man by the proper way of estimating such\nthings.\n\nJeremy was first on the scene of action, with Narayan Singh close behind\nhim, and I was quite a bit behind, for I tripped against the top step in\nmy hurry.  The noise I made gave the alarm, and the three Arabs twisted\nround like cornered scorpions.  I guess they couldn't see us well at\nfirst, having been staring through the torn shade into the lighted room.\n\nTheir pistols were cocked, but Jeremy's fist landed in the nearest man's\nface before he could shoot, and he went crashing backwards into his\nfriend behind, whose head disappeared for a moment through the\nwindow-pane, and the only blood shed on that occasion came from the\nfirst man's nose and the back of the second man's neck where the smashed\nglass slit a gash in it.\n\nThe third man fired wildly at me, and missed, a fraction of a second\nbefore Narayan Singh landed on him with hands and feet; whereat the man\nin the street emptied his pistol at me and ran away.  I was in two minds\nwhether to give chase to him, but made the wrong decision, being heavy\non my feet and none too fond of running, so the big fish got away.\n\nBut even with my help added, the three less important fish still gave a\nlot of trouble, for they fought like wild cats, using teeth and finger-\nnails;  and the doctor and his wife and Grim were all out lending a hand\nbefore we had them finally convinced that the game was up.  Mabel\ntrussed up the worst man with a clothes line, while I sat on him.\n\nI expected to see a crowd around the house by that time, but Jerusalem\nworks otherwise than some cities.  The sound of a pistol-shot sends\neverybody hurrying for cover, lest some enemy accuse them afterwards of\nhaving had a hand in the disturbance. And the nearest police post was a\nmile away.  So we had our little outrage all to ourselves, although\nstrange tales went the rounds of the Holy City that night, and two weeks\nlater several European newspapers printed a beautiful account of a\nmidnight massacre of Jews.\n\nWe dragged our prisoners into the sitting-room, and stood them up in\nfront of Grim after the doctor and Mabel had attended to their hurts,\nwhich weren't especially serious;  although nobody need expect to get in\nthe way of Jeremy's fist and feel comfortable for several hours\nafterwards.  The cut made in the second man's neck by broken glass\nneeded several stitches, but the third man was only winded from having\nbeen sat on, and of course he was much more sorry for himself than\neither of the other two--a fact that Grim noted.\n\nThere was another noticeable circumstance that shed light on human\nnature and Grim's knowledge of it.  They were all three eager to tell\ntheir story, although not necessarily the same story;  whereas Narayan\nSingh, who knew that every word he might say would be believed\nimplicitly, was in no hurry to tell his at all.\n\nNow when you're dealing with Eastern and near-Eastern people of the sort\nwho lie instinctively (and it may be that this applies to the West as\nwell) it's a good plan to establish, if you can, a basis of truth for\nthem to build their tale on;  because the truth acts like acid on\nuntruth.  They're going to lie in any case;  but lies told without any\nreference to truth knit better than when invented at a moment's notice\nto explain away another's straightforward statement.  There's a\nplausible theory that culprits taken in the act are best examined in\nsecret, one by one, in ignorance of all the evidence against them.\n\nThe wise method is to let them hear the evidence against themselves.\nNine times out of ten they will accept that as unanswerable, and strive\nto twist its meaning or smother it under a mass of lies.  But the truth\nthey have accepted, as I have said, works just like acid and destroys\ntheir argument almost as fast as they build it up.  In the few cases\nwhen that doesn't happen, they break down altogether and confess.\n\nAnyhow, Grim, who taught me what I have just written, refused to listen\nto their bleating until Narayan Singh first told in their hearing all\nthat he knew about the night's events.  They were forced to sit down on\nthe floor and listen to him like three coffee-shop loungers being told a\nstory;  and I don't doubt that the effect was strengthened by the Sikh's\nstanding facing them, for the contrast was as between jackals and a\nlion.\n\nNot that they were small men, for they weren't, or mere ten-dollar\nassassins picked up in the suk.  They looked well fed, and wore fine\nlinen, whereas Narayan Singh was in rags and had lost weight in our\nrecent desert marching, so that his cheek-bones stood out and he looked\nsuperficially much more like a man at bay than they did.\n\nBut their well-cared-for faces were lean in the wrong place, and puffy\nunder the eyes.  In place of courage they flaunted an insolent leer, and\nthe smile intended to convey self-confidence betrayed to a close\nobserver anxiety bordering on panic.\n\nThe most offensive part about them really was their feet, which are\nindices of character too often overlooked.  They had come to their task\nin slippers, which they had kicked off before reaching the veranda, and\ninstead of the firm, tough feet that a real man stands on, what they\ndisplayed as they squatted were subtle, soft things, not exactly flabby,\nbut even more suggestive of treachery than their thin beaks and shifty\neyes.\n\nTo sum them up, they were dandies, of the kind who join the Young Turk\nParty and believe the New Era can be distilled of talk and tricks;  and\nthey looked like mean animals compared to that staunch conservative\nNarayan Singh, who, nevertheless, is not without his own degree of\nsubtlety.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\"I call this awful!\"\n\n\nSahib, in accordance with instructions I proceeded to Christian Street\nto the place you spoke of, where I found Yussuf Dakmar drinking coffee\nand smoking in company with these men and others. They did not see me in\nthe beginning, because I entered by the door of a house threescore and\nfive paces farther down the street;  and having by that means gained the\nroof I descended to a gallery built of stone above one end of the\ncoffee-shop, and there lay concealed among evil-smelling bags.\n\n\"They conversed in Arabic;  and presently when other men had entered,\nsome of whose names I overheard and wrote down on this slip of paper,\nYussuf Dakmar locked the outer door, turning the great key twice and\nsetting a chain in place as well.  Then he stood on a red stool having\nfour short legs, with his back to the door that he had locked, and spoke\nin the manner of one who stirs a multitude, gesticulating greatly.\n\n\"The argument he made was thus:  He said that Jerusalem is a holy city,\nand Palestine a holy land;  and that promises are all the more sacred if\ngiven in connection with religious matters; whereat they all applauded\ngreatly.  Nevertheless, a little later on he mocked at all religion, and\nthey applauded that too.  He said that the Allies, persuaded thereto by\nthe British, had made a promise to the Emir Feisul on the strength of\nwhich the Arabs made common war with the Allies against the Turks and\nGermans, losing of their own a hundred thousand men and untold money.\n\n\"So, sahib.  Next he asked them how much of that promise made by the\nAllies to Emir Feisul as the leader of the Arabs had been kept, or was\nlikely to be kept;  and they answered in one voice, 'None of it!'\nWhereat he nodded, as a teacher nods gravely when the pupils have their\nlesson well by heart, and said presently in a voice like that of a Guru\ndenouncing sin:  'A woman's promise is a little matter;  who believes\nit?  When it is broken all men laugh.  A promise extorted under threat\nor torture is not binding, since he who made the promise was not free to\ngovern his own conduct;  that is law.  A promise made in business,' said\nhe, 'is a contract contingent on circumstances and subject to\nlitigation.  But a promise made in wartime by a nation is a pledge set\ndown in letters of blood.  Whoever breaks it is guilty of blood;  and\nwhoever fails to smite dead the breaker of that oath, commits treason\nagainst Allah!'\n\n\"They applauded that speech greatly, sahib, and when they grew silent he\nbade them look about and judge for themselves at whose door the breaking\nof that sacred promise really lay.  'Show me,' said he, 'one trace of\nArab government in all Palestine.  Who owns the land?' he asked them.\n'Arabs!' said they.  'Yet to whom has the country been given?' he\nshouted.  'To the Jews!' they answered;  and he grew silent for a while,\nlike a teacher whose class has only given half the answer to a question\nuntil presently one man growled out, 'To the sword with the Jews in the\nname of Allah!' and the others echoed that which satisfied him, for he\nsmiled, nevertheless not using those words himself.  And presently he\ncontinued:\n\n\"'We in this room are men of enlightenment.  We are satisfied to leave\npast and future to speculations of idle dreamers.  For us the present.\nSo we attach no value to the fact that Feisul is descended in a straight\nline from the founder of the Moslem faith;  for that is a superstition\nas foolish in its way as Christianity or any other creed.  But who is\nthere like Feisul who can unite all Arabs under one banner?'\n\n\"They answered, sahib, that Feisul is the only living man who can\naccomplish that, making many assertions in his praise, Yussuf Dakmar\nnodding approval as each spoke. 'Yet,' said he when they had finished,\n'Feisul is also fallible.  In certain ways he is a fool, and principally\nin this:  That he insists on keeping his own promises to men who have\nbroken their own promises to him.' And like pupils in a class who recite\ntheir lesson, they all murmured that such a course as that is madness.\n\n\"'So,' said he, 'we are clear on that point.  We are not altruists, nor\nreligious fanatics, nor slaves, but men of common sense who have a\nbusiness in view.  We are not Feisul's servants, but he ours.  We make\nuse of him, not he of us.  If he persists in a wrong course, we must\nforce him into the right one, for the day of autocratic government is\npast and the hour has come when those who truly represent the people\nhave the first right to direct all policy.  If the right is still\nwithheld from them, they must take it.  And it is we in this room who\ntruly represent the Arab cause, on whom lies the responsibility of\nforcing Feisul's hand!'\n\n\"Well, sahib, these three prisoners who sit here offered, at once to go\nto Damascus and kill the men who are advising Feisul wrongly.  They said\nthat if they were given money they could easily hire Damascenes to do\nthe dagger work, there being, as the sahib doubtless knows, a common\nsaying in these parts about Damascus folk and sharp steel.  Whereat\nYussuf Dakmar suddenly assumed a sneering tone of voice, saying that he\npreferred men for his part with spunk enough to do such work themselves,\nand there was an argument, they protesting and he mocking them, until at\nlast this man, whose neck the glass cut, demanded of him whether he,\nYussuf Dakmar, was not in truth an empty boaster who would flinch at\nbloodshed.\n\n\"He seemed to have been waiting for just that, sahib, for he smirked and\nthrew a chest.  'I am a man,' said he, 'of example as well as precept.\nI have done what I saw fit to do!  I make no boasts,' said he, 'for a\nman who talks about himself sets others talking, and there are deeds\ncreditable to the doer that are best not spoken of.  But I will tell you\nother things, and you   may draw your own conclusions.\n\n\"'Because Feisul refuses to attack the French, having promised those\npromise-breakers that he will not;  and because Feisul has promised to\nprotect the Jews and is likely to try to keep that promise to the\npromise-breaking English, certain of his intimates in Damascus, in whose\nconfidence I am, have determined to force both issues, taking steps in\nhis name that will commit him finally.  Feisul's army of fifty thousand\nmen is as ready as it will ever be.  There is no money in the Damascus\ntreasury, and therefore every moment of delay is now a moment lost.  The\ntime has come for action!'\"\n\nOur three prisoners were listening to the recitation spellbound, and so\nwere we all for that matter.  The mere memory feat was amazing enough.\nFew men could listen in hiding to a stranger's words, and report them\nexactly after an interval of more than an hour;  but Narayan Singh did\nbetter than that, for he reproduced the speaker's gesture and inflexion,\nso that we had a mental picture of the scene that he described.  Mabel\noffered him stewed tannic acid in the name of tea, and Ticknor suggested\na chair, but he waved both offers aside and continued as if the picture\nbefore his mind and the words he was remembering might escape him if he\ntook things easy.\n\n\"Sahib, they were very much excited when he spoke of action. First one\nman and then another stood up and boasted of having made all things\nready;  how this one had supervised the hiding of sharp swords;  how\nanother had kept men at work collecting cartridges on battlefields;  how\nthis and that one had continued spreading talk against the Jews, so that\nthey swore that at least ten thousand Moslems in Jerusalem are fretting\nto begin a massacre.  'Let Feisul only strike the first blow from\nDamascus,' said they, 'and Palestine will run blood instantly!'\"\n\n\"And we sit here drinking tea,\" exclaimed Mabel, \"while up at\nheadquarters they're dancing and playing bridge!  I call this awful!  We\nall ought to be...\"\n\nGrim smiled and shook his head for silence.\n\n\"We've known all this for some time,\" he said. \"Don't worry. There'll be\nno massacre;  the troops are sleeping by their arms, and every possible\ncontingency has been provided for.  Go on, Narayan Singh.\"\n\n\"Well, sahib;  when they had done babbling and boasting this Yussuf\nDakmar got back on his stool and spoke sternly, as one who gives final\njudgment and intends to be obeyed.  'It is we who must make the first\nmove,' said he;  'and we shall force Feisul to move after us by moving\nin his name.'  Whereat this man here, whose nose was broken on the fist\nof Jeremy sahib, said that a letter bearing Feisul's seal would make the\nmatter easier.  'For the men,' said he, 'who are to slit Jews' throats\nwill ask first for proof of our authority to bid them begin the\nbusiness.'\n\n\"And at that speech Yussuf Dakmar laughed with great delight. 'Better\nlate than never!' said he.  'Better to think of a wise precaution now\nthan not at all!  But oh, ye are an empty-headed crew!' he told them.\n'I pity the conspiracy that had no better planning than ye would make\nfor it without my fore thought!  I thought of this long ago!  I sent a\nmessage to Damascus, begging that a date be set and just such a letter\nsent to us.  Feisul, I knew, would sign no such letter;  but the paper\nhe uses lies on an open desk, and there are men about him who have\naccess to his seal.  And because my appeal was well-timed it met with\napproval. A letter such as I asked for was written on Feisul's paper,\nsealed with his seal, and sent!'\n\n\"'But does it bear his signature?' a man asked.\n\n\"'How could it, since he never saw the letter?' Yussuf Dakmar answered.\n\n\"'Then few will pay heed to it,' said the other.\n\n\"'Perhaps if we were all such fools as you that might be so,' Yussuf\nDakmar retorted.  'However, fortunately the rest of us have readier\nwits!  This letter is signed with a number, and the number is that of\nFeisul's generation in descent from the Prophet Mohammed.  Let men be\ntold that this is his secret signature, and when they see his seal\nbeside it, will they not believe?  Every hour in Jerusalem, and in all\nthe world, men believe things less credible than that!'\n\n\"But at that, sahib, another man asked him how they might know that the\nletter really came from Damascus.  'It well might be,' said that one, 'a\nforgery contrived by Yussuf Dakmar himself, in which case though they\nmight stir many Moslems into action by showing it, the men in Damascus\nwould fail to follow up the massacre by striking at the French.  And if\nthey do not strike at the French,' said he, 'the French will not appeal\nto the British for aid;  and so the British troops will be free to\nprotect the Jews and butcher us, by which means we shall be worse off\nthan before.'\n\n\"Whereat Yussuf Dakmar laughed again.  'If ye will go to the Sikh\nhospital,' said he, 'ye will find there the man who brought the letter.\nHe lies in a cot in the upper storey with a knife-wound between his\nshoulder-blades.  It was a mistaken accident unfortunate for him;  the\nletter was intended for me, but I did not know that.  What does the life\nof one fool matter?  He gave out that Jews stabbed him, and it may be he\nbelieves that;  yet I have the letter in my pocket here!'  And he\ntouched with one hand the portion of his coat beneath which was the\npocket that contained the letter.  I was watching, sahib, from where I\nlay hidden.\n\n\"He was about, I think, to show them the letter, when another thought\noccurred to him.  He wrinkled his brow, as if seeking words in which to\nmake his meaning clear, and they seemed willing enough to wait for him,\nbut not so I, for I now knew where the letter was.  So I sprang into\ntheir midst, falling less dangerously than I might have done by reason\nof a man's shoulders that served for a cushion.  It may be that his\nbones broke under my weight.  I can give no accurate report as to that,\nfor I was in great haste.  But as he gave way under me, I pitched\nforward, and, kicking Yussuf Dakmar in the belly with my boot, I fell on\nhim, they falling on me in turn and we all writhing together in one mass\non the floor.  So I secured the letter.\"\n\n\"Good man!\" Grim nodded.\n\n\"Wish I'd been there!\" mourned Jeremy.\n\n\"And, having what I came for, I broke free;  and taking the red stool I\nhurled it at the lamp, so that we were in total darkness, which made it\na simple matter to unlock the door, and proceed about my business.\nNevertheless, I heard them strike matches behind me, and it seemed\nunwise to take to my heels at once, it being easy to pursue a man who\nruns.\n\n\"As the sahib doubtless remembers, between that coffee shop and the next\nhouse is a stone buttress jutting out into the street, forming on its\nside farthest from the coffee-shop a dark corner, for whose filth and\nstink the street cleaners ought to be punished.  Therein I lurked, while\nthose who pursued ran past me up the street, I counting them;  and among\nthem I did not count Yussuf Dakmar and three more.  It happened that a\nman was running up the street and the pursuers supposed him to be me.\nSo I was left with only four to deal with;  and it entered my head that\nno doubt Jimgrim sahib would be pleased to interview Yussuf Dakmar.\n\n\"And after a few moments Yussuf Dakmar came forth, and I heard him speak\nto these three fellows.\n\n\"'Those fools,' said he, 'hunt like street dogs at the sound of rubbish\ntossed out of a window.  But I think that Indian soldier is less foolish\nthan they.  If I were he,' said Yussuf Dakmar, 'I think I wouldn't run\nfar, with all these shadows to right and left and all the hours from now\nuntil dawn in which to act the fox.  I suspect he is not far away at\nthis minute.  Nevertheless,' said he, 'those Indians are dangerous\nfellows.  It is highly important that we get that letter from him;  but\nit is almost equally important that we stop his mouth, which would be\nimpossible if he should escape alive.  If we wait here,' said he, 'we\nshall see him emerge from a shadow, if I am not much mistaken.'\n\n\"So they waited, sahib.  And after a few minutes, when my breath had\nreturned to me, I let him have credit as a wise one by emerging as he\nhad said.  And those four stalked me through the streets, not daring to\ncome close until I should lead them to a lonely place;  and I led them\nwith discretion to this house, where happened what the sahib knows.\n\n\"That is all I know about this matter, except that being absent from\nduty on sick-leave there may be difficulty in the matter of my tunic,\nwhich is badly torn.\"\n\nHaving finished his story Narayan Singh stood at attention like one of\nthose wooden images they used to keep on the sidewalk outside tobacco\nstores.\n\nGrim smiled at the prisoners and asked whether they had any remarks to\nmake--a totally lawless proceeding, for he did not caution them, and had\nno jurisdiction as a magistrate.  They were three men caught red-handed\nattempting murder and burglary, and entitled accordingly to protection\nthat the law doesn't always accord to honest men.  But, as I have said,\na true tale in the ears of criminals acts like a chemical reagent.  It\nsets them to work lying, and the lie burns off, disclosing naked truth\nagain. But, mother of me, they were daring liars!  The fellow who had\ncome out of the scrap more or less unscathed piped up for the three, the\nother two nodding and prompting him in whispers.\n\n\"What that Indian says in the main is true.  He did jump down from the\ngallery and surprise a meeting summoned by Yussuf Dakmar.  And it is\ntrue that Yussuf Dakmar's purpose is to bring about a massacre of Jews,\nwhich is to be simultaneous with an attack by Feisul's forces on the\nFrench in Syria.  But we three men are not in favour of it.  We have had\nno part in the preparations, although we know all details.  We are\nhonest men, who have the public interest at heart, and accordingly we\nhave spied on Yussuf Dakmar, purposing to expose all his plans to the\nauthorities.\"\n\nJeremy began humming to himself.  Mabel tittered, and little Doctor\nTicknor swore under his breath.  But Grim looked as if he believed them\n--looked pleasantly surprised--and nodded gravely.\n\n\"But that hardly explains your following this Indian through the streets\nand attacking him on the veranda,\" he suggested, as if sure they could\nexplain that too--as sure enough they did.\n\n\"We did not attack him.  He attacked us.  It was obvious to us from the\nfirst that he must be an agent of the Government.  So when Yussuf Dakmar\ntold us to follow and murder him we decided it was time to expose Yussuf\nDakmar, and that this was our opportunity.  We knew surely that this\nIndian would take that letter straight to some official of the\nGovernment;  it was only necessary to pretend to hunt him and in that\nmanner inveigle Yussuf Dakmar into the toils.\n\n\"But when we reached this house Yussuf Dakmar was afraid and refused to\napproach nearer than the street.  He insisted on keeping watch outside\nthe garden gate while we should draw near and shoot everyone who might\nbe in the house and recover the letter.  He is a coward, and we could\nnot persuade him.\n\n\"So we decided to pretend to do his bidding, and to whisper through the\nwindow to the people within to pass out to the street by some back way\nand capture him, after which we would give all our evidence to the\nauthorities.\n\n\"It was while we were looking through the window, seeking to call the\nattention of those within for that purpose and no other, that we were\nattacked and submitted to much unnecessary violence. That is the whole\ntruth, as Allah is our witness!  We are honest men, who seek to uphold\nthe law, and we claim the protection of the Government.  We are ready to\ntell all we know, including the names of those connected with this\nplot.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\"Nobody will know, no bouquets\"\n\n\nThere followed a tedious hour or two, during which Grim cross-examined\nthe three \"honest men,\" and took down lists of names from their\ndictation, getting Doctor Ticknor meanwhile to go for the police because\nYussuf Dakmar might still be lurking in the neighbourhood for a chance\nto murder Narayan Singh.  It was only after the police had carried off\nthe prisoners to jail (where they repudiated their entire confession\nnext morning) that Grim showed us the letter which, like a spark, had\nfired a powder magazine--although a smaller one than its writer\nintended.\n\n\"It isn't in Feisul's handwriting,\" he said, holding the feathery Arab\nscript up to the lamplight; \"and it's no more like his phraseology than\na camel resembles a locomotive.  Listen to this:\n\nTo the Pan-Arab Committee in Jerusalem, by favour of Yussuf Dakmar Bey\nits District President, Greeting in the name of God:\n\nYe know that on former occasions the foes of our land and race were\noverwhelmed when, relying on the aid of the Most High, and raising the\ngreen banner of the Prophet--on whom be peace--we launched our squadrons\nin a cause held sacred by us all.\n\nYe know that in that fashion, and not otherwise, the accursed conquerors\nwere driven forth and our sacred banner was set on high over the\nDamascus roofs, where by Allah's blessing may it wave for ever!\n\nYe know how those who claimed to be our friends have since proven\nthemselves foes, so that the independent state for which we fought is\nheld today in ignominious subjection by aliens, who deny the true Faith\nand hold their promises as nothing.\n\nYe know how Damascus is beset by the French, and Palestine is held by\nthe British who, notwithstanding the oath they swore to us, are daily\nbetraying us Arabs to the Jews.\n\nKnow now, then, that the hour has struck when, again in the name of\nAllah, we must finish what we formerly began and with our true swords\nforce these infidels to yield our country to us.  Nor on this occasion\nshall we sheathe our swords until from end to end our land is free and\nunited under one government of our own choosing.\n\nKnow that this time there shall be no half-measures nor any compromise.\nIt is written, Ye shall show no quarter to the infidel.  Let no Jew live\nto boast that he has footing in the land of our ancestors.  Leave ye no\nroot of them in the earth nor seedling that can spring into a tree!\nSmite, and smite swiftly in the name of Him who never sleeps, who keeps\nall promises, whose almighty hand is ready to preserve the Faithful.\n\nWhereunto ye are bidden to take courage.  Whereunto our army of Syria\nstands ready.  Whereunto the day has been appointed.\n\nKnow ye that the tenth day from the sending of this letter, and at dawn,\nis the appointed time.  Therefore let all make common cause for the\nfavour of the Most High which awaits the Faithful.\n\nIn the name of God and Mohammed the Prophet of God, on whom be\nblessings.\"\n\n\nThere followed the Moslem date and the numerical signature over Feisul's\nindubitable seal.  Grim figured a moment and worked out the\ncorresponding date according to our western calendar.\n\n\"Leaves six days,\" he said pleasantly.  \"It means the French intend to\nattack Damascus seven days from now.\"\n\n\"Let 'em!\" Jeremy exploded.  \"Feisul'll give 'em ----!  All they've got\nare Algerians.\"\n\n\"The French have poison gas,\" Grim answered dourly.  \"Feisul's men have\nno masks.\"\n\n\"Get 'em some!\"\n\nThat was Jeremy again.  Grim didn't answer, but went on talking:\n\n\"They're going to get Damascus.  All they've waited for was poison gas,\nand now there's no stopping 'em.  They forged this letter after the gas\narrived.  Now if they catch Feisul in Damascus they'll put him on trial\nfor his life, and they probably hope to get this letter back somehow to\nuse as evidence against him.\"\n\n\"Go slow, Jim!\" Mabel objected.  \"Where's your proof that the French are\njockeying this?  Isn't that Feisul's seal?\"\n\n\"Yes, and it's his paper.  But not his handwriting.\"\n\n\"He might have dictated it, mightn't he?\"\n\n\"Never in those words.  Feisul don't talk or write that way.  The\nletter's a manifest forgery, as I'll prove by confronting Feisul with\nit.  But there's a little oversight that should convince you it's a\nforgery.  Have you a magnifying glass, doc?\"\n\nTicknor produced one in a minute, and Grim held the letter under the\nlamp.  On the rather wide margin, carefully rubbed out, but not so\ncarefully that the indentation did not show, was the French word\nmagnifique that had been written with a rather heavy hand and one of\nthose hard pencils supplied to colonial governments by exporters from\nstocks that can't be sold at home.\n\n\"That proves nothing,\" Mabel insisted. \"All educated Arabs talk French.\nSomebody on Feisul's staff was asked for an opinion on the letter before\nit went.  My husband's Arab orderly told me only yesterday that a sling\nI made for a man in the hospital was magnifique.\"\n\nThe objection was well enough taken, because it was the sort the forger\nof the letter would be likely to raise if brought to book. But Grim's\nargument was not exhausted.\n\n\"There are other points, Mabel.  For one thing, it's blue metallic ink.\nFeisul's private letters are all written with indelible black stuff made\nfrom pellets that I gave him;  they're imported from the States.\"\n\n\"But if Feisul wanted to prove an alibi, he naturally wouldn't use his\nspecial private ink,\" objected Mabel.\n\n\"Then why his seal, and his special private notepaper?  However, there's\nanother point.  Feisul writes the purest kind of Arabic, and this isn't\nthat sort of Arabic.  It was written by a foreigner--perhaps a\nFrenchman--possibly an Armenian--most likely a Turk--certainly one of\nthe outer ring of politicians who have access to Feisul and seek to\ncontrol him, but are not really in his confidence.  Damascus is simply a\nnetwork of spies of that kind--men who attached themselves to the Arab\ncause when it looked like winning and are now busy transferring their\nallegiance.\n\n\"I think I could name the man who wrote this;  I think I know the man\nwho wrote that magnifique.  If I'm right, Yussuf Dakmar will notify the\nFrench tonight through their agents in Jerusalem.  The man who wrote\nthat magnifique will know before morning that the letter's missing;  and\nit doesn't matter how careful I may be, it'll be known as soon as I\nstart for Damascus.\n\n\"They'll dope out that our obvious course would be to confront Feisul\nwith this letter.  The only way to travel is by train; the roads are\nrotten--in fact, no auto could get through;  they'd tip off the\nBedouins, who'd murder everybody.\n\n\"So they'll watch the trains and especially Haifa, where everyone going\nnorth has to spend the night;  and they'll stop at nothing to get the\nletter back, for two reasons;  as long as it's in our hands it can be\nused to establish proof of the plot against Feisul;  once it's back in\ntheirs, they can keep it in their secret dossier to use against Feisul\nif they ever catch him and bring him to trial.  You remember the Dreyfus\ncase?\n\n\"I shall start for Damascus by the early train--probably take an auto as\nfar as Ludd.  If I want to live until I reach Damascus I shall have to\nprove conclusively that I haven't that letter with me.  Anyone known to\nbe in British service is going to be suspected and, if not murdered,\nrobbed.  Ramsden has been seen about too much with me.  Jeremy might\njuggle by but he's already notorious, and these people are shrewd.\nBetter hold Jeremy in reserve, and the same with Narayan Singh.  A\nwoman's best.  How about you, Mabel?\"\n\n\"What d'you mean, Jim?\"\n\n\"Do you know a woman in Haifa?\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\"\n\n\"Well enough to expect a bed for the night at a moment's notice?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nMabel's eyes were growing very bright indeed.  It was her husband who\nlooked alarmed.\n\n\"Well, now, here's the point.\"\n\nGrim leaned back in his chair and lit a cigarette, not looking at\nanybody, stating his case impersonally, as it were, which is much the\nshrewdest way of being personal.\n\n\"Feisul's up against it, and he's the best man in all this land, bar\nnone.  They've dealt to him from a cold deck, and he's bound to lose\nthis hand whichever way he plays it.  To put it differently, he's in\ncheck, but not checkmated.  He'll be checkmated, though, if the French\never lay hands on him, and then good-bye to the Arab's chance for twenty\nyears.\n\n\"I propose to save him for another effort, and the only way to do that\nis to convince him.  The best way to convince him is to show him that\nletter, which can't be done if Feisul's enemies discover who carries it.\nIf Ramsden, Jeremy, Narayan Singh and I start for Damascus, pretending\nthat one or other of us has the letter concealed on his person, and if a\nwoman really carries it, we'll manage.  Is Mabel Ticknor going to be the\nwoman?  That's the point.\"\n\n\"Too dangerous, Jim!  Too dangerous!\"  Ticknor put in nervously.\n\n\"Pardon me, old man.  The danger is for us four, who pretend we've got\nthe thing.\"\n\n\"There are lots of other women and I've only got one wife!\" objected\nTicknor.\n\n\"We're pressed for time,\" Grim answered.  \"You see, Ticknor, old man,\nyou're a Cornstalk and therefore an outsider--just a medico, who saws\nbones for a living, satisfied to keep your body out of the poorhouse,\nyour soul out of hell, and your name out of the newspapers.  Your wife\nis presumably more so.  There are several officials' wives who would\njump at the chance to be useful;  but a sudden trip toward Damascus just\nnow would cause any one of them to be suspected, whereas Mabel wouldn't\nbe.\"\n\n\"I don't know why not!\" Ticknor retorted.  \"Wasn't she in here when\nthose three murderers came to finish the lot of us?  If Yussuf Dakmar\nmakes any report at all he'll surely say he traced the letter to this\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Yussuf Dakmar came no nearer than the street,\" Grim answered. \"He has\nno notion who is in here.  His three friends are in jail under lock and\nkey, where he can't get at them.  How long have you had this house?\nSince yesterday, isn't it?  D'you kid yourself that Yussuf Dakmar knows\nwho lives here?\"\n\n\"I can get leave of absence.  Suppose I go in Mabel's place?\" suggested\nTicknor, visibly worried.\n\n\"The mere fact that she goes, while you stay here, will be presumptive\nevidence that she isn't on a dangerous mission,\" Grim answered.  \"No. It\nhas got to be a woman.  If Mabel won't go I'll find someone else.\"\n\nYou could tell by Mabel's eyes and attitude that she was what the\nsalesmen call \"sold\" already;  but you didn't need a magnifying glass to\ndetect that Ticknor wasn't.  Men of his wandering habit know too well\nwhat a brave, good-tempered wife means to encourage her to take long\nchances;  for although there are lots of women who would like to wander\nand accept the world's pot luck, there are precious few capable of doing\nit without doubling a fellow's trouble;  when they know how to halve the\ntrouble and double the fun they're priceless.\n\nGrim played his usual game, which is to spank down his ace of trumps\nface upward on the table.  Most of us forget what are trumps in a\ncrisis.\n\n\"I guess it's up to you, doc,\" he said, turning toward Ticknor. \"There's\nnothing in it for you.  Feisul isn't on the make;  I don't believe he\ncares ten cents who is to be the nominal ruler of the Arabs, provided\nthey get their promised independence. He'd rather retire and live\nprivately.  But he only considers himself in so far as he can serve the\nArab cause.  Now, you've risked Mabel's life a score of times in order\nto help sick men in mining camps, and malaria victims and Lord knows\nwhat else. Here's a chance to do the biggest thing of all--\"\n\n\"Of course, if you put it that way...\" said Ticknor, hesitating.\n\n\"Just your style too.  Nobody will know.  No bouquets.  You won't have\nto stammer a speech at any dinner given in your honor.\"\n\n\n\"D'you want to do it, Mabel?\" asked Ticknor, looking at her keenly\nacross the table.\n\n\"Of course I do!\"\n\n\"All right, girl.  Only, hurry back.\"\n\nHe looked hard at Grim again, then into my eyes and then Jeremy's.\n\n\"She's in your hands.  I don't want to see any of you three chaps alive\nagain unless she comes back safe.  Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Clear and clean!\" exploded Jeremy.  \"It's a bet, doc.  Half a mo', you\nchaps;  that's my mine at Abu Kem, isn't it?  I've agreed to give the\nthing to Feisul and make what terms I can with him.  Jim and Rammy divvy\nup with me on my end, if any.  That right?  I say;  let the doc and\nMabel have a half-share each of anything our end amounts to.\"\n\nWell, it took about as long to settle that business as you'd expect.\nThe doctor and Mabel protested, but it's easier to give away a fortune\nthat is still in prospect than a small sum that is really tangible--I\nmean between folk who stand on their own feet. It doesn't seem to\ndeprive the giver of much, or to strain the pride of the recipient\nunduly.\n\nI've been given shares in unproven El Doradoes times out of number, and\ncould paper the wall of, say, a good-sized bathroom with the stock\ncertificates--may do it some day if I ever settle down.  But the only\ngift of that sort that I ever knew to pay dividends, except to the\nprinter of the gilt-edged scrip, is Jeremy's gold mine;  and you'll look\nin vain for any mention of that in the stock exchange lists.  The time\nto get in on that good thing was that night by Mabel Ticknor's teapot in\nJerusalem.\n\nIt was nearly midnight before we had everything settled, and there was\nstill a lot to do before we could catch the morning train.  One thing\nthat Grim did was to take gum and paper and contrive an envelope that\nlooked in the dark sufficiently like the alleged Feisul letter;  and he\ncarried that in his hand as he took to the street, with Narayan Singh\nfollowing among the shadows within hail.  Jeremy and I kept Narayan\nSingh in sight, for it was possible that Yussuf Dakmar had gathered a\ngang to waylay whoever might emerge from the house.\n\nBut he seemed to have had enough of bungling accomplices that night.\nGrim hadn't gone fifty paces, keeping well in the middle of the road,\nwhen a solitary shadow began stalking him, and doing it so cautiously\nthat though he had to cross the circles of street lamplight now and then\nneither Jeremy nor I could have identified him afterward.\n\nNarayan Singh had orders not to do anything but guard Grim against\nassault, for Grim judged it wise to leave Yussuf Dakmar at large than to\nprecipitate a climax by arresting him.  He had the names of most of the\nlocal conspirators, and if the leader were seized too soon the equally\ndangerous rank and file might scatter and escape.\n\nDown inside the Jaffa Gate, in a dark alley beside the Grand Hotel,\nthere are usually two or three cabs standing at any hour of the night\nready to care for belated Christian gentlemen who have looked on the\nwine when it was any colour that it chanced to be.  There were three\nthere, and Grim took the first one, flourishing his envelope carelessly\nunder the corner lamp.\n\nYussuf Dakmar took the next in line, and ordered the driver to follow\nGrim.  So we naturally took the last one, all three of us crowding on to\nthe rear seat in order to watch the cabs in front. But as soon as we had\ndriven back outside the city gate Yussuf Dakmar looked behind him and,\ngrowing suspicious of us, ordered his driver to let us pass.\n\nIt would have been too obvious if we had stopped too, so we hid our\nfaces as we passed, and then put Jeremy on the front seat, he looking\nlike an Arab and being most unrecognizable.  Yussuf Dakmar followed us\nat long range, and as the lean horses toiled slowly up the Mount of\nOlives to headquarters the interval between the cabs grew greater.  By\nthe time we reached the guard-house and answered the Sikh sentry's\nchallenge there was no sign of Grim in front, and we could only hear in\nthe distance behind us the occasional click of a loose shoe to tell that\nYussuf Dakmar was still following.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\"Better the evil that we know...\"\n\n\nYussuf Dakmar had his nerve with him that night, or possibly desperation\nrobbed him of discretion.  He may have been a more than usually daring\nman with his wits about him, but you'd have to hunt down the valley of\ndeath before you could bring the psychoanalytic guns to bear on him for\nwhat they're worth.  I can only tell you what he did, not why he did it.\n\nThe great hospice that the German nation built on the crown of the Mount\nof Olives to glorify their Kaiser stood like a shadow among shadows in\nits compound, surrounded by a fairly high wall. There was a pretty\nstrong guard under an Indian officer in the guard-house at the arched\nmain gate where the sentry challenged us.\n\nA sentry stood at the foot of the steps under the portico at the main\nentrance, and there was another armed man on duty patrolling the\ngrounds.  But there were one or two other entrances, locked, though\nquite easy to negotiate, which the sentry could only observe while he\nmarched toward them;  for five minutes at a time, while his back was\nturned, at least two gates leading to official residences offered\nopportunity to an active man.\n\nOne lone light at a window on the top floor suggested that the officer\nof the night might be awake, but what with the screeching of owls and a\nwind that sighed among the shrubs,  headquarters looked and sounded more\nlike a deserted ancient castle than the cranium and brain-cells of\nAdministration.\n\nWe heard Yussuf Dakmar stop his cab two hundred yards away.  The cabman\nturned his horses and drove back toward Jerusalem without calling on\nAllah to witness that his fare should have been twice what he received;\nhe didn't even lash the horses savagely;  so we supposed that he hadn't\nbeen paid, and went on to deduce from that that Yussuf Dakmar had driven\naway again, after satisfying himself that the Feisul letter had reached\nheadquarters.  It was lazy, bad reasoning--the sort of superficial,\nsmart stuff that has cost the lives of thousands of good men times out\nof number--four o'clock o' the morning intelligence that, like the\ncourage of that hour, needs priming by the foreman, or the\nsergeant-major, or the bosun as the case may be.\n\nThe sentry turned out the guard, who let us through the gate after a\nword with Narayan Singh;  and the man who leaned on his bayonet under\nthe portico at the end of the drive admitted us without any argument at\nall.\n\nI suppose he thought that having come that far we must be people in\nauthority.  Ever since then I have believed all the stories told me\nabout spies who walked where they chose unchallenged during wartime;\nfor we three--a Sikh enlisted man, an Australian disguised as an Arab,\nand an American in civilian clothes--entered unannounced and unwatched\nthe building where every secret of the Near East was pigeonholed.\n\nWe walked about the corridors and up and downstairs for ten minutes,\nlooking in vain for Grim.  Here and there a servant snored on a mat in a\ncorner, and once a big dog came and sniffed at us without making any\nfurther comment.  Jeremy kicked one man awake, who, mistaking him for an\nArab, cursed him in three languages, in the name of three separate gods,\nand promptly went to sleep again.  The sensation was like being turned\nloose in the strong-room of a national treasury with nobody watching if\nyou should choose to help yourself.  There are acres of floor in that\nbuilding.  We walked twice the whole circuit of the upper and lower\ncorridors, knocking on dozens of doors but getting no answer and finally\nbrought up in the entrance hall.\n\nThen it occurred to me that Grim might have gone into the building by\nsome private entrance, perhaps round on the eastern side, so we set out\nto look for one.\n\nWe had just reached the northwest angle of the building, when Narayan\nSingh, who was walking a pace in front, stopped suddenly and held up\nboth hands for silence.  Whoever he could see among the shadows must\nhave heard us, but it was no rare thing for officers to come roistering\ndown those front steps and along the drive hours after midnight, and our\nsudden silence was more likely to give alarm than the noise had been.  I\nbegan talking again in a normal voice, saying anything at all, peering\nabout into the shadows meanwhile.  But it was several seconds before I\nmade out what the Sikh's keener eyes had detected instantly, and Jeremy\nsaw it before I did.\n\nThere was a magnolia shrub about ten paces away from us, casting a\nshadow so deep that the ground it covered looked like a bottomless\nabyss.  But nevertheless, something bright moved in it--perhaps the\nsheen of that lone light in an upper window reflected on a knife-hilt or\na button--something that moved in time to a man's breathing.\n\nIf there was a certainty in the world it was that somebody who had no\nright to be there was lurking in that shadow, and he was presumably up\nto mischief.  On the other hand, I had absolutely no right in that place\neither.  Jeremy and Narayan Singh, being both in the British Army, were\nliable to be disciplined, and I might be requested to leave the country,\nif we should happen to blunder and tree the wrong 'possum, revenge being\nmore than usually sweet to the official disturbed in the pursuit of\nunauthorized \"diplomacy.\"  It might even be some clandestine love\naffair.\n\nSo I took each of my companions by the arm, gripping Jeremy's\nparticularly tightly, and started forward, whispering an explanation\nafter we had turned the corner of the building.  \"Let one of us go and\nwarn the guard,\" I suggested.  \"If we should draw that cover and start a\nshindy, we're more likely to get shot by the guard than thanked.\"\n\nSo Narayan Singh started off for the guard-house, he being the one most\ncapable of explaining matters to the Sikh officer, and Jeremy and I\ncrept back through the shadows to within earshot of the dark magnolia\ntree, choosing a point from which we could see if anybody bolted.\n\nYou know how some uncatalogued sense informs you in the dark of the\nmovement of the man beside you?  I looked suddenly sideways toward\nJeremy, knowing, although I couldn't see him, that his eyes were seeking\nmine.  It is only the animals who omit in the darkness those instinctive\ndaylight movements;  men don't have sufficient control of themselves.\nWe had both heard Grim's voice at the same instant, speaking Arabic but\nunmistakable.\n\nThere were three men there.  Grim was talking to the other two.\n\n\"Keep your hands on each other's shoulders!  Don't move!  I'm going to\nsearch all your pockets again.  Now, Mr. Charkian.  Ah! That feels like\nquite a pretty little weapon;  mother o' pearl on the butt?  Have you a\npermit?  Never mind;  not having the weapon you won't need a permit,\nwill you?  And papers--Mashallah!  What a lot of documents;  they must\nbe highly important ones since you hide them under your shirt.  I expect\nyou planned to sell them, eh?  Too bad!  Too bad!\n\n\"You keep your hands on Mr. Charkian's shoulders, Yussuf Dakmar, or I'll\nhave to use violence!  I'm not sure, Mr. Charkian, that it wouldn't be\nkinder to society to send you to jail after all; you need a bath so\nbadly.  It seems a pity that a chief clerk to the Administration\nshouldn't have a chance to wash himself, doesn't it?  Well, I'll have to\nread these papers afterward--after we've usurped the prerogative of\nDestiny and mapped out a little of the future.  Now--are you both\nlistening?  Do you know who I am?\"\n\nThere was no answer.  \"You, Mr. Charkian?\"\n\n\"I think you are Major Grim.\"\n\n\"Ah!  You wish to flatter me, don't you?  Never mind;  let us pretend\nI'm Major Grim disguised as an Arab;  only, I'm afraid we must continue\nthe conversation in Arabic;  I might disillusion you if I tried to talk\nEnglish.  We'll say then that I'm Major Grim, disguised.  Let's see\nnow... What would he do in the circumstances?  Here's Yussuf Dakmar,\nwanted for murder in the city and known to be plotting a massacre, seen\nclimbing a wall when the sentry's back was turned, and caught in\nconference with Mr. Charkian, confidential clerk to the Administration.\nI'm sorry I didn't hear all that was said at your conference, for that\nmight have made it easier to guess what Major Grim would do.\"\n\n\"Don't play with us like a cat playing with a mouse!\" snarled somebody.\n\"Tell us what you want.  If you were Major Grim you'd have handed us\nover to those officers who passed just now. You're just as much\nirregular as we are.  Hurry up and make your bargain, or the guard may\ncome and arrest us all!\"\n\n\"Yes, hurry up!\" complained the other man.  \"I don't want to be caught\nhere;  and as for those papers you have taken, if we are caught I shall\nsay you stole them from the office--you and Yussuf Dakmar, and that I\nfollowed you to recover them, and you both attacked me!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Grim's voice pleasantly.  \"I'll let you go.  I think\nyou're dangerous.  You'd better be quick, because I think I hear the\nguard coming!\"\n\n\"Give me back the papers, then!\"\n\n\"Aha!  Will you wait and discuss them with the guard, or go at once?\"\n\nThe Armenian clerk didn't answer, but got up and slunk away.\n\n\"Why did you let that fool go?\" demanded Yussuf Dakmar.  \"Now he will\nawaken some officer and start hue and cry with a story that we robbed\nhim.  Listen!  There comes the guard!  We had better both run!\"\n\n\"Not so fast!\" Grim answered.\n\nAnd then he raised his voice perceptibly, as if he wished to be\noverheard:\n\n\"I think those men who passed just now were not officers at all. Perhaps\nthey were strangers.  It may be that one of them is confused, and is\nleading the guard in the wrong direction!\"\n\n\"Don't make so much noise then!\" retorted Yussuf Dakmar.  Jeremy, who\nthinks habitually about ten times as fast as I do, slipped away at once\ninto the shadows to find Narayan Singh and decoy the guard elsewhere.  I\ndidn't envy him the job, for Sikhs use cold steel first and argue\nafterward when on the qui vive in the dark. However, he accomplished his\npurpose.  Narayan Singh saved his life, and the guard arrested him on\ngeneral principles.  You could hear both Jeremy and Narayan Singh using\nGrim's name freely.  Yussuf Dakmar wasn't deaf.  He gave tongue:\n\n\"There!  Did you hear that?  They are speaking of Major Grim. You are a\nfool if you wait here any longer.  That fellow Grim is a devil, I tell\nyou.  If he finds us we are both lost!\"\n\n\"We have to be found first,\" Grim answered, and you could almost hear\nhim smile.\n\n\"Quick then!  What do you want?\" snapped Yussuf Dakmar.  Grim's answer\nwas the real surprise of the evening.  It bewildered me as much as it\nastonished Yussuf Dakmar.\n\n\"I want that letter that came from the Emir Feisul!\"\n\n\"I haven't got it!  I swear I haven't!\"\n\n\"I know that already, for I searched you.  Where is it?\"\n\n\"Ask Allah!  It was stolen by a Sikh, who delivered it to someone in a\nhouse near the military hospital, who in turn gave it to an Arab, who\nbrought it here.  I hoped that fellow Charkian might steal it back\nagain, but you have spoiled everything.  Charkian will turn against me\nnow to save himself.  What do you want with the letter?\"\n\n\"I must have it!\" Grim answered. \"The French agent--\"\n\n\"What--Sidi Said?  You know him?\"\n\n\"Surely.  He would pay me a thousand pounds for it.\"\n\n\"May Allah change his face!  He only offered me five hundred!\"\n\n\"You have seen him already, then?\" Grim asked.  \"I don't believe you!\nWhen did you see him?\"\n\n\"On the way up here.  He stopped my cab to speak to me at the foot of\nthe hill.\"\n\nI began to see the drift of Grim's purpose.  He had established the fact\nthat the French secret agent was already on the track of the letter, and\nthat in turn explained why he had not seized Yussuf Dakmar and put him\nin jail.  It was better to use the man, as the sequel proved.  And\nYussuf Dakmar walked straight into Grim's trap.\n\n\"What is your name?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Call me Omar,\" said Grim.\n\n\"A Turk, are you?  Well, Omar, let us help each other to get that\nletter, and divide the reward.  Sidi Said told me that the British are\nsure to confront Feisul with it, and to do it secretly if they can.\nThey will try to send it to Damascus.  Let us two find out who takes it,\nand waylay him.\"\n\n\"Why should I divide with you?\" demanded Grim, who is much too good an\nactor to pretend to agree without bargaining.\n\n\"Because otherwise you will not succeed.  I was afraid of you when you\nfirst surprised me with Charkian.  But now that I know you for a spy in\nthe pay of the French I am not afraid of you, even though you have my\nrevolver and dagger.  You dare not kill me, for I would shout for help\nand the guard would come.  You are in danger as much as I am.  So you\nmay either agree to work with me, sharing the reward, or you may work\nalone and have nothing for your pains;  for I shall bring accomplices to\nhelp me take the letter from you after you have stolen it!\"\n\nWell, I suppose that anyone with criminal intentions could submit\ngracefully to that much blackmail.  Besides, Grim was rather pressed for\ntime and couldn't afford to prolong the argument.\n\n\"I see you are a determined man,\" he answered.  \"Your demand is\nunreasonable, but I must agree to it.\"\n\n\"Then give me back my pistol!\"\n\n\"No.  I need it.  I lent mine this evening to another man, who has not\nyet returned it.  That was a piece of wood with which I held you up just\nnow.  You must get yourself another.\"\n\n\"They are hard to come by in Jerusalem.  Give me mine back.\"\n\n\"No.  I shall keep it to protect myself against you.\"\n\n\"Why?  You have no need to fear me if we work together.\"\n\n\"Because I intend to tell you what I know;  and I may find it convenient\nto shoot you if you betray the information.\"\n\n\"Oh!  Well, tell away.\"\n\n\"I have been cleverer than you,\" Grim announced blandly.  \"I knew who\nhad given the order to the Sikh to steal that letter from you, and I was\nconcealed in his house when the letter was brought to him.  I heard the\nconference that followed, so I know what is going to be done about it.\"\n\n\"Oh!  That was very smart.  Well, tell me.\"\n\n\"Three men are going to take the letter to Damascus, but I don't know\nwhich of them will have it on his person.  One is an Arab. One is an\nAmerican.  The third is that same Sikh who took the letter from you.\nThey will take the train from Ludd, and I have engaged myself as servant\nto the American.\"\n\n\"Now that was extremely clever of, you!\" said Yussuf Dakmar.\n\n\"Yes,\" Grim agreed.  \"But perhaps it will be as well to have an\naccomplice after all, and you will do as well as any.  If I steal the\nletter they may accuse me;  but if I can pass it to you, then I can\nsubmit to a search and oblige them to apologize.\"\n\n\"True!  True!  That will be excellent.\"\n\n\"So you had better take the morning train for Damascus,\" Grim continued.\n\"But understand:  If you bring others with you I shall suspect you of\nintending to play a trick on me.  In that event I shall shoot you with\nyour own pistol, and take my chance of escaping afterward.  In fact, you\nare a dead man, Yussuf Dakmar, the minute I suspect you of playing me\nfalse.\"\n\n\"The same to you likewise!\" Yussuf Dakmar answered fervently.\n\n\"Then we understand each other,\" said Grim.  \"The best thing you can do\nbetween now and train-time is to see the French agent again.\"\n\n\"What good will that do?  He is irritable--nervous;  he will only ask a\nthousand questions.\"\n\n\"Then your visit will do all the more good.  You can calm him. We don't\nwant a horde of fools interfering with us on the journey.  We want to\nwork quietly, and to share the reward between us.  Therefore, you should\ntell him that you are confident of getting the letter if he will only\nleave the business to you alone.  Give him every assurance, and explain\nto him that interference may mean failure.  Now, I have done much the\ngreater part so far;  let this be your share to balance the account\nbetween us;  you go to Sidi Said, the French agent, and make sure that\nhe doesn't hinder us by trying to help.\"\n\n\"Very well, I will do that.  And I shall meet you at the station in the\nmorning?\"\n\n\"No.  My party will go as far as Ludd by motor.  You will see us join\nthe train there.  Go now, while the guard is out of the way.\"\n\nI could not see, but I heard Yussuf Dakmar get up and go.  He had hardly\ntime to get out of earshot when Grim's voice broke the silence again:\n\n\"You there, Ramsden?\"\n\nInstead of answering I approached.\n\n\"Did you hear what was said?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.  Why didn't you arrest both the blackguards and have done with\nit?\"\n\n\"Better the evil that we know...\" he answered, with the familiar smile\nin his voice.  \"The important thing is to sidetrack the French agent,\nwho could put fifty ruffians on our trail instead of one.\"\n\n\"Why not send a provost-marshal's guard to the French agent, then?\"\n\n\"Can't do that.  France and Great Britain are allies.  Besides, they\nmight retaliate by spiflicating our agent in Damascus.  Wise folk who\nlive in glass-houses don't throw stones.  What I think has been\naccomplished is to reduce our probable risk down to Yussuf Dakmar, who's\na mean squib at best;  and I think we've drawn suspicion clear away from\nMabel Ticknor.  All that remains is for me to go to that room where you\nsee the light burning and discuss matters with the chief.\"\n\n\"If he's awake he's lonely!\" said I;  and I told Grim of our experience\ninside the building.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.  \"Governments are all like that.  They talk glibly of\nthe ship of state;  but a ship run in the same way would pile up or sink\nthe first night out.  You'd better go home and get an hour's sleep;\nI'll call you at seven.\"\n\n\"We'll take turns sleeping on the train,\" I answered.  \"Come first and\nrescue Jeremy.  I think the guard pinched him.  Say, did you intend one\nof us to go and decoy the guard away that time you raised your voice?\"\n\n\"Sure.  Recognized your voices--yours especially--when you passed, and\nheard you breathe as you crept back.  You nearly spoilt the game by\nturning out the guard, but you saved it again handsomely.\"\n\n\"It's a marvel those Sikhs didn't shoot Jeremy in the dark,\" I answered.\n\n\"You bet it is,\" said Grim.  \"I guess he's too useful to be allowed to\ndie just now.\"\n\nHe hung his head, thinking, as we walked side by side.  \"That was a\nclose shave--too close!  Well, as you say, let's go and rescue him.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\"You talk like a madman!\"\n\n\nGrim changed the plan a little at the last minute.  Mabel Ticknor left\nJerusalem by train, as agreed, but Narayan Singh was sent that way too,\nto keep an eye on her.  He being a Sikh, could sit in the corridor\nwithout exciting comment, and being dressed for the part of a more or\nless prosperous trader, he could travel first class without having to\nanswer questions or allay suspicion.\n\nGrim, Jeremy and I drove to Ludd in a hired auto, Grim and Jeremy both\nin Arab costume, and I trying to look like a tourist. Jeremy was\nsupposed to be a travelled Arab intent on guiding me about Damascus for\nthe usual consideration.\n\nThe platform was crowded, and we secured a compartment in the train\nwithout calling much attention to ourselves.  There were British\nofficers of all ranks, Egyptians, Jews, Greeks, refugee Armenians,\nMaltese, Kurds, a Turk or two, Circassians, men from as far off as\nBokhara, Turkomans, Indians of all sorts, a sprinkling of Bedouins\nlooking not quite so at home as in their native desert, and local Arabs\nby the score.  About half of them were in a panic, encouraged to it by\ntheir shrill women-folk, fighting in a swarm for tickets at one small\nwindow, where an insolent Levantine demonstrated his capacity for\nself-determination by making as many people as possible miss the train.\nI caught sight of Mabel Ticknor in the front compartment of our car, and\nGrim pointed out Yussuf Dakmar leaning through a window of the car\nbehind.  His face was fat, unwholesome, with small, cold eyes, an\nimmoral nose, and a small mouth with pouting lips.  The tarboosh he wore\ntilted at an angle heightened the general effect of arrogant\nself-esteem.  He was an illustration of the ancient mystery--how is it\nthat a man with such a face, and such insolence written all over him,\ncan become a leader of other men and persuade them to hatch the eggs of\ntreachery that he lays like a cuckoo in their nests?\n\nHe smirked at Grim suggestively as we went by, and Grim, of course,\nsmirked back, with a sidewise inclination of the head in my direction,\nwhereat Yussuf Dakmar withdrew himself, apparently satisfied.\n\n\"Now he'll waste a lot of time investigating you,\" said Grim in an\nundertone.  \"We'd better keep awake in turns, or he'll knife you.\"\n\n\"The toe of my boot to him!\" I retorted.  \"One clean kick might solve\nthis international affair!\"\n\n\"Steady!\" Grim answered.  \"We need him until after leaving Haifa. The\nFrench agent wired, and they'll have a gang at Haifa ready for us;  but\nYussuf Dakmar will warn them off if we keep him hoping.\"\n\nSo we settled down into our compartment after a glance to make sure that\nMabel was all right, and for about two minutes I imagined we were in for\na lazy journey.  Narayan Singh was on a camp-stool in the corridor,\nsnoozing with one eye open like a faithful sheep-dog.  It didn't seem\npossible for a creature like Yussuf Dakmar to make trouble for us, and I\nproposed that we should match coins for the first turn to go to sleep.\n\nWe had just pulled our coins out, and the engineer was backing the train\nin order to get her started, when Yussuf Dakmar arrived at our door,\ncarrying his belongings, and claimed a seat on the strength of a lie\nabout there being no room elsewhere.\n\nThere's something about a compartment on a train that makes whoever gets\nin first regard the rest of the world as intruders. Nobody would have\nbeen welcome, but we would have   preferred a pig to Yussuf Dakmar.\nJeremy, democrat of democrats, who had slept without complaining between\nthe legs of a dead horse on a rain-swept battlefield, with a lousy\nTurkish prisoner hugging him close to share the blanket, was up in arms\nat once.\n\n\"Imshi!\" he ordered bluntly.\n\nBut Yussuf Dakmar was delighted.  The reception convinced him, if\nanything were needed to do that, that one of us really was guarding the\nsecret letter;  and he was one of those hogs, anyhow, who glory in\nsnouting in where they are plainly not wanted.  He took the corner seat\nopposite Jeremy, tucked his legs up under him, produced a cigarette and\nsmiled offensively.  I'll concede this, though:  I think the smile was\nmeant to be ingratiating.\n\nHe pulled out a package wrapped in newspaper and began to eat before the\ntrain had run a mile.  And, you know, more men get killed because of how\nthey eat than by the stuff they devour.  If you don't believe that, try\nliving in camp for a week or two with a man who chews meat with his\nmouth open.  You'll feel the promptings of a murderer.  I know a\nscientist who swears that the real secret of the Cain and Abel story is\nthat Abel sucked his gums at mealtime.\n\n\"You ought to be buried up to the neck and fed with a shovel!\" Jeremy\ninformed him in blunt English after listening to the solo for a while.\n\n\"Aha!  That is the way they used to treat criminals in Persia,\" he\nanswered pleasantly, with his mouth full of goat's milk cheese.  \"Only\nthey put plaster of Paris in the hole, and when it rained the wretched\nman was squeezed until the blood came out of his mouth and eyes, and he\ndied in agony.  But how comes it that you speak to me in English?  If we\nare both Arabs, why not talk the mother tongue?\"\n\n\"My rump is my rump and the land is its rulers,\" Jeremy answered in\nArabic, quoting the rudest proverb he could think of on the spur of the\nmoment.\n\n\"Ah!  And who is its ruler?  Who is to be its ruler?\"\n\nYussuf Dakmar made a surreptitious face at Grim, and his little cold\neyes shone like a hungry pariah dog's.  It began to be interesting to\nwatch his opening gambit.\n\n\"I have heard tales,\" he went on, \"of a new ruler for this country.\nWhat do you think of Feisul's chance?\"\n\nAs he said that he eyed me sideways swiftly and keenly.  Grim sat back\nin his own corner and folded up his legs, watching the game contentedly.\nJeremy, intercepting Yussuf Dakmar's glance, put his own construction on\nit.  He is a long, lean man, but like the Fat Boy in Pickwick Papers he\nlikes to make your flesh creep, and humor, to have full zest for him,\nhas to be mischievous.\n\nSo he commenced by pulling out his weapons one by one.  The first was a\nrazor, which he sharpened, tested with his thumb suggestively, and then\nplaced in his sock, studying Yussuf Dakmar's throat for a minute or so\nafter that, as if expecting to have to use the razor on it presently.\n\nAs the effect of that wore off he pulled out a pistol.  It was one of\nthe kind that won't go off unless you pull the Hammer back, but Yussuf\nDakmar didn't know that, and if he had flesh and blood capable of\ncreeping it's a safe assertion that they crept. Jeremy acted as if he\ndidn't understand the weapon, and for fifteen minutes did more stunts\nwith it than a puppy can do with a ball of twine.  One of them that\ninterested Yussuf Dakmar awfully was to point the pistol straight ahead,\nhalf-cocked, and try to get the hammer down by slapping it with the palm\nof his hand.\n\nMost of our baggage was on the floor, but one fairly heavy valise was in\nthe rack over Yussuf Dakmar's head.  Jeremy got up to examine it when\nthe pistol had ceased to amuse him, and taking advantage of a jerk as\nthe train slowed down, contrived to drop it into the Syrian's lap;  who\nrather naturally swore;  whereat Jeremy took offence, and accused him of\nbeing a descendant of Hanna, son of Manna, who lived for a thousand and\none years and never enjoyed himself.\n\nIt was our turn to eat sandwiches after that, while Yussuf Dakmar\nrecovered from his disgruntlement.  But just before the meal was\nfinished Jeremy revived the game by asking suddenly in an awestruck\nwhisper where \"it\" was.  He slapped himself all over in a hurry, feeling\nfor hidden pockets, and then came over and pretended to search me.\nThere wasn't anything to do but fall in with his mood, so I resisted,\nsearched my own pockets reluctantly, and said that we might as well take\nthe next train back, since we had lost the important document.\n\nBefore we started we had put into a wallet the fake envelope that Grim\nhad carried in his hand the previous night, and had entrusted the wallet\nto Jeremy in order to have an alibi ready for Mabel in case of need.\nGrim took up the cudgels now and reminded me respectfully, as a servant\nshould when speaking to his master, that I had taken all proper\nprecautions and could not be blamed in any event.\n\n\"But I think it will be found,\" he said hopefully.  \"Inshallah, it is\nnot lost, but in the wallet in the pocket of that hare-brained friend of\nyours.\"\n\nSo Jeremy went back to his corner, searched for the wallet, found it\nafter pretty nearly, standing on his head to shake his clothes, examined\nit excitedly, and produced the fake envelope, flourishing it so\nviolently that nobody, even with eyes like a hawk's, could have\nidentified it with certainty.\n\nThen he dropped it in among the baggage on the floor, and went down on\nhis knees to pick it up again.  There is no more finished expert at\nsleight of hand than he, so it vanished, and he swore he couldn't find\nit.  In a well-simulated agony of nervousness he called on Yussuf Dakmar\nto get down and help him search, and the Syrian hadn't enough\nself-command left to pretend to hesitate; his cold eyes were nearly\npopping from his head as he knelt and groped.  The chief subject of\ninterest to me just then was how he proposed to retain the letter in the\nunlikely event of his finding it first.\n\nIt was a ridiculous search, because there wasn't really anywhere to\nlook.  After three bags had been lifted and their bottoms scrutinized\nthe whole floor of the compartment lay naked to the eye, except where my\nfeet rested.  Jeremy insisted on my raising them, to the accompaniment\nof what he considered suitable comment on their size, turning his\n\"behind end\" meanwhile toward Yussuf Dakmar.\n\nGrim chuckled and caught my eye.  Yussuf Dakmar had walked straight into\ntemptation, and was trying to search Jeremy's pockets from the rear--no\neasy matter, for he had to discover them first in the loose folds of the\nArab costume.\n\nSuddenly Jeremy's mood changed.  He became suspicious, stood up, resumed\nhis seat--and glared at Yussuf Dakmar, who retired into his corner and\ntried to seem unconscious of the game.\n\n\"I believe you are a thief--one of those light-fingered devils from\nEl-Kalil!\" said Jeremy suddenly, after about three minutes' silence.\n\"I believe you have stolen my letter!  Like the saint's ass, you are a\nclever devil, aren't you?  Nevertheless, you are like a man without\nfingernails, whose scratching does him no good!  Your labour was in\nvain.  Give me back the letter, or by Allah I will turn you upside\ndown!\"\n\nYussuf Dakmar denied the accusation with all the fervour that a\nblackguard generally does use when, for once, he is consciously\ninnocent.\n\n\"By the Beard of the Prophet and on my honor I swear to you that I\nhaven't touched your letter! I don't know where it is.\"\n\n\"Show me the Prophet's beard!\" commanded Jeremy.  \"Show me your honor!\"\n\n\"You talk like a madman!  How can I show either?\"\n\n\"Then how can you swear by them?  Father of easy words and evil deeds,\ngive me the letter back!\"\n\nYussuf Dakmar appealed to me as presumably responsible for Jeremy.\n\n\"You saw, effendi, didn't you?  I tried to help him.  But he who plays\nwith the cat must suffer her claws, so now he accuses me of stealing.  I\ncall you to witness that I took nothing.\"\n\n\"You must excuse him,\" I answered.  \"That is a highly important letter.\nIf it isn't found the consequences may be disastrous.\"\n\n\"By Allah, it shall be found!\" exploded Jeremy, glaring harder than ever\nat Yussuf Dakmar.  \"Look at his face!  Look at his evil eyes!  He came\nin here on purpose to spy on us and steal that letter!  It is time to\nuse my razor on him!  I swear not by the Prophet's beard or anybody's\nhonor, but by the razor in my sock that he has the letter and that I\nwill have it back!\"  Well, that was a challenge there was no\nside-stepping.  Sure of being able to prove innocence, Yussuf Dakmar\ndecided that a bold course was the best.  He proceeded to empty his own\npocket, laying the contents on the seat before Jeremy's eyes.  And\nJeremy watched like a puzzled puppy with his brow wrinkled.  The process\ntook time, because he was wearing one of those imitation Western suits,\nof prehistoric cut but up-to-date with every imaginable pocket that a\ntailor could invent.  Their contents included a dagger and a clasp-knife\nwith a long blade sharpened on both edges, but no pistol.\n\n\"Now are you satisfied?\" he demanded, after turning inside-out the two\n\"secret\" pockets in the lining of his vest.\n\n\"Less than ever!\" Jeremy retorted.  \"Until I see you naked I will not\nbelieve you!\"\n\nYussuf Dakmar turned to me again.  He was a patient spy, if ever there\nwas one.\n\n\"Do you think I should be put to that indignity?\" he asked. \"Shall I\nundress myself?\"\n\n\"By Allah, unless you do it I will cut your clothes off with my razor!\"\nJeremy announced.\n\nWe drew up at a station then, and had to wait until the train went on\nagain.  By that time Yussuf Dakmar had made up his mind. He slipped off\nhis jacket and vest and began to unfasten his collar-button as the train\ngained speed.\n\nEverything went smoothly until he stood up to remove his pants. He had\nthe top of them in both hands when Jeremy seized him suddenly by the\nelbows and spun him face about.  And there the letter lay, face downward\non the seat he had just left, bent and a little crinkled in proof that\nhe had been sitting on it for some minutes past.\n\nNow it doesn't make any difference whether a man meant to take off his\ntrousers or not.  In a crisis, if they are unfastened, he will hold them\nup.  It's like catching a monkey;  you put corn into a narrow-necked\nbasket.  The monkey inserts his arm, fills his hand with corn, and tries\nto pull it out, but can't unless he lets go of the corn, which he won't\ndo.  So you catch him. Yussuf Dakmar held up his pants with one hand,\nand tried to free himself from Jeremy with the other.  If he had let go\nhis pants he might have seized the envelope and discovered what a fake\nit was;  but he wouldn't do that.  It was I who pounced on it and stowed\nit away carefully in my inner pocket.\n\nYussuf Dakmar's emotions were poignant and mixed, but he was no quitter.\nHe thought he knew definitely where the letter was now, and the wolf\nglance with which he favoured me changed swiftly to a smile of\ningratiating politeness.\n\n\"I am glad you have recovered what you lost,\" he said, smiling, as he\nfastened up his pants and resumed his coat.  \"This friend of yours--or\nis he your servant?--made me nervous with his threats, or I should\ncertainly have found it for you sooner.\"\n\nAnd now Grim resumed a hand.  The last thing he wished was that Yussuf\nDakmar should consider his quest too difficult, for then he would\nprobably summon assistance at Haifa.  Encouragement was the proper cue,\nnow that Jeremy had tantalized him with a glimpse of the bait.  We had\nnothing to fear from him unless he should lose heart.\n\n\"The value of a sum lies in the answer,\" he said, quoting one of those\ncopybook proverbs with which all Syrians love to clinch an argument.\n\n\"The letter is in its owner's pocket.  The accuser should now apologize,\nand we can spend the rest of the journey pleasantly.\"\n\nJeremy proceeded to apologize:\n\n\"So you're not such a thief as you looks.\"\n\nThen he provided entertainment.  He drew out the razor and did stunts\nwith it, juggling it with open blade from hand to hand--pretending to\ndrop it and always catching it again within a fraction of an inch of\nYussuf Dakmar's person.  By and by he juggled with coins, match-box,\ncigars, razor and anything he could lay his hands on.\n\n\"Mashallah!\" exclaimed the Syrian at last, his face all sweaty with\nexcitement as he shrank back to avoid the spinning razor. \"Where did you\nlearn such accomplishments?\"\n\n\"Learn them?\" answered Jeremy, still juggling.  \"I am a dervaish. I was\nborn, not taught.  I can ride through the air on cannon-balls, and\nwhatever I wish for is mine the next minute.  Look, I have one piastre.\nI wish for twenty.  What do I do?  I spin it in the air--catch it--d'you\nhear them?  There you are--twenty! Count 'em if you like.\"\n\n\"A dervaish?  A holy person?  You?  Where do you come from?\"\n\n\"I was born in the belly of the South Wind,\" answered Jeremy. \"Where I\ncome from, every shell-fish has a pearl in it and gold is so common that\nthe cattle wear it in their teeth.  I can talk three languages at once\nand swear in six, use sulphur for tobacco, eat sardines without opening\nthe can, and flavour my food for choice with gun-powder.\n\n\"I've been everywhere, seen everything, heard all the lies, and I found\nthat big effendi in Jerusalem.  I saw him first.  He calls himself\nRamsden, which is derived from the name of a creature bearing wool,\nwhich in turn is a synonym for money.  He's on his way to supply Feisul\nwith money, and I'm going to show him the streets of Damascus.  Anything\nelse you want to know?\"\n\n\"Supply Feisul with money?  That is interesting.  American money\nperhaps?  An American banker by any chance?\"\n\n\"Nothing to do with chance.  He's a father of certainties. Didn't he\ngive me that letter to keep, and didn't I find a safe place for it\nbetween you and the cushions?  Yes, I put it there. I'm an honest man,\nbut I have my reasonable doubts about this other fellow.  Ramsden\neffendi found him somewhere, and engaged him as a servant without asking\nme.  Perhaps he's honest.  Only Allah knows men's hearts.  But he hasn't\ngot an honest face like yours, and when pay-day comes I shall hide my\nmoney.\"\n\n\"So you know Damascus?\" answered Yussuf Dakmar.  \"I hope you will come\nand see me in Damascus.  I will give you my address.  If Ramsden effendi\nhas only engaged you temporarily, perhaps I can show you a way to make\nmoney with those accomplishments of yours.\"\n\n\"Make money?\" answered Jeremy, prattling away like a madman.  \"I am\nweary of the stuff.  I'm hunting the world over, in search of a friend.\nNobody loves me.  I want to find someone who'll believe the lies I tell\nhim without expecting me to believe the truth he tries to foist on me.\nI want to find a man as tricky with his brains as I am with my hands.\nHe must be a politician and a spy, because I love excitement.  That's\nwhy I called you a spy.  If you were one, you might have admitted it,\nand then we could have been friends, like two yolks in one eggshell.\nBut I see you're only a shell without a yolk in it.  Who cleaned you?\"\n\n\"How long have you been in the service of Ramsden effendi?\" Yussuf\nDakmar asked him.\n\n\"Not long, and I am tired of it.  He is strong, and his fist is heavy.\nWhen he gets drunk he is difficult to carry upstairs to bed, and if I am\nalso drunk the feat is still more difficult.  It is a mystery how such a\nman as he should be entrusted with a secret mission, for he drinks with\nanyone.  Aha!  He scowls at me because I tell the truth about him, but\nif I had a bottle of whisky to offer him he would soon look pleasant\nagain, and would give me a drink too, when he had swallowed all he could\nhold.\"\n\nIf he had really been my servant I would naturally have kicked him off\nthe train for a fraction of such impudence.  I didn't exactly know what\nto do.  There is a thoughtful motive behind every apparently random\nabsurdity that Jeremy gets off, but I was uncomfortably conscious of the\nfact that my wits don't work fast enough to follow such volatile\nmanoeuvres.  Perhaps it's the Scotian blood in me.  I can follow a\npractical argument fast enough, when the axioms' are all laid down and\nwe're agreed on the subject.\n\nHowever, Grim came to my rescue.  He had his pencil out, and contrived\nto flick a piece of paper into my lap unseen by Yussuf Dakmar.\n\n\nJeremy's cue is good [the note ran].  Dismiss him for talking about you\nto a stranger.  Trust him to do the rest.\n\n\nSo I acted the part of an habitually heavy drinker in a fit of sudden\nrage, and dismissed Jeremy from my service on the spot.\n\n\"Very well,\" he answered blandly. \"Allah makes all things easy. Let us\nhope that other fellow finds it easy to put you to bed tonight!  Allah\nis likewise good, for I have my ticket to Damascus, and all I need to\nbeg for is a bed and food at Haifa.\"\n\nI muttered something in reply about his impudence, and the conversation\nceased abruptly.  But at the end of ten minutes or so Yussuf Dakmar went\nout into the corridor, signaling to Jeremy to follow him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\"He'll forgive anyone who brings him whiskey.\"\n\n\nYou remember, of course, that line that Shakespeare put into the mouth\nof Puck?  \"What fools these mortals be!\"  The biggest fools are the\nextra smart ones, whose pride and peculiar joy it is to \"beat the game.\"\n\nYussuf Dakmar assessed all other humans as grist for his mill. Character\nto him was expressed in degrees of folly and sheer badness.  Virtue\nexisted only as a weakness to be exploited.  The question that always\nexercised him was, wherein does the other fellow's weakness lie?  It's a\nform of madness.  Where a sane man looks for strength and honesty that\nhe can yoke up with, a Yussuf Dakmar spies out human failings;  and\nwhereas most of us in our day have mistaken pyrites for fine gold, which\ndid not hurt more than was good for us, he ends by mistaking gold for\ndross.\n\nYou can persuade such a man without the slightest difficulty that you\nare a fool and a crook.  Jeremy had turned the trick for his own\namusement as much as anything, although his natural vein of shrewdness\nprobably suggested the idea.  Yussuf Dakmar, ready to believe all evil\nand no good of anyone, was convinced that he had to deal with a scatter-\nbrained Arab who could be used for almost any purpose, and Jeremy's\nriotous bent for jumping from one thing to another fixed the delusion\nstill more firmly.\n\nBut Lord, he had caught a Tartar!  Outside at the end of the corridor,\nin full view, but out of earshot, of Narayan Singh, Yussuf Dakmar made a\nproposal to Jeremy that was almost perfect in its naive obliquity.\nThere was nothing original or even unusual about it, except the\ncircumstances, time and place. Green-goods men and blue-sky stock\nsalesmen, race-course touts and sure-thing politicians get away with the\nsame proposition in the U.S. every day of the week, and pocket millions\nby it.  Only, just as happens to all such gentry on occasion, Yussuf\nDakmar had the wrong fish in his net.\n\nHe jerked his head toward where Narayan Singh sat stolid and sleepy-\nlooking on a camp-stool with his curly black beard resting on the heel\nof one hand.\n\n\"Do you know that man?\" he asked.\n\n\"Wallah!  How should I know him?\" Jeremy answered.  \"He looks like a\nHindu thinking of reincarnation.  Inshallah, he will turn into a tiger\npresently!\"\n\n\"Beware of him!  He is an Administration spy.  He is watching me talk to\nyou, and perhaps he will ask you afterward what I have said.  You must\nbe very careful how you answer him.\"\n\n\"I will tell him you asked me for a love-potion for the engine-driver's\nwife,\" Jeremy answered.\n\n\"I am listening.  What is it you are really going to say?\"\n\n\"That master of yours--that Ramsden, who dismissed you so tyrannically\njust now--\"\n\n\"That drunkard?  There is nothing interesting to be said about him,\"\nJeremy answered.  \"He is a fool who has paid my fare as far as Damascus.\nMay Allah reward him for it!\"\n\n\"Are you telling me the truth?\" demanded Yussuf Dakmar, fixing his eyes\nsternly on Jeremy's.\n\nYour con man never overlooks a chance to put his intended victim on the\ndefensive at an early stage in the proceedings.  \"How can he have paid\nyour fare as far as Damascus?  This line only goes to Haifa, where you\nhave to change trains and buy another ticket.\"\n\n\"I see you are a clever devil,\" Jeremy retorted.  \"May Allah give you a\nbelly ache, if that is where you keep your brains!  It was I who bought\nthe tickets.  The fool gave me sufficient money for three first-class\nfares all the way to Damascus, and I have the change.  He forgot that\nwhen he dismissed me.\"\n\n\"Then you won't need to beg board and lodging in Haifa?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.  I need my money for another matter.  It is high time I\nmarried, and a fellow without money has to put up with any toothless\n\nthat nobody else will take.\"\n\n\"So you hope to find a wife in Damascus?\"\n\n\"Inshallah,\" Jeremy answered piously.\n\n\"Well, I will find you a good-looking girl for wife, provided you first\nprove that you will make a good son-in-law.  I take men as I find them,\nnot as they represent themselves.  He who wishes for the fire must first\nchop wood.  You understand me?\"\n\n\"Wallah!  I can chop wood like an axe with two heads.  Is the woman your\ndaughter?\"\n\n\"That is as may be.  Let us talk business.  I reward my friends, but woe\nbetide the fool who betrays my confidence!\" said Yussuf Dakmar darkly.\n\n\"I see you are a man after my own heart,\" answered Jeremy;  \"a thorough\nfellow who stops at nothing!  Good!  Allah must have brought us two\ntogether for an evil purpose, being doubtless weary of the League of\nNations;  Unbosom!  I am like a well, into which men drop things and\nnever see them any more.\"\n\n\"You are a fine rascal, I can see that clearly!  So you think that Allah\nis cooking up evil, do you?  Tee-hee!  That is an original idea, and\nthere may be something in it.  Let us hope there is something in it for\nus two, at all events.  Now, as to that fellow Ramsden--\"\n\n\"Avoid him unless he is drunk,\" advised Jeremy.  \"The weight of his fist\nwould drive a man like you like a nail into a tree.\"\n\n\"Who fears such an ox?\" the Syrian retorted.  \"A fly can sting him;  a\nlittle knife can bleed him;  a red rag can enrage him; and the crows who\ndevour that sort of meat won't worry as to whether he was killed\naccording to ritual!  He has money for Feisul, has he?  Well, never\nmind.  He has a letter as well, and that is what I want.  Will you get\nit for me?\"\n\n\"Do you need it badly?\"\n\n\"By Allah, I must have it!\"\n\n\"By Allah, then I am in good luck, for that makes me indispensable,\ndoesn't it?  And an indispensable man can demand what he pleases!\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Yussuf Dakmar answered, frowning.  \"I have taken a fancy\nto you, or I would see you to the devil.  When we reach Haifa, ten or\neven twenty men will present themselves to do this business for me.  Or,\nif I choose, I can use that fellow Omar who is travelling with Ramsden;\nhe would like to be my accomplice, but I don't trust him very much.\"\n\n\"In that you are perfectly right,\" answered Jeremy.  \"He is not at all\nthe sort of man for you to trust.  It wouldn't surprise me to learn that\nhe has warned Ramsden against you already!  Better beware of him!\"\n\nAccording to Jeremy's account of the conversation afterward, it was not\nuntil that moment that he saw clearly how to prevent Yussuf Dakmar from\ncalling in thugs to attack me either at Haifa or at some point between\nthere and Damascus.  Until then he had been feeling his way along--\n\"spieling,\" as he calls it--keeping his man interested while he made all\nready for the next trick.\n\n\"To tell you the truth,\" he went on, \"Omar isn't that fellow's real\nname.  He is a sharp one, and he is after the letter every bit as much\nas you are.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"Wallah, how not?  because he himself told me!  just like you, he tried\nto get me into partnership.  He offered me a big reward, but he's not\nlike you, so I didn't believe him;  and he has no daughter;  I've no use\nfor a man who hasn't a good-looking daughter.  What he's afraid of is\nthat someone else may get the letter first.  And he's a desperate\nfellow.  He told me his intentions and whether you believe me or not,\nthey're worthy of a wolf!\"\n\n\"I'm glad I resolved to take you into my confidence,\" said Yussuf\nDakmar, nodding.  \"Go on;  I'm listening.  Tell me what he told you.\"\n\n\"He plans to get hold of the letter between Haifa and Damascus. He\nthinks that's safest, because it's over the border and there won't be\nany British officers to interfere.  Somewhere up the Lebanon Valley,\nafter most of the passengers have left the train, looks good to him.\nBut I think he knows who you are.\"\n\n\"Yes, he knows me.  Go on.\"\n\n\"And He's afraid you'll get help and forestall him.  So he's going to\nwatch Ramsden like a cat watching a mouse-hole, and he's going to watch\nyou too.  And if anybody tries to interfere at Haifa, or if men get on\nthe train between Haifa and Damascus who look like being accomplices of\nyours, he's going to murder Ramsden there and then, seize the letter,\nand make a jump for it! You see, he's one of those mean fellows--a\nregular dog-in-the-manger;  he'd rather get caught by the police and\nhanged for murder than let anybody else get what he's after.  Oh,\nbelieve me, I didn't trust him!  I laughed when he made his proposal to\nme.\"\n\n\"Now that is very interesting,\" said Yussuf Dakmar.  \"To tell you the\ntruth I had a little experience with him last night myself. He came on\nme by accident in a certain place, and we conversed. I pretended to\nagree with him for the sake of appearances, but I formed a very poor\nopinion of him.  Well, suppose we put him out of the way first;  how\nwould that be?  You look like a strong man.  Suppose you watch for an\nopportunity to push him off the train?\"\n\n\"Oh, that would never do!\" Jeremy answered, shaking his head from side\nto side.  \"You mustn't forget that Indian who sits in the corridor.  It\nwas you yourself who told me he is an Administration spy.  If he\nsuspects you already, he will suspect me for having talked with you, and\nwill watch me;  and if I try to push that fellow Omar off the train, he\nwill come to the rescue.  Surely you don't expect me to fight both of\nthem at once!  Besides, you must consider Ramsden.\n\n\"That fellow Ramsden is big and strong, but he is a nervous wreck.  Give\nhim the least excuse and he will yell for the police like a baby crying\nfor its mother!  He looks on Omar as his bodyguard now that he has\ndismissed me;  and if Omar should get killed, or disappear between here\nand Haifa, Ramsden would demand an escort of police.  In fact, I think\nhe'd lose courage altogether and put that letter in a strong-room in the\nHaifa bank.  What is the letter, anyway?  What's in it?  How much will\nyou pay me if I get it for you?\"\n\n\"Never mind what's in it.  Will you get it, that's the point--will you\nget it and bring it to me?\"\n\n\"That isn't the point at all,\" answered Jeremy.  \"The point is how much\nwill you pay me if I do that?\"\n\n\"Very well, I will pay you fifty pounds.\"\n\n\"Mashallah!  You must need it awfully badly.  I could have been hired\nfor fifty shillings to do a much more dangerous thing!\"\n\n\"Well, twenty-five pounds ought to be enough.  I will pay you twenty-\nfive.\"\n\n\"Nothing less than fifty!\" Jeremy retorted.  \"I always get fifty of\neverything.  Fifty lashes in the jail--fifty beans at meal-time--fifty\npairs of boots to clean for Ramsden--fifty is my lucky number.  I have\nmade forty-nine attempts to get married, and the next time I shall\nsucceed.  If it isn't the woman's lucky number too, that's her affair.\nShow me the fifty pounds.\"\n\n\"I haven't that much with me,\" answered Yussuf Dakmar.  \"I will pay you\nin Damascus.\"\n\n\"All right.  Then I will give you the letter in Damascus.\"\n\n\"No, no!  Get it as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"And give it to me immediately.  Then if you like you can stay close to\nme until I pay you in Damascus.\"\n\n\"'The ass is invited to a wedding to carry wood and water, and they beat\nhim with one of the sticks he carried,'\" Jeremy quoted. \"No, no, no!  I\nwill get the letter, for I know how.  After I have it you may keep close\nto me until we reach Damascus.  I will show it to you, but I won't give\nit to you until after I get the fifty pounds.\"\n\n\"Very well, since you are so untrustful.\"\n\n\"Untrustful?  I am possessed by a demon of mistrust!  Why? Because I\nknow I am not the worst person in the world, and what I can think of,\nanother might do.  Now, if you were I and I were you, which God forbid,\nbecause I am a happy fellow and you look bilious, and you stole the\nletter for me because I promised to pay you in Damascus, but wouldn't\ngive me the letter until I paid you, do you know what I would think of\ndoing?  I would promise a few tough fellows ten pounds among them to\nmurder you.  Thus I would get the letter and save forty pounds.\"\n\n\"Ah?  But I am not that kind of man,\" said Yussuf Dakmar.\n\n\"Well, you will learn what kind of man you are in the next world when\nyou reach the Judgment Seat.  What is most interesting now is the kind\nof fellow I am.  I will steal the letter from Ramsden, and keep it until\nyou pay me in Damascus.  But I shan't sleep, and I shall watch you;  and\nif I suspect you of making plans to have me robbed or murdered I shall\nmake such a noise that everybody will come running, and then I shall be\na celebrity but they'll put you in jail.\"\n\n\"Very well;  you steal the letter, and I'll keep close to you,\" said\nYussuf Dakmar.  \"But how are you going to do it, now that Ramsden has\ndismissed you from his service?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's easy.  You get me some whisky and I'll take it to him for a\npeace offering.  He'll forgive anyone who brings him whisky.\"\n\n\"Tee-hee!  That is quite an idea.  Yes.  Now--how can I get whisky on\nthe train?  If only I could get some!  I have a little soporific in a\npaper packet that could be mixed with the whisky to make him sleep\nsoundly.  Wait here while I walk down the train and see what I can\nfind.\"\n\nYussuf Dakmar was gone twenty minutes, and whether he begged, bought or\nstole did not transpire, but he returned with a pint flask containing\nstuff that looked and smelt enough like whisky to get by if there had\nbeen a label on the bottle.  He poured a powder into it in Jeremy's\npresence, the two of them squatting on the floor of the corridor with\nthe bottle between them so that no one else might see what was taking\nplace.\n\n\"Now, you would better get rid of that fellow Omar while you attend to\nthis,\" Yussuf Dakmar cautioned him.  \"Can you think of any way of doing\nthat?\"\n\n\"Oh, easily!\" Jeremy answered.  \"He is a great one for the women. I will\ntell him there is a pretty Armenian girl in the car behind.  He will run\nlike any other Turk to have a good look at her.\"\n\n\"Very well.  I will wait here.  But understand now;  I am a dangerous\nman.  You have fortune in one hand, but destruction in the other!\"\n\n\"Very well;  but this may take me an hour, and if you grow impatient,\nand that Indian sees you peering into the compartment after having\nwatched you and me talking all this time, he'll grow suspicious.\"\n\n\"All right;  I'll go to the car behind.  As soon as you have the letter,\ncome and tell me.\"\n\nSo Jeremy came back and entertained Grim and me with a burlesque account\nof the interview, after whispering to Narayan Singh to give the alarm in\nthe event of Yussuf Dakmar returning forward to spy on us.  Grim put the\ndoped whisky into his valise after a sniff at it, instead of throwing it\nout of the window at my suggestion;  and after a suitable interval he\nwent out in the part of the Turk to look for the imaginary beautiful\nArmenian. Then I gave Jeremy the fake letter back, and went to sleep.\n\nSo it's no use asking me what the country looks like between Ludd and\nHaifa.  I didn't even wake up to see the Lake of Tiberias, Sea of\nGalilee, or Bahr Tubariya, as it is variously called.  A rather common\nsickness is what Sir Richard Burton called Holylanditis and I've had it,\nas well as the croup and measles in my youth.  Some folk never recover\nfrom it, and to them a rather ordinary sheet of water and ugly modern\nvillages built on ruins look like the pictures that an opium smoker\nsees.\n\nThe ruins and the history do interest me, but you can't see them from\nthe train, and after a night without sleep there seemed to me something\nmore profitable in view than to hang from a window and buy fish that\nundoubtedly had once swum in Galilee water, but that cost a most\nunrighteous price and stank as if straight from a garbage heap.\n\nThe whole train reeked of putrid fish when we reached Haifa in the\nevening, in time to watch the sun go down across the really glorious Bay\nof Acre.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\"The rest will be simple!\"\n\n\nHaifa was crowded with Syrians of all sorts, and there were two or three\nstaff officers in the uniform of Feisul's army lounging on the platform,\nwho conned new arrivals with a sort of childlike solicitude, as if by\nlooking in a man's face they could judge whether he was friendly to\ntheir cause or not.  Mabel had wired to her friend, and was met at the\nstation, so we had nothing to worry over for the present on her score.\nOur own troubles began when we reached the only hotel and found it\ncrowded.  The proprietor, a little wizened, pockmarked Arab in a black\nalpaca jacket and yellow pants, with a tarboosh balanced forward at a\npessimistic angle, suggested that there might be guests in the hotel who\nwould let us share their beds...\n\n\"Although there will be no reduction of the price to either party in\nthat event,\" he hastened to explain.\n\nIt was a wonder of an hotel.  You could smell the bugs and the sanitary\narrangements from the front-door step, and although the whole place had\nbeen lime-washed, dirt from all over the Near East was accumulating on\nthe dead white, making it look leprous and depressing.\n\nThe place fronted on a main street, with its back toward the Bay of Acre\nat a point where scavengers used the beach for a dumping place.  There\nwas a hostel of British officers about a mile away, where Grim might\nhave been able to procure beds for the whole party;  but I noticed no\nless than five men who followed us up from the station and seemed to be\nkeeping a watchful eye on Yussuf Dakmar and it was a sure bet that if we\nshould show our hands so far as to mess with British officers, the train\nnext day would be packed with men to whom murder would be simple\namusement.\n\nYet Grim and Jeremy needed sleep and so did Narayan Singh.  We offered\nto rent an outhouse for the night--a cellar--the roof, but there was\nnothing doing, and it was Yussuf Dakmar at last who solved the problem\nfor us.\n\nHe found a crony of his, who had occupied for several days a room\ncontaining two beds.  With unheard-of generosity, accompanied, however,\nby a peculiar display of yellow teeth and more of the jaundiced whites\nof his eyes than I cared to see, this individual offered to go elsewhere\nfor the night and to place the room at my disposal.\n\n\"But there is this about it,\" he explained.  \"Where I am going there is\nno room for my friend Yussuf Dakmar Bey, so I must ask you to let him\nshare this with you.  You and he could each have a bed, of course, but\nit seems to me that your servants look wearier than you do.  I suggest\nthen that you take one bed, effendi, and share it with my friend Yussuf\nDakmar Bey, leaving the other to your servants, who I hope will be\nsuitably grateful for the consideration shown them.\"\n\nGrim nodded to me from behind the Syrians' backs, and I jumped at the\noffer.  Payment was refused.  The man explained that he had the room by\nthe week and the loan of it to me for one night would cost him nothing.\nIn fact, he acted courteously and with considerable evidence of\nbreeding, merely requesting my permission to lock the big closet where\nhe kept his personal belongings and to take the key away with him.  Even\nif we had been in a mood to cavil it would have been difficult to find\nfault, for it was a spacious, clean and airy room--three characteristics\neach of which is as scarce as the other in that part of the world.\n\nThe beds stood foot to foot along the right wall as you entered. Against\nthe opposite wall was a cheap wooden wash-stand and an enormous closet\nbuilt of olive wood sunk into a deep recess.  The thing was about eight\nfeet wide and reached to the ceiling;  you couldn't tell the depth\nbecause he locked it at once and pocketed the key, and it fitted into\nthe recess so neatly that a knife-blade would hardly have gone into the\ncrack.\n\nOutside the bedroom door, in a lobby furnished with odds and ends, was a\nwickerwork sofa that would do finely for Narayan Singh, and that old\nsoldier didn't need to have it pointed out to him.  Without word or sign\nfrom us he threw his kit on the floor, unrolled his blankets, removed\nhis boots, curled up on the sofa, and if he didn't go to sleep at once,\ngave such a perfect imitation of it that somebody's fox terrier came and\nsniffed him, and, recognizing a campaigner after his own wandering\nheart, jumped on his chest and settled down to sleep too.\n\nAs soon as our host had left the room, all bows and toothy smiles,\nJeremy with his back to me drew from one pocket the letter he was\nsupposed to have stolen from me, flourished it in Yussuf Dakmar's face,\nand concealed it carefully in another. Then a new humorous notion\noccurred to him.  He pulled it out again, folded it in the pocket wallet\nin which he had carried it from the first, wrapped the whole in a\nhandkerchief, which he knotted carefully and then handed it to me.\n\n\"Effendi,\" he said, \"you are a fierce master and a mighty drunkard, but\na man without guile.  Keep that till the morning. Then, if Omar wants to\nsteal it he will have to murder you instead of me, and I would rather\nsleep than die.  But you must give it back at dawn, because the prayers\nare in it that a very holy ma'lim wrote for me, and unless I read those\nprayers properly tomorrow's train will come to grief before we reach\nDamascus.\"\n\nHe acted the part perfectly of one of those half-witted, wholly shrewd\nmountebanks, who pick up a living by taking advantage of tolerance and\ngood nature.  You've all seen the type.  It's commonest at race-meetings\nbut you'll find it anywhere in the world where vagrant men of means\nforegather.\n\nAgain Yussuf Dakmar's face became a picture of suppressed emotion.  I\npocketed the wallet with the same matter-of-fact air with which I have\naccepted a servant's money to keep safe for him scores of times.  He\nbelieved me to be a drunkard, who had been thoroughly doped that day and\nwould probably drink hard that night to drown the after-taste.  It ought\nto be easy to rob me while I slept.  Any fool could have read his\nthoughts.\n\nHe came down and ate supper with us at a trestle table in the dimly\nlighted dining-room, and I encouraged his new-born optimism by ordering\ntwo bottles of whisky to take upstairs.  Jeremy, who can't be happy\nunless playing his part for all it's worth, became devoutly religious\nand made a tremendous fuss because ham was put on the table.  He accused\nthe proprietor of using pig's fat to smear all the cooking utensils,\ndemanded to see the kitchen, and finally refused to eat anything but\nleban, which is a sort of curds.  If Yussuf Dakmar had entertained\nsuspicions of Jeremy's real nationality they were all resolved by the\ntime that meal was finished.\n\nBut the five' men who had followed us from the station sat in the dark\nat a table in the far corner of the room and watched every move we made.\nWhen the coffee was brought I sat smoking and surly over it, as if my\nhead ached from the day's drink;  Grim and Jeremy, aching for sleep but\nrefusing like good artists to neglect a detail of their part, went to\nanother table and played backgammon, betting quarrelsomely;  and at last\none of the five men walked over and touched Yussuf Dakmar's shoulder.\nAt once he followed all five of them out of the room, whereat Grim and\nJeremy promptly went to bed.  It was so obviously my turn to stay awake\nthat Grim didn't even trouble to remind me of it.\n\nSo I took the whisky upstairs, noticed that Narayan Singh was missing\nfrom the couch where he had gone to sleep, although the fox-terrier was\nsnoring so loud in his blankets that I had to look twice in the dim\nlight.  I mentioned that fact to Grim who merely smiled as he got\nbetween the sheets.  Then I went down to the street to get exercise and\nfresh air.  I didn't go far, but strode up and down in front of the\nhotel a quarter of a mile or so in each direction, keeping in the middle\nof the street.\n\nI had made the fourth or fifth turn when Narayan Singh came out and\naccosted me under the lamplight.\n\n\"Pardon,\" he called aloud in English, \"does the sahib know where I can\nfind a druggist's open at this hour?  I have a toothache and need\nmedicine.\"\n\n\"Come and I'll show you a place,\" said I with the patronizing air of a\ntourist showing off his knowledge, and we strode along together down the\nstreet, he holding one hand to his jaw.\n\n\"Thus and so it happened, sahib,\" he began as soon as we had gone a safe\ndistance.  \"I lay sleeping, having kept my belly empty that I might wake\neasily.  There came Yussuf Dakmar and five men brushing by me, and they\nall went into a room four doors beyond the sahib's.  The room next\nbeyond that one is occupied by an officer sahib, who fought at El-Arish\nalongside my battalion. Between him and me is a certain understanding\nbased on past happenings in which we both had a hand.  He is not as some\nother sahibs, but a man who opens both ears and his heart, and when I\nknocked on his door he opened it and recognized me.\n\n\"'Well?' said he.  'Why not come and see me in the morning?\n\n\"'Sahib,' said I, 'for the sake of El-Arish, let me in quickly, and\nclose the door!'\n\n\"So he did, wondering and not pleased to be disturbed by a Sikh at such\nan hour.  And I said to him:\n\n\"'Sahib,' said I, 'am I a badmash?  A scoundrel?'\n\n\"'No,' said he, 'not unless you changed your morals when you left the\nservice.'\n\n\"Said I, 'I am still in the service.'\n\n\"'Good,' said he. 'What then?'\n\n\"'I go listening again in no-man's land,' said I, and he whistled\nsoftly.  'Is there not a roof below your window?' I asked him, and he\nnodded.\n\n\"'Then let me use it, sahib, and return the same way presently.'\n\n\"So he threw back the shutter, asking no more questions, and I climbed\nout.  The window of the room where Yussuf Dakmar and the five were stood\nopen, but the lattice shutter was closed tight, so that I could stand up\non the flat roof of the kitchen and listen without being seen.  And,\nsahib, I could recognize the snarl of Yussuf Dakmar's voice even before\nmy ear was laid to the open lattice.  He was like a dog at bay.  The\nother five were angry with him.  They were accusing him of playing\nfalse.  They swore that a great sum could be had for that letter, which\nthey should share between them.  Said a voice I did not recognize: 'If\nthe French will pay one price they will pay another;  what does money\nmatter to them, if they can make out a case against Feisul?  Will they\nnot have Syria?  The thing is simple as twice two,' said he.  'The\nhuntsman urges on the hounds, but unless he is cleverer than they, who\neats the meat?  The French regard us as animals, I tell you!  Very well;\nlet us live up to the part and hunt like animals, since he who has the\nname should have the game as well;  and when we have done the work and\nthey want booty let them be made aware that animals must eat!  We will\nset our own price on that document.'\n\n\"'And as for this Yussuf Dakmar,' said another man, 'let him take a back\nseat unless he is willing to share and share alike with us.  He is not\ndifficult to kill!'\n\n\"And at that, sahib, Yussuf Dakmar flew into a great rage and called\nthem fools of complicated kinds.\n\n\"'Like hounds without a huntsman, ye will overrun the scent!' said he;\nand he spoke more like a man than any of them, although not as a man to\nbe liked or trusted.  'Who are ye to clap your fat noses on the scent I\nfound and tell me the how and whither of it?  It may be that I can get\nthat letter tonight.  Surely I can get it between this place and\nDamascus;  and no one can do that, for I, and I only, know where it is.\nNor will I tell!'  And they answered all together, 'We will make you\ntell!'\n\n\"But he said, 'All that ye five fools can do is to interfere. Easy to\nkill me, is it?  Well, perhaps.  It has been tried.  But, if so, then\nthough ye are jackals, kites and vultures all in one with the skill of\nchemists added, ye can never extract secret knowledge from a dead man's\nbrain.  Then that letter will reach Feisul tomorrow night;  and the\nFrench, who speak of you now as of animals, will call you what?\nPrinces?  Noblemen?'\n\n\"I suppose they saw the point of that, sahib, for they changed their\ntone without, however, becoming friendly to Yussuf Dakmar. Thieves of\nthat sort know one another, and trust none, and it is all a lie, sahib,\nabout there being any honor among them.  Fear is the only tie that binds\nthieves, and they proceeded to make Yussuf Dakmar afraid.\n\n\"There seems to be one among them, sahib, who is leader.  He has a thin\nvoice like a eunuch's, and unlike the others swears seldom.\n\n\"This father of a thin voice accepted the situation.  He said: \"'Well\nand good.  Let Yussuf Dakmar do the hunting for us.  It is sufficient\nthat we hunt Yussuf Dakmar.  Two of us occupy the room next to\nRamsden's.  If Yussuf Dakmar needs aid in the night, let him summon us\nby scratching with his nails on the closet door. The rest will be\nsimple.  There are four in this besides us five; so if we count Yussuf\nDakmar that makes ten who share the reward. Shall Yussuf Dakmar grow\nfat, while nine of us starve?  I think not!  Let him get the letter, and\ngive it to me.  We will hide it, and I will deal with the French.  If he\nfails tonight, let him try again tomorrow on the train.  But we five\nwill also take that train to Damascus, and unless that letter is in my\nhands before the journey's end, then Yussuf Dakmar dies.  Is that\nagreed?'\n\n\"All except Yussuf Dakmar agreed to it.  He was very angry and called\nthem leeches, whereat they laughed, saying that leeches only suck enough\nand then fall off, whereas they would take all or kill.  They made him\nunderstand it, taking a great oath together to slay him without mercy\nunless he should get the letter and give it to them before the train\nreaches Damascus tomorrow evening.\n\n\"Well, sahib, he agreed presently, not with any effort at good grace,\nbut cursing while he yielded.\n\n\"In truth, sahib, it is less fear than lack of sleep that Yussuf Dakmar\nfeels.  I could hear him yawn through the window lattice. Now a man in\nthat condition is likely to act early in the night for fear that sleep\nmay otherwise get the better of him, and the sahib will do well to be\nkeenly alert from the first.  I shall be asleep on that couch outside\nthe door and will come if called, so the sahib would better not lock the\ndoor but should call loud in case of need, because I also have been long\nawake and may sleep heavily.\"\n\n\"Suppose I walk the streets all night?\" said I.  \"Wouldn't that foil\nthem?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib, but the reverse;  for if Yussuf Dakmar should miss you\nafter midnight he would go in search of you, with those five in turn\ntracking him.  And as for finding you, that would be a simple matter,\nfor every night thief and beggar waiting for the dawn would give\nattention to such a big man as you and would report your movements.  All\nsix would come on you in the dark and would kill you surely.  Then, as\nif that were not bad enough, having searched you they would learn that\nthe letter in your possession is not the right one;  and the trail of\nthe right one would be that much easier to detect.\"\n\n\"Then come with me,\" said I, \"and we'll make a night of it together.\nYou and I can defend ourselves against those six.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, sahib.  But my place is within hail of Jimgrim.  No, it is\nbest that you see this matter through tonight between four walls.  Only\nremember, sahib, that though a man on duty may feign sleep, it is wiser\nnot to, because sleep steals on us unawares!\"\n\nSo I returned to the bedroom where Grim and Jeremy were snoring a\nhalleluja chorus;  but Yussuf Dakmar hadn't returned yet.  I took\nadvantage of the Syrian's absence to open Grim's valise, remove the\nbottle of doped whisky and set it on the table close to the window\nbeside the two bottles that I had bought downstairs--one of which, for\nthe sake of appearances, I opened just as Yussuf Dakmar entered, smiling\nto conceal anxiety.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\"You made a bad break that time\"\n\n\nGrim was in Mephistophelian humor.  He can sleep cat-fashion, for sixty\nseconds at a time, with all his wits about him in the intervals, and\nlikes to feel in the crook of his own forefinger the hidden hair-trigger\nof events.  I don't think Jeremy was awake when I first entered the\nroom, although it suited Grim's humor that he should be presently;  but\nyou would have sworn they were both unconscious, judging by the see-saw,\nbass and baritone snoring.\n\nI poured out whisky, drank a little of it grouchily, and watched Yussuf\nDakmar into bed.  He didn't take many of his clothes off and even by\ncandle-light you could see the shape of the knife concealed under his\nshirt.  He sat cross-legged on the bed, presumably praying, and as I\ndidn't like the look of him I blew out the candle.\n\nInstantly, pinched and prompted by James Schuyler Grim, Jeremy sat up\nand yammered profanely at the darkness, vowing he couldn't see to sleep\nwithout a light in the room.  I tinkled a tumbler against a whisky\nbottle, and Jeremy instantly swore that he heard burglars.  Sitting up\nand whirling his pillow he knocked Yussuf Dakmar off the bed on to the\nfloor.\n\nSo I lit the candle again, after emptying my glass of whisky into a\nspittoon;  whereat Jeremy quoted the Koran about the fate of drunkards\nand, getting out of bed, apologized to Yussuf Dakmar like a courtier\ndoing homage to a king.\n\n\"Your honor was born under a lucky star,\" he assured him.  \"I usually\nshoot or stab, but the pillow was the first thing handy.\"\n\nThe Syrian had hard work to keep his temper, for he had fallen on the\nhaft of the hidden knife and it hurt him between two ribs, where a\npoorly conditioned man is extra sensitive.  However, he mumbled\nsomething and crawled between the sheets.\n\nThen Grim vowed that he couldn't sleep with a light so I blew out the\ncandle, and in about two minutes the steady seesaw snoring resumed.  I\ntook the opportunity to empty half the contents of a whisky bottle into\nthe spittoon, and after lighting a pipe proceeded to clink a tumbler at\nsteady intervals as evidence of debauch well under way.\n\nExcept for the clink and bump of the tumbler, and once when I filled and\nrelit the pipe, all was quiet for half an hour, when Yussuf Dakmar piped\nup suddenly and asked me whether I didn't intend to come to bed.\n\n\"I will not trouble you, effendi.  I will keep over to my side. There is\nplenty of room in the bed for the two of us.\"\n\nAs he spoke I heard a movement of the bedclothes as Grim pinched Jeremy\nawake again.  I answered before Jeremy could horn in.\n\n\"Hic!  You 'spect me 'nto bed full o' snakes?  Never sleep 'slong as\nvenomous reptiles waiting!  Hic!  You stay 'n bed an keep 'em 'way from\nme!\"\n\nWell, Jeremy didn't want any better cue than that.  He got up, lit the\ncandle and explained to me with great wealth of Arabic theosophy that\nthe snakes I saw were mere delusions because Allah never made them;  and\nI tried to look utterly drunk, staring at him with dropped jaw and\ndroopy eyelids, knocking an empty bottle over with my elbow by way of\ncalling attention to it.\n\n\"Get into bed, effendi,\" Jeremy advised me, feeding the cue back, since\nI was in the middle of the stage.\n\n\"Not into that bed!\" I answered, shaking my head solemnly.  \"That f'ler\nput snakes in on purpose.  Why's he sober when I'm drunk? I won't sleep\nin bed with sober man.  Let him get drun' too, an' both see snakes.\nThen I'll sleep with him!\"\n\nJeremy's roving eye fell on the small doped bottle that I had taken from\nGrim's valise.  Looking preternaturally wise, he walked over to Yussuf\nDakmar's bed, sat down on it with his back toward me and proceeded to\nunfold a plan.\n\n\"Allah makes all things easy,\" he began.  \"It is lawful to take all\nprecautions to confound the infidel.  We shall never get that drunkard\nto bed as long as there's any whisky, so let's encourage him to drink it\nall.  When it's gone he'll sleep on the floor and we'll get some peace.\nIt's a good chance for us to drink whisky without committing sin!  We\nneedn't take much--just one drink each, and then he'll swallow the rest\nlike a hog to prevent our getting any more.  You look as if a glass of\nwhisky would do you good.  That fellow Omar is asleep and won't see us,\nso nobody can tell tales afterwards.  It's a good opportunity.  Come\non!\"\n\nI had sat so that Yussuf Dakmar couldn't see what I was doing and poured\nout the liquor in advance, arranging the glasses so that Yussuf Dakmar\nwould take the doped stuff--a perfectly un-Christian proceeding, I\nadmit.  Christians are scarce when you get right down to cases.  Most of\nus in extremity prefer Shakespeare's adage about hoisting engineers.  It\ngets results so much more quickly than turning the other cheek.  At any\nrate, I own up.\n\nYussuf Dakmar, smirking in anticipation of an easy victory, took the\nnearest tumbler and tossed off the contents in imitation of Jeremy's\nfree and easy air;  and the drug acted as swiftly as the famous \"knock-\nout-drops\" they used to administer in the New York Tenderloin.\n\nHe knew what had happened before he lost consciousness, for he tried to\ngive the alarm to his friends.  He lay on the floor opening and shutting\nhis mouth, and I think he believed he was shouting for help;  but after\na minute or two you could hardly detect his breathing, and his face\nchanged colour as if he had been poisoned.\n\nGrim didn't even trouble to get out of bed, but listened without comment\nto my version of Narayan Singh's report, and Jeremy went back to sleep\nchuckling;  so I held a silent wake over Yussuf Dakmar, keeping some\nmore of the doped whisky ready in case he should look like recovering\ntoo soon.  I even searched him, finding nothing worthy of note, except\nthat he had remarkably little money.  I expect the poor devil was a\npenny ante villain scheming for a thousand-dollar jackpot.  I felt\nreally sorry for him and turned him over with my boot to let him breathe\nbetter.\n\nA little before dawn I awakened Grim and Jeremy and we left the room\nquietly after I had scratched on the closet door with my fingernails.\nPausing outside to listen, we heard the closet door being opened\nstealthily from the far side.  I caught Grim's eye, thinking he would\nsmile back, but he looked as deadly serious as I have ever seen him.\n\n\"You made a bad break that time,\" he said when we had gone downstairs.\n\"Never give away information unless you're getting a return for it!  If\nyou'd left Yussuf Dakmar to scratch that door after he recovered\nconsciousness, he'd have invented a pack of lies to tell his friends,\nand they'd have been no wiser than before.  Now they'll know he never\nscratched it.  They'll deduce, unless they're lunatics, that someone\noverheard their conference last night and knew the signal.  That'll make\nthem desperate. They'll waste no more time on finesse.  They'll use\nviolence at the first chance after the train leaves Haifa.\"\n\n\"Rammy's like me;  he hates not to have an audience for his tricks,\" put\nin Jeremy by way of consolation.\n\n\"We've got to stage a new play, that's all,\" said Grim.  \"I'd have the\nlot of them arrested, but all the good that would do would be to inform\nthe man higher up, who'd tip off another gang by wire to wait for us\nover the border.  Say, suppose we all three bear this in mind:  No play\nto the gallery!  That's where secret service differs from other\nbusiness.  Applause means failure.  The better the work you do, the less\nyou can afford to admit you did it.  You mustn't even smile at a man\nyou've scored off.  Half the game is to leave him guessing who it was\nthat tripped him up.  The safest course is to see that someone else gets\ncredit for everything you do.\"\n\n\"Consume your own smoke, eh?\" suggested Jeremy.\n\n\"That and more,\" Grim answered.  \"You've got to work like Hell for\nwhat'll do you no good, because the moment it brings you recognition it\ndestroys your usefulness.  You mayn't even amuse yourself;  you have to\nlet the game amuse you, without turning one trick for the sake of an\nextra smile;  most of the humor comes in anyhow, from knowing more than\nthe other fellow thinks you do.  The more a man lies the less you want\nto contradict him, because if you do he'll know that you know he's lying\nand that's giving away information, which is the unforgivable sin.\"\n\n\"Golly!\" exclaimed Jeremy.  \"Your trade wouldn't suit me, Jim! When\ndoing tricks, it's good to watch folks' eyes pop open.  What tickles my\nwish-bone is what I can see for myself on their silly faces, half of 'em\ntrying to look as if they know how it's done and the other half all\ngrins.  I did tricks for a Scotchman once, who got so angry I thought\nhe'd hit me;  he said, what I did was impossible, so I did it again and\nhe still said it was impossible, and he ended by calling me a 'puir\ndementit men.' That was my apogee;  I've never reached that height\nsince, not even when I first made a camel say prayers at Abu Keen and\nthe Arabs hailed me as a prophet!  Bread's good, but it's better with\nthe butter on it right side up!\"\n\n\"Not in this game, it isn't,\" answered Grim.  \"If your bread seems\nsmeared with butter that's a sure sign it's dangerous.  For God's sake,\nas long as you stay in the game with me don't play to the gallery,\neither of you!  Let's order breakfast.\"\n\nIt was the longest lecture and expression of opinion I had ever listened\nto from James Schuyler Grim, and though I've turned it over in my mind a\ngreat deal since, I can't discover anything but wisdom in it.  I believe\nhe told Jeremy and me the secret of power that morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\"They are all right!\"\n\n\nThere was no competition for seats on the Damascus train that morning.\nSeveral of the window-panes were smashed, there were bullet-marks and\nsplinters on the woodwork everywhere--no need to ask questions.  But I\nfound time on the platform to chat with some British officers while\nkeeping an eye lifting for Yussuf Dakmar and his friends.\n\n\"Damascus, eh?  You'll have a fine journey if you get through alive.\nNine passengers were shot dead in the last train down.\"\n\n\"No law up there, you know.  Feisul's army's all concentrated for a\ncrack at the French (good luck to 'em!  No, I'm not wishing the French\nany particular luck this trip).  Nobody to watch the Bedouins, so they\ntake pot shots at every train that passes, just for the fun of it.\"\n\n\"May be war, you know, at any minute.  The French are sure to make a\ndrive for the railway line--you'll be hung up indefinitely--commandeered\nfor an ambulance train--shot for the sake of argument--anything at all,\nin fact.  They say those Algerian troops are getting out of hand--paid\nin depreciated francs and up against the high cost of debauchery.\nYou're taking a chance.\"\n\n\"Wish I could go.  Haven't seen a healthy scrap sinze Zeitun Ridge.\nHey!  Hullo!  What's this?  Lovely woman!  Well, I'll be!\"\n\nIt was Mabel Ticknor, followed by the six men I was watching for, Yussuf\nDakmar looking sulky and discouraged in their midst, almost like a\nprisoner, and the other five wearing palpably innocent expressions.\n\n\"Lord!\" remarked the officer nearest me.  \"That gang's got the wind up!\nLook at the color of their gills!  Booked through, I'll bet you, and\nbeen listening to tales all night!\"\n\nThe gang drew abreast just as another officer gave tongue to his\nopinion.  They couldn't help hearing what he said;  he had one of those\nvoices that can carry on conversation in a boiler foundry.\n\n\"There's more in this than meets the eye!  She's not a nurse. She don't\nwalk like a missionary.  I heard her buy a ticket for Aleppo.  Can you\nimagine a lone, good-looking woman going to Aleppo by that train unless\nshe had a laissez passe from the French?  She's wearing French heels.\nI'll bet she's carrying secret information.  Look!  D'you see those two\nArabs in the train?\"  He pointed out Grim and Jeremy, who were leaning\nfrom a window.  \"They tipped her off to get into the compartment next\nahead of them.  D'you see?  There she goes.  She was for getting into\nthe coach ahead.  They called her back.\"\n\nAlmost all the other cars were empty except that one, but, whether\nbecause humans are like sheep and herd together instinctively when\nafraid, or because the train crew ordered it, all six compartments of\nthe middle first-class car were now occupied, with Mabel Ticknor alone\nin the front one. Nevertheless, Yussuf Dakmar and four of his companions\nstarted to climb in by the rear door.  The sixth man lingered within\nearshot of the officers, presumably to pick up further suggestions.\n\nSo I got in at the front end and met them halfway down the corridor.\n\n\"Plenty of room in the car behind,\" I said abruptly.\n\nThey were five to one, but Yussuf Dakmar was in front, and he merely got\nin the way of the wolves behind him.  The sixth man, who had lingered\nnear the officers, now entered by the front end as I had done and called\nout that there was plenty of room in the front compartment.\n\n\"There's only a woman in here,\" he said in Arabic.\n\nAnd he set the example by taking the seat opposite to Mabel.\n\nIt would have been easy enough to get him out again, of course. Not even\nthe polyglot train crew would have allowed Arabs to trespass without her\ninvitation.\n\nThe trouble was that Jeremy, Grim, Narayan Singh and I all rushed to her\nrescue at the same minute, which let the cat out of the bag.  It was\nDoctor Ticknor's statement in Jerusalem about not wanting to see any of\nus alive again if we failed to bring his wife back safe that turned the\ntrick and caused even Grim to lose his head for a moment.  When a Sikh,\ntwo obvious Arabs and an American all rush to a woman's assistance\nbefore she calls for help, there is evidence of collusion somewhere\nwhich you could hardly expect a trained spy to overlook or fail to draw\nconclusions from.\n\nIt was all over in a minute.  The rascal left the compartment, muttering\nto himself in Arabic sotto voce.  I caught one word; but he looked so\ndiabolically pleased with himself that it didn't really need that to\nstir me into action.  I take twelves in boots, with a rather broad toe,\nand he stopped the full heft of the hardest kick I could let loose.  It\nput him out of action for half a day, and remains one of my pleasantest\nmemories.\n\nHis companions had to gather him up and help him pulley-hauley fashion\ninto the car ahead, while an officious ticket-taker demanded my name and\naddress.  I found in my wallet the card of a U.S. senator and gave him\nthat, whereat he apologized profoundly and addressed me as \"Colonel\"--a\ntitle with which he continued to flatter me all the rest of the journey\nexcept once, when he changed it to \"Admiral\" by mistake.\n\nGrim went back into our compartment and laughed;  and none of the essays\nI have read on laughter--not even the famous dissertation by Josh\nBillings--throw light on how to describe the tantalizing manner of it.\nHe laughs several different ways:  heartily at times, as men of my\ntemperament mostly do;  boisterously on occasion, after Jeremy's\nfashion;  now and then cryptically, using laughter as a mask;  then he\nowns a smile that suggests nothing more nor less than kindness based on\nunderstanding of human nature.\n\nBut that other is a devil of a laugh, mostly made of chuckles that seem\nto bubble off a Hell-brew of disillusionment, and you get the impression\nthat he is laughing at himself--cynically laying bare the vanity and\nfallibility of his own mental processes--and forecasting\nself-discipline.\n\nThere is no mirth in it, although there is amusement;  no anger,\nalthough immeasurable scorn.  I should say it's a good safe laugh to\nindulge in, for I think it is based on ability to see himself and his\nown mistakes more clearly than anybody else can, and there is no note of\ndefeat in it.  But it is full of a cruel irony that brings to mind a\nvision of one of those old medieval flagellant priests reviewing his\nsins before thrashing his own body with a wire whip.\n\n\"So that ends that,\" he said at last, with the gesture of a man who\nsweeps the pieces from a board, to set them up anew and start again.\n\"Luckily we're not the only fools in Asia.  Those six rascals know now\nthat Mabel and we are one party.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" sneered Jeremy.  \"What can the devils do?\"\n\n\"Not much this side of the border at Deraa,\" Grim answered. \"After Deraa\npretty well what they're minded.  They could have us pinched on some\ntrumped-up charge, in which case we'd be searched, Mabel included.  No.\nWe've played too long on the defensive.  Deraa is the danger-point.  The\ntelegraph line is cut there, and all messages going north or south have\nto be carried by hand across the border.  The French have an agent there\nwho censors everything.  He's the boy we've got to fool.  If they appeal\nto him this train will go on without us.\n\n\"Ramsden, you and Narayan Singh go and sit with Mabel in her\ncompartment.  Jeremy, you go forward and bring Yussuf Dakmar back here\nto me;  we'll let him have that fake letter just before we reach Deraa,\ntaking care somehow to let the other five know he has it.  They won't\ndiscover it's a fake until after leaving Deraa--\"\n\n\"Why not?\" I interrupted.  \"What's to prevent their opening it at once?\"\n\n\n\"Two good reasons:  for one, we'll have Narayan Singh keep a careful eye\non them, and they'll keep it hidden as long as he snoops around;  for\nanother, they'll be delighted not to have to let the French agent at\nDeraa into the secret, because of the higher price they hope to get by\nholding on.  They'll smuggle it over the border and not open it until\nthey feel safe.\"\n\n\"Yes, but when they do look at it ...\" said I.\n\n\"We'll be over the border, and they can't send telegrams to anywhere.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"An Arab government precaution.  If station agents all along the line\nwere allowed to send telegrams every seditious upstart would take\nadvantage of it and they'd have more trouble than they've got now.  But\nI warn you fellows, after Deraa--somewhere between the border and\nDamascus--there'll be a fight.  The minute they discover that the letter\nis a fake they'll come for the real one like cats after a canary.\"\n\n\"Let 'em come!\" smiled Jeremy, but Grim shook his head.  \"I've been\nmaking that mistake too long,\" he answered.  \"No defensive tactics after\nwe leave Deraa!  We'll start the trouble ourselves. You watch, after\nDeraa the train crew will play cards in the caboose and leave Allah to\ncare for the passengers.\"\n\n\"There's only one thing troubles me,\" said Jeremy.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Narayan Singh got Yussuf Dakmar's shirt night before last.  I've had it\nin for Yussuf ever since we Anzacs went hungry on account of him.\nAnyone who scuppers him has got me to beat to him.  He's my meat, and I\ngive you all notice!\"\n\nIt isn't good to stand between an Anzac and the punishment he thinks an\nenemy deserves.\n\n\"All the same,\" Grim answered, smiling, \"I'll bet you don't get him,\nJeremy.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you.  How much?\"\n\n\"Mind you, when the game begins, you have a free hand,\" Grim went on.\n\n\"All right,\" answered Jeremy, who loves freak bets, ''if I get him you\nquit the Army soon as this job's done, and join up with Rammy and me:\nif I don't I'll stay and help you on the next job.\"\n\n\"That's a bet,\" said Grim promptly.\n\nSo Jeremy went forward to play at being traitor, while Narayan Singh and\nI kept Mabel company.  She fired questions at us right and left for\ntwenty minutes, which we had to answer in detail instead of straining\nour cars to catch what Grim and Jeremy might be saying to Yussuf Dakmar\nin the next compartment.\n\nWhatever they did say, they managed to prolong the interview until\nwithin ten minutes of Deraa, when the Syrian returned to his companions\nsmiling smugly and Narayan Singh strode after him, to stand in the\ncorridor and by ostentatiously watching them prevent their examining the\nletter.\n\nGrim and Jeremy, all grins, joined us at once in Mabel's compartment.\n\n\"Did you see the devil smirk as he went off with it?\" asked Jeremy.\n\"Golly, he thinks we're fools!  The theory is that we two had betrayed\nyou, Rammy, and swapped the letter against his bare promise to pay us in\nDamascus.  He chucked in a little blackmail about sicking his mates on\nto murder us if we didn't come across, and I tell you we fairly love\nhim!  Lordy, here's Deraa!  If they open the thing before the train\nleaves, Grim says the lot of us are to bolt back across the border, send\nMabel home to her husband, and continue the journey by camel.  That\nright, Grim?\"\n\nGrim nodded.  It was Mabel who objected.\n\n\"I'm going to see this through,\" she answered.  \"Guess again, boys!  My\nhair's gone gray.  You owe me a real adventure now, and I won't give up\nthe letter till you've paid!\"\n\nWe had one first-class scare when the train drew up in the squalid\nstation, where the branch line to Haifa meets the main Hedjaz railway\nand the two together touch a mean town at a tangent;  for a French\nofficer in uniform boarded the train and stalked down the corridors\nstaring hard at everyone.  He asked me for a passport, which was sheer\nbluff, so I asked him in turn for his own authority.  He smiled and\nproduced a rubber stamp, saying that if I wished to visit Beirut or\nAleppo I must get a vise from him.\n\n\"Je m'em bien garderai!\" I answered.  \"I'm going to see my aunt at\nDamascus.\"\n\n\"And this lady?  Is she your wife?\"\n\nI laughed aloud--couldn't help it.  All the Old Testament stories keep\nforcing themselves on your memory in that land, and the legend of\nAbraham trying to pass his wife off as his sister and the three-cornered\ndrama that came of it cropped up as fresh as yesterday.  There was no\nneed that I could see to repeat the patriarch's mistake, any more than\nthere was reasonable basis for the Frenchman's impertinence.\n\n\"Is that your business?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Because,\" he went on, smiling meanly, \"you speak with an American\naccent.  It is against the law to carry gold across the border, and\nAmericans have to submit to personal search, because they always carry\nit.\"\n\n\"Show me your authority!\" I retorted angrily.\n\n\"Oh, as for that, there is a customs official here who has full\nauthority.  He is a Syrian.  It occurred to me that you might prefer to\nbe searched by a European.\"\n\n\"Call his bluff!\" Grim whispered behind his sleeve, but I intended to do\nthat, anyway.\n\n\"Bring along your Syrian,\" said I, and off he went to do it, treating me\nto a backward glance over his shoulder that conveyed more than words\ncould have done.\n\n\"He'll bluff sky-high,\" said Grim, \"but keep on calling him.\"\n\n\"I've been searched at six frontiers,\" said Mabel.  \"If it's a Syrian I\ndon't much mind;  you boys all come along, and he'll behave himself.\nThey're much worse in France and Italy.  Hadn't one of you better take\nthe letter, though?  No!  I was forgetting already!  I won't part with\nit.  I'll take my chance with the Syrian;  he'll only ask me to empty my\npockets and prove that I haven't a bag full of gold under my skirt.  Sit\ntight, all, here he comes!\"\n\nThe Frenchman returned with a smiling, olive-complexioned Syrian in tow\n--a round-faced fellow with blue jaws as dark as his serge uniform.  The\nFrenchman stood aside and the Syrian announced rather awkwardly that\nregulations compelled him to submit Mabel and me to the inconvenience of\nsearch.\n\n\"For what?\" said I.\n\n\"For gold,\" he answered.  \"It is against the law to smuggle it across\nthe border.\"\n\n\"I've only one gold coin,\" I said, showing him a U.S. twenty-dollar\npiece, and his yellow eyes shone at sight of it.  \"If it will save\ntrouble you may have it.\"\n\nI put it into his open palm with the Frenchman looking on, and it was\nimmediately clear that that particular Syrian official was no longer\namenable to international intrigue.  He was bought and sold--oozy with\ngratitude--incapable of anything but wild enthusiasm for the U.S.A. for\nseveral hours to come.\n\n\"I have searched them!\" said he to the French officer.  \"They have no\ngold, and they are all right.\"\n\nThe French have faults like the rest of us, but they are quicker than\nmost men to recognize logic.  The man with crimson pants and sabre\ngrinned cynically, shrugged his shoulders, and passed on to annoy\nsomebody easier.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\"Start something before they're ready for it!\"\n\n\nJust before the train started, a handsome fellow with short black beard\ntrimmed into a point and wearing a well-cut European blue serge suit,\nbut none the less obviously an Arab, came to the door of our compartment\nand stared steadily at Grim.  He stood like a fighting man, as if every\nmuscle of his body was under command, and the suggestion was\nstrengthened by what might be a bullet scar over one eye.\n\nIf that fellow had asked me for a loan on the spot, or for help against\nhis enemies, he would have received both or either. Moreover, if he had\nnever paid me back I would still believe in him, and would bet on him\nagain.\n\nHowever, after one swift glance at him, Grim took no notice until the\ntrain was under way--not even then in fact, until the man in blue serge\nspoke first.\n\n\"Oh, Jimgrim!\" he said suddenly in a voice like a tenor bell.\n\n\"Come in, Hadad,\" Grim answered, hardly glancing at him.  \"Make yourself\nat home.\"\n\nHe tossed a valise into the rack, and I gave up the corner seat so that\nhe might sit facing Grim, he acknowledging the courtesy with a smile\nlike the whicker of a sword-blade, wasting no time on foolish protest.\nHe knew what he wanted--knew enough to take it when invited--understood\nme, and expected me to understand him--a first-class fellow.  He sat\nleaning a little forward, his back not touching the cushion, with the\npalms of both hands resting on his knees and strong fingers motionless.\nHe eyed Mabel Ticknor, not exactly nervously but with caution.\n\n\"Any news?\" asked Grim.\n\n\"Jimgrim, the world is full of it!\" he answered in English with a laugh.\n\"But who are these?\"\n\n\"My friends.\"\n\n\"Your intimate friends?\" Grim nodded.\n\n\"The lady as well?\" Grim nodded again.\n\n\"That is very strong recommendation, Jimgrim!\"\n\nGrim introduced us, giving Jeremy's name as Jmil Ras.\n\n\"Hah!  I have heard of you,\" said Hadad, staring at him.  \"The\nAustralian who wandered all over Arabia?  I am probably the only Arab\nwho knew what you really were.  Do you recall that time at Wady Hafiz\nwhen a local priest denounced you and a Sheik in a yellow kuffiyi told\nthe crowd that he knew you for a prophet?  I am the same Sheik.  I liked\nyour pluck.  I often wondered what became of you.\"\n\n\"Put it here!\" said Jeremy, and they shook hands.\n\nFor twenty minutes after that Hadad and Jeremy swapped reminiscences in\nquick staccato time.  It was like two Gatling guns playing a duet, and\nthe score was about equally intelligible to anyone unfamiliar with\nArabia's hinterland--which is to say to all except about one person in\nten million.  It was most of it Greek to me, but Grim listened like an\noperator to the ticking of the Morse code.  It was Hadad who cut it\nshort;  Jeremy would have talked all the way to Damascus.\n\n\"And so, Jimgrim, do the kites foregather?  Or are we a forlorn hope?\nDo we go to bury Feisul or to crown him king?\"\n\n\"How much do you know?\" Grim answered.\n\n\"Hah!  More than you, my friend!  I come from Europe--London--Paris--\nRome.  I stopped off in Deraa to listen a while, where the tide of\nrumour flows back and forth across the border.  The English are in\nfavour of Feisul, and would help him if they could.  The French are\nagainst him and would rather have him a dead saint than a living\nnuisance.  The most disturbing rumour I have heard was here in Deraa, to\nthe effect that Feisul sent a letter to Jerusalem calling on all Moslems\nto rise and massacre the Jews.  That does not sound like Feisul, but the\nFrench agent in Deraa assured me that he will have the original letter\nin his hands within a day or two.\"\n\nGrim smiled over at Mabel.\n\n\"You might show him the letter?\" he suggested.\n\nSo Mabel dug down into the mysteries beneath her shirtwaist and produced\nthe document wrapped in a medical bandage of oiled silk. Hadad unwrapped\nit, read it carefully, and handed it to Grim.\n\n\"Are you deceived by that?\" he asked.  \"Does Feisul speak like that, or\nwrite like that?  Since when has he turned coward that he should sign\nhis name with a number?\"\n\n\"What do you make of it?\" asked Grim.\n\n\"Hah!  It is as plain as the ink on the paper.  It is intended for use\nagainst Feisul, first by making the British suspicious of him, second by\nproviding the French with an excuse to attack him, third by convicting\nhim of treachery, for which he can be jailed or executed after he is\ncaught.  What do you propose to do with it, Jimgrim?\"\n\n\"I'm going to show it to Feisul.\"\n\n\"Good!  I, too, am on my way to see Feisul.  Perhaps the two of us\ntogether can convince him what is best.\"\n\n\"If we two first agree,\" Grim answered with a dry smile.\n\n\"Do you agree that two and two make four?  This is just as simple,\nJimgrim.  Feisul cannot contend with the French.  The financiers have\nspread their net for Syria, Feisul has no artillery worth speaking of--\nno gas--no masks against gas, and the French have plenty of everything\nexcept money.  Syria has been undermined by propaganda and corruption.\nLet Feisul go to British territory and thence to Europe, where his\nfriends may have a chance to work for him.  The British will give him\nMesopotamia, and after that it will be up to us Arabs to prove we are a\nnation.  That is my argument.  Are we agreed?\"\n\n\"If that's your plan, Hadad, I'm with you!\" Grim answered.\n\n\"Then I also am with you!  Let us shake hands.\"\n\n\"Shwai shwai!\" (Go slow!) said Grim.  \"Better join up with me in\nDamascus.  There are six men in the car ahead who'll try to murder us\nall presently.  They've got a letter that they think is that one.  The\nminute they find out we've fooled them there'll be ructions.\"\n\n\"I am good at ructions!\" Hadad answered.\n\n\"My friend Narayan Singh is forward watching them,\" said Grim. \"What\nthey'll probably try when they make the discovery will be to have the\nlot of us arrested at some wayside station.  I propose to forestall\nthem.\"\n\n\"I am good at forestalling!\" said Hadad.\n\n\"Then don't you forestall me!\" laughed Jeremy.  \"The fellow with a face\nlike a pig's stern is Yussuf Dakmar, and he's my special preserve.\"\n\n\"I am a good Moslem.  I refuse to lay hand on pig,\" said Hadad, smiling.\n\nWe discussed Feisul and the Arab cause.\n\n\"Oh, if we had Lawrence with us!\" exclaimed Hadad excitedly at last.  \"A\nlittle, little man--hardly any larger than Mrs. Ticknor--but a David\nagainst Goliath!  And would you believe it?--there is an idiotic rumour\nthat Lawrence has returned and is hiding in Damascus!  The French are\nreally disturbed about it. They have cabled their Foreign Office and\nreceived an official denial of the rumour;  but official denials carry\nno weight nowadays.  Out of ten Frenchmen in Syria, five believe that\nLawrence is with Feisul and if they can catch him he will get short\nshrift.  But, oh, Jimgrim--oh, if it were true!  Wallahi!\"\n\nGrim didn't answer, but I saw him look long at Jeremy, and then for\nabout thirty seconds steadily at Mabel Ticknor.  After that he stared\nout of the window for a long time, not even moving his head when a crowd\nof Bedouins galloped to within fifty yards of the train and volleyed at\nit from horseback \"merely out of devilment,\" as Hadad hastened to assure\nus.\n\nWe were winding up the Lebanon Valley by that time.  Carpets of flowers;\ngreen grass;  waterfalls;  a thatched hut to the twenty square miles,\nwith a scattering of mean black tents between; every stone building in\nruins;  goats where fat kine ought to be; and a more or less modern\nrailway screeching across the landscape, short of fuel and oil.  That's\nLebanon.\n\nWe grew depressed.  Then silent.  Our meditations were interrupted by\nthe sudden arrival of Narayan Singh in the door of the compartment,\ngrinning full of news.\n\n\"They have opened the letter, sahib!  They accuse Yussuf Dakmar of\ndeceiving them.  They threaten him with death.  Shall I interfere?\"\n\n\"Any sign of the train crew?\" Grim asked.\n\n\"Nay, they are gambling in the brake-van.\"\n\nGrim looked sharply at Hadad.\n\n\"What authority have you got?\"\n\n\"None.  I am a personal friend of Feisul, that is all.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll pretend you've power to arrest them.  Ramsden, you've\nsuddenly missed your letter.  You've accused Jeremy of stealing it.  He\nhas confessed to selling it to Yussuf Dakmar. Go forward in a rage and\ndemand the letter back.  Start something before they're ready for it!\nWe'll be just behind you.\"\n\n\"Leave Yussuf Dakmar to me!\" insisted Jeremy.  \"I pay the debt of an\nAnzac division!\"\n\nI hope I've never hurt a man who didn't deserve it, or who wasn't fit to\nfight;  but I have to admit that Grim didn't need to repeat the\ninvitation.  I started forward in a hurry, and Jeremy elbowed Narayan\nSingh aside in order to follow next, Australians being notoriously\nunlady-like performers when anybody's hat is in the ring.\n\nBy the time I reached the car ahead the train had entered a wild gorge\ncircle by one of those astonishing hairpin curves with which engineers\ndefeat Nature.  The panting engine slowed almost to a snail's pace,\nhaving only a scant fuel ration with which to negotiate curve and grade\ncombined.  To our right there was a nearly sheer drop of four hundred\nfeet, with a stream at the bottom boiling among limestone boulders.\n\nBut there was no time to study scenery.  From the middle compartment of\nthe car there came yells for help and the peculiar noise of thump and\nscuffle that can't be mistaken.  Men fight in various ways, Lord knows,\nand the worst are the said-to-be civilized;  but from Nome to Cape Town\nand all the way from China to Peru the veriest tenderfoot can tell in\nthe dark the difference between fight and horseplay.\n\nI reached the door of the compartment in time to see three of them (two\nbleeding from knife-wounds in the face) force Yussuf Dakmar backward\ntoward the window, the whole lot stabbing frantically as they milled and\nswayed.  The fifth man was holding on to the scrimmage with his left\nhand and reaching round with his right, trying to stick a knife into\nYussuf Dakmar's ribs without endangering his own hide.\n\nBut the sixth man was the rascal I had kicked.  He had no room--perhaps\nno inclination--to get into the scrimmage;  so he saw me first, and he\nneeded no spur to his enmity.  With a movement as quick as a cat's and\npresence of mind that accounted for his being leader of the gang, he\nseized the fifth man by the neck and spun him round to call his\nattention;  and the two came for me together like devils out of a\nspring-trap.\n\nNow the narrow door of a compartment on a train isn't any kind of easy\nplace to fight in, but I vow and declare that Jeremy and I both did our\nbest for Yussuf Dakmar.  That's a remarkable thing if you come to think\nof it.  As a dirty murderer--thief--liar--traitor--spy, he hadn't much\nclaim on our affections and Jeremy cherished a war-grudge against him on\ntop of it all.  What is it that makes us side with the bottom dog\nregardless of pros and cons?\n\nIt was a nasty mix-up, because they used knives and we relied on hands\nand fists.  I've used a pick-handle on occasion and a gun when I've had\nto, but speaking generally it seems to me to demean a white man to use\nweapons in a row like that, and I find that most fellows who have walked\nthe earth much agree with me.\n\nWe tried to go in like a typhoon, shock-troop style, but it didn't work.\nAnother man let go of Yussuf Dakmar, who was growing weak and too short\nof wind to yell, and in a moment there were five of us struggling on the\nfloor between the seats, one man under me with my forearm across his\nthroat and another alongside me, stabbing savagely at a leather valise\nunder the impression that he was carving up my ribs.  On top of that\nmess Narayan Singh pounced like a tiger, wrenching at arms and legs\nuntil I struggled to my feet again--only to be thrust aside by Jeremy as\nhe rose and rushed at Yussuf Dakmar's two assailants.\n\nBut with all his speed Jeremy was a tenth of a tick too late. The wretch\nwas already helpless, and I dare say they broke his back as they leaned\ntheir combined weight on him and forced him backward and head-first\nthrough the window.  Jeremy made a grab for his foot, but missed it, and\na knife-blade already wet with Yussuf Dakmar's blood whipped out and\nstung him in the thigh. That, of course, was sheer ignorance.  You\nshould never sting an Australian.  Kill him or let him alone.  Better\nyet, make friends with him or surrender;  but, above all, do nothing by\nhalves. They're a race of whole-hoggers, equally ready to force their\nonly shirt on you or fight you to a finish.\n\nSo Jeremy finished the business at the window.  He took a neck in each\nhand and cracked their skulls together until the whack-whack-whack of it\nwas like the exhaust of a Ford with loose piston rings;  and when they\nfell from his grip, unconscious, he came to my rescue.  Believe me, I\nneeded it.\n\nThey were as strong and lithe as wildcats, those Syrians, and fully\nawake to the advantage that the narrow door gave them.  One man\nstruggled with Narayan Singh and kept him busy with his bulk so wedged\nacross the opening that Grim and Hadad were as good as demobilized out\nin the corridor;  and the other two tackled me like a pair of butchers\nhacking at a maddened bull.  I landed with my fists, but each time at\nthe cost of a flesh-wound;  and though I got one knife-hand by the wrist\nand hung on, wrenching and screwing to throw the fellow off his feet,\nthe other man's right was free and the eighteen-inch Erzeram dagger that\nhe held danced this and that way for an opening underneath my guard.\n\nJeremy's left fist landed under the peak of his jaw exactly at the\nmoment when he stiffened to launch his thrust.  He fell as if pole-axed\nand the blade missed my stomach by six inches, but the combined force of\nthrust and blow was great enough to drive the weapon into the wooden\npartition, where it stayed until I pulled it out to keep as a souvenir.\n\nThere wasn't much trouble after that.  Grim and Hadad came in and we\ntore strips from the Syrians' clothing to tie their hands and feet with.\nHadad went to the rear of the train, climbing along the footboard of the\nthird-class cars to the caboose to throw some sort of bluff to the\nconductor, who came forward--called me \"Colonel\" and Hadad \"Excellency\"\n--looked our prisoners over--recognized no friends--and said that\neverything was \"quite all right.\"  He said he knew exactly what to do;\nbut we left Narayan Singh on watch, lest that knowledge should prove too\noriginal which, however, it turned out not to be.  It was bromidian--as\nold as history.  Narayan Singh came back and told us.\n\n\"Lo, sahib;  he went through their clothes as an ape for fleas, I\nwatching.  And when he had all their valuables he laid them on the\nfootboard, and then, as we passed some Bedouin tents, he kicked them\noff.  But he seems an honest fellow, for he gave them back some small\nchange to buy food with, should any be obtainable.\"\n\nAfter that he stood flashing his white teeth for half an hour watching\nMabel bandage Jeremy and me, for it always amuses a Sikh to watch a\nwhite man eat punishment.  Sikhs are a fine race--but curious--\ndistinctly curious and given to unusual amusement.  When Mabel had\nfinished with me at last I stuck a needle into him, and he laughed,\naccepting the stab as a compliment.\n\nA strange thing is how men settle down after excitement.  Birds do the\nsame thing.  A hawk swoops down on a hedgerow;  there is a great\nflutter, followed by sudden silence.  A minute later the chattering\nbegins again, without any reference to one of their number being torn in\nthe plunderer's beak.  And so we;  even Grim loosened up and gossiped\nabout Feisul and the already ancient days when Feisul was the up-to-date\nSaladin leading Arab hosts to victory.\n\nBut there was an even stranger circumstance than that.  We weren't the\nonly people in the train;  our car, for instance, was fairly well\noccupied by Armenians, Arabs, and folk whose vague nationality came\nunder the general heading of Levantine.  The car ahead where the fight\ntook place, though not crowded, wasn't vacant, and there were others in\nthe car behind.  Yet not one of them made a move to interfere.  They\nminded their own business, which proves, I think, that manners are based\nmainly on discretion.\n\nAs the train gasped slowly up the grade and rolled bumpily at last along\nthe fertile, neglected Syrian highland, all the Armenians on the train\nremoved their hats and substituted the red tarboosh, preferring the\nheadgear of a convert rather than be the target of every Bedouin with a\nrifle in his hand.\n\nThe whole journey was a mix-up of things to wonder at--not least of them\nthe matter-of-fact confidence with which the train proceeded along a\nsingle track, whose condition left you wondering at each bump whether\nthe next wouldn't be the journey's violent end.  There were lamps, but\nno oil for light when evening came.  Once, when we bumped over a shaky\nculvert and a bushel or two of coal-dust fell from the rusty tender, the\nengineer stopped the train and his assistant went back with a shovel and\npiece of sacking to gather up the precious stuff.\n\nThere was nothing but squalid villages and ruins, goats and an\noccasional rare camel to be seen through the window--not a tree\nanywhere, the German General Staff having attended to that job\nthoroughly.  There is honey in the country and it's plentiful as well as\ngood, because bees are not easy property to raid and make away with;\nbut the milk is from goats, and as for overflowing, I would hate to have\nto punish the dugs of a score of the brutes to get a jugful for dinner.\nSyria's wealth is of the past and the future.\n\nLong before it grew too dark to watch the landscape we were wholly\nconverted to Grim's argument that Syria was no place for a man of\nFeisul's calibre.  The Arab owners of the land are plundered to the\nbone;  the men with money are foreigners, whose only care is for a\ngovernment that will favour this religion and that breed.  To set up a\nkingdom there would be like preaching a new religion in Hester Street;\nyou could hand out text, soup and blankets, but you'd need a whale's\nsupply of faith to carry on, and the offertories wouldn't begin to meet\nexpenses.\n\nUntil that journey finally convinced me, I had been wondering all the\nwhile in the back of my head whether Grim wasn't intending an\nimpertinence.  It hasn't been my province hitherto to give advice to\nkings;  for one thing, they haven't asked me for it.  If I were asked, I\nthink I'd take the problem pretty seriously and hesitate before\nsuggesting to a man on whom the hope of fifty million people rests that\nhe'd better pull up stakes and eat crow in exile for the present.  I'd\nnaturally hate to be a king, but if I were one I don't think quitting\nwould look good, and I think I'd feel like kicking the fellow who\nsuggested it.\n\nBut the view from the train, and Grim's talk with Hadad put me in a mood\nin which Syria didn't seem good enough for a soap-box politician, let\nalone a man of Feisul's fame and character.  And when at last a few\nlights in a cluster down the track proclaimed that we were drawing near\nDamascus, I was ready to advise everybody, Feisul included, to get out\nin a hurry while a chance remained.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\"Bismillah!  What a mercy that I met you!\"\n\n\nWhile the fireman scraped the iron floor for his last two shovelfuls of\ncoal-dust and the train wheezed wearily into the dark station, Grim\nbegan to busy himself in mysterious ways.  Part of his own costume\nconsisted of a short, curved scimitar attached to an embroidered belt--\nthe sort of thing that Arabs wear for ornament rather than use.  He took\nit off and, groping in the dark, helped Mabel put it on, without a word\nof explanation.\n\nThen, instead of putting on his own Moslem over-cloak he threw that over\nher shoulders and, digging down into his bag for a spare head-dress,\nsnatched her hat off and bound on the white kerchief in its place with\nthe usual double, gold-covered cord of camel-hair.\n\nThen came my friend the train conductor and addressed me as Colonel,\noffering to carry out the bags.  The moment he had grabbed his load and\ngone Grim broke silence:\n\n\"Call her Colonel and me Grim.  Don't forget how!\"\n\nWe became aware of faces under helmets peering through the window-\nofficers of Feisul's army on the watch for unwelcome visitors.  From\nbehind them came the conductor's voice again, airing his English:\n\n\"Any more bags inside there, Colonel?\"\n\n\"Get out quick, Jeremy, and make a fuss about the Colonel coming!\"\nordered Grim.\n\nJeremy suddenly became the arch-efficient servitor, establishing\nimportance for his chief, and never a newly made millionaire or modern\ndemagog had such skillful advertisement.  The Shereefian officers stood\nback at a respectful distance, ready to salute when the personage should\ndeign to alight.\n\n\"What shall be done with the memsahib's hat?\" demanded Narayan Singh.\n\nYou could only see the whites of his eyes, but he shook something in his\nright hand.\n\n\"Eat it!\" Grim answered.\n\n\"Heavens! That's my best hat!\" objected Mabel.  \"Give it here. I'll\ncarry it under the cloak.\"\n\n\"Get rid of it!\" Grim ordered;  and Narayan Singh strode off to\ncontribute yellow Leghorn straw and poppies to the engine furnace.\n\nI gave him ten piastres to fee the engineer, and five for the fireman,\nso you might say that was high-priced fuel.\n\n\"What kind of bunk are you throwing this time?\" I asked Grim.\n\nHe didn't answer, but gave orders to Mabel in short, crisp syllables.\n\n\"You're Colonel Lawrence.  Answer no questions.  If anyone salutes, just\nmove your hand and bow your head a bit.  You're just his height.  Look\nstraight in front of you and take long strides.  Bend your head forward\na little;  there, that's it.\"\n\n\"I'm scared!\" announced Mabel, by way of asking for more particulars.\n\nShe wasn't scared in the least.\n\n\"Piffle!\" Grim answered.  \"Remember you're Lawrence, that's all. They'd\ngive you Damascus if you asked for it.  Follow Jeremy, and leave the\nrest to us.\"\n\nI don't doubt that Grim had been turning over the whole plan in his mind\nfor hours past, but when I taxed him with it afterward his reply was\ncharacteristic:\n\n\"If we'd rehearsed it, Mabel and Hadad would both have been\nself-conscious.  The game is to study your man--or woman, as the case\nmay be--and sometimes drill 'em, sometimes spring it on 'em, according\nto circumstances.  The only rule is to study people; there are no two\nquite alike.\"\n\nHadad was surprised into silence, too thoughtful a man to do anything\nexcept hold his tongue until the next move should throw more light on\nthe situation.  He followed us out of the car, saying nothing;  and\nbeing recognized by the light of one dim lantern as an intimate friend\nof Feisul, he accomplished all that Grim could have asked of him.\n\nHe was known to have been in Europe until recently.  Rumours about\nLawrence had been tossed from mouth to mouth for days past, and here was\nsomebody who looked like Lawrence in the dark, followed by Grim and\nHadad and addressed as \"Colonel.\"  Why shouldn't those three Shereefian\nofficers jump to conclusions, salute like automatons and grin like loyal\nmen who have surprised a secret and won't tell anyone but their bosom\nfriends?  It was all over Damascus within the hour that Lawrence had\ncome from England to stand by Feisul in the last ditch.  The secret was\nkept perfectly!\n\nWe let Mabel walk ahead of us, and there was no trouble at the customs\nbarrier, where normally every piastre that could be wrung from\nprotesting passengers were mulcted to support a starving treasury;  for\nthe officers strode behind us, and trade signs to the customs clerk, who\nimmediately swore at everyone in sight and sent all his minions to yell\nfor the best cabs in Damascus.\n\nNarayan Singh distributed largesse to about a hundred touts and\nhangers-on and we splashed off toward the hotel in two open landaus,\nthrough streets six inches deep in water except at the cross-gutters,\nwhere the horses jumped for fear of losing soundings.  Abana and\nPharpar, rivers of Damascus, were in flood as usual at that time of\nyear, and the scavenging street curs had to swim from one garbage heap\nto the next. There was a gorgeous battle going on opposite the hotel\ndoor, where half a dozen white-ivoried mongrels with their backs to a\nheap of kitchen leavings held a ford against a dozen others, each beast\nthat made good his passage joining with the defenders to fight off the\nrest.  I stood on the hotel steps and watched the war for several\nminutes, while Grim went in with the others and registered as \"Rupert\nRamsden of Chicago, U.S.A., and party.\"\n\nThe flood, and darkness owing to the lack of fuel, were all in our\nfavour, for such folk as were abroad were hardly of the sort whose\ngossip would carry weight;  nevertheless, we hadn't been in the hotel\ntwenty minutes before an agent of the bank put in his appearance,\nspeaking French volubly.  Seeing my name on the register, he made the\nmistake of confining his attention to me, which enabled Grim to get\nMabel safely away into a big room on the second floor.\n\nThe Frenchman (if he was one--he had a Hebrew nose) made bold to corner\nme on a seat near the dining-room door.  He was nervous rather than\naffable--a little pompous, as behooved the representative of money\npower--and evidently used to having his impertinences answered humbly.\n\n\"You are from the South?  Did you have a good journey?  Was the train\nattacked?  Did you hear any interesting rumors on the way?\"\n\nThose were all preliminary questions, thrown out at random to break ice.\nAs he sat down beside me you could feel the next one coming just as\neasily as see that he wasn't interested in the answers to the first.\n\n\"You are here on business?  What business?\"\n\n\"Private business,\" said I, with an eye on Jeremy just coming down the\nstairs.  \"You talk Arabic?\"\n\nHe nodded, eyeing me keenly.\n\n\"That man is my servant and knows my affairs.  I'm too tired to talk\nafter the journey.  Suppose you ask him.\"\n\nSo Jeremy came and sat beside us, and threw the cow's husband around as\nblithely as he juggles billiard balls.  I wasn't supposed to understand\nwhat he was saying.\n\n\"The big effendi is a prizefighter, who has heard there is money to be\nmade at Feisul's court.  At least, that is what he says. Between you and\nme, I think he is a spy for the French Government, because when he\nengaged me in Jerusalem he gave me a fist-full of paper francs with\nwhich to send a telegram to Paris. What was in the telegram?  I don't\nknow;  it was a mass of figures, and I mixed them up on purpose, being\nan honest fellow averse to spy's work.  Oh, I've kept an eye on him,\nbelieve me! Ever since he killed a Syrian in the train I've had my\ndoubts of him.  Mashallah, what a murderous disposition the fellow has!\nKill a man as soon as look at him--indeed he would.  Are you a prince in\nthese parts?\"\n\n\"A banker.\"\n\n\"Bismillah!  What a mercy that I met you!  I overheard him say that he\nwill visit the bank tomorrow morning to cash a draft for fifty thousand\nfrancs.  I'd examine the draft carefully if I were you.  It wouldn't\nsurprise me to learn it was stolen or forged. Is there any other bank\nthat he could go to?\"\n\n\"No, only mine;  the others have suspended business on account of the\ncrisis.\"\n\n\"Then, in the name of Allah don't forget me!  You ought to give me a\nthousand francs for the information.  I am a poor man, but honest.  At\nwhat time shall I come for the money in the morning? Perhaps you could\ngive me a little on account at once, for my wages are due tonight and\nI'm not at all certain of getting them.\"\n\n\"Well, see me in the morning,\" said the banker.\n\nHe got up and left us at once, hardly troubling to excuse himself;  and\nGrim heard him tell the hotel proprietor that our whole party would be\nlocked up in jail before midnight.  That rumour went the rounds like\nwild-fire, so that we were given a wide berth and had a table all to\nourselves in the darkest corner of the big dim dining-room.\n\nThere were more than a hundred people eating dinner, and Narayan Singh,\nHadad and I were the only ones in western clothes.  Every seat at the\nother tables was occupied by some Syrian dignitary in flowing robes--\nrows and rows of stately looking notables, scant of speech and noisy at\ntheir food.  Many of them seemed hardly to know the use of knife and\nfork, but they could all look as dignified as owls, even when crowding\nin spaghetti with their fingers.\n\nWe provided them with a sensation before the second course was finished.\nA fine-looking Syrian officer in khaki, with the usual cloth flap behind\nhis helmet that forms a compromise between western smartness and eastern\ncomfort, strode into the room and bore down on us.  He invited us out\ninto the corridor with an air that suggested we would better not refuse,\nand we filed out after him in an atmosphere of frigid disapproval.\n\nMabel was honestly scared half out of her wits now.  Not even the smiles\nof the hotel proprietor in the doorway reassured her, nor his deep bow\nas she passed.  She was even more scared, if that were possible, when\ntwo officers, obviously of high rank, came forward in the hall to greet\nher, and one addressed her in Arabic as Colonel Lawrence.  Luckily one\noil lamp per wall was doing duty in place of electric light, or there\nmight have been an awkward incident.  She had presence of mind enough to\ndisguise her alarm by a fit of coughing, bending nearly double and\ncovering the lower part of her face with the ends of the headdress\nfolded over.\n\nThe officers had no time to waste and gave their message to Grim\ninstead.\n\n\"The Emir Feisul is astonished, Jimgrim, that Colonel Lawrence and you\nshould visit Damascus without claiming his hospitality. We have two\nautos waiting to take you to the palace.\"\n\nWell, the luggage didn't amount to much;  Narayan Singh brought that\ndown in a jiffy;  and when I went to settle with the hotel-keeper one of\nthe Syrian officers interfered.\n\n\"These are guests of the Emir Feisul,\" he announced.  \"Send the bill to\nme.\"\n\nWe were piled into the waiting autos.  Mabel, Grim and I rode in the\nfirst one, with the Syrian officers up beside the driver; Jeremy,\nNarayan Singh and Hadad followed;  and we went through the dark streets\nlike sea-monsters splashing over shoals, unseen I think--certainly\nunrecognized.\n\nThe streets were almost deserted and I didn't catch sight of one armed\nman, which was a thing to marvel at when you consider that fifty\nthousand or so were supposed to be concentrated in the neighbourhood,\nwith conscription working full-blast and the foreign consuls solely\noccupied in procuring exemption for their nationals.\n\nIt wasn't my first visit to a reigning prince, for if you travel much in\nIndia you're bound to come in contact with numbers of them;  so I\nnaturally formed a mental picture of what was in store for us, made up\nfrom a mixture of memories of Gwalior, Baroda, Bikanir, Hyderabad, Poona\nand Baghdad of the Arabian-Nights.  It just as naturally vanished in\npresence of the quiet, latter-day dignity of the real thing.\n\nThe palace turned out to be a villa on the outskirts of the city, no\nbigger and hardly more pretentious than a well-to-do commuter's place at\nBronxville or Mount Vernon.  There was a short semi-circular drive in\nfront, with one sentry and one small lantern burning at each gate;  but\ntheir khaki uniforms and puttees didn't disguise the fact that the\nsentries were dark, dyed-in-wool Arabs from the desert country, and\nthough they presented arms, they did it as men who make concessions\nwithout pretending to admire such foolishness.  I wouldn't have given\nten cents for an unescorted stranger's chance of getting by them,\nwhatever his nationality.\n\nSurely there was never less formality in a king's house since the world\nbegan.  We were ushered straight into a narrow, rather ordinary hall,\nand through that into a sitting-room about twenty feet square.  The\nlight was from oil lamps hanging by brass chains from the curved beams;\nbut the only other Oriental suggestions were the cushioned seats in each\ncorner, small octagonal tables inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and a mighty\ngood Persian carpet.\n\nNarayan Singh and Jeremy, supposedly being servants, offered to stay in\nthe hall, but were told that Feisul wouldn't approve of that.\n\n\"Whatever they shouldn't hear can be said in another room,\" was the\nexplanation.\n\nSo we all sat down together on one of the corner seats, and were kept\nwaiting about sixty seconds until Feisul entered by a door in the far\ncorner.  And when he came he took your breath away.\n\nIt always prejudices me against a man to be told that he is dignified\nand stately.  Those adjectives smack of too much self-esteem and of a\nclaim to be made of different clay from most of us.  He was both, yet he\nwasn't either.  And he didn't look like a priest, although if ever\nintegrity and righteousness shone from a man, with their effect\nheightened by the severely simple Arab robes, I swear that man was he.\n\nJust about Jeremy's height and build--rather tall and thin that is--with\na slight stoop forward from the shoulders due to thoughtfulness and\ncamel-riding and a genuine intention not to hold his head too high, he\nlooked like a shepherd in a Bible picture, only with good humour added,\nthat brought him forward out of a world of dreams on to the same plane\nwith you, face to face--understanding meeting understanding--man to man.\n\nI wish I could describe his smile as he entered, believing he was coming\nto meet Lawrence, but it can't be done.  Maybe you can imagine it if you\nbear in mind that this man was captain of a cause as good as lost,\nhedged about by treason and well aware of it;  and that Colonel Lawrence\nwas the one man in the world who had proved himself capable of bridging\nthe division between East and West and making possible the Arab dream of\nindependence.\n\nBut unhappily it's easier to record unpleasant things.  He knew at the\nfirst glance--even before she drew back the kuffiyi--that Mabel wasn't\nLawrence, and I've never seen a man more disappointed in all my\nwanderings.  The smile didn't vanish;  he had too much pluck and\nself-control for that; but you might say that iron entered into it, as\nif for a second he was mocking destiny, willing to face all odds alone\nsince he couldn't have his friend.\n\nAnd he threw off disappointment like a man--dismissed it as a rock sheds\nwater, coming forward briskly to shake hands with Grim and bowing as\nGrim introduced us.\n\n\"At least here are two good friends,\" he said in Arabic, sitting down\nbetween Grim and Hadad.  \"Tell me what this means, and why you deceived\nus about Lawrence.\"\n\n\"We've something to show you,\" Grim answered.  \"Mrs. Ticknor brought it;\notherwise it might have been seen by the wrong people.\"\n\nFeisul took the hint and dismissed the Syrian officers, calling them by\ntheir first names as he gave them \"leave to go.\"  Then Mabel produced\nthe letter and Feisul read it, crossing one thin leg over the other and\nleaning back easily.  But he sat forward again and laughed bitterly when\nhe had read it twice over.\n\n\"I didn't write this.  I never saw it before, or heard of it,\" he said\nsimply.\n\n\"I know that,\" said Grim.  \"But we thought you'd better look at it.\"\n\nFeisul laid the letter across his knee and paused to light a cigarette.\nI thought he was going to do what nine men out of ten in a tight place\nwould certainly have done;  but he blew out the match, and went on\nsmoking.\n\n\"You mean your government has seen the thing, and sent you to confront\nme with it?\"\n\nIt was Grim's turn to laugh, and he was jubilant without a trace of\nbitterness.\n\n\"No.  The chief and I have risked our jobs by not reporting it. This\nvisit is strictly unofficial.\"\n\nFeisul handed the letter back to him, and it was Grim who struck a match\nand burned it, after tearing off the seal for a memento.\n\n\"You know what it means, of course?\" Grim trod the ash into the carpet.\n\"If the French could have come by that letter in Jerusalem, they'd have\nDreyfussed you--put you on trial for your life on trumped-up evidence.\nThey'd send a sworn copy of it to the British to keep them from taking\nyour part.\"\n\n\"I am grateful to you for burning it,\" Feisul answered.\n\nHe didn't look helpless, hopeless, or bewildered, but dumb and clinging\non;  like a man who holds an insecure footing against a hurricane.\n\n\"It means that the men all about you are traitors--\" Grim went on.\n\n\"Not all of them,\" Feisul interrupted.\n\n\"But many of them,\" answered Grim.  \"Your Arabs are loyal hot-heads;\nsome of your Syrians are dogs whom anyone can hire.\"\n\nIt was straight speaking.  From a major in foreign service, uninvited,\nto a king, it sounded near the knuckle.  Feisul took it quite\npleasantly.\n\n\"I know one from the other, Jimgrim.\"\n\nGrim got up and took a chair opposite Feisul.  He was all worked up and\nsweating at self-mastery, hotter under the collar than I had ever seen\nhim.\n\n\"It means,\" he went on, with a hand on each knee and his strange eyes\nfixed steadily on Feisul's, \"that the French are ready to attack you.\nIt means they're sure of capturing your person--and bent on seeing your\nfinish.  They'll give you a drumhead court martial and make excuses\nafterward.\"\n\n\"Inshallah,\" Feisul answered, meaning  \"If Allah permits it.\"\n\n\"That is exactly the right word!\" Grim exploded;  and Lord, he was hard\nput to it to keep excitement within bounds.\n\nI could see his neck trembling, and there were little beads of sweat on\nhis temple.  It was Grim at last without the mask on. \"Allah marks the\ndestiny of all of us.  Do you suppose we're here for nothing--at this\ntime?\"\n\nFeisul smiled.\n\n\"I am glad to see you,\" he said simply.\n\n\"Are you planning to fight the French?\" Grim asked him suddenly, in the\nsort of way that a man at close quarters lets rip an upper-cut.\n\n\"I must fight or yield.  They have sent an ultimatum, but delayed it so\nas not to permit me time to answer.  It has expired already.  They are\nprobably advancing.\"\n\n\"And you intend to sit here and wait for them?\"\n\n\"I shall be at the front.\"\n\n\"You know you haven't a chance!\"\n\n\"My advisers think that my presence at the front will encourage our men\nsufficiently to win the day.\"\n\n\"Have you a charm against mustard gas?\"\n\n\"That is our weakness.  No, we have no masks.\"\n\n\"And the wind setting up from the sea at this time of year!  Your army\nis going straight into a trap, and you along with it.  Half of the men\nwho advise you to go to the front will fight like lions against a net,\nand the other half will sell you to the French!  Your fifty thousand men\nwill melt like butter in the sun and your Arab cause will be left\nwithout a leader!\"\n\nFeisul pondered that for about a minute, leaning back and watching\nGrim's face.\n\n\"We held a council of war, Jimgrim,\" he said at last.  \"It was the\nunanimous opinion of the staff that we ought to fight and the cabinet\nupheld them.  I couldn't cancel the order if I wished. What would you\nthink of a king who left his army in the lurch?\"\n\n\"Nobody will ever accuse you of cowardice,\" Grim answered. \"You're a\nproven brave man if ever there was one.  The point is, do you want all\nyour bravery and hard work for the Arab cause to go for nothing?  Do you\nwant the prospect of Arab independence to go up in smoke on a gas-swept\nbattlefield?\"\n\n\"It would break my heart,\" said Feisul, \"although one heart hardly\nmatters.\"\n\n\"It would break more hearts than yours,\" Grim retorted.  \"There are\nmillions looking to you for leadership.  Leave me out of it. Leave\nLawrence out of it, and all the other non-Moslems who have done their\nbit for you.  Leave most of these Syrians out of it; for they're simply\npoliticians making use of you--a mess of breeds and creeds so mixed and\ncorrupted that they don't know which end up they stand!  If the Syrians\nhad guts they'd have rallied so hard to you long ago that no outsider\nwould have had a chance.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?  What are you proposing?\" Feisul asked quietly.\n\n\"Baghdad is your place, not Damascus!\"\n\n\"But here I am in Damascus,\" Feisul retorted;  and for the first time\nthere was a note of impatience in his voice.  \"I came here at the\nrequest of the Allies, on the strength of their promises.  I did not ask\nto be king.  I would rather not be.  Let any man be ruler whom the Arabs\nchoose, and I will work for him loyally.  But the Arabs chose me and the\nAllies consented.  It was only after they had won their war with our\nhelp that the French began raising objections and, the British deserted\nme.  It is too late to talk of Baghdad now.\"\n\n\"It isn't!  It's too soon!\" Grim answered, bringing down a clenched fist\non his knee, and Feisul laughed in spite of himself.\n\n\"You talk like a prophet, Jimgrim, but let me tell you something. It is\nmainly a question of money after all.  The British paid us a subsidy\nuntil they withdrew from Syria.  They did their best for us even then,\nfor they left behind guns, ammunition, wagons and supplies.  When the\nFrench seized the ports they promised to continue the subsidy, because\nthey are collecting the customs dues and we have no other revenue worth\nmentioning.  But rather than send us money the French have told our\npeople not to pay taxes;  so our treasury is empty.  Nevertheless, we\ncontrived by one means and another.  We arranged a bank credit, and\nordered supplies from abroad.  The supplies have reached Beirut, but the\nFrench have ordered the bank to cancel the credit, and until we pay for\nthe supplies they are withheld.\"\n\n\"Any gas masks among the supplies you ordered?\" Grim asked him; and\nFeisul nodded.\n\n\"That banker has played fast and loose with us until the last minute.\nRelying on our undertaking not to molest foreigners he has resided in\nDamascus, making promises one day and breaking them the next, keeping\nhis funds in Beirut and his agency here, draining money out of the\ncountry all the while.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you arrest him?\"\n\n\"We gave our word to the French that he should have complete protection\nand immunity.  It seemed a good thing to us to have such an influential\nbanker here;  he has international connections.  As recently as\nyesterday, twenty minutes before that ultimatum came, he was in this\nroom assuring me that he would be able to solve the credit difficulty\nwithin a day or two.\"\n\n\"Would you like to send for him now?\" suggested Grim.\n\n\"I doubt if he would come.\"\n\n\"Well, have him fetched!\"\n\nFeisul shook his head.\n\n\"If other people break their promises, that is no reason why we should\nbreak ours.  If we can defeat the French and force them to make other\nterms, then we will expel him from Syria.  I leave at midnight,\nJimgrim.\"\n\n\"To defeat the French?  You go to your Waterloo!  You're in check with\nonly one move possible, and I'm here to make you realize it. You're a\nman after my own heart, Feisul, but you and your Arabs are children at\ndealing with these foreign exploiters!\n\n\"They can beat you at every game but honesty.  And listen:  If you did\ndefeat the French--if you drove them into the sea tomorrow, they'd get\naway with all the money in Beirut and you'd still be at the mercy of\nforeign capitalists!  Instead of an independent Arab kingdom here you'd\nhave a mixture of peoples and religions all plotting against one another\nand you, with capitulations and foreign consuls getting in the way, and\nbond-holding bankers sitting on top of it all like the Old Man of the\nSea in the story of Sindbad the Sailor!\n\n\"Leave that to the French!  Let them have all Syria to stew in! Go to\nEngland where your friends are.  Let the politicians alone. Meet real\nfolk and talk with them.  Tell them the truth;  for they don't know it!\nTalk with the men and women who haven't got political jobs to lose--with\nthe fellows who did the fighting--with the men and women who have votes.\nThey'll believe you. They've given up believing politicians, and they're\nlearning how to twist the politicians' tails.  You'll find yourself in\nBaghdad within a year or two, with all Mesopotamia to make a garden of\nand none but Arabs to deal with.  That's your field!\"\n\nFeisul smiled with the air of a man who recognizes but is unconvinced.\n\n\"There are always things that might have been,\" he answered.  \"As it is,\nI cannot desert the army.\"\n\n\"We'll save what we can of the army,\" Grim answered.  \"Your Syrians will\nsave their own skins;  it's only the Arabs we've got to look out for--a\nline of retreat for the Arab regiments, and another for you.  It's not\ntoo late, and you know I'm right! Come on;  let's get busy and do it!\"\n\nFeisul's smile was all affection and approval, but he shook his head.\n\n\"If what you say is true, I should only have the same problem in\nMesopotamia--foreign financiers,\" he answered.\n\n\"That's exactly where you're wrong!\" Grim retorted triumphantly.\n\nHe stood up, and pointed at Jeremy.\n\n\"Here's a man who owns a gold-mine.  It lies between Mesopotamia and\nyour father's kingdom of the Hedjaz, and its exact whereabouts is a\nsecret.  He's here tonight to make you a present of the mine!  And\nhere's another man,\"--he pointed at me--\"a mining expert, who'll tell\nyou what the thing's worth.  It's yours, if you'll agree to abandon\nSyria and lay a course for Baghdad!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\"You'll be a virgin Victim!\"\n\n\nFeisul was interested;  he couldn't help being.  And he was utterly\nconvinced of Grim's sincerity.  But he wasn't moved from his purpose,\nand not even Jeremy's account of the gold-mine, or my professional\nopinion of its value, had the least effect toward cancelling the plans\nhe had in mind.  He was deeply affected by the offer, but that was all.\n\n\"Good heavens, man!\" Grim exploded suddenly.  \"Surely you won't throw\nthe whole world into war again!  You know what it will mean if the\nFrench kill or imprison you.  There isn't a Moslem of all the millions\nin Asia who won't swear vengeance against the West--you know that!  A\ndirect descendant of Mohammed, and the first outstanding, conquering\nMoslem since Saladin--\"\n\n\"The Allies should have thought of that before they broke promises,\"\nsaid Feisul.\n\n\"Never mind them.  Damn them!\" answered Grim.  \"It's up to you! The\nfuture of civilization is in your lap this minute!  Can't you see that\nif you lose you'll be a martyr, and Islam will rise to avenge you?\"\n\n\"Inshallah,\" said Feisul, nodding.\n\n\"But that if you let pride go by the board, and seem to run away,\nthere'll be a breathing spell?  Asia would wonder for a few months, and\ndo nothing, until it began to dawn on them that you had acted wisely and\nhad a better plan in view.\"\n\n\"I am not proud, except of my nation,\" Feisul answered.  \"I would not\nlet pride interfere with policy.  But it is too late to talk of this.\"\n\n\"Which is better?\" Grin demanded.  \"A martyr, the very mention of whose\nname means war, or a living power for peace under a temporary cloud?\"\n\n\"I am afraid I am a poor host.  Forgive me,\" Feisul answered. \"Dinner\nhas been waiting all this while, and you have a lady with you.  This is\ndisgraceful.\"\n\nHe rose and led the way into another room, closing the discussion.  We\nate an ordinary meal in an ordinary dining room, Feisul presiding and\ntalking trivialities with Mabel and Hadad. There was an occasional\nboisterous interlude by Jeremy, but even he with his tales of unknown\nArabia couldn't lift the load of depression.  Grim and I sat silent\nthrough the meal.  I experienced the sensation that you get when an\nexpedition proves a failure and you've got to go home again with nothing\ndone--all dreary emptiness;  but Grim was hatching something, as you\ncould tell by the far-away expression and the glowering light in his\neyes.  He looked about ready for murder.\n\nNarayan Singh's face all through the meal was a picture--delight and\npride at dining with a king, amazement at his karma that had brought a\nsepoy of the line to hear such confidences first hand, chagrin over\nGrim's apparent failure and desire to be inconspicuous controlled his\nexpression in turn.  Once or twice he tried to make conversation with\nme, but I was in no mood for it, being a grouchy old bear on occasion\nwithout decent manners.\n\nFeisul excused himself the minute the meal was over, saying he had a\nconference to attend, and we all went back into the sitting-room, where\nGrim took the chair he occupied before and marshalled us into a row on\nthe seat in front of him.  He was back again in form--electric--and\nself-controlled.\n\n\"Have you folk got the hang of this?\" he asked.  \"Do you realize what it\nmeans if Feisul goes out and gets scuppered?\"\n\nWe thought we did, even if we didn't.  I don't suppose anyone except the\nfew who, like Grim, have made a life-study of the problem of Islam in\nall its bearings could quite have grasped it. Mabel had a viewpoint that\nserved Grim's purpose as well as any at the moment.\n\n\"That man's too good, and much too good-looking to be wasted!\" she said\nemphatically.  \"D'you suppose that if Colonel Lawrence were really here--\"\n\n\"Half a minute,\" said Grim, \"and I'll come to that.  How about you,\nHadad?  How far would you go to save Feisul from this Waterloo?\"\n\n\"I would go a long way,\" he answered cautiously.  \"What do you intend?\"\n\n\"To appear near the firing-line, for one thing, with somebody who looks\nlike Colonel Lawrence, and somebody else who looks enough like Feisul in\none of Feisul's cars, and give the French a run for it in one direction\nwhile Feisul escapes in the other.\"\n\n\"Wallahi!  But what if Feisul won't go?\"\n\n\"He'll get helped!  Did you ever hear what they did to Napoleon at\nWaterloo?  Seized his bridle and galloped away with him.\"\n\n\"You mean I'm to act Lawrence again?\" asked Mabel, looking deathly\nwhite.\n\nGrim nodded.\n\n\"Who's cast for Feisul?\" Jeremy inquired.\n\n\"You are.  You're the only trained stage-actor in the bunch. You're his\nheight--not unlike his figure--\"\n\n\"I resemble him as much as a kangaroo looks like an ostrich!\" laughed\nJeremy.  \"You're talking wild, Jim.  What have you had to drink?\"\n\n\"How about you, Ramsden?  Will you see this through?\"\n\nJeremy shook his head at me.  I believe he thought for the moment that\nGrim had gone mad.  He hadn't the experience of Grim that I had, and\nconsequently not the same confidence in Grim's ability to dream, catch\nthe essence of the dream, pin it down and make a fact of it.\n\n\"I'll go the limit,\" said I.\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned\" laughed Jeremy.  \"All right;  same here. I stake\na gold-mine and Rammy raises me.  Fetch your crown and sceptre and I'll\nplay king to Jim's ace in a royal straight flush.  Mabel's queen.\nHadad's a knave.  He looks it!  Keep smiling, Hadad, old top, and I'll\nlet you forgive me.  Rammy's the ten-spot--tentative--tenacious--ten\naces up his sleeve--and packs a ten-ton wallop when you get him going.\nWhat's Narayan Singh?  The deuce?\"\n\n\"The joker,\" answered Grim.  \"Are you in on this?\"\n\n\"Sahib, there was no need to ask.  What your honor finds good enough--\nyour honor's order--\"\n\n\"Orders have nothing to do with it.  We're not in British territory.\nThis in unofficial.  I've no right to give you orders,\" said Grim.\n\"You're free to refuse.  I'm likely to lose my job over this and so are\nyou if you take part in it.\"\n\nNarayan Singh grinned hugely.\n\n\"Hah!  A sepoy's position is a smaller stake than a major's commission\nor a gold-mine, but I likewise have a life to lose, and I play too!\"\n\nGrim nodded curtly.  It was no time for returning compliments.\n\n\"How about you, Mabel?  We can manage this without you, and you've a\nhusband to think of--\"\n\n\"If he were here he'd hate it, but he'd give permission.\"\n\n\"All right.  Now, Hadad.  What about it?\"\n\n\"Am I to obey you absolutely, not knowing what the--\"\n\nGrim interrupted him:\n\n\"The proposal's fair.  Either you withdraw now and hold your tongue, or\ncome in with us.  If you're in I'll tell the details; if not, there's no\nneed.\"\n\n\"Wallahi!  What a sword-blade you are, Jimgrim!  If I say 'yes,' I risk\nmy future on your backgammon board;  if I say 'no,' my life is worth a\nmillieme, for you will tell that Sikh you call the 'joker' to attend to\nme!\"\n\n\"Not so,\" Grim answered.  \"If you don't like the plan, I'll trust you to\nfall out and keep the secret.\"\n\n\"Oh, in that case,\" answered Hadad, hesitating.  \"Since you put it that\nway... well, it is lose all or perhaps win something--half-measures are\nno good--the alternative is ruin of the Arab cause--it is a forlorn\nhope--well, one throw of the dice, eh?--and all our fortunes on the\ntable!--one little mistake and helas--finish!  Never mind.  Yes, I will\nplay too.  I will play this to the end with you.\"\n\n\"So we're all set,\" remarked Grim with a sigh of relief. Instantly he\nthrew his shoulders back and began to set his pieces for the game.  And\nyou know, there's a world of difference between the captain of a side\nwho doesn't worry until the game begins and Grim's sort, who do their\nworrying beforehand and then play, and make the whole side play for\nevery ounce that's in them.\n\n\"Mabel, you're Lawrence.  Keep silent, be shy, avoid encounters--act\nlike a man who's not supposed to be here, but who came to help Feisul\ncontrary to express commands laid on him by the Foreign Office.  Get\nthat?  Lawrence is a shy man, anyway--hates publicity, rank, anything\nthat calls attention to himself.  The more shy you are, the easier\nyou'll get away with it.  Feisul must help pretend you're Lawrence.  The\npresence of Lawrence would add to his prestige incalculably, and I think\nhe'll see that, but if not, never mind, we'll manage.  Any questions?\nQuick!\"\n\nYou can't ask questions when you're given that sort of opportunity.  The\nright ones don't occur to you and the others seem absurd.  Grim knew\nthat, of course, but when you're dealing with a woman there's just one\nchance in a hundred that she may think of something vital that hasn't\noccurred to anybody else. Most women aren't practical;  but it's the\nimpractical things that happen.\n\n\"Suppose we're captured by the French?\" she suggested.  \"That's what's\ngoing to happen,\" he answered.  \"When they've got you, then you're Mrs.\nMabel Ticknor, who never saw Lawrence and wouldn't recognize him if you\ndid.\"\n\n\"They'll ask why I'm wearing man's clothes, and masquerading as an\nArab.\"\n\n\"Well, you're a woman, aren't you?  You answer with another question--\nask them just how safe a woman would be!  They may claim that their\nAlgerians are baby-lambs, but they can't blame you for not believing it!\nAnything else?\"\n\nShe shook her head, and he turned on Hadad.\n\n\"Hadad, lose no opportunity of whispering that Lawrence is with Feisul.\nAdd that Lawrence doesn't want his presence known.  Hunt out two or\nthree loyal Arabs on the staff and tell them the plan is to kidnap\nFeisul and carry him to safety across the border; but don't do it too\nsoon;  wait until the debacle begins, and then persuade a few of them--\nold Ali, for instance, and Osman--choose the old guard--you and they\nbolt with him to Haifa.  The Syrians have been thoroughly undermined by\npropaganda;  gas will do the rest, and as soon as the Arabs see the\nSyrians run they'll listen to reason.  They know you, and know you're on\nthe level. Do you understand?  Will you do that?\"\n\n\"I will try.  I see many a chance of spilling before this cup comes to\nthe drinking, Jimgrim!\"\n\n\"Then carry it carefully!\" Grim answered.   \"Ramsden, take that car you\ncame in.  Find that banker.  He's the boy who has bought Feisul's staff,\nor I'm much mistaken.  Bring him here.\"  \"Suppose he won't come?\"\n\n\"Bring him.  Take Jeremy with you.  Try diplomacy first.  Tell him that\na plot to kidnap Feisul has been discovered at the last minute, but give\nhim to understand that no suspicion rests on him.  Get him, if you can,\nto send a message to the French General Staff, warning them to watch for\nFeisul and two civilians and Lawrence in an auto.  After that bring him\nif you have to put him in a sack.\"\n\n\"What's his name, and where does he live?\"\n\n\"Adolphe Rene.  Everybody knows his house.  Jeremy, look as unlike\nFeisul as you can until the time comes, but study the part and be ready\nto jump into his clothes.  Narayan Singh, stay with me.  You and I will\ndo the dirty work.  Get busy, Ramsden.\"\n\n\nCircumstances work clock-fashion, wheel fitting into wheel, when those\ntides that Shakespeare spoke of are at flood.  Disregarding all the\ntheory and argument about human will as opposed to cosmic law I say\nthis, without any care at all who contradicts me:\n\nThat whoever is near the hub of happenings is the agent of Universal\nLaw, and can no more help himself than can the watch that tells the\nhour.  The men who believe that they make history should really make a\nthoughtful fellow laugh.  \"The moving finger writes, and having writ\nmoves on\";  the old tentmaker Omar knew the truth of it.  You could\nalmost hear the balance-wheel of Progress click as the door opened\nbefore Grim had finished speaking, and a staff officer appeared to\ninvite him to be present at Feisul's conference.\n\nGrim asked at once for the auto for me (I couldn't have had it\notherwise), and a moment later Jeremy and I were scooting into darkness\nthrough narrow streets and driving rain, with the hubs of the wheels\nawash in places and \"shipping it green\" over the floor when we dipped\nand pitched over a cross-street gutter.  The Arab driver knew the way,\nfrom which I take it he had a compass in his head as well as a charm\nagainst accidents and a spirit of recklessness that put faith in\nworn-out springs.  There wasn't room for more than one set of wheels at\na time in most of the streets we tore through, but a camel tried to\nshare one fairway with us and had the worst of it;  he cannoned off into\nan alley 'himd end first, and we could hear him bellowing with rage a\nblock away.\n\nAnd our manner of stopping was like our progress, prompt.  The brake-\nbands went on with a shriek and Jeremy and I pitched forward as the car\nbrought up against the kerb in front of an enormous door, whose brass\nknocker shone like gold in the rays of our headlights.  We told the Arab\nto wait for us and stepped knee-deep into a pool invisible, stumbled and\nnearly fell over a great stone set to bridge the flood between street\nand door, then proceeded to use the knocker importunately, thunderously,\nangrily, as men with wet feet and bruised toes likely will, whatever the\ncustom of the country.\n\nWe went on knocking, taking turns, until the door opened at last and the\nbanker's servant peered at us with a candle in his hand, demanding to\nknow in the name of the thousand and one devils whom Solomon boiled in\noil what impudent scavengers were making all that noise.  But the banker\nhimself was in the background, thinking perhaps that the French had come\nalready, on the lookout over the servant's shoulder for a glimpse of a\nkepi.  So we put our shoulders to the door, thrust by the servant, and\nwalked in.\n\n\"Take care!  I have a pistol in my hand!\" said the banker's voice.\n\n\"Three shots for a shilling at me then!\" retorted Jeremy.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Tell that shivering fool to bring the candle, and you'll see!\"\n\n\"Oh, you, is it!  I told you to come in the morning.  I can't see you\nnow.\"\n\n\"Can't see me, eh?  Come in here and peel your eyes, cocky!  Sit down\nand look at us.  There, take a pew.  Wonder where I learned such good\nEnglish?  Well, I used to shine the toenails of the Prince o' Wales, and\nyou have to pass a Civil Service examination before they give you that\ngood job.  I talk any language except French and Jewish, but this master\nof mine turns out to be a Jew who talks French, and not a prizefighter\nafter all.\n\n\"What did I tell you this evening?  Said he was a spy for the French,\ndidn't I?  I tell you, I'm a dependable man.  What I say you can bet on\ntill you've lost all your money.  Here he is, spying to beat the\npromised-landers--just had tea with Feisul and learned all the inside\nfacts--offered me a pound to come and find you, but I charged him two\nand got the money in advance.\n\n\"You ought to pay me a commission, too, and then I'll get married if\nthere's an honest woman left in Damascus.  If either of you want my\nadvice, you won't believe a word the other says, but I expect you're\nboth too wilful to be guided.  Anyhow, you'll have to talk in front of\nme, because my master is afraid of being murdered;  he isn't afraid of\nghosts or bad smells, but the sight of a long knife turns his heart to\nwater and sets him to praying so loud that you can't get a word in\nedgewise.  Go on, both of you--yalla!  Talk!\"\n\nDoes it begin to be obvious why kings used to employ court jesters?  The\nmodern cabinets should have them--men like Jeremy (though they'd be hard\nto find) to break the crust of situations. Suspicion weakens in the\npresence of incongruity.\n\n\"This fellow seems less than half-witted,\" I said, \"but he's shrewd, and\nI've found him useful.  Unfortunately he has picked up a lot of\ninformation, so we'll have to keep an eye on him.  My business is to\ncommunicate with the French General Staff and I'm told you know how to\nmanage it.\"\n\n\"Huh-huh?  Who told you that?\"\n\n\"Those who gave me my instructions.  If you don't know who they are\nwithout my telling you, you're the wrong man and I'll not waste time\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Let us suppose that I know then.  Proceed.\"\n\n\"Your name was given to me as that of a man who can be trusted to take\nnecessary action in the interests of ... er ... you understand?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh!\"\n\n\"The plot for Feisul to be kidnapped by some Syrian members of his staff\nhas been discovered at the last minute,\" I said, looking hard at him;\nand he winced palpably.\n\n\"Mon Dieu! You mean--\"\n\n\"That it is not too late to save the situation.  You have not been\naccused of connection with it.  I came here in pursuance of a different\nplan to kidnap him--a sort of reserve plan, to be employed in case other\nmeans should fail.  All arrangements are in working order except the one\nitem of communicating with the French General Staff.  I require you to\naccompany me for that purpose, and to send off to them immediately a\nmessage at my dictation.\"\n\n\"Tschaa!  Suppose you show me your authority?\"\n\n\"Certainly!\" I answered.\n\nRealizing that he wasn't in immediate danger of life he had returned his\nown pistol to his pocket.  So I showed him the muzzle of mine, and he\ndivined without a sermon on the subject that it would go off and shoot\naccurately unless he showed discretion.  He didn't offer to move when\nJeremy's agile fingers found his pocket and flicked out the mother-of-\npearl-handled, rim-fire thing with which he had previously kept his\ncourage warm.\n\n\"I was told not to trust you too far,\" I explained.  \"I was warned in\nadvance that you might question my credentials.  You are said to be\njealous of interference.  As a precaution against miscarriage of this\nplan through jealousy on your part, I was ordered to oblige you to obey\nme.\"\n\n\"And if I refuse?\"\n\n\"Your widow will then be the individual most concerned.  Be good enough\nto take pen and paper, and write a letter to my dictation.\"\n\nJeremy went to the door, which was partly open, made sure that the\nservant was out of earshot, and slammed it tight.  Rene the banker went\nto his escritoire, took paper, and shook his fountain pen.\n\n\"How shall I commence the letter?\" he asked me with a dry, sly smile.\n\nHe thought he had me there.  There are doubtless proper forms of address\nthat serve to establish the genuineness of letters written by a spy.\n\n\"Commence half-way down the page,\" I answered.  \"We'll insert the\naddress afterwards.  Write in French:\"\n\n\n\"I shall accompany the Emir Feisul and Colonel Lawrence to the front\ntonight, former plan having miscarried.  When Syrian retreat begins look\nout for automobile containing Feisul and Lawrence, which may be\nrecognized easily as it will also contain myself and another civilian in\nplain clothes.  At the psychological moment a white flag will be shown\nfrom it, waved perhaps surreptitiously by one of the civilians.  In the\nevent of breakdown of the automobile a horsed vehicle will be used and\nthe same signal will apply.  For the sake of myself and the other\ncivilian, please instruct all officers to keep a sharp lookout and\nprotect the party from being fired on.\"\n\n\n\"There,\" I said, \"sign that and address it.\"\n\nHe hesitated.  He couldn't doubt that his own arrangements with traitors\non the staff to kidnap Feisul had gone amiss, else how should I be aware\nof them at all--I, who had only arrived that evening in Damascus?  But\nit puzzled him to know why I should make him write the letter, or, since\nhis plan must have failed, why I should let him share in the kidnapping.\nHe smelt the obvious rat.  Why didn't I sign the letter myself, and get\nall the credit afterward, as any other spy would do?\n\n\"You sign it,\" he said, pushing the letter toward me;  and I got one of\nthose sudden inspirations that there is no explaining--the right idea\nfor handling fox Rene the banker.\n\n\"So you're afraid to sign that, are you?  All right;  give it here, I'll\nsign it;  pass me your pen.  But you'll come along with me tonight, my\nlad, and make your explanations to the French in the morning!\"\n\nLooking back, I can see how the accusation worked, although it was an\narrow shot at a venture.  His greasy, sly, fox face with its touch of\nbold impudence betrayed him for a man who would habitually hedge his\nbets.  Feisul's safe-conduct had protected him from official\ninterference, but it had needed more than that to preserve him from\nunofficial murder, and beyond a doubt he had betrayed the French in\nminor ways whenever that course looked profitable.  Now in a crisis he\nhad small choice but to establish himself as loyal to the stronger side.\nHe hurriedly wrote a number at the bottom of the letter, and another\nfollowed by three capitals and three more figures at the top.\n\n\"Seal it up and send it--quick!\" I ordered him.\n\nHe obeyed and Jeremy called the servant.\n\n\"Summon Francois,\" said the banker, and the servant disappeared again.\n\nFrancois must remain a mystery.  He was insoluble.  Dressed in a pair of\nbaggy Turkish pants, with a red sash round his middle, knotted loosely\nover a woollen jersey that had wide horizontal black and yellow strips,\nwith a grey woollen shawl over the lot, and a new tarboosh a size or two\ntoo small for him perched at an angle on his head, he stood shifting\nfrom one bare foot to the other and moved a toothless gap in his lower\nface in what was presumably a smile.\n\nHe had no nose that you could recognize, although there were two blow-\nholes in place of nostrils with a hideous long scar above them.  One ear\nwas missing.  He had no eyebrows.  But the remaining ear was pointed at\nthe top like a satyr's, and his little beady eyes were as black as a\nbird's and inhumanly bright.\n\nThe banker spoke to him in the voice you would use to a rather spoilt\nchild when obedience was all-important, using Arabic with a few French\nwords thrown in.\n\n\"Ah, here is Francois.  Good Francois!  Francois, mon brave, here is a\nletter, eh?  You know where to take it--eh? Ha-ha!  Francois knows,\ndoesn't he!  Francois doesn't talk;  he tells nobody; he's wise, is\nFrancois!  He runs, eh?  He runs through the rain and the night;  and he\nhides so that nobody can see him;  and he delivers the letter;  and\nsomebody gives Francois money and tobacco and a little rum;  and\nFrancois comes running back to the nice little, dark little hole where\nhe sleeps.  Plenty to eat, eh, Francois?  Nice soft food that needs no\nchewing!  Nothing to do but run with a letter now and then, eh?  A brave\nfellow is Francois--a clever fellow--a trustworthy fellow--a dependable,\nwilling fellow, always ready to please!  Ready to go?\n\n\"Well, there's the letter;  be careful with it, and run-run-run like a\ngood boy!  A whole bottle of rum when you come back--think of it!  A\nwhole bottle of nice brown rum to yourself in that nice little room\nwhere your bed is!  There, goodbye!\"\n\nThe creature addressed as Francois vanished, with a snort and a sort of\nsqueal that may have been meant for speech.  \"That is the best messenger\nin Syria,\" said Rene.  \"He is priceless--incorruptible, silent, and as\nsure as Destiny!  The French General Staff will have that letter before\ndawn.  Now--what next?\"\n\n\"You come with me,\" I answered.\n\nHe felt better now that the message was on its way;  second thought\nconvinced him of my connection with the French.  There is no more\nprofitless delusion than to suppose that a country's secret agents are\nalways its own nationals.  They are almost always not.\n\nIf the French used only Frenchmen, Germany used none but Germans, Great\nBritain only Englishmen, and so on, it might be prettier and easier for\nthe police, but intelligence departments would starve.  So there was\nnothing about an obvious American doing spy-work for the French that\nshould stick in his craw;  and that being so, the more cheerfully he\naided me the better it would likely be for him.\n\nSo he called for the servant again, and proved himself a good campaigner\nby superintending the packing of a big basket with provisions--bread and\nbutter, cold chicken, wine, olives, and hot coffee in a thermos bottle.\n\n\"The French will be in Damascus by noon tomorrow,\" he said.  \"Ha-ha!\nThose French and their hungry Algerians!  We do well to take a good\nprovision with us--enough for two days at least.  We shall enter with\nthem, I suppose, or at least behind them, and of course my house here\nwill receive consideration;  but--ha-ha!--how many chickens do you\nbelieve will be purchasable in Damascus one hour after the first\nAlgerians get here?  Eh?  Put in another chicken, Hassan, mon brave.  Eh\nbien, oui--pack the basket full; put in more of everything!\"\n\nAt last he got into an overcoat lined with fox-pelt, for the night air\nwas chilly and an overcoat is less trouble than blankets if you expect\nto spend a night on the move.  We hove the huge basket into the waiting\nauto, slammed the front door of the house behind us, piled into the back\nseat and were off.\n\n\"I shall be glad when this business is over,\" said Rene, with a sigh of\nsatisfaction.  \"I am a banker by profession.  For me the ebb and flow of\ntrade, with its certainties and its discretions. But what would you?\nTrade must be prepared for;  doors that will not open must be forced;\nthose who stand in the way must be thrust aside.  This Feisul is an\nimpossible fellow.  He is a hypocrite, I tell you--one of those praters\nabout righteousness who won't understand that the church and the mosque\nare the places for that sort of thing.  Eh?  You follow me?  But tell\nme, what has been done to Daulch, Hattin and Aubek?  Were they backed\nagainst a wall and shot?  Who betrayed them?  Too bad that such a plan\nshould fail, for it was perfect.\"\n\n\"Far from perfect,\" I answered;  for that one piece of strategy I have\nby heart--the way to make a man tell all he knows is to pretend to\nsuperior knowledge.\n\n\"Heh?  How could you improve on it?  Three members of the staff to order\nsauve-qui-peut unexpectedly, seize Feisul, and deliver him dead or\nalive?  What is better than that?  But what has been done to the three?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" I answered.\n\n\"Just like him!  just like him!  I tell you, that man Feisul would\nrather be a martyr than succeed at his proper business.\" We reached the\npalace just as Feisul was leaving it.  Several members of his staff were\nhard on his heels in the porch and our party was behind them again, with\nMabel last of all.  There was a line of waiting autos nearly long enough\nto fill the drive, but an utter absence of military fuss, and no\nshouting or hurry.  It looked in the dark more like a funeral than the\ndeparture of a king to join his army at the front.\n\nI remained in the car with the banker and sent Jeremy to report our\ndoings to Grim.  Presently I could see him standing under the porch lamp\nwith a hand on Grim's shoulder, and I leaned out over the auto door to\nwatch;  but Rene the banker leaned back, snuggled up in his overcoat,\nliking neither to be seen nor to get his skin wet.  I expected to see\nthe three staff officers Daulch, Hattin and Aubek arrested there and\nthen;  but nothing happened, except that Feisul suddenly drove away with\nMabel and Grim in the same car with him.\n\nThere followed a rush for the other cars, and the whole line started\nforward, Jeremy jumping in as our car passed the porch. \"Daulch, Hattin\nand Aubek are at the front,\" he said, and began humming to himself.\n\n\"At the front?\" demanded Rene, sitting upright suddenly.  \"At the front,\nyou say?  When did they leave for the front?\"\n\n\"This evening,\" answered Jeremy.\n\nYou couldn't see his face in the dark, but I think he was chuckling.\n\n\"Strange!\" said the banker.  \"Yet you say they have been betrayed--their\nplan is known--yet they left for the front this evening?\"\n\nIt was pitch-dark inside the car, for the rain swished down in torrents\nand Jeremy fastened the flaps after he got in.  Rene's change of\nexpression was a thing that you could feel, not see. He kept perfect\nsilence for about two minutes, while the car skidded and bumped at the\nrear of the procession.  Then:\n\n\"You tell me that Feisul knows, and yet...\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't tell you that,\" laughed Jeremy.  \"It was this other man\nwho said so.  I never deceived anyone;  I'm an honest fellow, I am.\nRemember, I warned you against him when we talked in the hotel;  you\ncan't blame me.  I told you he was up to mischief.  I advised you to\nkeep a careful eye on him and to look twice at his paper!  Wallah!  You\nmust be a lamb in foxskin.  My master is a wolf in a woolly overcoat!\nWait till you've seen him eat that chicken that you brought, and then\nyou'll know what kind of a man he is!\n\n\"You see, you should have given me money when I asked you for it. I'm a\nfellow with a price, I am.  Whoever pays my price gets his money's\nworth.  If you'd had the sense to pay me more than this man does, I'd\nhave helped you trick him instead of helping him trick you;  but he gave\nme my wages before dinner and you gave me nothing, so here you are, and\nI wouldn't like to be keeping your pair of trousers warm!  I tell you,\nthis Ramsden effendi is an awful fellow, who will stick at nothing, and\nI'm worse because I'm honest and do what I'm paid to do!\"\n\nI took the precaution of putting my arm around Rene, for it was likely\nthat he had another weapon hidden somewhere, and the obvious thing for\nhim to do was to shoot the two of us and make a bolt for it.  For a\nsecond I thought I felt his hand moving;  but it was Jeremy's, searching\nall his pockets and feeling for hidden steel.  So I pulled out a cigar\nand lit a match.\n\nOf course, anyone's face looks ghastly by that sort of sudden light;\nbut Rene's was a picture of hate, rage, baffled cunning and fear, such\nas I had never seen;  his eyes looked like an animal's at bay, and the\nway his lips parted from his teeth conveyed the impression that he was\nsearching his mind wildly for a desperate remedy that would ruin all\nconcerned except himself.\n\nBut it was only a stale old recourse that he had.  In a man's extremity\nhe turns by instinct to his own tin gods for help, and you may read his\nwhole heart and religion then.\n\n\"Very well;  very well,\" he said, as if he were on the rack, speaking\nhurriedly to get it over with.  \"I make the sacrifice. You will find my\nmoney in an inner vest pocket underneath my vest.  It is a life's\nsavings.  Take it, and let me go.  It is not much--only a little--I am\nnot a rich man--I had hoped to be, but it would mean a fortune to you no\ndoubt.  Take it and be merciful;  give me back the smaller packet of the\ntwo, keep the larger, and let me go.\"\n\nOut of curiosity I reached inside his vest and pulled out both packets.\nJeremy struck a match.  The smaller packet contained a draft on Paris\nfor a quarter of a million francs.  The larger held nothing but\ncorrespondence.  I returned them to him.\n\n\"Listen!\" I said.  \"I've never yet murdered a man, so if you provide me\nwith another excuse for murdering you, you'll be a virgin victim.  Keep\nthat in mind!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\"Catch the Alfies napping and kick hell out of 'em!\"\n\n\nYou're no doubt familiar with the fact that the accounts given by two\nmen who have witnessed a battle from the same angle will differ widely,\nnot only in minor detail but in fundamentals;  so you won't look to me\nfor confirmation of any one of the countless stories that have seen the\nlight of print, pretending to explain how the French won Damascus so\neasily and unexpectedly.  I was only on the inside, looking outward as\nit were;  the fellows on the outside, looking in, would naturally give a\ndifferent explanation.\n\nThen you must bear in mind that this is a day of \"official\" accounts\nthat would make a limping dog of Ananias.  When the General Staff of an\ninvading army controls all the wires and all lines of communication you\nmay believe what they choose to tell you, if you wish.  But you don't\nhave to, as they say in Maine. And I admit that all I saw was from a\ncurtained auto as we swayed and bumped over broken roads, with an\noccasional interlude when Jeremy and I got out to lend our shoulders and\nhelp the Arab driver heave the car out of a slough.\n\nMy clearest memory is of that Arab--silent, stolid, staring like an owl\nstraight forward most of the time--but a perfect marvel in emergencies,\nwhen he would suddenly spring to life, swear a living streak of\nbrimstone blasphemy in high falsetto, and perform a driver's miracle.\n\nBy two hours after midnight we were running on four flat tires; and\nI've got the name of the maker of those wheels for future reference and\nuse.  One spring broke, but we went forward sailor-fashion, with a jury-\nrig of chain and rope, after getting more gas from some Christian monks,\nwho swore they hadn't any and wept when one of Feisul's officers\ndemonstrated that they had.  You couldn't see any monastery;  I don't\neven know that there was one--nothing but lean faces with tonsured tops\nthat nodded in unison and lied fearfully.\n\nThe gunfire began to be heavy about that time, although nothing like the\nthousand-throated bedlam of Flanders.  As neither side could see the\nother and neither had any ranges marked, my guess is that the French\nwere advertising their advance--doing a little propaganda that was cheap\nfor all concerned except the tax-payers.  And the Syrian army was\nshooting back crazily, sending over long shots on the off chance, more\nto encourage themselves than for any other reason.\n\nThe sensation was rather like riding in an ambulance away from the\nbattle instead of toward it, for you couldn't see anything and you had a\nsense of helpless detachment from it all, as if a power you couldn't\ncontrol were carrying you away from a familiar destiny to one that you\ncouldn't imagine.  It wasn't so much like a dream as like a different,\nreal existence that you couldn't understand because it bore no kind of\nrelation to anything in the past.\n\nAnyhow, we bumped and blundered on until dawn came, streaked with\nwonderful rolling mist, and gave a glimpse at intervals of a wide plain\nsloping toward the west, with long lines of infantry and here and there\nguns extended across it in parallels drawn north and south.\n\nThe rifle firing started ten minutes after dawn, and it was all over in\nless than half an hour;  but I can't describe exactly how the finish\ncame, because the wind was toward us and the morning mist blew along in\nblanketing white masses that only allowed you a momentary glimpse and\nthen shut off the view.\n\nWe were about a mile behind the firing-line and I couldn't see Feisul's\ncar or any of the others.  For the moment there was just one clear line\nof vision, straight from where I sat to the nearest infantry.  I could\nsee about fifty yards of the line and perhaps that many men;  and they\nwere blazing away furiously over a low earthwork, although I couldn't\nsee a sign of the French. There was hardly any artillery firing at that\ntime.\n\nSuddenly without any obvious reason the men whose backs I was watching\nbroke and ran.  The mist obscured them instantly and the line of vision\nshifted, so that bit by bit I saw I dare say a mile of the firing line.\nThe whole lot were running for their lives and, look where I would,\nthere wasn't a sign of a Frenchman anywhere.\n\nI should say it took about ten minutes for the first of them to reach\nthe dirt road, where our autos stood hub-deep in mud, and by that time\nwe had shoved and pulley-hauled them into movement, our engines making\nas much row as a nest of machine-guns as they struggled against the\nstrain.  We didn't want to be swamped under that tide of fugitives.\n\nBut they took no notice of us.  They had thrown away their weapons and\nwere running for home with eyes distended and nothing in mind but to put\ndistance between there and the enemy.  I jumped out of the car and\nseized one man.\n\n\"What are you running from?  What has happened?\" I demanded, holding him\nharder the more he struggled.\n\n\"Poison gas!\" he gasped, and I let him go.\n\nI thought I caught a whiff of the darned stuff then, but that may have\nbeen imagination.\n\n\"Poison gas!\" I said, returning to the car, and Rene made a fine\nexhibition of himself, smothering his head under the foxlined overcoat\nand screaming.\n\nHe got right down on the floor of the car and lay there huddled and\ngasping--which may have been a sensible precaution;  I don't know.\nThere was no time just then to bother with him.\n\n\nThe flukey morning breeze shifted several points.  The mist curled\nsuddenly and began to flow diagonally across our line of cars instead of\ntoward us, and from one moment to the next you could see straight along\nthe road for maybe a mile or more. There was a sight worth seeing--\nFeisul's cavalry in full rout--running away from ghosts by the look of\nit--their formation hardly yet broken, horse and man racing with the\nwind and a scattering of unhorsed fugitives streaming behind like a\ncomet's tail.\n\nAccording to Grim, who should know, that cavalry division was the\nkingpin of Feisul's plan.  He had intended to lead a raid in person,\nswooping down the French flank to their rear;  but the three staff\ntraitors, Daulch, Hattin and Aubck, sent forward the previous evening to\nplace the division and hold it ready, had simply tipped the French off\nto the whole plan and at the critical moment of Feisul's arrival on the\nscene had ordered the sauve-qui-peut.  I don't believe the French used\nmore than a can or two of gas.  I don't believe they had more than a few\ncans of it so far advanced.\n\nBut the sauve-qui-peut might have been useless without Feisul's capture,\nfor he was just the man to rally a routed army and snatch victory out of\na defeat.  Nobody knew better than Feisul the weakness of the French\ncommunications, and the work of those three traitors was only half done\nwhen the cavalry took to its heels.  The one man who could possibly save\nthe day had to be bagged and handed over.\n\nI didn't realize all that, of course, in the twinkling of an eye, as\nthey say you do in a climax.  Maybe I've never faced a climax. I'm no\npsychologist and not at all given to review of sudden situations in the\nabstract.\n\nThere was a fight, or a riot, or something like it going on near the\nhead of our line of autos.  The first two or three had come to a\nstandstill;  several in the middle of the line were trying to wheel\noutward and bolt for it behind the fleeing cavalry, and those at the\ntail end were blocked by one that had broken down. Of course everybody\nwas yelling at the top of his lungs and the hurrying shreds of blown\nmist further confounded the confusion.\n\nSo Jeremy and I ran forward, plunging through the mud and knocking over\nwhoever blocked our way.  It was rather fun--like the football field at\nschool.  But one man--a Syrian officer--stood near the last of the\nforward cars with the evident purpose of standing off interference.  He\ntook careful aim at me with a revolver, fired point-blank, and missed.\n\nI forgot all about my own pistol and went for him with a laugh and a\nyell of sheer exhilaration.  There's an eighth of a ton of me, mostly\nbone and muscle, so it isn't a sinecure to have to stop my fist when the\nrest of the bulk is under way behind it.  I landed so hard on his nose,\nand with such tremendous impetus, that he hadn't enough initial\nstability to take the impact and bring me up on my feet.  He went down\nlike a ninepin, I on top of him, laughing with mud in my teeth, and\nJeremy landed on top of the two of us, holding the skirts of his cloak\nin both hands as he jumped.\n\nJeremy picked up the fellow's revolver and threw it out of sight, and\nthe two of us ran on again--too late by now to help in the emergency,\nbut in time for the next event.\n\nGrim had managed everything, although he was bleeding, and smiling\nserenely through the blood.  Hadad was there, not smiling at all, but\nbleached white with excitement;  he had brought a number of Arab\nofficers with him, six or seven of whom were standing on the running-\nboard of the front car and all arguing with Feisul, who sat back with\nhis feet and hands tied, guarded by Narayan Singh.\n\nAt Grim's feet--dead, with bullets through their heads--were three\nSyrian staff officers.  They were the traitors Daulch, Hattin and Aubek.\nGrim's pistol was in his right hand and had been used.\n\nThere had been a first-class fight, all over in two minutes;  for the\ntraitors hadn't arrived on the scene without assistants. Unfortunately\nfor them, Hadad had turned up at the same moment with his loyalists.\nNarayan Singh had jumped from the car behind and seized Feisul, thrown\nhim to the floor out of the path of bullets, and tied his arms.  It was\nactually Mabel, hardly realizing what she was doing but obeying the\nSikh's orders yelled in her ear as he struggled to keep his wiry\nprisoner down, who tied the king's feet, using her Arab girdle.\n\nFeisul, of course, was all for dying at the head of a remnant of his\nmen.  That would be the first impulse of any decent leader in like\ncircumstance.  But his loyal friends, eager to die with him if they\nmust, but unwilling to die at all if there were an alternative, were\noverwhelming him with streams of words and promises.  Suddenly two of\nthem jumped into the car and began to untie his arms and feet.  Grim,\nlooking swiftly to right and left, saw Jeremy and pounced on him so\nfiercely that an onlooker might have guessed another fight to the death\nwas under way.  Too excited to say what he had in mind, he tugged at\nJeremy's clothes.\n\n\"I get you, Jim--I get you!\" Jeremy laughed gaily, and in ten seconds\nhad stripped himself down to his underwear.\n\nHadad must have been discussing details of the plan with Grim along the\nroad;  for he got busy at the same time, persuading Feisul to part with\nhis garments--not that his consent really mattered at the moment;  they\nwere pulled off him by half a dozen hands at once, and Jeremy had the\nbest of that bargain all right, for in addition to silk headdress and a\nfine black Arab full-dress coat, there was linen of a sort you can't\nbuy--better stuff than bishops wear and clean, which Jeremy's own\nwasn't.\n\nThe time it takes to read this gives a totally false impression of the\nspeed.  The whole thing took place, I should say, within two minutes\nfrom the time when I punched that Syrian's nose until Mabel and Narayan\nSingh stood beside me watching Hadad, two more Arabs and Feisul drive\naway, with a second car crowded full of loyalists in close attendance.\n\n\nBy that time Jeremy was dressed in Feisul's clothes;  and though he\ndidn't look a bit like Feisul from a yard away, in the mist at ten\nyards, provided you were looking for Feisul, you'd have taken your Bible\noath he was the man;  for he had the gesture and mannerism copied to\nperfection.\n\nHowever, standing there wasn't going to increase the real Feisul's\nchance of escaping.  The sooner we got caught, the quicker the French\nwould discover that our man had given them the slip.  Our business was\nto give the French a long chase in the wrong direction, and those bogged\nautos weren't ideal for the purpose.\n\nBut they were the only means in sight just then, and we had to bear in\nmind that message I had made Rene send, warning the French to look out\nfor an auto with a white flag and two civilians together with Feisul and\nLawrence.  So we picked out the two best that remained, pitched Rene and\nhis basket of provisions into the front one with Mabel and Jeremy, piled\nNarayan Singh in after them to take my place as the second civilian, and\nstarted them off straight forward, Grim and I following in a second car\nafter I had paid our former Arab driver handsomely and sent him off\ngrinning to give a lift to as many runaways as the car would hold.\n\nWe learned afterward that the rascal made a fortune, charging as much as\nfifty pounds sterling for the trip halfway back to Damascus, at which\npoint the car collapsed.  They say he carried eleven officers that far,\nbought two wives with the proceeds and escaped all the way to a village\nnear Mecca, where his home was.\n\nYou know how bewildering and tricky those early mists are when they\nstart to roll up before the wind.  We had hardly got going when the\nwhole mass seemed to shift in one great cloud, covering the fleeing\ntroops and incidentally Feisul, but leaving us in our two autos high and\ndry, as it were, in full view of the French. And they were advancing by\nthat time.\n\nI couldn't see more than a division of them that we would have to reckon\nwith--nearly all Algerians--and they looked dead-weary.  I guess they\nhad forced the pace in advance of the main body in order to take\nadvantage of the treason of Feisul's officers. They came slouching\nforward with their rifles at the trail and a screen of skirmishers\nthrown out a quarter of a mile or so ahead.\n\nThere were cavalry and guns far off on their right, evidently trying to\nwork around to the flank of the fleeing array, but those were much too\nfar away to trouble us and were going in the wrong direction.  Rolling\nbanks of mist shut off the farther view to westward and there was no\nguessing where the main French force might be, and for all I know it\nhadn't started from the coast yet.\n\n\nFortune came to our rescue with one riderless horse, a splendid Arab\ngelding tied by the bridle to the wheel of a water-cart and left behind\nin the stampede.  Jeremy appropriated it, riding Arab fashion with short\nstirrups, and I wouldn't have blamed Feisul's own brother for falsely\nidentifying him at ten yards.  He was born mischievous and he\ncaricatured Feisul on horseback as if he were acting for the movies.\n\nI guess the French officers had good glasses with them, for Jeremy had\nhardly mounted when the advancing Algerians opened a hot fire on us.\nThe whole division surely wouldn't have blazed away, with machine-guns\nand all, at two cars and a man on horseback unless someone had passed\nthe word along that Feisul was in full view.\n\nSo Grim and I abandoned our car, driver and all, and jumped into\nJeremy's place.  It wasn't more than two hundred yards to the top of a\ngentle rise, over which we disappeared from view;  and just as we bumped\nover it I wrenched out the white tablecloth in which Rene's chicken and\nstuff was wrapped and waved it violently.\n\nThen, Lord, what a sight!  Below us, sheltered between two flanking\nhillocks, was about a division of Feisul's Arab infantry, packing up\nsulkily, preparing to follow the retreat. It was a safe bet the French\ndidn't know they were there, and I dare say the same thought occurred to\nevery one of us the same instant.  Mabel thought of it.  I know I did.\nBut Jeremy voiced it first, heeling his horse up beside us.\n\n\"What do you say, Jim?  I bet you I can rally that gang.  Shall I lead\n'em and lick hell out of the Algies?\"\n\nBut Grim shook his head.\n\n\"You might, but the game is to pull the plug properly.  Get this lot on\nthe run.  The less fighting, the less risk of drasticism when the French\nget to Damascus.  Chase 'em off home!\"\n\nSo Jeremy did it;  and that, I believe, accounts for a story that got in\nthe newspapers about Feisul trying to spring a surprise on the French at\nthe last minute.  Some French officers in armored cars came over the\nbrow of the hill in pursuit of us--three cars, three officers, three\nmachine-guns, and about a dozen men.  One car quit on the hill-top, so I\nsuppose it broke down, but its occupants must have seen Jeremy careering\nup and down the line encouraging those sulky Arabs to get a move on, and\nI suppose they told tales afterwards to a newspaper correspondent at the\nbase.\n\nAnyhow, the two pursuing armored cars didn't dare come near enough to be\ndangerous until we had followed the retreating Arab regiments for about\na mile, and the Algerians appeared over the hill-top, coming very\nslowly.  A long-range rifle-fire commenced, the Arabs returning it\nscrappily as they retreated;  and we made believe there were other\nregiments to be shepherded, steering a northward course downhill toward\nbroken ground that couldn't have suited our purpose better.  By the way\nthose armored cars came after us, keeping their distance, it was clear\nenough that they suspected an ambush.\n\nSo we had a clear start and led them a dance in and out among boulders\nand the branches of a watercourse, Jeremy galloping ahead to spy a\ncourse out.  Whenever they came in view we acted a little piece for\nthem, making Rene wave the white cloth while I protected him and held\noff Mabel and Grim, who went through the motions of trying to brain me\nwith pistol butts.\n\nTwo or three times they opened fire, more by way of forcing a surrender,\nI think, than with any intention of hitting us;  they wanted to take\nFeisul alive.  It was like a game of fox and geese, and with Jeremy\nscouting ahead we could have kept them dodging us for hours if we hadn't\nrun out of gas.\n\nThen we abandoned the car and took refuge in a cave that stank as if it\nhad been a tomb for generations.  The French drew up their cars fifty\nyards away with machine-guns covering the cave mouth; and after we were\nsure they weren't going to squirt a stream of lead at us, I went out\nwith the tablecloth to negotiate terms.\n\nI didn't want to go, but Grim seemed to think they'd understand my\nFrench.\n\nOf course, there wasn't anything really to argue about, but I played for\ntime, because every minute was of value to the real Feisul, speeding on\nhis way to British territory.  The French officer who did the talking\nfor his side--a little squat, pale, pug-faced fellow, who gave the\nimpression of having risen from the ranks without learning polite\nmanners on the way, agreed to accept our surrender and spare our lives\nfor the time being;  and by that time the smell in the cave had nearly\novercome our party, so they all marched out.\n\nAnd Lord!  The French captain was spiteful when he discovered that\nJeremy wasn't Feisul after all.  He swore like a wet cat, accused Mabel\nof being a spy, took away our basket of provisions, and I think would\nhave shot Jeremy out of hand if Jeremy hadn't started clowning and made\nthe other Frenchmen laugh.\n\nLaughter and murder no more mix than oil and water.  He did what he\ncalled a harem dance for them, misusing his stomach outrageously, and\nthe incongruity of that by a descendant of the Prophet took all the\nsting out of the situation.  But they burned our abandoned car in sheer\nill temper before crowding us into their own.  And they shot the good\nhorse.\n\nThe joy-ride that followed was rather like the kind they give pigs on\nthe way to the sausage shop--hurried and not intended to be mirthful.\n\n\"What's the use of losing tempers?\" I asked Captain Jacques Daudet, who\nhad captured us.\n\nHe sat on my knees, with his pistol pressed against my chest. \"Why not\nregard the whole thing as a joke?  You've done your best and nobody can\nblame you.  Besides, what can possibly happen? What do you suppose\nthey'll do to us?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and his little cold blue eyes met mine.\n\n\"You will all be shot, of course,\" he answered.  \"After that...\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders again.  But he cast no gloom;  for Jeremy kept\nthe lot of us, French too, excepting Daudet, in roars of laughter for\nten miles until we reached temporary headquarters, where a born\ngentleman in a peaked red cap with gold on it sat on a camp-stool\ndirecting things.\n\nHe recognized Grim at the first glance and knew him for an American in\nBritish service.  He looked Grim in the eye and smiled.  We told our\nstory in turns, interrupting one another and being interrupted by Rene.\nThe officer turned on the banker savagely, ordered him sent to the rear,\nand smiled at Grim again.\n\nThen he picked up the banker's belongings, including the two packages,\nand tossed them after him with an air of utter contempt.\n\nWhereat he smiled at all of us.\n\n\"And you are quite sure that the Emir Feisul has escaped?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, there are those whom the news will annoy, which is too bad, but\ncan't be helped.  For myself, I cannot say that I shall shed tears.\nMadame...\"  He looked straight at Mabel.  \"Major...\" He met Grim's eyes\nand smiled.  \"Messieurs ...\"  It was my turn, and Narayan Singh's;  his\nsteady stare was good and made you feel like shaking hands with him.\n\"Monsieur Scapin (Clown)...\"  That was meant for Jeremy, and they both\nlaughed. \"You have been adroit, but do you think I could depend on your\ndiscretion?\"\n\nWe did our best to look discreet.\n\n\"You see, Madame et Messieurs, this is not warfare.  We desire to\naccomplish a definite object with as little unpleasantness as possible.\nI shall regret the necessity of sending you to Beirut, but that is for\nyour safety.  An additional and very sound precaution which you\nyourselves might take would be to preserve complete silence regarding\nthe events of the last two days.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n"}
