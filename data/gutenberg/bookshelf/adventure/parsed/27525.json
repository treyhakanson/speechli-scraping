They slipped forth\nand walked in single file to a suite of offices inscribed \"Pole\nBrothers, Brokers,\" and, beneath, \"The United Merchant Shippers'\nCorporation,\" and passed through a door which, in addition to this\ndeclaration, bore the footnote \"Private.\"\n\nHere the file divided, one going to one side of a vast pedestal desk\nand one to the other.  Still with their hands pushed deep into their\npockets, they sank, almost as at a word of command, each into his\ncushioned chair, and stared at one another across the table.\n\nThey were stout young men of the middle thirties, clean-shaven and\nruddy.  They had served their country in the late War, and had made\nmany sacrifices to the common cause.  One had worn uniform and one had\nnot.  Joe had occupied some mysterious office which permitted and,\nindeed, enjoined upon him the wearing of the insignia of captain, but\nhad forbidden him to leave his native land.  The other had earned a\nlittle decoration with a very big title as a buyer of boots for Allied\nnations.  Both had subscribed largely to War Stock, and a reminder of\ntheir devotion to the cause of liberty was placed to their credit every\nhalf-year.\n\nBut for these, war, with its horrific incidents, its late hours, its\nmidnight railway journeys by trains on which sleeping berths could not\nbe had for love or money, its food cards and statements of excess\nprofits, was past.  The present held its tragedy so poignant as to\novershadow that breathless terrifying moment when peace had come and\nfound the firm with the sale of the Fairy Line of cargo steamers\nuncompleted, contracts unsigned, and shipping stock which had lived\nlight-headedly in the airy spaces, falling deflated on the floor of the\nhouse.\n\nThe Fairy Line was not a large line.  It was, in truth, a small line.\nIt might have been purchased for two hundred thousand pounds, and\nnearly was.  To-day it might be acquired for one hundred and fifty\nthousand pounds, and yet it wasn't.\n\n\"Joe,\" said the senior Mr. Pole, in a voice that came from his\nvarnished boots, \"we've got to do something with Fairies.\"\n\n\"Curse this War!\" said Joe in cold-blooded even tones.  \"Curse the\nKaiser!  A weak-kneed devil who might at least have stuck to it for\nanother month!  Curse him for making America build ships, curse him\nfor----\"\n\n\"Joe,\" said the stout young man on the other side of the table, shaking\nhis head sadly, \"it is no use cursing, Joe.  We knew that they were\nbuilding ships, but the business looked good to me.  If Turkey hadn't\nturned up her toes and released all that shipping----\"\n\n\"Curse Turkey!\" said the other, with great calmness.  \"Curse the Sultan\nand Enver and Taalat, curse Bulgaria and Ferdinand----\"\n\n\"Put in one for the Bolsheviks, Joe,\" said his brother urgently, \"and I\nreckon that gets the lot in trouble.  Don't start on Austria, or we'll\nfind ourselves cursing the Jugo-Slavs.\"\n\nHe sighed deeply, pursed his lips, and looked at his writing-pad\nintently.\n\nJoe and Fred Pole had many faults, which they freely admitted, such as\ntheir generosity, their reckless kindness of heart, their willingness\nto do their worst enemies a good turn, and the like.  They had others\nwhich they never admitted, but which were none the less patent to their\nprejudiced contemporaries.\n\nBut they had virtues which were admirable.  They were, for example,\nabsolutely loyal to one another, and were constant in their mutual\nadmiration and help.  If Joe made a bad deal, Fred never rested until\nhe had balanced things against the beneficiary.  If Fred in a weak\nmoment paid a higher price to the vendor of a property than he, as\npromoter, could afford, it was Joe who took the smug vendor out to\ndinner and, by persuasion, argument, and the frank expression of his\nliking for the unfortunate man, tore away a portion of his ill-gotten\ngains.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Joe, concluding his minatory exercises, and reaching\nfor a cigar from the silver box which stood on the table midway between\nthe two, \"I suppose we couldn't hold Billing to his contract.  Have you\nseen Cole about it, Fred?\"\n\nThe other nodded slowly.\n\n\"Cole says that there is no contract.  Billing offered to buy the\nships, and meant to buy them, undoubtedly; but Cole says that if you\ntook Billing into court, the judge would chuck his pen in your eye.\"\n\n\"Would he now?\" said Joe, one of whose faults was that he took things\nliterally.  \"But perhaps if you took Billing out to dinner, Fred----\"\n\n\"He's a vegetarian, Joe\"--he reached in his turn for a cigar, snipped\nthe end and lit it--\"and he's deaf.  No, we've got to find a sucker,\nJoe.  I can sell the _Fairy May_ and the _Fairy Belle_: they're little\nboats, and are worth money in the open market.  I can sell the wharfage\nand offices and the goodwill----\"\n\n\"What's the goodwill worth, Fred?\"\n\n\"About fivepence net,\" said the gloomy Fred.  \"I can sell all these,\nbut it is the _Fairy Mary_ and the _Fairy Tilda_ that's breaking my\nheart.  And yet, Joe, there ain't two ships of their tonnage to be\nbought on the market.  If you wanted two ships of the same size and\nweight, you couldn't buy 'em for a million--no, you couldn't.  I guess\nthey must be bad ships, Joe.\"\n\nJoe had already guessed that.\n\n\"I offered 'em to Saddler, of the White Anchor,\" Fred went on, \"and he\nsaid that if he ever started collecting curios he'd remember me.  Then\nI tried to sell 'em to the Coastal Cargo Line--the very ships for the\nNewcastle and Thames river trade--and he said he couldn't think of it\nnow that the submarine season was over.  Then I offered 'em to young\nTopping, who thinks of running a line to the West Coast, but he said\nthat he didn't believe in Fairies or Santa Claus or any of that stuff.\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\n\"Who named 'em _Fairy Mary_ and _Fairy Tilda_?\" asked Joe curiously.\n\n\"Don't let's speak ill of the dead,\" begged Fred; \"the man who had 'em\nbuilt is no longer with us, Joe.  They say that joy doesn't kill, but\nthat's a lie, Joe.  He died two days after we took 'em over, and left\nall his money--all our money--to a nephew.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that,\" said Joe, sitting up.\n\n\"I didn't know it myself till the other day, when I took the deed of\nsale down to Cole to see if there wasn't a flaw in it somewhere.  I've\nwired him.\"\n\n\"Who--Cole?\"\n\n\"No, the young nephew.  If we could only----\"\n\nHe did not complete his sentence, but there was a common emotion and\nunderstanding in the two pairs of eyes that met.\n\n\"Who is he--anybody?\" asked Joe vaguely.\n\nFred broke off the ash of his cigar and nodded.\n\n\"Anybody worth half a million is somebody, Joe,\" he said seriously.\n\"This young fellow was in the Army.  He's out of it now, running a\nbusiness in the City--'Schemes, Ltd.,' he calls it.  Lots of people\nknow him--shipping people on the Coast.  He's got a horrible nickname.\"\n\n\"What's that, Fred?\"\n\n\"Bones,\" said Fred, in tones sufficiently sepulchral to be appropriate,\n\"and, Joe, he's one of those bones I want to pick.\"\n\nThere was another office in that great and sorrowful City.  It was\nperhaps less of an office than a boudoir, for it had been furnished on\nthe higher plan by a celebrated firm of furnishers and decorators,\nwhose advertisements in the more exclusive publications consisted of a\nset of royal arms, a photograph of a Queen Anne chair, and the bold\nsurname of the firm.  It was furnished with such exquisite taste that\nyou could neither blame nor praise the disposition of a couch or the\nset of a purple curtain.\n\nThe oxydized silver grate, the Persian carpets, the rosewood desk, with\nits Venetian glass flower vase, were all in harmony with the panelled\nwalls, the gentlemanly clock which ticked sedately on the Adam\nmantelpiece, the Sheraton chairs, the silver--or apparently so--wall\nsconces, the delicate electrolier with its ballet skirts of purple silk.\n\nAll these things were evidence of the careful upbringing and artistic\nyearnings of the young man who \"blended\" for the eminent firm of\nMessrs. Worrows, By Appointment to the King of Smyrna, His Majesty the\nEmperor ---- (the blank stands for an exalted name which had been\npainted out by the patriotic management of Worrows), and divers other\nroyalties.\n\nThe young man who sat in the exquisite chair, with his boots elevated\nto and resting upon the olive-green leather of the rosewood\nwriting-table, had long since grown familiar with the magnificence in\nwhich he moved and had his being.  He sat chewing an expensive\npaper-knife of ivory, not because he was hungry, but because he was\nbored.  He had entered into his kingdom brimful of confidence and with\nunimagined thousands of pounds to his credit in the coffers of the\nMidland and Somerset Bank.\n\nHe had brought with him a bright blue book, stoutly covered and\nbrassily locked, on which was inscribed the word \"Schemes.\"\n\nThat book was filled with writing of a most private kind and of a\nfrenzied calculation which sprawled diagonally over pages, as for\nexample:\n\n  Buy up old houses  . . . . . . . . . say  2,000 pounds.\n  Pull them down . . . . . . . . . . . say    500 pounds.\n  Erect erect 50 Grand Flats . . . . . say 10,000 pounds.\n  Paper, pante, windows, etc.  . . . . say  1,000 pounds.\n                                           ------\n        Total  . . . . . . . . . . . .     12,000 pounds.\n  50 Flats let at 80 pounds per annum.        40,000 lbs.\n  Net profit . . . . . . . . . . . . . say   50 per cent.\n\nNOTE.--For good middel class familys steady steady people.  By this\nmeans means doing good turn to working classes solving houseing problem\nand making money which can be distribbuted distribbutted to the poor.\n\n\nMr. Augustus Tibbetts, late of H.M. Houssa Rifles, was, as his\ndoorplate testified, the Managing Director of \"Schemes, Ltd.\"  He was a\nsevere looking young man, who wore a gold-rimmed monocle on his grey\ncheck waistcoat and occasionally in his left eye.  His face was of that\nbrick-red which spoke of a life spent under tropical suns, and when\nerect he conveyed a momentary impression of a departed militarism.\n\nHe uncurled his feet from the table, and, picking up a letter, read it\nthrough aloud--that is to say, he read certain words, skipped others,\nand substituted private idioms for all he could not or would not\ntrouble to pronounce.\n\n\"Dear Sir,\" (he mumbled), \"as old friends of your dear uncle, and so on\nand so forth, we are taking the first opportunity of making widdly\nwiddly wee....  Our Mr. Fred Pole will call upon you and place himself\nwiddly widdly wee--tum tiddly um tum.--Yours truly.\"\n\nMr. Tibbetts frowned at the letter and struck a bell with unnecessary\nviolence.  There appeared in the doorway a wonderful man in scarlet\nbreeches and green zouave jacket.  On his head was a dull red tarbosh,\non his feet scarlet slippers, and about his waist a sash of Oriental\naudacity.  His face, large and placid, was black, and, for all his\nsuggestiveness of the brilliant East, he was undoubtedly negroid.\n\nThe costume was one of Mr. Tibbetts's schemes.  It was faithfully\ncopied from one worn by a gentleman of colour who serves the Turkish\ncoffee at the Wistaria Restaurant.  It may be said that there was no\nspecial reason why an ordinary business man should possess a bodyguard\nat all, and less reason why he should affect one who had the appearance\nof a burlesque Othello, but Mr. Augustus Tibbetts, though a business\nman, was not ordinary.\n\n\"Bones\"--for such a name he bore without protest in the limited circles\nof his friendship--looked up severely.\n\n\"Ali,\" he demanded, \"have you posted the ledger?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali, with a profound obeisance, \"the article was too\ncopious for insertion in aperture of collection box, so it was\ntransferred to the female lady behind postal department counter.\"\n\nBones leapt up, staring.\n\n\"Goodness gracious, Heavens alive, you silly old ass--you--you haven't\nposted it--in the post?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali reproachfully, \"you instructed posting volume in exact\nformula.  Therefore I engulfed it in wrappings and ligatures of string,\nand safely delivered it to posting authority.\"\n\nBones sank back in his chair.\n\n\"It's no use--no use, Ali,\" he said sadly, \"my poor uncivilized savage,\nit's not your fault.  I shall never bring you up to date, my poor silly\nold josser.  When I say 'post' the ledger, I mean write down all the\nmoney you've spent on cabs in the stamp book.  Goodness gracious alive!\nYou can't run a business without system, Ali!  Don't you know that, my\ndear old image?  How the dooce do you think the auditors are to know\nhow I spend my jolly old uncle's money if you don't write it down, hey?\nPosting means writing.  Good Heavens\"--a horrid thought dawned on\nhim--\"who did you post it to?\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Ali calmly, \"destination of posted volume is your\nlordship's private residency.\"\n\nAll's English education had been secured in the laboratory of an\nEnglish scientist in Sierra Leone, and long association with that\nlearned man had endowed him with a vocabulary at once impressive and\nrecondite.\n\nBones gave a resigned sigh.\n\n\"I'm expecting----\" he began, when a silvery bell tinkled.\n\nIt was silvery because the bell was of silver.  Bones looked up, pulled\ndown his waistcoat, smoothed back his hair, fixed his eye-glass, and\ntook up a long quill pen with a vivid purple feather.\n\n\"Show them in,\" he said gruffly.\n\n\"Them\" was one well-dressed young man in a shiny silk hat, who, when\nadmitted to the inner sanctum, came soberly across the room, balancing\nhis hat.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Pole--Mr. Fred Pole.\"  Bones read the visitor's card with the\nscowl which he adopted for business hours.  \"Yes, yes.  Be seated, Mr.\nPole.  I shall not keep you a minute.\"\n\nHe had been waiting all the morning for Mr. Pole.  He had been weaving\ndreams from the letter-heading above Mr. Pole's letter.\n\nShips ... ships ... house-flags ... brass-buttoned owners....\n\nHe waved Mr. Fred to a chair and wrote furiously.  This frantic\npressure of work was a phenomenon which invariably coincided with the\narrival of a visitor.  It was, I think, partly due to nervousness and\npartly to his dislike of strangers.  Presently he finished, blotted the\npaper, stuck it in an envelope, addressed it, and placed it in his\ndrawer.  Then he took up the card.\n\n\"Mr. Pole?\" he said.\n\n\"Mr. Pole,\" repeated that gentleman.\n\n\"Mr. _Fred_ Pole?\" asked Bones, with an air of surprise.\n\n\"Mr. Fred Pole,\" admitted the other soberly.\n\nBones looked from the card to the visitor as though he could not\nbelieve his eyes.\n\n\"We have a letter from you somewhere,\" he said, searching the desk.\n\"Ah, here it is!\"  (It was, in fact, the only document on the table.)\n\"Yes, yes, to be sure.  I'm very glad to meet you.\"\n\nHe rose, solemnly shook hands, sat down again and coughed.  Then he\ntook up the ivory paper-knife to chew, coughed again as he detected the\nlapse, and put it down with a bang.\n\n\"I thought I'd like to come along and see you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred\nin his gentle voice; \"we are so to speak, associated in business.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Bones.  \"In-deed?\"\n\n\"You see, Mr. Tibbetts,\" Fred went on, with a sad smile, \"your lamented\nuncle, before he went out of business, sold us his ships.  He died a\nmonth later.\"\n\nHe sighed and Bones sighed.\n\n\"Your uncle was a great man, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, \"one of the\ngreatest business men in this little city.  What a man!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Bones, shaking his head mournfully.\n\nHe had never met his uncle and had seldom heard of him.  Saul Tibbetts\nwas reputedly a miser, and his language was of such violence that the\ninfant Augustus was invariably hurried to the nursery on such rare\noccasions as old Saul paid a family visit.  His inheritance had come to\nBones as in a dream, from the unreality of which he had not yet\nawakened.\n\n\"I must confess, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred, \"that I have often had\nqualms of conscience about your uncle, and I have been on the point of\ncoming round to see you several times.  This morning I said to my\nbrother, 'Joe,' I said, 'I'm going round to see Tibbetts.'  Forgive the\nfamiliarity, but we talk of firms like the Rothschilds and the Morgans\nwithout any formality.\"\n\n\"Naturally, naturally, naturally,\" murmured Bones gruffly.\n\n\"I said: 'I'll go and see Tibbetts and get it off my chest.  If he\nwants those ships back at the price we paid for them, or even less, he\nshall have them.'  'Fred,' he said, 'you're too sensitive for\nbusiness.'  'Joe,' I said, 'my conscience works even in business\nhours.'\"\n\nA light dawned on Bones and he brightened visibly.\n\n\"Ah, yes, my dear old Pole,\" he said almost cheerily, \"I understand.\nYou diddled my dear old uncle--bless his heart--out of money, and you\nwant to pay it back.  Fred\"--Bones rose and extended his knuckly\nhand--\"you're a jolly old sportsman, and you can put it there!\"\n\n\"What I was going to say----\" began Fred seriously agitated.\n\n\"Not a word.  We'll have a bottle on this.  What will you\nhave--ginger-beer or cider?\"\n\nMr. Fred suppressed a shudder with difficulty.\n\n\"Wait, wait, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he begged; \"I think I ought to explain.  We\ndid not, of course, knowingly rob your uncle----\"\n\n\"No, no, naturally,\" said Bones, with a facial contortion which passed\nfor a wink.  \"Certainly not.  We business men never rob anybody.  Ali,\nbring the drinks!\"\n\n\"We did not consciously rob him,\" continued Mr. Fred desperately, \"but\nwhat we did do---- ah, this is my confession!\"\n\n\"You borrowed a bit and didn't pay it back.  Ah, naughty!\" said Bones.\n\"Out with the corkscrew, Ali.  What shall it be--a cream soda or\nnon-alcoholic ale?\"\n\nMr. Fred looked long and earnestly at the young man.\n\n\"Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, and suddenly grasped the hand of Bones, \"I\nhope we are going to be friends.  I like you.  That's my peculiarity--I\nlike people or I dislike them.  Now that I've told you that we bought\ntwo ships from your uncle for one hundred and forty thousand pounds\nwhen we knew--yes, positively knew--they were worth at least twenty\nthousand pounds more--now I've told you this, I feel happier.\"\n\n\"Worth twenty thousand pounds more?\" said Bones thoughtfully.\nProvidence was working overtime for him, he thought.\n\n\"Of anybody's money,\" said Fred stoutly.  \"I don't care where you go,\nmy dear chap.  Ask Cole--he's the biggest shipping lawyer in this\ncity--ask my brother, who, I suppose, is the greatest shipping\nauthority in the world, or--what's the use of asking 'em?--ask\nyourself.  If you're not Saul Tibbetts all over again, if you haven't\nthe instinct and the eye and the brain of a shipowner--why, I'm a\nDutchman!  That's what I am--a Dutchman!\"\n\nHe picked up his hat and his lips were pressed tight--a gesture and a\ngrimace which stood for grim conviction.\n\n\"What are they worth to-day?\" asked Bones, after a pause.\n\n\"What are they worth to-day?\"  Mr. Fred frowned heavily at the ceiling.\n\"Now, what are they worth to-day?  I forget how much I've spent on\n'em--they're in dock now.\"\n\nBones tightened _his_ lips, too.\n\n\"They're in dock now?\" he said.  He scratched his nose.  \"Dear old Fred\nPole,\" he said, \"you're a jolly old soul.  By Jove that's not bad!\n'Pole' an' 'soul' rhyme--did you notice it?\"\n\nFred had noticed it.\n\n\"It's rum,\" said Bones, shaking his head, \"it is rum how things get\nabout.  How did you know, old fellow-citizen, that I was going in for\nshippin'?\"\n\nMr. Fred Pole did not know that Bones was going in for shipping, but he\nsmiled.\n\n\"There are few things that happen in the City that I _don't_ know,\" he\nadmitted modestly.\n\n\"The Tibbetts Line,\" said Bones firmly, \"will fly a house-flag of\npurple and green diagonally--that is, from corner to corner.  There\nwill be a yellow anchor in a blue wreath in one corner and a capital T\nin a red wreath in the other.\"\n\n\"Original, distinctly original,\" said Fred in wondering admiration.\n\"Wherever did you get that idea?\"\n\n\"I get ideas,\" confessed Bones, blushing, \"some times in the night,\nsometimes in the day.  The fleet\"--Bones liked the sound of the word\nand repeated it--\"the fleet will consist of the _Augustus_, the\n_Sanders_--a dear old friend of mine living at Hindhead--the\n_Patricia_--another dear old friend of mine living at Hindhead, too--in\nfact, in the same house.  To tell you the truth, dear old Fred Pole,\nshe's married to the other ship.  And there'll be the _Hamilton_,\nanother precious old soul, a very, very, very, very dear friend of mine\nwho's comin' home shortly----\"\n\n\"Well, what shall we say, Mr. Tibbetts?\" said Fred, who had an early\nluncheon appointment.  \"Would you care to buy the two boats at the same\nprice we gave your uncle for them?\"\n\nBones rang his bell.\n\n\"I'm a business man, dear old Fred,\" said he soberly.  \"There's no time\nlike the present, and I'll fix the matter--_now!_\"\n\nHe said \"now\" with a ferociousness which was intended to emphasize his\nhard and inflexible business character.\n\nFred came into the private office of Pole & Pole after lunch that day,\nand there was in his face a great light and a peace which was almost\nbeautiful.\n\nBut never beamed the face of Fred so radiantly as the countenance of\nthe waiting Joe.  He lay back in his chair, his cigar pointing to the\nceiling.\n\n\"Well, Fred?\"--there was an anthem in his voice.\n\n\"Very well, Joe.\"  Fred hung up his unnecessary umbrella.\n\n\"I've sold the _Fairies_!\"\n\nJoe said it and Fred said it.  They said it together.  There was the\nsame lilt of triumph in each voice, and both smiles vanished at the\nidentical instant.\n\n\"_You've_ sold the _Fairies_!\" they said.\n\nThey might have been rehearsing this scene for months, so perfect was\nthe chorus.\n\n\"Wait a bit, Joe,\" said Fred; \"let's get the hang of this.  I\nunderstand that you left the matter to me.\"\n\n\"I did; but, Fred, I was so keen on the idea I had that I had to nip in\nbefore you.  Of course, I didn't go to him as Pole & Pole----\"\n\n\"To him?  What him?\" asked Fred, breathing hard.\n\n\"To What's-his-name--Bones.\"\n\nFred took his blue silk handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his\nface.\n\n\"Go on, Joe,\" he said sadly\n\n\"I got him just before he went out to lunch.  I sent up the United\nMerchant Shippers' card--it's our company, anyway.  Not a word about\nPole & Pole.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, of course not!\" said Fred.\n\n\"And, my boy,\"--this was evidently Joe's greatest achievement, for he\ndescribed the fact with gusto--\"not a word about the names of the\nships.  I just sold him two steamers, so and so tonnage, so and so\nclassification----\"\n\n\"For how much?\"\n\nFred was mildly curious.  It was the curiosity which led a certain\npolitical prisoner to feel the edge of the axe before it beheaded him.\n\n\"A hundred and twenty thousand!\" cried Joe joyously.  \"He's starting a\nfleet, he says.  He's calling it the Tibbetts Line, and bought a couple\nof ships only this morning.\"\n\nFred examined the ceiling carefully before he spoke.\n\n\"Joe,\" he said, \"was it a firm deal?  Did you put pen to paper?\"\n\n\"You-bet-your-dear-sweet-life,\" said Joe, scornful at the suggestion\nthat he had omitted such an indispensable part of the negotiation.\n\n\"So did I, Joe,\" said Fred.  \"Those two ships he bought were the two\n_Fairies_.\"\n\nThere was a dead silence.\n\n\"Well,\" said Joe uneasily, after a while, \"we can get a couple of\nships----\"\n\n\"Where, Joe?  You admitted yesterday there weren't two boats in the\nworld on the market.\"\n\nAnother long silence.\n\n\"I did it for the best, Fred.\"\n\nFred nodded\n\n\"Something must be done.  We can't sell a man what we haven't got.\nJoe, couldn't you go and play golf this afternoon whilst I wangle this\nmatter out?\"\n\nJoe nodded and rose solemnly.  He took down his umbrella from the peg\nand his shiny silk hat from another peg, and tiptoed from the room.\n\nFrom three o'clock to four Mr. Fred Pole sat immersed in thought, and\nat last, with a big, heavy sigh, he unlocked his safe, took out his\ncheque-book and pocketed it.\n\nBones was on the point of departure, after a most satisfactory day's\nwork, when Fred Pole was announced.\n\nBones greeted him like unto a brother--caught him by the hand at the\nvery entrance and, still holding him thus, conducted him to one of his\nbeautiful chairs.\n\n\"By Jove, dear old Fred,\" he babbled, \"it's good of you, old\nfellow--really good of you!  Business, my jolly old shipowner, waits\nfor no man.  Ali, my cheque-book!\"\n\n\"A moment--just a moment, dear Mr. Bones,\" begged Fred.  \"You don't\nmind my calling you by the name which is already famous in the City?\"\n\nBones looked dubious.\n\n\"Personally, I prefer Tibbetts,\" said Fred.\n\n\"Personally, dear old Fred, so do I,\" admitted Bones.\n\n\"I've come on a curious errand,\" said Fred in such hollow tones that\nBones started.  \"The fact is, old man, I'm----\"\n\nHe hung his head, and Bones laid a sympathetic hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Anybody is liable to get that way, my jolly old roysterer,\" he said.\n\"Speakin' for myself, drink has no effect upon me--due to my jolly old\nnerves of iron an' all that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"I'm ashamed of myself,\" said Fred.\n\n\"Nothing to be ashamed of, my poor old toper,\" said Bones honestly in\nerror.  \"Why, I remember once----\"\n\n\"As a business man, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred bravely, \"can you forgive\nsentiment?\"\n\n\"Sentiment!  Why, you silly old josser, I'm all sentiment, dear old\nthing!  Why, I simply cry myself to sleep over dear old Charles\nWhat's-his-name's books!\"\n\n\"It's sentiment,\" said Fred brokenly.  \"I just can't--I simply can't\npart with those two ships I sold you.\"\n\n\"Hey?\" said Bones.\n\n\"They were your uncle's, but they have an association for me and my\nbrother which it would be--er--profane to mention.  Mr. Tibbetts, let\nus cry off our bargain.\"\n\nBones sniffed and rubbed his nose.\n\n\"Business, dear old Fred,\" he said gently.  \"Bear up an' play the man,\nas dear old Francis Drake said when they stopped him playin' cricket.\nBusiness, old friend.  I'd like to oblige you, but----\"\n\nHe shook his head rapidly\n\nMr. Fred slowly produced his cheque-book and laid it on the desk with\nthe sigh of one who was about to indite his last wishes.\n\n\"You shall not be the loser,\" he said, with a catch in his voice, for\nhe was genuinely grieved.  \"I must pay for my weakness.  What is five\nhundred pounds?\"\n\n\"What is a thousand, if it comes to that, Freddy?\" said Bones.\n\"Gracious goodness, I shall be awfully disappointed if you back out--I\nshall be so vexed, really.\"\n\n\"Seven hundred and fifty?\" asked Fred, with pleading in his eye.\n\n\"Make it a thousand, dear old Fred,\" said Bones; \"I can't add up\nfifties.\"\n\nSo \"in consideration\" (as Fred wrote rapidly and Bones signed more\nrapidly) \"of the sum of one thousand pounds (say \u00a31,000), the contract\nas between &c., &c.,\" was cancelled, and Fred became again the\npractical man of affairs.\n\n\"Dear old Fred,\" said Bones, folding the cheque and sticking it in his\npocket, \"I'm goin' to own up--frankness is a vice with me--that I don't\nunderstand much about the shippin' business.  But tell me, my jolly old\nmerchant, why do fellers sell you ships in the mornin' an' buy 'em back\nin the afternoon?\"\n\n\"Business, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred, smiling, \"just big business.\"\n\nBones sucked an inky finger.\n\n\"Dinky business for me, dear old thing,\" he said.  \"I've got a thousand\nfrom you an' a thousand from the other Johnny who sold me two ships.\nBless my life an' soul----\"\n\n\"The other fellow,\" said Fred faintly--\"a fellow from the United\nMerchant Shippers?\"\n\n\"That was the dear lad,\" said Bones.\n\n\"And has he cried off his bargain, too?\"\n\n\"Positively!\" said Bones.  \"A very, very nice, fellow.  He told me I\ncould call him Joe--jolly old Joe!\"\n\n\"Jolly old Joe!\" repeated Fred mechanically, as he left the office, and\nall the way home he was saying \"Jolly old Joe!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nHIDDEN TREASURE\n\nMrs. Staleyborn's first husband was a dreamy Fellow of a Learned\nUniversity.\n\nHer second husband had begun life at the bottom of the ladder as a\nthree-card trickster, and by strict attention to business and the\nexercise of his natural genius, had attained to the proprietorship of a\nbucket-shop.\n\nWhen Mrs. Staleyborn was Miss Clara Smith, she had been housekeeper to\nProfessor Whitland, a biologist who discovered her indispensability,\nand was only vaguely aware of the social gulf which yawned between the\nyoungest son of the late Lord Bortledyne and the only daughter of\nAlbert Edward Smith, mechanic.  To the Professor she was Miss _H.\nSapiens_--an agreeable, featherless plantigrade biped of the genus\n_Homo_.  She was also thoroughly domesticated and cooked like an angel,\na nice woman who apparently never knew that her husband had a Christian\nname, for she called him \"Mr. Whitland\" to the day of his death.\n\nThe strain and embarrassment of the new relationship with her master\nwere intensified by the arrival of a daughter, and doubled when that\ndaughter came to a knowledgeable age.  Marguerite Whitland had the\ninherent culture of her father and the grace and delicate beauty which\nhad ever distinguished the women of the house of Bortledyne.\n\nWhen the Professor died, Mrs. Whitland mourned him in all sincerity.\nShe was also relieved.  One-half of the burden which lay upon her had\nbeen lifted; the second half was wrestling with the binomial theorem at\nCheltenham College.\n\nShe had been a widow twelve months when she met Mr. Cresta Morris, and,\nif the truth be told, Mr. Cresta Morris more fulfilled her conception\nas to what a gentleman should look like than had the Professor.  Mr.\nCresta Morris wore white collars and beautiful ties, had a large gold\nwatch-chain over what the French call poetically a _gilet de fantasie_,\nbut which he, in his own homely fashion, described as a \"fancy weskit.\"\nHe smoked large cigars, was bluff and hearty, spoke to the widow--he\nwas staying at Harrogate at the time in a hydropathic establishment--in\na language which she could understand.  Dimly she began to realize that\nthe Professor had hardly spoken to her at all.\n\nMr. Cresta Morris was one of those individuals who employed a\nvocabulary of a thousand words, with all of which Mrs. Whitland was\nwell acquainted; he was also a man of means and possessions, he\nexplained to her.  She, giving confidence for confidence, told of the\nhouse at Cambridge, the furniture, the library, the annuity of three\nhundred pounds, earmarked for his daughter's education, but mistakenly\nleft to his wife for that purpose, also the four thousand three hundred\npounds invested in War Stock, which was wholly her own.\n\nMr. Cresta Morris became more agreeable than ever.  In three months\nthey were married, in six months the old house at Cambridge had been\ndisposed of, the library dispersed, as much of the furniture as Mr.\nMorris regarded as old-fashioned sold, and the relict of Professor\nWhitland was installed in a house in Brockley.\n\nIt was a nice house--in many ways nicer than the rambling old building\nin Cambridge, from Mrs. Morris's point of view.  And she was happy in a\ntolerable, comfortable kind of fashion, and though she was wholly\nignorant as to the method by which her husband made his livelihood, she\nmanaged to get along very well without enlightenment.\n\nMarguerite was brought back from Cheltenham to grace the new\nestablishment and assist in its management.  She shared none of her\nmother's illusions as to the character of Mr. Cresta Morris, as that\ngentleman explained to a very select audience one January night.\n\nMr. Morris and his two guests sat before a roaring fire in the\ndining-room, drinking hot brandies-and-waters.  Mrs. Morris had gone to\nbed; Marguerite was washing up, for Mrs. Morris had the \"servant's\nmind,\" which means that she could never keep a servant.\n\nThe sound of crashing plates had come to the dining-room and\ninterrupted Mr. Morris at a most important point of his narrative.  He\njerked his head round.\n\n\"That's the girl,\" he said; \"she's going to be a handful.\"\n\n\"Get her married,\" said Job Martin wisely.\n\nHe was a hatchet-faced man with a reputation for common-sense.  He had\nanother reputation which need not be particularized at the moment.\n\n\"Married?\" scoffed Mr. Morris.  \"Not likely!\"\n\nHe puffed at his cigar thoughtfully for a moment, then:\n\n\"She wouldn't come in to dinner--did you notice that?  We are not good\nenough for her.  She's fly!  Fly ain't the word for it.  We always find\nher nosing and sneaking around.\"\n\n\"Send her back to school,\" said the third guest.\n\nHe was a man of fifty-five, broad-shouldered, clean-shaven, who had\nliterally played many parts, for he had been acting in a touring\ncompany when Morris first met him--Mr. Timothy Webber, a man not\nunknown to the Criminal Investigation Department.\n\n\"She might have been useful,\" Mr. Morris went on regretfully, \"very\nuseful indeed.  She is as pretty as a picture, I'll give her that due.\nNow, suppose she----\"\n\nWebber shook his head.\n\n\"It's my way or no way,\" he said decidedly.  \"I've been a month\nstudying this fellow, and I tell you I know him inside out.\"\n\n\"Have you been to see him?\" asked the second man.\n\n\"Am I a fool?\" replied the other roughly.  \"Of course I have not been\nto see him.  But there are ways of finding out, aren't there?  He is\nnot the kind of lad that you can work with a woman, not if she's as\npretty as paint.\"\n\n\"What do they call him?\" asked Morris.\n\n\"Bones,\" said Webber, with a little grin.  \"At least, he has letters\nwhich start 'Dear Bones,' so I suppose that's his nickname.  But he's\ngot all the money in the world.  He is full of silly ass schemes, and\nhe's romantic.\"\n\n\"What's that to do with it?\" asked Job Martin, and Webber turned with a\ndespairing shrug to Morris.\n\n\"For a man who is supposed to have brains----\" he said, but Morris\nstopped him with a gesture.\n\n\"I see the idea--that's enough.\"\n\nHe ruminated again, chewing at his cigar, then, with a shake of his\nhead----\n\n\"I wish the girl was in it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Webber curiously.\n\n\"Because she's----\"  He hesitated.  \"I don't know what she knows about\nme.  I can guess what she guesses.  I'd like to get her into something\nlike this, to--to----\"  He was at a loss for a word.\n\n\"Compromise?\" suggested the more erudite Webber.\n\n\"That's the word.  I'd like to have her like that!\"  He put his thumb\ndown on the table in an expressive gesture.\n\nMarguerite, standing outside, holding the door-handle hesitating as to\nwhether she should carry in the spirit kettle which Mr. Morris had\nordered, stood still and listened.\n\nThe houses in Oakleigh Grove were built in a hurry, and at best were\nnot particularly sound-proof.  She stood fully a quarter of an hour\nwhilst the three men talked in low tones, and any doubts she might have\nhad as to the nature of her step-father's business were dispelled.\n\nAgain there began within her the old fight between her loyalty to her\nmother and loyalty to herself and her own ideals.  She had lived\nthrough purgatory these past twelve months, and again and again she had\nresolved to end it all, only to be held by pity for the helpless woman\nshe would be deserting.  She told herself a hundred times that her\nmother was satisfied in her placid way with the life she was living,\nand that her departure would be rather a relief than a cause for\nuneasiness.  Now she hesitated no longer, and went back to the kitchen,\ntook off the apron she was wearing, passed along the side-passage, up\nthe stairs to her room, and began to pack her little bag.\n\nHer mother was facing stark ruin.  This man had drawn into his hands\nevery penny she possessed, and was utilizing it for the furtherance of\nhis own nefarious business.  She had an idea--vague as yet, but later\ntaking definite shape--that if she might not save her mother from the\nwreck which was inevitable, she might at least save something of her\nlittle fortune.\n\nShe had \"nosed around\" to such purpose that she had discovered her\nstep-father was a man who for years had evaded the grip of an\nexasperated constabulary.  Some day he would fall, and in his fall\nbring down her mother.\n\nMr. Cresta Morris absorbed in the elaboration of the great plan, was\nreminded, by the exhaustion of visible refreshment, that certain of his\ninstructions had not been carried out.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" he said.  \"I told that girl to bring in the kettle at\nhalf-past nine.  I'll go out and get it.  Her royal highness wouldn't\nlower herself by bringing it in, I suppose!\"\n\nHe found the kettle on the kitchen table, but there was no sign of\nMarguerite.  This was the culmination of a succession of \"slights\"\nwhich she had put on him, and in a rage he walked along the passage,\nand yelled up the stairs:\n\n\"Marguerite!\"\n\nThere was no reply, and he raced up to her room.  It was empty, but\nwhat was more significant, her dresses and the paraphernalia which\nusually ornamented her dressing-table had disappeared.\n\nHe came down a very thoughtful man.\n\n\"She's hopped,\" he said laconically.  \"I was always afraid of that.\"\n\nIt was fully an hour before he recovered sufficiently to bring his mind\nto a scheme of such fascinating possibilities that even his\nstep-daughter's flight was momentarily forgotten\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nOn the following morning Mr. Tibbetts received a visitor.\n\nThat gentleman who was, according to the information supplied by Mr.\nWebber, addressed in intimate correspondence as \"Dear Bones,\" was\nsitting in his most gorgeous private office, wrestling with a letter to\nthe eminent firm of Timmins and Timmins, yacht agents, on a matter of a\nluckless purchase of his.\n\n\n\"DEAR SIRS GENENTLEMEN\" (ran the letter.  Bones wrote as he thought,\nthought faster than he wrote, and never opened a dictionary save to\ndecide a bet)--\"I told you I have told you 100000 times that the yacht\n_Luana_ I bought from your cleint (a nice cleint I must say!!!) is a\nfrord fruad and a _swindel_.  It is much two too big.  2000 pounds was\na swindel outraygious!!  Well I've got it got it now so theres theirs\nno use crying over split milk.  But do like a golly old yaght-seller\nget red of it rid of it.  Sell it to _anybody_ even for a 1000 pounds.\nI must have been mad to buy it but he was such a plausuble chap....\"\n\n\nThis and more he wrote and was writing, when the silvery bell announced\na visitor.  It rang many times before he realized that he had sent his\nfactotum, Ali Mahomet, to the South Coast to recover from a\nsniffle--the after-effects of a violent cold--which had been\nparticularly distressing to both.  Four times the bell rang, and four\ntimes Bones raised his head and scowled at the door, muttering violent\ncriticisms of a man who at that moment was eighty-five miles away.\n\nThen he remembered, leapt up, sprinted to the door, flung it open with\nan annoyed:\n\n\"Come in!  What the deuce are you standing out there for?\"\n\nThen he stared at his visitor, choked, went very red, choked again, and\nfixed his monocle.\n\n\"Come in, young miss, come in,\" he said gruffly.  \"Jolly old bell's out\nof order.  Awfully sorry and all that sort of thing.  Sit down, won't\nyou?\"\n\nIn the outer office there was no visible chair.  The excellent Ali\npreferred sitting on the floor, and visitors were not encouraged.\n\n\"Come into my office,\" said Bones, \"my private office.\"\n\nThe girl had taken him in with one comprehensive glance, and a little\nsmile trembled on the corner of her lips as she followed the harassed\nfinancier into his \"holy of holies.\"\n\n\"My little den,\" said Bones incoherently.  \"Sit down, jolly old--young\nmiss.  Take my chair--it's the best.  Mind how you step over that\ntelephone wire.  Ah!\"\n\nShe did catch her feet in the flex, and he sprang to her assistance.\n\n\"Upsy, daisy, dear old--young miss, I mean.\"\n\nIt was a breathless welcome.  She herself was startled by the warmth of\nit; he, for his part, saw nothing but grey eyes and a perfect mouth,\nsensed nothing but a delicate fragrance of a godlike presence.\n\n\"I have come to see you----\" she began.\n\n\"Jolly good of you,\" said Bones enthusiastically.  \"You've no idea how\nfearsomely lonely I get sometimes.  I often say to people: 'Look me up,\ndear old thing, any time between ten and twelve or two and four; don't\nstand on ceremony----'\"\n\n\"I've come to see you----\" she began again.\n\n\"You're a kind young miss,\" murmured Bones, and she laughed.\n\n\"You're not used to having girls in this office, are you?\"\n\n\"You're the first,\" said Bones, with a dramatic flourish, \"that ever\nburst tiddly-um-te-um!\"\n\nTo be mistaken for a welcome visitor--she was that, did she but guess\nit--added to her natural embarrassment.\n\n\"Well,\" she said desperately, \"I've come for work.\"\n\nHe stared at her, refixing his monocle.\n\n\"You've come for work my dear old--my jolly old--young miss?\"\n\n\"I've come for work,\" she nodded.\n\nBones's face was very grave.\n\n\"You've come for work.\"  He thought a moment; then: \"What work?  Of\ncourse,\" he added in a flurry, \"there's plenty of work to do!  Believe\nme, you don't know the amount I get through in this sanctum--that's\nLatin for 'private office'--and the wretched old place is never\ntidy--never!  I am seriously thinking\"--he frowned--\"yes, I am very\nseriously thinking of sacking the lady who does the dusting.  Why, do\nyou know, this morning----\"\n\nHer eyes were smiling now, and she was to Bones's unsophisticated eyes,\nand, indeed, to eyes sophisticated, superhumanly lovely.\n\n\"I haven't come for a dusting job,\" she laughed.\n\n\"Of course you haven't,\" said Bones in a panic.  \"My dear old lady--my\nprecious--my young person, I should have said--of course you haven't!\nYou've come for a job--you've come to work!  Well, you shall have it!\nStart right away!\"\n\nShe stared.\n\n\"What shall I do?\" she asked.\n\n\"What would I like you to do?\" said Bones slowly.  \"What about\nscheming, getting out ideas, using brains, initiative, bright----\"  He\ntrailed off feebly as she shook her head.\n\n\"Do you want a secretary?\" she asked, and Bones's enthusiasm rose to\nthe squeaking point.\n\n\"The very thing!  I advertised in this morning's _Times_.  You saw the\nadvertisement?\"\n\n\"You are not telling the truth,\" she said, looking at him with eyes\nthat danced.  \"I read all the advertisement columns in _The Times_ this\nmorning, and I am quite sure that you did not advertise.\"\n\n\"I meant to advertise,\" said Bones gently.  \"I had the idea last night;\nthat's the very piece of paper I was writing the advertisement on.\"\n\nHe pointed to a sheet upon the pad.\n\n\"A secretary?  The very thing!  Let me think.\"\n\nHe supported his chin upon one hand, his elbow upon another.\n\n\"You will want paper, pens, and ink--we have all those,\" he said.\n\"There is a large supply in that cupboard.  Also india-rubber.  I am\nnot sure if we have any india-rubber, but that can be procured.  And a\nruler,\" he said, \"for drawing straight lines and all that sort of\nthing.\"\n\n\"And a typewriter?\" she suggested.\n\nBones smacked his forehead with unnecessary violence.\n\n\"A typewriter!  I knew this office wanted something.  I said to Ali\nyesterday: 'You silly old ass----'\"\n\n\"Oh, you have a girl?\" she said disappointedly.\n\n\"Ali,\" said Bones, \"is the name of a native man person who is devoted\nto me, body and soul.  He has been, so to speak, in the family for\nyears,\" he explained.\n\n\"Oh, it's a man,\" she said.\n\nBones nodded.\n\n\"Ali.  Spelt A-l-y; it's Arabic.\"\n\n\"A native?\"\n\nBones nodded.\n\n\"Of course he will not be in your way,\" ha hastened to explain.  \"He is\nin Bournemouth just now.  He had sniffles.\"  he explained rapidly, \"and\nthen he used to go to sleep, and snore.  I hate people who snore, don't\nyou?\"\n\nShe laughed again.  This was the most amazing of all possible employers.\n\n\"Of course,\" Bones went on, \"I snore a bit myself.  All thinkers do--I\nmean all brainy people.  Not being a jolly old snorer yourself----\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the girl.\n\nOther tenants or the satellites of other tenants who occupied the\npalatial buildings wherein the office of Bones was situated saw, some\nfew minutes later, a bare-headed young man dashing down the stairs\nthree at a time; met him, half an hour later, staggering up those same\nstairs handicapped by a fifty-pound typewriter in one hand, and a chair\nin the style of the late Louis Quinze in the other, and wondered at the\nurgency of his movements.\n\n\"I want to tell you,\" said the girl, \"that I know very little about\nshorthand.\"\n\n\"Shorthand is quite unnecessary, my dear--my jolly old stenographer,\"\nsaid Bones firmly.  \"I object to shorthand on principle, and I shall\nalways object to it.  If people,\" he went on, \"were intended to write\nshorthand, they would have been born without the alphabet.  Another\nthing----\"\n\n\"One moment, Mr. Tibbetts,\" she said.  \"I don't know a great deal about\ntypewriting, either.\"\n\nBones beamed.\n\n\"There I can help you,\" he said.  \"Of course it isn't necessary that\nyou should know anything about typewriting.  But I can give you a few\nhints,\" he said.  \"This thing, when you jiggle it up and down, makes\nthe thingummy-bob run along.  Every time you hit one of these\nletters----  I'll show you....  Now, suppose I am writing 'Dear Sir,' I\nstart with a 'D.'  Now, where's that jolly old 'D'?\"  He scowled at the\nkeyboard, shook his head, and shrugged his shoulders.  \"I thought so,\"\nhe said; \"there ain't a 'D.'  I had an idea that that wicked old----\"\n\n\"Here's the 'D,'\" she pointed out.\n\nBones spent a strenuous but wholly delightful morning and afternoon.\nHe was half-way home to his chambers in Curzon Street before he\nrealized that he had not fixed the rather important question of salary.\nHe looked forward to another pleasant morning making good that lapse.\n\nIt was his habit to remain late at his office at least three nights a\nweek, for Bones was absorbed in his new career.\n\n\"Schemes Ltd.\" was no meaningless title.  Bones had schemes which\nembraced every field of industrial, philanthropic, and social activity.\nHe had schemes for building houses, and schemes for planting rose trees\nalong all the railway tracks.  He had schemes for building motor-cars,\nfor founding labour colonies, for harnessing the rise and fall of the\ntides, he had a scheme for building a theatre where the audience sat on\na huge turn-table, and, at the close of one act, could be twisted\nround, with no inconvenience to themselves, to face a stage which has\nbeen set behind them.  Piqued by a certain strike which had caused him\na great deal of inconvenience, he was engaged one night working out a\nscheme for the provision of municipal taxicabs, and he was so absorbed\nin his wholly erroneous calculations that for some time he did not hear\nthe angry voices raised outside the door of his private office.\n\nPerhaps it was that that portion of his mind which had been left free\nto receive impressions was wholly occupied with a scheme--which\nappeared in no books or records--for raising the wages of his new\nsecretary.\n\nBut presently the noise penetrated even to him, and he looked up with a\ntouch of annoyance.\n\n\"At this hour of the night! ...  Goodness gracious ... respectable\nbuilding!\"\n\nHis disjointed comments were interrupted by the sound of a scuffle, an\noath, a crash against his door and a groan, and Bones sprang to the\ndoor and threw it open.\n\nAs he did so a man who was leaning against it fell in.\n\n\"Shut the door, quick!\" he gasped, and Bones obeyed.\n\nThe visitor who had so rudely irrupted himself was a man of middle age,\nwearing a coarse pea-jacket and blue jersey of a seaman, his peaked hat\ncovered with dust, as Bones perceived later, when the sound of\nscurrying footsteps had died away.\n\nThe man was gripping his left arm as if in pain, and a thin trickle of\nred was running down the back of his big hand.\n\n\"Sit down, my jolly old mariner,\" said Bones anxiously.  \"What's the\nmatter with you?  What's the trouble, dear old sea-dog?\"\n\nThe man looked up at him with a grimace.\n\n\"They nearly got it, the swine!\" he growled.\n\nHe rolled up his sleeve and, deftly tying a handkerchief around a red\npatch, chuckled:\n\n\"It is only a scratch,\" he said.  \"They've been after me for two days,\nHarry Weatherall and Jim Curtis.  But right's right all the world over.\nI've suffered enough to get what I've got--starved on the high seas,\nand starved on Lomo Island.  Is it likely that I'm going to let them\nshare?\"\n\nBones shook his head.\n\n\"You sit down, my dear old fellow,\" he said sympathetically.\n\nThe man thrust his hands laboriously into his inside pocket and pulled\nout a flat oilskin case.  From this he extracted a folded and faded\nchart.\n\n\"I was coming up to see a gentleman in these buildings,\" he said, \"a\ngentleman named Tibbetts.\"\n\nBones opened his mouth to speak, but stopped himself.\n\n\"Me and Jim Curtis and young Harry, we were together in the _Serpent\nQueen_--my name's Dibbs.  That's where we got hold of the yarn about\nLomo Island, though we didn't believe there was anything in it.  But\nwhen this Dago died----\"\n\n\"Which Dago?\" asked Bones.\n\n\"The Dago that knew all about it,\" said Mr. Dibbs impatiently, \"and we\ncome to split up his kit in his mess-bag, I found this.\"  He shook the\noilskin case in Bones's face.  \"Well, the first thing I did, when I got\nto Sydney, was to desert, and I got a chap from Wellington to put up\nthe money to hire a boat to take me to Lomo.  We were wrecked on Lomo.\"\n\n\"So you got there?\" said Bones sympathetically.\n\n\"Six weeks I was on Lomo.  Ate nothing but crabs, drank nothing but\nrain-water.  But the stuff was there all right, only\"--he was very\nemphatic, was this simple old sea-dog--\"it wasn't under the third tree,\nbut the fourth tree.  I got down to the first of the boxes, and it was\nas much as I could do to lift it out.  I couldn't trust any of the\nKanaka boys who were with me.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Bones.  \"An' I'll bet they didn't trust you, the\nnaughty old Kanakas.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Mr. Dibbs, and he pulled out of his pocket a handful\nof gold coins which bore busts of a foreign-looking lady and gentleman.\n\"Spanish gold, that is,\" he said.  \"There was four thousand in the\nlittle box.  I filled both my pockets, and took 'em back to Sydney when\nwe were picked up.  I didn't dare try in Australia.  'That gold will\nkeep,' I says to myself.  'I'll get back to England and find a man who\nwill put up the money for an expedition'--a gentleman, you understand?\"\n\n\"I quite understand,\" said Bones, all a-quiver with excitement.\n\n\"And then I met Harry and Jim.  They said they'd got somebody who would\nput the money up, an American fellow, Rockefeller.  Have you ever heard\nof him?\"\n\n\"I've heard of him,\" said Bones; \"he's got a paraffin mine.\"\n\n\"It may be he has, it may be he hasn't,\" said Mr. Dibbs and rose.\n\"Well, sir, I'm very much obliged to you for your kindness.  If you'll\ndirect me to Mr. Tibbetts's office----\"\n\nIt was a dramatic moment.\n\n\"I am Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Bones simply.\n\nBlank incredulity was on the face of Mr. Dibbs.\n\n\"You?\" he said.  \"But I thought Mr. Tibbetts was an older gentleman?\"\n\n\"Dear old treasure-finder,\" said Bones, \"be assured I am Mr. Tibbetts.\nThis is my office, and this is my desk.  People think I am older\nbecause----\"  He smiled a little sadly, then: \"Sit down!\" he thundered.\n\"Let us go into this.\"\n\nHe went into the matter, and the City clocks were booming one when he\nled his mariner friend into the street.\n\nHe was late at the office the next morning, because he was young and\nhealthy and required nine hours of the deepest slumber that Morpheus\nkept in stock.\n\nThe grey-eyed girl was typing at a very respectable speed the notes\nBones had given her the evening before.  There was a telegram awaiting\nhim, which he read with satisfaction.  Then:\n\n\"Leave your work, my young typewriter,\" said Bones imperiously.  \"I\nhave a matter of the greatest importance to discuss with you!  See that\nall the doors are closed,\" he whispered; \"lock 'em if necessary.\"\n\n\"I hardly think that's necessary,\" said the girl.  \"You see, if anybody\ncame and found all the doors locked----\"\n\n\"Idiot!\" said Bones, very red.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said the startled girl.\n\n\"I was speaking to me,\" said Bones rapidly.  \"This is a matter of the\ngreatest confidence, my jolly old Marguerite \"--he paused, shaking at\nhis temerity, for it was only on the previous day that he had\ndiscovered her name--\"a matter which requires tact and discretion,\nyoung Marguerite----\"\n\n\"You needn't say it twice,\" she said.\n\n\"Well once,\" said Bones, brightening up.  \"That's a bargain--I'll call\nyou Marguerite once a day.  Now, dear old Marguerite, listen to this.\"\n\nShe listened with the greatest interest, jotting down the preliminary\nexpenses.  Purchase of steamer, five thousand pounds; provisioning of\nsame, three thousand pounds, etc., etc.  She even undertook to make a\ncopy of the plan which Mr. Dibbs had given into his charge, and which\nBones told her had not left him day nor night.\n\n\"I put it in my pyjama pocket when I went to bed,\" he explained\nunnecessarily, \"and----\"  He began to pat himself all over,\nconsternation in his face.\n\n\"And you left it in your pyjama pocket,\" said the girl quietly.  \"I'll\ntelephone to your house for it.\"\n\n\"Phew!\" said Bones.  \"It seems incredible.  I must have been robbed.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said the girl; \"it is probably under your pillow.\nDo you keep your pyjamas under your pillow?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Bones, \"is a matter which I never discuss in public.  I\nhate to disappoint you, dear old Marguerite----\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said the girl, with such a simulation of regret that Bones\ndissolved into a splutter of contrition.\n\nA commissionaire and a taxicab brought the plan, which was discovered\nwhere the girl in her wisdom had suggested.\n\n\"I'm not so sure how much money I'm going to make out of this,\" said\nBones off-handedly, after a thorough and searching examination of the\nproject.  \"It is certain to be about three thousand pounds--it may be a\nmillion or two million.  It'll be good for you, dear old stenographer.\"\n\nShe looked at him.\n\n\"I have decided,\" said Bones, playing with his paper-knife, \"to allow\nyou a commission of seven and a half per cent. on all profits.  Seven\nand a half per cent. on two million is, roughly, fifty thousand\npounds----\"\n\nShe laughed her refusal.\n\n\"I like to be fair,\" said Bones.\n\n\"You like to be generous,\" she corrected him, \"and because I am a girl,\nand pretty----\"\n\n\"Oh, I say,\" protested Bones feebly--\"oh, really you are not pretty at\nall.  I am not influenced by your perfectly horrible young face,\nbelieve me, dear old Miss Marguerite.  Now, I've a sense of fairness, a\nsense of justice----\"\n\n\"Now, listen to me, Mr. Tibbetts.\"  She swung her chair round to face\nhim squarely.  \"I've got to tell you a little story.\"\n\nBones listened to that story with compressed lips and folded arms.  He\nwas neither shocked nor amazed, and the girl was surprised.\n\n\"Hold hard, young miss,\" he said soberly.  \"If this is a jolly old\nswindle, and if the naughty mariner----\"\n\n\"His name is Webber, and he is an actor,\" she interrupted.\n\n\"And dooced well he acted,\" admitted Bones.  \"Well, if this is so, what\nabout the other johnny who's putting up ten thousand to my fifteen\nthousand?\"\n\nThis was a facer for the girl, and Bones glared his triumph.\n\n\"That is what the wicked old ship-sailer said.  Showed me the money,\nan' I sent him straight off on the job.  He said he'd got a Stock\nExchange person named Morris----\"\n\n\"Morris!\" gasped the girl.  \"That is my step-father!\"\n\nBones jumped up, a man inspired.\n\n\"The naughty old One, who married your sainted mother?\" he gurgled.\n\"My miss!  My young an' jolly old Marguerite!\"\n\nHe sat down at his desk, yanked open the drawer, and slapped down his\ncheque-book.\n\n\"Three thousand pounds,\" he babbled, writing rapidly.  \"You'd better\nkeep it for her, dear old friend of Faust.\"\n\n\"But I don't understand,\" she said, bewildered.\n\n\"Telegram,\" said Bones briefly.  \"Read it.\"\n\nShe picked up the buff form and read.  It was postmarked from Cowes,\nand ran:\n\n\n\"In accordance your telegraphed instructions, have sold your\nschooner-yacht to Mr. Dibbs, who paid cash.  Did not give name of\nowner.  Dibbs did not ask to see boat.  All he wanted was receipt for\nmoney.\"\n\n\n\"They are calling this afternoon for my fifteen thousand,\" said Bones,\ncackling light-headedly.  \"Ring up jolly old Scotland Yard, and ask 'em\nto send me all the police they've got in stock!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nBONES AND THE WHARFINGERS\n\nI\n\nThe kite wheeling invisible in the blue heavens, the vulture appearing\nmysteriously from nowhere in the track of the staggering buck, possess\nqualities which are shared by certain favoured human beings.  No\nnewspaper announced the fact that there had arrived in the City of\nLondon a young man tremendously wealthy and as tremendously\ninexperienced.\n\nThere were no meetings of organized robber gangs, where masked men laid\nnefarious plans and plots, but the instinct which called the kite to\nhis quarry and the carrion to the kill brought many strangers--who were\nequally strange to Bones and to one another--to the beautiful office\nwhich he had fitted for himself for the better furtherance of his\nbusiness.\n\nOne day a respectable man brought to Mr. Tibbetts a plan of a\nwarehouse.  He came like a gale of wind, almost before Bones had\ndigested the name on the card which announced his existence and\nidentity.\n\nHis visitor was red-faced and big, and had need to use a handkerchief\nto mop his brow and neck at intervals of every few minutes.  His\ngeniality was overpowering.\n\nBefore the startled Bones could ask his business, he had put his hat\nupon one chair, hooked his umbrella on another, and was unrolling, with\nthat professional tremblement of hand peculiar to all who unroll large\nstiff sheets of paper, a large coloured plan, a greater portion of\nwhich was taken up by the River Thames, as Bones saw at a glance.\n\nHe knew that blue stood for water, and, twisting his neck, he read\n\"Thames.\"  He therefore gathered that this was the plan of a property\nadjacent to the London river.\n\n\"You're a busy man; and I'm a busy man,\" said the stentorian man\nbreathlessly.  \"I've just bought this property, and if it doesn't\ninterest you I'll eat my hat!  My motto is small profits and quick\nreturns.  Keep your money at work, and you won't have to.  Do you see\nwhat I mean?\"\n\n\"Dear old hurricane,\" said Bones feebly, \"this is awfully interesting,\nand all that sort of thing, but would you be so kind as to explain why\nand where--why you came in in this perfectly informal manner?  Against\nall the rules of my office, dear old thing, if you don't mind me\nsnubbing you a bit.  You are sure you aren't hurt?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not a bit, not a bit!\" bellowed the intruder.  \"Honest John, I\nam--John Staines.  You have heard of me?\"\n\n\"I have,\" said Bones, and the visitor was so surprised that he showed\nit.\n\n\"You have?\" he said, not without a hint of incredulity.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bones calmly.  \"Yes, I have just heard you say it, Honest\nJohn Staines.  Any relation to John o' Gaunt?\"\n\nThis made the visitor look up sharply.\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" he said, his laugh lacking sincerity.  \"You're a bit of a\njoker, Mr. Tibbetts.  Now, what do you say to this?  This is Stivvins'\nWharf and Warehouse.  Came into the market on Saturday, and I bought it\non Saturday.  The only river frontage which is vacant between Greenwich\nand Gravesend.  Stivvins, precious metal refiner, went broke in the\nWar, as you may have heard.  Now, I am a man of few words and\nadmittedly a speculator.  I bought this property for fifteen thousand\npounds.  Show me a profit of five thousand pounds and it's yours.\"\n\nBefore Bones could speak, he stopped him with a gesture.\n\n\"Let me tell you this: if you like to sit on that property for a month,\nyou'll make a sheer profit of twenty thousand pounds.  You can afford\nto do it--I can't.  I tell you there isn't a vacant wharfage between\nGreenwich and Gravesend, and here you have a warehouse with thirty\nthousand feet of floor-space, derricks--derrick, named after the\nhangman of that name: I'll bet you didn't know that?--cranes,\neverything in----  Well, it's not in apple-pie order,\" he admitted,\n\"but it won't take much to make it so.  What do you say?\"\n\nBones started violently.\n\n\"Excuse me, old speaker, I was thinking of something else.  Do you mind\nsaying that all over again?\"\n\nHonest John Staines swallowed something and repeated his proposition.\n\nBones shook his head violently.\n\n\"Nothing doing!\" he said.  \"Wharves and ships--_no!_\"\n\nBut Honest John was not the kind that accepts refusal without protest.\n\n\"What I'll do,\" said he confidentially, \"is this: I'll leave the matter\nfor twenty-four hours in your hands.\"\n\n\"No, go, my reliable old wharf-seller,\" said Bones.  \"I never go up the\nriver under any possible circumstances----  By Jove, I've got an idea!\"\n\nHe brought his knuckly fist down upon the unoffending desk, and Honest\nJohn watched hopefully.\n\n\"Now, if--yes, it's an idea!\"\n\nBones seized paper, and his long-feathered quill squeaked violently.\n\n\"That's it--a thousand members at ten pounds a year, four hundred\nbedrooms at, say, ten shillings a night----  How many is four hundred\ntimes ten shillings multiplied by three hundred and sixty-five?  Well,\nlet's say twenty thousand pounds.  That's it!  A club!\"\n\n\"A club?\" said Honest John blankly.\n\n\"A river club.  You said Greenhithe--that's somewhere near Henley,\nisn't it?\"\n\nHonest John sighed.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he said gently, \"it's in the other direction--toward the\nsea.\"\n\nBones dropped his pen and pinched his lip in an effort of memory.\n\n\"Is it?  Now, where was I thinking about?  I know--Maidenhead!  Is it\nnear Maidenhead?\"\n\n\"It's in the opposite direction from London,\" said the perspiring Mr.\nStaines.\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\nBones's interest evaporated.\n\n\"No good to me, my old speculator.  Wharves!  Bah!\"\n\nHe shook his head violently, and Mr. Staines aroused himself.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said simply; \"I'll leave\nthe plans with you.  I'm going down into the country for a night.\nThink it over.  I'll call to-morrow afternoon.\"\n\nBones still shook his head.\n\n\"No go, nothin' doin'.  Finish this palaver, dear old Honesty!\"\n\n\"Anyway, no harm is done,\" urged Mr. Staines.  \"I ask you, is there any\nharm done?  You have the option for twenty-four hours.  I'll roll the\nplans up so that they won't be in the way.  Good morning!\"\n\nHe was out of the office door before Bones could as much as deliver the\npreamble to the stern refusal he was preparing.\n\nAt three o'clock that afternoon came two visitors.  They sent in a card\nbearing the name of a very important Woking firm of land agents, and\nthey themselves were not without dignity of bearing.\n\nThere was a stout gentleman and a thin gentleman, and they tiptoed into\nthe presence of Bones with a hint of reverence which was not\ndispleasing.\n\n\"We have come on a rather important matter,\" said the thin gentleman.\n\"We understand you have this day purchased Stivvins' Wharf----\"\n\n\"Staines had no right to sell it?\" burst in the stout man explosively.\n\"A dirty mean trick, after all that he promised us!  It is just his way\nof getting revenge, selling the property to a stranger!\"\n\n\"Mr. Sole\"--the thin gentleman's voice and attitude were eloquent of\nreproof--\"_please_ restrain yourself!  My partner is annoyed,\" he\nexplained \"and not without reason.  We offered fifty thousand pounds\nfor Stivvins', and Staines, in sheer malice, has sold the\nproperty--which is virtually necessary to our client--literally behind\nour backs.  Now, Mr. Tibbetts, are you prepared to make a little profit\nand transfer the property to us?\"\n\n\"But----\" began Bones.\n\n\"We will give you sixty thousand,\" said the explosive man.  \"Take it or\nleave it--sixty thousand.\"\n\n\"But, my dear old Boniface,\" protested Bones, \"I haven't bought the\nproperty--really and truly I haven't.  Jolly old Staines wanted me to\nbuy it, but I assure you I didn't.\"\n\nThe stout man looked at him with glazed eyes, pulled himself together,\nand suggested huskily:\n\n\"Perhaps you will buy it--at his price--and transfer it to us?\"\n\n\"But why?  Nothing to do with me, my old estate agent and auctioneer.\nBuy it yourself.  Good afternoon.  _Good_ afternoon!\"\n\nHe ushered them out in a cloud of genial commonplaces.\n\nIn the street they looked at one another, and then beckoned Mr.\nStaines, who was waiting on the other side of the road.\n\n\"This fellow is either as wide as Broad Street or he's a babe in arms,\"\nsaid the explosive man huskily.\n\n\"Didn't he fall?\" asked the anxious Staines.\n\n\"Not noticeably,\" said the thin man.  \"This is your scheme, Jack, and\nif I've dropped four thousand over that wharf, there's going to be\ntrouble.\"\n\nMr. Staines looked very serious.\n\n\"Give him the day,\" he begged.  \"I'll try him to-morrow--I haven't lost\nfaith in that lad.\"\n\nAs for Bones, he made an entry in his secret ledger.\n\n\"A person called Stains and two perrsons called Sole Bros.  Brothers\ntryed me with the old Fiddle Trick.  You take a Fiddel in a Pawn\nBrokers leave it with him along comes another Felow and pretends its a\nStadivarious Stradivarious a valuable Fiddel.  2nd Felow offers to pay\nfablous sum pawnbroker says I'll see.  When 1st felow comes for his\nfiddel pawnbroker buys it at fablous sum to sell it to the 2nd felow.\nBut 2nd felow doesn't turn up.\n\n\"_Note_.--1st Felow called himself Honest John!!  I dout if I dought\nit.\"\n\nBones finished his entries, locked away his ledger, and crossed the\nfloor to the door of the outer office.\n\nHe knocked respectfully, and a voice bade him come in.\n\nIt is not usual for the principal of a business to knock respectfully\nor otherwise on the door of the outer office, but then it is not usual\nfor an outer office to house a secretary of such transcendental\nqualities, virtue, and beauty as were contained in the person of Miss\nMarguerite Whitland.\n\nThe girl half turned to the door and flashed a smile which was of\nwelcome and reproof.\n\n\"Please, Mr. Tibbetts,\" she pleaded, \"do not knock at my door.  Don't\nyou realize that it isn't done?\"\n\n\"Dear old Marguerite,\" said Bones solemnly, \"a new era has dawned in\nthe City.  As jolly old Confusicus says: 'The moving finger writes, and\nthat's all about it.'  Will you deign to honour me with your presence\nin my sanctorum, and may I again beg of you\"--he leant his bony\nknuckles on the ornate desk which he had provided for her, and looked\ndown upon her soberly--\"may I again ask you, dear old miss, to let me\nchange offices?  It's a little thing, dear old miss.  I'm never, never\ngoin' to ask you to dinner again, but this is another matter.  I am out\nof my element in such a place as----\"  He waved his hand disparagingly\ntowards his sanctum.  \"I'm a rough old adventurer, used to sleeping in\nthe snow--hardships--I can sleep anywhere.\"\n\n\"Anyway, you're not supposed to sleep in the office,\" smiled the girl,\nrising.\n\nBones pushed open the door for her, bowed as she passed, and followed\nher.  He drew a chair up to the desk, and she sat down without further\nprotest, because she had come to know that his attentions, his\nextravagant politeness and violent courtesies, signified no more than\nwas apparent--namely, that he was a great cavalier at heart.\n\n\"I think you ought to know,\" he said gravely, \"that an attempt was made\nthis morning to rob me of umpteen pounds.\"\n\n\"To rob you?\" said the startled girl.\n\n\"To rob me,\" said Bones, with relish.  \"A dastardly plot, happily\nfrustrated by the ingenuity of the intended victim.  I don't want to\nboast, dear old miss.  Nothing is farther from my thoughts or wishes,\nbut what's more natural when a fellow is offered a----\"\n\nHe stopped and frowned.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"A precious metal refiner's----  That's rum,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Rum?\" repeated the girl hazily.  \"What is rum?\"\n\n\"Of all the rummy old coincidences,\" said Bones, with restrained and\nhollow enthusiasm--\"why, only this morning I was reading in _Twiddly\nBits_, a ripping little paper, dear old miss----  There's a column\ncalled 'Things You Ought to Know,' which is honestly worth the\ntwopence.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said the girl curiously.  \"But what did you read?\"\n\n\"It was an article called 'Fortunes Made in Old Iron,'\" said Bones.\n\"Now, suppose this naughty old refiner----  By Jove, it's an idea!\"\n\nHe paced the room energetically, changing the aspect of his face with\ngreat rapidity, as wandering thoughts crowded in upon him and vast\npossibilities shook their alluring banners upon the pleasant scene he\nconjured.  Suddenly he pulled himself together, shot out his cuffs,\nopened and closed all the drawers of his desk as though seeking\nsomething--he found it where he had left it, hanging on a peg behind\nthe door, and put it on--and said with great determination and\nbriskness:\n\n\"Stivvins' Wharf, Greenhithe.  You will accompany me.  Bring your\nnote-book.  It is not necessary to bring a typewriter.  I will arrange\nfor a taxicab.  We can do the journey in two hours.\"\n\n\"But where are you going?\" asked the startled girl.\n\n\"To Stivvins'.  I am going to look at this place.  There is a\npossibility that certain things have been overlooked.  Never lose an\nopportunity, dear old miss.  We magnates make our fortune by never\nignoring the little things.\"\n\nBut still she demurred, being a very sane, intelligent girl, with an\nimagination which produced no more alluring mental picture than a cold\nand draughty drive, a colder and draughtier and even more depressing\ninspection of a ruined factory, and such small matters as a lost lunch.\n\nBut Bones was out of the room, in the street, had flung himself upon a\nhesitant taxi-driver, had bullied and cajoled him to take a monstrous\nand undreamt-of journey for a man who, by his own admission, had only\nsufficient petrol to get his taxi home, and when the girl came down she\nfound Bones, with his arm entwined through the open window of the door,\ngiving explicit instructions as to the point on the river where\nStivvins' Wharf was to be found.\n\n\nII\n\nBones returned to his office alone.  The hour was six-thirty, and he\nwas a very quiet and thoughtful young man.  He almost tiptoed into his\noffice, closed and locked the door behind him, and sat at his desk with\nhis head in his hands for the greater part of half an hour.\n\nThen he unrolled the plan of the wharf, hoping that his memory had not\nplayed him false.  Happily it had not.  On the bottom right-hand corner\nMr. Staines had written his address! \"Stamford Hotel, Blackfriars.\"\n\nBones pulled a telegraph form from his stationery rack and indited an\nurgent wire.\n\nMr. Staines, at the moment of receiving that telegram, was sitting at a\nsmall round table in the bar of The Stamford, listening in silence to\ncertain opinions which were being expressed by his two companions in\narms and partners in misfortune, the same opinions relating in a most\ndisparaging manner to the genius, the foresight, and the constructive\nability of one who in his exuberant moments described himself as Honest\nJohn.\n\nThe explosive gentleman had just concluded a fanciful picture of what\nwould happen to Honest John if he came into competition with the\naverage Bermondsey child of tender years.\n\nHonest John took the telegram and opened it.  He read it and gasped.\nHe stood up and walked to the light, and read it again, then returned,\nhis eyes shining, his face slightly flushed.\n\n\"You're clever, ain't you?\" he asked.  \"You're wise--I don't think!\nLook at this!\"\n\nHe handed the telegram to the nearest of his companions, who was the\ntall, thin, and non-explosive partner, and he in turn passed it without\na word to his more choleric companion.\n\n\"You don't mean to say he's going to buy it?\"\n\n\"That's what it says, doesn't it?\" said the triumphant Mr. Staines.\n\n\"It's a catch,\" said the explosive man suspiciously.\n\n\"Not on your life,\" replied the scornful Staines.  \"Where does the\ncatch come in?  We've done nothing he could catch us for?\"\n\n\"Let's have a look at that telegram again,\" said the thin man, and,\nhaving read it in a dazed way, remarked: \"He'll wait for you at the\noffice until nine.  Well, Jack, nip up and fix that deal.  Take the\ntransfers with you.  Close it and take his cheque.  Take anything he'll\ngive you, and get a special clearance in the morning, and, anyway, the\nbusiness is straight.\"\n\nHonest John breathed heavily through his nose and staggered from the\nbar, and the suspicious glances of the barman were, for once,\nunjustified, for Mr. Staines was labouring under acute emotions.\n\nHe found Bones sitting at his desk, a very silent, taciturn Bones, who\ngreeted him with a nod.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Bones.  \"I'll take that property.  Here's my cheque.\"\n\nWith trembling fingers Mr. Staines prepared the transfers.  It was he\nwho scoured the office corridors to discover two agitated char-ladies\nwho were prepared to witness his signature for a consideration.\n\nHe folded the cheque for twenty thousand pounds reverently and put it\ninto his pocket, and was back again at the Stamford Hotel so quickly\nthat his companions could not believe their eyes.\n\n\"Well, this is the rummiest go I have ever known,\" said the explosive\nman profoundly.  \"You don't think he expects us to call in the morning\nand buy it back, do you?\"\n\nStaines shook his head.\n\n\"I know he doesn't,\" he said grimly.  \"In fact, he as good as told me\nthat that business of buying a property back was a fake.\"\n\nThe thin man whistled.\n\n\"The devil he did!  Then what made him buy it?\"\n\n\"He's been there.  He mentioned he had seen the property,\" said\nStaines.  And then, as an idea occurred to them all simultaneously,\nthey looked at one another.\n\nThe stout Mr. Sole pulled a big watch from his pocket.\n\n\"There's a caretaker at Stivvins', isn't there?\" he said.  \"Let's go\ndown and see what has happened.\"\n\nStivvins' Wharf was difficult of approach by night.  It lay off the\nmain Woolwich Road, at the back of another block of factories, and to\nreach its dilapidated entrance gates involved an adventurous march\nthrough a number of miniature shell craters.  Night, however, was\nmerciful in that it hid the desolation which is called Stivvins' from\nthe fastidious eye of man.  Mr. Sole, who was not aesthetic and by no\nmeans poetical, admitted that Stivvins' gave him the hump.\n\nIt was ten o'clock by the time they had reached the wharf, and\nhalf-past ten before their hammering on the gate aroused the attention\nof the night-watchman--who was also the day-watchman--who occupied what\nhad been in former days the weigh-house, which he had converted into a\nweatherproof lodging.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he said huskily.  \"I was asleep.\"\n\nHe recognized Mr. Sole, and led the way to his little bunk-house.\n\n\"Look here, Tester,\" said Sole, who had appointed the man, \"did a young\nswell come down here to-day?\"\n\n\"He did,\" said Mr. Tester, \"and a young lady.  They gave Mr. Staines's\nname, and asked to be showed round, and,\" he added, \"I showed 'em\nround.\"\n\n\"Well, what happened?\" asked Staines.\n\n\"Well,\" said the man, \"I took 'em in the factory, in the big building,\nand then this young fellow asked to see the place where the metal was\nkept.\"\n\n\"What metal?\" asked three voices at one and the same time.\n\n\"That's what I asked,\" said Mr. Tester, with satisfaction.  \"I told 'em\nStivvins dealt with all kinds of metal, so the gent says: 'What about\ngold?'\"\n\n\"What about gold?\" repeated Mr. Staines thoughtfully.  \"And what did\nyou say?\"\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact,\" explained Tester, \"I happen to know this\nplace, living in the neighbourhood, and I used to work here about eight\nyears ago, so I took 'em down to the vault.\"\n\n\"To the vault?\" said Mr. Staines.  \"I didn't know there was a vault.\"\n\n\"It's under the main office.  You must have seen the place,\" said\nTester.  \"There's a big steel door with a key in it--at least, there\nwas a key in it, but this young fellow took it away with him.\"\n\nStaines gripped his nearest companion in sin, and demanded huskily:\n\n\"Did they find anything in--in the vault?\"\n\n\"Blessed if I know!\" said the cheerful Tester, never dreaming that he\nwas falling very short of the faith which at that moment, and only at\nthat moment, had been reposed in him.  \"They just went in.  I've never\nbeen inside the place myself.\"\n\n\"And you stood outside, like a--a----\"\n\n\"Blinking image!\" said the explosive companion.\n\n\"You stood outside like a blinking image, and didn't attempt to go in,\nand see what they were looking at?\" said Mr. Staines heatedly.  \"How\nlong were they there?\"\n\n\"About ten minutes.\"\n\n\"And then they came out?\"\n\nTester nodded.\n\n\"Did they bring anything out with them?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Mr. Tester emphatically.\n\n\"Did this fellow--what's his name?--look surprised or upset?\" persisted\nthe cross-examining Honest John.\n\n\"He was a bit upset, now you come to mention it, agitated like, yes,\"\nsaid Tester, reviewing the circumstances in a new light.  \"His 'and\nwas, so to speak, shaking.\"\n\n\"Merciful Moses!\"  This pious ejaculation was from Mr. Staines.  \"He\ntook away the key, you say.  And what are you supposed to be here for?\"\nasked Mr. Staines violently.  \"You allow this fellow to come and take\nour property away.  Where is the place?\"\n\nTester led the way across the littered yard, explaining en route that\nhe was fed up, and why he was fed up, and what they could do to fill\nthe vacancy which would undoubtedly occur the next day, and where they\ncould go to, so far as he was concerned, and so, unlocking one rusty\nlock after another, passed through dark and desolate offices, full of\nsqueaks and scampers, down a short flight of stone steps to a most\nuncompromising steel door at which they could only gaze.\n\n\nIII\n\nBones was at his office early the following rooming, but he was not\nearlier than Mr. Staines, who literally followed him into his office\nand slammed down a slip of paper under his astonished and gloomy eye.\n\n\"Hey, hey, what's this?\" said Bones irritably.  \"What the dooce is\nthis, my wicked old fiddle fellow?\"\n\n\"Your cheque,\" said Mr. Staines firmly.  \"And I'll trouble you for the\nkey of our strong-room.\"\n\n\"The key of your strong-room?\" repeated Bones.  \"Didn't I buy this\nproperty?\"\n\n\"You did and you didn't.  To cut a long story short, Mr. Tibbetts, I\nhave decided not to sell--in fact, I find that I have done an illegal\nthing in selling at all.\"\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders.  Remember that he had slept, or\nhalf-slept, for some nine hours, and possibly his views had undergone a\nchange.  What he would have done is problematical, because at that\nmoment the radiant Miss Whitland passed into her office, and Bones's\nacute ear heard the snap of her door.\n\n\"One moment,\" he said gruffly, \"one moment, old Honesty.\"\n\nHe strode through the door which separated the private from the public\nportion of his suite, and Mr. Staines listened.  He listened at varying\ndistances from the door, and in his last position it would have\nrequired the most delicate of scientific instruments to measure the\ndistance between his ear and the keyhole.  He heard nothing save the\nwail of a Bones distraught, and the firm \"No's\" of a self-possessed\nfemale.\n\nThen, after a heart-breaking silence Bones strode out, and Mr. Staines\ndid a rapid sprint, so that he might be found standing in an attitude\nof indifference and thought near the desk.  The lips of Bones were\ntight and compressed.  He opened the drawer, pulled out the transfers,\ntossed them across to Mr. Staines.\n\n\"Key,\" said Bones, chucking it down after the document.\n\nHe picked up his cheque and tore it into twenty pieces.\n\n\"That's all,\" said Bones, and Mr. Staines beat a tremulous retreat.\n\nWhen the man had gone, Bones returned to the girl who was sitting at\nher table before her typewriter.  It was observable that her lips were\ncompressed too.\n\n\"Young Miss Whitland,\" said Bones, and his voice was hoarser than ever,\n\"never, never in my life will I ever forgive myself!\"\n\n\"Oh, please, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said the girl a little wearily, \"haven't I\ntold you that I have forgiven you?  And I am sure you had no horrid\nthought in your mind, and that you just acted impulsively.\"\n\nBones bowed his head, at once a sign of agreement and a crushed spirit.\n\n\"The fact remains, dear old miss,\" he said brokenly, \"that I did kiss\nyou in that beastly old private vault.  I don't know what made me do\nit,\" he gulped, \"but I did it.  Believe me, young miss, that spot was\nsacred.  I wanted to buy the building to preserve it for all time, so\nthat no naughty old foot should tread upon that hallowed ground.  You\nthink that's nonsense!\"\n\n\"Mr. Tibbetts.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, I say, romantic and all that sort of rot.\"  Bones threw out\nhis arms.  \"I must agree with you.  But, believe me, Stivvins' Wharf is\nhallowed ground, and I deeply regret that you would not let me buy it\nand turn it over to the jolly old Public Trustee or one of those\njohnnies....  You do forgive me?\"\n\nShe laughed up in his face, and then Bones laughed, and they laughed\ntogether.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE PLOVER LIGHT CAR\n\nThe door of the private office opened and after a moment closed.  It\nwas, in fact, the private door of the private office, reserved\nexclusively for the use of the Managing Director of Schemes Limited.\nNevertheless, a certain person had been granted the privilege of\ningress and egress through that sacred portal, and Mr. Tibbetts, yclept\nBones, crouching over his desk, the ferocity of his countenance\nintensified by the monocle which was screwed into his eye, and the\nterrific importance of his correspondence revealed by his disordered\nhair and the red tongue that followed the movements of his pen, did not\nlook up.\n\n\"Put it down, put it down, young miss,\" he murmured, \"on the table, on\nthe floor, anywhere.\"\n\nThere was no answer, and suddenly Bones paused and scowled at the\nhalf-written sheet before him.\n\n\"That doesn't look right.\"  He shook his head.  \"I don't know what's\ncoming over me.  Do you spell 'cynical' with one 'k' or two?\"\n\nBones looked up.\n\nHe saw a brown-faced man, with laughing grey eyes, a tall man in a long\novercoat, carrying a grey silk hat in his hand.\n\n\"Pardon me, my jolly old intruder,\" said Bones with dignity, \"this is a\nprivate----\"  Then his jaw dropped and he leant on the desk for\nsupport.  \"Not my----  Good heavens!\" he squeaked, and then leapt\nacross the room, carrying with him the flex of his table lamp, which\nfell crashing to the floor.\n\n\"Ham, you poisonous old reptile!\"  He seized the other's hand in his\nbony paw, prancing up and down, muttering incoherently.\n\n\"Sit down, my jolly old Captain.  Let me take your overcoat.  Well!\nWell!  Well!  Give me your hat, dear old thing--dear old Captain, I\nmean.  This is simply wonderful!  This is one of the most amazin'\nexperiences I've ever had, my dear old sportsman and officer.  How long\nhave you been home?  How did you leave the Territory?  Good heavens!\nWe must have a bottle on this!\"\n\n\"Sit down, you noisy devil,\" said Hamilton, pushing his erstwhile\nsubordinate into a chair, and pulling up another to face him.\n\n\"So this is your boudoir!\"  He glanced round admiringly.  \"It looks\nrather like the waiting-room of a _couturi\u00e8re_.\"\n\n\"My dear old thing,\" said the shocked Bones, \"I beg you, if you please,\nremember, remember----\"  He lowered his voice, and the last word was in\na hoarse whisper, accompanied by many winks, nods, and pointings at and\nto a door which led from the inner office apparently to the outer.\n\"There's a person, dear old man of the world--a young person--well\nbrought up----\"\n\n\"What the----\" began Hamilton.\n\n\"Don't be peeved!\"  Bones's knowledge of French was of the haziest.\n\"Remember, dear old thing,\" he said solemnly, wagging his inky\nforefinger, \"as an employer of labour, I must protect the young an'\ninnocent, my jolly old skipper.\"\n\nHamilton looked round for a missile, and could find nothing better than\na crystal paper-weight, which looked too valuable to risk.\n\n\"'_Couturi\u00e8re_,'\" he said acidly, \"is French for 'dressmaker.'\"\n\n\"French,\" said Bones, \"is a language which I have always carefully\navoided.  I will say no more--you mean well, Ham.\"\n\nThereafter followed a volley of inquiries, punctuated at intervals by\ngenial ceremony, for Bones would rise from his chair, walk solemnly\nround the desk, and as solemnly shake hands with his former superior.\n\n\"Now, Bones,\" said Hamilton at last, \"will you tell me what you are\ndoing?\"\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Business,\" he said briefly.  \"A deal now and again, dear old officer.\nMake a thousand or so one week, lose a hundred or so the next.\"\n\n\"But what are you doing?\" persisted Hamilton.\n\nAgain Bones shrugged, but with more emphasis.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he confessed, with a show of self-deprecation which his\nsmugness belied, \"I suppose I am one of those jolly old spiders who sit\nin the centre of my web, or one of those perfectly dinky little tigers\nwho sit in my jolly old lair, waiting for victims.\n\n\"Of course, it's cruel sport\"--he shrugged again, toying with his ivory\npaper-knife--\"but one must live.  In the City one preys upon other\nones.\"\n\n\"Do the other ones do any preying at all?\" asked Hamilton.\n\nUp went Bones's eyebrows.\n\n\"They try,\" he said tersely, and with compressed lips.  \"Last week a\nfellow tried to sell me his gramophone, but I had a look at it.  As I\nsuspected, it had no needle.  A gramophone without a needle,\" said\nBones, \"as you probably know, my dear old musical one, is wholly\nuseless.\"\n\n\"But you can buy them at a bob a box,\" said Hamilton.\n\nBones's face fell.\n\n\"Can you really?\" he demanded.  \"You are not pulling my leg, or\nanything?  That's what the other fellow said.  I do a little gambling,\"\nBones went on, \"not on the Stock Exchange or on the race-course, you\nunderstand, but in Exchanges.\"\n\n\"Money Exchanges?\"\n\nBones bowed his head.\n\n\"For example,\" he said, \"to-day a pound is worth thirty-two francs,\nto-morrow it is worth thirty-four francs.  To-day a pound is worth four\ndollars seventy-seven----\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, it is three dollars ninety-seven,\" interrupted\nHamilton.\n\n\"Ninety-seven or seventy-seven,\" said Bones irritably, \"what is four\nshillings to men like you or me, Hamilton?  We can well afford it.\"\n\n\"My dear chap,\" said Hamilton, pardonably annoyed, \"there is a\ndifference of four shillings between your estimate and the rate.\"\n\n\"What is four shillings to you or me?\" asked Bones again, shaking his\nhead solemnly.  \"My dear old Ham, don't be mean.\"\n\nThere was a discreet tap on the door, and Bones rose with every\nevidence of agitation.\n\n\"Don't stir, dear old thing,\" he pleaded in a husky whisper.  \"Pretend\nnot to notice, dear old Ham.  Don't be nervous--wonderful young\nlady----\"\n\nThen, clearing his throat noisily, \"Come in!\" he roared in the tone\nthat a hungry lion might have applied to one of the early Christian\nmartyrs who was knocking by mistake on the door of his den.\n\nIn spite of all injunctions, Hamilton did look, and he did stare, and\nhe did take a great deal of notice, for the girl who came in was well\nworth looking at.  He judged her to be about the age of twenty-one.\n\"Pretty\" would be too feeble a word to employ in describing her.  The\nrusset-brown hair, dressed low over her forehead, emphasized the\nloveliness of eyes set wide apart and holding in their clear depths all\nthe magic and mystery of womanhood.\n\nShe was dressed neatly.  He observed, too, that she had an open book\nunder her arm and a pencil in her hand, and it dawned upon him slowly\nthat this radiant creature was--Bones's secretary!\n\nBones's secretary!\n\nHe stared at Bones, and that young man, very red in the face, avoided\nhis eye.\n\nBones was standing by the desk, in the attitude of an after-dinner\nspeaker who was stuck for the right word.  In moments of extreme\nagitation Bones's voice became either a growl or a squeak--the bottom\nregister was now in exercise.\n\n\"Did--did you want me, young miss?\" he demanded gruffly.\n\nThe girl at the door hesitated.\n\n\"I'm sorry--I didn't know you were engaged.  I wanted to see you about\nthe Abyssinian----\"\n\n\"Come in, come in, certainly,\" said Bones more gruffly than ever.  \"A\nnew complication, young miss?\"\n\nShe laid a paper on the desk, taking no more notice of Hamilton than if\nhe were an ornament on the chimney-piece.\n\n\"The first instalment of the purchase price is due to-day,\" she said.\n\n\"Is it?\" said Bones, with his extravagant surprise.  \"Are you certain,\nyoung miss?  This day of all days--and it's a Thursday, too,\" he added\nunnecessarily.\n\nThe girl smiled and curled her lip, but only for a second.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Bones, \"it's a matter of serious importance.  The\ncheque, jolly old young miss, we will sign it and you will send it off.\nMake it out for the full amount----\"\n\n\"For the three thousand pounds?\" said the girl.\n\n\"For the three thousand pounds,\" repeated Bones soberly.  He put in his\nmonocle and glared at her.  \"For the three thousand pounds,\" he\nrepeated.\n\nShe stood waiting, and Bones stood waiting, he in some embarrassment as\nto the method by which the interview might be terminated and his\nsecretary dismissed without any wound to her feelings.\n\n\"Don't you think to-morrow would do for the cheque?\" she asked.\n\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" said Bones.  \"Why not?  To-morrow's Friday,\nain't it?\"\n\nShe inclined her head and walked out of the room, and Bones cleared his\nthroat once more.\n\n\"Bones----\"\n\nThe young man turned to meet Hamilton's accusing eye.\n\n\"Bones,\" said Hamilton gently, \"who is the lady?\"\n\n\"Who is the lady?\" repeated Bones, with a cough.  \"The lady is my\nsecretary, dear old inquisitor.\"\n\n\"So I gather,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"She is my secretary,\" repeated Bones.  \"An extremely sensible young\nwoman, extremely sensible.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" said Hamilton.  \"Plenty of people are sensible.  When\nyou talk about sensible young women, you mean plain young women.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Bones; \"I never thought of that.  What a naughty\nold mind you have, Ham.\"\n\nHe seemed inclined to change the subject.\n\n\"And now, dear old son,\" said Bones, with a brisk return to his\nwhat-can-I-do-for-you air, \"to business!  You've come, dear old thing,\nto consult me.\"\n\n\"You're surprisingly right,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Well,\" said Bones, trying three drawers of his desk before he could\nfind one that opened, \"have a cigar, and let us talk.\"\n\nHamilton took the proffered weed and eyed it suspiciously.\n\n\"Is this one that was given to you, or one that you bought?\" he\ndemanded.\n\n\"That, my jolly old officer,\" said Bones, \"is part of a job lot that I\nbought pretty cheap.  I've got a rare nose for a bargain----\"\n\n\"Have you a rare nose for a cigar, that's the point?\" asked Hamilton,\nas he cut off the end and lit it gingerly.\n\n\"Would I give you a bad cigar?\" asked the indignant Bones.  \"A gallant\nold returned warrior, comrade of my youth, and all that sort of thing!\nMy dear old Ham!\"\n\n\"I'll tell you in a minute,\" said Hamilton, and took two draws.\n\nBones, who was no cigar smoker, watched the proceedings anxiously.\nHamilton put the cigar down very gently on the corner of the desk.\n\n\"Do you mind if I finish this when nobody's looking?\" he asked.\n\n\"Isn't it all right?\" asked Bones.  \"Gracious heavens!  I paid fifty\nshillings a hundred for those!  Don't say I've been done.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you could be done at that price,\" said Hamilton, and\nbrushed the cigar gently into the fireplace.  \"Yes, I have come to\nconsult you, Bones,\" he went on.  \"Do you remember some eight months\nago I wrote to you telling you that I had been offered shares in a\nmotor-car company?\"\n\nBones had a dim recollection that something of the sort had occurred,\nand nodded gravely.\n\n\"It seemed a pretty good offer to me,\" said Hamilton reflectively.\n\"You remember I told you there was a managership attached to the\nholding of the shares?\"\n\nBones shifted uneasily in his chair, sensing a reproach.\n\n\"My dear old fellow----\" he began feebly.\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" said Hamilton.  \"I wrote to you and asked you your\nadvice.  You wrote back, telling me to have nothing whatever to do with\nthe Plover Light Car Company.\"\n\n\"Did I?\" said Bones.  \"Well, my impression was that I advised you to\nget into it as quickly as you possibly could.  Have you my letter, dear\nold thing?\"\n\n\"I haven't,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Bones triumphantly, \"there you are!  You jolly old rascal,\nyou are accusing me of putting you off----\"\n\n\"Will you wait, you talkative devil?\" said Hamilton.  \"I pointed out to\nyou that the prospects were very alluring.  The Company was floated\nwith a small capital----\"\n\nAgain Bones interrupted, and this time by rising and walking solemnly\nround the table to shake hands with him.\n\n\"Hamilton, dear old skipper,\" he pleaded.  \"I was a very busy man at\nthat time.  I admit I made a mistake, and possibly diddled you out of a\nfortune.  But my intention was to write to you and tell you to get into\nit, and how I ever came to tell you _not_ to get into it--well, my poor\nold speculator, I haven't the slightest idea!\"\n\n\"The Company----\" began Hamilton.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said Bones, shaking his head sadly and fixing his\nmonocle--a proceeding rendered all the more difficult by the fact that\nhis hand never quite overtook his face.  \"It was an error on my part,\ndear old thing.  I know the Company well.  Makes a huge profit!  You\ncan see the car all over the town.  I think the jolly old Partridge----\"\n\n\"Plover,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Plover, I mean.  They've got another kind of car called the\nPartridge,\" explained Bones.  \"Why, it's one of the best in the market.\nI thought of buying one myself.  And to think that I put you off that\nCompany!  Tut, tut!  Anyway, dear old man,\" he said, brightening up,\n\"most of the good fish is in the sea, and it only goes bad when it\ncomes out of the sea.  Have you ever noticed that, my dear old\nnaturalist?\"\n\n\"Wait a moment.  Will you be quiet?\" said the weary Hamilton.  \"I'm\ntrying to tell you my experiences.  I put the money--four thousand\npounds--into this infernal Company.\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"I put the money into the Company, I tell you, against your advice.\nThe Company is more or less a swindle.\"\n\nBones sat down slowly in his chair and assumed his most solemn and\nbusiness-like face.\n\n\"Of course, it keeps within the law, but it's a swindle, none the less.\nThey've got a wretched broken-down factory somewhere in the North, and\nthe only Plover car that's ever been built was made by a Scottish\ncontractor at a cost of about twice the amount which the Company people\nsaid that they would charge for it.\"\n\n\"What did I say?\" said Bones quietly.  \"Poor old soul, I do not give\nadvice without considering matters, especially to my dearest friend.  A\ncompany like this is obviously a swindle.  You can tell by the\nappearance of the cars----\"\n\n\"There was only one car ever made,\" interrupted Hamilton.\n\n\"I should have said car,\" said the unperturbed Bones.  \"The very\nappearance of it shows you that the thing is a swindle from beginning\nto end.  Oh, why did you go against my advice, dear old Ham?  Why did\nyou?\"\n\n\"You humbug!\" said the wrathful Hamilton.  \"You were just this minute\napologising for giving me advice.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Bones cheerfully, \"was before I'd heard your story.  Yes,\nHam, you've been swindled.\"  He thought a moment.  \"Four thousand\npounds!\"\n\nAnd his jaw dropped.\n\nBones had been dealing in large sums of late, and had forgotten just\nthe significance of four thousand pounds to a young officer.  He was\ntoo much of a little gentleman to put his thoughts into words, but it\ncame upon him like a flash that the money which Hamilton had invested\nin the Plover Light Car Company was every penny he possessed in the\nworld, a little legacy he had received just before Bones had left the\nCoast, plus all his savings for years.\n\n\"Ham,\" he said hollowly, \"I am a jolly old rotter!  Here I've been\nbluffing and swanking to you when I ought to have been thinking out a\nway of getting things right.\"\n\nHamilton laughed.\n\n\"I'm afraid you're not going to get things right, Bones,\" he said.\n\"The only thing I did think was that you might possibly know something\nabout this firm.\"\n\nAt any other moment Bones would have claimed an extensive acquaintance\nwith the firm and its working, but now he shook his head, and Hamilton\nsighed.\n\n\"Sanders told me to come up and see you,\" he said.  \"Sanders has great\nfaith in you, Bones.\"\n\nBones went very red, coughed, picked up his long-plumed pen and put it\ndown again.\n\n\"At any rate,\" said Hamilton, \"you know enough about the City to tell\nme this--is there any chance of my getting this money back?\"\n\nBones rose jerkily.\n\n\"Ham,\" he said, and Hamilton sensed a tremendous sincerity in his\nvoice, \"that money's going to come back to you, or the name of Augustus\nTibbetts goes down in the jolly old records as a failure.\"\n\nA minute later Captain Hamilton found himself hand-shook from the room.\nHere for Bones was a great occasion.  With both elbows on the desk, and\ntwo hands searching his hair, he sat worrying out what he afterwards\nadmitted was the most difficult problem that ever confronted him.\n\nAfter half an hour's hair-pulling he went slowly across his beautiful\nroom and knocked discreetly on the door of the outer office.\n\nMiss Marguerite Whitland had long since grown weary of begging him to\ndrop this practice.  She found it a simple matter to say \"Come in!\" and\nBones entered, closing the door behind him, and stood in a deferential\nattitude two paces from the closed door.\n\n\"Young miss,\" he said quietly, \"may I consult you?\"\n\n\"You may even consult me,\" she said as gravely.\n\n\"It is a very curious problem, dear old Marguerite,\" said Bones in a\nlow, hushed tone.  \"It concerns the future of my very dearest\nfriend--the very dearest friend in all the world,\" he said\nemphatically, \"of the male sex,\" he added hastily.  \"Of course,\nfriendships between jolly old officers are on a different plane, if you\nunderstand me, to friendships between--I mean to say, dear old thing,\nI'm not being personal or drawing comparisons, because the feeling I\nhave for you----\"\n\nHere his eloquence ran dry.  She knew him now well enough to be neither\nconfused nor annoyed nor alarmed when Bones broke forth into an\nexposition of his private feelings.  Very calmly she returned the\nconversation to the rails.\n\n\"It is a matter which concerns a very dear friend of yours,\" she said\nsuggestively, and Bones nodded and beamed.\n\n\"Of course you guessed that,\" he said admiringly.  \"You're the jolliest\nold typewriter that ever lived!  I don't suppose any other young woman\nin London would have----\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, they would,\" she said.  \"You'd already told me.  I suppose\nthat you've forgotten it.\"\n\n\"Well, to cut a long story short, dear old Miss Marguerite,\" said\nBones, leaning confidentially on the table and talking down into her\nupturned lace, \"I must find the whereabouts of a certain rascal or\nrascals, trading or masquerading, knowingly or unknowingly, to the best\nof my knowledge and belief, as the----\"  He stopped and frowned.  \"Now,\nwhat the dickens was the name of that bird?\" he said.  \"Pheasant,\npartridge, ostrich, bat, flying fish, sparrow--it's something to do\nwith eggs.  What are the eggs you eat?\"\n\n\"I seldom eat eggs,\" said the girl quietly, \"but when I do they are the\neggs of the common domestic fowl.\"\n\n\"It ain't him,\" said Bones, shaking his head.  \"No, it's--I've got\nit--Plover--the Plover Light Car Company.\"\n\nThe girl made a note on her pad.\n\n\"I want you to get the best men in London to search out this Company.\nIf necessary, get two private detectives, or even three.  Set them to\nwork at once, and spare no expense.  I want to know who's running the\ncompany--I'd investigate the matter myself, but I'm so fearfully\nbusy--and where their offices are.  Tell the detectives,\" said Bones,\nwarming to the subject, \"to hang around the motor-car shops in the West\nEnd.  They're bound to hear a word dropped here and there, and----\"\n\n\"I quite understand,\" said the girl.\n\nBones put out his lean paw and solemnly shook the girl's hand.\n\n\"If,\" he said, with a tremble in his voice, \"if there's a typewriter in\nLondon that knows more than you, my jolly old Marguerite, I'll eat my\nhead.\"\n\nOn which lines he made his exit.\n\nFive minutes later the girl came into the office with a slip of paper.\n\n\"The Plover Motor Car Company is registered at 604, Gracechurch\nStreet,\" she said.  \"It has a capital of eighty thousand pounds, of\nwhich forty thousand pounds is paid up.  It has works at Kenwood, in\nthe north-west of London, and the managing director is Mr. Charles O.\nSoames.\"\n\nBones could only look at her open-mouthed.\n\n\"Where on earth did you discover all this surprising information, dear\nmiss?\" he asked, and the girl laughed quietly.\n\n\"I can even tell you their telephone number,\" she said, \"because it\nhappens to be in the Telephone Book.  The rest I found in the Stock\nExchange Year Book.\"\n\nBones shook his head in silent admiration.\n\n\"If there's a typewriter in London----\" he began, but she had fled.\n\nAn hour later Bones had evolved his magnificent idea.  It was an idea\nworthy of his big, generous heart and his amazing optimism.\n\nMr. Charles O. Soames, who sat at a littered table in his\nshirt-sleeves, was a man with a big shock of hair and large and heavily\ndrooping moustache, and a black chin.  He smoked a big, heavy pipe,\nand, at the moment Bones was announced, his busy pencil was calling\ninto life a new company offering the most amazing prospects to the\nyoung and wealthy.\n\nHe took the card from the hands of his very plain typist, and\nsuppressed the howl of joy which rose to his throat.  For the name of\nBones was known in the City of London, and it was the dream of such men\nas Charles O. Soames that one day they would walk from the office of\nMr. Augustus Tibbetts with large parcels of his paper currency under\neach arm.\n\nHe jumped up from his chair and slipped on a coat, pushed the\nprospectus he was writing under a heap of documents--one at least of\nwhich bore a striking family likeness to a county court writ--and\nwelcomed his visitor decorously and even profoundly.\n\n\"In _re_ Plover Car,\" said Bones briskly.  He prided himself upon\ncoming to the point with the least possible delay.\n\nThe face of Mr. Soames fell.\n\n\"Oh, you want to buy a car?\" he said.  He might have truly said \"the\ncar,\" but under the circumstances he thought that this would be\ntactless.\n\n\"No, dear old company promoter,\" said Bones, \"I do not want to buy your\ncar.  In fact, you have no cars to sell.\"\n\n\"We've had a lot of labour trouble,\" said Mr. Soames hurriedly.\n\"You've no idea of the difficulties in production--what with the\nGovernment holding up supplies--but in a few months----\"\n\n\"I know all about that,\" said Bones.  \"Now, I'm a man of affairs and a\nman of business.\"\n\nHe said this so definitely that it sounded like a threat.\n\n\"I'm putting it to you, as one City of London business person to\nanother City of London business person, is it possible to make cars at\nyour factory?\"\n\nMr. Soames rose to the occasion.\n\n\"I assure you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said earnestly, \"it is possible.  It\nwants a little more capital than we've been able to raise.\"\n\nThis was the trouble with all Mr. Soames's companies, a long list of\nwhich appeared on a brass plate by the side of his door.  None of them\nwere sufficiently capitalised to do anything except to supply him with\nhis fees as managing director.\n\nBones produced a dinky little pocket-book from his waistcoat and read\nhis notes, or, rather, attempted to read his notes.  Presently he gave\nit up and trusted to his memory.\n\n\"You've got forty thousand pounds subscribed to your Company,\" he said.\n\"Now, I'll tell you what I'm willing to do--I will take over your\nshares at a price.\"\n\nMr. Soames swallowed hard.  Here was one of the dreams of his life\ncoming true.\n\n\"There are four million shares issued,\" Bones went on, consulting his\nnotebook.\n\n\"Eh?\" said Mr. Soames in a shocked voice.\n\nBones looked at his book closer.\n\n\"Is it four hundred thousand?\"\n\n\"Forty thousand,\" said Mr. Soames gently.\n\n\"It is a matter of indifference,\" said Bones.  \"The point is, will you\nsell?\"\n\nThe managing director of the Plover Light Car Company pursed his lips.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"the shares are at a premium--not,\" he added\nquickly, \"that they are being dealt with on 'Change.  We have not\ntroubled to apply for quotations.  But I assure you, my dear sir, the\nshares are at a premium.\"\n\nBones said nothing.\n\n\"At a small premium,\" said Mr. Soames hopefully.\n\nBones made no reply.\n\n\"At a half a crown premium,\" said Mr. Soames pleadingly.\n\n\"At par,\" said Bones, in his firmest and most business-like tones.\n\nThe matter was not settled there and then, because matters are not\nsettled with such haste in the City of London.  Bones went home to his\noffice with a new set of notes, and wired to Hamilton, asking him to\ncome on the following day.\n\nIt was a great scheme that Bones worked out that night, with the aid of\nthe sceptical Miss Whitland.  His desk was piled high with technical\npublications dealing with the motor-car industry.  The fact that he was\nbuying the Company in order to rescue a friend's investment passed\nentirely from his mind in the splendid dream he conjured from his\ndubious calculations.\n\nThe Plover car should cover the face of the earth.  He read an article\non mass production, showing how a celebrated American produced a\nthousand or a hundred thousand cars a day--he wasn't certain which--and\nhow the car, in various parts, passed along an endless table, between\nlines of expectant workmen, each of whom fixed a nut or unfixed a nut,\nso that, when the machine finally reached its journey's end, it left\nthe table under its own power.\n\nBones designed a circular table, so that, if any of the workmen forgot\nto fix a bar or a nut or a wheel, the error could be rectified when the\ncar came round again.  The Plover car should be a household word.  Its\nfactories should spread over North London, and every year there should\nbe a dinner with Bones in the chair, and a beautiful secretary on his\nright, and Bones should make speeches announcing the amount of the\nprofits which were to be distributed to his thousands of hands in the\nshape of bonuses.\n\nHamilton came promptly at ten o'clock, and he came violently.  He flew\ninto the office and banged a paper down on Bones's desk with the\nenthusiasm of one who had become the sudden possessor of money which he\nhad not earned.\n\n\"Dear old thing, dear old thing,\" said Bones testily, \"remember dear\nold Dicky Orum--preserve the decencies, dear old Ham.  You're not in\nthe Wild West now, my cheery boy.\"\n\n\"Bones,\" shouted Hamilton, \"you're my mascot!  Do you know what has\nhappened?\"\n\n\"Lower your voice, lower your voice, dear old friend,\" protested Bones.\n\"My typewriter mustn't think I am quarrelling.\"\n\n\"He came last night,\" said Hamilton, \"just as I was going to bed, and\nknocked me up.\"  He was almost incoherent in his joy.  \"He offered me\nthree thousand five hundred pounds for my shares, and I took it like a\nshot.\"\n\nBones gaped at him.\n\n\"Offered you three thousand five hundred?\" he gasped.  \"Good heavens!\nYou don't mean to say----\"\n\nConsider the tragedy of that moment.  Here was Bones, full of great\nschemes for establishing a car upon the world's markets, who had in his\nhead planned extensive works, who saw in his mind's eye vistas of long,\nwhite-covered festive boards, and heard the roar of cheering which\ngreeted him when he rose to propose continued prosperity to the firm.\nConsider also that his cheque was on the table before him, already made\nout and signed.  He was at that moment awaiting the arrival of Mr.\nSoames.\n\nAnd then to this picture, tangible or fanciful, add Mr. Charles O.\nSoames himself, ushered through the door of the outer office and\nstanding as though stricken to stone at the sight of Bones and Hamilton\nin consultation.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Bones.\n\nMr. Soames uttered a strangled cry and strode to the centre of the\nroom, his face working.\n\n\"So it was a ramp, was it?\" he said.  \"A swindle, eh?  You put this up\nto get your pal out of the cart?\"\n\n\"My dear old----\" began Bones in a shocked voice.\n\n\"I see how it was done.  Well, you've had me for three thousand five\nhundred, and your pal's lucky.  That's all I've got to say.  It is the\nfirst time I've ever been caught; and to be caught by a mug like\nyou----\"\n\n\"Dear old thing, moderate your language,\" murmured Bones.\n\nMr. Soames breathed heavily through his nose, thrust his hat on the\nback of his head, and, without another word, strode from the office,\nand they heard the door slam behind him.  Bones and Hamilton exchanged\nglances; then Bones picked up the cheque from the desk and slowly tore\nit up.  He seemed to spend his life tearing up expensive cheques.\n\n\"What is it, Bones?  What the dickens did you do?\" asked the puzzled\nHamilton.\n\n\"Dear old Ham,\" said Bones solemnly, \"it was a little scheme--just a\nlittle scheme.  Sit down, dear old officer,\" he said, after a solemn\npause.  \"And let this be a warning to you.  Don't put your money in\nindustries, dear old Captain Hamilton.  What with the state of the\nlabour market, and the deuced ingratitude of the working classes, it's\npositively heartbreaking--it is, indeed, dear old Ham.\"\n\nAnd then and there he changed the whole plan and went out of\nindustrials for good.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nA CINEMA PICTURE\n\nMr. Augustus Tibbetts, called \"Bones,\" made money by sheer luck--he\nmade more by sheer artistic judgment.  That is a fact which an old\nfriend sensed a very short time after he had renewed his acquaintance\nwith his sometime subordinate.\n\nYet Bones had the curious habit of making money in quite a different\nway from that which he planned--as, for example, in the matter of the\ngreat oil amalgamation.  In these days of aeroplane travel, when it is\nnext to impossible to watch the comings and goings of important\nindividuals, or even to get wind of directors' meetings, the City is\napt to be a little jumpy, and to respond to wild rumours in a fashion\nextremely trying to the nerves of conservative brokers.\n\nThere were rumours of a fusion of interests between the Franco-Persian\nOil Company and the Petroleum Consolidated--rumours which set the\nshares of both concerns jumping up and down like two badly trained\njazzers.  The directorate of both companies expressed their surprise\nthat a credulous public could accept such stories, and both M. Jorris,\nthe emperor of the Franco-Persian block, and George Y. Walters, the\nprince regent of the \"Petco,\" denied indignantly that any amalgamation\nwas even dreamt of.\n\nBefore these denials came along Bones had plunged into the oil market,\nmaking one of the few flutters which stand as interrogation marks\nagainst his wisdom and foresight.\n\nHe did not lose; rather, he was the winner by his adventure.  The\nextent of his immediate gains he inscribed in his private ledger; his\nultimate and bigger balance he entered under a head which had nothing\nto do with the oil gamble--which was just like Bones, as Hamilton\nsubsequently remarked.\n\nHamilton was staying with Sanders--late Commissioner of a certain group\nof Territories--and Bones was the subject of conversation one morning\nat breakfast.\n\nThe third at the table was an exceedingly pretty girl, whom the maid\ncalled \"Madame,\" and who opened several letters addressed to \"Mrs.\nSanders,\" but who in days not long past had been known as Patricia\nHamilton.\n\n\"Bones is wonderful,\" said Sanders, \"truly wonderful!  A man I know in\nthe City tells me that most of the things he touches turn up trumps.\nAnd it isn't luck or chance.  Bones is developing a queer business\nsense.\"\n\nHamilton nodded.\n\n\"It is his romantic soul which gets him there,\" he said.  \"Bones will\nnot look at a proposition which hasn't something fantastical behind it.\nHe doesn't know much about business, but he's a regular whale on\nadventure.  I've been studying him for the past month, and I'm\nbeginning to sense his method.  If he sees a logical and happy end to\nthe romantic side of any new business, he takes it on.  He simply\ncarries the business through on the back of a dream.\"\n\nThe girl looked up from the coffee-pot she was handling.\n\n\"Have you made up your mind, dear?\"\n\n\"About going in with Bones?\"  Hamilton smiled.  \"No, not yet.  Bones is\nfrantically insistent, has had a beautiful new Sheraton desk placed in\nhis office, and says that I'm the influence he wants, but----\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I think I understand,\" said Sanders.  \"You feel that he is doing it\nall out of sheer generosity and kindness.  That would be like Bones.\nBut isn't there a chance that what he says is true--that he does want a\ncorrective influence?\"\n\n\"Maybe that is so,\" said Captain Hamilton doubtfully.  \"And then\nthere's the money.  I don't mind investing my little lot, but it would\nworry me to see Bones pretending that all the losses of the firm came\nout of his share, and a big slice of the profits going into mine.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't let that worry you,\" said his sister quietly.  \"Bones is\ntoo nice-minded to do anything so crude.  Of course, your money is\nnothing compared with Bones's fortune, but why don't you join him on\nthe understanding that the capital of the Company should be----  How\nmuch would you put in?\n\n\"Four thousand.\"\n\n\"Well, make the capital eight thousand.  Bones could always lend the\nCompany money.  Debentures--isn't that the word?\"\n\nSanders smiled in her face.\n\n\"You're a remarkable lady,\" he said.  \"From where on earth did you get\nyour ideas on finance?\"\n\nShe went red.\n\n\"I lunched with Bones yesterday,\" she said.  \"And here is the post.\"\n\n\"Silence, babbler,\" said Hamilton.  \"Before we go any farther, what\nabout this matter of partnership you were discussing with Patricia?\"\n\nThe maid distributed the letters.  One was addressed:\n\n\"Captin Captian Hamilton, D.S.O.\"\n\n\"From Bones,\" said Hamilton unnecessarily, and Bones's letter claimed\nfirst attention.  It was a frantic and an ecstatic epistle, heavily\nunderlined and exclaimed.\n\n\"Dear old old Ham,\" it ran, \"you simply must join me in _magnifficant_\nnew sceme sheme plan!  Wonderfull prophits profets!  The most\nextraordiny _chance_ for a fortune...\"\n\n\"For Heaven's sake, what's this?\" asked Hamilton, handing the letter\nacross to his sister and indicating an illegible line.  \"It looks like\n'a bad girl's leg' to me.\"\n\n\"My dear!\" said the shocked Mrs. Sanders, and studied the vile\ncaligraphy.  \"It certainly does look like that,\" she admitted, \"and----\nI see!  'Legacy' is the word.\"\n\n\"A bad girl's legacy is the titel of the play story picture\" (Bones\nnever crossed anything out).  \"There's a studyo at Tunbridge and two\ncameras and a fellow awfully nice fellow who understands it.  A pot of\nmoney the story can be improve improved imensely.  Come in it dear old\nman--_magnifficant_ chance.  See me at office eariliest earilest\nealiest possible time.\n\n\"Thine in art for art sake,\n    \"BONES.\"\n\n\"From which I gather that Bones is taking a header into the cinema\nbusiness,\" said Sanders.  \"What do you say, Hamilton?\"\n\nHamilton thought a while.\n\n\"I'll see Bones,\" he said.\n\nHe arrived in Town soon after ten, but Bones had been at his office two\nhours earlier, for the fever of the new enterprise was upon him, and\nhis desk was piled high with notes, memoranda, price lists and trade\npublications.  (Bones, in his fine rage of construction, flew to the\ntechnical journals as young authors fly to the Thesaurus.)\n\nAs Hamilton entered the office, Bones glared up.\n\n\"A chair,\" said the young man peremptorily.  \"No time to be lost, dear\nold artist.  Time is on the wing, the light is fadin', an' if we want\nto put this jolly old country--God bless it!--in the forefront----\"\n\nBones put down his pen and leant back in his chair.\n\n\"Ham,\" he said, \"I had a bit of a pow-pow with your sacred and sainted\nsister, bless her jolly old heart.  That's where the idea arose.  Are\nyou on?\"\n\n\"I'm on,\" said Hamilton, and there was a moving scene.  Bones shook his\nhands and spoke broken English.\n\n\"There's your perfectly twee little desk, dear old officer,\" he said,\npointing to a massive piece of furniture facing his own.  \"And there's\nonly one matter to be settled.\"\n\nHe was obviously uncomfortable, and Hamilton would have reached for his\ncheque-book, only he knew his Bones much better than to suppose that\nsuch a sordid matter as finance could cause his agitation.\n\n\"Ham,\" said Bones, clearing his throat and speaking with an effort,\n\"old comrade of a hundred gallant encounters, and dear old friend----\"\n\n\"What's the game?\" asked Hamilton suspiciously.\n\n\"There's no game,\" said the depressed Bones.  \"This is a very serious\npiece of business, my jolly old comrade.  As my highly respected\npartner, you're entitled to use the office as you like--come in when\nyou like, go home when you like.  If you have a pain in the tum-tum,\ndear old friend, just go to bed and trust old Bones to carry on.  Use\nany paper that's going, help yourself to nibs--you'll find there's some\nbeautiful nibs in that cupboard--in fact, do as you jolly well like;\nbut----\"\n\n\"But?\" repeated Hamilton.\n\n\"On one point alone, dear old thing,\" said Bones miserably, yet\nheroically, \"we do not share.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Hamilton, not without curiosity.\n\n\"My typewriter is my typewriter,\" said Bones firmly, and Hamilton\nlaughed.\n\n\"You silly ass!\" he said.  \"I'm not going to play with your typewriter.\"\n\n\"That's just what I mean,\" said Bones.  \"You couldn't have put it\nbetter, dear old friend.  Thank you.\"\n\nHe strode across the room, gripped Hamilton's hand and wrung it.\n\n\"Dear old thing, she's too young,\" he said brokenly.  \"Hard life ...\nterrible experience...  Play with her young affections, dear old thing?\nNo...\"\n\n\"Who the dickens are you talking about?  You said typewriter.\"\n\n\"I said typewriter,\" agreed Bones gravely.  \"I am speaking about my----\"\n\nA light dawned upon Hamilton.\n\n\"You mean your secretary?\"\n\n\"I mean my secretary,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Good Heavens, Bones!\" scoffed Hamilton.  \"Of course I shan't bother\nher.  She's your private secretary, and naturally I wouldn't think of\ngiving her work.\"\n\n\"Or orders,\" said Bones gently.  \"That's a point, dear old thing.  I\nsimply couldn't sit here and listen to you giving her orders.  I should\nscream.  I'm perfectly certain I can trust you, Ham.  I know what you\nare with the girls, but there are times----\"\n\n\"You know what I am with the girls?\" said the wrathful Hamilton.  \"What\nthe dickens do you know about me, you libellous young devil?\"\n\nBones raised his hand.\n\n\"We will not refer to the past,\" he said meaningly and was so\nimpressive that Hamilton began to search his mind for some forgotten\npeccadillo.\n\n\"All that being arranged to our mutual satisfaction, dear old partner,\"\nsaid Bones brightly, \"permit me to introduce you.\"\n\nHe walked to the glass-panelled door leading to the outer office, and\nknocked discreetly, Hamilton watching him in wonder.  He saw him\ndisappear, closing the door after him.  Presently he came out again,\nfollowing the girl.\n\n\"Dear young miss,\" said Bones in his squeakiest voice, a sure sign of\nhis perturbation, \"permit me to introduce partner, ancient commander,\ngallant and painstaking, jolly old Captain Hamilton, D.S.O.--which\nstands, young typewriter, for Deuced Satisfactory Officer.\"\n\nThe girl, smiling, shook hands, and Hamilton for the first time looked\nher in the face.  He had been amazed before by her classic beauty, but\nnow he saw a greater intelligence than he had expected to find in so\npretty a face, and, most pleasing of all, a sense of humour.\n\n\"Bones and I are very old friends,\" he explained.\n\n\"Hem!\" said Bones severely.\n\n\"Bones?\" said the girl, puzzled.\n\n\"Naturally!\" murmured Bones.  \"Dear old Ham, be decent.  You can't\nexpect an innocent young typewriter to think of her employer as\n'Bones.'\"\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry,\" Hamilton hastened to apologise, \"but you see,\nBones and I----\"\n\n\"Dicky Orum,\" murmured Bones.  \"Remember yourself, Ham, old indiscreet\none--Mr. Tibbetts.  And here's the naughty old picture-taker,\" he said\nin another tone, and rushed to offer an effusive welcome to a smart\nyoung man with long, black, wavy hair and a face reminiscent, to all\nstudents who have studied his many pictures, of Louis XV.  Strangely\nenough, his name was Louis.  He was even called Lew.\n\n\"Sit down, my dear Mr. Becksteine,\" said Bones.  \"Let me introduce you\nto my partner.  Captain Hamilton, D.S.O.--a jolly old comrade-in-arms\nand all that sort of thing.  My lady typewriter you know, and anyway,\nthere's no necessity for your knowing her----  I mean,\" he said\nhastily, \"she doesn't want to know you, dear old thing.  Now, don't be\npeevish.  Ham, you sit there.  Becksteine will sit there.  You, young\nmiss, will sit near me, ready to take down my notes as they fall from\nmy ingenious old brain.\"\n\nIn the bustle and confusion the embarrassing moment of Hamilton's\nintroduction was forgotten.  Bones had a manuscript locked away in the\nbottom drawer of his desk, and when he had found the key for this, and\nhad placed the document upon the table, and when he had found certain\nother papers, and when the girl was seated in a much more comfortable\nchair--Bones fussed about like an old hen--the proceedings began.\n\nBones explained.\n\nHe had seen the derelict cinema company advertised in a technical\njournal, had been impressed with the amount of the impedimenta which\naccompanied the proprietorship of the syndicate, had been seized with a\nbrilliant idea, bought the property, lock, stock, and barrel, for two\nthousand pounds, for which sum, as an act of grace, the late\nproprietors allowed him to take over the contract of Mr. Lew\nBecksteine, that amiable and gifted producer.\n\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that this arrangement was immensely\nsatisfactory to the syndicate, which was so tied and bound to Mr.\nBecksteine for the next twelve months that to have cancelled his\ncontract would have cost them the greater part of the purchase price\nwhich Bones paid.\n\n\"This is the story,\" said Bones impressively.  \"And, partner Ham,\nbelieve me, I've read many, many stories in my life, but never, never\nhas one touched me as this has.  It's a jolly old tear-bringer, Ham.\nEven a hardened, wicked old dev--old bird like you would positively\ndissolve.  You would really, dear old Ham, so don't deny it.  You know\nyou've got one of the tenderest hearts in the world, you rascal!\"\n\nHe got up and shook hands with Hamilton, though there was no necessity\nfor him to move.\n\n\"Now, clever old Becksteine thinks that this is going to be a scorcher.\"\n\n\"A winner, a winner,\" murmured Mr. Becksteine, closing his eyes and\nshaking his head.  He spoke on this occasion very softly, but he could\nraise his voice to thrilling heights.  \"A sure winner, my dear sir.  I\nhave been in the profession for twenty-seven years, and never in my\nlife have I read a drama which contains so much heart appeal----\"\n\n\"You hear?\" said Bones in a hoarse whisper.\n\n\"--so much genuine comedy----\"\n\nBones nodded.\n\n\"--so much that I might say goes straight to the passionate heart of\nthe great public, as this remarkable, brilliantly planned, admirably\nplanted, exquisitely balanced little cameo of real life.\"\n\n\"It's to be a two-roller,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Reeler,\" murmured Mr. Becksteine.\n\n\"Reeler or roller, dear old thing; don't let's quarrel over how a\nthing's spelt,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Who wrote it?\" asked Hamilton.\n\nMr. Becksteine coughed modestly.\n\n\"Jolly old Becksteine wrote it,\" said Bones.  \"That man, Ham, is one of\nthe most brilliant geniuses in this or any other world.  Aren't you?\nSpeak up, old playwright.  Don't be shy, old thing.\"\n\nMr. Becksteine coughed again.\n\n\"I do not know anything about other worlds,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Now, this is my idea,\" said Bones, interrupting what promised to be a\nfree and frank admission of Mr. Becksteine's genius.  \"I've worked the\nthing out, and I see just how we can save money.  In producing\ntwo-roller cinematographs--that's the technical term,\" explained Bones,\n\"the heavy expense is with the artistes.  The salaries that these\npeople are paid!  My dear old Ham, you'd never believe.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you can avoid paying salaries,\" said Hamilton\npatiently.  \"I suppose even actors have to live.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Becksteine, shaking his head.\n\n\"Of course, dear old thing.  But why pay outside actors?\" said Bones\ntriumphantly.\n\nHe glared from one face to the other with a ferocity of expression\nwhich did no more than indicate the strength of his conviction.\n\n\"Why not keep the money in the family, dear old Ham?  That's what I ask\nyou.  Answer me that.\"  He leaned back in his chair, thrust his hands\nin his trousers pockets, and blandly surveyed his discomfited audience.\n\n\"But you've got to have actors, my dear chap,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Naturally and necessarily,\" replied Bones, nodding with very large\nnods.  \"And we have them.  Who is Jasper Brown, the villain who tries\nto rob the poor girl of her legacy and casts the vilest aspersions upon\nher jolly old name?\"\n\n\"Who is?\" asked the innocent Hamilton.\n\n\"You are,\" said Bones.\n\nHamilton gasped.\n\n\"Who is Frank Fearnot, the young and handsome soldier--well, not\nnecessarily handsome, but pretty good-looking--who rescues the girl\nfrom her sad predicament?\"\n\n\"Well, that can't be me, anyway,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"It is not,\" said Bones.  \"It is me!  Who is the gorgeous but sad old\ninnocent one who's chased by you, Ham, till the poor little soul\ndoesn't know which way to turn, until this jolly young officer steps\nbrightly on the scene, whistling a merry tune, and, throwing his arms\nabout her, saves her, dear old thing, from her fate--or, really, from a\nperfectly awful rotten time.\"\n\n\"Who is she?\" asked Hamilton softly.\n\nBones blinked and turned to the girl slowly.\n\n\"My dear old miss,\" he said, \"what do you think?\"\n\n\"What do I think?\" asked the startled girl.  \"What do I think about\nwhat?\"\n\n\"There's a part,\" said Bones--\"there's one of the grandest parts that\nwas ever written since Shakespeare shut his little copybook.\"\n\n\"You're not suggesting that I should play it?\" she asked, open-mouthed.\n\n\"Made for you, dear old typewriter, positively made for you, that\npart,\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"Of course I shall do nothing so silly,\" said the girl, with a laugh.\n\"Oh, Mr. Tibbetts, you really didn't think that I'd do such a----\"\n\nShe didn't finish the sentence, but Hamilton could have supplied the\nthree missing words without any difficulty.\n\nThereafter followed a discussion, which in the main consisted of joint\nand several rejection of parts.  Marguerite Whitland most resolutely\nrefused to play the part of the bad girl, even though Bones promised to\nchange the title to \"The Good Girl,\" even though he wheedled his best,\neven though he struck attitudes indicative of despair and utter ruin,\neven though the gentle persuasiveness of Mr. Lew Becksteine was added\nto his entreaties.  And Hamilton as resolutely declined to have\nanything to do with the bad man.  Mr. Becksteine solved the difficulty\nby undertaking to produce the necessary actors and actresses at the\nminimum of cost.\n\n\"Of course you won't play, Bones?\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Bones.  \"I'm not so sure, dear old thing.  I've\ngot a lot of acting talent in me, and I feel the part--that's a\ntechnical term you won't understand.\"\n\n\"But surely, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said the girl reproachfully, \"you won't\nallow yourself to be photographed embracing a perfectly strange lady?\"\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Art, my dear old typewriter,\" he said.  \"She'll be no more to me than\na bit of wood, dear old miss.  I shall embrace her and forget all about\nit the second after.  You need have no cause for apprehension, really\nand truly.\"\n\n\"I am not at all apprehensive,\" said the girl coldly, and Bones\nfollowed her to her office, showering explanations of his meaning over\nher shoulder.\n\nOn the third day Hamilton went back to Twickenham a very weary man.\n\n\"Bones is really indefatigable,\" he said irritably, but yet admiringly.\n\"He has had those unfortunate actors rehearsing in the open fields, on\nthe highways and byways.  Really, old Bones has no sense of decency.\nHe's got one big scene which he insists upon taking in a private park.\nI shudder to think what will happen if the owner comes along and\ncatches Bones and his wretched company.\"\n\nSanders laughed quietly.\n\n\"What do you think he'll do with the film?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, he'll sell it,\" said Hamilton.  \"I tell you, Bones is amazing.  He\nhas found a City man who is interested in the film industry, a\nstockbroker or something, who has promised to see every bit of film as\nit is produced and give him advice on the subject; and, incredible as\nit may sound, the first half-dozen scenes that Bones has taken have\npassed muster.\"\n\n\"Who turns the handle of the camera?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Bones,\" said Hamilton, trying not to laugh.  \"He practised the\nrevolutions on a knife-cleaning machine!\"\n\nThe fourth day it rained, but the fifth day Bones took his company in a\nhired motor into the country, and, blissfully ignoring such admonitions\nas \"Trespassers will be shot,\" he led the way over a wall to the sacred\nsoil of an Englishman's stately home.  Bones wanted the wood, because\none of his scenes was laid on the edge of a wood.  It was the scene\nwhere the bad girl, despairing of convincing anybody as to her inherent\ngoodness, was taking a final farewell of the world before \"leaving a\nlife which had held nothing but sadness and misunderstanding,\" to quote\nthe title which was to introduce this touching episode.\n\nBones found the right location, fitted up his camera, placed the\nyellow-faced girl--the cinema artiste has a somewhat bilious appearance\nwhen facing the lens--and began his instructions.\n\n\"Now, you walk on here, dear old Miss What's-Your-Name.  You come from\nthat tree with halting footsteps--like this, dear old thing.  Watch and\nlearn.\"\n\nBones staggered across the greensward, clasping his brow, sank on his\nknees, folded his arms across his chest, and looked sorrowfully at the\nheavens, shaking his head.\n\nHamilton screamed with laughter.\n\n\"Behave yourself, naughty old sceptic,\" said Bones severely.\n\nAfter half an hour's preliminary rehearsal, the picture was taken, and\nBones now prepared to depart; but Mr. Lew Becksteine, from whose hands\nBones had taken, not only the direction of the play, but the very\nexcuse for existence, let fall a few uncomfortable words.\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, in the sad, bored voice of an\nartiste who is forced to witness the inferior work of another, \"it is\nin this scene that the two lawyers must be taken, walking through the\nwood, quite unconscious of the unhappy fate which has overtaken the\nheiress for whom they are searching.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Bones, and scratched his nose.\n\nHe looked round for likely lawyers.  Hamilton stole gently away.\n\n\"Now, why the dickens didn't you remind me, you careless old producer,\nto bring two lawyers with me?\" asked Bones.  \"Dash it all, there's\nnothing here that looks like a lawyer.  Couldn't it be taken somewhere\nelse?\"\n\nMr. Becksteine had reached the stage where he was not prepared to make\nthings easy for his employer.\n\n\"Utterly impossible,\" he said; \"you must have exactly the same scenery.\nThe camera cannot lie.\"\n\nBones surveyed his little company, but without receiving any\nencouragement.\n\n\"Perhaps I might find a couple of fellows on the road,\" he suggested.\n\n\"It is hardly likely,\" said Mr. Lew Becksteine, \"that you will discover\nin this remote country village two gentlemen arrayed in faultlessly\nfitting morning-coats and top-hats!\"\n\n\"I don't know so much about that,\" said the optimistic Bones, and took\na short cut through the wood, knowing that the grounds made an abrupt\nturn where they skirted the main road.\n\nHe was half-way through the copse when he stopped.  Now, Bones was a\ngreat believer in miracles, but they had to be very spectacular\nmiracles.  The fact that standing in the middle of the woodland path\nwere two middle-aged gentlemen in top-hats and morning-coats, seemed to\nBones to be a mere slice of luck.  It was, in fact, a miracle of the\nfirst class.  He crept silently back, raced down the steps to where the\nlittle party stood.\n\n\"Camera!\" he hissed.  \"Bring it along, dear old thing.  Don't make a\nnoise!  Ham, old boy, will you help?  You other persons, stay where you\nare.\"\n\nHamilton shouldered the camera, and on the way up the slope Bones\nrevealed his fell intention.\n\n\"There is no need to tell these silly old jossers what we're doing,\" he\nsaid.  \"You see what I mean, Ham, old boy?  We'll just take a picture\nof them as they come along.  Nobody will be any the wiser, and all\nwe'll have to do will be to put a little note in.\"  All the time he was\nfixing the camera on the tripod, focussing the lens on a tree by the\npath.  (It was amazing how quickly Bones mastered the technique of any\nnew hobby he took up.)\n\nFrom where Hamilton crouched in the bushes he could see the two men\nplainly.  His heart quaked, realising that one at least was possibly\nthe owner of the property on which he was trespassing; and he had all\nan Englishman's horror of trespass.  They were talking together, these\nrespectable gentlemen, when Bones began to turn the handle.  They had\nto pass through a patch of sunlight, and it was upon this that Bones\nconcentrated.  Once one of them looked around as the sound of clicking\ncame to him, but at that moment Bones decided he had taken enough and\nstopped.\n\n\"This,\" said he, as they gained the by-road where they had made their\nunauthorised entry into the park, \"is a good day's work.\"\n\nTheir car was on the main road, and to Hamilton's surprise he found the\ntwo staid gentlemen regarding it when the party came up.  They were\nregarding it from a high bank behind the wall--a bank which commanded a\nview of the road.  One of them observed the camera and said something\nin a low tone to the other; then the speaker walked down the bank,\nopened a little wicker door in the wall, and came out.\n\nHe was a most polite man, and tactful.\n\n\"Have you been taking pictures?\" he asked.\n\n\"Dear old fellow,\" said Bones.  \"I will not deceive you--we have.\"\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"In the--park, by any chance?\" asked the gentleman carelessly.\n\nBones flinched.  He felt rather guilty, if the truth be told.\n\n\"The fact is----\" he began.\n\nThe elderly man listened to the story of \"The Bad Girl's Legacy,\" its\ngenesis, its remarkable literary qualities, and its photographic value.\nHe seemed to know a great deal about cinematographs, and asked several\nquestions.\n\n\"So you have an expert who sees the pieces as they are produced?\" he\nasked.  \"Who is that?\"\n\n\"Mr. Tim Lewis,\" said Bones.  \"He's one of the----\"\n\n\"Lewis?\" said the other quickly.  \"Is that Lewis the stockbroker?  And\ndoes he see every piece you take?\"\n\nBones was getting weary of answering questions.\n\n\"Respected sir and park proprietor,\" he said, \"if we have trespassed, I\napologise.  If we did any harm innocently, and without knowing that we\ntransgressed the jolly old conventions--if we, as I say, took a picture\nof you and your fellow park proprietor without a thank-you-very-much, I\nam sorry.\"\n\n\"You took me and my friend?\" asked the elderly man quickly.\n\n\"I am telling you, respected sir and cross-examiner, that I took you\nbeing in a deuce of a hole for a lawyer.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the elderly man.  \"Will you do me a favour?  Will you let\nme see your copy of that picture before you show it to Mr. Lewis?  As\nthe respected park proprietor\"--he smiled--\"you owe me that.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear old friend and fellow-sufferer,\" said Bones.\n\"Bless my life and heart and soul, certainly!\"\n\nHe gave the address of the little Wardour Street studio where the film\nwould be developed and printed, and fixed the morrow for an exhibition.\n\n\"I should very much like to see it to-night, if it is no trouble to\nyou.\"\n\n\"We will certainly do our best, sir,\" Hamilton felt it was necessary to\ninterfere at this point.\n\n\"Of course, any extra expense you are put to as the result of\nfacilitating the printing, or whatever you do to these films,\" said the\nelderly man, \"I shall be glad to pay.\"\n\nHe was waiting for Bones and Hamilton at nine o'clock that night in the\ndingy little private theatre which Bones, with great difficulty, had\nsecured for his use.  The printing of the picture had been accelerated,\nand though the print was slightly speckled, it was a good one.\n\nThe elderly man sat in a chair and watched it reeled off, and when the\nlights in the little theatre went up, he turned to Bones with a smile.\n\n\"I'm interested in cinema companies,\" he said, \"and I rather fancy that\nI should like to include your property in an amalgamation I am making.\nI could assist you to fix a price,\" he said to the astonished Bones,\n\"if you would tell me frankly, as I think you will, just what this\nbusiness has cost you from first to last.\"\n\n\"My dear old amalgamator,\" said Bones reproachfully, \"is that business?\nI ask you.\"\n\n\"It may be good business,\" said the other.\n\nBones looked at Hamilton.  They and the elderly man, who had driven up\nto the door of the Wardour Street studio in a magnificent car, were the\nonly three people, besides the operator, who were present.\n\nHamilton nodded.\n\n\"Well,\" said Bones, \"business, dear old thing, is my weakness.  Buying\nand selling is my passion and Lobby.  From first to last, after paying\njolly old Brickdust, this thing is going to cost me more than three\nthousand pounds--say, three thousand five hundred.\"\n\nThe elderly man nodded.\n\n\"Let's make a quick deal,\" he said.  \"I'll give you six thousand pounds\nfor the whole concern, with the pictures as you have taken\nthem--negatives, positives, cameras, etc.  Is it a bargain?\"\n\nBones held out his hand.\n\nThey dined together, a jubilant Bones and a more jubilant Hamilton, at\na little restaurant in Soho.\n\n\"My dear old Ham,\" said Bones, \"it only shows you how things happen.\nThis would have been a grand week for me if those beastly oil shares of\nmine had gone up.  I'm holding 'em for a rise.\"  He opened a newspaper\nhe had bought in the restaurant.  \"I see that Jorris and\nWalters--they're the two oil men--deny that they've ever met or that\nthey're going to amalgamate.  But can you believe these people?\" he\nasked.  \"My dear old thing, the mendacity of these wretched\nfinanciers----\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen them?\" asked Hamilton, to whom the names of Jorris\nand Walters were as well known as to any other man who read his daily\nnewspaper.\n\n\"Seen them?\" said Bones.  \"My dear old fellow, I've met them time and\ntime again.  Two of the jolliest old birds in the world.  Well, here's\nluck!\"\n\nAt that particular moment Mr. Walters and Mr. Jorris were sitting\ntogether in the library of a house in Berkeley Square, the blinds being\nlowered and the curtains being drawn, and Mr. Walters was saying:\n\n\"We'll have to make this thing public on Wednesday.  My dear fellow, I\nnearly fainted when I heard that that impossible young person had\nphotographed us together.  When do you go back to Paris?\"\n\n\"I think I had better stay here,\" said Mr. Jorris.  \"Did the young man\nbleed you?\"\n\n\"Only for six thousand,\" said the pleasant Mr. Walters.  \"I hope the\nyoung beggar's a bear in oil,\" he added viciously.\n\nBut Bones, as we know, was a bull.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nA DEAL IN JUTE\n\nIt is a reasonable theory that every man of genius is two men, one\nvisible, one unseen and often unsuspected by his counterpart.  For who\nhas not felt the shadow's influence in dealing with such as have the\nSpark?  Napoleon spoke of stars, being Corsican and a mystic.  Those\nwho met him in his last days were uneasily conscious that the second\nBonaparte had died on the eve of Waterloo, leaving derelict his\nbrother, a stout and commonplace man who was in turn sycophantic,\ncholeric, and pathetic, but never great.\n\nNoticeable is the influence of the Shadow in the process of\nmoney-making.  It is humanly impossible for some men to be fortunate.\nThey may amass wealth by sheer hard work and hard reasoning, but if\nthey seek a shorter cut to opulence, be sure that short cut ends in a\ncul-de-sac where sits a Bankruptcy Judge and a phalanx of stony-faced\ncreditors.  \"Luck\" is not for them--they were born single.\n\nFor others, the whole management of life is taken from their hands by\ntheir busy Second, who ranges the world to discover opportunities for\nhis partner.\n\nSo it comes about that there are certain men, and Augustus\nTibbetts--or, as he was named, \"Bones\"--was one of these, to whom the\nincrements of life come miraculously.  They could come in no other way,\nbe he ever so learned and experienced.\n\nRather would a greater worldliness have hampered his familiar and in\ntime destroyed its power, just as education destroys the more subtle\ninstincts.  Whilst the learned seismographer eats his dinner,\ncheerfully unconscious of the coming earthquake, his dog shivers\nbeneath the table.\n\nBy this preamble I am not suggesting that Bones was a fool.  Far from\nit.  Bones was wise--uncannily wise in some respects.  His success was\ndue, as to nine-tenths, to his native sense.  His _x_ supplied the\nother fraction.\n\nNo better illustration of the working of this concealed quantity can be\ngiven than the story of the great jute sale and Miss Bertha Stegg.\n\nThe truth about the Government speculation in jute is simply told.  It\nis the story of an official who, in the middle of the War, was seized\nwith the bright idea of procuring enormous quantities of jute for the\nmanufacture of sand-bags.  The fact that by this transaction he might\nhave driven the jute lords of Dundee into frenzy did not enter into his\ncalculations.  Nor did it occur to him that the advantageous position\nin which he hoped to place his Department depended for its attainment\nupon a total lack of foresight on the part of the Dundee merchants.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Dundee had bought well and wisely.  It had\nsufficient stocks to meet all the demands which the Government made\nupon it; and when, after the War, the Department offered its purchase\nat a price which would show a handsome profit to the Government, Dundee\nlaughed long and loudly.\n\nAnd so there was left on the official hands, at the close of the War, a\nquantity of jute which nobody wanted, at a price which nobody would\npay.  And then somebody asked a question in the House of Commons, and\nthe responsible Secretary went hot all over, and framed the reply which\nan Under-secretary subsequently made in such terms as would lead the\ncountry to believe that the jute purchased at a figure beyond the\nmarket value was a valuable asset, and would one day be sold at a\nprofit.\n\nMr. Augustus Tibbetts knew nothing about jute.  But he did read, almost\nevery morning in the daily newspapers, how one person or another had\nmade enormous purchases of linen, or of cloth, or of motor chassis,\npaying fabulous sums on the nail and walking off almost immediately\nwith colossal profits; and every time Bones read such an account he\nwriggled in his chair and made unhappy noises.\n\nThen one afternoon there came to his office a suave gentleman in\nfrock-coat, carrying with him a card which was inscribed \"Ministry of\nSupplies.\"  And the end of that conversation was that Bones, all a\ntwitter of excitement, drove to a gloomy office in Whitehall, where he\ninterviewed a most sacred public official, to whom members of the\npublic were not admitted, perhaps, more than four times a year.\n\nHamilton had watched the proceedings with interest and suspicion.  When\nBones was mysterious he was very mysterious; and he returned that night\nin such a condition of mystery that none but a thought-reading\ndetective could have unravelled him.\n\n\"You seem infernally pleased with yourself, Bones,\" said Hamilton.\n\"What lamentable error have you fallen into?\"\n\n\"Dear old Ham,\" said Bones, with the helpless little laugh which\ncharacterised the very condition of mind which Hamilton had described,\n\"dear old pryer, wait till to-morrow.  Dear old thing, I wouldn't spoil\nit.  Read your jolly old newspaper, dear old inquirer.\"\n\n\"Have you been to the police court?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"Police court?  Police court?\" said Bones testily.  \"Good Heavens, lad!\nWhy this jolly old vulgarity?  No, dear boy, live and learn, dear old\nthing!\"\n\nHamilton undoubtedly lived until the next morning, and learnt.  He saw\nthe headlines the second he opened his newspaper.\n\n\n    GREAT DEAL IN JUTE.\n  PROMINENT CITY MAN BUYS GOVERNMENT SUPPLY OF\n    JUTE FOR A MILLION.\n\n\nHamilton was on his way to the office, and fell back in the corner of\nthe railway carriage with a suppressed moan.  He almost ran to the\noffice, to find Bones stalking up and down the room, dictating an\ninterview to a reporter.\n\n\"One minute, one minute, dear old Ham,\" said.  Bones warningly.  And\nthen, turning to the industrious journalist, he went on where Hamilton\nhad evidently interrupted him.  \"You can say that I've spent a great\ndeal of my life in fearfully dangerous conditions,\" he said.  \"You\nneedn't say where, dear old reporter, just say 'fearfully dangerous\nconditions.'\"\n\n\"What about jute?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"Jute,\" said Bones with relish, \"or, as we call it, _Corcharis\ncapsilaris_, is the famous jute tree.  I have always been interested in\njute and all that sort of thing----  But you know what to say better\nthan I can tell you.  You can also say that I'm young--no, don't say\nthat.  Put it like this: 'Mr. Tibbetts, though apparently\nyoung-looking, bears on his hardened old face the marks of years spent\nin the service of his country.  There is a sort of sadness about his\nfunny old eyes----'  You know what to say, old thing.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said the journalist, rising.  \"You'll see this in the next\nedition, Mr. Tibbetts.\"\n\nWhen the young man had gone, Hamilton staggered across to him.\n\n\"Bones,\" he said, in a hollow voice, \"you've never bought this stuff\nfor a million?\"\n\n\"A million's a bit of an exaggeration, dear old sportsman,\" said Bones.\n\"As a matter of fact, it's about half that sum, and it needn't be paid\nfor a month.  Here is the contract.\"  He smacked his lips and smacked\nthe contract, which was on the table, at the same time.  \"Don't get\nalarmed, don't get peevish, don't get panicky, don't be a wicked old\nflutterer, Ham, my boy!\" he said.  \"I've reckoned it all out, and I\nshall make a cool fifty thousand by this time next week.\"\n\n\"What will you pay for it?\" asked Hamilton, in a shaky voice.  \"I mean,\nhow much a ton?\"\n\nBones mentioned a figure, and Hamilton jotted down a note.\n\nHe had a friend, as it happened, in the jute trade--the owner of a big\nmill in Dundee--and to him he dispatched an urgent telegram.  After\nthat he examined the contract at leisure.  On the fourth page of that\ninteresting document was a paragraph, the seventh, to this effect:\n\n\"Either parties to this contract may, for any reason whatsoever, by\ngiving notice either to the Ministry of Supplies, Department 9, or to\nthe purchaser at his registered office, within twenty-four hours of the\nsigning of this contract, cancel the same.\"\n\nHe read this over to Bones.\n\n\"That's rum,\" he said.  \"What is the idea?\"\n\n\"My jolly old captain,\" said Bones in his lordly way, \"how should I\nknow?  I suppose it's in case the old Government get a better offer.\nAnyway, dear old timidity, it's a contract that I'm not going to\nterminate, believe me!\"\n\nThe next afternoon Bones and Hamilton returned from a frugal lunch at a\nnear-by tavern, and reached the imposing entrance of the building in\nwhich New Schemes Limited was housed simultaneously--or perhaps it\nwould be more truthful to say a little later--than a magnificent\nlimousine.  It was so far ahead of them that the chauffeur had time to\ndescend from his seat, open the highly-polished door, and assist to the\nhonoured sidewalk a beautiful lady in a large beaver coat, who carried\nunder her arm a small portfolio.\n\nThere was a certain swing to her shoulder as she walked, a certain\nundulatory movement of hip, which spoke of a large satisfaction with\nthe world as she found it.\n\nBones, something of a connoisseur and painfully worldly, pursed his\nlips and broke off the conversation in which he was engaged, and which\nhad to do with the prospective profits on his jute deal, and remarked\ntersely:\n\n\"Ham, dear old thing, that is a chinchilla coat worth twelve hundred\npounds.\"\n\nHamilton, to whom the mysteries of feminine attire were honest\nmysteries, accepted the sensational report without demur.\n\n\"The way you pick up these particular bits of information, Bones, is\nreally marvellous to me.  It isn't as though you go out a lot into\nsociety.  It isn't as though women are fond of you or make a fuss of\nyou.\"\n\nBones coughed.\n\n\"Dicky Orum.  Remember, dear old Richard,\" he murmured.  \"My private\nlife, dear old fellow, if you will forgive me snubbing you, is a matter\non which nobody is an authority except A. Tibbetts, Esq.  There's a lot\nyou don't know, dear old Ham.  I was thinking of writing a book about\nit, but it would take too long.\"\n\nBy this time they reached the elevator, which descended in time to\nreceive the beautiful lady in the brown coat.  Bones removed his hat,\nsmoothed his glossy hair, and with a muttered \"After you, dear old\nfriend.  Age before honesty,\" bundled Hamilton into the lift and\nfollowed him.\n\nThe elevator stopped at the third floor, and the lady got out.  Bones,\nhis curiosity overcoming his respect for age or his appreciation of\nprobity, followed her, and was thrilled to discover that she made\nstraight for his office.  She hesitated for a moment before that which\nbore the word \"Private,\" and passed on to the outer and general office.\n\nBones slipped into his own room so quickly that by the time Hamilton\nentered he was sitting at his desk in a thoughtful and studious\nattitude.\n\nIt cannot be said that the inner office was any longer entitled to the\ndescription of sanctum sanctorum.  Rather was the holy of holies the\nlarger and less ornate apartment wherein sat A Being whose capable\nlittle fingers danced over complicated banks of keys.\n\nThe communicating door opened and the Being appeared.  Hamilton,\nmindful of a certain agreement with his partner, pretended not to see\nher.\n\n\"There's a lady who wishes a private interview with you, Mr. Tibbetts,\"\nsaid the girl.\n\nBones turned with an exaggerated start.\n\n\"A lady?\" he said in a tone of incredulity.  \"Gracious Heavens!  This\nis news to me, dear old miss.  Show her in, please, show her in.  A\nprivate interview, eh?\"  He looked meaningly at Hamilton.  Hamilton did\nnot raise his eyes--in accordance with his contract.  \"A private\ninterview, eh?\" said Bones louder.  \"Does she want to see me by myself?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would like to see her in my room,\" said the girl.  \"I\ncould stay here with Mr. Hamilton.\"\n\nBones glared at the unconscious Hamilton.\n\n\"That is not necessary, dear old typewriter,\" he said stiffly.  \"Show\nthe young woman in, please.\"\n\nThe \"young woman,\" came in.  Rather, she tripped and undulated and\nswayed from the outer office to the chair facing Bones, and Bones rose\nsolemnly to greet her.\n\nMiss Marguerite Whitland, the beautiful Being, who had surveyed the\ntripping and swaying and undulating with the same frank curiosity that\nCleopatra might have devoted to a performing seal, went into her office\nand closed the door gently behind her.\n\n\"Sit down, sit down,\" said Bones.  \"And what can I do for you, young\nmiss?\"\n\nThe girl smiled.  It was one of those flashing smiles which make\nsusceptible men blink.  Bones was susceptible.  Never had he been gazed\nupon with such kindness by a pair of such large, soft, brown eyes.\nNever had cheeks dimpled so prettily and so pleasurably, and seldom had\nBones experienced such a sensation of warm embarrassment--not\nunpleasant--as he did now.\n\n\"I am sure I am being an awful nuisance to you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said the\nlady.  \"You don't know my name, do you?  Here is my card.\"  She had it\nready in her hand, and put it in front of him.  Bones waited a minute\nor two while he adjusted his monocle, and read:\n\n  \"MISS BERTHA STEGG.\"\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, he read it long before he had adjusted his\nmonocle, but the official acknowledgment was subsequent to that\nperformance.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Bones, who on such occasions as these, or on such\noccasions as remotely resembled these, was accustomed to take on the\nair and style of the strong, silent man.  \"What can we do for you, my\njolly old--Miss Stegg?\"\n\n\"It's a charity,\" blurted the girl, and sat back to watch the effect of\nher words.  \"Oh, I know what you business men are!  You simply hate\npeople bothering you for subscriptions!  And really, Mr. Tibbetts, if I\nhad to come to ask you for money, I would never have come at all.  I\nthink it's so unfair for girls to pester busy men in their offices, at\nthe busiest time of the day, with requests for subscriptions.\"\n\nBones coughed.  In truth, he had never been pestered, and was enjoying\nthe experience.\n\n\"No, this is something much more pleasant, from my point of view,\" said\nthe girl.  \"We are having a bazaar in West Kensington on behalf of the\nLittle Tots' Recreation Fund.\"\n\n\"A most excellent plan,\" said Bones firmly.\n\nHamilton, an interested audience, had occasion to marvel anew at the\namazing self-possession of his partner.\n\n\"It is one of the best institutions that I know,\" Bones went on\nthoughtfully.  \"Of course, it's many years since I was a little tot,\nbut I can still sympathise with the jolly old totters, dear young miss.\"\n\nShe had taken her portfolio from under her arm and laid it on his desk.\nIt was a pretty portfolio, bound in powder blue and silver, and was\nfastened by a powder blue tape with silver tassels.  Bones eyed it with\npardonable curiosity.\n\n\"I'm not asking you for money, Mr. Tibbetts,\" Miss Stegg went on in her\nsoft, sweet voice.  \"I think we can raise all the money we want at the\nbazaar.  But we must have things to sell.\"\n\n\"I see, dear old miss,\" said Bones eagerly.  \"You want a few old\nclothes?  I've got a couple of suits at home, rather baggy at the\nknees, dear old thing, but you know what we boys are; we wear 'em until\nthey fall off!\"\n\nThe horrified Hamilton returned to the scrutiny of his notes.\n\n\"I don't suppose under-garments, if you will permit the indelicacy, my\ndear old philanthropist----\"  Bones was going on, when the girl stopped\nhim with a gentle shake of her head.\n\n\"No, Mr. Tibbetts, it is awfully kind of you, but we do not want\nanything like that.  The way we expect to raise a lot of money is by\nselling the photographs of celebrities,\" she said.\n\n\"The photographs of celebrities?\" repeated Bones.  \"But, my dear young\nmiss, I haven't had my photograph taken for years.\"\n\nHamilton gasped.  He might have gasped again at what followed, but for\nthe fact that he had got a little beyond the gasping stage.\n\nThe girl was untying her portfolio, and now she produced something and\nlaid it on the desk before Bones.\n\n\"How clever of you to guess!\" she murmured.  \"Yes, it is a portrait of\nyou we want to sell.\"\n\nBones stared dumbfounded at a picture of himself--evidently a snapshot\ntaken with a press camera--leaving the building.  And, moreover, it was\na flattering picture, for there was a stern frown of resolution on\nBones's pictured face, which, for some esoteric reason, pleased him.\nThe picture was mounted rather in than on cardboard, for it was in a\nsunken mount, and beneath the portrait was a little oblong slip of pale\nblue paper.\n\nBones gazed and glowed.  Neatly printed above the picture were the\nwords: \"Our Captains of Industry.  III.--Augustus Tibbetts, Esq.\n(Schemes Limited).\"\n\nBones read this with immense satisfaction.  He wondered who were the\ntwo men who could be placed before him, but in his generous mood was\nprepared to admit that he might come third in the list of London's\nmerchant princes.\n\n\"Deuced flattering, dear old thing,\" he murmured.  \"Hamilton, old boy,\ncome and look at this.\"\n\nHamilton crossed to the desk, saw, and wondered.\n\n\"Not so bad,\" said Bones, dropping his head to one side and regarding\nthe picture critically.  \"Not at all bad, dear old thing.  You've seen\nme in that mood, I think, old Ham.\"\n\n\"What is the mood?\" said Hamilton innocently.  \"Indigestion?\"\n\nThe girl laughed.\n\n\"Let's have a little light on the subject,\" said Bones.  \"Switch on the\nexpensive old electricity, Ham.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the girl quickly.  \"I don't think so.  If you saw the\npicture under the light, you'd probably think it wasn't good enough,\nand then I should have made my journey in vain.  Spare me that, Mr.\nTibbetts!\"\n\nMr. Tibbetts giggled.  At that moment the Being re-appeared.\nMarguerite Whitland, chief and only stenographer to the firm of Schemes\nLimited, and Bones beckoned her.\n\n\"Just cast your eye over this, young miss,\" he said.  \"What do you\nthink of it?\"\n\nThe girl came round the group, looked at the picture, and nodded.\n\n\"Very nice,\" she said, and then she looked at the girl.\n\n\"Selling it for a charity,\" said Bones carelessly.  \"Some silly old\njosser will put it up in his drawing-room, I suppose.  You know, Ham,\ndear old thing, I never can understand this hero-worship business.  And\nnow, my young and philanthropic collector, what do you want me to do?\nGive you permission?  It is given.\"\n\n\"I want you to give me your autograph.  Sign down there,\"--she pointed\nto a little space beneath the picture--\"and just let me sell it for\nwhat I can get.\"\n\n\"With all the pleasure in life,\" said Bones.\n\nHe picked up his long plumed pen and splashed his characteristic\nsignature in the space indicated.\n\nAnd then Miss Marguerite Whitland did a serious thing, an amazingly\naudacious thing, a thing which filled Bones's heart with horror and\ndismay.\n\nBefore Bones could lift the blotting pad, her forefinger had dropped\nupon the signature and had been drawn across, leaving nothing more than\nan indecipherable smudge.\n\n\"My dear old typewriter!\" gasped Bones.  \"My dear old miss!  Confound\nit all!  Hang it all, I say!  Dear old thing!\"\n\n\"You can leave this picture, madam----\"\n\n\"Miss,\" murmured Bones from force of habit.  Even in his agitation he\ncould not resist the temptation to interrupt.\n\n\"You can leave this picture, Miss Stegg,\" said the girl coolly.  \"Mr.\nTibbetts wants to add it to his collection.\"\n\nMiss Stegg said nothing.\n\nShe had risen to her feet, her eyes fixed on the girl's face, and, with\nno word of protest or explanation, she turned and walked swiftly from\nthe office.  Hamilton opened the door, noting the temporary suspension\nof the undulatory motion.\n\nWhen she had gone, they looked at one another, or, rather, they looked\nat the girl, who, for her part, was examining the photograph.  She took\na little knife from the desk before Bones and inserted it into the\nthick cardboard mount, and ripped off one of the layers of cardboard.\nAnd so Bones's photograph was exposed, shorn of all mounting.  But,\nwhat was more important, beneath his photograph was a cheque on the\nThird National Bank, which was a blank cheque and bearing Bones's\nundeniable signature in the bottom right-hand corner--the signature was\ndecipherable through the smudge.\n\nBones stared.\n\n\"Most curious thing I've ever seen in my life, dear old typewriter,\" he\nsaid.  \"Why, that's the very banking establishment I patronise.\"\n\n\"I thought it might be,\" said the girl.\n\nAnd then it dawned upon Bones, and he gasped.\n\n\"Great Moses!\" he howled--there is no prettier word for it.  \"That\nnaughty, naughty, Miss Thing-a-me-jig was making me sign a blank\ncheque!  My autograph!  My sacred aunt!  Autograph on a cheque...\"\n\nBones babbled on as the real villainy of the attempt upon his finances\ngradually unfolded before his excited vision.\n\nExplanations were to follow.  The girl had seen a paragraph warning\npeople against giving their autographs, and the police had even\ncirculated a rough description of two \"well-dressed women\" who, on one\npretext or another, were securing from the wealthy, but the unwise,\nspecimens of their signatures.\n\n\"My young and artful typewriter,\" said Bones, speaking with emotion,\n\"you have probably saved me from utter ruin, dear old thing.  Goodness\nonly knows what might have happened, or where I might have been\nsleeping to-night, my jolly old Salvationist, if your beady little eye\nhadn't penetrated like a corkscrew through the back of that naughty old\nlady's neck and read her evil intentions.\"\n\n\"I don't think it was a matter of my beady eye,\" said the girl, without\nany great enthusiasm for the description, \"as my memory.\"\n\n\"I can't understand it,\" said Bones, puzzled.  \"She came in a beautiful\ncar----\"\n\n\"Hired for two hours for twenty-five shillings,\" said the girl.\n\n\"But she was so beautifully dressed.  She had a chinchilla coat----\"\n\n\"Imitation beaver,\" said Miss Marguerite Whitland, who had few\nillusions.  \"You can get them for fifteen pounds at any of the West End\nshops.\"\n\nIt was a very angry Miss Bertha Stegg who made her way in some haste to\nPimlico.  She shared a first-floor suite with a sister, and she burst\nunceremoniously into her relative's presence, and the elder Miss Stegg\nlooked round with some evidence of alarm.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked.\n\nShe was a tall, bony woman, with a hard, tired face, and lacked most of\nher sister's facial charm.\n\n\"Turned down,\" said Bertha briefly.  \"I had the thing signed, and then\na----\" (one omits the description she gave of Miss Marguerite Whitland,\nwhich was uncharitable) \"smudged the thing with her fingers.\"\n\n\"She tumbled to it, eh?\" said Clara.  \"Has she put the splits on you?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't think so,\" said Bertha, throwing off her coat and her hat,\nand patting her hair.  \"I got away too quickly, and I came on by the\ncar.\"\n\n\"Will he report it to the police?\"\n\n\"He's not that kind.  Doesn't it make you mad, Clara, to think that\nthat fool has a million to spend?  Do you know what he's done?  Made\nperhaps a hundred thousand pounds in a couple of days!  Wouldn't that\nrile you?\"\n\nThey discussed Bones in terms equally unflattering.  They likened Bones\nto all representatives of the animal world whose characteristics are\nextreme foolishness, but at last they came into a saner, calmer frame\nof mind.\n\nMiss Clara Stegg seated herself on the frowsy sofa--indispensable to a\nPimlico furnished flat--and, with her elbow on one palm and her chin on\nanother, reviewed the situation.  She was the brains of a little\ncombination which had done so much to distress and annoy susceptible\nfinanciers in the City of London.  (The record of the Stegg sisters may\nbe read by the curious, or, at any rate, by as many of the curious as\nhave the _entr\u00e9e_ to the Record Department of Scotland Yard.)\n\nThe Steggs specialised in finance, and operated exclusively in high\nfinancial circles.  There was not a fluctuation of the market which\nMiss Clara Stegg did not note; and when Rubber soared sky-high, or\nSteel Preferred sagged listlessly, she knew just who was going to be\naffected, and just how approachable they were.\n\nDuring the War the Stegg sisters had opened a new department, so to\nspeak, dealing with Government contracts, and the things which they\nknew about the incomes of Government contractors the average surveyor\nof taxes would have given money to learn.\n\n\"It was my mistake, Bertha,\" she said at last, \"though in a sense it\nwasn't.  I tried him simply, because he's simple.  If you work\nsomething complicated on a fellow like that, you're pretty certain to\nget him guessing.\"\n\nShe went out of the room, and presently returned with four ordinary\nexercise-books, one of which she opened at a place where a page was\ncovered with fine writing, and that facing was concealed by a sheet of\nletter-paper which had been pasted on to it.  The letter-paper bore the\nembossed heading of Schemes Limited, the epistle had reference to a\nrequest for an autograph which Bones had most graciously granted.\n\nThe elder woman looked at the signature, biting her nether lip.\n\n\"It is almost too late now.  What is the time?\" she asked.\n\n\"Half-past three,\" replied her sister.\n\nMiss Stegg shook her head.\n\n\"The banks are closed, and, anyway----\"\n\nShe carried the book to a table, took a sheet of paper and a pen, and,\nafter a close study of Bones's signature, she wrote it, at first\nawkwardly, then, after about a dozen attempts, she produced a copy\nwhich it was difficult to tell apart from the original.\n\n\"Really, Clara, you're a wonder,\" said her sister admiringly.\n\nClara made no reply.  She sat biting the end of the pen.\n\n\"I hate the idea of getting out of London and leaving him with all that\nmoney, Bertha,\" she said.  \"I wonder----\"  She turned to her sister.\n\"Go out and get all the evening newspapers,\" she said.  \"There's bound\nto be something about him, and I might get an idea.\"\n\nThere was much about Bones in the papers the younger girl brought, and\nin one of these journals there was quite an important interview, which\ngave a sketch of Bones's life, his character, and his general\nappearance.  Clara read this interview very carefully.\n\n\"It says he's spent a million, but I know that's a lie,\" she said.\n\"I've been watching that jute deal for a long time, and it's nearer\nhalf the sum.\"  She frowned.  \"I wonder----\" she said.\n\n\"Wonder what?\" asked the younger girl impatiently.  \"What's the good of\nwondering?  The only thing we can do is to clear out.\"\n\nAgain Clara went from the room and came back with an armful of\ndocuments.  These she laid on the table, and the girl, looking down,\nsaw that they were for the main part blank contracts.  Clara turned\nthem over and over until at last she came to one headed \"Ministry of\nSupplies.\"\n\n\"This'd be the form,\" she said.  \"It is the same that Stevenhowe had.\"\n\nShe was mentioning the name of a middle-aged man, who, quite\nunwittingly and most unwillingly, had contributed to her very handsome\nbank balance.  She scanned the clauses through, and then flung down the\ncontract in disgust.\n\n\"There's nothing mentioned about a deposit,\" she said, \"and, anyway, I\ndoubt very much whether I could get it back, even on his signature.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour later Miss Clara Stegg took up the contract again\nand read the closely-printed clauses very carefully.  When she had\nfinished she said:\n\n\"I just hate the idea of that fellow making money.\"\n\n\"You've said that before,\" said her sister tartly.\n\nAt six o'clock that evening Bones went home.  At nine o'clock he was\nsitting in his sitting-room in Clarges Street--a wonderful place,\nthough small, of Eastern hangings and subdued lights--when Hamilton\nburst in upon him; and Bones hastily concealed the poem he was writing\nand thrust it under his blotting-pad.  It was a good poem and going\nwell.\n\nIt began:\n\n  How very sweet\n  Is Marguerite!\n\nAnd Bones was, not unreasonably, annoyed at this interruption to his\nmuse.\n\nAs to Hamilton, he was looking ill.\n\n\"Bones,\" said Hamilton quietly, \"I've had a telegram from my pal in\nDundee.  Shall I read it?\"\n\n\"Dear old thing,\" said Bones, with an irritated \"tut-tut,\" \"really,\ndear old creature, at this time of night--your friends in\nDundee--really, my dear old boy----\"\n\n\"Shall I read it?\" said Hamilton, with sinister calm.\n\n\"By all means, by all means,\" said Bones, waving an airy hand and\nsitting back with resignation written on every line of his countenance.\n\n\"Here it is,\" said Hamilton.  \"It begins 'Urgent.'\"\n\n\"That means he's in a devil of a hurry, old thing,\" said Bones, nodding.\n\n\"And it goes on to say,\" said Hamilton, ignoring the interruption.\n\"'Your purchase at the present price of jute is disastrous.  Jute will\nnever again touch the figure at which your friend tendered, Ministry\nhave been trying to find a mug for years to buy their jute, half of\nwhich is spoilt by bad warehousing, as I could have told you, and I\nreckon you have made a loss of exactly half the amount you have paid.'\"\n\nBones had opened his eyes and was sitting up.\n\n\"Dear old Job's comforter,\" he said huskily.\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" said Hamilton, \"I haven't finished yet,\" and went on:\n\"'Strongly advise you cancel your sale in terms of Clause 7 Ministry\ncontract.'  That's all,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Bones feebly, as he ran his finger inside his collar,\n\"that's all!\"\n\n\"What do you think, Bones?\" said Hamilton gently.\n\n\"Well, dear old cloud on the horizon,\" said Bones, clasping his bony\nknee, \"it looks remarkably like serious trouble for B. Ones, Esquire.\nIt does indeed.  Of course,\" he said, \"you're not in this, old Ham.\nThis was a private speculation----\"\n\n\"Rot!\" said Hamilton contemptuously.  \"You're never going to try a\ndirty trick like that on me?  Of course I'm in it.  If you're in it,\nI'm in it.\"\n\nBones opened his mouth to protest, but subsided feebly.  He looked at\nthe clock, sighed, and lowered his eyes again.\n\n\"I suppose it's too late to cancel the contract now?\"\n\nBones nodded.\n\n\"Twenty-four hours, poor old victim,\" he said miserably, \"expired at\nfive p.m.\"\n\n\"So that's that,\" said Hamilton.\n\nWalking across, he tapped his partner on the shoulder.\n\n\"Well, Bones, it can't be helped, and probably our pal in Dundee has\ntaken an extravagant view.\"\n\n\"Not he,\" said Bones, \"not he, dear old cheerer.  Well, we shall have\nto cut down expenses, move into a little office, and start again, dear\nold Hamilton.\"\n\n\"It won't be so bad as that.\"\n\n\"Not quite so bad as that,\" admitted Bones.  \"But one thing,\" he said\nwith sudden energy, \"one thing, dear old thing, I'll never part with.\nWhatever happens, dear old boy, rain or shine, sun or moon, stars or\nany old thing like that\"--he was growing incoherent--\"I will never\nleave my typewriter, dear old thing.  I will never desert her--never,\nnever, never, never, never!\n\nHe turned up in the morning, looking and speaking chirpily.  Hamilton,\nwho had spent a restless night, thought he detected signs of similar\nrestlessness in Bones.\n\nMiss Marguerite Whitland brought him his letters, and he went over them\nlistlessly until he came to one large envelope which bore on its flap\nthe all-too-familiar seal of the Ministry.  Bones looked at it and made\na little face.\n\n\"It's from the Ministry,\" said the girl.\n\nBones nodded.\n\n\"Yes, my old notetaker,\" he said, \"my poor young derelict, cast\nout\"--his voice shook--\"through the rapacious and naughty old\nspeculations of one who should have protected your jolly old interests,\nit is from the Ministry.\"\n\n\"Aren't you going to open it?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, dear young typewriter, I am not,\" Bones said firmly.  \"It's all\nabout the beastly jute, telling me to take it away.  Now, where the\ndickens am I going to put it, eh?  Never talk to me about jute,\" he\nsaid violently.  \"If I saw a jute tree at this moment, I'd simply hate\nthe sight of it!\"\n\nShe looked at him in astonishment.\n\n\"Why, whatever's wrong?\" she asked anxiously.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Bones.  \"Nothing,\" he added brokenly.  \"Oh, nothing,\ndear young typewriting person.\"\n\nShe paused irresolutely, then picked up the envelope and cut open the\nflap.\n\nRemember that she knew nothing, except that Bones had made a big\npurchase, and that she was perfectly confident--such was her sublime\nfaith in Augustus Tibbetts--that he would make a lot of money as a\nresult of that purchase.\n\nTherefore the consternation on her face as she read its contents.\n\n\"Why,\" she stammered, \"you've never done----  Whatever made you do\nthat?\"\n\n\"Do what?\" said Bones hollowly.  \"What made me do it?  Greed, dear old\nsister, just wicked, naughty greed.\"\n\n\"But I thought,\" she said, bewildered, \"You were going to make so much\nout of this deal?\"\n\n\"Ha, ha,\" said Bones without mirth.\n\n\"But weren't you?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said Bones gently.\n\n\"Oh!  So that was why you cancelled the contract?\"\n\nHamilton jumped to his feet.\n\n\"Cancelled the contract?\" he said incredulously.\n\n\"Cancelled the contract?\" squeaked Bones.  \"What a naughty old\nstory-teller you are!\"\n\n\"But you have,\" said the girl.  \"Here's a note from the Ministry,\nregretting that you should have changed your mind and taken advantage\nof Clause Seven.  The contract was cancelled at four forty-nine.\"\n\nBones swallowed something.\n\n\"This is spiritualism,\" he said solemnly.  \"I'll never say a word\nagainst jolly old Brigham Young after this!\"\n\nIn the meantime two ladies who had arrived in Paris, somewhat weary and\nbedraggled, were taking their morning coffee outside the Caf\u00e9 de la\nPaix.\n\n\"Anyway, my dear,\" said Clara viciously, in answer to her sister's\nplaint, \"we've given that young devil a bit of trouble.  Perhaps they\nwon't renew the contract, and anyway, it'll take a bit of proving that\nhe did not sign that cancellation I handed in.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, Bones never attempted to prove it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nDETECTIVE BONES\n\nMr. Harold de Vinne was a large man, who dwelt at the dead end of a\nmassive cigar.\n\nHe was big and broad-shouldered, and automatically jovial.  Between the\nhours of 6 p.m. and 2 a.m. he had earned the name of \"good fellow,\"\nwhich reputation he did his best to destroy between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.\n\nHe was one of four stout fellows who controlled companies of imposing\nstability--the kind of companies that have such items in their balance\nsheets as \"Sundry Debtors, \u00a3107,402 12_s_. 7_d_.\"  People feel, on\nreading such airy lines, that the company's assets are of such\nmagnitude that the sundry debtors are only included as a careless\nafterthought.\n\nMr. de Vinne was so rich that he looked upon any money which wasn't his\nas an illegal possession; and when Mr. Augustus Tibbetts, on an\noccasion, stepped in and robbed him of \u00a317,500, Mr. de Vinne's family\ndoctor was hastily summoned (figuratively speaking; literally, he had\nno family, and swore by certain patent medicines), and straw was spread\nbefore the temple of his mind.\n\nA certain Captain Hamilton, late of H.M. Houssas, but now a partner in\nthe firm of Tibbetts & Hamilton, Ltd., after a short, sharp bout of\nmalaria, went off to Brighton to recuperate, and to get the whizzy\nnoises out of his head.  To him arrived on a morning a special courier\nin the shape of one Ali, an indubitable Karo boy, but reputedly pure\nArab, and a _haj_, moreover, entitled to the green scarf of the\nveritable pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nAli was the body-servant of Augustus Tibbetts, called by his intimates\n\"Bones,\" and he was arrayed in the costume which restaurateurs insist\nis the everyday kit of a true Easterner--especially such Easterners as\nserve after-dinner coffee.\n\nHamilton, not in the best of tempers--malaria leaves you that way--and\ndazzled by this apparition in scarlet and gold, blinked.\n\n\"O man,\" he said testily in the Arabic of the Coast, \"why do you\nwalk-in-the world dressed like a so-and-so?\"  (You can be very rude in\nArabic especially in Coast Arabic garnished with certain Swahili\nphrases.)\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali, \"these garmentures are expressly designated by\nTibbetti.  Embellishments of oriferous metal give wealthiness of\nappearance to subject, but attract juvenile research and investigation.\"\n\nHamilton glared through the window on to the front, where a small but\nrepresentative gathering of the juvenile research committee waited\npatiently for the reappearance of one whom in their romantic fashion\nthey had termed \"The Rajah of Bong.\"\n\nHamilton took the letter and opened it.  It was, of course, from Bones,\nand was extremely urgent.  Thus it went:\n\n\n\"DEAR OLD PART.,--Ham I've had an offer of Browns you know the big big\nBoot shop several boot shop all over London London.  Old Browns going\nout going out of the bisiness Sindicate trying to buy so I niped in for\n105,000 pounds got lock stock and barrill baril.  Sindicate awfuly sore\nawfuley sore.  All well here except poor young typewrighter cut her\nfinger finger sliceing bread doctor says not dangerus.\"\n\n\nHamilton breathed quickly.  He gathered that Bones had bought a\nboot-shop--even a collection of boot-shops--and he was conscious of the\nhorrible fact that Bones knew nothing about boots.\n\nHe groaned.  He was always groaning, he thought, and seldom with good\nreason.\n\nBones was in a buying mood.  A week before he had bought _The Weekly\nSunspot_, which was \"A Satirical Weekly Review of Human Affairs.\"  The\npossibilities of that purchase had made Hamilton go hot and moisty.  He\nhad gone home one evening, leaving Bones dictating a leading article\nwhich was a violent attack on the Government of the day, and had come\nin the following morning to discover that the paper had been resold at\na thousand pounds profit to the owners of a rival journal which\ndescribed itself as \"A Weekly Symposium of Thought and Fancy.\"\n\nBut Boots ... and \u00a3105,000 ...!\n\nThis was serious.  Yet there was no occasion for groaning or doubt or\napprehension; for, even whilst Hamilton was reading the letter, Bones\nwas shaking his head violently at Mr. de Vinne, of the Phit-Phine Shoe\nSyndicate, who had offered him \u00a315,000 profit on the turn-over.  And at\nthe identical moment that Hamilton was buying his ticket for London,\nBones was solemnly shaking hands with the Secretary of the Phit-Phine\nShoe Syndicate (Mr. de Vinne having violently, even apoplectically,\nrefused to meet Bones) with one hand, and holding in the other a cheque\nwhich represented a profit of \u00a317,500.  It was one of Bones's big\ndeals, and reduced Hamilton to a condition of blind confidence in his\npartner....  Nevertheless....\n\nA week later, Bones, reading his morning paper, reached and passed,\nwithout receiving any very violent impression, the information that Mr.\nJohn Siker, the well-known private detective, had died at his residence\nat Clapham Park.  Bones read the item without interest.  He was looking\nfor bargains--an early morning practice of his because the buying fever\nwas still upon him.\n\nHamilton, sitting at his desk, endeavouring to balance the firm's\naccounts from a paying-in book and a cheque-book, the counterfoils of\nwhich were only occasionally filled in, heard the staccato \"Swindle!\n...  Swindle!\" and knew that Bones had reached the pages whereon were\ndisplayed the prospectuses of new companies.\n\nHe had the firm conviction that all new companies were founded on\nfrauds and floated by criminals.  The offer of seven per cent.\ndebenture stock moved him to sardonic laughter.  The certificates of\neminent chartered accountants brought a meaning little smile to his\nlips, followed by the perfectly libellous statement that \"These people\nwould do anything for money, dear old thing.\"\n\nPresently Bones threw down the paper.\n\n\"Nothing, absolutely nothing,\" he said, and walked to the door of the\nouter office, knocked upon it, and disappeared into the sanctum of the\nlady whom Bones never referred to except in terms of the deepest\nrespect as his \"young typewriter!\"\n\n\"Young miss,\" he said, pausing deferentially at the door, \"may I come\nin?\"\n\nShe smiled up at him--a proceeding which was generally sufficient to\nthrow Bones into a pitiful condition of incoherence.  But this morning\nit had only the effect of making him close his eyes as though to shut\nout a vision too radiant to be borne.\n\n\"Aren't you well, Mr. Tibbetts?\" she asked quickly and anxiously.\n\n\"It's nothing, dear old miss,\" said Bones, passing a weary and\nhypocritical hand across his brow.  \"Just a fit of the jolly old\nstaggers.  The fact is, I've been keeping late hours--in fact, dear\nyoung miss,\" he said huskily, \"I have been engaged in a wicked old\npursuit--yes, positively naughty....\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Tibbetts\"--she was truly shocked--\"I'm awfully sorry!  You\nreally shouldn't drink--you're so young....\"\n\n\"Drink!\" said the hurt and astounded Bones.  \"Dear old slanderer!\nPoetry!\"\n\nHe had written sufficient poetry to make a volume--poems which abounded\nin such rhymes as \"Marguerite,\" \"Dainty feet,\" \"Sweet,\" \"Hard to beat,\"\nand the like.  But this she did not know.\n\nBy this time the girl was not only accustomed to these periodical\nembarrassments of Bones, but had acquired the knack of switching the\nconversation to the main line of business.\n\n\"There's a letter from Mr. de Vinne,\" she said.\n\nBones rubbed his nose and said, \"Oh!\"\n\nMr. de Vinne was on his mind rather than on his conscience, for Mr. de\nVinne was very angry with Bones, who, as he had said, had \"niped\" in\nand had cost Mr. de Vinne \u00a317,500.\n\n\"It is not a nice letter,\" suggested the girl.\n\n\"Let me see, dear young head-turner,\" said Bones firmly.\n\nThe letter called him \"Sir,\" and went on to speak of the writer's years\nof experience as a merchant of the City of London, in all of which,\nsaid the writer, he had never heard of conduct approaching in infamy\nthat of Augustus Tibbetts, Esquire.\n\n\n\"It has been brought to my recollection\" (wrote the infuriated Mr. de\nVinne) \"that on the day you made your purchase of Browns, I dined at\nthe Kingsway Restaurant, and that you occupied a table immediately\nbehind me.  I can only suppose that you overheard a _perfectly\nconfidential_\" (heavily underscored) \"conversation between myself and a\nfellow-director, and utilised the information thus _disgracefully_\nacquired.\"\n\n\n\"Never talk at meals, dear old typewriter,\" murmured Bones.  \"Awfully\nbad for your jolly young tum--for your indigestion, dear young\nkeytapper.\"\n\nThe letter went on to express the writer's intention of taking\nvengeance for the \"dishonest squeeze\" of which he had been the victim.\n\nBones looked at his secretary anxiously.  The censure of Mr. de Vinne\naffected him not at all.  The possible disapproval of this lady filled\nhim with dire apprehension.\n\n\"It's not a nice letter,\" said the girl.  \"Do you want me to answer it?\"\n\n\"Do I want you to answer it?\" repeated Bones, taking courage.  \"Of\ncourse I want you to answer it, my dear old paper-stainer and\ndecorator.  Take these words.\"\n\nHe paced the room with a terrible frown.\n\n\"Dear old thing,\" he began.\n\n\"Do you want me to say 'Dear old thing'?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"No, perhaps not, perhaps not,\" said Bones.  \"Start it like this: 'My\ndear peevish one----\"\n\nThe girl hesitated and then wrote down: \"Dear Sir.\"\n\n\"'You are just showing your naughty temper,'\" dictated Bones, and added\nunnecessarily, \"t-e-m-p-e-r.\"\n\nIt was a practice of his to spell simple words.\n\n\"You are just showing your naughty temper,\" he went on, \"and I simply\nrefuse to have anything more to do with you.  You're being simply\ndisgusting.  Need I say more?\" added Bones.\n\nThe girl wrote: \"Dear Sir,--No useful purpose would be served either in\nreplying to your letter of to-day's date, or re-opening the discussion\non the circumstances of which you complain.\"\n\nBones went back to his office feeling better.  Hamilton left early that\nafternoon, so that when, just after the girl had said \"Good night,\" and\nBones himself was yawning over an evening paper, and there came a rap\nat the door of the outer office, he was quite alone.\n\n\"Come in!\" he yelled, and a young man, dressed in deep mourning,\neventually appeared through the door sacred to the use of Miss\nMarguerite Whitland.\n\n\"I'm afraid I've come rather late in the day.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you have, dear old thing,\" said Bones.  \"Come and sit down,\nblack one.  Deepest sympathy and all that sort of thing.\"\n\nThe young man licked his lips.  His age was about twenty-four, and he\nhad the appearance of being a semi-invalid, as, indeed, he was.\n\n\"It's rather late to see you on this matter,\" he said, \"but your name\nwas only suggested to me about an hour ago.\"\n\nBones nodded.  Remember that he was always prepared for a miracle, even\nat closing time.\n\n\"My name is Siker,\" said the visitor.\n\n\"And a jolly good name, too,\" said Bones, dimly conscious of the fact\nthat he had heard this name mentioned before.\n\n\"You probably saw the account of my father's death.  It was in this\nmorning's newspaper, though he died last week,\" said Mr. Siker.\n\nBones screwed up his forehead.\n\n\"I remember that name,\" he said.  \"Now, let me think.  Why, of\ncourse--Siker's Detective Agency.\"\n\nIt was the young man's turn to nod.\n\n\"That's right, sir,\" he said.  \"John Siker was my father.  I'm his only\nson.\"\n\nBones waited.\n\n\"I've heard it said, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said the young man--\"at least, it\nhas been represented to me--that you are on the look-out for likely\nbusinesses that show a profit.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" agreed Bones; \"that show me a big profit,\" he added.\n\n\"Well, Siker's Detective Agency has made two thousand a year clear for\ntwenty years,\" said the young man.  \"We've got one of the best lists of\nclients in the kingdom, and almost every big business man in the City\nis on our list.  With a little more attention than my father has been\nable to give to it for the last two years, there's a fortune in it.\"\n\nBones was sitting upright now, his eyes shining.  The amazing\npossibilities of such an acquisition were visible to his romantic eye.\n\n\"You want to sell it, my poor old Sherlock?\" he demanded, then,\nremembering the part he was called upon to play, shook his head.  \"No,\nno, old thing.  Deeply sorry and all that sort of thing, but it can't\nbe done.  It's not my line of business at all--not,\" he added, \"that I\ndon't know a jolly sight more about detectivising than a good many of\nthese clever ones.  But it's really not my game.  What did you want for\nit?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the young man, hesitating, \"I thought that three years'\npurchase would be a bargain for the man who bought it.\"\n\n\"Six thousand pounds,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed the other.  \"Of course, I won't ask you to buy the thing\nblindfolded.  You can put the accounts in the hands of your lawyer or\nyour accountant, and you will find that what I have said is true--that\nmy father took two thousand a year out of his business for years.  It's\npossible to make it four thousand.  And as to running it, there are\nthree men who do all the work--or, rather, one, Hilton, who's in charge\nof the office and gives the other fellows their instructions.\"\n\n\"But why sell it, my sad old improvidence?\" said Bones.  \"Why chuck\naway two thousand a year for six thousand cash?\"\n\n\"Because I'm not well enough to carry it on,\" said young Mr. Siker,\nafter a moment's hesitation.  \"And, besides, I can't be bothered.  It\ninterferes, with my other profession--I'm a musician.\"\n\n\"And a jolly good profession, too,\" said Bones, shaking hands with him\nacross the table.  \"I'll sleep on this.  Give me your address and the\naddress of your accountants, and I'll come over and see you in the\nmorning.\"\n\nHamilton was at his desk the next morning at ten o'clock.  Bones did\nnot arrive until eleven, and Bones was monstrously preoccupied.  When\nHamilton saluted him with a cheery \"Good morning,\" Bones returned a\ngrave and non-committal nod.  Hamilton went on with his work until he\nbecame conscious that somebody was staring at him, and, looking up,\ncaught Bones in the act.\n\n\"What the devil are you looking at?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"At your boots,\" was the surprising reply.\n\n\"My boots?\"  Hamilton pulled them back through the kneehole of the desk\nand looked at them.  \"What's the matter with the boots?\"\n\n\"Mud-stains, old carelessness,\" said Bones tersely.  \"You've come from\nTwickenham this morning.\"\n\n\"Of course I've come from Twickenham.  That's where I live,\" said\nHamilton innocently.  \"I thought you knew that.\"\n\n\"I should have known it,\" said Bones, with great gravity, \"even if I\nhadn't known it, so to speak.  You may have observed, my dear Hamilton,\nthat the jolly old mud of London differs widely--that is to say, is\nremarkably different.  For instance, the mud of Twickenham is different\nfrom the mud of Balham.  There's what you might call a subtle\ndifference, dear junior partner, which an unimaginative old rascal like\nyou wouldn't notice.  Now, the mud of Peckham,\" said Bones, waving his\nforefinger, \"is distinguished by a certain darkness----\"\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" said Hamilton.  \"Have you bought a mud business or\nsomething?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bones.\n\n\"And yet this conversation seems familiar to me,\" mused Hamilton.\n\"Proceed with your argument, good gossip.\"\n\n\"My argument,\" said Bones, \"is that you have Twickenham mud on your\nboots, therefore you come from Twickenham.  It is evident that on your\nway to the station you stopped to buy a newspaper, that something was\non your mind, something made you very thoughtful--something on your\njolly old conscience, I'll bet!\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"There's your _Times_ on the table,\" said Bones triumphantly,\n\"unopened.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" said Hamilton; \"I bought it just before I came into the\noffice.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said Bones.  \"Well, I won't deceive you, dear old partner.  I've\nbought Siker's.\"\n\nHamilton put down his pen and leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"Who's Siker's?\"\n\n\"Siker's Detective Agency,\" began Bones, \"is known from one end----\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.  Whew!\" whistled Hamilton.  \"You were doing a bit of\ndetecting!\"\n\nBones smirked.\n\n\"Got it at once, my dear old person,\" he said.  \"You know my\nmethods----\"\n\nHamilton's accusing eye met his, and Bones coughed.\n\n\"But what on earth do you expect to do with a detective agency, Bones?\"\nasked Hamilton, strolling across and lighting a cigarette.  \"That's a\ntype of business there isn't any big demand for.  And how is it going\nto affect you personally?  You don't want your name associated with\nthat sort of thing.\"\n\nBones explained.  It was a property he could \"sit on.\"  Bones had\nalways been looking for such a business.  The management was capable of\ncarrying on, and all that Bones need do was to sit tight and draw a\ndividend.\n\nAs to his name, he had found a cunning solution to that difficulty.\n\n\"I take it over, by arrangement with the lawyer in the name of 'Mr.\nSenob,' and I'll bet you won't guess, dear old Ham, how I got that\nname!\"\n\n\"It's 'Bones' spelt backwards,\" said Hamilton patiently.  \"You tried\nthat bit of camouflage on me years ago.\"\n\nBones sniffed disappointedly and went on.\n\nFor once he was logical, brief in his explanation, and convincing.  Yet\nHamilton was not altogether convinced.  He was waiting for the\ninevitable \"but,\" and presently it came.\n\n\"But of course I'm not going to leave it entirely alone, old Ham,\" said\nBones, shrugging his shoulders at the absurdity of such a suggestion.\n\"The business can be doubled if a man with a capable, up-to-date\nconception of modern crime----\"\n\nHamilton made a hooting noise, derisive and insulting.\n\n\"Meaning you?\" he said, at the conclusion of his lamentable exhibition.\n\n\"Meaning me, Ham, my fat old sceptic,\" said Bones gently.  \"I don't\nthink, dear old officer, you quite realise just what I know about\ncriminal investigation.\"\n\n\"You silly ass,\" said Hamilton, \"detective agencies don't criminally\ninvestigate.  That's done by the real police.  Detective agencies are\nmerely employed by suspicious wives to follow their husbands.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Bones, nodding.  \"And that is just where I come in.\nYou see, I did a little bit of work last night--rather a pretty little\nbit of work.\"  He took a slip of paper from his pocket.  \"You dined at\nthe Criterion at half-past eight with a tall, fair lady--a jolly old\ndear she was too, old boy, and I congratulate you most heartily--named\nVera.\"\n\nHamilton's face went red.\n\n\"You left the restaurant at ten past nine, and entered cab No. 667432.\nAm I right, sir?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me,\" exploded Hamilton, \"that you were watching\nme?\"\n\nBones nodded.\n\n\"I picked you up, old thing, outside the Piccadilly Tube.  I shadowed\nyou to the theatre.  I followed you home.  You got a taxi--No.\n297431--and you were an awful long time before you got out when you\nreached the lady's destination--an awful long time,\" said Bones\nemphatically.  \"What you could find to talk about after the cab had\ndrawn up at the dear old ancestral home of Vera----\"\n\n\"Bones,\" said Hamilton awfully.  \"I think you've gone far enough.\"\n\n\"I thought you'd gone a bit too far, dear old thing, I did really,\"\nsaid Bones, shaking his head reprovingly.  \"I watched you very\ncarefully.\"\n\nHe danced, with a little squeak of joy, into the office of his\nbeautiful secretary, leaving a very red and a pardonably annoyed\nHamilton breathing heavily.\n\nBones went to the office of Siker's Detective Agency early the next\nmorning.  He went, it may be remarked in passing, though these details\ncan only be interesting to the psychologist, wearing the darkest of his\ndark suits and a large black wideawake hat.  There was a certain\nfurtiveness in his movements between the taxicab and the entrance of\nthe office, which might suggest to anybody who had taken the trouble to\nobserve him that he was an escaping bank-robber.\n\nSiker's had spacious offices and a small staff.  Only Hilton, the\nmanager, and a clerk were in when Bones presented his card.  He was\nimmediately conducted by Mr. Hilton to a very plain inner office,\nsurrounded with narrow shelves, which in turn were occupied by\ninnumerable little deed boxes.\n\nMr. Hilton was a sober-faced man of fifty-five, sallow and unhappy.\nHis tone was funereal and deliberate, his eyes steady and remorseless.\n\n\"Sit down, Mr. Senob,\" he said hollowly.  \"I have a message from the\nlawyers, and I presume I am welcoming to this establishment the new\nproprietor who has taken the place of my revered chief, whom I have\nfaithfully served for twenty-nine years.\"\n\nBones closed his eyes and listened as to an address of welcome.\n\n\"Personally,\" said Mr. Hilton, \"I think that the sale of this business\nis a great mistake on the part of the Siker family.  The Sikers have\nbeen detectives for four generations,\" he said with a relish of an\nantiquarian.  \"George Siker first started work as an investigator in\n1814 in this identical building.  For thirty-five years he conducted\nSiker's Confidential Bureau, and was succeeded by his son James the\ngrandfather of the late John George for twenty-three years----\"\n\n\"Quite so, quite so,\" said Bones.  \"Poor old George!  Well, well, we\ncan't live for ever, dear old chief of staff.  Now, the thing is, how\nto improve this jolly old business.\"\n\nHe looked around the dingy apartment without enthusiasm.\n\nBones had visitors that morning, many visitors.  They were not, as he\nhad anticipated, veiled ladies or cloaked dukes, nor did they pour into\nhis discreet ears the stories of misspent lives.\n\nThere was Mr. Carlo Borker, of Borker's Confidential Enquiry Bureau, a\ngross man in a top hat, who complained bitterly that old man Siker had\npractically and to all intents and purposes offered him an option of\nthe business years ago.\n\nIt was a one-sided conversation.\n\n\"I says to him: 'Siker, if you ever want to sell out' ...  He says to\nme: 'Borker, my boy, you've only to offer me a reasonable figure' ...\nI says to him: 'Now, Siker, don't ever let anybody else get this\nbusiness....'\"\n\nThen there was ex-Inspector Stellingworth, of Stellingworth's Detective\nCorps, a gloomy man, who painted in the blackest colours the\ndifficulties and tragedies of private investigation, yet seemed willing\nenough to assume the burden of Siker's Agency, and give Bones a\nthousand pounds profit on his transaction.\n\nMr. Augustus Tibbetts spent three deliciously happy days in\nreorganising the business.  He purchased from the local gunsmith a\nnumber of handcuffs, which were festooned upon the wall behind his desk\nand secured secretly--since he did not think that the melancholy Mr.\nHilton would approve--a large cardboard box filled to the brim with\nadjustable beards of every conceivable hue, from bright scarlet to\nmouse colour.\n\nHe found time to relate to a sceptical Hamilton something of his\nachievements.\n\n\"Wonderful case to-day, dear old boy,\" he said enthusiastically on the\nthird evening.  \"A naughty old lady has been flirting with a very, very\nnaughty old officer.  Husband tremendously annoyed.  How that man loves\nthat woman!\"\n\n\"Which man?\" said Hamilton cynically.\n\n\"I refer to my client,\" said Bones not without dignity.\n\n\"Look here, Bones,\" said Hamilton with great seriousness, \"do you think\nthis is a very nice business you are in?  Personally, I think it's\nimmoral.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--immoral?\" demanded the indignant Bones.\n\n\"Prying into other people's lives,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Lives,\" retorted the oracular Bones, \"are meant to be pried into, dear\nold thing.  An examination of jolly old motives is essential to\nscientific progress.  I feel I am doing a public duty,\" he went on\nvirtuously, \"exposing the naughty, chastising the sinful, and all that\nsort of thing.\"\n\n\"But, honestly,\" said Hamilton persistently, \"do you think it's the\ngame to chase around collecting purely private details about people's\ngoings on?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Bones firmly, \"certainly, dear old thing.  It's a\npublic duty.  Never let it be written on the fair pages of Thiggumy\nthat a Tibbetts shrank back when the call of patriotism--all that sort\nof thing--you know what I mean?\"\n\n\"I don't,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Well, you're a jolly old dense one,\" said Bones.  \"And let me say here\nand now\"--he rammed his bony knuckles on the table and withdrew them\nwith an \"Ouch!\" to suck away the pain--\"let me tell you that, as the\nLatin poet said, '_Ad What's-his name, ad Thiggumy_.'  'Everything\nhuman's frightfully interesting'!\"\n\nBones turned up at his detective office the next morning, full of zeal,\nand Hilton immediately joined him in his private office.\n\n\"Well, we finish one case to-day, I think,\" said Hilton with\nsatisfaction.  \"It has been very hard trailing him, but I got a good\nman on the job, and here's the record.\"\n\nHe held in his hand a sheaf of papers.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Bones.  \"Excellent!  I hope we shall bring the\nmalefactor to justice.\"\n\n\"He's not exactly a malefactor,\" demurred Hilton.  \"It is a job we were\ndoing for one of our best clients.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent!\" murmured Bones.  \"And well we've done it, I'm\nsure.\"  He leant back in his chair and half closed his eyes.  \"Tell me\nwhat you have discovered.\"\n\n\"This man's a bit of a fool in some ways,\" said Hilton.\n\n\"Which man--the client?\"\n\n\"No, the fellow we've been trailing.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Bones.  \"Go on.\"\n\n\"In fact, I wonder that Mr. de Vinne bothered about him.\"\n\n\"De Vinne?\" said Bones sitting up.  \"Harold de Vinne, the moneyed one?\"\n\n\"That's him.  He's one of our oldest customers,\" said Hilton.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Bones, this time without any enthusiasm at all.\n\n\"You see, a man did him in the eye,\" explained Mr. Hilton, \"swindled\nhim, and all that sort of thing.  Well, I think we have got enough to\nmake this chap look silly.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Bones politely.  \"What have you got?\"\n\n\"Well, it appears,\" said Hilton, \"that this chap is madly in love with\nhis typist.\"\n\n\"Which chap?\" said Bones.\n\n\"The fellow who did Mr. de Vinne in the eye,\" replied the patient Mr.\nHilton.  \"He used to be an officer on the West Coast of Africa, and was\nknown as Bones.  His real name is Tibbetts.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Well, we've found out all about him,\" continued Hilton.  \"He's got a\nflat in Jermyn Street, and this girl of his, this typist girl, dines\nwith him.  She's not a bad-looking girl, mind you.\"\n\nBones rose to his feet, and there was in his face a terrible look.\n\n\"Hilton,\" he said, \"do you mean that you have been shadowing a\nperfectly innocent man and a charming, lovely old typewriter, that\ncouldn't say 'Goo' to a boose?\"\n\nBones was pardonably agitated.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that this office descends to this low practice\nof prying into the private lives of virtuous gentlemen and typewriters?\nShame upon you, Hilton!\"  His voice shook.  \"Give me that report!\"  He\nthrust the report into the fire.  \"Now call up Mr. Borker, and tell him\nI want to see him on business, and don't disturb me, because I am\nwriting a letter.\"\n\nHe pulled a sheet of paper from his stationery rack and wrote\nfuriously.  He hardly stopped to think, he scarcely stopped to spell.\nHis letter was addressed to Mr. de Vinne, and when, on the following\nday, Mr. Borker took over the business of Siker's Agency, that eminent\nfirm of investigators had one client the less.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nA COMPETENT JUDGE OF POETRY\n\nThere were times when Mr. Cresta Morris was called by that name; there\nwere other moments when he was \"Mr. Staleyborn.\"  His wife, a placid\nand trusting woman, responded to either name, having implicit faith in\nthe many explanations which her husband offered to her, the favourite\namongst them being that business men were seldom known by the names\nthey were born with.\n\nThus the eminent firm of drapers Messrs. Lavender & Rosemary were--or\nwas--in private life one Isadore Ruhl, and everybody knew that the\nmaker of Morgan's Superfatted Soap--\"the soap with foam\"--was a certain\nmember of the House of Lords whose name was not Morgan.\n\nMrs. Staleyborn, or Morris, had a daughter who ran away from home and\nbecame the secretary to Augustus Tibbetts, Managing Director of Schemes\nLimited, and there were odd moments of the day when Mrs. Staleyborn\nfelt vaguely uneasy about her child's future.  She had often, indeed,\nshed tears between five o'clock in the afternoon and seven o'clock in\nthe evening, which as everybody knows, is the most depressing time of\nthe day.\n\nShe was, however, one of those persons who are immensely comforted by\nthe repetition of ancient saws which become almost original every time\nthey are applied, and one of these sayings was \"Everything is for the\nbest.\"  She believed in miracles, and had reason, for she received her\nweekly allowance from her erratic husband with monotonous regularity\nevery Saturday morning.\n\nThis is a mere digression to point the fact that Mr. Morris was known\nby many names.  He was called \"Cress,\" and \"Ike,\" and \"Tubby,\" and\n\"Staley,\" according to the company in which he found himself.\n\nOne evening in June he found himself in the society of friends who\ncalled him by names which, if they were not strictly original, were\ncertainly picturesque.  One of these companions was a Mr. Webber, who\nhad worked more swindles with Morris than had any other partner, and\nthe third, and most talkative, was a gentleman named Seepidge, of\nSeepidge & Soomes, printers to the trade.\n\nMr. Seepidge was a man of forty-five, with a well-used face.  It was\none of those faces which look different from any other angle than that\nfrom which it is originally seen.  It may be said, too, that his\ncolouring was various.  As he addressed Mr. Morris, it varied between\npurple and blue.  Mrs. Morris was in the habit of addressing her\nhusband by endearing titles.  Mr. Seepidge was not addressing Mr.\nMorris in a way which, by any stretch of imagination, could be\ndescribed as endearing.\n\n\"Wait a bit, Lew,\" pleaded Mr. Morris.  \"Don't let's quarrel.\nAccidents will occur in the best of regulated families.\"\n\n\"Which you're not,\" said the explosive Mr. Seepidge, violently.  \"I\ngave you two hundred to back Morning Glory in the three o'clock race.\nYou go down to Newbury with my money, and you come back and tell me,\nafter the horse has won, that you couldn't get a bookmaker to take the\nbet!\"\n\n\"And I give you the money back,\" replied Mr. Morris.\n\n\"You did,\" reported Mr. Seepidge meaningly, \"and I was surprised to\nfind there wasn't a dud note in the parcel.  No, Ike, you\ndouble-crossed me.  You backed the horse and took the winnings, and\ncome back to me with a cock-and-bull story about not being able to find\na bookmaker.\"\n\nMr. Morris turned a pained face to his companion.\n\n\"Jim,\" he said, addressing Mr. Webber, \"did you ever in all your born\ndays hear a pal put it across another pal like that?  After the work\nwe've done all these years together, me and Lew--why, you're like a\nserpent in the bush, you are really!\"\n\nIt was a long time, and there was much passing of glasses across a\nlead-covered bar, before Mr. Seepidge could be pacified--the meeting\ntook place in the private bar of \"The Bread and Cheese,\" Camden\nTown--but presently he turned from the reproachful into the melancholy\nstage, explained the bad condition of business, what with the paper\nbills and wages bills he had to pay, and hinted ominously at bankruptcy.\n\nIn truth, the firm of Seepidge was in a bad way.  The police had\nrecently raided the premises and nipped in the bud a very promising\norder for five hundred thousand sweepstake tickets, which were being\nprinted surreptitiously, for Mr. Seepidge dealt in what is colloquially\nknown as \"snide printing.\"\n\nWhether Mr. Cresta Morris had indeed swindled his partner of many\ncrimes, and had backed Morning Glory at a remunerative price for his\nown profit, is a painful question which need not be too closely\nexamined.  It is certain that Seepidge was in a bad way, and as Mr.\nMorris told himself with admirable philosophy, even if he had won a\npacket of money, a thousand or so would not have been sufficient to get\nMr. Seepidge out of the cart.\n\n\"Something has got to be done,\" said Mr. Cresta Morris briskly.\n\n\"Somebody,\" corrected the taciturn Webber.  \"The question is, who?\"\n\n\"I tell you, boys, I'm in a pretty bad way,\" said Seepidge earnestly.\n\"I don't think, even if I'd backed that winner, I could have got out of\ntrouble.  The business is practically in pawn; I'm getting a police\ninspection once a week.  I've got a job now which may save my bacon, if\nI can dodge the 'splits'--an order for a million leaflets for a Hamburg\nlottery house.  And I want the money--bad!  I owe about three thousand\npounds.\"\n\n\"I know where there's money for asking,\" said Webber, and they looked\nat him.\n\nHis interesting disclosure was not to follow immediately, for they had\nreached closing-time, and were respectfully ushered into the street.\n\n\"Come over to my club,\" said Mr. Seepidge.\n\nHis club was off the Tottenham Court Road, and its membership was\nartistic.  It had changed its name after every raid that had been made\nupon it, and the fact that the people arrested had described themselves\nas artists and actresses consolidated the New Napoli Club as one of the\nartistic institutions of London.\n\n\"Now, where's this money?\" asked Seepidge, when they were seated round\na little table.\n\n\"There's a fellow called Bones----\" began Mr. Webber.\n\n\"Oh, him!\" interrupted Mr. Morris, in disgust.  \"Good Heavens!  You're\nnot going to try him again!\"\n\n\"We'd have got him before if you hadn't been so clever,\" said Webber.\n\"I tell you, he's rolling in money.  He's just moved into a new flat in\nDevonshire Street that can't cost him less than six hundred a year.\"\n\n\"How do you know this?\" asked the interested Morris.\n\n\"Well,\" confessed Webber, without embarrassment, \"I've been working\nsolo on him, and I thought I'd be able to pull the job off myself.\"\n\n\"That's a bit selfish,\" reproached Morris, shaking his head.  \"I didn't\nexpect this from you, Webbie.\"\n\n\"Never mind what you expected,\" said Webber, unperturbed.  \"I tell you\nI tried it.  I've been nosing round his place, getting information from\nhis servants, and I've learned a lot about him.  Mind you,\" said Mr.\nWebber, \"I'm not quite certain how to use what I know to make money.\nIf I'd known that, I shouldn't have told you two chaps anything about\nit.  But I've got an idea that this chap Bones is a bit sensitive on a\ncertain matter, and Cully Tring, who's forgotten more about human men\nthan I ever knew, told me that, if you can get a mug on his sensitive\nspot, you can bleed him to death.  Now, three heads are better than\none, and I think, if we get together, we'll lift enough stuff from Mr.\nBlinking Bones to keep us at Monte Carlo for six months.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Mr. Seepidge impressively, \"let us put our 'eads together.\"\n\nIn emotional moments that enterprising printer was apt to overlook the\nbox where the little \"h's\" were kept.\n\nBones had indeed moved into the intellectual atmosphere of Devonshire\nStreet.  He had hired a flat of great beauty and magnificence, with\nlofty rooms and distempered walls and marble chimney-pieces, for all\nthe world like those rooms in the catalogues of furniture dealers which\nso admirably show off the fifty-pound drawing-room suite offered on the\neasiest terms.\n\n\"My dear old thing,\" he said, describing his new splendours to\nHamilton, \"you ought to see the jolly old bathroom!\"\n\n\"What do you want a bath for?\" asked Hamilton innocently.  \"You've only\ngot the place for three years.\"\n\n\"Now, dear old thing, don't be humorous,\" said Bones severely.  \"Don't\nbe cheap, dear old comic one.\"\n\n\"The question is,\" said Hamilton, \"why the dickens do you want a new\nflat?  Your old flat was quite a palatial establishment.  Are you\nthinking of setting up housekeeping?\"\n\nBones turned very red.  In his embarrassment he stood first upon one\nleg and then the other, lifting his eyebrows almost to the roof of his\nhead to let in his monocle, and lifted them as violently to let it out\nagain.\n\n\"Don't pry, don't pry, dear old Ham,\" he said testily.  \"Great Heavens\nand Moses!  Can't a fellow take a desirable flat, with all modern\nconveniences, in the most fashionable part of the West End, and all\nthat sort of thing, without exciting the voice of scandal, dear old\nthing?  I'm surprised at you, really I am, Ham.  I am, Ham,\" he\nrepeated.  \"That sounds good,\" he said, brightening up.  \"Am Ham!\"\n\n\"But what is the scheme?\" persisted Hamilton.\n\n\"A bargain, a bargain, dear old officer,\" said Bones, hurriedly, and\nproceeded to the next business.\n\nThat next business included the rejection of several very promising\noffers which had arrived from different directors of companies, and\npeople.  Bones was known as a financier.  People who wanted other\npeople to put money into things invariably left Bones to the last,\nbecause they liked trying the hard things first.  The inventor and\npatentee of the reaping machine that could be worked by the farmer in\nhis study, by means of push keys, was sure, sooner or later, to meet a\nman who scratched his chin and said:\n\n\"Hard luck, but why don't you try that man Tibbetts?  He's got an\noffice somewhere around.  You'll find it in the telephone book.  He's\ngot more money than he knows what to do with, and your invention is the\nvery thing he'd finance.\"\n\nAs a rule, it was the very thing that Bones did not finance.\n\nCompanies that required ten thousand pounds for the extension of their\npremises, and the fulfilment of the orders which were certain to come\nnext year, drafted through their secretaries the most wonderful\nletters, offering Bones a seat on their board, or even two seats, in\nexchange for his autograph on the south-east corner of a cheque.  These\nletters usually began somehow like this:\n\n\"At a moment when the eyes of the world are turned upon Great Britain,\nand when her commercial supremacy is threatened, it behoves us all to\nincrease production....\"  And usually there was some reference to \"the\npatriotic duty of capital.\"\n\nThere was a time when these appeals to his better nature would have\nmoved Bones to amazing extravagance, but happily that time was before\nhe had any money to speak about.\n\nFor Bones was growing in wisdom and in wiliness as the days passed.\nGoing through the pile of correspondence, he came upon a letter which\nhe read thoughtfully, and then read again before he reached to the\ntelephone and called a number.  In the City of London there was a\nbusiness-like agency which supplied him with a great deal of useful\ninformation, and it was to these gentlemen that he addressed his query:\n\"Who are Messrs. Seepidge & Soomes?\"\n\nHe waited for some time with the receiver at his ear, a far-away look\nin his eyes, and then the reply came:\n\n\"A little firm of printers run by a rascal named Seepidge, who has been\ntwice bankrupt and is now insolvent.  His firm has been visited by the\npolice for illegal printing several times, and the firm is in such a\nlow condition that it has a job to pay its wages bill.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Bones.  \"Thank you, dear old commercial guardian.\nWhat is the business worth?\"\n\n\"It's worth your while to keep away from it,\" said the humorous reply,\nand Bones hung up the receiver.\n\n\"Ham, old dear,\" he said, and Hamilton looked up.  \"Suppose,\" said\nBones, stretching out his legs and fixing his monocle, \"suppose, my\njolly old accountant and partner, you were offered a business which was\nworth\"--he paused--\"which was worth your while keeping away from\nit--that's a pretty good line, don't you think, old literary critic?\"\n\n\"A very good line,\" said Hamilton calmly; \"but you have rather a\nloud-speaking telephone, and I think I have heard the phrase before.\"\n\n\"Oh, have you?\" said Bones by no means abashed.  \"Still, it's a very\ngood line.  And suppose you were offered this printing business for\nfifteen thousand pounds, what would you say?\"\n\n\"It depends on who was present,\" said Ham, \"and where I was.  For\nexample, if I were in the gorgeous drawing-room of your wonderful flat,\nin the splendid presence of your lovely lady wife to be----\"\n\nBones rose and wagged his finger.\n\n\"Is nothing sacred to you, dear old Ham?\" he choked.  \"Are the most\ntender emotions, dear old thing, which have ever been experienced by\nany human being----\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" said Hamilton, \"and let's hear about this financial\nproblem of yours.\"\n\nBones was ruffled, and blinked, and it was some time before he could\nbring himself back to sordid matters of business.\n\n\"Well, suppose this jolly old brigand offered you his perfectly beastly\nbusiness for fifteen thousand pounds, what would you do?\"\n\n\"Send for the police,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Would you now?\" said Bones, as if the idea struck him for the first\ntime.  \"I never have sent for the police you know, and I've had simply\nterrible offers put up to me.\"\n\n\"Or put it in the waste-paper basket,\" said Hamilton, and then in\nsurprise: \"Why the dickens are you asking all these questions?\"\n\n\"Why am I asking all these questions?\" repeated Bones.  \"Because, old\nthing, I have a hump.\"\n\nHamilton raised incredulous eyebrows.\n\n\"I have what the Americans call a hump.\"\n\n\"A hump?\" said Hamilton, puzzled.  \"Oh, you mean a 'hunch.'\"\n\n\"Hump or hunch, it's all the same,\" said Bones airily.  \"But I've got\nit.\"\n\n\"What exactly is your hunch?\"\n\n\"There's something behind this,\" said Bones, tapping a finger solemnly\non the desk.  \"There's a scheme behind this--there's a swindle--there's\na ramp.  Nobody imagines for one moment that a man of my reputation\ncould be taken in by a barefaced swindle of this character.  I think I\nhave established in the City of London something of a tradition,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"You have,\" agreed Hamilton.  \"You're supposed to be the luckiest devil\nthat ever walked up Broad Street.\"\n\n\"I never walk up Broad Street, anyway,\" said Bones, annoyed.  \"It is a\ndetestable street, a naughty old street, and I should ride up it--or,\nat least, I shall in a day or two.\"\n\n\"Buying a car?\" asked Hamilton, interested.\n\n\"I'll tell you about that later,\" said Bones evasively, and went on:\n\n\"Now, putting two and two together, you know the conclusion I've\nreached?\"\n\n\"Four?\" suggested Hamilton.\n\nBones, with a shrug ended the conversation then and there, and carried\nhis correspondence to the outer office, knocking, as was his wont,\nuntil his stenographer gave him permission to enter.  He shut the\ndoor--always a ceremony--behind him and tiptoed toward her.\n\nMarguerite Whitland took her mind from the letter she was writing, and\ngave her full attention to her employer.\n\n\"May I sit down, dear young typewriter?\" said Bones humbly.\n\n\"Of course you can sit down, or stand up, or do anything you like in\nthe office.  Really,\" she said, with a laugh, \"really, Mr. Tibbetts, I\ndon't know whether you're serious sometimes.\"\n\n\"I'm serious all the time, dear old flicker of keyboards,\" said Bones,\nseating himself deferentially, and at a respectful distance.\n\nShe waited for him to begin, but he was strangely embarrassed even for\nhim.\n\n\"Miss Marguerite,\" he began at last a little huskily, \"the jolly old\npoet is born and not----\"\n\n\"Oh, have you brought them?\" she asked eagerly, and held out her hand.\n\"Do show me, please!\"\n\nBones shook his head.\n\n\"No, I have not brought them,\" he said.  \"In fact, I can't bring them\nyet.\"\n\nShe was disappointed, and showed it.\n\n\"You've promised me for a week I should see them.\"\n\n\"Awful stuff, awful stuff!\" murmured Bones disparagingly.  \"Simply\nterrible tripe!\"\n\n\"Tripe?\" she said, puzzled.\n\n\"I mean naughty rubbish and all that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I'm sure it's good,\" she said.  \"You wouldn't talk about your\npoems if they weren't good.\"\n\n\"Well,\" admitted Bones, \"I'm not so sure, dear old arbitrator\nelegantus, to use a Roman expression, I'm not so sure you're not right.\nOne of these days those poems will be given to this wicked old world,\nand--then you'll see.\"\n\n\"But what are they all about?\" she asked for about the twentieth time.\n\n\"What are they about?\" said Bones slowly and thoughtfully.  \"They're\nabout one thing and another, but mostly about my--er--friends.  Of\ncourse a jolly old poet like me, or like any other old fellow, like\nShakespeare, if you like--to go from the sublime to the ridiculous--has\nfits of poetising that mean absolutely nothing.  It doesn't follow that\nif a poet like Browning or me writes fearfully enthusiastically and all\nthat sort of thing about a person...  No disrespect, you understand,\ndear old miss.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" she said, and wondered.\n\n\"I take a subject for a verse,\" said Bones airily, waving his hand\ntoward Throgmorton Street.  \"A 'bus, a fuss, a tram, a lamb, a hat, a\ncat, a sunset, a little flower growing on the river's brim, and all\nthat sort of thing--any old subject, dear old miss, that strikes me in\nthe eye--you understand?\"\n\n\"Of course I understand,\" she said readily.  \"A poet's field is\nuniversal, and I quite understand that if he writes nice things about\nhis friends he doesn't mean it.\"\n\n\"Oh, but doesn't he?\" said Bones truculently.  \"Oh, doesn't he, indeed?\nThat just shows what a fat lot you know about it, jolly old Miss\nMarguerite.  When I write a poem about a girl----\"\n\n\"Oh, I see, they're about girls,\" said she a little coldly.\n\n\"About _a_ girl,\" said Bones, this time so pointedly that his confusion\nwas transferred immediately to her.\n\n\"Anyway, they don't mean anything,\" she said bravely.\n\n\"My dear young miss\"--Bones rose, and his voice trembled as he laid his\nhand on the typewriter where hers had been a second before--\"my dear\nold miss,\" he said, jingling with the letters \"a\" and \"e\" as though he\nhad originally put out his hand to touch the keyboard, and was in no\nway surprised and distressed that the little hand which had covered\nthem had been so hastily withdrawn, \"I can only tell you----\"\n\n\"There is your telephone bell,\" she said hurriedly.  \"Shall I answer\nit?\"  And before Bones could reply she had disappeared.\n\nHe went back to his flat that night with his mind made up.  He would\nshow her those beautiful verses.  He had come to this conclusion many\ntimes before, but his heart had failed him.  But he was growing\nreckless now.  She should see them--priceless verses, written in a most\nexpensive book, with the monogram \"W.M.\" stamped in gold upon the\ncover.  And as he footed it briskly up Devonshire Street, he recited:\n\n  \"O Marguerite, thou lovely flower,\n  I think of thee most every hour,\n  With eyes of grey and eyes of blue,\n  That change with every passing hue,\n  Thy lovely fingers beautifully typing,\n  How sweet and fragrant is thy writing!\n\n\nHe thought he was reciting to himself, but that was not the case.\nPeople turned and watched him, and when he passed the green doorway of\nDr. Harkley Bawkley, the eminent brain specialist, they were visibly\ndisappointed.\n\nHe did not unlock the rosewood door of his flat, but rang the silver\nbell.\n\nHe preferred this course.  Ali, his Coast servant, in his new livery of\nblue and silver, made the opening of the door something only less\npicturesque than the opening of Parliament.  This intention may not\nhave been unconnected with the fact that there were two or three young\nladies, and very young at that, on the landing, waiting for the door of\nthe opposite flat to open.\n\nAli opened the door.  The lower half of him was blue and silver, the\nupper half was Oxford shirt and braces, for he had been engaged in\ncleaning the silver.\n\n\"What the deuce do you mean by it?\" demanded Bones wrathfully.\n\"Haven't I given you a good uniform, you blithering jackass?  What the\ndeuce do you mean by opening the door, in front of people, too, dressed\nlike a--a--dashed naughty boy?\"\n\n\"Silverous forks require lubrication for evening repast,\" said Ali\nreproachfully.\n\nBones stalked on to his study.\n\nIt was a lovely study, with a carpet of beautiful blue.  It was a study\nof which a man might be proud.  The hangings were of silk, and the\nsuite was also of silk, and also of blue silk.  He sat down at his\nLouis XVI. table, took a virgin pad, and began to write.  The\ninspiration was upon him, and he worked at top speed.\n\n\"I saw a litle bird--a litle bird--a litle bird, floating in the sky,\"\nhe wrote.  \"Ever so high!  Its pretty song came down, down to me, and\nit sounded like your voice the other afternoon at tea, at tea.  And in\nits flite I remembered the night when you came home to me.\"\n\nHe paused at the last, because Marguerite Whitland had never come home\nto him, certainly not at night.  The proprieties had to be observed,\nand he changed the last few lines to: \"I remember the day when you came\naway to Margate on the sea, on the sea.\"\n\nHe had not seen his book of poems for a week, but there was a blank\npage at the end into which the last, and possibly the greatest, might\ngo.  He pulled the drawer open.  It was empty.  There was no mistaking\nthe fact that that had been the drawer in which the poems had reposed,\nbecause Bones had a very excellent memory.\n\nHe rang the bell and Ali came, his Oxford shirt and braces imperfectly\nhidden under a jersey which had seen better days.\n\n\"Ali\"--and this time Bones spoke rapidly and in Coast Arabic--\"in this\ndrawer was a beautiful book in which I had written many things.\"\n\nAli nodded.\n\n\"Master, that I know, for you are a great poet, and I speak your\npraises whenever I go into the _caf\u00e9_, for Hafiz did not write more\nbeautifully than you.\"\n\n\"What the dooce,\" spluttered Bones in English, \"do you mean by telling\npeople about me--eh, you scoundrel?  What the dooce do you mean by it,\nyou naughty old ebony?\"\n\n\"Master,\" said All \"eulogistic speechification creates admiration in\ncommon minds.\"\n\nHe was so unruffled, so complacent, that Bones, could only look at him\nin wonder.  There was, too, about Ali Mahomet a queer look of guilty\nsatisfaction, as of one who had been surprised in a good act.\n\n\"Master,\" he said, \"it is true that, contrary to modest desires of\nhumble poets, I have offered praises of your literature to unauthorised\npersons, sojourning in high-class _caf\u00e9_ 'King's Arms,' for my evening\nrefreshment.  Also desiring to create pleasant pleasure and surprise,\nyour servant from his own emoluments authorised preparation of said\npoems in real print work.\"\n\nBones gasped.\n\n\"You were going to get my things printed?  Oh, you ... oh, you....\"\n\nAli was by no means distressed.\n\n\"To-morrow there shall come to you a beautiful book for the master's\nsurprise and joyousness.  I myself will settle account satisfactorily\nfrom emoluments accrued.\"\n\nBones could only sit down and helplessly wag his head.  Presently he\ngrew calmer.  It was a kindly thought, after all.  Sooner or later\nthose poems of his must be offered to the appreciation of a larger\naudience.  He saw blind Fate working through his servitor's act.  The\nmatter had been taken out of his hands now.\n\n\"What made you do it, you silly old josser?\" he asked.\n\n\"Master, one gentleman friend suggested or proffered advice, himself\nbeing engaged in printery, possessing machines----\"\n\nA horrible thought came into Bones's head.\n\n\"What was his name?\" he asked.\n\nAli fumbled in the capacious depths of his trousers pocket and produced\na soiled card, which he handed to Bones.  Bones read with a groan:\n\n  MESSRS. SEEPIDGE & SOOMES,\n    Printers to the Trade.\n\n\nBones fell back in the padded depths of his writing chair.\n\n\"Now, you've done it,\" he said hollowly, and threw the card back again.\n\nIt fell behind Ali, and he turned his back on Bones and stooped to pick\nup the card.  It was a target which, in Bones's then agitated\ncondition, he could scarcely be expected to resist.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nBones spent a sleepless night, and was at the office early.  By the\nfirst post came the blow he had expected--a bulky envelope bearing on\nthe flap the sign-manual of Messrs. Seepidge & Soomes.  The letter\nwhich accompanied the proof enclosed merely repeated the offer to sell\nthe business for fifteen thousand pounds.\n\n\"This will include,\" the letter went on, \"a great number of uncompleted\norders, one of which is for a very charming series of poems which are\nnow in our possession, and a proof-sheet of which we beg to enclose.\"\n\nBones read the poems and they somehow didn't look as well in print as\nthey had in manuscript.  And, horror of horrors--he went white at the\nthought--they were unmistakably disrespectful to Miss Marguerite\nWhitland!  They were love poems.  They declared Bones's passion in\nlanguage which was unmistakable.  They told of her hair which was\nbeyond compare, of her eyes which rivalled the skies, and of her lips\nlike scarlet strips.  Bones bowed his head in his hands, and was in\nthis attitude when the door opened, and Miss Whitland, who had had a\nperfect night and looked so lovely that her poems became pallid and\nnauseating caricatures, stepped quietly into the room.\n\n\"Aren't you well, Mr. Tibbetts?\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, quite well,\" said Bones valiantly.  \"Very tra-la-la, dear old\nthing, dear old typewriter, I mean.\"\n\n\"Is that correspondence for me?\"\n\nShe held out her hand, and Bones hastily thrust Messrs. Seepidge &\nSoomes's letter, with its enclosure, into his pocket.\n\n\"No, no, yes, yes,\" he said incoherently.  \"Certainly why not this is a\nletter dear old thing about a patent medicine I have just taken I am\nnot all I was a few years ago old age is creeping on me and all that\nsort of stuff shut the door as you go in.\"\n\nHe said this without a comma or a full-stop.  He said it so wildly that\nshe was really alarmed.\n\nHamilton arrived a little later, and to him Bones made full confession.\n\n\"Let's see the poems,\" said Hamilton seriously.\n\n\"You won't laugh?\" said Bones.\n\n\"Don't be an ass.  Of course I won't laugh, unless they're supposed to\nbe comic,\" said Hamilton.  And, to do him justice, he did not so much\nas twitch a lip, though Bones watched his face jealously.\n\nSo imperturbable was Hamilton's expression that Bones had courage to\ndemand with a certain smugness:\n\n\"Well, old man, not so bad?  Of course, they don't come up to Kipling,\nbut I can't say that I'm fearfully keen on Kipling, old thing.  That\nlittle one about the sunset, I think, is rather a gem.\"\n\n\"I think you're rather a gem,\" said Hamilton, handing back the proofs.\n\"Bones, you've behaved abominably, writing poetry of that kind and\nleaving it about.  You're going to make this girl the laughing-stock of\nLondon.\"\n\n\"Laughing-stock?\" snorted the annoyed Bones.  \"What the dickens do you\nmean, old thing?  I told you there are no comic poems.  They're all\nlike that.\"\n\n\"I was afraid they were,\" said Hamilton.  \"But poems needn't be comic,\"\nhe added a little more tactfully, as he saw Bones's colour rising,\n\"they needn't be comic to excite people's amusement.  The most solemn\nand sacred things, the most beautiful thoughts, the most wonderful\nsentiments, rouse the laughter of the ignorant.\"\n\n\"True, true,\" agreed Bones graciously.  \"And I rather fancy that they\nare a little bit on the most beautiful side, my jolly old graven image.\nAll heart outpourings you understand--but no, you wouldn't understand,\nmy old crochety one.  One of these days, as I've remarked before, they\nwill be read by competent judges ... midnight oil, dear old thing--at\nleast, I have electric light in my flat.  They're generally done after\ndinner.\"\n\n\"After a heavy dinner, I should imagine,\" said Hamilton with asperity.\n\"What are you going to do about it, Bones?\"\n\nBones scratched his nose.\n\n\"I'm blessed if I know,\" he said.\n\n\"Shall I tell you what you must do?\" asked Hamilton quietly.\n\n\"Certainly, Ham, my wise old counsellor,\" said the cheerful Bones.\n\"Certainly, by all means, Why not?\"\n\n\"You must go to Miss Whitland and tell her all about it.\"\n\nBones's face fell.\n\n\"Good Heavens, no!\" he gasped.  \"Don't be indelicate, Ham!  Why, she\nmight never forgive me, dear old thing!  Suppose she walked out of the\noffice in a huff?  Great Scotland!  Great Jehoshaphat!  It's too\nterrible to contemplate!\"\n\n\"You must tell her,\" said Hamilton firmly.  \"It's only fair to the girl\nto know exactly what is hanging over her.\"\n\nBones pleaded, and offered a hundred rapid solutions, none of which\nwere acceptable to the relentless Hamilton.\n\n\"I'll tell her myself, if you like,\" he said.  \"I could explain that\nthey're just the sort of things that a silly ass of a man does, and\nthat they were not intended to be offensive--even that one about her\nlips being like two red strips.  Strips of what--carpet?\"\n\n\"Don't analyse it, Ham, lad, don't analyse it!\" begged Bones.  \"Poems\nare like pictures, old friend.  You want to stand at a distance to see\nthem.\"\n\n\"Personally I suffer from astigmatism,\" said Hamilton, and read the\npoems again.  He stopped once or twice to ask such pointed questions as\nhow many \"y's\" were in \"skies,\" and Bones stood on alternate feet,\nprotesting incoherently.\n\n\"They're not bad, old boy?\" he asked anxiously at last.  \"You wouldn't\nsay they were bad?\"\n\n\"Bad,\" said Hamilton in truth, \"is not the word I should apply.\"\n\nBones cheered up.\n\n\"That's what I think, dear ex-officer,\" he smirked.  \"Of course, a\nfellow is naturally shy about maiden efforts, and all that sort of\nthing, but, hang it all, I've seen worse than that last poem, old\nthing.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" admitted Hamilton, mechanically turning back to the first\npoem.\n\n\"After all\"--Bones was rapidly becoming philosophical--\"I'm not so sure\nthat it isn't the best thing that could happen.  Let 'em print 'em!\nHey?  What do you say?  Put that one about young Miss Marguerite being\nlike a pearl discovered in a dustbin, dear Ham, put it before a\ncompetent judge, and what would he say?\"\n\n\"Ten years,\" snarled Hamilton, \"and you'd get off lightly!\"\n\nBones smiled with admirable toleration, and there the matter ended for\nthe moment.\n\nIt was a case of blackmail, as Hamilton had pointed out, but, as the\nday proceeded, Bones took a more and more lenient view of his enemy's\nfault.  By the afternoon he was cheerful, even jocose, and, even in\nsuch moments as he found himself alone with the girl, brought the\nconversation round to the subject of poetry as one of the fine arts,\nand cunningly excited her curiosity.\n\n\"There is so much bad poetry in the world,\" said the girl on one such\noccasion, \"that I think there should be a lethal chamber for people who\nwrite it.\"\n\n\"Agreed, dear old tick-tack,\" assented Bones, with an amused smile.\n\"What is wanted is--well, I know, dear old miss.  It may surprise you\nto learn that I once took a correspondence course in poetry writing.\"\n\n\"Nothing surprises me about you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" she laughed.\n\nHe went into her office before leaving that night.  Hamilton, with a\ngloomy shake of his head by way of farewell, had already departed, and\nBones, who had given the matter very considerable thought, decided that\nthis was a favourable occasion to inform her of the amusing efforts of\nhis printer correspondent to extract money.\n\nThe girl had finished her work, her typewriter was covered, and she was\nwearing her hat and coat.  But she sat before her desk, a frown on her\npretty face and an evening newspaper in her hand, and Bones's heart\nmomentarily sank.  Suppose the poems had been given to the world?\n\n\"All the winners, dear old miss?\" he asked, with spurious gaiety.\n\nShe looked up with a start.\n\n\"No,\" she said.  \"I'm rather worried, Mr. Tibbetts.  A friend of my\nstep-father's has got into trouble again, and I'm anxious lest my\nmother should have any trouble.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear!\" said the sympathetic Bones.  \"How disgustingly annoying!\nWho's the dear old friend?\"\n\n\"A man named Seepidge,\" said the girl, and Bones gripped a chair for\nsupport.  \"The police have found that he is printing something illegal.\nI don't quite understand it all, but the things they were printing were\ninvitations to a German lottery.\"\n\n\"Very naughty, very unpatriotic,\" murmured the palpitating Bones, and\nthen the girl laughed.\n\n\"It has its funny side,\" she said.  \"Mr. Seepidge pretended that he was\ncarrying out a legitimate order--a book of poems.  Isn't that absurd?\"\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" said Bones hollowly.\n\n\"Listen,\" said the girl, and read:\n\n\"The magistrate, in sentencing Seepidge to six months' hard labour,\nsaid that there was no doubt that the man had been carrying on an\nillegal business.  He had had the effrontery to pretend that he was\nprinting a volume of verse.  The court had heard extracts from that\nprecious volume, which had evidently been written by Mr. Seepidge's\noffice-boy.  He had never read such appalling drivel in his life.  He\nordered the confiscated lottery prospectuses to be destroyed, and he\nthought he would be rendering a service to humanity if he added an\norder for the destruction of this collection of doggerel.\"\n\nThe girl looked up at Bones.\n\n\"It is curious that we should have been talking about poetry to-day,\nisn't it?\" she asked.  \"Now, Mr. Tibbetts, I'm going to insist upon\nyour bringing that book of yours to-morrow.\"\n\nBones, very flushed of face, shook his head.\n\n\"Dear old disciple,\" he said huskily, \"another time ... another time\n... poetry should be kept for years ... like old wine...\"\n\n\"Who said that?\" she asked, folding her paper and rising.\n\n\"Competent judges,\" said Bones, with a gulp.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE LAMP THAT NEVER WENT OUT\n\n\"Have you seen her?\" asked Bones.\n\nHe put this question with such laboured unconcern that Hamilton put\ndown his pen and glared suspiciously at his partner.\n\n\"She's rather a beauty,\" Bones went on, toying with his ivory\npaper-knife.  \"She has one of those dinky bonnets, dear old thing, that\nmakes you feel awfully braced with life.\"\n\nHamilton gasped.  He had seen the beautiful Miss Whitland enter the\noffice half an hour before, but he had not noticed her head-dress.\n\n\"Her body's dark blue, with teeny red stripes,\" said Bones dreamily,\n\"and all her fittings are nickel-plated----\"\n\n\"Stop!\" commanded Hamilton hollowly.  \"To what unhappy woman are you\nreferring in this ribald fashion?\"\n\n\"Woman!\" spluttered the indignant Bones.  \"I'm talking about my car.\"\n\n\"Your car?\"\n\n\"My car,\" said Bones, in the off-handed way that a sudden millionaire\nmight refer to \"my earth.\"\n\n\"You've bought a car?\"\n\nBones nodded.\n\n\"It's a jolly good 'bus,\" he said.  \"I thought of running down to\nBrighton on Sunday.\"\n\nHamilton got up and walked slowly across the room with his hands in his\npockets.\n\n\"You're thinking of running down to Brighton, are you?\" he said.  \"Is\nit one of those kind of cars where you have to do your own running?\"\n\nBones, with a good-natured smile, also rose from his desk and walked to\nthe window.\n\n\"My car,\" he said, and waved his hand to the street.\n\nBy craning his neck, Hamilton was able to get a view of the patch of\nroadway immediately in front of the main entrance to the building.  And\nundoubtedly there was a car in waiting--a long, resplendent machine\nthat glittered in the morning sunlight.\n\n\"What's the pink cushion on the seat?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"That's not a pink cushion, dear old myoptic,\" said Bones calmly;\n\"that's my chauffeur--Ali ben Ahmed.\"\n\n\"Good lor!\" said the impressed Hamilton.  \"You've a nerve to drive into\nthe City with a sky-blue Kroo boy.\"\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"We attracted a certain amount of attention,\" he admitted, not without\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Hamilton, going back to his desk.  \"People thought\nyou were advertising Pill Pellets for Pale Poultry.  When did you buy\nthis infernal machine?\"\n\nBones, at his desk, crossed his legs and put his fingers together.\n\n\"Negotiations, dear old Ham, have been in progress for a month,\" he\nrecited.  \"I have been taking lessons on the quiet, and to-day--proof!\"\nHe took out his pocket-book and threw a paper with a lordly air towards\nhis partner.  It fell half-way on the floor.\n\n\"Don't trouble to get up,\" said Hamilton.  \"It's your motor licence.\nYou needn't be able to drive a car to get that.\"\n\nAnd then Bones dropped his attitude of insouciance and became a\nvociferous advertisement for the six-cylinder Carter-Crispley (\"the big\ncar that's made like a clock\").  He became double pages with\nillustrations and handbooks and electric signs.  He spoke of Carter and\nof Crispley individually and collectively with enthusiasm, affection,\nand reverence.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Hamilton, when he had finished.  \"It sounds good.\"\n\n\"Sounds good!\" scoffed Bones.  \"Dear old sceptical one, that car...\"\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nAll excesses being their own punishment, two days later Bones renewed\nan undesirable acquaintance.  In the early days of Schemes, Ltd., Mr.\nAugustus Tibbetts had purchased a small weekly newspaper called the\n_Flame_.  Apart from the losses he incurred during its short career,\nthe experience was made remarkable by the fact that he became\nacquainted with Mr. Jelf, a young and immensely self-satisfied man in\npince-nez, who habitually spoke uncharitably of bishops, and never\nreferred to members of the Government without causing sensitive people\nto shudder.\n\nThe members of the Government retaliated by never speaking of Jelf at\nall, so there was probably some purely private feud between them.\n\nJelf disapproved of everything.  He was twenty-four years of age, and\nhe, too, had made the acquaintance of the Hindenburg Line.  Naturally\nBones thought of Jelf when he purchased the _Flame_.\n\nFrom the first Bones had run the _Flame_ with the object of exposing\nthings.  He exposed Germans, Swedes, and Turks--which was safe.  He\nexposed a furniture dealer who had made him pay twice for an article\nbecause a receipt was lost, and that cost money.  He exposed a man who\nhad been very rude to him in the City.  He would have exposed James\nJacobus Jelf, only that individual showed such eagerness to expose his\nown shortcomings, at a guinea a column, that Bones had lost interest.\n\nHis stock of personal grievances being exhausted, he had gone in for a\ngeneral line of exposure which embraced members of the aristocracy and\nthe Stock Exchange.\n\nIf Bones did not like a man's face, he exposed him.  He had a column\nheaded \"What I Want to Know,\" and signed \"Senob.\"  in which such\npertinent queries appeared as:\n\n\"When will the naughty old lord who owns a sky-blue motor-car, and\nwears pink spats, realise that his treatment of his tenants is a\ndisgrace to his ancient lineage?\"\n\nThis was one of James Jacobus Jelf's contributed efforts.  It happened\non this particular occasion that there was only one lord in England who\nowned a sky-blue car and blush-rose spats, and it cost Bones two\nhundred pounds to settle his lordship.\n\nSoon after this, Bones disposed of the paper, and instructed Mr. Jelf\nnot to call again unless he called in an ambulance--an instruction\nwhich afterwards filled him with apprehension, since he knew that J. J.\nJ. would charge up the ambulance to the office.\n\nThus matters stood two days after his car had made its public\nappearance, and Bones sat confronting the busy pages of his garage bill.\n\nOn this day he had had his lunch brought into the office, and he was in\na maze of calculation, when there came a knock at the door.\n\n\"Come in!\" he yelled, and, as there was no answer, walked to the door\nand opened it.\n\nA young man stood in the doorway--a young man very earnest and very\nmysterious--none other than James Jacobus Jelf.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, is it?\" said Bones unfavourably \"I thought it was\nsomebody important.\"\n\nJelf tiptoed into the room and closed the door securely behind him.\n\n\"Old man,\" he said, in tones little above a whisper, \"I've got a\nfortune for you.\"\n\n\"Dear old libeller, leave it with the lift-man,\" said Bones.  \"He has a\nwife and three children.\"\n\nMr. Jelf examined his watch.\n\n\"I've got to get away at three o'clock, old man,\" he said.\n\n\"Don't let me keep you, old writer,\" said Bones with insolent\nindifference.\n\nJelf smiled.\n\n\"I'd rather not say where I'm going,\" he volunteered.  \"It's a scoop,\nand if it leaked out, there would be the devil to pay.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Bones, who knew Mr. Jelf well.  \"I thought it was something\nlike that.\"\n\n\"I'd like to tell you, Tibbetts,\" said Jelf regretfully, \"but you know\nhow particular one has to be when one is dealing with matters affecting\nthe integrity of ministers.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" responded Bones, wilfully dense, \"especially huffy\nold vicars, dear old thing.\"\n\n\"Oh, them!\" said Jelf, extending his contempt to the rules which govern\nthe employment of the English language.  \"I don't worry about those\npoor funny things.  No, I am speaking of a matter--you have heard about\nG.?\" he asked suddenly.\n\n\"No,\" said Bones with truth.\n\nJelf looked astonished.\n\n\"What!\" he said incredulously.  \"You in the heart of things, and don't\nknow about old G.?\"\n\n\"No, little Mercury, and I don't want to know,\" said Bones, busying\nhimself with his papers.\n\n\"You'll tell me you don't know about L. next,\" he said, bewildered.\n\n\"Language!\" protested Bones.  \"You really mustn't use Sunday words,\nreally you mustn't.\"\n\nThen Jelf unburdened himself.  It appeared that G. had been engaged to\nL.'s daughter, and the engagement had been broken off....\n\nBones stirred uneasily and looked at his watch.\n\n\"Dispense with the jolly old alphabet,\" he said wearily, \"and let us\nget down to the beastly personalities.\"\n\nThereafter Jelf's conversation condensed itself to the limits of a\nhuman understanding.  \"G\" stood for Gregory--Felix Gregory; \"L\" for\nLansing, who apparently had no Christian name, nor found such appendage\nnecessary, since he was dead.  He had invented a lamp, and that lamp\nhad in some way come into Jelf's possession.  He was exploiting the\ninvention on behalf of the inventor's daughter, and had named it--he\nsaid this with great deliberation and emphasis--\"The Tibbetts-Jelf\nMotor Lamp.\"\n\nBones made a disparaging noise, but was interested.\n\nThe Tibbetts-Jelf Lamp was something new in motor lamps.  It was a lamp\nwhich had all the advantages of the old lamp, plus properties which no\nlamp had ever had before, and it had none of the disadvantages of any\nlamp previously introduced, and, in fact, had no disadvantages\nwhatsoever.  So Jelf told Bones with great earnestness.\n\n\"You know me, Tibbetts,\" he said.  \"I never speak about myself, and I'm\nrather inclined to disparage my own point of view than otherwise.\"\n\n\"I've never noticed that,\" said Bones.\n\n\"You know, anyway,\" urged Jelf, \"that I want to see the bad side of\nanything I take up.\"\n\nHe explained how he had sat up night after night, endeavouring to\ndiscover some drawback to the Tibbetts-Jelf Lamp, and how he had rolled\ninto bed at five in the morning, exhausted by the effort.\n\n\"If I could only find one flaw!\" he said.  \"But the ingenious beggar\nwho invented it has not left a single bad point.\"\n\nHe went on to describe the lamp.  With the aid of a lead pencil and a\npiece of Bones's priceless notepaper he sketched the front elevation\nand discoursed upon rays, especially upon ultra-violet rays.\n\nApparently this is a disreputable branch of the Ray family.  If you\ncould only get an ultra-violet ray as he was sneaking out of the lamp,\nand hit him violently on the back of the head, you were rendering a\nservice to science and humanity.\n\nThis lamp was so fixed that the moment Mr. Ultra V. Ray reached the\nthreshold of freedom he was tripped up, pounced upon, and beaten until\nhe (naturally enough) changed colour!\n\nIt was all done by the lens.\n\nJelf drew a Dutch cheese on the table-cloth to Illustrate the point.\n\n\"This light never goes out,\" said Jelf passionately.  \"If you lit it\nto-day, it would be alight to-morrow, and the next day, and so on.  All\nthe light-buoys and lighthouses around England will be fitted with this\nlamp; it will revolutionise navigation.\"\n\nAccording to the exploiter, homeward bound mariners would gather\ntogether on the poop, or the hoop, or wherever homeward bound manners\ngathered, and would chant a psalm of praise, in which the line \"Heaven\nbless the Tibbetts-Jelf Lamp\" would occur at regular intervals.\n\nAnd when he had finished his eulogy, and lay back exhausted by his own\neloquence, and Bones asked, \"But what does it _do_?\" Jelf could have\nkilled him.\n\nUnder any other circumstances Bones might have dismissed his visitor\nwith a lecture on the futility of attempting to procure money under\nfalse pretences.  But remember that Bones was the proprietor of a new\nmotor-car, and thought motor-car and dreamed motor-car by day and by\nnight.  Even as it was, he was framing a conventional expression of\nregret that he could not interest himself in outside property, when\nthere dawned upon his mind the splendid possibilities of possessing\nthis accessory, and he wavered.\n\n\"Anyway,\" he said, \"it will take a year to make.\"\n\nMr. Jelf beamed.\n\n\"Wrong!\" he cried triumphantly.  \"Two of the lamps are just finished,\nand will be ready to-morrow.\"\n\nBones hesitated.\n\n\"Of course, dear old Jelf,\" he said, \"I should like, as an experiment,\nto try them on my car.\"\n\n\"On your car?\"  Jelf stepped back a pace and looked at the other with\nvery flattering interest and admiration.  \"Not your car!  _Have_ you a\ncar?\"\n\nBones said he had a car, and explained it at length.  He even waxed as\nenthusiastic about his machine as had Mr. Jelf on the subject of the\nlamp that never went out.  And Jelf agreed with everything that Bones\nsaid.  Apparently he was personally acquainted with the Carter-Crispley\ncar.  He had, so to speak, grown up with it.  He knew its good points\nand none of its bad points.  He thought the man who chose a car like\nthat must have genius beyond the ordinary.  Bones agreed.  Bones had\nreached the conclusion that he had been mistaken about Jelf, and that\npossibly age had sobered him (it was nearly six months since he had\nperpetrated his last libel).  They parted the best of friends.  He had\nagreed to attend a demonstration at the workshop early the following\nmorning, and Jelf, who was working on a ten per cent. commission basis,\nand had already drawn a hundred on account from the vendors, was there\nto meet him.\n\nIn truth it was a noble lamp--very much like other motor lamps, except\nthat the bulb was, or apparently was, embedded in solid glass.  Its\nprincipal virtue lay in the fact that it carried its own accumulator,\nwhich had to be charged weekly, or the lamp forfeited its title.\n\nMr. Jelf explained, with the adeptness of an expert, how the lamp was\ncontrolled from the dashboard, and how splendid it was to have a light\nwhich was independent of the engine of the car or of faulty\naccumulators, and Bones agreed to try the lamp for a week.  He did more\nthan this: he half promised to float a company for its manufacture, and\ngave Mr. Jelf fifty pounds on account of possible royalties and\ncommission, whereupon Mr. Jelf faded from the picture, and from that\nmoment ceased to take the slightest interest in a valuable article\nwhich should have been more valuable by reason of the fact that it bore\nhis name.\n\nThree days later Hamilton, walking to business, was overtaken by a\nbeautiful blue Carter-Crispley, ornamented, it seemed from a distance,\nby two immense bosses of burnished silver.  On closer examination they\nproved to be nothing more remarkable than examples of the Tibbett-Jelf\nLamp.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bones airily, \"that's the lamp, dear old thing.  Invented\nin leisure hours by self and Jelf.  Step in, and I'll explain.\"\n\n\"Where do I step in,\" asked Hamilton, wilfully dense--\"into the car or\ninto the lamp?\"\n\nBones patiently smiled and waved him with a gesture to a seat by his\nside.  His explanation was disjointed and scarcely informative; for\nBones had yet to learn the finesse of driving, and he had a trick of\nthinking aloud.\n\n\"This lamp, old thing,\" he said, \"never goes out--you silly old josser,\nwhy did you step in front of me?  Goodness gracious!  I nearly cut\nshort your naughty old life\"--(this to one unhappy pedestrian whom\nBones had unexpectedly met on the wrong side of the road)--\"never goes\nout, dear old thing.  It's out now, I admit, but it's not in working\norder--Gosh!  That was a narrow escape!  Nobody but a skilled driver,\nold Hamilton, could have missed that lamp-post.  It is going to create\na sensation; there's nothing like it on the market--whoop!\"\n\nHe brought the car to a standstill with a jerk and within half an inch\nof a City policeman who was directing the traffic with his back turned\nto Bones, blissfully unconscious of the doom which almost overcame him.\n\n\"I like driving with you, Bones,\" said Hamilton, when they reached the\noffice, and he had recovered something of his self-possession.  \"Next\nto stalking bushmen in the wild, wild woods, I know of nothing more\nsoothing to the nerves.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Bones gratefully.  \"I'm not a bad driver, am I?\"\n\n\"'Bad' is not the word I should use alone,\" said Hamilton pointedly.\n\nIn view of the comments which followed, he was surprised and pained to\nreceive on the following day an invitation, couched in such terms as\nleft him a little breathless, to spend the Sunday exploiting the\nbeauties of rural England.\n\n\"Now, I won't take a 'No,'\" said Bones, wagging his bony forefinger.\n\"We'll start at eleven o'clock, dear old Ham, and we'll lunch at\nwhat-you-may-call-it, dash along the thingummy road, and heigho! for\nthe beautiful sea-breezes.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Hamilton curtly.  \"You may dash anywhere you like, but\nI'm dashed if I dash with you.  I have too high a regard for my life.\"\n\n\"Naughty, naughty!\" said Bones, \"I've a good mind not to tell you what\nI was going to say.  Let me tell you the rest.  Now, suppose,\" he said\nmysteriously, \"that there's a certain lady--a jolly old girl named\nVera--ha--ha!\"\n\nHamilton went red.\n\n\"Now, listen, Bones,\" he said; \"we'll not discuss any other person than\nourselves.\"\n\n\"What do you say to a day in the country?  Suppose you asked Miss\nVera----\"\n\n\"Miss Vera Sackwell,\" replied Hamilton a little haughtily, \"if she is\nthe lady you mean, is certainly a friend of mine, but I have no control\nover her movements.  And let me tell you, Bones, that you annoy me\nwhen----\"\n\n\"Hoity, toity!\" said Bones.  \"Heaven bless my heart and soul!  Can't\nyou trust your old Bones?  Why practise this deception, old thing?  I\nsuppose,\" he went on reflectively, ignoring the approaching apoplexy of\nhis partner, \"I suppose I'm one of the most confided-in persons in\nLondon.  A gay old father confessor, Ham, lad.  Everybody tells me\ntheir troubles.  Why, the lift-girl told me this morning that she'd had\nmeasles twice!  Now, out with it, Ham!\"\n\nIf Hamilton had any tender feeling for Miss Vera Sackwell, he was not\ndisposed to unburden himself at that moment.  In some mysterious\nfashion Bones, for the first time in his life, had succeeded in\nreducing him to incoherence.\n\n\"You're an ass, Bones!\" he said angrily and hotly.  \"You're not only an\nass, but an indelicate ass!  Just oblige me by shutting up.\"\n\nBones closed his eyes, smiled, and put out his hand.\n\n\"Whatever doubts I had, dear old Ham,\" he murmured, \"are dispelled.\nCongratulations!\"\n\nThat night Hamilton dined with a fair lady.  She was fair literally and\nfiguratively, and as he addressed her as Vera, it was probably her\nname.  In the course of the dinner he mentioned Bones and his\nsuggestion.  He did not tell all that Bones had said.\n\nThe suggestion of a day's motoring was not received unfavourably.\n\n\"But he can't drive,\" wailed Hamilton.  \"He's only just learnt.\"\n\n\"I want to meet Bones,\" said the girl, \"and I think it a most excellent\nopportunity.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, suppose the beggar upsets us in a ditch?  I really can't\nrisk your life.\"\n\n\"Tell Bones that I accept,\" she said decisively, and that ended the\nmatter.\n\nThe next morning Hamilton broke the news.\n\n\"Miss Sackwell thanks you for your invitation, Bones.\"\n\n\"And accepts, of course?\" said Bones complacently.  \"Jolly old Vera.\"\n\n\"And I say, old man,\" said Hamilton severely, \"will you be kind enough\nto remember not to call this lady Vera until she asks you to?\"\n\n\"Don't be peevish, old boy, don't be jealous, dear old thing.\nBrother-officer and all that.  Believe me, you can trust your old\nBones.\"\n\n\"I'd rather trust the lady's good taste,\" said Hamilton with some\nacerbity.  \"But won't it be a bit lonely for you, Bones?\"\n\n\"But what do you mean, my Othello?\"\n\n\"I mean three is a pretty rotten sort of party,\" said Hamilton.\n\"Couldn't you dig up somebody to go along and make the fourth?\"\n\nBones coughed and was immensely embarrassed.\n\n\"Well, dear old athlete,\" he said unnecessarily loudly, \"I was thinking\nof asking my--er----\"\n\n\"Your--er--what?  I gather it's an er,\" said Hamilton seriously, \"but\nwhich er?\"\n\n\"My old typewriter, frivolous one,\" said Bones truculently.  \"Any\nobjection?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Hamilton calmly.  \"Miss Whitland is a most\ncharming girl, and Vera will be delighted to meet her.\"\n\nBones choked his gratitude and wrung the other's hand for fully two\nminutes.\n\nHe spent the rest of the week in displaying to Hamilton the frank\nambitions of his mind toward Miss Marguerite Whitland.  Whenever he had\nnothing to do--which seemed most of the day--he strolled across to\nHamilton's desk and discoursed upon the proper respect which all\nright-thinking young officers have for old typewriters.  By the end of\nthe week Hamilton had the confused impression that the very pretty girl\nwho ministered to the literary needs of his partner, combined the\nqualities of a maiden aunt with the virtues of a grandmother, and that\nBones experienced no other emotion than one of reverential wonder,\ntinctured with complete indifference.\n\nOn the sixty-fourth lecture Hamilton struck.\n\n\"Of course, dear old thing,\" Bones was saying, \"to a jolly old brigand\nlike you, who dashes madly down from his mountain lair and takes the\nfirst engaging young person who meets his eye----\"\n\nHamilton protested vigorously, but Bones silenced him with a lordly\ngesture.\n\n\"I say, to a jolly old rascal like you it may seem--what is the word?\"\n\n\"'Inexplicable,' I suppose, is the word you are after,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"That's the fellow; you took it out of my mouth,\" said Bones.  \"It\nsounds inexplicable that I can be interested in a platonic, fatherly\nkind of way in the future of a lovely old typewriter.\"\n\n\"It's not inexplicable at all,\" said Hamilton bluntly.  \"You're in love\nwith the girl.\"\n\n\"Good gracious Heavens!\" gasped Bones, horrified.  \"Ham, my dear old\nboy.  Dicky Orum, Dicky Orum, old thing!\"\n\nSunday morning brought together four solemn people, two of whom were\nmen, who felt extremely awkward and showed it, and two of whom behaved\nas though they had known one another all their lives.\n\nBones, who stood alternately on his various legs, was frankly astounded\nthat the meeting had passed off without any sensational happening.  It\nwas an astonishment shared by thousands of men in similar\ncircumstances.  A word of admiration for the car from Vera melted him\nto a condition of hysterical gratitude.\n\n\"It's not a bad old 'bus, dear old--Miss Vera,\" he said, and tut-tutted\naudibly under his breath at his error.  \"Not a bad old 'bus at all,\ndear old--young friend.  Now I'll show you the gem of the collection.\"\n\n\"They are big, aren't they?\" said Vera, properly impressed by the lamps.\n\n\"They never go out,\" said Bones solemnly.  \"I assure you I'm looking\nforward to the return journey with the greatest eagerness--I mean to\nsay, of course, that I'm looking forward to the other journey--I don't\nmean to say I want the day to finish, and all that sort of rot.  In\nfact, dear old Miss Vera, I think we'd better be starting.\"\n\nHe cranked up and climbed into the driver's seat, and beckoned\nMarguerite to seat herself by his side.  He might have done this\nwithout explanation, but Bones never did things without explanation,\nand he turned back and glared at Hamilton.\n\n\"You'd like to be alone, dear old thing, wouldn't you?\" he said\ngruffly.  \"Don't worry about me, dear old lad.  A lot of people say you\ncan see things reflected in the glass screen, but I'm so absorbed in my\ndriving----\"\n\n\"Get on with it!\" snarled Hamilton.\n\nIt was, nevertheless, a perfect day, and Bones, to everybody's\nsurprise, his own included, drove perfectly.  It had been his secret\nintention to drive to Brighton; but nobody suspected this plan, or\ncared very much what his intentions had been, and the car was running\nsmoothly across Salisbury Plain.\n\nWhen they stopped for afternoon tea, Hamilton did remark that he\nthought Bones had said something about Brighton, but Bones just smiled.\nThey left Andover that night in the dusk; but long before the light had\nfaded, the light which was sponsored by Mr. Jelf blazed whitely in the\nlamp that never went out.  And when the dark came Bones purred with\njoy, for this light was a wonderful light.  It flooded the road ahead\nwith golden radiance, and illuminated the countryside, so that distant\nobservers speculated upon its origin.\n\n\"Well, old thing,\" said Bones over his shoulder, \"what do you think of\nthe lamps?\"\n\n\"Simply wonderful, Bones,\" agreed Hamilton.  \"I've never seen anything\nso miraculous.  I can even see that you're driving with one hand.\"\n\nBones brought the other hand up quickly to the wheel and coughed.  As\nfor Miss Marguerite Whitland, she laughed softly, but nobody heard her.\n\nThey were rushing along a country road tree-shaded and high-hedged, and\nBones was singing a little song--when the light went out.\n\nIt went out with such extraordinary unexpectedness, without so much as\na warning flicker, that he was temporarily blinded, and brought the car\nto a standstill.\n\n\"What's up, Bones?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"The light, dear old thing,\" said Bones.  \"I think the jolly old\ntypewriter must have touched the key with her knee.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Hamilton politely; and Bones, remembering that the key\nwas well over on his side of the car, coughed, this time fiercely.\n\nHe switched the key from left to right, but nothing happened.\n\n\"Most extraordinary!\" said Bones.\n\n\"Most,\" said Hamilton.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"I think the road branches off a little way up I'll get down and see\nwhich is the right road to take,\" said Bones with sudden cheerfulness.\n\"I remember seeing the old signpost before the--er--lamp went out.\nPerhaps, Miss Marguerite, you'd like to go for a little walk.\"\n\nMiss Marguerite Whitland said she thought she would, and they went off\ntogether to investigate, leaving Hamilton to speculate upon the\nlikelihood of their getting home that night.\n\nBones walked ahead with Marguerite, and instinctively their hands\nsought and found one another.  They discovered the cross-roads, but\nBones did not trouble to light his match.  His heart was beating with\nextraordinary violence, his lips were dry, he found much difficulty in\nspeaking at all.\n\n\"Miss Marguerite,\" he said huskily, \"don't think I'm an awful outsider\nand a perfect rotter, dear old typewriter.\"\n\n\"Of course I don't,\" she said a little faintly for Bones's arm was\nabout her.\n\n\"Don't think,\" said Bones, his voice trembling, \"that I am a naughty\nold philanderer; but somehow, dear old miss, being alone with you, and\nall that sort of stuff----\"\n\nAnd he bent and kissed her, and at that moment the light that never\nwent out came on again with extraordinary fierceness, as though to make\nup for its temporary absence without leave.\n\nAnd these two young people were focused as in a limelight, and were not\nonly visible from the car, but visible for miles around.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Bones.\n\nThe girl said nothing.  She shaded her eyes from the light as she\nwalked back.  As for Bones, he climbed into the driver's seat with the\ndeliberation of an old gentleman selecting a penny chair in the park,\nand said, without turning his head:\n\n\"It's the road to the left.\"\n\n\"I'm glad,\" said Hamilton, and made no comment even when Bones took the\nroad to the right.\n\nThey had gone a quarter of a mile along this highway when the lamp went\nout.  It went out with as unexpected and startling suddenness as\nbefore.  Bones jingled the key, then turned.\n\n\"You wouldn't like to get out, dear old Ham, and have a look round,\nwould you?\"\n\n\"No, Bones,\" said Hamilton drily.  \"We're quite comfortable.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't like to get down, my jolly old typewriter?\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said Miss Marguerite Whitland with decision.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Bones.  \"Then, under the circumstances, dear old person,\nwe'd all better sit here until----\"\n\nAt that moment the light came on.  It flooded the white road, and the\nwhite road was an excellent wind-screen against which the bending head\nof Bones was thrown into sharp relief.\n\nThe car moved on.  At regular intervals the light that never went out\nforsook its home-loving habits and took a constitutional.  The\noccupants of the ear came to regard its eccentricities with philosophy,\neven though it began to rain, and there was no hood.\n\nOn the outskirts of Guildford, Bones was pulled up by a policeman, who\ntook his name because the lights were too bright.  On the other side of\nGuildford he was pulled up by another policeman because he had no light\nat all.  Passing through Kingston, the lamp began to flicker, sending\nforth brilliant dots and dashes, which continued until they were on\nPutney Common, where the lamp's message was answered from a camp of Boy\nScouts, one signalman of the troop being dragged from his bed for the\npurpose, the innocent child standing in his shirt at the call of duty.\n\n\"A delightful day,\" said Hamilton at parting that night.  (It was\nnearly twelve o'clock.)  \"I'm sorry you've had so much trouble with\nthat lamp, Bones.  What did you call it?\"\n\n\"I say, old fellow,\" said Bones, ignoring the question, \"I hope, when\nyou saw me picking a spider off dear old Miss Marguerite's shoulder,\nyou didn't--er--think anything?\"\n\n\"The only thing I thought was,\" said Hamilton, \"that I didn't see the\nspider.\"\n\n\"Don't stickle, dear old partner,\" said Bones testily.  \"It may have\nbeen an earwig.  Now, as a man of the world, dear old _blas\u00e9_ one, do\nyou think I'd compromise an innocent typewriter?  Do you think I ought\nto----\"  He paused, but his voice was eager.\n\n\"That,\" said Hamilton, \"is purely a question for the lady.  Now, what\nare you going to do with this lamp.  Are you going to float it?\"\n\nBones scowled at the glaring headlight.\n\n\"That depends whether the naughty old things float, Ham,\" he said\nvenomously.  \"If you think they will, my old eye-witness, how about\ntyin' a couple of bricks round 'em before I chuck 'em in.  What?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE BRANCH LINE\n\nNot all the investments of Bones paid dividends.  Some cost him money.\nSome cost him time.  Some--and they were few--cost him both.\n\nSomewhere in a marine store in London lie the battered wrecks of what\nwere once electro-plated motor-lamps of a peculiar and, to Bones,\nsinister design.  They were all that was left of a great commercial\nscheme, based upon the flotation of a lamp that never went out.\n\nOn a day of crisis in Bones's life they had gone out, which was bad.\nThey had come on at an inconvenient moment, which was worse, since they\nhad revealed him and his secretary in tender attitudes.  And Bones had\ngone gaily to right the wrong, and had been received with cold\npoliteness by the lady concerned.\n\nThere was a week of gloom, when Bones adopted towards his invaluable\nassistant the air and manner of one who was in the last stages of a\nwasting disease.  Miss Marguerite Whitland never came into Bones's\noffice without finding him sitting at his desk with his head in his\nhands, except once, when she came in without knocking and Bones hadn't\nthe time to strike that picturesque attitude.\n\nIndeed, throughout that week she never saw him but he was swaying, or\nstanding with his hand before his eyes, or clutching on to the edge of\na chair, or walking with feeble footsteps; and she never spoke to him\nbut he replied with a tired, wan smile, until she became seriously\nalarmed, thinking his brain was affected, and consulted Captain\nHamilton, his partner.\n\n\"Look here, Bones, you miserable devil,\" said Hamilton, \"you're scaring\nthat poor girl.  What the dickens do you mean by it?\"\n\n\"Scaring who?\" said Bones, obviously pleased.  \"Am I really?  Is she\nfearfully cut up, dear old thing?\"\n\n\"She is,\" said Hamilton truthfully.  \"She thinks you're going dotty.\"\n\n\"Vulgarity, vulgarity, dear old officer,\" said Bones, much annoyed.\n\n\"I told her you were often like that,\" Hamilton went on wilfully.  \"I\nsaid that you were a little worse, if anything, after your last love\naffair----\"\n\n\"Heavens!\" nearly screamed Bones.  \"You didn't tell her anything about\nyour lovely old sister Patricia?\"\n\n\"I did not,\" said Hamilton.  \"I merely pointed out to her the fact that\nwhen you were in love you were not to be distinguished from one whom is\nthe grip of measles.\"\n\n\"Then you're a naughty old fellow,\" said Bones.  \"You're a wicked old\nrascal.  I'm surprised at you!  Can't a fellow have a little heart\ntrouble----\"\n\n\"Heart?  Bah!\" said Hamilton scornfully.\n\n\"Heart trouble,\" repeated Bones sternly.  \"I've always had a weak\nheart.\"\n\n\"And a weak head, too,\" said Hamilton.  \"Now, just behave yourself,\nBones, and stop frightening the lady.  I'm perfectly sure she's fond of\nyou--in a motherly kind of way,\" he added, as he saw Bones's face light\nup.  \"And, really, she is such an excellent typist that it would be a\nsin and a shame to frighten her from the office.\"\n\nThis possibility had not occurred to Bones, and it is likely it had\nmore effect than any other argument which Hamilton could use.  That day\nhe began to take an interest in life, stepped gaily into the office and\nas blithely into his secretary's room.  He even made jokes, and dared\ninvite her to tea--an invitation which was declined so curtly that\nBones decided that tea was an unnecessary meal, and cut it out\nforthwith.\n\nAll this time the business of Schemes Limited was going forward, if not\nby leaps and bounds, yet by steady progression.  Perhaps it was the\nrestraining influence that Hamilton exercised which prevented the leaps\nbeing too pronounced and kept the bounds within bounds, so to speak.\nIt was Schemes Limited which bought the theatrical property of the late\nMr. Liggeinstein and re-sold those theatres in forty-eight hours at a\nhandsome profit.  It was Bones who did the buying, and it was Hamilton\nwho did the selling--in this case, to the intense annoyance of Bones,\nwho had sat up the greater part of one night writing a four-act play in\nblank verse, and arriving at the office late, had discovered that his\nchance of acting as his own producer had passed for ever.\n\n\"And I'd written a most wonderful part for you, dear old mademoiselle,\"\nhe said sadly to his secretary.  \"The part where you die in the third\nact--well, really, it brought tears to my jolly old eyes.\"\n\n\"I think Captain Hamilton was very wise to accept the offer of the\nColydrome Syndicate,\" said the girl coldly.\n\nIn his leisure moments Bones had other relaxations than the writing of\npoetry--now never mentioned--or four-act tragedies.  What Hamilton had\nsaid of him was true.  He had an extraordinary nose for a bargain, and\nfound his profits in unexpected places.\n\nPeople got to know him--quite important people, men who handled\nmillions carelessly, like Julius Bohea, and Important Persons whose\nfaces are familiar to the people of Britain, such as the Right Hon.\nGeorge Parkinson Chenney.  Bones met that most influential member of\nthe Cabinet at a very superior dinner-party, where everybody ate\nplovers' eggs as though it were a usual everyday occurrence.\n\nAnd Mr. Parkinson Chenney talked on his favourite subject with great\nease and charm, and his favourite subject was the question of the\nChinese Concession.  Apparently everybody had got concessions in China\nexcept the British, until one of our cleverest diplomatists stepped in\nand procured for us the most amazingly rich coalfield of Wei-hai-tai.\nThe genius and foresight of this diplomatist--who had actually gone to\nChina in the Long Vacation, and of his own initiative and out of his\nown head had evolved these concessions, which were soon to be ratified\nby a special commission which was coming from China--was a theme on\nwhich Mr. Parkinson Chenney spoke with the greatest eloquence.  And\neverybody listened respectfully, because he was a great man.\n\n\"It is not for me,\" said Mr. Parkinson Chenney, toying with the stem of\nhis champagne glass and closing his eyes modestly, \"I say it is not for\nme--thank you, Perkins, I will have just as much as will come up to the\nbrim; thank you, that will do very nicely--to speak boastfully or to\nenlarge unduly upon what I regard as a patriotic effort, and one which\nevery citizen of these islands would in the circumstances have made,\nbut I certainly plume myself upon the acumen and knowledge of the\nsituation which I showed.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said Bones in the pause that followed, and Mr. Parkinson\nChenney beamed.\n\nWhen the dinner was over, and the guests retired to the smoking-room,\nBones buttonholed the minister.\n\n\"Dear old right honourable,\" said Bones, \"may I just have a few words\nin _re_ Chinese coal?\"\n\nThe right honourable gentleman listened, or appeared to listen.  Then\nMr. Parkinson Chenney smiled a recognition to another great man, and\nmoved off, leaving Bones talking.\n\nBones that night was the guest of a Mr. Harold Pyeburt, a City\nacquaintance--almost, it seemed, a disinterested City acquaintance.\nWhen Bones joined his host, Mr. Pyeburt patted him on the back.\n\n\"My dear Tibbetts,\" he said in admiration, \"you've made a hit with\nChenney.  What the dickens did you talk about?\"\n\n\"Oh, coal,\" said Bones vaguely.\n\nHe wasn't quite certain what he had talked about, only he knew that in\nhis mind at dinner there had dawned a great idea.  Was Mr. Pyeburt a\nthought-reader?  Possibly he was.  Or possibly some chance word of his\nhad planted the seed which was now germinating so favourably.\n\n\"Chenney is a man to know,\" he said.  \"He's one of the most powerful\nfellows in the Cabinet.  Get right with him, and you can have a\nknighthood for the asking.\"\n\nBones blushed.\n\n\"A knighthood, dear old broker's man?\" he said, with an elaborate\nshrug.  \"No use to me, my rare old athlete.  Lord Bones--Lord Tibbetts\nI mean--may sound beastly good, but what good is it, eh?  Answer me\nthat.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Mr. Pyeburt.  \"It may be nothing to you, but\nyour wife----\"\n\n\"Haven't a wife, haven't a wife,\" said Bones rapidly, \"haven't a wife!\"\n\n\"Oh, well, then,\" said Mr. Pyeburt, \"it isn't an attractive proposition\nto you, and, after all, you needn't take a knighthood--which, by the\nway, doesn't carry the title of lordship--unless you want to.\n\n\"I've often thought,\" he said, screwing up his forehead, as though in\nthe process of profound cogitation, \"that one of these days some lucky\nfellow will take the Lynhaven Railway off Chenney's hands and earn his\neverlasting gratitude.\"\n\n\"Lynhaven?  Where's that?\" asked Bones.  \"Is there a railway?\"\n\nMr. Pyeburt nodded.\n\n\"Come out on to the balcony, and I'll tell you about it,\" said Pyeburt;\nand Bones, who always wanted telling about things, and could no more\nresist information than a dipsomaniac could refuse drink, followed\nobediently.\n\nIt appeared that Mr. Parkinson Chenney's father was a rich but\neccentric man, who had a grudge against a certain popular seaside\nresort for some obscure reason, and had initiated a movement to found a\nrival town.  So he had started Lynhaven, and had built houses and\nvillas and beautiful assembly rooms; and then, to complete the\nindependence of Lynhaven, he had connected that town with the main\ntraffic line by railway, which he built across eight miles of\nmarshland.  By all the rules of the game, no man can create\nsuccessfully in a spirit of vengeance, and Lynhaven should have been a\nfailure.  It was, indeed, a great success, and repaid Mr. Chenney,\nSenior, handsomely.\n\nBut the railway, it seemed, was a failure, because the rival town had\ncertain foreshore rights, and had employed those to lay a tramway from\ntheir hustling centre; and as the rival town was on the main line, the\nmajority of visitors preferred going by the foreshore route in\npreference to the roundabout branch line route, which was somewhat\nhandicapped by the fact that this, too, connected with the branch line\nat Tolness, a little town which had done great work in the War, but\nwhich did not attract the tourist in days of peace.\n\nThese were the facts about the Lynhaven line, not as they were set\nforth by Mr. Pyeburt--who took a much more optimistic view of the\npossibilities of the railway than did its detractors--but as they\nreally were.\n\n\"It's a fine line, beautifully laid and ballasted,\" said Mr. Pyeburt,\nshaking his head with melancholy admiration.  \"All that it wants behind\nit is a mind.  At present it's neglected; the freights and passenger\nfares are too high, the rolling-stock wants replacing, but the\nlocomotive stock is in most excellent condition.\"\n\n\"Does he want to sell it?\" asked the interested Bones, and Mr. Pyeburt\npursed his lips.\n\n\"It is extremely doubtful,\" he said carefully, \"but I think he might be\napproached.  If he does want to sell it, and you can take it off his\nhands----\"\n\nHe raised his own eyebrows with a significant gesture, which expressed\nin some subtle way that Bones's future was assured.\n\nBones said he would think the matter over, and he did--aloud, in the\npresence of Hamilton.\n\n\"It's a queer proposition,\" said Hamilton.  \"Of course, derelict\nrailways can be made to pay.\"\n\n\"I should be general manager,\" said Bones more thoughtfully still.  \"My\nname would be printed on all the posters, of course.  And isn't there a\nfree pass over all the railways for railway managers?\"\n\n\"I believe there is something of the sort,\" said Hamilton, \"but, on the\nwhole, I think it would be cheaper to pay your fare than to buy a\nrailway to get that privilege.\"\n\n\"There is one locomotive,\" mused Bones.  \"It is called 'Mary Louisa.'\nPyeburt told me about it just as I was going away.  Of course, one\nwould get a bit of a name and all that sort of thing.\"\n\nHe scratched his chin and walked thoughtfully into the office of Miss\nMarguerite Whitland.\n\nShe swung round in her chair and reached for her notebook, but Bones\nwas not in a dictatorial mood.\n\n\"Young miss,\" he asked, \"how do you like Sir Augustus?\"\n\n\"Sir who?\" she demanded, puzzled.\n\n\"Sir Augustus,\" repeated Bones.\n\n\"I think it's very funny,\" she said.\n\nIt was not the answer he expected, and instinctively she knew she had\nmade a mistake.\n\n\"Oh, you're thinking about yourself,\" she said quickly.  \"Are you going\nto be a knight, Mr. Tibbetts?  Oh, how splendid!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted Bones, with fine indifference, \"not bad, dear old miss.\nI'm pretty young, of course, but Napoleon was a general at twenty-two.\"\n\n\"Are you going back into the Army?\" she asked a little hazily, and had\nvisions of Bones at the War Office.\n\n\"I'm talking about railways,\" said Bones firmly.  \"Sir Augustus\nTibbetts--there, now I've said it!\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" said the girl enthusiastically, and her eyes shone with\ngenuine pleasure.  \"I didn't see it in the newspaper, or I would have\ncongratulated you before.\"\n\nBones shifted uneasily.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, dear old miss,\" he said, \"it has not been\ngazetted yet.  I'm merely speaking of the future, dear old impetuous\ntypewriter and future secretary to the Lynhaven Railway Company, and\npossibly dear old Lady----\"  He stopped short with one of his audible\n\"tuts.\"\n\nHappily she could not see the capital \"L\" to the word \"Lady,\" and\nmissed the significance of Bones's interrupted speech.\n\n\nHe saw Mr. Harold Pyeburt at his office, and Mr. Harold Pyeburt had\nseen the Right Hon. Parkinson Chenney, and the right honourable\ngentleman had expressed his willingness to sell the railway, lock,\nstock, and barrel, for sixty thousand pounds.\n\n\"And I advise you\"--Mr. Pyeburt paused, as he thought of a better word\nthan \"disinterestedly\"--\"as a friend, to jump at it.  Parkinson Chenney\nspoke in the highest terms of you.  You evidently made a deep\nimpression upon him.\"\n\n\"Who is the jolly old Parkinson's agent?\" asked Bones, and Mr. Harold\nPyeburt admitted without embarrassment that, as a matter of fact, he\nwas acting as Parkinson's attorney in this matter, and that was why he\nhad been so diffident in recommending the property.  The audacity of\nthe latter statement passed unnoticed by Bones.\n\nIn the end Bones agreed to pay ten per cent. of the purchase price, the\nremainder to be paid after a month's working of the line, if the deal\nwas approved.\n\n\"Clever idea of mine, dear old Ham,\" said Bones.  \"The Honours List\nwill be out in a month, and I can easily chuck it.\"\n\n\"That's about the eighth fellow who's paid a ten per cent. deposit,\"\nsaid Mr. Chenney to his agent.  \"I'll be almost sorry if he takes it.\"\n\nThree weeks later there were two important happenings.  The Prime\nMinister of England, within an hour of leaving for the West of England\nto take a well-earned rest, summoned to him his right-hand man.\n\n\"Chenney,\" he said, \"I really must go away for this rest, and I'm\nawfully sorry I cannot be on hand to meet the Chinese Commission.  Now,\nwhatever you do, you will not fail to meet them at Charing Cross on\ntheir arrival from the Continent.  I believe they are leaving Paris\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"I shall be there,\" said Parkinson Chenney, with a little smile.  \"I\nrather fancy I have managed their coal concession well, Prime Minister.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the Prime Minister, who was not in the mood for\nhanding out bouquets.  \"And would you run down to Tolness and settle up\nthat infernal commission of inquiry?  They've been asking questions in\nthe House, and I can give no very definite reply.  Solebury threatened\nto force a division when the vote came up.  Undoubtedly there's been a\ngreat deal of extravagance, but you may be able to wangle a reasonable\nexplanation.\"\n\n\"Trust me, Prime Minister,\" said Mr. Parkinson Chenney, and left that\nafternoon by special train for Tolness.\n\nOn that very morning Bones, in a pair of overalls and with a rapt\nexpression, stood with his hand on the starting lever of \"Mary Louisa,\"\nand explained to the secretary of the company--she also wore white\noveralls and sat in the cab of the engine--just how simple a matter it\nwas to drive a locomotive.\n\nFor two glorious days Bones had driven the regular service between\nLynhaven and Bayham Junction, where the lines met.  He had come to know\nevery twist and turn of the road, every feature of the somewhat\nfeatureless landscape, and the four passengers who travelled regularly\nevery day except Sundays--there was no Sunday service--were now so\nfamiliar to him that he did not trouble to take their tickets.\n\nThe Lynhaven Railway system was not as elaborate as he had thought.  He\nhad been impressed by the number of railway trucks which stood in the\nsiding at the terminus, but was to discover that they did not belong to\nthe railway, the rolling stock of which consisted of \"Mary Louisa,\" an\nasthmatic but once famous locomotive, and four weather-beaten coaches.\nThe remainder of the property consisted of a half right in a bay\nplatform at Bayham Junction and the dilapidated station building at\nLynhaven, which was thoughtfully situated about two miles from the town.\n\nNobody used the railway; that was the stark truth borne in upon\nMarguerite Whitland.  She recognised, with a sense of dismay, the\nextraordinary badness of the bargain which Bones had made.  Bones, with\na real locomotive to play with--he had given the aged engine-driver a\nweek's holiday--saw nothing but the wonderful possibilities of pulling\nlevers and making a mass of rusting machinery jerk asthmatically\nforward at the touch of his hand.\n\n\"There are a lot of people,\" said Bones, affectionately patting a steam\npipe, \"a lot of people,\" he said, after sucking his fingers, for the\nsteam was extraordinarily hot, \"who think poor old 'Mary Louisa' is\ndone for.  Believe me, dear old miss, this locomotive wants a jolly lot\nof beating, she does really.  I haven't tried her full out--have I,\njolly old stoker?\"\n\nThe jolly old stoker, aged seventeen, shook a grimy face.\n\n\"And don't you try, neither,\" he said ominously.  \"Old George, he never\ntakes her more than quarter speed, he don't.\"\n\n\"Do you hear, dear old miss?\" said Bones triumphantly.  \"Not more than\nquarter speed.  I tell you I could make enough money out of this engine\nalone to pay the whole cost of the railway.\n\n\"What about giving engine-driving lessons?  That's an idea!  And what\nabout doing wonderful cinema pictures?  That's another idea!  Thrilling\nrescues from the train; jolly old hero struggling like mad on the roof\nof the carriage; railway collisions, and so forth, and so on.\"\n\n\"You can't have a collision unless you've two engines,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said the optimistic Bones, \"we could perhaps borrow an\nengine from the Great Northern.\"\n\nHe looked down at the girl, then looked at his watch.\n\n\"Time to be up and doing, dear old thing,\" he said, and looked back\nalong the little train.  The aged guard was sitting on a barrow, his\nnodding head testifying to the sleep-giving qualities of Lynhaven air.\nBones jerked the whistle, there was an unearthly shriek, and the guard\nwoke up.  He looked at his watch, yawned, searched the train for\npassengers, waved his flag, and climbed into his little compartment.\n\nThe engine shrieked again.  Bones pulled over the lever gently, and\nthere was a gratifying chuck-chuck-chuck.  Bones smiled down at the\ngirl.\n\n\"Easy as shelling peas, dear old thing,\" he said, \"and this time I'm\ngoing to show you just how she can go.\"\n\n\"Old Joe don't let her go more than quarter speed,\" said the diminutive\nstoker warningly.\n\n\"Blow old Joe!\" said Bones severely.  \"He's a jolly unenterprising old\nengine-driver.  That's why the naughty old line doesn't pay.  The idea\nof running 'Mary Louisa' at quarter speed!\"\n\nHe turned to the girl for approval, but she felt that, in the\ncircumstances and with only the haziest knowledge of engineering, it\nwould be wiser to offer no opinion.\n\nBones pushed the lever a little farther over, and the \"Mary Louisa\"\nreeled under the shock.\n\n\"In _re_ knighthood, dear old miss,\" said Bones confidentially.  His\nwords came jerkily, because the footplate of an outraged locomotive\npounding forward at an unaccustomed speed was not a good foundation for\ncontinued eloquence.  \"Rendering the jolly old country a\nservice--helping the Cabinet--dear old Chenney awfully fond of me----\"\n\n\"Aren't we going rather fast?\" said the girl, gripping the side of the\ncab for support.\n\n\"Not at all,\" jerked Bones, \"not at all.  I am going to show 'em just\nhow this----\"\n\nHe felt a touch on his arm, and looked down at the diminutive stoker.\n\n\"There's a lot of sand round here,\" said the melancholy child; \"it\nwon't hurt you to jump I'm going to.\"\n\n\"Jump!\" gasped Bones.  \"What do you mean?  Hey!  Don't do that, you\nsilly young----\"\n\nBut his black-visaged assistant was already poised on the step of the\nengine, and Bones, looking back, saw him performing somersaults down a\nsandy slope.  Bones looked at the girl in amazement.\n\n\"Suicide, dear old miss!\" he said in an awed voice.  \"Terrible!\"\n\n\"Isn't that a station?\" said the girl, more interested for the moment\nin her own future.\n\nBones peered through the windows ahead.\n\n\"That's the junction, dear old thing,\" he said.  \"This is where we stop\nher.\"\n\nHe tugged at the lever, but the lever was not to be moved.  He tugged\ndesperately, but it seemed the steel bar was riveted in position.  The\n\"Mary Louisa\" was leaping along at an incredible speed, and less than\nfive hundred yards away was the dead-end of the Bayham platform, into\nwhich the Lynhaven train was due to run.\n\nBones went white and looked at the girl with fearful eyes.  He took a\nswift scrutiny to the left and right, but they had passed out of the\nsandy country, and any attempt to leave the train now would mean\ncertain destruction.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe Right Honourable Mr. Parkinson Chenney had concluded a very\nsatisfactory morning's work of inspection at Tolness, and had secured\nall the information he needed to answer any question which might be put\nto him in Parliament by the best-informed of questioners.\n\nHe was lunching with the officers of the small garrison, when a\ntelephone message was brought to him.  He read it and smiled.\n\n\"Good!\" he said.  \"Gentlemen, I am afraid I have to leave you a little\nearlier than I expected.  Colonel Wraggle, will you see that my special\ntrain is ready!  I must leave in ten minutes.  The Chinese Commission\nhas arrived,\" he said impressively, \"or, rather, it arrives in London\nthis afternoon, and I am deputed by the Prime Minister----\"\n\nHe explained to his respectful audience just what part he had played in\nsecuring Chinese Coal Concessions.  He made a little speech on the\nimmense value to the Empire in particular and the world in general of\nthese new coalfields which had been secured to the country through the\nacumen, genius, forethought, and patriotic disinterestedness of the\nCabinet.\n\nHe would not claim to set any particular merit on his own action, and\nwent on to claim it.  By which time his train was ready.  It was indeed\nvital that he should be in London to meet a commission which had shown\nsuch reluctance to trade with foreign devils, and had been, moreover,\nso punctilious in its demand for ceremonious receptions, but he had not\nthe slightest doubt about his ability to reach London before the boat\ntrain arrived.  He had two and a half hours, and two and a half hours\ngave him an ample margin of time.\n\nJust before his special rounded the bend which brought it within sight\nof Bayham Junction the Lynhaven express had reached within a few\nhundred yards of annihilation.  The signalman at Bayham Junction had\nwatched the oncoming rush of Bones's train, and, having a fairly\nextensive knowledge of the \"Mary Louisa\" and her eccentricities, he\nrealised just what had happened.\n\nThere was only one thing to be done.  He could see the smoke from the\nCabinet Minister's special rising above the cutting two miles away, and\nhe threw over two levers simultaneously.  The first set the points\nwhich brought the Lynhaven express on to the main line, switching it\nfrom the deadly bay wherein the runaway train would have been smashed\nto pieces; the second lever set the distant signal against the special.\nIt was a toss-up whether the special had not already passed the distant\nsignal, but he had to take that risk.\n\nBones, with his arm round the girl, awaiting a noisy and violent\ndissolution, felt the \"Mary Louisa\" sway to the right when it should\nhave swayed to the left, heard the clang of the points as he passed\nthem, and drew a long breath when he found himself headed along a\nstraight clear stretch of line.  It was some time before he found his\nvoice, and then it was little more than a squeak.\n\n\"We're going to London, dear old thing,\" he said tremulously.\n\nThe girl smiled, though her face was deathly pale.\n\n\"I thought we were going to heaven,\" she said.\n\n\"Never, dear old thing,\" said Bones, recovering something of his\nspirits as he saw the danger past.  \"Old Bones will never send you\nthere.\"\n\nThe problem of the \"Mary Louisa\" was still unsettled.  She was tearing\naway like a Flying Dutchman.  She was oozing steam at every pore, and,\nglancing back, Bones saw the agitated countenance of the aged guard\nthrust through the window.  He waved frantically at Bones, and Bones\nwaved genially back again.\n\nHe was turning back to make another attempt on the lever, when, looking\npast the guard, he saw a sight which brought his heart into his mouth.\nPounding along behind him, and emitting feathers of steam from her\nwhistle, was an enormous locomotive.  Bones guessed there was a train\nbehind it, but the line was too straight for him to see.\n\n\"Gracious heavens!\" he gasped.  \"We're being chased!\"\n\nHe jerked at the lever--though it was a moment when he should have left\nit severely alone--and to his ill-founded joy it moved.\n\nThe two trains came to a standstill together ten miles from Bayham\nJunction, and Bones climbed down into the six-foot way and walked back.\n\nAlmost the first person he met was a gesticulating gentleman in a frock\ncoat and with a red face, who, mistaking him for an engine-driver,\ndismissed him on the spot, threatened him with imprisonment--with or\nwithout hard labour he did not specify--and demanded what the dickens\nhe meant by holding up a Cabinet Minister?\n\n\"Why,\" chortled Bones, \"isn't it my dear friend, Mr. Chenney?\"\n\n\"Who are you,\" snarled Mr. Chenney, \"and what do you mean by calling me\nyour dear friend?  By Heavens, I'll have you kicked out of this\nservice!\"\n\n\"Don't you know old Tibbetts?\" cooed Bones.  \"Well, well, fancy meeting\nyou!\"\n\nHe held out a grimy hand, which was not taken.\n\n\"Tibbetts!\" growled the gentleman.  \"Oh, you are the foo--the gentleman\nwho bought the Lynhaven line, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Bones.\n\n\"But what is your train doing here?\" asked Mr. Chenney violently.\n\"Don't you realise you are holding up a special?  Great Heavens, man,\nthis is very serious!  You are holding up the business of the country!\"\n\nThe engine-driver of the special came to the rescue.\n\n\"There's a switch-over about half a mile further on,\" he said.\n\"There's not a down train due for an hour.  I'll unlock the switch and\nput you on to the other line, and, after we have passed, you can come\non.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to come on, dear old thing,\" said Bones.  \"I want to\ngo back.\"\n\n\"Well, that's simple,\" said the driver.\n\nHe it was who piloted the Lynhaven express for another half-mile up the\nroad.  He it was who found the switches, unlocked them, telegraphed to\nthe next station to hold up traffic, and he it was--Bones insisted upon\nthis--who brought the \"Mary Louisa\" along the switch to the down line.\n\nThe position was as follows: The \"Mary Louisa\" was on the down line.\nTwo coaches were between the down and the up line, and the guard's van\nwas exactly on the up line, when the \"Mary Louisa\" refused to work any\nfurther.\n\nNeither the experienced engine-driver, nor Bones, nor the stoker of the\nspecial, nor Mr. Chenney, nor the ancient guard, could coax the \"Mary\nLouisa\" to move another yard.  The Lynhaven express stretched across\nboth lines and made all further progress for traffic impossible.\n\nThree hours later a breakdown gang arrived and towed the \"Mary Louisa\"\nand her appendages back to Bayham Junction.\n\nBones and the girl went back to London by the last train, and Bones was\nvery thoughtful and silent.\n\nBut Bones was ever an optimist.  The next morning he saw on a newspaper\nplacard: \"Birthday Honours.  Twenty-two New Knights.\"  And he actually\nstopped his car, bought a paper, and searched the lists for his name.\nIt was not there.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nA STUDENT OF MEN\n\nMr. Jackson Hyane was one of those oldish-looking young men to whom the\ndescription of \"man about town\" most naturally applied.  He was always\nwell-dressed and correctly dressed.  You saw him at first nights.  He\nwas to be seen in the paddock at Ascot--it was a shock to discover that\nhe had not the Royal Enclosure badge on the lapel of his coat--and he\nwas to be met with at most of the social functions, attendance at which\ndid not necessarily imply an intimate acquaintance with the leaders of\nSociety, yet left the impression that the attendant was, at any rate,\nin the swim, and might very well be one of the principal swimmers.\n\nHe lived off Albemarle Street in a tiny flat, and did no work of any\nkind whatever.  His friends, especially his new friends, thought he\n\"had a little money,\" and knew, since he told them, that he had\nexpectations.  He did not tell them that his expectations were largely\nbound up in their credulity and faith in his integrity.  Some of them\ndiscovered that later, but the majority drifted out of his circle\npoorer without being wiser, for Mr. Hyane played a wonderful game of\npiquet, and seemed to be no more than abnormally lucky.\n\nHis mother had been a Miss Whitland, his father was the notorious\nColonel Hyane, who boasted that his library was papered with High Court\nwrits, and who had had the distinction of being escorted from Monte\nCarlo by the police of the Principality.\n\nMr. Jackson Hyane was a student of men and affairs.  Very little\nescaped his keen observation, and he had a trick of pigeon-holing\npossibilities of profit, and forgetting them until the moment seemed\nripe for their exploitation.  He was tall and handsome, with a smile\nwhich was worth at least five thousand pounds a year to him, for it\nadvertised his boyish innocence and enthusiasm--he who had never been\neither a boy or enthusiastic.\n\nOne grey October day he put away his pass-book into a drawer and locked\nit, and took from a mental pigeon-hole the materials of an immature\nscheme.  He dressed himself soberly and well, strolled down into\nPiccadilly, and calling a cab, drove to the block of City buildings\nwhich housed the flourishing business of Tibbetts and Hamilton, Limited.\n\nThe preliminaries to this invasion had been very carefully settled.  He\nhad met Miss Marguerite Whitland by \"accident\" a week before, had\ncalled at her lodgings with an old photograph of her father, which he\nhad providentially discovered, and had secured from her a somewhat\nreluctant acceptance of an invitation to lunch.\n\nBones looked up from his desk as the debonair young man strolled in.\n\n\"You don't know me, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Jackson Hyane, flashing his\nfamous smile.  \"My name is Hyane.\"\n\nIt was his first meeting with Bones, but by no means the first time\nthat Jackson had seen him.\n\n\"My dear old Hyane, sit down,\" said Bones cheerfully.  \"What can we do\nfor you?\"\n\nMr. Hyane laughed.\n\n\"There's nothing you can do for me, except to spare your secretary for\nan hour longer than she usually takes.\"\n\n\"My secretary?\" said Bones quickly, and shot a suspicious glance at the\nvisitor.\n\n\"I mean Miss Whitland,\" said Hyane easily.  \"She is my cousin, you\nknow.  My mother's brother was her father.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Bones a little stiffly.\n\nHe felt a sense of the strongest resentment against the late Professor\nWhitland.  He felt that Marguerite's father had played rather a low\ntrick on him in having a sister at all, and Mr. Hyane was too keen a\nstudent to overlook Bones's obvious annoyance.\n\n\"Yes,\" he went on carelessly, \"we are quite old friends, Marguerite and\nI, and you can't imagine how pleased I am that she has such an\nexcellent job as this.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Bones, clearing his throat.  \"Very nice old--very good\ntypewriter indeed, Mr. Hyane ... very nice person ... ahem!\"\n\nMarguerite, dressed for the street, came in from her office at that\nmoment, and greeted her cousin with a little nod, which, to the\ndistorted vision of Bones, conveyed the impression of a lifelong\nfriendship.\n\n\"I have just been asking Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Hyane, \"if he could spare\nyou for an extra hour.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that can't----\" the girl began.\n\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\" said Bones, raising his voice as he invariably\ndid when he was agitated.  \"Certainly, my dear old--er--my dear\nyoung--er--certainly, Miss Marguerite, by all means, take your cousin\nto the Zoo ...  I mean show him the sights.\"\n\nHe was patently agitated, and watched the door close on the two young\npeople with so ferocious a countenance that Hamilton, a silent observer\nof the scene, could have laughed.\n\nBones walked slowly back to his desk as Hamilton reached for his hat.\n\n\"Come on, Bones,\" he said briskly.  \"It's lunch time.  I had no idea it\nwas so late.\"\n\nBut Bones shook his head.\n\n\"No, thank you, dear old thing,\" he said sadly.  \"I'd rather not, if\nyou don't mind.\"\n\n\"Aren't you coming to lunch?\" asked Hamilton, astonished.\n\nBones shook his head.\n\n\"No, dear old boy,\" he said hollowly.  \"Ask the girl to send me up a\nstiff glass of soda-water and a biscuit--I don't suppose I shall eat\nthe biscuit.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Hamilton.  \"Half an hour ago you were telling me you\ncould eat a cart-horse.\"\n\n\"Not now, old Ham,\" said Bones.  \"If you've ordered it, send it back.\nI hate cart-horses, anyway.\"\n\n\"Come along,\" wheedled Hamilton, dropping his hand on the other's\nshoulder.  \"Come and eat.  Who was the beautiful boy?\"\n\n\"Beautiful boy?\" laughed Bones bitterly.  \"A fop, dear old Ham!  A\ntailor's dummy!  A jolly old clothes-horse--that's what he was.  I\nsimply loathe these people who leap around the City for a funeral.\nIt's not right, dear old thing.  It's not manly, dear old sport.  What\nthe devil did her father have a sister for?  I never knew anything\nabout it.\"\n\n\"They ought to have told you,\" said Hamilton sympathetically.  \"Now\ncome and have some food.\"\n\nBut Bones refused.  He was adamant.  He would sit there and starve.  He\ndid not say as much, but he hinted that, when Hamilton returned, his\nfamished and lifeless form would be found lying limply across the desk.\nHamilton went out to lunch alone, hurried through his meal, and came\nback to find Bones alive but unhappy.\n\nHe sat making faces at the table, muttering incoherent words,\ngesticulating at times in the most terrifying manner, and finally threw\nhimself back into his deep chair, his hands thrust into his trousers\npockets, the picture of dejection and misery.\n\nIt was three o'clock when Miss Marguerite Whitland returned breathless,\nand, to Bones's jealous eye, unnecessarily agitated.\n\n\"Come, come, dear old miss,\" he said testily.  \"Bring your book.  I\nwish to dictate an important letter.  Enjoyed your lunch?\"\n\nThe last question was asked in so threatening a tone that the girl\nalmost jumped.\n\n\"Yes--no,\" she said.  \"Not very much really.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" said Bones, insultingly sceptical, and she went red, flounced\ninto her room, and returned, after five minutes, a haughty and distant\nyoung woman.\n\n\"I don't think I want to dictate, dear old--dear young typewriter,\" he\nsaid unhappily.  \"Leave me, please.\"\n\n\"Really, my dear Bones,\" protested Hamilton, when the girl had gone\nback, scarlet-faced to her office, \"you're making a perfect ass of\nyourself.  If a girl cannot go to lunch with her cousin----\"\n\nBones jumped up from his chair, shrugged his shoulders rapidly, and\nforced a hideous grin.\n\n\"What does it matter to me, dear old Ham?\" he asked.  \"Don't think I'm\nworried about a little thing like a typewriter going out to lunch.\nPooh!  Absurd!  Tommy rot!  No, my partner, I don't mind--in fact, I\ndon't care a----\"\n\n\"Jot,\" said Hamilton, with the gesture of an outraged bishop.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Bones wildly.  \"What does it matter to me?\nDelighted that young typewriter should have a cousin, and all that sort\nof thing!\"\n\n\"Then what the dickens is the matter with you?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Bones, and laughed more wildly than ever.\n\nRelationships between Mr. Augustus Tibbetts, Managing Director of\nSchemes Limited, and Miss Marguerite Whitland, his heaven-sent\nsecretary, were strained to the point of breaking that afternoon.  She\nwent away that night without saying good-bye, and Bones, in a condition\nof abject despair, walked home to Devonshire Street, and was within a\ndozen yards of his flat, when he remembered that he had left his\nmotor-car in the City, and had to take a cab back to fetch it.\n\n\"Bones,\" said Hamilton the next morning, \"do you realise the horrible\ngloom which has come over this office?\"\n\n\"Gloom, dear old Ham?\" said the dark-eyed Bones.  He had spent the\nnight writing letters to Marguerite, and had exhausted all the\nstationery in sight in the process.  \"Gloom, old thing!  Good gracious,\nno!  Nobody is gloomy here!\"\n\n\"I can tell you somebody who is,\" said Hamilton grimly.  \"That\nunfortunate girl you've been barking at all the morning----\"\n\n\"Barking at her?\" gasped Bones.  \"Gracious Heavens, I haven't betrayed\nmy worried condition of mind, dear old thing?  I thought I hid it\nrather well.\"\n\n\"What on earth are you worried about?\" asked Hamilton, and Bones\nshrugged.\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" he said.  \"Nothing at all.  A little fever, dear old\nthing, contracted in the service of King--God bless him!--and country.\"\n\nHamilton's words had this effect, that he brightened visibly, and for\nthe rest of the morning was almost normal.  His spirits took a quick\ndownward turn at five minutes to one, when the debonair Mr. Hyane\nappeared most unexpectedly.\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll think I'm a most awful nuisance, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he\nsaid, \"but there are so many things which I must really talk to my\ncousin about--family affairs, you know.\"\n\n\"Don't apologise,\" said Bones gruffly.\n\n\"I shan't keep her beyond the hour,\" smiled Mr. Hyane.  \"I realise that\nyou are a very busy man.\"\n\nBones said nothing, and when Marguerite Whitland appeared, he had\ngained sufficient control of his emotions to indulge in a feeble jest.\nThe girl's face was a study at the sight of her cousin.  Hamilton, a\ndisinterested observer, read astonishment, annoyance, and resignation\nin the wide-opened eyes.  Bones, who prided himself upon a working\nknowledge of physiognomy, diagnosed the same symptoms as conveying a\ndeep admiration combined with the re-awakening of a youthful love.\n\n\"Hello, Jackson!\" she said coldly.  \"I didn't expect to see you.\"\n\n\"I told you I would call,\" he smiled.  \"I must see you, Marguerite, and\nMr. Tibbetts has been so kind that I am sure he will not mind me----\"\n\n\"Mr. Tibbetts is not concerned about the manner in which I spend my\nlunch hour,\" she said stiffly, and Bones groaned inwardly.\n\nThere was a silence which Hamilton had not the heart to break after the\ntwo had gone, and it was Bones who uttered the first comment.\n\n\"That's that,\" he said, and his voice was so quiet and normal that\nHamilton stared at him in astonishment.\n\n\"Let's have lunch,\" said Bones briskly, and led the way out.\n\nNot even when Miss Whitland came to him that afternoon and asked for\npermission to take two days' holiday did his manner change.  With a\ncourtesy entirely free from that extravagance to which she had grown\naccustomed, he acceded to her request, and she was on the point of\nexplaining to him the reason she had so unexpectedly asked for a\nvacation, but the memory of his earlier manner checked her.\n\nIt was a very simple explanation.  Jackson Hyane was a very plausible\nman.  Marguerite Whitland had heard something of her erratic cousin,\nbut certainly nothing in his manner supported the more lurid\ndescriptions of his habits.  And Mr. Jackson Hyane had begged her, in\nthe name of their relationships, to take a trip to Aberdeen to examine\ntitle-deeds which, he explained, would enable her to join with him in\nan action of the recovery of valuable Whitland property which was in\ndanger of going to the Crown, and she had consented.\n\nThe truth was, there had always been some talk in the family of these\nestates, though nobody knew better than Jackson Hyane how unsubstantial\nwere the claims of the Whitlands to the title.  But the Scottish estate\nhad been docketed away in the pigeon-holes of his mind, and promised to\nbe more useful than he had anticipated.\n\nThat afternoon he packed his bag at his flat, put his passport and\nrailway tickets together in his inside pocket, and made his final\npreparations for departure.\n\nAn old crony of his called whilst he was drinking the cup of tea which\nthe housekeeper of the flats had prepared, and took in the situation\nrevealed by the packed suit-cases and the burnt papers in the hearth.\n\n\"Hello, Johnny!\" he said.  \"You're getting out, eh?\"\n\nJackson nodded.  There was no need to pretend anything with one of his\nown class.\n\n\"Couldn't you square the bank?\"\n\nJackson shook his head.\n\n\"No, Billy,\" he said cheerfully, \"I couldn't square it.  At this\nidentical moment there are several eminent people in the West End of\nLondon who are making applications for warrants.\"\n\n\"Dud cheques, eh?\" asked the other thoughtfully.  \"Well, it had to\ncome, Johnny.  You've had a lot of bad luck.\"\n\n\"Atrocious,\" said Mr. Jackson Hyane.  \"There's plenty of money in Town,\nbut it's absolutely impossible to get at it.  I haven't touched a mug\nfor two months, and I've backed more seconds than I care to think\nabout.  Still,\" he mused, \"there's a chance.\"\n\nHis friends nodded.  In their circle there was always \"a chance,\" but\nhe could not guess that that chance which the student of men, Mr.\nJackson Hyane, was banking upon answered indifferently to the name of\nTibbetts or Bones.\n\nAt half-past eight that night he saw his cousin off from King's Cross.\nHe had engaged a sleeper for her, and acted the part of dutiful\nrelative to the life, supplying her with masses of literature to while\naway the sleepless hours of the journey.\n\n\"I feel awfully uncomfortable about going away,\" said the girl, in a\ntroubled voice.  \"Mr. Tibbetts would say that he could spare me even if\nhe were up to his eyes in work.  And I have an uncomfortable feeling at\nthe back of my mind that there was something I should have told\nhim--and didn't.\"\n\n\"Queer bird, Tibbetts!\" said the other curiously.  \"They call him\nBones, don't they?\"\n\n\"I never do,\" said the girl quietly; \"only his friends have that\nprivilege.  He is one of the best men I have ever met.\"\n\n\"Sentimental, quixotic, and all that sort of thing, eh?\" said Jackson,\nand the girl flushed.\n\n\"He has never been sentimental with me,\" she said, but did not deceive\nthe student of men.\n\nWhen the train had left the station, he drove straightaway to\nDevonshire Street.  Bones was in his study, reading, or pretending to\nread, and the last person he expected to see that evening was Mr.\nJackson Hyane.  But the welcome he gave to that most unwelcome visitor\nbetrayed neither his distrust nor his frank dislike of the young\nwell-groomed man in evening-dress who offered him his hand with such a\ngesture of good fellowship.\n\n\"Sit down, Mr.--er----\" said Bones.\n\nThere was a cold, cold feeling at his heart, a sense of coming\ndisaster, but Bones facing the real shocks and terrors of life was a\ndifferent young man from the Bones who fussed and fumed over its\ntrifles.\n\n\"I suppose you wonder why I have come to see you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said\nHyane, taking a cigarette from the silver box on the table.  \"I rather\nwonder why I have the nerve to see you myself.  I've come on a very\ndelicate matter.\"\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Bones a little huskily, and he knew instinctively what\nthat delicate matter was.\n\n\"It is about Marguerite,\" said Mr. Hyane.\n\nBones inclined his head.\n\n\"You see, we have been great pals all our lives,\" went on Jackson\nHyane, pulling steadily at the cigarette--\"in fact, sweethearts.\"\n\nHis keen eyes never left the other's face, and he read all he wanted to\nknow.\n\n\"I am tremendously fond of Marguerite,\" he went on, \"and I think I am\nnot flattering myself when I say that Marguerite is tremendously fond\nof me.  I haven't been especially fortunate, and I have never had the\nmoney which would enable me to offer Marguerite the kind of life which\na girl so delicately nurtured should have.\"\n\n\"Very admirable,\" said Bones, and his voice came to his own ears as the\nvoice of a stranger.\n\n\"A few days ago,\" Mr. Hyane went on, \"I was offered a tea plantation\nfor fourteen thousand pounds.  The prospects were so splendid that I\nwent to a financier who is a friend of mine, and he undertook to\nprovide the money, on which, of course, I agreed to pay an interest.\nThe whole future, which had been so black, suddenly became as bright as\nday.  I came to Marguerite, as you saw, with the news of my good luck,\nand asked her if she would be my wife.\"\n\nBones said nothing; his face was a mask.\n\n\"And now I come to my difficulty, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Hyane.  \"This\nafternoon Marguerite and I played upon you a little deception which I\nhope you will forgive.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly\" mumbled Bones, and gripped the arms of his chair\nthe tighter.\n\n\"When I took Marguerite to lunch to-day,\" said Hyane, \"it was to\nbe--married.\"\n\n\"Married!\" repeated Bones dully, and Mr. Hyane nodded.\n\n\"Yes, we were married at half-past one o'clock to-day at the Marylebone\nRegistry Office, and I was hoping that Marguerite would be able to tell\nyou her good news herself.  Perhaps\"--he smiled--\"it isn't as good news\nto her as it is to me.  But this afternoon a most tragic thing\nhappened.\"\n\nHe threw away his cigarette, rose, and paced the room with agitated\nstrides.  He had practised those very strides all that morning, for he\nleft nothing to chance.\n\n\"At three o'clock this afternoon I called upon my financier friend, and\ndiscovered that, owing to heavy losses which he had incurred on the\nStock Exchange, he was unable to keep his promise.  I feel terrible,\nMr. Tibbetts!  I feel that I have induced Marguerite to marry me under\nfalse pretences.  I had hoped to-morrow morning to have gone to the\nagents of the estate and placed in their hands the cheque for fourteen\nthousand pounds, and to have left by the next mail boat for India.\"\n\nHe sank into the chair, his head upon his hands, and Bones watched him\ncuriously.\n\nPresently, and after an effort, Bones found his voice.\n\n\"Does your--your--wife know?\" he asked.\n\nJackson shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he groaned, \"that's the terrible thing about it.  She hasn't the\nslightest idea.  What shall I tell her?  What shall I tell her?\"\n\n\"It's pretty rotten, old--Mr. Hyane.\"  Bones found his voice after a\nwhile.  \"Deuced rotten for the young miss--for Mrs.--for her.\"\n\nHe did not move from his chair, nor relax his stiff expression.  He was\nhurt beyond his own understanding, frantically anxious to end the\ninterview, but at a loss to find an excuse until his eyes fell upon the\nclock over the mantelpiece.\n\n\"Come back at ten--no, half-past ten, young Mr. ... awfully busy now\n... see you at half-past ten, eh?\"\n\nMr. Hyane made a graceful exit, and left Bones alone with the shattered\nfragments of great romance.\n\nSo that was why she had gone off in such a hurry, and she had not dared\nto tell him.  But why not?  He was nothing to her ... he would never\nsee her again!  The thought made him cold.  Never again!  Never again!\nHe tried to summon that business fortitude of his, of which he was so\nproud.  He wanted some support, some moral support in this moment of\nacute anguish.  Incidentally he wanted to cry, but didn't.\n\nShe ought to have given him a week's notice, he told himself fiercely,\nthan laughed hysterically at the thought.  He considered the matter\nfrom all its aspects and every angle, and was no nearer to peace of\nmind when, at half-past ten to the second, Mr. Jackson Hyane returned.\n\nBut Bones had formed one definite conclusion, and had settled upon the\naction he intended taking.  Mr. Hyane, entering the study, saw the\ncheque book on the desk, and was cheered.  Bones had to clear his voice\nseveral times before he could articulate.\n\n\"Mr. Hyane,\" he said huskily, \"I have been thinking matters out.  I am\na great admirer of yours--of your--of yours--a tremendous admirer of\nyours, Mr. Hyane.  Anything that made her happy, old Mr. Hyane, would\nmake me happy.  You see?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Mr. Hyane, and he had the satisfaction of knowing that\nhe, a student of men, had not misread his victim.\n\n\"Fourteen thousand pounds,\" said Bones, turning abruptly to the desk\nand seizing his pen.  \"Make it payable to you?\"\n\n\"You're too kind,\" murmured Hyane.  \"Make it an open cheque, Mr.\nTibbetts--I have to pay the agents in cash.  These Indian merchants are\nso suspicious.\"\n\nBones wrote the cheque rapidly, marked it \"Pay Cash,\" and initialled\nthe corrections, then tore the slip from the book and handed it to the\nother.\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Hyane reverentially, \"I regard half\nthis as a loan to me and half as a loan to my dear wife.  We shall\nnever forget your kindness.\"\n\n\"Rot!\" said Bones.  \"Nonsense!  I hope you'll be happy, and will you\ntell her----\"  He swallowed something.\n\nThere was a faint tinkle of a bell in the hall, and Ali, his servant,\npoked an ebony face round the corner of the door.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"the telephonic apparatus demands conversation.\"\n\nBones was glad of the interruption, and, with a muttered apology to his\ngratified guest, he strode out into the hall.  Ali had accustomed\nhimself to answering the telephone, but this time he had not understood\nthe preliminary inquiry from exchange.\n\n\"Hello!\" said Bones into the transmitter.\n\n\"Who's that?\"\n\nAt the sound of the voice which answered him he nearly dropped the\nreceiver.\n\n\"Is that Mr. Tibbetts?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bones hoarsely, and his heart beat a wild rataplan.\n\n\"I'm speaking from York, Mr. Tibbetts.  I wanted to tell you that the\nkey of the safe is in the drawer of my desk--the top drawer.\"\n\n\"That's all right, dear old--dear Mrs. Hyane.\"\n\n\"What is that you say?\" asked the voice sharply.\n\n\"Congratulations, dear old missus,\" said Bones.  \"Hope you'll be\nawfully happy on your plantation.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the voice.  \"Did you call me Mrs. Hyane?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bones huskily.\n\nHe heard her laugh.\n\n\"How ridiculous you are!  Did you really think I would ever marry my\ncousin?\"\n\n\"But haven't you?\" yelled Bones.\n\n\"What--married?  Absurd!  I'm going to Scotland to see about some\nfamily matter.\"\n\n\"You're not--not a Mrs.?\" asked Bones emphatically.\n\n\"And never will be,\" said the girl.  \"What does it all mean?  Tell me.\"\n\nBones drew a long breath.\n\n\"Come back by the next train, young miss,\" he said.  \"Let that jolly\nold family affair go to blazes.  I'll meet you at the station and tell\nyou everything.\"\n\n\"But--but----\" said the girl.\n\n\"Do as you're told, young miss!\" roared Bones, and hung up the receiver\nwith a seraphic smile.\n\nThe door of his study was a thick one, and it was, moreover, protected\nfrom outside noises by a large baize door, and the student of men had\nheard nothing.  Bones strode back into the room with a face so changed\nthat Mr. Hyane could not but observe that something remarkable had\nhappened.\n\n\"I'm afraid I'm keeping you up, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Bones cheerfully.  \"Let's have a look at that cheque\nI gave you.\"\n\nThe other hesitated.\n\n\"Let me have a look at it,\" said Bones, and Mr. Hyane, with a smile,\ntook it from his pocket and handed it to the other.\n\n\"Half for you and half for her, eh, dear old thing?\" said Bones, and\ntore the cheque in two.  \"That's your half,\" he said, handing one\nportion to Mr. Hyane.\n\n\"What the devil are you doing?\" demanded the other angrily, but Bones\nhad him by the collar, and was kicking him along the all-too-short\ncorridor.\n\n\"Open the door, Ali!\" said Bones.  \"Open it wide, dear old heathen!\nOoff!\"\n\nThe \"Ooff!\" was accompanied by one final lunge of Bones's long legs.\n\nAt midnight Bones was sitting on the platform at King's Cross,\nalternately smoking a large pipe and singing tuneless songs.  They told\nhim that the next train from York would not arrive until three in the\nmorning.\n\n\"That doesn't worry me, old thing.  I'll wait all night.\"\n\n\"Expecting somebody, sir?\" asked the inquisitive porter.\n\n\"Everybody, my dear old uniformed official,\" said Bones, \"everybody!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nBONES HITS BACK\n\nIt may be said of Bones that he was in the City, but not of it.  Never\nonce had he been invited by the great and awe-inspiring men who\ndominate the finance of the City to participate in any of those\nadventurous undertakings which produce for the adventurers the fabulous\nprofits about which so much has been written.  There were times when\nBones even doubted whether the City knew he was in it.\n\nHe never realised his own insignificance so poignantly as when he\nstrolled through the City streets at their busiest hour, and was\nunrecognised even by the bareheaded clerks who dashed madly in all\ndirections, carrying papers of tremendous importance.\n\nThe indifference of the City to Mr. Tibbetts and his partner was more\napparent than real.  It is true that the great men who sit around the\ngreen baize cloth at the Bank of England and arrange the bank rate knew\nnot Bones nor his work.  It is equally true that the very important\npersonages who occupy suites of rooms in Lombard Street had little or\nno idea of his existence.  But there were men, and rich and famous men\nat that, who had inscribed the name of Bones in indelible ink on the\ntablets of their memory.\n\nThe Pole Brothers were shipbrokers, and had little in common, in their\ndaily transactions, with Mr. Harold de Vinne, who specialised in\nindustrial stocks, and knew little more about ships than could be\nlearnt in an annual holiday trip to Madeira.  Practically there was no\nbridge to connect their intellects.  Sentimentally, life held a common\ncause, which they discovered one day, when Mr. Fred Pole met Mr. Harold\nde Vinne at lunch to discuss a matter belonging neither to the realms\nof industrialism nor the mercantile marine, being, in fact, the\nquestion of Mr. de Vinne leasing or renting Mr. Pole's handsome\nriverside property at Maidenhead for the term of six months.\n\nThey might not have met even under these circumstances, but for the\nfact that some dispute arose as to who was to pay the gardener.  That\nmatter had been amicably settled, and the two had reached the coffee\nstage of their luncheon, when Mr. de Vinne mentioned the\ninadvisability--as a rule--of discussing business matters at lunch, and\ncited a deplorable happening when an interested eavesdropper had\noverheard certain important negotiations and had most unscrupulously\ntaken advantage of his discovery.\n\n\"One of these days,\" said Mr. de Vinne between his teeth, \"I'll be even\nwith that gentleman.\"  (He did not call him a gentleman.)  \"I'll give\nhim Tibbetts!  He'll be sorry he was ever born.\"\n\n\"Tibbetts?\" said Mr. Fred Pole, sitting bolt upright.  \"Not Bones?\"\n\nThe other nodded and seemed surprised.\n\n\"You don't know the dear fellow, do you?\" he asked, only he did not use\nthe expression \"dear fellow.\"\n\n\"Know him?\" said Mr. Fred, taking a long breath.  \"I should jolly well\nsay I did know him.  And my brother Joe knows him.  That fellow----\"\n\n\"That fellow----\" began Mr. de Vinne, and for several minutes they\ntalked together in terms which were uncomplimentary to Augustus\nTibbetts.\n\nIt appeared, though they did not put the matter so crudely, that they\nhad both been engaged in schemes for robbing Bones, and that in the\npursuance of their laudable plans they had found themselves robbed by\nBones.\n\nMr. de Vinne ordered another coffee and prepared to make an afternoon\nof it.  They discussed Bones from several aspects and in various\nlights, none of which revealed his moral complexion at its best.\n\n\"And believe me,\" said Mr. de Vinne at the conclusion of his address\nfor the prosecution, \"there's money to be made out of that fellow.\nWhy, I believe he has three hundred thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"Three hundred and forty thousand,\" said the more accurate Mr. Fred.\n\n\"A smart man could get it all,\" said Harold de Vinne, with conviction.\n\"And when I say a smart man, I mean two smart men.  I never thought\nthat he had done anybody but me.  It's funny I never heard of your\ncase,\" he said.  \"He must have got the best of you in the early days.\"\n\nMr. Fred nodded.\n\n\"I was his first\"--he swallowed hard and added--\"mug!\"\n\nMr. de Vinne pulled thoughtfully at his black cigar and eyed the\nceiling of the restaurant absent-mindedly.\n\n\"There's nobody in the City who knows more about Tibbetts than me,\" he\nsaid.  He was weak on the classical side, but rather strong on\nmathematics.  \"I've watched every transaction he's been in, and I think\nI have got him down fine.\"\n\n\"Mind you,\" said Fred, \"I think he's clever.\"\n\n\"Clever!\" said the other scornfully.  \"Clever!  He's lucky, my dear\nchap.  Things have just fallen into his lap.  It's mug's luck that man\nhas had.\"\n\nMr. Fred nodded.  It was an opinion which he himself had held and\nruminated upon.\n\n\"It is luck--sheer luck,\" continued Mr. de Vinne.  \"And if we'd been\nclever, we'd have cleaned him.  We'll clean him yet,\" he said, stroking\nhis chin more thoughtfully than ever, \"but it's got to be done\nsystematically.\"\n\nMr. Fred was interested.  The possibility of relieving a\nfellow-creature of his superfluous wealth by legitimate means, and\nunder the laws and rules which govern the legal transfer of property,\nwas the absorbing interest of his life.\n\n\"It has got to be done cleverly, scientifically, and systematically,\"\nsaid Mr. de Vinne, \"and there's no sense in jumping to a plan.  What do\nyou say to taking a bit of dinner with me at the Ritz-Carlton on\nFriday?\"\n\nMr. Fred was very agreeable.\n\n\"I'll tell you the strength of Bones,\" said de Vinne, as they left the\nrestaurant.  \"He was an officer on the West Coast of Africa.  His boss\nwas a man named Sanders, who's left the Service and lives at\nTwickenham.  From what I can hear, this chap Tibbetts worships the\nground that Sanders walks on.  Evidently Sanders was a big bug in West\nAfrica.\"\n\nOn Friday they resumed their conversation, and Mr. de Vinne arrived\nwith a plan.  It was a good plan.  He was tremulous with pride at the\nthought of it, and demanded applause and approval with every second\nbreath, which was unlike him.\n\nHe was a man of many companies, good, bad, and indifferent, and,\nreviewing the enterprises with which his name was associated, he had,\nwithout the slightest difficulty, placed his finger upon the least\nprofitable and certainly the most hopeless proposition in the Mazeppa\nTrading Company.  And nothing could be better for Mr. de Vinne's\npurpose, not, as he explained to Fred Pole, if he had searched the\nStock Exchange Year Book from cover to cover.\n\nOnce upon a time the Mazeppa Trading Company had been a profitable\nconcern.  Its trading stores had dotted the African hinterland thickly.\nIt had exported vast quantities of Manchester goods and Birmingham\njunk, and had received in exchange unlimited quantities of rubber and\nivory.  But those were in the bad old days, before authority came and\ntaught the aboriginal natives the exact value of a sixpenny\nlooking-glass.\n\nNo longer was it possible to barter twenty pounds' worth of ivory for\nthreepennyworth of beads, and the flourishing Mazeppa Trading Company\nlanguished and died.  Its managers had grown immensely wealthy from\ntheir peculations and private trading, and had come home and were\noccupying opulent villas at Wimbledon, whilst the new men who had been\nsent to take their places had been so inexperienced that profits fell\nto nothing.  That, in brief, was the history of the Mazeppa Trading\nCompany, which still maintained a few dilapidated stores, managed by\nhalf-castes and poor whites.\n\n\"I got most of the shares for a song,\" confessed Mr. de Vinne.  \"In\nfact, I happen to be one of the debenture-holders, and stepped in when\nthings were going groggy.  We've been on the point of winding it up--it\nis grossly over-capitalised--but I kept it going in the hope that\nsomething would turn up.\"\n\n\"What is the general idea?\" asked Mr. Fred Pole, interested.\n\n\"We'll get a managing director,\" said Mr. de Vinne solemnly.  \"A man\nwho is used to the handling of natives, a man acquainted with the West\nCoast of Africa, a man who can organise.\"\n\n\"Bones?\" suggested Mr. Fred.\n\n\"Bones be--jiggered!\" replied de Vinne scornfully.  \"Do you think he'd\nfall for that sort of thing?  Not on your life!  We're not going to\nmention it to Bones.  But he has a pal--Sanders; you've heard of him.\nHe's a commissioner or something on the West Coast, and retired.  Now,\nmy experience of a chap of that kind who retires is that he gets sick\nto death of doing nothing.  If we could only get at him and persuade\nhim to accept the managing directorship, with six months a year on the\nCoast, at a salary of, say, two thousand a year, conditional on taking\nup six or seven thousand pounds' worth of shares, what do you think\nwould happen?\"\n\nMr. Fred's imagination baulked at the problem, and he shook his head.\n\n\"I'll tell you what would happen,\" said Mr. de Vinne.  \"It happened\nonce before, when another pal of Bones got let in on a motor car\ncompany.  Bones fell over himself to buy the shares and control the\ncompany.  And, mind you, the Mazeppa looks good.  It's the sort of\nproposition that would appeal to a young and energetic man.  It's one\nof those bogy companies that seem possible, and a fellow who knows the\nropes would say straight away: 'If I had charge of that, I'd make it\npay.'  That's what I'm banking on.\"\n\n\"What are the shares worth?\" said Fred.\n\n\"About twopence net,\" replied the other brutally.  \"I'll tell you\nfrankly that I'd run this business myself if I thought there was any\nchance of my succeeding.  But if Bones finds all the shares in one\nhand, he's going to shy.  What I'm prepared to do is this.  These\nshares are worth twopence.  I'm going to sell you and a few friends\nparcels at a shilling a share.  If nothing happens, I'll undertake to\nbuy them back at the same price.\"\n\nA week later Hamilton brought news to the office of Tibbetts and\nHamilton, Limited.\n\n\"The chief is going back to the Coast.\"\n\nBones opened his mouth wide in astonishment.\n\n\"Back to the Coast?\" he said incredulously.  \"You don't mean he's\nchucking jolly old Twickenham?\"\n\nHamilton nodded.\n\n\"He's had an excellent offer from some people in the City to control a\ntrading company.  By the way, did you ever hear of the Mazeppa\nCompany?\" Bones shook his head.\n\n\"I've heard of Mazeppa,\" he said.  \"He was the naughty old gentleman\nwho rode through the streets of Birmingham without any clothes.\"\n\nHamilton groaned.\n\n\"If I had your knowledge of history,\" he said despairingly, \"I'd start\na bone factory.  You're thinking of Lady Godiva, but that doesn't\nmatter.  No, I don't suppose you've heard of the Mazeppa Company; it\ndid not operate in our territory.\"\n\nBones shook his head and pursed his lips.\n\n\"But surely,\" he said, \"dear old Excellency hasn't accepted a job\nwithout consulting me?\"\n\nHamilton made derisive noises.\n\n\"He fixed it up in a couple of days,\" he said, after a while.  \"It\ndoesn't mean he'll be living on the Coast, but he'll probably be there\nfor some months in the year.  The salary is good--in fact, it's two\nthousand a year.  I believe Sanders has to qualify for directorship by\ntaking some shares, but the dear chap is enthusiastic about it, and so\nis Patricia.  It is all right, of course.  Sanders got the offer\nthrough a firm of solicitors.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Bones.  \"Solicitors are nobody.\"\n\nHe learnt more about the company that afternoon, for Sanders called in\nand gave a somewhat roseate view of the future.\n\n\"The fact is, Bones, I am getting stale,\" he said, \"and this looks like\nan excellent and a profitable occupation.\"\n\n\"How did you get to hear about it, Excellency?\".  asked Bones.\n\nHis attitude was one of undisguised antagonism.  He might have been a\nlittle resentful that the opportunity had come to Sanders through any\nother agency than his own.\n\n\"I had a letter from the solicitors asking me if the idea appealed to\nme, and recalling my services on the Coast,\" said Sanders.  \"Of course\nI know very little about the Mazeppa Trading Company, though I had\nheard of it years gone past as a very profitable concern.  The\nsolicitors were quite frank, and told me that business had fallen off,\ndue to inexperienced management.  They pointed out the opportunities\nwhich existed--the possibilities of opening new stations--and I must\nconfess that it appealed to me.  It will mean hard work, but the salary\nis good.\"\n\n\"Hold hard, Sir and Excellency,\" said Bones.  \"What did you have to put\nup in the way of shares?\"\n\nSanders flushed.  He was a shy man, and not given to talking about his\nmoney affairs.\n\n\"Oh, about five thousand pounds,\" he said awkwardly.  \"Of course, it's\na lot of money; but even if the business isn't successful, I have a\nfive-year contract with the company, and I get more than my investment\nback in salary.\"\n\nThat night Bones stayed on after Hamilton had left, and had for\ncompanion Miss Marguerite Whitland, a lady in whose judgment he had a\nmost embarrassing faith.  He had given her plenty of work to do, and\nthe rhythmical tap-tap of her typewriter came faintly through the door\nwhich separated the outer from the inner office.\n\nBones sat at his desk, his chin in his hand, a very thoughtful young\nman, and before him was a copy of the latest evening newspaper, opened\nat the Stock Exchange page.  There had been certain significant\nmovements in industrial shares--a movement so interesting to the\ncommentator upon Stock Exchange doings that he had inserted a paragraph\nto the effect that:\n\n\"The feature of the industrial market was the firmness of Mazeppa\nTrading shares, for which there was a steady demand, the stock closing\nat 19_s_. 9_d_.  Mazeppa shares have not been dealt in within the House\nfor many years, and, in fact, it was generally believed that the\nCompany was going into liquidation, and the shares could be had for the\nprice of the paper on which they were printed.  It is rumoured in the\nCity that the Company is to be reconstructed, and that a considerable\namount of new capital has been found, with the object of expanding its\nexisting business.\"\n\nBones read the paragraph many times, and at the conclusion of each\nreading returned to his reverie.  Presently he rose and strolled into\nthe office of his secretary, and the girl looked up with a smile as\nBones seated himself on the edge of her table.\n\n\"Young miss,\" he said soberly, \"do you ever hear anybody talking about\nme in this jolly old City?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" she said in surprise.\n\n\"Fearfully complimentarily, dear old miss?\" asked Bones carelessly, and\nthe girl's colour deepened.\n\n\"I don't think it matters what people say about one, do you?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter to me,\" said Bones, \"so long as one lovely old\ntypewriter has a good word for poor old Bones.\"  He laid his hand upon\nhers, and she suffered it to remain there without protest.  \"They think\nI'm a silly old ass, don't they?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said quickly, \"they don't think that.  They say you're\nrather unconventional.\"\n\n\"Same thing,\" said Bones.  \"Anybody who's unconventional in business is\na silly old ass.\"\n\nHe squeezed the hand under his, and again she did not protest or\nwithdraw it from his somewhat clammy grip.\n\n\"Dear old darling----\" began Bones, but she stopped him with a warning\nfinger.\n\n\"Dear old typewriter,\" said Bones, unabashed, but obedient, \"suppose\nsomething happened to the clever old Johnny who presides over this\noffice--the brains of the department, if I may be allowed to say so?\"\n\n\"Captain Hamilton?\" said the girl in surprise.\n\n\"No, me,\" said Bones, annoyed.  \"Gracious Heavens, dear old key-tapper,\ndidn't I say me?\"\n\n\"Something happen to you?\" she said in alarm.  \"Why, what could happen\nto you?\"\n\n\"Suppose I went broke?\" said Bones, with the comfortable air of one who\nwas very unlikely to go broke.  \"Suppose I had terrific and tremendous\nand cataclysmic and what's-the-other-word losses?\"\n\n\"But you're not likely to have those, are you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not really,\" said Bones, \"but suppose?\"\n\nShe saw that, for once, when he was speaking to her, his mind was\nelsewhere, and withdrew her hand.  It was a fact that Bones did not\nseem to notice the withdrawal.\n\n\"Poor old Bones, poor old mug!\" said Bones softly.  \"I'm a funny old\ndevil.\"\n\nThe girl laughed.\n\n\"I don't know what you're thinking about,\" she said, \"but you never\nstrike me as being particularly funny, or poor, or old, for the matter\nof that,\" she added demurely.\n\nBones stooped down from the table and laid his big hand on her head,\nrumpling her hair as he might have done to a child.\n\n\"You're a dear old Marguerite,\" he said softly, \"and I'm not such a\nditherer as you think.  Now, you watch old Bones.\"  And, with that\ncryptic remark, he stalked back to his desk.\n\nTwo days after this he surprised Hamilton.\n\n\"I'm expecting a visitor to-day, old Ham,\" he said.  \"A Johnny named de\nVinne.\"\n\n\"De Vinne?\" frowned Hamilton.  \"I seem to know that name.  Isn't he the\ngentleman you had the trouble with over the boots?\"\n\n\"That's the jolly old robber,\" said Bones cheerfully.  \"I've\ntelegraphed and asked him to come to see me.\"\n\n\"About what?\" demanded Hamilton.\n\n\"About two o'clock,\" said Bones.  \"You can stay and see your old friend\nthrough, or you can let us have it out with the lad in camera.\"\n\n\"I'll stay,\" said Hamilton.  \"But I don't think he'll come.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Bones confidently, and he was justified in his confidence,\nfor at two o'clock to the second Mr. de Vinne appeared.\n\nHe was bright and cheerful, even genial to Bones, and Bones was almost\neffusive in his welcome.\n\n\"Sit down there in the most comfortable chair, happy old financier,\" he\nsaid, \"and open your young heart to old Bones about the Mazeppa Trading\nCompany.\"\n\nMr. de Vinne did not expect so direct an attack, but recovered from his\nsurprise without any apparent effort.\n\n\"Oh, so you know I was behind that, do you?  How the dickens did you\nfind out?\"\n\n\"Stock Exchange Year Book, dear old thing.  Costs umpteen and sixpence,\nand you can find out everything you want to know about the directors of\ncompanies,\" said Bones.\n\n\"By Jove!  That's clever of you,\" said de Vinne, secretly amused, for\nit was from the Year Book that he expected Bones to make the discovery.\n\n\"Now, what's the game, old financial gentleman?\" asked Bones.  \"Why\nthis fabulous salary to friend Sanders and selling this thousands of\npounds worth of shares, eh?\"\n\nThe other shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"My dear chap, it's a business transaction.  And really, if I thought\nyou were going to interrogate me on that, I shouldn't have come.  Is\nMr. Sanders a friend of yours?\" he asked innocently.\n\n\"Shurrup!\" said Bones vulgarly.  \"You know jolly well he's a friend of\nmine.  Now, what is the idea, young company promoter?\"\n\n\"It's pretty obvious,\" replied de Vinne, taking the expensive cigar\nwhich Bones had imported into the office for the purpose.  \"The\nposition is a good one----\"\n\n\"Half a mo',\" said Bones.  \"Do you personally guarantee Mr. Sanders's\nsalary for five years?\"\n\nThe other laughed.\n\n\"Of course not.  It is a company matter,\" he said, \"and I should\ncertainly not offer a personal guarantee for the payment of any salary.\"\n\n\"So that, if the company goes bust in six months' time, Mr. Sanders\nloses all the money he has invested and his salary?\"\n\nThe other raised his shoulders again with a deprecating smile.\n\n\"He would, of course, have a claim against the company for his salary,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"A fat lot of good that would be!\" answered Bones.\n\n\"Now, look here, Mr. Tibbetts\"--the other leaned confidentially\nforward, his unlighted cigar between his teeth--\"there is no reason in\nthe world why the Mazeppa Company shouldn't make a fortune for the\nright man.  All it wants is new blood and capable direction.  I\nconfess,\" he admitted, \"that I have not the time to give to the\ncompany, otherwise I'd guarantee a seven per cent. dividend on the\nshare capital.  Why, look at the price of them to-day----\"\n\nBones stopped him.\n\n\"Any fool can get the shares up to any price he likes, if they're all\nheld in one hand,\" he said.\n\n\"What?\" said the outraged Mr. de Vinne.  \"Do you suggest I have rigged\nthe market?  Besides, they're not all in one hand.  They're pretty\nevenly distributed.\"\n\n\"Who holds 'em?\" asked Bones curiously.\n\n\"Well, I've got a parcel, and Pole Brothers have a parcel.\"\n\n\"Pole Brothers, eh?\" said Bones, nodding.  \"Well, well!\"\n\n\"Come, now, be reasonable.  Don't be suspicious, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said\nthe other genially.  \"Your friend's interests are all right, and the\nshareholders' interests are all right.  You might do worse than get\ncontrol of the company yourself.\"\n\nBones nodded.\n\n\"I was thinking of that,\" he said.\n\n\"I assure you,\" said Mr. de Vinne with great earnestness, \"that the\npossibilities of the Mazeppa Trading Company are unlimited.  We have\nconcessions from the Great River to the north of the French\nterritory----\"\n\n\"Not worth the paper they're written on, dear old kidder,\" said Bones,\nshaking his head.  \"Chiefs' concessions without endorsement from the\nColonial Office are no good, dear old thing.\"\n\n\"But the trading concessions are all right,\" insisted the other.  \"You\ncan't deny that.  You understand the Coast customs better than I do.\nTrading customs hold without endorsement from the Colonial Office.\"\n\nBones had to admit that that was a fact.\n\n\"I'll think it over,\" he said.  \"It appeals to me, old de Vinne.  It\nreally does appeal to me.  Who own the shares?\"\n\n\"I can give you a list,\" said Mr. de Vinne, with admirable calm, \"and\nyou'd be well advised to negotiate privately with these gentlemen.\nYou'd probably get the shares for eighteen shillings.\"  He took a gold\npencil from his pocket and wrote rapidly a list of names, and Bones\ntook the paper from his hand and scrutinised them.\n\nHamilton, a silent and an amazed spectator of the proceedings, waited\nuntil de Vinne had gone, and then fell upon his partner.\n\n\"You're not going to be such a perfect jackass----\" he began, but\nBones's dignified gesture arrested his eloquence.\n\n\"Dear old Ham,\" he said, \"senior partner, dear old thing!  Let old\nBones have his joke.\"\n\n\"Do you realise,\" said Hamilton, \"that you are contemplating the risk\nof a quarter of a million?  You're mad, Bones!\"\n\nBones grinned.\n\n\"Go down to our broker and buy ten thousand shares in old Mazeppa,\nHam,\" he said.  \"You'll buy them on the market for nineteen shillings,\nand I've an idea that they're worth about the nineteenth part of a\nfarthing.\"\n\n\"But----\" stammered Hamilton.\n\n\"It is an order,\" said Bones, and he spoke in the Bomongo tongue.\n\n\"Phew!\" said Hamilton.  \"That carries me a few thousand miles.  I\nwonder what those devils of the N'gombi are doing now?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you something they're not doing,\" said Bones.  \"They're not\nbuying Mazeppa shares.\"\n\nThere were two very deeply troubled people in the office of Tibbetts\nand Hamilton.  One was Hamilton himself, and the other was Miss\nMarguerite Whitland.  Hamilton had two causes for worry.  The first and\nthe least was the strange extravagance of Bones.  The second--and this\nwas more serious--was the prospect of breaking to Sanders that night\nthat he had been swindled, for swindled he undoubtedly was.  Hamilton\nhad spent a feverish hour canvassing City opinion on the Mazeppa\nTrading Company, and the report he had had was not encouraging.  He\nhad, much against his will, carried out the instructions of Bones, and\nhad purchased in the open market ten thousand shares in the Company--a\ntransaction duly noted by Mr. de Vinne and his interested partner.\n\n\"He is biting,\" said that exultant man over the 'phone.  \"All we have\nto do is to sit steady, and he'll swallow the hook!\"\n\nIt was impossible that Marguerite Whitland should not know the extent\nof her employer's commitments.  She was a shrewd girl, and had acquired\na very fair working knowledge of City affairs during the period of her\nemployment.  She had, too, an instinct for a swindle, and she was\npanic-stricken at the thought that Bones was marching headlong to\nfinancial disaster.  Hamilton had gone home to his disagreeable task,\nwhen the girl came from her office and stood, her hands clasped behind\nher, before the desk of the senior partner.\n\nBones peered up in his short-sighted way.\n\n\"Well, young miss?\" he said quietly.\n\n\"Mr. Tibbetts,\" she began a little unsteadily, \"I'm going to be very\nimpertinent.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"I've been with you for some time now,\" said the girl, speaking\nrapidly, \"and I feel that I have a better right to talk to you\nthan--than----\"\n\n\"Than anybody in the whole wide world,\" said Bones, \"and that's a fact,\ndear young Marguerite.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said hurriedly, \"but this is something about business,\nand about--about this deal which you're going into.  I've been talking\nto Captain Hamilton this afternoon, while you were out, and I know it's\na swindle.\"\n\n\"I know that, too,\" said Bones calmly.\n\n\"But,\" said the puzzled girl, \"you are putting all your money into it.\nMr. Hamilton said that, if this failed, you might be ruined.\"\n\nBones nodded.  Outwardly calm, the light of battle shone in his eye.\n\n\"It's a gamble, dear young typewriter,\" he said, \"a terrific gamble,\nbut it's going to turn out all right for did Bones.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Hamilton said you can't possibly make anything from the\nproperty--that it is derelict and worth practically nothing.  Only a\ntenth of the stores are open, and the trading is----\"\n\nBones smiled.\n\n\"I'm not gambling on the property,\" he said softly.  \"Oh, dear, no,\nyoung fianc\u00e9e, I'm not gambling on the property.\"\n\n\"Then what on earth are you gambling on?\" she asked, a little piqued.\n\n\"On me,\" said Bones in the same tone.  \"On poor old silly ass Bones,\nand I'm coming through!\"\n\nHe got up and came across to her and laid his big hand on her shoulder\ngently.\n\n\"If I don't come through, I shan't be a beggar.  I shall have enough to\nbuild a jolly little place, where we can raise cows and horses and\nvegetables of all descriptions, dear old typewriter.  And if I do come\nthrough, we'll still have that same place--only perhaps we'll have more\ncows and a pig or two.\"\n\nShe laughed, and he raised her smiling lips to his and kissed them.\n\nMr. de Vinne had dined well and had enjoyed an evening's amusement.  He\nhad been to the Hippodrome, and his enjoyment had been made the more\npiquant by the knowledge that Mr. Augustus Tibbetts had as good as\nplaced ten thousand pounds in his pocket.  He was a surprised man, on\nreturning to Sloane Square, to discover, waiting in the hall, his\nunwilling benefactor.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, \"this is a great surprise.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bones, \"I suppose it is, old Mr. de Vinne.\"  And he coughed\nsolemnly, as one who was the guardian of a great secret.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Mr. de Vinne, more genial than ever.  \"This is my\nlittle den\"--indicating a den which the most fastidious of lions would\nnot have despised.  \"Sit down and have a cigar, old man.  Now, what\nbrings you here to-night?\"\n\n\"The shares,\" said Bones soberly.  \"I've been worrying about the\nshares.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Mr. de Vinne carelessly.  \"Why worry about them, dear\nboy?\"\n\n\"Well, I thought I might lose the opportunity of buying them.  I think\nthere's something to be made out of that property.  In fact,\" said\nBones emphatically, \"I'm pretty certain I could make a lot of money if\nI had control.\"\n\n\"I agree with you,\" said the earnest Mr. de Vinne.\n\n\"Now the point is,\" said Bones, \"I've been studying that list of yours,\nand it seems to me that the majority of the two hundred and fifty\nthousand shares issued are either held by you or by one of the\nPoles--jolly old Joe or jolly old Fred, I don't know which.\"\n\n\"Jolly old Fred,\" said Mr. de Vinne gravely.\n\n\"Now, if there's one person I don't want to meet to-night, or\nto-morrow, or any other day,\" said Bones, \"it's Pole.\"\n\n\"There's no need for you to meet him,\" smiled de Vinne.\n\n\"In fact,\" said Bones, with sudden ferocity, \"I absolutely refuse to\nbuy any shares from Fred.  I'll buy yours, but I will not buy a single\none from Fred.\"\n\nMr. De Vinne thought rapidly.\n\n\"There's really no reason,\" he said carelessly.  \"As a matter of fact,\nI took over Fred's shares to-night, or the majority of them.  I can let\nyou have--let me see\"--he made a rapid calculation--\"I can let you have\na hundred and eighty thousand shares at nineteen and nine.\"\n\n\"Eighteen shillings,\" said Bones firmly, \"and not a penny more.\"\n\nThey wrangled about the price for five minutes, and then, in an\noutburst of generosity, Mr. de Vinne agreed.\n\n\"Eighteen shillings it shall be.  You're a hard devil,\" he said.  \"Now,\nshall we settle this in the morning?\"\n\n\"Settle it now,\" said Bones.  \"I've a contract note and a cheque book.\"\n\nDe Vinne thought a moment.\n\n\"Why, sure!\" he said.  \"Let's have your note.\"\n\nBones took a note from his pocket, unfolded it, and laid it on the\ntable, then solemnly seated himself at Mr. de Vinne's desk and wrote\nout the cheque.\n\nHis good fortune was more than Mr. de Vinne could believe.  He had\nexpected Bones to be easy, but not so easy as this.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Bones.  He was solemn, even funereal.\n\n\"And, my friend,\" thought Mr. de Vinne, \"you'll be even more solemn\nbefore the month's out.\"\n\nHe saw Bones to the door, slapped him on the back, insisted on his\ntaking another cigar, and stood outside on the pavement of Cadogan\nSquare and watched the rear lights of Bones's car pass out of sight.\nThen he went back to his study telephone and gave a number.  It was the\nnumber of Mr. Fred Pole's house, and Fred Pole himself answered the\ncall.\n\n\"Is that you, Pole?\"\n\n\"That's me,\" said the other, and there was joy in his voice.\n\n\"I say, Pole,\" chuckled de Vinne, \"I shall save you a lot of trouble.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the other.\n\n\"I've sold Bones my shares and yours too.\"\n\nThere was a deep silence.\n\n\"Did you hear me?\" asked de Vinne.\n\n\"Yes, I heard you,\" said the voice, so strange that de Vinne scarcely\nrecognised it.  \"How many did you sell?\" asked Pole.\n\n\"A hundred and eighty thousand.  I thought I could easily fix it with\nyou.\"\n\nAnother silence.\n\n\"What did Bones say to you?\"\n\n\"He told me he wouldn't do any more business with you.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" groaned Pole, and added, \"Gracious Heavens!\"\n\n\"Why, what's the matter?\" asked de Vinne quickly, scenting danger.\n\n\"That's what he said to me,\" moaned the other.  \"Just hang on.  I'll be\nround in a quarter of an hour.\"\n\nMr. Fred Pole arrived under that time, and had a dreadful story to\nunfold.  At nine o'clock that evening Bones had called upon him and had\noffered to buy his shares.  But Bones had said he would not under any\ncircumstances----\n\n\"Buy my shares?\" said de Vinne quickly.\n\n\"Well, he didn't exactly say that,\" said Fred.  \"But he gave me to\nunderstand that he'd rather buy the shares from me than from anybody\nelse, and I thought it was such an excellent idea, and I could fix it\nup with you on the telephone, so I sold him----\"\n\n\"How many?\" wailed de Vinne.\n\n\"A hundred and fifty thousand,\" said Mr. Fred, and the two men stared\nat one another.\n\nDe Vinne licked his dry lips.\n\n\"It comes to this,\" he said.  \"Between us we've sold him three hundred\nand thirty thousand shares.  There are only two hundred and fifty\nthousand shares issued, so we've got to deliver eighty thousand shares\nthat are non-existent or be posted as defaulters.\"\n\nAnother long pause, and then both men said simultaneously, as though\nthe thought had struck them for the first time:\n\n\"Why, the fellow's a rogue!\"\n\nThe next morning they called upon Bones, and they were with him for\nhalf an hour; and when they went, they left behind them, not only the\ncheques that Bones had given them, but another cheque for a most\nsubstantial amount as consideration.\n\nThat night Bones gave a wonderful dinner-party at the most expensive\nhotel in London.  Sanders was there, and Patricia Sanders, and\nHamilton, and a certain Vera, whom the bold Bones called by her\nChristian name, but the prettiest of the girls was she who sat on his\nright and listened to the delivery of Bones's great speech in fear and\ntrembling.\n\n\"The toast of the evening, dear old friends,\" said Bones, \"is Cupidity\nand Cupid.  Coupled with the names of the Honourable de Vinne and my\nyoung and lovely typewriter--my friend and companion in storm and\nstress, the only jolly old lady, if I may be allowed to say so, that\nhas stirred my young heart\"--he caught Patricia Sanders's accusing eye,\ncoughed, and added--\"in Europe!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n_WARD, LOCK & CO.'S NEW FICTION_\n\n\nHigh Street\n\nBy\n\nCharman Edwards\n\nWhen one reads this amazing study of Daven Judd, who although he is\ndescribed as \"lover, idealist and sometime fugitive from justice,\"\ncomes at last to strange and beautiful happiness, it is difficult to\nbelieve that an author could have evolved such a book out of his own\ninventive faculties.

The issue is of\nnecessity dramatic and full of movement, and Mr. Slater has made the\nutmost of the opportunities inherent in such a vivid opening, and the\nresult is a novel as convincing as it is exciting.  The end is that\nfree pardon which our authorities give for a crime that has never been\ncommitted.  We could not read COURAGE OF THE OUTCAST otherwise.  It is\nall so real.\n\n\nThe Author can write a rattling good yarn, full of excitement and real\nmystery.  Thoroughly brisk in action, the story is told in a virile and\nspirited manner.\n\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\nLights and Shadows\n\nBy\n\nEffie Adelaide Rowlands\n\nWhen the wealthy Miss Martingate died she left her money away from the\nfamily and to her servant Hester Slayde.  Michael alone of the family\nshowed himself kindly disposed, and Hester's path was by no means one\nof roses.  Then, close upon her good fortune, arrived the letter from\nElizabeth Charlbury to the dead woman, asking for help.  How the help\nwas not denied her by Hester Slayde, and what gratitude, or\ningratitude, was returned for it, and what byways were entered by those\nchiefly concerned, is told by Miss Rowlands with all her accustomed\nskill in telling a romance.\n\n_Other popular Stories by this Author:_\n\n  The Rose of Life               The Game of Life\n  Carlton's Wife                 A Dangerous Woman\n  They Laugh that Win            The Flame of Love\n  In Love's Land                 Young Hearts\n  A Girl with a Heart            Through Weal and Through Woe\n  Love's Young Dream             Out of a Clear Sky\n  Money or Wife?

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
