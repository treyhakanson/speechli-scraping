Long before he was called upon by the British Government to\nkeep a watchful eye upon some quarter of a million cannibal folk, who\nten years before had regarded white men as we regard the unicorn; he had\nmet the Basuto, the Zulu, the Fingo, the Pondo, Matabele, Mashona,\nBarotse, Hottentot, and Bechuana. Then curiosity and interest took him\nwestward and northward, and he met the Angola folk, then northward to\nthe Congo, westward to the Masai, and finally, by way of the Pigmy\npeople, he came to his own land.\n\nNow, there is a subtle difference between all these races, a difference\nthat only such men as Sanders know.\n\nIt is not necessarily a variety of colour, though some are brown and\nsome yellow, and some--a very few--jet black. The difference is in\ncharacter. By Sanders' code you trusted all natives up to the same\npoint, as you trust children, with a few notable exceptions. The Zulu\nwere men, the Basuto were men, yet childlike in their grave faith. The\nblack men who wore the fez were subtle, but trustworthy; but the browny\nmen of the Gold Coast, who talked English, wore European clothing, and\ncalled one another \"Mr.,\" were Sanders' pet abomination.\n\nLiving so long with children of a larger growth, it follows that he\nabsorbed many of their childlike qualities. Once, on furlough in London,\na confidence trick was played on him, and only his natural honesty\npulled him out of a ridiculous scrape. For, when the gold-brick man\nproduced his dull metal ingot, all Sanders' moral nerves stood endways,\nand he ran the confiding \"bunco steerer\" to the nearest station,\ncharging him, to the astonishment of a sorely-puzzled policeman, with\n\"I.G.B.,\" which means illicit gold buying. Sanders did not doubt that\nthe ingot was gold, but he was equally certain that the gold was not\nhonestly come by. His surprise when he found that the \"gold\" was\ngold-leaf imposed upon the lead of commerce was pathetic.\n\nYou may say of Sanders that he was a statesman, which means that he had\nno exaggerated opinion of the value of individual human life. When he\nsaw a dead leaf on the plant of civilisation, he plucked it off, or a\nweed growing with his \"flowers\" he pulled it up, not stopping to\nconsider the weed's equal right to life. When a man, whether he was\n_capita_ or slave, by his bad example endangered the peace of his\ncountry, Sanders fell upon him. In their unregenerate days, the Isisi\ncalled him \"Ogani Isisi,\" which means \"The Little Butcher Bird,\" and\ncertainly in that time Sanders was prompt to hang. He governed a people\nthree hundred miles beyond the fringe of civilisation. Hesitation to\nact, delay in awarding punishment, either of these two things would have\nbeen mistaken for weakness amongst a people who had neither power to\nreason, nor will to excuse, nor any large charity.\n\nIn the land which curves along the borders of Togo the people understand\npunishment to mean pain and death, and nothing else counts. There was a\nfoolish Commissioner who was a great humanitarian, and he went up to\nAkasava--which is the name of this land--and tried moral suasion.\n\nIt was a raiding palaver. Some of the people of Akasava had crossed the\nriver to Ochori and stolen women and goats, and I believe there was a\nman or two killed, but that is unimportant. The goats and the women were\nalive, and cried aloud for vengeance. They cried so loud that down at\nheadquarters they were heard and Mr. Commissioner Niceman--that was not\nhis name, but it will serve--went up to see what all the noise was\nabout. He found the Ochori people very angry, but more frightened.\n\n\"If,\" said their spokesman, \"they will return our goats, they may keep\nthe women, because the goats are very valuable.\"\n\nSo Mr. Commissioner Niceman had a long, long palaver that lasted days\nand days, with the chief of the Akasava people and his councillors, and\nin the end moral suasion triumphed, and the people promised on a certain\nday, at a certain hour, when the moon was in such a quarter and the tide\nat such a height, the women should be returned and the goats also.\n\nSo Mr. Niceman returned to headquarters, swelling with admiration for\nhimself and wrote a long report about his genius and his administrative\nabilities, and his knowledge of the native, which was afterwards\npublished in Blue Book (Africa) 7943-96.\n\nIt so happened that Mr. Niceman immediately afterwards went home to\nEngland on furlough, so that he did not hear the laments and woeful\nwailings of the Ochori folk when they did not get their women or their\ngoats.\n\nSanders, working round the Isisi River, with ten Houssas and an attack\nof malaria, got a helio message:\n\n    \"Go Akasava and settle that infernal woman\n    palaver.--Administration.\"\n\nSo Sanders girded up his loins, took 25 grains of quinine, and leaving\nhis good work--he was searching for M'Beli, the witch-doctor, who had\npoisoned a friend--trekked across country for the Akasava.\n\nIn the course of time he came to the city and was met by the chief.\n\n\"What about these women?\" he asked.\n\n\"We will have a palaver,\" said the chief. \"I will summon my headmen and\nmy councillors.\"\n\n\"Summon nothing,\" said Sanders shortly. \"Send back the women and the\ngoats you stole from the Ochori.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the chief, \"at full moon, which is our custom, when the\ntide is so, and all signs of gods and devils are propitious, I will do\nas you bid.\"\n\n\"Chief,\" said Sanders, tapping the ebony chest of the other with the thin\nend of his walking-stick, \"moon and river, gods or devils, those women\nand the goats go back to the Ochori folk by sunset, or I tie you to a\ntree and flog you till you bleed.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the chief, \"the women shall be returned.\"\n\n\"And the goats,\" said Sanders.\n\n\"As to the goats,\" said the chief airily, \"they are dead, having been\nkilled for a feast.\"\n\n\"You will bring them back to life,\" said Sanders.\n\n\"Master, do you think I am a magician?\" asked the chief of the Akasava.\n\n\"I think you are a liar,\" said Sanders impartially, and there the\npalaver finished.\n\nThat night goats and women returned to the Ochori, and Sanders prepared\nto depart.\n\nHe took aside the chief, not desiring to put shame upon him or to weaken\nhis authority.\n\n\"Chief,\" he said, \"it is a long journey to Akasava, and I am a man\nfulfilling many tasks. I desire that you do not cause me any further\njourney to this territory.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the chief truthfully, \"I never wish to see you again.\"\n\nSanders smiled aside, collected his ten Houssas, and went back to the\nIsisi River to continue his search for M'Beli.\n\nIt was not a nice search for many causes, and there was every reason to\nbelieve, too, that the king of Isisi himself was the murderer's\nprotector. Confirmation of this view came one morning when Sanders,\nencamped by the Big River, was taking a breakfast of tinned milk and\ntoast. There arrived hurriedly Sato-Koto, the brother of the king, in\ngreat distress of mind, for he was a fugitive from the king's wrath. He\nbabbled forth all manner of news, in much of which Sanders took no\ninterest whatever. But what he said of the witch-doctor who lived in the\nking's shadow was very interesting indeed, and Sanders sent a messenger\nto headquarters, and, as it transpired, headquarters despatched in the\ncourse of time Mr. Niceman--who by this time had returned from\nfurlough--to morally \"suade\" the king of the Isisi.\n\nFrom such evidence as we have been able to collect it is evident that\nthe king was not in a melting mood. It is an indisputable fact that poor\nNiceman's head, stuck on a pole before the king's hut, proclaimed the\nking's high spirits.\n\nH.M.S. _St. George_, H.M.S. _Thrush_, H.M.S. _Philomel_, H.M.S. _Phoebe_\nsailed from Simonstown, and H.M.S. _Dwarf_ came down from Sierra Leone\n_hec dum_, and in less than a month after the king killed his guest he\nwished he hadn't.\n\nHeadquarters sent Sanders to clear up the political side of the mess.\n\nHe was shown round what was left of the king's city by the\nflag-lieutenant of the _St. George_.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said that gentleman, apologetically, \"I am afraid that\nyou will have to dig out a new king; we've rather killed the old one.\"\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"I shall not go into mourning,\" he said.\n\nThere was no difficulty in finding candidates for the vacant post.\nSato-Koto, the dead king's brother, expressed his willingness to assume\nthe cares of office with commendable promptitude.\n\n\"What do you say?\" asked the admiral, commanding the expedition.\n\n\"I say no, sir,\" said Sanders, without hesitation. \"The king has a son,\na boy of nine; the kingship must be his. As for Sato-Koto, he shall be\nregent at pleasure.\"\n\nAnd so it was arranged, Sato-Koto sulkily assenting.\n\nThey found the new king hidden in the woods with the women folk, and he\ntried to bolt, but Sanders caught him and led him back to the city by\nthe ear.\n\n\"My boy,\" he said kindly, \"how do people call you?\"\n\n\"Peter, master,\" whimpered the wriggling lad; \"in the fashion of the\nwhite people.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Sanders, \"you shall be King Peter, and rule this\ncountry wisely and justly according to custom and the law. And you shall\ndo hurt to none, and put shame on none nor shall you kill or raid or do\nany of the things that make life worth living, and if you break loose,\nmay the Lord help you!\"\n\nThus was King Peter appointed monarch of the Isisi people, and Sanders\nwent back to head-quarters with the little army of bluejackets and\nHoussas, for M'Beli, the witch-doctor, had been slain at the taking of\nthe city, and Sanders' work was finished.\n\nThe story of the taking of Isisi village, and the crowning of the young\nking, was told in the London newspapers, and lost nothing in the\ntelling. It was so described by the special correspondents, who\naccompanied the expedition, that many dear old ladies of Bayswater wept,\nand many dear young ladies of Mayfair said: \"How sweet!\" and the outcome\nof the many emotions which the description evoked was the sending out\nfrom England of Miss Clinton Calbraith, who was an M.A., and\nunaccountably pretty.\n\nShe came out to \"mother\" the orphan king, to be a mentor and a friend.\nShe paid her own passage, but the books which she brought and the school\nparaphernalia that filled two large packing cases were subscribed for\nby the tender readers of _Tiny Toddlers_, a magazine for infants.\nSanders met her on the landing-stage, being curious to see what a white\nwoman looked like.\n\nHe put a hut at her disposal and sent the wife of his coast clerk to\nlook after her.\n\n\"And now, Miss Calbraith,\" he said, at dinner that night, \"what do you\nexpect to do with Peter?\"\n\nShe tilted her pretty chin in the air reflectively.\n\n\"We shall start with the most elementary of lessons--the merest\nkindergarten, and gradually work up. I shall teach him calisthenics, a\nlittle botany--Mr. Sanders, you're laughing.\"\n\n\"No, I wasn't,\" he hastened to assure her; \"I always make a face like\nthat--er--in the evening. But tell me this--do you speak the\nlanguage--Swaheli, Bomongo, Fingi?\"\n\n\"That will be a difficulty,\" she said thoughtfully.\n\n\"Will you take my advice?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why, yes.\"\n\n\"Well, learn the language.\" She nodded. \"Go home and learn it.\" She\nfrowned. \"It will take you about twenty-five years.\"\n\n\"Mr. Sanders,\" she said, not without dignity, \"you are pulling--you are\nmaking fun of me.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\" said Sanders piously, \"that I should do anything so\nwicked.\"\n\nThe end of the story, so far as Miss Clinton Calbraith was concerned,\nwas that she went to Isisi, stayed three days, and came back\nincoherent.\n\n\"He is not a child!\" she said wildly; \"he is--a--a little devil!\"\n\n\"So I should say,\" said Sanders philosophically.\n\n\"A king? It is disgraceful! He lives in a mud hut and wears no clothes.\nIf I'd known!\"\n\n\"A child of nature,\" said Sanders blandly. \"You didn't expect a sort of\nLouis Quinze, did you?\"\n\n\"I don't know what I expected,\" she said desperately; \"but it was\nimpossible to stay--quite impossible.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" murmured Sanders.\n\n\"Of course, I knew he would be black,\" she went on; \"and I knew\nthat--oh, it was too horrid!\"\n\n\"The fact of it is, my dear young lady,\" said Sanders, \"Peter wasn't as\npicturesque as you imagined him; he wasn't the gentle child with\npleading eyes; and he lives messy--is that it?\"\n\nThis was not the only attempt ever made to educate Peter. Months\nafterwards, when Miss Calbraith had gone home and was busily writing her\nfamous book, \"Alone in Africa: by an English Gentlewoman,\" Sanders heard\nof another educative raid. Two members of an Ethiopian mission came into\nIsisi by the back way. The Ethiopian mission is made up of Christian\nblack men, who, very properly, basing their creed upon Holy Writ, preach\nthe gospel of Equality. A black man is as good as a white man any day of\nthe week, and infinitely better on Sundays if he happens to be a member\nof the Reformed Ethiopian Church.\n\nThey came to Isisi and achieved instant popularity, for the kind of talk\nthey provided was very much to the liking of Sato-Koto and the king's\ncouncillors.\n\nSanders sent for the missioners. The first summons they refused to obey,\nbut they came on the second occasion, because the message Sanders sent\nwas at once peremptory and ominous.\n\nThey came to headquarters, two cultured American negroes of good address\nand refined conversation. They spoke English faultlessly, and were in\nevery sense perfect gentlemen.\n\n\"We cannot understand the character of your command,\" said one, \"which\nsavours somewhat of interference with the liberty of the subject.\"\n\n\"You'll understand me better,\" said Sanders, who knew his men, \"when I\ntell you that I cannot allow you to preach sedition to my people.\"\n\n\"Sedition, Mr. Sanders!\" said the negro in shocked tones. \"That is a\ngrave charge.\"\n\nSanders took a paper from a pigeon-hole in his desk; the interview took\nplace in his office.\n\n\"On such a date,\" he said, \"you said this, and this, and that.\"\n\nIn other words he accused them of overstepping the creed of Equality and\nencroaching upon the borderland of political agitation.\n\n\"Lies!\" said the elder of the two, without hesitation.\n\n\"Truth or lies,\" he said, \"you go no more to Isisi.\"\n\n\"Would you have the heathen remain in darkness?\" asked the man, in\nreproach. \"Is the light we kindle too bright, master?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Sanders, \"but a bit too warm.\"\n\nSo he committed the outrage of removing the Ethiopians from the scene of\ntheir earnest labours, in consequence of which questions were asked in\nParliament.\n\nThen the chief of the Akasava people--an old friend--took a hand in the\neducation of King Peter. Akasava adjoins that king's territory, and the\nchief came to give hints in military affairs.\n\nHe came with drums a-beating, with presents of fish and bananas and\nsalt.\n\n\"You are a great king!\" he said to the sleepy-eyed boy who sat on a\nstool of state, regarding him with open-mouthed interest. \"When you walk\nthe world shakes at your tread; the mighty river that goes flowing down\nto the big water parts asunder at your word, the trees of the forest\nshiver, and the beasts go slinking to cover when your mightiness goes\nabroad.\"\n\n\"Oh, ko, ko!\" giggled the king, pleasantly tickled.\n\n\"The white men fear you,\" continued the chief of the Akasava; \"they\ntremble and hide at your roar.\"\n\nSato-Koto, standing at the king's elbow, was a practical man.\n\n\"What seek ye, chief?\" he asked, cutting short the compliments.\n\nSo the chief told him of a land peopled by cowards, rich with the\ntreasures of the earth, goats, and women.\n\n\"Why do you not take them yourself?\" demanded the regent.\n\n\"Because I am a slave,\" said the chief; \"the slave of Sandi, who would\nbeat me. But you, lord, are of the great; being king's headman, Sandi\nwould not beat you because of your greatness.\"\n\nThere followed a palaver, which lasted two days.\n\n\"I shall have to do something with Peter,\" wrote Sanders despairingly to\nthe Administrator; \"the little beggar has gone on the war-path against\nthose unfortunate Ochori. I should be glad if you would send me a\nhundred men, a Maxim, and a bundle of rattan canes; I'm afraid I must\nattend to Peter's education myself.\"\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n\"Lord, did I not speak the truth?\" said the Akasava chief in triumph.\n\"Sandi has done nothing! Behold, we have wasted the city of the Ochori,\nand taken their treasure, and the white man is dumb because of your\ngreatness! Let us wait till the moon comes again, and I will show you\nanother city.\"\n\n\"You are a great man,\" bleated the king, \"and some day you shall build\nyour hut in the shadow of my palace.\"\n\n\"On that day,\" said the chief, with splendid resignation, \"I shall die\nof joy.\"\n\nWhen the moon had waxed and waned and come again, a pencilled silver\nhoop of light in the eastern sky, the Isisi warriors gathered with spear\nand broad-bladed sword, with _ingola_ on their bodies, and clay in their\nhair.\n\nThey danced a great dance by the light of a huge fire, and all the women\nstood round, clapping their hands rhythmically.\n\nIn the midst of this there arrived a messenger in a canoe, who\nprostrated himself before the king, saying:\n\n\"Master, one day's march from here is Sandi; he has with him five score\nof soldiers and the brass gun which says: 'Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!'\"\n\nA silence reigned in court circles, which was broken by the voice of the\nAkasava chief.\n\n\"I think I will go home,\" he said. \"I have a feeling of sickness; also,\nit is the season when my goats have their young.\"\n\n\"Do not be afraid,\" said Sato-Koto brutally. \"The king's shadow is over\nyou, and he is so mighty that the earth shakes at his tread, and the\nwaters of the big river part at his footfall; also, the white men fear\nhim.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said the chief, with some agitation, \"I must go, for my\nyoungest son is sickening with fever, and calls all the time for me.\"\n\n\"Stay!\" said the regent, and there was no mistaking his tone.\n\nSanders did not come the next day, nor the next. He was moving\nleisurely, traversing a country where many misunderstandings existed\nthat wanted clearing up. When he arrived, having sent a messenger ahead\nto carry the news of his arrival, he found the city peaceably engaged.\n\nThe women were crushing corn, the men smoking, the little children\nplaying and sprawling about the streets.\n\nHe halted at the outskirts of the city, on a hillock that commanded the\nmain street, and sent for the regent.\n\n\"Why must I send for you?\" he asked. \"Why does the king remain in his\ncity when I come? This is shame.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said Sato-Koto, \"it is not fitting that a great king should so\nhumble himself.\"\n\nSanders was neither amused nor angry. He was dealing with a rebellious\npeople, and his own fine feelings were as nothing to the peace of the\nland.\n\n\"It would seem that the king has had bad advisers,\" he reflected aloud,\nand Sato-Koto shuffled uneasily.\n\n\"Go, now, and tell the king to come--for I am his friend.\"\n\nThe regent departed, but returned again alone.\n\n\"Lord, he will not come,\" he said sullenly.\n\n\"Then I will go to him,\" said Sanders.\n\nKing Peter, sitting before his hut, greeted Mr. Commissioner with\ndowncast eyes.\n\nSanders' soldiers, spread in a semi-circle before the hut, kept the\nrabble at bay.\n\n\"King,\" said Sanders--he carried in his hand a rattan cane of familiar\nshape, and as he spoke he whiffled it in the air, making a little\nhumming noise--\"stand up!\"\n\n\"Wherefore?\" said Sato-Koto.\n\n\"That you shall see,\" said Sanders.\n\nThe king rose reluctantly, and Sanders grabbed him by the scruff of his\nneck.\n\nSwish!\n\nThe cane caught him most undesirably, and he sprang into the air with a\nyell.\n\nSwish, swish, swish!\n\nYelling and dancing, throwing out wild hands to ward off the punishment,\nKing Peter blubbered for mercy.\n\n\"Master!\" Sato-Koto, his face distorted with rage, reached for his\nspear.\n\n\"Shoot that man if he interferes,\" said Sanders, without releasing the\nking.\n\nThe regent saw the levelled rifles and stepped back hastily.\n\n\"Now,\" said Sanders, throwing down the cane, \"now we will play a little\ngame.\"\n\n\"Wow-wow--oh, ko!\" sobbed his majesty.\n\n\"I go back to the forest,\" said Sanders. \"By and by a messenger shall\ncome to you, saying that the Commissioner is on his way. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Yi-hi!\" sobbed the king.\n\n\"Then will you go out with your councillors and your old men and await\nmy coming according to custom. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Ye-es, master,\" whimpered the boy.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Sanders, and withdrew his troops.\n\nIn half an hour came a grave messenger to the king, and the court went\nout to the little hill to welcome the white man.\n\nThis was the beginning of King Peter's education, for thus was he taught\nobedience.\n\nSanders went into residence in the town of Isisi, and held court.\n\n\"Sato-Koto,\" he said on the second day, \"do you know the village of\nIkan?\"\n\n\"Yes, master; it is two days' journey into the bush.\"\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"You will take your wives, your children, your servants, and your\npossessions to the village of Ikan, there to stay until I give you leave\nto return. The palaver is finished.\"\n\nNext came the chief of the Akasava, very ill at ease.\n\n\"Lord, if any man says I did you wrong, he lies,\" said the chief.\n\n\"Then I am a liar!\" said Sanders. \"For I say that you are an evil man,\nfull of cunning.\"\n\n\"If it should be,\" said the chief, \"that you order me to go to my\nvillage as you have ordered Sato-Koto, I will go, since he who is my\nfather is not pleased with me.\"\n\n\"That I order,\" said Sanders; \"also, twenty strokes with a stick, for\nthe good of your soul. Furthermore, I would have you remember that down\nby Tembeli on the great river there is a village where men labour in\nchains because they have been unfaithful to the Government and have\npractised abominations.\"\n\nSo the chief of the Akasava people went out to punishment.\n\nThere were other matters requiring adjustment, but they were of a minor\ncharacter, and when these were all settled to the satisfaction of\nSanders, but by no means to the satisfaction of the subjects, the\nCommissioner turned his attention to the further education of the king.\n\n\"Peter,\" he said, \"to-morrow when the sun comes up I go back to my own\nvillage, leaving you without councillors.\"\n\n\"Master, how may I do without councillors, since I am a young boy?\"\nasked the king, crestfallen and chastened.\n\n\"By saying to yourself when a man calls for justice: 'If I were this man\nhow should I desire the king's justice?'\"\n\nThe boy looked unhappy.\n\n\"I am very young,\" he repeated; \"and to-day there come many from\noutlying villages seeking redress against their enemies.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Sanders. \"To-day I will sit at the king's right hand\nand learn of his wisdom.\"\n\nThe boy stood on one leg in his embarrassment, and eyed Sanders askance.\n\nThere is a hillock behind the town. A worn path leads up to it, and\na-top is a thatched hut without sides. From this hillock you see the\nbroad river with its sandy shoals, where the crocodiles sleep with open\nmouth; you see the rising ground toward Akasava, hills that rise one on\ntop of the other, covered with a tangle of vivid green. In this house\nsits the king in judgment, beckoning the litigants forward. Sato-Koto\nwas wont to stand by the king, bartering justice.\n\nTo-day Sato-Koto was preparing to depart and Sanders sat by the king's\nside.\n\nThere were indeed many litigants.\n\nThere was a man who had bought a wife, giving no less than a thousand\nrods and two bags of salt for her. He had lived for three months with\nher, when she departed from his house.\n\n\"Because,\" said the man philosophically, \"she had a lover. Therefore,\nMighty Sun of Wisdom, I desire the return of my rods and my salt.\"\n\n\"What say you?\" said Sanders.\n\nThe king wriggled uncomfortably.\n\n\"What says the father?\" he said hesitatingly, and Sanders nodded.\n\n\"That is a wise question,\" he approved, and called the father, a\nvoluble and an eager old man.\n\n\"Now, king,\" he said hurriedly, \"I sold this woman, my daughter; how\nmight I know her mind? Surely I fulfil my contract when the woman goes\nto the man. How shall a father control when a husband fails?\"\n\nSanders looked at the king again, and the boy drew a long breath.\n\n\"It would seem, M'bleni, that the woman, your daughter, lived many years\nin your hut, and if you do not know her mind you are either a great fool\nor she is a cunning one. Therefore, I judge that you sold this woman\nknowing her faults. Yet the husband might accept some risk also. You\nshall take back your daughter and return 500 rods and a bag of salt, and\nif it should be that your daughter marries again, you shall pay one-half\nof her dowry to this man.\"\n\nVery, very slowly he gave judgment, hesitatingly, anxiously, glancing\nnow and again to the white man for his approval.\n\n\"That was good,\" said Sanders, and called forward another pleader.\n\n\"Lord king,\" said the new plaintiff, \"a man has put an evil curse on me\nand my family, so that they sicken.\"\n\nHere was a little poser for the little judge, and he puzzled the matter\nout in silence, Sanders offering no help.\n\n\"How does he curse you?\" at last asked the king.\n\n\"With the curse of death,\" said the complainant in a hushed voice.\n\n\"Then you shall curse him also,\" said the king, \"and it shall be a\nquestion of whose curse is the stronger.\"\n\nSanders grinned behind his hand, and the king, seeing the smile, smiled\nalso.\n\nFrom here onward Peter's progress was a rapid one, and there came to\nheadquarters from time to time stories of a young king who was a Solomon\nin judgment.\n\nSo wise he was (who knew of the formula he applied to each case?), so\nbeneficent, so peaceable, that the chief of the Akasava, from whom was\nperiodically due, took advantage of the gentle administration, and sent\nneither corn nor fish nor grain. He did this after a journey to far-away\nIkan, where he met the king's uncle, Sato-Koto, and agreed upon common\naction. Since the crops were good, the king passed the first fault, but\nthe second tribute became due, and neither Akasava nor Ikan sent, and\nthe people of Isisi, angry at the insolence, murmured, and the king sat\ndown in the loneliness of his hut to think upon a course which was just\nand effective.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n\"I really am sorry to bother you,\" wrote Sanders to the Administrator\nagain, \"but I shall have to borrow your Houssas for the Isisi country.\nThere has been a tribute palaver, and Peter went down to Ikan and wiped\nup his uncle; he filled in his spare time by giving the Akasava the\nworst licking they have ever had. I thoroughly approve of all that Peter\nhas done, because I feel that he is actuated only by the keenest sense\nof justice and a desire to do the right thing at the right time--and it\nwas time Sato-Koto was killed--though I shall have to reprimand Peter\nfor the sake of appearances. The Akasava chief is in the bush, hiding.\"\n\nPeter came back to his capital after his brief but strenuous campaign,\nleaving behind him two territories that were all the better for his\nvisit, though somewhat sore.\n\nThe young king brought together his old men, his witch-doctors, and\nother notabilities.\n\n\"By all the laws of white men,\" he said, \"I have done wrong to Sandi,\nbecause he has told me I must not fight, and, behold, I have destroyed\nmy uncle, who was a dog, and I have driven the chief of the Akasava into\nthe forest. But Sandi told me also that I must do what was just, and\nthat I have done according to my lights, for I have destroyed a man who\nput my people to shame. Now, it seems to me that there is only one thing\nto do, and that is to go to Sandi, telling the truth and asking him to\njudge.\"\n\n\"Lord king,\" said the oldest of his councillors, \"what if Sandi puts you\nto the chain-gang?\"\n\n\"That is with to-morrow,\" quoth the king, and gave orders for\npreparations to be made for departure.\n\nHalf-way to headquarters the two met; King Peter going down and Sanders\ncoming up. And here befell the great incident.\n\nNo word was spoken of Peter's fault before sunset; but when blue smoke\narose from the fires of Houssa and warrior, and the little camp in the\nforest clearing was all a-chatter, Sanders took the king's arm and led\nhim along the forest path.\n\nPeter told his tale and Sanders listened.\n\n\"And what of the chief of the Akasava?\" he asked.\n\n\"Master,\" said the king, \"he fled to the forest cursing me, and with him\nwent many bad men.\"\n\nSanders nodded again gravely.\n\nThey talked of many things till the sun threw long shadows, and then\nthey turned to retrace their footsteps. They were within half a mile of\nthe camp and the faint noise of men laughing, and the faint scent of\nfires burning came to them, when the chief of the Akasava stepped out\nfrom behind a tree and stood directly in their path. With him were some\neight fighting men fully armed.\n\n\"Lord king,\" said the chief of the Akasava, \"I have been waiting for\nyou.\"\n\nThe king made neither movement nor reply, but Sanders reached for his\nrevolver.\n\nHis hand closed on the butt, when something struck him and he went down\nlike a log.\n\n\"Now we will kill the king of the Isisi, and the white man also.\" The\nvoice was the chief's, but Sanders was not taking any particular\ninterest in the conversation, because there was a hive of wild bees\nbuzzing in his head, and a maze of pain; he felt sick.\n\n\"If you kill me it is little matter,\" said the king's voice, \"because\nthere are many men who can take my place; but if you slay Sandi, you\nslay the father of the people, and none can replace him.\"\n\n\"He whipped you, little king,\" said the chief of the Akasava mockingly.\n\n\"I would throw him into the river,\" said a strange voice after a long\ninterval; \"thus shall no trace be found of him, and no man will lay his\ndeath to our door.\"\n\n\"What of the king?\" said another. Then came a crackling of twigs and the\nvoices of men.\n\n\"They are searching,\" whispered a voice. \"King, if you speak I will kill\nyou now.\"\n\n\"Kill!\" said the young king's even voice, and shouted, \"Oh, M'sabo!\nBeteli! Sandi is here!\"\n\nThat was all Sandi heard.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nTwo days later he sat up in bed and demanded information. There was a\nyoung doctor with him when he woke, who had providentially arrived from\nheadquarters.\n\n\"The king?\" he hesitated. \"Well, they finished the king, but he saved\nyour life. I suppose you know that?\"\n\nSanders said \"Yes\" without emotion.\n\n\"A plucky little beggar,\" suggested the doctor.\n\n\"Very,\" said Sanders. Then: \"Did they catch the chief of the Akasava?\"\n\n\"Yes; he was so keen on finishing you that he delayed his bolting. The\nking threw himself on you and covered your body.\"\n\n\"That will do.\"\n\nSanders' voice was harsh and his manner brusque at the best of times,\nbut now his rudeness was brutal.\n\n\"Just go out of the hut, doctor--I want to sleep.\"\n\nHe heard the doctor move, heard the rattle of the \"chick\" at the hut\ndoor, then he turned his face to the wall and wept.\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER II.\n\n  KEEPERS OF THE STONE.\n\n\nThere is a people who live at Ochori in the big African forest on the\nIkeli River, who are called in the native tongue \"The Keepers of the\nStone.\"\n\nThere is a legend that years and years ago, _cala-cala_, there was a\nstrange, flat stone, \"inscribed with the marks of the devils\" (so the\ngrave native story-teller puts it), which was greatly worshipped and\nprized, partly for its magic powers, and partly because of the two\nghosts who guarded it.\n\nIt was a fetish of peculiar value to the mild people who lived in the\nbig forest, but the Akasava, who are neither mild nor reverential, and\nbeing, moreover, in need of gods, swooped down upon the Ochori one red\nmorning and came away with this wonderful stone and other movables.\nPresumably, the \"ghosts of brass\" went also. It was a great business,\nsecuring the stone, for it was set in a grey slab in the solid rock, and\nmany spear-heads were broken before it could be wrenched from its place.\nBut in the end it was taken away, and for several years it was the boast\nof the Akasava that they derived much benefit from this sacred\npossession. Then of a sudden the stone disappeared, and with it all the\ngood fortune of its owners. For the vanishing of the stone coincided\nwith the arrival of British rule, and it was a bad thing for the\nAkasava.\n\nThere came in these far-off days ('95?) a ridiculous person in white\nwith an escort of six soldiers. He brought a message of peace and good\nfellowship, and talked of a new king and a new law. The Akasava listened\nin dazed wonderment, but when they recovered they cut off his head, also\nthe heads of the escort. It seemed to be the only thing to do under the\ncircumstances.\n\nThen one morning the Akasava people woke to find the city full of\nstrange white folk, who had come swiftly up the river in steamboats.\nThere were too many to quarrel with, so the people sat quiet, a little\nfrightened and very curious, whilst two black soldiers strapped the\nhands and feet of the Akasava chief prior to hanging him by the neck\ntill he was dead.\n\nNor did the bad luck of the people end here; there came a lean year,\nwhen the manioc[1] root was bad and full of death-water, when goats\ndied, and crops were spoilt by an unexpected hurricane. There was always\na remedy at hand for a setback of this kind. If you have not the thing\nyou require, go and take it. So, following precedents innumerable, the\nAkasava visited the Ochori, taking away much grain, and leaving behind\ndead men and men who prayed for death. In the course of time the white\nmen came with their steamboats, their little brass guns, and the\nidentical block and tackle, which they fastened to the identical tree\nand utilised in the inevitable manner.\n\n\"It appears,\" said the new chief--who was afterwards hanged for the\nkilling of the king of the Isisi--\"that the white man's law is made to\nallow weak men to triumph at the expense of the strong. This seems\nfoolish, but it will be well to humour them.\"\n\nHis first act was to cut down the hanging-tree--it was too conspicuous\nand too significant. Then he set himself to discover the cause of all\nthe trouble which had come upon the Akasava. The cause required little\nappreciation. The great stone had been stolen, as he well knew, and the\nremedy resolved itself into a question of discovering the thief. The\nwretched Ochori were suspect.\n\n\"If we go to them,\" said the chief of the Akasava thoughtfully, \"killing\nthem very little, but rather burning them, so that they told where this\ngodstone was hidden, perhaps the Great Ones would forgive us.\"\n\n\"In my young days,\" said an aged councillor, \"when evil men would not\ntell where stolen things were buried, we put hot embers in their hands\nand bound them tightly.\"\n\n\"That is a good way,\" approved another old man, wagging his head\napplaudingly; \"also to tie men in the path of the soldier-ants has been\nknown to make them talkative.\"\n\n\"Yet we may not go up against the Ochori for many reasons,\" said the\nchief; \"the principal of which is that if the stone be with them we\nshall not overcome them owing to the two ghosts--though I do not\nremember that the ghosts were very potent in the days when the stone was\nwith us,\" he added, not without hope.\n\nThe little raid which followed and the search for the stone are told\nbriefly in official records. The search was fruitless, and the Akasava\nfolk must needs content themselves with such picking as came to hand.\n\nOf how Mr. Niceman, the deputy commissioner, and then Sanders himself,\ncame up, I have already told. That was long ago, as the natives say,\n_cala-cala_, and many things happened subsequently that put from the\nminds of the people all thought of the stone.\n\nIn course of time the chief of the Akasava died the death for various\nmisdoings, and peace came to the land that fringes Togo.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nSanders has been surprised twice in his life. Once was at Ikeli, which\nin the native tongue means \"little river.\" It is not a little river at\nall, but, on the contrary, a broad, strong, sullen stream that swirls\nand eddies and foams as it swings the corner of its tortuous course\nseaward. Sanders sat on a deck-chair placed under the awning of his tiny\nsteamer, and watched the river go rushing past. He was a contented man,\nfor the land was quiet and the crops were good. Nor was there any crime.\n\nThere was sleeping sickness at Bofabi, and beri-beri at Akasava, and in\nthe Isisi country somebody had discovered a new god, and, by all\naccounts that came down river, they worshipped him night and day.\n\nHe was not bothering about new gods, because gods of any kind were a\nbeneficent asset. Milini, the new king of the Isisi, had sent him word:\n\n\"Master,\" said his mouthpiece, the messenger, \"this new god lives in a\nbox which is borne upon the shoulders of priests. It is so long and so\nwide, and there are four sockets in which the poles fit, and the god\ninside is a very strong one, and full of pride.\"\n\n\"Ko, ko!\" said Sanders, with polite interest, \"tell the lord king, your\nmaster, that so long as this god obeys the law, he may live in the Isisi\ncountry, paying no tax. But if he tells the young men to go fighting, I\nshall come with a much stronger god, who will eat your god up. The\npalaver is finished.\"\n\nSanders, with his feet stretched out on the rail of the boat, thought of\nthe new god idly. When was it that the last had come? There was one in\nthe N'Gombi country years ago, a sad god who lived in a hut which no man\ndare approach; there was another god who came with thunder demanding\nsacrifice--human sacrifice. This was an exceptionally bad god, and had\ncost the British Government six hundred thousand pounds, because there\nwas fighting in the bush and a country unsettled. But, in the main, the\ngods were good, doing harm to none, for it is customary for new gods to\nmake their appearance after the crops are gathered, and before the rainy\nseason sets in.\n\nSo Sanders thought, sitting in the shade of a striped awning on the\nforedeck of the little _Zaire_.\n\nThe next day, before the sun came up, he turned the nose of the steamer\nup-stream, being curious as to the welfare of the shy Ochori folk, who\nlived too near the Akasava for comfort, and, moreover, needed nursing.\nVery slow was the tiny steamer's progress, for the current was strong\nagainst her. After two days' travel Sanders got into Lukati, where young\nCarter had a station.\n\nThe deputy commissioner came down to the beach in his pyjamas, with a\nbig pith helmet on the back of his head, and greeted his chief\nboisterously.\n\n\"Well?\" said Sanders; and Carter told him all the news. There was a land\npalaver at Ebibi; Otabo, of Bofabi, had died of the sickness; there were\ntwo leopards worrying the outlying villages, and----\n\n\"Heard about the Isisi god?\" he asked suddenly; and Sanders said that he\nhad.\n\n\"It's an old friend of yours,\" said Carter. \"My people tell me that this\nold god-box contains the stone of the Ochori.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Sanders, with sudden interest.\n\nHe breakfasted with his subordinate, inspected his little garrison of\nthirty, visited his farm, admired his sweet potatoes, and patronised his\ntomatoes.\n\nThen he went back to the boat and wrote a short dispatch in the tiniest\nof handwriting on the flimsiest of paper slips. \"In case!\" said Sanders.\n\n\"Bring me 14,\" he said to his servant, and Abiboo came back to him soon\nwith a pigeon in his hand.\n\n\"Now, little bird,\" said Sanders, carefully rolling his letter round the\nred leg of the tiny courier and fastening it with a rubber band, \"you've\ngot two hundred miles to fly before sunrise to-morrow--and 'ware hawks!\"\n\nThen he gathered the pigeon in his hand, walked with it to the stern of\nthe boat, and threw it into the air.\n\nHis crew of twelve men were sitting about their cooking-pot--that pot\nwhich everlastingly boils.\n\n\"Yoka!\" he called, and his half-naked engineer came bounding down the\nslope.\n\n\"Steam,\" said Sanders; \"get your wood aboard; I am for Isisi.\"\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nThere was no doubt at all that this new god was an extremely powerful\none. Three hours from the city the _Zaire_ came up to a long canoe with\nfour men standing at their paddles singing dolefully. Sanders remembered\nthat he had passed a village where women, their bodies decked with green\nleaves, wailed by the river's edge.\n\nHe slowed down till he came abreast of the canoe, and saw a dead man\nlying stark in the bottom.\n\n\"Where go you with this body?\" he asked.\n\n\"To Isisi, lord,\" was the answer.\n\n\"The middle river and the little islands are places for the dead,\" said\nSanders brusquely. \"It is folly to take the dead to the living.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the man who spoke, \"at Isisi lives a god who breathes life;\nthis man\"--he pointed downwards--\"is my brother, and he died very\nsuddenly because of a leopard. So quickly he died that he could not tell\nus where he had hidden his rods and his salt. Therefore we take him to\nIsisi, that the new god may give him just enough life to make his\nrelations comfortable.\"\n\n\"The middle river,\" said Sanders quietly, and pointed to such a lone\nisland, all green with tangled vegetation, as might make a burying\nground. \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Master, my name is N'Kema,\" said the man sullenly.\n\n\"Go, then, N'Kema,\" he said, and kept the steamer slow ahead whilst he\nwatched the canoe turn its blunt nose to the island and disembark its\ncargo.\n\nThen he rang the engines full ahead, steered clear of a sandbank, and\nregained the fairway.\n\nHe was genuinely concerned.\n\nThe stone was something exceptional in fetishes, needing delicate\nhandling. That the stone existed, he knew. There were legends\ninnumerable about it; and an explorer had, in the early days, seen it\nthrough his glasses. Also the \"ghosts clad in brass\" he had heard\nabout--these fantastic and warlike shades who made peaceable men go out\nto battle--all except the Ochori, who were never warlike, and whom no\nnumber of ghosts could incite to deeds of violence.\n\nYou will have remarked that Sanders took native people seriously, and\nthat, I remark in passing, is the secret of good government. To him,\nghosts were factors, and fetishes potent possibilities. A man who knew\nless would have been amused, but Sanders was not amused, because he had\na great responsibility. He arrived at the city of Isisi in the\nafternoon, and observed, even at a distance, that something unusual was\noccurring. The crowd of women and children that the arrival of the\nCommissioner usually attracted did not gather as he swung in from\nmid-stream and followed the water-path that leads to shoal.\n\nOnly the king and a handful of old men awaited him, and the king was\nnervous and in trouble.\n\n\"Lord,\" he blurted, \"I am no king in this city because of the new god;\nthe people are assembled on the far side of the hill, and there they sit\nnight and day watching the god in the box.\"\n\nSanders bit his lip thoughtfully, and said nothing.\n\n\"Last night,\" said the king, \"'The Keepers of the Stone' appeared\nwalking through the village.\"\n\nHe shivered, and the sweat stood in big beads on his forehead, for a\nghost is a terrible thing.\n\n\"All this talk of keepers of stones is folly,\" said Sanders calmly;\n\"they have been seen by your women and your unblooded boys.\"\n\n\"Lord, I saw them myself,\" said the king simply; and Sanders was\nstaggered, for the king was a sane man.\n\n\"The devil you have!\" said Sanders in English; then, \"What manner of\nghost were these?\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the king, \"they were white of face, like your greatness.\nThey wore brass upon their heads and brass upon their breasts. Their\nlegs were bare, but upon the lower legs was brass again.\"\n\n\"Any kind of ghost is hard enough to believe,\" said Sanders irritably,\n\"but a brass ghost I will not have at any price.\" He spoke English\nagain, as was his practice when he talked to himself, and the king\nstood silent, not understanding him.\n\n\"What else?\" said Sanders.\n\n\"They had swords,\" continued the chief, \"such as the elephant-hunters of\nthe N'Gombi people carry. Broad and short, and on their arms were\nshields.\"\n\nSanders was nonplussed.\n\n\"And they cry 'war,'\" said the chief. \"This is the greatest shame of\nall, for my young men dance the death dance and streak their bodies with\npaint and talk boastfully.\"\n\n\"Go to your hut,\" said Sanders; \"presently I will come and join you.\"\n\nHe thought and thought, smoking one black cigar after another, then he\nsent for Abiboo, his servant.\n\n\"Abiboo,\" he said, \"by my way of thinking, I have been a good master to\nyou.\"\n\n\"That is so, lord,\" said Abiboo.\n\n\"Now I will trust you to go amongst my crew discovering their gods. If I\nask them myself, they will lie to me out of politeness, inventing this\ngod and that, thinking they please me.\"\n\nAbiboo chose the meal hour, when the sun had gone out and the world was\ngrey and the trees motionless. He came back with the information as\nSanders was drinking his second cup of coffee in the loneliness of the\ntiny deck-house.\n\n\"Master,\" he reported, \"three men worship no god whatever, three more\nhave especial family fetishes, and two are Christians more or less, and\nthe four Houssas are with me in faith.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\nAbiboo, the Kano boy, smiled at Sanders' assumption of innocence.\n\n\"Lord,\" he said, \"I follow the Prophet, believing only in the one God,\nbeneficent and merciful.\"\n\n\"That is good,\" said Sanders. \"Now let the men load wood, and Yoka shall\nhave steam against moonrise, and all shall be ready for slipping.\"\n\nAt ten o'clock by his watch he fell-in his four Houssas, serving out to\neach a short carbine and a bandoleer. Then the party went ashore.\n\nThe king in his patience sat in his hut, and Sanders found him.\n\n\"You will stay here, Milini,\" he commanded, \"and no blame shall come to\nyou for anything that may happen this night.\"\n\n\"What will happen, master?\"\n\n\"Who knows!\" said Sanders, philosophically.\n\nThe streets were in pitch darkness, but Abiboo, carrying a lantern, led\nthe way. Only occasionally did the party pass a tenanted hut. Generally\nthey saw by the dull glow of the log that smouldered in every habitation\nthat it was empty. Once a sick woman called to them in passing. It was\nnear her time, she said, and there was none to help her in the supreme\nmoment of her agony.\n\n\"God help you, sister!\" said Sanders, ever in awe of the mysteries of\nbirth. \"I will send women to you. What is your name?\"\n\n\"They will not come,\" said the plaintive voice. \"To-night the men go out\nto war, and the women wait for the great dance.\"\n\n\"To-night?\"\n\n\"To-night, master--so the ghosts of brass decree.\"\n\nSanders made a clicking noise with his mouth.\n\n\"That we shall see,\" he said, and went on.\n\nThe party reached the outskirts of the city. Before them, outlined\nagainst a bronze sky, was the dark bulk of a little hill, and this they\nskirted.\n\nThe bronze became red, and rose, and dull bronze again, as the fires\nthat gave it colour leapt or fell. Turning the shoulder of the hill,\nSanders had a full view of the scene.\n\nBetween the edge of the forest and slope of the hill was a broad strip\nof level land. On the left was the river, on the right was swamp and\nforest again.\n\nIn the very centre of the plain a huge fire burnt. Before it, supported\nby its poles, on two high trestles, a square box.\n\nBut the people!\n\nA huge circle, squatting on its haunches, motionless, silent; men,\nwomen, children, tiny babies, at their mothers' hips they stretched; a\nsolid wheel of humanity, with the box and the fire as a hub.\n\nThere was a lane through which a man might reach the box--a lane along\nwhich passed a procession of naked men, going and returning. These were\nthey who replenished the fire, and Sanders saw them dragging fuel for\nthat purpose. Keeping to the edge of the crowd, he worked his way to the\nopening. Then he looked round at his men.\n\n\"It is written,\" he said, in the curious Arabic of the Kano people,\n\"that we shall carry away this false god. As to which of us shall live\nor die through this adventure, that is with Allah, who knows all\nthings.\"\n\nThen he stepped boldly along the lane. He had changed his white ducks\nfor a dark blue uniform suit, and he was not observed by the majority\nuntil he came with his Houssas to the box. The heat from the fire was\nterrific, overpowering. Close at hand he saw that the fierceness of the\nblaze had warped the rough-hewn boards of the box, and through the\nopening he saw in the light a slab of stone.\n\n\"Take up the box quickly,\" he commanded, and the Houssas lifted the\npoles to their shoulders. Until then the great assembly had sat in\nsilent wonder, but as the soldiers lifted their burden, a yell of rage\nburst from five thousand throats, and men leapt to their feet.\n\nSanders stood before the fire, one hand raised, and silence fell,\ncuriosity dominating resentment.\n\n\"People of the Isisi,\" said Sanders, \"let no man move until the\ngod-stone has passed, for death comes quickly to those who cross the\npath of gods.\"\n\nHe had an automatic pistol in each hand, and the particular deity he was\nthinking of at the moment was not the one in the box.\n\nThe people hesitated, surging and swaying, as a mob will sway in its\nuncertainty.\n\nWith quick steps the bearers carried their burden through the lane; they\nhad almost passed unmolested when an old woman shuffled forward and\nclutched at Sanders' arm.\n\n\"Lord, lord!\" she quavered, \"what will you do with our god?\"\n\n\"Take him to the proper place,\" said Sanders, \"being by Government\nappointed his keeper.\"\n\n\"Give me a sign,\" she croaked, and the people in her vicinity repeated,\n\"A sign, master!\"\n\n\"This is a sign,\" said Sanders, remembering the woman in labour. \"By the\ngod's favour there shall be born to Ifabi, wife of Adako, a male child.\"\n\nHe heard the babble of talk; he heard his message repeated over the\nheads of the crowd; he saw a party of women go scurrying back to the\nvillage; then he gave the order to march. There were murmurings, and\nonce he heard a deep-voiced man begin the war-chant, but nobody joined\nhim. Somebody--probably the same man--clashed his spear against his\nwicker shield, but his warlike example was not followed. Sanders gained\nthe village street. Around him was such a press of people that he\nfollowed the swaying box with difficulty. The river was in sight; the\nmoon, rising a dull, golden ball over the trees, laced the water with\nsilver, and then there came a scream of rage.\n\n\"He lies! He lies! Ifabi, the wife of Adako, has a female child.\"\n\nSanders turned swiftly like a dog at bay; his lips upcurled in a snarl,\nhis white, regular teeth showing.\n\n\"Now,\" said Sanders, speaking very quickly, \"let any man raise his\nspear, and he dies.\"\n\nAgain they stood irresolute, and Sanders, over his shoulder, gave an\norder.\n\nFor a moment only the people hesitated; then, as the soldiers gripped\nthe poles of the god-box, with one fierce yell they sprang forward.\n\nA voice screamed something; and, as if by magic, the tumult ceased, and\nthe crowd darted backward and outward, falling over one another in their\nfrantic desire to escape.\n\nSanders, his pistol still loaded, stood in open-mouthed astonishment at\nthe stampede.\n\nSave for his men he was alone; and then he saw.\n\nAlong the centre of the street two men were walking. They were clad\nalike in short crimson kilts that left their knees bare; great brass\nhelmets topped their heads, and brass cuirasses covered their breasts.\n\nSanders watched them as they came nearer, then: \"If this is not fever,\nit is madness,\" he muttered, for what he saw were two Roman centurions,\ntheir heavy swords girt about their waists.\n\nHe stood still, and they passed him, so close that he saw on the boss of\none shield the rough-moulded letters:--\n\n  \"AUGUSTUS CAE.\"\n\n\"Fever\" said Sanders emphatically, and followed the box to the ship.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nWhen the steamer reached Lukati, Sanders was still in a condition of\ndoubt, for his temperature was normal, and neither fever nor sun could\nbe held accountable for the vision. Added to which, his men had seen the\nsame thing.\n\nHe found the reinforcements his pigeon had brought, but they were\nunnecessary now.\n\n\"It beats me,\" he confessed to Carter, telling the story; \"but we'll get\nout the stone; it might furnish an explanation. Centurions--bah!\"\n\nThe stone, exposed in the light of day, was of greyish granite, such as\nSanders did not remember having seen before.\n\n\"Here are the 'devil marks,'\" he said, as he turned it over.\n\"Possibly--whew!\"\n\nNo wonder he whistled, for closely set were a number of printed\ncharacters; and Carter, blowing the dust, saw--\n\n  \"MARIUS ET AUGUSTUS\n  CENT . . . . . . . . . NERO\n  IMPERAT . . . . . IN DEUS\n  . . . . . DULCE.\"\n\nThat night, with great labour, Sanders, furbishing his rusty Latin, and\nfilling in gaps, made a translation:\n\n  \"Marius and Augustus,\n  Centurions of Nero, Csar and\n  Emperor,\n  Sleep sweetly with the gods.\"\n\n    \"We are they who came beyond the wild lands which Hanno, the\n    Carthaginian, found . . .\n\n    \"Marcus Septimus went up into Egypt, and with him Decimus\n    Superbus, but by the will of Csar, and the favour of the gods,\n    we sailed to the black seas beyond. . . . . Here we lived, our\n    ships suffering wreck, being worshipped by the barbarians,\n    teaching them warlike practices.\n\n    . . . \"You who come after . . . bear greetings to Rome to Cato\n    Hippocritus, who dwells by the gate . . .\"\n\nSanders shook his head when he had finished reading, and said it was\n\"rum.\"\n\n[Footnote 1: There is a tremendous amount of free hydrocyanic acid\n(prussic acid) in manioc.]\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER III.\n\n  BOSAMBO OF MONROVIA.\n\n\nFor many years have the Ochori people formed a sort of grim comic relief\nto the tragedy of African colonisation. Now it may well be that we shall\nlaugh at the Ochori no more. Nor, in the small hours of the night, when\nconversation flags in the little circle about the fires in fishing\ncamps, shall the sleepy-eyed be roused to merriment by stories of Ochori\nmeekness. All this has come about by favour of the Liberian Government,\nthough at present the Liberian Government is not aware of the fact.\n\nWith all due respect to the Republic of Liberia, I say that the\nMonrovians are naturally liars and thieves.\n\nOnce upon a time, that dignity might be added to the State, a warship\nwas acquired--if I remember aright it was presented by a disinterested\nshipowner. The Government appointed three admirals, fourteen captains,\nand as many officers as the ship would hold, and they all wore gorgeous\nbut ill-fitting uniforms. The Government would have appointed a crew\nalso, but for the fact that the ship was not big enough to hold any\nlarger number of people than its officers totalled.\n\nThis tiny man-of-war of the black republic went to sea once, the\nadmirals and captains taking it in turn to stoke and steer--a very\npleasing and novel sensation, this latter.\n\nComing back into the harbour, one of the admirals said--\n\n\"It is my turn to steer now,\" and took the wheel.\n\nThe ship struck a rock at the entrance of the harbour and went down. The\nofficers escaped easily enough, for your Monrovian swims like a fish,\nbut their uniforms were spoilt by the sea water. To the suggestion that\nsalvage operations should be attempted to refloat the warship, the\nGovernment very wisely said no, they thought not.\n\n\"We know where she is,\" said the President--he was sitting on the edge\nof his desk at Government House, eating sardines with his fingers--\"and\nif we ever want her, it will be comforting to know she is so close to\nus.\"\n\nNothing more would have been done in the matter but for the fact that\nthe British Admiralty decided that the wreck was a danger to shipping,\nand issued orders forthwith for the place where it lay to be buoyed.\n\nThe Liberian Government demurred on account of expense, but on pressure\nbeing applied (I suspect the captain of H.M.S. _Dwarf_, who was a man\nwith a bitter tongue) they agreed, and the bell-buoy was anchored to the\nsubmerged steamer.\n\nIt made a nice rowdy, clanging noise, did that bell, and the people of\nMonrovia felt they were getting their money's worth.\n\nBut all Monrovia is not made up of the freed American slaves who were\nsettled there in 1821. There are people who are described in a lordly\nfashion by the true Monrovians as \"indigenous natives,\" and the chief\nof these are the Kroomen, who pay no taxes, defy the Government, and at\nintervals tweak the official nose of the Republic.\n\nThe second day after the bell was in place, Monrovia awoke to find a\ncomplete silence reigning in the bay, and that in spite of a heavy\nswell. The bell was still, and two ex-admirals, who were selling fish on\nthe foreshore, borrowed a boat and rowed out to investigate. The\nexplanation was simple--the bell had been stolen.\n\n\"Now!\" said the President of the Liberian Republic in despair, \"may\nBeelzebub, who is the father and author of all sin, descend upon these\nthieving Kroomen!\"\n\nAnother bell was attached. The same night it was stolen. Yet another\nbell was put to the buoy, and a boat-load of admirals kept watch.\nThroughout the night they sat, rising and falling with the swell, and\nthe monotonous \"clang-jangle-clong\" was music in their ears. All night\nit sounded, but in the early morning, at the dark hour before the sun\ncomes up, it seemed that the bell, still tolling, grew fainter and\nfainter.\n\n\"Brothers,\" said an admiral, \"we are drifting away from the bell.\"\n\nBut the explanation was that the bell had drifted away from them, for,\ntired of half measures, the Kroomen had come and taken the buoy, bell\nand all, and to this day there is no mark to show where a sometime\nman-of-war rots in the harbour of Monrovia.\n\nThe ingenious soul who planned and carried out this theft was one\nBosambo, who had three wives, one of whom, being by birth Congolaise,\nand untrustworthy, informed the police, and with some ceremony Bosambo\nwas arrested and tried at the Supreme Court, where he was found guilty\nof \"theft and high treason\" and sentenced to ten years' penal servitude.\n\nThey took Bosambo back to prison, and Bosambo interviewed the black\ngaoler.\n\n\"My friend,\" he said, \"I have a big ju-ju in the forest, and if you do\nnot release me at once you and your wife shall die in great torment.\"\n\n\"Of your ju-ju I know nothing,\" said the gaoler philosophically, \"but I\nreceive two dollars a week for guarding prisoners, and if I let you\nescape I shall lose my job.\"\n\n\"I know a place where there is much silver hidden,\" said Bosambo with\npromptitude. \"You and I will go to this place, and we shall be rich.\"\n\n\"If you knew where there was silver, why did you steal bells, which are\nof brass and of no particular value?\" asked his unimaginative guard.\n\n\"I see that you have a heart of stone,\" said Bosambo, and went away to\nthe forest settlement to chop down trees for the good of the State.\n\nFour months after this, Sanders, Chief Commissioner for the Isisi,\nIkeli, and Akasava countries, received, _inter alia_, a communication of\na stereotyped description--\n\n    TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.\n\n    Wanted,--on a warrant issued by H.E. the President of Liberia,\n    Bosambo Krooboy, who escaped from the penal settlement near\n    Monrovia, after killing a guard. He is believed to be making for\n    your country.\n\nA description followed.\n\nSanders put the document away with other such notices--they were not\ninfrequent in their occurrence--and gave his mind to the eternal problem\nof the Ochori.\n\nNow, as ever, the Ochori people were in sad trouble. There is no other\ntribe in the whole of Africa that is as defenceless as the poor Ochori.\nThe Fingoes, slaves as they are by name and tradition, were ferocious as\nthe Masai, compared with the Ochori.\n\nSanders was a little impatient, and a deputation of three, who had\njourneyed down to headquarters to lay the grievances of the people\nbefore him, found him unsympathetic.\n\nHe interviewed them on his verandah.\n\n\"Master, no man leaves us in peace,\" said one. \"Isisi folk, N'Gombi\npeople from far-away countries, they come to us demanding this and that,\nand we give, being afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid of what?\" asked Sanders wearily.\n\n\"We fear death and pain, also burning and the taking of our women,\" said\nthe other.\n\n\"Who is chief of you?\" asked Sanders, wilfully ignorant.\n\n\"I am chief lord,\" said an elderly man, clad in a leopard skin.\n\n\"Go back to your people, chief, if indeed chief you are, and not some\nold woman without shame; go back and bear with you a fetish--a most\npowerful fetish--which shall be, as me, watching your interest and\nprotecting you. This fetish you shall plant on the edge of your village\nthat faces the sun at noon. You shall mark the place where it shall be\nplanted, and at midnight, with proper ceremony, and the sacrifice of a\nyoung goat, you shall set my fetish in its place. And after that\nwhosoever ill-treats you or robs you shall do so at some risk.\"\n\nSanders said this very solemnly, and the men of the deputation were duly\nimpressed. More impressed were they when, before starting on their\nhomeward journey, Sanders placed in their hands a stout pole, to the end\nof which was attached a flat board inscribed with certain marks.\n\nThey carried their trophy six days' journey through the forest, then\nfour days' journey by canoe along the Little River, until they came to\nOchori. There, by the light of the moon, with the sacrifice of two goats\n(to make sure), the pole was planted so that the board inscribed with\nmystic characters would face the sun at noon.\n\nNews travels fast in the back lands, and it came to the villages\nthroughout the Isisi and the Akasava country that the Ochori were\nparticularly protected by white magic. Protected they had always been,\nand many men had died at the white man's hand because the temptation to\nkill the Ochori folk had proved irresistible.\n\n\"I do not believe that Sandi has done this thing,\" said the chief of the\nAkasava. \"Let us go across the river and see with our own eyes, and if\nthey have lied we shall beat them with sticks, though let no man kill,\nbecause of Sandi and his cruelty.\"\n\nSo across the water they went, and marched until they came within sight\nof the Ochori city, and the Ochori people, hearing that the Akasava\npeople were coming, ran away into the woods and hid, in accordance with\ntheir custom.\n\nThe Akasava advanced until they came to the pole stuck in the ground and\nthe board with the devil marks.\n\nBefore this they stood in silence and in awe, and having made obeisance\nto it and sacrificed a chicken (which was the lawful property of the\nOchori) they turned back.\n\nAfter this came a party from Isisi, and they must needs come through the\nAkasava country.\n\nThey brought presents with them and lodged with the Akasava for one\nnight.\n\n\"What story is this of the Ochori?\" asked the Isisi chief in command; so\nthe chief of the Akasava told him.\n\n\"You may save yourself the journey, for we have seen it.\"\n\n\"That,\" said the Isisi chief, \"I will believe when I have seen.\"\n\n\"That is bad talk,\" said the Akasava people, who were gathered at the\npalaver; \"these dogs of Isisi call us liars.\"\n\nNevertheless there was no bloodshed, and in the morning the Isisi went\non their way.\n\nThe Ochori saw them coming, and hid in the woods, but the precaution was\nunnecessary, for the Isisi departed as they came.\n\nOther folk made a pilgrimage to the Ochori, N'Gombi, Bokeli, and the\nLittle People of the Forest, who were so shy that they came by night,\nand the Ochori people began to realise a sense of their importance.\n\nThen Bosambo, a Krooman and an adventurer at large, appeared on the\nscene, having crossed eight hundred miles of wild land in the earnest\nhope that time would dull the memory of the Liberian Government and\nincidentally bring him to a land of milk and honey.\n\nNow Bosambo had in his life been many things. He had been steward on an\nElder Dempster boat, he had been scholar at a mission school--he was the\nproud possessor of a bound copy of _The Lives of the Saints_, a reward\nof industry--and among his accomplishments was a knowledge of English.\n\nThe hospitable Ochori received him kindly, fed him with sweet manioc\nand sugar-cane, and told him about Sandi's magic. After he had eaten,\nBosambo walked down to the post and read the inscription--\n\n  TRESPASSERS BEWARE.\n\nHe was not impressed, and strolled back again thinking deeply.\n\n\"This magic,\" he said to the chief, \"is good magic. I know, because I\nhave white man's blood in my veins.\"\n\nIn support of this statement he proceeded to libel a perfectly innocent\nBritish official at Sierra Leone.\n\nThe Ochori were profoundly moved. They poured forth the story of their\npersecutions, a story which began in remote ages, when Tiganobeni, the\ngreat king, came down from the north and wasted the country as far south\nas the Isisi.\n\nBosambo listened--it took two nights and the greater part of a day to\ntell the story, because the official story-teller of the Ochori had only\none method of telling--and when it was finished Bosambo said to\nhimself--\n\n\"This is the people I have long sought. I will stay here.\"\n\nAloud he asked:\n\n\"How often does Sandi come to you?\"\n\n\"Once every year, master,\" said the chief, \"on the twelfth moon, and a\nlittle after.\"\n\n\"When came he last?\"\n\n\"When this present moon is at full, three moons since; he comes after\nthe big rains.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Bosambo, again to himself, \"for nine months I am safe.\"\n\nThey built him a hut and planted for him a banana grove and gave him\nseed. Then he demanded for wife the daughter of the chief, and although\nhe offered nothing in payment the girl came to him. That a stranger\nlived in the chief village of the Ochori was remarked by the other\ntribes, for news of this kind spreads, but since he was married, and\ninto the chief's family at that, it was accepted that the man must be of\nthe Ochori folk, and such was the story that came to headquarters. Then\nthe chief of the Ochori died. He died suddenly in some pain; but such\ndeaths are common, and his son ruled in his place. Then the son died\nafter the briefest reign, and Bosambo called the people together, the\nelders, the wise men, and the headmen of the country.\n\n\"It appears,\" he said, \"that the many gods of the Ochori are displeased\nwith you, and it has been revealed to me in a dream that I shall be\nchief of the Ochori. Therefore, O chiefs and wise men and headmen, bow\nbefore me, as is the custom, and I will make you a great people.\"\n\nIt is characteristic of the Ochori that no man said \"nay\" to him, even\nthough in the assembly were three men who by custom might claim the\nchieftainship.\n\nSanders heard of the new chief and was puzzled.\n\n\"Etabo?\" he repeated--this was how Bosambo called himself--\"I do not\nremember the man--yet if he can put backbone into the people I do not\ncare who he is.\"\n\nBackbone or cunning, or both, Bosambo was certainly installed.\n\n\"He has many strange practices,\" reported a native agent to Sanders.\n\"Every day he assembles the men of the village and causes them to walk\npast a _pelebi_ (table) on which are many eggs. And it is his command\nthat each man as he passes shall take an egg so swiftly that no eye may\nsee him take it. And if the man bungle or break the egg, or be slow,\nthis new chief puts shame upon him, whipping him.\"\n\n\"It is a game,\" said Sanders; but for the life of him he could not see\nwhat game it was. Report after report reached him of the new chief's\nmadness. Sometimes he would take the unfortunate Ochori out by night,\nteaching them such things as they had never known before. Thus he\ninstructed them in what manner they might seize upon a goat so that the\ngoat could not cry. Also how to crawl on their bellies inch by inch so\nthat they made no sound or sign. All these things the Ochori did,\ngroaning aloud at the injustice and the labour of it.\n\n\"I'm dashed if I can understand it!\" said Sanders, knitting his brows,\nwhen the last report came in. \"With anybody but the Ochori this would\nmean war. But the Ochori!\"\n\nNotwithstanding his contempt for their fighting qualities, he kept his\nPolice Houssas ready.\n\nBut there was no war. Instead, there came complaint from the Akasava\nthat \"many leopards were in the woods.\"\n\nLeopards will keep, thought Sanders, and, anyway, the Akasava were good\nenough hunters to settle that palaver without outside help. The next\nreport was alarming. In two weeks these leopards had carried off three\nscore of goats, twenty bags of salt, and much ivory.\n\nLeopards eat goats; there might conceivably be fastidious leopards that\ncannot eat goats without salt; but a leopard does not take ivory tusks\neven to pick his teeth with. So Sanders made haste to journey up the\nriver, because little things were considerable in a country where people\nstrain at gnats and swallow whole caravans.\n\n\"Lord, it is true,\" said the chief of the Akasava, with some emotion,\n\"these goats disappear night by night, though we watch them; also the\nsalt and ivory, because that we did not watch.\"\n\n\"But no leopard could take these things,\" said Sanders irritably. \"These\nare thieves.\"\n\nThe chief's gesture was comprehensive.\n\n\"Who could thieve?\" he said. \"The N'Gombi people live very far away;\nalso the Isisi. The Ochori are fools, and, moreover, afraid.\"\n\nThen Sanders remembered the egg games, and the midnight manoeuvres of\nthe Ochori.\n\n\"I will call on this new chief,\" he said; and crossed the river that\nday.\n\nSending a messenger to herald his coming, he waited two miles out of the\ncity, and the councillors and wise men came out to him with offerings of\nfish and fruit.\n\n\"Where is your chief?\" he asked.\n\n\"Lord, he is ill,\" they said gravely. \"This day there came to him a\nfeeling of sickness, and he fell down moaning. We have carried him to\nhis hut.\"\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"I will see him,\" he said grimly.\n\nThey led him to the door of the chief's hut, and Sanders went in. It was\nvery dark, and in the darkest corner lay a prostrate man. Sanders bent\nover him, touched his pulse lightly, felt gingerly for the swelling on\nthe neck behind the ears for a sign of sleeping sickness. No symptom\ncould he find; but on the bare shoulder, as his fingers passed over the\nman's flesh, he felt a scar of singular regularity; then he found\nanother, and traced their direction. The convict brand of the Monrovian\nGovernment was familiar to him.\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Sanders, and gave the moaning man a vigorous kick.\n\n\"Come out into the light, Bosambo of Monrovia,\" he said; and Bosambo\nrose obediently and followed the Commissioner into the light.\n\nThey stood looking at one another for several minutes; then Sanders,\nspeaking in the dialect of the Pepper Coast, said--\n\n\"I have a mind to hang you, Bosambo.\"\n\n\"That is as your Excellency wishes,\" said Bosambo.\n\nSanders said nothing, tapping his boot with his walking-stick and gazing\nthoughtfully downward.\n\n\"Having made thieves, could you make men of these people?\" he said,\nafter a while.\n\n\"I think they could fight now, for they are puffed with pride because\nthey have robbed the Akasava,\" said Bosambo.\n\nSanders bit the end of his stick like a man in doubt.\n\n\"There shall be neither theft nor murder,\" he said. \"No more chiefs or\nchiefs' sons shall die suddenly,\" he added significantly.\n\n\"Master, it shall be as you desire.\"\n\n\"As for the goats you have stolen, them you may keep, and the teeth\n(ivory) and the salt also. For if you hand them back to Akasava you will\nfill their stomachs with rage, and that would mean war.\"\n\nBosambo nodded slowly.\n\n\"Then you shall remain, for I see you are a clever man, and the Ochori\nneed such as you. But if----\"\n\n\"Master, by the fat of my heart I will do as you wish,\" said Bosambo;\n\"for I have always desired to be a chief under the British.\"\n\nSanders was half-way back to headquarters before he missed his\nfield-glasses, and wondered where he could have dropped them. At that\nidentical moment Bosambo was exhibiting the binoculars to his admiring\npeople.\n\n\"From this day forth,\" said Bosambo, \"there shall be no lifting of goats\nnor stealing of any kind. This much I told the great Sandi, and as a\nsign of his love, behold, he gave me these things of magic that eat up\nspace.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said a councillor in awe, \"did you know the Great One?\"\n\n\"I have cause to know him,\" said Bosambo modestly, \"for I am his son.\"\n\nFortunately Sanders knew nothing of this interesting disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER IV.\n\n  THE DROWSY ONE.\n\n\nThere were occasions when Sanders came up against the outer world, when\nhe learnt, with something like bewilderment, that beyond the farthermost\nforests, beyond the lazy, swelling, blue sea, there were men and women\nwho lived in houses and carefully tabooed such subjects as violent death\nand such horrid happenings as were daily features of his life.\n\nHe had to treat with folk who, in the main, were illogical and who\nbelieved in spirits. When you deal in the abstract with government of\nraces so influenced, a knowledge of constitutional law and economics is\nfairly valueless.\n\nThere is one type of man that can rule native provinces wisely, and that\ntype is best represented by Sanders.\n\nThere are other types, as, for instance:\n\nOnce upon a time a young man came from England with a reputation. He was\nsent by the Colonial Office to hold a district under Sanders as Deputy\nCommissioner. He was a Bachelor of Law, had read Science, and had\nacquired in a methodical fashion a working acquaintance with Swaheli,\nbacteriology, and medicines. He was a very grave young man, and the\nfirst night of his arrival he kept Sanders (furtively yawning) out of\nhis bed whilst he demonstrated a system whereby the aboriginal could be\nconverted--not converted spiritually, but from unproductive vagrancy to\na condition of good citizenship.\n\nSanders said nothing beyond using the conventional expressions of polite\ninterest, and despatched the young man and his tremendous baggage to an\nup-country station, with his official blessing.\n\nTorrington--this was the grave young man's name--established himself at\nEntoli, and started forth to instil into the heathen mind the elementary\nprinciples of applied mechanics. In other words he taught them, through\nthe medium of Swaheli--which they imperfectly understood--and a tin\nkettle, the lesson of steam. They understood the kettle part, but could\nnot quite comprehend what meat he was cooking, and when he explained for\nthe fortieth time that he was only cooking water, they glanced\nsignificantly one at the other and agreed that he was not quite right in\nhis head.\n\nThey did not tell him this much to his face, for cannibals have very\ngood manners--though their table code leaves much to be desired.\n\nMr. Torrington tried them with chemical experiments, showing them how\nsulphuric acid applied to sugar produced Su^{2}, Su^{4}, or words to\nthat effect. He gained a reputation as a magician as a result, and in\nmore huts than one he was regarded and worshipped as a Great and Clever\nDevil--which in a sense he was. But the first time he came up against\nthe spirit of the people, his science, his law, and his cut-and-dried\ntheories went _phutt_! And that is where Sanders came in--Sanders who\nhad forgotten all the chemistry he ever knew, and who, as a student of\nConstitutional Law, was the rankest of failures.\n\nIt came about in this way.\n\nThere was a young man in Isisi who prophesied that on such a day, at\nsuch an hour, the river would rise and drown the people. When Mr.\nTorrington heard of this prophecy he was amused, and at first took no\nnotice of it. But it occurred to him that here might be a splendid\nopportunity for revealing to the barbarian a little of that science with\nwhich he was so plentifully endowed.\n\nSo he drew a large sectional plan, showing--\n\n  (_a_) the bed of the river;\n  (_b_) the height of the banks;\n  (_c_) the maximum rise of the river;\n  (_d_) the height of the surrounding country; and demonstrated as\n          plainly as possible the utter absurdity of the prophecy.\n\nYet the people were unconvinced, and were preparing to abandon the\nvillage when Sanders arrived on the scene. He sent for the prophet, who\nwas a young man of neurotic tendencies, and had a wooden prison cage\nbuilt on the bank of the river, into which the youth was introduced.\n\n\"You will stay here,\" said Sanders, \"and when the river rises you must\nprophesy that it will fall again, else assuredly you will be drowned.\"\n\nWhereupon the people settled down again in their homes and waited for\nthe river to drown the prophet and prove his words. But the river at\nthis season of the year was steadily falling, and the prophet, like many\nanother, was without honour in his own country.\n\nSanders went away; and, although somewhat discouraged, Mr. Torrington\nresumed his experiments. First of all, he took up sleeping sickness, and\nput in three months' futile work, impressing nobody save a gentleman of\nwhom more must be written in a further chapter. Then he dropped that\nstudy suddenly and went to another.\n\nHe had ideas concerning vaccination, but the first baby he vaccinated\ndied of croup, and Torrington came flying down the river telling Sanders\na rambling story of a populace infuriated and demanding his blood. Then\nTorrington went home.\n\n\"The country is now quiet,\" wrote Sanders to the Administrator, with\nsardonic humour. \"There are numerous palavers pending, but none of any\nparticular moment. The Isisi people are unusually quiet, and Bosambo,\nthe Monrovian, of whom I have written your Excellency, makes a model\nchief for the Ochori. No thefts have been traced to him for three\nmonths. I should be grateful if full information could be supplied to me\nconcerning an expedition which at the moment is traversing this country\nunder the style of the Isisi Exploitation Syndicate.\"\n\nCuriously enough, Torrington had forgotten the fact that a member of\nthis expedition had been one of the most interested students of his\nsleeping sickness clinics.\n\nThe Isisi Exploitation Syndicate, Limited, was born between the entre\nand the sweet at the house of a gentleman whose Christian name was\nIsidore, and who lived in Maida Vale. At dinner one night with a dear\nfriend--who called himself McPherson every day of the year except on Yum\nKippur, when he frankly admitted that he had been born Isaacs--the\nquestion of good company titles came up, and Mr. McPherson said he had\nhad the \"Isisi Exploitation\" in his mind for many years. With the aid of\nan atlas the Isisi country was discovered. It was one of those atlases\non which are inscribed the staple products of the lands, and across the\nIsisi was writ fair \"Rubber,\" \"Kola-nut,\" \"Mahogany,\" and \"Tobacco.\"\n\nI would ask the reader to particularly remember \"Tobacco.\"\n\n\"There's a chief I've had some correspondence with,\" said Mr. McPherson,\nchewing his cigar meditatively; \"we could get a sort of concession from\nhim. It would have to be done on the quiet, because the country is a\nBritish Protectorate. Now, if we could get a man who'd put up the stuff,\nand send him out to fix the concession, we'd have a company floated\nbefore you could say knife.\"\n\nJudicious inquiry discovered the man in Claude Hyall Cuthbert, a\nplutocratic young gentleman, who, on the strength of once having nearly\nshot a lion in Uganda, was accepted by a large circle of acquaintances\nas an authority on Africa.\n\nCuthbert, who dabbled in stocks and shares, was an acquisition to any\nsyndicate, and on the understanding that part of his duty would be the\nobtaining of the concession, he gladly financed the syndicate to the\nextent of seven thousand pounds, four thousand of which Messrs. Isidore\nand McPherson very kindly returned to him to cover the cost of his\nexpedition.\n\nThe other three thousand were earmarked for office expenses.\n\nAs Mr. McPherson truly said:\n\n\"Whatever happens, we're on velvet, my boy,\" which was perfectly true.\n\nBefore Cuthbert sailed, McPherson offered him a little advice.\n\n\"Whatever you do,\" he said, \"steer clear of that dam' Commissioner\nSanders. He's one of those pryin', interferin'----\"\n\n\"I know the breed,\" said Cuthbert wisely. \"This is not my first visit to\nAfrica. Did I ever tell you about the lion I shot in Uganda?\"\n\nA week later he sailed.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nIn course of time came a strange white man through Sanders' domain. This\nwhite man, who was Cuthbert, was following the green path to death--but\nthis he did not know. He threw his face to the forest, as the natives\nsay, and laughed, and the people of the village of O'Tembi, standing\nbefore their wattle huts, watched him in silent wonder.\n\nIt was a wide path between huge trees, and the green of the undergrowth\nwas flecked with sunlight, and, indeed, the green path was beautiful to\nthe eye, being not unlike a parkland avenue.\n\nN'Beki, chief of this village of the O'Tembi, a very good old man, went\nout to the path when the white man began his journey.\n\n\"White man,\" he said solemnly, \"this is the road to hell, where all\nmanner of devils live. Night brings remorse, and dawn brings\nself-hatred, which is worse than death.\"\n\nCuthbert, whose Swaheli was faulty, and whose Bomongo talk was nil,\ngrinned impatiently as his coastboy translated unpicturesquely.\n\n\"Dam nigger done say, this be bad place, no good; he say bimeby you libe\nfor die.\"\n\n\"Tell him to go to blazes!\" said Cuthbert noisily; \"and, look here,\nFlagstaff, ask him where the rubber is, see? Tell him we know all about\nthe forest, and ask him about the elephants, where their playground is?\"\n\nCuthbert was broad-shouldered and heavily built, and under his broad\nsun-helmet his face was very hot and moist.\n\n\"Tell the white man,\" said the chief quietly, \"there is no rubber within\nseven days' journey, and that we do not know ivory; elephants there were\n_cala cala_--but not now.\"\n\n\"He's a liar!\" was Cuthbert's only comment. \"Get these beggars moving,\nFlagstaff. Hi, _alapa', avanti, trek_!\"\n\n\"These beggars,\" a straggling line of them, resumed their loads\nuncomplainingly. They were good carriers, as carriers go, and only two\nhad died since the march began.\n\nCuthbert stood and watched them pass, using his stick dispassionately\nupon the laggards. Then he turned to go.\n\n\"Ask him,\" he said finally, \"why he calls this the road to\nwhat-d'ye-call-it?\"\n\nThe old man shook his head.\n\n\"Because of the devils,\" he said simply.\n\n\"Tell him he's a silly ass!\" bellowed Cuthbert and followed his\ncarriers.\n\nThis natural path the caravan took extended in almost a straight line\nthrough the forest. It was a strange path because of its very\nsmoothness, and the only drawback lay in the fact that it seemed to be\nthe breeding-place of flies--little black flies, as big as the house-fly\nof familiar shape, if anything a little bigger.\n\nThey terrified the natives for many reasons, but principally because\nthey stung. They did not terrify Cuthbert, because he was dressed in\ntapai cloth; none the less, there were times when these black flies\nfound joints in his armour and roused him to anger. This path extended\nten miles and made pleasant travelling. Then the explorer struck off\ninto the forest, following another path, well beaten, but more\ndifficult.\n\nBy devious routes Mr. Cuthbert came into the heart of Sanders'\nterritories, and he was successful in this, that he avoided Sanders. He\nhad with him a caravan of sixty men and an interpreter, and in due\ncourse he reached his objective, which was the village of a great chief\nruling a remarkable province--Bosambo, of the Ochori, no less; sometime\nKrooman, steward of the Elder Dempster line, chief on sufferance, but\nnone the less an interesting person. Bosambo, you may be sure, came out\nto greet his visitor.\n\n\"Say to him,\" said Cuthbert to his interpreter, \"that I am proud to meet\nthe great chief.\"\n\n\"Lord chief,\" said the interpreter in the vernacular, \"this white man is\na fool, and has much money.\"\n\n\"So I see,\" said Bosambo.\n\n\"Tell him,\" said Cuthbert, with all the dignity of an ambassador, \"that\nI have come to bring him wonderful presents.\"\n\n\"The white man says,\" said the interpreter, \"that if he is sure you are\na good man he will give you presents. Now,\" said the interpreter\ncarefully, \"as I am the only man who can speak for you, let us make\narrangements. You shall give me one-third of all he offers. Then will I\npersuade him to continue giving, since he is the father of mad people.\"\n\n\"And you,\" said Bosambo briefly, \"are the father of liars.\"\n\nHe made a sign to his guard, and they seized upon the unfortunate\ninterpreter and led him forth. Cuthbert, in a sweat of fear, pulled a\nrevolver.\n\n\"Master,\" said Bosambo loftily, \"you no make um fuss. Dis dam' nigger,\nhe no good; he make you speak bad t'ings. I speak um English proper. You\nsit down, we talk um.\"\n\nSo Cuthbert sat down in the village of Ochori, and for three days there\nwas a great giving of presents, and signing of concessions. Bosambo\nconceded the Ochori country--that was a small thing. He granted forest\nrights of the Isisi, he sold the Akasava, he bartered away the Lulungo\nterritories and the \"native products thereof\"--I quote from the written\ndocument now preserved at the Colonial Office and bearing the scrawled\nsignature of Bosambo--and he added, as a lordly afterthought, the Ikeli\ndistrict.\n\n\"What about river rights?\" asked the delighted Cuthbert.\n\n\"What will you give um?\" demanded Bosambo cautiously.\n\n\"Forty English pounds?\" suggested Cuthbert.\n\n\"I take um,\" said Bosambo.\n\nIt was a remarkably simple business; a more knowledgeable man than\nCuthbert would have been scared by the easiness of his success, but\nCuthbert was too satisfied with himself to be scared at anything.\n\nIt is said that his leave-taking with Bosambo was of an affecting\ncharacter, that Bosambo wept and embraced his benefactor's feet.\n\nBe that as it may, his \"concessions\" in his pocket, Cuthbert began his\ncoastward journey, still avoiding Sanders.\n\nHe came to Etebi and found a deputy-commissioner, who received him with\nopen arms. Here Cuthbert stayed a week.\n\nMr. Torrington at the time was tremendously busy with a scheme for\nstamping out sleeping sickness. Until then, Cuthbert was under the\nimpression that it was a pleasant disease, the principal symptom of\nwhich was a painless coma. Fascinated, he extended his stay to a\nfortnight, seeing many dreadful sights, for Torrington had established a\nsort of amateur clinic, and a hundred cases a day came to him for\ntreatment.\n\n\"And it comes from the bite of a tsetse fly?\" said Cuthbert. \"Show me a\ntsetse.\"\n\nTorrington obliged him, and when the other saw the little black insect\nhe went white to the lips.\n\n\"My God!\" he whispered, \"I've been bitten by that!\"\n\n\"It doesn't follow----\" began Torrington; but Cuthbert was blundering\nand stumbling in wild fear to his carriers' camp.\n\n\"Get your loads!\" he yelled. \"Out of this cursed country we get as quick\nas we can!\"\n\nTorrington, with philosophical calm, endeavoured to reassure him, but he\nwas not to be appeased.\n\nHe left Etebi that night and camped in the forest. Three days later he\nreached a mission station, where he complained of headaches and pains in\nthe neck (he had not attended Torrington's clinics in vain). The\nmissionary, judging from the man's haggard appearance and general\nincoherence that he had an attack of malaria, advised him to rest for a\nfew days; but Cuthbert was all a-fret to reach the coast. Twenty miles\nfrom the mission, Cuthbert sent his carriers back, and said he would\ncover the last hundred miles of the journey alone.\n\nTo this extraordinary proposition the natives agree--from that day\nCuthbert disappeared from the sight of man.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nSanders was taking a short cut through the forest to avoid the\ninterminable twists and bends of the river, when he came suddenly upon a\nvillage of death--four sad little huts, built hastily amidst a tangle of\nunderwood. He called, but nobody answered him. He was too wary to enter\nany of the crazy habitations.\n\nHe knew these little villages in the forest. It was the native custom to\ntake the aged and the dying--especially those who died sleepily--to\nfar-away places, beyond the reach of man, and leave them there with a\nweek's food and a fire, to die in decent solitude.\n\nHe called again, but only the forest answered him. The chattering, noisy\nforest, all a-crackle with the movements of hidden things. Yet there was\na fire burning which told of life.\n\nSanders resumed his journey, first causing a quantity of food to be laid\nin a conspicuous place for the man who made the fire.\n\nHe was on his way to take evidence concerning the disappearance of\nCuthbert. It was the fourth journey of its kind he had attempted. There\nhad been palavers innumerable.\n\nBosambo, chief of the Ochori, had sorrowfully disgorged the presents he\nhad received, and admitted his fault.\n\n\"Lord!\" he confessed, \"when I was with the white man on the coast I\nlearnt the trick of writing--it is a cursed gift--else all this trouble\nwould not have come about. For, desiring to show my people how great a\nman I was, I wrote a letter in the English fashion, and sent it by\nmessenger to the coast and thence to friends in Sierra Leone, telling\nthem of my fortune. Thus the people in London came to know of the\ntreasure of this land.\"\n\nSanders, in a few illuminative sentences, conveyed his impression of\nBosambo's genius.\n\n\"You slave and son of a slave,\" he said, \"whom I took from a prison to\nrule the Ochori, why did you deceive this white man, selling him lands\nthat were not yours?\"\n\n\"Lord!\" said Bosambo simply, \"there was nothing else I could sell.\"\n\nBut there was no clue here as to Cuthbert's whereabouts, nor at the\nmission station, nor amongst the carriers detained on suspicion. One man\nmight have thrown light upon the situation, but Torrington was at home\nfulfilling the post of assistant examiner in mechanics at South\nKensington (more in his element there) and filling in his spare time\nwith lecturing on \"The Migration of the Bantu Races.\"\n\nSo that the end of Sanders' fourth quest was no more successful than the\nthird, or the second, or the first, and he retraced his steps to\nheadquarters, feeling somewhat depressed.\n\nHe took the path he had previously traversed, and came upon the Death\nCamp late in the afternoon. The fire still burnt, but the food he had\nplaced had disappeared. He hailed the hut in the native tongue, but no\none answered him. He waited for a little while, and then gave orders for\nmore food to be placed on the ground.\n\n\"Poor devil!\" said Sanders, and gave the order to march. He himself had\ntaken half a dozen steps, when he stopped. At his feet something\nglittered in the fading light. He stooped and picked it up. It was an\nexploded cartridge. He examined it carefully, smelt it--it had been\nrecently fired. Then he found another. They were Lee-Metford, and bore\nthe mark \"'07,\" which meant that they were less than a year old.\n\nHe was still standing with the little brass cylinders in his hand, when\nAbiboo came to him.\n\n\"Master,\" said the Houssa, \"who ties monkeys to trees with ropes?\"\n\n\"Is that a riddle?\" asked Sanders testily, for his mind was busy on this\nmatter of cartridges.\n\nAbiboo for answer beckoned him.\n\nFifty yards from the hut was a tree, at the foot of which, whimpering\nand chattering and in a condition of abject terror, were two small black\nmonkeys tethered by ropes.\n\nThey spat and grinned ferociously as Sanders approached them. He looked\nfrom the cartridges to the monkeys and back to the cartridges again,\nthen he began searching the grass. He found two more empty shells and a\nrusting lancet, such as may be found in the pocket-case of any explorer.\n\n\nThen he walked back to the hut before which the fire burnt, and called\nsoftly--\n\n\"Mr. Cuthbert!\"\n\nThere was no answer, and Sanders called again--\n\n\"Mr. Cuthbert!\"\n\nFrom the interior of the hut came a groan.\n\n\"Leave me alone. I have come here to die!\" said a muffled voice.\n\n\"Come out and be civil,\" said Sanders coolly; \"you can die afterwards.\"\n\nAfter a few moments' delay there issued from the door of the hut the\nwreck of a man, with long hair and a month-old beard, who stood sulkily\nbefore the Commissioner.\n\n\"Might I ask,\" said Sanders, \"what your little game is?\"\n\nThe other shook his head wearily. He was a pitiable sight. His clothes\nwere in tatters; he was unwashed and grimy.\n\n\"Sleeping sickness,\" he said wearily. \"Felt it coming on--seen what\nhorrible thing it was--didn't want to be a burden. Oh, my God! What a\nfool I've been to come to this filthy country!\"\n\n\"That's very likely,\" said Sanders. \"But who told you that you had\nsleeping sickness?\"\n\n\"Know it--know it,\" said the listless man.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Sanders. The other obeyed, and Sanders applied the\nsuperficial tests.\n\n\"If you've got sleeping sickness,\" said Sanders, after the examination,\n\"I'm suffering from religious mania--man, you're crazy!\"\n\nYet there was something in Cuthbert's expression that was puzzling. He\nwas dull, heavy, and stupid. His movements were slow and lethargic.\n\nSanders watched him as he pulled a black wooden pipe from his ragged\npocket, and with painful slowness charged it from a skin pouch.\n\n\"It's got me, I tell you,\" muttered Cuthbert, and lit the pipe with a\nblazing twig from the fire. \"I knew it (puff) as soon as that fellow\nTorrington (puff) described the symptoms (puff);--felt dull and\nsleepy--got a couple of monkeys and injected my blood (puff)--_they_\nwent drowsy, too--sure sign----\"\n\n\"Where did you get that tobacco from?\" demanded Sanders quickly.\n\nCuthbert took time to consider his answer.\n\n\"Fellow gave it me--chief fellow, Bosambo. Native tobacco, but not\nbad--he gave me a devil of a lot.\"\n\n\"So I should say,\" said Sanders, and reaching over took the pouch and\nput it in his pocket.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nWhen Sanders had seen Mr. Cuthbert safe on board a homeward-bound\nsteamer, he took his twenty Houssas to the Ochori country to arrest\nBosambo, and expected Bosambo would fly; but the imperturbable chief\nawaited his coming, and offered him the customary honours.\n\n\"I admit I gave the white man the hemp,\" he said. \"I myself smoke it,\nsuffering no ill. How was I to know that it would make him sleep?\"\n\n\"Why did you give it to him?\" demanded Sanders.\n\nBosambo looked the Commissioner full in the face.\n\n\"Last moon you came, lord, asking why I gave him the Isisi country and\nthe rights of the little river, because these were not mine to give. Now\nyou come to me saying why did I give the white man native tobacco--Lord,\nthat was the only thing I gave him that was mine.\"\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER V.\n\n  THE SPECIAL COMMISSIONER.\n\n\nThe Hon. George Tackle had the good fortune to be the son of his father;\notherwise I am free to confess he had no claim to distinction. But his\nfather, being the proprietor of the _Courier and Echo_ (with which are\nincorporated I don't know how many dead and gone stars of the Fleet\nStreet firmament), George had a \"pull\" which no amount of competitive\nmerit could hope to contend with, and when the stories of atrocities in\nthe district of Lukati began to leak out and questions were asked in\nParliament, George opened his expensively-bound Gazetteer, discovered\nthat the district of Lukati was in British territory, and instantly\ndemanded that he should be sent out to investigate these crimes, which\nwere a blot upon our boasted civilisation.\n\nHis father agreed, having altogether a false appreciation of his son's\ngenius, and suggested that George should go to the office and \"get all\nthe facts\" regarding the atrocities. George, with a good-natured smile\nof amusement at the bare thought of anybody instructing him in a subject\non which he was so thoroughly conversant, promised; but the _Courier and\nEcho_ office did not see him, and the librarian of the newspaper, who\nhad prepared a really valuable dossier of newspaper cuttings, pamphlets,\nmaps, and health hints for the young man's guidance, was dismayed to\nlearn that the confident youth had sailed without any further\ninstruction in the question than a man might secure from the hurried\nperusal of the scraps which from day to day appeared in the morning\npress.\n\nAs a special correspondent, I adduce, with ill-suppressed triumph, the\ncase of the Hon. George Tackle as an awful warning to all newspaper\nproprietors who allow their parental affections to overcome their good\njudgment.\n\nAll that the Hon. George knew was that at Lukati there had been four\nwell-authenticated cases of barbarous acts of cruelty against natives,\nand that the Commissioner of the district was responsible for the\nwhippings and the torture. He thought, did the Hon. George, that this\nwas all that it was necessary to know. But this is where he made his big\nmistake.\n\nUp at Lukati all sorts of things happened, as Commissioner Sanders\nknows, to his cost. Once he visited the district and left it tranquil,\nand for Carter, his deputy, whom he left behind, the natives built a\nmost beautiful hut, planting gardens about, all off their own bat.\n\nOne day, when Carter had just finished writing an enthusiastic report on\nthe industry of his people, and the whole-hearted way they were taking\nup and supporting the new rgime, the chief of the village, whom Carter\nhad facetiously named O'Leary (his born name was indeed Olari), came to\nhim.\n\nCarter at the moment was walking through the well-swept street of the\nvillage with his hands in his coat pockets and his big white helmet\ntipped on the back of his head because the sun was setting at his back.\n\n\"Father,\" said the Chief Olari, \"I have brought these people to see\nyou.\"\n\nHe indicated with a wave of his hand six strange warriors carrying their\nshields and spears, who looked at him dispassionately.\n\nCarter nodded.\n\n\"They desire,\" said Olari, \"to see the wonderful little black fetish\nthat my father carries in his pocket that they may tell their people of\nits powers.\"\n\n\"Tell your people,\" said Carter good-humouredly, \"that I have not got\nthe fetish with me--if they will come to my hut I will show them its\nwonders.\"\n\nWhereupon Olari lifted his spear and struck at Carter, and the six\nwarriors sprang forward together. Carter fought gamely, but he was\nunarmed.\n\nWhen Sanders heard the news of his subordinate's death he did not faint\nor fall into a fit of insane cursing. He was sitting on his broad\nverandah at headquarters when the dusty messenger came. He rose with\npursed lips and frowning eyes, fingering the letter--this came from\nTollemache, inspector of police at Bokari--and paced the verandah.\n\n\"Poor chap, poor chap!\" was all that he said.\n\nHe sent no message to Olari; he made no preparations for a punitive\nraid; he went on signing documents, inspecting Houssas, attending dinner\nparties, as though Carter had never lived or died. All these things the\nspies of Olari reported, and the chief was thankful.\n\nLukati being two hundred miles from headquarters, through a savage and\nmountainous country, an expedition was no light undertaking, and the\nBritish Government, rich as it is, cannot afford to spend a hundred\nthousand pounds to avenge the death of a subordinate official. Of this\nfact Sanders was well aware, so he employed his time in collecting and\nauthenticating the names of Carter's assassins. When he had completed\nthem he went a journey seventy miles into the bush to the great\nwitch-doctor Kelebi, whose name was known throughout the coast country\nfrom Dakka to the Eastern borders of Togoland.\n\n\"Here are the names of men who have put shame upon me,\" he said; \"but\nprincipally Olari, chief of the Lukati people.\"\n\n\"I will put a spell upon Olari,\" said the witch-doctor; \"a very bad\nspell, and upon these men. The charge will be six English pounds.\"\n\nSanders paid the money, and \"dashed\" two bottles of square-face and a\npiece of proper cloth. Then he went back to headquarters.\n\nOne night through the village of Lukati ran a whisper, and the men\nmuttered the news with fearful shivers and backward glances.\n\n\"Olari, the chief, is cursed!\"\n\nOlari heard the tidings from his women, and came out of his hut into the\nmoonlight, raving horribly.\n\nThe next day he sickened, and on the fifth day he was near to dead and\nsuffering terrible pains, as also were six men who helped in the slaying\nof Carter. That they did not die was no fault of the witch-doctor, who\nexcused his failure on account of the great distance between himself and\nhis subjects.\n\nAs for Sanders, he was satisfied, saying that even the pains were cheap\nat the price, and that it would give him great satisfaction to write\n\"finis\" to Olari with his own hand.\n\nA week after this, Abiboo, Sanders' favourite servant, was taken ill.\nThere was no evidence of fever or disease, only the man began to fade\nas it were.\n\nMaking inquiries, Sanders discovered that Abiboo had offended the\nwitch-doctor Kelebi, and that the doctor had sent him the death message.\n\nSanders took fifty Houssas into the bush and interviewed the\nwitch-doctor.\n\n\"I have reason,\" he said, \"for believing you to be a failure as a slayer\nof men.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said Kelebi in extenuation, \"my magic cannot cross mountains,\notherwise Olari and his friends would have died.\"\n\n\"That is as it may be,\" said Sanders. \"I am now concerned with magic\nnearer at hand, and I must tell you that the day after Abiboo dies I\nwill hang you.\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Kelebi emphatically, \"under those circumstances Abiboo\nshall live.\"\n\nSanders gave him a sovereign, and rode back to headquarters, to find his\nservant on the high road to recovery.\n\nI give you this fragment of Sanders' history, because it will enable you\nto grasp the peculiar environment in which Sanders spent the greater\npart of his life, and because you will appreciate all the better the\nirony of the situation created by the coming of the Hon. George Tackle.\n\nSanders was taking breakfast on the verandah of his house. From where he\nsat he commanded across the flaming beauties of his garden a view of a\nbroad, rolling, oily sea, a golden blaze of light under the hot sun.\nThere was a steamer lying three miles out (only in five fathoms of\nwater at that), and Sanders, through his glasses, recognised her as the\nElder Dempster boat that brought the monthly mail. Since there were no\nletters on his table, and the boat had been \"in\" for two hours, he\ngathered that there was no mail for him, and was thankful, for he had\noutlived the sentimental period of life when letters were pleasant\npossibilities.\n\nHaving no letters, he expected no callers, and the spectacle of the Hon.\nGeorge being carried in a hammock into his garden was astonishing.\n\nThe Hon. George carefully alighted, adjusted his white pith helmet,\nsmoothed the creases from his immaculate ducks, and mounted the steps\nthat led to the stoep.\n\n\"How do?\" said the visitor. \"My name is Tackle--George Tackle.\" He\nsmiled, as though to say more was an insult to his hearer's\nintelligence.\n\nSanders bowed, a little ceremoniously for him. He felt that his visitor\nexpected this.\n\n\"I'm out on a commission,\" the Hon. George went on. \"As you've doubtless\nheard, my governor is the proprietor of the _Courier and Echo_, and so\nhe thought I'd better go out and see the thing for myself. I've no doubt\nthe whole thing is exaggerated----\"\n\n\"Hold hard,\" said Sanders, a light dawning on him. \"I gather that you\nare a sort of correspondent of a newspaper?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"That you have come to inquire into----\"\n\n\"Treatment of natives, and all that,\" said the Hon. George easily.\n\n\"And what is wrong with the treatment of the native?\" asked Sanders\nsweetly.\n\nThe hon. gentleman made an indefinite gesture.\n\n\"You know--things in newspapers--missionaries,\" he said rapidly, being\nsomewhat embarrassed by the realisation that the man, if any,\nresponsible for the outrages was standing before him.\n\n\"I never read the newspapers,\" said Sanders, \"and----\"\n\n\"Of course,\" interrupted the Hon. George eagerly, \"we can make it all\nright as far as you are concerned.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you!\" Sanders' gratitude was a little overdone, but he held\nout his hand. \"Well, I wish you luck--let me know how you get on.\"\n\nThe Hon. George Tackle was frankly nonplussed.\n\n\"But excuse me,\" he said, \"where--how----Hang it all, where am I to put\nup?\"\n\n\"Here?\"\n\n\"Yes -- dash it, my kit is on shore! I thought----\"\n\n\"You thought I'd put you up?\"\n\n\"Well, I did think----\"\n\n\"That I'd fall on your neck and welcome you?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, but----\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Sanders, carefully folding his napkin, \"I'm not so glad to\nsee you as all that.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said the Hon. George, bridling.\n\n\"Because you're a responsibility--I hate extra responsibility. You can\npitch your tent just wherever you like--but I cannot offer you the\nhospitality you desire.\"\n\n\"I shall report this matter to the Administrator,\" said the Hon. George\nominously.\n\n\"You may report it to my grandmother's maiden aunt,\" said Sanders\npolitely.\n\nHalf an hour later he saw the Hon. George rejoin the ship that brought\nhim to Isisi Bassam, and chuckled. George would go straight to the\nAdministrator, and would receive a reception beside which a Sahara storm\nwould be zephyrs of Araby.\n\nAt the same time Sanders was a little puzzled, and not a little hurt.\nThere never had been a question of atrocities in his district, and he\nwas puzzled to account for the rumours that had brought the\n\"commissioner\" on his tour of investigation--could it be a distorted\naccount of Olari's punishment?\n\n\"Go quickly to the ship, taking a book to the lord who has just gone\nfrom here,\" was his command to a servant, and proceeded to scribble a\nnote:--\n\n    \"I am afraid,\" he wrote, \"I was rather rude to you--not\n    understanding what the devil you were driving at. An\n    overwhelming curiosity directs me to invite you to share my\n    bungalow until such time as you are ready to conduct your\n    investigation.\"\n\nThe Hon. George read this with a self-satisfied smirk.\n\n\"The way to treat these fellows,\" he said to the Elder Dempster captain,\n\"is to show 'em you'll stand no nonsense. I thought he'd climb down.\"\n\nThe Elder Dempster captain, who knew Sanders by repute, smiled\ndiscreetly, but said nothing. Once more the special correspondent's\nmountain of baggage was embarked in the surf boat, and the Hon. George\nwaved a farewell to his friends on the steamer.\n\nThe Elder Dempster skipper, leaning over the side of his bridge, watched\nthe surf boat rising and falling in the swell.\n\n\"There goes a man who's looking for trouble,\" he said, \"and I wouldn't\ntake a half-share of the trouble he's going to find for five hundred of\nthe best. Is that blessed anchor up yet, Mr. Simmons? Half ahead--set\nher due west, Mr. What's-your-name.\"\n\nIt was something of a triumph for the Hon. George. There were ten\nuniformed policemen awaiting him on the smooth beach to handle his\nbaggage, and Sanders came down to his garden gate to meet him.\n\n\"The fact of it is----\" began Sanders awkwardly; but the magnanimous\nGeorge raised his hand.\n\n\"Let bygones,\" he said, \"be bygones.\"\n\nSanders was unaccountably annoyed by this generous display. Still more\nso was he when the correspondent refused to reopen the question of\natrocities.\n\n\"As your guest,\" said George solemnly, \"I feel that it would be better\nfor all concerned if I pursued an independent investigation. I shall\nendeavour as far as possible, to put myself in your place, to consider\nall extenuating circumstances----\"\n\n\"Oh, have a gin-swizzle!\" said Sanders rudely and impatiently; \"you make\nme tired.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" he said later, \"I will only ask you two questions. Where\nare these atrocities supposed to have taken place?\"\n\n\"In the district of Lukati,\" said the Hon. George.\n\n\"Olari,\" thought Sanders. \"Who was the victim?\" he asked.\n\n\"There were several,\" said the correspondent, and produced his\nnote-book. \"You understand that I'd really much rather not discuss the\nmatter with you, but, since you insist,\" he read, \"Efembi of Wastambo.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Sanders, and his eyebrows rose\n\n\"Kabindo of Machembi.\"\n\n\"Oh, lord!\" said Sanders.\n\nThe Hon. George read six other cases, and with every one a line was\nwiped from Sanders' forehead.\n\nWhen the recital was finished the Commissioner said slowly--\n\n\"I can make a statement to you which will save you a great deal of\nunnecessary trouble.\"\n\n\"I would rather you didn't,\" said George, in his best judicial manner.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Sanders; and went away whistling to order dinner.\n\nOver the meal he put it to the correspondent:\n\n\"There are a number of people on this station who are friends of mine. I\nwon't disguise the fact from you--there is O'Neill, in charge of the\nHoussas; the doctor, Kennedy, the chap in charge of the survey party;\nand half a dozen more. Would you like to question them?\"\n\n\"They are friends of yours?\"\n\n\"Yes, personal friends.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the Hon. George, gravely, \"perhaps it would be better if I\ndid not see them.\"\n\n\"As you wish,\" said Sanders.\n\nWith an escort of four Houssas, and fifty carriers recruited from the\nneighbouring villages, the Hon. George departed into the interior, and\nSanders saw him off.\n\n\"I cannot, of course, guarantee your life,\" he said, at parting, \"and I\nmust warn you that the Government will not be responsible for any injury\nthat comes to you.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said the Hon. George knowingly, \"but I am not to be\ndeterred. I come from a stock----\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" Sanders cut his genealogical reminiscences short; \"but the\nlast traveller who was 'chopped' in the bush was a D'Arcy, and his\npeople came over with the Conqueror.\"\n\nThe correspondent took the straight path to Lukati, and at the end of\nthe third day's march came to the village of Mfabo, where lived the\ngreat witch-doctor, Kelebi.\n\nGeorge pitched his camp outside the village, and, accompanied by his\nfour Houssas, paid a call upon the chief, which was one of the first\nmistakes he made, for he should have sent for the chief to call upon\nhim; and if he called upon anybody, he should have made his visit to the\nwitch-doctor, who was a greater man than forty chiefs.\n\nIn course of time, however, he found himself squatting on the ground\noutside the doctor's house, engaged, through the medium of the\ninterpreter he had brought from Sierra Leone, in an animated\nconversation with the celebrated person.\n\n\"Tell him,\" said George to his interpreter, \"that I am a great white\nchief whose heart bleeds for the native.\"\n\n\"Is he a good man?\" asked George.\n\nThe witch-doctor, with the recollection of Sanders' threat, said \"No!\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the Hon. George eagerly. \"Does he beat the people?\"\n\nNot only did he beat the people, explained the witch-doctor with relish,\nbut there were times when he burnt them alive.\n\n\"This is a serious charge,\" said George, wagging his head warningly;\nnevertheless he wrote with rapidity in his diary:--\n\n    \"Interviewed Kelebi, respected native doctor, who states:\n\n    \"'I have lived all my life in this district, and have never\n    known so cruel a man as Sandi (Sanders). I remember once he\n    caused a man to be drowned, the man's name I forget; on another\n    occasion he burned a worthy native alive for refusing to guide\n    him and his Houssas through the forest. I also remember the time\n    when he put a village to the fire, causing the people great\n    suffering.\n\n    \"'The people of the country groan under his oppressions, for\n    from time to time he comes demanding money and crops, and if he\n    does not receive all that he asks for he flogs the villagers\n    until they cry aloud.'\"\n\n(I rather suspect that there is truth in the latter statement, for\nSanders finds no little difficulty in collecting the hut-tax, which is\nthe Government's due.)\n\nGeorge shook his head when he finished writing.\n\n\"This,\" he said, \"looks very bad.\"\n\nHe shook hands with the witch-doctor, and that aged villain looked\nsurprised, and asked a question in the native tongue.\n\n\"You no be fit to dash him somet'ing,\" said the interpreter.\n\n\"Dash him?\"\n\n\"Give 'um present--bottle gin.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said George. \"He may be satisfied with the knowledge\nthat he is rendering a service to humanity; that he is helping the cause\nof a down-trodden people.\"\n\nThe witch-doctor said something in reply, which the interpreter very\nwisely refrained from putting into English.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n\"How go the investigations?\" asked the captain of Houssas three weeks\nlater.\n\n\"As far as I can gather,\" said Sanders, \"our friend is collecting a\ndeath-roll by the side of which the records of the Great Plague will\nread like an advertisement of a health resort.\"\n\n\"Where is he now?\"\n\n\"He has got to Lukati--and I am worried\"; and Sanders looked it.\n\nThe Houssa captain nodded, for all manner of reports had come down from\nLukati country. There had been good crops, and good crops mean idleness,\nand idleness means mischief. Also there had been devil dances, and the\nmild people of the Bokari district, which lies contiguous to Lukati, had\nlost women.\n\n\"I've got a free hand to nip rebellion in the bud,\" Sanders reflected\nmoodily; \"and the chances point to rebellion----What do you say? Shall\nwe make a report and wait for reinforcements, or shall we chance our\nluck?\"\n\n\"It's your funeral,\" said the Houssa captain, \"and I hate to advise you.\nIf things go wrong you'll get the kicks; but if it were mine I'd go,\nlike a shot--naturally.\"\n\n\"A hundred and forty men,\" mused Sanders.\n\n\"And two Maxims,\" suggested the other.\n\n\"We'll go,\" said Sanders; and half an hour later a bugle blared through\nthe Houssas' lines, and Sanders was writing a report to his chief in\nfar-away Lagos.\n\nThe Hon. George, it may be said, had no idea that he was anything but\nwelcome in the village of Lukati.\n\nOlari the chief had greeted him pleasantly, and told him stories of\nSanders' brutality--stories which, as George wrote, \"if true, must of\nnecessity sound the death-knell of British integrity in our native\npossessions.\"\n\nExactly what that meant, I am not disposed to guess.\n\nGeorge stayed a month as the guest of Lukati. He had intended to stay at\nthe most three days, but there was always a reason for postponing his\ndeparture.\n\nOnce the carriers deserted, once the roads were not safe, once Olari\nasked him to remain that he might see his young men dance. George did\nnot know that his escort of four Houssas were feeling uneasy, because\nhis interpreter--as big a fool as himself--could not interpret omens.\nGeorge knew nothing of the significance of a dance in which no less than\nsix witch-doctors took part, or the history of the tumble-down hut that\nstood in solitude at one end of the village. Had he taken the trouble to\nsearch that hut, he would have found a table, a chair, and a truckle\nbed, and on the table a report, soiled with dust and rain, which began:\n\n\"I have the honour to inform your Excellency that the natives maintain\ntheir industrious and peaceable attitude.\"\n\nFor in this hut in his lifetime lived Carter, Deputy Commissioner; and\nthe natives, with their superstitious regard for the dead, had moved\nnothing.\n\nIt was approaching the end of the month, when the Hon. George thought he\ndetected in his host a certain scarcely-veiled insolence of tone, and in\nthe behaviour of the villagers something more threatening.\n\nThe dances were a nightly occurrence now, and the measured stamping of\nfeet, the clash of spear against cane shield, and the never-ending growl\nof the song the dancers sang, kept him awake at nights. Messengers came\nto Olari daily from long distances, and once he was awakened in the\nmiddle of the night by screams. He jumped out of bed and pushed aside\nthe fly of his tent to see half a dozen naked women dragged through the\nstreets--the result of a raid upon the unoffending Bokari. He dressed,\nin a sweat of indignation and fear, and went to the chief's hut,\nfortunately without his interpreter, for what Olari said would have\nparalysed him.\n\nIn the morning (after this entirely unsatisfactory interview) he paraded\nhis four Houssas and such of his carriers as he could find, and prepared\nto depart.\n\n\"Master,\" said Olari, when the request was interpreted, \"I would rather\nyou stayed. The land is full of bad people, and I have still much to\ntell you of the devilishness of Sandi. Moreover,\" said the chief,\n\"to-night there is to be a great dance in your honour,\" and he pointed\nto where three slaves were engaged in erecting a big post in the centre\nof the village street.\n\n\"After this I will let you go,\" said Olari, \"for you are my father and\nmy mother.\"\n\nThe Hon. George was hesitating, when, of a sudden, at each end of the\nstreet there appeared, as if by magic, twenty travel-stained Houssas.\nThey stood at attention for a moment, then opened outwards, and in the\ncentre of each party gleamed the fat water-jacket of a Maxim gun.\n\nThe chief said nothing, only he looked first one way and then the other,\nand his brown face went a dirty grey. Sanders strolled leisurely along\ntoward the group. He was unshaven, his clothes were torn with\nbush-thorn, in his hand was a long-barrelled revolver.\n\n\"Olari,\" he said gently; and the chief stepped forward.\n\n\"I think, Olari,\" said Sanders, \"you have been chief too long.\"\n\n\"Master, my father was chief before me, and his father,\" said Olari, his\nface twitching.\n\n\"What of Tagondo, my friend?\" asked Sanders, speaking of Carter by his\nnative name.\n\n\"Master, he died,\" said Olari; \"he died of the sickness _mongo_--the\nsickness itself.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" said Sanders, nodding his head, \"surely you also shall die of\nthe same sickness.\"\n\nOlari looked round for a way of escape.\n\nHe saw the Hon. George looking from one to the other in perplexity, and\nhe flung himself at the correspondent's feet.\n\n\"Master!\" he cried, \"save me from this man who hates me!\"\n\nGeorge understood the gesture; his interpreter told him the rest; and,\nas a Houssa servant reached out his hand to the chief, the son of the\nhouse of Widnes, strong in the sense of his righteousness, struck it\nback.\n\n\"Look here, Sanders,\" forgetting all his previous misgivings and fears\nconcerning the chief, \"I should say that you have punished this poor\ndevil enough!\"\n\n\"Take that man, sergeant,\" said Sanders sharply; and the Houssa gripped\nOlari by the shoulder and flung him backward.\n\n\"You shall answer for this!\" roared the Hon. George Tackle, in impotent\nwrath. \"What are you going to do with him? My God! No, no!--not without\na trial!\"\n\nHe sprang forward, but the Houssas caught him and restrained him.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n\"For what you have done,\" said the correspondent--this was a month\nafter, and he was going aboard the homeward steamer--\"you shall suffer!\"\n\n\"I only wish to point out to you,\" said Sanders, \"that if I had not\narrived in the nick of time, you would have done all the suffering--they\nwere going to sacrifice you on the night I arrived. Didn't you see the\npost?\"\n\n\"That is a lie!\" said the other. \"I will make England ring with your\ninfamy. The condition of your district is a blot on civilisation!\"\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n\"There is no doubt,\" said Mr. Justice Keneally, summing up in the libel\naction, Sanders v. _The Courier and Echo_ and another, \"that the\ndefendant Tackle did write a number of very libellous and damaging\nstatements, and, to my mind, the most appalling aspect of the case is\nthat, commissioned as he was to investigate the condition of affairs in\nthe district of Lukati, he did not even trouble to find out where Lukati\nwas. As you have been told, gentlemen of the jury, there are no less\nthan four Lukatis in West Africa, the one in Togoland being the\ndistrict in which it was intended the defendant should go. How he came\nto mistake Lukati of British West Africa for the Lukati of German\nTogoland, I do not know, but in order to bolster up his charges against\na perfectly-innocent British official he brought forward a number of\nunsupported statements, each of which must be regarded as damaging to\nthe plaintiff, but more damaging still to the newspaper that in its\ncolossal ignorance published them.\"\n\nThe jury awarded Sanders nine thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds.\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER VI.\n\n  THE DANCING STONES.\n\n\nHeroes should be tall and handsome, with flashing eyes; Sanders was not\nso tall, was yellow of face, moreover had grey hair. Heroes should also\nbe of gentle address, full of soft phrases, for such tender women who\ncome over their horizon; Sanders was a dispassionate man who swore on\nthe slightest provocation, and had no use for women any way.\n\nWhen you place a man upon a throne, even though that throne be a wooden\nstool worth in the mart fourpence more or less, you assume a\nresponsibility which greatly outweighs all the satisfaction or personal\ngratification you may derive from your achievement. There is a grave in\nToledo, a slab of brass, over a great king-maker who lived long enough\nto realise his insignificance. The epitaph upon that brass tomb of his\nis eloquent of his sum knowledge of life and human effort.\n\n  PULVIS\n   ET\n  NIHIL\n\nsays the inscription, and Powder and Nothing is the ultimate destiny of\nall king-makers.\n\nSanders was a maker of kings in the early days. He helped break a few,\nso it was in obedience to the laws of compensation that he took his part\nin reconstructive work.\n\nHe broke Esindini, Matabini, T'saki--to name three--and helped, in the\nvery old days, and in another country, to break Lobengula, the Great\nBull.\n\nKing-maker he was beyond question--you could see Republicanism written\nlegibly in the amused grin with which he made them--but the kings he\nmade were little ones--that is the custom of the British-African rule,\nthey break a big king and put many little kings in his place, because it\nis much safer.\n\nSomewhere about 12 north, and in longitude 0, is a land which is\npeculiar for the fact that it is British, French, German, and\nItalian--according to which map of Africa you judge it by.\n\nAt the time of which I write it was neither, but it was ruled by\nMensikilimbili for the Great King. He was the most powerful of monarchs,\nand, for the matter of that, the most cruel. His dominion stretched\n\"from moonrise to sunset,\" said the natives, and he held undisputed\nsway.\n\nHe had a court, and sat upon an ivory throne, and wore over the leopard\nskins of his rank a mantle woven of gold thread and scarlet thread, and\nhe administered justice. He had three hundred wives and forty thousand\nfighting men, and his acquaintance with white men began and ended with\nthe coming of a French Mission, who presented him with a tall hat, a\nbarrel organ, and one hundred thousand francs in gold.\n\nThis was Limbili, the great King of Yitingi.\n\nThe little kings of the Southern lands spoke of him with bated breath;\nhis name was uttered in a low voice, as of a god; he was the symbol of\nmajesty and of might--the Isisi people, themselves a nation of some\nimportance, and boastful likewise, referred to themselves disparagingly\nwhen the kingdom of Yitingi was mentioned.\n\nFollowing the French Mission, Sanders went up as envoy to the Limbilu,\ncarrying presents of a kind and messages of good will.\n\nHe was escorted into the territory by a great army and was lodged in the\ncity of the king. After two days' waiting he was informed that his\nMajesty would see him, and was led to the Presence.\n\nThe Presence was an old man, a vicious old man, if Sanders was any judge\nof character, who showed unmistakable signs of anger and contempt when\nthe Commissioner displayed his presents.\n\n\"And what are these, white man?\" said the king. \"Toys for my women, or\npresents for my little chiefs?\"\n\n\"These are for your Greatness,\" said Sanders quietly, \"from a people who\ndo not gauge friendship by the costliness of presents.\"\n\nThe king gave a little sniff.\n\n\"Tell me, white man,\" he said; \"in your travels have you ever seen so\ngreat a king as I?\"\n\n\"Lord king,\" said Sanders, frank to a fault. \"I have seen greater.\"\n\nThe king frowned, and the crowd about his sacred person muttered\nmenacingly.\n\n\"There you lie,\" said the king calmly; \"for there never was a greater\nking than I.\"\n\n\"Let the white man say who is greater,\" croaked an aged councillor, and\na murmur of approval arose.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Sanders, looking into the eyes of the old man who sat on\nthe throne, \"I have seen Lo Ben.\"[2]\n\nThe king frowned again, and nodded.\n\n\"Of him I have heard,\" he said; \"he was a great king and an eater-up of\nnations--who else?\"\n\n\"King,\" lied Sanders, \"also Ketcewayo\"; and something like a hush fell\nupon the court, for the name of Ketcewayo was one that travelled north.\n\n\"But of white kings,\" persisted the chief; \"is there a white king in the\nworld whose word when it goes forth causes men to tremble?\"\n\nSanders grinned internally, knowing such a king, but answered that in\nall his life he had never met such a king.\n\n\"And of armies,\" said the king, \"have you ever seen an army such as\nmine?\"\n\nAnd so through the category of his possessions he ran; and Sanders,\nfinding that the lie was to save himself a great deal of trouble, lied\nand acclaimed King Limbili as the greatest king in all the world,\ncommander of the most perfect army, ruler of a sublime kingdom.\n\nIt may be said that the kingdom of Yitingi owed its integrity to its\nfaults, for, satisfied with the perfection of all his possessions, the\ngreat king confined his injustices, his cruelties, and his little wars\nwithin the boundaries of his state. Also he sought relaxation therein.\n\nOne day, just after the rains, when the world was cool and the air\nfilled with the faint scent of African spring, Sanders made a tour\nthrough the little provinces. These are those lands which lie away from\nthe big rivers. Countries curled up in odd corners, bisected sharply on\nthe map by this or that international boundary line, or scattered on the\nfringe of the wild country vaguely inscribed by the chartographer as\n\"Under British Influence.\"\n\nIt was always an interesting journey--Sanders made it once a year--for\nthe way led up strange rivers and through unfamiliar scenes, past\nvillages where other white men than Sanders were never seen. After a\nmonth's travel the Commissioner came to Icheli, which lies on the border\nof the great king's domain, and with immense civility he was received by\nthe elders and the chiefs.\n\n\"Lord, you have come at a good moment,\" said the chief solemnly,\n\"to-night Daihili dances.\"\n\n\"And who is Daihili?\" asked Sanders.\n\nThey told him; later they brought for his inspection a self-conscious\ngirl, a trifle pert, he thought, for a native.\n\nA slim girl, taller than the average woman, with a figure perfectly\nmodelled, a face not unpleasant even from the European standpoint,\ngraceful in carriage, her every movement harmonious. Sanders, chewing\nthe end of his cigar, took her in at one glance.\n\n\"My girl, they tell me that you dance,\" he said.\n\n\"That is so, master,\" she said; \"I am the greatest dancer in all the\nworld.\"\n\n\"So far I cannot go,\" said the cautious Commissioner; \"but I do not\ndoubt that your dancing is very wonderful.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" she said, with a gesture, \"when I dance men go mad, losing their\nsenses. To-night when the moon is high I will show you the dance of the\nThree Lovers.\"\n\n\"To-night,\" said Sanders briefly, \"I shall be in bed--and, I trust,\nasleep.\"\n\nThe girl frowned a little, was possibly piqued, being a woman of\nfifteen, and in no wise different to women elsewhere in the world. This\nSanders did not know, and I doubt whether the knowledge would have\nhelped him much if he did.\n\nHe heard the tom-tom beating, that night as he lay in bed, and the\nrhythmical clapping of hands, and fell asleep wondering what would be\nthe end of a girl who danced so that men went mad.\n\nThe child was the chief's daughter, and at parting Sanders had a few\nwords to say concerning her.\n\n\"This daughter of yours is fifteen, and it would be better if she were\nmarried,\" he said.\n\n\"Lord, she has many lovers, but none rich enough to buy her,\" said the\nproud father, \"because she is so great a dancer. Chiefs and headmen from\nvillages far distant come to see her.\" He looked round and lowered his\nvoice. \"It is said,\" he whispered, \"that the Great One himself has\nspoken of her. Perhaps he will send for her, offering this and that. In\nsuch a case,\" said the chief hopefully, \"I will barter and bargain,\nkeeping him in suspense, and every day the price will rise----\"\n\n\"If the Great One need her, let her go,\" said Sanders, \"lest instead of\nmoney presents he sends an army. I will have no war, or women palaver,\nwhich is worse than war, in my country--mark that, chief.\"\n\n\"Lord, your word is my desire,\" said the chief conventionally.\n\nSanders went back to his own people by easy stages. At Isisi he was\ndetained for over a week over a question of witch-craft; at Belembi (in\nthe Isisi country) he stopped three days to settle a case of murder by\nfetish. He was delivering judgment, and Abiboo, the Sergeant of Police,\nwas selecting and testing his stoutest cane for the whipping which was\nto follow, when the chief of the Icheli came flying down the river with\nthree canoes, and Sanders, who, from where he sat, commanded an\nuninterrupted view of the river, knew there was trouble--and guessed\nwhat that trouble was.\n\n\"Justice!\" demanded the chief, his voice trembling with the rage and\nfear he had nursed, \"justice against the Old One, the stealer of girls,\nthe destroyer of cities--may death go to him. Iwa!----\"\n\nThe very day Sanders had left, the messenger of the great king had come,\nand with him a hundred warriors, demanding the dancing girl. True to his\npre-arranged scheme, the chief began the inevitable bargaining over\nterms. The presents offered were too small. The girl was worth a hundred\nthousand rods--nay, a thousand bags of salt.\n\n\"You were mad,\" said Sanders calmly; \"no woman is worth a thousand bags\nof salt.\"\n\n\"Well, that might be,\" admitted the outraged father; \"yet it would be\nfolly to begin by naming a price too low. The bargaining went on\nthrough the night and all the next day, and in the end the envoy of the\ngreat king grew impatient.\n\n\"Let the woman be sent for,\" he said, and obedient to the summons came\nDaihili, demure enough, yet with covert glances of encouragement to the\nunemotional ambassador, and with subtle exhibitions of her charms.\n\n\"Woman,\" said the messenger, \"the greatest of kings desires you, will\nyou come?\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the girl, \"I wish for nothing better.\"\n\nWith that, the hundred armed warriors in attendance at the palaver\nclosed round the girl.\n\n\"And so,\" said Sanders, \"you got nothing?\"\n\n\"Lord, it is as you say,\" moaned the old chief.\n\n\"It is evident,\" said Sanders, \"that an injustice has been done; for no\nman may take a woman unless he pay. I think,\" he added, with a flash of\nthat mordant humour which occasionally illuminated his judgments, \"that\nthe man pays twice, once to the father, and all his life to his\nwife--but that is as may be.\"\n\nSix weeks later, after consultation, Sanders sent a messenger to the\ngreat king, demanding the price of the woman.\n\nWhat happened to the messenger I would rather not describe. That he was\nkilled, is saying the least. Just before he died, when the glaze of\ndeath must have been on his eyes, and his poor wrecked body settling to\nthe rest of oblivion, he was carried to a place before the king's hut,\nand Daihili danced the Dance of the Spirits. This much is now known.\n\nSanders did nothing; nor did the British Government, but hurried notes\nwere exchanged between ambassadors and ministers in Paris, and that was\nthe end of the incident.\n\nTwo Icheli spies went up into the great king's country. One came back\nsaying that the dancing girl was the favourite wife of the old king, and\nthat her whims swayed the destinies of the nation. Also he reported that\nbecause of this slim girl who danced, many men, councillors, and\ncaptains of war had died the death.\n\nThe other spy did not come back.\n\nIt may have been his discovery that induced the girl to send an army\nagainst the Icheli, thinking perchance that her people were spying upon\nher.\n\nOne day the city of Icheli was surrounded by the soldiers of the great\nking, and neither man, woman nor child escaped.\n\nThe news of the massacre did not come to Sanders for a long time. The\nreason was simple there was none to carry the message, for the Icheli\nare isolated folk. One day, however, an Isisi hunting party, searching\nfor elephants, came upon a place where there was a smell of burning and\nmany skeletons--and thus Sanders knew----\n\n\"We cannot,\" wrote Monsieur Leon Marchassa, Minister for Colonial\nAffairs, \"accept responsibility for the misdoings of the king of the\nYitingi, and my Government would regard with sympathetic interest any\nattempt that was made by His Majesty's Government to pacify this\ncountry.\"\n\nBut the British Government did nothing, because war is an expensive\nmatter, and Sanders grinned and cursed his employers genially.\n\nTaking his life in his hands, he went up to the border of Yitingi, with\ntwenty policemen, and sent a messenger--a Yitingi messenger--to the\nking. With the audacity which was not the least of his assets, he\ndemanded that the king should come to him for a palaver.\n\nThis adventure nearly proved abortive at the beginning, for just as the\n_Zaire_ was steaming to the borders Sanders unexpectedly came upon\ntraces of a raiding expedition. There were unmistakable signs as to the\nauthor.\n\n\"I have a mind to turn back and punish that cursed Bosambo, Chief of the\nOchori,\" he said to Sergeant Abiboo, \"for having sworn by a variety of\ngods and devils that he would keep the peace; behold he has been raiding\nin foreign territory.\"\n\n\"He will keep, master,\" said Abiboo, \"besides which, he is in the\nneighbourhood, for his fires are still warm.\"\n\nSo Sanders went on, and sent his message to the king.\n\nHe kept steam in his little boat--he had chosen the only place where the\nriver touches the Yitingi border--and waited, quite prepared to make an\nignominious, if judicious, bolt.\n\nTo his astonishment, his spies brought word that the king was coming. He\nowed this condescension to the influence of the little dancing girl, for\nshe, woman-like, had a memory for rebuffs, and had a score to settle\nwith Mr. Commissioner Sanders.\n\nThe great king arrived, and across the meadow-like lands that fringe the\nriver on both sides Sanders watched the winding procession with mingled\nfeelings. The king halted a hundred yards from the river, and his big\nscarlet umbrella was the centre of a black line of soldiers spreading\nout on either hand for three hundred yards.\n\nThen a party detached itself and came towards the dead tree by the water\nside, whereon hung limply in the still air the ensign of England.\n\n\"This,\" said Sanders to himself, \"is where I go dead one time.\"\n\nIt is evidence of the seriousness of the situation, as it appealed to\nhim, that he permitted himself to descend to Coast English.\n\n\"The king, the Great One, awaits you, white man, offering you safety in\nhis shadow,\" said the king's messenger; and Sanders nodded. He walked\nleisurely toward the massed troops, and presently appeared before the\nold man squatting on a heap of skins and blinking like an ape in the\nsunlight.\n\n\"Lord king, live for ever,\" said Sanders glibly, and as he raised his\nhand in salute he saw the girl regarding him from under knit brows.\n\n\"What is your wish, white man?\" said the old king; \"what rich presents\ndo you bring, that you call me many days' journey?\"\n\n\"Lord, I bring no presents,\" said Sanders boldly; \"but a message from a\nking who is greater than you, whose soldiers outnumber the sands of the\nriver, and whose lands extend from the east to the west, from the north\nto the south.\"\n\n\"There is no such king,\" snarled the old man. \"You lie, white man, and I\nwill cut your tongue into little strips.\"\n\n\"Let him give his message, master,\" said the girl.\n\n\"This is the message,\" said Sanders. He stood easily, with his hands in\nthe pockets of his white uniform jacket, and the king was nearer death\nthan he knew. \"My master says: 'Because the Great King of Yitingi has\neaten up the Icheli folk: because he has crossed the borderland and\nbrought suffering to my people, my heart is sore. Yet, if the Great King\nwill pay a fine of one thousand head of cattle and will allow free\naccess to his country for my soldiers and my commissioners, I will live\nin peace with him.'\"\n\nThe old man laughed, a wicked, cackling laugh.\n\n\"Oh, ko!\" he chuckled; \"a great king!\"\n\nThen the girl stepped forward.\n\n\"Sandi,\" she said, \"once you put me to shame, for when I would have\ndanced for you, you slept.\"\n\n\"To you, Daihili,\" said Sanders steadily, \"I say nothing; I make no\npalaver with women, for that is not the custom or the law. Still less\ndo I talk with dancing girls. My business is with Limbili the king.\"\n\nThe king was talking rapidly behind his hand to a man who bent over him,\nand Sanders, his hands still in his jacket pockets, snapped down the\nsafety catches of his automatic Colts.\n\nAll the time the girl spoke he was watching from the corners of his eyes\nthe man who talked with the king. He saw him disappear in the crowd of\nsoldiers who stood behind the squatting figures, and prepared for the\nworst.\n\n\"Since I may not dance for you,\" the girl was saying, \"my lord the king\nwould have you dance for me.\"\n\n\"That is folly,\" said Sanders: then he saw the line on either side wheel\nforward, and out came his pistols.\n\n\"Crack! Crack!\"\n\nThe shot intended for the king missed him, and broke the leg of a\nsoldier behind.\n\nIt had been hopeless from the first; this Sanders realised with some\nphilosophy, as he lay stretched on the baked earth, trussed like a fowl,\nand exceedingly uncomfortable. At the first shot Abiboo, obeying his\ninstructions, would turn the bows of the steamer down stream; this was\nthe only poor satisfaction he could derive from the situation.\n\nThroughout that long day, with a pitiless sun beating down upon him, he\nlay in the midst of an armed guard, waiting for the death which must\ncome in some dreadful form or other.\n\nHe was undismayed, for this was the logical end of the business. Toward\nthe evening they gave him water, which was most acceptable. From the\ngossip of his guards he gathered that the evening had been chosen for\nhis exit, but the manner of it he must guess.\n\nFrom where he lay he could see, by turning his head a little, the king's\ntent, and all the afternoon men were busily engaged in heaping flat\nstones upon the earth before the pavilion. They were of singular\nuniformity, and would appear to be specially hewn and dressed for some\npurpose. He asked his guard a question.\n\n\"They are the dancing stones, white man,\" said the soldier, \"they come\nfrom the mountain near the city.\"\n\nWhen darkness fell a huge fire was lit; it was whilst he was watching\nthis that he heard of the _Zaire's_ escape, and was thankful.\n\nHe must have been dozing, exhausted in body and mind, when he was\ndragged to his feet, his bonds were slipped, and he was led before the\nking. Then he saw what form his torture was to take.\n\nThe flat stones were being taken from the fire with wooden pincers and\nlaid to form a rough pavement before the tent.\n\n\"White man,\" said the king, as rude hands pulled off the Commissioner's\nboots, \"the woman Daihili would see you dance.\"\n\n\"Be assured, king,\" said Sanders, between his teeth, \"that some day you\nshall dance in hell in more pleasant company, having first danced at the\nend of a rope.\"\n\n\"If you live through the dancing,\" said the king, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nA ring of soldiers with their spears pointing inward surrounded the\npavement, those on the side of the tent crouching so that their bodies\nmight not interrupt the Great One's view.\n\n\"Dance,\" said the king; and Sanders was thrown forward. The first stone\nhe touched was only just warm, and on this he stood still till a\nspear-thrust sent him to the next. It was smoking hot, and he leapt up\nwith a stifled cry. Down he came to another, hotter still, and leapt\nagain--\n\n\"Throw water over him,\" said the amused king, when they dragged the\nfainting man off the stones, his clothes smouldering where he lay in an\ninert heap.\n\n\"Now dance,\" said the king again--when out of the darkness about the\ngroup leapt a quivering pencil of yellow light.\n\nHa-ha-ha-ha-a-a-a!\n\nAbiboo's Maxim-gun was in action at a range of fifty yards, and with him\nfive hundred Ochori men under that chief of chiefs, Bosambo.\n\nFor a moment the Yitingi stood, and then, as with a wild yell which was\nthree-parts fear, the Ochori charged, the king's soldiers broke and\nfled.\n\nThey carried Sanders to the steamer quickly, for the Yitingi would\nre-form, being famous night fighters. Sanders, sitting on the deck of\nthe steamer nursing his burnt feet and swearing gently, heard the\nscramble of the Ochori as they got into their canoes, heard the grunting\nof his Houssas hoisting the Maxim on board, and fainted again.\n\n\"Master,\" said Bosambo in the morning, \"many moons ago you made charge\nagainst the Ochori, saying they would not fight. That was true, but in\nthose far-off days there was no chief Bosambo. Now, because of my\nteaching, and because I have put fire into their stomachs, they have\ndefeated the soldiers of the Great King.\"\n\nHe posed magnificently, for on his shoulders was a mantle of gold thread\nwoven with blue, which was not his the night before.\n\n\"Bosambo,\" said Sanders, \"though I have a score to settle with you for\nbreaking the law by raiding, I am grateful that the desire for the\nproperties of others brought you to this neighbourhood. Where did you\nget that cloak?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I stole it,\" said Bosambo frankly, \"from the tent of the Great King;\nalso I brought with me one of the stones upon which my lord would not\nstand. I brought this, thinking that it would be evidence.\"\n\nSanders nodded, and bit his cigar with a little grimace. \"On which my\nlord would not stand,\" was very prettily put.\n\n\"Let me see it,\" he said; and Bosambo himself carried it to him.\n\nIt had borne the heat well enough, but rough handling had chipped a\ncorner; and Sanders looked at this cracked corner long and earnestly.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, \"is an argument that no properly constituted British\nGovernment can overlook--I see Limbili's finish.\"\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nThe rainy season came round and the springtime, before Sanders again\nstood in the presence of the Great King. All around him was desolation\nand death. The plain was strewn with the bodies of men, and the big city\nwas a smoking ruin. To the left, three regiments of Houssas were\nencamped; to the right, two battalions of African Rifles sat at \"chop,\"\nand the snappy notes of their bugles came sharply through the still air.\n\n\"I am an old man,\" mumbled the king; but the girl who crouched at his\nside said nothing. Only her eyes never left the brick-red face of\nSanders.\n\n\"Old you are,\" he said, \"yet not too old to die.\"\n\n\"I am a great king,\" whined the other, \"and it is not proper that a\ngreat king should hang.\"\n\n\"Yet if you live,\" said Sanders, \"many other great kings will say, 'We\nmay commit these abominations, and because of our greatness we shall\nlive.'\"\n\n\"And what of me, lord?\" said the girl in a low voice.\n\n\"You!\" Sanders looked at her. \"Ho, hi,\" he said, as though he had just\nremembered her. \"You are the dancing girl? Now we shall do nothing with\nyou, Daihili--because you are nothing.\"\n\nHe saw her shrink as one under a lash.\n\nAfter the execution, the Colonel of the Houssas and Sanders were talking\ntogether.\n\n\"What I can't understand,\" said the Colonel, \"is why we suddenly decided\nupon this expedition. It has been necessary for years--but why this\nsudden activity?\"\n\nSanders grinned mysteriously.\n\n\"A wonderful people, the English,\" he said airily. \"Old Man Limbili\nsteals British subjects, and I report it. 'Very sad,' says England. He\nwipes out a nation. 'Deplorable!' says England. He makes me dance on the\noriginal good-intention stones of Hades. 'Treat it as a joke,' says\nEngland; but when I point out that these stones assay one ounce ten\npenny-weights of refined gold, and that we've happed upon the richest\nreef in Central Africa, there's an army here in six months!\"\n\nI personally think that Sanders may have been a little unjust in his\npoint of view. After all, wars cost money, and wars of vengeance are\nnotoriously unprofitable.\n\n[Footnote 2: Lo Bengola, the King of the Matabele.]\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER VII.\n\n  THE FOREST OF HAPPY DREAMS.\n\n\nSanders was tied up at a \"wooding,\" being on his way to collect taxes\nand administer justice to the folk who dwell on the lower Isisi River.\n\nBy the river-side the little steamer was moored. There was a tiny bay\nhere, and the swift currents of the river were broken to a gentle flow;\nnone the less, he inspected the shore-ends of the wire hawsers before he\ncrossed the narrow plank that led to the deck of the _Zaire_. The wood\nwas stacked on the deck, ready for to-morrow's run. The new water-gauge\nhad been put in by Yoka, the engineer, as he had ordered; the engines\nhad been cleaned; and Sanders nodded approvingly. He stepped lightly\nover two or three sleeping forms curled up on the deck, and gained the\nshore. \"Now I think I'll turn in,\" he muttered, and looked at his watch.\nIt was nine o'clock. He stood for a moment on the crest of the steep\nbank, and stared back across the river. The night was black, but he saw\nthe outlines of the forest on the other side. He saw the jewelled sky,\nand the pale reflection of stars in the water. Then he went to his tent,\nand leisurely got into his pyjamas. He jerked two tabloids from a tiny\nbottle, swallowed them, drank a glass of water, and thrust his head\nthrough the tent opening. \"Ho, Sokani!\" he called, speaking in the\nvernacular, \"let the _lo-koli_ sound!\"\n\nHe went to bed.\n\nHe heard the rustle of men moving, the gurgles of laughter as his subtle\njoke was repeated, for the Cambul people have a keen sense of humour,\nand then the penetrating rattle of sticks on the native drum--a hollow\ntree-trunk. Fiercely it beat--furiously, breathlessly, with now and then\na deeper note as the drummer, using all his art, sent the message of\nsleep to the camp.\n\nIn one wild crescendo, the _lo-koli_ ceased, and Sanders turned with a\nsigh of content and closed his eyes--he sat up suddenly. He must have\ndozed; but he was wide awake now.\n\nHe listened, then slipped out of bed, pulling on his mosquito boots.\nInto the darkness of the night he stepped, and found N'Kema, the\nengineer, waiting.\n\n\"You heard, master?\" said the native.\n\n\"I heard,\" said Sanders, with a puzzled face, \"yet we are nowhere near a\nvillage.\"\n\nHe listened.\n\nFrom the night came a hundred whispering noises, but above all these,\nunmistakable, the faint clatter of an answering drum. The white man\nfrowned in his perplexity. \"No village is nearer than the Bongindanga,\"\nhe muttered, \"not even a fishing village; the woods are deserted----\"\n\nThe native held up a warning finger, and bent his head, listening. He\nwas reading the message that the drum sent. Sanders waited; he knew the\nwonderful fact of this native telegraph, how it sent news through the\ntrackless wilds. He could not understand it, no European could; but he\nhad respect for its mystery.\n\n\"A white man is here,\" read the native; \"he has the sickness.\"\n\n\"A white man!\"\n\nIn the darkness Sanders' eyebrows rose incredulously.\n\n\"He is a foolish one,\" N'Kema read; \"he sits in the Forest of Happy\nThoughts, and will not move.\"\n\nSanders clicked his lips impatiently. \"No white man would sit in the\nForest of Happy Thoughts,\" he said, half to himself, \"unless he were\nmad.\"\n\nBut the distant drum monotonously repeated the outrageous news. Here,\nindeed, in the heart of the loveliest glade in all Africa, encamped in\nthe very centre of the Green Path of Death, was a white man, a sick\nwhite man--in the Forest of Happy Thoughts--a sick white man.\n\nSo the drum went on and on, till Sanders, rousing his own _lo-koli_ man,\nsent an answer crashing along the river, and began to dress hurriedly.\n\nIn the forest lay a very sick man. He had chosen the site for the camp\nhimself. It was in a clearing, near a little creek that wound between\nhigh elephant-grass to the river. Mainward chose it, just before the\nsickness came, because it was pretty. This was altogether an inadequate\nreason; but Mainward was a sentimentalist, and his life was a long\nrecord of choosing pretty camping places, irrespective of danger. \"He\nwas,\" said a newspaper, commenting on the crowning disaster which sent\nhim a fugitive from justice to the wild lands of Africa, \"over-burdened\nwith imagination.\" Mainward was cursed with ill-timed confidence; this\nwas one of the reasons he chose to linger in that deadly strip of land\nof the Ituri, which is clumsily named by the natives \"The\nLands-where-all-bad-thoughts-become-good-thoughts\" and poetically\nadapted by explorers and daring traders as \"The Forest of Happy Dreams.\"\nOver-confidence had generally been Mainward's undoing--over-confidence\nin the ability of his horses to win races; over-confidence in his own\nability to secure money to hide his defalcations--he was a director in\nthe Welshire County Bank once--over-confidence in securing the love of a\nwoman, who, when the crash came, looked at him blankly and said she was\nsorry, but she had no idea he felt towards her like that----\n\nNow Mainward lifted his aching head from the pillow and cursed aloud at\nthe din. He was endowed with the smattering of pigeon-English which a\nman may acquire from a three months' sojourn divided between Sierra\nLeone and Grand Bassam.\n\n\"Why for they make 'em cursed noise, eh?\" he fretted. \"You plenty\nfool-man, Abiboo.\"\n\n\"Si, senor,\" agreed the Kano boy, calmly.\n\n\"Stop it, d'ye hear? stop it!\" raved the man on the tumbled bed; \"this\nnoise is driving me mad--tell them to stop the drum.\"\n\nThe _lo-koli_ stopped of its own accord, for the listeners in the sick\nman's camp had heard the faint answer from Sanders.\n\n\"Come here, Abiboo--I want some milk; open a fresh tin; and tell the\ncook I want some soup, too.\"\n\nThe servant left him muttering and tossing from side to side on the\ncreaking camp bedstead. Mainward had many strange things to think about.\nIt was strange how they all clamoured for immediate attention; strange\nhow they elbowed and fought one another in their noisy claims to his\nnotice. Of course, there was the bankruptcy and the discovery at the\nbank--it was very decent of that inspector fellow to clear out--and\nEthel, and the horses, and--and----\n\nThe Valley of Happy Dreams! That would make a good story if Mainward\ncould write; only, unfortunately, he could not write. He could sign\nthings, sign his name \"three months after date pay to the order of----\"\nHe could sign other people's names; he groaned, and winced at the\nthought.\n\nBut here was a forest where bad thoughts became good, and, God knows,\nhis mind was ill-furnished. He wanted peace and sleep and happiness--he\ngreatly desired happiness. Now suppose \"Fairy Lane\" had won the\nWokingham Stakes? It had not, of course (he winced again at the bad\nmemory), but suppose it had? Suppose he could have found a friend who\nwould have lent him 16,000, or even if Ethel----\n\n\"Master,\" said Abiboo's voice, \"dem puck-a-puck, him lib for come.\"\n\n\"Eh, what's that?\"\n\nMainward turned almost savagely on the man.\n\n\"Puck-a-puck--you hear'um?\"\n\nBut the sick man could not hear the smack of the _Zaire_'s stern wheel,\nas the little boat breasted the downward rush of the river--he was\nsurprised to see that it was dawn, and grudgingly admitted to himself\nthat he had slept. He closed his eyes again and had a strange dream. The\nprincipal figure was a small, tanned, clean-shaven man in a white\nhelmet, who wore a dingy yellow overcoat over his pyjamas.\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" said the stranger.\n\n\"Rotten bad,\" growled Mainward, \"especially about Ethel; don't you think\nit was pretty low down of her to lead me on to believe she was awfully\nfond of me, and then at the last minute to chuck me?\"\n\n\"Shocking,\" said the strange, white man gravely, \"but put her out of\nyour mind just now; she isn't worth troubling about. What do you say to\nthis?\"\n\nHe held up a small, greenish pellet between his forefinger and thumb,\nand Mainward laughed weakly.\n\n\"Oh, rot!\" he chuckled faintly. \"You're one of those Forest of Happy\nDreams Johnnies; what's that? A love philtre?\" He was hysterically\namused at the witticism.\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"Love or life, it's all one,\" he said, but apparently unamused. \"Swallow\nit!\"\n\nMainward giggled and obeyed.\n\n\"And now,\" said the stranger--this was six hours later--\"the best thing\nyou can do is to let my boys put you on my steamer and take you down\nriver.\"\n\nMainward shook his head. He had awakened irritable and lamentably weak.\n\n\"My dear chap, it's awfully kind of you to have come--by the way, I\nsuppose you _are_ a doctor?\"\n\nSanders shook his head.\n\n\"On the contrary, I am the Commissioner of this district,\" he said\nflippantly--\"but you were saying----\"\n\n\"I want to stay here--it's devilish pretty.\"\n\n\"Devilish is the very adjective I should have used--my dear man, this is\nthe plague spot of the Congo; it's the home of every death-dealing fly\nand bug in Africa.\"\n\nHe waved his hand to the hidden vistas of fresh green glades, of\ngorgeous creepers shown in the light of the camp fires.\n\n\"Look at the grass,\" he said; \"it's homeland grass--that's the seductive\npart of it; I nearly camped here myself. Come, my friend, let me take\nyou to my camp.\"\n\nMainward shook his head obstinately.\n\n\"I'm obliged, but I'll stay here for a day or so. I want to try the\nsupernatural effects of this pleasant place,\" he said with a weary\nsmile. \"I've got so many thoughts that need treatment.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Sanders roughly, \"you know jolly well how this forest\ngot its name; it is called Happy Dreams because it's impregnated with\nfever, and with every disease from beri-beri to sleeping sickness. You\ndon't wake from the dreams you dream here. Man, I know this country, and\nyou're a newcomer; you've trekked here because you wanted to get away\nfrom life and start all over again.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\" Mainward's face flushed; and he spoke a little\nstiffly.\n\n\"Oh, I know all about you--didn't I tell you I was the Commissioner? I\nwas in England when things were going rocky with you, and I've read the\nrest in the papers I get from time to time. But all that is nothing to\nme. I'm here to help you start fair. If you had wanted to commit\nsuicide, why come to Africa to do it? Be sensible and shift your camp;\nI'll send my steamer back for your men. Will you come?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mainward sulkily. \"I don't want to, I'm not keen; besides,\nI'm not fit to travel.\"\n\nHere was an argument which Sanders could not answer. He was none too\nsure upon that point himself, and he hesitated before he spoke again.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said at length, \"suppose you stay another day to give\nyou a chance to pull yourself together. I'll come along to-morrow with a\ntip-top invalid chair for you--is it a bet?\"\n\nMainward held out his shaking hand, and the ghost of a smile puckered\nthe corners of his eyes. \"It's a bet,\" he said.\n\nHe watched the Commissioner walk through the camp, speaking to one man\nafter another in a strange tongue. A singular, masterful man this,\nthought Mainward. Would he have mastered Ethel? He watched the stranger\nwith curious eyes, and noted how his own lazy devils of carriers jumped\nat his word.\n\n\"Good-night,\" said Sanders' voice; and Mainward looked up. \"You must\ntake another of these pellets, and to-morrow you'll be as fit as a\ndonkey-engine. I've got to get back to my camp to-night, or I shall find\nhalf my stores stolen in the morning; but if you'd rather I stopped----\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied the other hastily. He wanted to be alone. He had lots\nof matters to settle with himself. There was the question of Ethel, for\ninstance.\n\n\"You won't forget to take the tabloid?\"\n\n\"No. I say, I'm awfully obliged to you for coming. You've been a good\nwhite citizen.\"\n\nSanders smiled. \"Don't talk nonsense!\" he said good-humouredly. \"This is\nall brotherly love. White to white, and kin to kin, don't you know?\nWe're all alone here, and there isn't a man of our colour within five\nhundred miles. Good-night, and please take the tabloid----\"\n\nMainward lay listening to the noise of departure. He thought he heard a\nlittle bell tingle. That must be for the engines. Then he heard the\npuck-a-puck of the wheel--so that was how the steamer got its name.\n\nAbiboo came with some milk. \"You take um medicine, master?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I take um,\" murmured Mainward; but the green tabloid was underneath his\npillow.\n\nThen there began to steal over him a curious sensation of content. He\ndid not analyse it down to its first cause. He had had sufficient\nintrospective exercise for one day. It came to him as a pleasant shock\nto realise that he was happy.\n\nHe opened his eyes and looked round.\n\nHis bed was laid in the open, and he drew aside the curtains of his net\nto get a better view.\n\nA little man was walking briskly toward him along the velvet stretch of\ngrass that sloped down from the glade, and Mainward whistled.\n\n\"Atty,\" he gasped. \"By all that's wonderful.\"\n\nAtty, indeed, it was: the same wizened Atty as of yore; but no longer\npulling the long face to which Mainward had been accustomed. The little\nman was in his white riding-breeches, his diminutive top-boots were\nsplashed with mud, and on the crimson of his silk jacket there was\nevidence of a hard race. He touched his cap jerkily with his whip, and\nshifted the burden of the racing saddle he carried to the other arm.\n\n\"Why, Atty,\" said Mainward, with a smile, \"what on earth are you doing\nhere?\"\n\n\"It's a short way to the jockey's room, sir,\" said the little man. \"I've\njust weighed in. I thought the Fairy would do it, sir, and she did.\"\n\nMainward nodded wisely. \"I knew she would, too,\" he said.\n\n\"Did she give you a smooth ride?\"\n\nThe jockey grinned again. \"She never does that,\" he said. \"But she ran\ngamely enough. Coming up out of the Dip, she hung a little, but I showed\nher the whip, and she came on as straight as a die. I thought once the\nStalk would beat us--I got shut in, but I pulled her round, and we were\nnever in difficulties. I could have won by ten lengths,\" said Atty.\n\n\"You could have won by ten lengths,\" repeated Mainward in wonder. \"Well,\nyou've done me a good turn, Atty. This win will get me out of one of the\nbiggest holes that ever a reckless man tumbled into--I shall not forget\nyou, Atty.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you won't, sir,\" said the little jockey gratefully; \"if you'll\nexcuse me now, sir----\"\n\nMainward nodded and watched him, as he moved quickly through the trees.\n\nThere were several people in the glade now, and Mainward looked down\nruefully at his soiled duck suit. \"What an ass I was to come like this,\"\nhe muttered in his annoyance. \"I might have known that I should have met\nall these people.\"\n\nThere was one he did not wish to see; and as soon as he sighted Venn,\nwith his shy eyes and his big nose, Mainward endeavoured to slip back\nout of observation. But Venn saw him, and came tumbling through the\ntrees, with his big, flabby hand extended and his dull eyes aglow.\n\n\"Hullo, hullo!\" he grinned, \"been looking for you.\"\n\nMainward muttered some inconsequent reply. \"Rum place to find you, eh?\"\nVenn removed his shining silk hat and mopped his brow with an awesome\nsilk handkerchief.\n\n\"But look here, old feller--about that money?\"\n\n\"Don't worry, my dear man,\" Mainward interposed easily. \"I shall pay you\nnow.\"\n\n\"That ain't what I mean,\" said the other impetuously; \"a few hundred\nmore or less does not count. But you wanted a big sum----\"\n\n\"And you told me you'd see me----\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Venn put in hastily; \"but that was before Kaffirs\nstarted jumpin'. Old feller, you can have it!\"\n\nHe said this with grotesque emphasis, standing with his legs wide apart,\nhis hat perched on the back of his head, his plump hands dramatically\noutstretched: and Mainward laughed outright.\n\n\"Sixteen thousand?\" he asked.\n\n\"Or twenty,\" said the other impressively. \"I want to show you----\"\nSomebody called him, and with a hurried apology he went blundering up\nthe green slope, stopping and turning back to indulge in a little dumb\nshow illustrative of his confidence in Mainward and his willingness to\noblige.\n\nMainward was laughing, a low, gurgling laugh of pure enjoyment. Venn, of\nall people! Venn, with his accursed questions and talk of securities.\nWell! Well!\n\nThen his merriment ceases, and he winced again, and his heart beat\nfaster and faster, and a curious weakness came over him----\n\nHow splendidly cool she looked.\n\nShe walked in the clearing, a white, slim figure; he heard the swish of\nher skirt as she came through the long grass--white, with a green belt\nall encrusted with gold embroidery. He took in every detail\nhungrily--the dangling gold ornaments that hung from her belt, the lace\ncollar at her throat, the----\n\nShe did not hurry to him, that was not her way.\n\nBut in her eyes dawned a gradual tenderness--those dear eyes that\ndropped before his shyly.\n\n\"Ethel!\" he whispered, and dared to take her hand.\n\n\"Aren't you wonderfully surprised?\" she said.\n\n\"Ethel! Here!\"\n\n\"I--I had to come.\"\n\nShe would not look at him, but he saw the pink in her cheek and heard\nthe faltering voice with a wild hope. \"I behaved so badly, dear--so very\nbadly.\"\n\nShe hung her head.\n\n\"Dear! dear!\" he muttered, and groped toward her like a blind man.\n\nShe was in his arms, crushed against his breast, the perfume of her\npresence in his brain.\n\n\"I had to come to you.\" Her hot cheek was against his. \"I love you so.\"\n\n\"Me--love me? Do you mean it?\" He was tremulous with happiness, and his\nvoice broke--\"Dearest.\"\n\nHer face was upturned to his, her lips so near; he felt her heart\nbeating as furiously as his own. He kissed her--her lips, her eyes, her\ndear hair----\n\n\"O, God, I'm happy!\" she sobbed, \"so--so happy----\"\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nSanders sprang ashore just as the sun was rising, and came thoughtfully\nthrough the undergrowth to the camp. Abiboo, squatting by the curtained\nbed, did not rise. Sanders walked to the bed, pulled aside the mosquito\nnetting, and bent over the man who lay there.\n\nThen he drew the curtains again, lit his pipe slowly, and looked down at\nAbiboo.\n\n\"When did he die?\" he asked.\n\n\"In the dark of the morning, master,\" said the man.\n\nSanders nodded slowly. \"Why did you not send for me?\"\n\nFor a moment the squatting figure made no reply, then he rose and\nstretched himself.\n\n\"Master,\" he said, speaking in Arabic--which is a language which allows\nof nice distinctions--\"this man was happy; he walked in the Forest of\nHappy Thoughts; why should I call him back to a land where there was\nneither sunshine nor happiness, but only night and pain and sickness?\"\n\n\"You're a philosopher,\" said Sanders irritably.\n\n\"I am a follower of the Prophet,\" said Abiboo, the Kano boy; \"and all\nthings are according to God's wisdom.\"\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER VIII.\n\n  THE AKASAVAS.\n\n\nYou who do not understand how out of good evil may arise must take your\nspade to some virgin grassland, untouched by the hand of man from the\nbeginning of time. Here is soft, sweet grass, and never a sign of\nnettle, or rank, evil weed. It is as God made it. Turn the soil with\nyour spade, intent on improving His handiwork, and next season--weeds,\nnettles, lank creeping things, and coarse-leafed vegetation cover the\nground.\n\nYour spade has aroused to life the dormant seeds of evil, germinated the\nugly waste life that all these long years has been sleeping out of\nsight--in twenty years, with careful cultivation, you may fight down the\nweeds and restore the grassland, but it takes a lot of doing.\n\nYour intentions may have been the best in disturbing the primal sod; you\nmay have had views of roses flourishing where grass was; the result is\nvery much the same.\n\nI apply this parable to the story of a missionary and his work. The\nmissionary was a good man, though of the wrong colour. He had large\nideas on his duty to his fellows; he was inspired by the work of his\ncloth in another country; but, as Sanders properly said, India is not\nAfrica.\n\nKenneth McDolan came to Mr. Commissioner Sanders with a letter of\nintroduction from the new Administration.\n\nSanders was at \"chop\" one blazing morning when his servant, who was also\nhis sergeant, Abiboo, brought a card to him. It was a nice card, rounded\nat the corners, and gilt-edged, and in the centre, in old English type,\nwas the inscription--\n\n  Rev. KENNETH McDOLAN.\n\nUnderneath was scribbled in pencil: \"On a brief visit.\" Sanders sniffed\nimpatiently, for \"reverend\" meant \"missionary,\" and \"missionary\" might\nmean anything. He looked at the card again and frowned in his\nperplexity. Somehow the old English and the reverendness of the visiting\ncard did not go well with the rounded corners and the gilt edge.\n\n\"Where is he?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Master,\" said Abiboo, \"he is on the verandah. Shall I kick him off?\"\nAbiboo said this very naturally and with simple directness, and Sanders\nstared at him.\n\n\"Son of sin!\" he said sternly, \"is it thus you speak of God-men, and of\nwhite men at that?\"\n\n\"This man wears the clothes of a God-man,\" said Abiboo serenely; \"but he\nis a black man, therefore of no consequence.\"\n\nSanders pulled a pair of mosquito boots over his pyjamas and swore to\nhimself.\n\n\"White missionaries, yes,\" he said wrathfully, \"but black missionaries I\nwill not endure.\"\n\nThe Reverend Kenneth was sitting in Sanders' basket-chair, one leg flung\nnegligently over one side of the chair to display a silk sock. His\nfinger-tips were touching, and he was gazing with good-natured tolerance\nat the little green garden which was the Commissioner's special delight.\n\nHe was black, very black; but his manners were easy, and his bearing\nself-possessed.\n\nHe nodded smilingly to Sanders and extended a lazy hand.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Commissioner,\" he said in faultless English, \"I have heard a\ngreat deal about you.\"\n\n\"Get out of that chair,\" said Sanders, who had no small talk worth\nmentioning, \"and stand up when I come out to you! What do you want?\"\n\nThe Reverend Kenneth rose quickly, and accepted the situation with a\nrapidity which will be incomprehensible to any who do not know how\nthumbnail deep is the cultivation of the cultured savage.\n\n\"I am on a brief visit,\" he said, a note of deference in his tone. \"I am\ntaking the small towns and villages along the coast, holding services,\nand I desire permission to speak to your people.\"\n\nThis was not the speech he had prepared. He had come straight from\nEngland, where he had been something of a lion in Bayswater society, and\nwhere, too, his theological attainments had won him regard and no small\namount of fame in even a wider circle.\n\n\"You may speak to my people,\" said Sanders; \"but you may not address the\nKano folk nor the Houssas, because they are petrified in the faith of\nthe Prophet.\"\n\nRegaining his self-possession, the missionary smiled.\n\n\"To bring light into dark places----\" he began.\n\n\"Cut it out,\" said Sanders briefly; \"the palaver is finished.\" He turned\non his heel and re-entered the bungalow.\n\nThen a thought struck him.\n\n\"Hi!\" he shouted, and the retiring missionary turned back.\n\n\"Where did you pick up the 'Kenneth McDolan'?\" he asked.\n\nThe negro smiled again.\n\n\"It is the patronymic bestowed upon me at Sierra Leone by a good\nChristian white man, who brought me up and educated me as though I were\nhis own son,\" he recited.\n\nSanders showed his teeth.\n\n\"I have heard of such cases,\" he said unpleasantly.\n\nThe next day the missionary announced his intention of proceeding up\ncountry. He came in to see Sanders as though nothing had happened.\nPerhaps he expected to find the Commissioner a little ashamed of\nhimself; but if this was so he was disappointed, for Sanders was\nblatantly unrepentant.\n\n\"You've got a letter from the Administration,\" he said, \"so I can't stop\nyou.\"\n\n\"There is work for me,\" said the missionary, \"work of succour and\nrelief. In India some four hundred thousand----\"\n\n\"This is not India,\" said Sanders shortly; and with no other word the\nnative preacher went his way.\n\nThose who know the Akasava people best know them for their\nlaziness--save in matter of vendetta, or in the settlement of such blood\nfeuds as come their way, or in the lifting of each other's goats, in all\nwhich matters they display an energy and an agility truly inexplicable.\n\"He is an Akasava man--he points with his foot,\" is a proverb of the\nUpper River, and the origin of the saying goes back to a misty time when\n(as the legend goes) a stranger happened upon a man of the tribe lying\nin the forest.\n\n\"Friend,\" said the stranger, \"I am lost. Show me the way to the river\";\nand the Akasava warrior, raising a leg from the ground, pointed with his\ntoe to the path.\n\nThough this legend lacks something in point of humour, it is regarded as\nthe acme of mirth-provoking stories from Bama to the Lado country.\n\nIt was six months after the Reverend Kenneth McDolan had left for his\nstation that there came to Sanders at his headquarters a woeful\ndeputation, arriving in two canoes in the middle of the night, and\nawaiting him when he came from his bath to the broad stoep of his house\nin the morning--a semi-circle of chastened and gloomy men, who squatted\non the wooden stoep, regarding him with the utmost misery.\n\n\"Lord, we are of the Akasava people,\" said the spokesman, \"and we have\ncome a long journey.\"\n\n\"So I am aware,\" said Sanders, with acrid dryness, \"unless the Akasava\ncountry has shifted its position in the night. What do you seek?\"\n\n\"Master, we are starving,\" said the speaker, \"for our crops have failed,\nand there is no fish in the river; therefore we have come to you, who\nare our father.\"\n\nNow this was a most unusual request; for the Central African native does\nnot easily starve, and, moreover, there had come no news of crop failure\nfrom the Upper River.\n\n\"All this sounds like a lie,\" said Sanders thoughtfully, \"for how may a\ncrop fail in the Akasava country, yet be more than sufficient in Isisi?\nMoreover, fish do not leave their playground without cause, and if they\ndo they may be followed.\"\n\nThe spokesman shifted uneasily.\n\n\"Master, we have had much sickness,\" he said, \"and whilst we cared for\none another the planting season had passed; and, as for the fish, our\nyoung men were too full of sorrow for their dead to go long journeys.\"\nSanders stared.\n\n\"Therefore we have come from our chief asking you to save us, for we are\nstarving.\"\n\nThe man spoke with some confidence, and this was the most surprising\nthing of all. Sanders was nonplussed, frankly confounded. For all the\neccentric course his daily life took, there was a certain regularity\neven in its irregularity. But here was a new and unfamiliar situation.\nSuch things mean trouble, and he was about to probe this matter to its\ndepth.\n\n\"I have nothing to give you,\" he said, \"save this advice--that you\nreturn swiftly to where you came from and carry my word to your chief.\nLater I will come and make inquiries.\"\n\nThe men were not satisfied, and an elder, wrinkled with age, and\nsooty-grey of head, spoke up.\n\n\"It is said, master,\" he mumbled, through his toothless jaws, \"that in\nother lands when men starve there come many white men bringing grain and\ncomfort.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\nSanders' eyes narrowed.\n\n\"Wait,\" he said, and walked quickly through the open door of his\nbungalow.\n\nWhen he came out he carried a pliant whip of rhinoceros-hide, and the\ndeputation, losing its serenity, fled precipitately.\n\nSanders watched the two canoes paddling frantically up stream, and the\nsmile was without any considerable sign of amusement. That same night\nthe _Zaire_ left for the Akasava country, carrying a letter to the\nReverend Kenneth McDolan, which was brief, but unmistakable in its\ntenor.\n\n    \"Dear Sir,\"--it ran--\"You will accompany the bearer to\n    headquarters, together with your belongings. In the event of\n    your refusing to comply with this request, I have instructed my\n    sergeant to arrest you. Yours faithfully,\n\n      \"H. Sanders, _Commissioner_.\"\n\n\"And the reason I am sending you out of this country,\" said Sanders, \"is\nbecause you have put funny ideas into the heads of my people.\"\n\n\"I assure you----\" began the negro.\n\n\"I don't want your assurance,\" said Sanders, \"you are not going to work\nan Indian Famine Fund in Central Africa.\"\n\n\"The people were starving----\"\n\nSanders smiled.\n\n\"I have sent word to them that I am coming to Akasava,\" he said grimly,\n\"and that I will take the first starved-looking man I see and beat him\ntill he is sore.\"\n\nThe next day the missionary went, to the intense relief, be it said, of\nthe many white missionaries scattered up and down the river; for,\nstrange as it may appear, a negro preacher who wears a black coat and\nsilk socks is regarded with a certain amount of suspicion.\n\nTrue to his promise, Sanders made his visit, but found none to thrash,\nfor he came to a singularly well-fed community that had spent a whole\nweek in digging out of the secret hiding-places the foodstuffs which, at\nthe suggestion of a too zealous seeker after fame, it had concealed.\n\n\"Here,\" said Sanders, wickedly, \"endeth the first lesson.\"\n\nBut he was far from happy. It is a remarkable fact that once you\ninterfere with the smooth current of native life all manner of things\nhappen. It cannot be truthfully said that the events that followed on\nthe retirement from active life of the Reverend Kenneth McDolan were\nimmediately traceable to his ingenious attempt to engineer a famine in\nAkasava. But he had sown a seed, the seed of an idea that somebody was\nresponsible for their well-being--he had set up a beautiful idol of\nPauperism, a new and wonderful fetish. In the short time of his stay he\nhad instilled into the heathen mind the dim, vague, and elusive idea of\nthe Brotherhood of Man.\n\nThis Sanders discovered, when, returning from his visit of inspection,\nhe met, drifting with the stream, a canoe in which lay a prone man,\nlazily setting his course with half-hearted paddle strokes.\n\nSanders, on the bridge of his tiny steamer, pulled the little string\nthat controlled the steam whistle, for the canoe lay in his track.\nDespite the warning, the man in the canoe made no effort to get out of\nhis way, and since both were going with the current, it was only by\nputting the wheel over and scraping a sandbank that the steamer missed\nsinking the smaller craft.\n\n\"Bring that man on board!\" fumed Sanders, and when the canoe had been\nunceremoniously hauled to the _Zaire's_ side by a boat-hook, and the\noccupant rudely pulled on board, Sanders let himself go.\n\n\"By your infernal laziness,\" he said, \"I see that you are of the Akasava\npeople; yet that is no reason why you should take the middle of the\nchannel to yourself.\"\n\n\"Lord, it is written in the books of your gods,\" said the man, \"that the\nriver is for us all, black and white, each being equal in the eyes of\nthe white gods.\"\n\nSanders checked his lips impatiently.\n\n\"When you and I are dead,\" he said, \"we shall be equal, but since I am\nquick and you are quick, I shall give you ten strokes with a whip to\ncorrect the evil teaching that is within you.\"\n\nHe made a convert.\n\nBut the mischief was done.\n\nSanders knew the native mind much better than any man living, and he\nspent a certain period every day for the next month cursing the Reverend\nKenneth McDolan. So far, however, no irreparable mischief had been done,\nbut Sanders was not the kind of man to be caught napping. Into the\nfarthermost corners of his little kingdom his secret-service men were\ndispatched, and Sanders sat down to await developments.\n\nAt first the news was good; the spies sent back stories of peace, of\nnormal happiness; then the reports became less satisfactory. The Akasava\ncountry is unfortunately placed, for it is the very centre territory,\nthe ideal position for the dissemination of foolish propaganda, as\nSanders had discovered before.\n\nThe stories the spies sent or brought were of secret meetings, of envoys\nfrom tribe to tribe, envoys that stole out from villages by dead of\nnight, of curious rites performed in the depth of the forest and other\ndisturbing matters.\n\nThen came a climax.\n\nTigili, the king of the N'Gombi folk, made preparations for a secret\njourney. He sacrificed a goat and secured good omens; likewise three\nwitch-doctors in solemn conclave gave a favourable prophecy.\n\nThe chief slipped down the river one night with fourteen paddlers, a\ndrummer, his chief headsman, and two of his wives, and reached the\nAkasava city at sunset the next evening. Here the chief of the Akasava\nmet him, and led him to his hut.\n\n\"Brother,\" said the Akasava chief, not without a touch of pompousness,\n\"I have covered my bow with the skin of a monkey.\"\n\nTigili nodded gravely.\n\n\"My arrows are winged with the little clouds,\" he said in reply.\n\nIn this cryptic fashion they spoke for the greater part of an hour, and\nderived much profit therefrom.\n\nIn the shadow of the hut without lay a half-naked man, who seemed to\nsleep, his head upon his arm, his legs doubled up comfortably.\n\nOne of the Akasava guard saw him, and sought to arouse him with the butt\nof his spear, but he only stirred sleepily, and, thinking that he must\nbe a man of Tigili's retinue, they left him.\n\nWhen the king and the chief had finished their palaver, Tigili rose from\nthe floor of the hut and went back to his canoe, and the chief of the\nAkasava stood on the bank of the river watching the craft as it went\nback the way it had come.\n\nThe sleeper rose noiselessly and took another path to the river. Just\noutside the town he had to cross a path of moonlit clearing, and a man\nchallenged him.\n\nThis man was an Akasava warrior, and was armed, and the sleeper stood\nobedient to the summons.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I am a stranger,\" said the man.\n\nThe warrior came nearer and looked in his face.\n\n\"You are a spy of Sandi,\" he said, and then the other closed with him.\n\nThe warrior would have shouted, but a hand like steel was on his throat.\nThe sentinel made a little sound like the noise a small river makes when\nit crosses a shallow bed of shingle, then his legs bent limply, and he\nwent down.\n\nThe sleeper bent down over him, wiped his knife on the bare shoulder of\nthe dead man, and went on his way to the river. Under the bush he found\na canoe, untied the native rope that fastened it, and stepping in, he\nsent the tiny dug-out down the stream.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n\"And what do you make of all this?\" asked Sanders. He was standing on\nhis broad stoep, and before him was the spy, a lithe young man, in the\nuniform of a sergeant of Houssa Police.\n\n\"Master, it is the secret society, and they go to make a great killing,\"\nsaid the sergeant.\n\nThe Commissioner paced the verandah with his head upon his breast, his\nhands clasped behind his back.\n\nThese secret societies he knew well enough, though his territories had\nbeen free of them. He knew their mushroom growth; how they rose from\nnothingness with rituals and practices ready-made. He knew their\ninfluence up and down the Liberian coast; he had some knowledge of the\n\"silent ones\" of Nigeria, and had met the \"white faces\" in the Kassai.\nAnd now the curse had come to his territory. It meant war, the upsetting\nof twenty years' work--the work of men who died and died joyfully, in\nthe faith that they had brought peace to the land--it meant the\nundermining of all his authority.\n\nHe turned to Abiboo.\n\n\"Take the steamer,\" he said, \"and go quickly to the Ochori country,\ntelling Bosambo, the chief, that I will come to him--the palaver is\nfinished.\" He knew he could depend upon Bosambo if the worst came.\n\nIn the days of waiting he sent a long message to the Administration,\nwhich lived in ease a hundred miles down the coast. He had a land wire\nrunning along the seashore, and when it worked it was a great blessing.\nFortunately it was in good order now, but there had been times when\nwandering droves of elephants had pulled up the poles and twisted a mile\nor so of wire into a hopeless tangle.\n\nThe reply to his message came quickly.\n\n    \"Take extreme steps to wipe out society. If necessary arrest\n    Tigili. I will support you with four hundred men and a gunboat;\n    prefer you should arrange the matter without fuss.\n\n      \"Administration.\"\n\nSanders took a long walk by the sea to think out the situation and the\nsolution. If the people were preparing for war, there would be\nsimultaneous action, a general rising. He shook his head. Four hundred\nmen and a gunboat more or less would make no difference. There was a\nhope that one tribe would rise before the other; he could deal with the\nAkasava; he could deal with the Isisi plus the Akasava; he was sure of\nthe Ochori--that was a comfort--but the others? He shook his head again.\nPerhaps the inherent idleness of the Akasava would keep them back. Such\na possibility was against their traditions.\n\nHe must have come upon a solution suddenly, for he stopped dead in his\nwalk, and stood still, thinking profoundly, with his head upon his\nbreast. Then he turned and walked quickly back to his bungalow.\n\nWhat date had been chosen for the rising we may never know for certain.\nWhat is known is that the Akasava, the N'Gombi, the Isisi, and the\nBoleki folk were preparing in secret for a time of killing, when there\ncame the great news.\n\nSandi was dead.\n\nA canoe had overturned on the Isisi River, and the swift current had\nswept the Commissioner away, and though men ran up and down the bank no\nother sign of him was visible but a great white helmet that floated,\nturning slowly, out of sight.\n\nSo a man of the Akasava reported, having learnt it from a sergeant of\nHoussas, and instantly the _lo-koli_ beat sharply, and the headmen of\nthe villages came panting to the palaver house to meet the paramount\nchief of the Akasava.\n\n\"Sandi is dead,\" said the chief solemnly. \"He was our father and our\nmother and carried us in his arms; we loved him and did many\ndisagreeable things for him because of our love. But now that he is\ndead, and there is none to say 'Yea' or 'Nay' to us, the time of which I\nhave spoken to you secretly has come; therefore let us take up our arms\nand go out, first against the God-men who pray and bewitch us with the\nsprinkling of water, then against the chief of the Ochori, who for many\nyears have put shame upon us.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said a little chief from the fishing village which is near to\nthe Ochori border, \"is it wise--our Lord Sandi having said there shall\nbe no war?\"\n\n\"Our Lord Sandi is dead,\" said the paramount chief wisely; \"and being\ndead, it does not greatly concern us what he said; besides which,\" he\nsaid, as a thought struck him, \"last night I had a dream and saw Sandi;\nhe was standing amidst great fires, and he said, 'Go forth and bring me\nthe head of the chief of the Ochori.'\"\n\nNo further time was wasted.\n\nThat night the men of twenty villages danced the dance of killing, and\nthe great fire of the Akasava burnt redly on the sandy beach to the\nembarrassment of a hippo family that lived in the high grasses near by.\n\nIn the grey of the morning the Akasava chief mustered six hundred spears\nand three score of canoes, and he delivered his oration:\n\n\"First, we will destroy the mission men, for they are white, and it is\nnot right that they should live and Sandi be dead; then we will go\nagainst Bosambo, the chief of the Ochori. When rains came in the time of\nkidding, he who is a foreigner and of no human origin brought many evil\npersons with him and destroyed our fishing villages, and Sandi said\nthere should be no killing. Now Sandi is dead, and, I do not doubt, in\nhell, and there is none to hold our pride.\"\n\nRound the bend of the river, ever so slowly, for she was breasting a\nstrong and treacherous current, came the nose of the _Zaire_. It is\nworthy of note that the little blue flag at her stern was not at\nhalf-mast. The exact significance of this was lost on the Akasava.\nGingerly the little craft felt its way to the sandy strip of beach, a\nplank was thrust forth, and along it came, very dapper and white, his\nlittle ebony stick with the silver knob swinging between his fingers,\nMr. Commissioner Sanders, very much alive, and there were two bright\nMaxim-guns on either side of the gangway that covered the beach.\n\nA nation, paralysed by fear and apprehension, watched the\n_debarquement_, the chief of the Akasava being a little in advance of\nhis painted warriors.\n\nOn Sanders' face was a look of innocent surprise. \"Chief,\" said he, \"you\ndo me great honour that you gather your young men to welcome me;\nnevertheless, I would rather see them working in their gardens.\"\n\nHe walked along one row of fighting men, plentifully besmeared with\ncam-wood, and his was the leisurely step of some great personage\ninspecting a guard of honour.\n\n\"I perceive,\" he went on, talking over his shoulder to the chief who,\nfascinated by the unexpected vision, followed him, \"I perceive that each\nman has a killing spear, also a fighting shield of wicker work, and many\nhave N'Gombi swords.\"\n\n\"Lord, it is true,\" said the chief, recovering his wits, \"for we go\nhunting elephant in the Great Forest.\"\n\n\"Also that some have the little bones of men fastened about their\nnecks--that is not for the elephant.\"\n\nHe said this meditatively, musingly, as he continued his inspection, and\nthe chief was frankly embarrassed.\n\n\"There is a rumour,\" he stammered, \"it is said--there came a spy who\ntold us--that the Ochori were gathering for war, and we were afraid----\"\n\n\"Strange,\" said Sanders, half to himself, but speaking in the\nvernacular, \"strange indeed is this story, for I have come straight from\nthe Ochori city, and there I saw nothing but men who ground corn and\nhunted peacefully; also their chief is ill, suffering from a fever.\"\n\nHe shook his head in well-simulated bewilderment.\n\n\"Lord,\" said the poor chief of the Akasava, \"perhaps men have told us\nlies--such things have happened----\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Sanders gravely. \"This is a country of lies; some\nsay that I am dead; and, lo! the news has gone around that there is no\nlaw in the land, and men may kill and war at their good pleasure.\"\n\n\"Though I die at this minute,\" said the chief virtuously, \"though the\nriver turn to fire and consume my inmost stomach, though every tree\nbecome a tiger to devour me, I have not dreamt of war.\"\n\nSanders grinned internally.\n\n\"Spare your breath,\" he said gently. \"You who go hunting elephants, for\nit is a long journey to the Great Forest, and there are many swamps to\nbe crossed, many rivers to be swum. My heart is glad that I have come in\ntime to bid you farewell.\"\n\nThere was a most impressive silence, for this killing of elephants was a\nstray excuse of the chief's. The Great Forest is a journey of two\nmonths, one to get there and one to return, and is moreover through the\nmost cursed country, and the Akasava are not a people that love long\njourneys save with the current of the river.\n\nThe silence was broken by the chief.\n\n\"Lord, we desire to put off our journey in your honour, for if we go,\nhow shall we gather in palaver?\"\n\nSanders shook his head.\n\n\"Let no man stop the hunter,\" quoth he. \"Go in peace, chief, and you\nshall secure many teeth.\"[3] He saw a sudden light come to the chief's\neyes, but continued, \"I will send with you a sergeant of Houssas, that\nhe may carry back to me the story of your prowess\"--the light died away\nagain--\"for there will be many liars who will say that you never reached\nthe Great Forest, and I shall have evidence to confound them.\"\n\nStill the chief hesitated, and the waiting ranks listened, eagerly\nshuffling forward, till they ceased to bear any semblance to an ordered\narmy, and were as a mob.\n\n\"Lord,\" said the chief, \"we will go to-morrow----\"\n\nThe smile was still on Sanders' lips, but his face was set, and his eyes\nheld a steely glitter that the chief of the Akasava knew.\n\n\"You go to-day, my man,\" said Sanders, lowering his voice till he spoke\nin little more than a whisper, \"else your warriors march under a new\nchief, and you swing on a tree.\"\n\n\"Lord, we go,\" said the man huskily, \"though we are bad marchers and our\nfeet are very tender.\"\n\nSanders, remembering the weariness of the Akasava, found his face\ntwitching.\n\n\"With sore feet you may rest,\" he said significantly; \"with sore backs\nyou can neither march nor rest--go!\"\n\nAt dawn the next morning the N'Gombi people came in twenty-five war\ncanoes to join their Akasava friends, and found the village tenanted by\nwomen and old men, and Tigili, the king, in the shock of the discovery,\nsurrendered quietly to the little party of Houssas on the beach.\n\n\"What comes to me, lord?\" asked Tigili, the king.\n\nSanders whistled thoughtfully.\n\n\"I have some instructions about you somewhere,\" he said.\n\n[Footnote 3: Tusks.]\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER IX.\n\n  THE WOOD OF DEVILS.\n\n\nFour days out of M'Sakidanga, if native report be true, there is a\ntrickling stream that meanders down from N'Gombi country. Native report\nsays that this is navigable even in the dry season.\n\nThe missionaries at Bonginda ridicule this report; and Arburt, the young\nchief of the station, with a gentle laugh in his blue eyes, listened one\nday to the report of Elebi about a fabulous land at the end of this\nriver, and was kindly incredulous.\n\n\"If it be that ivory is stored in this place,\" he said in the\nvernacular, \"or great wealth lies for the lifting, go to Sandi, for this\nivory belongs to the Government. But do you, Elebi, fix your heart more\nupon God's treasures in heaven, and your thoughts upon your unworthiness\nto merit a place in His kingdom, and let the ivory go.\"\n\nElebi was known to Sanders as a native evangelist of the tornado type, a\nthunderous, voluble sub-minister of the service; he had, in his ecstatic\nmoments, made many converts. But there were days of reaction, when Elebi\nsulked in his mud hut, and reviewed Christianity calmly.\n\nIt was a service, this new religion. You could not work yourself to a\nfrenzy in it, and then have done with the thing for a week. You must\nneeds go on, on, never tiring, never departing from the straight path,\nexercising irksome self-restraint, leaving undone that which you would\nrather do.\n\n\"Religion is prison,\" grumbled Elebi, after his interview, and shrugged\nhis broad, black shoulders.\n\nIn his hut he was in the habit of discarding his European coat for the\nloin cloth and the blanket, for Elebi was a savage--an imitative\nsavage--but still barbarian. Once, preaching on the River of Devils, he\nhad worked himself up to such a pitch of enthusiastic fervour that he\nhad smitten a scoffer, breaking his arm, and an outraged Sanders had him\narrested, whipped, and fined a thousand rods. Hereafter Elebi had\nfigured in certain English missionary circles as a Christian martyr, for\nhe had lied magnificently, and his punishment had been represented as a\nform of savage persecution.\n\nBut the ivory lay buried three days' march beyond the Secret River; thus\nElebi brooded over the log that smouldered in his hut day and night.\nThree days beyond the river, branching off at a place where there were\ntwo graves, the country was reputably full of devils, and Elebi\nshuddered at the thought; but, being a missionary and a lay evangelist,\nand, moreover, the proud possessor of a copy of the Epistle to the\nRomans (laboriously rendered into the native tongue), he had little to\nfear. He had more to fear from a certain White Devil at a far-away\nheadquarters, who might be expected to range the lands of the Secret\nRiver, when the rains had come and gone.\n\nIt was supposed that Elebi had one wife, conforming to the custom of the\nwhite man, but the girl who came into the hut with a steaming bowl of\nfish in her hands was not the wife that the missionaries recognised as\nsuch.\n\n\"Sikini,\" he said, \"I am going a journey by canoe.\"\n\n\"In the blessed service?\" asked Sikini, who had come under the influence\nof the man in his more elated periods.\n\n\"The crackling of a fire is like a woman's tongue,\" quoted Elebi; \"and\nit is easier to keep the lid on a boiling pot than a secret in a woman's\nheart.\"\n\nElebi had the river proverbs at his finger-tips, and the girl laughed,\nfor she was his favourite wife, and knew that in course of time the\ninformation would come to her.\n\n\"Sikini,\" said the man suddenly, \"you know that I have kept you when the\nBlood Taker would have me put you away.\"\n\n(Arburt had a microscope and spent his evenings searching the blood of\nhis flock for signs of trynosomiasis.)\n\n\"You know that for your sake I lied to him who is my father and my\nprotector, saying: 'There shall be but one wife in my house, and that\nTombolo, the coast woman.'\"\n\nThe girl nodded, eyeing him stolidly.\n\n\"Therefore I tell you that I am going beyond the Secret River, three\ndays' march, leaving the canoe at a place where there are two graves.\"\n\n\"What do you seek?\" she asked.\n\n\"There are many teeth in that country,\" he said; \"dead ivory that the\npeople brought with them from a distant country, and have hidden,\nfearing one who is a Breaker of Stones.[4] I shall come back rich, and\nbuy many wives who shall wait upon you and serve you, and then I will no\nlonger be Christian, but will worship the red fetish as my father did,\nand his father.\"\n\n\"Go,\" she said, nodding thoughtfully.\n\nHe told her many things that he had not revealed to Arburt--of how the\nivory came, of the people who guarded it, of the means by which he\nintended to secure it.\n\nNext morning before the mission _lo-koli_ sounded, he had slipped away\nin his canoe; and Arburt, when the news came to him, sighed and called\nhim a disappointing beggar--for Arburt was human. Sanders, who was also\nhuman, sent swift messengers to arrest Elebi, for it is not a good thing\nthat treasure-hunting natives should go wandering through a strange\ncountry, such excursions meaning war, and war meaning, to Sanders at any\nrate, solemn official correspondence, which his soul loathed.\n\nWho would follow the fortunes of Elebi must paddle in his wake as far as\nOkau, where the Barina meets the Lapoi, must take the left river path,\npast the silent pool of the White Devil, must follow the winding stream\ntill the elephants' playing ground be reached. Here the forest has been\ndestroyed for the sport of the Great Ones; the shore is strewn with tree\ntrunks, carelessly uprooted and as carelessly tossed aside by the\ngambolling mammoth. The ground is innocent of herbage or bush; it is a\nflat wallow of mud, with the marks of pads where the elephant has\npassed.\n\nElebi drew his canoe up the bank, carefully lifted his cooking-pot, full\nof living fire, and emptied its contents, heaping thereon fresh twigs\nand scraps of dead wood. Then he made himself a feast, and went to\nsleep.\n\nA wandering panther came snuffling and howling in the night, and Elebi\nrose and replenished the fire. In the morning he sought for the creek\nthat led to the Secret River, and found it hidden by the hippo grass.\n\nElebi had many friends in the N'Gombi country. They were gathered in the\nvillage of Tambango--to the infinite embarrassment of the chief of that\nvillage--for Elebi's friends laid hands upon whatsoever they desired,\nbeing strangers and well armed, and, moreover, outnumbering the men of\nthe village three to one. One, O'Sako, did the chief hold in greatest\ndread, for he said little, but stalked tragically through the untidy\nstreet of Tambango, a bright, curved execution knife in the crook of his\nleft arm. O'Sako was tall and handsome. One broad shoulder gleamed in\nits nakedness, and his muscular arms were devoid of ornamentation. His\nthick hair was plastered with clay till it was like a European woman's,\nand his body was smeared with ingola dust.\n\nOnce only he condescended to address his host.\n\n\"You shall find me three young men against the Lord Elebi's arrival, and\nthey shall lead us to the land of the Secret River.\"\n\n\"But, master,\" pleaded the chief, \"no man may go to the Secret River,\nbecause of the devils.\"\n\n\"Three men,\" said O'Sako softly; \"three young men swift of foot, with\neyes like the N'Gombi, and mouths silent as the dead.\"\n\n\"---- the devils,\" repeated the chief weakly, but O'Sako stared straight\nahead and strode on.\n\nWhen the sun blazed furiously on the rim of the world in a last expiring\neffort, and the broad river was a flood of fire, and long shadows ran\nthrough the clearings, Elebi came to the village. He came unattended\nfrom the south, and he brought with him no evidence of his temporary\nsojourn in the camps of civilisation. Save for his loin cloth, and his\nrobe of panther skin thrown about his shoulders, he was naked.\n\nThere was a palaver house at the end of the village, a thatched little\nwattle hut perched on a tiny hill, and the Lord Elebi gathered there his\ncaptains and the chief of the village. He made a speech.\n\n\"_Cala, cala_,\" he began--and it means \"long ago,\" and is a famous\nopening to speeches--\"before the white man came, and when the Arabi came\ndown from the northern countries to steal women and ivory, the people of\nthe Secret River buried their 'points' in a Place of Devils. Their women\nthey could not bury, so they lost them. Now all the people of the Secret\nRiver are dead. The Arabi killed some, Bula Matadi killed others, but\nthe sickness killed most of all. Where their villages were the high\ngrass has grown, and in their gardens only the weaver bird speaks. Yet I\nknow of this place, for there came to me a vision and a voice that\nsaid----\"\n\nThe rest of the speech from the European standpoint was pure blasphemy,\nbecause Elebi had had the training of a lay preacher, and had an easy\ndelivery.\n\nWhen he had finished, the chief of the village of Tambangu spoke. It was\na serious discourse on devils. There was no doubt at all that in the\nforest where the _cach_ was there was a veritable stronghold of\ndevildom. Some had bad faces and were as tall as the gum-trees--taller,\nfor they used whole trees for clubs; some were small, so small that they\ntravelled on the wings of bees, but all were very potent, very terrible,\nand most effective guardians of buried treasure. Their greatest\naccomplishment lay in leading astray the traveller: men went into the\nforest in search of game or copal or rubber, and never came back,\nbecause there were a thousand ways in and no way out.\n\nElebi listened gravely.\n\n\"Devils of course there are,\" he said, \"including the Devil, the Old\nOne, who is the enemy of God. I have had much to do with the casting out\nof devils--in my holy capacity as a servant of the Word. Of the lesser\ndevils I know nothing, though I do not doubt they live. Therefore I\nthink it would be better for all if we offered prayer.\"\n\nOn his instruction the party knelt in full view of the village, and\nElebi prayed conventionally but with great earnestness that the Powers\nof Darkness should not prevail, but that the Great Work should go on\ntriumphantly.\n\nAfter which, to make doubly sure, the party sacrificed two fowls before\na squat _bete_ that stood before the chief's door, and a crazy\nwitch-doctor anointed Elebi with human fat.\n\n\"We will go by way of Ochori,\" said Elebi, who was something of a\nstrategist. \"These Ochori folk will give us food and guides, being a\ncowardly folk and very fearful.\"\n\nHe took farewell of the old chief and continued his journey, with O'Sako\nand his warriors behind him. So two days passed. An hour's distance from\nthe city of the Ochori he called a conference.\n\n\"Knowing the world,\" he said, \"I am acquainted with the Ochori, who are\nslaves: you shall behold their chief embrace my feet. Since it is\nfitting that one, such as I, who know the ways of white men and their\nmagic, should be received with honour; let us send forward a messenger\nto say that the Lord Elebi comes, and bid them kill so many goats\nagainst our coming.\"\n\n\"That is good talk,\" said O'Sako, his lieutenant, and a messenger was\ndespatched.\n\nElebi with his caravan followed slowly.\n\nIt is said that Elebi's message came to Bosambo of Monrovia, chief of\nthe Ochori, when he was in the despondent mood peculiar to men of action\nwho find life running too smoothly.\n\nIt was Bosambo's practice--and one of which his people stood in some\nawe--to reflect aloud in English in all moments of crisis, or on any\noccasion when it was undesirable that his thoughts should be conveyed\nabroad.\n\nHe listened in silence, sitting before the door of his hut and smoking a\nshort wooden pipe, whilst the messenger described the quality of the\ncoming visitor, and the unparalleled honour which was to fall upon the\nOchori.\n\nSaid Bosambo at the conclusion of the recital, \"Damn nigger.\"\n\nThe messenger was puzzled by the strange tongue.\n\n\"Lord Chief,\" he said, \"my master is a great one, knowing the ways of\nwhite men.\"\n\n\"I also know something of white men,\" said Bosambo calmly, in the River\ndialect, \"having many friends, including Sandi, who married my brother's\nwife's sister, and is related to me. Also,\" said Bosambo daringly, \"I\nhave shaken hands with the Great White King who dwells beyond the big\nwater, and he has given me many presents.\"\n\nWith this story the messenger went back to the slowly advancing caravan,\nand Elebi was impressed and a little bewildered.\n\n\"It is strange,\" he said, \"no man has ever known an Ochori chief who was\naught but a dog and the son of a dog--let us see this Bosambo. Did you\ntell him to come out and meet me?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the messenger frankly, \"he was such a great one, and was\nso haughty because of Sandi, who married his brother's wife's sister;\nand so proud that I did not dare tell him.\"\n\nThere is a spot on the edge of the Ochori city where at one time Sanders\nhad caused to be erected a warning sign, and here Elebi found the chief\nwaiting and was flattered. There was a long and earnest conference in\nthe little palaver house of the city, and here Elebi told as much of his\nstory as was necessary, and Bosambo believed as much as he could.\n\n\"And what do you need of me and my people?\" asked Bosambo at length.\n\n\"Lord chief,\" said Elebi, \"I go a long journey, being fortified with the\nblessed spirit of which you know nothing, that being an especial mystery\nof the white men.\"\n\n\"There is no mystery which I did not know,\" said Bosambo loftily, \"and\nif you speak of spirits, I will speak of certain saints, also of a\nVirgin who is held in high respect by white men.\"\n\n\"If you speak of the blessed Paul----\" began Elebi, a little at sea.\n\n\"Not only of Paul but Peter, John, Luke, Matthew, Antonio, and Thomas,\"\nrecited Bosambo rapidly. He had not been a scholar at the Catholic\nmission for nothing. Elebi was nonplussed.\n\n\"We will let these magic matters rest,\" said Elebi wisely; \"it is\nevident to me that you are a learned man. Now I go to seek some\nwonderful treasures. All that I told you before was a lie. Let us speak\nas brothers. I go to the wood of devils, where no man has been for many\nyears. I beg you, therefore, to give me food and ten men for carriers.\"\n\n\"Food you can have but no men,\" said Bosambo, \"for I have pledged my\nword to Sandi, who is, as you know, the husband of my brother's wife's\nsister, that no man of mine should leave this country.\"\n\nWith this Elebi had to be content, for a new spirit had come to the\nOchori since he had seen them last, and there was a defiance in the\ntimid eyes of these slaves of other days which was disturbing. Besides,\nthey seemed well armed.\n\nIn the morning the party set forth and Bosambo, who took no risks, saw\nthem started on their journey. He observed that part of the equipment of\nthe little caravan were two big baskets filled to the brim with narrow\nstrips of red cloth.\n\n\"This is my magic,\" said Elebi mysteriously, when he was questioned, \"it\nis fitting that you should know its power.\"\n\nBosambo yawned in his face with great insolence.\n\nClear of Ochori by one day's march, the party reached the first\nstraggling advance guard of the Big Forest. A cloud of gum-trees formed\nthe approach to the wood, and here the magic of Elebi's basket of cloth\nstrips became revealed.\n\nEvery few hundred yards the party stopped, and Elebi tied one of the\nstrips to a branch of a tree.\n\n\"In this way,\" he communicated to his lieutenant, \"we may be independent\nof gods, and fearless of devils, for if we cannot find the ivory we can\nat least find our way back again.\"\n\n(There had been such an experiment made by the missionaries in\ntraversing the country between Bonguidga and the Big River, but there\nwere no devils in that country.)\n\nIn two days' marches they came upon a place of graves. There had been a\nvillage there, for Isisi palms grew luxuriously, and pushing aside the\ngrass they came upon a rotting roof. Also there were millions of weaver\nbirds in the nut-palms, and a choked banana grove.\n\nThe graves, covered with broken cooking pots, Elebi found, and was\nsatisfied.\n\nIn the forest, a league beyond the dead village, they came upon an old\nman, so old that you might have lifted him with a finger and thumb.\n\n\"Where do the young men go in their strength?\" he mumbled childishly;\n\"into the land of small devils? Who shall guide them back to their\nwomen? None, for the devils will confuse them, opening new roads and\nclosing the old. Oh, Ko Ko!\"\n\nHe snivelled miserably.\n\n\"Father,\" said Elebi, dangling strips of red flannel from his hand,\n\"this is white man's magic, we come back by the way we go.\"\n\nThen the old man fell into an insane fit of cursing, and threw at them a\nthousand deaths, and Elebi's followers huddled back in frowning fear.\n\n\"You have lived too long,\" said Elebi gently, and passed his spear\nthrough the old man's neck.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nThey found the ivory two days' journey beyond the place of killing. It\nwas buried under a mound, which was overgrown with rank vegetation, and\nthere was by European calculation some 50,000 worth.\n\n\"We will go back and find carriers,\" said Elebi, \"taking with us as many\nof the teeth as we can carry.\"\n\nTwo hours later the party began its return journey, following the path\nwhere at intervals of every half-mile a strip of scarlet flannelette\nhung from a twig.\n\nThere were many paths they might have taken, paths that looked as though\nthey had been made by the hand of man, and Elebi was glad that he had\nblazed the way to safety.\n\nFor eight hours the caravan moved swiftly, finding its direction with no\ndifficulty; then the party halted for the night.\n\nElebi was awakened in the night by a man who was screaming, and he leapt\nup, stirring the fire to a blaze.\n\n\"It is the brother of Olambo of Kinshassa, he has the sickness _mongo_,\"\nsaid an awe-stricken voice, and Elebi called a council.\n\n\"There are many ways by which white men deal with this sickness,\" he\nsaid wisely, \"by giving certain powders and by sticking needles into\narms, but to give medicine for the sickness when madness comes is\nuseless--so I have heard the fathers at the station say, because madness\nonly comes when the man is near death.\"\n\n\"He was well last night,\" said a hushed voice. \"There are many devils in\nthe forest, let us ask him what he has seen.\"\n\nSo a deputation went to the screaming, writhing figure that lay trussed\nand tied on the ground, and spoke with him. They found some difficulty\nin gaining an opening, for he jabbered and mouthed and laughed and\nyelled incessantly.\n\n\"On the question of devils,\" at last Elebi said.\n\n\"Devils,\" screeched the madman. \"Yi! I saw six devils with fire in their\nmouths--death to you, Elebi! Dog----\"\n\nHe said other things which were not clean.\n\n\"If there were water here,\" mused Elebi, \"we might drown him; since\nthere is only the forest and the earth, carry him away from the camp,\nand I will make him silent.\"\n\nSo they carried the lunatic away, eight strong men swaying through the\nforest, and they came back, leaving Elebi alone with his patient. The\ncries ceased suddenly and Elebi returned, wiping his hands on his\nleopard skin.\n\n\"Let us sleep,\" said Elebi, and lay down.\n\nBefore the dawn came up the party were on the move.\n\nThey marched less than a mile from their camping ground and then\nfaltered and stopped.\n\n\"There is no sign, lord,\" the leader reported, and Elebi called him a\nfool and went to investigate.\n\nBut there was no red flannel, not a sign of it. They went on another\nmile without success.\n\n\"We have taken the wrong path, let us return,\" said Elebi, and the party\nretraced its steps to the camp they had abandoned. That day was spent in\nexploring the country for three miles on either side, but there was no\nwelcome blaze to show the trail.\n\n\"We are all N'Gombi men,\" said Elebi, \"let us to-morrow go forward,\nkeeping the sun at our back; the forest has no terrors for the N'Gombi\nfolk--yet I cannot understand why the white man's magic failed.\"\n\n\"Devils!\" muttered his lieutenant sullenly.\n\nElebi eyed him thoughtfully.\n\n\"Devils sometimes desire sacrifices,\" he said with significance, \"the\nwise goat does not bleat when the priest approaches the herd.\"\n\nIn the morning a great discovery was made. A crumpled piece of flannel\nwas found on the outskirts of the camp. It lay in the very centre of a\npath, and Elebi shouted in his joy.\n\nAgain the caravan started on the path. A mile farther along another\nlittle red patch caught his eye, half a mile beyond, another.\n\nYet none of these were where he had placed them, and they all bore\nevidence of rude handling, which puzzled the lay brother sorely.\nSometimes the little rags would be missing altogether, but a search\nparty would come upon one some distance off the track, and the march\nwould go on.\n\nNear sunset Elebi halted suddenly and pondered. Before him ran his long\nshadow; the sun was behind him when it ought to have been in front.\n\n\"We are going in the wrong direction,\" he said, and the men dropped\ntheir loads and stared at him.\n\n\"Beyond any doubt,\" said Elebi after a pause, \"this is the work of\ndevils--let us pray.\"\n\nHe prayed aloud earnestly for twenty minutes, and darkness had fallen\nbefore he had finished.\n\nThey camped that night on the spot where the last red guide was, and in\nthe morning they returned the way they had come. There was plenty of\nprovision, but water was hard to come by, and therein lay the danger.\nLess than a mile they had gone before the red rags had vanished\ncompletely, and they wandered helplessly in a circle.\n\n\"This is evidently a matter not for prayer, but for sacrifice,\"\nconcluded Elebi, so they slew one of the guides.\n\nThree nights later, O'Sako, the friend of Elebi, crawled stealthily to\nthe place where Elebi was sleeping, and settled the dispute which had\narisen during the day as to who was in command of the expedition.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n\"Master,\" said Bosambo of Monrovia, \"all that you ordered me to do, that\nI did.\"\n\nSanders sat before the chief's hut in his camp chair and nodded.\n\n\"When your word came that I should find Elebi--he being an enemy of the\nGovernment and disobeying your word--I took fifty of my young men and\nfollowed on his tracks. At first the way was easy, because he had tied\nstrips of cloth to the trees to guide him on the backward journey, but\nafterwards it was hard, for the _N'Kema_ that live in the wood----\"\n\n\"Monkeys?\" Sanders raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Monkeys, master,\" Bosambo nodded his head, \"the little black monkeys of\nthe forest who love bright colours--they had come down from their trees\nand torn away the cloths and taken them to their houses after the\nfashion of the monkey people. Thus Elebi lost himself and with him his\nmen, for I found their bones, knowing the way of the forest.\"\n\n\"What else did you find?\" asked Sanders.\n\n\"Nothing, master,\" said Bosambo, looking him straight in the eye.\n\n\"That is probably a lie!\" said Sanders.\n\nBosambo thought of the ivory buried beneath the floor of his hut and did\nnot contradict him.\n\n[Footnote 4: Bula Matidi, _i.e._, \"Stone Breaker,\" is the native name\nfor the Congo Government.]\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER X.\n\n  THE LOVES OF M'LINO.\n\n\nWhen a man loves one woman, whether she be alive or dead, a deep and\nfragrant memory or a very pleasant reality, he is apt to earn the\nappellation of \"woman-hater,\" a hasty judgment which the loose-minded\npass upon any man whose loves lack promiscuosity, and who does not\ndiffuse his passions. Sanders was described as a woman-hater by such men\nwho knew him sufficiently little to analyse his character, but Sanders\nwas not a woman-hater in any sense of the word, for he bore no illwill\ntoward woman kind, and certainly was innocent of any secret love.\n\nThere was a young man named Ludley who had been assistant to Sanders for\nthree months, at the end of which time Sanders sent for him--he was\nstationed at Isisi City.\n\n\"I think you can go home,\" said Sanders.\n\nThe young man opened his eyes in astonishment.\n\n\"Why?\" he said.\n\nSanders made no reply, but stared through the open doorway at the\ndistant village.\n\n\"Why?\" demanded the young man again.\n\n\"I've heard things,\" said Sanders shortly--he was rather uncomfortable,\nbut did not show it.\n\n\"Things--like what?\"\n\nSanders shifted uneasily in his chair.\n\n\"Oh--things,\" he said vaguely, and added: \"You go home and marry that\nnice girl you used to rave about when you first came out.\"\n\nYoung Ludley went red under his tan.\n\n\"Look here, chief!\" he said, half angrily, half apologetically, \"you're\nsurely not going to take any notice--you know it's the sort of thing\nthat's done in black countries--oh, damn it all, you're not going to act\nas censor over my morals, are you?\"\n\nSanders looked at the youth coldly.\n\n\"Your morals aren't worth worrying about,\" he said truthfully. \"You\ncould be the most depraved devil in the world--which I'll admit you\naren't--and I should not trouble to reform you. No. It's the morals of\nmy cannibals that worry me. Home you go, my son; get married, _crescit\nsub pondere virtus_--you'll find the translation in the foreign phrase\ndepartment of any respectable dictionary. As to the sort of things that\nare done in black countries, they don't do them in our black\ncountries--monkey tricks of that sort are good enough for the Belgian\nCongo, or for Togoland, but they aren't good enough for this little\nstrip of wilderness.\"\n\nLudley went home.\n\nHe did not tell anybody the real reason why he had come home, because it\nwould not have sounded nice. He was a fairly decent boy, as boys of his\ntype go, and he said nothing worse about Sanders than that he was a\nwoman-hater.\n\nThe scene that followed his departure shows how little the white mind\ndiffers from the black in its process of working. For, after seeing his\nassistant safely embarked on a homeward-bound boat, Sanders went up the\nriver to Isisi, and there saw a woman who was called M'Lino.\n\nThe average black woman is ugly of face, but beautiful of figure, but\nM'Lino was no ordinary woman, as you shall learn. The Isisi people, who\nkeep extraordinary records in their heads, the information being handed\nfrom father to son, say that M'Lino came from an Arabi family, and\ncertainly if a delicately-chiselled nose, a refinement of lip, prove\nanything, they prove M'Lino came from no pure Bantu stock.\n\nShe came to Sanders when he sent for her, alert, suspicious, very much\non her guard.\n\nBefore he could speak, she asked him a question.\n\n\"Lord, where is Lijingii?\" This was the nearest the native ever got to\nthe pronunciation of Ludley's name.\n\n\"Lijingii has gone across the black water,\" said Sanders gently, \"to his\nown people.\"\n\n\"You sent him, lord,\" she said quickly, and Sanders made no reply.\n\n\"Lord,\" she went on, and Sanders wondered at the bitterness in her tone,\n\"it is said that you hate women.\"\n\n\"Then a lie is told,\" said Sanders. \"I do not hate women; rather I\ngreatly honour them, for they go down to the caves of hell when they\nbear children; also I regard them highly because they are otherwise\nbrave and very loyal.\"\n\nShe said nothing. Her head was sunk till her chin rested on her bare,\nbrown breast, but she looked at him from under her brows, and her eyes\nwere filled with a strange luminosity. Something like a panic awoke in\nSanders' heart--had the mischief been done? He cursed Ludley, and\nbreathed a fervent, if malevolent, prayer that his ship would go down\nwith him. But her words reassured him.\n\n\"I made Lijingii love me,\" she said, \"though he was a great lord, and I\nwas a slave; I also would have gone down to hell, for some day I hoped I\nshould bear him children, but now that can never be.\"\n\n\"And thank the Lord for it!\" said Sanders, under his breath.\n\nHe would have given her some words of cheer, but she turned abruptly\nfrom him and walked away. Sanders watched the graceful figure as it\nreceded down the straggling street, and went back to his steamer.\n\nHe was ten miles down the river before he remembered that the reproof he\nhad framed for the girl had been undelivered.\n\n\"That is very extraordinary,\" said Sanders, with some annoyance, \"I must\nbe losing my memory.\"\n\nThree months later young Penson came out from England to take the place\nof the returned Ludley. He was a fresh-faced youth, bubbling over with\nenthusiasm, and, what is more important, he had served a two-years'\napprenticeship at Sierra Leone.\n\n\"You are to go up to Isisi,\" said Sanders, \"and I want to tell you that\nyou've got to be jolly careful.\"\n\n\"What's the racket?\" demanded the youth eagerly. \"Are the beggars\nrising?\"\n\n\"So far as I know,\" said Sanders, putting his feet up on the rail of the\nverandah, \"they are not--it is not bloodshed, but love that you've got\nto guard against.\"\n\nAnd he told the story of M'Lino, even though it was no creditable story\nto British administration.\n\n\"You can trust me,\" said young Penson, when he had finished.\n\n\"I trust you all right,\" said Sanders, \"but I don't trust the woman--let\nme hear from you from time to time; if you don't write about her I shall\nget suspicious, and I'll come along in a very unpleasant mood.\"\n\n\"You can trust me,\" said young Penson again; for he was at the age when\na man is very sure of himself.\n\nRemarkable as it may read, from the moment he left to take up his new\npost until he returned to headquarters, in disgrace, a few months later,\nhe wrote no word of the straight, slim girl, with her wonderful eyes.\nOther communications came to hand, official reports, terse and to the\npoint, but no mention of M'Lino, and Sanders began to worry.\n\nThe stories came filtering through, extraordinary stories of people who\nhad been punished unjustly, of savage floggings administered by order of\nthe sub-commissioner, and Sanders took boat and travelled up the river\n_hec dum_.\n\nHe landed short of the town, and walked along the river bank. It was not\nan easy walk, because the country hereabouts is a riot of vegetation.\nThen he came upon an African idyll--a young man, who sat playing on a\nsqueaky violin, for the pleasure of M'Lino, lying face downwards on the\ngrass, her chin in her hands.\n\n\"In the name of a thousand devils!\" said Sanders wrathfully; and the boy\ngot up from the fallen tree on which he sat, and looked at him calmly,\nand with no apparent embarrassment. Sanders looked down at the girl and\npointed.\n\n\"Go back to the village, my woman,\" he said softly, for he was in a\nrage.\n\n\"Now, you magnificent specimen of a white man,\" he said, when the girl\nhad gone--slowly and reluctantly--\"what is this story I hear about your\nflogging O'Sako?\"\n\nThe youth took his pipe from his pocket and lit it coolly.\n\n\"He beat M'Lino,\" he said, in the tone of one who offered full\njustification.\n\n\"From which fact I gather that he is the unfortunate husband of that\nattractive nigger lady you were charming just now when I arrived?\"\n\n\"Don't be beastly,\" said the other, scowling. \"I know she's a native and\nall that sort of thing, but my people at home will get used to her\ncolour----\"\n\n\"Go on board my boat,\" said Sanders quietly. \"Regard yourself as my\nprisoner.\"\n\nSanders brought him down to headquarters without troubling to\ninvestigate the flogging of O'Sako, and no word passed concerning M'Lino\ntill they were back again at headquarters.\n\n\"Of course I shall send you home,\" said Sanders.\n\n\"I supposed you would,\" said the other listlessly. He had lost all his\nself-assurance on the journey down river, and was a very depressed young\nman indeed.\n\n\"I must have been mad,\" he admitted, the day before the mail boat called\n_en route_ for England; \"from the very first I loved her--good heavens,\nwhat an ass I am!\"\n\n\"You are,\" agreed Sanders, and saw him off to the ship with a cheerful\nheart.\n\n\"I will have no more sub-commissioners at Isisi,\" he wrote acidly to the\nAdministration. \"I find my work sufficiently entertaining without the\nadditional amusement of having to act as chaperon to British officials.\"\n\nHe made a special journey to Isisi to straighten matters out, and M'Lino\ncame unbidden to see him.\n\n\"Lord, is he gone, too?\" she asked.\n\n\"When I want you, M'Lino,\" said Sanders, \"I will send for you.\"\n\n\"I loved him,\" she said, with more feeling than Sanders thought was\npossible for a native to show.\n\n\"You are an easy lover,\" said Sanders.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"That is the way with some women,\" she said. \"When I love, I love with\nterrible strength; when I hate, I hate for ever and ever--I hate you,\nmaster!\"\n\nShe said it very simply.\n\n\"If you were a man,\" said the exasperated Commissioner, \"I would tie you\nup and whip you.\"\n\n\"F--f--b!\" said the girl contemptuously, and left him staring.\n\nTo appreciate the position, you have to realise that Sanders was lord of\nall this district; that he had the power of life and death, and no man\ndared question or disobey his word. Had M'Lino been a man, as he said,\nshe would have suffered for her treason--there is no better word for her\noffence--but she was a woman, and a seriously gifted woman, and,\nmoreover, sure of whatever powers she had.\n\nHe did not see her again during the three days he was in the city, nor\n(this is the extraordinary circumstance) did he discuss her with the\nchief. He learned that she had become the favourite wife of O'Sako; that\nshe had many lovers and scorned her husband, but he sought no news of\nher. Once he saw her walking towards him, and went out of his way to\navoid her. It was horribly weak and he knew it, but he had no power to\nresist the impulse that came over him to give her a wide berth.\n\nFollowing this visit, Sanders was coming down stream at a leisurely\npace, he himself at the steering wheel, and his eyes searching the\ntreacherous river for sand banks. His mind was filled with the problem\nof M'Lino, when suddenly in the bush that fringes the Isisi river,\nsomething went \"woof,\" and the air was filled with flying potlegs. One\nstruck his cabin, and splintered a panel to shreds, many fell upon the\nwater, one missed Sergeant Abiboo's head and sent his _tarbosh_ flying.\n\nSanders rang his engines astern, being curious to discover what induced\nthe would-be assassin to fire a blunderbuss in his direction, and\nAbiboo, bare-headed, went pattering forward and slipped the canvas cover\nfrom the gleaming little Maxim.\n\nThen four Houssa soldiers jumped into the water and waded ashore,\nholding their rifles above their heads with the one hand and their\nammunition in the other, and Sanders stood by the rail of the boat,\nbalancing a sporting Lee-Enfield in the crook of his arm.\n\nWhoever fired the shot had chosen the place of killing very well. The\nbush was very thick, the approach to land lay through coarse grass that\nsprang from the swamp, vegetation ran rank, and a tangle of creeper\nformed a screen that would have been impenetrable to a white man.\n\nBut the Houssas had a way--they found the man with his smoking gun,\nwaiting calmly.\n\nHe was of the Isisi people--a nation of philosophers--and he surrendered\nhis weapon without embarrassment.\n\n\"I think,\" he said to Sergeant Abiboo, as they hurried down the bank to\nthe river-side, \"this means death.\"\n\n\"Death and the torments of hell to follow,\" said Abiboo, who was\nembittered by the loss of his _tarbosh_, which had cost him five francs\nin the French territory.\n\nSanders put up his rifle when he saw the prisoner. He held an informal\ncourt in the shattered deck cabin.\n\n\"Did you shoot at me?\" he asked.\n\n\"I did, master,\" said the man.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because,\" the prisoner replied, \"you are a devil and exercise\nwitchcraft.\"\n\nSanders was puzzled a little.\n\n\"In what particular section of the devil department have I been busy?\"\nhe asked in the vernacular.\n\nThe prisoner was gazing at him steadily.\n\n\"Master,\" he replied, \"it is not my business to understand these things.\nIt is said to me, 'kill'--and I kill.\"\n\nSanders wasted no more time in vain questions. The man was put in irons,\nthe nose of the steamer turned again down stream, and the Commissioner\nresumed his vigil.\n\nMidway between B'Fani and Lakaloli he came to a tying-up place. Here\nthere were dead trees for the chopping, and he put his men to replenish\nhis stock of fuel.\n\nHe was annoyed, not because a man had attempted to take his life, nor\neven because his neat little cabin forward was a litter of splinters and\nbroken glass where the potleg had struck, but because he nosed trouble\nwhere he thought all was peace and harmony.\n\nHe had control of some sixteen distinct and separate nations, each\nisolated and separated from the other by custom and language. They were\ndistinct, not as the French are from the Italian, but as the Slav is\nfrom the Turk.\n\nIn the good old times before the English came there were many wars,\ntribe against tribe, people against people. There were battles, murders,\nraidings, and wholesale crucifixions, but the British changed all that.\nThere was peace in the land.\n\nSanders selected with care a long, thin cigar from his case, nibbled at\nthe end and lit it.\n\nThe prisoner sat on the steel deck of the _Zaire_ near the men's\nquarters. He was chained by the leg-iron to a staple, and did not seem\ndepressed to any extent. When Sanders made his appearance, a camp stool\nin his hand, the Commissioner seated himself, and began his inquisition.\n\n\"How do they call you, my man?\"\n\n\"Bofabi of Isisi.\"\n\n\"Who told you to kill me?\"\n\n\"Lord, I forget.\"\n\n\"A man or a woman?\"\n\n\"Lord, it may have been either.\"\n\nMore than that Sanders could not learn, and the subsequent examination\nat Isisi taught Sanders nothing, for, when confronted with M'Lino, the\nman said that he did not know her.\n\nSanders went back to his base in a puzzled frame of mind, and Bofabi of\nIsisi was sent to the convict establishment at the river's mouth. There\nmatters stood for three months, and all that Sanders learnt of the girl\nwas that she had a new lover whose name was Tebeki, and who was chief of\nthe Akasava.\n\nThere were three months of peace and calm, and then Tebeki, coveting his\nneighbour's wife, took three hundred spears down into the Isisi country,\nburnt the village that sheltered her, crucified her husband, and carried\nher back with him.\n\nIn honour of this achievement Tebeki gave a feast and a beer dance.\nThere were great and shameless orgies that lasted five days, and the\nstrip of forest that fringes the river between the Isisi and the lower\nriver became a little inferno.\n\nAt the end of the five days Tebeki sat down to consider his position. He\nwas in the act of inventing justification for his crime, when Sanders\ncame on the scene. More ominous were the ten Houssas and the Maxim which\naccompanied the brown-faced little man.\n\nSanders walked to Tebeki's hut and called him out, and Tebeki,\nblear-eyed and shaky, stepped forth into the hot sunshine, blinking.\n\n\"Tebeki,\" said Sanders, \"what of O'Sako and his village?\"\n\n\"Master,\" said Tebeki, slowly, \"he put shame upon me----\"\n\n\"Spare me your lies,\" said Sanders coldly, and signed to the Houssas.\n\nThen he looked round for a suitable tree. There was one behind the\nhut--a great copal-gum.\n\n\"In half an hour I shall hang you,\" said Sanders, looking at his watch.\n\nTebeki said nothing; only his bare feet fidgeted in the dust.\n\nThere came out of the hut a tall girl, who stood eyeing the group with\ncuriosity; then she came forward, and laid her hand on Tebeki's bare\nshoulder.\n\n\"What will you do with my man?\" she asked. \"I am M'Lino, the wife of\nO'Sako.\"\n\nSanders was not horrified, he showed his teeth in a mirthless grin and\nlooked at her.\n\n\"You will find another man, M'Lino,\" he said, \"as readily as you found\nthis one.\" Then he turned away to give directions for the hanging. But\nthe woman followed him, and boldly laid her hand on his arm.\n\n\"Master,\" she said, \"if any was wronged by O'Sako's death, was it not I,\nhis wife? Yet I say let Tebeki go free, for I love him.\"\n\n\"You may go to the devil,\" said Sanders politely; \"I am getting tired of\nyou and your lovers.\"\n\nHe hanged Tebeki, expeditiously and with science, and the man died\nimmediately, because Sanders was very thorough in this sort of business.\nThen he and the Houssa corps marched away, and the death song of the\nwoman sounded fainter and fainter as the forest enveloped him. He\ncamped that night on the Hill of Trees, overlooking the sweeping bend of\nthe river, and in the morning his orderly came to tell him that the wife\nof O'Sako desired to see him.\n\nSanders cursed the wife of O'Sako, but saw her.\n\nShe opened her mission without preliminary.\n\n\"Because of the death I brought to O'Sako, my husband, and Tebeki, my\nlover, the people have cast me forth,\" she said. \"Every hand is against\nme, and if I stay in this country I shall die.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Sanders.\n\n\"So I will go with you, until you reach the Sangar River, which leads to\nthe Congo. I have brothers there.\"\n\n\"All this may be true,\" said Sanders dispassionately; \"on the other\nhand, I know that your heart is filled with hate because I have taken\ntwo men from you, and hanged a third. Nevertheless, you shall come with\nus as far as the Sangar River, but you shall not touch the 'chop' of my\nmen, nor shall you speak with them.\"\n\nShe nodded and left him, and Sanders issued orders for her treatment.\n\nIn the middle of the night Abiboo, who, in addition to being Sanders'\nservant, was a sergeant of the Houssas, came to Sanders' tent, and the\nCommissioner jumped out of bed and mechanically reached for his Express.\n\n\"Leopards?\" he asked briefly.\n\n\"Master,\" said Sergeant Abiboo, \"it is the woman M'Lino--she is a\nwitch.\"\n\n\"Sergeant,\" said the exasperated Sanders, \"if you wake me up in the\nmiddle of the night with that sort of talk, I will break your infernal\nhead.\"\n\n\"Be that as it may, master,\" said the sergeant stolidly, \"she is a\nwitch, for she has talked with my men and done many wonderful\nthings--such as causing them to behold their children and far-away\nscenes.\"\n\n\"Have I an escort of babies?\" asked Sanders despairingly. \"I wish,\" he\nwent on, with quiet savageness, \"I had chosen Kroomen or Bushmen\"--the\nsergeant winced--\"or the mad people of the Isisi River, before I took a\nhalf-company of the King's Houssas.\"\n\nThe sergeant gulped down the insult, saying nothing.\n\n\"Bring the woman to me,\" said Sanders. He scrambled into his clothing,\nand lit his tent lantern.\n\nAfter a while he heard the pattering of bare feet, and the girl came\ninto his tent, and regarded him quietly.\n\n\"M'Lino,\" said Sanders, \"I told you that you were not to speak with my\nmen.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" she said, \"they spoke with me first.\"\n\n\"Is this true?\"\n\nThe sergeant at the tent door nodded. \"Tembeli, the son of Sekambano,\nspoke with her, thus disobeying orders, and the other men followed,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Bushmen by gad!\" fumed Sanders. \"You will take Tembeli, the son of\nSekambano, tie him to a tree, and give him twenty lashes.\"\n\nThe sergeant saluted, produced a tawdry little notebook, all brass\nbinding and gold edges, and made a laborious note.\n\n\"As for you,\" said Sanders to the woman, \"you drop your damned\nbush-mesmerism, or I'll treat you in the same way--_alaki_?\"\n\n\"Yes, lord,\" she said meekly, and departed.\n\nTwo Houssas tied Tembeli to a tree, and the sergeant gave him twenty-one\nwith a pliable hippo-hide--the extra one being the sergeant's\nperquisite.\n\nIn the morning the sergeant reported that Tembeli had died in the night,\nand Sanders worried horribly.\n\n\"It isn't the flogging,\" he said; \"he has had the _chicotte_ before.\"\n\n\"It is the woman,\" said the sergeant wisely. \"She is a witch; I foresaw\nthis when she joined the column.\"\n\nThey buried Tembeli, the son of Sekambano, and Sanders wrote three\nreports of the circumstances of the death, each of which he tore up.\n\nThen he marched on.\n\nThat night the column halted near a village, and Sanders sent the woman,\nunder escort, to the chief, with orders to see her safely to the Sangar\nRiver. In half an hour she returned, with the escort, and Sergeant\nAbiboo explained the circumstances.\n\n\"The chief will not take her in, being afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid?\" Sanders spluttered in his wrath; \"Afraid? What is he afraid\nof?\"\n\n\"Her devilry,\" said the sergeant; \"the _lo-koli_ has told him the story\nof Tebeki, and he will not have her.\"\n\nSanders swore volubly for five minutes; then he went off to interview\nthe chief of the village.\n\nThe interview was short and to the point. Sanders knew this native very\nwell, and made no mistakes.\n\n\"Chief,\" he said at the end of the palaver, \"two things I may do; one is\nto punish you for your disobedience, and the other is to go on my way.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the other earnestly, \"if you give my village to the fire,\nyet I would not take the woman M'Lino.\"\n\n\"So much I realise,\" said Sanders; \"therefore I will go on my way.\"\n\nHe marched at dawn on the following day, the woman a little ahead of the\ncolumn, and under his eye. Halting for a \"chop\" and rest at mid-day, a\nman of the Houssas came to him and said there was a dead man hanging\nfrom a tree in the wood. Sanders went immediately with the man to the\nplace of the hanging, for he was responsible for the peace of the\ndistrict.\n\n\"Where?\" he asked, and the man pointed to a straight gum-tree that stood\nby itself in a clearing.\n\n\"Where?\" asked Sanders again, for there was no evidence of tragedy. The\nman still pointed at the tree, and Sanders frowned.\n\n\"Go forward and touch his foot,\" said the Commissioner, and, after a\nlittle hesitation, the soldier walked slowly to the tree and put out his\nhand. But he touched nothing but air, as far as Sanders could see.\n\n\"You are mad,\" he said, and whistled for the sergeant.\n\n\"What do you see there?\" asked Sanders, and the sergeant replied\ninstantly:\n\n\"Beyond the hanging man----\"\n\n\"There is no hanging man,\" said Sanders coolly--for he began to\nappreciate the need for calm reasoning--\"nothing but a tree and some\nshadows.\"\n\nThe Houssa looked puzzled, and turned a grave face to his.\n\n\"Master, there is a man hanging,\" he said.\n\n\"That is so,\" said Sanders quietly; \"we must investigate this matter.\"\nAnd he signed for the party to return to the camp.\n\nOn the way he asked carelessly if the sergeant had spoken with the woman\nM'Lino.\n\n\"I saw her, but she did not speak, except with her eyes.\"\n\nSanders nodded. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"where did you bury Tembeli, the son\nof Sekambano?\"\n\n\"Master, we left him, in accordance with our custom, on the ground at\nthe foot of a tree.\"\n\nSanders nodded again, for this is not the custom of the Houssas.\n\n\"We will go back on our tracks to the camping place where the woman came\nto us,\" he said.\n\nThey marched until sundown, and whilst two men pitched his tent Sanders\nstrolled round the little camp. The men were sitting about their\ncooking-pots, but the woman M'Lino sat apart, her elbows on her knees,\nher face between her hands.\n\n\"M'Lino,\" he said to her, halting suddenly before her, \"how many men\nhave you killed in your life?\"\n\nShe looked at him long and fixedly, and he returned the stare; then she\ndropped her eyes. \"Many men,\" she said.\n\n\"So I think,\" said Sanders.\n\nHe was eating his dinner when Abiboo came slowly toward him.\n\n\"Master, the man has died,\" he said.\n\nSanders looked at him narrowly.\n\n\"Which man?\"\n\n\"The man you chicotted with your own hand,\" said Abiboo.\n\nNow, the Commissioner had neither chicotted a man, nor had he ordered\npunishment, but he replied in a matter-of-fact tone, \"I will see him.\"\n\nOn the edge of the camp there was a little group about a prostrate\nfigure. The Houssas fell apart with black looks as Sanders came near,\nand there was some muttering. Though Sanders did not see it, M'Lino\nlooked strangely at Ahmid, a Houssa, who took up his rifle and went\nstealthily into the bush.\n\nThe Commissioner bent over the man who lay there, felt his breast, and\ndetected no beat of heart.\n\n\"Get me my medicine chest,\" he said, but none obeyed him.\n\n\"Sergeant,\" he repeated, \"bring my medicine chest!\"\n\nAbiboo saluted slowly, and, with every appearance of reluctance, went.\n\nHe came back with the case of undressed skin, and Sanders opened it,\ntook out the ammonia bottle, and applied it to the man's nose. He made\nno sign.\n\n\"We shall see,\" was all that Sanders said when the experiment failed. He\ntook a hypodermic syringe and filled the little tube with a solution of\nstrychnine. This he jabbed unceremoniously into the patient's back. In a\nminute the corpse sat up, jerkily.\n\n\"Ha!\" said Sanders, cheerfully; \"I am evidently a great magician!\"\n\nHe rose to his feet, dusted his knees, and beckoned the sergeant.\n\n\"Take four men and return to the place where you left Tembeli. If the\nleopards have not taken him, you will meet him on the road, because by\nthis time he will have waked up.\"\n\nHe saw the party march off, then turned his attention to M'Lino.\n\n\"My woman,\" he said, \"it is evident to me that you are a witch, although\nI have met your like before\"--it was observed that the face of Sanders\nwas very white. \"I cannot flog you, because you are a woman, but I can\nkill you.\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\nTheir eyes met in a struggle for mastery, and so they stared at one\nanother for a space of time which seemed to Sanders a thousand years,\nbut which was in all probability less than a minute.\n\n\"It would be better if you killed yourself,\" she said.\n\n\"I think so,\" said Sanders dully, and fumbled for his revolver.\n\nIt was half drawn, his thumb on the hammer, when a rifle banged in the\nbushes and the woman fell forward without a word.\n\nAhmid, the Houssa, was ever a bad shot.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n\"I believe,\" said Sanders, later, \"that you took your rifle to kill me,\nbeing under the influence of M'Lino, so I will make no bad report\nagainst you.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the Houssa simply, \"I know nothing of the matter.\"\n\n\"That I can well believe,\" said Sanders, and gave the order to march.\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER XI.\n\n  THE WITCH-DOCTOR.\n\n\nNothing surprised Sanders except the ignorance of the average\nstay-at-home Briton on all matters pertaining to the savage peoples of\nAfrica. Queer things happened in the \"black patch\"--so the coast\nofficials called Sanders' territory--miraculous, mysterious things, but\nSanders was never surprised. He had dealings with folks who believed in\nghosts and personal devils, and he sympathised with them, realising that\nit is very difficult to ascribe all the evils of life to human agencies.\n\nSanders was an unquiet man, or so his constituents thought him, and a\nlittle mad; this also was the native view. Worst of all, there was no\nmethod in his madness.\n\nOther commissioners might be depended upon to arrive after the rains,\nsending word ahead of their coming. This was a good way--the Isisi, the\nOchori, and the N'Gombi people, everlastingly at issue, were agreed upon\nthis--because, with timely warning of the Commissioner's approach, it\nwas possible to thrust out of sight the ugly evidence of fault, to clean\nup and make tidy the muddle of folly.\n\nIt was bad to step sheepishly forth from your hut into the clear light\nof the rising sun, with all the dbris of an overnight feast mutely\ntestifying to your discredit, and face the cold, unwavering eyes of a\nlittle brown-faced man in immaculate white. The switch he carried in his\nhand would be smacking his leg suggestively, and there were always four\nHoussa soldiers in blue and scarlet in the background, immobile, but\nalert, quick to obey.\n\nOnce Sanders came to a N'Gombi village at dawn, when by every known\nconvention he should have been resting in his comfortable bungalow some\nthree hundred miles down river.\n\nSanders came strolling through the village street just as the sun topped\nthe trees and long shadows ran along the ground before the flood of\nlemon-coloured light.\n\nThe village was silent and deserted, which was a bad sign, and spoke of\novernight orgies. Sanders walked on until he came to the big square near\nthe palaver house, and there the black ruin of a dead fire smoked\nsullenly.\n\nSanders saw something that made him go raking amongst the embers.\n\n\"Pah!\" said Sanders, with a wry face.\n\nHe sent back to the steamer for the full force of his Houssa guard, then\nhe walked into the chief's hut and kicked him till he woke.\n\nHe came out blinking and shivering, though the morning was warm.\n\n\"Telemi, son of O'ari,\" said Sanders, \"tell me why I should not hang\nyou--man-eater and beast.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the chief, \"we chopped this man because he was an enemy,\nstealing into the village at night, and carrying away our goats and our\ndogs. Besides which, we did not know that you were near by.\"\n\n\"I can believe that,\" said Sanders.\n\nA _lo-koli_ beat the villages to wakefulness, and before a silent\nassembly the headman of the N'Gombi village was scientifically flogged.\n\nThen Sanders called the elders together and said a few words of cheer\nand comfort.\n\n\"Only hyenas and crocodiles eat their kind,\" he said, \"also certain\nfishes.\" (There was a general shudder, for amongst the N'Gombi to be\nlikened to a fish is a deadly insult.) \"Cannibals I do not like, and\nthey are hated by the King's Government. Therefore when it comes to my\nears--and I have many spies--that you chop man, whether he be enemy or\nfriend, I will come quickly and I will flog sorely; and if it should\nagain happen I will bring with me a rope, and I will find me a tree, and\nthere will be broken huts in this land.\"\n\nAgain they shuddered at the threat of the broken hut, for it is the\ncustom of the N'Gombi to break down the walls of a dead man's house to\ngive his spirit free egress.\n\nSanders carried away with him the chief of the village, with leg-irons\nat his ankles, and in course of time the prisoner arrived at a little\nlabour colony on the coast, where he worked for five years in company\nwith other indiscreet headmen who were suffering servitude for divers\noffences.\n\nThey called Sanders in the Upper River districts by a long and sonorous\nname, which may be euphemistically translated as \"The man who has a\nfaithless wife,\" the little joke of Bosambo, chief of the Ochori, and\nmightily subtle because Sanders was wedded to his people.\n\nNorth and south, east and west, he prowled. He travelled by night and by\nday. Sometimes his steamer would go threshing away up river, and be\nwatched out of sight by the evil-doing little fishing-villages.\n\n\"Go you,\" said Sarala, who was a little headman of the Akasava, \"go you\nthree hours' journey in your canoe and watch the river for Sandi's\nreturn. And at first sign of his steamer--which you may see if you climb\nthe hill at the river's bend--come back and warn me, for I desire to\nfollow certain customs of my father in which Sandi has no pleasure.\"\n\nHe spoke to two of his young men and they departed. That night by the\nlight of a fire, to the accompaniment of dancing and drum-beating, the\nson of the headman brought his firstborn, ten hours old, squealing\nnoisily, as if with knowledge of the doom ahead, and laid it at his\nfather's feet.\n\n\"People,\" said the little chief, \"it is a wise saying of all, and has\nbeen a wise saying since time began, that the firstborn has a special\nvirtue; so that if we sacrifice him to sundry gods and devils, good luck\nwill follow us in all our doings.\"\n\nHe said a word to the son, who took a broad-bladed spear and began\nturning the earth until he had dug a little grave. Into this, alive, the\nchild was laid, his little feet kicking feebly against the loose mould.\n\n\"Oh, gods and devils,\" invoked the old man, \"we shed no blood, that this\nchild may come to you unblemished.\"\n\nThe son stirred a heap of loose earth with his foot, so that it fell\nover the baby's legs; then into the light of the fire stepped Sanders,\nand the chief's son fell back.\n\nSanders was smoking a thin cigar, and he smoked for fully a minute\nwithout saying a word, and a minute was a very long time. Then he\nstepped to the grave, stooped, and lifted the baby up awkwardly, for he\nwas more used to handling men than babes, gave it a little shake to\nclear it of earth, and handed it to a woman.\n\n\"Take the child to its mother,\" he said, \"and tell her to send it to me\nalive in the morning, otherwise she had best find a new husband.\"\n\nThen he turned to the old chief and his son.\n\n\"Old man,\" he said, \"how many years have you to live?\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the old man, \"that is for you to say.\"\n\nSanders scratched his chin reflectively, and the old man watched him\nwith fear in his eyes.\n\n\"You will go to Bosambo, chief of the Ochori, telling him I have sent\nyou, and you shall till his garden, and carry his water until you die,\"\nsaid Sanders.\n\n\"I am so old that that will be soon,\" said the old man.\n\n\"If you were younger it would be sooner,\" said Sanders. \"As for your\nson, we will wait until the morning.\"\n\nThe Houssas in the background marched the younger man to the camp\nSanders had formed down river--the boat that had passed had been\nintended to deceive a chief under suspicion--and in the morning, when\nthe news came that the child was dead--whether from shock, or injury, or\nexposure, Sanders did not trouble to inquire--the son of the chief was\nhanged.\n\nI tell these stories of Sanders of the River, that you may grasp the\ntype of man he was and learn something of the work he had to do. If he\nwas quick to punish, he acted in accordance with the spirit of the\npeople he governed, for they had no memory; and yesterday, with its\nfaults, its errors and its teachings, was a very long time ago, and a\nman resents an unjust punishment for a crime he has forgotten.\n\nIt is possible to make a bad mistake, but Sanders never made one, though\nhe was near to doing so once.\n\nSanders was explaining his point of view in regard to natives to\nProfessor Sir George Carsley, when that eminent scientist arrived\nunexpectedly at headquarters, having been sent out by the British\nGovernment to study tropical disease at first hand.\n\nSir George was a man of some age, with a face of exceptional pallor and\na beard that was snowy white.\n\n\"There was a newspaper man who said I treated my people like dogs,\" said\nSanders slowly, for he was speaking in English, a language that was\nseldom called for. \"I believe I do. That is to say, I treat them as if\nthey were real good dogs, not to be petted one minute and kicked the\nnext; not to be encouraged to lie on the drawing-room mat one day, and\nthe next cuffed away from the dining-room hearthrug.\"\n\nSir George made no answer. He was a silent man, who had had some\nexperience on the coast, and had lived for years in the solitude of a\nCentral African province, studying the habits of the malarial mosquito.\n\nSanders was never a great conversationalist, and the three days the\nprofessor spent at headquarters were deadly dull ones for the\nCommissioner.\n\nOn one subject alone did the professor grow talkative.\n\n\"I want to study the witch-doctor,\" he said. \"I think there is no\nappointment in the world that would give me a greater sense of power\nthan my appointment by a native people to that post.\"\n\nSanders thought the scientist was joking, but the other returned to the\nsubject again and again, gravely, earnestly, and persistently, and for\nhis entertainment Sanders recited all the stories he had ever heard of\nwitch-doctors and their tribe.\n\n\"But you don't expect to learn anything from these people?\" said\nSanders, half in joke.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said the professor, seriously; \"I anticipate making\nvaluable scientific discoveries through my intercourse with them.\"\n\n\"Then you're a silly old ass,\" said Sanders; but he said it to himself.\n\nThe pale professor left him at the end of the fourth day, and beyond an\nofficial notification that he had established himself on the border, no\nfurther news came of the scientist for six months, until one evening\ncame the news that the pale-faced old man had been drowned by the\nupsetting of a canoe. He had gone out on a solitary excursion, taking\nwith him some scientific apparatus, and nothing more was heard of him\nuntil his birch-bark canoe was discovered, bottom up, floating on the\nriver.\n\nNo trace of Sir George was found, and in the course of time Sanders\ncollected the dead man's belongings and forwarded them to England.\n\nThere were two remarkable facts about this tragedy, the first being that\nSanders found no evidence either in papers or diaries, of the results of\nany scientific research work performed by the professor other than a\nsmall note-book. The second was, that in his little book the scientist\nhad carefully recorded the stories Sanders had told him of witch\ndoctors.\n\n(Sanders recognised at least one story which he had himself invented on\nthe spur of the moment for the professor's entertainment.)\n\nSix more or less peaceful months passed, and then began the series of\nevents which make up the story of the Devil Man.\n\nIt began on the Little River.\n\nThere was a woman of the Isisi people who hated her husband, though he\nwas very good to her, building her a hut and placing an older wife to\nwait upon her. He gave her many presents, including a great neck-ring of\nbrass, weighing pounds, that made her the most envied woman on the Isisi\nRiver. But her hatred for her husband was unquenched; and one morning\nshe came out from her hut, looking dazed and frightened, and began in a\nquavering voice to sing the Song of the Dead, mechanically pouring\nlittle handfuls of dust on her head, and the villagers went in, to find\nthe man stark and staring, with a twisted grin on his dead face and the\npains of hell in his eyes.\n\nIn the course of two days they burned the husband in the Middle River;\nand as the canoe bearing the body swept out of sight round a bend of the\nriver, the woman stepped into the water and laved the dust from her\ngrimy body and stripped the green leaves of mourning from her waist.\n\nThen she walked back to the village with a light step, for the man she\nhated best was dead and there was an end to it.\n\nFour days later came Sanders, a grim little man, with a thin, brown face\nand hair inclined to redness.\n\n\"M'Fasa,\" he said, standing at the door of her hut and looking down at\nher, as with a dogged simulation of indifference she pounded her grain,\n\"they tell me your man has died.\"\n\n\"Lord, that is true,\" she said. \"He died of a sudden sickness.\"\n\n\"Too sudden for my liking,\" said Sanders, and disappeared into the dark\ninterior of the hut. By and by Sanders came back into the light and\nlooked down on her. In his hand was a tiny glass phial, such as\nEuropeans know very well, but which was a remarkable find in a heathen\nvillage.\n\n\"I have a fetish,\" he said, \"and my fetish has told me that you poisoned\nyour husband, M'Fasa.\"\n\n\"Your fetish lies,\" she said, not looking up.\n\n\"I will not argue that matter,\" said Sanders wisely, for he had no\nproofs beyond his suspicions; and straightway he summoned to him the\nchief man of the village.\n\nThere was a little wait, the woman pounding her corn slowly, with\ndowncast eyes, pausing now and then to wipe the sweat from her forehead\nwith the back of her hand, and Sanders, his helmet on the back of his\nhead, a half-smoked cheroot in his mouth, hands thrust deep into his\nduck-pockets and an annoyed frown on his face, looking at her.\n\nBy and by came the chief tardily, having been delayed by the search for\na soldier's scarlet coat, such as he wore on great occasions.\n\n\"Master, you sent for me,\" he said.\n\nSanders shifted his gaze.\n\n\"On second thoughts,\" he said, \"I do not need you.\"\n\nThe chief went away with a whole thanksgiving service in his heart, for\nthere had been certain secret doings on the river for which he expected\nreprimand.\n\n\"M'Fasa, you will go to my boat,\" said Sanders, and the woman, putting\ndown her mortar, rose and went obediently to the steamer. Sanders\nfollowed slowly, having a great many matters to consider. If he\ndenounced this woman to the elders of the village, she would be stoned\nto death; if he carried her to headquarters and tried her, there was no\nevidence on which a conviction might be secured. There was no place to\nwhich he could deport her, yet to leave her would be to open the way for\nfurther mischief.\n\nShe awaited him on the deck of the _Zaire_, a straight, shapely girl of\neighteen, fearless, defiant.\n\n\"M'Fasa,\" said Sanders, \"why did you kill your husband?\"\n\n\"Lord, I did not kill him; he died of the sickness,\" she said, as\ndoggedly as before.\n\nSanders paced the narrow deck, his head on his breast, for this was a\nprofound problem. Then he looked up.\n\n\"You may go,\" he said; and the woman, a little puzzled, walked along the\nplank that connected the boat with the shore, and disappeared into the\nbush.\n\nThree weeks later his spies brought word that men were dying\nunaccountably on the Upper River. None knew why they died, for a man\nwould sit down strong and full of cheer to his evening meal, and lo! in\nthe morning, when his people went to wake him, he would be beyond\nwaking, being most unpleasantly dead.\n\nThis happened in many villages on the Little River.\n\n\"It's getting monotonous,\" said Sanders to the captain of the Houssas.\n\"There is some wholesale poisoning going on, and I am going up to find\nthe gentleman who dispenses the dope.\"\n\nIt so happened that the first case claiming investigation was at Isisi\nCity. It was a woman who had died, and this time Sanders suspected the\nhusband, a notorious evil-doer.\n\n\"Okali,\" he said, coming to the point, \"why did you poison your wife?\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the man, \"she died of the sickness. In the evening she was\nwell, but at the dark hour before sun came she turned in her sleep\nsaying 'Ah! oh!' and straightway she died.\"\n\nSanders drew a long breath.\n\n\"Get a rope,\" he said to one of his men, and when the rope arrived\nAbiboo scrambled up to the lower branch of a copal-gum and\nscientifically lashed a block and tackle.\n\n\"Okali,\" said Sanders, \"I am going to hang you for the murder of your\nwife, for I am a busy man and have no time to make inquiries; and if you\nare not guilty of her murder, yet there are many other abominable deeds\nyou have been guilty of, therefore I am justified in hanging you.\"\n\nThe man was grey with terror when they slipped the noose over his neck\nand strapped his hands behind him.\n\n\"Lord, she was a bad wife to me and had many lovers,\" he stammered. \"I\ndid not mean to kill her, but the Devil Man said that such medicine\nwould make her forget her lovers----\"\n\n\"Devil Man! What Devil Man?\" asked Sanders quickly.\n\n\"Lord, there is a devil greatly respected in these parts, who wanders in\nthe forest all the time and gives many curious medicines.\"\n\n\"Where is he to be found?\"\n\n\"Lord, none know. He comes and goes, like a grey ghost, and he has a\nfetish more powerful than a thousand ordinary devils. Master, I gave the\nwoman, my wife, that which he gave to me, and she died. How might I know\nthat she would die?\"\n\n\"_Cheg'li_,\" said Sanders shortly to the men at the rope-end, and\n_cheg'li_ in the dialect of the River means \"pull.\"\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\nSanders was in a changeable mood, and a little irritable by reason of\nthe fact that he knew himself to be fickle.\n\n\"How came this drug to you? In powder, in liquid, or----\"\n\nThe man's lips were dry. He could do no more than shake his head\nhelplessly.\n\n\"Release him,\" said Sanders; and Abiboo loosened the noose and\nunstrapped the man's hands.\n\n\"If you have lied to me,\" said Sanders, \"you die at sunset. First let me\nhear more of this Devil Man, for I am anxious to make his acquaintance.\"\n\nHe gave the man ten minutes to recover from the effects of his fear,\nthen sent for him.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he, \"I know nothing of the Devil Man save that he is the\ngreatest witch-doctor in the world, and on nights when the moon is up\nand certain stars are in their places he comes like a ghost, and we are\nall afraid. Then those of us who need him go forth into the forest, and\nhe gives to us according to our desires.\"\n\n\"How carried he the drug?\"\n\n\"Lord, it was in a crystal rod, such as white men carry their medicines\nin. I will bring it to you.\"\n\nHe went back to his hut and returned a few minutes later with a phial,\nthe fellow to that which was already in Sanders' possession. The\nCommissioner took it and smelt at the opening. There was the faintest\nodour of almonds, and Sanders whistled, for he recognised the\nafter-scent of cyanide of potassium, which is not such a drug as\nuntutored witch-doctors know, much less employ.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n\"I can only suggest,\" wrote Sanders to headquarters, \"that by some\nmischance the medicine chest of the late Sir George Carsley has come\ninto the possession of a native 'doctor.' You will remember that the\nchest was with the professor when he was drowned. It has possibly been\nwashed up and discovered.... In the meantime, I am making diligent\ninquiries as to the identity of the Devil Man, who seems to have leapt\ninto fame so suddenly.\"\n\nThere were sleepless nights ahead for Sanders, nights of swift marchings\nand doublings, of quick runs up the river, of unexpected arrivals in\nvillages, of lonely vigils in the forest and by strange pools. But he\nhad no word of the Devil Man, though he learnt many things of interest.\nMost potent of his magical possessions was a box, \"so small,\" said one\nwho had seen it, and indicated a six-inch square. In this box dwelt a\nsmall and malicious god who pinched and scratched (yet without leaving a\nmark), who could stick needles into the human body and never draw blood.\n\n\"I give it up,\" said Sanders in despair, and went back to his base to\nthink matters out.\n\nHe was sitting at dinner one night, when far away on the river the drum\nbeat. It was not the regular _lo-koli_ roll, but a series of staccato\ntappings, and, stepping softly to the door, the Commissioner listened.\n\nHe had borrowed the Houssa signalling staff from headquarters, and\nstationed them at intervals along the river. On a still night the\ntapping of a drum carries far, but the rattle of iron-wood sticks on a\nhollowed tree-trunk carries farthest of all.\n\n\"Clok-clok, clockitty-clock.\"\n\nIt sounded like the far-away croaking of a bull-frog; but Sanders\npicked out the letters:\n\n\"Devil Man sacrifices to-morrow night in the Forest of Dreams.\"\n\nAs he jotted down the message on the white sleeve of his jacket, Abiboo\ncame running up the path.\n\n\"I have heard,\" said Sanders briefly. \"There is steam in the _pucapuc_?\"\n\n\"We are ready, master,\" said the man.\n\nSanders waited only to take a hanging revolver from the wall and throw\nhis overcoat over his arm, for his travelling kit was already deposited\non the _Zaire_, and had been for three days.\n\nIn the darkness the sharp nose of his little boat swung out to the\nstream, and ten minutes after the message came the boat was threshing a\nway against the swift river.\n\nAll night long the steamer went on, tacking from bank to bank to avoid\nthe shoals.\n\nDawn found her at a wooding, where her men, working at fever speed,\npiled logs on her deck until she had the appearance of a timber-boat.\n\nThen off again, stopping only to secure news of the coming sacrifice\nfrom the spies who were scattered up and down the river.\n\nSanders reached the edge of the Dream Forest at midnight and tied up. He\nhad ten Houssa policemen with him, and at the head of these he stepped\nashore into the blackness of the forest. One of the soldiers went ahead\nto find the path and keep it, and in single file the little force began\nits two-hour march. Once they came upon two leopards fighting; once they\nstumbled over a buffalo sleeping in their path. Twice they disturbed\nstrange beasts that slunk into the shadows as they passed, and came\nsnuffling after them, till Sanders flashed a white beam from his\nelectric lamp in their direction. Eventually they came stealthily to the\nplace of sacrifice.\n\nThere were at least six hundred people squatting in a semi-circle before\na rough altar built of logs. Two huge fires blazed and crackled on\neither side of the altar; but Sanders' eyes were for the Devil Man, who\nleant over the body of a young girl, apparently asleep, stretched upon\nthe logs.\n\nOnce the Devil Man had worn the garb of civilisation; now he was clothed\nin rags. He stood in his grimy shirt-sleeves, his white beard wild and\nuncombed, his pale face tense, and a curious light in his eyes. In his\nhand was a bright scalpel, and he was speaking--and, curiously enough,\nin English.\n\n\"This, gentlemen,\" said he, leaning easily against the rude altar, and\nspeaking with the assurance of one who had delivered many such lectures,\n\"is a bad case of trynosomiasis. You will observe the discoloration of\nskin, the opalescent pupils, and now that I have placed the patient\nunder anaesthetics you will remark the misplacement of the cervical\nglands, which is an invariable symptom.\"\n\nHe paused and looked benignly around.\n\n\"I may say that I have lived for a great time amongst native people. I\noccupied the honourable position of witch-doctor in Central Africa----\"\n\nHe stopped and passed his hand across his brow, striving to recall\nsomething; then he picked up the thread of his discourse.\n\nAll the time he spoke the half-naked assembly sat silent and\nawe-stricken, comprehending nothing save that the witch-doctor with the\nwhite face, who had come from nowhere and had done many wonderful\nthings--his magic box proved to be a galvanic battery--was about to\nperform strange rites.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" the old man went on, tapping the breast of his victim with\nthe handle of his scalpel, \"I shall make an incision----\"\n\nSanders came from his place of concealment, and walked steadily towards\nthe extemporised operating-table.\n\n\"Professor,\" he said gently, and the madman looked at him with a puzzled\nfrown.\n\n\"You are interrupting the clinic,\" he said testily; \"I am\ndemonstrating----\"\n\n\"I know, sir.\"\n\nSanders took his arm, and Sir George Carsley, a great scientist,\nconsulting surgeon to St. Mark's Hospital, London, and the author of\nmany books on tropical diseases, went with him like a child.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER XII.\n\n  THE LONELY ONE.\n\n\nMr. Commissioner Sanders had lived so long with native people that he\nhad absorbed not a little of their simplicity. More than this, he had\nacquired the uncanny power of knowing things which he would not and\ncould not have known unless he were gifted with the prescience which is\nevery aboriginal's birthright.\n\nHe had sent three spies into the Isisi country--which lies a long way\nfrom headquarters and is difficult of access--and after two months of\nwaiting they came to him in a body, bearing good news.\n\nThis irritated Sanders to an unjustifiable degree.\n\n\"Master, I say to you that the Isisi are quiet,\" protested one of the\nspies; \"and there is no talk of war.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said Sanders, ungraciously. \"And you?\"\n\nHe addressed the second spy.\n\n\"Lord,\" said the man, \"I went into the forest, to the border of the\nland, and there is no talk of war. Chiefs and headmen told me this.\"\n\n\"Truly you are a great spy,\" scoffed Sanders; \"and how came you to the\nchiefs and headmen? And how did they greet you? 'Hail! secret spy of\nSandi'? Huh!\"\n\nHe dismissed the men with a wave of his hand, and putting on his helmet\nwent down to the Houssa lines, where the blue-coated soldiers gambled in\nthe shade of their neat white barracks.\n\nThe Houssa captain was making palatable medicine with the aid of a book\nof cigarette papers and a six-ounce bottle of quinine sulphide.\n\nSanders observed his shaking hand, and talked irritably.\n\n\"There's trouble in the Isisi,\" he said, \"I can smell it. I don't know\nwhat it is--but there's devilry of sorts.\"\n\n\"Secret societies?\" suggested the Houssa.\n\n\"Secret grandmothers,\" snarled Sanders. \"How many men have you got?\"\n\n\"Sixty, including the lame 'uns,\" said the Houssa officer, and swallowed\na paperful of quinine with a grimace.\n\nSanders tapped the toe of his boot with his thin ebony stick, and was\nthoughtful.\n\n\"I may want 'em,\" he said. \"I'm going to find out what's wrong with\nthese Isisi people.\"\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nBy the little river that turns abruptly from the River of Spirits,\nImgani, the Lonely One, built a house. He built it in proper fashion,\nstealing the wood from a village five miles away. In this village there\nhad been many deaths, owing to The Sickness; and it is the custom on the\nUpper River that whenever a person dies, the house wherein he died shall\ndie also.\n\nNo man takes shelter under the accursed roof whereunder the Spirit sits\nbrooding; the arms of the dead man are broken and scattered on his\nshallow grave, and the cooking-pots of his wives are there likewise.\n\nBy and by, under the combined influences of wind and rain, the reed roof\nsags and sinks, the doorposts rot; elephant-grass, coarse and strong,\nshoots up between crevices in wall and roof; then come a heavier rain\nand a heavier wind, and the forest has wiped the foul spot clean.\n\nImgani, who said he was of the N'Gombi people, and was afraid of no\ndevils--at any rate, no Isisi devil--stole doorposts and native rope\nfearlessly. He stole them by night, when the moon was behind the trees,\nand mocked the dead spirits, calling them by evil and tantalising names.\n\nYet he went cautiously to work; for whilst he did not hold spirits in\naccount, he was wholesomely respectful of the live Isisi, who would have\nput him to death had his sacrilege been detected, though, strangely\nenough, death was the thing he feared least.\n\nSo he stole the accursed supports and accursed roof-props, and would\nhave stolen the roofs as well, but for the fact that they were very old\nand full of spiders.\n\nAll these things he came and took, carrying them five miles to the turn\nof the river, and there, at his leisure, he built a little house. In the\ndaytime he slept, in the night he trapped beasts and caught fish, but he\nmade no attempt to catch the big bats that come over from the middle\nisland of the river, though these are very edible, and regarded as a\ndelicacy.\n\nOne day, just before the sun went down, he went into the forest on the\ntrack of zebra. He carried two big hunting-spears, such as the N'Gombi\nmake best; a wickerwork shield, and on his back, slung by a strip of\nhide, a bunch of dried fish he had caught in the river.\n\nA man of middle height was Imgani, spare of build, but broad of\nshoulder. His skin shone healthily, and his step was light. As he\nwalked, you saw the muscles of his back ripple and weave like the\nmuscles of a well-trained thoroughbred.\n\nHe was half an hour's journey within the forest, when he came upon a\ngirl. She was carrying a bundle of manioc root on her head, and walked\ngracefully.\n\nWhen she saw Imgani she stopped dead, and the fear of death and worse\ncame in her eyes, for she knew him to be an outcast man, with no tribe\nand no people. Such men are more dreadful than the ingali, who rears up\nfrom the grass and plunges his poison-fangs in your leg.\n\nThey stood watching one another, the man leaning with both hands on the\nspears, his cheek against them; the girl trembled.\n\n\"Woman, where do you go?\" said Imgani.\n\n\"Master, I go to the village which is by the river, this being the\npath,\" she flurried.\n\n\"What have you there?\"\n\n\"Manioc, for bread,\" she whispered thickly.\n\n\"You are a root-eater,\" said Imgani, nodding his head.\n\n\"Master, let me go,\" she said, staring at him.\n\nImgani jerked his head.\n\n\"I see you are afraid of me--yet I want nothing from you,\" he said. \"I\nam Imgani, which means the Lonely One; and I have no desire for wives or\nwomen, being too high a man for such folly. You are safe, root-eater,\nfor if I wished I would fill this forest with the daughters of chiefs,\nall very beautiful, all moaning for me.\"\n\nThe girl's fear had disappeared, and she looked at him curiously.\nMoreover, she recognised that there was truth in his claim of austerity.\nPossibly she was a little piqued, for she said tartly enough, employing\nan Isisi proverb:\n\n\"Only the goat bleats at the mouth of the leopard's cave--the Isisi grow\nfat on strangers.\"\n\nHe looked at her, his head cocked on one side.\n\n\"They say in the lower country that the Isisi sell men to the Arabi,\" he\nsaid musingly. \"That is bad talk; you may go.\"\n\nWith another jerk of his head he dismissed her.\n\nShe had gone some little distance when he called her back.\n\n\"Root-eater,\" he said, \"if men ask you who I be, you shall say that I am\nImgani the Lonely One, who is a prince amongst the princes; also that I\nhave killed many men in my day--so many that I cannot count them. Also\nsay that from my house, which I have built by the river, to as far as a\nman can see in every way, is my kingdom, and let none stray therein,\nexcept to bring gifts in their hands, for I am very terrible and very\njealous.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the girl, \"I will say all this.\"\n\nAnd she went, half running, in the direction of the village, leaving\nImgani to continue on his way.\n\nNow this village had many young men eager to please the girl, who\ncarried manioc, for she was a chief's daughter, and she was, moreover,\nfourteen, a marriageable age. So when she came flying along the village\nstreet, half hysterical in her fear, crying, babbling, incoherent, there\nwas not wanting sympathy nor knight valiant to wipe out the insult.\n\nSix young men, with spears and short swords, danced before the chief and\nthe chief's daughter (how important she felt, any woman of any race will\ntell you), and one of them, E'kebi, a man gifted with language,\ndescribed from sunset to moonrise, which is roughly four hours, exactly\nwhat would happen to Imgani when the men of the Isisi fell upon him; how\nhis eyes would shrivel as before a great and terrible fire, and his\nlimbs wither up, and divers other physiological changes which need not\nbe particularised.\n\n\"That is good talk,\" said the chief; \"yet, since Sandi is our master and\nhas spies everywhere, do not shed blood, for the smell of blood is\ncarried farther than a man can see. And Sandi is very devilish on this\nquestion of killing. Moreover, this Lonely One is a stranger, and if we\ncatch him we may sell him to the Arabi, who will give us cloth and gin\nfor him.\"\n\nHaving heard all this, they sacrificed a young goat and marched. They\ncame upon the house of Imgani, but the Lonely One was not there, for he\nwas trapping beasts in the forest; so they burnt his house, uprooted his\npoor garden, and, being joined by many other Isisi people, who had\nfollowed at a respectful distance, lest Imgani's estimate of his own\nprowess were justified by results, they held high revel, until of a\nsudden the sun came up over the middle island, and all the little stars\nin the sky went out.\n\nImgani saw all this, leaning on his spears in the shadow of the forest,\nbut was content to be a spectator.\n\nFor, he reasoned, if he went out against them they would attempt to kill\nhim or beat him with rods, and that his high spirit could not endure.\n\nHe saw the flames lick away the house he had built with such labour.\n\n\"They are foolish people,\" he mused, \"for they burn their own, and\nperhaps the spirits of the dead will be displeased and give them boils.\"\n\nWhen all that was left of his habitation was a white heap of ash, a\ndark-red glow, and a hazy wisp of smoke, Imgani turned his face to the\nforest.\n\nAll day long he walked, halting only to eat the fish he carried, and at\nnight time he came upon another Isisi village, which was called O'Fasi.\n\nHe came through the village street with his shoulders squared, his head\nerect, swinging his spears famously. He looked neither to the left nor\nto the right; and the villagers, crowding to the doors of their huts,\nput their clenched knuckles to their mouths, and said: \"O ho!\" which\nmeans that they were impressed.\n\nSo he stalked through the entire length of the village, and was making\nfor the forest-path beyond, when a messenger came pattering after him.\n\n\"Lord,\" said the messenger, \"the _capita_ of this village, who is\nresponsible to the Government for all people who pass, and especially\nfor thieves who may have escaped from the Village of Irons, desires your\npresence, being sure that you are no thief, but a great one, and wishing\nto do honour to you.\"\n\nThus he recited, and being a peaceable man, who had been chosen for the\npart because he was related by marriage to the principal wife of the\nchief, he kept a cautious eye on the broad-headed spear, and determined\nthe line of his flight.\n\n\"Go back to your master, slave,\" said Imgani, \"and say to him that I go\nto find a spot of sufficient loneliness, where I may sleep this night\nand occupy myself with high thoughts. When I have found such a place I\nwill return. Say, also, that I am a prince of my own people, and that my\nfather has legions of such quantity that, if every fighting man of the\nlegions were to take a handful of sand from the bottom of the river, the\nriver would be bottomless; also say that I am named Imgani, and that I\nlove myself better than any man has loved himself since the moon went\nwhite that it might not look like the sun.\"\n\nHe went on, leaving the messenger filled with thought.\n\nTrue to his promise, Imgani returned.\n\nHe came back to find that there was a palaver in progress, the subject\nof the palaver being the unfortunate relative by marriage to the chief's\nprincipal wife.\n\n\"Who,\" the chief was saying, \"has put shame upon me, being as great a\nfool as his cousin, my wife.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the poor relation humbly, \"I entreated him to return; but\nhe was a man of great pride, and, moreover, impatient to go.\"\n\n\"Your mother was a fool,\" said the chief; \"her mother also was a fool,\nand your father, whoever he was, and no man knows, was a great fool.\"\n\nThis interesting beginning to a crude address on hereditary folly was\ninterrupted by the return of Imgani, and as he came slowly up the little\nhillock the assembly took stock of him, from the square, steel razor\nstuck in the tight-fitting leopard-skin cap to the thin bangles of brass\nabout his ankles.\n\nThe chief, a portly man of no great courage, observed the spears, noting\nthat the hafts were polished smooth by much handling.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he mildly, \"I am chief of this village, appointed by the\nGovernment, who gave me a medal to wear about my neck, bearing on one\nside the picture of a great man with a beard, and on the other side\ncertain devil marks and writings of vast power. This was given to me\nthat all people might know I was chief, but I have lost the medal. None\nthe less, I am chief of this village, as this will show.\"\n\nHe fumbled in the bosom of his cloth and brought out a bag of snake\nskin, and from this he extracted a very soiled paper.\n\nWith tender care he unfolded it, and disclosed a sheet of official\nnotepaper with a few scrawled words in the handwriting of Mr.\nCommissioner Sanders. They ran:\n\n\"To all Sub-Commissioners, Police Officers, and Commanders of Houssa\nPorts:\n\n\"Arrest and detain the bearer if found in any other territory than the\nIsisi.\"\n\nThere was a history attached to this singular document. It had to do\nwith an unauthorised raid upon certain Ochori villages and a subsequent\ntrial at headquarters, where a chief, all aquiver with apprehension,\nlistened to a terse but knowledgable prophecy as to what fate awaited\nhim if he put foot out of his restricted dominion.\n\nImgani took the paper in his hand and was interested. He turned it\nabout, rubbed the writing lightly with his fingers to see whether it was\npermanent, and returned it to the chief.\n\n\"That is very wonderful, though I do not fear magic, except an especial\nkind such as is practised by a certain witch-doctor of my father's,\" he\nsaid; \"nor do I know any government which can govern me.\"\n\nAfter which he proceeded to tell them of his father, and of his legions\nand wives, and various other matters of equal interest.\n\n\"I do not doubt that you will understand me,\" he said. \"I am a Lonely\nOne, hating the company of men, who are as changeable as the snow upon\nthe mountains. Therefore, I have left my house with my wives, who were\nfaithful as women go, and I have taken with me no legion, since they are\nmy father's.\"\n\nThe chief was puzzled.\n\n\"Why you are lonely, I cannot tell,\" he said; \"but certainly you did\nright to leave your father's legions. This is a great matter, which\nneeds a palaver of older men.\"\n\nAnd he ordered the _lo-koli_ to be sounded and the elders of the village\nto be assembled.\n\nThey came, bringing their own carved stools, and sat about the thatched\nshelter, where the chief sat in his presidency.\n\nAgain Imgani told his story; it was about fifty wives, and legions of\nwarriors as countless as the sand of the river's beach; and the trustful\nIsisi listened and believed.\n\n\"And I need this,\" said Imgani, in his peroration; \"a little house built\non the edge of the river, in such a place that no path passes me and no\nhuman being comes within sight of me, for I am very lonely by\nnature--and a great hater of men.\"\n\nImgani went to live in the clearing Nature had made for him, and in a\nhut erected by his new-found friends. Other hospitalities he refused.\n\n\"I have no wish for wives,\" he stated, \"being full of mighty plans to\nrecover my kingdom from evil men who are my father's councillors.\"\n\nLonely he was in very truth, for none saw him except on very special\noccasions. It was his practice to go hunting by night and to sleep away\nthe hot days. Sometimes, when the red ball of the sun dropped down\nbehind the trees on the western bank of the river, the villagers saw the\nstraight, blue film of his smoke as he cooked his evening meal;\nsometimes a homeward-bound boatman saw him slipping silently through the\nthin edge of the forest on his way to a kill.\n\nThey called him the Silent One, and he enjoyed a little fame.\n\nMore than this, he enjoyed the confidence of his hosts. The Isisi\ncountry is within reach of the Foreign River, down which\nstrangely-shaped boats come by night empty, and return by night full of\npeople who are chained neck to neck, and the officials of French West\nAfrica--which adjoins the Isisi country--receive stories of raids and of\nburnings which they have not the facilities for investigating, for the\nIsisi border is nearly six hundred miles from the French headquarters,\nand lies through a wilderness.\n\nImgani, in his hunting trips, saw things which might have filled him\nwith amazement, but for the fact that he was a man who was not given to\nemotion.\n\nHe saw little caravans that came stealing from the direction of the\nterritory of France, with whimpering women and groaning men in bondage.\n\nHe saw curious midnight shippings of human souls, and grew to know the\nwhite-robed Arabs who handled the whip so deftly.\n\nOne night as he stood watching all these things, El Mahmud, that famous\ntrader, espied him in the moonlight and saw that he was of a strange\npeople.\n\n\"What man are you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Imgani, \"I am of a strange people--the N'Gombi.\"\n\n\"That is a lie,\" said the slaver, \"for you have not the face marks of\nthe N'Gombi; you are a half-bred Arab,\" and he addressed him in Arabic.\n\nImgani shook his head.\n\n\"He does not understand,\" said the slaver to his lieutenant; \"find out\nwhere this man's hut is; one night we will take him, for he is worth\nmoney.\"\n\nHe spoke in Arabic, and his subordinate nodded.\n\nWhen the slaver came again three men visited Imgani's house, but he was\nhunting, and he was hunting every time the long boats came by night to\nO'Fasi.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nSanders did not go to O'Fasi for six months, during which time, it\nshould be emphasised, nothing happened which by any stretch of\nimagination could be held to justify any loss of prestige.\n\nHe was due to make his half-yearly visit to the Isisi. The crops had\nbeen good, the fish plentiful, the rains gentle, and there had been no\nsickness. All these facts you may bear in mind.\n\nOne morning, when swirls of grey mist looped from tree to tree and the\neast was growing grey, Imgani came back from the forest bearing on his\nshoulders all that was material of a small buck which he had snared in\nthe night.\n\nWhen he saw a little fire before his hut and a man squatting chin on\nknee, he twirled those spears of his cheerfully and went on, for he was\nafraid of no man.\n\n\"Is the world so full of people that you come to disturb my loneliness?\"\nhe asked. \"I have a thought that I shall kill you and fry your heart,\nfor I do not like to see you sitting by a fire before my hut.\"\n\nHe said all this with a ferocious mien, and the man before the fire\nshifted uneasily.\n\n\"Master, I expected this,\" he said, \"for I see you are a proud man; but\nI come because of your pride, knowing your wisdom.\"\n\nImgani tossed the buck to one side and sat down, staring threateningly\nand laying the haft of his spears across his bare knee.\n\nThen the other man craned his neck forward and spoke eagerly.\n\nThe sun came up and flushed the world rosy; but still he sat talking\nwith great force, Imgani listening.\n\n\"So, master,\" he concluded, \"we will kill Sandi when he comes to\npalaver. Ifiba, M'bwka, and a cousin of my mother's, will put spears\ninto him very quickly, and we shall be a great people.\"\n\nImgani nodded his head wisely.\n\n\"That is true,\" he said, \"people who kill white men must be greatly\nhonoured, because all the other nations will say: 'Behold, these are the\npeople who kill white men!'\"\n\n\"And when he is dead,\" the messenger went on, \"many young men will go to\nthe boat that smokes and slay all who are with him.\"\n\n\"That is wise also,\" said Imgani; \"when I kill white men I also kill\ntheir friends.\"\n\nHe discussed his deeds to some length and with great detail. After the\nman had gone, Imgani made a meal of fish and manioc, polished the steel\nblades of his spears with wet sand, dried them carefully with grass, and\nlaid himself down in the shade of the hut to sleep.\n\nHe was awake in the early part of the afternoon, and went plunging into\nthe river, swimming far towards the middle stream with great, strong\nstrokes.\n\nThen he swam back to shore, let the sun dry him, and dressed himself in\nhis leopard skin.\n\nHe came to the village slowly, and found it agitated. More especially so\nwas the chief, that wise _capita_, for news had arrived that Sandi was\ncoming in the night, and that even now his steamer was rounding the bend\nof the river.\n\nA plan had miscarried; Sanders was two days ahead of time, and Ifiba and\nM'bwka, his trusty men, were away on an expedition, and there was no\ntime to substitute unseasoned assassins.\n\nThe steamer drifted broadside to the shore, one stern wheel revolving\nlazily, and then they saw, Imgani amongst the rest, that the decks were\ncrowded with soldiers, impassive brown men in blue uniforms and fezes.\n\nA plank bumped down, and holding their rifles high the soldiers came\npattering to the shore, and with them a white officer but not Sandi.\n\nIt was a brusque, white man.\n\n\"Who is the chief here?\" he said crossly.\n\n\"Lord, I am that man,\" said the stout chief, all a-flutter.\n\n\"Take that man.\"\n\nA sergeant of Houssas grasped the chief and deftly swung him round; a\ncorporal of Houssas snapped a pair of handcuffs on his wrists.\n\n\"Lord,\" he whined, \"why this shame?\"\n\n\"Because you are a great thief,\" said the Houssa officer, \"a provoker of\nwar and a dealer in slaves.\"\n\n\"If any man says that, it is a lie,\" said the chief, \"for no Government\nman has witnessed such abominations.\"\n\nImgani stepped forward.\n\n\"Chief,\" he said, \"I have seen it.\"\n\n\"You are a great liar,\" fumed the portly _capita_, trembling with rage,\n\"and Sandi, who is my friend, will not believe you.\"\n\n\"I am Sandi,\" said Imgani, and smiled crookedly.\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER XIII.\n\n  THE SEER.\n\n\nThere are many things that happen in the very heart of Africa that no\nman can explain; that is why those who know Africa best hesitate to\nwrite stories about it.\n\nBecause a story about Africa must be a mystery story, and your reader of\nfiction requires that his mystery shall be, in the end, X-rayed so that\nthe bones of it are visible.\n\nYou can no more explain many happenings which are the merest\ncommonplaces in latitude 2 N., longitude (say) 46 W., than you can\nexplain the miracle of faith, or the wonder of telepathy, as this story\ngoes to show.\n\nIn the dead of a night Mr. Commissioner Sanders woke.\n\nHis little steamer was tied up by a wooding--a wooding he had prepared\nfor himself years before by lopping down trees and leaving them to rot.\n\n\nHe was one day's steam either up or down the river from the nearest\nvillage, but he was only six hours' march from the Amatombo folk, who\nlive in the very heart of the forest, and employ arrows poisoned by\ntetanus.\n\nSanders sat up in bed and listened.\n\nA night bird chirped monotonously; he heard the \"clug-clug\" of water\nunder the steamer's bows and the soft rustling of leaves as a gentle\nbreeze swayed the young boughs of the trees that overhung the boat. Very\nintently he listened, then reached down for his mosquito boots and his\nsocks.\n\nHe drew them on, found his flannel coat hanging behind the door of his\ntiny cabin, and opened the door softly. Then he waited, standing, his\nhead bent.\n\nIn the darkness he grinned unpleasantly, and, thumbing back the leather\nstrap that secured the flap of the holster which hung by his bunk he\nslipped out the Colt-automatic, and noiselessly pulled back the steel\nenvelope.\n\nHe was a careful man, not easily flurried, and his every movement was\nmethodical. He was cautious enough to push up the little safety-catch\nwhich prevents premature explosion, tidy enough to polish the black\nbarrel on the soft sleeve of his coat, and he waited a long time before\nhe stepped out into the hot darkness of the night.\n\nBy and by he heard again the sound which had aroused him. It was the\nfaint twitter of a weaver bird.\n\nNow weaver birds go to sleep at nights like sensible people, and they\nlive near villages, liking the society of human beings. Certainly they\ndo not advertise their presence so brazenly as did this bird, who\ntwittered and twittered at intervals.\n\nSanders watched patiently.\n\nThen suddenly, from close at hand, from the very deck on which he stood,\ncame an answering call.\n\nSanders had his little cabin on the bridge of the steamer; he walked\nfarther away from it. In the corner of the bridge he crouched down, his\nthumb on the safety-catch.\n\nHe felt, rather than saw, a man come from the forest; he knew that there\nwas one on board the steamer who met him.\n\nThen creeping round the deck-house came two men. He could just discern\nthe bulk of them as they moved forward till they found the door of the\ncabin and crept in. He heard a little noise, and grinned again, though\nhe knew that their spear-heads were making sad havoc of his bedclothes.\n\nThen there was a little pause, and he saw one come out by himself and\nlook around.\n\nHe turned to speak softly to the man inside.\n\nSanders rose noiselessly.\n\nThe man in the doorway said \"Kah!\" in a gurgling voice and went down\nlimply, because Sanders had kicked him scientifically in the stomach,\nwhich is a native's weak spot. The second man ran out, but fell with a\ncrash over the Commissioner's extended leg, and, falling, received the\nfull weight of a heavy pistol barrel in the neighbourhood of his right\near.\n\n\"Yoka!\" called Sanders sharply, and there was a patter of feet aft, for\nyour native is a light sleeper, \"tie these men up. Get steam, for we\nwill go away from here; it is not a nice place.\"\n\nSanders, as I have tried to explain, was a man who knew the native; he\nthought like a native, and there were moments when he acted not unlike a\nbarbarian.\n\nClear of the danger, he tied up to a little island in mid-stream just as\nthe dawn spread greyly, and hustled his two prisoners ashore.\n\n\"My men,\" said he, \"you came to kill me in the dark hours.\"\n\n\"Lord, that is true,\" said one, \"I came to kill, and this other man, who\nis my brother, told me when to come--yet it might have been another whom\nhe called, for I am but one of many.\"\n\nSanders accepted the fact that a chain of cheerful assassins awaited his\nadvent without any visible demonstration of annoyance.\n\n\"Now you will tell me,\" he said, \"who gave the word for the killing, and\nwhy I must die.\"\n\nThe man he addressed, a tall, straight youth of the Amatombo people,\nwiped the sweat from his forehead with his manacled hands.\n\n\"Lord, though you chop me,\" he said, \"I will not tell you, for I have a\ngreat ju-ju, and there are certain fetishes which would be displeased.\"\n\nSanders tried the other man with no greater success. This other was a\nlabourer he had taken on at a village four days' journey down stream.\n\n\"Lord, if I die for my silence I will say nothing,\" he said.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Sanders, and nodded his head to Abiboo. \"I shall stake\nyou out,\" he added, \"flat on the ground, your legs and arms\noutstretched, and I will light a little fire on your chests, and by and\nby you will tell me all I want to know.\"\n\nStaked out they were, with fluffy little balls of dried creeper on each\nbreast, and Sanders took a lighted stick from the fire his servants had\nbuilt.\n\nThe men on the ground watched his every movement. They saw him blow the\nred stick to a flame and advance toward them, then one said--\n\n\"Lord, I will speak.\"\n\n\"So I thought,\" said Sanders; \"and speak truth, or I will make you\nuncomfortable.\"\n\nIf you ask me whether Sanders would have employed his lighted stick, I\nanswer truthfully that I think it possible; perhaps Sanders knew his men\nbetter than I know Sanders.\n\nThe two men, released from their unhappy position, talked frankly, and\nSanders was a busy man taking notes in English of the conversation which\nwas mainly in Bomongo.\n\nWhen his interrogation was completed, Sanders gathered up his notes and\nhad the men taken on board the steamer. Two hours later the _Zaire_ was\nmoving at its fullest speed in the direction of a village of the\nAkasava, which is called in the native tongue Tukalala.\n\nThere was a missionary to Tukalala, a devoted young American Methodist,\nwho had elected to live in the fever belt amongst heathen men that he\nmight bring their hearts to the knowledge of God.\n\nSanders had no special regard for missionaries; indeed, he had views on\nthe brotherhood which did him no particular credit, but he had an\naffection for the young man who laboured so cheerfully with such\nunpromising material, and now he paced the little bridge of his steamer\nimpatiently, for it was very necessary that he should reach Tukalala\nbefore certain things happened.\n\nHe came round a bend of the little river just as the sun was going down\nbehind the trees on the western bank, and the white beach before the\nmission station showed clearly.\n\nHe motioned with two fingers to the man at the wheel, and the little\nsteamer swung almost broadside to the swift stream and headed for the\nbank, and the black water of the river humped up against his port bow as\nthough it were a sluice gate.\n\nInto the beach he steamed; \"pucka-pucka-pucka-puck,\" sang the stern\nwheel noisily.\n\nWhere the missionary's house had stood was a chaos of blackened debris,\nand out of it rose lazy little wisps of smoke.\n\nHe found the missionary dressed in white duck, greatly soiled, lying\nface downwards, and he found some difficulty in raising him, because he\nwas pinned to the ground with a broad-bladed elephant spear which had\nbeen broken off flush with his shoulders.\n\nSanders turned him on his back, closed the patient's eyes, staring, it\nseemed, hungrily at the darkening sky as though at the last questioning\nGod's wisdom.\n\nThe Commissioner took a gaudy bandana handkerchief from his pocket, and\nlaid it on the dead man's face.\n\n\"Abiboo,\" he said softly to his sergeant, \"dig me a great hole by that\ncopal gum, for this man was a great chief amongst his people, and had\ncommunion with gods.\"\n\n\"He was a Christ man,\" said Abiboo sagely, who was a devout follower of\nthe Prophet, \"and in the Sura of Mary it is written:\n\n    \"'The sects have fallen to variance about Jesus, but woe,\n    because of the assembly of a great day to those who believe\n    not!'\"\n\nAbiboo bore the title of Haj because he had been to Mecca and knew the\nKoran better than most Christians know the Bible.\n\nSanders said nothing. He took a cigar from his pocket and lit it,\ncasting his eyes around.\n\nNo building stood. Where the mission station with its trim garden had\nbeen, was desolation. He saw scraps of cloth in the fading light. These\nwere other victims, he knew.\n\nIn the mellow light of the moon he buried the missionary, saying the\nLord's Prayer over him, and reciting as much of the Burial Service as he\ncould remember.\n\nThen he went back to the _Zaire_ and set a guard. In the morning Sanders\nturned the nose of the _Zaire_ down stream, and at sunset came to the\nbig river--he had been sailing a tributary--and where the two rivers\nmeet is the city of the Akasava.\n\nThey brought the paramount chief of all the people to him, and there was\na palaver on the little bridge with a lantern placed on the deck and one\nlimp candle therein to give light to the assembly.\n\n\"Chief,\" said Sanders, \"there is a dead white man in your territory, and\nI will have the hearts of the men who killed him, or by The Death I will\nhave your head.\"\n\nHe said this evenly, without passion, yet he swore by _Ewa_, which means\ndeath and is a most tremendous oath. The chief, squatting on the deck,\nfidgeting with his hands, shivered.\n\n\"Lord,\" he said, in a cracked voice, \"this is a business of which I know\nnothing; this thing has happened in my territory, but so far from my\nhand that I can neither punish nor reward.\"\n\nSanders was silent save for an unsympathetic sniff.\n\n\"Also, master,\" said the chief, \"if the truth be told, this palaver is\nnot of the Akasava alone, for all along the big river men are\nrebellious, obeying a new ju-ju more mighty than any other.\"\n\n\"I know little of ju-jus,\" said Sanders shortly, \"only I know that a\nwhite man has died and his spirit walks abroad and will not rest until I\nhave slain men. Whether it be you or another I do not care--the palaver\nis finished.\"\n\nThe chief rose awkwardly, brought up his hand in salute, and went\nshuffling down the sloping plank to land.\n\nAs for Sanders, he sat thinking, smoking one cigar after another. He sat\nlong into the night. Once he called his servant to replace the candle in\nthe lantern and bring him a cushion for his head. He sat there until the\nbuzzing little village hushed to sleep, until there was no sound but the\nwhispering of bat wings as they came and went from the middle\nisland--for bats love islands, especially the big vampire bats.\n\nAt two o'clock in the morning he looked at his watch, picked up the\nlantern, and walked aft.\n\nHe picked a way over sleeping men until he came to that part of the deck\nwhere a Houssa squatted with loaded carbine watching the two prisoners.\n\n\nHe stirred them gently with his foot, and they sat up blinking at his\nlight.\n\n\"You must tell me some more,\" he said. \"How came this bad ju-ju to your\nland?\"\n\nThe man he addressed looked up at him.\n\n\"Lord, how comes rain or wind?\" he said. \"It was a sudden thought\namongst the people. There were certain rites and certain dances, and we\nchopped a man; then we all painted our faces with camwood, and the\nmaidens said 'Kill!'\"\n\nSanders could be very patient.\n\n\"I am as your father and your mother,\" he said. \"I carry you in my arms;\nwhen the waters came up and destroyed your gardens I came with manioc\nand salt and saved you; when the sickness came I brought white men who\nscraped your arms and put magic in your blood; I have made peace, and\nyour wives are safe from M'Gombi and Isisi folk, yet you are for killing\nme.\"\n\nThe other nodded.\n\n\"That is true talk, master--but such is the way of ju-jus. They are very\nHigh Things, and do not remember.\"\n\nSanders was worried; this matter was out of his reach. \"What said the\nju-ju?\"\n\n\"Lord, it said very clearly, speaking through the mouth of an old man,\nM'fabaka of Begeli----\"\n\n\"M'fabaka of Begeli?\" repeated Sanders softly, and noted the name for a\nspeedy hanging.\n\n\"This old man saw a vision, and in this vision, which he saw with great\npain and foaming at the mouth and hot eyeballs, he saw white men slain\nby black men and their houses burnt.\"\n\n\"When was this?\"\n\n\"When the moon was full\"--six days ago, thought Sanders--\"and he saw a\ngreat king with many legions marching through the land making all white\nmen fear him.\"\n\nHe went on to give, as only a native memory can recall, the minutest\ndetail of the king's march; how he slew white men and women and put\ntheir house to flames; how his legions went dancing before him.\n\n\"And all this happened at the full of the moon,\" he finished; \"therefore\nwe, too, went out to slay, and, knowing that your Highness would be\ncoming as is your custom to give judgment at this season of the year, it\nwas thought wise to kill you, also the Christ-man.\"\n\nHe told all this in a matter-of-fact tone, and Sanders knew that he\nspoke the truth.\n\nAnother man would have been more affected by that portion of the\nnarrative which touched him most nearly, but it was the king (\"a great\nman, very large about the middle\"), and his devastating legions who\noccupied the Commissioner's thoughts.\n\nThere was truth behind this, he did not doubt that. There was a rising\nsomewhere that he had not heard of; very quickly he passed in mental\nreview the kings of the adjoining territories and of his own lands.\n\nBosambo of Monrovia, that usurper of the Ochori chieftainship, sent him\nfrom time to time news of the outlying peoples. There was no war, north\nor south or east.\n\n\"I will see this old man M'fabaka of Begeli,\" he said.\n\nBegeli is a village that lies on an in-running arm of the river, so\nnarrow that it seems like a little river, so still that it is apparently\na lake. Forests of huge trees slope down on either bank, and the trees\nare laced one to the other with great snake-like tendrils, and skirted\nat foot with rank undergrowth. The _Zaire_ came cautiously down this\nstretch of calm water, two Maxim guns significantly displayed at the\nbridge.\n\nA tiny little steamer this _Zaire_. She had the big blue of England\ndrooping from the flagstaff high above the stern wheel--an ominous sign,\nfor when Sanders flew the Commissioner's flag it meant trouble for\nsomebody.\n\nHe stood on the deck coatless, signalling with his raised fingers to the\nman at the wheel.\n\n\"Phew!\" An arrow was shivering in the wooden deck-house. He pulled it\nout and examined its hammered steel point carefully, then he threw it\noverboard.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA puff of smoke from the veiling foliage--a bullet splintered the back\nof his deck-chair.\n\nHe reached down and took up a rifle, noticed the drift of the smoke and\ntook careful aim.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThere was no sign to show where the bullet struck, and the only sound\nthat came back was the echo and the shrill swish of it as it lashed its\nway through the green bushes.\n\nThere was no more shooting.\n\n\"Puck-apuck-puck-apuck-puck,\" went the stern wheel slowly, and the bows\nof the _Zaire_ clove the calm waters and left a fan of foam behind.\nBefore the village was in view six war canoes, paddling abreast, came\nout to meet the Commissioner. He rang the engines to \"Stop,\" and as the\nnoise of them died away he could hear in the still air the beating of\ndrums; through his glasses he saw fantastically-painted bodies, also a\nhead stuck upon a spear.\n\nThere had been a trader named Ogilvie in this part of the world, a mild,\nuncleanly man who sold cloth and bought wild rubber.\n\n\"Five hundred yards,\" said Sanders, and Sergeant Abiboo, fiddling with\nthe grip of the port Maxim, gave the cartridge belt a little pull, swung\nthe muzzle forward, and looked earnestly along the sights. At the same\ntime the Houssa corporal, who stood by the tripod of the starboard gun,\nsat down on the little saddle seat of it with his thumb on the control.\n\nThere came a spurt of smoke from the middle canoe; the bullet fell\nshort.\n\n\"Ogilvie, my man,\" soliloquised Sanders, \"if you are alive--which I am\nsure you are not--you will explain to me the presence of these\nSchneiders.\"\n\nNearer came the canoes, the paddle plunging rhythmically, a low, fierce\ndrone of song accompanying the movement.\n\n\"Four hundred yards,\" said Sanders, and the men at the Maxims readjusted\nthe sights.\n\n\"The two middle canoes,\" said Sanders. \"Fire!\"\n\nA second pause.\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!\" laughed the guns sardonically.\n\nSanders watched the havoc through his glasses.\n\n\"The other canoes,\" he said briefly.\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!\"\n\nThis gunner was a careful man, and fired spasmodically, desiring to see\nthe effects of his shots.\n\nSanders saw men fall, saw one canoe sway and overturn, and the black\nheads of men in the water; he rang the steamer ahead full speed.\n\nSomebody fired a shot from one of the uninjured canoes. The wind of the\nbullet fanned his face, he heard the smack of it as it struck the\nwoodwork behind.\n\nThere came another shot, and the boy at the wheel turned his head with a\nlittle grin to Sanders.\n\n\"Lord,\" he mumbled in Arabic, \"this was ordained from the beginning.\"\n\nSanders slipped his arm about his shoulder and lowered him gently to the\ndeck.\n\n\"All things are with God,\" he said softly.\n\n\"Blessed be His name,\" whispered the dying boy.\n\nSanders caught the wheel as it spun and beckoned another steersman\nforward.\n\nThe nose of the steamer had turned to the offending canoe. This was an\nunhappy circumstance for the men therein, for both guns now covered it,\nand they rattled together, and through the blue haze you saw the canoe\nemptied.\n\nThat was the end of the fight. A warrior in the fifth boat held his\nspear horizontally above his head in token of surrender, and ten minutes\nlater the chief of the rebels was on board.\n\n\"Master,\" he said calmly, as they led him to Sanders' presence, \"this is\na bad palaver. How will you deal with me?\"\n\nSanders looked at him steadily.\n\n\"I will be merciful with you,\" he said, \"for as soon as we come to the\nvillage I shall hang you.\"\n\n\"So I thought,\" said the chief without moving a muscle; \"and I have\nheard it said that you hang men very quickly so that they feel little\npain.\"\n\n\"That is my practice,\" said Sanders of the River, and the chief nodded\nhis head approvingly.\n\n\"I would rather it were so,\" he said.\n\nIt was to a sorrowful village that he came, for there were many women to\nwail their dead.\n\nSanders landed with his Houssas and held a high palaver under the trees.\n\n\"Bring me the old man M'fabaka who sees visions,\" he said, and they\nbrought him a man so old that he had nothing but bones to shape him.\n\nThey carried him to the place of justice and set him down before the\nCommissioner.\n\n\"You are an evil man,\" said Sanders, \"and because your tongue has lied\nmany men have died; to-day I hang your chief upon a tree, and with him\ncertain others. If you stand before your people and say, 'Such a story,\nand such a story was a lie and no other thing,' you may live your days;\nbut, if you persist in your lying, by my God, and your god, you shall\ndie!\"\n\nIt was a long time before the old man spoke, for he was very old and\nvery frightened, and the fear of death, which is the ghost of some old\nmen, was on him.\n\n\"I spoke the truth,\" he quavered at last. \"I spoke of what I saw and of\nwhat I knew--only that.\" Sanders waited.\n\n\"I saw the great king slay and burn; yesterday I saw him march his\nregiments to war, and there was a great shouting, and I saw smoke.\"\n\nHe shook his head helplessly.\n\n\"I saw these things. How can I say I saw nothing?\"\n\n\"What manner of king?\" asked Sanders.\n\nAgain there was a long interval of silence whilst the old man collected\nhimself.\n\n\"A great king,\" he said shakily, \"as big as a bull about the middle, and\nhe wore great, white feathers and the skin of a leopard.\"\n\n\"You are mad,\" said Sanders, and ended the palaver.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nSix days later Sanders went back to headquarters, leaving behind him a\nchastened people.\n\nIll-news travels faster than steam can push a boat, and the little\n_Zaire_, keeping to mid-stream with the blue flag flying, was an object\nof interest to many small villages, the people of which crowded down to\ntheir beaches and stood with folded arms, or with clenched knuckles at\ntheir lips to signify their perturbation, and shouted in monotonous\nchorus after the boat.\n\n\"Oh, Sandi--father! How many evil ones have you slain to-day? Oh, killer\nof devils--oh, hanger of trees!--we are full of virtues and do not\nfear.\"\n\n\"Ei-fo, Kalaba? Ei ko Sandi! Eiva fo elegi,\" etc.\n\nSanders went with the stream swiftly, for he wished to establish\ncommunication with his chief. Somewhere in the country there was a\nrevolt--that he knew.\n\nThere was truth in all the old man had said before he died--for die he\ndid of sheer panic and age.\n\nWho was this king in revolt? Not the king of the Isisi, or of the\nM'Gombi, nor of the people in the forelands beyond the Ochori.\n\nThe _Zaire_ went swinging in to the Government beach, and there was a\ncaptain of Houssas to meet him.\n\n\"Land wire working?\" said Sanders as he stepped ashore.\n\nThe Houssa captain nodded.\n\n\"What's the palaver?\" he asked.\n\n\"War of a kind,\" said Sanders; \"some king or other is on the rampage.\"\n\nAnd he told the story briefly.\n\nThe Houssa officer whistled.\n\n\"By Lord High Keeper of the Privy Purse!\" he swore mildly, \"that's\nfunny!\"\n\n\"You've a poisonous sense of humour!\" Sanders snapped.\n\n\"Hold hard,\" said the Houssa, and caught his arm. \"Don't you know that\nLo Benguela is in rebellion? The description fits him.\"\n\nSanders stopped.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, and breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"But,\" said the perplexed Houssa officer, \"Matabeleland is three\nthousand miles away. Rebellion started a week ago. How did these beggars\nknow?\"\n\nFor answer Sanders beckoned a naked man of the Akasava people who was of\nhis boat's crew, being a good chopper of wood.\n\n\"I'fasi,\" he said, \"tell me, what do they do in your country to-day?\"\nThe man grinned sheepishly, and stood on one leg in his embarrassment,\nfor it was an honour to common men that Sanders should address them by\nname.\n\n\"Lord, they go to hunt elephant,\" he said.\n\n\"How many?\" said Sanders.\n\n\"Two villages,\" said the man, \"for one village has sickness and cannot\ngo.\"\n\n\"How do you know this?\" said Sanders. \"Is not your country four days by\nriver and three days by land?\"\n\nThe man looked uncomfortable.\n\n\"It is as you say, master--yet I know,\" he said.\n\nSanders turned to the Houssa with a smile.\n\n\"There is quite a lot to be learnt in this country,\" he said.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\nA month later Sanders received a cutting from the _Cape Times_. The part\nwhich interested him ran:\n\n\" . . . the rumour generally credited by the Matabele rebels that their\nadherents in the north had suffered a repulse lacks confirmation. The\nCommissioner of Barotseland denies the native story of a rebellious\ntribe, and states that as far as he knows the whole of his people have\nremained quiet. Other northern Commissioners state the same. There has\nbeen no sympathetic rising, though the natives are emphatic that in a\n'far-away land,' which they cannot define, such a rebellion has\noccurred. The idea is, of course, absurd.\" Sanders smiled again.\n\n\n\n\n  CHAPTER THE LAST.\n\n  DOGS OF WAR.\n\n\nChiefest of the restrictions placed upon the black man by his white\nprotector is that which prevents him, when his angry passions rise, from\ntaking his enemy by the throat and carving him with a broad, curved\nblade of native make. Naturally, even the best behaved of the tribes\nchafe under this prohibition the British have made.\n\nYou may be sure that the Akasava memory is very short, and the\npunishment which attended their last misdoing is speedily forgotten in\nthe opportunity and the temptation which must inevitably come as the\nyears progress. Thus, the Akasava, learning of certain misdoings on the\npart of the Ochori, found themselves in the novel possession of a\ngenuine grievance, and prepared for war, first sending a message to\n\"Sandi,\" setting forth at some length the nature of the insult the\nOchori had offered them. Fortunately, Sanders was in the district, and\ncame on the spot very quickly, holding palaver, and soothing an outraged\nnation as best he could. Sanders was a tactful man, and tact does not\nnecessarily imply soft-handedness. For there was a truculent soul who\nsat in the council and interpolated brusque questions.\n\nGrowing bolder as the Commissioner answered suavely, he went, as a child\nor native will, across the border line which divides a good manner from\na bad. Sanders turned on him.\n\n\"What base-born slave dog are you?\" he asked; and whilst the man was\ncarefully considering his answer, Sanders kicked him down the slope of\nthe hill on which the palaver house stood, and harmony was once more\nrestored.\n\nVery soon on the heels of this palaver came a bitter complaint from the\nIsisi. It concerned fishing nets that had been ruthlessly destroyed by\nthe Lulungo folk, and this was a more difficult matter for Sanders to\nsettle. For one thing, all self-respecting people hate the Lulungo, a\ndour, wicked, mischievous people, without shame or salt. But the Isisi\nwere pacified, and a messy war was averted. There were other and minor\nalarums--all these were in the days' work--but Sanders worried about the\nLulungo, because of their general badness, and because of all his\npeople, Isisi, Ikeli, Akasava, and Ochori, who hated the Lulungo folk\nwith a deep-rooted hatred. In his own heart, Sanders knew that war could\nonly be postponed, and so advised London, receiving in reply, from an\nagitated Under-Secretary in Whitehall, the urgent request that the\npostponement should cover and extend beyond the conclusion of \"the\npresent financial year--for heaven's sake!\"\n\nThey had a proverb up in the Lulungo district--three days' march beyond\nthe Akasava--and it is to this effect: \"When a man hath a secret enemy\nand cannot find him, pull down his own hut and search among the dbris.\"\nThis is a cumbersome translation. There is another proverb which says,\n\"Because of the enemy who lives in the shadow of your hut\"; also another\nwhich says, \"If you cannot find your enemy, kill your dearest friend.\"\nThe tendency of all these proverbs is to show that the Lulungo people\ntook a gloomy view of life, and were naturally suspicious.\n\nSanders had a cook of the Lulungo tribe, down at M'piti--which model\ncity served as Mr. Commissioner's headquarters. He was a wanderer, and\nby way of being a cosmopolitan, having travelled as far north as Dacca,\nand as far south as Banana--and presumably up the Congo to Matadi. When\nhe came to M'piti, applying for work, he was asked his name and replied\nin the \"English\" of the Coast:\n\n\"Master, dey one call me Sixpence all'time. I make 'um cook fine; you\nlook 'um for better cook, you no find 'um--savvy.\"\n\n\"And what,\" said Sanders, in the Lulungo dialect, \"what mongrel talk do\nyou call this?\"\n\n\"Master, it is English,\" said the abashed native.\n\n\"It is monkey talk,\" said Sanders, cruelly; \"the talk of krooboys and\nhalf-bred sailors who have no language. What are you called by your\npeople?\"\n\n\"Lataki, master,\" said the cook.\n\n\"So shall you be called,\" said Sanders. \"Further, you shall speak no\nlanguage but your own, and your pay will be ten shillings a month.\"\n\nLataki made a good cook, and was a model citizen for exactly three\nmonths, at the end of which time Sanders, returning unexpectedly from a\nhunting trip, found Lataki asleep in his master's bed--Lataki being very\ndrunk, and two empty gin bottles by the bedside testifying mutely to his\ndiscredit. Sanders called his police, and Lataki was thrown into the\nlock-up to sober down, which he did in twenty-four hours.\n\n\"I would have you understand,\" said Sanders to the culprit the next day,\n\"that I cannot allow my servants to get drunk; more especially I cannot\nallow my drunken servants to sleep off their potations on my bed.\"\n\n\"Lord, I am ashamed,\" said Lataki cheerfully; \"such things happen to a\nman who has seen much of the world.\"\n\n\"You may say the same about the whipping you are about to receive,\" said\nSanders, and gave an order to the sergeant of police.\n\nLataki was no stoic and when, tied to a tree, ten strokes were laid upon\nhis stout back by a bored Houssa, he cried out very loudly against\nSanders, and against that civilisation of which Sanders was the chosen\ninstrument.\n\nAfter it was all over, and he had discovered that he was still alive,\nalbeit sore, he confessed he had received little more than he deserved,\nand promised tearfully that the lesson should not be without result.\nSanders, who had nothing more to say in the matter, dismissed him to his\nduties.\n\nIt was a week after this that the Commissioner was dining in solitude on\npalm-oil chop--which is a delicious kind of coast curry--and chicken. He\nhad begun his meal when he stopped suddenly, went to his office, and\nbrought in a microscope. Then he took a little of the \"chop\"--just as\nmuch as might go on the end of a pin--smeared it on a specimen glass,\nand focussed the instrument. What he saw interested him. He put away the\nmicroscope and sent for Lataki; and Lataki, in spotless white, came.\n\n\"Lataki,\" said Sanders carelessly, \"knowing the ways of white men, tell\nme how a master might do his servant honour?\"\n\nThe cook in the doorway hesitated.\n\n\"There are many ways,\" he said, after a pause. \"He might----\"\n\nHe stopped, not quite sure of his ground.\n\n\"Because you are a good servant, though possessed of faults,\" said\nSanders, \"I wish to honour you; therefore I have chosen this way; you,\nwho have slept in my bed unbidden, shall sit at my table with me at my\ncommand.\"\n\nThe man hesitated, a little bewildered, then he shuffled forward and sat\nclumsily in the chair opposite his master.\n\n\"I will wait upon you,\" said Sanders, \"according to the custom of your\nown people.\"\n\nHe heaped two large spoonfuls of palm-oil chop upon the plate before the\nman.\n\n\"Eat,\" he said.\n\nBut the man made no movement, sitting with his eyes upon the tablecloth.\n\n\"Eat,\" said Sanders again, but still Lataki sat motionless.\n\nThen Sanders rose, and went to the open doorway of his bungalow and blew\na whistle.\n\nThere was a patter of feet, and Sergeant Abiboo came with four Houssas.\n\n\"Take this man,\" said Sanders, \"and put him in irons. To-morrow I will\nsend him down country for judgment.\"\n\nHe walked back to the table, when the men had gone with their prisoner,\ncarefully removed the poisoned dish, and made a meal of eggs and\nbananas, into neither of which is it possible to introduce ground glass\nwithout running the risk of instant detection.\n\nGround glass--glass powdered so fine that it is like precipitated chalk\nto the touch--is a bad poison, because when it comes in contact with\ndelicate membranes right down inside a man, it lacerates them and he\ndies, as the bad men of the coast know, and have known for hundreds of\nyears. In the course of time Lataki came before a judge who sat in a big\nthatched barn of a courthouse, and Lataki brought three cousins, a\nbrother, and a disinterested friend, to swear that Sanders had put the\nglass in his own \"chop\" with malice aforethought. In spite of the\nunanimity of the evidence--the witnesses had no less than four\nrehearsals in a little hut the night before the trial--the prisoner was\nsentenced to fifteen years' penal servitude.\n\nHere the matter would have ended, but for the Lulungo people, who live\nfar away in the north, and who chose to regard the imprisonment of their\nman as a _casus belli_.\n\nThey were a suspicious people, a sullen, loveless, cruel people, and\nthey were geographically favoured, for they lived on the edge of a\nterritory which is indisputably French, and, moreover, unreachable.\n\nSanders sent flying messages to all the white people who lived within\nstriking distance of the Lulungo. There were six in all, made up of two\nmissions, Jesuit and Baptist. They were most unsatisfactory people, as\nthe following letters show:\n\nThe first from the Protestant:\n\n      \"Losebi Mission.\n\n    \"Dear Mr. Commissioner,--My wife and I are very grateful to you\n    for your warning, but God has called us to this place, and here\n    we must stay, going about our Master's business, until He, in\n    His wisdom, ordains that we shall leave the scene of our\n    labours.\"\n\nFather Holling wrote:\n      \"Ebendo River.\n\n    \"Dear Sanders,--I think you are wrong about the Lulungo people,\n    several of whom I have seen recently. They are mighty civil,\n    which is the only bad sign I have detected. I shall stay because\n    I think I can fight off any attack they make. I have four\n    Martini-Metford rifles, and three thousand rounds of ammunition,\n    and this house, as you know, is built of stone. I hope you are\n    wrong, but----\"\n\nSanders took his steamboat, his Maxim gun, and his Houssa police, and\nwent up the river, as far as the little stern-wheeler would carry him.\nAt the end of every day's journey he would come to a place where the\nforest had been cleared, and where, stacked on the beach, was an orderly\npile of wood. Somewhere in the forest was a village whose contribution\nto the State this ever-replenished wood-pile was. Night and day two\nsounding men with long rods, sitting at the steamer's bow, \"stubbed\" the\nwater monotonously. Shoal, sandbank, channel, shoal. Sometimes, with a\nshuddering jar, the boat would slide along the flat surface of a hidden\nbank, and go flop into the deep water on the other side; sometimes, in\nthe night, the boat would jump a bank to find itself in a little \"lake\"\nfrom which impassable ridges of hidden sand barred all egress. Then the\nmen would slip over the sides of the vessel and walk the sandy floor of\nthe river, pushing the steamer into deep water. When sixty miles from\nthe Baptist Mission, Sanders got news from a friendly native:\n\n\"Lord, the Lulungo came at early morning, taking away the missionary,\nhis wife, and his daughter, to their city.\"\n\nSanders, yellow with fever, heavy-eyed from want of sleep, unshaven and\ngrimy, wiped the perspiration from his head with the back of his hand.\n\n\"Take the steamer up the river,\" he said to Abiboo. \"I must sleep.\"\n\nHe was awakened at four o'clock in the afternoon by the smashing of a\nwater-bottle, which stood on a shelf by his bunk. It smashed for no\napparent reason, and he was sprinkled with bits of glass and gouts of\nwater.\n\nThen he heard a rifle go \"pang!\" close at hand, and as he sprang up and\nopened the wire-woven door of his cabin, Abiboo came to report.\n\n\"There were two men firing from the bank,\" he said. \"One I have shot.\"\n\nThey were nearing the village now, and turning a sharp bend of the river\nthey came in sight of it, and the little _Zaire's_ siren yelled and\nsquealed defiantly.\n\nSanders saw a crowd of men come down to the beach, saw the glitter of\nspears, and through his glasses the paint on the bodies of the men. Then\nsix canoes came racing out to meet the steamer.\n\nA corporal of Houssas sat down nonchalantly on a little saddle-seat\nbehind the brass Maxim, and gripped its handles.\n\n\"Five hundred yards,\" said Sanders, and the corporal adjusted the sight\nwithout perceptible hurry.\n\nThe canoes came on at a hurricane speed, for the current was with them.\nThe man behind the gun polished a dull place on the brass water-jacket\nwith the blue sleeves of his coat, and looked up.\n\nSanders nodded.\n\nThe canoes came nearer, one leading the rest in that race where hate\nnerved effort, and death was the prize.\n\nSuddenly--\n\n\"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!\" laughed the little gun sardonically, and the\nleading canoe swung round broadside to the stream, because the men who\nsteered it were dead, and half of the oarsmen also.\n\n\"Ha-ha-ha-h-a-a!\"\n\nThere was a wild scramble on the second canoe; it swayed, capsized, and\nthe river was full of black heads, and the air resounded with shrill\ncries.\n\nAs for the remainder of the flotilla it swung round and made for safety;\nthe machine-gun corporal slipped in another belt of cartridges, and made\ngood practice up to nine hundred yards, from which two canoes,\nfrantically paddled, were comparatively safe.\n\nSanders put his tiny telegraph over to full speed ahead and followed.\n\nOn the shore the Lulungo made a stand, and missiles of many kinds struck\nthe little steamer. But the Maxim sprayed the village noisily, and soon\nthere came a nervous man waving a palm leaf, and Sanders ceased firing,\nand shouted through his megaphone that the messenger must swim aboard.\n\n\"Lord, we feel great shame,\" said the man. He stood in a wet place on\nthe deck, and little rills of water dripped from him. \"We did not know\nwe fought Sandi the lion, Sandi the buffalo, before the stamp of whose\nmighty feet----\"\n\nSanders cut him short.\n\n\"There is a white man, a white woman, and a young girl in your city,\" he\nsaid. \"Bring them to the ship, and then I will sit in the palaver-house,\nand talk this matter over.\"\n\nThe man shuffled uneasily.\n\n\"Master,\" he said, \"the white man died of the sickness; the woman is ill\nalso; as for the girl, I know nothing.\"\n\nSanders looked at him, his head on one side like an inquisitive bird.\n\n\"Bring me the white man, alive or dead,\" he said softly; \"also the white\nwoman, well or ill, and the girl.\"\n\nIn an hour they brought the unfortunate missionary, having taken some\ntime to make him look presentable. The wife of the missionary came in\nanother canoe, four women holding her, because she was mad.\n\n\"Where is the girl?\" asked Sanders. He spoke very little above a\nwhisper.\n\nThe messenger made no answer.\n\n\"The girl?\" said Sanders, and lashed him across the face with his thin\nstick.\n\n\"Master,\" muttered the man, with his head on his chest, \"the chief has\nher.\"\n\nSanders took a turn up and down the deck, then he went to his cabin and\ncame out with two revolvers belted to his hips.\n\n\"I will go and see this chief,\" he said. \"Abiboo, do you run the boat's\nnose into the soft sand of the bank, covering the street with the Maxim\nwhilst I go ashore.\"\n\nHe landed without opposition; neither gun banged nor spear flew as he\nwalked swiftly up the broad street. The girl lay before the chiefs hut\nquite dead, very calm, very still. The hand to cut short her young life\nhad been more merciful than Sanders dared hope. He lifted the child in\nhis arms, and carried her back to the ship. Once he heard a slight noise\nbehind him, but three rifles crashed from the ship, and he heard a thud\nand a whimper of pain.\n\nHe brought the body on board, and laid it reverently on the little\nafter-deck. Then they told him that the woman had died, and he nodded\nhis head slowly, saying it was better so.\n\nThe _Zaire_ backed out into mid-stream, and Sanders stood watching the\ncity wistfully. He wanted the chief of the Lulungo badly; he wanted, in\nhis cold rage, to stake him out in spread-eagle fashion, and kill him\nwith slow fires. But the chief and his people were in the woods, and\nthere were the French territories to fly to.\n\nIn the evening he buried the missionary and his family on a little\nisland, then drove downstream, black rage in his soul, and a sense of\nhis impotence, for you cannot fight a nation with twenty Houssa\npolicemen.\n\nHe came to a little \"wooding\" at dusk, and tied up for the night. In the\nmorning he resumed his journey, and at noon he came, without a moment's\nwarning, into the thick of a war fleet.\n\nThere was no mistaking the character of the hundred canoes that came\nslowly up-stream four abreast, paddling with machine-like regularity.\nThat line on the right were Akasava men; you could tell that by the\nblunt noses of the dug-outs. On the left were the Ochori; their canoes\nwere streaked with red cornwood. In the centre, in lighter canoes of\nbetter make, he saw the white-barred faces of the Isisi people.\n\n\"In the name of heaven!\" said Sanders, with raised eyebrows.\n\nThere was consternation enough in the fleet, and its irregular lines\nwavered and broke, but the _Zaire_ went steaming into the midst of them.\nThen Sanders stopped his engines, and summoned the chiefs on board.\n\n\"What shame is this?\" said Sanders.\n\nOtako, of the Isisi, king and elder chief, looked uncomfortably to Ebeni\nof Akasava, but it was Bosambo, self-appointed ruler of the Ochori, who\nspoke.\n\n\"Lord,\" he said, \"who shall escape the never-sleeping eye of Sandi? Lo!\nwe thought you many miles away, but like the owl----\"\n\n\"Where do you go?\" asked Sanders.\n\n\"Lord, we will not deceive you,\" said Bosambo. \"These great chiefs are\nmy brothers, because certain Lulungo have come down upon our villages\nand done much harm, stealing and killing. Therefore, because we have\nsuffered equally, and are one in misfortune, we go up against the\nLulungo people, for we are human, and our hearts are sore.\"\n\nA grin, a wicked, mirthless grin, parted Sanders' lips.\n\n\"And you would burn and slay?\" he asked.\n\n\"Master, such was the pleasure we had before us.\"\n\n\"Burning the city and slaying the chief, and scattering the people who\nhide in the forest?\"\n\n\"Lord, though they hide in hell we will find them,\" said Bosambo; \"yet,\nif you, who are as a father to us all, say 'nay,' we will assemble our\nwarriors and tell them it is forbidden.\"\n\nSanders thought of the three new graves on a little island.\n\n\"Go!\" he said, pointing up the river.\n\nHe stood on the deck of the _Zaire_ and watched the last canoe as it\nrounded the bend, and listened to the drone of many voices, growing\nfainter and fainter, singing the Song of the Slayer, such as the Isisi\nsing before action.\n\n\n  THE END.\n\n\n  =Transcriber's Notes:=\n  original hyphenation, spelling and grammar have been preserved as in\n    the original\n  Page   9, '\"Chief, said Sanders' changed to '\"Chief,\" said Sanders'\n  Page  14, \"Cailbraith\" changed to \"Calbraith\"\n  Page 107, \"was simple there\" changed to \"was simple--there\"\n  Page 110, \"peace with him\" changed to \"peace with him.\"\n  Page 140, \"his lips impatiently\" changed to \"his lips impatiently.\"\n  Page 145, \"before the other?\" changed to \"before the other;\"\n  Page 163, \"for it we cannot\" changed to \"for if we cannot\"\n  Page 163, \"the way we go\" changed to \"the way we go.\"\n  Page 240, \"midstream\" changed to \"mid-stream\" [Ed. for consistency]\n  Page 242, \"the Matebele rebels\" changed to \"the Matabele rebels\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Sanders of the River, by Edgar Wallace\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SANDERS OF THE RIVER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 35545.txt or 35545.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/5/5/4/35545/\n\nProduced by David T.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
